Three  subprograms  were  envisioned  in  accordance \nwith the time frame and progress of SSR from 2007 onward. The \nESP subprogram I, approved on 1 December 2006, supports the \nNepal Education for All (EFA) program (2004\u20132009) for basic and \nprimary  education  (grades  1\u20135)  with  a  program  loan  for  $30 \nmillion from FY2007 to FY2009. A capacity development grant of \n$2  million  complements  the  ESP  subprogram  I  to  develop \ngovernment stakeholders\u2019 capacity in policy analysis, formulation, \nand coordination. It also supports the preparation of an SSR core \ndocument.  The  ESP  subprogram  II,  approved  on  24  January \n2008,  supports  the  preparation  and  transition  to  SSR  from \nFY2008 to FY2011, in particular a model-building exercise of the \nbasic education extension to grades 1\u20138 in a few districts, as well \nas broad capacity development for system readiness. \n\nThe  ESP  subprogram  III  is  proposed  to  support  the  Government \nin  the  implementation  of  the  SSR  program  from  2009  onward. \nSubprogram  III  will  cover  the  period  from  FY2010  to  FY2012, \nduring which the Government will focus on the implementation of \nbasic  education  restructuring,  while  model  building  activities  will \nbe  initiated  for  secondary  education  and  technical  education  and \nvocational training (TEVT). \n\nOverall,  Nepal  has  been  successful  in  steadily  improving  access \nto  education  at  all  levels  while  narrowing  gender  and  social \ndisparities  in  enrollment.  However,  further  effort  is  needed  to \nimprove the quality of education. High repetition and dropout rates \nindicate low internal efficiency of the education system. The needs \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProgram Description \n\nRationale \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fii \n \n\nof  the  most  disadvantaged  groups  also  need  to  be  addressed \nfurther.  The  education  divide  persists  between  urban,  rural,  and \nremote  areas  as  well  as  between  children  from  well-off  and  less \nwell-off families. \n\nin \n\nThe Government of Nepal has a high commitment to education. A \nkey  national  priority  is  to  increase  equity  in  access  to  education, \nwhile social inclusion is a central approach to reduce disparities in \neducation \nterms  of  gender,  caste,  and  ethnicity.  The \ndecentralization  of  school  management  responsibilities  to  school \nmanagement  committees,  and  community  participation \nin \neducation  are  at  the  center  of  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  to \nimprove  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  education.  To  achieve  the \nEFA  goals,  the  Government  launched  the  Nepal  EFA  Program \n(2004\u20132009),  a  high-priority  program  for  basic  and  primary \neducation  supported  by  14  development  partners,  including  the \nto \nADB.  The  EFA  program  has  substantially  contributed \nimprovements  in  education  sector  outcomes.  In  addition,  it  has \nmade  progress \nsuch  as \nimplementation \ndecentralization,  capacity  development,  financial  management, \nand institutional harmonization. \n\nstrategies \n\nin \n\nTo  build  on  the  achievements  of  EFA,  and  address  some  of \nremaining  shortcomings  and  constraints,  the  Government  has \ndeveloped  the  SSR  program.  The  SSR  program  envisions  a \ntransition  from  the  current  subsector  approach,  with  education \nfinanced by programs such as EFA and the Secondary Education \nSupport Program (SESP), to an integrated SSR program. It aims \nto  restructure  the  primary  and  secondary  school  system  into  an \nin  a  phased  manner.  The \nintegrated  grade  1\u201312  system \nGovernment  recognizes  that  5  years  of  basic  education  is  not \nsufficient  and  intends  to  extend  basic  education  coverage  to \ngrades 1\u20138 and integrate secondary education into grades 9\u201312. \nThe Government also intends to improve synergies between basic \neducation  and  secondary  education  to  achieve  a  more  holistic \napproach  to  school  education.  The  SSR  program  is  partly  a \ncontinuation of earlier programs such as EFA and the SESP, and \npartly  the  beginning  of  new  reforms  characterized  by  strategic \ninterventions  such  as  restructuring  of  school  education,  and \nimprovement  of  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  education.  Through \nthe \nthese  reform  agendas  and  specific \ninterventions, the Government aims to address the 8% of children \n(aged  5\u20139)  currently  out  of  school,  and  the  high  dropout  and \nrepetition \nlevel.  Achieving  sustainable \nimprovements  in  learning  achievement  levels  and  improving  the \ncost-efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  its  services  also  constitute  a \nmajor  focus  in  the  SSR  program.  The  expected  outcome  of  the \nSSR program is a more equitable, inclusive, effective, and holistic \neducation system. The SSR program spans 7 years, from FY2010 \nto FY2016.  \n\nrates  at  primary \n\nimplementation  of \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiii \n\nThe expected overall impact of the ESP cluster program, including \nthe ESP subprogram III, is enhanced educational attainment and \nlivelihood  for  all  children,  particularly  girls  and  disadvantaged \ngroups.  The  expected  outcome  of  the  ESP  subprogram  III  is \nincreased  access  to  and  quality  of  school  education,  particularly \nbasic  education  (grades  1\u20138),  especially  for  girls  and  children \nfrom marginalized groups. \n \nThe SSR program cost is estimated at $2.62 billion for the first 5 \nyears of the SSR program period. The SSR program cost includes \nall  regular  recurrent  and  investment  costs  for  operating  the \nsubsectors  covered  under  the  SSR  program,  as  well  as  the \nadditional  costs  associated  with  the  SSR  reform.  The  currently \nprojected  available  funding  over  the  same  period  is  estimated  at \n$2.26 billion, excluding ADB's proposed assistance.  \n\nto  compliance  with  second \n\nIt  is  proposed  that  under  subprogram  III,  a  grant  of  $70  million \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  and  a  loan  equivalent  to \n$25 million  in  special  drawing  rights  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources be provided. The loan will have an amortization period \nof 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of \n1% per year during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. \n \nThe  ESP  subprogram  III  will  support  the  SSR  program  from \nFY2010 to FY2012. The program period will be from August 2009 \nto  July 2012.  It  is  expected  that  program  completion  will  be  in \nJuly 2012 and the closing date will be December 2012. The grant \nand loan will be released in two tranches of $45 million (tranche 1) \nand $50 million (tranche 2). The first tranche will be released upon \nfulfilling all first tranche release conditions. The second tranche is \nexpected  to  be  released  within  18  months  of  the  release  of  the \nfirst,  subject \nrelease \nconditions. The first tranche will be disbursed fully from the grant \nresources.  The  second  tranche  will  be  a  combination  of  the \nbalance  of  the  grant  resources  ($25  million)  and  the  loan \n($25 million). \n \nThe  ESP  subprogram  III  will  follow  the  program  management \narrangements specified in the revised joint financing arrangement \n(JFA) for SSR. The JFA details the goals of the SSR program; the \nresponsibilities of the Government and the development partners; \nthe  funding  mechanism;  and  fiduciary  requirements,  including \nprocurement,  reporting,  monitoring  and  auditing,  and  other \nadministrative requirements. The JFA development partners meet \nregularly  to  review  the  financial  and  operational  status  and \nprogress of SSR and to commit and disburse funds. \n \nThe Ministry of Education (MOE) is the Executing Agency and the \nDepartment of Education (DOE) is the Implementing Agency.  \n \n\ntranche \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nProgram Period and \nTranching \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n \n\nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nProgram Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nineligible \n\nimports,  and \n\nThe  grant  and  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full \nforeign exchange costs (excluding local duties and taxes) of items \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \nineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral  sources.  No  supporting  import  documentation  will  be \nrequired  if,  during  each  year  that  grant  and  loan  proceeds  are \nexpected to be disbursed, the value of total imports minus imports \nfrom  nonmember  countries, \nimports \nfinanced  under  other  official  development  assistance,  is  equal  to \nor  greater  than  the  amount  of  the grant  and  loan  expected  to  be \ndisbursed  during  such  year.  The  Government  will  certify  its \ncompliance  with  this  formula  with  its  withdrawal  request.  ADB \nreserves the right to audit the use of grant and loan proceeds and \nverify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. Procurement \nof eligible items and recruitment of consultants will be on the basis \nof  standard  government  procurement  and  recruitment  practices \nacceptable  to  ADB  for  procurement  and  recruitment  by  the \nGovernment or its representatives. \n \nThe  local  currency  funds  generated  from  the  proceeds  of  the \nprogram  grant  and  loan  will  be  used  by  the  Government  to \nsupplement  the  cost  associated  with  implementation  of  the  SSR \nprogram. \n \nThe  Program  is  expected  to  generate  substantial  economic \nbenefits.  Three  distinct  economic  benefits  can  be  identified  as  a \npotential  result  of  the  SSR  program:  (i)  increased  access  to \neducation,  resulting  in  more  workers  in  the  future  with  at  least \n8 years  of  schooling  and  with  higher  earnings  as  a  result; \n(ii) enhanced  education  quality  and  relevance,  resulting  in  higher \nproductivity  and  earnings  on  the  part  of  everyone  who  has \ncompleted basic education; and (iii) improvement in the education \nsystem\u2019s internal efficiency. The Program will benefit the children \nand  youth  of  Nepal, \nfrom \ndisadvantaged communities. \n \nthe \nThe  SSR  program \nGovernment.  It  requires  the  commitment  of  substantial  financial \nresources.  Macroeconomic  stability  and  sustained  economic \ngrowth  are  crucial  for  the  Government  to  be  able  to  allocate \nsufficient recurrent budget to education. Particularly in the current \nmacroeconomic environment, funding for education should not be \ncompromised. The Government has accorded high priority to the \neducation  sector  and  has  committed  to  ensure  that  adequate \nfunding will continue to be allocated to the SSR program.  \n\nin  particular  girls  and  children \n\nis  a  comprehensive  program \n\nfor \n\nPolitical stability is important for the success of the SSR program. \nWhile  the  scope  for  a  more  conducive  political  environment  has \nimproved  since  the  end  of  the  conflict,  peace  building  and \nreconstruction continue to be a fragile process that entails political \nrisks. The achievements of the school system and the successful \n\n \n\n\fv \n\nimplementation  of \ndemonstrated \nthe \nchallenging political circumstances in the past. \n\nthe  previous  education  programs  have \nin \nresilience  of \n\nthe  education  system \n\nContinuous efforts are required to ensure that program funds are \nused  appropriately.  Nepal\u2019s  overall  fiduciary  risk  level  remains \nhigh. In this respect, the SSR program has adopted the additional \ncontrol  mechanisms  introduced  under  the  JFA  to  reduce  the \noverall  risk  to  an  acceptable  level.  Governance  measures  have \nbeen  further  strengthened  with  the  adoption  of  the  Governance \nAccountability and Action Plan, agreed to by the Government and \ndevelopment partners pooling funds through the JFA.  \n\nAs  the  SSR  is  a  major  reform  program,  some  resistance  to \nchange  from  within  the  system,  as  well  as  outside  the  system, \ncould  be  expected.  This  risk  has  been  mitigated  throughout  the \ndesign process by seeking wide stakeholder feedback and inputs, \nand the process is supported at a high political level with cabinet \napproval of the SSR core document.  \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nincrease  in  the  program  cluster  amount,  (ii)  a  proposed  grant,  and  (iii)  a  proposed  loan,  all  to \nNepal for subprogram III of the Education Sector Program (ESP).  \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONTEXT \n\n2. \nNepal, with per capita income of about $447 (FY2009), is the poorest country in South \nAsia. Key development challenges include widespread poverty (31% in 2004) and high income \ninequality (Gini coefficient of 41.1% in 2004).  \n\n3. \nNepal\u2019s  recent  economic  development  has  been  modest.  The  difficult  political \nenvironment for reforms and development activities resulted in annual average gross domestic \nproduct  (GDP)  growth  of  4.1%  during  FY2004\u2013FY2009.  This  growth  was  underpinned  by  a \ngenerally  stable  macroeconomic  situation.  The  improved  security  situation  after  2006  mainly \nbenefited the growth of services, which surpassed the relatively slow growth in agriculture and \nindustries.  The  fiscal  deficit  was  contained,  at  an  average  of  1.5%  of  GDP  over  FY2004\u2013\nFY2009, while strong remittances inflow and tourism receipts helped maintain a surplus current \naccount  throughout  the  period,  except  in  FY2007.  Overall  average  inflation  over  FY2004\u2013\nFY2009 was at about 7%.  \n\nAided  by  the  improved  security  situation,  overall  GDP  growth  increased  from  3.3%  in \n4. \nFY2007 to 5.3% in FY2008, but slowed down to 4.7% in FY2009. Given its limited exposure to \nthe global financial system, the global economic slowdown is expected to have limited impact on \nNepal. However, some impact may be inevitable on exports, remittances, tourism receipts, and \nexternal assistance, especially if the global recession is prolonged. In view of this, GDP growth \nis forecast to slow further to 3.5% in FY2010. Average consumer inflation jumped up to 13% in \nFY2009 from 7.7% a year earlier.  \n\n5. \nImproved  revenue  mobilization  helped  contain  the  budget  deficit  at  1.9%  of  GDP  in \nFY2009 despite a surge in expenditure. Total spending swelled by 15%, mainly because of the \npeace  process,  resulting  in  an  improved  project  implementation  environment.  Total  revenue \ngrew robustly by 18% in FY2009 supported by stronger tax administration. It increased to 18% \nof  GDP,  a  gain  of  about  2.7  percentage  points  from  a  year  earlier.  Continued  successful \nimprovements  in  revenue  collection  and  sustained  support  from  development  partners  will  be \nthe key to maintaining macroeconomic stability.  \n\n6. \nOn the political front, the end of the conflict in 2006 and the improved security situation \nhave  opened  up  the  \u201cdevelopment  space,\u201d  facilitating  revival  of  development  activities.  The \npeace process has since progressed, with orderly conduct of the historic Constituent Assembly \nelection  in  April  2008  and  the  installation  of  an  elected  coalition  government  led  by  the \nCommunist  Party  of  Nepal  (Maoist)  in  August  2008.  However,  the  fragility  of  the  democratic \nprocess  was  proven  by  the  quickly  deteriorating  situation  following  a  political  standoff  with \nrespect  to  the  integration  of  soldiers.  Following  the  withdrawal  of  key  coalition  partners,  the \nPrime  Minister  resigned  on  4  May  2009.  A  new  coalition  government  led  by  the  Communist \nParty  of  Nepal  (Unified Marxist-Leninist)  was  subsequently  formed.  Without  the  support  of  the \nCommunist Party of Nepal (Maoist), the inclusiveness of the political process remains limited.  \n\n7. \nA key mandate of the new government is to facilitate drafting a new and more inclusive \nconstitution that will also define the structure and substance of a new federal republic state, the \ndecision  on  which  was  taken  by  the  first  session  of  the  601-member  Constituent  Assembly  in \nMay  2008,  abolishing  the  centuries-old  monarchy.  The  process  has  begun  but  progress  has \nbeen  impeded  by  some  major  political  hitches.  The  constitution  drafting  process  involves  the \ndaunting task of addressing deep-rooted and divisive issues of ethnicity, regionalism, caste, and \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n \n\ngender.  The  Constituent  Assembly  is  determined  to  finalize  drafting  the  constitution  by \nMay 2010, but a delay is expected because of the recent change in government. After approval \nof  the  new  constitution,  national  political  elections  will  be  held,  followed  by  local  political \nelections.  \n\nPending  finalization  of  the  state  restructuring  process,  further  reform  measures  in  the \n8. \ndecentralization  process  are  unlikely.  There  are  currently  no  elected  local  government  bodies \nbut  they  may  be  formed  as  an  interim  measure  after  some  understanding  between  major \npolitical parties is reached.  \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance  \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\nThe  current  education  system  of  Nepal  consists  of  preschool  and  early  childhood \n9. \neducation  and  development  (ECED),  5  years  of  primary  education  (grades  1\u20135),  3  years  of \nlower  secondary  education  (grades  6\u20138),  2  years  of  secondary  education  (grades  9\u201310), \n2 years  of  higher  secondary  education  (grades  11\u201312),  technical  education  and  vocational \ntraining (TEVT), tertiary education, and adult literacy (Appendix 2). A school leaving certificate \n(SLC) is awarded by a national examination at the end of grade 10, and a high school leaving \ncertificate (HSLC) is awarded at the end of grade 12.  \n\nBroadly, schools are categorized into four types: (i) community-aided (public schools that \n10. \nare  fully  supported  by  the  Government  for  teachers\u2019  salaries  and  other  operational  costs), \n(ii) community-managed  (public  schools  that  are  fully  supported  by  the  Government  for \nteachers\u2019 salaries and operational costs but whose management responsibility is undertaken by \nthe community), (iii) community-unaided (public schools that are either receiving partial support \nor  no  support  from  the  Government),  and  (iv)  institutional  schools  (private  schools  supported \nentirely  by  parents  and  trustees).  In  addition  to  these  categories,  religious  schools  such  as \nMadarsa (Islamic), Gumba (Buddhist), and Gurukul (Hindu), offer mostly primary education.  \n\nAt  central  level,  the  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE)  is  responsible  for  overall  policy \n11. \ndevelopment, planning, monitoring, and evaluation of the education sector. Under MOE, school \neducation  is  administered  by  the  Department  of  Education  (DOE),  through  District  Education \nOffices  (DEOs)  in  the  75  districts.  DEOs  are  responsible  for  ensuring  the  flow  of  funds  to \nschools for salaries as well as distribution of provisions such as textbooks and teacher training \nactivities.  At  the  community  level,  school  management  committees  (SMCs)\u2014composed  of \nrepresentatives from parents, community members, and school administrators\u2014play significant \nroles in the management of the school. In the case of community-managed schools, SMCs also \ntake  responsibility  for  the  recruitment  and  management  of  teachers  as  well  as  resource \nmobilization.  Higher  secondary  education  is  managed  separately  under  the  Higher  Secondary \nEducation  Board,  while  administration  of  TEVT  is  under  the  responsibility  of  the  Council  for \nTechnical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT). \n\n12. \nParticipation  in  education  has  expanded  at  all  levels,  resulting  in  substantial  growth  of \nthe  education  system.  In  2008,  the  gross  enrollment  rate  (GER)  for  ECED  reached  63.4%. \nThe percentage of grade 1 students with ECED experience was up to 36.2% in 2008 from \n8.0% in 2001. As primary education enrollment has reached 91.9% and primary completion has \nreached about 76%, demand for postprimary education has increased. From 2001 to 2008, the \nnet enrollment rate (NER) for primary education rose from 81.0% to 91.9%. The NER for lower \nsecondary education grew from 42.9% to 52.3%, while the NER for secondary education grew \nfrom 29.5% to 34.7% from 2001 to 2008. The NER for higher secondary education was 11% in \n2008.  \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nNepal  has  managed  to  achieve  overall  enrollment  increases,  accompanied  by  a \n13. \nreduction  in  gender,  caste  and  ethnic  disparity.  The  Gender  Parity  Index  for  the  primary  NER \nshows  a  steady  improvement  from  0.60  in  2001  to  0.97  in  2008.  Girls  represent  49.5%  of \nprimary enrollment, 48.2% of lower secondary enrollment, and 47.2% of secondary enrollment \nin 2008. Data indicate that the enrollment of Dalits1 and Janajatis2 has increased substantially \nover  the  past  5  years\u2014the  enrollment  of  Dalits  has  increased  from  600,000  in  2003  to \nalmost  1  million  in  2008,  while  the  enrollment  of  Janajatis  has  increased  from  less  than  1 \nmillion in 2003 to almost 2 million in 2008, both with near gender parity. Incentive payments, \nin  addition  to  the  provision  of  free  primary  education  to  overcome  the  opportunity  costs  of \neducation, have been perceived as having made an impact on the access of girls, Dalits, and \ndisadvantaged Janajatis. \n\nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n14. \nOverall,  Nepal  has  been  successful  in  steadily  improving  access  to  education  at  all \nlevels while narrowing gender and social disparities in enrollment. However, indications of poor \nlearning outcomes suggest that considerable effort is needed to improve the quality of education. \nHigh  repetition  and  dropout  rates  indicate  low  internal  efficiency  of  the  education  system.  The \nneeds  of  the  most  disadvantaged  groups  also  need  to  be  addressed  further.  The  education \ndivide persists between urban, rural, and remote areas as well as between children from well-off \nand less well-off families. \n\n15. \nQuality.  Student  achievement  in  primary  and  lower  secondary  education  is  weak.  \nComparison between a national assessment conducted in 2008 and a previous assessment in \n1999 shows continued weakness in mathematics and English, relative strength in social studies, \nand  a  decline  in  Nepali  mean  scores.  The  2008  national  assessment  showed  that  grade  5 \nstudents  master \nframework\u2019s \nthe  material  specified \nspecifications  grid  for  each  grade  and  subject  area\u201416%  of  the  sampled  schools  had \nachievement  levels  below  30%.  It  further  found  significant  variations  between  students  from \ndifferent  socioeconomic  and  ethnic  groups,  indicating  that  the  education  system  did  not \ncompensate for differences in geographical, social, and economic backgrounds.  \n\nthe  curriculum \n\nthan  half \n\nless \n\nin \n\n16. \n\nKey constraints to better quality education include the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nIt \n\nis  estimated \n\nin  some  areas. \n\nLack  of  teachers.  Teacher  numbers  have  been  increasing  but  student \nenrollments  have  more  than  kept  pace,  so  the  overall  primary  student\u2013teacher \nratio  is  higher  in  2008  (44:1)  than  in  2003  (40:1).  This  has  resulted  in \novercrowded  classrooms \nthat  about \n19,300 additional  teachers  are  needed  to  achieve  the  desired  student\u2013teacher \nratio in primary education. \nLack of teacher training. Only 66% of primary teachers and 77% of secondary \nteachers possess the required qualifications and training.  \nLack of grasp of new teaching methodologies. While there are more teachers \nand  more  trained  teachers,  the  effort  required  to  change  classroom  processes \nhas  seemingly  been  underestimated  and  these  remain  unsatisfactory  in  many \nschools.  The  potential  of  an  inclusive,  child-friendly  approach  to  enable  any \nschool  to  include  the  vast  majority  of  children  in  its  catchment  area  has  been \nrecognized by some stakeholders. \nLack  of  teacher  supervision.  Supervision  is  one  of  the  weaker  links  in  the \nschool management system in Nepal. The Technical Review of School Education \n\n                                                 \n1  Historically disadvantaged occupational caste group. \n2  Ethnic minority group.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n \n\n20053 reported  minimal  supervision  and  monitoring  visits  by  resource  persons \nand  school  supervisors.  The  average  visit  of  resource  persons  to  the  schools \nsampled  by  the  review  was  less  than  once  in  a  6-month  period,  although \nresource persons are supposed to visit the schools once a month. \n\nEfficiency.  Improving  the  internal  efficiency  of  the  public school  system,  especially  in \n17. \nthe early grades of primary education, remains a challenge. The grade 1 gross intake rate (GIR) \nwas  148%  in  2008,  reflecting  substantial  underage  and  overage  enrollment.  This  creates \novercrowding of classrooms and impedes the pedagogical process. In turn, it becomes a factor \nfor  high  repetition  and dropout  rates.  Repetition  rates  have  decreased  by  9  percentage  points \nover the past decade but by only 3\u20134 percentage points since 2005. Rates overall do not vary \nsignificantly for girls and boys. Repetition in grade 1 continues to be higher compared to higher \ngrades, although the repetition rate in grade 1 has fallen from 39% in 2001 to 28% in 2008. The \nsurvival rate to grade 5 was 73%, and the transition rate to lower secondary was 77% in 2008. \nHigh  GIRs,  and  repetition  and  dropout  rates  contribute  to  overall  low  efficiency  of  education \ndelivery. In basic education, it currently takes on average 11.5 student-years to complete the 8-\nyear education course. SLC pass rates for students from community schools have ranged from \n25% to 60% over the past decade. However, only 51% of public school students in 2007 passed \nSLC examinations as opposed to 90% of private school students \n\n18. \nEquity  of  access.  There  have  been  improvements  in  equity  of  access  but  gender, \ncaste, and ethnic disparities in enrollment increase with the level of education. Poverty remains \na  major  barrier  in  access  to  education  for  the  most  disadvantaged  groups.  Performance, \nparticularly of the Dalits, needs attention as their pass and promotion rates are below average. \nGender  and  socioeconomic  gaps  widen  markedly  in  the  transition  from  grade  5  to  lower \nsecondary.  In  addition,  geographic  inequalities  in  provision  remain\u2014schools  serving  the \npoorest and most marginalized communities are the least well staffed, resourced, or supported. \nTo address these issues, a recently conducted evaluation study4 of the primary Education for All \n(EFA) program recommended to simplify further and sharpen scholarship schemes and criteria, \nwhile  continuing  to  keep  all  types  of  basic  education  free  of  direct  fees  and  costs.  The \nevaluation study also recommended that additional funding should be targeted to disadvantaged \nschools for locally relevant strategies to address the opportunity costs of education. \n\nTeacher  management.  Uneven  deployment  of  government  teachers,  the  need  for \n19. \nquality enhancement of teachers, a shortfall in resources whereby government resources do not \nfully  cover  teachers'  salaries,  and  teacher  absenteeism  are  key  challenges  related  to  teacher \nmanagement. Teachers play an important role in improving the quality of education and quality \nimprovements  can  only  be  sought  with  an  adequately  sized  teacher-force,  with  teachers  who \nare  well-trained,  and  committed  to  improving  the  learning  outcomes  of  children  in  their \nclassrooms.  \n\n20. \nSubsector-specific  constraints.  In  ECED,  investments  have  not  yet  resulted  in \nincreased efficiency by reducing underage enrollments in grade 1 and lowering repetition rates \nin  early  grades.  Moreover,  ECED  services  fail  to  cater  to  the  most  excluded  groups  because \nECED centers are concentrated in relatively developed areas. In secondary education, financing \nconstitutes  a  major  challenge.  The  Interim  Constitution  of  2007  states  that  free  secondary \neducation  will  be  provided  by  the  state.  However,  secondary  schools  collect  tuition  at  present \nand  budgetary  space  does  not  allow  fulfilling  the  aspirations  of  the  constitution.  Furthermore, \nteacher  shortages  negatively  affect  the  quality  of  secondary  education  and  create  a  barrier  to \n\n                                                 \n3  MOE. 2005.

Oslo. \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nexpansion  of  access  to  secondary  education.  Higher  secondary  education  suffers  from  poor \ncoordination with secondary education, and integration of higher secondary education with the \nschool  system  has  been  slow  for  institutional  reasons  and  because  of  limited  government \ninvolvement.  \n\nC. \n\nThe Government\u2019s Strategy \n\n1. \n\nEducation for All Program \n\n21. \nThe Government has a high commitment to education, as reflected in successive Five-\nyear  plans5 and  the  Three-Year  Interim  Plan  (FY2008\u2013FY2010).6 A  key  national  priority  is  to \nincrease  equity  in  access  to  education.  Social  inclusion  is  a  central  approach  to  reduce \ndisparities in education in terms of gender, caste, and ethnicity. The decentralization of school \nmanagement  responsibilities  to  SMCs,  and  community  participation  in  education  are  at  the \ncenter of the Government\u2019s strategy to improve the quality and efficiency of education. In 2000, \nNepal joined the global EFA movement.7 The national plan of action for EFA 2015 was drawn \nup with the vision of achieving quality basic and primary education for all by 2015. To achieve \nthe EFA goals, the Government launched the Nepal EFA Program (2004\u20132009),8 a high-priority \nprogram for basic and primary education supported by 14 development partners, including the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  Three  objectives  were  identified:  (i)  ensuring  access  and \nequity in primary education; (ii) enhancing the quality and relevance of primary education; and \n(iii) improving  efficiency  and  institutional  capacity.  The  EFA  program  has  substantially \ncontributed to sector outcomes in primary education. Appendix 3 reports progress on key EFA \noutcome  indicators.  It  has  also  made  progress  in  implementation  strategies  such  as \ndecentralization, capacity development, financial management, and institutional harmonization. \n\nDecentralization.  The  most  significant  progress  has  been  in  revitalizing  SMCs  and \n22. \nhanding  schools  back  to  be  managed  by  communities.  Implementation  of  the  program  has \nsteadily passed to the districts, and schools, for implementation. The program has made good \nprogress toward the target of having 8,000 schools managed by communities. However, many \nschools  remain  under  DEO  management  since  their  resource  base  and  local  leadership  does \nnot  provide  the  conditions  for  self-management.  SMCs  need  to  be  made  more  functional  to \nensure successful handover. Moving forward, it is necessary to enhance the capacity of SMCs \nand  resources,  corresponding  with  their  responsibilities,  and  to  explore  ways  of  ensuring  that \nthe composition of the SMC is representative and that individual members serve students\u2019 best \ninterests. \n\n23. \nCapacity development. Efforts to develop capacity have largely focused on the central \nlevel  and  have  resulted  in  improved  capacity  to  implement  the  program.  Planning  and \nownership  have  improved  during  implementation  of  the  program.  Central  planning  and \nmanagement,  reporting,  the  education  management  information  system  and  Flash  Reports,9 \nand  decentralized  planning  have  all  improved\u2014as  has  the  quality  of  the  annual  strategic \nimplementation  plan  (ASIP),  annual  work  plan  and  budget  (AWPB),  and  the  semiannual  EFA \nprogress reports. The ASIP guides implementation of the program activities and is prepared by \n\n                                                 \n5   National  Planning  Commission,  Government  of  Nepal.  1998.

The Flash I Report is a snapshot of data at the beginning of the school  year \nwhile the Flash II report focuses on end of school year data. The national Flash Reports are prepared on the basis \nof 75 district Flash Reports directly from schools. Flash Reports cover enrollment, pass rates of students, repetition \nand survival rates, training status of teachers, supply of textbooks and learning materials. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n \n\nthe Government. However, linkages with lower governance levels remain weak. EFA expanded \nthe concept of school improvement plans (SIPs), introduced under the government's Basic and \nPrimary Education Program II. SIPs intended to introduce a bottom\u2013up approach in education \nplanning  and  were  envisioned  as  tools  for  \u201cimproving  access,  quality  and  management  of \neducational processes at the school and community levels\u201d (footnote 4). The SIP process was \nalso  \u201ca  planning  mechanism  to  prioritize  schools\u2019  human,  material  and  financial  resources  to \nachieve the optimum possible outcomes\u201d (footnote 4). It was envisaged that the SIP would be \nthe  basic  building  material  for  village,  municipal  and  district  education  plans.  While  SIPs  are \nbeing widely prepared by schools, the mechanism where SIPs feed into village education plans, \ndistrict  education  plans,  and  the  ASIP  has  scope  for  improvement.  As  a  result,  planning \ncontinues  to  be  largely  a  top\u2013down  process  with  incremental  budgeting  and  no  clear \nprioritization for districts or activities in need of more resources. \n\n24. \nFinancial management. Over 2004\u20132009, the planning and budgeting and measures of \nperformance have also improved. The measures of physical and financial performance are both \napproaching 100%. The main problem occurs in the distribution of funds from central to school \nlevel.  Delays  in  fund  release  affect  scholarship  distribution,  appointment  of  teachers,  textbook \navailability,  and  construction  activities  at  schools.  Delays  in  the  release  of  funds  occur  at  the \ncentral  level  (because  of  delays  in  approval  of  the  AWPB  and  delayed  issuance  of  spending \nauthorization) and the district level (resulting from limited capacity to deal with peaks of work). In \n2008, just over half of the students received their books (either a full or partial set) within the first \n2 weeks of the school year. At the time of the EFA midterm review, DOE presented a short-term \naction plan to improve financial management in order to address the following concerns raised \nby  the  joint  financing  arrangement  (JFA)  partners  based  on  the  financial  monitoring  report \n(FMR): (i) delays in funds release to district offices, (ii) delays in submission of FMRs, (iii) the \nquality of school audits, and (iv) compliance with social audits. Subsequently, a committee was \nset  up  to  monitor  implementation  of  the  action  plan.  A  recent  financial  assessment  noted \nsatisfactory progress on the action plan. \n\nProgram-based  approach  and  program  design.  At  the  process  level,  EFA  has \n25. \ndemonstrated the usefulness and effectiveness of development partner harmonization. The JFA \nhas  helped harmonize  resources  and  develop  a  culture  of  partnership, and  has  contributed  to \nreducing  the  transaction  cost  of  program  management  for  the  Government  and  development \npartners.  The  JFA  has  also  contributed  to  strengthening  in-country  capacity  through  greater \nreliance  on  country  systems.  Further,  the  development  partner  harmonization  process \ndeveloped by MOE in education has been a model for progress in the country. The Government \nhas started a dialogue with development partners to extend program-based approaches (PBAs) \nto other sectors. \n\n2. \n\nSchool Sector Reform Program \n\n26. \nTo  build  on  the  achievements  of  EFA,  and  address  some  of  the  shortcomings  and \nconstraints, the Government has developed the school sector reform (SSR) program. The SSR \nprogram envisions a transition from the current subsector approach, with education financed by \nprograms  such  as  EFA  and  the  Secondary  Education  Support  Program  (SESP), 10  to  an \nintegrated  program  approach.  SSR  aims  to  restructure  the  primary  and  secondary  school \nsystem into an integrated grade 1\u201312 system in a phased manner. The Government recognizes \nthat 5 years of basic education is not sufficient and intends to extend basic education coverage \nto grades 1\u20138 and integrate secondary education into grades 9\u201312. It also intends to improve \nsynergies  between  basic  education  and  secondary  education  to  achieve  a  more  holistic \napproach  to  school  education.  The  SSR  program  is  partly  a  continuation  of  earlier  programs \n\n                                                 \n10 MOE. 2002. Secondary Education Support Programme Core Document. Kathmandu. \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nsuch as EFA and the SESP, and partly the beginning of new reforms characterized by strategic \ninterventions  such  as  restructuring  school  education,  and  improvement  of  the  quality  and \nefficiency  of  education.  Through  implementation  of  these  reform  agendas  and  specific \ninterventions, the Government aims to address the 8% of children (age 5\u20139) and about 25% of \nchildren (age 5\u201312) currently out-of-school, and high dropout and repetition rates at the primary \nand lower secondary level. Achieving sustainable improvements in learning achievement levels \nand improving the cost-efficiency and effectiveness of its services also constitute a major focus \nin  SSR.  The  expected  outcome  of  the  SSR  program  is  a  more  equitable,  inclusive,  effective, \nand  holistic  education  system.  The  SSR  program  implementation  period  spans  7  years,  from \nFY2010 to FY2016. \n\na. \n\nSSR Key Features \n\nIn accordance with the Interim Constitution, SSR guarantees free basic education to all \n27. \nchildren  and  encourages  local  governments  to  make  basic  education  compulsory.  A  range  of \naffirmative  actions  to  support  education  for  girls  and  disadvantaged  groups  has  been  defined. \nSSR intends to provide multiple educational choices to schools and communities with regard to \nlearning content, medium of instruction, learning materials, and delivery methods. Strategies to \nimprove  the  relevance  of  education  to  local  needs  include  multigrade  teaching  and  the \ndevelopment and teaching of local content curriculum.  \n\nStrategies to improve the quality and relevance of education have been strengthened. A \n28. \nprerequisite is the setting of norms and standards for quality improvement and assurance at all \nlevels. Quality control is to be assured by an independent monitoring body accountable to the \ninterministerial Education Policy Committee (EPC). Quality is also to be measured by learning \noutcomes.  The  curriculum  will  be  revised  to  make  it  more  competency-based.  Teachers\u2019 \nminimum qualifications will be redefined according to the restructuring of grades 1\u20138 and grades \n9\u201312. Guidelines for teacher development have been developed.  \n\n29. \nSSR  ultimately  envisions  a  contractual  model  between  central  and  local  government \nbodies and the schools, wherein government bodies will be responsible for providing minimum \nenabling  conditions  for  learning;  in  exchange,  schools  will  be  responsible  for  achieving  an \nagreed standard for service delivery, learning achievements, and outcomes.  \n\nThe  SSR  program  is  backed  by  several  key  legal  and  policy  documents  in  Nepal:  The \n30. \nInterim Constitution of 2007; the Education Act of 1971, and Education Regulation of 2002; the \nEducation for All National Plan of Action 2001\u20132015 of 2001; the Three-Year Interim Plan 2007\u2013\n2010  of  2007;  the  School  Sector  Reform  core  document  of  2008;  and  the  Higher  Secondary \nEducation  Act  of  1989. The  Interim  Constitution  entitles  each  citizen  to receive  free  education \nfrom  the  state  up  to  secondary  level,  and  each  community  has  the  right  to  provide  basic \neducation  in  its  mother  tongue  to  preserve  and  promote  its  script  and  cultural  heritage.  The \nEducation  Act  and  Education  Regulation  serve  as  a  basic  legal  framework  for  the  overall \nmanagement  and  administration  of  school  education  for  grades  1\u201310.  The  Higher  Secondary \nEducation  Act  was  amended  in  2006  to  integrate  higher  secondary  education  with  the  school \nsystem. The Education for All National Plan of Action is a core policy document in the education \nsector, with the main focus on primary education. The Three-Year Interim Plan was prepared by \nthe  National  Planning  Commission  and  approved  by  the  Government.  Under  the  reformed \nsystem of 8-year basic education (grades 1\u20138) followed by 4-year secondary education (grades \n9\u201312),  it  states  that  general,  technical,  and  vocational  courses  will  be  further  developed  and \nintroduced  at  the  secondary  level.  It  also  spells  out  the  need  for  a  revised  policy  to  expand \naccess to secondary education, especially among people below the poverty line. The SSR core \ndocument restructures the fragmented school system into two tiers\u2014basic and secondary.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n \n\nb. \n\nSSR Development Process \n\n31. \nSSR  initiation.  The  Government  has  long  envisioned  extending  basic  education  to \ncover  grades  1\u20138  and  integrating  secondary  education  to  cover  grades  9\u201312  to  restructure \nschool education into an integrated grade 1\u201312 school system, with the objective of improving \nsynergies  between  the  basic  and  secondary  subsectors.  As  early  as  2004,  the  Government \nrequested  technical  assistance  from  ADB11 to  develop  a  holistic,  programmatic  approach  for \ngrades 1\u201312.  \n\nleadership \n\nEducation  Policy  Committee.  At  MOE\u2019s  initiative,  an  interministerial  EPC  was \n32. \nestablished by the cabinet in June 2006. The EPC is a permanent education policy formulation \nand  coordination  structure  at \nto  provide  broad \ninterministerial  policy  guidance  for  the  education  sector,  in recognition of  the  key  role  of  other \nstakeholders  in  the  provision  of  education,  in  addition  to  MOE.  To  coordinate  efforts  in  the \neducation  sector,  the  EPC  was  established  to  harmonize  approaches  among  the  different \nministries  involved.  One  of  the  EPC\u2019s  first  tasks  was  to  develop  a  concept  paper  that \nrecommends a policy direction for the grade 1\u201312 school system, then to provide guidance on \nthe preparation of the new grade 1\u201312 core document. The EPC has advised the Government \non  adjustments  to  education  governance  and  on  the  management  and  financing  structures \nneeded to support an equitable and effective grade 1\u201312 school system. \n\nIt  was  established \n\nlevel. \n\nSSR  core  document.  The  Government  subsequently  embarked  on  the  preparation  of \n33. \nthe  SSR  core  document  to  guide  the  preparation  and  transition  from  the  subsector  approach, \nwith  education  financed  by  programs  such  as  the  EFA  and  the  SESP,  to  an  integrated  SSR \nprogram. The core document guides the implementation of SSR. It serves as a policy guide for \ngradual  introduction  of  the  grade  1\u201312  integrated  system.  It  also  clarifies  the  Government\u2019s \nlong-term  vision  and  commitments  with  respect  to  the  provision,  promotion,  and  appraisal  of \neducational services within the framework of the grade 1\u201312 system. The SSR core document \nwas approved by the Council of Ministers in June 2008. \n\nSSR  plan.  After  approval  of  the  SSR  core  document,  the  Government  initiated \n34. \npreparation  of  the  SSR  plan,  a  long-term  strategic  plan  that  translates  the  broad  policy \ndirections of the SSR core document into implementable strategic interventions. The SSR plan \ndescribes  the  goals  and  objectives  that  will  be  pursued  by  the  Government  from  FY2010  to \nFY2016.  The  plan  comprises  the  key  strategic  interventions  and  the  estimated  financial \nresources  required  to  implement  these  strategies.  It  plans  to  focus  on  the  extension  of  basic \neducation  to  grades  1\u20138  during  its  initial  phase  (FY2010\u2013FY2012)  and  gradually  extend \nsecondary  education  to  grades  9\u201312  (FY2013\u2013FY2016).  The  SSR  plan  was  presented  to  the \ndevelopment partners during the pre-appraisal mission in December 2008.  \n\n35. \nSSR  5-year  implementation  plan.  The  SSR  core  document  and  the  SSR  plan  have \nbeen developed for a 7-year time frame (FY2010\u2013FY2016) in view of working toward achieving \nthe  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  for  education  by  2015.  However,  a  7-year  time \nhorizon presents multiple challenges in terms of planning and detailing implementation plans. In \nterms  of  financing,  7  years  extends  beyond  the  planning horizon  of  both  the  Government  and \ndevelopment partners. Moreover, the current uncertain macroeconomic environment dictates a \ncautious approach with respect to funding availability. The Government correspondingly phased \nthe implementation of SSR and reduced the overall budget requirement from $5.1 billion to $4.1 \nbillion  over  the  7-year  period.  It  further  developed  a  5-year  implementation  plan  within  a \ncorresponding budget envelope of $2.6 billion and has adjusted output targets accordingly. This \n5-year plan was submitted to the development partners in June 2009 and has formed the basis \n                                                 \n11 ADB.  2004.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nof  the  development  partners\u2019  appraisal  process.  Development  partners\u2019  contributions  are \nexpected  to  be  allocated  to  this  plan.  The  broader  vision  expressed  in  the  core  document \nremains valid and serves as a guide for expansion of the program in case additional sources are \nidentified. \n\nSSR model building. The Government recognized that preparation of a comprehensive \n36. \nreform program such as SSR is a complex and lengthy process that requires several important \nsteps. Given the many strategic options and alternatives being considered for introduction under \nSSR,  the  Government  felt  that  testing  alternatives  and  further  developing  capacity  for \nimplementing  the  SSR  program  was  necessary.  It  prepared  an  initial  SSR  transitional  plan, \nwhich includes a model building of the extension of basic education from grades 1\u20135 to grades \n1\u20138  in  selected  districts.  Furthermore,  stakeholders\u2019  capacity  development  requirements  at \nvarious  levels  were  identified,  and  capacity  development  initiated.  Lessons  learned  and \nexperiences gained from implementation of grade 1\u20138 basic education in selected districts and \nschools will feed into the preparation process for full implementation of the SSR program.  \n\n37. \nStakeholder  consultation.  Stakeholder  involvement  in  the  development  of  SSR  was \nensured within the ministry, as well as at the central and local level. SSR development was led \nby a group of senior MOE officials under the guidance of the interministerial EPC\u2014involving the \nNational  Planning  Commission,  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  the  Ministry  of  Women  and  Social \nAffairs, and the Ministry of Local Development. SSR was developed by MOE and experts from \nthe line agencies. The work was supported by a number of thematic local experts. A series of \nstakeholder consultations was held, involving political parties, teacher unions, Dalit associations, \ndistrict  offices,  and  school  management  committees.  Stakeholder  consultation  entailed  a \nlengthy  process  of  consensus  building  among  stakeholders  with  differing  backgrounds  and \ninterests. \n\nc. \n\nSSR Strengths and Challenges \n\n38. \nOver 2008 and 2009, development partners have jointly conducted a series of technical, \npre-appraisal, and appraisal meetings to engage in policy dialogue with the Government on the \nSSR program and to appraise the program. This process was fruitful in developing a common \nunderstanding  of  the  program,  and  strengthening  the  program  design  through  discussions \namong technical experts and sharing of international best practices.  \n\nGovernment  and  stakeholder  ownership.  The  Government\u2019s  commitment \n\n39. \nto \nimplement  SSR  is  high.  It  has  shown  strong  ownership  in  the  development  of  SSR  and  has \nconsistently taken the lead in the process, largely drawing on internal resources and expertise. \nExternal expertise was selectively used in an advisory way on a demand basis. Broad in-country \nstakeholder consultation also provided useful feedback during SSR development. \n\n40. \nArticulate  vision.  The  SSR  key  documents  present  a  clear  indication  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s key reform plans. Besides the structural integration of basic 1\u20138 and secondary \n9\u201312, SSR correctly identifies and intends to address key systemic issues that affect the overall \neffectiveness of the system. SSR puts strong emphasis on improvement of quality and internal \nefficiency.  \n\nComprehensive sector plan. SSR expands the PBA to secondary education. It allows \n41. \nfor  an  integrated  and  holistic  approach  to  sector  issues;  and  stimulates comprehensive  sector \ndialogue  among  the  Government,  development  partners,  and  other  stakeholders  around  a \nsingle vision and plan. \n\nPrioritization and sequencing of reforms. The SSR core document, as a reflection of \n42. \nthe Government\u2019s vision of the education sector by 2015, entails a vast number of changes and \nreforms.  Subsequent  versions  of  the  SSR  plan  brought  about  the  realization  that  the  reform \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n \n\nagenda  needed  to  be  phased  to  meet  the  financial  and  resource  capacity  of  the  system.  This \nexercise  resulted  in  the  5-year  phased  SSR  implementation  plan  (para.  35).  From  FY2010 \nonward,  SSR  will  be  implemented  throughout  the  country,  focusing  on  the  integration  and \nconsolidation  of  basic  education  (grades  1\u20138),  completing  the  process  by  2012.  At  the  same \ntime, model building for secondary education (grades 9\u201312) and vocational education will start \nfrom  FY2010  and  continue  through  FY2013  and  beyond.  The  restructuring  of  secondary \neducation, including integration of grades 9\u201312 and the introduction of a vocational stream, will \nbe  initiated  across  the  country  from  FY2013  in  a  phased  manner,  and  is  expected  to  be \ncompleted by 2016. This implementation plan is consistent with and works toward the goals of \nthe broader vision as described in the SSR core document. The Government and development \npartners agreed that the SSR core document serves as a useful framework to identify additional \nstrategies and actions, in case additional resources become available for SSR implementation. \nFigure 1 summarizes the time frame and phasing of the SSR program. \n\nFigure 1: Time Frame and Phasing of the SSR Program\n\nCY2009 CY2010 CY2011\n\nCY2012\n\nCY2013 CY2014 CY2015\n\nCY2016\n\nFY2010\n\nFY2011\n\nFY2012\n\nFY2013\n\nFY2014\n\nFY2015\n\nFY2016\n\nSSR Implementation Year\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nSSR Phasing\n\nSSR Plan\n\nSSR Phase I: Basic Education \nRestructuring (1\u20138)\n\nSSR Phase II: Secondary Education \nRestructuring (9\u201312)\n\nSSR Plan\n\nCY = calendar year, FY = fiscal year, SSR = school sector reform.\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\n \n43. \nSector  financing  plan.  Multiple  stakeholders  contribute  to  financing  education.  While \nthe  main  financiers  include  MOE  and  development  partners,  a  substantial  part  of  the  cost  is \nborne  by  local  communities,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  other  ministries  (in \nparticular  the  Ministry  of  Local  Development),  and  parents.  About  12%  of  basic  education \nstudents  and  30%  of  secondary  students  in  Nepal  attend  private  schools,  also  referred  to  as \ninstitutional schools, to which the Government does not provide support. At this stage, the SSR \nfinancing plan encompasses the costs and available funds of MOE and development partners. \nA comprehensive sector financing strategy incorporating all stakeholders and contributors would \nfacilitate \nthe  development  of  strategic  partnerships  and  cost-sharing  strategies.  The \nGovernment intends to develop this strategy in the first phase of the SSR implementation period. \n\nInstitutional arrangements and governance reform. One of the main policy thrusts of \n44. \nthe EFA program has been decentralization. This involved decentralizing to SMCs management \nauthorities  such  as  hiring  of  community  teachers,  fixing  their  terms  of  employment,  mobilizing \nresources,  and  approving  and  executing  school  budgets.  This  has  created  an  enabling \nenvironment  for  MOE,  DOE,  and  DEO  to  focus  more  on  policy  making,  financing,  standard \nsetting, monitoring, and provision of technical support. During the EFA period, steps were also \ntaken  to  enhance  support  of  local  bodies  to  the  school  education  sector  by  strengthening  of \ndistrict  education  committees  and  village  education  committees,  and  assigning  significant \nresponsibilities to district education committees, including the authority to establish and manage \npre-primary and adult education, set priority for establishing schools in the district development \ncommittee,  and  make  recommendations  for  the  approval  and  dissolution  of  schools  in  the \ndistricts. \n\n45. \nSSR,  while  continuing  community  management  of  schools,  envisions  devolving  a \nnumber  of  governance  and  management  functions  of  MOE,  DOE  and  DEO  to  local \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\ngovernments  and  communities.  Governance  functions  relate  to  planning  and  allocation  of \nresources, location of schools, providing choice over formal and alternative schooling, setting up \nquality standards, and ensuring access to quality basic education for all children of school going \nage.  Management  functions  translate  policy  decisions  into  program  and  implementation \nstrategies. The goal is to develop a devolved education governance and management system.  \n\n46. \nHowever,  at  present  there  are  no  elected  representatives  in  the  local bodies,  and  they \nare unlikely to be in place for a few years. Local bodies are currently being administered by civil \nservants.  Moreover,  it  is  expected  that  the  transition  process  from  a  unitary  state  to  a  federal \nstate  will  involve  the  restructuring  of  local  bodies,  possibly  changing  the  number  of  tiers,  and \ntheir  geographical  jurisdiction  and  mandate.  As  a  result,  the  education  governance  and \naccountability mechanism envisaged in SSR can be redefined only at the later stage of program \nimplementation. Until then, the system will continue to operate under the prevailing governance \narrangements. \n\n47. \nFree secondary education. The Interim Constitution stipulates that education should be \nprovided free of charge up to secondary level. In accordance with this provision, SSR intends to \nmake  secondary  education  gradually  free.  However,  it  is  unclear  under  current  budget \nconstraints  how  this  goal  can  be  achieved.  Government  intervention,  in  particular  in  higher \nsecondary  education,  is limited,  and  free  provision  up  to  grade  12  would  have  significant  cost \nimplications.  A  transition  plan  for  secondary  education  restructuring  and  financing  will  be \ndeveloped  in  the  early  phase  of  SSR.  Careful  consideration  will  need  to  be  given  to  the \ndevelopment of partnerships with other financiers in view of their funding predictability.  \n\nD. \n\nADB Assistance and Lessons Learned \n\n1. \n\nPast and Ongoing ADB Assistance \n\n48. \nADB\u2019s  earlier  assistance  to  Nepal  consisted  of  a  number  of  projects.  At  the  primary \nschool level, ADB supported EFA through the Teacher Education Project,12 which provides pre-\nservice  and  in-service  primary  teacher  training.  At  the  secondary  school  level,  the  SESP,13 \nalthough designed as a project, was the result of extensive sector analysis and policy dialogue, \nand  is  built  on  a  shared  long-term  vision  for  secondary  education  reform  and  institutional \ndevelopment.  The  SESP  core  document  is  guided  by  the  Tenth  Plan.  The  complexity  of  the \ndisbursement  modalities  and  differences  in  accounting  procedures  used  by  ADB,  the \nGovernment of Denmark, and the Government of Nepal strengthened the rationale for ADB to \njoin  the  PBA  arrangement  through  the  ESP  cluster.  The  Skills  for  Employment  Project 14 is \nassisting the delivery of short-term training, particularly to women, Dalits, and the disadvantaged; \nstrengthening  the  capacity  to  facilitate  and  deliver  short-term  training;  and  helping  articulate  a \nnew  TEVT  policy.  Assistance  provided  by  other  development  partners  to  the  education  sector \ncan be found in the development coordination matrix (Appendix 4). \n\n2. \n\nThe Education Sector Program Cluster \n\n49. \nADB launched the ESP cluster in 2006 to support the preparation and implementation of \nSSR.  The  ESP  adopted  a  program  cluster  approach  to  phase  ADB  assistance.  Three \nsubprograms  were  envisioned  in  accordance  with  the  time  frame  and  progress  of  the  SSR \n\n                                                 \n12 ADB.  2001.

The ESP subprogram I,15 approved on 1 December 2006, supports \nthe  Nepal  EFA  program  (2004\u20132009)  for  basic  and  primary  education  (grades  1\u20135)  with  a \nprogram  loan  for  $30  million  from  FY2007  to  FY2009.  A  capacity  development  grant  of \n$2 million complements the ESP subprogram I to develop government stakeholders\u2019 capacity in \npolicy analysis, formulation, and coordination. It also supported the preparation of the SSR core \ndocument.  The  ESP  subprogram  II,16 approved  on  24  January  2008,  supports  the  preparation \nand  transition  to  SSR  from  FY2008  to  FY2011,  in  particular  a  model-building  exercise  of  the \nbasic  education  extension  to  grades  1\u20138  in  a  few  districts,  as  well  as  broad  capacity \ndevelopment for system readiness.  \n\n50. \nProgress  of  subprogram  I  (program  loan).  The  ESP  subprogram  I  provides  budget \nsupport  to  the  EFA  program,  which  is  pooled  with  funds  from  other  pooling  development \npartners, as well as from the Government. As such, the progress of subprogram I coincides with \nthe  progress  of  the  primary  education  subsector  and  of  the  EFA  program.  Outcome  and \nimplementation strategy progress are described in paras. 9-25. Subprogram I was released into \ntwo equal tranches of $15 million. The first tranche was released upon loan effectiveness. First \ntranche release conditions pertained to the endorsement of the EFA core document, preparation \nof the FY2007 ASIP and AWPB, and achievement of FY2006 performance targets. The second \ntranche  of  EFA  subprogram  I  had  three  conditions,  relating  to  (i)  the  performance  of  program \nimplementation in FY2007 in relation to the ASIP FY2007; (ii) the preparation of ASIP FY2009 \nby  MOE  and  its  endorsement  by  the  JFA  partners,  including  ADB;  and  (iii)  the  preparation  by \nMOE of an action plan with resource allocation on the implementation of the recommendations \nof the EFA midterm review. As these conditions were met, the second tranche was released on \n3 January 2009.  \n\nProgress of subprogram I (capacity development grant). The capacity development \n51. \ngrant  associated  with  ESP  subprogram  I  has  been  supporting  the  core  document  thematic \ngroup  works,  consultation  workshops,  teacher  workshops,  school  and  teacher  mapping,  and \ncapacity  development  of  MOE  policy  functions.  The  grant  enabled  support  and  preparatory \nworks  for  SSR  at  the  central,  regional,  and  district  levels.  Consultation  workshops,  capacity \ndevelopment programs and exposure visits, development of a policy compendium, and regular \ntechnical support were made available to the MOE core document team. The support resulted in \nthe  successful  preparation  of  the  SSR  core  document,  which  was  approved  by  the  Council  of \nMinisters in June 2008. The grant also facilitated decentralization of the examination system at \nthe  regional  and  district  level.  Support  to  the  examination  system  is  currently  ongoing,  with \nserver, computers, line printer, and examination software already in place in all five regions. The \nteacher and school mapping exercise is currently ongoing. MOE has recently approved a list of \n30  districts  to  be  covered  under  the  grant  and  a  team  within  MOE  has  been  constituted  to \noversee  school  and  teacher  mapping  activities.  The  mapping  exercise  will  provide  the \nnecessary inputs to the school restructuring exercise to be undertaken under SSR.  \n\nProgress  of  subprogram  II.  The  model  building  and  capacity  development  exercise, \n52. \npreparing for implementation of the SSR program, is being supported by ADB through the ESP \nsubprogram  II,  approved  on  24  January  2008.  Activities  in  the  three  model-building  districts \n(Rasuwa, Kapilvastu, and Dadeldhura) include stakeholder consultations on SSR strategies and \nimplementation  modalities,  workshops,  and  pilot  interventions.  A  series  of  workshops  was \norganized  among  central,  district,  local,  and  school  level  stakeholders  in  each  of  the  districts. \nThe  participants  of  the  workshops  prepared  an  action  plan  of  activities  being  implemented  to \n\n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2006.

The \ntranche release conditions were met by the time of consideration by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors.  \n\n54. \nProposed  subprogram  III.  As  the  EFA  program  (grades  1\u20135)  and  the  SESP  program \n(grades  6\u201310)  end  by  FY2009,  the  SSR  program  covering  grades  1\u201312  starts  from  FY2010 \nonward. The ESP subprogram III is therefore proposed to start in FY2010 to initiate support to \nthe  SSR  program.  In  particular,  subprogram  III,  which  will  run  from  FY2010\u2013FY2012,  is \nproposed  to  support  the  first  phase  of  SSR,  which  will  focus  on  the  implementation  of  basic \neducation restructuring, while model building activities will be initiated for secondary education \nand TEVT. The  proposed  ESP  subprogram  III  integrates  the  ongoing  assistance  provided  by \nADB  to  the  EFA  program  and  SESP  program,  and  extends  the  policy-oriented  program \napproach adopted under ESP subprograms I and II to the secondary education subsector. It will \nassist the Government in moving toward a holistic approach to school education. The evolution \nin  ADB\u2019s  assistance  from  a  project  approach  to  a  policy-oriented  program  approach  is  in  line \nwith  the  ADB\u2019s  education  sector  policy,18 which  emphasizes  the  changing  role  of  ADB  from  a \nproject financier to a development partner assisting in formulation of sector policies and capacity \ndevelopment. The proposed ESP subprogram III is also consistent with ADB\u2019s recent strategic \nstudy in education,19 which stresses the need to focus increasingly on subsectors beyond basic \neducation.  The  proposed  subprogram  is  in  line  with  the  current  Nepal  country  strategy  and \nprogram, 2005\u20132009,20 which emphasizes the role of ADB in supporting inclusive development \nas spelled out in the country\u2019s poverty reduction strategy paper embodied in the Tenth Plan. It is \nalso consistent with the draft Nepal country partnership strategy 2010\u20132014, which proposes a \ncontinuation of supporting inclusive social development by enhancing access to education.  \n\nTo continue support for the SSR program, which will continue until FY2016, further ADB \n55. \nassistance  may  be  considered  to  initiate  support  for  the  restructuring  of  secondary  education. \nFigure  2  describes  the  sequencing  of  ADB  assistance  and  the  subprograms  in  relation  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s education programs. \n\n                                                 \n17 A field visit to one of the model building districts was undertaken during the Appraisal Mission. \n18 ADB. 2002.

ADB\u2019s  adoption  of  the  PBA  significantly  improved  portfolio \nmanagement  and  fund  disbursements  in  the  education  sector  while  the  program  cluster \napproach  provided  continuity  and  timeliness  of  ADB  support.  The  Government  benefited  from \nthe EFA pooled funding arrangement, which substantially reduced the Government\u2019s workload \nin managing multiple development partner project systems and different reporting requirements, \nand resulted in strengthening the core functions of MOE. Cost-efficiency was likewise achieved \nthrough  the  use  of  the  government  system  and  through  greater  community  participation  in \neducation service delivery. \n\n57. \nAreas  for  improvement  identified  by  the  country  assistance  program  evaluation  include \nthe  need  to  improve  the  internal  efficiency  of  the  education  system  by  addressing  the  high \nprimary  education  repetition  rate  and  high  dropout  rate,  as  well  as  improving  quality.  An  area \nthat will also require attention is the need to strengthen the planning and predictability of capital \nbudgeting  to  address  the  growing  demand  for  classrooms  caused  by  the  rapid  growth  in \nenrollment  during  the  last  few  years.  The  unevenness  in  the  capacity  of  local  education \nauthorities and schools also remains a concern. Further, there is a need for greater functional \nclarity  and  an  accountability  mechanism  between  districts  and  schools  to  ensure  effective \neducation  service  provision  in  the  new  decentralized  context.  Establishment  of  the  EPC  and \nMOE\u2019s  commitment  to  implement  its  decentralization  policy  contributed  to  the  effectiveness  of \nthe  education  sector.  The  country  assistance  program  evaluation  recommended  that  ADB \ncontinue  using  the  PBA  and  continue  to  assist  the  Government  in  developing  and  expanding \nhigher quality, more accessible primary and secondary education. \n\n58. \nLessons  learned  from  the  implementation  of  EFA  include  (i)  the  importance  of  feasible \nimplementation  plans  for  the  implementation  of  legislative  and  policy  directives;  (ii)  the \nperceived significant impact of incentive schemes; (iii) the importance of the teaching\u2013learning \nprocess, and the fact that teacher training alone is not sufficient to enhance the process; (iv) the \nimportance of credibly monitoring quality; (v) the importance of ECED, nonformal education, and \nliteracy programs for improving access to schooling; (vi) the importance of bottom-up planning \nto  improve  conditions  at  the  school  level;  (vii)  the  effectiveness  of  developing  specific  action \nplans  to  address  fiduciary  matters;  and  (viii)  the  importance  of  continuous  monitoring  and \n\n                                                 \n21 ADB.  2009.

These lessons have been addressed in the following ways \nin  the  SSR  program  design  through  (i)  the  development  of  implementation  plans  and  action \nplans  for  timely  implementation  of  policy  directions,  and  their  inclusion  in  the  policy  matrix; \n(ii) the  continuation  and  improvement  of  scholarship  schemes;  (iii)  the  inclusion  of  teacher \nperformance management, deployment, and qualification upgrading aspects; (iv) the adoption of \nlearning assessments for grades 3, 5, and 8 of international standard; (v) the continuation and \nexpansion of ECED, nonformal education, and literacy programs under SSR; (vi) strengthening \nof the SIP process and focusing capacity development at the local level; (vii) the development \nand  inclusion  in  the  JFA  of  the  Governance  and  Accountability  Action  Plan  (GAAP);  and \n(viii) periodic  monitoring  and  evaluation  as  key  SSR  activities.  Further  lessons  from  SESP \nimplementation include the importance of government ownership and leadership for timely and \nsmooth  implementation,  and  the  effectiveness  of  scholarship  programs.  These  have  been \naddressed in SSR through support for government leadership in the development of SSR, with \nonly limited external inputs; and the continuation of scholarship programs at secondary level.  \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\n59. \nThe  expected  overall  impact  of  the  ESP  cluster  program,  including  the  ESP \nsubprogram   III,  is  enhanced  educational  attainment  and  livelihood  for  all  children,  particularly \ngirls and disadvantaged groups. The expected outcome of the ESP subprogram III is increased \naccess to and quality of school education, particularly basic education (grades 1\u20138), especially \nfor children from marginalized groups.  \n\nB. \n\nPolicy Actions and Outputs for Subprogram III \n\n60. \nThe  SSR  program  is  composed  of  several  components  encompassing  the  following \nsubsectors  and  crosscutting  areas:  (i)  basic  education;  (ii)  secondary  education;  (iii)  ECED; \n(iv) literacy  and  lifelong  learning;  (v)  TEVT;  (vi)  teacher  professional  development;  and \n(vii) capacity  development,  management,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Across  program \ncomponents, social inclusion and quality improvement are key objectives.  \n\n61. \nThe  program  design  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  1)  was  developed  by  the \nGovernment  in  close  collaboration  with  the  development  partners.  It  describes  the  impact, \noutcome,  and  outputs  of  the  5-year  SSR  implementation  plan  developed  by  the  Government \n(para. 35). As such, the design and monitoring framework spans a period that extends beyond \nthe duration of the ESP subprogram III. In view of the pool funding, in which ADB\u2019s resources \nare  aggregated  with  government  funding  and  funding  from  other  development  partners,  no \ndistinction can be made between the SSR design and monitoring framework and the framework \nfor  the  ESP  subprogram  III.  However,  each  of  the  sections  below  will  focus  on  the  policy  and \nstrategic implementation actions the Government intends to take over the ESP subprogram III \nperiod  (FY2010\u2013FY2012)  toward  achieving  the  intended  longer-term  outputs  and  outcome.  In \naddition,  the  sections  will  highlight  the  expected  mid-period  (FY2012)  target  values  for  the \nmonitoring indicators, which coincides with the end of the ESP subprogram III period. The ESP \nsubprogram III development policy letter and program policy matrix are in Appendix 5. \n\n1. \n\nBasic Education  \n\n62. \nBasic education will continue to be the main focus of the education sector in Nepal and \nthe  SSR  program.  Reforms  will  be  initiated  in  basic  education,  and  gradually  spread  to  other \nareas  of  SSR,  in  particular  secondary  education  and  TEVT.  Basic  education  comprises  about \n75% of the 5-year SSR budget. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n \n\nRecognizing that 5 years of basic education is insufficient, one key policy change is the \n63. \nextension of basic education up to grade 8. Changes in the legislative provisions will be made to \nextend basic education formally up to grade 8. In conjunction with this, basic education schools \nwill  be  encouraged  to  restructure  into  three  substructures  to  rationalize  the  school  structure: \nfoundation  schools  with  grades  1\u20133,  primary  schools  with  grades  1\u20135,  and  upper  primary \nschools with grades 1\u20138. Norms and procedures for school restructuring have been developed. \nLocal  governments  will  develop  their  own  norms  and  criteria  to  restructure  existing  schools  in \nline with the national norms.  \n\nTo  reach  the  8%  of  the  current  school  age  population  in  primary  education  (age  5\u20139) \n64. \nand about 25% in basic education (age 5\u201312) that are still out of school, SSR will extend free22 \nbasic education to all children of corresponding age up to grade 8. The Government will develop \na phased plan to make free basic education compulsory. With the extension of benefits from the \ncurrent  grade  1\u20135  system  to  grade  1\u20138  coverage,  and  the  introduction  of  an  integrated \ncurriculum  up  to  grade  8,  more  students  are  expected  to  complete  a  cycle  of  8  years  of \neducation, whereas they might leave school after grade 5 in the current system. This will result \nin a higher average number of schooling years for children in Nepal, leading to higher average \nqualifications and better future earning potential. \n\n65. \nIn line with the key objective of social inclusion, SSR emphasizes the need to improve \naccess  to  education  for  girls  and  disadvantaged  groups  such  as  Dalit,  Madhesis, 23  and \nmountain  communities.  Despite  substantial  achievements  made  under  EFA,  children  from \nvulnerable  groups  are  overrepresented  in  the  out-of-school  population  and  remain  a  hard-to-\nreach group for reasons related to social distance as well as physical distance to the schools. \nPolicies and strategies for enhanced social inclusion and a range of actions, including inclusive \neducation  and  affirmative  action,  have  been  adopted  in  the  program.  These  include  financial \nand pedagogical support and incentive schemes targeted to schools as well as financial and in-\nkind  support  to  families  and  children.  Free  alternative  programs  will  be  provided  for  students \nwho  cannot  attend  formal  schools.  Special  provisions  will  be  made  to  cater  to  the  needs  of \npublic  school  students  in  Karnali  Zone,  one  of  the  poorest  areas  in  the  country.  SSR  also \nprovides for the recognition and support of caste and cultural education sources like Gumbas, \nVihar,  Madarsas,  and  Gurukul,  which  will  contribute  to  the  education  of  children  not  attending \nmainstream  education.  Norms  and  guidelines  that  define  the  various  types  of  formal  and \nnonformal basic education services have been developed.  \n\n66. \nTo  enhance  the  quality  of  education,  SSR  has  defined  minimum  enabling  conditions \n(MECs) that all basic education schools should attain. MECs encompass an adequate physical \nand  educational  environment,  curriculum  and  textbooks,  and  the  instructional  provision.  The \nrationale is that until schools have the minimum physical environment, educational environment, \ninstructional  provisions,  and  curriculum  and  textbooks,  it  is  not  realistic  to  expect  measurable \nimprovements  in  learning  outcomes  and  quality.  The  primary  mechanism  for  meeting  MECs \nover  time  is  the  SIP.  Schools  will  be  responsible  for  developing  the  SIP  with  the  objective  of \nreaching the MECs. Earmarked grants and direct provision of inputs by the central Government \nwill  contribute  the  necessary  resources  for  schools  to  achieve  the  MECs.  This  mechanism  is \nexpected  to  strengthen  the  link  between  local  and  central  level  planning.  Implementation \nguidelines for MECs will be developed prior to program effectiveness. Support and sanctioning \nmechanisms  will  be  developed,  depending  on  the  reason  for  schools  not  meeting  MECs.  If \nexternal circumstances cause the failure to reach MECs, school may receive extra funds. If it is \n\n                                                 \n22  Free  basic  education  provisions  include  cost-free  services  for  admission,  textbooks,  tuition,  and  examinations.  In \naddition, the Government will continue to rely on community contributions for various aspects of schooling, such as \nschool construction. \n\n23  Traditional inhabitants of the lowlands (Terai). \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\nthe school\u2019s failure to provide adequate services, the school personnel may be given adequate \nguidance  or  be  sanctioned.  The  system  of  MECs  recognizes  the  shared  responsibility  among \ngovernment,  communities,  and  schools  toward  a  common  goal  of  providing  quality  education \nand achieving desired outcomes.  \n\nSSR  further  intends  to  (i)  develop  competency-based  curricula  for  grades  1\u201312,  local \n67. \ncontent  curricula,  mother  tongue  materials  and  instruction  for  early  grades,  learner-focused \nteacher development programs, textbook provision for all subjects and grades, and multigrade \nteaching for basic levels where appropriate; and (ii) link teacher career development to teacher \nperformance through an accountability structure that includes community monitoring.  \n\n68. \nTeachers  will  be  trained  in  new  student-centered  learning  methods  and  continuous \nassessment will be introduced. Minimum teacher qualifications for basic education will be raised \nfrom secondary education to higher secondary education, and separate head-teacher positions \nwill be created. Sample-based, national assessments at grades 3, 5, and 8 as well as end-of-\nlevel  standardized  high  stakes  examinations  at  grade  8  will  be  introduced  to  monitor  quality \nimprovements.  To  implement  the  examinations,  the  establishment  of  a  National  Examination \nBoard (NEB) will be prepared.  \n\n69. \nNational  standards  for  education  service  delivery  will  be  developed.  An  Education \nReview Office will be established at central level for conducting external audits of agencies at \ndifferent  levels  based  on  these  norms  and  standards.  Once  approved,  the  national  standards \nbecome  the  basis  for  curriculum  development,  teacher  training,  teacher  management, \nexaminations, school operations management, and school finance. \n\n70. \nThe  reforms  in  basic  education  are  expected  to  enhance  equitable  access  to  quality \nbasic  education.  Improved  quality  education  is  expected  to  contribute  to  lower  dropout  and \nrepetition rates, which will enhance the efficiency of the education system. By 2012, the reforms \nin basic education are expected to achieve the following key results: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\n2. \n\nThe  net  intake  rate  (excluding  repeaters)  in  grade  1  will  improve  from  81%  in \n2008 to 88% in 2012. \nThe net enrollment rate for basic education (grades 1\u20138) will improve from 73% \nin 2008 to 80% in 2012. \nThe survival rate up to grade 8 will improve from 41% in 2008 to 54% in 2012. \nThe Gender Parity Index will improve from 0.97 in 2008 to 0.98 in 2012. \nThe repetition rate in grade 1 will be reduced from 28% in 2008 to 5% in 2014. \n\nSecondary Education \n\n71. \nBuilding  on  the  lessons  identified  from  the  SESP,  the  Government  has  expanded  the \nprogrammatic  and  holistic  subsector  approach  adopted  under  EFA  to  secondary  education. \nSSR  aims  to  improve  the  access,  equity,  quality,  and  relevance  of  secondary  education.  The \ntargets include an increased NER from 21% in 2008 to 24% in 2012 alongside improvements in \ngender equity and access for marginalized groups. The grade 12 HSLC pass rate is targeted to \nimprove from 25% in 2008 to 34% in 2012 as a fraction of student entrants. Key interventions to \nenhance  access  and  equity  include  the  continuation  of  SESP  scholarship  schemes  to  ensure \naccess  to  and  completion  of  secondary  education  for  girls,  Dalits,  marginalized  groups,  the \ndisabled, and children from poor households. Access will also be enhanced through expansion \nof  physical  facilities,  including  classroom  construction  and  rehabilitation,  library  and  laboratory \nconstruction,  and  the  construction  of  schools  for  children  with  special  needs.  To  enhance \naccess  to  secondary  education  further,  the  policy  intent  under  SSR  is  to  make  secondary \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n \n\neducation gradually free24 by 2015. In view of budget constraints, the Government will explore \npartnerships with private providers and will initiate the development of a comprehensive sector \nfinancing plan.  \n\n72. \nNorms and guidelines to enhance quality for secondary education provision are yet to be \ndeveloped. During the early years of SSR implementation, the program will focus on standard \nsetting  for  secondary  education  provision,  including  teacher  standards,  curriculum  standards, \nand  standards  for  educational  environment.  The  SESP  identified  a  relevant  curriculum, \neducation materials and equipment, and linking teachers\u2019 skills to curriculum needs, as crucial \nfactors  for  quality  secondary  education\u2014underscoring  the  importance  of  setting  norms  and \nstandards.  \n\n73. \nRecognizing  the  current  fragmented  structure  of  secondary  education,  pilot  testing  for \nthe  structural  integration  of  secondary  (grades  9\u201310)  and  higher  secondary  (grades  11\u201312) \neducation will be conducted between the start of the program and 2012, prior to the full-fledged \nintegration  of  secondary  education.  A  quality  improvement  system  based  on  MECs  will  be \ndeveloped for implementation from 2013 onward.  \n\n74. \nSubsequent to the examination reform in grade 8, examination reform is envisioned from \n2013  onward  for  secondary  education.  Examinations  will  be  held  at  three  levels:  district, \nregional,  and  national.  District  level  examinations  will  be  conducted  at  the  end  of  grade  eight, \nand will be administered by the DEO under NEB guidelines. Regional level examinations will be \nconducted  at  the  end  of  grade  10  and  will  be  administered  by  the  Regional  Education \nDirectorate under the NEB. National level examination for HSLC will be conducted at the end of \ngrade 12  and  will  be  administered  by  the  NEB.  Two  kinds  of  certificates  will  be  provided  at \nsecondary level: (i) SLC after grade 10, and (ii) HSLC after grade 12.  \n\n3. \n\nEarly Childhood Education and Development  \n\n75. \nSSR  is  expanding  the  ECED  system  on  the  basis  that  grade  1  children  with  ECED \nexperience  have  lower  dropout  rates,  higher  completion  rates,  and  are  better  prepared \ncognitively  and  socially  for  school.  The  expected  output  for  ECED  is  an  expanded  network  of \nECED services both in coverage and quality, providing access to at least 1 year of basic ECED \nservices.  The  target  under  the  SSR  is  to  increase  the  percentage  of  new  entrants  at  grade  1 \nwith ECED experience from 36% in 2008 to 51% in 2012.   \n\n76. \nThe  main  challenges  the  ECED  system  currently  faces  include  (i)  expanding  ECED  to \nrural areas, as the expansion has so far largely been limited to well-off areas and urban centers; \n(ii) recruiting  and  retaining  qualified,  competent  facilitators  given  that  inadequate  budgets  are \nleading  to  high  staff  turnover;  (iii)  focusing  ECED  on  holistic  child  development,  including \nlinkages  with  health  and  nutrition,  since  creative  aspects  of  child  development  tend  to  be \ncrowded  out  by  academic  and  school-preparatory  curricula;  and  (iv)  coordination  and \nmanagement  of  different  ECED  modalities,  as  some  ECED  centers  are  school-based,  others \nare community-based centers, and those in the urban centers are largely privately run. \n\n77. \nTo  facilitate  this  expansion  and  enhancement  of  ECED  services,  the  Government  will \nfollow  a  partnership  modality,  whereby  it  will  develop  norms,  standards,  and  operational \nguidelines  and  will  provide  technical  backstopping  services  through  resource  persons  in  the \nDEOs. An  ECED focal point will be appointed in each district to carry out ECED  coordination, \nplanning,  and  development \nfor  creating  demand, \nimplementing and ensuring quality standards, and managing ECED centers will lie with the local \n\nfunctions.  The  main \n\nresponsibility \n\n                                                 \n24 Free secondary education will include at least free services of admission and tuition fees. Textbooks and curricular \n\nmaterials will be made available at a subsidized rate. \n\n \n\n\f19 \n\ngovernment  where  civil  society  organizations  will  play  a  critical  role  in  engaging  the  local \ncommunity. \n\n78. \nTo enhance access in underserved areas, emphasis will be placed on expanding ECED \nservices in disadvantaged and underserved areas. Funds will be provided for the establishment, \noperation, and sustenance of ECED centers in the marginalized areas and poverty pockets. In \nview  of  budget  constraints,  partnership  arrangements  with  NGOs,  cooperatives,  national  and \nlocal level institutes, and civil society organizations will be established for the financing of ECED.  \n\nTo  focus  on  the  holistic  development  of  children,  and  streamline  the  operational \n79. \nmodalities, \nthe  community-based  ECED  approach  will  be  promoted.  A  child-friendly \nenvironment in ECED centers will be developed. Children\u2019s mother tongues will be employed as \nthe  medium  of  instruction.  ECED  facilitators  will  be  recruited  locally,  ensuring  that  they \nrepresent the cultures and languages of children\u2019s family and community. The ECED curriculum \nwill draw on local content and knowledge systems. \n\n4. \n\nLiteracy and Lifelong Learning \n\nLiteracy  activities  under  SSR  are  complementary  to  the  recently  launched  National \n80. \nLiteracy Campaign aimed at attaining the EFA goals and MDGs. The need is evident since only \n72%  of  Nepal\u2019s  population  of  19  million  people  above  6  years  of  age  is  literate.  The  average \n15+  literacy  level  is  63%.  The  Gender  Parity  Index  for  the  15+  age  group  is  only  0.84.  SSR \nseeks  to  increase  these  figures  to  83%  (6+  literacy),  67%  (15+  literacy),  and  0.95  (Gender \nParity Index) by 2012.  \n\n81. \nLiteracy and post-literacy programs are expected to be a part of all Village Development \nPlans  by  the  end  of  the  program,  contributing  to  comprehensive  literacy  and  basic \ncompetencies that impart skills to improve the quality of life. They will target specific groups and \nareas  including  women,  marginalized  populations,  Dalits,  endangered  communities,  internally \ndisplaced  people,  people  with  disability,  and  people  living  with  HIV/AIDS.  As  with  ECED, \nemphasis will be placed on decentralization and partnerships with the private sector and NGOs \nto  achieve  goals  of  adult  literacy  and  continuing  education.  Lifelong  learning  or  continuing \neducation interventions will be provided by linking to the formal education system and through \nlocally managed arrangements at community learning centers. \n\n5. \n\nTechnical Education and Vocational Training \n\n82. \nAs  in  many  other  countries,  Nepal  has  many  dropouts  and  school-leavers  who  are \nunequipped  with  the  necessary  skills  to  enter  the  labor  market.  SSR  proposes  to  equip \nschoolchildren  with  skills  for  future  employment.  Integrating  skill  development  into  general \neducation  is,  however,  not  without  risk.  International  and  regional  experience  shows  that \ndeveloping  technical  streams  in  general  education  generally  results  in  supply-driven,  inflexible \nsystems in which schools are unable to provide and maintain the relevant equipment and where \nteachers with practical skills prove hard to recruit and retain.  \n\n83. \nIn view of these experiences, the core of TEVT activities, which aim to secure immediate \nemployment  for  school-leavers,  will  remain  with  the  specialized  technical  institutes  outside  of \nthe  SSR  program.  The  school-based  TEVT  program  proposed  under  SSR  will  focus  on \ndeveloping  generic  skills  to  prepare  schoolchildren  for  future  employability.  TEVT  activities \nunder SSR will focus on piloting several options in the initial years. These may include (i) crafts \nand skills in school classes for grade 7 and 8 students using skilled crafters and tradespeople \nfrom  the  community;  (ii)  nonformal  apprenticeship  in  grades  9  and  10  using  private  sector \ntraining  managers;  and  (iii)  three  learning  tracks  (Science  and  Technology,  Business  and \nCommerce,  and  Liberal  Arts)  in  grades  11  and  12  leading  to  the  same  university  accepted \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n \n\ncredits on graduation. Soft employability skills required by enterprise for employment will be part \nof all three curricula.  \n\n84. \nTEVT  activities  under  SSR  will  complement  ongoing  interventions  in  TEVT,  such  as \nADB\u2019s  Skills  for  Employment  Project  and  CTEVT\u2019s  various  technical  and  vocational  training \nprograms. While the Skills for Employment Project and CTEVT focus on the provision of market-\noriented short-term skills training, SSR aims at strengthening the role of school education in the \nprovision  of  soft  skills  for  future  employability.  TEVT  activities  are  expected  to  result  in  an \nincreased understanding of the role of general education in skills development and will result in \nconcrete models for implementation. A phased implementation plan is expected to be approved, \nincorporating the experiences of pilot initiatives in participating schools. \n\n6. \n\nTeacher Professional Development \n\nSSR lays particular emphasis on teacher development at basic and secondary levels of \n85. \neducation.  Only  66%  of  primary  teachers  and  77%  of  secondary  teachers  possess  the  basic \nrequired levels of qualification and training, and 9% do not have the required certification. These \nfigures  would  have  been  considerably  lower  had  it  not  been  for  the  ADB-supported  Teacher \nEducation Project, which closed in July 2009. The teacher development component under SSR \nexpands  teacher  development  to  basic  and  secondary  education.  Recognizing  that  training \nteachers is a necessary but not sufficient condition to improve learning outcomes, it provides an \nintegrated approach to teacher development, addressing the related issues of qualification and \ncareer  development\u2014thereby  addressing  teacher  motivational  issues.  The  aim  of  the  teacher \ndevelopment component is to enhance qualifications and professional competencies of teachers \nin  basic  and  secondary  education  to  facilitate  student  learning  processes  effectively.  It  further \naims  at  improving  teacher  competency  and  performance  to  enhance  students\u2019  learning \nprocesses.  The  existing  teacher  training  policy  will  be  revised  to  include  provisions  on \nqualification upgrading, career development, and in-service professional support. Revisions will \nnot only address inadequacies in terms of qualifications and competency, but also motivational \nand career aspects of the teaching profession. \n\n86. \nTo  enhance  the  quality  of  teachers,  teacher  licensing  practices  will  be  enhanced. \nTeachers  will  be  recruited  at  the  local  level  from  among  the  licensees  in  accordance  with  the \nguidelines  provided  by  the  central  level.  MOE  will  conduct  a  needs  assessment  and  costing, \nand will develop a time-bound action plan on upgrading the minimum qualifications for teachers. \nHigher  secondary  education  will  be  required  for  teaching  basic  education,  and  a  master\u2019s \ndegree in education or other disciplines with a relevant teacher preparation course for teaching \nsecondary  level.  Serving  teachers  with  a  qualification  of  SLC  or  below  will  have  the  following \noptions:  (i)  teaching  lower  grades  such  as  1\u20133  grades  until  retirement,  (ii)  upgrading  their \nqualification  to  the  minimum  level  in  5  years,  for  which  the  National  Center  for  Educational \nDevelopment will work with the academic institutions to offer courses to upgrade the teacher\u2019s \nminimum  qualification,  or  (iii)  opt  for  voluntary  retirement,  in  which  case  DOE  will  develop  a \nvoluntary  retirement  package.  For  option  (ii),  it  is  expected  that  the  cost  of  the  training  will  be \nborne by the teacher, to be offset against higher anticipated earnings. Tailor-made courses will \nbe  developed  so  that  teachers  can  continue  to  teach  while  upgrading  their  qualifications.  An \narrangement has already been reached with the Higher Secondary Education Board and DOE \nto  accredit  pre-service  and  in-service  teacher  training  and  link  with  their  regular  education \ncourses. \n\n87. \nTo enhance career prospects and motivation, two separate professional career paths will \nbe offered to basic and secondary teachers. There will be four stages (beginner, experienced, \nmaster,  and  expert)  for  both  basic  and  secondary  level  teachers.  Provisions  will  be  made  to \n\n \n\n\f21 \n\nupgrade teachers based on indicators such as time on task, seniority, qualification, training, and \nstudents\u2019 achievement in their respective career paths. \n\n88. \nSSR will also address certain aspects of teacher recruitment and deployment. Additional \nteachers will be recruited through per capita funding25 to reduce pupil\u2013teacher ratios gradually in \nan effort to reduce class sizes and overcrowding. Furthermore, teacher positions in overstaffed \nschools  will  not  be  refilled  and  will  be  reallocated  to  overcrowded  schools.  SSR  will  also \ncontinue the recruitment of relief teachers (Rahat Darvandhi). \n\nSocial  inclusion  within  the  teacher  profession  is  also  a  key  priority.  Policies  and \n89. \nprograms have been developed promoting the recruitment of female teachers at different levels \nsuch  as  ECED  centers,  basic  education,  and  secondary  education.  These  include  special \nprovisions  for  females  entering  the  teaching  profession  such  as  provisions  for  maternity  and \npaternity leave, infant feeding breaks, and provision for substitute teachers. At secondary level, \nthe plan seeks to increase the proportion of female teachers to 25% (from the current 13%) and \nthe  proportion  of  female  head-teachers  to  10%.  The  number  of  teachers  from  disadvantaged \ngroups will be increased by such measures as weighting criteria for teacher and management \nselection in favor of candidates from these groups. This will require a particular effort and policy \nchanges under SSR. \n\n90. \n\nTeacher development activities are expected to achieve the following results by 2012: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  percentage  of  certified  teachers  will  increase  from  91%  (2008)  to  95%  for \nbasic and secondary education; and \nthe  percentage  of  teachers  with  the  required  qualification  will  rise  from  66% \n(2008)  to  79%  for  basic  education  and  from  77%  (2008)  to  86%  for  secondary \neducation.  \n\n7. \n\nCapacity Development, Management, and Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n91. \nTo deliver the education services as envisioned under SSR, capacity development both \nat  the  institutional  level  and  organizational  level  are  required.  The  Government  is  finalizing  a \ncomprehensive  capacity  development  plan  and  aligning \nit  with  SSR  activities  and \nresponsibilities.  Capacity  development  efforts  under  SSR  will  focus  more  on  local  level \ndevelopment of capacity than under EFA. This is in line with increased decentralized planning \nand  management.  Capacity  development  of  schools  will  be  linked  to  achieving  the  minimum \nenabling  conditions.  Low  performing  schools  will  be  identified  and  assisted  in  the  preparation \nand  implementation  of  quality  improvement  plans.  Capacity  development  will  be  supported  by \nmore than 1,000 cluster resource centers that have been established throughout the country. \n\n92. \nSystem-level capacity to deliver education services will be enhanced through increased \ninvolvement  of  communities  in  the  management  of  schools.  This  presents  a  continuation  of \nactivities  initiated  under  EFA.  The  number  of  schools  transferred  to  local  communities  will  be \nincreased  under  SSR.  Capacity  development  will  also  be  focused  on  enhancing  the \nmanagement  capacity  of  SMCs.  The  EFA  evaluation  study  (footnote  4)  found  that  not  all \ncommunities are ready to take on management of schools.  \n\n93. \nThe SIP is another tool that has been introduced under EFA to develop capacity at the \nlocal  level  to  plan  and  manage  school  operations.  All  schools  are  expected  to  prepare  a  SIP \nannually  as  a  mandatory  requirement  for  release  of  the  funds  that  will  provide  textbooks  and \nother resources. The EFA evaluation study found that, while SIPs are prepared by almost all the \n\n                                                 \n25 Per  capita  funding  of  salaries  is  a  student  enrollment-based  funding  (as  opposed  to  teacher-based  funding).  Per \ncapita  funding  was  introduced  in  Nepal  in  2007  in  an  effort  to  enhance  quality  and  efficiency  through  increased \nschool choice (for children), competition among schools, and efficient teacher deployment. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n \n\nschools,  their  use  for  planning  and  budgeting  is  very  limited.  Under  SSR,  the  Government \nintends to strengthen the use of SIPs; and linkages between the SIPs, village education plans, \ndistrict education plans, and the ASIP will be strengthened. The allocation of funds to schools \nwill  be  based  on  the  SIP.  In  addition,  social  audits  will  be  made  compulsory  for  all  schools  to \nreceive funds in the next fiscal year. \n\n94. \nProgram management aims to ensure timely and inclusive delivery of education services \nand  products.  It  aims  at  improving  a  number  of  areas  that  have  been  identified  as  crucial  for \nsmooth  and  timely  operation  of  the  school  system  and  achievement  of  SSR  goals.  These \ninclude the timely delivery of textbooks, and the timely disbursement of scholarships to students \nand salaries to teachers. These form part of the GAAP within the JFA. Key targets include (i) an \nincrease in the percentage of students receiving textbooks within 2 weeks of the school session, \n(ii) an increase in those receiving scholarships of different categories within these 2 weeks, and \n(iii) a reduction in the number of weeks delay in providing salary payment to teachers. \n\n95. \nIn  view  of  the  multiple  changes  being  introduced  under  SSR,  careful  monitoring, \nevaluation,  and  appropriate  feedback  mechanisms  are  important  to  identify  what  works,  and \ncorrect  what  does  not  work.  In  addition  to  the  regular  reports  that  have  been  produced  under \nEFA  (including  status  reports,  flash  reports,  FMRs),  the  Government  is  introducing  periodic \nstudents\u2019  assessments  to  monitor  progress  in  quality  of  education,  client  satisfaction  surveys, \nand  regular  program  evaluations.  During  the  program  period,  two  rigorous  sample-based \nlearning  assessments  at  grades  3,  5,  and  8\u2014undertaken  in  partnership  with  a  specialized \ninternational  testing  agency  or  firm\u2014and  two  comprehensive  impact  evaluation  studies  will  be \ncarried  out.  The  Education  Review  Office  will  be  tasked  with  conducting  external  audits  of \nagencies at different levels and will report to the EPC.  \n\nC. \n\nImportant Features \n\n96. \nDevelopment partner harmonization through program-based approach. SSR builds \non  and  strengthens  the  PBA  initiated  under  EFA,  which  involves  full  development  partner \nharmonization.  The  majority  of  development  partners  pool  their  funding  for  the  single  sector \npolicy and expenditure program through a JFA. Over time, the number of development partners \ncontributing  through  the  pooled  funding  arrangement  has  increased  from  5  in  2004  to  9  in \n2008.26 In addition, a number of other development partners provide parallel cofinancing to the \nsame  program  outside  the  pool  arrangement. 27  Development  partners  largely  rely  on\u2014and \nhence  provide  the  mechanism  for  strengthening  of\u2014country  systems  and  in-country  regular \nmechanisms  for  program  reporting,  budgeting,  financial  management,  and  procurement. \nReporting requirements are fully harmonized among development partners. The PBA was also \nfully  applied  in  the  preparation  process  for  SSR.  Development  partners  only  conducted  joint \npreparation  and  appraisal  missions.  Based  on  ADB\u2019s  concept  of  the  program  policy  matrix, \ndevelopment partners developed a joint broad policy matrix to track progress on key policy and \nstrategic actions necessary for program implementation. Development partners providing policy-\nbased  support\u2014including  ADB,  the  Department  for  International  Development  (DFID)  of  the \nUnited Kingdom, and the European Commission\u2014committed to select only policy actions from \nthis broader policy matrix as tranche release conditions. The PBA consortium in Nepal is also \nunique in the sense that no single development partner takes a lead role. The function of donor \nfocal  point,  which  coordinates  in  communication  with  the  Government  and  serves  as  a \nspokesperson for the development partners, rotates among pooling partners on an annual basis. \n                                                 \n26 As  of  FY2008,  JFA  pooling  partners  are  ADB,  Australia,  Denmark,  the  European  Commission,  Finland,  Norway, \n\nthe United Kingdom, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), and the World Bank.  \n\n27 The non-JFA partners who are part of the PBA through parallel financing are the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency;  the  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization;  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational Development; and the World Food Programme. \n\n \n\n\f23 \n\nThis  system  has  helped  to  strengthen  government  leadership  and  has  established  a  collegial \nrelationship among the partners. \n\n97. \nADB support through program cluster approach. The ESP uses the program cluster \napproach to support the SSR program. The program cluster approach provides a flexible way of \nsupporting the Government\u2019s complex phased reform plan. Recognizing that reform is a phased \nand  cumulative  process,  the  program  cluster  allows  for  timed  and  gradual  support  to  the \nmultiple  phases  of  the  SSR  program.  It  also  provides  a  certain  level  of  predictability  to  the \nGovernment of ADB\u2019s intended support. \n\n98. \nAllocated budget support. The ESP uses the program lending modality adjusted to the \nprogram-based approach features specific to the SSR program. ADB\u2019s contributions to the SSR \nprogram  are  released  in  two  stages.  In  the  first stage,  ADB program  tranches  are  released  to \nthe  government  foreign  currency  account  upon  fulfillment of  tranche  release  conditions.  In  the \nsecond  stage,  funds  are  committed  and  disbursed  to  the  actual  SSR  program.  Funds  are \ncommitted by development partners on an annual basis before the beginning of each fiscal year, \nthrough the review of an annual rolling plan, the ASIP, and the AWPB. Funds are then released \non a trimester basis upon submission by the Government of a trimester FMR. As such, release \nof  the  funds  by  the  development  partners  for  the  next  year\u2019s  activities  is  contingent  upon \nsatisfactory progress on outcome and process performance indicators during the previous year.  \n\nD. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n99. \nThe  SSR  program  cost  is  estimated  at  $2.6  billion  for  the  first  5  years  of  the  SSR \nprogram period.28 The SSR program cost includes all regular recurrent and investment costs for \noperating  the  subsectors  covered  under  the  SSR  program,  as  well  as  the  additional  costs \nassociated with the SSR reform. The currently projected available funding over the same period \nis  estimated  at  $2.3  billion,  excluding  ADB\u2019s  proposed  assistance.  This amount  is  based  on  a \nprojection of macroeconomic growth, the government budget and revenue generation, the share \nof the education budget in the total budget, and tentative development partners\u2019 contributions. \nThe projection has accounted for current macroeconomic conditions and is based on projections \nof historic trends of government financing of the education sector.  \n\n100. \nIt  is  proposed  that  under  subprogram  III,  a  grant  of  $70  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds  resources  and  a  loan  equivalent  to  $25  million  in  special  drawing  rights  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources will be provided. The loan will have an amortization period of 24 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1% per year during the grace period and \n1.5% thereafter. The terms and conditions for the grant and the loan will be as set forth in the \nFinancing Agreement. The program support amounts are determined by factors including (i) the \nimportance of SSR in the education sector in Nepal; (ii) ADB\u2019s overall lending program to Nepal; \n(iii) the availability of alternative sources of financing; and (iv) the financing gap, which impedes \nachievement of the SSR goals. The grant and loan amounts meet part of the financing gap. The \nproposed  increase  in  program  cluster  amount  would  accommodate  the  increased  amount  for \nsubprogram III from $25 million to $95 million. Table 2 presents the SSR financing plan.  \n\n101.  The Government has assured that education remains a priority sector and that sufficient \nbudget will continue to flow to the education sector during the macroeconomic downturn. In the \nevent  that  additional  resources  cannot  be  identified  to  bridge  the  financing  gap,  further \nprioritization of the SSR implementation plan in light of the existing funding gap may be required \nat  the  annual  programming  stage.  In  addition,  the  Government  has  committed  to  the \ndevelopment of a comprehensive and strategic sector financing plan. Appendix 6 contains more \ndetails of the financial analysis.  \n\n                                                 \n28 The corresponding cost over the 7-year program period is $4.1 billion. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan, FY2010\u2013FY2014 \n($ million) \n\nExpenditures and Financing \nSSR Expenditures \nFinancing Sources \nGovernment Budget Allocation \nAsian Development Bank  \nOther Development Partners\u2019 Assistance  \nTotala \nFinancing Gap \nFY = fiscal year, SSR = school sector reform. \na  Contributions  from  non-pooling  partners  and  tentative   \nthe  SSR  program  would \n\nAmount\n \n2,626.0   \n  \n \n1,864.0\n \n95.0\n393.4\n \n2,352.4   \n \n273.6\n\n further  ADB  support \n contribute to further narrowing the financing gap.  \n\nto \n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n102.  Program management. MOE is the Executing Agency and the DOE is the Implementing \nAgency. The ESP subprogram III will follow the program management arrangements specified in \nthe revised JFA for SSR. The JFA details the goals of the SSR program; the responsibilities of the \nGovernment and the development partners; the funding mechanism; and fiduciary requirements, \nincluding procurement, reporting, monitoring and auditing, and other administrative requirements. \nThe JFA development partners meet regularly to review the financial and operational status and \nprogress of SSR, and to commit and disburse funds. The SSR JFA has adopted the provisions of \nthe EFA JFA, while the following areas have been strengthened: (i) an enhanced monitoring and \nevaluation function with the development of regular evaluations; (ii) a biannual fiduciary review of \nthe program, covering financial management and procurement, conducted by the World Bank on \nbehalf  of  the  pooling  partners;  (iii)  a  biannual  performance  audit  performed  by  the  Office  of  the \nAuditor General (OAG); and (iv) inclusion of a GAAP.  \n\n103. \nImplementation  period.  The  ESP  subprogram  III  will  support  the  SSR  program  from \nFY2010 to FY2012. The program period will be from August 2009 to July 2012. It is expected \nthat program completion will be in July 2012 and the closing date will be December 2012.  \n\n104.  Disbursement, procurement, and recruitment. The proceeds of the grant and loan will \nbe disbursed to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) as the recipient in accordance with the provisions \nof  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program \nLoans.29 The  grant  and  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs \n(excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries, \nexcluding  ineligible items  (Appendix  7)  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral \nsources. No supporting import documentation will be required if, during each year that grant and \nloan  proceeds  are  expected  to  be  disbursed,  the  value  of  total  imports  minus  imports  from \nnonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development \nassistance,  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  the  amount  of  the  grant  and  loan  expected  to  be \ndisbursed during such year. The Government will certify its compliance with this formula with its \nwithdrawal request.  \n\n105.  The  pooled  foreign  currency  account  (FCA)  in  the  name  of  the  Government  of  Nepal \nestablished at the Nepal Rastra Bank under the SSR JFA will function as the deposit account \ninto  which  all  withdrawals  from  the  grant  and  loan  account  will  be  deposited.  The  deposit \naccount will be established, managed, and liquidated in accordance with terms and conditions \n\n                                                 \n29 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f25 \n\nsatisfactory to ADB. Under the SSR JFA, the JFA development partners have agreed to use the \nexisting  government  system  for  disbursement  and  accounting  of  pooled  government  and \ndevelopment  partner  funds.  MOE  will  use  the  Government\u2019s  reporting  system  to  submit  the \nFMR to the pooled development partners each trimester. Replenishment of the funds from the \nFCA  will  be  based  on  the  timely  and  accurate  submission  of  the  FMR.  Program  funds  will  be \nmade  available  in  two  steps.  Firstly,  grant  and  loan  proceeds  will  be  deposited  in  the  FCA  in \naccordance  with \nthe \nGovernment  and  the  respective  pooled  development  partners.  While  the  funds  will  be  pooled, \neach  pooling  partners\u2019  accounts  will  be  recorded,  reconciled,  and  reflected  separately  in  the \nFMR. Under government procedures, no direct payments can be made from the FCA. Secondly, \nfunds  will  be  transferred  from  the  FCA  to  the  Government\u2019s  consolidated  fund  based  on \nsubmission of actual expenditures by MOE. However, MOE will transfer the funds from the FCA \nto the Government\u2019s consolidated fund only upon receipt of the approval of the FMR from the \npooled development partners. \n\nfinancing  agreements  between \n\nthe  respective  provisions  of \n\nthe \n\n106.  Procurement of eligible items and recruitment of consultants will be based on standard \ngovernment  procurement  and  recruitment  practices  acceptable  to  ADB  for  procurement  and \nrecruitment by the Government or its representatives. \n\n107.  Counterpart  funds.  The  local  currency  funds  generated  from  the  proceeds  of  the \nprogram grant and loan will be used by the Government to supplement the cost associated with \nimplementation of the SSR program. \n\n108.  Anticorruption  policy.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProgram.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are \nincluded in the grant and loan regulations. As detailed in the SSR JFA, a performance-related \naudit of SSR will be carried out by the OAG every 2 years.  \n\n109.  At the time of the EFA program preparation, a collective risk assessment was conducted \nby  the  World  Bank  in  collaboration with  the  other  JFA  development  partners.  Overall  program \nrisk  was  rated  medium  in  terms  of  financial  management  and  program  implementation.  A \nfinancial  management  review  was  conducted  by  the  World  Bank  in  conjunction  with  the  EFA \nmidterm  review.  It  concluded  that  the  budgeting,  accounting,  and  reporting  procedures \nelaborated  in  the  FMR  provide  assurance  that  EFA  complies  with  financial  management \nrequirements  in  an  acceptable  manner.  However,  there  are  financing  issues  in  that \ndisbursements  to  districts  and  schools  (i)  are  often  late,  (ii)  are  sometimes  in  inappropriate \namounts,  (iii)  sometimes  lack  clarification  on  how  the  amount  has  been  determined,  and \n(iv) may lack clear guidelines on how the money should be spent. \n\n110.  To mitigate the risks of corruption and ensure good governance in implementation of the \nSSR, the Government and pooling partners agreed to a set of actions referred to as the GAAP, \nwhich  will  address  governance  and  accountability  issues  related  to  management  of  SSR, \nfinancial  management,  procurement  management,  and  social  accountability  tools.  Activities \nrelate to identified areas that require improvement in performance, including (i) improvement in \ntextbook  distribution;  (ii)  timely  distribution  of  grants;  (iii)  timely  distribution  of  scholarships; \n(iv) financial management at central, district, and school levels; (v) procurement at central and \ndistrict  level;  (vi)  enhancing  social  audits;  (vii)  enhancing  school  audits;  (viii)  carrying  out \nperformance  audits;  (ix)  implementation  of  transparency  and  disclosure  measures;  and \n(x) human  resource  management.  The  SSR  JFA  with  the  GAAP  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix A. The financial management assessment of the SSR JFA is in Appendix 8. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n \n\n111.  Tranching  and  monitoring.  The  grant  and  loan  will  be  released  in  two  tranches  of \n$45 million and $50 million. The first tranche will be released to the Government upon fulfilling all \nfirst tranche release conditions and upon the effective date of the Financing Agreement, and will \nbe disbursed fully from the grant resources. The second tranche is expected to be released within \n18  months  of  the  release  of  the  first,  subject  to  compliance  with  second  tranche  release \nconditions.  The  second  tranche  will  be  a  combination  of  the  balance  of  the  grant  resources \n($25 million) and the loan ($25 million). Funds will be released from the FCA to the government \nconsolidated fund based on submission of actual expenditures by MOE.  \n\n112.  Accounting, auditing, and reporting. MOF and the Financial Comptroller General Office \n(FCGO) will be responsible for the financial management of pooled government and development \npartner  funds for  the  EFA program.  The FCGO is providing  access to  its financial  management \ninformation system to the DOE to ensure timely production of financial reports. This will enable the \nDOE staff to prepare reports on SSR accounts, which are identified by specific budget codes in \naccordance with the Government\u2019s cash-based accounting system. These reports will be verified \nby  the  FCGO  before  submission  to  the  pooling  partners  for  their  review.  To  strengthen  the \nthe \nfinancial  management  arrangements \nimplementation  of  a  financial  management  improvement  plan,  as  provided  in  the  GAAP,  to \nstrengthen  capacity  in  the  DOE,  MOE,  and  other  program  cost  centers.  Financial  and  audit \nprovisions are also included at the school level. \n\nthe  Government  has  committed \n\nfurther, \n\nto \n\n113.  The  ESP  subprogram  III  will  be  audited  by  the  OAG  in  accordance  with  auditing \nstandards. The audited statements will be provided to the partners within 9 months of the end of \neach fiscal year. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of grant and loan proceeds and verify the \naccuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n\n114.  Key reports that the Government has agreed to provide include (i) financial statements \non a trimester and annual basis; (ii) annual performance reports; (iii) interim financial monitoring \nreports for the first fiscal trimester; (iv) consolidated reports of the previous fiscal year showing \nprogram outcomes; (v) Flash reports on outcomes and processes twice during each academic \nyear; (vi) annual audit reports of the SSR program as certified by the OAG; and (vii) the ASIP \nand AWPB.  \n\n115.  Program  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  Government  and  the \ndevelopment  partners  have  agreed  to  a  set  of  indicators  to  monitor  implementation  and \noutcomes  in  accordance  with  the  SSR  implementation  plan,  covering  the  key  aspects  of  the \nprogram.  A  comprehensive  monitoring  matrix  with  annual  targets  for  outcome  and  output \nindicators  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B.  The  monitoring  of  SSR  will  largely  rely  on \ninformation collected through the education management information system, which is used to \nprepare the Flash I and Flash II reports, the annual status report, and an annual consolidated \nreport.  This  will  be  supplemented  by  available  data  from  nationally  representative  household \nsurveys.  In  addition,  MOE  and  DOE  will  partner  with  other  agencies  and  firms  to  carry  out  a \nnumber  of  quantitative  and  qualitative  studies  on  specific  topics.  In  addition  to  these  regular \nreports,  SSR  proposes  to  carry  out  sample-based  nationally  representative  student  tests, \nadministered  by  an  independent  agency,  at  grades  3,  5,  and  8\u2014in  partnership  with  an \ninternational  testing  agency  or  firm  and  the  national  Curriculum  Development  Center.  These \nlearning  assessments  will  be  carried  out  early  during  program  implementation  (2010)  and \ntoward the end of the program implementation period (2013). SSR will also further develop the \nsystem  of  decentralized  monitoring,  including  social  audit,  and  the  provisioning  of  external \nevaluation  of  outcomes  and  impact  of  SSR.  The  impact  of  the  program  will  be  evaluated  at \nmidterm and during the last year of the SSR program.  \n\n \n\n\f27 \n\n116.  Program review. Review arrangements for SSR will be very similar to the modality used \nunder  EFA.  One  joint  annual  review  will  be  held  annually  in  April.  The  review  will  assess \nimplementation  progress  with  respect  to  outcomes  and  expenditures.  The  ASIP  for  the  next \nyear  will  be  presented  by  MOE  at  this  review.  Development  partners  will  commit  to  funding \nlevels for the next year based on the previous fiscal year\u2019s progress, and subject to subscribing \nto  the  ASIP.  A  joint consultative  meeting  will  be  held  in  December  of  each  year,  during  which \nthe  signatories  to  the  JFA  will  review  the  preliminary  consolidated  financial  statements  for  the \nprevious  fiscal  year  as well  as  financial  and  output  reports  for  the first  trimester  of  the  current \nyear. MOE and DOE and the development partners have also agreed to hold quarterly meetings \nto address key issues that may arise during implementation and/or on specific issues, such as \nthose identified in the policy matrix and GAAP. \n\nV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProgram Benefits and Impacts \n\n117.  Economic  benefits.  Three  distinct  economic  benefits  can  be  identified  as  a  potential \nresult of the SSR program: (i) increased access to education, resulting in more workers in the \nfuture  with  at  least  8  years  of  schooling  and  with  higher  earnings  as  a  result;  (ii)  enhanced \neducation  quality  and  relevance,  resulting  in  higher  productivity  and  earnings  on  the  part  of \neveryone  who  has  completed  basic  education;  and  (iii)  improved  internal  efficiency  in  the \neducation system.  \n\n118.  For  basic  education,  item  (i)  will  result  in  a  total  of  300,484  additional  students \ncompleting  basic  school  education  in  Nepal\u2019s  public  schools  over  the  5  years  of  the  program \nbeing appraised. As for item (ii), regression analysis suggests that increased quality may result \nin a 5% increase of the average annual earnings of those with basic education.  \n\n119.  To  measure  a  change  in  item  (iii),  education\u2019s  internal  efficiency,  the  analysis  required \nan estimation of the number of student-years needed to produce a student who completes basic \neducation. In a perfectly efficient 8-year system, with no repetition and no dropout, all children \nentering grade 1 would finish the course 8 years later. However, it currently takes an average of \n11.5 student-years for a student to complete the 8-year basic education course, so 3.5 years of \nthe  11.5  years  (the  costs  of  which  must  be  covered  from  the  budget)  are  in  a  sense  wasted \nyears.  Given  the  assumed  reductions  in  repetition  and  dropout  rates  as  a  result  of  the  SSR \nprogram, by the end of the full 7 years of reform, it is anticipated that it will take only 9.73 years \non  average  for  a  student  to  complete  basic  education.  Appendix  6  contains  the  summary \neconomic and financial analysis, while Supplementary Appendix C contains the economic and \nfinancial analysis. \n\n120.  Social benefits and poverty impact. The ESP subprogram III will also generate social \nbenefits  among  the  socially  and  economically  disadvantaged.  Better  access  to  an  affordable \nand quality education, and better learning achievements will ensure that these groups are able \nto  generate  the  necessary  human  and  social  capital  to  build  economically  and  socially \nresponsible lives. A shift to an egalitarian and inclusive education system will help to relieve the \nroot causes of conflict and social tension, build social cohesion, and contribute to social stability. \nImproved access to postprimary and basic education for girls and women will enhance women\u2019s \nroles in the political, economic, and social spheres. Successful implementation of SSR is closely \nlinked to the process of peace building in the country. Investment in education in Nepal, in the \nwake  of  signing  of  the  Comprehensive  Peace  Agreement,  is  considered  a  key  measure  of \nconflict prevention.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n \n\nB. \n\nProgram Risks \n\n121.  Macroeconomic  risks.  Macroeconomic  stability  and  sustained  economic  growth  are \ncrucial for the Government to be able to allocate sufficient recurrent budget to education. In the \ncurrent  macroeconomic  environment,  funding  for  education  should  not  be  compromised.  The \nGovernment  has  accorded  high  priority  to  the  education  sector  and  has  committed  to  ensure \nthat  adequate  funding  will  continue  to  be  allocated  to  the  SSR  program.  Similarly,  continued \ncommitment and cooperation from development partners will be crucial for the sustainability of \nSSR.  However,  this  risk  is  considered  minimal,  as  existing  development  partners  have  a  long \nhistory  of  assisting  education  in  Nepal,  and  new  development  partners  have  tentatively \nexpressed interest in providing support to the SSR program. If budget cuts are necessary, the \nGovernment  intends  to  phase  the  pace  of  reform  in  line  with  the  budget  availability.  Key \npriorities  (such  as  the  provision  of  free  basic  education)  will  continue  to  be  the  focus  of  the \nprogram, while other components (such as secondary education reform, construction activities, \nteacher qualification upgrading, and other activities that can be implemented independently) will \nbe phased or scaled down in line with the available funding. Development partners will have the \nopportunity to review the SSR implementation plan on an annual basis with the submission of \nthe ASIP and AWPB. \n122.  Fiduciary  risks.  A  recently  updated  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability \nassessment30 assessed  that  Nepal\u2019s overall  fiduciary  risk  level  remains  high.  It  concluded  that \n(i)  the  quality  of  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  public  financial  management  and \nprocurement  in  Nepal  ranks  among  the  best  in  Asia,  (ii)  implementation  of  that  framework  is \nproblematic,  and  (iii)  development  partner  practices  tend  to  reinforce  rather  than  tackle \nimplementation weaknesses. However, the financial management arrangements outlined in the \nJFA  assist  the  Government  in  addressing  public  financial  management  weaknesses  while \nreducing the overall risk level to an acceptable level. The JFA and GAAP adopted under SSR \nfurther strengthen fiduciary oversight mechanisms and reduce the risk of corruption.  \n\n123.  Political  risks.  While  the  scope  for  a  more  conducive  political  environment  has \nimproved  since  the  end  of  the  conflict  in  2006,  peace  building  and  reconstruction  continue  to \nconstitute  a  fragile  process  that  entails  political  risks.  Delay  in  development  of  the  new \nconstitution could slow down the decentralization plans for the education sector and the transfer \nof authority to the local level. As a risk mitigation measure, the system will continue to operate \nunder current implementation arrangements. Moreover, the education sector and the envisioned \nreforms have broad political support. The security situation in some parts in the country remains \na  difficulty  in  the  delivery  of  education  services,  and  the  democratic  process  remains  fragile. \nDelivery  of  education  services  in  the  Terai  (lowlands)  is  particularly  affected.  Nevertheless, \nsuccessful  implementation  of  the  ongoing  programs  has  demonstrated  the  resilience  of  the \neducation system under adverse circumstances. \n\n124.  Program risks. As SSR is a major reform program, resistance to change from within the \nsystem,  as  well  as  outside  the  system,  could  be  expected.  Vested  interests  and  dissenting \nopinions may slow down or divert the reform process. This risk has been mitigated throughout \nthe  design  process  by  seeking  wide  stakeholder  feedback  and  inputs,  and  the  process  is \nsupported at a high political level through cabinet approval of the SSR core document. As such, \nstrong opposition to the required changes in the education act is not expected. \n\n125.  Another internal program risk emanates from the wide scope of the SSR program. The \nGovernment  will  have  to  be  careful  to  withstand  pressures  to  spread  resources  over  a  wide \n\n                                                 \n30  DFID.  2008.  Fiduciary  Risk  Assessment:  Nepal.  Kathmandu.  Footnote  8  of  this  report  states  that  the  2008  DFID \nfiduciary risk assessment requires a four-option opinion as to whether fiduciary risk is low, moderate, substantial, or \nhigh. The previous scoring was based on a three-option opinion (low, medium, or high). \n\n \n\n\f29 \n\nrange of activities, especially by expanding certain programs that divert resources from the core \nmandate of MOE. Continued focus on the key guiding principles that have been set out during \nthe development of the SSR program will mitigate this risk.  \n\n126.  Compliance  with  social  safeguard  policies.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 9. An environmental assessment is in Supplementary Appendix D \nand a poverty assessment of the policy actions is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n\nfalls \n\n127.  Environment.  The  proposed  program \ninto  environmental  category  C.  An \nenvironmental assessment of the policy interventions (Supplementary Appendix D) shows that \nmost  of  the  proposed  policy  actions  will  not  impact  the  environment,  while  the  policy  action \naiming  to  make  access  to  education  more  equitable  might  have  some  very  minor  impacts \nrelated  to  school  and  classroom  construction.  Insignificant  environmental  impacts  that  might \narise  during  implementation  of  the  program  include  dust  and  noise  pollution  from  building \nconstruction activities, and contaminated water extraction from school wells\u2014both of which can \nbe  mitigated  easily.  The  Government  follows  a  National  Environmental  Guideline  for  School \nImprovement  and  Facility  Management  for  site  selection,  and  for  designing  and  monitoring \nconstruction  of  school  buildings  and  facilities  such  as  sanitation  for  girls.  This  will  prevent \nnegative  impacts  such as  arsenic and  fluoride  contamination  in  drinking  water,  construction in \nsensitive  ecological  regions,  air  quality,  and  waste  management.  The  ESP  subprogram  III  is \nexpected to contribute positively to the environment by providing school latrines, and improving \nhygiene practices among children and youth. \n\n128. \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  proposed  program  falls  into  involuntary  resettlement \ncategory  C.  There  will  be  no  involuntary  land  acquisition  or  resettlement.  Two  activities  under \nSSR  may  give  rise  to  voluntary  land  acquisition:  (i)  the  financing  of  classrooms,  libraries,  and \nlaboratories  in  schools;  and  (ii)  activities  that  help  construct  administrative  buildings,  such  as \nDEO  offices.  Land  for  school  construction,  if  required,  will  be  acquired  through  voluntary \ndonation  by  the  beneficiary  community.  It  is  likely  that  the  land  that  will  be  needed  for \nadministration buildings is already registered in the name of MOE or the Government. However, \nif private land needs to be acquired, this will be done only through a willing buyer\u2013willing seller \napproach. A framework for land acquisition through voluntary donations or willing buyer\u2013willing \nseller processes (Supplementary Appendix F) was formulated (i) to establish voluntary donation \nand  willing  buyer\u2013willing  seller  procedures,  including  recording  the  process  and  disclosing \ninformation regarding the voluntary donation and willing buyer\u2013willing seller approach; and (ii) to \nensure that the Government will acquire land for the DEO and other buildings by following only \nthe willing buyer\u2013willing seller approach. \n\nIndigenous  peoples.  The  proposed  program  falls  into  indigenous  peoples  category  B \n129. \nas  it  will  have  positive  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples.  The  Program  will  consider  them  as \ndisadvantaged  groups  together  with  other  disadvantaged  groups.  A  vulnerable  communities \ndevelopment  framework  has  been  formulated  to  ensure  that  specific  actions  are  taken  to \nengage  these  groups  in  program  planning  through  meaningful  consultations  at  each  stage  of \nprogram implementation, and to enable them to share the benefit of the proposed program with \nother  project  beneficiaries.  Appropriate  specific  actions  will  be  formulated  and  implemented \nduring project implementation. The summary vulnerable communities development framework is \nin Appendix 10, while the complete framework is in Supplementary Appendix G. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n130. \nIn  addition  to  the  continued  compliance  and  implementation  of  the  actions  specified  in \nthe Program\u2019s policy matrix and standard assurances, the Government has given the following \nspecific assurances, which will be incorporated in the Financing Agreement: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  the  satisfactory  implementation  of  the  Program  and \nwill  fully  comply  with  the  actions  set  out  in  the  policy  matrix  that  need  to  be \ncomplied  prior  to  the  second  tranche  (Tranche  2)  to  enable  the  release  of \nTranche 2. The Government will submit documents, in a form satisfactory to ADB, \nas  evidence  to  demonstrate  compliance  with  each  of  the  actions  set  out  in  the \npolicy matrix. \nThe Government will (a) carry out the policies and actions in accordance with the \nschedule of policy reforms contained in the policy matrix and ensure sustainability \nof  the  reforms  beyond  the  program  period,  (b)  carry  out  all  of  its  obligations  as \nstipulated under the Financing Agreement in a timely manner, and (c) ensure that \nthe agreed actions are taken with respect to each policy achievement. \nThe  Government,  through  MOE  and  DOE,  will  implement,  manage,  coordinate, \nand  monitor  the  Program  in  accordance  with  its  goals,  responsibilities,  funding \nrequirements,  and  other  program  management \nmechanism, \narrangements as set forth in the SSR core document, SSR plan and agreed in the \nSSR JFA. \nThe  Government  will  carry  out  the  actions  agreed  between  the  Government  and \nthe Pooling DPs, as set out in the GAAP and attached to the SSR JFA, to address \ngovernance  and  accountability  issues  relating  to  the  management,  financial \nmanagement,  procurement  management  and  social  accountability  tools  of  the \nSSR. \n\nfiduciary \n\n(vi) \n\n(v)  Within 1 month of the Effective Date, MOE will have recruited consultancy services \nand commissioned a study to analyze constraints in implementing the local content \ncurriculum.  The  study  shall  make  recommendations  to  effectively  implement  the \ncurriculum. \nThe Government will ensure that the Counterpart Funds will be used to support the \neducation  sector \nthe  cost  associated  with \nimplementation of the SSR Program. \nThroughout the program period, the budget allocations for education will remain at \nleast at the level of FY2008, while all efforts will be made to increase the budget \nallocation. \n\nto  supplement \n\nreform  and \n\n(vii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  The  Government  will  endeavor  that  (a)  critical  program  staff  shall  remain  in  their \nposition  on  a  full-time  basis  for  a  reasonable  duration  to  ensure  continuity  in  the \nimplementation  of  the  Program;  and  (b)  all  implementing  agencies  shall  be \nadequately staffed and provided with the necessary financial, technical, and other \nresources to perform their functions under the Program. \nThe  Program  will  make  all  possible  efforts  to  avoid  land  acquisition.  In  the  event \nthat  land  acquisition  becomes  necessary  for  the  implementation  of  the  Program, \nthe  Executing  Agency  will  ensure  that  such  land  is  acquired  only  on  a  voluntary \nbasis in accordance  with the  procedures  outlined in the approved Framework for \nLand  Acquisition  through  Voluntary  Donations  or  Willing  Buyer\u2013Willing  Seller \nProcesses (Supplementary Appendix F). \nMOE  and  DOE  will  implement,  manage,  coordinate,  and  monitor  the  Program  in \naccordance  with  the  Vulnerable  Communities  Development  Framework  agreed \n\n(x) \n\n \n\n\f(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n31 \n\nbetween  the  Government  and  ADB  (and  the  derived  Gender  and  Vulnerable \nCommunities  Action  Plan)  to  enable  the  program-affected  vulnerable  groups\u2014\nparticularly girls, indigenous peoples, and ethnic minorities\u2014to benefit equally from \nthe Program. \nThe Government will ensure that the activities carried out under the Program will \nbe in full compliance with current environmental laws and regulations of Nepal and \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002).  If  any  unexpected  significant  environmental \nimpact of the Program is identified during the program period, MOE and the DOE \ninitial \nwill  prepare  satisfactory  environment \nimpact  assessment  and \nenvironmental  examination  or  environmental \nenvironmental  management  plan,  and  obtain  ADB\u2019s  endorsement  of \nthe \ndocuments.  The  Government  will  consult  ADB  for  the  public  disclosure  of  the \ndocuments. \nIn  line  with  the  SSR  JFA,  the  Government,  through  MOE  and  DOE,  will  provide \nADB with all relevant data and information in such detail as ADB may reasonably \nrequest to facilitate review by ADB and the development partners, who are parties \nto the SSR JFA, of the progress in the implementation of the Program. \n\nreview  documents  such  as \n\nB. \n\nCondition for Grant and Loan Effectiveness \n\n131.  The following is the condition for program grant and loan effectiveness:  \n\n(i) \n\nAll conditions for the release of the first tranche, as specified in the policy matrix, \nhave been complied with to the satisfaction of ADB.  \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  grant  and  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n\n132. \nAgreement of the Asian

 consists  of  preschool  and  early  childhood \n1. \neducation  and  development  (ECED);  5  years  (grades  1\u20135)  of  primary  education;  3  years \n(grades 6\u20138) of lower secondary education; 2 years (grades 9\u201310) of secondary education; and \n2 years  (grades  11\u201312)  of  higher  secondary  education,  technical  education  and  vocational \ntraining  (TEVT),  tertiary  education,  and  adult  literacy.  A  school  leaving  certificate  (SLC)  is \nawarded by a national examination at the end of grade 10, and a high school leaving certificate \nis awarded at the end of grade 12. Schools are categorized into four types: (i) community-aided \n(public  schools  that  are  fully  supported  by  the  Government  for  teachers\u2019  salaries  and  other \noperational  costs),  (ii)  community  managed  (public  schools  that  are  fully  supported  by  the \nGovernment for teachers\u2019 salaries and operational costs but whose management responsibility \nis  undertaken  by  the  community),  (iii)  community  unaided  (public  schools  that  receive  partial \nsupport from the Government), and (iv) institutional schools (private schools supported entirely \nby  parents  and  trustees).  In  addition  to  these  categories,  religious  schools  such  as  Madarsa \n(Islamic),  Gumba  (Buddhist),  and  Gurukul  (Hindu)  offer  mostly  primary  education.  Alternative \nschooling  is  provided  through  the  School  Outreach  Program  for  ages  6-8,  Flexible  Schooling \nProgram for ages 8-14 and Urban Out-of-School Program covering children aged 6 to 14.   \n\nAt  central  level,  the  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE)  is  responsible  for  overall  policy \n2. \ndevelopment,  planning,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  of  the  education  sector.  Under  MOE, \nschool  education  is  administered  by  the  Department  of  Education  (DOE),  through  District \nEducation  Offices  (DEOs)  in  the  75  districts.  DEOs  are  responsible  for  ensuring  the  flow  of \nfunds to schools for salaries as well as distribution of provisions such as textbooks and teacher \ntraining  activities.  DEOs  work  through  resource  persons  in  resource  centers,  which  provide \nmonitoring  and  professional  support  to  a  cluster  of  10\u201325  primary  schools.  At  the  community \nlevel,  school  management  committees  (SMCs)\u2014composed  of  parents,  community  members, \nand school administrators\u2014play  significant  roles  in  the  management  of schools.  In  the case \nof  community  managed  schools,  SMCs \nthe  recruitment  and \nmanagement  of  teachers  as  well  as  resource  mobilization.  Higher  secondary  education  is \nmanaged  separately  under  the  Higher  Secondary  Education  Board,  while  administration  of \nTEVT  is  under  the  responsibility  of  the  Council  for  Technical  Education  and  Vocational \nTraining (CTEVT).  \n\ntake  responsibility \n\nfor \n\n3. \nSuccessive  governments  have  given  high  priority  to  education,  particularly  to  meet  the \nlearning  needs  of  the  most  disadvantaged  children.  The  Education  Act  of  1971  and  the \nEducation Regulation of 2002 state that primary education is to be provided free of charge for \nall  children enrolled  in community  schools.  In  lower  secondary and  secondary  education,  free \neducation is provided for girls as well as for Dalit and Janajati children whose family income \nfalls below the poverty line. Moreover, the Interim Constitution of 2007 entitles each citizen to \nreceive free education up to the secondary level, and each community has the right to provide \nbasic  education  in  its  mother  tongue  to  preserve  its  script  and  cultural  heritage.  Extensive \nscholarship programs and other incentive schemes have been provided to support schooling of \ndisadvantaged children at primary and secondary level. Mother tongue instruction in five major \nlanguages has been introduced in primary education. Decentralization of education is also a key \npolicy  of  the  Government.  The  7th  amendment  of  the  Education  Act  of  2001  provides \ncommunities,  through  the  SMCs,  with  formal  rights  to  manage  primary  schools  to  improve \nequitable  access  and  quality.  The  Government  has  introduced  several  schemes  to  promote \ndecentralization  at  community  level,  which  include  decentralized  selection  and  appointment  of \nteachers  based  on  a  credible  teaching  licensing  system,  and  direct  channeling  of  non-salary \nrecurrent costs to the SMCs. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n36 \n \n \n\n2. \n\nOverall Sector Outcomes  \n\n4. \nConsistent  efforts  to  support  education,  social  inclusion  policies,  and  decentralization \nstrategies  have  contributed  significantly  to  expand  participation  in  education  at  all  levels.  As \nprimary education enrollment has reached more than 90%, and primary completion has reached \nabout  76%,  demand  for  postprimary  education  has  increased.  From  2001  to  2008,  the  net \nenrollment  rate  (NER)  for  primary  education  rose  from  81%  to  92%.  The  NER  for  lower \nsecondary education rose from 42.9% to 52.3%, while the NER for secondary education grew \nfrom 29.5% to 34.7%. The NER for higher secondary education was 11% in 2008. The average \nannual growth rate was about 3.5% for primary enrollment, 2.4% for lower secondary, and 7.4% \nfor secondary from 2001 to 2006. Gender parity has improved, with girls representing 49.5% of \nprimary enrollment, 48.2% of lower secondary enrollment, and 47.2% of secondary enrollment \nin 2008 according to the 2008 Flash I Report.1 Although enrollment rates of Dalits and Janajatis \nhave  not  been  systematically  tracked  until  very  recently,  available  data  indicate  that  the \nenrollment of these groups has increased substantially over the past 5 years. Nevertheless, \ngender, caste, and ethnic disparities in enrollment increase with the level of education. Poverty \nremains a major barrier in access to education of the most disadvantaged groups.  \n\nImproving internal efficiency of the public school system, especially in the early grades \n5. \nof  primary  education,  remains  a  challenge.  The  grade  1  gross  intake  rate  was  148%  in  2008, \nreflecting  substantial  underage  and  overage  enrollment.  This  creates  overcrowding  of \nclassrooms  and  impedes  the  pedagogical  process.  In  turn,  it  becomes  a  factor  for  high \nrepetition  and  dropout  rates.  Repetition  rates  have  slightly  improved  since  2001,  but  28%  of \ngrade 1 children repeated the year in 2008. The survival rate to grade 5 was 73% in 2008, and \nthe transition rate to lower secondary was 77%. The SLC pass rate for students from community \nschools has ranged from 25% to 35% over the past decade. In 2006, SLC pass rates recorded \na  net  improvement  of  62%  over  the  previous  year.  However,  90%  of  private  school  students \npass SLC examinations as opposed to 51% of public school students in 2007. \n\n6. \nStudents\u2019 learning outcomes are difficult to assess in the absence of a reliable learning \nachievement test. However, student achievement in primary and lower secondary education is \nfound  to  be  weak.    Comparison  between  a  national  assessment  conducted  in  2008  and  a \nprevious  assessment  in  1999  show  continued  weakness  in  Mathematics  and  English,  relative \nstrength in Social Studies, and a decline in Nepali mean scores. The 2008 national assessment \nshowed that grade 5 students master less than half of the material specified in the curriculum \nframework specifications grid for each grade and subject area, and 16% of the sampled schools \nhad  achievement  levels  below  30%.  There  were  also  significant  variations  between  students \nfrom  different  socioeconomic  and  ethnic  groups\u2014indicating  that  the  education  system  did  not \ncompensate for differences in geographical, social, and economic backgrounds. \n\n7. \nOverall,  Nepal  has  been  successful  in  steadily  improving  access  to  education  at  all \nlevels  while  narrowing  gender  and  social  disparities  in  enrollment.  However,  low  internal \nefficiency  and  indication  of  poor  learning  outcomes  suggest  that  further  effort  is  needed  to \nimprove the quality of education, and to address the needs of the most disadvantaged groups. \nThe  education  divide  persists  between  urban,  rural,  and  remote  areas  as  well  as  between \nchildren from well-off and less well-off families. \n\nB. \n\nTrends and Challenges \n\n1. \n\nBasic Education and Early Child Development  \n\n8. \nOne  of  the  major  thrusts  of  the  School  Sector  Reform  (SSR)  is  to  expand  basic \neducation from grades 1 to 8 and to make it gradually free and compulsory. This entails multiple \nchallenges: (i) sustain gains in participation in and provision of primary education; (ii) continue \n\n                                                 \n1 Department of Education, Government of Nepal. 2008. Flash I Report 2065 (2008\u20132009). Kathmandu. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n37 \n\nprogress in improving the quality of primary education and reach the 8% of children who are out \nof  school,  and  (iii)  meet  the  increasing  demand  for  affordable  postprimary  education  of  good \nquality.  \n\n9. \nEarly  childhood  education  and  development.  In  2008,  the  gross  enrollment  rate \n(GER) for ECED reached 63.4%. The percentage of grade 1 students with ECED experience \nwas  up  to  36.2%  in  2008  from  8.0%  in  2001.  However,  investments  in  ECED  have  not  yet \nreturned value in terms of increased efficiency by reducing underage enrollments in grade 1 and \nlowering repetition rates in early grades. This could be attributed to the persistent enrollment of \nunderage and overage children in grade 1 diluting the impact of ECED investments on lowering \ngrade  1  repetition  rates,  or  the  poor  quality  of  ECED  curriculum  and  services.  International \nresearch  indicates  that  ECED  is  particularly  effective  in  preparing  marginalized  children  for \nsuccess in school. The failure to cater to the most excluded groups because the ECED centers \nare  concentrated  in  relatively  developed  areas  could  also  be  undermining  ECED\u2019s  effect  on \nimproved efficiency.  \n\n10. \nEffective  targeting.  Targeted  interventions,  such  as  scholarships  for  girls  and  Dalit \nchildren,  contributed  to  increased  enrollment  among  these  groups.  However,  performance, \nparticularly  of  the  Dalits,  needs  attention  as  their  pass  rates  and  promotion  rates  are  low. \nGender  and  socioeconomic  gaps  widen  markedly  in  the  transition  from  grade  5  to  lower \nsecondary.  These  trends  suggest  that  more  assertive  targeting  and  a  comprehensive  support \nprogram are needed to improve the retention, progress, and academic achievement of children \nfrom  disadvantaged  groups.  This  would,  in  turn,  help  improve  the  internal  efficiency  of  the \nsystem.  Factors  typically  affecting  schooling  of  marginalized  children  are  a  combination  of \npoverty, gender, and caste-related social barriers; and academic support that is not sufficiently \nadjusted  to  their  language  and  culture.  Therefore,  a  combination  of  various  strategic \ninterventions  is  needed,  most  of  which  have  been  already  introduced  under  the  system:  (i) \nscholarships and other incentive schemes, (ii) deployment of female teachers and teachers from \ndisadvantaged  groups,  and  (iii)  mother  tongue  instruction  in  the  early  grades.  Special  support \nfor  early  grades  teaching  and  systematic  academic  support  to  disadvantaged  students  would \nhelp  sustain  enrollment  and  average  learning  outcomes.  This  would  include  special  remedial \nprograms for overage grade 1 children to join the age-appropriate classroom. Strict enforcement \nof the policy of non-enrollment of underage children at grade 1 would also help improve grade 1 \nefficiency. \n\n11. \nQuality. Key factors affecting school quality are (i) poor learning environment, including \novercrowded  classrooms  in  some  areas;  (ii)  lack  of  sufficient  number  of  qualified  teachers; \n(iii) late  delivery  of  textbooks;  (iv)  insufficient  teacher  support  and  supervision,  which  lead  to \npoor pedagogical process and low teacher motivation; (v) rigid instructional provision that does \nnot  take  into  account  the  needs  of  a  socioculturally  diverse  population;  and  (vi)  weak \nmanagement  and  monitoring  capacity  at  school  and  district  level.  A  comprehensive  Technical \nReview  of  School  Education2 conducted  in  2006  indicated  that  on  average  54%  of  students \nreceived a full set of textbooks and 3% a partial set within the first week of the school session. \nIn terms of physical facilities, 76% of the schools had drinking water and 78% had toilet facilities; \n36% of the schools had separate toilets for girls.  \n\nThe increase in the number of teachers has not kept pace with the increase in student \n12. \nenrollments.  Many  schools  have  insufficient  teachers,  both  in  terms  of  reaching  a  minimum \nteacher per school ratio and reaching subject teacher norms set by the Government. Of greater \nconcern  is  the  regional  imbalance  in  the  distribution  of  teachers.  While  about  half  of  the \nmountain and hill districts suffer from severe teacher shortages, the rest have vacancy levels of \n10% or less, or even surpluses. While many valley districts have surpluses, almost all districts in \n\n                                                 \n2  MOE. 2006. Technical Review of School Education. Kathmandu.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n38 \n \nTerai have vacancies. Overall, the unequal distribution of teachers and low motivation level of \nteachers indicate the absence of an effective teacher deployment and management system.  \n\n13. \nUnder  SSR,  the  aspiration  and  pressure  of  achieving  the  goal  of  free  and  compulsory \nbasic education might drive access to grades 1\u20138 faster than the internal mechanisms for policy \nformulation  and  strategic  planning  for  improving  quality  can  absorb.  As  access  to  grades  6\u20138 \nwill increase faster than access to grades 1\u20135, the tradeoff between mass access and average \nquality at upper primary education has serious potential. Evaluations of past primary education \nprojects  and  programs  also  acknowledged  the  slow  progress  in  the  quality  of  education \ncompared  to  the  rapid  expansion  in  access.  Key  steps  needed  to  pursue  the  quality  agenda \nwould be to (i) develop a clear framework of norms and standards for quality, including technical \nstandards  for  school  inputs,  instructional  processes,  and  outcomes;  (ii) identify  reliable \ninstruments  to  measure  cognitive  learning  outcomes;  (iii)  further  analyze  and  develop  a \ncomprehensive plan for qualification upgrade, selection, recruitment, and management of basic \neducation  teachers;  and  (iv)  develop  implementation  strategies  for  quality  improvement  that \nwould rely on incentives and an accountability mechanism, particularly at the local level.   \n\n2. \n\nSecondary Education and Technical Education and Vocational Training  \n\n14. \nFor  decades,  apart  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  a  few  bilateral \nagencies,  the  Government  and  most  education  development  partners  have  considered \nsecondary  education  as  a  subsector  to  be  addressed  only  after  achieving  universal  primary \neducation.  When  SSR  shifted  the  strategic  focus  from  primary  to  basic  education  and \nintroduced the concept of an integrated grade 1\u201312 system, secondary education began to be \nviewed  as  a  necessary  extension  and  upgrading  of  basic  education.  However,  policy  choices \nfor secondary education are more complex than for basic education. Thus, careful analysis of \nthe implication of such policy choices would be required before implementation of secondary \neducation restructuring will begin under SSR. \n\n15. \nSecondary education financing. The Interim Constitution, enacted in 2007, states that \nfree secondary education will be provided by the state. However, at present, secondary schools \ncollect  tuition.  In  the  case  of  community  schools,  students  pay  NRs500  or  more  per  year \nwhereas institutional lower secondary and secondary schools collect NRs4,000\u2013NRs12,000 or \nNRs6,000\u2013NRs12,000  per  year  per  student  depending  on  the  institution.  In  addition,  each \nschool  collects  various  kinds  of  fees  for  extracurricular  activities  such  as  sports  and  special \ntraining,  as  well  as  for  maintenance  of  facilities  such  as  libraries  and  laboratories.  Moreover, \ncommunity  unaided  schools  currently  receive  only  partial  support  from  the  Government,  so \ncommunities contribute to teacher salaries and operational costs. Although recent data on the \nshare of household and community contribution to secondary education are not available, it is \nanticipated that such a cost-sharing mechanism for secondary education may need to continue \nto  maintain  the  current  system.  It  also  means  that  the  plan  for  further  expanding  secondary \neducation will require a more careful and comprehensive sector financing plan.  \n\nQuality.  Expansion of secondary education has significant cost implications in terms of \n16. \nquality.  Implementation  planning  must  therefore  take  quality  issues  explicitly  into  account. \nMinimum  service  standards  for  secondary  education  are  to  be  more  specific  in  terms  of \ncurriculum and textbooks, number of subject teachers with appropriate qualifications, education \nfacilities  such  as  libraries  and  laboratories,  equipment,  instructional  materials,  and  processes. \nThe  Secondary  Education  Support  Project3 also  showed  the  importance  of  hostel  facilities  in \nschools in remote areas. Therefore, a national framework of norms and standards will need to \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB.  2002.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Secondary \n\nEducation Support Project in the Kingdom of Nepal. Manila.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n39 \n\nbe  developed  for  secondary  education  that  includes  textbooks,  curriculum,  instructional \nprocesses, and teacher development. \n\n17. \nSince  the  National  Curriculum  Framework  (grades  1\u201312)  was  approved  in  2006,  lower \nsecondary  and  secondary  curricula  and  textbooks  have  been  revised.  The  new  curricula  are \nmore  functional  and  accentuate  problem-solving  approaches  based  on  practical  needs. \nHowever,  in  terms  of  teacher  skills,  there  is  a  mismatch  between  learning  needs, \ncompetencies,  and  skills  demanded  from  students  in  the  modern  economy  and  the  teaching \nskills  of  Nepal\u2019s  secondary  teachers.  Teacher  shortages  negatively  affect  the  quality  of \nsecondary  education  and  create  a  barrier  to  expansion  of  access  to  secondary  education. \nComprehensive policies to attract and retain high-quality secondary education teachers should \nbe  devised.  Such  policies  should  factor  in  remuneration,  professional  development  issues, \nteacher deployment and class size policies, and accountability systems. \n\nHigher  secondary  education.  Currently,  there  are  community  higher  secondary \n18. \nschools, private higher secondary schools, and public higher secondary programs affiliated with \nuniversities.  In  2006,  the  Government  amended  the  Education  Act  and  the  Higher  Secondary \nEducation  Act  with  the  intention  of  integrating  higher  secondary  education  with  the  school \nsystem.  Implementation  of  this  policy  has  been  slow,  and  secondary  education  and  higher \nsecondary  education  are  still  managed  by  two  separate  agencies\u2014the  DOE  and  the  Higher \nSecondary  Education  Board.  This  split  has  contributed  to  poor  coordination  between  the  two \nlevels.  The  phasing  out  of  the  public  higher  secondary  programs  from  the  universities,  when \nhigher  secondary  education  merges  with  the  school  system,  will  add  complexity  in  secondary \neducation  restructuring.  As  higher  secondary  schools  have  been  traditionally  established  and \nfunded by nongovernment funds, the status and financing of higher secondary education will be \nsubject  to  much  debate  in  SSR.  To  date,  the  Government  has  not  established  any  higher \nsecondary schools, and has not supplied teachers to higher secondary schools, but it has been \nproviding  a  limited  amount  of  grants  for  teachers\u2019  salaries  to  community  higher  secondary \nschools.  \n\nTechnical  education  and  vocational  training.  Nepal has a long history of TEVT\u2014\n19. \nboth school-based and as an independent stream. Higher technical education is provided by the \nuniversities. More sector-specific training programs are offered by different sector departments \nsuch  as  cottage  and  small  industries  and  tourism.  Excluding  the  universities,  there  is  an \nestimated national training capacity of about 50,000 trainees annually. The school-based TEVT \nbegan in 1971, with the expectation to develop students\u2019 marketable skills upon completion of \nschool  education.  However,  this  program  could  not  be  sustained  and  the  concept  of  trade \nschools under CTEVT was developed. Some schools are developed as annex schools affiliated \nwith CTEVT. Currently, such annexes have 798 students in total.  \n\n20. \nThe parallel provision of vocational subjects in schools is not yielding the desired results \nfor  several  reasons:  (i)  inadequate  and  outdated  skills  of  graduates;  (ii)  limited  and  restrictive \nchoices  of  vocational  subjects;  (iii)  inadequate  preparedness  and  limited  workshop  facilities  in \nthe  schools,  with  inadequate  maintenance  and  replacement  of  teaching  equipment;  (iv)  very \nlimited  interaction  with  the  private  sector;  (v)  inadequate  number  of  teachers  with  hands-on \nskills;  and  (vi) inadequate  funding  for  recurrent  expenditures.  The  cost  of  providing  TEVT  in \nschools  is  quite  prohibitive\u2014annual  learning  costs  could  be  less  than  NRs10,000  for  general \nschool education but as high as NRs100,000 per student for TEVT. This suggests that school-\nbased TEVT that involves extensive investment in physical infrastructure, equipment, and highly \nspecialized technical teachers is not an adequate option in Nepal. A more limited but relevant \nrole  of  TEVT  in  school  education  will  be  explored  under  SSR\u2014i.e.,  the  development  of  soft \nemployability skills to prepare for and orient schoolchildren toward future employment. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n Goals and Performance Targets \n1.

It analyzes the financial and budgetary affordability of the program, and projects \nthe sustainability of the education system beyond the SSR program period. 1 \n\nA.  \n\nEconomic Analysis of SSR \n\n2. \nThe economic analysis of the initial 5 years of the SSR program compares the benefits \nand costs of the SSR program as opposed to the counterfactual or \"without-program\" scenario \nin  which  the  Government  of  Nepal\u2019s  program  for  the  school  sector  is  an  extrapolation  of  the \nspending  and  activities  of  the  recent  period  during  which  Education  for  All  (EFA)  was  being \nimplemented. The SSR investment being appraised is the estimated addition to sector spending \n(both development and recurrent spending) caused by implementation of the SSR program. The \nbenefits are taken to be those changes in the quantity and quality of education produced over \nthe period of the program as a result of SSR, as well as any savings attributable to reductions in \n\u201cwastage\u201d (repetition and dropout) of students in the system. Underlying all of the analysis are \nprojections of (i) Nepal\u2019s 5-year-old age cohorts2, (ii) gross intake ratios of children into grade 1, \nand (iii) repetition and dropout rates in all grades (1\u201312).   \n\n1. \n\nBenefits of School Sector Reform Program \n\nThree  distinct  benefits  as  a  result  of  SSR  can  be  identified  and  will,  to  the  extent \n3. \npossible,  be  quantified:  (i) increased  education  quantity  (increased  access  to  education, \nresulting  in  more  workers  in  the  future  with  at  least  8  years  of  schooling  and  with  higher \nearnings as a result); (ii) enhanced education quality and relevance (more learning, resulting in \nhigher productivity and earnings on the part of everyone who has completed basic education); \nand (iii) enhanced education\u2019s internal efficiency (less \u201cwastage,\u201d i.e., fewer school dropouts and \nrepeaters, and lower unit costs as a result).   \n\n4. \nIncreased  education  quantity. SSR will result in more children entering the education \nsystem, who will repeat and drop out less. As a result, more students will complete basic and \nsecondary education. Based on higher intake rates and lower repetition and dropout rates, over \nthe 5-year period, SSR will result in 300,397 more students completing basic education (grade 8) \nin Nepal\u2019s public schools, and 47,387 more secondary education graduates.  \n\nRegression  results  based  on  household  survey  data3 show  that  a  Nepali  wage  worker \n5. \nwho  has  completed  basic  education  earns  about  2.5  times  more  than  a  worker  who  has \ncompleted  less  than  basic  education.  The  first  cohort  of  additional  graduates  (those  finishing \ngrade  8  in  FY2010  will  be  eligible  to  enter  the  labor  market  in  FY2011.  In  FY2011  prices,  the \n250%  earnings  differential  amounts  to  about  NRs25,300  per  year.  This  differential  was  then \nassumed to grow by 5% in every future year, in line with anticipated inflation. Aggregating the \nwage differentials of all five cohorts yields a discounted present value (DPV)4 of $771.7 million.5 \n\nEnhanced education quality and relevance. This benefit applies not only to additional \n6. \ngraduates but to almost 2.3 million students who will complete basic education from FY2010 to \nFY2014.  The  2003/04  Nepal  Living  Standards  Survey  (NLSS,  footnote  3)  included  no  direct \n\n                                                 \n1   The  economic  and  financial  analysis  is  a  collaborative  exercise  conducted  by  staff  and  consultants  of  the  Asian \n\nDevelopment Bank and the World Bank. \n\n2  An age cohort is defined as a group of people having the same age in a given year. \n3   Government of Nepal, Central Bureau of Statistics.

Kathmandu. \n4  Taking 12% to be the opportunity cost of capital and discounting the stream of benefits by this rate. \n5  Applying the same methodology to the benefits expected to accrue to additional secondary school graduates would \nyield  a  DPV  of  $919  million,  which  is  even  larger  owing  to  the  sizable  earnings  differential  seen  in  the  NLSS \nbetween secondary school graduates and those with less education.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n53 \n\nmeasure  of  the  quality  of  schooling  received  in  the  past  by  adults  wage  earners,  nor  did  it \nspecify whether an individual attended a public or private school. It was therefore assumed that \nan individual\u2019s place of birth, which in most cases indicates where an individual went to school, \ncould  be  used  as  a  rough  proxy  for  education  quality\u2014on  the  assumption  that  those  living  in \nurban  areas  are,  on  average,  more  likely  to  attend  a  good  quality  school  than  those  living  in \nrural areas. While far-from-perfect as a measure of school quality, the location variable was the \nbest  indicator  available  in  this  case.  Studies  of  unit  costs  in  a  large  number  of  developing \ncountries have shown conclusively that average spending per student is strongly correlated with \nthe urban\u2013rural divide.  \n\n7. \nRegression  analysis  indicates  that,  if  holding  years  of  schooling  and  experience  are \nconstant, a person who comes from an urban area earns about 10% more than a person from a \nrural area. Of course, someone who was born in an urban area is more likely to live and work in \nan urban area today, and some of the difference in earnings must be attributed to differences in \nthe  demand  for  skills  in  urban  and  rural  areas,  but  it  was  decided  that  half  of  the  difference \ncould be attributed to differences in the quality of education received. From this assumption, 5% \nof the average annual earnings of those with basic education (as observed in the 2003/04 NLSS \nand allowed to grow at the rate of inflation) was taken to be a measure of the \u201ceducation quality \npremium\u201d  and  was  used  to  assess  the  impact  of  overall  improvements  in  system  quality  as  a \nresult of SSR.   \n\nAs  with  the  quantity  benefit,  the  earnings  of  the  student  beneficiaries  (those  who  will \n8. \ncomplete  basic  education  from  FY2010  to  FY2014)  were  tracked  for  20  years  into  the  future. \nThe DPV of the benefit stream amounts to $428.8 million.6 \n\nEnhanced  internal  efficiency. To measure a change in education\u2019s internal efficiency, \n9. \nthe  analysis  estimated  the  number  of  student-years  needed  to  produce  1  (or  1,000)  basic \neducation completer(s). In a perfectly efficient 8-year system, with no repetition and no dropout, \nfor every 1,000 children entering grade 1, 1,000 would finish the course 8 years later. Currently \nin Nepal, it is necessary to use 11.5 student-years to produce one graduate of the 8-year basic \neducation course\u2014so 3.5 years of the 11.5 years (the costs of which must be covered from the \nbudget) are in a sense wasted years. \n\n10. \nGiven  the  assumed  reductions  in  repetition  and  dropout  rates  as  a  result  of  the  SSR \nprogram,  at  the  end,  only  9.73  student-years  will  be  needed  to  produce  1  basic  education \ngraduate,  generating  savings  of  1.77  fewer  student-years.  To  assign  a  monetary  value  to  the \nsavings,  unit  costs  were  computed  for  each  year  of  the  5-year  program,  by  dividing  the \nprojected number of students by the projected basic education costs in that year. The DPV of \nthis benefit stream amounts to $78.3 million.  \n\n2.  \n\nDiscounted Present Value of Program Costs \n\n11. \nTo  compute  the  additional  expenditures  required  to  generate  the  benefits  described \nabove,  the  costs  of  the  education  sector  in  the  without-program  scenario  are  estimated,  and \ncompared to the SSR program costs. Figure A6.1 shows two versions of the public costs of the \nschool  sector  during  the  5  years  being  appraised:  (i)  those  according  to  a  without-program \nscenario,  and  (ii)  the  higher  costs  needed  to  implement  the  SSR  program.

From NLSS data, it is possible to quantify both \nthe  direct  and  indirect  private  (household)  costs  of  education.  Adding  the  private  cost  to  the \npublic cost increases the additional expenditure, by the Government, development partners, and \nhouseholds  for  SSR  to  $576  million  over  the  next  5  years.  The  DPV  of  the  5-year  basic \neducation cost stream is $347.9 million.  \n\n3. \n\nNet Present Value and Economic Internal Rate of Return of SSR \n\n13. \nBased  on  a  discount  rate  of  12%,  Table  A6.1  suggests  that  the  DPV  of  the  benefits \nexceeds the DPV of the costs, hence investment in SSR is profitable from a social perspective.  \n\nTable A6.1: Net Present Values at Different Discount Rates  \n($ million) \n\nDPV of Benefits and \nCosts \nQuantity \nQuality and relevance \nInternal efficiency \nCosts \nNPV (Benefits\u2013Costs) \n\nDiscount rate \n\n12% \n \n771.7 \n428.8 \n78.3 \n347.9 \n930.9 \n\n39.2% \n(EIRR) \n102.4 \n45.1 \n35.7 \n183.2 \n0 \n\n \n\n                                                  DPV = discounted present value, EIRR = economic  \n \n                                                  Source: ADB estimates. \n\n       internal rate of return, NPV = net present value \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n14. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  the  investment  amounts  to  39.2%\u2014a \nrobust  figure  that  almost  certainly  equals  or  exceeds  the  rate  of  return  on  most  alternative \ninvestments that the Government could be considering at this time.  \n\n4. \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\n15. \nThe key assumptions underlying the estimated EIRR in Table A6.1 are related to (i) the \nspeed of progress in achieving the internal efficiency targets (repetition and dropout rates both \nfalling  nearly  to  zero),  and  (ii)  the  additional  earnings  associated  with  the  completion  of  basic \neducation and with having attended school in an urban (higher school quality) rather than rural \n(lower  school  quality)  area.  The  first  alternative  estimate  (Table  A6.2)  assumes  that  progress \ntoward  the  internal  efficiency  targets  is  one-half  of  the  original  assumption.  This  results  in  an \nEIRR  of  26.2%.  The  second  alternative  assumes  that  the  earnings  premiums  associated  with \ncompletion and quality are two-thirds of those assumed for the main EIRR estimate. This results \nin  an  EIRR  of  32.3%.  The  last  alternative  estimate  combines  both  sets  of  lower  assumptions \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n55 \n\nand  results  in  an  EIRR  of  22.8%.  While  the  EIRR  estimates  under  the  more  conservative \nassumptions  are  lower  than  the  main  EIRR  estimate,  even  these  reduced  rates  exceed  the \nopportunity cost of capital at 12%. The results of the sensitivity analysis reinforce the conclusion \nthat the SSR program is a sound investment for Nepal. \n\nTable A6.2: Sensitivity Analysis \u2013 Alternative EIRR Estimates \n\nInvestment Scenario \u2013 Assumptions about benefits and costs \nA.

The benefits associated with secondary education (grades 9\u201312) have not been counted. \nAn  estimate  of  the  EIRR  that  takes  into  account  all  of  the  benefits  associated  with  secondary \neducation, as well as the private costs (household outlays and opportunity costs) of secondary \neducation, is 62.5%, which is 23 percentage points higher even than the EIRR based on basic \neducation alone. The key explanation for the difference in the A and C estimates is the very high \nearnings  premium  currently  enjoyed  by  those  in  Nepal  who  have  completed  12 years  of \nsecondary education compared to those with just basic education or incomplete secondary.  \n\nB. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n17. \nThe estimation of the available budget for SSR in any year requires an estimate of gross \ndomestic product (GDP) in the latest available year plus annual values for four parameters that \nmake  up  the  simulation  model:  (i) the  nominal  (measured  in  current  prices)  GDP  growth  rate, \nwhich equals the real (measured in constant prices) growth rate times the rate of price inflation; \n(ii) government expenditure as a share of GDP; (iii) education\u2019s share of the government budget; \nand (iv) the school sector\u2019s (or SSR's) share of the education budget. \n\nBudget  envelope  scenarios.  Three  estimates  of  the  simulation  model,  based  on \n18. \ndifferent parameter values, are presented here: scenarios 1, 2, and 3 (a \u201chigh case,\u201d a \u201cmedium \ncase\u201d and a \u201clow case\u201d). Scenarios 1 and 2 are based on a GDP estimate of NRs1,045.5 billion \nin FY2010 and a nominal growth rate of 10.8% thereafter.7 These were the values projected at \nthe end of 2008 by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the International Monetary Fund.  \n\n19. \nThe assumptions about other parameters of the model were based on an extrapolation \nof recent trends and on government policy statements. Figure A6.3 shows the recent trends and \nprojections of the Government\u2019s share of GDP and education\u2019s share of the government budget. \nThe  Government\u2019s  share  of  GDP  has  been  increasing  each  year  since  FY2003.  In  view  of \nNepal\u2019s  recent  success  in  increasing  government  revenue  through  better  tax  collection,  MOF \nand the National Planning Commission project even higher government shares over the period \nfrom  FY2008  to  FY2016\u2014perhaps  reaching  25%  or  higher.  However,  conservative  financial \n\n                                                 \n7  Equal to 5.5% real growth times 5.0% inflation. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nanalysis  for  the  SSR  program  assumes  that  government  spending  will  reach  21%  of  GDP  in \nFY2009 and remain at that level for the 7 years that follow.  \n\n20. \nThe Government has set a target of 20% for education\u2019s share of government spending \nbut MOE\u2019s share of the government budget has not exceeded 17% to date (Figure A6.3). This \nanalysis assumes that education\u2019s share of the budget will gradually approach 20% and reach \nthis target in FY2016. \n\n22\n22\n\n21\n21\n\n20\n20\n\n19\n19\n\n18\n18\n\n17\n17\n\n16\n16\n\n15\n15\n\n)\n)\n\n%\n%\n\n(\n(\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\ne\ne\ng\ng\na\na\nt\nt\nn\nn\ne\ne\nc\nc\nr\nr\ne\ne\nP\nP\n\nFigure A6.3: Government Spending as Share of GDP and Education\u2019s Share of \nFigure A6.3: Government Spending as Share of GDP and Education\u2019s Share of \nGovernment Spending: Recent Trends and Projections for SSR\nGovernment Spending: Recent Trends and Projections for SSR\n\n21.0\n21.0\n\n20.6\n20.6\n\n19.8\n19.8\n\n19.4\n19.4\n\n18.9\n18.9\n\n21.0\n21.0\n\n20.0\n20.0\n\n19.5\n19.5\n\n19.0\n19.0\n\n18.5\n18.5\n\n18.0\n18.0\n\n17.4\n17.4\n\n16.3\n16.3\n\n17.1\n17.1\n\n17.2\n17.2\n\n15.8\n15.8\n\n15.8\n15.8\n\n16.7\n16.7\n\n16.2\n16.2\n\n16.0\n16.0\n\n16.8\n16.8\n\n16.6\n16.6\n\n17.5\n17.5\n\n17.0\n17.0\n\nFY\nFY\n2002\n2002\n\nFY\nFY\n2003\n2003\n\nFY\nFY\n2004\n2004\n\nFY\nFY\n2005\n2005\n\nFY\nFY\n2006\n2006\n\nFY\nFY\n2007\n2007\n\nFY\nFY\n2008\n2008\n\nFY\nFY\n2009\n2009\n\nFY\nFY\n2010\n2010\n\nFY\nFY\n2011\n2011\n\nFY\nFY\n2012\n2012\n\nFY\nFY\n2013\n2013\n\nFY\nFY\n2014\n2014\n\nFY\nFY\n2015\n2015\n\nFY\nFY\n2016\n2016\n\nActuals\nActuals\n\nPlanned\u00a0(SSR)\nPlanned\u00a0(SSR)\n\nBudget\nBudget\nAllocations\nAllocations\n\nGovernment\u00a0expenditure\u00a0as\u00a0share\u00a0of\u00a0GDP\u00a0(Govt%GDP)\nGovernment\u00a0expenditure\u00a0as\u00a0share\u00a0of\u00a0GDP\u00a0(Govt%GDP)\n\nEducation's\u00a0share\u00a0of\u00a0government\u00a0budget\u00a0(Educ%Govt)\nEducation's\u00a0share\u00a0of\u00a0government\u00a0budget\u00a0(Educ%Govt)\n\nGDP = gross domestic product, SSRP = School Sector Reform.\nGDP = gross domestic product, SSRP = School Sector Reform.\nSource: ADB estimates.\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n \n\n21. \nThe simulation model also estimates the school sector\u2019s share of the education budget \n(the  share  going  to  preschool  education  and  grades  1\u201312).  This  share  has  remained  quite \nconstant (86%\u201389%). The remaining 11%\u201314% of MOE\u2019s budget is spent on tertiary education, \ntechnical education and vocational training (TEVT), and libraries and for MOE operations. This \nanalysis  assumes  that  the  school  sector\u2019s  share  will  remain  at  87.4%,  the  approximate  level \nrecently, for all years of the program. \n\n22. \nHigh case scenario. Using the parameter estimates discussed thus far yields the first of \nthe three financial envelope estimates\u2014the high case scenario (scenario 1), a 5-year envelope \nof $2.693 billion (Table A6.3). While this would be slightly more than enough to finance an SSR \nprogram of $2.626 billion, scenario 1 also assumes that the development partners will finance \n30%  of  the  total  cost  of  the  SSR  program,  which  would  be  an  extrapolation  of  the  average \ndevelopment  partner\u2019s  share  to  the  EFA  program.  However,  given  the  larger  size  of  the  SSR \nprogram  compared  to  EFA,  this  requires  development  partner  contributions  of  $808.0  million \nover the 5 years. At the time of the program\u2019s appraisal, the development partners that currently \nsupport  Nepal\u2019s  education  system  made  tentative  pledges  amounting  to  about  $488  million  to \ncover the first 5 years of the SSR program.   \n\n23.  Medium  case.  Subtracting  the  difference  between  30%  of  total  funding  according  to \nscenario  1  and  $110  million  in  each  year  of  the  program  reduces  the  total  financial  envelope \nfrom  $2.693  billion  to  $2.374  billion\u2014the  basis for  scenario  2  or  the  medium  case  scenario.  If \nwe assume the medium case to be a realistic estimate of the budget envelope, this leaves us \nwith a financing gap of $253 million ($2.374 billion minus $2.626 billion). \n\n24. \nLow  case.  Since  MOF  and  the  International  Monetary  Fund  released  the  GDP \nprojections  used  in  scenarios  1  and  2  at  the  end  of  2008,  the  global  economic  situation  has \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n57 \n\ncontinued to deteriorate. MOF lowered its estimates of Nepal\u2019s economic growth in the short to \nmedium  term  to  real  growth  of  3.8%,  which  translates  into  nominal  growth  of  9.0%  using  the \nsame projected inflation rate of 5.0%. Scenario 3 or the low case scenario in Table A6.3, which \nreflects  the  lower  GDP  figures,  shows  a  5-year  financial  envelope  of  $2.353  billion.  If  this \nscenario  is  thought  to  be  the  most  likely,  it  increases  the  5-year  budget  gap  by  $21  million, \nmaking it $274 million. \n\nSummary  of  financing  gap.

The  Ministry  of  Local  Development  has  already  agreed  to \nimprove  its  tracking  of  local  development  grants.  Inclusion  of  Ministry  of  Local \nDevelopment  contributions  to  education  will  help  the  Government  to  satisfy  the \n20%  budgetary  guideline  for  education.  It  will  improve  the  manner  in  which \nallocations  are  made  to  schooling  activities  and  result  in  greater  budgetary \npredictability.  Estimates  of  local  development  spending  to  date  suggest  that \nrecent totals nationwide have been about $25 million per year.  \nThe Government has been quite successful during FY2009 in increasing revenue \ncollection. Even in the face of the economic downturn, this success could provide \nthe Government with more comfortable fiscal space in the future than in previous \nyears. \nThe  Government  has  also  signaled that  it  will  focus  on  resource  mobilization  in \nthe  early  years  of  the  SSR  program,  and  hope  to  attract  new  development \npartners to education. In particular, it was agreed that an application will be made \nto  the  EFA  Fast  Track  Initiative  for  a  grant  to  help  bridge  the  funding  gap.  The \nFast  Track  Initiative  Secretariat  has  indicated  that  perhaps  as  much  as  $100 \nmillion could be secured from the Fast Track Initiative Catalytic Fund.  \nThe Government is keen to develop a comprehensive sector financing strategy in \nthe  medium  to  long  term,  with  more  innovative  partnerships  with  the  private \nsector, including local and international nongovernment organizations. This is in \nrecognition of the fact that government alone cannot adequately finance Nepal\u2019s \neducation sector. \n\nC. \n\nSustainability of Education System after SSR \n\n27. \nThis  section  assesses  the  program\u2019s  sustainability  in  the  years  that  follow  the  SSR \nprogram period. For this exercise, SSR program costs are re-categorized along three levels of \nitem  regularity:  (i) recurrent  costs,  such  as  teachers\u2019  salaries  and  scholarships;  (ii) costs  that \nproduce capital assets with a short (2-5-year) working life, such as the development of curricula; \nand (iii) costs producing assets with a long working life, such as construction. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nFor the years after SSR, beginning with FY2017, it is assumed that activities in category \n28. \n1 will occur annually, whereas those in category 2 will occur only every 3.5 years, and those in \ncategory 3 every 10 years. As during the SSR program period, a 5% inflation rate is assumed. \nBecause  development  activities  that  occurred  in  a  compressed  fashion  during  SSR  will  occur \nless often after the program ends, the growth in the cost of the school sector will be slower after \nSSR (as shown by the flatter slope of the graph showing costs in Figure A6.4 from FY2017 to \nFY2025 compared with FY2010 to FY2016). \n\n29. \nAs for financing to cover the costs of the school sector after SSR, it is assumed that the \nfinancing  from  government  and  NGOs  will  grow  at  9%\u2014the  rate  at  which  GDP  is  assumed  to \ngrow  according  to  scenario  3.  By  FY2017  the  global  economic  situation  is  likely  to  have \nimproved,  and  Nepal\u2019s  economic  growth  could  be  higher  than  this.  In  addition,  the  growth  of \neducation spending could remain higher than (or could fall below) economic growth.

The excess financing in the outer years could be used \nto make further improvements in the quality of education, and gains in education access on the \npart  of  remaining  disadvantaged  groups.

The  resulting  fiduciary  risk  environment  is  assessed  as  high.  A  public \nexpenditure and financial accountability assessment (PEFA),1 carried out in September 2008 by \nthe  World  Bank  and  the  Department  for  International  Development  (DFID)  of  the  United \nKingdom, concluded that Nepal\u2019s overall fiduciary risk level remains high; this was similar to a \n2007  assessment  carried  out  by  DFID.2 The  risks  are  associated  with  inadequate  monitoring, \npoor  capital  budgeting,  spending  outside  mainstream  reporting  systems,  bunching  of \nexpenditures  in  the  last  trimester,  collusion  of  the  contractors  and  intimidation  at  the  time  of \nsubmitting  bidding  documents,  and  the  absence  of  local  government  bodies.  However,  the \nassessment also noted the existence of a number of credible reform programs in the areas of \ngovernment ownership and the institutional mechanism of a PEFA steering committee under the \nchair of the finance minister. As suggested in the 2008 fiduciary risk assessment, on the request \nof  the  Government,  a  joint  World  Bank  and  DFID  public  financial  management  mission  was \nfielded in February 2009. The objective of the mission was to discuss the PEFA action plan, and \nprioritize  and  sequence  actions  in  a  platform  approach  around  a  set  of  mutually  supportive \nmeasures  that  are  feasible,  realistic,  and  sustainable,  and  can  generate  results  in  PFM \nperformance. The mission, in coordination with the Asian Development Bank (ADB), reached an \nunderstanding  with  the  Government  on  its  immediate  priorities  for  PFM  reforms,  including \ncapacity  building  requirements.  Reflecting \nthe  above  priorities  and  capacity  building \nrequirements, the Government is preparing a PFM strategy document. \n\nB. \n\nFiduciary Risk at the Sector Level \n\n2. \nA  fiduciary  risk  assessment  in  the  education  sector  conducted  by  DFID  in  September \n20073 concluded  that  overall  risk  in  the  sector  was  high,  mainly  because  of  the  absence  of \neffective  social  and  financial  audits  at  the  school  level.  Although  these  measures  have  been \nprovided  for,  some  weaknesses  remain  because  of  limited  monitoring  of  the  schools,  poor \nrecord  keeping  at  the  schools,  and  financial  and  time  constraints  on  resource  persons  and \nschool  supervisors.  On  the  positive  side,  the  assessment  noted  that  the  budget  had  shown  a \nlarge  increase  in  expenditure  and  significant  improvements  in  budget  utilization  (100%  in \nFY2007). It also acknowledged that there was a credible program to improve the PFM system in \nthe  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE)  through  a  Financial  Management  Improvement  Action  Plan, \nwhich  is  being  monitored  by  several  development  partners.  The  2008  DFID  and  World  Bank \njoint  fiduciary  risk  assessment  (footnote  1)  noted  satisfactory  progress  on  the  Financial \nManagement  Improvement  Action  Plan  in  the  areas  of  preparation  of  a  draft  audit  guide  and \nstandards for the schools, formation of a social audit committee to ensure social audits in all the \nschools, revision of social audit guidelines and notification to the schools that the third trimester \nbudget  would  only  be  released  upon  the  submission  of  the  social  audit  report  of  the  previous \nyear,  the  preparation  of  a  plan  for  computerizing  all  district  education  offices  (DEOs),  and  a \ncapacity  development  plan  for  DEO  staff  including  accountants.  However,  it  pointed  out  that \n\n                                                 \n1   DFID.  2008. Fiduciary  Risk  Assessment:  Nepal.  Kathmandu.  Footnote  8  of  this  report  states  that  the  2008  DFID \nfiduciary risk assessment requires a four-option opinion as to whether fiduciary risk is low, moderate, substantial, or \nhigh. The previous scoring was based on a three-option opinion (low, medium, or high). \n\n2   DFID. 2007. DFID Fiduciary Risk Assessment. Kathmandu \n3  DFID. 2007.

The  overall  program  risk  for  education  was  rated \nmedium in terms of financial management and program implementation. During the approval of \nits additional financing for EFA in 2007, the World Bank conducted a fiduciary risk assessment \nand concluded that the risk was moderate. ADB conducted an assessment for approval of the \nESP subprogram II in 2007 and confirmed the moderate rating.4 \n\n4. \nA  financial  management  review  was  conducted  by  the  World  Bank  in  conjunction  with \nthe EFA midterm review. It concluded that the budgeting, accounting, and reporting procedures \nin  the  financial  monitoring  report  (FMR)  provide  assurance  that  EFA  complies  with  financial \nmanagement  requirements  in  an  acceptable  manner.  Substantial  progress  was  also  noted  in \nfinancial  and  social  auditing  at  the  school  level.  In  coordination  with  the  Institute  of  Chartered \nAccountants  of  Nepal,  an  audit  guide  and  standards  for  school  audit  were  prepared,  and  the \nDepartment  of  Education  (DOE)  is  implementing  school  audits  in  accordance  with  the  guide. \nThe Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nepal is providing the necessary training to auditors \nat the regional level. At present, a school accounting manual is being prepared. DOE has also \nallocated budget for school audits in FY2009. Similarly, the social audit guide has been revised \nand  a  dissemination  program  to  various  districts  is  ongoing.  The  constitution  of  a  social  audit \ncommittee in each school is being ensured, and social audits are being carried out. However, \nthere  are  financing  issues,  as  disbursements  to  districts  and  schools  (i)  are  often  late,  (ii)  are \nsometimes  in  inappropriate  amounts,  (iii)  sometimes  lack  clarification  on  how  the  amount  has \nbeen determined, and (iv) may lack clear guidelines on how the money should be spent. \n\n2. \n\nSchool Sector Reform Program \n\n5. \nSSR  joint  financing  arrangement.  SSR\u2019s  JFA  continues  EFA\u2019s  system  of  earmarked \nbudgetary  support  that  is  controlled  by  an  agreed  reporting  mechanism.  Except  for  some \nchanges, the JFA of the School Sector Reform program includes all the provisions of the EFA \nJFA. The following areas have been strengthened in the JFA: (i) an enhanced monitoring and \nevaluation function, with the development of regular evaluations; (ii) a biannual fiduciary review \nof the program, covering financial management and procurement conducted by the World Bank \non behalf of the pooling partners; (iii) a biannual performance audit performed by the Office of \nthe  Auditor  General;  and  (iv)  the  inclusion  of  a  Governance  and  Accountability  Action  Plan \n(GAAP). The new clause on the GAAP (para. 8) will contribute toward good governance in the \nimplementation of SSR. The GAAP further strengthens fiduciary oversight mechanisms. In view \nof  the  additional  control  mechanisms  adopted  under  the  SSR  JFA,  fiduciary  requirements  are \ncomplied with in an acceptable manner.  \n\nimplementation \n\nIn  general,  SSR \n\n6. \nfollows  government  accounting  systems.  The \ngovernment  reporting  mechanisms  and  formats  were  assessed  and  considered  adequate. \nGovernment  financial  and  procurement  reports  will  therefore  be  used  for  financial  monitoring \nand  reporting,  and  semiannual  reports  will  be  used  to  measure  outputs.  The  accounting  and \nauditing standards are gradually being made compatible with international standards, and The \nInstitute  of Chartered  Accountants of  Nepal  has  helped  in developing  auditing  and  accounting \n                                                 \n4  ADB.  2007.

The computerization of DEOs, by  using newly developed accounting \nsoftware  and  newly  introduced  electronic  data  transfer  mechanism,  will  largely  help  in  timely \ncompletion and submission of FMRs. However, the JFA also requires accounting, reporting, and \nauditing requirements that are acceptable to ADB. It requires annual and semiannual progress \nreports detailing expenditures, outputs, outcomes, and processes for the period to be produced \nand  submitted  to  the  funding  partners.  The  funding  partners,  including  ADB,  will  review  these \nreports  during  regular  meetings  and  joint  review  missions.  The  JFA  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix A. The main reports are as follows:    \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  annual  strategic  implementation  plan  (ASIP)  and  annual  work  plan  and \nbudget  (AWPB)  are  prepared  annually  and  submitted  to  the  JFA  development \npartners at the beginning of each fiscal year. After reviewing and subscribing to \nthese reports, the partners commit to their annual contributions. \nThe  FMRs  are  a  set  of  financial  reports  detailing  actual  expenditures,  cash \nbalances,  and  cash  requirements  prepared  and  submitted \nthe  JFA \ndevelopment  partners  within  45  days  of  the  end  of  each  trimester  (every \n4 months). After reviewing this report, the funding agencies disburse funds based \non actual expenditures and forecasted cash requirements. \nAn unaudited annual financial statement is prepared and certified by the financial \ncomptroller general and submitted to the JFA development partners no later than \n6 months after the end of the fiscal year. \nAn  annual  audit  of  the  annual  FMR  is  performed  by  the  Office  of  the  Auditor \nGeneral and submitted to the JFA development partners no later than 9 months \nafter the end of the fiscal year. \n\nto \n\nDisbursement  arrangements.  Disbursements  are  made  in  two  steps.  First,  JFA \n7. \ndevelopment  partners  advance  funds  based  on  expected  cash  requirements  into  the  foreign \ncurrency  account  in  the  name  of  the  Government  of  Nepal  established  at  the  Nepal  Rastra \nBank.5 While the funds are pooled, each pooling development partner\u2019s amounts are recorded \nand reconciled separately by MOE.  Balances and reconciliations are reported in the FMR. No \ndirect payments for any transaction can be made from this fund. In the second step, funds are \nreleased  from  the  foreign  currency  account  to  the  Government\u2019s  consolidated  fund  based  on \nsubmission and approval of actual expenditures by MOE (as reported in the FMR). Funds are \nnot released until approval of the FMR is received from the pooling development partners. \n\n8. \nGovernance  Accountability  and  Action  Plan.  To  further  mitigate  the  risks  of \ncorruption  and  ensure  good  governance  in  the  implementation  of  SSR,  the  Government  and \npooling partners have agreed to a set of actions called the GAAP. The GAAP includes a number \nof actions, which will address governance and accountability issues related to management of \nSSR,  financial  management,  procurement  management,  and  social  accountability  tools.  The \nGAAP Framework in Table A8 summarizes the agreed actions. The GAAP aims at (i) ensuring \nminimum  enabling  conditions  in  school  education;  (ii)  improving  financial  management  and \nprocurement  procedures  and  their  timeliness;  (iii)  strengthening  the  role  of  communities  and \nconcretizing \ninstitutional  and  capacity \nin \ndevelopment,  and  human  resource  management;  (v)  performance  audits;  (vi)  disclosure \narrangements and a communication strategy; and (vii) guidelines for dealing with emergencies, \nconflicts, and crisis.  \n\nthe  decentralization  agenda \n\nthis  sector;  (iv) \n\n                                                 \n5   In addition to initial advance of the first two trimesters' expenditure estimates, there is also a provision in the new \nJFA for depositing a larger amount of funds for developing partners adopting a programmatic support modality. \n\n \n\n\fTable A8: Governance and Accountability Action Plan Framework \n\nReporting \nFrequency \n\nKey Actions  \n\n \nExpected Results  \n\nObjectives \n\nKey  Activities \n\nKey indicators \n\nIssue 1: Ensuring Minimum Enabling Conditions For School Education \n\n1.1.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n\nEducation  plays  a  vital  role  in  human  development  and  hence  contributes  to  poverty  reduction.  In  Nepal,  education  is \nconsidered a major means for poor households to escape from poverty. With external assistance, Nepal has made significant \nefforts in the education sector, and this has contributed to improvements in human development indicators. The Government\u2019s \ncommitment to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has also stimulated more effort in improving the primary education \nsector,  with  the  goal  of  achieving  basic  and  primary  education  for  all  by  2015.  Participation  in  education  has  improved \nconsiderably  over  the  last  5  decades,  especially  at  primary  level.  In  2008,  the  primary  net  enrollment  rate  reached  91.9%, \ncompared with 81% in 2001. However, high repetition and dropout rates and poor learning outcomes, especially among girls \nand socioeconomically disadvantaged groups (including indigenous and ethnic minority groups), are major concerns.  \nBuilding  on  the  poverty  reduction  strategy  of  the  Tenth  Plan  (2002\u20132007),a  the  Government's  Three-Year  Interim  Plan \n(FY2008-FY2010)b  aims  to  build  self-sustaining  societies  free  from  absolute  poverty  through  economic  and  social \ntransformation  based  on  social  justice.  Education  is  a  key  priority  sector  of  the  Government  for  overall  development  and \npoverty reduction. The long-term vision of the plan on education is to ensure access of all citizens to inclusive, equitable, and \nquality basic education. The plan emphasizes social inclusion in terms of gender, caste, and ethnicity in education to reduce \nsocioeconomic disparities. The Interim Constitution of Nepal of 2007 also recognizes basic education as a fundamental right \nand has made provisions for free education up to the secondary level.  \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country  strategy  and  program  2005\u20132009  for  Nepalc  is  based  on  the  Government\u2019s \nstrategic  priorities  as  set  out  in  the  Tenth  Plan,  and  focuses  on  promoting  broad-based  economic  growth,  inclusive  social \ndevelopment, and good governance. The midterm review of the Country Partnership Strategyd in 2008 recognized the need \nfor more strategic interventions in the sectors of ADB assistance to respond to the changing context of the country and the \npost-conflict environment. Education is the priority sector of ADB assistance to the Government.  \n\nIn line with the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy and ADB\u2019s assistance strategy, the Program will support government \nefforts in poverty reduction. It will directly support progress toward Nepal\u2019s MDG targets in education. \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                       Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention, Non-Income MDGs \n\n1.  Key Issues  \n\nThe Interim Constitution of 2007 provides the right to free education for each citizen up to secondary level. The constitution \nalso  establishes  equity  measures  with  the  right  to  receive  basic  education  in  the  mother  tongue.  The  Tenth  Plan  (which \nembodies its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper) also identified social development, including improvement in education, as \none of the four pillars of Nepal\u2019s poverty reduction strategy; and aimed at improving access to, and quality of, education. The \nThree Year Interim Plan further emphasizes inclusive education and the right to education for women, disadvantaged groups, \nindigenous ethnic groups (Janajati), and disabled groups, by increasing their access from primary to higher education. \n\nThe Education Sector Program subprogram III will support the Government\u2019s school sector reform (SSR) program for effective \nand quality education during FY2010\u2013FY2012. The Program contains targeted intervention programs for inclusive education \nfocusing  on  girls,  Dalits,  disabled,  and  disadvantaged  groups.  It  will  especially  benefit  girls  and  socially  discriminated  and \ndisadvantaged  groups  by  providing  better  access  to  affordable  quality  basic  education\u2014enabling  better  educational \nattainment and social capital needed for better livelihoods.  \nAccording to the Nepal Living Standard Surveye the poverty incidence of Nepal reduced from 42% in 1996 to 31% in 2004. \nHowever, this decrease has been distributed unequally across development regions and different population sections of the \ncountry, resulting in increasing income inequality (Gini coefficient increased from 34.2% in 1996 to 41.4% in 2004). Poverty is \nclosely  related to issues of geographic location, caste, and gender,; and there  are high levels of socioeconomic  disparities. \nEconomic and social outcomes are worse in rural areas, particularly in remote areas. Poverty levels are highest and access to \nservices lowest in the remote Mid-west and Far-west, with poverty incidence of 27% in the Western Region, 45% in the Mid-\nwestern, and 41% in the Far-western regions. Among the people living in extreme poverty, agricultural wage laborers remain \nthe poorest in Nepal (poverty incidence of 55%).  \n\nThe 11% drop in poverty is also distributed unevenly across different caste, ethnic, and minority groups. In the last decade, \npoverty  declined  most  significantly  in  upper  caste  groups.  While  poverty  declined  by  46%  in  the  upper  caste  Brahmin  and \nChhetri group, it declined by only 21% among the lower caste Dalits, 10% among the hill indigenous ethnic groups, and 6% \namong  the  Muslims.  The  NLSS  II  data  show  that  the  poverty  incidence  of  historically  marginalized  and  socially  excluded \ngroups\u2014Dalits,  indigenous  ethnic  groups,  and  Muslims,  who  altogether  constitute  above  50%  of  the  total  population\u2014are \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nhigher  than  that  of  Brahmins,  Chhetris,  and  Newars  and  are  above  the  national  average.  The  incidence  of  poverty  is  19% \namong Brahmins and Chhetris and 14% among Newars, compared with 46% among Dalits, 44% among hill indigenous ethnic \ngroups, and 41% among Muslims. Average household per capita consumption amongst Dalits, indigenous ethnic groups, and \nMuslims is also considerably lower than that of households of the upper caste and privileged groups. Literacy rates are lowest \namong the Dalits\u2014about 30% lower than literacy rates of high-caste Brahmins and 35% lower than Newar rates. At primary \nlevel, the share of Dalits\u2019 enrollment is only 18% and indigenous ethnic groups 38%.  \n\nThe SSR program will address poverty through inclusive provision of better quality education. As described in the economic \nand  financial  analysis,  SSR  will  result  in  (i)  increased  education  quantity  (increased  access  to  education,  resulting  in  more \nworkers  in  the  future  with  at  least  8  years  of  schooling  and  with  higher  earnings  as  a  result);  and  (ii)  enhanced  education \nquality and relevance (more learning, resulting in higher productivity and earnings on the part of everyone who has completed \nbasic education). In combination with the targeted strategies to mainstream children from disadvantaged communities into the \neducation system, SSR is expected to contribute to poverty reduction.  \n\n2. Design Features.  \n\nMajor  policy  strategies  for  inclusion  in  the  SSR  plan  consist  of  multilingual  education,  targeted  interventions  for  extremely \nmarginalized groups and communities, flexible as well as decentralized approaches, and differentiated treatment to facilitate \nand integrate the populations with diversity needs. \n\nThe SSR plan includes coherent implementation strategies, particularly in terms of reaching vulnerable communities. These \ninclude primarily the expansion of early childhood education and development (ECED) programs in poverty pockets, targeting \nthe  children  of  vulnerable  groups;  promotion  of  education  based  on  mother  tongues;  and  enforcement  of  protection  of  the \nintegrity of all children, with special focus on Dalits, girls, and marginalized populations.   \n\nFree alternative programs such as nonformal education courses and traditional modes of education (Madarsa, Gumba, Vihar) \nwill also be supported to be better equipped and capable to provide education to those not able to attend formal schools for \ndifferent reasons. Apart from the above, incentives such as scholarships will be provided for children from economically and \nsocially marginalized families. The reform will focus on girls and women, and children from educationally deprived groups so \nthat they will participate equally and attain equitable results. \n\nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending \n\nThe  following  policy  actions  will  directly  or  indirectly  contribute  to  more  inclusive  education,  and  will  contribute  to  poverty \nreduction (more details are in Supplementary Appendix E): \n\n(i)  Ministry of Education (MOE) to prepare a phased implementation plan for free and compulsory basic education, including \na list of needed legislative changes and proposed timing for such changes; this will lower the financial threshold for basic \neducation to children from poor households.  \n\n(ii)  Cabinet  to  amend  Teacher  Service  Commission  Regulations  and  other  relevant  legislation  to  reserve  an  appropriate \nnumber of vacant positions for recruitment  of female teachers and teachers from disadvantaged social groups; this  will \nmake  the  teaching  profession  more  accessible  for  women  and  for  licensed  teachers  from  disadvantaged  backgrounds. \nCurrently, 35% of teachers in the primary level are female; 13% of teachers in the secondary level are female and 1.5% \nof teachers are Dalit. By 2014, it is envisioned that 50% of the teaching force will be women in the primary level, and 25% \nin the secondary level, with 10% female head teachers; and 5% will be Dalit teachers. \n\n(iii)  MOE to approve guidelines to ensure the policy on local content curriculum is enforced; this  will lower the threshold to \n\neducation for children from remote areas who do not speak Nepali. \n\n(iv)  MOE to approve a time-bound action plan on upgrading the academic qualifications of teachers in basic education; this \n\nwill enhance the quality of education, enhancing the earning potential for graduates in the labor market. \n\n(v)  MOE to approve a liberal promotion policy with no holdback of students up to grade 3; this will enhance the retention of \n\nstudents in the education system. \n\n(vi)  MOE to approve school operational guidelines for grades 1\u20138, as well as provisions for alternative schooling, modalities, \nand  multigrade  schools;  this  will  provide  educational  opportunities  for  children  from  different  backgrounds,  and  for \nchildren in remote areas. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n69 \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nSocial  exclusion  in  Nepal  takes  form  through  various  discriminatory  practices  based  on  caste,  gender,  ethnicity,  and  social \nand  economic  status,  including  other  parameters  of  vulnerability.  These  constitute  traditionally  deep-rooted  values  and \nconvictions  that  affect  vulnerable  groups\u2014especially  women  and  girls,  Dalits,  and  ethnic,  linguistic  and  religious  minorities \nthrough various discriminatory practices. Exclusion of children with disabilities is also traditionally embedded.  \n\nIt  is  estimated  that  8.1%  of  primary  age  children  remain  out  of  school\u2014including  disadvantaged  children,  children  with \ndisability,  children  facing  extreme  poverty,  working  children,  conflict  affected  and  displaced  children,  children  affected  by \nHIV/AIDS, etc. Despite substantial achievements made under the Education for All (EFA) program (2004\u20132009), children from \nvulnerable groups are overrepresented in the out-of-school population and remain a hard-to-reach group for reasons related \nto social distance rather than physical distance to the schools. \n\nSocial exclusion also affects the teaching profession. The composition of teachers by major ethnic groups is disproportionate \nto  the  corresponding  population  figures\u2014about  37.2%  Janajatis  and  15%  Dalits.  The  percentage  distribution  of  teachers  is \n3.7% Dalits, 23.7% Janajatis, 8.4% Madhesis, and 1.5% disabled.  \n\nThe  SSR  program  envisages  a  set  of  coherent  implementation  strategies,  particularly  in  terms  of  reaching  the  vulnerable \ncommunities. Policies and strategies for enhanced social inclusion and a range of actions, including inclusive education and \naffirmative  action,  have  been  adopted  in  the  Program.  These  include  financial  and  pedagogical  support  and  incentive \nschemes targeted to the schools as well as financial and in-kind support to families and children. Free alternative programs \nwill be provided for students who cannot attend formal schools. Special provisions will be made to cater to the needs of public \nschool students in Karnali Zone, one of the poorest areas in the country. SSR also provides for the recognition and support of \ncaste  and  cultural  education  sources  like  Gumbas,  Vihar,  Madarsas,  and  Gurukul,  which  will  contribute  to  the  education  of \nchildren not attending mainstream education. SSR further intends to develop local content curricula, mother tongue materials, \nand instruction for early grades. Affirmative actions to increase the number of teachers from disadvantaged groups includes \nthe  equitable  allocation  of  positions  for  the  recruitment  of  teachers  and  personnel  in  management  positions  from  these \ngroups, and criteria for teacher selection weighted in favor of candidates from these groups. \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n\nStakeholder involvement in the development of SSR was ensured within MOE, as well as at the central and local level. SSR \ndevelopment  was  led  by  a  group  of  senior  officials  of  MOE  under  the  guidance  of  the  interministerial  education  policy \ncommittee  (EPC)  involving  the  National  Planning  Commission,  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  the  Ministry  of  Women  and  Social \nAffairs, and the Ministry of Local Development. SSR was developed by MOE and experts from the line agencies. The  work \nwas  supported  by  a  number  of  thematic  local  experts.  Consultations  were  carried  out  through  coordination  committees \nconstituted  at  central,  regional,  and  district  levels.  Workshops  were  conducted  at  central  and  regional  levels,  inviting  all \nstakeholders\u2014including  education  professionals,  nongovernment  organizations \nlawmakers,  organizations \nrepresenting child welfare, indigenous peoples, and gender and inclusion specialists. Intensive consultations were carried out \nat the district level and school level, involving political parties, school management committees (SMCs), village development \ncommittees  (VDCs),  NGOs,  teacher  unions,  parent-teacher  associations,  etc.  Stakeholder  consultation  entailed  a  lengthy \nprocess of consensus building among stakeholders with differing backgrounds and interests. \n\n(NGOs), \n\n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\nCommunities,  through  the  SMCs,  are  key  actors  in  school  governance.  In  community  managed  schools,  management \nresponsibility for school operations is undertaken by the community. Currently, about 8,000 schools have been turned over to \ncommunities. School-based management is planned to be strengthened through empowerment of SMCs, which will report to \nparents  on  school  performance  and  to  the  local  government  on  compliance  with  regulatory  requirements,  including  social \ninclusion, and financial and social audit. Local communities also play an active role in the provision of ECED education and \nliteracy programs. During implementation, DOE will also disclose to and consult with the relevant stakeholders at central level \nfor finalizing the annual strategic implementation plan (ASIP). Consultations will be organized at the district level for finalizing \nthe district education plans. At village level, the VDC will conduct consultations to finalize village education plans. \n\n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\nRoles  and  responsibilities  of  various  stakeholders  have  been  defined  throughout  the  SSR  plan.  In  line  with  increased \nresponsibilities for management at the school level, organizational capacity development activities under SSR heavily focus \non the development of capacity of local stakeholders.  \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues  \n\nNepal has achieved visible progress on a number of key education indicators during the period of EFA implementation, which \nemphasized  the  education  of  marginalized  groups.  The  net  enrollment  rate  at  primary  level  increased  from  81%  in  2001  to \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n91.9% in 2008 while the Gender Parity Index increased from 0.60 to 0.97 over the same period. The ratio of female teachers \nincreased from 1.2 per school in 2003 to  1.8 per school in 2008. However, despite an  increase in primary enrollment, girls' \nparticipation  in  higher  education  levels  is  less  than  boys  because  of  sociocultural  factors  including  restricted  mobility,  early \nmarriage, household work burden, and less importance given to girls\u2019 education. \n\n2.  Key  Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n\n   Gender  plan             \n\n   Other  actions/measures    (Gender  actions  have  been  incorporated  in  the  gender  and  vulnerable \n\ncommunities development framework)    \n\n  No action/measure \n\nThe SSR plan emphasizes gender inclusiveness. Guided by the legal and policy framework, the plan spells out the policies \nand  programs  to  enhance  the  participation  of  girl  students  and  female  teachers  at  different  levels,  such  as  ECED  centers, \nbasic  education,  and  secondary  education.  A  vulnerable  community  development  framework  is  adopted  by  the  Program  to \nprovide an enabling environment for girls to receive basic education. The framework includes a scholarship program for girls, \nespecially from marginalized caste and ethnic groups and regions, and improvements in basic facilities in schools to address \nthe  needs  of  girls,  such  as  separate  toilets  for  girls  and  boys.  Other  policy  provisions  are  made  to  increase  female \nparticipation  in  the  teaching  profession,  including  provisions  for  maternity  and  paternity  leave,  infant  feeding  breaks,  and \nprovision for substitute teachers. Affirmative action in governance and management will include proportional representation of \nwomen and people from disadvantaged groups on governance and management committees at all levels. Progress in gender \ninclusiveness will be monitored through the disaggregation of key performance indicators by gender. Specific gender-focused \nindicators have been included in the program design and monitoring framework.  \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nIssue \n\nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \n\nNo impact \n\nStrategy to Address Issue \n\nPlan  or  Other  Measures \nIncluded in Design \n\nThe Program will not require any \ninvoluntary resettlement.

The  Education  for  All  (EFA) \nthe \nprogram  (2004\u20132009)  has  achieved  good  progress \nachievements of the EFA program, inclusiveness of education has been an integral part of the \nschool  sector  reform  (SSR)  design  process.  Important  lessons  were  learned  from  the \nimplementation  and  evaluation  of  the  EFA  program.  Some  8%  of  the  current  school-going \npopulation  in  primary  (age  5\u20139)  and  about  25%  in  basic  education  (age  5\u201312)  remain  out  of \nschool.  Children  from  vulnerable  groups1 are  overrepresented  in  the  out-of-school  population \nand  remain  a  hard-to-reach  group.  Similarly,  children  from  vulnerable  groups  tend  to  repeat \nmore  and  drop  out  faster  than  average.  Regional  differences  in  education  outcomes  are  also \nrecognized.  Social  inclusion  issues  are  not  limited  to  students,  but  also  affect  teachers  and \nschool  management  committees.  Vulnerable  groups  are  underrepresented  in  both  categories. \nRecognizing  these  key  issues,  the  Government  has  incorporated  policies  and  strategies  to \naddress these issues in the design of SSR from the outset. \n\nthis  respect.  Building  on \n\n2. \nThe  vulnerable  communities  development  framework  (VCDF)  is  prepared  as  a \nsafeguard document to ensure that the SSR program is implemented with sufficient attention to \nissue  related  with  access,  equity,  quality  and  sustainability  of  education  services  for  the \nvulnerable  groups  and  that  these  groups  are  in  no  way  affected  adversely  due  to  program \ninterventions.  The  main  objective  of  the  framework  is  to  facilitate  and  reinforce  the  use  and \napplication  of  the  SSR  strategies  and  interventions  aiming  to  increase  inclusion  of  the \nvulnerable groups in education. \n\nThe  SSR  program  is  composed  of  seven  components  encompassing  the  following \n3. \nsubsectors  and  crosscutting  areas:  (i)  basic  education;  (ii)  secondary  education;  (iii)  early \nchildhood  education  and  development  (ECED);  (iv)  literacy  and  lifelong  learning;  (v)  technical \neducation  and  vocational  training;  (vi)  teacher  professional  development;  and  (vii)  capacity \ndevelopment;  management  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Social  inclusion  policies  and \nstrategies to ensure that vulnerable communities are reached are included in several of these \ncomponents. Priority interventions, targets and key results are summarized in the outline gender \nand vulnerable communities action plan in Table A10. \n\n4. \nBasic  education  and  secondary  education.  SSR  emphasizes  the  need  to  improve \naccess to education for girls and disadvantaged groups. A key policy to minimize the threshold \nof access to education is the provision of free basic education, including cost-free services for \nadmission,  textbooks,  tuition,  and  examinations.  The  policy  intent  under  SSR  is  to  make \nsecondary  education  gradually  free 2  by  2015.  To  address  financial  constraints  for  poor, \nmarginalized,  and  needy  children,  scholarships  and  other  support  are  provided  for  Dalits, \nmarginalized  groups,  disabled,  girls,  and  children  from  poor  households.  SSR  envisions \nproviding 13.5 million scholarships over 2010\u20132014 ranging from NRs350 for basic education to \nNRs1,700  for  secondary  education.  A  total  budget  of  $72  million  has  been  allocated  for  this \npurpose.  Girls\u2019  scholarships  will  target  6.6  million  scholarships  for  an  amount  of  $29  million  in \nbasic  education,  and  0.7  million  scholarships  for  girls  in  secondary  education,  amounting  to \n$14 million.  Free  alternative  programs  will  be  provided  for  students  who  cannot  attend  formal \n\n                                                 \n1   Vulnerable  groups  are  defined  as  Dalits,  girl  children,  ethnic  minorities,  linguistic  minorities,  children  from \nindigenous  groups,  children  with  disabilities,  working  children,  street  children,  conflict-affected  children,  calamity-\naffected children, children from remote regions, poor children, children with parents in prison, children rescued from \ntrafficking, and children of migrant parents. \n\n2   Free secondary education will include at least free services of admission and tuition fees. Textbooks and curricular \n\nmaterials will be made available at a subsidized rate. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f72 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nschools.  Special  provisions  will  be  made  to  cater  to  the  needs  of  public  school  students  in \nKarnali  Zone,  one  of  the  poorest  areas  in  the  country.  These  include  the  provision  of  free \neducation  up  to  grade  10,  and  additional  school  feeding  programs.  SSR  also  provides  for  the \nrecognition and support of caste and cultural education sources like Gumbas, Vihar, Madarsas, \nand  Gurukul,  which  will  contribute  to  the  education  of  children  not  attending  mainstream \neducation  institutions.  Norms  and  guidelines  that  define  the  various  types  of  formal  and \nnonformal  basic  education  services  have  been  developed.  Access  will  also  be  enhanced \nthrough  expansion  of  physical \nincluding  construction  of  19,500  classrooms; \nrehabilitation of 13,000 schools; construction of 300 libraries and laboratories; construction and \ntransformation  of  100 schools  for  children  with  special  needs;  and  upgrading  of  the  external \nenvironment (including separate toilets for girls and boys) of 7,000 schools.   \n\nfacilities, \n\nEarly  childhood  education  and  development.  To  increase  children\u2019s  access  to  and \n5. \nparticipation  in  ECED  programs,  emphasis  will  be  placed  on  expanding  ECED  services  in \ndisadvantaged  and  underserved  areas.  Locations  of  disadvantaged  populations\u2014including \nethnic minorities, women, Madhesis, endangered groups, and Dalits\u2014will be identified and they \nwill be given priority to ensure their access to the ECED program. Funding arrangements will be \nadjusted to the needs and financial capacity of communities.  \n\n6. \nLiteracy  and  lifelong  learning.  The  SSR  plan  intends  to  augment  the  neo-literacy \nprogram as a complementary intervention to the National Literacy Campaign, aimed at attaining \nthe EFA goal and MDGs on Universal Primary Education and literacy, with special emphasis on \ntargeted  groups  and  areas\u2014including  women,  marginalized  populations,  Dalits,  endangered \ncommunities, internally displaced people, people with disability, and people living with HIV/AIDS. \nIncome-generation programs targeting women, Dalits, ethnic minorities, and other marginalized \ngroups  will  be  introduced  along  with  neo-literacy  and  lifelong  learning  programs  through  an \nintegrated approach. \n\n7. \nTeacher  professional  development.  Affirmative  action  to  increase  the  number  of \nteachers  from  disadvantaged  groups  include  the  equitable  allocation  of  positions,  while \nrecruiting  teachers  and  personnel  in  management  positions  from  these  groups,  criteria  for \nteacher  selection  weighted  in  favor  of  candidates  from  these  groups,  and  mandatory \nrequirements  for  gender-separated  toilets  in  schools.  To  increase  female  participation  further, \nspecial  provisions  for  females  for  entry  into  the  teaching  profession  will  be  made.  These \nprovisions  include  promotion  criteria  weighted  in  favor  of  qualified  female,  Dalit,  and \ndisadvantaged teachers; and provisions for maternity and paternity leave, infant feeding breaks, \nand provision for substitute teachers. \n\nMonitoring  and  evaluation.  Monitoring  of  progress  will  be  regularly  conducted  by  the \n8. \nGovernment and development partners, as part of the regular program review process. A broad \nset  of  indicators  is  tracked  by  the  Government  through  the  biannual  Flash  reports.  Key \nindicators related to social inclusion have been included in the program design and monitoring \nframework.  Progress  will  be  monitored  through  the  collection  and  analysis  of  gender-\ndisaggregated data as appropriate. Policy provisions related to the introduction of free education, \nprovisions  for  alternative  schooling,  and  the  allocation  of  teacher  positions  to  female  teachers \nand  teachers  from  disadvantaged  social  groups  have  been  included  as  tranche  release \nconditions. The SSR program will be evaluated at midterm and at the end of the program. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n1. \n\n \n\nTable A10: Outline Gender and Vulnerable Communities Action Plan \n\nPriority Interventions \nBasic Education and Secondary Education \n\nTargets and Key Results \n\n  Provision of scholarships (NRs350 \nfor basic education to NRs1,700 \nfor secondary education)  \nProvision of incentives (school \nfeeding program) \n \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n  Provision of multilingual education, \nmother tongue education, and \ncurriculum development in local \nsubjects and mother tongue \nlanguages  \nImprovement of equitable access \nthrough construction activities \n\n \n\nScholarships for all students of Dalit community; all students of Karnali \nZone; and 50% of girls in the country (for basic education) and girls from \neconomically poor families (for secondary education); 17,500 disabled \nstudents; 175 children of martyrs\u2019 families.  \n\nSchool feeding program in Karnali Zone \n\nGender Parity Indexes for primary increased from 0.97 (2008) to 0.99 \n(2014), and for basic from 0.95 (2008) to 0.98 (2014)  \nMultilingual education implemented in 7,500 schools; 95 learning \nfacilitation materials produced in different languages. \nShare of out-of-school children aged 5\u201312 (overall, Dalit, disadvantaged \ngroups, poor, lagging districts) reduced from 25% (2008) to 10% (2014) \n\nConstruction of 19,500 classrooms; rehabilitation of 13,000 schools; \nconstruction of 300 libraries and laboratories; construction and \ntransformation of 100 schools for children with special needs and \nupgrading of the external environment (including separate toilets for girls \nand boys) of 7,000 schools.   \nDevelopment of norms and guidelines that define the various types of \nformal and nonformal basic education services  \n\n4. \n\n  Recognition and support of caste \n\nand cultural education sources like \nGumbas, Vihar, Madarsas, and \nGurukul \n\nEarly Childhood Education and Development \n5. \n\n  Locations of disadvantaged \npopulations including ethnic \nminorities, women, Madhesis, \nendangered groups, and Dalits will \nbe given priority in ECED \ndevelopment \n\nFunds will be provided for the establishment, operation, and sustenance \nof ECED centers in marginalized areas and poverty pockets.
