I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $20,000,000 to EDC Burgos Wind Power Corporation (EBWPC) for the 150-Megawatt \nBurgos Wind Farm Project in the Philippines.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n1.  Project Identification \n \n2.  In 2010, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the Philippines equaled 159 million tons of \ncarbon dioxide equivalent (tCO e).2 Electricity generation is the highest GHG-emitting sector, \n2\nprincipally because of the country\u2019s reliance on highly polluting forms of energy, such as coal \nand petroleum. Studies by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank indicate \nthat, under a business-as-usual scenario\u2014in which half of installed capacity comprises coal-\nfired plants\u2014annual GHG emissions from power generation will increase from less than 30 \nmillion tCO e  in 2007 to about 140 million tCO e in 2030, an increase of  over 400%.3 Almost all \n2 2\nthe coal and petroleum required to run the power plants is imported, which exposes the country \nto price volatility and fuel shortages. The resulting uncertainty regarding the availability and cost \nof  fuel  makes  it  challenging  to  invest  in  job-creating  energy-intensive  industries  (e.g., \nmanufacturing). \n \n3.  The Philippines is a leader in deploying conventional renewable energy. It is the second-\nlargest  producer  of  geothermal  energy  globally;  geothermal  and  hydropower  combined \ncontribute roughly 25% of the installed capacity in Luzon. To promote development of emerging \nrenewable  energy  (wind,  solar,  biomass,  and  ocean  sources),  the  Government  of  the \nPhilippines signed into law the Renewable Energy Act in December 2008, with the objective of \npromoting energy self-reliance and reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels for electricity \ngeneration.4 The Department of Energy (DOE) estimates that the country\u2019s untapped renewable \nenergy potential from emerging renewable energy sources is about 250,000 megawatts (MW). \nThe DOE is targeting about 2,870 MW of additional installed capacity from these sources by \n2030.5 To encourage investment in the sector, the Renewable Energy Act (i) provides fiscal \nincentives to emerging renewable energy projects;6 (ii) requires distribution utilities, electricity \ncooperatives, and retail energy suppliers (collectively,  \u201cCollection Agents\u201d) to source a certain \npercentage  of  their  fuel  requirements  from  renewable  energy  sources;  (iii)  makes  offtake \nagreements unnecessary, by stipulating that emerging renewable energy projects benefit from \npriority  (a)  connection  to  the  transmission  and  distribution  system,  and  (b)  purchase  and \ntransmission  of,  and  payment  for,  electricity  sold  through  the  grid;  and  (iv)  provides  that \nrenewable energy projects would be eligible to receive a fixed tariff under a feed-in-tariff (FIT) \n                                                           \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Senate Economic Planning Office. 2013.

An Assessment of Low-Carbon Interventions in the Transport and Power Sectors in the \nPhilippines. Results from Asia Pacific Energy Research Centre. 2006. Energy Demand and Supply Outlook 2006. \nTokyo  also points to similar carbon dioxideemission trends.  \n \n4  At the end of 2011, 49% of the Philippine\u2019s installed generating capacity was supplied by coal and oil, and just 1% \nby emerging renewable sources. \n5  National Renewable Energy Program. \n6  These incentives include (i) a 7-year income tax holiday, (ii) duty free importation of capital equipment, (iii) special \nrealty tax rate, and (iv) 0% value-added tax. ", "2 \n \nsystem.  However,  since  the  Renewable  Energy  Act  was  passed,  very  little  investment  in \nrenewable energy plants has been made due to delayed implementation of the FIT scheme. On \n27  July  2012,  the  Energy  Regulatory  Commission  (ERC)  announced  the  FIT  rates  and \ninstallation targets for each type of renewable energy source. A tariff of P8.53 per kilowatt-hour \nwas set for wind power, with an initial installation target of 200 MW.  \n \n4.  Following passage of the Renewable Energy Act in 2008, ADB has been approached by \nrenewable  energy  developers  for  potential  financial  support,  including  for  the  project.  The \nfollowing factors make the project a particularly attractive candidate for ADB support: (i) it has a \nstrong sponsor with a successful track record of developing, financing, constructing, owning, \nand operating power-generation projects in the Philippines; (ii) based on wind mapping by the \nUnited States National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the areas with the highest potential for \nenergy generation in the Philippines include the Ilocos region where the project is located7\u2014the \nproject will be the second wind farm in the country, with a capacity almost five times that of the \n33 MW Bangui Bay wind farm; (iii) it will contribute to diversification of the Luzon Grid fuel mix, \nwhich currently relies heavily on imported fossil fuels; and (iv) it helps satisfy growing power \ndemand without the use of fossil fuel-fired power plants, thereby avoiding an increase in GHG \nemissions commensurate with the increase in overall power generation. \n \n2.  Project Design \n5.  The components of the project are (i) installation of 50 3.0 MW wind turbine generators \n(WTGs)  and  ancillary  plant  equipment;  (ii)  construction  of  a  115-kilovolt  transmission  line, \napproximately 42 kilometers (km) in length; and (iii) construction of a substation in Burgos and \nthe expansion of an existing substation in Laoag City, Ilocos Norte. Construction of the project \nwas undertaken in two phases.8 The project was commissioned in November 2014.  \n \n3.  The Borrower and Sponsors \n6.  EBWPC  is  a  special-purpose  vehicle  incorporated  in  the  Philippines  specifically  to \ndevelop,  construct,  operate,  and  maintain  a  150  MW  grid-connected  wind  power  plant  in \nBurgos, Ilocos Norte. EBWPC is directly and wholly owned by EDC Wind Energy Holdings, a \nPhilippines holding company created to hold all of the wind power projects of the Energy \nDevelopment Corporation (EDC). EDC Wind Energy Holdings is a wholly owned subsidiary of \nEDC, which in turn is indirectly owned by the Lopez Holdings Corporation. EDC, a publicly listed \ncompany in the Philippines, is the largest geothermal energy producer in the country and also \nthe largest integrated steam and geothermal power producer in the world. It operates eight \ngeothermal steamfield projects that supply steam to 12 company-owned and subsidiary-owned \ngeothermal power plants with an aggregate installed capacity of 1,164 MW. EDC also partially \nowns and operates two hydropower plants with a combined installed capacity of 132 MW.  \n \n                                                           \n7  D. Eliot. 2000. Philippines Wind Energy Resource Atlas Development. Golden, Colorado: National Renewable \nEnergy Laboratory. \n8  The first phase consists of the installation of 29 WTGs with a generation capacity of 87 MW, and the construction \nof the transmission line and substation. Phase 2 consists of the installation of an additional 21 WTGs with a \ngeneration capacity of 63 MW. ", "3 \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impact \n7.  The government is promoting the increased environmental sustainability of the country\u2019s \nenergy mix by supporting alternative energy sources. The project supports this goal by reducing \nwaste, GHG emissions, and air pollutants compared with a conventional power plant. Improved \nair quality and a smaller carbon footprint will provide healthier and more sustainable living \nconditions for the people of the Philippines. \n \n8.  The  project  will  increase  energy  security  and  reduce  exposure  to  commodity  and \nexchange rate risk. This will help the country reduce its exposure to price volatility and the risk \nthat fuel supplies will be unavailable, thereby improving the investment climate for capital-\nintensive industries that generate employment. \n \n9.  Furthermore, the project is located in a rural area that will benefit from additional income \nand  employment  resulting  from  the  project\u2019s  construction  and  operation.  The  project  will \nprioritize the hiring of qualified local residents during construction and operation. \n \n10.  Finally, the DOE anticipates that there will be a generation shortfall in the Luzon Grid of \nabout 200\u2013450 MW by 2017.9 This project will help mitigate the long-term power generation \nshortfall faced by Luzon consumers. \n \n2.  Outcome \n11.  The project outcome is demonstration of the feasibility and sustainability of large-scale \nprivate  sector  wind  farms  in  the  country  under  the  new  FIT  regime,  which  will  help  the \nPhilippines accelerate and expand private sector investment in renewable energy infrastructure. \nThe project will also help to meet the government\u2019s target of 200 MW of wind power capacity. \n \n3.  Outputs \n12.  The output is the installation and operation of a 150 MW wind farm. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n13.  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, which supports ADB\u2019s investment in \ninfrastructure to meet growing energy demands in the region through renewable energy.10 \nUnder Strategy 2020, ADB infrastructure operations will promote a larger role for the private \nsector in infrastructure financing. This project, which is developed, owned, and operated entirely \nby the private sector, is consistent with that policy. \n \n                                                           \n9  C.

ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132016 for the Philippines aims to help the \ncountry achieve high, inclusive, and sustainable growth.11 The country partnership strategy \nsupports infrastructure development, including development of renewable energy. \n \n2.  Consistency with the Energy Policy \n15.  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which requires energy operations to \nbe  aligned  with  ADB's  overall  strategy,  which  emphasizes  energy  security,  facilitating  a \ntransition to a low-carbon economy, universal access to energy, and achieving ADB's vision of a \nregion free of poverty.12  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n16.  The ADB assistance consists of a direct loan of up to $20 million, without a government \nguarantee. The direct loan will be provided from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n17.  ADB\u2019s support for the project is justified based on the following: \n(i)  ADB\u2019s long involvement in energy sector development in the Philippines13 makes \nit a credible and effective facilitator of discussions related to the implementation \nof the country\u2019s FIT system. ADB is in a unique position to identify challenges to \nFIT system implementation, as faced by developers and other practitioners, and \nto communicate these through the public sector policy dialogue on the regulatory \nframework and sector management. \n(ii)  The international investment community is generally hesitant to invest in the \ncountry given its historically uncertain regulatory and political environment. ADB\u2019s \ninvolvement and strong relationship with the government will provide comfort to \ninternational investors, increase commercial bank participation, and help ensure \nthe government\u2019s long-term commitment to the sector. International investors are \nimportant for the project because they can provide US dollar funding, which is \nneeded to match the US dollar-linked component of the FIT. \n(iii)  The  innovative  financing  structure  of  the  project  can  be  replicated  by  other \nprivate  sector  investors  to  finance  the  development  and  construction  of \nrenewable energy projects in the country. \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n18.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory  B  for  environment,  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for \n                                                           \n11 ADB. 2011.

", "5 \n \nindigenous peoples. The potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been \nidentified and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts are incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. These environmental impacts are \ngenerally  site-specific,  reversible,  and  mostly  occur  during  the  construction  stage  where \nmitigation  measures  can  be  readily  designed  and  implemented.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination as well as an environmental management plan and monitoring program have been \nprepared.  Because  the  project  is  already  under  construction,  an  environmental  and  social \ncompliance audit was completed and appropriate measures to comply with ADB requirements \nwere put in place. Information disclosure and consultations with affected people were conducted \nin accordance with ADB requirements. The institutional capacity and commitment of EBWPC to \nmanage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed adequate. EBWPC will \nregularly submit environmental safeguards monitoring reports, including reports on the progress \nin implementing corrective actions relating to social safeguards. \n \n19.  The  climate  change  risk  has  been  assessed,  and  measures  to  address  the  risk \nincorporated in the project design.  \n \n20.  Other social dimensions. Based on the review and assessment of existing operations, \nhuman resource policies, and the current procedures for labor procurement and management, \nthe audit confirms that EBWPC\u2019s policies conform to national labor laws and regulations on the \nprotection of rights and the interests of women. EBWPC requires its contractors to engage local \nlabor, including women. ADB will ensure that investment documentation includes provisions \nrequiring  the  borrower  to  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and  to  take  specific  measures \n(including in relation to contractors) in line with internationally recognized core labor standards \nand in compliance with ADB\u2019s social protection strategy.14 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n21.  EBWPC was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n22.  The proposed ADB loan is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single-\nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n23.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank, 15  the \nGovernment of the Philippines will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the \nproposed assistance to EBWPC. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form \nand substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the ADB \nBoard of Directors. \n   \n                                                           \n14 ADB. 2003.
