The Project\nincludes (i) constructing an expressway and highway across\nflat to hilly terrain with connector roads to county towns; (ii)\nimproving local roads servicing poor villages of the project\narea; and (iii) providing consulting services and training to\nenhance  construction  quality,  road  safety,  and  project\nmonitoring  and  evaluation.  The  project  expressway  will\nsupport  the  Government\u2019s  Great  Western  Development\nStrategy by building an important link of the national trunk\nhighway  system  (NTHS)  in  GZAR  and  enhance  cross-\nborder trade with Viet Nam.\nClassification Thematic: Economic Growth\nEnvironment Assessment Category A\nAn  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was\nundertaken, and the summary EIA was circulated to the\nBoard of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)\non 2 May 2001.\nRationale ADB's country operational strategy for the PRC supports\nthe Government's policies in the road sector, which focus\non building roads that will promote economic and social\ndevelopment particularly in the poor areas of the country.\nGZAR is the fourth poorest of the PRC's 31 provinces. The\nproject  road  is  an  important  NTHS  connector  route  in\nGZAR, improving the access of the cities in the project\narea to Nanning, the capital of GZAR, and the southern\nseaports, and building an important link to the Viet Nam\nborder. As a result of ADB\u2019s policy dialogue, the scope of\nthe  Project  has  been  expanded  to  strengthen  its\ndevelopment  impact  by  adding  a  program  of\ncomplementary  road  upgrading,  and  targeting  poor\ncommunities  in  the  project  area.  The  Project  will  also\nfacilitate  regional  cooperation  by  improving  access\nbetween  PRC,  Viet  Nam,  and  other  countries  of  the\nGreater Mekong Subregion.\nObjectives and Scope The  Project  will  promote  sustainable  economic  growth,\nand, thus, contribute to poverty reduction, by improving\neconomic efficiency and reducing the cost of road transport\nin  the  southwestern  region  of  GZAR.  The  Project  will\nrelieve traffic congestion and bottlenecks on a key section", "iii\nof the NTHS, and provide better access to growth centers\nfor  poor  communities.  Specifically,  the  Project  will  (i)\nprovide additional transport capacity, alleviate congestion\nand reduce traffic accidents and vehicle operating costs;\n(ii)  improve  access  for  the  poor  rural  population  in  the\ntransport corridor; and (iii) facilitate regional cooperation by\nproviding better access between the PRC and Viet Nam.\nThe Project will also support sector reforms initiated under\nprevious and ongoing ADB-financed projects and regional\ninitiatives. The project scope includes (i) construction of\n136  km  of  four-lane  access-controlled  tollway  between\nNanning  (Wuxu)  and  Ninming  and  a  further  43  km  of\nhighway  between  Ninming  and  Youyiguan,  including\ninterchanges with toll stations, connecting roads, tunnels,\nbridges, administrative stations, service areas, and 49 km\nof connecting roads; (ii) improvement of about 507 km of\nlocal  roads  servicing  poor  areas;  (iii)  procurement  of\nequipment for maintenance, toll collection, surveillance and\ncommunications, vehicle axle load testing, and road safety;\n(iv) land acquisition and resettlement; and (v) consulting\nservices and capacity building.\nCost Estimates ($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nItem Exchange Currency Cost\nA.

I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Guangxi Roads Development Project.\nII .  INTRODUCTION\n2. Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance for the transport sector in the PRC includes\nthe construction or upgrading of strategic roads to promote economic growth and poverty\nreduction.  The  proposed  road  project  will  connect  Nanning,  capital  of  the  Guanxi  Zhuang\nAutonomous Zone (GZAR), and Youyiguan, at the Viet Nam border. The main road project and\nthe associated complementary road program will provide improved access between poverty\nareas  and  market  centers,  and  support  the  economic  and  social  development  of  the\nsouthwestern part of GZAR, which is one of the PRC\u2019s poorest provinces. The project road is\npart of the national trunk highway system (NTHS) connecting to National Route No.1 in Viet\nNam, and will thus facilitate regional cooperation.\n3. During ADB's 2000 Country Programming Mission, the Government confirmed its request\nfor assistance for the Project. A feasibility study was prepared by the Guangxi Communications\nPlanning,  Survey,  and  Design  Institute.  An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  and  a\nresettlement plan were undertaken by the Xi\u2019an Highway University. ADB provided technical\nassistance  (TA)1  to  supplement  the  Government  studies.  Fact-finding  for  the  Project  was\nundertaken from 8 to 21 February 2001, and appraisal from 17 to 30 April 2001.2 The Project has\nbeen  formulated  based  on  the  findings  of  the  ADB  missions,  information  provided  by  the\nGovernment,  beneficiary  consultations,  discussions  with  other  funding  agencies,  and\nrecommendations of the feasibility study and TA consultants. The logical framework that outlines\nthe goal, purpose, outputs, and inputs or activities is in Appendix 1. A proposal for poverty\nreduction in southern Guangxi was prepared by the Government for financing under the Japan\nFund for Poverty Reduction.\nII I.  BACKGROUND3\n4. Investment  in  transport  infrastructure,  and  especially  roads,  together  with  capital\ninvestments,  provides  a  key  boost  to  local,  regional,  and  national  economies.  These\ninvestments stimulate economic growth, which generates higher standards of living over the\nlong term. Many of the PRC's rural poor reside in partial or full isolation, which makes transport\ncostly for them and therefore restricts their ability to access basic goods and services. Lack of\naccess deprives the poor of their ability to take advantage of job opportunities. Investment in\nroad projects is a catalyst to reduce poverty for access improvements have a strong income\neffect.\n                  \n1 TA 3220-PRC: Guangxi Highway Development Project, for $540,000, approved on 12 July 1999.\n2  The appraisal mission comprised P. Giraud, Sr. Transport Specialist/Mission Leader; F. Agnello, Poverty Reduction\nSpecialist; E. Brotoisworo, Sr. Environment Specialist; I. Choi, Sr. Financial Analyst; P. Poinsignon, Transport\nSpecialist; S. Price, Sr. Social Development Specialist; D. Sobel (Sr. Programs Officer); and Y. Zhu, Resettlement\nConsultant.\n3  This section of the report is similar to the equivalent section in the Shaanxi Roads Development Project, which was\nalso formulated for Board consideration in 2001.", "2\nA.  Sector Description\n1.  Transport\na. Infrastructure and Traffic\n5. Implementation of the Government's economic reform policies since 1978 has resulted in\nrapid growth of the PRC economy, and a corresponding increase in the demand for transport\nservices. Despite the Government's efforts to increase the country's transport capacity, serious\nconstraints and bottlenecks remain, especially in the road subsector. By the end of 2000, the PRC\ntransport system comprised about 68,000 kilometers (km) of railways, 1.4 million km of highways,\n119,300 km of inland waterways, and 1.5 million km of civil aviation routes. However, the density\nof the transport network in the PRC ranks among the lowest in the world relative to population or\ngeographic area.  In terms of density per square kilometer of land area, the PRC's transport\nnetwork is one sixth of India's network and one fifth of that of the Republic of Korea.\n6. Between 1990 and 2000, when economic growth averaged 10.2 percent per annum,\ndomestic passenger transport in all modes grew by 8.0 percent per annum in passenger-km.\nFreight transport in all modes grew at 5.2 percent per year in ton-km. Road traffic increased its\nshare of traffic and grew at 9.7 percent per annum for passenger traffic and 5.9 percent per\nannum for freight. In 2000, road traffic accounted for 54.2 percent of total passenger-km,\nfollowed by railways with 36.8 percent, civil aviation with 8.2 percent, and coastal and inland\nwaterways  with  0.8  percent.  The  modal  split  for  freight  ton-km  was  coastal  and  inland\nwaterways, 52.8 percent; railways, 31.2 percent; roads, 13.7 percent; pipelines, 2.2 percent;\nand civil aviation, 0.1 percent. Since 1990, the railway share of freight traffic has declined by 9.3\npercentage points, while the road share has increased by 0.9 percentage points and the inland\nwaterways by 8.6 percentage points. The reduced share of the railway and the increased share\nof road transport are consistent with trends in other countries, where, as incomes increase, the\nshare of power, roads, and telecommunications in infrastructure expenditures rises, and that of\nwater, irrigation, and railways falls.4 Increase in transport demand will be concentrated around\nand between major cities and in transport corridors serving the ports and their hinterlands. An\nincreasing share of the movement of goods and passengers will be by road, as road transport is\nmore flexible and responsive than other modes to needs in a market economy. In addition, car\nownership is growing, and an increasing proportion of passengers will travel by road.\n7. At the end of 2000 GZAR had about 3,120 km of railways, 52,910 km of highways, and\n5,620 km of navigable inland waterways. From 1990 to 2000, domestic passenger transport in\nall modes grew by 10.3 percent per annum in passenger-km and freight transport grew at 6.1\npercent per annum in ton-km. Road traffic increased its share of traffic and grew at 13.1 percent\nper annum for passenger traffic and 6.0 percent per annum for freight. In 2000, road traffic\naccounted for 74.9 percent of total passenger-km, followed by railways with 24.6 percent and\ncoastal and inland waterways with 0.5 percent. The modal split for freight ton-km was railways\n62.9 percent, roads 27.2 percent and inland waterways 9.9 percent. Since 1990, the railway and\nroad shares of freight traffic have stayed about the same, while the railway share of passenger\ntraffic has declined by 13.6 percentage points, and the road share has increased by 17.0\npercentage points (Appendix 2).\n                  \n4 Ingram, Gregory, and Marianne Fay. 1994. Valuing Infrastructure Stocks and Gains from Improved Performance.\nBackground paper for the World Development Report 1994. Washington: World Bank.", "3\nb. Investments\n8. Public transport investment was about 2.3 percent of the gross national product in 2000. A\nWorld Bank study5 indicated that total transport investment should increase to at least 3.6 percent\nof  the  gross  national  product  to  avoid  the  economic  costs  associated  with  congestion  and\nbottlenecks. If not removed, transport bottlenecks will continue to be a major constraint to efficient,\nsustained economic growth. In the wake of the Asian financial crisis, the PRC has implemented a\nstrategy to stimulate domestic demand. As part of this strategy, the Government developed a Y10\ntrillion infrastructure investment program from 1998 to 2000 to help ease the transport constraints.\nThis program included projects in urban and rural areas and investments in housing and roads. It\nwill  be  difficult  for  the  Government  to  sustain  this  level  of  investment  even  with  official\ndevelopment assistance sources. An increasing proportion of financing will have to come from\ndomestic and international private sector sources. Further reforms are needed in transport policy,\nregulation, and pricing to encourage financing from such sources, reduce inefficiencies, and\ncapture the benefits of a more balanced intermodal transport system.\nc. Institutions\n9. At the national level, the State Development Planning Commission formulates five-year\ndevelopment plans and establishes priorities and targets for transport in consultation with the\nministries responsible for the transport subsectors and with representatives of transport users.\nThe Ministry of Communications (MOC) is responsible for national highways, inland waterways,\ncoastal shipping, and major ports; the Ministry of Railways for the national rail system; and the\nCivil Aviation Administration for air transport and airports. In line with the country's decentralization\npolicies,  many  of  the  administrative  and  operational  functions  have  been  devolved  to  the\nprovincial  communications  departments  (PCDs).6  MOC  provides  guidance  to  the  provincial\ngovernments. Its main responsibilities include planning and coordinating transport investments,\nand formulating transport policies. MOC shares financing for the national highway system with\nprovincial governments, contingent on the latter using MOC-prescribed road design standards.\n2. The Road Subsector\na.  Road Network\n10. The PRC road network had about 1.4 million km of roads at the end of 2000, but is\nunderdeveloped in both quality and extent. While 51,000 km of new roads were opened to traffic\nin 2000, including 4,709 km of expressways,7 expressways and class I highways still account for\nonly 2.6 percent of the total road network, and class II highways for about 10.9 percent. The\nremaining 86.5 percent (class III highways and below) are medium- to low-grade paved roads and\ngravel roads. With only about 1,100 km of classified roads per million inhabitants, the density of\nthe PRC's road network is low.8 Many roads are constructed to low design standards and have\nneither the capacity nor the structural strength to carry current traffic volumes and loads. Roads\n                  \n5 World Bank. 1998. China: Forward with One Spirit: A Strategy for the Transport Sector. Report No. 1595-CHA.\nTransport Sector Unit, East Asia and Pacific Regional Office, Washington, DC.\n6 Including  the  municipal  communications  bureaus  or  commission  of  autonomous  municipalities,  and  the\ncommunications departments of autonomous regions.\n7 The total length of the expressway network reached 16,300 km at the end of 2000, which is similar to that in\nCanada, and ranking only after the United States.\n8  Comparative figures for other geographically large countries in terms of kilometer of road per million inhabitants are\nabout 25,300 km for the United States and 1,800 km for India. In Japan, where arable land is in equally short\nsupply, there are 90 square meters of road per capita, compared with 20 in the PRC and 496 in the United States.", "4\ntend to be congested and pavements show signs of roughness and failure. GZAR has about\n1,100 km of classified roads per million inhabitants, in line with the national average, but with\nlower average standard. At the end of 2000, of GZAR's 52,910 km of roads, only 2.3 percent\nwere expressway or class I, and 5.0 percent class II. The remaining 92.7 percent were lower\ngrade roads, including 31.4 percent of class III highways and 61.3 percent of class IV highways\nor below. In the project area, the road conditions are as poor as in the rest of GZAR, with 62\npercent of class IV highways or below.\nb. Vehicle Fleet and Traffic\n11. In 2000, the PRC vehicle fleet totaled 15.5 million trucks, cars, and buses, and 46.5 million\nother motorized vehicles (special vehicles, tractors, and motorcycles). The total number of trucks,\ncars, and buses increased by about 1.3 million in 2000, with the market share for trucks dropping\nto 45.0 percent, down from 66.8 percent in 1990. Despite the rapid increase in total vehicles, the\nPRC has only about 1.3 vehicles (trucks, cars or buses) for 100 persons, which is low relative to\nother countries in the Asian and Pacific region.9 Not until the early 1980s were modern vehicles\nimported and joint ventures formed with foreign automobile manufacturers to introduce modern\ntechnology. There are plans to invest up to $7 billion in automotive manufacturing in the PRC\nbetween 2000 and 2005. The PRC\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization should increase\ninvestment in automobile production. The modernization of the vehicle fleet will improve vehicle\nsafety and reduce fuel consumption and vehicle emissions. In 2000 the GZAR had 308,100\ntrucks and passenger vehicles, equal to 2 percent of the national fleet. This translates into 0.65\nvehicles per 100 people in GZAR, half the national average. Growth in the number of vehicles in\nGZAR during the 1990s, at about 10 percent per annum, was lower than the national average of\nabout 12 percent per annum. This reflects the fact that GZAR is a poor region.\n12. The privately owned fleet of motor vehicles in the PRC increased more than 20 times\nduring 1985-2000, from 0.3 million vehicles to 6.3 million. In 2000, trucks accounted for 41 percent\nof the total privately owned vehicles; cars and buses, 58 percent; and other special vehicles, 1\npercent. In GZAR, privately owned motor vehicles totaled 138,700 in 2000. Given the PRC's rapid\neconomic growth and low vehicle ownership, the vehicle fleet, both public and private, is expected\nto continue to grow rapidly in the coming years. This will result in substantial increase in the\nvolume of road traffic and mounting congestion. The high share of slow-moving traffic, mainly\ntractors, bicycles, and nonmotorized agricultural vehicles, aggravates road congestion and is a\nmajor cause of traffic accidents.\nc. The Road Transport Industry\n13. The PCDs are responsible for regulating the road transport industry by licensing drivers,\nvehicles, and intercity bus services. Road transport tariffs are subject to controls in the range of\nplus or minus 20 percent of locally established tariffs. The relaxation of trucking regulations in the\n1980s allowed privately owned trucks to haul cargo for state-owned factories and cooperatives.\nPrivately owned trucks absorbed most of the traffic growth in the 1990s with the market share of\nstate-owned transportation companies  declining.  The  resulting  competition  is  improving  road\ntransport efficiency and the quality of services. ADB supported this process through TA.10 MOC is\nencouraging the private sector to augment the overall capacity of the road transport industry. The\nannual passenger handling capacity increased from 12.0 billion passengers in 1997 to 14.5 billion\n                  \n9  Figures for other countries are 2.5 for India, 5.0 for Indonesia, 14.3 for Thailand, 59.6 for Australia, and 65.3 for\nJapan.\n10TA 1940-PRC: Efficiency Improvements in Road Transport, for $550,000, approved on 25 August 1993.", "5\nin 2000. About 900,000 buses were operating in 2000 compared with 764,000 in 1994. About\n85,000 bus routes served more than 94 percent of the villages accessible by road.\nd.  Road Administration\n14. Road administration in the PRC is decentralized. At the provincial level, the PCDs are\nresponsible for the highway networks and plan, budget, and finance road projects. The PCDs\nare generally financially independent of the central Government except for large projects of\nnational significance. MOC provides policy guidance and technical support to the PCDs through\nnational  policies,  regulations,  and  design  and  construction  standards.  Provincial  planning\ncommissions approve development plans and projects. The PCDs, through their city, prefecture,\nand county-level units, are responsible for planning and administering the road subsector,\nincluding constructing and maintaining the road network. Road safety is mainly the responsibility\nof the Ministry of Public Security at the national and local government levels. Testing of vehicles\nand  vehicle  emissions  is  the  responsibility  of  local  environmental  protection  bureaus  in\nconjunction with provincial public security bureaus. The road subsector agencies are generally\nwell staffed with trained technical personnel, particularly at the central and provincial levels.\nHuman resource development systems provide regular training for technical staff, operators,\nand technicians. ADB has supported human resource development in subsector institutions\nunder loans and TAs. ADB\u2019s country assistance program evaluation for the PRC concluded that,\nin the transport sector, executing agencies (EAs) have been making good use of the knowledge\ntransfer and in-country and external training opportunities provided under ADB projects.11\ne. Road Subsector Revenues and Expenditures\n15. The PRC's road investment needs from 1996 to 2010 are estimated at $504 billion.\nAvailable revenues are estimated at $302 billion from road user charges and $29 billion from toll\ncollections, leaving a financing gap of $173 billion or about $12 billion per year. Consistent with\nADB's policy dialogue, the Government is creating a framework to attract private sector finance for\nroad construction. While the private sector is willing to participate under concession agreements,\nor in refinancing, leasing, and securitization, it has not participated in many build-operate-transfer\n(BOT) type projects that entail taking the initial risks of construction and traffic demand. Private\nsector financing is most likely to be available to finance about 5 percent of the high-grade and\nprovincial road networks.\n16. Expenditures  in  highway  infrastructure  are  financed  from  dedicated  user  charges,\nGovernment grants, domestic bank loans and bonds, and foreign loans and investments. Two\ndedicated user charges, the road maintenance fee and the vehicle purchase fee, have provided\nmuch of the financing for the road subsector. During the Ninth Five-Year Plan, 1996-2000, the\nroad maintenance fee, levied on the revenue of freight and passenger transport companies and\non the load capacity of private vehicles, provided about 53 percent of total financing requirements\nof road investments. Revenues from the vehicle purchase fee, levied on the retail price of\nvehicles, financed about 13 percent, mostly in poorer provinces as government policy. MOC\nprovided  supplementary  financing  of  about  2  percent  of  the  requirements  to  construct  or\nrehabilitate rural roads in poverty areas. Domestic loans and bond financing, generally with short\nmaturities, were still relatively low, and accounted for 9 percent of all highway investments. Other\ndomestic investments, including financing from local governments and state-owned enterprises,\naccounted for 12 percent of the requirements. Foreign loans cover 8 percent of the investment in\nhighway construction, and foreign direct investment the remaining 3 percent. During the 1980s\n                  \n11 CAP: PRC 98026: Country Assistance Program Evaluation, People\u2019s Republic of China, December 1998.", "6\nand 1990s, the PRC increased its foreign borrowing for infrastructure, mainly from ADB, the\nJapan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and the World Bank (paras. 28-29).\n17. As  part  of  a  tax  reform  to  bring  off-budget  revenues  and  expenditures  within  the\nframework of the national budget, the National People\u2019s Congress amended the Highway Law\non 31 October 1999. The amendments laid the foundation for future legislation providing for\nnational taxes to replace provincial and local fees. The vehicle purchase fee was replaced by\nthe vehicle purchase tax effective January 2001, and a fuel tax is expected to replace the road\nmaintenance fee, and generate a similar or higher level of revenue. Based on findings of an\nADB-financed  TA,12  the  fuel  tax  is  likely  to  improve  financing  of  the  road  subsector.  The\nGovernment  prepared  detailed  measures  for  introducing  the  fuel  tax,  but  delayed  its\nimplementation due to the high international price of oil. Implementation is now expected to take\nplace before the end of 2001 if international oil price declines. The amendments also prohibit\nlocal governments from levying on some roads tolls that are not authorized. Thus, arbitrary\ncharges in the road subsector that are a regressive tax impacting most heavily on the poor will\nbe eliminated. Also, transparency and accountability in the use of such off-budget funds were\nweak. Fiscal accountability is expected to improve with the replacement of these off-budget\nrevenues with a fuel tax that is subject to the oversight and control mechanisms built into the\nfiscal process.\n18. Within each province, the PCD is responsible for planning, financing, and constructing\nnational and provincial roads. County and village roads are the responsibility of the prefecture,\ncounty,  and  township  governments.  Since  the  resources  of  the  local  governments  are\nconstrained, the adequate financing of roads among competing claims is a major challenge,\nparticularly for local roads in poverty counties. The PCD generally provides budgetary support\nfor county road construction and improvement. However, an increasing proportion of provincial\nroad  budgets  is  being  used  to  meet  the  national  priority  for  expressway  and  highway\nconstruction. In GZAR the proportion of expressway funding in the provincial road budget\nincreased from 16 percent to 39 percent in the last five years, while the proportion for county\nand township roads declined from 84 percent to 61 percent. However, in 2000 the GZAR\ngovernment allocated additional funds to upgrade local roads in poor areas. The funding of road\nand other infrastructure improvements in rural areas is supplemented by poverty alleviation\nfunds allocated separately. The scope of the proposed Project includes upgrading high priority\nlocal roads, financed by these additional funds. The inclusion of local roads in the project scope\nwill help ensure that expenditures are reasonably balanced between expressways and local\nroads. Revenues and expenditures in the road sector in GZAR in 1998-2000 are included in\nAppendix 3.\nf. Road Engineering, Construction, and Maintenance\n19. Road and bridge projects are designed by the planning and design institutes at the\nprovincial, prefectural, and county levels. MOC reviews the designs of expressways, class I\nhighways, and associated structures. In general, the institutes are staffed with experienced, well\nqualified personnel. Construction is supervised by personnel from county, city, and prefectural\nhighway units. The city and county highway bureaus have their own construction units to carry out\nminor projects within their administrative districts. Drawing on the experience gained under ADB-\nand World Bank-financed projects, competitive bidding practices were mandated by the 1999\nTendering and Bidding Law (para. 42). Many of the larger provincial and urban construction\nbureaus are being reorganized into financially independent companies and have been awarded\n                  \n12 TA 3086-PRC: Regional Road Sector Study, for $1.185 million, approved on 13 October 1998.", "7\ncontracts individually or as partners in joint ventures on several previous ADB- and World Bank-\nfinanced highway projects in the PRC or overseas.\n20. In 1999, MOC implemented a series of measures to enhance quality control in highway\nconstruction and carried out two nationwide quality audits of the construction of national highways\nand  major  trunk  roads.  From  1999,  as  required  by  MOC,  all  PCDs,  including  the  Guangxi\nCommunications Department (GCD), are inspecting the quality of their ongoing road construction\nworks. Taking into account findings of the audits, MOC will adopt more stringent regulations to\nensure that roads are constructed to national standards. Investment will be increased in regions\nthat have completed good quality roads that are well managed and well maintained. Regions with\nprojects of substandard quality due to inappropriate technical design or poor implementation will\nreceive decreased investment.\n21. Road maintenance is well organized and is carried out mainly through labor-intensive\noperations. Maintenance expenditures have decreased as a percentage of total road expenditures\nin the past decade (however, maintenance is generally adequate). MOC has established an\nadvanced  road  maintenance  management  system,  consisting  of  a  road  data  bank  and  a\npavement management system. It is being introduced in stages to all provinces, autonomous\nregions, and municipalities, including GZAR, and will become the key tool for programming future\nmaintenance needs and budgets.\n3. Transport and Poverty Reduction\n22. The impact of transport infrastructure investments on poverty reduction is demonstrated\nby recent studies that examined the effectiveness of government expenditure on various sectors\nin contributing to growth and poverty reduction, using an econometric model, in India and\nIndonesia.13 The studies concluded that government expenditure on roads has a larger impact\non poverty reduction, productivity, and growth than does expenditure on other sectors, such as\nirrigation, soil and water, power, education, and health. Labor is the major resource of the poor.\nFor the poor to be able to capitalize on their major asset, they need access to jobs and to\ntransport for bringing the goods they produce to markets. Benefits for poor rural areas include\nlower transport costs, lower cost of inputs, better access to services and therefore improved\nfarming practices, and better access to health and education. This was also highlighted in World\nBank reports.14\n23. In the PRC, the link between transport development and poverty reduction is supported\nby studies and evaluation of several completed transport projects, financed by ADB and the\nWorld Bank. In Shaanxi Province, TA15 showed the linkage between road density and rural\nincomes from 1990 to 1999: the higher the road density, the higher the per capita rural incomes.\nIn Liaoning Province,16 construction of a 109 km expressway with 203 km of local roads was\nassociated with rural incomes more than doubling in the project area. Similarly, impressive\nimprovements in living standards have been experienced in the areas of influence of two railway\n                  \n13  Shenggen Fan, Peter Hazell, and Sukhadeo Thorat. 1999.

The poor have limited\nmobility beyond their immediate communities because of geographical isolation and the high\ncost of motorized transport. As a result, the poor view roads as key infrastructure needed for\naccelerating  socioeconomic  development.  Rural  poor  benefit  from  greater  employment\nopportunities, and the transition from subsistence farming to cash crop and higher value crops,\nwhich results in a more stable income flow and leads to poverty reduction. Better roads also\naddress the nonincome dimensions of poverty. Improved access helps attract resident teachers\nand  health  personnel,  and  facilitates  visits  by  specialists  to  health,  education,  and  other\ncommunity facilities within the villages. It also facilitates visits of villagers to such facilities\noutside the villages. An ongoing TA19 recommended setting up a special mechanism to fund\nrural infrastructure pilot schemes in the PRC, including roads, to investigate the direct and\nindirect effects on poverty reduction. This is being carried out in Guizhou Province where rural\nroads, in addition to other rural infrastructure, are being built in poor villages, and the effects of\nsuch infrastructure systematically measured, monitored, and evaluated. A regional TA20 is being\nimplemented to further examine the poverty reduction impact of infrastructure projects. The\n2002 PRC TA program includes a study to assess in detail the linkage between transport\ninfrastructure and poverty.\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n24. The heart of the road network is the NTHS, a system of interprovincial expressways and\nhigh-class highways of about 35,000 km, to be constructed over a 20-year period up to 2010. The\nNTHS will be complemented by the development of a network of new national, provincial, county,\nand village roads. The Government views road development as a key component of its strategy to\nimprove access to markets and services. In particular, the Government's investment plans for the\nroad subsector consider the need to provide infrastructure to facilitate economic growth and\nreduce poverty. The Government's policies for road development are based on the following\nprinciples: (i) constructing expressways to expand the NTHS to link all cities with a population of\nmore than 500,000; (ii) developing secondary roads, particularly those that will help reduce\npoverty and promote rural markets; and (iii) building roads that will support regional cooperation\nwith neighboring countries in the southwest, northeast, and northwest.\n25. The  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan  (10FYP),  2001-2005,  approved  by  the  National  People\u2019s\nCongress, calls for (i) accelerating the construction of the backbone network of highways and\nnational roads, with the focus being on five north-south and seven east-west expressways\nincluded in the NTHS, and fully opening three north-south and two east-west expressways; (ii)\nachieving the initial construction of eight new highways in the western region to improve the\nstructure  of  the  highway  network  and  its  reach  (para.  27);  and  (iii)  by  2005,  having\napproximately 1.6 million km of highways open to traffic, with expressways accounting for\n25,000 km. The 10FYP will support highway construction in the rural areas to improve road\n                  \n17 PCR: PRC 26462: Jing-Jiu Railway Technical Enhancement Project, April 2000, and PCR: PRC 22276: Hefei-\nJiujiang Railway Project, February 2000.\n18 Hatim Hajj and V.

The  Government  has  been  supporting  poverty  reduction  through  road  subsector\ninvestments in several ways. First, the focus of NTHS construction has been shifting to the central\nand southwest regions, which have a higher incidence of poverty. Second, the vehicle purchase\nfee, which has financed about 13 percent of road subsector expenditures, has been allocated\nprimarily  to  poorer  provinces  for  financing  road  investments.  Third,  MOC  grants  and  PCD\nresources are used to supplement budgets of county and township governments to improve\ntownship  roads.  Fourth,  through  the  separate  budgeting  of  poverty  alleviation  funds,  road\nimprovements are carried out to bring an increasing number of villages into the road network, by\nimproving the quality of transport services available to them.\n27. In  March  2000,  the  Government  adopted  the  long-term  Great  Western  Development\nStrategy for developing the western part of the country.21 This strategy has been reflected as the\nkey theme of the 10FYP. The strategy aims to reduce development disparities between the\nwestern region and the coastal region, and to give the highest priority to road development as an\neffective  mean  to  promote  economic  growth  and  reduce  poverty  in  the  region.  In  the  road\nsubsector, the strategy aims at (i) facilitating economic development and poverty reduction in the\nwestern region, where road density is only less than half of the national average; (ii) linking the\nwestern region with the central and eastern regions; (iii) providing access to the trade outlets for\nthe western region at the eastern and southern seaports; and (iv) promoting regional cooperation\nwith the neighboring countries to the west and southwest of the PRC. ADB is providing TA22 to\nhelp the Government implement the Great Western Development Strategy. ADB\u2019s 2001 program\nincludes TA to help the Government identify ways to attract foreign direct investment to the\nwestern region.\nC. External Assistance to the Subsector\n28. External assistance to the road subsector has come mainly from ADB, JBIC, and the\nWorld Bank. Since 1985, the World Bank has provided about $5.3 billion to finance 22 highway\nprojects and 6 urban transport projects. The projects supported (i) priority sections of the NTHS,\nparticularly in the central and northwestern regions; and (ii) capacity building in construction\nsupervision, quality control, design and planning, road safety, and pavement management. JBIC\nhas provided about $990 million equivalent for six bridge projects and five highway projects within\nthe NTHS framework, mostly in the central region. ADB's policy dialogue in the road subsector\nand identification of projects are coordinated with JBIC and the World Bank.\n29. Since 1991, ADB has provided 18 loans totaling nearly $3.2 billion for 2,644 km of\nhighway development, and two loans totaling $155 million for bridges in Shanghai. The Nanpu\nand Yangpu bridges are open to traffic, and traffic volumes have exceeded the appraisal\nestimates. Among the road projects financed by ADB, 10 are completed and open to traffic.23\nMost expressway projects are being implemented ahead of the original construction schedules.\n                  \n21 Consisting of 12 provinces, autonomous regions, or municipality: Chongqing, Gansu, Guangxi; Guizhou, Inner\nMongolia, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Xinjiang, Xizang, and Yunnan, and three prefectures: Enshi Tujia\nand Miao Minority Autonomous prefecture of Hubei province, Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Minority Autonomous\nprefecture of Hunan province, and Yanbian Korean Minority Autonomous prefecture of Jilin Province.\n22TA 3468-PRC: Policy Support for PRC 2020 Project (Phase III), for $900,000, approved on 14 July 2000.\n23Hebei  Expressway,  Hebei  Roads,  Heilongjiang  Expressway,  Hunan  Expressway,  Jiangxi  Expressway,  Jilin\nExpressway,  Liaoning  Expressway,  Shenyang-Benxi  Highway,  Shenyang-Jinzhou  Expressway,  and  Yunnan\nExpressway Development.", "10\nThe EAs have a good record of complying with the major loan covenants, including the timely\nsubmission of audited project accounts. ADB has also provided 21 project preparatory TA grants\ntotaling $9.1 million and 19 advisory TA grants totaling $11.8 million to the road subsector. The\nadvisory TAs have supported the development of road infrastructure by addressing policy and\ninstitutional  issues,  including  highway  planning,  road  safety,  human  resource  development,\ntransport  pricing,  commercialization  and  corporatization  of  enterprises,  and  mobilization  of\nnongovernment financial resources.\nD. Lessons Learned\n30. ADB's experience in the PRC's road subsector has shown that the project preparation and\nimplementation  capability  of  the  agencies  concerned  is  strong.  In  general,  all  loans  to  the\nsubsector are being implemented satisfactorily. The technical staff have adequate capabilities for\ndesign  and  construction  supervision,  and  most  local  contractors  have  proven  competent.\nHowever, they need to acquire expertise in modern construction methods such as those for\nconstructing long tunnels, large bridges, and flexible pavement design; modern operations such\nas toll collection methods and environmental protection; and commercial business practices. The\nuse of ADB loan and TA funds to upgrade the capabilities of the EAs has contributed to improved\nproject quality. However, to meet the implementation schedule, contractors are sometimes put\nunder pressure and consequently the bidding process, contract management, and construction\nquality  are  compromised.  This  might  have  contributed  to  the  collapse  of  tunnels  during\nconstruction of some ADB-financed expressways. Insufficient time allowed for soil settlement may\nhave adversely affected pavement quality. ADB has taken these matters up as part of the policy\ndialogue with MOC and the EAs (para. 42).\n31. Traffic  volumes  for  completed  projects  have  generally  grown  faster  than  appraisal\nforecasts. The project completion reports of ADB-financed expressways in the PRC concluded\nthat four projects were generally successful,24 and one was partly successful, mainly due to\ninadequate safety facilities and enforcement as well as partial compliance with environmental\nmitigation measures.25 The reports recommended that the EAs strengthen road safety measures\nand increase benefit monitoring activities. International consulting inputs for a safety audit and for\nmonitoring and evaluation are included in the proposed Project. The project performance audit\nreport26 of two ADB-financed expressways in the PRC concluded that one project was successful\nand  the  other  highly  successful.  One  of  the  key  lessons  identified  in  the  report  is  that\ncorporatization (restructuring of government departments as corporations) of the expressway in\nJilin Province was an effective option for resolving funding shortfalls and ultimately contributing\ntoward financing future expressway development. Under the proposed Project, GCD will establish\na  state-owned  corporation.  GCD  will  be  the  sole  investor,  and  the  corporation  will  be\nresponsible  for  construction,  operation,  maintenance,  repair,  and  management  of  all\nexpressways in GZAR (para. 51).\n32. ADB's TA program in the road subsector has been generally successful. Some of the\nmore recent TAs have been instrumental in focusing the Government's attention on the need to\n                  \n24PCR: PRC 23032: Shenyang-Benxi Highway Project, September 1998; PCR: PRC 24335: Jilin Expressway\nProject, October 1998; PCR: PRC 24335: Hunan Expressway Project, September 2000; and PCR: PRC 27398:\nLiaoning Expressway Project, September 2000.\n25Remedial actions are being taken by the EA for the Heilongjiang Expressway Project, which was rated partly\nsuccessful  in  PCR:  PRC  26377:  Heilongjiang Expressway Project,  October  1999,  through  rectifying  the\ninfrastructure deficiencies, enforcing harsher penalties for traffic violations, and implementing the environmental\nmitigation measures recommended in the environmental impact assessment.\n26 PPA: PRC 23032/24335: Shenyang-Benxi Highway and Jilin Expressway Projects, October 2000.", "11\nexpand  its  sources  of  finance  for  highway  development,  and  the  institutional,  policy,  and\nregulatory issues that need to be addressed to facilitate the use of a broader set of modalities for\ndomestic and foreign resource mobilization. Specific improvements have been effected as a\nresult,  and  are  now  being  disseminated  widely  to  all  provinces.  In  January  2001,  ADB's\nOperations Evaluation Office (OEO) completed a performance audit report on traffic safety TAs.27\nThe two TAs implemented in the PRC (para. 43) were rated highly satisfactory.\n33. In 1998, OEO completed its first country assistance program evaluation. The evaluation\nconcluded that ADB\u2019s monitoring mechanisms showed high levels of performance for ongoing\ntransport projects and TAs. Also in 1998, OEO carried out a special study on the operation and\nmaintenance of road facilities and their impact on project sustainability.28 The study concluded that\nmaintenance of roads completed under ADB projects has not been a serious problem in the PRC.\nAn effective budgetary allocation system is in place, and strong institutional capacity to maintain\nthe expressway system has been developed.\n34. As part of a special audit of selected projects in the PRC, ADB\u2019s Office of the General\nAuditor investigated whether ADB loans have been used only for authorized purposes. A special\nreview  mission  was  fielded  for  an  ongoing  road  project29  in  December  1999.  Its  findings\nindicated that while proceeds of the ADB loan had not been used for any unauthorized purpose,\nthere were weaknesses in the internal control system, such as inadequate internal approval\nprocess for major contract variations and discrepancies in accounting practices. As a result, the\nmission, in its discussions with the Ministry of Finance and the China National Audit Office,\nemphasized the need to adopt measures to inspect ongoing projects as part of their supervision\nand audit. A modification of the audit report format has also been proposed for all ADB-financed\nprojects to improve auditing of project accounts. Under the proposed Project, to strengthen the\ninternal control systems in GCD, an international consultant will be appointed as an deputy chief\nsupervision engineer responsible for helping the chief supervision engineer authorize variation\norders, contractors\u2019 payments, and subcontracting arrangements, and for countersigning the\nrelated orders and certificates. The consultant will be assisted by domestic consultants.\nE. ADB\u2019s Subsector Strategy\n35. ADB's PRC country operational strategy30 gives high priority to removing infrastructure\nconstraints and supporting policy and institutional reforms. Given the importance of road transport\nin the development of a market economy and in poverty reduction, ADB will continue its lending to\nthe road subsector for (i) the NTHS; (ii) roads that improve the access of less developed, poor\nrural  areas  to  regional  market  centers;  and  (iii)  selected  urban  transport  projects.  With  the\ncompletion of the northeast transport corridor, the focus of ADB\u2019s activities in the road subsector\nhas shifted to poorer provinces in southwest and central PRC. Improving road infrastructure will\nfacilitate economic growth in these poor areas. Sustained, broad-based economic growth will, in\n                  \n27TPA: IND/PRC/STU 2000-21: Selected Technical Assistance in Road Safety, January 2001.\n28 Operations Evaluation Office. 1998.

An ADB-financed study (footnote 12) for the five administrative areas in\nthe southwest region showed the lack of high class road infrastructure in and out of the region,\nbetween the administrative areas, and within the administrative areas, which increases the cost of\ntransport. The study helped the Government identify road project packages and capacity building\nactivities in the southwest region for implementation during the 10FYP period. This shift in focus of\nADB operations is in line with ADB's strategic objective of promoting growth and reducing poverty\nin  inland  provinces.  The  Government  has  recently  reaffirmed  its  policy  of  increasing  road\nsubsector funding to implement the NTHS as a principal means of promoting and sustaining\neconomic growth. The Government intends to continue seeking the assistance of multilateral\ndevelopment banks for the construction of the NTHS, especially for sections generating direct\nrevenue that can be used for debt servicing.\n36. ADB's PRC operational strategy in the road subsector supports (i) construction of roads\nthat connect major growth centers, promote linkages with hinterland economies, and/or promote\nregional cooperation; (ii) integration of the network so that the NTHS is supported by a system of\nlocal roads, particularly those that provide access to poor areas; (iii) promotion of road safety; (iv)\nfurther  institutional  strengthening  to  increase  the  commercial  orientation  and  efficiency  of\nexpressway organizations; (v) improvement of highway planning and evaluation techniques; (vi)\nadoption of appropriate pricing policies to ensure optimum use of road transport capacity; and (vii)\nuse of alternative methods of investment financing, including private sector participation. The\nproposed Project will connect growth centers in a poor, interior province, support the development\nof local roads that will provide access for the local population to economic centers, and promote\neconomic cooperation between PRC, Viet Nam, and other countries of the Greater Mekong\nSubregion. The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country operational strategy.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n37. ADB has been actively undertaking policy dialogue with the PRC on its road subsector\nsince 1991. The principal issues addressed include poverty impact of road projects, highway\ndesign  standards,  construction  quality  and  road  safety,  vehicle  emissions,  pricing  policies,\ncommercialization and corporatization, and nongovernment financial resources. The status and\nachievements to date are discussed in the following paragraphs and summarized in Appendix 4.\n1. Poverty Impact of Road Projects\n38. ADB and the Government have had extensive discussions on how to enhance the\npoverty reduction impact of road investments supported by ADB. The ADB policy dialogue\nfocused on three main issues. The first is the location of ADB-financed road subsector projects,\nwhich has shifted from the northeast and coastal areas to the poorer central and southwest\nregions. This shift to poorer interior provinces is sustained by the 10FYP (para. 25). Second, the\ndialogue focused on the inclusion of a local road network component. Since 1995, the scope of\nADB-financed  road  projects31  has  included  improvements  to  local  roads  connecting  to  the\nexpressway interchanges to facilitate access of rural communities to county centers and to the\nexpressway facilities. The scope of the proposed Project includes upgrading of 507 km of\ncomplementary  county  and  village  roads  that  will  connect  poor  areas  to  the  expressway\n                  \n31Chengdu-Nanchong  Expressway  Project,  Chongqing-Guizhou  Roads  Development  Projects  (Leichong\nExpressway/Chongzun Expressway), Hebei Expressway Project, Hebei Roads Development Project, Jiangxi\nExpressway  Project,  Liaoning  Expressway  Project,  Shanxi  Road  Development  Project,  Shenyang-Jinzhou\nExpressway Project, and Southern Yunnan Road Development Project. The local road components of these\nprojects are being implemented or have been completed successfully, helping improve living conditions of the poor\npeople in the project area.", "13\ninterchanges. This complementary road program was formulated through ADB\u2019s policy dialogue,\nby prioritizing road sections that serve areas where most poor people live and where the most\nbeneficial impact can be made on poverty reduction. Third, ADB\u2019s policy dialogue centered on\nthe use of remunerated labor and the greatest possible employment of poor people during\nproject road construction. Specific measures have been formulated in the Project to support\nthese objectives (paras. 92 and 106).\n2. Highway Design Standards and Construction Quality\n39. Recognizing the importance of sound engineering practices in the context of increasing\ntraffic volumes and heavy vehicles, MOC has recently revised, with ADB assistance, its highway\nengineering standards.32 Highways are now classified into five categories, expressways and four\nclasses of general highways, according to traffic volumes, functions, and service levels. For\nexpressways, four design speeds were introduced, and design standards for six-lane and eight-\nlane expressways added. Environmental protection, road safety, and integrated development of\nhighways are also incorporated in the revised standards.\n40. In addition to the review of technical standards, ADB helped produce a highway design\nmanual for national roads. The manual, completed in December 1998, elaborates the design\nprinciples and introduces design criteria and methods consistent with international engineering\npractices. The manual, which was translated into Chinese, is now being used on a trial basis by\nselected  design  institutes.  Initial  feedback  on  the  trial  use  has  been  positive.  Based  on\ninformation collected from the trial, the manual will be updated and distributed for nationwide\nuse with adjustment to suit local conditions. The manual will promote the Government\u2019s efforts\nto improve construction quality, protect the environment, and enhance road safety and transport\nefficiency.  In  addition,  a  TA33  is  being  implemented  to  strengthen  project  performance\nmanagement evaluation capacity, particularly of the Key Projects Inspectorate of the State\nDevelopment Planning Commission, and to provide an independent check on the quality of\nmajor construction projects.\n41. The expressway component of the proposed Project has been designed in accordance\nwith the technical standards of highway engineering issued by MOC in January 1998 and in line\nwith the recently developed highway design manual. An international consultant, acting as an\nassistant  chief  supervision  engineer  throughout  the  construction  period,  will  help  the  chief\nsupervision engineer oversee the construction supervision process and ensure construction\nquality. Further international inputs for construction supervision will be provided by earthworks,\nmechanical and electrical equipment, and tunnel specialists.\n42. The EAs are sometimes under pressure to meet ambitious implementation schedules,\nand contractors selected with the primary objective to complete the works within a limited time.\nSuch an objective is detrimental to the quality of works. Irregularities were identified in the\nbidding process under some ADB-financed road projects. For example, bids were rejected due\nto minor technical or commercial deviations, or because the bid price was lower than an EA's\nunsubstantiated \u201creasonable price\u201d.34 To improve the procurement process, ADB assisted the\nMinistry of Construction with preparing the national bidding law and related regulations. The\nTendering and Bidding Law, which was approved by the National People's Congress in August\n                  \n32 TA 2573-PRC: Review of Highway Design Standards, for $420,000, approved on 24 May 1996.\n33TA 3375-PRC: Project Performance Management Capacity Building, for $900,000, approved on 27 December\n1999.\n34As a result, ADB declined to finance a major part of the civil works contracts under Loan 1641-PRC: Changchun-\nHarbin Expressway (Changyu Expressway), for $220 million, approved on 27 November 1998.", "14\n1999 and became effective in January 2000, will promote a transparent, fair, and competitive\nbidding  process.  Although  its  application  is  limited  to  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB),  the\nTendering and Bidding Law is expected to benefit the international competitive bidding (ICB)\nprocess as well through improving the EAs' understanding of the bidding concept. TA for\ngovernance and public sector procurement is being implemented to help develop the guidelines\nand procedures on the implementation of the Tendering and Bidding Law.35 TA was approved in\nFebruary 2001 to help the Government formulate a comprehensive Government Procurement\nLaw that will incorporate the Tendering and Bidding Law.36\n3. Road Safety\n43. Rapid traffic growth on the largely substandard road network has led to increasing traffic\naccidents. Official statistics indicate that there were 616,971 road accidents in 2000, killing 93,853\npeople, injuring 418,721, and resulting in direct economic losses of Y2.67 billion, up by 49\npercent, 12 percent, 46 percent, and 26 percent, respectively from the previous year. Most\naccidents  are  the  result  of  drivers,  cyclists,  and  pedestrians  ignoring  traffic  regulations.  If\naccidents at railway crossings, in military areas, at roadworks, and on roads in industrial areas\nwere included, the number of deaths would increase to over 120,000 per year, a fatality rate of\naround 46 deaths per 10,000 vehicles. This is very high by international standards.37 In addition,\naccident  statistics  are  not  collected  or  analyzed  in  the  best  manner  to  identify  preventive\nmeasures. Reducing the high accident rate is an important element of ADB\u2019s policy dialogue.\nConstruction of a high-standard expressway normally reduces the number of road accidents.\nEvidence from the Shenyang-Dalian Expressway38 indicates that the accident rate was less than\nhalf of that for the parallel National Highway 202, a two-lane highway. ADB TAs at the provincial\nand regional levels39 have helped (i) formulate road safety guidelines, (ii) develop a master plan\nfor the systematic improvement of road safety, (iii) implement selected road safety pilot programs,\nand (iv) build capacity in road safety enforcement. Findings of the TAs are being disseminated to\nall PCDs. ADB\u2019s policy dialogue on road safety is being enhanced through TA,40 which aims at\nincreasing road safety by raising public awareness and strengthening the capacity of the Ministry\nof Public Security for traffic safety, planning, and management. Under this TA, training sessions\nwere  held  in  Jiangsu  Province  in  April  2001,  covering  aspects  of  road  safety  and  traffic\nmanagement, and 57 traffic police officers from almost all the PRC provinces, autonomous\nregions, and municipalities benefited from the sessions. Two other training sessions will be\nconducted by the end of 2001, and the TA will develop a comprehensive action plan to address\ncritical road safety issues in the PRC.\n44. In 2000, GZAR recorded 7,771 road accidents, involving 2,587 fatalities and 7,090 injuries.\nIn the project area in 2000, accidents increased by 10 percent over the previous year and at a\nhigher rate than traffic volumes, due to the poor condition of the existing road. In view of the high\naccident rate, GCD is carrying out a road safety program with assistance of the World Bank,\nincluding  improvement  of  the  accident  reporting  system  and  identification  and  analysis  of\n                  \n35TA 3457-PRC: Implementation of the Tendering and Bidding Law and Related Regulations, for $565,000, approved\non 14 June 2000.\n36TA 3631-PRC: Formulation of the Government Procurement Law, for $578,000, approved on 20 February 2001.\n37Comparative figures for other countries in terms of deaths per 10,000 vehicles are 26.5 for India, 11.8 for\nIndonesia, 8.5 for Thailand, 2.3 for Australia, and 1.9 for Japan.\n38Liaoning  Provincial  Communications  Department.  1994.  Postevaluation  Report  for  the  Shenyang-Dalian\nExpressway.\n39TA 2177-PRC: Preparation of a Road Safety Program, for $600,000, approved on 29 September 1994, and TA\n5620-REG: Regional Initiatives in Road Safety, for $600,000, approved on 4 January 1995.\n40 TA 3341-PRC: Capacity Building in Traffic Safety, Planning, and Management, for $600,000, approved on 14\nDecember 1999.", "15\naccident-prone areas. In this context, the Project will include several measures to improve the\nroad safety situation, such as axle load weighing stations, standard road signs, and training of\nstaff of the EA in road safety. The final design of the project will incorporate the traffic safety\nmeasures recommended in the PPTA final report regarding road design. These include careful\ndesign of at grade intersections, provision of an alternative road for slow moving vehicles on the\nclass I section, speed limits to suit the geometric design, frequent speed limit and speed\nadvisory signs, well defined transitions where there is a change in design speed, and extended\nramp deceleration lengths where ramp design speeds are low. A safety audit of the expressway\nwill be conducted by consultants recruited under the Project. Findings of previous ADB road\nsafety TAs were presented to GCD and the Guangxi Security Bureau during project processing,\nand officials of the Guangxi Security Bureau attended the first workshop of TA 3341-PRC in\nApril 2001 (para. 43).\n4. Vehicle Emissions\n45. Air quality in most PRC cities, and in many rural areas, is poor. The major cause is the\nburning  of  coal  in  power  plants,  boilers,  district  heating  systems,  and  factories.  However,\npollution from vehicles is increasing rapidly and has drawn attention to particular pollutants. In\nsome cities, vehicles already account for 80 percent of total carbon emission levels, 50 percent\nof  nitrogen  oxides,  and  a  substantial  proportion  of  lead.  Under  ADB-financed  TA,41  the\nGovernment is exploring the use of market-based instruments such as subsidies, fuel taxes,\nemission charges, congestion charges, and tradable area licenses, to help reduce vehicle\nemissions.\n46. Measures have been taken in provincial capitals and other cities to limit the distribution\nof leaded fuels. Since 1 January 2000 there has been no further production, and since 1 July\n2000 no further sale of leaded fuels in the PRC. Trucks and heavy vehicles in the PRC are\nmostly using diesel engine, which do not require any lead additives, and there has been no\ndifficulty  in  switching  to  unleaded  fuel  as  it  becomes  widely  available.  In  addition,  use  of\nliquefied petroleum gas instead of gasoline is being promoted in Beijing, where 1,000 buses\nwere converted in 1998, and in other cities. The Government is encouraging the use of ethanol\nas a cleaner, higher-octane additive and alternative to gasoline. The ethanol application will be\ncarried out on an experimental basis by adding 10 percent ethanol to gasoline.\n47. Improved  emissions  standards  for  new  vehicles  are  directed  at  reducing  carbon\nmonoxide and nitrous oxides emissions. Vehicle emissions are tested when new vehicles are\nproduced. Partial and full European standards will be implemented for the production and\nimportation of small vehicles in 2001 and 2004, respectively, and for larger vehicles in 2002 and\n2005. Similarly, motorcycles will be subject to European standards in two phases, by 2001 and\n2005.\n48. Regulation of vehicle emissions is the responsibility of local environmental protection\nbureaus, in cooperation with the traffic division of the public security bureaus.42 Vehicles are\nsubject to annual inspection, which can be done on a customized basis for fleets of transport\nenterprises. In addition, vehicle emission testing is carried out at some city boundaries, where\ntime-bound permits are issued for use of the vehicle in the city, and there is also random testing\n                  \n41 TA 2951-PRC: Promotion of Market-Based Instruments for Environmental Management, for $697,000, approved on\n16 December 1997.\n42The Government strengthened the control of emissions from motor vehicles by amending the Air Pollution\nPrevention and Control Act in April 2000.", "16\non highways. These activities are self-financing; inspection fees and fines are sufficient to fund\nexpanding inspection and testing programs. As the interprovincial movement of vehicles is\nencouraged by development of the NTHS, there is a need to harmonize among provinces\ndifferences in vehicle emission control and regulations, enforcement and monitoring, testing\nprograms, certification, and inspection procedures. This issue is being addressed under a TA43\nthat assists governments to develop and implement policies to reduce vehicle emissions on a\nregional basis, including the PRC. The TA will also assist selected governments to formulate\naction plans to reduce vehicle emissions. The TA\u2019s activities will focus primarily on fuel quality,\nalternative fuels, the regulation of two and three wheeled motorized vehicles, vehicle testing,\ninspection, and transport planning. A regional workshop on inspection and maintenance of\nvehicles will be organized in Chongqing in November 2001. In GZAR, vehicle emission control\nis carried out, strictly following the relevant provisions specified in the Atmospheric Pollution\nControl Law (1987 and revised in 1995), the State Regulations on Vehicle Emission Control\n(1990), and GZAR\u2019s Regulation on Supervision and Administration of Vehicle Emission Control\n(1993/1996).\n5. Pricing Policies for Road Users\n49. The Government\u2019s policy on road user charges allows cost recovery through tolls for\nexpressways and highways that are partly funded through loan financing, and meet the following\nconditions: (i) high traffic volumes, (ii) a relatively inelastic demand for road transport in relation to\nthe toll level, and (iii) high values attached to time savings for passengers and freight. ADB has\nundertaken a study to develop a toll traffic diversion model applicable to socioeconomic conditions\nprevailing in the PRC.44 This will help the Government introduce toll pricing policies that improve\ncost  recovery  and  transparency,  and  provide  adequate  incentives  to  attract  private  sector\ninvestment. The toll diversion manual has been translated into Chinese and is being distributed to\nPCDs. Through training, further consideration will be given to toll collection methods and the\nintroduction of technologies that will reduce the transaction costs of toll collection for road users.\nADB\u2019s policy on expressway toll levels, incorporated in loan covenants for previous projects and\nthe proposed Project, requires full cost recovery including regular review of toll levels to ensure\nthe  recovery  of  operation  and  maintenance  costs  and  debt  service,  and  generation  of  an\nadditional  return  for  replacement  and  improvement  investments.  However,  toll  rate  levels\nestablished for new expressways also take into account the affordability for transport users (para.\n98).\n6. Corporatization and Commercialization\n50. The  PRC's  move  to  a  market  economy  has  put  pressure  on  existing  expressway\norganizations and their staff to become commercially oriented and more efficient. Financing and\ncommercial business management practices could be improved. To support good governance in\nthe subsector and the institutional development of expressway organizations, the Government,\nwith  assistance  from  ADB  and  the  World  Bank,  is  pursuing  capacity-building  programs  to\nencourage commercialization and corporatization in all provinces. TA has been provided to help\nthe  Government  develop  institutional  capacity  to  promote  corporatization,  leasing,  and\nsecuritization45  in  the  road  sector  to  attract  private  sector  participation  in  the  construction,\n                  \n43TA 5973-REG: Action Plans for Reducing Vehicle Emissions, for $900,000, approved on 26 September 2000.\n44 TA 3102-PRC: Preparing the Chongqing-Guizhou Expressway Project (Part 2): Toll Diversion Study, for $900,000,\napproved on 26 November 1998.\n45The term \"securitization\" refers to the process of raising funds through the issuance of either shares or bonds on\nlocal or foreign stock exchanges and markets.", "17\nmanagement, and operation of bridges, expressways, and other roads in the PRC.46 Through\nreview of practices in the PRC and in other countries, conduct of workshops for all PRC\nprovinces, and development of case studies, the TA produced documents and guidelines, and\nmade recommendations. The main document produced is an investor\u2019s guide for infrastructure\ninvestment in the PRC, including (i) a toll roads investment and policy options model (TRIPO)\nand  its  user  manual;  (ii)  articles  of  associations,  founder\u2019s  agreement,  and  operation  and\nmanagement agreement for corporatization; (iii) lease and concession agreements; and (iv)\napproval procedures for corporatization, leasing, concessioning, and securitization of toll roads.\nThe main recommendations of the TA are that the Government should (i) prepare a new law\nintegrating  all  existing  laws  (and  directives,  rules  and  regulations  from  various  ministries)\ndealing with toll roads, to achieve internal consistency; (ii) examine the role of long-term debt\nfinancing  for  toll  roads,  and  facilitate  access  for  PRC  companies  to  the  domestic  and\ninternational bond markets, on the same basis as for the securities equity market; (iii) combine\nroads together into routes, where possible, and create corporations to operate the routes; (iv)\nconsider setting a target for new toll road companies wherein the PCD\u2019s ownership aims to be\nno more than 80 percent of the outstanding shares; (v) ensure that land acquisition costs are\nadequately shared between public and private parties, and resettlement and land use certificate\nissues are adequately addressed, particularly when the private sector is involved; (vi) ensure\nthat traffic forecasts are realistic and conducted by independent companies, and toll setting is\nflexible enough to be adjusted in relation to traffic; (vii) allow bundling of toll roads with nontolled\nroads under concession agreements to balance the perceived cost and utility of toll roads; (viii)\nestablish offices of investment support at national and provincial levels to help investors move\nthrough the approval process of leasing and concessioning; (ix) consider the option of open\nbidding for future lease and concession agreements; and (x) avoid inflating the use value of\nassets for securitization for reasons unrelated to the commercial use of the roads. These\nrecommendations are under discussion with the Government.\n51. GCD has agreed to establish the Guangxi Expressway Management Company (GEMC)\nsix months prior to the expected date of project completion, and not later than 30 June 2004.\nGEMC is expected to be a state-owned corporation, with GCD as sole investor. GEMC will be\nresponsible  for  construction,  operation,  maintenance,  repair,  and  management  of  all\nexpressways in GZAR. GEMC will obtain all finance (equity and debt) necessary to perform\nsuch activities. Before commencement of commercial operation, the project expressway will be\ntransferred to GEMC. GEMC will be entitled to collect and retain tolls in accordance with the toll\nstructure and will repay the loans contracted for the project expressway. Details on the creation\nof GEMC, and transfer of assets, revenues, and debt service obligations from GCD to GEMC,\nincluding GEMC\u2019s financial statements for the Project, will be submitted for ADB\u2019s approval six\nmonths  prior  to  GEMC  creation.  GEMC  will  develop  a  commercialization  program  with\nappropriate accounting and management information systems, and will introduce commercial\nbusiness practices using the training financed under the Project. Such a program will ensure\nautonomy of operations, encourage the establishment of road facility performance indicators,\nand facilitate future refinancing of road subsector assets.\n7. Mobilizing Nongovernment Financing\n52. The Government has taken a number of significant steps to mobilize domestic resources,\nincluding developing capital markets and transforming specialized banks into commercial banks.\nADB has provided assistance to help develop the PRC's capital markets, and made a major\n                  \n46 TA 2952-PRC: Corporatization, Leasing, and Securitization in the Road Sector, for $1.0 million, approved on 19\nDecember 1997.", "18\ncontribution to improving governance in the capital markets by supporting the drafting of the 1998\nSecurities Law.47 The Government is also seeking a greater role for private sector financing in\nhighway  and  other  infrastructure  projects.  Apart  from  increasing  the  resources  available  for\nhighway development, the use of foreign direct investment would allow project risks to be spread\nover a large community of investors, and help improve the management efficiency and quality of\nhighway services. In the road subsector, ADB provided a TA48 to assess a broad range of financial\ninstruments for mobilizing additional domestic and international funding sources, including the\ndomestic capital markets. ADB also provided assistance for (i) preparing a feasibility study on\nfinancing a road project using a BOT scheme, and for capacity building in relation to BOT\nprocesses;49 and (ii) developing institutional capacity to promote corporatization, leasing, and\nsecuritization to attract private sector participation in the road sector (para. 50). Appendix 5\nsummarizes options available for mobilizing nongovernment financing and ADB\u2019s investment in\nprivate sector funds in the PRC.\n53. The increasing infrastructure needs in the PRC require local governments to shift from\nthe conventional financing modes such as commercial bank loans, international or bilateral\nloans, government grants, and export credits toward the capital markets. Initial public offerings\n(IPO)  of  expressway  companies  on  the  stock  exchange  have  demonstrated  that  such\ninvestments can be financially attractive under certain circumstances. Bond issues are another\nsuitable tool for infrastructure projects owing to the long-term and stable earnings stream of\nsuch  projects.  Revenue  bond  issues  by  a  public  agency  that  owns  the  asset  have  an\nadvantage, as the public owns the facilities, but the private investors finance it. However, any\ncapital market instrument requires an adequate registration process and public disclosure, and\na  strong  credit  standing,  and  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  in  the  PRC  needs\nstrengthening. Expressway corporations may also consider leasing schemes, which would have\nconsiderable  potential  if  combined  with  tax  incentives  for  the  lessees.  ADB  helps  the\nGovernment  select  suitable  private  sector  financing  modalities  for  road  projects.  This  will\nultimately alleviate the burden on the final road users as well as the Government budget. These\ninstruments are, however, easier to use where traffic volume and income level are high, i.e., in\nthe coastal region and near major cities. They are not easy to use in the inland southwest and\ncentral regions, where traffic densities are low and the road network needs to be developed to\nsupport economic development.\n54. Six  months  prior  to  the  opening  of  the  project  facilities,  GCD,  through  GEMC,  will\nanalyze the feasibility of attracting nongovernment investment funds including private sector\nparticipation in the operation, maintenance, and management of the project road. GCD has\nalready taken two private sector participation initiatives: a joint venture agreement with Hong\nKong Merchandise Int'l Ltd. for the 138 km Guiliu Expressway for a total investment of Y2.13\nbillion in May 1997; and a BOT agreement with China Huawen Development General Company\nfor the Liujing-Xingye section of the Nanning-Guangzhou Expressway for a total investment of\nY2.34 billion in December 2000.\n                  \n47TA 3032-PRC: Legislative Drafting Support for the PRC Securities Law, for $150,000, approved on 24 June 1998;\nand TA 3304-PRC: Capacity Building of the Capital Markets Regulatory System, for $1.0 million, approved on 24\nNovember 1999.\n48TA 2409-PRC: Appraisal Methodologies and Restructuring Highway Financing in Hebei Province, for $740,000,\napproved on 28 September 1995.\n49 TA 2649-PRC: Facilitating Build-Operate-Transfer Modality in the Highway Sector, for $1.1 million, approved on 27\nSeptember 1996.", "19\nIV .  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n55. ADB's PRC country operational strategy supports the Government's policies in the road\nsector, which focus on building roads that will promote economic and social development\nparticularly in the poor areas of the country. GZAR, located in the southwest, is a poor interior\nprovince. GZAR had around 15.2 million rural poor by the end of 2000, using a rural income\nlevel of Y1,000 per capita per annum,50 accounting for about 32 percent of the total GZAR\npopulation of 47.6 million. In terms of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, GZAR is the\nfourth poorest of the PRC's 31 provinces. In 2000, the average GDP per capita in GZAR was\nY4,285, about two thirds of the national average. Since 1980, the average annual economic\ngrowth in GZAR, 9.2 percent, has been slightly lower than the national average of 10.1 percent.\nLack of transport infrastructure is one of the factors contributing to the depressed economic\nconditions. As a result of ADB\u2019s policy dialogue, the scope of the Project has been expanded to\nstrengthen its development impact by adding a program of complementary road upgrading to\nimprove the local road network and access of poor communities in the project area.\n56. The proposed Project is a NTHS connector link from the Viet Nam's National Highway 1\nto the NTHS corridor 40 linking Chongqing Municipality via Guiyang, in Guizhou Province, and\nNanning to Zhanjiang, in Guangdong Province, and to the NTHS corridor 75 from Kunming in\nYunnan Province to Hengyang, in Hunan Province (Map 1). The Project will also connect to the\nNanning-Guilin Expressway, a major link to Hunan Province and, via the Nanning-Wuxhou\nExpressway (to open in 2005), to Guangdong Province.\n57. The proposed Project will facilitate regional cooperation between the PRC, Viet Nam,\nand other countries of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). The project road will improve\naccessibility between Nanning (GZAR's capital) and the Viet Nam border, while another ADB-\nfinanced road project51 is improving accessibility between the border and Hanoi, Viet Nam\u2019s\ncapital. Connection between Hanoi and neighboring Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and\nCambodia,  and  Thailand,  will  be  improved  by  the  ongoing  GMS  road  program.  Improving\nphysical  links  between  the  PRC,  Viet  Nam,  and  other  GMS  countries  will  catalyze  the\nconclusion of agreements to harmonize and simplify procedures governing the movement of\npeople, goods, and vehicles across national boundaries.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n58. The proposed Project will promote sustainable economic growth, and, thus, contribute to\npoverty reduction, by improving economic efficiency and reducing the cost of road transport in\nthe southwestern region of GZAR. The Project will relieve traffic congestion and bottlenecks on\na key section of the existing road, National Highway 322 (NH 322), a link of the NTHS, and\nprovide  better  access  to  growth  centers  for  poor  communities  through  the  inclusion  of  a\ncomplementary program of local road upgrading in the project scope. Specifically the proposed\nProject will (i) provide additional transport capacity, alleviate congestion, and reduce traffic\naccidents and vehicle operating costs; (ii) improve access for the poor rural population in the\ntransport corridor; and (iii) facilitate regional cooperation by providing better access from GZAR\nand other PRC provinces to Viet Nam and the road network of the GMS. The proposed Project\n                  \n50 Using the same income level, the national rural poverty incidence is 12 percent.\n51 Loan 1487-VN: Second Road Improvement Project, for $120 million, approved on 21 November 1996.", "20\nwill also support sector reforms initiated under ongoing ADB-financed projects and regional\ninitiatives.\n59. The scope of the Project includes:\n(i)  construction of 136 km of four-lane access-controlled tollway from Nanning (Wuxu)\nto Ningming, 43 km of four-lane class I road from Ningming to Youyiguan at the\nViet Nam border, and 49 km of class II connector roads between the project road\nand major towns, including interchanges with toll stations, bridges, administrative\nstations, service areas, and improvement of about 100 km of access roads to\naffected villages along the project road alignment;\n(ii)  upgrading  of  about  507  km52  of  complementary  county  and  village  roads  to\nimprove the local road network and the access to poor areas;\n(iii)  procurement of equipment for road maintenance, toll collection, surveillance and\ncommunications, vehicle axle load testing, road safety, and office administration;\n(iv)  land acquisition and resettlement; and\n(v)  consulting services for construction supervision, monitoring, and evaluation, and\nin-country and international training for capacity building.\nC. Technical Justification\n60. GZAR  has  a  land  area  of  236,661  square  kilometers,  62  percent  of  which  is\nmountainous. The existing NH 322, a single carriageway two-lane highway is the only road\nlinking Nanning, GZAR\u2019s Capital City, to Youyiguan at the Viet Nam border. The proposed\nProject will start on a new expressway that was completed in October 2000 between Nanning\nand Wuxu, to connect Nanning to its airport. The new expressway has a different alignment\nfrom the 25 km Nanning-Wuxu section of NH 322, which follows class II highway standards. A\n14 km section close to Pingxiang City and a 5 km section east of Ningming City were also\nupgraded to class II highway standards. All other sections of NH 322 between Wuxu and\nYouyiguan follow class III-IV highway standards. The technical standards of these sections of\nthe road are low, grades are steep, especially close to Ningming and the border, and there are\nmany sharp curves. Passing sight distance is poor over much of the road\u2019s length leading to\nmany accidents (2,255 accidents, with 431 fatalities, recorded on NH 322 in 2000). The road\nnetwork that radiates from NH 322 and the provincial roads in the hinterland served by Project is\nlimited, generally of low standard, and largely unsealed.\n61. Most of road sections have reached their capacity, which is low, ranging between 1,500\nmedium truck equivalent units (MTE) and 6,000 MTE per day depending on road class. Travel\ntime along the road is highly variable. Passenger cars take about 5 hours to cover the 220 km\nbetween Nanning and Youyiguan, and trucks and large buses take longer. As the traffic on the\nroad is near or exceeds capacity, travel times will increase rapidly with further increase in traffic\nover the next few years. From an average of 3,200 MTE per day in 1998, the traffic between\nNanning  and  Youyiguan  is  forecast  to  reach  an  average  of  6,800  MTE  per  day  in  2005,\nequivalent to an annual growth rate of 11.3 percent, and 20,800 MTE in 2025, equivalent to an\naverage annual growth rate of 5.8 percent between 2005 and 2025 (Appendix 6). The existing\nNH 322 will not be able to safely and efficiently carry the forecast traffic from 2005. A new road\nfollowing  a  new  alignment  must  be  constructed  to  accommodate  the  expected  traffic  and\nsupport continued economic development of the area. While expressway standards will be\n                  \n52 Construction of a further 471 km of complementary roads has started in 2000 and will be completed by the end of\n2001.", "21\nadopted  for  the  Wuxu-Ningming  section,  class  I  highway  standards  will  be  used  for  the\nNingming-Youyiguan section in view of the lower traffic forecast and the hilly terrain. In this\nreport, the term \u201cexpressway\u201d is used for the whole alignment including expressway and class I\nhighway sections.\n62. NH 322 is not near the major county towns in the project area, which have developed\nclose to the railway. The proposed alignment is the logical route to serve these towns in addition\nto those on NH 322. Alternative alignments were considered for sections of the proposed road\nin consultation with local governments and local communities. The final alignment was selected\nbased on overall length, ease of construction, and minimization of adverse environmental and\nsocial impacts, including protection of cultural and historic sites. The new road is being designed\nin accordance with MOC standards.\n63. The complementary road program was prepared in consultation with local communities to\nimprove the local road network and access of the poor communities to the expressway in the five\ncounties where poverty incidence was the highest (Map 2). This program will be implemented\nconcurrently with the expressway. In addition to 471 km of village roads for which improvement\nworks have already started, about 507 km of county and village roads will be improved under\nthe Project, including (i) upgrading of 283 km of county roads and 7 km of village roads to class\nIII highway standards; (ii) upgrading of 54 km of county roads and 111 km of village roads to\npaved class IV highway standards; and (iii) upgrading of 52 km of village roads to unpaved\nclass IV highway standards. Road links were prioritized using an analysis that took account of\neconomic and social benefits, availability of funds, and road network efficiency (Appendix 7).\nD. Cost Estimates\n64. The total cost of the Project, including physical and price contingencies and interest\nduring construction, is estimated at $455.2 million equivalent, of which $193.2 million (42.4\npercent) is in foreign exchange and $262.0 million equivalent (57.6 percent) is in local currency.\nThe cost estimates are summarized in Table 1.\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nItem Exchange Currency Cost\nA.

The Government has requested ADB to provide a loan of $150 million and the European\nInvestment Bank (EIB) to provide cofinancing of $50 million. The proposed ADB loan will\nfinance 77.6 percent of the foreign exchange cost of the Project. The proposed EIB loan will\nfinance 11.0 percent of the total cost, including foreign exchange and local currency costs. The\nChina Development Bank (CDB) will provide domestic cofinancing of $60.4 million equivalent, to\ncover 23.1 percent of the local currency cost of the Project. The Government, through MOC and\nGCD will finance the remaining foreign exchange and local currency costs. The financing plan is\nshown in Table 2. Detailed cost estimates and ADB and EIB financing is in Appendix 8.\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign Local Percent\nSource Exchange Exchange Total of Total Cost\nADB loan 150.0 0.0 150.0 32.9\nEIB loan 24.0 26.0 50.0 11.0\nCDB loan 0.0 60.4 60.4 13.3\nMOC grant 0.0 101.0 101.0 22.2\nGCD funds 19.4 74.6 93.8 20.6\nTotal 193.2 262.0 455.2 100.0\nADB=Asian Development Bank, CDB=China Development Bank, EIB=European Investment Bank, GCD=Guangxi\nCommunications Department, MOC=Ministry of Communications.\nSource: Staff estimates.\n66. The proposed ADB loan will be in United States (US) dollars from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital\nresources and have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 4 years, an interest rate\ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending\nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum, and a front end fee of 1.0 percent (the\nfee will be capitalized in the loan), conversion options that may be exercised in accordance with\nthe terms of the draft Loan Agreement, the Loan Regulations and ADB's Conversion Guidelines,\nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. The Borrower will be\nthe PRC. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for PRC's decision to borrow\nunder ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions and (ii) an\nundertaking that these choices were the PRC's own independent decision and not made in\nreliance on any communication or advice of ADB. The proceeds of the ADB loan will be relent to\nthe GZAR government, which will onlend them to GCD, on terms and conditions acceptable to\nADB. GCD will bear interest rate variation and foreign exchange risks on the loan.\n67. The proposed EIB loan will be provided as parallel financing to the ADB loan to finance\nthe class I road section from Ningming to Youyiguan. The conditions of the EIB loan will be\nagreed between EIB and the Government. The EIB loan will have a maturity of 20 years including\na grace period of 5 years. No front-end fee or commitment charges will be applied. Interest during\nconstruction will be paid directly by the Government to EIB.\n68. The CDB loan will be repayable over a period of 17 years, including a grace period of 4\nyears, and at an interest rate of 6.2 percent per annum. The Government contribution to the\nProject will include a grant from MOC of $101.0 million equivalent. GCD\u2019s contribution to the\nProject will be a grant of $99.2 million equivalent from its construction fund.", "23\nF. The Executing Agency\n69. GCD  will  be  the  EA  for  the  Project.  GCD  has  completed  its  reorganization  and\nrestructuring in 2000, which resulted in reduction of its staff and separation of most enterprises\ninitially under GCD, which are now independent companies. GCD has only about 50 staff\ndirectly employed in the department. In addition about 1,600 people are employed in several\nrelated bureaus, institutes, and other agencies. This does not include the staff employed in the\nprefecture  and  municipal  communication  bureaus  (Appendix  9).  GCD  has  satisfactorily\nimplemented  one  ADB-financed  transport  project53  and  one  World  Bank-financed  inland\nwaterway project, and recently started implementing a World Bank-financed road project. GCD\nhas the capability to implement the Project, provided that it receives adequate support from the\nconstruction supervision consultants and ADB review missions. After GEMC is established\n(para. 51), the project facilities and GCD's responsibilities for the Project will be transferred from\nGCD to GEMC, after receiving ADB\u2019s concurrence on the proposed arrangements.\nG. Implementation Arrangements\n1. Management and Organization\n70. GCD has established a project management unit (PMU) to coordinate and monitor all\nproject  activities.  The  PMU  is  headed  by  a  Deputy  Director  of  GCD,  and  comprises  9\nmanagement staff, including a Project Coordinator. The PMU is responsible for recruitment of\nsupervision consultants, training, and international procurement. All activities related to the\nconstruction of the project expressway are the responsibility of a construction office comprising\n5 headquarters divisions (contract management, environment and resettlement, administration,\nfinancial, and human resources). The complementary road program will be implemented by the\ncounty  communication  bureaus,  under  the  supervision  of  the  Nanning  Prefecture\nCommunications  Bureau.  To  facilitate  land  acquisition,  resettlement,  and  environmental\nprotection measures, and to ensure that local concerns are adequately addressed, project\nimplementation committees, consisting of officials from local governments and various local\nagencies, have been established in the counties along the project roads, i.e. Chongzuo, Fusui,\nLongzhou, Ningming, Pingxiang, and Yongning.\n2. Implementation Schedule\n71. Preconstruction activities of ADB-financed works, such as detailed design, preparation of\nbidding  documents,  prequalification  of  contractors,  tendering,  and  award  of  contracts\ncommenced in March 2001 and should be completed by the end of January 2002. However\nbecause of the shorter EIB procurement process, EIB-financed works will be ready to start\nearlier. Overall project construction is therefore scheduled to start in late December 2001 and\ntake  about  40  months,  the  anticipated  completion  date  being  the  end  of  April  2005.\nImplementation  of  the  complementary  road  program  will  be  concurrent  with  expressway\nconstruction. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 10.\n3. Procurement\n72. All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with\nthe ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. All civil works contracts will be awarded on the basis of\n                  \n53  Loan 1427-PRC: Fangcheng Port, for $52 million, approved on 18 January 1996. The project also included a road\ncomponent for access to the port.", "24\ninternational competitive bidding (ICB) procedure. Supply contracts estimated to cost more than\n$500,000 will also be awarded under ICB. Supply contracts estimated to cost $500,000 or less\nwill be awarded on the basis of international shopping and those costing $100,000 or less by\ndirect  purchase  procedures.  Local  competitive  bidding  procedures  will  not  be  used.\nProcurement  under  ICB  and  international  shopping  procedures,  including  prequalification,\ntendering, and bid evaluation, will be carried out with the assistance of the China International\nTendering Company. This company has relevant experience gained under other externally\nfinanced projects, including those of ADB and the World Bank. Procurement for ADB financing\nwill include 12 packages of civil works to be procured under ICB procedures, and 13 packages\nof equipment under ICB/international shopping/direct purchase procedures. EIB will finance 3\npackages of civil works to be procured under ICB procedures. Prequalified contractors with\nadequate technical and financial capacities will be allowed to bid on several packages and, if\nsuccessful,  may  be  awarded  more  than  one  contract  based  on  least  cost  combination  of\ncontracts. The detailed contract packages are in Appendix 11.\n4. Consulting Services \n73.   Eight  resident  supervision  engineer  offices,  staffed  with  domestic  consulting  firms\nselected  by  GCD,  will  directly  supervise  construction  works  in  the  field.  Overall  project\nsupervision will be under the responsibility of the Chief Supervision Engineer Office (CSEO), to\nwhich the international consultants will be fully integrated. A chief supervision engineer (CSE)\nand two deputy chief supervision engineers (DCSEs) will head the CSEO. One DCSE will be\nthe team leader of the international consultants and will assist the CSE in project and contract\nmanagement  activities,  and  certify  contractor\u2019s  progress  payment  certificates  and  contract\nvariations prior to their approval by the CSE. Other international experts will provide short-term\nassistance  to  the  CSEO  on  earthworks,  mechanical  and  electrical  equipment,  tunnel\nconstruction, traffic safety, and other technical issues.\n74. GCD will select individual domestic consultants to staff the CSEO, and nominate the chiefs\nof the main units of the CSEO, i.e., the supervision division, measurement office, and central\nlaboratory. Three individual domestic consultants recruited as deputy chiefs of these units will\nhave the special duty to assist the team of international consultants. They will be a qualified\ncontract management specialist (supervision division), quantity engineer (measurement office),\nand quality control specialist (central laboratory), fluent in English. The terms of reference\n(TORs) of these three positions will be submitted to ADB for concurrence prior to selection; the\nbiodatas of the selected candidates will be submitted to ADB for concurrence prior to their\nrecruitment; and GCD will confirm to ADB the recruitment of the selected candidates. If the\nselected domestic consultants cannot satisfy the requirements of their TORs, GCD will find\ninternationally recruited consultants to fill these positions.\n75. In  addition  to  international  consultants  for  construction  supervision,  international\nspecialists will provide inputs in resettlement monitoring and evaluation, project performance\nmanagement systems, training, and other topics as required. A total of about 60 person-months\nof  consultants  from  an  international  consulting  company  will  be  required  for  international\nconsulting services. International consultants will be financed under the loan, and recruited by\nGCD in accordance with ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Construction supervision\nwill  require  about  4,900  person-months  of  professional  domestic  consultants.54  Domestic\n                  \n54 It also includes about 3,900 person-months of technical support staff, for a total of about 8,800 person-months of\nhired domestic technical services.", "25\nconsultants will be financed by GCD and recruited in accordance with local procedures that are\nsatisfactory to ADB.\n5.  Advance Recruitment and Procurement Actions\n76. During  project  processing,  the  Government  requested  ADB\u2019s  approval  for  advance\naction to expedite the recruitment of consultants and procurement for civil works. Advance\nprocurement action was approved on 4 April 2001 and covers prequalification of contractors,\ntendering, and bid evaluation for the civil works contract packages, but does not include signing\nof contracts. Advance recruitment action was approved on 1 June 2001, and covers selection of\ninternational consultants, up to but not including signing of the contract. The Government and\nGCD have been advised that ADB\u2019s approval of advance actions does not commit ADB to\nfinance the Project.\n6.  Midterm Review\n77. In 2003, ADB and GCD will carry out a midterm review of the Project, focusing on all\npolicy, institutional, administrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, economic,\nfinancial, and other relevant aspects that may have an impact on the performance of the Project\nand its continuing viability. The review will (i) examine the progress in implementing subsector\nreforms, policy development, progress in resettlement, and compliance with assurances in the\nLoan Agreement; and (ii) consider complementary activities to enhance the poverty impact\nduring operations.\n7. Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n78.  A resettlement plan was prepared by the Xi\u2019an Highway University for GCD in February\n2000 and revised with the assistance of the TA consultant. The resettlement plan was finalized\nat  loan  appraisal  based  on  the  preliminary  technical  design  of  the  Project.  Appendix  12\nsummarizes the resettlement plan. The Project will result in loss of land, houses, and other\nassets due to the expressway construction. An estimated 31,000 people will be affected, less\nthan 10,000 of whom need economic rehabilitation. Of these, 1,130 will have their housing\nrelocated. Those losing land will be compensated, through their economic collectives, under the\n1998 Land Administration Law and the provincial guidelines, which set out the procedures,\ncompensation rates, and resettlement subsidies, for acquisition of land. The Project will result in\npermanent land acquisition of nearly 1,200 hectares (ha), plus about 190 ha of temporarily\nborrowed  land  for  construction  purposes.  Those  losing  housing  will  receive  compensation\ndirectly and a replacement house site, with vulnerable households receiving assistance to\nreplace  their  houses.  Those  losing  other  assets,  such  as  crops,  trees,  sheds,  and  other\nstructures, will be compensated directly for their losses. People whose land will be borrowed\ntemporarily will be compensated for the loss of production. The initial land acquisition and\nresettlement budget, estimated at about $38.8 million equivalent, is included in the project cost\nestimates.\n79. GCD  will  fund  the  resettlement  costs  according  to  the  standards  set  out  in  the\nresettlement  plan.  Compensation  will  be  paid  for  housing  and  new  housing  will  be  made\navailable before relocation takes place. The 1998 Land Administration Law, which was drafted\nwith ADB assistance,55 provides for disclosure of information and consultation with people\naffected. The summary of the resettlement plan, together with provincial compensation rates,\n                  \n55 TA 2735-PRC: Capacity Building for Natural Resources Legislation, for $800,000, approved on 24 December 1996.", "26\nhas been distributed to county and township offices in early April 2001, to be disclosed to\naffected people through village collectives. Disclosed resettlement information includes a broad\nsummary of the scope of land acquisition and resettlement, rates for compensation and other\nassistance, the grievance mechanism, and intended time frame. To date, no adverse response\nhas  been  received.  During  appraisal,  an  ADB  mission  conducted  a  training  workshop  on\nresettlement policy and implementation of the resettlement plan for the resettlement staff of the\nPMU  and  selected  county  resettlement  staff,  to  facilitate  the  smooth  implementation  of  the\nresettlement plan. GCD will monitor the resettlement process and submit quarterly reports to\nADB. A regular reporting system has been established to ensure key resettlement activities are\nimplemented  on  time.  GCD  will  engage  a  qualified  local  institute  to  provide  independent\nmonitoring of the resettlement process. Further surveys will be done on completion of the\nresettlement, and one and two years after Project completion, and the findings will be reported\nto GCD and ADB.\n8. Reports, Accounts, and Audit\n80. The Government has agreed that, as in previous ADB-financed projects, arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB will be made for reporting the progress of Project implementation. In this\nregard, GCD will submit to ADB quarterly progress reports in such form and detail as ADB may\nrequest, and brief monthly updates. To facilitate postevaluation of the Project, GCD will also\nfurnish ADB, within three months of project completion, a project completion report providing\ndetails  regarding  physical  implementation,  project  costs,  recruitment  and  performance  of\nconsultants, procurement of goods and civil works, performance of suppliers and contractors,\nsocial  and  environmental  impacts,  project  financial  and  economic  performance,  and  other\ndetails  as  requested  by  ADB.  In  addition,  GCD  will  provide  to  ADB  reports  on  contract\nmanagement  procedures  (including  approval  of  variations  orders  and  progress  payment\ncertificates), forecast traffic volumes and proposed toll tariff increases, benefit monitoring, and\nother activities within the required time as stipulated in the loan and project agreements.\n81. GCD will maintain separate accounts for the Project and related financial statements,\nsuch as statements of sources and application of funds, implementation of the loan agreement,\nand income and expenses. The accounts will be started on commencement of toll operation,\nand audited annually. After its establishment, GEMC (para. 51) will also prepare such separate\nstatements plus an overall balance sheet. GMEC will prepare one set of financial statements for\nthe Project and another for consolidated accounts, and have both sets audited annually. The\naudit  will  be  in  accordance  with  appropriate  auditing  standards  consistently  applied,  by\nindependent auditors, whose qualifications, experience and TOR are acceptable to ADB. GCD\nwill submit to ADB within nine months of the end of each related fiscal year, certified copies of\naudited project accounts and financial statements and an auditor\u2019s report for the Project, all in\nthe English language. ADB reminded the Government of its stringent requirements for timely\nsubmission of audited project accounts and financial statements, and that noncompliance with\nthe requirements may result in the suspension of loan disbursements. During the midterm\nreview in 2003, financial projections of GEMC for the next five years should be submitted to\nADB for its review and such projections should be updated annually thereafter.\n9. Project Performance Management System\n82. A set of indicators for monitoring and evaluating the performance of the Project in\nrelation to its goals and objectives has been agreed with GCD. Prior to project implementation,\nGCD will establish the necessary baseline values for impact indicators. These values will be\nupdated during project implementation. Specific indicators will be measured, with the necessary", "27\nfrequency, during project construction. Comments and findings regarding project impact will be\nincorporated in every second ADB quarterly report. Indicators for project evaluation will be\nmeasured at project completion and annually for three years after completion. Where relevant,\nindicators will be disaggregated by gender. To facilitate assessment of the socioeconomic\nimpact  of  the  Project,  TOR  for  services  of  an  international  consultant  and  local\ninstitute/consultants to monitor and evaluate all relevant project effects, have been included in\nthe scope of consulting services to be provided under the Project.\n10. Anticorruption Measures\n83. During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to central and local\ngovernment officials. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption that was added\nto ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, particularly the\nneed for bidders, suppliers, contractors, and consultants to observe the highest standards of\nethics in the procurement and execution of ADB-financed contracts, and the sanctions if fraud\nand  corruption  are  discovered.  ADB's  program  for  the  PRC  includes  assistance  to  the\nGovernment that will improve governance and provide incentives to reduce the incidence of\ncorruption in the longer term. In 1998, ADB TA helped the Government to develop detailed\nguidelines for the selection and engagement of consultants,56 to increase transparency, take\naccount of the principles of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy, and provide for equal opportunity\ncompetition. The resulting draft guidelines were well received by the Government. ADB is\nproviding  assistance  to  strengthen  the  Government's  auditing  system  to  conform  with  the\nrequirements of the Audit Law and, as far as practicable, international auditing standards by (i)\nformulating government auditing standards and procedures, and (ii) designing and implementing\nan audit training program to promote full and consistent adherence to such auditing standards\nand procedures by government auditors.57 This work will strengthen the Government's ability to\ndetect fraud and corruption. ADB has also provided assistance for establishment of national\nprocurement  regulations,  implementation  of  the  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law  and  related\nregulations, and formulation of the Government Procurement Law (footnotes 35 and 36). These\nlaws and regulations will help ensure transparency in the procurement process and reduce\ncorruption. In line with these national developments, GCD has established an anticorruption\nsystem by preparing specific programs and targets, and organizing training and workshops.\n11.  Capacity Building and Human Resource Development\n84. The international consultants for construction supervision will provide on-the-job training\nfor about 100 GCD staff and domestic consultants in construction supervision, quality control,\nand contract management. In addition, domestic consultants will provide training to GCD and\nGEMC staff in a variety of subjects, including financial management, resettlement policies and\nimplementation, environmental protection and monitoring, construction supervision, road safety,\nand road maintenance. Some of the training sessions may also require the participation of the\ninternational consultants for construction supervision.\n85. About 46 person-months of international training will be financed under the loan. The\ninternational consultants for construction supervision will help GCD organize 16 person-months of\ninternational training in construction supervision training, but will not provide the training services,\nunless requested by GCD during contract negotiations. About 30 person-months of international\n                  \n56  TA 3138-PRC: Regulatory Framework for the Engagement of Consultants, for $700,000, approved on 22\nDecember 1998.\n57  TA 3103-PRC: Strengthening the Government Auditing System, for $700,000, approved on 26 November 1998.", "28\ntraining  programs  will  aim  at  developing  the  human  resources  of  GCD  and  GEMC  and\nstrengthening  their  institutional  capability  in  highway  management,  human  resources\ndevelopment, international procurement and contract management, quality control, and road\noperation and maintenance. The EA will prepare for ADB\u2019s concurrence an international training\nplan including a program of courses and lists of candidates to be trained. Language training will\nbe provided to the trainees, if necessary. Each trainee will be required to submit a report on\ntraining received and make a presentation to the employer agency.\nH. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environmental Measures\n86. The  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  A.  The  environmental  impact\nassessment (EIA) was prepared by Xi\u2019an Highway University on behalf of the Government, and\nwas approved by the State Environmental Protection Administration on 22 January 2001. Public\nconsultations were conducted between June 1998 and September 1999 (Appendix 13). The\noverall conclusion of the EIA, which was confirmed during project processing, was that the\nadverse environmental impacts arising from the construction and operation of the project facilities\ncan be mitigated to acceptable levels. A summary EIA of the Project was circulated to ADB's\nBoard on 2 May 2001, and put on the ADB web page. The Chinese version of the EIA will be\nprovided in the Project\u2019s field offices for reference by the public and other interested parties.\n87. Adverse  environmental  impacts  were  minimized  by  the  selection  of  appropriate\nalignment. The EIA further assesses the environmental impacts of the selected alignment and\nprescribes  environmental  protection  and  mitigation  measures.  Environmental  impacts  and\nmitigation measures are summarized in Appendix 4 of the summary EIA. The environmental\nprotection and mitigation measures are estimated to cost Y30.2 million equivalent, including\nY29.1 million of capital costs that are included in the project cost estimates. The environmental\nmitigation measures will be incorporated in the bid documents and bill of quantities of the civil\nwork contracts. Monitoring will be undertaken to ensure that environmental impacts will be\nminimized  to  acceptable  levels,  and  meet  ADB's  environmental  requirements,  and  the\nGovernment\u2019s  environmental  standards.  Domestic  environment  consultants  will  be  recruited\nunder  the  construction  supervision  consulting  services  to  prepare  and  supervise  the\nimplementation of the environmental management plan, monitor the environmental and social\nimpacts, and prepare related reports.\n88. The road alignment will not pass through primary forests or other ecologically sensitive\nareas. However, to comply with the PRC's forestry law and ADB's forestry policy, GCD agreed\nto mitigate affected plantation forest areas by compensatory planting of an equivalent or larger\narea.  The  planting  program  will  be  implemented  in  coordination  with  the  GZAR  Forestry\nDepartment.\n89. The EIA identified the white-headed leaf monkey, a critically endangered species, in the\nproject area, i.e., in Longling (Bapen) Nature Reserve in Fusui County, Lobai Nature Reserve in\nChongzuo County, and in Longrui Nature Reserve, which is part of the larger Nonggang Nature\nReserve in Ningming and Langzuo counties. The project processing ADB missions confirmed\nEIA findings that the Project is unlikely to cause significant environmental impacts. Economic\ndevelopment in southern GZAR may bring adverse environmental impact on natural resources if\nprecaution is not taken. Considering the critical population of the white-headed leaf monkey,\nwhich has received international attention, ADB recommended that the GZAR government\naddress the possible environmental impact by preparing a comprehensive management plan of", "29\nthe three nature reserves. An advisory TA was included in the 2001 TA program for the PRC to\nhelp the GZAR government prepare this management plan.\n2. Social Analysis\na. Overall Impact\n90. Key issues were identified in the initial social assessment carried out during TA fact-\nfinding  in  March  1999  (footnote  1)  and  assessed  in  detail  during  the  social  analysis  and\nfeasibility  study.  The  key  issues  included  reducing  the  adverse  impacts  associated  with\nresettlement and maximizing the poverty reduction impact of the Project. The social analysis\nexamined the broader trends in the project area, and the needs of affected people and their\nability to benefit from the Project. Public consultations were also held to ascertain the support of\nthe  residents  for  the  Project  (Appendix  13).  A  summary  of  the  social  and  poverty  impact\nanalysis is in Appendix 14.\n91. The project area mainly covers five counties between Nanning City and the Viet Namese\nborder. These counties have a total population of around 1.6 million, of whom less than 20\npercent live in urban areas. The Project will directly benefit most of the population of the\ncounties of the project area, but also indirectly benefit a large share of the GZAR population of\n47.6 million through economic development induced by improvement of the road network. The\ndominant minority, the Zhuang, makes up over 80 percent of the total population of the project\narea. Several measures were recommended in the social analysis to maximize the poverty\nreduction impact and to mitigate the possible adverse impact of the Project. GCD will implement\nall recommendations listed in Appendix 14.\n92.  In addition, and to maximize the poverty reduction impact of the Project, (i) all roads\nfinanced by GCD under the Project will use wage labor, with wages set at market rates; and (ii)\nconstruction companies involved in civil works for the expressway will hire as much labor as\npossible from poor villages. Labor teams will be identified though the Poverty Alleviation and\nDevelopment  Office  (PADO),  the  All-China  Women\u2019s  Federation  (WF),  and  the  Labor\nDepartment. The PADO and the WF will identify appropriate team leaders in poor natural\nvillages in the Project area and train them as necessary. The team leaders will then select a\nlabor team from poor households in their natural villages. The county government, the Labor\nDepartment, PADO, and WF will coordinate the signing of the contracts between the contractors\nand the team leaders from poor villages.\n93. The social impact of the project in its entirety will be generally beneficial. The social\nanalysis indicates the following: (i) the largest beneficiary group will be the farmers, although\nmost of the easily quantifiable benefits will accrue to road users; (ii) many farmers, particularly\nthose on the complementary road program schemes, but also those near the expressway\ninterchanges, will be in a position to increase their agricultural production through improved\naccess to markets and cheaper transport costs; (iii) farmers in settlements served by the\ncomplementary road schemes will have improved access to education and health facilities and\nincreased information flows and interaction with the outside world; (iv) the expressway is likely\nto provide opportunities for construction employment, some permanent employment, revenues\nfrom the sale of construction materials, and trading and service activities in the service areas;\n(v) the Project will benefit most of the poor in the project area, with direct benefits arising mainly\nfrom the complementary road program rather than from the expressway, the impact of which will\nbe felt over a longer term; (vi) disbenefits will arise from resettlement and land acquisition, but\nwill be mitigated by compensation payments and replacement houses as per the resettlement", "30\nplan; and (vii) health risks could increase due to infectious diseases and potential crossborder\nHIV/AIDS transmission, but will be mitigated by distribution of targeted information, education,\nand communication during and after construction.\nb.  Impact on Minorities\n94. The population of the Project area is dominated by the Zhuang ethnic group. Because\nthe Zhuang are fully assimilated into the mainstream economy, their cultural identity will not be\nadversely affected by the Project.\nc. Gender Issues\n95. Women participate fully in the rural economy and frequently engage in small-scale\ntrading. They are however underrepresented as drivers and long-distance traders, in the public\nsector, and in the management of enterprises. The impacts on farmers therefore apply equally\nto women. The complementary road program will help women expand livestock rearing and\nother small-scale retail activities, and improve agriculture in general. Although 15 percent of the\nconstruction employment will go to women, they will be given equal opportunities and pay for\nconstruction  and  operational  jobs,  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and\nDevelopment.\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA. Financial and Economic Analysis\n1. Economic Analysis\n96. An economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated based on a comparison of the\nwith- and without-project situations (Appendix 15). The economic costs of the project roads\ninclude the resource costs for construction, operation, and maintenance, and the value of\nagricultural production from land lost permanently. Allowance has been made for costs of\nequipment replacement, road maintenance, and minor improvements to the network without the\nProject. The economic benefits generated by the project roads include (i) VOC and time savings\nfor those who remain on their original routes, (ii) VOC and time savings for those who choose to\npay the toll and divert to the new road, (iii) VOC savings on the improved local road network; (iv)\nbenefits from generated traffic, (v) savings in the direct and indirect costs of accidents, (vi)\nworking  capital  savings  to  freight  in  transit;  and  (vii)  resource  cost  savings  arising  from\ndiversions from rail to road. Environmental benefits will come from avoided vehicular emissions\nas a result of the reduced level of congestion on the NH 322. However, these benefits were not\nincluded in the analysis due to lack of an established methodology for their valuation. Economic\ncosts and benefits have been valued in economic prices.\n97. On this basis, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project is 20.0 percent,\nindicating that the Project is economically viable. The EIRR of the complementary road program\nalone is 22.7 percent. Results of sensitivity analysis confirm the robustness of the project's\neconomic viability. Changes in the key variables, such as 20 percent reduction in VOC savings\nand growth rate of normal traffic, do not significantly impact the economic viability. The capital\ncost would have to increase by about 100 percent over the base estimate for the EIRR to fall\nbelow 12 percent. The benefit level would have to decrease by more than 50 percent to achieve\nthe same effect. Given the previous experience in the PRC, variations of such magnitude are\nunlikely.", "31\n2. Financial Performance and Analysis\n98. The responsibility of toll setting has been devolved by MOC to provincial governments.\nWithin GZAR, the level of tolls is set by the Price Control Bureau in consultation with GCD. The\nprovincial government approves and endorses the toll rate proposal. The primary criteria for\nestablishing toll rates include (i) standard of the road, (ii) total construction and maintenance\ncosts, (iii) traffic volumes, and (iv) affordability of toll rates. Toll rate increases are decided on\nthe basis of the actual traffic volumes on the road, debt servicing, real income, and price\nincreases.\n99. The toll rates proposed for the project roads are in line with tolls proposed for other\nroads in Guangxi, and are in the high end of rates nationally. Based on preliminary financial\nanalysis, the proposed toll level would ensure the financial viability of the Project. GCD will\nundertake a toll study prior to opening the expressway and each year for five years thereafter, to\nconfirm the appropriate toll level, and will submit the results for ADB concurrence. ADB provided\nTA (footnote 44) to carry out a toll diversion study and the resulting manual has been distributed\nto PCDs. Findings of these studies will help GCD determine the toll levels for the proposed\nProject. Toll levels will be reviewed annually to account for increases in costs, and other factors.\nThe level and structure of the tolls for the tollway will be designed to ensure that the revenue will\ncover operation and maintenance costs, debt servicing, and depreciation in excess of debt\nservicing, and generate an acceptable rate of return on the investment as adjusted for inflation.\nIf an adjustment in the toll levels is required based on this principle, GCD will submit its toll\nadjustment plans for ADB\u2019s concurrence prior to finalizing and submitting it to the provincial\ngovernment for approval.\n100. The financial performance of the project expressway was forecast taking into account\nthe anticipated traffic, the projected operating costs, and the proposed toll rates. The working\nratio is expected to be below 12 percent over the project life. The debt service coverage ratio of\nmore than 1.2 is achievable from the first year of full operation. The debt-to-equity ratio will be\nbelow 65:35.\n101. The  GEMC,  when  established  as  a  corporation  independent  of  the  provincial\ngovernment, is expected to be financially autonomous. Projections based on currently available\ninformation and investment plans show that the expressway portfolios will be financially sound\n(Appendix 16). The after tax financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the project expressway\nincluding the cost of complementary roads is estimated at 9.0 percent, which is acceptable as it\nexceeds the estimated weighted average cost of capital of 3.1 percent (Appendix 17). Sensitivity\nanalysis shows that the Project will be able to meet all its financial obligations, and that the\nFIRR will stay above the estimated weighted average cost of capital under various adverse\nscenarios (20 percent increase in the project cost, 20 percent decrease in the toll revenue, 30\npercent increase in operation and maintenance costs, and a one-year implementation delay). A\ndevaluation of the yuan by 30 percent would reduce the FIRR to 8.1 percent. Without including\nthe complementary roads, which do not generate any direct revenues, the FIRR after tax is 9.7\npercent.\nB. Social Dimensions and Impact on Poverty\n102. The Government, with the assistance of ADB, prepared a poverty impact analysis for the\nProject, based on 1999 poverty data. Of the 1.6 million people living in the project area, about\n1.1 million are expected to directly benefit from the Project. The proportion of poor (footnote 50)", "32\namong project beneficiaries will be around 13 percent, slightly above the 12 percent poverty\nincidence in the PRC. During appraisal, the GZAR government provided new poverty data,\nbased on surveys conducted in 2000, which result in a much higher proportion of poor among\nproject beneficiaries.58 A summary of the poverty impact analysis is in Appendix 14.\n103. The economy in the project area is predominantly agricultural providing 40 percent of\nGDP and 75 percent of the employment. Industrial development is limited, accounting for 20\npercent of GDP, much lower then the 45 percent at the national level. There is a high level of\ntemporary migration to the eastern cities (especially Guangzhou and Shenzhen). About 30 to 40\npercent of the rural labor force has temporary jobs outside their area. Remittances from those\nmigrating to work temporarily in other provinces are an important factor in boosting household\nincomes, and reducing poverty. This results from the wide wage rate differences between rural\nand urban areas.\n104. Lack of access to economic opportunities is a significant cause of rural poverty in the\nPRC.  Poverty  counties  are  concentrated  in  remote  mountainous  areas  in  the  central  and\nwestern regions. In the project area, townships that are far from NH 322 have higher incidences\nof poverty than those closer to the highway. Linking the poor areas to growth centers will\nimprove the economic conditions and expand the scope for economic and social activities.\nDirect or indirect access to growth centers will provide market and employment opportunities,\nand better social services. The Project is expected to generate a sustainable poverty reduction\nimpact in the long term and a limited positive impact in the short term. The improvement of the\nroad network under the Project, including expressway, connectors, and complementary roads,\nwill boost investments in GZAR, which will create demand for the goods and services provided\nby the people in remote areas, even if they are not directly connected to the Project. The\ncombination of these anticipated effects will have a pronounced positive influence on poverty\nreduction in GZAR, within and beyond the project area.\n105. Poverty considerations have been an integral part of project design. The Project includes\nmeasures to extend socioeconomic benefits to the poor, in particular the complementary road\nprogram, explicitly formulated to target the remaining concentrations of poor populations in the\nproject area (para. 63). Virtually all settlements served by the complementary road scheme are\neither  classified  as  poor  today  or  have  only  recently  been  elevated  from  poverty  status.\nAdditional  measures  will  be  required  to  stimulate  and  encourage  increased  agricultural\nproduction and build new income opportunities for the poor.59\n106. During construction and operation, the Project will generate employment opportunities\nand priority will be given to poor people living in the project area. Approximately 16,500 laborers\nwill be hired for the duration of the construction. The Government has assured ADB that a large\nproportion of these will be from labor teams identified through PADO and that they will be paid a\nmarket  wage.  In  addition,  during  the  operational  phase  up  to  750  poor  workers  will  be\nemployed,  whose  living  conditions  will  improve.  The  wages  from  employment  during\nconstruction and operation of the Project will increase family incomes, raise living standards,\n                  \n58 Based on the new data, which are still unofficial, the proportion of poor among the GZAR population would be\naround 32 percent, much higher than estimated in 1999, due to the correction of overestimation of rural incomes\nbefore 2000. The official 2000 poverty data will be available by the end of 2001, and taken into account during loan\ninception when updating the base line used for the project performance monitoring system (para. 82).\n59To implement such measures, ADB is helping the Guangxi PADO prepare a project proposal for financing under\nthe Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. The proposal includes investment in fruit tree planing, and training of poor\nfarmers to improve quality, productivity, and marketing of their produce.", "33\nand thus reduce poverty. The impact of the Project on poverty reduction will be evaluated during\nand after Project implementation.\nC. Project Risks\n107. The Project has been formulated to reduce potential technical and economic risks. The\nmain  technical  risks,  which  could  result  in  implementation  delays  and  cost  overruns,  are\nassociated with the six large bridges and two tunnels. To mitigate these risks, international\nconsultants  have  reviewed  the  proposed  construction  methods.  The  prequalification  of\ncontractors will focus on their financial and technical capability in handling similar works. During\nthe construction period, monitoring and contract management information systems will be set up\nand implemented with the assistance of the international consultants for timely identification of\ntechnical problems and implementation of corrective measures. GCD has proven experience\nand has satisfactorily implemented similar projects. There are no major environmental and\nresettlement risks and adequate mitigation and monitoring mechanisms have been built into the\nProject.  Appropriate  coordination  and  monitoring  mechanisms  will  be  put  in  place  for\nresettlement.\n108. Economic  performance  in  the  project  influence  area  would  have  to  deteriorate\nsubstantially for the Project to lose economic viability. While a financial risk is associated with\nconstruction  and  operation  of  the  expressway,  its  extent  will  depend  upon  the  actual\nconstruction costs when contracts are awarded and during the subsequent implementation. To\nmitigate  this  risk,  GCD  is  consciously  oriented  to  building  up  a  commercial  business\nenvironment for expressway operations, and the project expressway will receive substantial\nequity injections from the central and provincial governments. As the Project will generate\nrevenue in domestic currency, there is a risk related to exchange rate changes. Sensitivity tests\nindicate that an adverse exchange rate change will have only a limited effect on the FIRR.\nVI. ASSURANCES\n109. The following assurances in addition to the standard assurances will be incorporated in\nthe legal documents:\n(i)  Counterpart  Financing.  The  Government  and  GZAR  will  ensure  that  GCD\nobtains, on a timely basis, all funds and resources necessary for construction of\nthe project roads, in accordance with the financing plan for the Project as agreed\nto by ADB.\n(ii)  Construction  Quality  and  Sound  Development  Management.  GCD  will\nensure  that  the  project  roads  are  constructed  in  accordance  with  the\nGovernment\u2019s technical standards of highway engineering. GCD will promote\nsound  development  management,  and  ensure  that  quality  control,  contract\nmanagement, and construction supervision, are performed in accordance with\nnational standards and internationally accepted practices. GCD will (a) provide\nthe international team leader with all the necessary powers to review and certify\nvariation orders and contractors\u2019 monthly payments, prior to their approval by the\nchief supervision engineer; (b) submit for ADB concurrence the TOR of the\ncontract management specialist, quantity engineer, and quality control specialist\nhired as deputy chiefs of the Supervision Division, Measurement Office, and\nCentral Laboratory, respectively, of the Chief Supervision Engineer Office; (c)\nsubmit for ADB concurrence the resumes of the candidates selected for these", "34\nthree positions; (d) confirm to ADB the recruitment of the selected candidates;\nand (e) find internationally recruited consultants to fill these positions, if the\nselected domestic consultants can not satisfy the requirements of the TOR.\n(iii)  Road  Traffic  Safety.  GCD  will  ensure  that  the  recommended  road  safety\nenhancement measures are incorporated in the design of the Project and are\nimplemented, and that road safety audits are carried out before construction\nstarts, and again before operations commence. The Government will ensure that\nthe project roads are adequately patrolled to mitigate against illegal use of the\nfacilities.\n(iv)  Axle Load. GZAR will take appropriate measures to prevent overloading on the\nproject roads by installing vehicle axle weighing equipment at selected locations,\nand making suitable arrangements for operation of such equipment. Prior to\ncommercial operation of the project roads, GCD will submit to ADB a statement\nindicating  legal  axle  load  limits,  frequency  of  testing,  and  penalties  for\ninfringement.\n(v)  Operation and Maintenance. GZAR will ensure that, upon completion of the\nProject, the project facilities will be adequately operated and maintained, and that\nthe project road pavement will be maintained at an international roughness index\nlevel of not more than 3 meters per kilometer.\n(vi)  Corporatization. Six months prior to the expected date of project completion,\nand not later than 30 June 2004, GCD will have created a corporation, tentatively\ncalled  Guangxi  Expressway  Management  Company  (GEMC),  to  construct,\noperate,  and  maintain  all  expressways  in  GZAR.  Details  on  the  creation  of\nGEMC, and transfer of assets, revenues, and debt service obligations from GCD\nto  GEMC,  including  GEMC's  financial  statements  for  the  Project,  will  be\nsubmitted for ADB's approval six months prior to GEMC creation. GCD will enter\ninto an agreement with GEMC to ensure autonomy of operations, encourage the\nestablishment of road facility performance indicators, and facilitate refinancing of\nroad sector assets. Prior to opening to traffic, the onlending agreement between\nGZAR and GEMC for transfer of part or all of the ADB loan will be submitted for\nADB\u2019s  concurrence.  After  GEMC  has  been  created  as  a  corporation,  the\nresponsibilities  of  GCD  as  EA  will  be  transferred  to  GEMC.  Prior  to  the\nassumption of GCD\u2019s responsibilities under the Project by GEMC, ADB will enter\ninto a project agreement with GEMC, which will set forth the responsibilities of\nGEMC as EA under the Project.\n(vii)  Tolls. The tolls for the project roads will be set at levels sufficient to ensure the\nmaximum debt service coverage, the operation and maintenance costs, and\ndepreciation in excess of debt service, and to generate an acceptable return on\nassets as adjusted from time to time for inflation. Six months prior to the start of\ncommercial operations, GCD will prepare and submit for ADB\u2019s concurrence a\nreport on the proposed toll structure and levels, before submitting the application\nto the GZAR government for its approval. For the first five years of operation,\nGCD will review the toll structure and levels annually and submit a report to ADB.\nIf the toll levels must be adjusted to cover inflation, GCD will submit for ADB\u2019s\nconcurrence the toll adjustment plan, prior to finalizing and submitting it to the\nGZAR government for its approval.", "35\n(viii)  Financial Ratios. To ensure the financial sustainability of the operation of the\ntolled project roads, GCD and GEMC after it is established, will maintain (a) a\nworking  ratio  (operating  and  annual  maintenance  costs,  excluding  periodic\nmaintenance,  to  revenue)  of  not  more  than  12  percent;  (b)  a  debt  service\ncoverage ratio of not less than 1.2; and (c) a debt-to-equity ratio of less than\n65:35. To this end, GZAR will provide or cause to be provided, to GEMC on a\ntimely basis all funds needed in addition to their internally generated revenues.\n(ix)  Nongovernment  Financing.  Six  months  prior  to  the  opening  of  the  project\nroads, GCD will analyze the feasibility of attracting nongovernment investment\nfunds  for  the  project  facilities  (including  private  sector  participation  in  the\noperation,  maintenance,  and  management  of  the  project  roads);  report  its\nconclusions and objectives to ADB; and outline the approach for achieving these\nobjectives.\n(x)  Environment. GCD will ensure that the Project is constructed and operated in\naccordance  with  environmental  procedures  and  guidelines  of  the  national\ngovernment,  local  government,  and  ADB;  that  any  adverse  environmental\nimpacts arising from the Project are minimized by implementing the mitigation\nmeasures  and  environmental  monitoring  program  presented  in  the  EIA  and\nsummary  EIA;  and  that  the  implementation  of  the  environmental  monitoring\nprogram, including mitigation measures, and copies of permits, licenses, and\nclearances  is  regularly  reported  to  ADB  as  specified  in  the  EIA,  including\nviolations of safety and environmental standards, if any, and how they have been\ncorrected.\n(xi)  Land Acquisition and Resettlement. GCD will ensure that the resettlement\nplan is carried out promptly and efficiently, including land acquisition, in line with\nthe PRC Land Administration Law and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement;\nthat all affected people are consulted on the entitlements at least four months\nbefore ground clearing commences; and that sufficient budget is made available,\nthe compensation to the affected people is made in a timely manner, and those\naffected will be at least as well off after the Project as they were before it. GCD\nwill ensure that the implementation of the resettlement plan is monitored and\nevaluated independently by a local institute and reported annually to ADB. GCD\nwill keep ADB informed of the progress of resettlement activities through regular\nreporting as specified in the resettlement plan.\n(xii)  Poverty Reduction. GCD, in cooperation with the Guangxi PADO and Labor\nBureau, will ensure that (a) contractors maximize the employment of local poor\npeople for constructing the project roads; and (b) local villagers working for the\ncomplementary road program will receive a salary based on market rates. GCD\nwill monitor the impacts on poverty with the assistance of a local institute. GCD\nwill  provide  semiannual  monitoring  reports  on  these  impacts  to  ADB  during\nconstruction, as part of the quarterly reports, and an evaluation report three years\nafter project completion.\n(xiii)  Complementary Road Program. GZAR and GCD will (a) ensure that the county\ngovernments implement the complementary road program as agreed with ADB, (b)\nprovide, in a timely manner, adequate funds to implement the program and the", "36\nsocial and environmental mitigation measures for the program, and (c) ensure that\nthe  county  governments  adequately  operate  and  maintain  the  roads\nconstructed/upgraded under the program.\n(xiv)  Gender  and  Development.  GCD  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Policy on Gender and\nDevelopment during implementation of the Project, and will take all necessary\nactions to encourage women living in the project area to participate in planning\nand implementing the Project, including construction work. GCD will monitor\neffects on women during project implementation, through gender-disaggregated\ndata  in  the  resettlement  plan  and  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  system,  in\nconsultation with the All-China Women\u2019s Federation at the provincial and local\nlevels.\n(xv)  Health Risks. GCD, together with the appropriate authorities, will ensure that\ncontractors disseminate information on the risks of sexually transmitted diseases\nto those employed during project implementation. GCD will also ensure that\nsimilar information is disseminated to transport operators during operation of the\nproject facilities.\n(xvi)  Vehicle  Emissions.  GCD  will  cooperate  with  and  assist  the  environmental\nprotection bureau in controlling vehicle emissions on the project roads. GCD will\nsubmit  to  ADB,  before  commercial  operation  of  the  project  facilities,  the\nGovernment-prescribed  emission  regulation  limits,  penalties  for  their\ninfringement, and a plan for operation of vehicle emissions testing stations.\n(xvii)  Monitoring and Evaluation. GCD will monitor and evaluate project impacts\nthrough a project performance management system to ensure that the project\nfacilities are managed effectively and the benefits, particularly to the poor, are\nmaximized. GCD will collect data agreed with ADB prior to implementation, at\ncompletion, and annually for three years thereafter.\n(xviii)  Human  Resource  Development  and  Training.  GCD  will  prepare  a  human\nresource development plan based on their future requirements and strategy.\nPrior to undertaking international training financed under the ADB loan, GCD will\nprepare for the concurrence of ADB (a) a training plan and a list of candidates\nnominated for international training, (b) a program of workshops to be delivered\nat GCD by those trained internationally, and (c) a list of training equipment and\naids required to strengthen and implement GCD\u2019s in-country training programs.\nUpon completion of the workshops, GCD will provide ADB with an evaluation of\nthe  international  training  and  workshops,  and  identify  subjects  that  are\nappropriate for formal incorporation into GCD\u2019s regular staff training curricula.\n(xix)  Change in Ownership. If (a) any change in ownership of the project facilities, or\n(b) any sale, transfer, or assignment of GCD\u2019s or GEMC's interest in the project\nroads, is anticipated, the Government, GZAR, and GCD will consult ADB at least\nsix months before the change is implemented. The Government, GZAR, and\nGCD  will  ensure  that  any  proposed  change  in  the  ownership  of  the  project\nfacilities is carried out in a legal and transparent manner.", "37\nVII.

Technical Assistance Findings and Experience in the PRC\n1. Cooperative Joint Venture\n1. The  cooperative  joint  venture  has  been  the  most  common  method  of  using\nnongovernment funds in toll road financing in the Peoples' Republic of China (PRC) for several\nreasons:  (i)  strong  equity  investor  interest  in  toll  roads;  (ii)  benefits  from  the  cooperative\ncharacteristics of this type of joint venture;1 (iii) limited lender interest in toll road projects, mainly\ndue to unresolved problems of risk allocation; and (iv) the absence of debt service coverage\nrequirements. Its primary disadvantage is its high cost to road users and to the economy. Equity\ninvestors require a higher rate of return than lenders, and seek to obtain this from road users\nthrough higher tolls, reducing the net economic benefits from projects. The current expected rate\nof return on cooperative joint venture equity for PRC road projects is about 18 percent. The Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) facilitated the development of cooperative joint ventures in Guangdong,\nHebei, Hunan, and Sichuan provinces by investing about $15 million through the China Assets\nHolding Limited, and $71 million in the DeMat TransAsia Holdings Limited, through the Asian\nInfrastructure Fund (Table).\n2. Securitization\n2. Securitization through an initial public offering can benefit from cash flow accruing at the\noperating entity level as well as at the project level. The share of the toll road entity sold to public\ninvestors usually ranges from 20 percent to 40 percent. The advantage of this financing option is\nits low cost. Securitization is undertaken at the operation stage, after certain project risks have\nbeen mitigated, such as construction delays, cost overruns, and initial traffic levels. An H share\nlisting on the stock exchange in Hong Kong, China is an inexpensive modality with a high price-\nearning ratio2 (6 to 17 times in 1999). B share listings on the Shenzhen or Shanghai stock\nexchanges are slightly more expensive with a price-earning ratio of 10 to 15 times in 1999, which\nis lower and less volatile than A share listings (with an average monthly price earning ratio of\nabout 54 times in 2000).3 The greatest disadvantage of this financing modality is the time required\nto  complete  the  regulatory  formalities.  In  addition,  in  the  Shenzhen  and  Shanghai  stock\nexchanges, companies must have three profitable years of operation before they can be listed.\nBecause of these issues, this modality is more appropriate as a refinancing instrument.\n3. Since 1995, 15 PRC expressway companies and infrastructure developers have been\nlisted on the stock exchanges in Hong Kong, China; Shanghai; and Shenzhen.4 Two of these\n                                                          \n1  In a cooperative joint-venture scheme, the foreign investor receives a percentage of profit higher than its equity\nshare during the early years of operation until its equity investment is fully recovered, and less over the following\nyears.  Normal  equity  joint  ventures  are  less  attractive  because  there  is  no  such  preference  for  foreign\ninvestments.\n2  Calculated as the stock price divided by the earnings per share.\n3  An H share listing involves the sale of shares on the stock exchange in Hong Kong, China only in foreign\ncurrency. A and B listings involve the sale of shares on a PRC stock exchange (Shanghai or Shenzhen) in local\nand foreign currencies, respectively. The Government has recently allowed Chinese with available foreign\ncurrency to buy B shares, which is likely to boost their price.\n4  These are: Anhui, Jiangsu, Shenzhen, Sichuan, and Zhejiang Expressways and Cheung Kong, New World, and\nRoad King Infrastructures, in Hong Kong (H shares); Northeast (Jilin) Expressway in Shanghai (A shares); Ganyue,\nGuandong, Hainan, and Hubei Expressways in Shenzhen (A shares); and Guangdong and Hunan Expressways in\nShenzhen (B shares).", "49\nAppendix 5, page 2\nprojects were financed by ADB.5 After three years of profitable operations, the Jilin Provincial\nExpressway Corporation6 established the Northeast Expressway Co., Ltd.7 by securitizing the\nfuture toll revenues of the expressway. The company went public on 10 August 1999, offering\n25 percent of the total shares on the Shanghai stock exchange as an A share listing. The issue\nprice was Y4.00 per share and the trading prices ranged between Y4.92 and Y6.40 after listing.\nA price earning ratio of 44 was achieved during 1999. ADB helped review the initial public\noffering proposal and revenue projections of the corporation for this transaction. The Hunan\nExpressway Project was completed in November 1996, and one of the project components,\ntogether with other toll roads and bridges, was listed on the Shenzhen stock exchange, B share\nsection, on 28 January 1999. Because of a stock split in May 1999, earnings per share have\ndecreased slightly, while the market capitalization has reached Y2,629 million. Average price\nearning ratio was 30 in 1999.\n3. Revenue Bond Financing\n4. Revenue  bond  financing  involves  the  sale  of  rated  notes  backed  by  a  pledge  of  a\ncompany\u2019s cash-flow sources. This is a relatively new highway financing modality in Asia. In\nAugust 1996, Zuhai Municipality in Guangdong Province completed a landmark company-level\nrevenue bond financing, which raised $200 million from investors in the United States (US) for the\nZhuhai  Highway  Company  Limited.  The  main  problem  of  this  financing  option  is  the  weak\nregulatory framework, which results in a difficult and time-consuming procedure for securing the\nnecessary approvals. The US dollar rate of return required by investors in a company-level\nrevenue bond was in the 10-15 percent range for a PRC issue in 1999.\n4. Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) Structure\n5. Although the BOT approach has been widely used in the power generation industry, it has\nmet with only limited success in the roads, except where the project is a natural monopoly, such\nas a bridge or tunnel. BOT financing transfers risk to the private sector. It relieves the government\nof funding responsibility, but makes the investment less attractive to private investors in a high-\nrisk environment. In the PRC, the State Development Planning Commission has developed a\npolicy and regulatory framework to facilitate the formulation and award of BOT projects, but this\nhas yet to be formalized through Government decree. One of a few road projects in the PRC\nattractive enough to be developed under a BOT scheme is the Tianjin-Shugang Highway project\nto upgrade and operate a 40 km three-lane dual expressway between Tianjin City and Tanggu\nPort,  under  a  25-year  concession.  ADB  invested  in  the  Asian  Infrastructure  Development\nCompany  that  holds  a  $36.2  million  equity  stake  in  the  Tianjin-Shugang  Highway.  Another\nsuccessful BOT agreement was concluded in December 2000 in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous\nRegion for the Liujing-Xingyue section of the Nanning-Guangzhou Expressway, which has a very\nhigh expected traffic. Although ADB attempted to develop the Yangjiang-Dianbai expressway in\nGuangdong Province on a BOT basis, the feasibility study8 concluded that the project was not\nfinancially  viable  for  this  modality,  because  of  weak  performance  criteria  and  high  risks\nassociated with the traffic forecast.9 ADB is providing further assistance in this area through\n                                                          \n5  Loan 1262-PRC: Jilin Expressway Project, for $ 126 million, approved on 9 November 1993; and Loan 1261-PRC:\nHunan Expressway Project, for $74 million, approved on 9 November 1993.\n6  Wholly owned subsidiary of the Jilin Provincial Communications Department.\n7  Founded jointly by the Jilin and the Heilongjiang Provincial Expressway Corporations and a subsidiary of MOC.\n8  TA 2649-PRC: Facilitating Build-Operate-Transfer Modality in the Highway Sector, for $1.1 million, approved on\n27 September 1996.\n9  The World Bank attempted to develop a bridge project on a BOT basis in Hubei Province, but it did not\nmaterialize.", "50\nAppendix 5, page 3\ntechnical assistance10 to develop an 80-kilometer section of the Nanjin-Hanzhou expressway in\nJiangsu Province on a BOT basis.\n6. The initial model BOT projects were structured to have 100 percent foreign financing. The\nAsian currency turmoil made investors and commercial lenders cautious about infrastructure\nprojects that use foreign currency debt in construction but generate revenues in local currency.\nPart of ADB\u2019s policy dialogue has been to encourage the Government to allow BOT sponsors to\narrange some domestic financing should they so wish. Other potential risks for BOT projects are\nlower-than-expected levels of traffic and revenues in the early years of operation, construction\ncost overruns, implementation delays, and land acquisition problems. The current lack of legal\nand regulatory clarity has also increased the perceived risk of the BOT approach, making it\nunattractive for most PRC road projects. The model based on cooperative joint ventures is rather\ncostly, and hence feasible only for projects with high financial rates of return.\nB.  ADB Investment in Private Sector Funds in the Road Sector\n7. ADB, through its Private Sector Group, has holdings in several funds that invested $122.7\nmillion in equity in seven road projects, mostly in the eastern coast of the PRC (Table). The\nprojects in which ADB has participated are well established in the market, with satisfactory track\nrecords and quality assets. As such, most are operating profitably, although traffic flows are\ngenerally below those forecast. Future financial returns are expected to improve as the projects\nmature; most are still in the early stages of operation when revenues have not peaked. In an\nexception to the generally good performance, revenues are much lower than anticipated in one\ncase because of inadequate toll collection arrangements and a competing road with similar travel\ndistance and time.\n                                                          \n10 TA 3569-PRC: Jiangsu Highway BOT Project, for $555,000, approved on 12 December 2000.", "51\nAppendix 5, page 4\nInvestments in the PRC Road Sector by Private Sector Funds\nwith ADB Holdings\nInvestment No., Equity\nFund Name Investee/Projects ($ million)\n7072, China Assets Zhongshan Dongfu Road and Bridge Company 9.19\nHoldings Ltd.

Existing Traffic\n1. During the feasibility study for the Project, carried out by the design institute, traffic\nsurveys were carried out for traffic analysis, pavement design and economic and financial\nevaluation.  The  surveys  included  manual  counts  and  origin  and  destination  surveys.  The\nsurveys were verified and updated by the project preparatory technical assistance consultants in\n2000 and the additional work included a survey of traffic traveling to the Viet Nam border\ncrossings and free trade area1.\n2. Traffic increased considerably during 1990-1997 on the existing national highway (NH)\n322 between Nanning and the border with Viet Nam. Overall annual growth in this period has\nbeen 13 percent for motorized traffic and 5 percent for nonmotorised vehicles, although in some\nroad sections it is as high as 21 percent overall. The increase reflects the high economic growth\nin counties adjacent to the highway over the same period.\n3. Many sections of NH 322 have traffic volumes over capacity levels and the journey from\nNanning to the border currently takes five hours for the 220 km for passenger cars and longer\nfor trucks. When breakdowns occur these times can be much longer. If highway capacity is not\nincreased, average times will increase dramatically and economic growth will not be sustained.\nTraffic volumes on NH 322 in 2000 were 6,000 medium truck equivalent (MTE) units per day at\nWuxu, 30 km from Nanning, dropping to 1,500 MTE near Banli in the middle of the project area,\nand rising to 5,000 MTE close to Ningming town and nearly 3,000 MTE close to the border. This\nindicates a slowing in the growth rates since 1998 except in the border area, where traffic\ngrowth has been over 20 percent for the last two years.\nB.  Traffic Forecast\n4. Future traffic demand forecasts were prepared for the proposed expressway and the\nsurrounding road network for the years 2005, 2015, and 2025. The forecasts were prepared\nusing the feasibility study 1999 trip matrixes and a model of the road network within the project\narea coupled with the major roads outside the project area within Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous\nRegion (GZAR). The forecasts of travel demand use forecasts of economic growth within the\nproject area and in GZAR and the rest of People's Republic of China (PRC), estimates of\nelasticity  of  demand,  and  projected  future  changes  in  freight  and  passenger  vehicle  fleet\ncomposition. Allowance was made for some limited diversion from rail to road. Waterborne\ntraffic in the area is negligible and unlikely to divert, and there is little air traffic; the only possible\naffected route would be that between Nanning and Hanoi.\n5. As the existing NH 322 will be very congested by 2005 when the expressway opens,\nsome allowance was made for traffic suppression on this road in the without-Project case. With\nthe expressway constructed this suppressed traffic will be released.\n6. Some trips will be generated as a result of the new expressway and class I road, from (i)\npeople who choose to travel more as a result of improved highway and reduced travel costs\n(travel from Nanning to Pingxiang and back will take a single day); (ii) new trips made by people\nwho would not travel due to the condition of the existing highway; (iii) additional national and\ninternational trade resulting from reduced transport costs; (iv) new and relocated businesses\n                                                          \n1  This traffic was not defined in the original surveys.", "53\nAppendix 6, page 2\nalong the new highway taking advantage of reduced transport costs; and (v) new trips due to\nincreased tourist numbers particularly between the PRC and Viet Nam.\n7. Volumes of traffic forecast on the NanYou Expressway and on the existing parallel NH\n322 are summarized in Table A6.1. The forecasts clearly show the need for additional road\ncapacity in the corridor after 2005.\n8. Because of the large time and distance savings (over four hours in 2005 and 45 km from\nNanning to YouYiGuan) and poor condition of the existing road, virtually all (over 95 percent)\nlong distance traffic will divert to the new road under the toll system proposed. Lesser rates\napply to short haul traffic although, as some of the major towns on the route (Fusui and\nChongzuo) lie far from NH 322 and close to the expressway, diversion rates are also high for\ntraffic from these towns.\n9. Construction of the expressway will provide significant savings in travel times both for\nusers who divert to the new expressway and those who remain on the existing NH 322. These\nsavings are shown in Table A6.2. The table sets out travel time savings for freight traffic\nbetween major towns in the project area both on the expressway and the existing road when the\nexpressway is complete, compared to times on the existing NH 322 if the expressway is not\nconstructed. Time savings for other vehicles are similar.\nTable A6.1: Forecast Average Annual Daily Traffic Volume by Section by Year\n1998a\nMTE/day NH 322 Expressway Total Percent Growth\nCorridor Section\n(per annum)\n2005\nWuxu-Xichang 5,850 2,400 7,350 9,750 7.6\nXichang-Banli (Fusui County) 2,500 1,000 4,300 5,300 11.3\nBanli-Ningming (Chongzuo County) 3,600 5,300 3,800 9,100 14.2\nNingming-Xiashi (Ningming County) 1,500 1,000 2,300 3,300 11.9\nXiashi-Pingxian 2,000 400 3,600 4,000 10.4\nPingxiang-YouYiGuanb, c 900 1,600 1,600 8.6\n2015\nWuxu-Xichang 3,350 14,100 17,450 6.0\nXichang-Banli (Fusui County) 1,900 8,500 10,400 7.0\nBanli-Ningming (Chongzuo County) 5,600 8,000 13,600 4.1\nNingming-Xiashi (Ningming County) 1,900 5,100 7,000 7.8\nXiashi-Pingxian 1,700 6,300 8,000 7.2\nPingxiang-YouYiGuan b, c 2,900 2,900 6.1\n2025\nWuxu-Xichang 4,500 25,250 29,750 5.5\nXichang-Banli (Fusui County) 3,200 16,100 19,300 6.4\nBanli-Ningming (Chongzuo County) 5,900 16,000 21,900 4.9\nNingming-Xiashi (Ningming County) 3,200 11,350 14,550 7.6\nXiashi-Pingxian 4,300 11,900 16,200 7.3\nPingxiang-YouYiGuanb, c 5,000 5,000 5.6\nMTE=medium truck equivalent unit, NH=national highway.\na On existing NH 322 road.\nb Existing road and new Class I road use substantially the same alignment over this section.\nLocal slow moving traffic will use a service road where the two alignments coincide.\nc Does not include local service traffic to free trade areas.

Crossborder Traffic\n10. Guangxi's foreign trade grew rapidly from a low base in the early 1990s, with an annual\ngrowth rate of 18 percent between 1990-1998. Trade with Viet Nam has also grown steadily in\nthe 1990s following relaxation of border controls in the mid-1990s. The road and rail routes from\nNanning to Viet Nam through the project area accounts for half of Guangxi trade with Vietnam\nthus traffic traveling to the border areas has grown correspondingly. There is one rail and four\nroad border crossings in Pingxiang City (county) and trade between the PRC and Viet Nam\ntakes place under the auspices of the Customs General or less formally through the local\nfrontier trading administration. The majority of trade is of the less formal type.\n11. Formal Government trading passes through the customs at Friendship Pass, the junction\nof NH 322 and Viet Nam NH 1. The proposed road will also meet Viet Nam NH 1 at this spot.\nTourist traffic also uses this crossing point. The majority of trade however uses the two free\ntrade areas close to Pingxiang City at Pozhai and Nongyao. Roads from these areas connect\nwith NH 322 close to Pingxiang City, about 20 km from Friendship Pass. At present all goods to\nand from Viet Nam by road are transshipped at the free trade areas.\n12. Following the signing of the Frontier Trade Agreement in 1999 a further agreement, the\nHighway Transport Agreement, was signed (December 2000). This has facilitated crossborder\ntraffic between Guangxi and the three bordering provinces of Viet Nam. The two countries hold\nregular  meetings  and  discussions  to  improve  the  crossborder  movements  of  freight  and\npassenger  vehicles  in  the  Nanning-Hanoi  economic  corridor.  Guangxi  Communications\nDepartment considers that the Project and the improvement of Viet Nam's NH 1, financed by the\nAsian Development Bank, will facilitate the discussions by providing better road infrastructure in\nthe corridor. At present, however, the permitted bus and truck routes between Guangxi and Viet\nNam are restrictive and are unlikely to stimulate growth by any significant amount. With further\nfreeing of travel restrictions, however, crossborder traffic will rise given the shortened travel time\nfrom Nanning to the border.\n13. In 1999 over 251,000 tons of goods crossed into Vietnam by road from Pingxiang\nthrough the free trade areas and 189,000 tonnes was imported. In addition 170,000 tonnes went", "55\nAppendix 6, page 4\nthrough Friendship Pass. Only 61,000 tonnes was transshipped by rail.2 In the last three years\nthe tonnage has grown at an annual rate of 16 percent and this rate should continue to rise as\ntrade restrictions are further liberalized.\n14. Given the fluid nature of ongoing discussions on further agreements on crossborder\ntrade it is difficult to estimate with any confidence the future growth in traffic going to and over\nthe border. For this reason, only traffic growth following normal economic growth has been used\nin the economic and financial evaluations for the Project. However, these growth rates are\nalmost certainly understated.\n15. Benefits of increased trade as a result of the Project are similarly difficult to estimate.\nWhile the vehicle operating cost benefits are measurable for traffic using the project roads\nincluded in the project evaluation, the liberalization of border crossing and trade will reduce the\nneed for the free trade areas and transshipment requirements; although through traffic will\nincrease, local growth in Pingxiang City may suffer.\n                                                          \n2  Because of the difference in rail gauge between the two countries all goods must be transferred at Pingxiang City.\nThis will continue to put rail travel at a disadvantage and the move from rail to road is likely to continue.", " 56\nSUMMARY COMPLEMENTARY ROAD PROGRAM Appendix 7\nIn which\nCost        \nLengtha  GCD Poverty \nRoad Improvement Type (million  GCD \n(km) Alleviation  Other\nYuan) Subvention \nFund\nFushui County\nCounty Roads\nClass III-paved 50.00 12.00 12.00\nClass IV-paved 42.00 10.40 5.40 5.00\nVillage Roads\nClass IV-unpaved 25.20 0.91 0.47 0.44\nChongzuo County\nCounty Roads\nClass III-paved 40.00 9.60 9.60\nVillage Roads\nClass IV-unpaved 27.00 1.62 0.60 1.02\nLongzhou County\nCounty Roads\nClass III-paved 142.40 113.14 3.08 101.50 8.56\nNingming County\nCounty Roads\nClass III-paved 38.20 33.80 0.96 30.17 2.67\nClass IV-paved 12.00 3.48 2.88 0.60\nVillage Roads\nClass IV-paved 111.00 32.20 26.64 5.56\nPingxiang City\nCounty Roads\nClass III-paved 11.50 10.17 0.29 9.09 0.79\nVillage Roads\nClass III-paved 7.30 2.56 2.19 0.37\nTotal 506.60 229.88 4.33 200.54 25.01\na The improvement of 471 km of roads, earlier identified to be included in the complementary road program, has\n  already started and will be completed before the end of 2001.

Status of the Resettlement Plan\n1. The proposed Nanning to Youyiguan expressway project in southern Guangxi Zhuang\nAutonomous  Region  (GZAR)  will  consist  of  four  main  physical  works  components:  (i)\nconstruction of about 136 kilometers (km) of expressway from Nanning to Ningming, and 43 km\nof class I road from Ningming to Youyiguan, including interchanges, toll stations, bridges and\nservice  areas;  (ii)  construction  of  48  km  of  class  II  connector  roads;  (iii)  construction  or\nimprovement of 110 km of village access roads in the expressway vicinity; and (iv) improvement\nof approximately 500 km of complementary roads in five counties. For the first two components,\nbased on detailed survey, the resettlement impacts and measures are covered by the current\nresettlement plan. Due to still in early planning stage, the last two components are not covered\nin the plan. However, since both components will mainly involve upgrading on the existing\ntownship and village roads, little land acquisition will be expected. The GZAR government\nassured the Asian Development Bank (ADB) that if additional farmland will be required, the\naffected  people  will  receive  the  same  compensation  and  other  assistance  provided  in  the\nresettlement plan.\n2. The Guangxi Communication Department (GCD) is the project Executing Agency. Xi\u2019an\nHighway University prepared a resettlement plan in February 2000, based on the preliminary\ntechnical design, incorporating socioeconomic survey and village data collection of impacts. The\nresettlement plan has been updated to take into account subsequent design modifications\nrequested by the Ministry of Communications and recently approved GZAR land administration\ndirectives.\nB.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n3. The expressway and connector and link roads will affect 21 townships, 61 administrative\nvillages,  and  187  village  groups  in  6  counties:  Chongzuo,  Fushui,  Longzhou,  Ningming,\nPingxian and Yongning. According to the initial detailed resettlement plan survey, which is being\nupdated based on the changes proposed, nearly 1,200 hectares (ha) of land will be acquired, 65\npercent of which is cultivated land, comprising paddy (15 percent), with the remaining 85\npercent including dry fields, vegetables, and sugarcane. Other identified assets on the land\ninclude telecommunications and electrical infrastructure, ponds for fish and lotus cultivation,\nsheds,  walls,  graves,  and  economic  trees.  The  assets  will  all  be  compensated  for  at\nreplacement  value.  Approximately  196  ha  of  land  will  be  borrowed  temporarily  during\nconstruction. Land acquisition will directly affect an estimated 30,600 people in about 6,440\nhouseholds. However, given the relatively high farmland per capita ratios, which range from\n0.10 ha per person in Ningming to 0.18 ha per person in Chongzuo, the number of people\nrequiring full economic rehabilitation, defined as losing their share of farmland, is likely to be\nless than 10,000.\n4. About  14,000  square  meters  of  structures,  including  houses,  will  be  demolished,\nnecessitating  relocation  of  about  200  households  and  1,100  people.  The  households  will\ngenerally be moved a short distance to another site within the same administrative village.\nC.  Policy Framework and Entitlements\n5. For people unavoidably affected, the resettlement objective is to achieve equal, or better\nincome and living standards in line with the 1998 Land Law of the People's Republic of China", "62\nAppendix 12, page 2\nand ADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. GCD will ensure that any people losing land,\nhousing, other assets or income will be assisted to restore their income and living standards.\nGZAR in 2000 issued a directive to implement the 1998 Land Law to cover large infrastructure\nprojects,  with  the  land  compensation  set  at  7  times  the  annual  average  output  value  for\ncultivated land, and the resettlement subsidy will be 5-14 times the value, depending on the\naverage per capita farmland. These rates are within the range set by the 1998 Land Law. Given\nthe average yield and per capita farmland in the region, the total compensation (land and\nresettlement subsidy) will be set between 185,000 and 225,000 yuan per ha for rice; 360,000\nand 540,000 yuan per ha for vegetable land; 150,000 and 170,000 yuan per ha for dryland;\n550,000 and 630,000 yuan per ha for fish pond; and 170,000 and 220,000 yuan per ha for\nsugarcane. People losing land temporarily for borrow sites will receive a payment equivalent to\nproduction value foregone, for the period of loss, expected to be 1-2 years. The land used\ntemporarily will be restored to the owner in the original condition, or funds will be provided to the\nowner to restore the land to its original condition. For structures lost, replacement value will be\nprovided to the affected households. Those losing housing will be provided with a free new\nhousing site serviced with road, electricity, and water within their own administrative village.\nThere will be no depreciation for housing and people will be allowed to salvage materials from\ntheir old houses.\nD.  Resettlement Strategy\n6. Efforts to minimize resettlement effects resulted from consultations with local officials\nduring the setting of the alignment during the initial feasibility study. The amount of rice land to\nbe acquired was kept to 15 percent of the total agricultural land lost, while the number of\nrelocated  households  was  kept  to  approximately  200.  For  those  unavoidably  affected,  the\nresettlement strategy will replace losses of housing, land, other assets, infrastructure, and\nincome.\n7. Over 95 percent of affected people are losing agricultural land. Most of these people will\nbe either reabsorbed back into agriculture, with the affected villages carrying out some village\nland adjustment to ensure that village members still have sufficient land to farm; or provided\nwith cash compensation to develop cash trees and nonfarm activities. The survey has identified\nvillage groups that are severely affected, through losing 25 percent of their land or more, and\nwill develop options for improving livelihoods on readjusted agricultural land. These options\ninclude, for example, the use of the cash compensation to enhance irrigation facilities and\nextend the area of higher producing rice land, and the purchase of more productive crop\nvarieties, for example, sugarcane and marketable tree products such as star anise. Expressway\ncontractors  will  be  requested  to  give  priority  to  resettlement-affected  households  in  the\nallocation of unskilled jobs during construction, through consultation with the township and\nvillage leaders.\n8. GCD will ensure that the resettlement entitlements are provided to the people affected\nbefore ground leveling and demolition commence. The land compensation and resettlement\nsubsidy will be paid to the villages affected. Housing compensation and compensation for young\ncrops and other assets will be provided directly to people losing those assets. Compensation for\ninfrastructure  such  as  electrical  and  communication  fixtures  will  be  paid  to  the  concerned\ndepartment.", "63\nAppendix 12, page 3\nE.  Institutional Arrangements\n9. The GZAR government will assume the responsibility for implementing the resettlement\naccording to the agreed resettlement plan. A project management unit (PMU) within GCD will\ncoordinate  the  planning,  implementation,  financing,  and  reporting  of  land  acquisition  and\nresettlement  for  the  expressway  and  connector  roads.  GCD  is  responsible  for  any  land\nacquisition and resettlement for the complementary roads. By early April 2001, leading groups\nfor resettlement, each comprising 20 staff, had been be established within the affected counties.\nThe  county  offices  will  take  the  primary  responsibility  for  the  resettlement  consultation,\nimplementation, and timely delivery of entitlements.\nF.  Vulnerable Groups\n10. Vulnerable households will be identified during final survey prior to implementation,\nincluding  those  below  the  poverty  line,  destitute  households,  and  households  headed  by\nwomen. Under the resettlement plan, such households will receive special attention in the\nrestoration  of  livelihood,  for  example,  through  preferential  unskilled  labor  opportunities,\nproviding they meet the other recruitment criteria. Those losing housing will also receive village\nassistance to construct a new house and are eligible for any ongoing welfare support, to which\nthey are already entitled from the village or the Civil Affairs Bureau.\nG.  Consultation and Grievance Redress\n11. The 1998 Land Law requires disclosure to and consultation with people affected. Some\nof the people affected have been notified about the key elements of the resettlement plan during\nmeetings and interviews. Further consultations will include meetings, arranged by township and\nvillage officials, on the specific impacts to be felt in each area and how they will be addressed.\nThe people losing housing will have be offered a choice of housing sites; and those losing\nagricultural land will have the opportunity to consider suitable income replacement alternatives.\n12. In early April 2001, an information booklet about the resettlement plan was distributed to\nall affected townships, and will be further distributed to the people affected through the peasant\neconomic collectives. The information booklet contains key information such as the resettlement\nscope; expected time frame; compensation rates for land and other assets; other assistance to\nreplace assets, housing, and incomes; and the grievance redress mechanisms. The county,\ntownship, and village officials will ensure that any concerns raised by the people affected are\naddressed.\n13. In case of grievance, people affected will submit their oral or written complaint first to the\nvillage committee or the township resettlement office. The village committee must write down\nany complaint presented orally. If a complaint is not settled in two weeks, the complainants can\nseek  redress  at  the  county  resettlement  office,  within  one  month.  If  the  matter  remains\nunresolved within two weeks, the PMU will try to achieve a solution. The final redress would be\nsought, if necessary, in the civil courts, in accordance with the Civil Procedures Act.\nH.  Monitoring and Reporting\n14. A monthly reporting system is being established in the PMU. The detailed plan for\ninternal and external monitoring and evaluation is currently being developed. GCD will engage a\nqualified independent social research agency, with experience in resettlement assessments, to", "64\nAppendix 12, page 4\nconduct independent resettlement monitoring and evaluation. The purpose of this is to assess\nthe extent to which the people affected have received their entitlements on time, as well as to\nascertain the extent to which the resettlement objectives of full restoration of incomes and living\nstandards have been achieved. The monitoring and evaluation method includes the conduct of\na baseline study before the end of June 2001, to be followed by periodic survey updates at the\nend of years 1 and 2 and again after project completion. The survey will be conducted through\nhousehold questionnaires, on a statistically valid sample of those affected. The survey will\ninclude a significant number of those severely affected by loss of land, as well as those losing\nhousing, and will allow identification of the effects on the poor and vulnerable.\n15. The PMU will report to ADB on progress in land acquisition and resettlement through\nquarterly progress reports, and will submit periodic reports from the independent monitoring and\nevaluation agency.\nI.  Finance and Implementation Schedule\n16.  The cost of the resettlement is estimated at Y321.7 million, equivalent to about $38.8\nmillion, for all costs including compensation, resettlement subsidy, payments for assets such as\nhousing,  fees,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Annual  adjustments  in  the  cost  estimates,\nincluding compensation rates, will be made based on the inflation rate for the previous year.\nGCD will supplement the resettlement budget if necessary to meet any shortfall to achieving the\nresettlement  objectives.  The  implementation  schedule  is  being  updated  for  the  revised\nresettlement plan based on the new construction timetable.", "65\nAppendix 13\nPUBLIC CONSULTATIONS\nNumber of\nAgency Date Participants Responses\nPeople\nXi\u2019an University June 1998 Farmers, 116 1.

The Project Influence Area\n 1. The project influence area (PIA) consists of the four counties crossed by the expressway\n(Chongzuo, Fusui, Ningming, and Pingxiang) and Longzhou, which is crossed by the class II\nroad linking the county town to the expressway. The expressway also crosses two townships in\nYongning County (Suxu and Wuxu) just outside Nanning City. These have been included\nwherever statistical data permits. The PIA is the appropriate area to examine the impacts of the\nProject as a whole. Clearly part of the population that will be impacted by the construction of the\nexpressway is not based in the identified areas. This part of the client population includes long\ndistance passengers and drivers who pass through the PIA or who only stay temporarily within\nthe  area.  It  also  includes  nonresident  freight,  bus,  and  goods  distribution  enterprises  that\narrange for the transportation of goods and people in, out, and through the PIA. Vietnamese\nfarmers and traders are also in this broad group.\nB.  Poverty Trends\n2. Poverty levels in the project area have decreased considerably in recent years as they\nhave done throughout the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Since 1985, changes in the\npoverty situation in the PIA have arisen as a result of three principal factors: (i) changes in\neconomic activity, (ii) improvements in infrastructure, and (iii) other initiatives.\n3. Changes in Economic Activity. The most important change in production in terms of\nimpact on the rural areas is almost certainly the increase in sugar cultivation. Production in 1998\nin the PIA was around 7 million tons, a 9-10 fold increase over production in 1985. The PIA now\nproduces  almost  17  percent  of  the  total  Guangxi  Zhuang  Autonomous  Region  (GZAR)\nproduction and 6 percent of total PRC production. Sugar refineries are the most important\nindustries of the PIA. The companies purchase all sugar products locally at a fixed price\ndetermined by the Government.1 Fruit production has also increased dramatically (the cultivated\narea has increased 10-fold) as has vegetable cultivation in areas with good access to the urban\nareas,  especially  Nanning  City.  Other  important  factors  have  been  the  rapid  increase  in\ncrossborder trade, urbanization in the county towns, and remittances from temporary migration\nto the large cities of the eastern PRC.\n4. Improvements to Infrastructure. In parallel with the increases in productive capacity,\nthere  have  been  major  improvements  to  infrastructure.  Water  supply  has  been  improved\nthrough  the  construction  of  reservoirs,  irrigation  and  wells,  extensive  road  improvements,\nexpansion of rural electrification to most villages, and construction and expansion of schools\nand health facilities.\n5. Other Initiatives. These include (i) promotion of temporary migration to the large cities\nof the eastern PRC, which has increased rural incomes through remittances; (ii) a program to\nresettle residents of the most inaccessible and least productive areas (e.g., Tiandeng and\nMashan) to more favorable locations; and (iii) considerable expansion of technical assistance\nand farmer\u2019s credit.\n                                     \n1  This might change with the PRC\u2019s entrance in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the influx of cheaper farm\nproducts from abroad. The PRC\u2019s Government commitment to the protection of the rural sector is one of the key\nunresolved issues regarding the PRC\u2019s entry in the WTO.", "67\nAppendix 14, page 2\n6. The  combination  of  favorable  economic  circumstances,  direct  investment  by  the\ngovernment, extensive technical advice and credit, and the willingness and ability of farmers to\ninnovate and join together for community projects, has resulted in a positive change in the\nsituation of the absolute poor of the PIA. Only 14 townships are now poor, compared with over\n30 in 1985. Table A14.1 indicates the current poverty levels in the PIA.2 The table shows that\nthe PIA has a poverty incidence of about 9 percent.\nTable A14.1: Poverty Incidence in the PIA\nArea Population Poverty Incidence Number of Poor\nWuxu 122,000 10.0% 12,200\nFusui 405,000 6.0% 24,300\nChongzuo 329,000 8.0% 26,320\nNingming 388,000 9.0% 34,920\nPingxiang 100,000 8.0% 8,000\nLongzhou 267,000 15.0% 40,050\nPIA 1,611,000 9.0% 144,990\nGZAR 47,609,000 6.3% 3,008,900\nGZAR = Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, PIA = project influence area.\nSource: Poverty Alleviation Office, Nanning Prefecture and Consultant\u2019s estimates.\n7. A high percentage of people have an average income just slightly above the Y1,000\nannual income level. Based on an income distribution analysis, approximately one third of the\nGZAR and PIA population earns an annual income between Y1,500 and Y2,000, and therefore\nis still vulnerable to shocks and economic fluctuations that could drag them into poverty.\nC.  Impact on Women and Ethnic Minorities\n1. Women\n8. The full participation of women in the economic and political life of rural areas implies\nthat, to a very great extent, project benefits will accrue to women as much as to men. This is\ncertainly true for benefits arising from improved access. Although women\u2019s role in construction\nworks is estimated at 15 percent of the overall labor employment, women will be given equal\nopportunities and pay for construction and operation work during project implementation, in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development.\n2. Minorities\n9. The PIA population is dominantly the Zhuang minority who are fully assimilated into the\nmainstream economy. Zhuang dominance in the PIA is more pronounced that in the province as\na whole; over 80 percent as against 61 percent. Consequently, project benefits will largely\naccrue to this group. In the PIA, although there are some Han villages, the majority of the Han\npeople tend to reside in the urban areas. The other minorities mostly live in hilly and peripheral\nareas in small natural villages. There is only one Yao dominated administrative village in the\nPIA, Fenglui, in the south of Ningming County. A large proportion of the small Yao population\nwill be affected by the construction of a new access road. The Yao population will benefit from\n                                     \n2  Based on an annual income level of Y1,000 per capita.", "68\nAppendix 14, page 3\nthe  new  access  through  increased  economic  activity  and  improved  social  and  physical\ninfrastructure and such access will not adversely affected their cultural identity.\nD.  Social and Poverty-Related Project Features\n10. Social and poverty considerations have been an integral part of the project design.\nThrough the complementary road program and the social and poverty measures, the Project will\nbenefit  local  people,  especially  the  poor,  by  addressing  their  needs  and  requests  and  by\nincreasing their economic opportunities.\n1. Complementary Road Program\n11. Throughout GZAR and the project area are numerous examples of how improvements to\nroad  access  have  led  to  increased  incomes  and  improvements  in  the  living  conditions  of\npreviously  poor  communities.  The  expressway  will  instigate  some  of  these  beneficial\nconsequences, particularly to villages near the interchanges. A complementary road program\ndirectly targeting the poorest areas of the PIA has been formulated to spread these benefits to\nthe remaining concentrations of poor households further away from the expressway corridor.\n12. Because  of  major  road  construction  efforts  in  recent  years,  the  great  majority  of\nadministrative  villages  are  now  accessible  by  road.  However  many  village  roads  are\nsubstandard  and  poorly  maintained,  show  signs  of  rapid  deterioration,  and  are  becoming\nimpassable  during  bad  weather.  The  complementary  road  program  has  been  explicitly\nformulated to improve access to poor and recently poor townships and villages in the PIA. As a\nresult  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  policy  dialogue  and  through  discussions  with\ngovernment officials and county officials and field surveys, road segments were prioritized to\nbenefit  the  poor  in  the  PIA.  The  proposed  program  (Appendix  7)  involves  improving  978\nkilometers  of  roads,  providing  all-weather  access  to  more  than  80  villages.  Nearly  all\nsettlements served are currently defined as poor or have only recently exceeded the official\npoverty line.\n2. Social and Poverty Measures\n13. During the preconstruction phase, three measures will be implemented. (i) A summary of\nthis social analysis in Chinese, together with other general information about the Project, will be\ncirculated to county governments and other relevant agencies to promote discussion and so that\nthey  can  develop  measures  to  maximize  the  potential  benefits  arising  from  the  NanYou\nExpressway. (ii) Entrepreneurs along the national highway (NH) 322 will be given information\ndescribing the construction schedule of the expressway and the likely impact on traffic flows\nalong  this  road  in  order  to  avoid  unsound  investment.  (iii)  Where  townships  will  be  near\ninterchanges, county and township officials, with the full participation of local entrepreneurs, will\ndevelop  land  use  plans  for  attractive  road  service  areas  just  off  the  expressway.  Where\nappropriate, these areas will include marketing points for local farmers to sell their produce to\noutside traders. Entrepreneurs on NH 322 will be given priority in the allocation of sites so\ndeveloped.\n14. During construction, three measures will be implemented. (i) Companies involved in civil\nworks for the expressway will maximize the employment of the poor, in particular for unskilled\nlabor. Teams of poor laborers will be recruited though the Poverty Alleviation and Development\nOffice and the All-China Women\u2019s Federation. The two agencies will identify appropriate team\nleaders  in  poor  natural  villages  in  the  project  area  and  train  them  on  their  rights  and", "69\nAppendix 14, page 4\nresponsibilities,  labor  law,  and  other  issues  as  deemed  necessary.  Team  leaders  will,  for\nexample, be responsible for keeping records of the names of people working in their teams,\ntheir salaries, and the working time. The team leaders will then select a labor team from poor\nhouseholds in their natural villages. (ii) The following clause, or a similar one, will be included in\nthe contracts agreed with all successful bidders: \u201cThe contractor will distribute to all employees\nand casually-employed laborers, and display, in prominent positions, advice concerning the\nnature, dangers, and transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (especially HIV/AIDS) and\ninformation concerning precautionary measures. This material will be obtained directly from the\nMinistry of Health or supplied by the contracting organization. Similar material concerning the\ndangers of drug use and the penalties associated with its possession and trafficking should be\ndistributed.\"  (iii)  Guangxi  Communications  Department  (GCD)  will  extend  procedures  for\ngrievance redress outlined in the resettlement plan (Appendix 12) to include any issues between\ncontractors and local residents relating to the construction of the scheme.\n15. Once  the  expressway  is  open,  the  expressway  corporation  will  specifically  invite\nbusinesses currently located along NH 322 to tender for service area concessions, which will\nform part of the expressway. The expressway corporation will employ as many residents from\nthe directly affected villages as possible. The expressway corporation will prominently display\nmaterial about HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases in rest rooms and service areas and\nconsideration will be given to selling condoms in the service areas. GCD will also assist county\ngovernments in carrying out road improvements and traffic routing measures where heavy\ngoods  traffic  from  the  expressway  has  a  detrimental  impact  on  existing  roads  and  the\nenvironment of frontage properties.\n3. Paid Labor\n16. Laborers working on the project roads will receive a salary based on market rates. The\nshare of labor budget will be reflected in semiannual progress report for each road segment and\nmonitored during project implementation.\nE.  Poverty Impact Assessment\n17. The following analysis focuses on the level of impact of the project roads on the lives of\nthe poor. Since it is difficult to quantify benefits of village and county roads, a qualitative\nassessment of the significance of the benefits was undertaken. The analysis concludes that\nabout 135,000 of the 1,050,000 people directly affected by the Project are poor and that the\nproposed  complementary  road  program  significantly  contributes  to  the  Project\u2019s  poverty\nreduction impact. To define the nature and extent of these potential benefits to the poor in the\nPIA, the assessment will focus on:\n(i)  identifying the number of poor who will directly benefit from the Project;\n(ii)  identifying the benefits likely to accrue from the Project;\n(iii)  distributing these benefits to the poor population; and\n(iv)  quantifying the benefits (where possible).\n1. Direct and Indirect Beneficiaries\n18. Based on income distribution analysis, surveys, and review of official data, the poor\npopulation within the PIA is estimated to include 145,000 people (about 9 percent of the total\nPIA population). While it is realistic to assume that, over time, some project benefits, however\nsmall and however indirect, will accrue to the majority of the poor population of the PIA, it is", "70\nAppendix 14, page 5\nessential to identify groups who are likely to benefit more directly from the project roads. The\nfour such groups are (i) residents in villages that will be served by the complementary road\nprogram, (ii) residents in villages adjacent to the NanYou expressway, (iii) residents adjacent to\nNH  322,  and  (iv)  the  urban  poor.  Table  A14.2  provides  estimates  of  the  total  and  poor\npopulation in each of these groups. Total populations are based on estimates done during the\nanalysis and the percentage of poor population derived from poverty proportions estimated by\ngenerating income distribution using average income for each category. Double counting has\nbeen eliminated where possible.\nTable A14.2: Direct Project Beneficiaries\nItem Total Population Poverty Incidence Number of Poor\nVillage Residents a 420,000 22.0% 92,400\nNanYou Expressway residents b 60,000 10.0% 6,000\nNH 322 Residents 280,000 8.0% 22,400\nUrban 290,000 5.0% 14,500\nDirect Project Beneficiaries 1,050,000 12.9% 135,300\nNH = national highway.\na Benefiting from complementary road program.\nb Excludes section west of Ningming where NanYou expressway parallels NH 322 and excluding residents benefiting\nfrom village road improvements.\nSource: Project Preparatory Technical Assistance.\n19. The data show that approximately 135,000 poor people will directly and immediately\nbenefit from the Project, accounting for about 13 percent of the total population directly affected\nby the Project. The data also shows the importance of the complementary road program in\nterms of overall impact of the project. The complementary road program will generate benefits\nas soon as individual schemes are completed, whereas benefits from the NanYou expressway\nwill only accrue after 2005 when the road is opened.\n2. Identification of Benefits\n20. Potential  benefits  are  divided  into  income  and  nonincome  components.  The  former\ncorresponds to higher incomes flows while the latter includes improved living conditions, access\nto social and community services, and greater interaction with the outside world.\n21. Income component. The income impacts of village and county road improvements can\nfurther be divided into direct and indirect benefits. The direct income benefits are (i) enabling\nfarmers  to  capture  an  increasing  proportion  of  the  value  added  by  reducing  the  costs  of\nmarketing;  (ii)  reduced  vehicle  operating  costs  (VOCs)  for  owners  of  tractors  and  other\nmotorized vehicles; (iii) higher agricultural productivity through a reduction in the transport cost\nof fertilizers and other inputs; (iv) farmers switching to higher value crops given their improved\naccess  to  markets  for  cash  crops;3  (v)  development  of  nonagricultural  economic  activity,\nespecially transportation; (vi) direct employment opportunities through construction labor; and\n(vii) purchase of local construction materials. Indirect income benefits are less tangible. These\nessentially involve multiplier and trickle-down effects arising from the Project as a whole. The\nmost  important  of  indirect  income  benefits  arise  from  increased  urbanization.  The  rapid\n                                     \n3  Either marketed directly or by reducing the transport costs of visiting traders.", "71\nAppendix 14, page 6\nexpansion of the towns has increased job opportunities for urban residents and migrant rural\nlabor.\n22. Nonincome component. Nonincome impacts of road improvement essentially consist\nof the following. (i) Access to health, schools, and other community facilities will facilitate (a)\nattracting resident teachers and health personnel to villages, and visits by specialists; and (b)\nvisiting by more remote people to the villages and such facilities. (ii) Improved access to villages\nfor  technical  personnel  and  local  officials  will  facilitate  agricultural  extension  and  visits  to\nimprove communications of government projects and address grievances. (iii) Time and effort\ninvolved in routine tasks will be reduced, especially for travelling to the local market. (iv) Overall\ninteractions between villages and the outside world will increase. (v) The safety, environment,\nand ease of transportation along NH 322 will improve. The NanYou Expressway will lead to a\nmarked reduction of traffic along NH 322. Almost all through traffic will be removed, which will\nreduce  the  risk  of  accidents,  and  make  it  safer,  easier,  and  faster  for  local  traffic  and\npedestrians using NH 322.\n3. Distribution of Benefits\n23. Table A14.3 provides a simplified allocation of the principal benefits to each group.

Villages with poor access have an income 8\npercent lower than those with good access.", "72\nAppendix 14, page 7\nTable A14.4: Incomes of Villages\nwith Better and Worse Road Access\nAdministrative No. Average Income Average Vehicle\nVillages Income (Y) Ratiosa Ownership\n(per 100 households)\nPoor Access 114 1,854 0.95 15\nGood Access 119 1,957 1.04 23\nTotal/Ratiosb 233 0.95 0.92 0.67\na \nIncome of village relative to township average.

Economic  benefits  arising  from  increased  land  cultivation  and  other  nonagricultural\nactivities, which will derive from improved accessibility, can be assumed to be equivalent to an\nincrease by 8 percent of incomes in the area. This is equivalent to Y27 million per annum.\n26. Employment.  During  construction,  the  Project  will  generate  direct  and  indirect\nemployment. Employment opportunities will be generated by the construction of 507 km of\ncomplementary road works, and a large share of unskilled jobs will be given to those below the\npoverty line living in the PIA. The construction of class II, III, and IV roads will require and\nestimated 9,000 person-years of unskilled labor. This is estimated to provide about 4,500\nperson-years of employment for unskilled poor laborers. Total additional income for these poor\nlaborers  is  estimated  to  be  around  Y30  million,  which  will  be  assured  by  the  covenant\nrequesting the payment of market-level wages for all laborers on the project roads.\n27. VOC Savings. As the use of the complementary road network is not charged, economic\nbenefits will be passed on in full. All village residents will benefit.\nb. Expressway and Connector Roads\n28. Employment. The construction of the expressway and connector roads will require\nabout 25,000 person-years of unskilled labor and 15,000 person-years of skilled labor. A large\nshare of the unskilled jobs will be given to those living below the poverty line (about 13,000\nperson-years). Total additional income for these poor unskilled laborers is estimated around\nY100  million  during  the  construction  phase.  For  the  operation  of  the  expressway,  new\nemployees will be recruited from within the PIA. Those below the poverty line will acquire at\nleast half of the permanent operational positions required.\n29. VOC Savings. Economic benefits (lower transport costs, accidents, etc.) will greatly\naffect consumers. Since the transport markets appear to be fairly competitive, most welfare gain\nwill be absorbed by consumers rather than vehicle owners. Principal beneficiaries among the\npoor will be bus passengers who are village residents. Also, some of the poor, both village and\nurban residents, will benefit from lower costs of transport by light and medium goods vehicles.\n30. Construction Materials. Some local financial gain to owners of quarry sites and service\noutlets is expected. However the effect of such benefits on poor people is likely to be minor.", "73\nAppendix 15, page 1\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS\n1. The proposed expressway has four principal rationales: (i) to link the National Trunk\nHighway System of the People's Republic of China to National Highway 1, Viet Nam\u2019s north-\nsouth artery; (ii) to reduce congestion on the existing NH 322, which is currently congested and\nflows exceed design capacities in several locations\u2014expected economic growth and projected\nincome elasticity will deter some travel by 2005, and more thereafter; (iii) to provide a better\nalignment that will (a) reduce the distance from Nanning to Youyiguan by 45 km, leading to\nexpected time savings in 2005 of 3.25 hours for goods and passenger vehicles; and (b) move\nthe alignment closer to the principal centers of population in the corridor; and (iv) to foster\ncrossborder trade by reducing transport costs.\n2. The  complementary  road  program  will  support  poverty  reduction.  The  program  will\nprovide basic all-weather access to villages; upgrade deteriorated village roads; and improve\naccess  to  townships,  administrative  villages,  and  other  villages  directly  affected  by  the\nexpressway. It will facilitate effective distribution of expressway benefits. Although the program\nwill  reduce  transport  costs,  its  wider  role  is  that  of  fulfilling  an  essential  precondition  for\nimproved access to social and health services.\nA.  Valuation of Costs and Benefits\n1.  Basis for Evaluation\n3. The  basis  for  evaluation  of  the  expressway  and  Class  I/II  connecting  roads  is  a\ncomparison  of  the  Project  with  a  base  case.  The  base  case  incorporates  minimum\nimprovements to the existing highway and planned improvements to the remainder of the\nnetwork. In a situation where demand for transport is growing fast, this will lead to some\njourneys being diverted to other roads and some being suppressed. In the \"with Project\" case\nthere will be little or no trip suppression. The difference between the two equilibrium levels of\ntraffic is treated as generated traffic.\n4. Quantified evaluation of the complementary road program is based on a comparison of\nvehicle operating costs (VOCs) with and without the proposed improvements. Network effects\nare not taken into account. Other unquantifiable benefits of the program will be (i) increased\nproduction due to better access to markets and agricultural officers, (ii) increased trading and\ntransport opportunities, (iii) improved access to school and health facilities, and (iv) increased\naccess to other information.\n5. The evaluation period is 20 years following the expected opening early in 2005. The\nbase case construction period is 40 months, from the end of 2001 to early 2005.\n2.  Costs\n6. Economic costs are at mid-2000 prices and are expressed in domestic currency. For\ntradeable items an exchange rate of $1=Y8.28 and a shadow exchange factor of 1.08 was\nused. In general, equipment was tax exempt and the overall conversion factor was 0.967; a\nlower conversion factor of 0.9 was used for local road construction and maintenance costs.", "74\nAppendix 15, page 2\n3.  Benefits\n7. The main economic benefits generated by the Project are VOC savings, reduced travel\ntime, and accident cost savings for normal traffic. Half of the VOC benefits accrued to the\ngenerated traffic are included as a proxy for willingness to pay. Other benefits included working\ncapital savings to freight in transit and resource cost savings arising from diversion from rail to\nroad.\n8.  VOC savings were calculated for five vehicle types, taking into account the differences\nof terrain, road roughness, speed, and congestion. The economic costs of vehicles included in\nthe VOC savings are derived from international prices with a quality adjustment for domestically\nproduced vehicles. Parts, fuel, and oil were also calculated based on the current international\nprices.  The  benefits  from  VOC  savings,  which  will  initially  accrue  to  vehicle  owners  and\noperators, will in the long term be passed on to users of transport services through reductions in\ntransport  rates  and  fares,  given  the  increasingly  competitive  nature  of  the  road  transport\nindustry in the project area.\n9. Travel time saving will be enjoyed by the traffic on the project expressway and the\nexisting roads. Saved travel time is valued using 70 percent of average after-tax salary for work-\nrelated trips only. Only 25 percent of bus passengers were assumed to be on work-related trips.\nNo value was assigned to leisure trips.\n10. The  benefits  from  a  reduction  in  number  and  severity  of  accidents  constitute  an\nimportant element of economic benefits. Accident reductions were estimated based on the\nfindings of a study on accidents carried out by the Highway Planning and Design Institute of the\nMinistry of Communications. The cost of property damage (Table A15.1) is high. Although the\neconomic cost of accidents is higher on the expressway than on the existing roads, with the\nProject, the number of accidents per vehicle-kilometer in the project corridor will be reduced\nsubstantially. Therefore, net cost saving will derive from avoided accident costs.\n11. Working capital savings to freight in transit were estimated conservatively, taking only\nthe actual time saved, rather than assuming that (for example) a proportion of overnight stays\ncan be eliminated. The resource savings from diversion from rail to road are difficult to estimate\nbut are considered to be small. Most rail freight is commodities in bulk; the scope for diversion\nand resource cost savings is negligible. Substantial diversion of passenger traffic is expected.\nHowever, the railway runs at well below capacity and marginal costs must be low. Resource\ncost savings using a historic rail conversion factor and derived bus VOCs were therefore\nreduced before inclusion in the evaluation.\nB.  Results and Conclusion\n12. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project is 20.0 percent (Table A15.4).\nThe EIRR for the complementary road program alone is 22.7 percent. VOC savings are the\nmajor economic benefit, accounting for 76 percent, followed by generated traffic (11 percent),\ntravel time savings (6 percent), local road component (4 percent), and accident cost savings (3\npercent).\n13. The sensitivity of the EIRR to changes in significant and uncertain variables is shown in\nTable A15.2. Switching values are identified. The project EIRR is highly robust in the face of\nadverse cost and benefit estimates. To reduce the EIRR to 12 percent would take:", "75\nAppendix 15, page 3\n(i)  an increase in costs to about double the base case, or\n(ii)  a drop in benefits to 0.44 times the base case.\n14. Tolls affect the volume of traffic on the expressway. Economic benefits are maximized\nwith no toll, as this allows the maximum number of vehicles to take advantage of the superior\ntravel conditions on the expressway. As expressway tolls increase, more drivers and operators\nwill opt to use other routes. This effect has been tested, and the results are shown in Table\nA15.3. Below the base toll level, EIRRs are relatively insensitive to further changes in price (toll)\nlevel, i.e., demand for expressway travel is relatively inelastic. Above the base toll, elasticity\nincreases, demand is ultimately choked off, and the EIRR falls sharply.\nTable A15.1: Accident Rates and Costs in PRC\nRoad Class Average Value of Direct Number of Accidents per\nProperty Damage per 100 Million Vehicle-\nAccident (Yuan) Kilometers\nExpressway 14,000 20-50\nMotorway Class I 10,000 55-70\nMotorway Class II 7,750 105-120\nHighway Class II 6,500 150-160\nHighway Class III 4,500 More than 160\nSource: The Highway Planning and Design Institute of the Ministry of Communication.\nTable A15.2:  Economic Evaluation: Sensitivity Tests\nProject case EIRR NPV\n(percent) (Y billion)\nBest estimate 20.0 2.61\nEIRR with:\n(i)  10 percent increase in all project costs 18.8 2.37\n(ii)  20 percent decrease in all project benefits 17.4 1.67\n(iii)  20 percent decrease in the value of travel\ntime savings 19.8 2.55\n(iv)  expressway construction over 4\u00bd rather than 18.6 2.32\n3\u00bd years\n(v)  20 percent drop in income elasticity of 18.8 2.40\ntransport demand\n(vi)  combination of (i), (ii) and (iv) 15.1 1.36\nSwitching valuesa\n(i)  Increase in all costs base x 2.08\n(ii)  Decrease in all benefits base x 0.44\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value.\na Factor that will reduce the project EIRR to 12 percent.\nSource: Staff estimates.\nTable A15.3: Effect of Tolls on Expressway EIRR\nFactor x base toll\nEIRR\n0.5 0.75 1 1.5 2\nPercent 20.4 20.2 20.0 19.0 17.9", "Table A15.4: Economic Internal Rate of Return\nAnnual Costs (million yuan) Annual Benefits (million yuan)\nWithout  Vehicle  Benefits of \nFreight \nProject  Operating   Value of  Accident  Gen.

General\n1. The proforma financial statements including income statement, cash flows, and balance\nsheet for the project expressway are based on the following assumptions and were prepared for\n25 years from 2000 to 2025. All projections are in current terms. The domestic inflation rates\nused are 1.8 percent for 2000, 2.0 percent for 2001 and 3.0 percent for 2002 onward. The\ninternational inflation rate used is 2.4 percent throughout the projection period.\nB.  Financial Statements\n2.  The project expressway financial projections are based upon the following assumptions:\n(i)  Corporate income tax1 is assessed against the expressway operating entity at 33\npercent of net profit per year.\n(ii)  Government  grants  consist  of  equity  capital  contributed  by  Ministry  of\nCommunications and Guangxi Communications Department (GCD).\n(iii)  The grants from Ministry of Communications and GCD will be Y836 million and\nY777  million,  respectively  and  will  be  invested  during  the  first  five  years  of\nconstruction to cover initial deficits.\n(iv)  The toll rates expected to be levied to the project expressway are in 2000 prices\nand  based  upon  the  traffic  forecast  estimated  by  GCD  for  various  types  of\nvehicles (Table A16.1). Traffic volumes were forecast to increase by 7.3 percent\nper year during 2005-2015 and 6.8 percent per year during 2016-2025.\nTable A16.1: Projected Toll Rates\n(Yuan per vehicle km)\nRoad Type\nVehicle Type Expressway Class I\nSmall Passenger 0.30 0.25\nLarge Passenger/Medium Truck 1.00 0.85\nLarge Truck 1.85 1.60\nTruck with Trailer 2.60 2.40\nSource: The Price Control Bureau of the Guangxi Planning Committee.\n(v)  The  operating  and  maintenance  costs,  including  routine  maintenance  and\nenvironmental monitoring, are Y10 million per year in mid-2000 prices. Routine\nmaintenance cost will amount to Y8.1 million per year. The operating costs are\nbased on a staff of 127 people employed at toll stations, in the maintenance\nteams, and at the administrative offices. Annual salaries and benefits amount to\nan average of Y10,500 per employee. Operating costs will increase in line with\ntraffic growth and domestic inflation. Maintenance costs will increase in line with\ndomestic inflation.\n                  \n1 Business Tax was abolished, effective 1 January 2001.", "78\nAppendix 16, page 2\n(vi)  The bank loans repayments will begin in 2006. The interest rate charged on the\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) loan was estimated at 4.51 percent, based on\nthe six-month LIBOR in US dollars in June 2001, and the interest rate on the\ndomestic loan is 6.21 percent. The commitment fee of 0.75 percent per year and\nthe 1.0 percent front-end fee for the ADB loan are also included.\nC.  Summary of Financial Statements\n3.  The projected financial statements in Tables A16.2 to A16.4 indicate that the expected\nrevenues at the rates proposed are sufficient to cover the operating costs and debt repayments\non the ADB and domestic loans. The debt-to-equity ratio of much less than 65:35 from the first\nyear of the expressway construction and the decreasing of the debt-to-equity ratios thereafter\nindicates a sound financial condition for the expressway under the proposed financing plan. The\nreturn on equity will be positive from the beginning of operations. This ratio indicates that\nGuangxi Expressway Management Company, which will be created to operate the expressway,\ncan sustain a totally commercial operation from year 2005, if GCD decides to privatize the\nexpressway operation in the future.", "Table A16.2:  Income Statement for Nanning-YouYiGuan Expressway\n(current Y million)\n         Million Yuan in Calendar Year (current prices)\nItem 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2015 2020 2025\nProportion of Full Year's Revenue  0.8 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0\n1.

The financial rate of return (FIRR) for the Project expressway is based on estimated\nincremental revenues and costs resulting from its operation. The major assumptions used in\ncalculating the FIRR are as follows:\n(i)  The FIRR calculation is in constant 2000 prices. The cash flows and financing\nplans are in real prices. They cover a period of 24 years, comprising 4 years of\nconstruction (2001 to 2005) and 20 years of operation (2006 to 2025).\n(ii)  The FIRR was calculated after corporate income tax.\n(iii)  Capital  costs  include  all  incremental  capital  expenditures  related  to  the\nconstruction  and  equipment  of  the  project  expressway,  but  exclude  price\ncontingency provisions and interest during construction.\n(iv) Operation and maintenance costs include all incremental costs for operating the\nproject expressway, but exclude depreciation provisions.\n(v) Operating revenues were projected based on forecast traffic for the toll rates for\nall vehicle types in real terms. The toll rates were applied to the whole project\nexpressway in real terms during the period of analysis. The traffic volumes have\ntaken  into  account  vehicles  that  are  exempt  from  tolls,  such  as  military,\nemergency, and public security vehicles.\n2.  The results of the financial evaluation for the project expressway including the cost of\ncomplementary roads show an FIRR in real terms of 9.0 percent after corporate income tax\n(Table A17.1). This is higher than the real after tax weighted average cost of capital for the\nProject estimated at 3.1 percent. Sensitivity analysis of the financial return was carried out to\ntest the effects of several scenarios on key parameters that determine costs and revenues\n(Table A17.2). The FIRR after tax varies between 4.8 and 11.1 percent, which is always above\nthe after tax weighted average cost of capital. The Project is shown to be most sensible to the\ntoll revenue stream and capital costs and the delay in completion. An increase of 20 percent in\ncapital costs will decrease the FIRR to 7.5 percent and a decrease of 20 percent in revenues\nwill decrease the FIRR to 6.5 percent, and a one-year delay in construction will decrease the\nFIRR to 8.3 percent. Under the most adverse scenario (one-year delay; capital, operation, and\nmaintenance costs higher by 20 percent; and revenues lower by 20 percent) the FIRR would\ndecrease to 4.8 percent. A devaluation of the yuan by 30 percent would reduce the FIRR to 8.1\npercent. The financial evaluation without complementary roads shows an FIRR of 9.7 percent in\nreal terms.", " 83\nAppendix 17, page 2\nTable A17.1 Financial Internal Rate of Return\n(Yuan million)\nYear Capital  Operating  Gross        Net Cash  Corporate  Net Cash \nInvestment and  Revenue Flow Income Tax Flow After \nMaintenance  Corporate \nCosts Income Tax\n2001            299.7           -             -      (299.7)       ( 299.7)\n2002            931.7           -             -      (931.7)       ( 931.7)\n2003            919.5           -             -      (919.5)       ( 919.5)\n2004            928.1           -             -      (928.1)       ( 928.1)\n2005            191.6            7.3         214.6         1 5.6           15.6\n2006               -           10.1         298.0        287.9 8.9         279.0\n2007               -           10.4         310.4        300.0 15.6         284.4\n2008               -           10.6         323.3        312.7 22.4         290.3\n2009               -           10.9         336.8        325.9 29.3         296.6\n2010               -           11.2         406.6        395.5 54.7         340.8\n2011               -           11.5         423.5        412.1 63.0         349.1\n2012               -           11.8         441.2        429.4 71.2         358.2\n2013               -           12.1         459.5        447.5 79.5         368.0\n2014               -           12.4         478.6        466.3 88.0         378.3\n2015              87.8          12.7         584.4        483.9 153.8        3 30.1\n2016               -           13.0         606.0        593.0 163.6        4 29.4\n2017               -           13.3         628.5        615.1 172.6        4 42.5\n2018               -           13.7         651.7        638.0 181.9        4 56.1\n2019               -           14.0         675.8        661.8 191.4        4 70.4\n2020               -           14.4         812.5        798.1 238.0        5 60.1\n2021               -           14.7         842.6        827.8 250.2        5 77.6\n2022               -           15.1         873.8        858.7 261.7        5 97.0\n2023               -           15.5         905.6        890.1 273.5        6 16.6\n2024               -           15.9         939.7        923.7 285.7        6 38.0\n2025       ( 1,308.2)         1 6.3      1,128.2    2 ,420.1 349.2      2,070.9\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return after Corporate Income Tax: 9.0%\nSource: Staff estimates.", " 84\nAppendix 17, page 3\nTable A17.2: Sensitivity Analysis\nCase FIRR\nBase Case 9.0%\nChanges in Capital Costs\nPlus 20% 7.5%\nPlus 10% 8.2%\nMinus 10% 10.0%\nMinus 20% 11.1%\nChanges in Revenues\nMinus 20% 6.5%\nMinus 10% 7.8%\nChanges in Operating and Maintenance Costs\nPlus 10% 9.0%\nPlus 20% 9.0%\nProject Delayed by 1 Year 8.3%\nCombined Changes\nCapital Costs plus 20%, Revenues minus 20% 5.2%\nCapital Costs plus 10%, Revenues minus 10% 7.1%\nProject delayed 1 Year, Capital Costs plus 10%\n10% and Revenues minus 10%, and O&M plus 10% 6.5%\nProject delayed 1 Year, Capital Costs plus\n20% and Revenues minus 20%, and O&M plus 20% 4.8%\nCurrency Devaluation by 30% 8.1%\nFIRR=financial internal rate of return, O&M=operating and maintenance.\nSource: Staff estimates."], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20011009173007", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Author": "rsa", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R171-01", "ModDate": "D:20011030161315+08'00'"}}
