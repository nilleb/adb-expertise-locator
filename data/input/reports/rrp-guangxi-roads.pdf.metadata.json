The  Project\nincludes (i) constructing an expressway and highway across\nflat to hilly terrain with connector roads to county towns; (ii)\nimproving  local  roads  servicing  poor  villages  of  the  project\narea;  and  (iii)  providing  consulting  services  and  training  to\nenhance  construction  quality,  road  safety,  and  project\nmonitoring  and  evaluation.  The  project  expressway  will\nsupport  the  Government\u2019s  Great  Western  Development\nStrategy  by  building  an  important  link  of  the  national  trunk\nhighway  system  (NTHS)  in  GZAR  and  enhance  cross-\nborder trade with Viet Nam.\n\nCategory A\nAn  environmental \n(EIA)  was\nundertaken,  and  the  summary  EIA  was  circulated  to  the\nBoard  of  Directors  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\non 2 May 2001.\n\nimpact  assessment \n\nADB's  country  operational  strategy  for  the  PRC  supports\nthe  Government's  policies  in  the  road  sector,  which  focus\non  building  roads  that  will  promote  economic  and  social\ndevelopment  particularly  in  the  poor  areas  of  the  country.\nGZAR is the fourth poorest of the PRC's 31 provinces. The\nproject  road  is  an  important  NTHS  connector  route  in\nGZAR,  improving  the  access  of  the  cities  in  the  project\narea  to  Nanning,  the  capital  of  GZAR,  and  the  southern\nseaports,  and  building  an  important  link  to  the  Viet  Nam\nborder. As a result of ADB\u2019s policy dialogue, the scope of\nthe  Project  has  been  expanded \nits\ndevelopment \nimpact  by  adding  a  program  of\ntargeting  poor\nroad  upgrading,  and \ncomplementary \ncommunities  in  the  project  area.  The  Project  will  also\nfacilitate \nimproving  access\nbetween  PRC,  Viet  Nam,  and  other  countries  of  the\nGreater Mekong Subregion.\n\nregional  cooperation  by \n\nto  strengthen \n\nThe  Project  will  promote  sustainable  economic  growth,\nand,  thus,  contribute  to  poverty  reduction,  by  improving\neconomic efficiency and reducing the cost of road transport\nin  the  southwestern  region  of  GZAR.  The  Project  will\nrelieve traffic congestion and bottlenecks on a key section\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n\fiii\n\nof the NTHS, and provide better access to growth centers\nfor  poor  communities.  Specifically,  the  Project  will  (i)\nprovide  additional  transport  capacity,  alleviate  congestion\nand  reduce  traffic  accidents  and  vehicle  operating  costs;\n(ii)  improve  access  for  the  poor  rural  population  in  the\ntransport corridor; and (iii) facilitate regional cooperation by\nproviding  better  access  between  the  PRC  and  Viet  Nam.\nThe Project will also support sector reforms initiated under\nprevious  and  ongoing  ADB-financed  projects  and  regional\ninitiatives.  The  project  scope  includes  (i)  construction  of\n136  km  of  four-lane  access-controlled  tollway  between\nNanning  (Wuxu)  and  Ninming  and  a  further  43  km  of\nincluding\nhighway  between  Ninming  and  Youyiguan, \ninterchanges  with  toll  stations,  connecting  roads,  tunnels,\nbridges,  administrative  stations,  service  areas,  and  49  km\nof  connecting  roads;  (ii)  improvement  of  about  507  km  of\nlocal  roads  servicing  poor  areas;  (iii)  procurement  of\nequipment for maintenance, toll collection, surveillance and\ncommunications, vehicle axle load testing, and road safety;\n(iv)  land  acquisition  and  resettlement;  and  (v)  consulting\nservices and capacity building.\n\n4.

The  proposed  road  project  will  connect  Nanning,  capital  of  the  Guanxi  Zhuang\nAutonomous Zone (GZAR), and Youyiguan, at the Viet Nam border. The main road project and\nthe  associated  complementary  road  program  will  provide  improved  access  between  poverty\nareas  and  market  centers,  and  support  the  economic  and  social  development  of  the\nsouthwestern part of GZAR, which is one of the PRC\u2019s poorest provinces. The project road is\npart  of  the  national  trunk  highway  system  (NTHS)  connecting  to  National  Route  No.1  in  Viet\nNam, and will thus facilitate regional cooperation.\n\n3.\nDuring ADB's 2000 Country Programming Mission, the Government confirmed its request\nfor assistance for the Project. A feasibility study was prepared by the Guangxi Communications\nPlanning,  Survey,  and  Design  Institute.  An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  and  a\nresettlement  plan  were  undertaken  by  the  Xi\u2019an  Highway  University.  ADB  provided  technical\nassistance  (TA)1  to  supplement  the  Government  studies.  Fact-finding  for  the  Project  was\nundertaken from 8 to 21 February 2001, and appraisal from 17 to 30 April 2001.2 The Project has\nbeen  formulated  based  on  the  findings  of  the  ADB  missions,  information  provided  by  the\nfunding  agencies,  and\nGovernment,  beneficiary  consultations,  discussions  with  other \nrecommendations of the feasibility study and TA consultants. The logical framework that outlines\nthe  goal,  purpose,  outputs,  and  inputs  or  activities  is  in  Appendix  1.  A  proposal  for  poverty\nreduction  in  southern  Guangxi  was  prepared  by  the  Government  for  financing  under  the  Japan\nFund for Poverty Reduction.\n\n III. \n\nBACKGROUND3\n\n4.\nInvestment  in  transport  infrastructure,  and  especially  roads,  together  with  capital\ninvestments,  provides  a  key  boost  to  local,  regional,  and  national  economies.  These\ninvestments  stimulate  economic  growth,  which  generates  higher  standards  of  living  over  the\nlong term. Many of the PRC's rural poor reside in partial or full isolation, which makes transport\ncostly for them and therefore restricts their ability to access basic goods and services. Lack of\naccess  deprives  the  poor  of  their  ability  to  take  advantage  of  job  opportunities.  Investment  in\nroad  projects  is  a  catalyst  to  reduce  poverty  for  access  improvements  have  a  strong  income\neffect.\n\n                  \n\n1 TA 3220-PRC: Guangxi Highway Development Project, for $540,000, approved on 12 July 1999.\n2  The appraisal mission comprised P. Giraud, Sr. Transport Specialist/Mission Leader; F. Agnello, Poverty Reduction\nSpecialist;  E.  Brotoisworo,  Sr.  Environment  Specialist;  I.  Choi,  Sr.  Financial  Analyst;  P.  Poinsignon,  Transport\nSpecialist; S. Price, Sr. Social Development Specialist; D. Sobel (Sr. Programs Officer); and Y. Zhu, Resettlement\nConsultant.\n\n3  This section of the report is similar to the equivalent section in the Shaanxi Roads Development Project, which was\n\nalso formulated for Board consideration in 2001.\n\n\f2\n\nA. \n\nSector Description\n\n1. \n\nTransport\n\na.\n\nInfrastructure and Traffic\n\n5.\nImplementation of the Government's economic reform policies since 1978 has resulted in\nrapid  growth  of  the  PRC  economy,  and  a  corresponding  increase  in  the  demand  for  transport\nservices.  Despite  the  Government's  efforts  to  increase  the  country's  transport  capacity,  serious\nconstraints and bottlenecks remain, especially in the road subsector. By the end of 2000, the PRC\ntransport system comprised about 68,000 kilometers (km) of railways, 1.4 million km of highways,\n119,300 km of inland waterways, and 1.5 million km of civil aviation routes. However, the density\nof the transport network in the PRC ranks among the lowest in the world relative to population or\ngeographic  area.    In  terms  of  density  per  square  kilometer  of  land  area,  the  PRC's  transport\nnetwork is one sixth of India's network and one fifth of that of the Republic of Korea.\n\nBetween  1990  and  2000,  when  economic  growth  averaged  10.2  percent  per  annum,\n6.\ndomestic  passenger  transport  in  all  modes  grew  by  8.0  percent  per  annum  in  passenger-km.\nFreight transport in all modes grew at 5.2 percent per year in ton-km. Road traffic increased its\nshare  of  traffic  and  grew  at  9.7  percent  per  annum  for  passenger  traffic  and  5.9  percent  per\nannum  for  freight.  In  2000,  road  traffic  accounted  for  54.2  percent  of  total  passenger-km,\nfollowed  by  railways  with  36.8  percent,  civil  aviation  with  8.2  percent,  and  coastal  and  inland\nwaterways  with  0.8  percent.  The  modal  split  for  freight  ton-km  was  coastal  and  inland\nwaterways,  52.8  percent;  railways,  31.2  percent;  roads,  13.7  percent;  pipelines,  2.2  percent;\nand civil aviation, 0.1 percent. Since 1990, the railway share of freight traffic has declined by 9.3\npercentage points, while the road share has increased by 0.9 percentage points and the inland\nwaterways by 8.6 percentage points. The reduced share of the railway and the increased share\nof road transport are consistent with trends in other countries, where, as incomes increase, the\nshare of power, roads, and telecommunications in infrastructure expenditures rises, and that of\nwater, irrigation, and railways falls.4 Increase in transport demand will be concentrated around\nand between major cities and in transport corridors serving the ports and their hinterlands. An\nincreasing share of the movement of goods and passengers will be by road, as road transport is\nmore flexible and responsive than other modes to needs in a market economy. In addition, car\nownership is growing, and an increasing proportion of passengers will travel by road.\n\nAt the end of 2000 GZAR had about 3,120 km of railways, 52,910 km of highways, and\n7.\n5,620 km of navigable inland waterways. From 1990 to 2000, domestic passenger transport in\nall modes grew by 10.3 percent per annum in passenger-km and freight transport grew at 6.1\npercent per annum in ton-km. Road traffic increased its share of traffic and grew at 13.1 percent\nper  annum  for  passenger  traffic  and  6.0  percent  per  annum  for  freight.  In  2000,  road  traffic\naccounted  for  74.9  percent  of  total  passenger-km,  followed  by  railways  with  24.6  percent  and\ncoastal and inland waterways with 0.5 percent. The modal split for freight ton-km was railways\n62.9 percent, roads 27.2 percent and inland waterways 9.9 percent. Since 1990, the railway and\nroad shares of freight traffic have stayed about the same, while the railway share of passenger\ntraffic  has  declined  by  13.6  percentage  points,  and  the  road  share  has  increased  by  17.0\npercentage points (Appendix 2).\n\n                  \n\n4 Ingram, Gregory, and Marianne Fay. 1994. Valuing Infrastructure Stocks and Gains from Improved Performance.\n\nBackground paper for the World Development Report 1994. Washington: World Bank.\n\n\f3\n\nb.\n\nInvestments\n\n8.\nPublic transport investment was about 2.3 percent of the gross national product in 2000. A\nWorld Bank study5 indicated that total transport investment should increase to at least 3.6 percent\nof  the  gross  national  product  to  avoid  the  economic  costs  associated  with  congestion  and\nbottlenecks. If not removed, transport bottlenecks will continue to be a major constraint to efficient,\nsustained economic growth. In the wake of the Asian financial crisis, the PRC has implemented a\nstrategy to stimulate domestic demand. As part of this strategy, the Government developed a Y10\ntrillion infrastructure investment program from 1998 to 2000 to help ease the transport constraints.\nThis program included projects in urban and rural areas and investments in housing and roads. It\nwill  be  difficult  for  the  Government  to  sustain  this  level  of  investment  even  with  official\ndevelopment  assistance  sources.  An  increasing  proportion  of  financing  will  have  to  come  from\ndomestic and international private sector sources. Further reforms are needed in transport policy,\nregulation,  and  pricing  to  encourage  financing  from  such  sources,  reduce  inefficiencies,  and\ncapture the benefits of a more balanced intermodal transport system.\n\nc.\n\nInstitutions\n\n9.\nAt  the  national  level,  the  State  Development  Planning  Commission  formulates  five-year\ndevelopment  plans  and  establishes  priorities  and  targets  for  transport  in  consultation  with  the\nministries  responsible  for  the  transport  subsectors  and  with  representatives  of  transport  users.\nThe  Ministry  of  Communications  (MOC)  is  responsible  for  national  highways,  inland  waterways,\ncoastal  shipping,  and  major  ports;  the  Ministry  of  Railways  for  the  national  rail  system;  and  the\nCivil Aviation Administration for air transport and airports. In line with the country's decentralization\npolicies,  many  of  the  administrative  and  operational  functions  have  been  devolved  to  the\nprovincial  communications  departments  (PCDs).6  MOC  provides  guidance  to  the  provincial\ngovernments.  Its  main  responsibilities  include  planning  and  coordinating  transport  investments,\nand  formulating  transport  policies.  MOC  shares  financing  for  the  national  highway  system  with\nprovincial governments, contingent on the latter using MOC-prescribed road design standards.\n\n2.\n\nThe Road Subsector\n\na. \n\nRoad Network\n\n10.\nThe  PRC  road  network  had  about  1.4  million  km  of  roads  at  the  end  of  2000,  but  is\nunderdeveloped in both quality and extent. While 51,000 km of new roads were opened to traffic\nin 2000, including 4,709 km of expressways,7 expressways and class I highways still account for\nonly  2.6  percent  of  the  total  road  network,  and  class  II  highways  for  about  10.9  percent.  The\nremaining 86.5 percent (class III highways and below) are medium- to low-grade paved roads and\ngravel roads. With only about 1,100 km of classified roads per million inhabitants, the density of\nthe PRC's road network is  low.8 Many roads are constructed to low design standards and have\nneither the capacity nor the structural strength to carry current traffic volumes and loads.

In  Japan,  where  arable  land  is  in  equally  short\nsupply, there are 90 square meters of road per capita, compared with 20 in the PRC and 496 in the United States.\n\n\f4\n\ntend  to  be  congested  and  pavements  show  signs  of  roughness  and  failure.  GZAR  has  about\n1,100  km  of  classified  roads  per  million  inhabitants,  in  line  with  the  national  average,  but  with\nlower  average  standard.  At  the  end  of  2000,  of  GZAR's  52,910  km  of  roads,  only  2.3  percent\nwere  expressway  or  class  I,  and  5.0  percent  class  II.  The  remaining  92.7  percent  were  lower\ngrade roads, including 31.4 percent of class III highways and 61.3 percent of class IV highways\nor below.  In the project area, the  road conditions are as poor as in the rest of GZAR, with 62\npercent of class IV highways or below.\n\nb.\n\nVehicle Fleet and Traffic\n\n11.\nIn 2000, the PRC vehicle fleet totaled 15.5 million trucks, cars, and buses, and 46.5 million\nother motorized vehicles (special vehicles, tractors, and motorcycles). The total number of trucks,\ncars, and buses increased by about 1.3 million in 2000, with the market share for trucks dropping\nto 45.0 percent, down from 66.8 percent in 1990. Despite the rapid increase in total vehicles, the\nPRC has only about 1.3 vehicles (trucks, cars or buses) for 100 persons, which is low relative to\nother countries in the Asian and Pacific region.9 Not until the early 1980s were modern vehicles\nimported  and  joint  ventures  formed  with  foreign  automobile  manufacturers  to  introduce  modern\ntechnology.  There  are  plans  to  invest  up  to  $7  billion  in  automotive  manufacturing  in  the  PRC\nbetween 2000 and 2005. The PRC\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization should increase\ninvestment  in  automobile  production.  The  modernization  of  the  vehicle  fleet  will  improve  vehicle\nsafety  and  reduce  fuel  consumption  and  vehicle  emissions.  In  2000  the  GZAR  had  308,100\ntrucks and passenger vehicles, equal to 2 percent of the national fleet. This translates into 0.65\nvehicles per 100 people in GZAR, half the national average. Growth in the number of vehicles in\nGZAR during the 1990s, at about 10 percent per annum, was lower than the national average of\nabout 12 percent per annum. This reflects the fact that GZAR is a poor region.\n\n12.\nThe  privately  owned  fleet  of  motor  vehicles  in  the  PRC  increased  more  than  20  times\nduring 1985-2000, from 0.3 million vehicles to 6.3 million. In 2000, trucks accounted for 41 percent\nof  the  total  privately  owned  vehicles;  cars  and  buses,  58  percent;  and  other  special  vehicles,  1\npercent. In GZAR, privately owned motor vehicles totaled 138,700 in 2000. Given the PRC's rapid\neconomic growth and low vehicle ownership, the vehicle fleet, both public and private, is expected\nto  continue  to  grow  rapidly  in  the  coming  years.  This  will  result  in  substantial  increase  in  the\nvolume  of  road  traffic  and  mounting  congestion.  The  high  share  of  slow-moving  traffic,  mainly\ntractors,  bicycles,  and  nonmotorized  agricultural  vehicles,  aggravates  road  congestion  and  is  a\nmajor cause of traffic accidents.\n\nc.\n\nThe Road Transport Industry\n\n13.\nThe PCDs are responsible for regulating the road transport industry by licensing drivers,\nvehicles, and intercity bus services. Road transport tariffs are subject to controls in the range of\nplus or minus 20 percent of locally established tariffs. The relaxation of trucking regulations in the\n1980s  allowed  privately  owned  trucks  to  haul  cargo  for  state-owned  factories  and  cooperatives.\nPrivately owned trucks absorbed most of the traffic growth in the 1990s with the market share of\nstate-owned  transportation  companies  declining.  The  resulting  competition  is  improving  road\ntransport efficiency and the quality of services. ADB supported this process through TA.10 MOC is\nencouraging the private sector to augment the overall capacity of the road transport industry. The\nannual passenger handling capacity increased from 12.0 billion passengers in 1997 to 14.5 billion\n\n                  \n\n9  Figures  for  other  countries  are  2.5  for  India,  5.0  for  Indonesia,  14.3  for  Thailand,  59.6  for  Australia,  and  65.3  for\n\nJapan.\n\n10 TA 1940-PRC: Efficiency Improvements in Road Transport, for $550,000, approved on 25 August 1993.\n\n\f5\n\nin  2000.  About  900,000  buses  were  operating  in  2000  compared  with  764,000  in  1994.  About\n85,000 bus routes served more than 94 percent of the villages accessible by road.\n\nd. \n\nRoad Administration\n\n14.\nRoad  administration  in  the  PRC  is  decentralized.  At  the  provincial  level,  the  PCDs  are\nresponsible  for  the  highway  networks  and  plan,  budget,  and  finance  road  projects.  The  PCDs\nare  generally  financially  independent  of  the  central  Government  except  for  large  projects  of\nnational significance. MOC provides policy guidance and technical support to the PCDs through\nnational  policies,  regulations,  and  design  and  construction  standards.  Provincial  planning\ncommissions approve development plans and projects. The PCDs, through their city, prefecture,\nand  county-level  units,  are  responsible  for  planning  and  administering  the  road  subsector,\nincluding constructing and maintaining the road network. Road safety is mainly the responsibility\nof the Ministry of Public Security at the national and local government levels. Testing of vehicles\nand  vehicle  emissions  is  the  responsibility  of  local  environmental  protection  bureaus  in\nconjunction with provincial public security bureaus. The road subsector agencies are generally\nwell  staffed  with  trained  technical  personnel,  particularly  at  the  central  and  provincial  levels.\nHuman  resource  development  systems  provide  regular  training  for  technical  staff,  operators,\nand  technicians.  ADB  has  supported  human  resource  development  in  subsector  institutions\nunder loans and TAs. ADB\u2019s country assistance program evaluation for the PRC concluded that,\nin the transport sector, executing agencies (EAs) have been making good use of the knowledge\ntransfer and in-country and external training opportunities provided under ADB projects.11\n\ne.\n\nRoad Subsector Revenues and Expenditures\n\n15.\nThe  PRC's  road  investment  needs  from  1996  to  2010  are  estimated  at  $504  billion.\nAvailable revenues are estimated at $302 billion from road user charges and $29 billion from toll\ncollections, leaving a financing gap of $173 billion or about $12 billion per year. Consistent with\nADB's policy dialogue, the Government is creating a framework to attract private sector finance for\nroad construction. While the private sector is willing to participate under concession agreements,\nor in refinancing, leasing, and securitization, it has not participated in many build-operate-transfer\n(BOT)  type  projects  that  entail  taking  the  initial  risks  of  construction  and  traffic  demand.  Private\nsector  financing  is  most  likely  to  be  available  to  finance  about  5  percent  of  the  high-grade  and\nprovincial road networks.\n\nExpenditures  in  highway  infrastructure  are  financed  from  dedicated  user  charges,\n16.\nGovernment  grants,  domestic  bank  loans  and  bonds,  and  foreign  loans  and  investments.  Two\ndedicated user charges, the road maintenance fee and the vehicle purchase fee, have provided\nmuch  of  the  financing  for  the  road  subsector.  During  the  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan,  1996-2000,  the\nroad maintenance fee, levied on the revenue of freight and passenger transport companies and\non the load capacity of private vehicles, provided about 53 percent of total financing requirements\nof  road  investments.  Revenues  from  the  vehicle  purchase  fee,  levied  on  the  retail  price  of\nvehicles,  financed  about  13  percent,  mostly  in  poorer  provinces  as  government  policy.  MOC\nprovided  supplementary  financing  of  about  2  percent  of  the  requirements  to  construct  or\nrehabilitate rural roads in poverty areas. Domestic loans and bond financing, generally with short\nmaturities, were still relatively low, and accounted for 9 percent of all highway investments. Other\ndomestic  investments,  including  financing  from  local  governments  and  state-owned  enterprises,\naccounted for 12 percent of the requirements. Foreign loans cover 8 percent of the investment in\nhighway  construction,  and  foreign  direct  investment  the  remaining  3  percent.  During  the  1980s\n\n11 CAP: PRC 98026: Country Assistance Program Evaluation, People\u2019s Republic of China, December 1998.\n\n                  \n\n\f6\n\nand  1990s,  the  PRC  increased  its  foreign  borrowing  for  infrastructure,  mainly  from  ADB,  the\nJapan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and the World Bank (paras. 28-29).\n\n17.\nAs  part  of  a  tax  reform  to  bring  off-budget  revenues  and  expenditures  within  the\nframework of the national budget, the National People\u2019s Congress amended the Highway Law\non  31  October  1999.  The  amendments  laid  the  foundation  for  future  legislation  providing  for\nnational  taxes  to  replace  provincial  and  local  fees.  The  vehicle  purchase  fee  was  replaced  by\nthe vehicle purchase tax effective January 2001, and a fuel tax is expected to replace the road\nmaintenance  fee,  and  generate  a  similar  or  higher  level  of  revenue.  Based  on  findings  of  an\nADB-financed  TA,12  the  fuel  tax  is  likely  to  improve  financing  of  the  road  subsector.  The\nGovernment  prepared  detailed  measures  for  introducing  the  fuel  tax,  but  delayed  its\nimplementation due to the high international price of oil. Implementation is now expected to take\nplace  before  the  end  of  2001  if  international  oil  price  declines.  The  amendments  also  prohibit\nlocal  governments  from  levying  on  some  roads  tolls  that  are  not  authorized.  Thus,  arbitrary\ncharges in the road subsector that are a regressive tax impacting most heavily on the poor will\nbe  eliminated.  Also,  transparency  and  accountability  in  the  use  of  such  off-budget  funds  were\nweak.  Fiscal  accountability  is  expected  to  improve  with  the  replacement  of  these  off-budget\nrevenues  with  a  fuel  tax  that  is  subject  to  the  oversight  and  control  mechanisms  built  into  the\nfiscal process.\n\n18. Within  each  province,  the  PCD  is  responsible  for  planning,  financing,  and  constructing\nnational and provincial roads. County and village roads are the responsibility of the prefecture,\ncounty,  and  township  governments.  Since  the  resources  of  the  local  governments  are\nconstrained,  the  adequate  financing  of  roads  among  competing  claims  is  a  major  challenge,\nparticularly for local roads in poverty counties. The PCD generally provides budgetary support\nfor county road construction and improvement. However, an increasing proportion of provincial\nroad  budgets  is  being  used  to  meet  the  national  priority  for  expressway  and  highway\nconstruction.  In  GZAR  the  proportion  of  expressway  funding  in  the  provincial  road  budget\nincreased  from  16  percent  to  39  percent  in  the  last  five  years,  while  the  proportion  for  county\nand  township  roads  declined  from  84  percent  to  61  percent.  However,  in  2000  the  GZAR\ngovernment allocated additional funds to upgrade local roads in poor areas. The funding of road\nand  other  infrastructure  improvements  in  rural  areas  is  supplemented  by  poverty  alleviation\nfunds allocated separately. The scope of the proposed Project includes upgrading high priority\nlocal roads, financed by these additional funds. The inclusion of local roads in the project scope\nwill  help  ensure  that  expenditures  are  reasonably  balanced  between  expressways  and  local\nroads.  Revenues  and  expenditures  in  the  road  sector  in  GZAR  in  1998-2000  are  included  in\nAppendix 3.\n\nf.\n\nRoad Engineering, Construction, and Maintenance\n\nRoad  and  bridge  projects  are  designed  by  the  planning  and  design  institutes  at  the\n19.\nprovincial,  prefectural,  and  county  levels.  MOC  reviews  the  designs  of  expressways,  class  I\nhighways, and associated structures. In general, the institutes are staffed with experienced, well\nqualified  personnel.  Construction  is  supervised  by  personnel  from  county,  city,  and  prefectural\nhighway units. The city and county highway bureaus have their own construction units to carry out\nminor projects within their administrative districts. Drawing on the experience gained under ADB-\nand  World  Bank-financed  projects,  competitive  bidding  practices  were  mandated  by  the  1999\nTendering  and  Bidding  Law  (para.  42).  Many  of  the  larger  provincial  and  urban  construction\nbureaus  are  being  reorganized  into  financially  independent  companies  and  have  been  awarded\n\n12 TA 3086-PRC: Regional Road Sector Study, for $1.185 million, approved on 13 October 1998.\n\n                  \n\n\f7\n\ncontracts individually or as partners in joint ventures on several previous ADB- and World Bank-\nfinanced highway projects in the PRC or overseas.\n\n20.\nIn  1999,  MOC  implemented  a  series  of  measures  to  enhance  quality  control  in  highway\nconstruction and carried out two nationwide quality audits of the construction of national highways\nand  major  trunk  roads.  From  1999,  as  required  by  MOC,  all  PCDs,  including  the  Guangxi\nCommunications Department (GCD), are inspecting the quality of their ongoing road construction\nworks.  Taking  into  account  findings  of  the  audits,  MOC  will  adopt  more  stringent  regulations  to\nensure that roads are constructed to national standards. Investment will be increased in regions\nthat have completed good quality roads that are well managed and well maintained. Regions with\nprojects of substandard quality due to inappropriate technical design or poor implementation will\nreceive decreased investment.\n\n21.\nRoad  maintenance  is  well  organized  and  is  carried  out  mainly  through  labor-intensive\noperations. Maintenance expenditures have decreased as a percentage of total road expenditures\nin  the  past  decade  (however,  maintenance  is  generally  adequate).  MOC  has  established  an\nadvanced  road  maintenance  management  system,  consisting  of  a  road  data  bank  and  a\npavement  management  system.  It  is  being  introduced  in  stages  to  all  provinces,  autonomous\nregions, and municipalities, including GZAR, and will become the key tool for programming future\nmaintenance needs and budgets.\n\n3.\n\nTransport and Poverty Reduction\n\n22.\nThe impact of transport infrastructure investments on poverty reduction is demonstrated\nby recent studies that examined the effectiveness of government expenditure on various sectors\nin  contributing  to  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  using  an  econometric  model,  in  India  and\nIndonesia.13 The studies concluded that government expenditure on roads has a larger impact\non poverty reduction, productivity, and growth than does expenditure on other sectors, such as\nirrigation, soil and water, power, education, and health. Labor is the major resource of the poor.\nFor  the  poor  to  be  able  to  capitalize  on  their  major  asset,  they  need  access  to  jobs  and  to\ntransport  for  bringing  the  goods  they  produce  to  markets.  Benefits  for  poor  rural  areas  include\nlower  transport  costs,  lower  cost  of  inputs,  better  access  to  services  and  therefore  improved\nfarming practices, and better access to health and education. This was also highlighted in World\nBank reports.14\n\n23.\nIn the PRC, the link between transport development and poverty reduction is supported\nby  studies  and  evaluation  of  several  completed  transport  projects,  financed  by  ADB  and  the\nWorld  Bank.  In  Shaanxi  Province,  TA15  showed  the  linkage  between  road  density  and  rural\nincomes from 1990 to 1999: the higher the road density, the higher the per capita rural incomes.\nIn  Liaoning  Province,16  construction  of  a  109  km  expressway  with  203  km  of  local  roads  was\nassociated  with  rural  incomes  more  than  doubling  in  the  project  area.  Similarly,  impressive\nimprovements in living standards have been experienced in the areas of influence of two railway\n\n                  \n\n13  Shenggen Fan, Peter Hazell, and Sukhadeo Thorat. 1999.

The  poor  have  limited\nmobility  beyond  their  immediate  communities  because  of  geographical  isolation  and  the  high\ncost  of  motorized  transport.  As  a  result,  the  poor  view  roads  as  key  infrastructure  needed  for\naccelerating  socioeconomic  development.  Rural  poor  benefit  from  greater  employment\nopportunities, and the transition from subsistence farming to cash crop and higher value crops,\nwhich  results  in  a  more  stable  income  flow  and  leads  to  poverty  reduction.  Better  roads  also\naddress the nonincome dimensions of poverty. Improved access helps attract resident teachers\nand  health  personnel,  and  facilitates  visits  by  specialists  to  health,  education,  and  other\ncommunity  facilities  within  the  villages.  It  also  facilitates  visits  of  villagers  to  such  facilities\noutside  the  villages.  An  ongoing  TA19  recommended  setting  up  a  special  mechanism  to  fund\nrural  infrastructure  pilot  schemes  in  the  PRC,  including  roads,  to  investigate  the  direct  and\nindirect effects on poverty reduction. This is being carried out in Guizhou Province where rural\nroads, in addition to other rural infrastructure, are being built in poor villages, and the effects of\nsuch infrastructure systematically measured, monitored, and evaluated. A regional TA20 is being\nimplemented  to  further  examine  the  poverty  reduction  impact  of  infrastructure  projects.  The\n2002  PRC  TA  program  includes  a  study  to  assess  in  detail  the  linkage  between  transport\ninfrastructure and poverty.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n24.\nThe heart of the road network is the NTHS, a system of interprovincial expressways and\nhigh-class highways of about 35,000 km, to be constructed over a 20-year period up to 2010. The\nNTHS will be complemented by the development of a network of new national, provincial, county,\nand village roads. The Government views road development as a key component of its strategy to\nimprove access to markets and services. In particular, the Government's investment plans for the\nroad  subsector  consider  the  need  to  provide  infrastructure  to  facilitate  economic  growth  and\nreduce  poverty.  The  Government's  policies  for  road  development  are  based  on  the  following\nprinciples: (i) constructing expressways to expand the NTHS to link all cities with a population of\nmore  than  500,000;  (ii)  developing  secondary  roads,  particularly  those  that  will  help  reduce\npoverty and promote rural markets; and (iii) building roads that will support regional cooperation\nwith neighboring countries in the southwest, northeast, and northwest.\n\n25.\nThe  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan  (10FYP),  2001-2005,  approved  by  the  National  People\u2019s\nCongress,  calls  for  (i)  accelerating  the  construction  of  the  backbone  network  of  highways  and\nnational  roads,  with  the  focus  being  on  five  north-south  and  seven  east-west  expressways\nincluded in the NTHS, and fully opening three north-south and two east-west expressways; (ii)\nachieving  the  initial  construction  of  eight  new  highways  in  the  western  region  to  improve  the\nstructure  of  the  highway  network  and  its  reach  (para.  27);  and  (iii)  by  2005,  having\napproximately  1.6  million  km  of  highways  open  to  traffic,  with  expressways  accounting  for\n25,000  km.  The  10FYP  will  support  highway  construction  in  the  rural  areas  to  improve  road\n\n                  \n\n17 PCR:  PRC  26462: Jing-Jiu Railway Technical Enhancement Project,  April  2000,  and  PCR:  PRC  22276: Hefei-\n\nJiujiang Railway Project, February 2000.\n\n18 Hatim  Hajj  and  V.

First, the focus of NTHS construction has been shifting to the central\nand southwest regions, which have a higher incidence of poverty. Second, the vehicle purchase\nfee,  which  has  financed  about  13  percent  of  road  subsector  expenditures,  has  been  allocated\nprimarily  to  poorer  provinces  for  financing  road  investments.  Third,  MOC  grants  and  PCD\nresources  are  used  to  supplement  budgets  of  county  and  township  governments  to  improve\ntownship  roads.  Fourth,  through  the  separate  budgeting  of  poverty  alleviation  funds,  road\nimprovements are carried out to bring an increasing number of villages into the road network, by\nimproving the quality of transport services available to them.\n\n27.\nIn  March  2000,  the  Government  adopted  the  long-term  Great  Western  Development\nStrategy for developing the western part of the country.21 This strategy has been reflected as the\nkey  theme  of  the  10FYP.  The  strategy  aims  to  reduce  development  disparities  between  the\nwestern region and the coastal region, and to give the highest priority to road development as an\neffective  mean  to  promote  economic  growth  and  reduce  poverty  in  the  region.  In  the  road\nsubsector, the strategy aims at (i) facilitating economic development and poverty reduction in the\nwestern region, where road density is only less than half of the national average; (ii) linking the\nwestern region with the central and eastern regions; (iii) providing access to the trade outlets for\nthe western region at the eastern and southern seaports; and (iv) promoting regional cooperation\nwith  the  neighboring  countries  to  the  west  and  southwest  of  the  PRC.  ADB  is  providing  TA22  to\nhelp the Government implement the Great Western Development Strategy. ADB\u2019s 2001 program\nincludes  TA  to  help  the  Government  identify  ways  to  attract  foreign  direct  investment  to  the\nwestern region.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Subsector\n\n28.\nExternal  assistance  to  the  road  subsector  has  come  mainly  from  ADB,  JBIC,  and  the\nWorld Bank. Since 1985, the World Bank has provided about $5.3 billion to finance 22 highway\nprojects and 6 urban transport projects. The projects supported (i) priority sections of the NTHS,\nparticularly  in  the  central  and  northwestern  regions;  and  (ii)  capacity  building  in  construction\nsupervision, quality control, design and planning, road safety, and pavement management. JBIC\nhas provided about $990 million equivalent for six bridge projects and five highway projects within\nthe  NTHS  framework,  mostly  in  the  central  region.  ADB's  policy  dialogue  in  the  road  subsector\nand identification of projects are coordinated with JBIC and the World Bank.\n\n29.\nSince  1991,  ADB  has  provided  18  loans  totaling  nearly  $3.2  billion  for  2,644  km  of\nhighway development, and two loans totaling $155 million for bridges in Shanghai. The Nanpu\nand  Yangpu  bridges  are  open  to  traffic,  and  traffic  volumes  have  exceeded  the  appraisal\nestimates.  Among  the  road  projects  financed  by  ADB,  10  are  completed  and  open  to  traffic.23\nMost expressway projects are being implemented ahead of the original construction schedules.\n\n                  \n\n21  Consisting  of  12  provinces,  autonomous  regions,  or  municipality:  Chongqing,  Gansu,  Guangxi;  Guizhou,  Inner\nMongolia,  Ningxia,  Qinghai,  Shaanxi,  Sichuan,  Xinjiang,  Xizang,  and  Yunnan,  and  three  prefectures:  Enshi  Tujia\nand  Miao  Minority  Autonomous  prefecture  of  Hubei  province,  Xiangxi  Tujia  and  Miao  Minority  Autonomous\nprefecture of Hunan province, and Yanbian Korean Minority Autonomous prefecture of Jilin Province.\n22 TA 3468-PRC: Policy Support for PRC 2020 Project (Phase III), for $900,000, approved on 14 July 2000.\n23 Hebei  Expressway,  Hebei  Roads,  Heilongjiang  Expressway,  Hunan  Expressway,  Jiangxi  Expressway,  Jilin\nExpressway,  Liaoning  Expressway,  Shenyang-Benxi  Highway,  Shenyang-Jinzhou  Expressway,  and  Yunnan\nExpressway Development.\n\n\f10\n\nThe EAs have a good record of complying with the major loan covenants, including the timely\nsubmission of audited project accounts. ADB has also provided 21 project preparatory TA grants\ntotaling $9.1 million and 19 advisory TA grants totaling $11.8 million to the road subsector. The\nadvisory  TAs  have  supported  the  development  of  road  infrastructure  by  addressing  policy  and\ninstitutional  issues,  including  highway  planning,  road  safety,  human  resource  development,\ntransport  pricing,  commercialization  and  corporatization  of  enterprises,  and  mobilization  of\nnongovernment financial resources.\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\n30.\nADB's experience in the PRC's road subsector has shown that the project preparation and\nimplementation  capability  of  the  agencies  concerned  is  strong.  In  general,  all  loans  to  the\nsubsector are being implemented satisfactorily. The technical staff have adequate capabilities for\ndesign  and  construction  supervision,  and  most  local  contractors  have  proven  competent.\nHowever,  they  need  to  acquire  expertise  in  modern  construction  methods  such  as  those  for\nconstructing long tunnels, large bridges, and flexible pavement design; modern operations such\nas toll collection methods and environmental protection; and commercial business practices. The\nuse of ADB loan and TA funds to upgrade the capabilities of the EAs has contributed to improved\nproject  quality.  However,  to  meet  the  implementation  schedule,  contractors  are  sometimes  put\nunder  pressure  and  consequently  the  bidding  process,  contract  management,  and  construction\nquality  are  compromised.  This  might  have  contributed  to  the  collapse  of  tunnels  during\nconstruction of some ADB-financed expressways. Insufficient time allowed for soil settlement may\nhave adversely affected pavement quality. ADB has taken these matters up as part of the policy\ndialogue with MOC and the EAs (para. 42).\n\n31.\nTraffic  volumes  for  completed  projects  have  generally  grown  faster  than  appraisal\nforecasts.  The  project  completion  reports  of  ADB-financed  expressways  in  the  PRC  concluded\nthat  four  projects  were  generally  successful,24  and  one  was  partly  successful,  mainly  due  to\ninadequate  safety  facilities  and  enforcement  as  well  as  partial  compliance  with  environmental\nmitigation measures.25 The reports recommended that the EAs strengthen road safety measures\nand increase benefit monitoring activities. International consulting inputs for a safety audit and for\nmonitoring  and  evaluation  are  included  in  the  proposed  Project.  The  project  performance  audit\nreport26 of two ADB-financed expressways in the PRC concluded that one project was successful\nand  the  other  highly  successful.  One  of  the  key  lessons  identified  in  the  report  is  that\ncorporatization  (restructuring  of  government  departments  as  corporations)  of  the  expressway  in\nJilin  Province  was  an  effective  option  for  resolving  funding  shortfalls  and  ultimately  contributing\ntoward financing future expressway development. Under the proposed Project, GCD will establish\na  state-owned  corporation.  GCD  will  be  the  sole  investor,  and  the  corporation  will  be\nresponsible \nfor  construction,  operation,  maintenance,  repair,  and  management  of  all\nexpressways in GZAR (para. 51).\n\n32.\nADB's  TA  program  in  the  road  subsector  has  been  generally  successful.  Some  of  the\nmore recent TAs have been instrumental in focusing the Government's attention on the need to\n\n                  \n\n24 PCR:  PRC  23032:  Shenyang-Benxi Highway Project,  September  1998;  PCR:  PRC  24335:  Jilin Expressway\nProject,  October  1998;  PCR:  PRC  24335: Hunan Expressway Project,  September  2000;  and  PCR:  PRC  27398:\nLiaoning Expressway Project, September 2000.\n\n25 Remedial  actions  are  being  taken  by  the  EA  for  the  Heilongjiang  Expressway  Project,  which  was  rated  partly\nsuccessful  in  PCR:  PRC  26377:  Heilongjiang  Expressway  Project,  October  1999,  through  rectifying  the\ninfrastructure  deficiencies,  enforcing  harsher  penalties  for  traffic  violations,  and  implementing  the  environmental\nmitigation measures recommended in the environmental impact assessment.\n\n26 PPA: PRC 23032/24335: Shenyang-Benxi Highway and Jilin Expressway Projects, October 2000.\n\n\f11\n\nexpand  its  sources  of  finance  for  highway  development,  and  the  institutional,  policy,  and\nregulatory issues that need to be addressed to facilitate the use of a broader set of modalities for\ndomestic  and  foreign  resource  mobilization.  Specific  improvements  have  been  effected  as  a\nresult,  and  are  now  being  disseminated  widely  to  all  provinces.  In  January  2001,  ADB's\nOperations Evaluation Office (OEO) completed a performance audit report on traffic safety TAs.27\nThe two TAs implemented in the PRC (para. 43) were rated highly satisfactory.\n\n33.\nIn  1998,  OEO  completed  its  first  country  assistance  program  evaluation.  The  evaluation\nconcluded  that  ADB\u2019s  monitoring  mechanisms  showed  high  levels  of  performance  for  ongoing\ntransport projects and TAs. Also in 1998, OEO carried out a special study on the operation and\nmaintenance of road facilities and their impact on project sustainability.28 The study concluded that\nmaintenance of roads completed under ADB projects has not been a serious problem in the PRC.\nAn effective budgetary allocation system is in place, and strong institutional capacity to maintain\nthe expressway system has been developed.\n\n34.\nAs part of a special audit of selected projects in the PRC, ADB\u2019s Office of the General\nAuditor investigated whether ADB loans have been used only for authorized purposes. A special\nreview  mission  was  fielded  for  an  ongoing  road  project29  in  December  1999.  Its  findings\nindicated that while proceeds of the ADB loan had not been used for any unauthorized purpose,\nthere  were  weaknesses  in  the  internal  control  system,  such  as  inadequate  internal  approval\nprocess for major contract variations and discrepancies in accounting practices. As a result, the\nmission,  in  its  discussions  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  the  China  National  Audit  Office,\nemphasized the need to adopt measures to inspect ongoing projects as part of their supervision\nand audit. A modification of the audit report format has also been proposed for all ADB-financed\nprojects to improve auditing of project accounts. Under the proposed Project, to strengthen the\ninternal control systems in GCD, an international consultant will be appointed as an deputy chief\nsupervision engineer responsible for helping the chief supervision engineer authorize variation\norders,  contractors\u2019  payments,  and  subcontracting  arrangements,  and  for  countersigning  the\nrelated orders and certificates. The consultant will be assisted by domestic consultants.\n\nE.\n\nADB\u2019s Subsector Strategy\n\nADB's  PRC  country  operational  strategy30  gives  high  priority  to  removing  infrastructure\n35.\nconstraints and supporting policy and institutional reforms. Given the importance of road transport\nin the development of a market economy and in poverty reduction, ADB will continue its lending to\nthe  road  subsector  for  (i)  the  NTHS;  (ii)  roads  that  improve  the  access  of  less  developed,  poor\nrural  areas  to  regional  market  centers;  and  (iii)  selected  urban  transport  projects.  With  the\ncompletion of the northeast transport corridor, the focus of ADB\u2019s activities in the road subsector\nhas shifted to poorer provinces in southwest and central PRC. Improving road infrastructure will\nfacilitate economic growth in these poor areas. Sustained, broad-based economic growth will, in\n\n                  \n\n27 TPA: IND/PRC/STU 2000-21: Selected Technical Assistance in Road Safety, January 2001.\n28 Operations Evaluation Office. 1998.

There has been an alleged\ncase of corruption, involving a senior official of an EA that is implementing road projects, including one financed by\nADB (Loan 1638-PRC: Chengdu-Nanchong Expressway in Sichuan Province). According to information available,\nthe corruption case is not related to the ADB-financed project although the investigation is still ongoing.\n\n30 STS PRC 95027: Country Operational Strategy Study: People's Republic of China, May 1997, and Sec.

An ADB-financed study (footnote 12) for the five administrative areas in\nthe southwest region showed the lack of high class road infrastructure in and out of the region,\nbetween the administrative areas, and within the administrative areas, which increases the cost of\ntransport. The study helped the Government identify road project packages and capacity building\nactivities in the southwest region for implementation during the 10FYP period. This shift in focus of\nADB operations is in line with ADB's strategic objective of promoting growth and reducing poverty\nin  inland  provinces.  The  Government  has  recently  reaffirmed  its  policy  of  increasing  road\nsubsector  funding  to  implement  the  NTHS  as  a  principal  means  of  promoting  and  sustaining\neconomic  growth.  The  Government  intends  to  continue  seeking  the  assistance  of  multilateral\ndevelopment  banks  for  the  construction  of  the  NTHS,  especially  for  sections  generating  direct\nrevenue that can be used for debt servicing.\n\nADB's  PRC  operational  strategy  in  the  road  subsector  supports  (i)  construction  of  roads\n36.\nthat connect major growth centers, promote linkages with hinterland economies, and/or promote\nregional cooperation; (ii) integration of the network so that the NTHS is supported by a system of\nlocal roads, particularly those that provide access to poor areas; (iii) promotion of road safety; (iv)\nfurther  institutional  strengthening  to  increase  the  commercial  orientation  and  efficiency  of\nexpressway  organizations;  (v)  improvement  of  highway  planning  and  evaluation  techniques;  (vi)\nadoption of appropriate pricing policies to ensure optimum use of road transport capacity; and (vii)\nuse  of  alternative  methods  of  investment  financing,  including  private  sector  participation.  The\nproposed Project will connect growth centers in a poor, interior province, support the development\nof local roads that will provide access for the local population to economic centers, and promote\neconomic  cooperation  between  PRC,  Viet  Nam,  and  other  countries  of  the  Greater  Mekong\nSubregion. The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country operational strategy.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n37.\nADB has been actively undertaking policy dialogue with the PRC on its road subsector\nsince  1991.  The  principal  issues  addressed  include  poverty  impact  of  road  projects,  highway\ndesign  standards,  construction  quality  and  road  safety,  vehicle  emissions,  pricing  policies,\ncommercialization and corporatization, and nongovernment financial resources. The status and\nachievements to date are discussed in the following paragraphs and summarized in Appendix 4.\n\n1.\n\nPoverty Impact of Road Projects\n\n38.\nADB  and  the  Government  have  had  extensive  discussions  on  how  to  enhance  the\npoverty  reduction  impact  of  road  investments  supported  by  ADB.  The  ADB  policy  dialogue\nfocused on three main issues. The first is the location of ADB-financed road subsector projects,\nwhich  has  shifted  from  the  northeast  and  coastal  areas  to  the  poorer  central  and  southwest\nregions. This shift to poorer interior provinces is sustained by the 10FYP (para. 25). Second, the\ndialogue focused on the inclusion of a local road network component. Since 1995, the scope of\nADB-financed  road  projects31  has  included  improvements  to  local  roads  connecting  to  the\nexpressway interchanges to facilitate access of rural communities to county centers and to the\nexpressway  facilities.  The  scope  of  the  proposed  Project  includes  upgrading  of  507  km  of\ncomplementary  county  and  village  roads  that  will  connect  poor  areas  to  the  expressway\n\n                  \n\n31 Chengdu-Nanchong  Expressway  Project,  Chongqing-Guizhou  Roads  Development  Projects \n\n(Leichong\nExpressway/Chongzun  Expressway),  Hebei  Expressway  Project,  Hebei  Roads  Development  Project,  Jiangxi\nExpressway  Project,  Liaoning  Expressway  Project,  Shanxi  Road  Development  Project,  Shenyang-Jinzhou\nExpressway  Project,  and  Southern  Yunnan  Road  Development  Project.  The  local  road  components  of  these\nprojects are being implemented or have been completed successfully, helping improve living conditions of the poor\npeople in the project area.\n\n\f13\n\ninterchanges. This complementary road program was formulated through ADB\u2019s policy dialogue,\nby prioritizing road sections that serve areas where most poor people live and where the most\nbeneficial impact can be made on poverty reduction. Third, ADB\u2019s policy dialogue centered on\nthe  use  of  remunerated  labor  and  the  greatest  possible  employment  of  poor  people  during\nproject  road  construction.  Specific  measures  have  been  formulated  in  the  Project  to  support\nthese objectives (paras. 92 and 106).\n\n2.\n\nHighway Design Standards and Construction Quality\n\n39.\nRecognizing the importance of sound engineering practices in the context of increasing\ntraffic volumes and heavy vehicles, MOC has recently revised, with ADB assistance, its highway\nengineering standards.32 Highways are now classified into five categories, expressways and four\nclasses  of  general  highways,  according  to  traffic  volumes,  functions,  and  service  levels.  For\nexpressways, four design speeds were introduced, and design standards for six-lane and eight-\nlane expressways added. Environmental protection, road safety, and integrated development of\nhighways are also incorporated in the revised standards.\n\n40.\nIn addition to the review of technical standards, ADB helped produce a highway design\nmanual  for  national  roads.  The  manual,  completed  in  December  1998,  elaborates  the  design\nprinciples and introduces design criteria and methods consistent with international engineering\npractices. The manual, which was translated into Chinese, is now being used on a trial basis by\nselected  design  institutes.  Initial  feedback  on  the  trial  use  has  been  positive.  Based  on\ninformation  collected  from  the  trial,  the  manual  will  be  updated  and  distributed  for  nationwide\nuse with adjustment to suit local conditions. The manual will promote the Government\u2019s efforts\nto improve construction quality, protect the environment, and enhance road safety and transport\nefficiency.  In  addition,  a  TA33  is  being  implemented  to  strengthen  project  performance\nmanagement  evaluation  capacity,  particularly  of  the  Key  Projects  Inspectorate  of  the  State\nDevelopment  Planning  Commission,  and  to  provide  an  independent  check  on  the  quality  of\nmajor construction projects.\n\n41.\nThe expressway component of the proposed Project has been designed in accordance\nwith the technical standards of highway engineering issued by MOC in January 1998 and in line\nwith  the  recently  developed  highway  design  manual.  An  international  consultant,  acting  as  an\nassistant  chief  supervision  engineer  throughout  the  construction  period,  will  help  the  chief\nsupervision  engineer  oversee  the  construction  supervision  process  and  ensure  construction\nquality. Further international inputs for construction supervision will be provided by earthworks,\nmechanical and electrical equipment, and tunnel specialists.\n\n42.\nThe  EAs  are  sometimes  under  pressure  to  meet  ambitious  implementation  schedules,\nand contractors selected with the primary objective to complete the works within a limited time.\nSuch  an  objective  is  detrimental  to  the  quality  of  works.  Irregularities  were  identified  in  the\nbidding process under some ADB-financed road projects. For example, bids were rejected due\nto minor technical or commercial deviations, or because the bid price was lower than an EA's\nunsubstantiated  \u201creasonable  price\u201d.34  To  improve  the  procurement  process,  ADB  assisted  the\nMinistry  of  Construction  with  preparing  the  national  bidding  law  and  related  regulations.  The\nTendering and Bidding Law, which was approved by the National People's Congress in August\n\n                  \n\n32 TA 2573-PRC: Review of Highway Design Standards, for $420,000, approved on 24 May 1996.\n33 TA  3375-PRC:  Project Performance Management Capacity Building,  for  $900,000,  approved  on  27  December\n\n1999.\n\n34 As a result, ADB declined to finance a major part of the civil works contracts under Loan 1641-PRC: Changchun-\n\nHarbin Expressway (Changyu Expressway), for $220 million, approved on 27 November 1998.\n\n\f14\n\n1999  and  became  effective  in  January  2000,  will  promote  a  transparent,  fair,  and  competitive\nbidding  process.  Although  its  application  is  limited  to  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB),  the\nTendering  and  Bidding  Law  is  expected  to  benefit  the  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)\nprocess  as  well  through  improving  the  EAs'  understanding  of  the  bidding  concept.  TA  for\ngovernance and public sector procurement is being implemented to help develop the guidelines\nand procedures on the implementation of the Tendering and Bidding Law.35 TA was approved in\nFebruary  2001  to  help  the  Government  formulate  a  comprehensive  Government  Procurement\nLaw that will incorporate the Tendering and Bidding Law.36\n\n3.\n\nRoad Safety\n\n43.\nRapid traffic growth on the largely substandard road network has led to increasing traffic\naccidents. Official statistics indicate that there were 616,971 road accidents in 2000, killing 93,853\npeople,  injuring  418,721,  and  resulting  in  direct  economic  losses  of  Y2.67  billion,  up  by  49\npercent,  12  percent,  46  percent,  and  26  percent,  respectively  from  the  previous  year.  Most\naccidents  are  the  result  of  drivers,  cyclists,  and  pedestrians  ignoring  traffic  regulations.  If\naccidents  at  railway  crossings,  in  military  areas,  at  roadworks,  and  on  roads  in  industrial  areas\nwere included, the number of deaths would increase to over 120,000 per year, a fatality rate of\naround 46 deaths per 10,000 vehicles. This is very high by international standards.37 In addition,\naccident  statistics  are  not  collected  or  analyzed  in  the  best  manner  to  identify  preventive\nmeasures.  Reducing  the  high  accident  rate  is  an  important  element  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue.\nConstruction  of  a  high-standard  expressway  normally  reduces  the  number  of  road  accidents.\nEvidence from the Shenyang-Dalian Expressway38 indicates that the accident rate was less than\nhalf of that for the parallel National Highway 202, a two-lane highway. ADB TAs at the provincial\nand regional levels39 have helped (i) formulate road safety guidelines, (ii) develop a master plan\nfor the systematic improvement of road safety, (iii) implement selected road safety pilot programs,\nand (iv) build capacity in road safety enforcement. Findings of the TAs are being disseminated to\nall  PCDs.  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  on  road  safety  is  being  enhanced  through  TA,40  which  aims  at\nincreasing road safety by raising public awareness and strengthening the capacity of the Ministry\nof Public Security for traffic safety, planning, and management. Under this TA, training sessions\nwere  held  in  Jiangsu  Province  in  April  2001,  covering  aspects  of  road  safety  and  traffic\nmanagement,  and  57  traffic  police  officers  from  almost  all  the  PRC  provinces,  autonomous\nregions,  and  municipalities  benefited  from  the  sessions.  Two  other  training  sessions  will  be\nconducted by the end of 2001, and the TA will develop a comprehensive action plan to address\ncritical road safety issues in the PRC.\n\nIn 2000, GZAR recorded 7,771 road accidents, involving 2,587 fatalities and 7,090 injuries.\n44.\nIn  the  project  area  in  2000,  accidents  increased  by  10  percent  over  the  previous  year  and  at  a\nhigher rate than traffic volumes, due to the poor condition of the existing road. In view of the high\naccident  rate,  GCD  is  carrying  out  a  road  safety  program  with  assistance  of  the  World  Bank,\nincluding  improvement  of  the  accident  reporting  system  and  identification  and  analysis  of\n\n35 TA 3457-PRC: Implementation of the Tendering and Bidding Law and Related Regulations, for $565,000, approved\n\n                  \n\n36 TA 3631-PRC: Formulation of the Government Procurement Law, for $578,000, approved on 20 February 2001.\n37 Comparative  figures  for  other  countries  in  terms  of  deaths  per  10,000  vehicles  are  26.5  for  India,  11.8  for\n\nIndonesia, 8.5 for Thailand, 2.3 for Australia, and 1.9 for Japan.\n\n38 Liaoning  Provincial  Communications  Department.  1994.

In  this  context,  the  Project  will  include  several  measures  to  improve  the\nroad  safety  situation,  such  as  axle  load  weighing  stations,  standard  road  signs,  and  training  of\nstaff  of  the  EA  in  road  safety.  The  final  design  of  the  project  will  incorporate  the  traffic  safety\nmeasures recommended in the PPTA final report regarding road design. These include careful\ndesign of at grade intersections, provision of an alternative road for slow moving vehicles on the\nclass  I  section,  speed  limits  to  suit  the  geometric  design,  frequent  speed  limit  and  speed\nadvisory signs, well defined transitions where there is a change in design speed, and extended\nramp deceleration lengths where ramp design speeds are low. A safety audit of the expressway\nwill  be  conducted  by  consultants  recruited  under  the  Project.  Findings  of  previous  ADB  road\nsafety TAs were presented to GCD and the Guangxi Security Bureau during project processing,\nand  officials  of  the  Guangxi  Security  Bureau  attended  the  first  workshop  of  TA  3341-PRC  in\nApril 2001 (para. 43).\n\n4.\n\nVehicle Emissions\n\n45.\nAir quality in most PRC cities, and in many rural areas, is poor. The major cause is the\nburning  of  coal  in  power  plants,  boilers,  district  heating  systems,  and  factories.  However,\npollution from vehicles is increasing rapidly and has drawn attention to particular pollutants. In\nsome cities, vehicles already account for 80 percent of total carbon emission levels, 50 percent\nof  nitrogen  oxides,  and  a  substantial  proportion  of  lead.  Under  ADB-financed  TA,41  the\nGovernment  is  exploring  the  use  of  market-based  instruments  such  as  subsidies,  fuel  taxes,\nemission  charges,  congestion  charges,  and  tradable  area  licenses,  to  help  reduce  vehicle\nemissions.\n\nMeasures have been taken in provincial capitals and other cities to limit the distribution\n46.\nof  leaded fuels. Since 1 January 2000 there has been no further production, and since 1  July\n2000  no  further  sale  of  leaded  fuels  in  the  PRC.  Trucks  and  heavy  vehicles  in  the  PRC  are\nmostly  using  diesel  engine,  which  do  not  require  any  lead  additives,  and  there  has  been  no\ndifficulty  in  switching  to  unleaded  fuel  as  it  becomes  widely  available.  In  addition,  use  of\nliquefied  petroleum  gas  instead  of  gasoline  is  being  promoted  in  Beijing,  where  1,000  buses\nwere converted in 1998, and in other cities. The Government is encouraging the use of ethanol\nas a cleaner, higher-octane additive and alternative to gasoline. The ethanol application will be\ncarried out on an experimental basis by adding 10 percent ethanol to gasoline.\n\n47.\nImproved  emissions  standards  for  new  vehicles  are  directed  at  reducing  carbon\nmonoxide  and  nitrous  oxides  emissions.  Vehicle  emissions  are  tested  when  new  vehicles  are\nproduced.  Partial  and  full  European  standards  will  be  implemented  for  the  production  and\nimportation of small vehicles in 2001 and 2004, respectively, and for larger vehicles in 2002 and\n2005. Similarly, motorcycles will be subject to European standards in two phases, by 2001 and\n2005.\n\n48.\nRegulation  of  vehicle  emissions  is  the  responsibility  of  local  environmental  protection\nbureaus,  in  cooperation  with  the  traffic  division  of  the  public  security  bureaus.42  Vehicles  are\nsubject  to  annual  inspection,  which  can  be  done  on  a  customized  basis  for  fleets  of  transport\nenterprises. In addition, vehicle emission testing is carried out at some city boundaries, where\ntime-bound permits are issued for use of the vehicle in the city, and there is also random testing\n\n41 TA 2951-PRC: Promotion of Market-Based Instruments for Environmental Management, for $697,000, approved on\n\n42 The  Government  strengthened  the  control  of  emissions  from  motor  vehicles  by  amending  the  Air  Pollution\n\n                  \n\n16 December 1997.\n\nPrevention and Control Act in April 2000.\n\n\f16\n\non highways. These activities are self-financing; inspection fees and fines are sufficient to fund\nexpanding  inspection  and  testing  programs.  As  the  interprovincial  movement  of  vehicles  is\nencouraged  by  development  of  the  NTHS,  there  is  a  need  to  harmonize  among  provinces\ndifferences  in  vehicle  emission  control  and  regulations,  enforcement  and  monitoring,  testing\nprograms, certification, and inspection procedures. This issue is being addressed under a TA43\nthat  assists  governments  to  develop  and  implement  policies  to  reduce  vehicle  emissions  on  a\nregional  basis,  including  the  PRC.  The  TA  will  also  assist  selected  governments  to  formulate\naction plans to reduce vehicle emissions. The TA\u2019s activities will focus primarily on fuel quality,\nalternative  fuels,  the  regulation  of  two  and  three  wheeled  motorized  vehicles,  vehicle  testing,\ninspection,  and  transport  planning.  A  regional  workshop  on  inspection  and  maintenance  of\nvehicles will be organized in Chongqing in November 2001. In GZAR, vehicle emission control\nis  carried  out,  strictly  following  the  relevant  provisions  specified  in  the  Atmospheric  Pollution\nControl  Law  (1987  and  revised  in  1995),  the  State  Regulations  on  Vehicle  Emission  Control\n(1990), and GZAR\u2019s Regulation on Supervision and Administration of Vehicle Emission Control\n(1993/1996).\n\n5.\n\nPricing Policies for Road Users\n\n49.\nThe  Government\u2019s  policy  on  road  user  charges  allows  cost  recovery  through  tolls  for\nexpressways and highways that are partly funded through loan financing, and meet the following\nconditions: (i) high traffic volumes, (ii) a relatively inelastic demand for road transport in relation to\nthe toll level, and (iii) high values attached to time savings for passengers and freight. ADB has\nundertaken a study to develop a toll traffic diversion model applicable to socioeconomic conditions\nprevailing in the PRC.44 This will help the Government introduce toll pricing policies that improve\ncost  recovery  and  transparency,  and  provide  adequate  incentives  to  attract  private  sector\ninvestment. The toll diversion manual has been translated into Chinese and is being distributed to\nPCDs.  Through  training,  further  consideration  will  be  given  to  toll  collection  methods  and  the\nintroduction of technologies that will reduce the transaction costs of toll collection for road users.\nADB\u2019s policy on expressway toll levels, incorporated in loan covenants for previous projects and\nthe  proposed Project,  requires  full  cost recovery including regular review of toll levels to ensure\nthe  recovery  of  operation  and  maintenance  costs  and  debt  service,  and  generation  of  an\nadditional  return  for  replacement  and  improvement  investments.  However,  toll  rate  levels\nestablished for new expressways also take into account the affordability for transport users (para.\n98).\n\n6.\n\nCorporatization and Commercialization\n\n50.\nThe  PRC's  move  to  a  market  economy  has  put  pressure  on  existing  expressway\norganizations and their staff to become commercially oriented and more efficient. Financing and\ncommercial business management practices could be improved. To support good governance in\nthe  subsector  and  the  institutional  development  of  expressway  organizations,  the  Government,\nwith  assistance  from  ADB  and  the  World  Bank,  is  pursuing  capacity-building  programs  to\nencourage commercialization and corporatization in all provinces. TA has been provided to help\nthe  Government  develop  institutional  capacity  to  promote  corporatization,  leasing,  and\nsecuritization45  in  the  road  sector  to  attract  private  sector  participation  in  the  construction,\n\n                  \n\n43 TA 5973-REG: Action Plans for Reducing Vehicle Emissions, for $900,000, approved on 26 September 2000.\n44 TA 3102-PRC: Preparing the Chongqing-Guizhou Expressway Project (Part 2): Toll Diversion Study, for $900,000,\n\n45 The term \"securitization\" refers to the process of raising funds through the issuance of either shares or bonds on\n\napproved on 26 November 1998.\n\nlocal or foreign stock exchanges and markets.\n\n\f17\n\nmanagement,  and  operation  of  bridges,  expressways,  and  other  roads  in  the  PRC.46  Through\nreview  of  practices  in  the  PRC  and  in  other  countries,  conduct  of  workshops  for  all  PRC\nprovinces,  and  development  of  case  studies,  the  TA  produced  documents  and  guidelines,  and\nmade recommendations. The main document produced is an investor\u2019s guide for infrastructure\ninvestment in the PRC, including (i) a toll roads investment and policy options model (TRIPO)\nand  its  user  manual;  (ii)  articles  of  associations,  founder\u2019s  agreement,  and  operation  and\nmanagement  agreement  for  corporatization;  (iii)  lease  and  concession  agreements;  and  (iv)\napproval procedures for corporatization, leasing, concessioning, and securitization of toll roads.\nThe  main  recommendations  of  the  TA  are  that  the  Government  should  (i)  prepare  a  new  law\nintegrating  all  existing  laws  (and  directives,  rules  and  regulations  from  various  ministries)\ndealing  with  toll  roads,  to  achieve  internal  consistency;  (ii)  examine  the  role  of  long-term  debt\nfinancing  for  toll  roads,  and  facilitate  access  for  PRC  companies  to  the  domestic  and\ninternational bond markets, on the same basis as for the securities equity market; (iii) combine\nroads  together  into  routes,  where  possible,  and  create  corporations  to  operate  the  routes;  (iv)\nconsider setting a target for new toll road companies wherein the PCD\u2019s ownership aims to be\nno  more  than  80  percent  of  the  outstanding  shares;  (v)  ensure  that  land  acquisition  costs  are\nadequately shared between public and private parties, and resettlement and land use certificate\nissues  are  adequately  addressed,  particularly  when  the  private  sector  is  involved;  (vi)  ensure\nthat  traffic  forecasts  are  realistic  and  conducted  by  independent  companies,  and  toll  setting  is\nflexible enough to be adjusted in relation to traffic; (vii) allow bundling of toll roads with nontolled\nroads under concession agreements to balance the perceived cost and utility of toll roads; (viii)\nestablish offices of investment support at national and provincial levels to help investors move\nthrough  the  approval  process  of  leasing  and  concessioning;  (ix)  consider  the  option  of  open\nbidding  for  future  lease  and  concession  agreements;  and  (x)  avoid  inflating  the  use  value  of\nassets  for  securitization  for  reasons  unrelated  to  the  commercial  use  of  the  roads.  These\nrecommendations are under discussion with the Government.\n\n51.\nGCD has agreed to establish the Guangxi Expressway Management Company (GEMC)\nsix  months  prior  to  the  expected  date  of  project  completion,  and  not  later  than  30  June  2004.\nGEMC is expected to be a state-owned corporation, with GCD as sole investor. GEMC will be\nresponsible \nfor  construction,  operation,  maintenance,  repair,  and  management  of  all\nexpressways  in  GZAR.  GEMC  will  obtain  all  finance  (equity  and  debt)  necessary  to  perform\nsuch activities. Before commencement of commercial operation, the project expressway will be\ntransferred to GEMC. GEMC will be entitled to collect and retain tolls in accordance with the toll\nstructure and will repay the loans contracted for the project expressway. Details on the creation\nof GEMC, and transfer of assets, revenues, and debt service obligations from GCD to GEMC,\nincluding GEMC\u2019s financial statements for the Project, will be submitted for ADB\u2019s approval six\nmonths  prior  to  GEMC  creation.  GEMC  will  develop  a  commercialization  program  with\nappropriate  accounting  and  management  information  systems,  and  will  introduce  commercial\nbusiness  practices  using  the  training  financed  under  the  Project.  Such  a  program  will  ensure\nautonomy  of  operations,  encourage  the  establishment  of  road  facility  performance  indicators,\nand facilitate future refinancing of road subsector assets.\n\n7.\n\nMobilizing Nongovernment Financing\n\n52.\nThe Government has taken a number of significant steps to mobilize domestic resources,\nincluding developing capital markets and transforming specialized banks into commercial banks.\nADB  has  provided  assistance  to  help  develop  the  PRC's  capital  markets,  and  made  a  major\n\n46 TA  2952-PRC: Corporatization, Leasing, and Securitization in the Road Sector,  for  $1.0  million,  approved  on  19\n\n                  \n\nDecember 1997.\n\n\f18\n\ncontribution to improving governance in the capital markets by supporting the drafting of the 1998\nSecurities  Law.47  The  Government  is  also  seeking  a  greater  role  for  private  sector  financing  in\nhighway  and  other  infrastructure  projects.  Apart  from  increasing  the  resources  available  for\nhighway development, the use of foreign direct investment would allow project risks to be spread\nover a large community of investors, and help improve the management efficiency and quality of\nhighway services. In the road subsector, ADB provided a TA48 to assess a broad range of financial\ninstruments  for  mobilizing  additional  domestic  and  international  funding  sources,  including  the\ndomestic  capital  markets.  ADB  also  provided  assistance  for  (i)  preparing  a  feasibility  study  on\nfinancing  a  road  project  using  a  BOT  scheme,  and  for  capacity  building  in  relation  to  BOT\nprocesses;49  and  (ii)  developing  institutional  capacity  to  promote  corporatization,  leasing,  and\nsecuritization  to  attract  private  sector  participation  in  the  road  sector  (para.  50).  Appendix  5\nsummarizes  options  available  for  mobilizing  nongovernment  financing  and  ADB\u2019s  investment  in\nprivate sector funds in the PRC.\n\n53.\nThe increasing infrastructure needs in the PRC require local governments to shift from\nthe  conventional  financing  modes  such  as  commercial  bank  loans,  international  or  bilateral\nloans, government grants, and export credits toward the capital markets. Initial public offerings\n(IPO)  of  expressway  companies  on  the  stock  exchange  have  demonstrated  that  such\ninvestments can be financially attractive under certain circumstances. Bond issues are another\nsuitable  tool  for  infrastructure  projects  owing  to  the  long-term  and  stable  earnings  stream  of\nsuch  projects.  Revenue  bond  issues  by  a  public  agency  that  owns  the  asset  have  an\nadvantage,  as  the  public  owns  the  facilities,  but  the  private  investors  finance  it.  However,  any\ncapital market instrument requires an adequate registration process and public disclosure, and\na  strong  credit  standing,  and  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  in  the  PRC  needs\nstrengthening. Expressway corporations may also consider leasing schemes, which would have\nconsiderable  potential  if  combined  with  tax  incentives  for  the  lessees.  ADB  helps  the\nGovernment  select  suitable  private  sector  financing  modalities  for  road  projects.  This  will\nultimately alleviate the burden on the final road users as well as the Government budget. These\ninstruments are, however, easier to use where traffic volume and income level are high, i.e., in\nthe coastal region and near major cities. They are not easy to use in the inland southwest and\ncentral regions, where traffic densities are low and the road network needs to be developed to\nsupport economic development.\n\n54.\nSix  months  prior  to  the  opening  of  the  project  facilities,  GCD,  through  GEMC,  will\nanalyze  the  feasibility  of  attracting  nongovernment  investment  funds  including  private  sector\nparticipation  in  the  operation,  maintenance,  and  management  of  the  project  road.  GCD  has\nalready  taken  two  private  sector  participation  initiatives:  a  joint  venture  agreement  with  Hong\nKong  Merchandise  Int'l  Ltd.  for  the  138  km  Guiliu  Expressway  for  a  total  investment  of  Y2.13\nbillion in May 1997; and a BOT agreement with China Huawen Development General Company\nfor the Liujing-Xingye section of the Nanning-Guangzhou Expressway for a total investment of\nY2.34 billion in December 2000.\n\n                  \n\n47 TA 3032-PRC: Legislative Drafting Support for the PRC Securities Law, for $150,000, approved on 24 June 1998;\nand TA 3304-PRC: Capacity Building of the Capital Markets Regulatory System, for $1.0 million, approved on 24\nNovember 1999.\n\n48 TA  2409-PRC: Appraisal Methodologies and Restructuring Highway Financing in Hebei Province,  for  $740,000,\n\n49 TA 2649-PRC: Facilitating Build-Operate-Transfer Modality in the Highway Sector, for $1.1 million, approved on 27\n\napproved on 28 September 1995.\n\nSeptember 1996.\n\n\f19\n\n IV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nADB's PRC country operational strategy supports the Government's policies in the road\n55.\nsector,  which  focus  on  building  roads  that  will  promote  economic  and  social  development\nparticularly in the poor areas of the country. GZAR, located in the southwest, is a poor interior\nprovince.  GZAR  had  around  15.2  million  rural  poor  by  the  end  of  2000,  using  a  rural  income\nlevel  of  Y1,000  per  capita  per  annum,50  accounting  for  about  32  percent  of  the  total  GZAR\npopulation  of  47.6  million.  In  terms  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  per  capita,  GZAR  is  the\nfourth poorest of the PRC's 31 provinces. In 2000, the average GDP per capita in GZAR was\nY4,285,  about  two  thirds  of  the  national  average.  Since  1980,  the  average  annual  economic\ngrowth in GZAR, 9.2 percent, has been slightly lower than the national average of 10.1 percent.\nLack  of  transport  infrastructure  is  one  of  the  factors  contributing  to  the  depressed  economic\nconditions. As a result of ADB\u2019s policy dialogue, the scope of the Project has been expanded to\nstrengthen  its  development  impact  by  adding  a  program  of  complementary  road  upgrading  to\nimprove the local road network and access of poor communities in the project area.\n\n56.\nThe proposed Project is a NTHS connector link from the Viet Nam's National Highway 1\nto the NTHS corridor 40 linking Chongqing Municipality via Guiyang, in Guizhou Province, and\nNanning to Zhanjiang, in Guangdong Province, and to the NTHS corridor 75 from Kunming in\nYunnan Province to Hengyang, in Hunan Province (Map 1). The Project will also connect to the\nNanning-Guilin  Expressway,  a  major  link  to  Hunan  Province  and,  via  the  Nanning-Wuxhou\nExpressway (to open in 2005), to Guangdong Province.\n\n57.\nThe  proposed  Project  will  facilitate  regional  cooperation  between  the  PRC,  Viet  Nam,\nand  other  countries  of  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS).  The  project  road  will  improve\naccessibility  between  Nanning  (GZAR's  capital)  and  the  Viet  Nam  border,  while  another  ADB-\nfinanced  road  project51  is  improving  accessibility  between  the  border  and  Hanoi,  Viet  Nam\u2019s\ncapital.  Connection  between  Hanoi  and  neighboring  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  and\nCambodia,  and  Thailand,  will  be  improved  by  the  ongoing  GMS  road  program.  Improving\nphysical  links  between  the  PRC,  Viet  Nam,  and  other  GMS  countries  will  catalyze  the\nconclusion  of  agreements  to  harmonize  and  simplify  procedures  governing  the  movement  of\npeople, goods, and vehicles across national boundaries.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n58.\nThe proposed Project will promote sustainable economic growth, and, thus, contribute to\npoverty reduction, by improving economic efficiency and reducing the cost of road transport in\nthe southwestern region of GZAR. The Project will relieve traffic congestion and bottlenecks on\na  key  section  of  the  existing  road,  National  Highway  322  (NH  322),  a  link  of  the  NTHS,  and\nprovide  better  access  to  growth  centers  for  poor  communities  through  the  inclusion  of  a\ncomplementary program of local road upgrading in the project scope. Specifically the proposed\nProject  will  (i)  provide  additional  transport  capacity,  alleviate  congestion,  and  reduce  traffic\naccidents  and  vehicle  operating  costs;  (ii)  improve  access  for  the  poor  rural  population  in  the\ntransport corridor; and (iii) facilitate regional cooperation by providing better access from GZAR\nand other PRC provinces to Viet Nam and the road network of the GMS. The proposed Project\n\n                  \n\n50 Using the same income level, the national rural poverty incidence is 12 percent.\n51 Loan 1487-VN: Second Road Improvement Project, for $120 million, approved on 21 November 1996.\n\n\f20\n\nwill  also  support  sector  reforms  initiated  under  ongoing  ADB-financed  projects  and  regional\ninitiatives.\n\n59.\n\nThe scope of the Project includes:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\nconstruction of 136 km of four-lane access-controlled tollway from Nanning (Wuxu)\nto  Ningming,  43  km  of  four-lane  class  I  road  from  Ningming  to  Youyiguan  at  the\nViet Nam border, and 49 km of class II connector roads between the project road\nand  major  towns,  including  interchanges  with  toll  stations,  bridges,  administrative\nstations,  service  areas,  and  improvement  of  about  100  km  of  access  roads  to\naffected villages along the project road alignment;\nupgrading  of  about  507  km52  of  complementary  county  and  village  roads  to\nimprove the local road network and the access to poor areas;\nprocurement  of  equipment  for  road  maintenance,  toll  collection,  surveillance  and\ncommunications, vehicle axle load testing, road safety, and office administration;\nland acquisition and resettlement; and\nconsulting  services  for  construction  supervision,  monitoring,  and  evaluation,  and\nin-country and international training for capacity building.\n\nC.\n\nTechnical Justification\n\n60.\nGZAR  has  a  land  area  of  236,661  square  kilometers,  62  percent  of  which  is\nmountainous.  The  existing  NH  322,  a  single  carriageway  two-lane  highway  is  the  only  road\nlinking  Nanning,  GZAR\u2019s  Capital  City,  to  Youyiguan  at  the  Viet  Nam  border.  The  proposed\nProject will start on a new expressway that was completed in October 2000 between Nanning\nand  Wuxu,  to  connect  Nanning  to  its  airport.  The  new  expressway  has  a  different  alignment\nfrom the 25 km Nanning-Wuxu section of NH 322, which follows class II highway standards. A\n14  km  section  close  to  Pingxiang  City  and  a  5  km  section  east  of  Ningming  City  were  also\nupgraded  to  class  II  highway  standards.  All  other  sections  of  NH  322  between  Wuxu  and\nYouyiguan  follow  class  III-IV  highway  standards.  The  technical  standards  of  these  sections  of\nthe road are low, grades are steep, especially close to Ningming and the border, and there are\nmany  sharp  curves.  Passing  sight  distance  is  poor  over  much  of  the  road\u2019s  length  leading  to\nmany  accidents  (2,255  accidents,  with  431  fatalities,  recorded  on  NH  322  in  2000).  The  road\nnetwork that radiates from NH 322 and the provincial roads in the hinterland served by Project is\nlimited, generally of low standard, and largely unsealed.\n\nMost of road sections have reached their capacity, which is low, ranging between 1,500\n61.\nmedium truck equivalent units (MTE) and 6,000 MTE per day depending on road class. Travel\ntime along the road is highly variable. Passenger cars take about 5 hours to cover the 220 km\nbetween Nanning and Youyiguan, and trucks and large buses take longer. As the traffic on the\nroad is near or exceeds capacity, travel times will increase rapidly with further increase in traffic\nover  the  next  few  years.  From  an  average  of  3,200  MTE  per  day  in  1998,  the  traffic  between\nNanning  and  Youyiguan  is  forecast  to  reach  an  average  of  6,800  MTE  per  day  in  2005,\nequivalent to an annual growth rate of 11.3 percent, and 20,800 MTE in 2025, equivalent to an\naverage annual growth rate of 5.8 percent between 2005 and 2025 (Appendix 6). The existing\nNH 322 will not be able to safely and efficiently carry the forecast traffic from 2005. A new road\nfollowing  a  new  alignment  must  be  constructed  to  accommodate  the  expected  traffic  and\nsupport  continued  economic  development  of  the  area.  While  expressway  standards  will  be\n\n52  Construction of a further 471 km of complementary roads has started in 2000 and will be completed by the end of\n\n                  \n\n2001.\n\n\f21\n\nadopted  for  the  Wuxu-Ningming  section,  class  I  highway  standards  will  be  used  for  the\nNingming-Youyiguan  section  in  view  of  the  lower  traffic  forecast  and  the  hilly  terrain.  In  this\nreport, the term \u201cexpressway\u201d is used for the whole alignment including expressway and class I\nhighway sections.\n\n62.\nNH  322  is  not  near  the  major  county  towns  in  the  project  area,  which  have  developed\nclose to the railway. The proposed alignment is the logical route to serve these towns in addition\nto those on NH 322. Alternative alignments were considered for sections of the proposed road\nin consultation with local governments and local communities. The final alignment was selected\nbased on overall length, ease of construction, and minimization of adverse environmental and\nsocial impacts, including protection of cultural and historic sites. The new road is being designed\nin accordance with MOC standards.\n\n63.\nThe complementary road program was prepared in consultation with local communities to\nimprove the local road network and access of the poor communities to the expressway in the five\ncounties  where  poverty  incidence  was  the  highest  (Map  2).  This  program  will  be  implemented\nconcurrently with the expressway. In addition to 471 km of village roads for which improvement\nworks  have already started, about 507 km of county and village roads will be improved under\nthe Project, including (i) upgrading of 283 km of county roads and 7 km of village roads to class\nIII  highway  standards;  (ii)  upgrading  of  54  km  of  county  roads  and  111  km  of  village  roads  to\npaved  class  IV  highway  standards;  and  (iii)  upgrading  of  52  km  of  village  roads  to  unpaved\nclass IV highway standards. Road links were prioritized using an analysis that took account of\neconomic and social benefits, availability of funds, and road network efficiency (Appendix 7).\n\nD.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n64.\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies  and  interest\nduring  construction,  is  estimated  at  $455.2  million  equivalent,  of  which  $193.2  million  (42.4\npercent) is in foreign exchange and $262.0 million equivalent (57.6 percent) is in local currency.\nThe cost estimates are summarized in Table 1.\n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nItem\nA.

The  proposed  ADB  loan  will\nfinance  77.6  percent  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  of  the  Project.  The  proposed  EIB  loan  will\nfinance 11.0 percent of the total cost, including foreign exchange and local currency costs. The\nChina Development Bank (CDB) will provide domestic cofinancing of $60.4 million equivalent, to\ncover 23.1 percent of the local currency cost of the Project.

GCD will bear interest rate variation and foreign exchange risks on the loan.\n\n67.\nThe proposed EIB loan will be provided as parallel financing to the ADB loan to finance\nthe  class  I  road  section  from  Ningming  to  Youyiguan.  The  conditions  of  the  EIB  loan  will  be\nagreed between EIB and the Government. The EIB loan will have a maturity of 20 years including\na grace period of 5 years. No front-end fee or commitment charges will be applied. Interest during\nconstruction will be paid directly by the Government to EIB.\n\n68.\nThe CDB loan will be repayable over a period of 17 years, including a grace period of 4\nyears,  and  at  an  interest  rate  of  6.2  percent  per  annum.  The  Government  contribution  to  the\nProject  will  include  a  grant  from  MOC  of  $101.0  million  equivalent.  GCD\u2019s  contribution  to  the\nProject will be a grant of $99.2 million equivalent from its construction fund.\n\n\fF.\n\nThe Executing Agency\n\n23\n\n69.\nGCD  will  be  the  EA  for  the  Project.  GCD  has  completed  its  reorganization  and\nrestructuring in 2000, which resulted in reduction of its staff and separation of most enterprises\ninitially  under  GCD,  which  are  now  independent  companies.  GCD  has  only  about  50  staff\ndirectly  employed  in  the  department.  In  addition  about  1,600  people  are  employed  in  several\nrelated bureaus, institutes, and other agencies. This does not include the staff employed in the\nprefecture  and  municipal  communication  bureaus  (Appendix  9).  GCD  has  satisfactorily\nimplemented  one  ADB-financed  transport  project53  and  one  World  Bank-financed  inland\nwaterway project, and recently started implementing a World Bank-financed road project. GCD\nhas the capability to implement the Project, provided that it receives adequate support from the\nconstruction  supervision  consultants  and  ADB  review  missions.  After  GEMC  is  established\n(para. 51), the project facilities and GCD's responsibilities for the Project will be transferred from\nGCD to GEMC, after receiving ADB\u2019s concurrence on the proposed arrangements.\n\nG.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nManagement and Organization\n\n70.\nGCD  has  established  a  project  management  unit  (PMU)  to  coordinate  and  monitor  all\nproject  activities.  The  PMU  is  headed  by  a  Deputy  Director  of  GCD,  and  comprises  9\nmanagement  staff,  including  a  Project  Coordinator.  The  PMU  is  responsible  for  recruitment  of\nsupervision  consultants,  training,  and  international  procurement.  All  activities  related  to  the\nconstruction of the project expressway are the responsibility of a construction office comprising\n5 headquarters divisions (contract management, environment and resettlement, administration,\nfinancial, and human resources). The complementary road program will be implemented by the\ncounty  communication  bureaus,  under \nthe  Nanning  Prefecture\nCommunications  Bureau.  To  facilitate  land  acquisition,  resettlement,  and  environmental\nprotection  measures,  and  to  ensure  that  local  concerns  are  adequately  addressed,  project\nimplementation  committees,  consisting  of  officials  from  local  governments  and  various  local\nagencies, have been established in the counties along the project roads, i.e. Chongzuo, Fusui,\nLongzhou, Ningming, Pingxiang, and Yongning.\n\nthe  supervision  of \n\n2.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n71.\nPreconstruction activities of ADB-financed works, such as detailed design, preparation of\ntendering,  and  award  of  contracts\nbidding  documents,  prequalification  of  contractors, \ncommenced  in  March  2001  and  should  be  completed  by  the  end  of  January  2002.  However\nbecause  of  the  shorter  EIB  procurement  process,  EIB-financed  works  will  be  ready  to  start\nearlier.  Overall  project  construction  is  therefore  scheduled  to  start  in  late  December  2001  and\ntake  about  40  months,  the  anticipated  completion  date  being  the  end  of  April  2005.\nImplementation  of  the  complementary  road  program  will  be  concurrent  with  expressway\nconstruction. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 10.\n\n3.\n\nProcurement\n\n72.\nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with\nthe ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. All civil works contracts will be awarded on the basis of\n\n53  Loan 1427-PRC: Fangcheng Port, for $52 million, approved on 18 January 1996. The project also included a road\n\n                  \n\ncomponent for access to the port.\n\n\f24\n\ninternational competitive bidding (ICB) procedure. Supply contracts estimated to cost more than\n$500,000 will also be awarded under ICB. Supply contracts estimated to cost $500,000 or less\nwill  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international  shopping  and  those  costing  $100,000  or  less  by\ndirect  purchase  procedures.  Local  competitive  bidding  procedures  will  not  be  used.\nProcurement  under  ICB  and  international  shopping  procedures,  including  prequalification,\ntendering, and bid evaluation, will be carried out with the assistance of the China International\nTendering  Company.  This  company  has  relevant  experience  gained  under  other  externally\nfinanced projects, including those of ADB and the World Bank. Procurement for ADB financing\nwill include 12 packages of civil works to be procured under ICB procedures, and 13 packages\nof  equipment  under  ICB/international  shopping/direct  purchase  procedures.  EIB  will  finance  3\npackages  of  civil  works  to  be  procured  under  ICB  procedures.  Prequalified  contractors  with\nadequate  technical  and  financial  capacities  will  be  allowed  to  bid  on  several  packages  and,  if\nsuccessful,  may  be  awarded  more  than  one  contract  based  on  least  cost  combination  of\ncontracts. The detailed contract packages are in Appendix 11.\n\n4.\n\nConsulting Services \n\n73.\n  Eight  resident  supervision  engineer  offices,  staffed  with  domestic  consulting  firms\nselected  by  GCD,  will  directly  supervise  construction  works  in  the  field.  Overall  project\nsupervision will be under the responsibility of the Chief Supervision Engineer Office (CSEO), to\nwhich  the  international  consultants  will  be  fully  integrated.  A  chief  supervision  engineer  (CSE)\nand  two  deputy  chief  supervision  engineers  (DCSEs)  will  head  the  CSEO.  One  DCSE  will  be\nthe team leader of the international consultants and will assist the CSE in project and contract\nmanagement  activities,  and  certify  contractor\u2019s  progress  payment  certificates  and  contract\nvariations prior to their approval by the CSE. Other international experts will provide short-term\nassistance  to  the  CSEO  on  earthworks,  mechanical  and  electrical  equipment,  tunnel\nconstruction, traffic safety, and other technical issues.\n\nGCD will select individual domestic consultants to staff the CSEO, and nominate the chiefs\n74.\nof  the  main  units  of  the  CSEO,  i.e.,  the  supervision  division,  measurement  office,  and  central\nlaboratory.  Three  individual  domestic  consultants  recruited  as  deputy  chiefs  of  these  units  will\nhave  the  special  duty  to  assist  the  team  of  international  consultants.  They  will  be  a  qualified\ncontract management specialist (supervision division), quantity engineer (measurement office),\nand  quality  control  specialist  (central  laboratory),  fluent  in  English.  The  terms  of  reference\n(TORs) of these three positions will be submitted to ADB for concurrence prior to selection; the\nbiodatas  of  the  selected  candidates  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  concurrence  prior  to  their\nrecruitment;  and  GCD  will  confirm  to  ADB  the  recruitment  of  the  selected  candidates.  If  the\nselected  domestic  consultants  cannot  satisfy  the  requirements  of  their  TORs,  GCD  will  find\ninternationally recruited consultants to fill these positions.\n\nIn  addition  to  international  consultants  for  construction  supervision,  international\n75.\nspecialists  will  provide  inputs  in  resettlement  monitoring  and  evaluation,  project  performance\nmanagement systems, training, and other topics as required. A total of about 60 person-months\nof  consultants  from  an  international  consulting  company  will  be  required  for  international\nconsulting  services.  International  consultants  will  be  financed  under  the  loan,  and  recruited  by\nGCD in accordance with ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Construction supervision\nwill  require  about  4,900  person-months  of  professional  domestic  consultants.54  Domestic\n\n54  It also includes about 3,900 person-months of technical support staff, for a total of about 8,800 person-months of\n\n                  \n\nhired domestic technical services.\n\n\f25\n\nconsultants will be financed by GCD and recruited in accordance with local procedures that are\nsatisfactory to ADB.\n\n5. \n\nAdvance Recruitment and Procurement Actions\n\n76.\nDuring  project  processing,  the  Government  requested  ADB\u2019s  approval  for  advance\naction  to  expedite  the  recruitment  of  consultants  and  procurement  for  civil  works.  Advance\nprocurement  action  was  approved  on  4  April  2001  and  covers  prequalification  of  contractors,\ntendering, and bid evaluation for the civil works contract packages, but does not include signing\nof contracts. Advance recruitment action was approved on 1 June 2001, and covers selection of\ninternational  consultants,  up  to  but  not  including  signing  of  the  contract.  The  Government  and\nGCD  have  been  advised  that  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  advance  actions  does  not  commit  ADB  to\nfinance the Project.\n\n6. \n\nMidterm Review\n\nIn  2003,  ADB  and  GCD  will  carry  out  a  midterm  review  of  the  Project,  focusing  on  all\n77.\npolicy,  institutional,  administrative,  organizational,  technical,  environmental,  social,  economic,\nfinancial, and other relevant aspects that may have an impact on the performance of the Project\nand its continuing viability. The review will (i) examine the progress in implementing subsector\nreforms, policy development, progress in resettlement, and compliance with assurances in the\nLoan  Agreement;  and  (ii)  consider  complementary  activities  to  enhance  the  poverty  impact\nduring operations.\n\n7.\n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement\n\n78.\n A resettlement plan was prepared by the Xi\u2019an Highway University for GCD in February\n2000 and revised with the assistance of the TA consultant. The resettlement plan was finalized\nat  loan  appraisal  based  on  the  preliminary  technical  design  of  the  Project.  Appendix  12\nsummarizes  the  resettlement  plan.  The  Project  will  result  in  loss  of  land,  houses,  and  other\nassets  due  to  the  expressway  construction.  An  estimated  31,000  people  will  be  affected,  less\nthan  10,000  of  whom  need  economic  rehabilitation.  Of  these,  1,130  will  have  their  housing\nrelocated. Those losing land will be compensated, through their economic collectives, under the\n1998  Land  Administration  Law  and  the  provincial  guidelines,  which  set  out  the  procedures,\ncompensation rates, and resettlement subsidies, for acquisition of land. The Project will result in\npermanent  land  acquisition  of  nearly  1,200  hectares  (ha),  plus  about  190  ha  of  temporarily\nborrowed  land  for  construction  purposes.  Those  losing  housing  will  receive  compensation\ndirectly  and  a  replacement  house  site,  with  vulnerable  households  receiving  assistance  to\nreplace  their  houses.  Those  losing  other  assets,  such  as  crops,  trees,  sheds,  and  other\nstructures,  will  be  compensated  directly  for  their  losses.  People  whose  land  will  be  borrowed\ntemporarily  will  be  compensated  for  the  loss  of  production.  The  initial  land  acquisition  and\nresettlement budget, estimated at about $38.8 million equivalent, is included in the project cost\nestimates.\n\nGCD  will  fund  the  resettlement  costs  according  to  the  standards  set  out  in  the\n79.\nresettlement  plan.  Compensation  will  be  paid  for  housing  and  new  housing  will  be  made\navailable before relocation takes place. The 1998 Land Administration Law, which was drafted\nwith  ADB  assistance,55  provides  for  disclosure  of  information  and  consultation  with  people\naffected.  The  summary  of  the  resettlement  plan,  together  with  provincial  compensation  rates,\n\n55 TA 2735-PRC: Capacity Building for Natural Resources Legislation, for $800,000, approved on 24 December 1996.\n\n                  \n\n\f26\n\nhas  been  distributed  to  county  and  township  offices  in  early  April  2001,  to  be  disclosed  to\naffected people through village collectives. Disclosed resettlement information includes a broad\nsummary  of  the  scope  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  rates  for  compensation  and  other\nassistance, the grievance mechanism, and intended time frame. To date, no adverse response\nhas  been  received.  During  appraisal,  an  ADB  mission  conducted  a  training  workshop  on\nresettlement  policy  and  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan  for  the  resettlement  staff  of  the\nPMU  and  selected  county  resettlement  staff,  to  facilitate  the  smooth  implementation  of  the\nresettlement  plan.  GCD  will  monitor  the  resettlement  process  and  submit  quarterly  reports  to\nADB. A regular reporting system has been established to ensure key resettlement activities are\nimplemented  on  time.  GCD  will  engage  a  qualified  local  institute  to  provide  independent\nmonitoring  of  the  resettlement  process.  Further  surveys  will  be  done  on  completion  of  the\nresettlement, and one and two years after Project completion, and the findings will be reported\nto GCD and ADB.\n\n8.\n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit\n\nThe Government has agreed that, as in previous ADB-financed projects, arrangements\n80.\nsatisfactory  to  ADB  will  be  made  for  reporting  the  progress  of  Project  implementation.  In  this\nregard, GCD will submit to ADB quarterly progress reports in such form and detail as ADB may\nrequest,  and  brief  monthly  updates.  To  facilitate  postevaluation  of  the  Project,  GCD  will  also\nfurnish  ADB,  within  three  months  of  project  completion,  a  project  completion  report  providing\ndetails  regarding  physical  implementation,  project  costs,  recruitment  and  performance  of\nconsultants,  procurement  of  goods  and  civil  works,  performance  of  suppliers  and  contractors,\nsocial  and  environmental  impacts,  project  financial  and  economic  performance,  and  other\ndetails  as  requested  by  ADB.  In  addition,  GCD  will  provide  to  ADB  reports  on  contract\nmanagement  procedures  (including  approval  of  variations  orders  and  progress  payment\ncertificates),  forecast  traffic  volumes  and  proposed  toll  tariff  increases,  benefit  monitoring,  and\nother activities within the required time as stipulated in the loan and project agreements.\n\n81.\nGCD  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project  and  related  financial  statements,\nsuch as statements of sources and application of funds, implementation of the loan agreement,\nand  income  and  expenses.  The  accounts  will  be  started  on  commencement  of  toll  operation,\nand audited annually. After its establishment, GEMC (para. 51) will also prepare such separate\nstatements plus an overall balance sheet. GMEC will prepare one set of financial statements for\nthe  Project  and  another  for  consolidated  accounts,  and  have  both  sets  audited  annually.  The\naudit  will  be  in  accordance  with  appropriate  auditing  standards  consistently  applied,  by\nindependent auditors, whose qualifications, experience and TOR are acceptable to ADB. GCD\nwill submit to ADB within nine months of the end of each related fiscal year, certified copies of\naudited project accounts and financial statements and an auditor\u2019s report for the Project, all in\nthe  English  language.  ADB  reminded  the  Government  of  its  stringent  requirements  for  timely\nsubmission of audited project accounts and financial statements, and that noncompliance with\nthe  requirements  may  result  in  the  suspension  of  loan  disbursements.  During  the  midterm\nreview  in  2003,  financial  projections  of  GEMC  for  the  next  five  years  should  be  submitted  to\nADB for its review and such projections should be updated annually thereafter.\n\n9.\n\nProject Performance Management System\n\n82.\nA  set  of  indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluating  the  performance  of  the  Project  in\nrelation to its goals and objectives has been agreed with GCD. Prior to project implementation,\nGCD  will  establish  the  necessary  baseline  values  for  impact  indicators.  These  values  will  be\nupdated during project implementation. Specific indicators will be measured, with the necessary\n\n\f27\n\nfrequency, during project construction. Comments and findings regarding project impact will be\nincorporated  in  every  second  ADB  quarterly  report.  Indicators  for  project  evaluation  will  be\nmeasured at project completion and annually for three years after completion. Where relevant,\nindicators  will  be  disaggregated  by  gender.  To  facilitate  assessment  of  the  socioeconomic\nlocal\nimpact  of \ninstitute/consultants to monitor and evaluate all relevant project effects, have been included in\nthe scope of consulting services to be provided under the Project.\n\ninternational  consultant  and \n\nfor  services  of  an \n\nthe  Project,  TOR \n\n10.\n\nAnticorruption Measures\n\n83.\nDuring project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to central and local\ngovernment officials. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption that was added\nto ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, particularly the\nneed  for  bidders,  suppliers,  contractors,  and  consultants  to  observe  the  highest  standards  of\nethics in the procurement and execution of ADB-financed contracts, and the sanctions if fraud\nand  corruption  are  discovered.  ADB's  program  for  the  PRC  includes  assistance  to  the\nGovernment  that  will  improve  governance  and  provide  incentives  to  reduce  the  incidence  of\ncorruption  in  the  longer  term.  In  1998,  ADB  TA  helped  the  Government  to  develop  detailed\nguidelines  for  the  selection  and  engagement  of  consultants,56  to  increase  transparency,  take\naccount  of  the  principles  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy,  and  provide  for  equal  opportunity\ncompetition.  The  resulting  draft  guidelines  were  well  received  by  the  Government.  ADB  is\nproviding  assistance  to  strengthen  the  Government's  auditing  system  to  conform  with  the\nrequirements of the Audit Law and, as far as practicable, international auditing standards by (i)\nformulating government auditing standards and procedures, and (ii) designing and implementing\nan audit training program to promote full and consistent adherence to such auditing standards\nand procedures by government auditors.57 This work will strengthen the Government's ability to\ndetect  fraud  and  corruption.  ADB  has  also  provided  assistance  for  establishment  of  national\nprocurement  regulations,  implementation  of  the  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law  and  related\nregulations, and formulation of the Government Procurement Law (footnotes 35 and 36). These\nlaws  and  regulations  will  help  ensure  transparency  in  the  procurement  process  and  reduce\ncorruption.  In  line  with  these  national  developments,  GCD  has  established  an  anticorruption\nsystem by preparing specific programs and targets, and organizing training and workshops.\n\n11. \n\nCapacity Building and Human Resource Development\n\n84.\nThe international consultants for construction supervision will provide on-the-job training\nfor  about  100  GCD  staff  and  domestic  consultants  in  construction  supervision,  quality  control,\nand  contract  management.  In  addition,  domestic  consultants  will  provide  training  to  GCD  and\nGEMC staff in a variety of subjects, including financial management, resettlement policies and\nimplementation, environmental protection and monitoring, construction supervision, road safety,\nand road maintenance. Some of the training sessions may also require the participation of the\ninternational consultants for construction supervision.\n\n85.\nAbout  46  person-months  of  international  training  will  be  financed  under  the  loan.  The\ninternational consultants for construction supervision will help GCD organize 16 person-months of\ninternational training in construction supervision training, but will not provide the training services,\nunless requested by GCD during contract negotiations. About 30 person-months of international\n\n                  \n\nDecember 1998.\n\n56  TA  3138-PRC:  Regulatory  Framework  for  the  Engagement  of  Consultants,  for  $700,000,  approved  on  22\n\n57  TA 3103-PRC: Strengthening the Government Auditing System, for $700,000, approved on 26 November 1998.\n\n\f28\n\ntheir \n\ninstitutional  capability \n\ntraining  programs  will  aim  at  developing  the  human  resources  of  GCD  and  GEMC  and\nstrengthening \nin  highway  management,  human  resources\ndevelopment,  international  procurement  and  contract  management,  quality  control,  and  road\noperation and maintenance. The EA will prepare for ADB\u2019s concurrence an international training\nplan including a program of courses and lists of candidates to be trained. Language training will\nbe  provided  to  the  trainees,  if  necessary.  Each  trainee  will  be  required  to  submit  a  report  on\ntraining received and make a presentation to the employer agency.\n\nH.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironmental Measures\n\nThe  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  A.  The  environmental  impact\n86.\nassessment (EIA) was prepared by Xi\u2019an Highway University on behalf of the Government, and\nwas approved by the State Environmental Protection Administration on 22 January 2001. Public\nconsultations  were  conducted  between  June  1998  and  September  1999  (Appendix  13).  The\noverall  conclusion  of  the  EIA,  which  was  confirmed  during  project  processing,  was  that  the\nadverse environmental impacts arising from the construction and operation of the project facilities\ncan  be  mitigated  to  acceptable  levels.  A  summary  EIA  of  the  Project  was  circulated  to  ADB's\nBoard  on  2  May  2001,  and  put  on  the  ADB  web  page.  The  Chinese  version  of  the  EIA  will  be\nprovided in the Project\u2019s field offices for reference by the public and other interested parties.\n\n87.\nAdverse  environmental  impacts  were  minimized  by  the  selection  of  appropriate\nalignment. The EIA further assesses the environmental impacts of the selected alignment and\nprescribes  environmental  protection  and  mitigation  measures.  Environmental  impacts  and\nmitigation  measures  are  summarized  in  Appendix  4  of  the  summary  EIA.  The  environmental\nprotection  and  mitigation  measures  are  estimated  to  cost  Y30.2  million  equivalent,  including\nY29.1 million of capital costs that are included in the project cost estimates. The environmental\nmitigation  measures  will  be  incorporated  in  the  bid  documents  and  bill  of  quantities  of  the  civil\nwork  contracts.  Monitoring  will  be  undertaken  to  ensure  that  environmental  impacts  will  be\nminimized  to  acceptable  levels,  and  meet  ADB's  environmental  requirements,  and  the\nGovernment\u2019s  environmental  standards.  Domestic  environment  consultants  will  be  recruited\nthe\nunder \nimplementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan,  monitor  the  environmental  and  social\nimpacts, and prepare related reports.\n\nthe  construction  supervision  consulting  services \n\nto  prepare  and  supervise \n\nThe road alignment will not pass through primary forests or other ecologically sensitive\n88.\nareas. However, to comply with the PRC's forestry law and ADB's forestry policy, GCD agreed\nto mitigate affected plantation forest areas by compensatory planting of an equivalent or larger\narea.  The  planting  program  will  be  implemented  in  coordination  with  the  GZAR  Forestry\nDepartment.\n\n89.\nThe EIA identified the white-headed leaf monkey, a critically endangered species, in the\nproject area, i.e., in Longling (Bapen) Nature Reserve in Fusui County, Lobai Nature Reserve in\nChongzuo County, and in Longrui Nature Reserve, which is part of the larger Nonggang Nature\nReserve  in  Ningming  and  Langzuo  counties.  The  project  processing  ADB  missions  confirmed\nEIA  findings  that  the  Project  is  unlikely  to  cause  significant  environmental  impacts.  Economic\ndevelopment in southern GZAR may bring adverse environmental impact on natural resources if\nprecaution  is  not  taken.  Considering  the  critical  population  of  the  white-headed  leaf  monkey,\nwhich  has  received  international  attention,  ADB  recommended  that  the  GZAR  government\naddress the possible environmental impact by preparing a comprehensive management plan of\n\n\f29\n\nthe three nature reserves. An advisory TA was included in the 2001 TA program for the PRC to\nhelp the GZAR government prepare this management plan.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Analysis\n\na.\n\nOverall Impact\n\n90.\nKey  issues  were  identified  in  the  initial  social  assessment  carried  out  during  TA  fact-\nfinding  in  March  1999  (footnote  1)  and  assessed  in  detail  during  the  social  analysis  and\nfeasibility  study.  The  key  issues  included  reducing  the  adverse  impacts  associated  with\nresettlement  and  maximizing  the  poverty  reduction  impact  of  the  Project.  The  social  analysis\nexamined  the  broader  trends  in  the  project  area,  and  the  needs  of  affected  people  and  their\nability to benefit from the Project. Public consultations were also held to ascertain the support of\nthe  residents  for  the  Project  (Appendix  13).  A  summary  of  the  social  and  poverty  impact\nanalysis is in Appendix 14.\n\nThe project area mainly covers five counties between Nanning City and the Viet Namese\n91.\nborder.  These  counties  have  a  total  population  of  around  1.6  million,  of  whom  less  than  20\npercent  live  in  urban  areas.  The  Project  will  directly  benefit  most  of  the  population  of  the\ncounties of the project area, but also indirectly benefit a large share of the GZAR population of\n47.6 million through economic development induced by improvement of the road network. The\ndominant minority, the Zhuang, makes up over 80 percent of the total population of the project\narea.  Several  measures  were  recommended  in  the  social  analysis  to  maximize  the  poverty\nreduction impact and to mitigate the possible adverse impact of the Project. GCD will implement\nall recommendations listed in Appendix 14.\n\n92.\n  In  addition,  and  to  maximize  the  poverty  reduction  impact  of  the  Project,  (i)  all  roads\nfinanced by GCD under the Project will use wage labor, with wages set at market rates; and (ii)\nconstruction  companies  involved  in  civil  works  for  the  expressway  will  hire  as  much  labor  as\npossible  from  poor  villages.  Labor  teams  will  be  identified  though  the  Poverty  Alleviation  and\nDevelopment  Office  (PADO),  the  All-China  Women\u2019s  Federation  (WF),  and  the  Labor\nDepartment.  The  PADO  and  the  WF  will  identify  appropriate  team  leaders  in  poor  natural\nvillages  in  the  Project  area  and  train  them  as  necessary.  The  team  leaders  will  then  select  a\nlabor  team  from  poor  households  in  their  natural  villages.  The  county  government,  the  Labor\nDepartment, PADO, and WF will coordinate the signing of the contracts between the contractors\nand the team leaders from poor villages.\n\n93.\nThe  social  impact  of  the  project  in  its  entirety  will  be  generally  beneficial.  The  social\nanalysis  indicates  the  following:  (i)  the  largest  beneficiary  group  will  be  the  farmers,  although\nmost of the easily quantifiable benefits will accrue to road users; (ii) many farmers, particularly\nthose  on  the  complementary  road  program  schemes,  but  also  those  near  the  expressway\ninterchanges,  will  be  in  a  position  to  increase  their  agricultural  production  through  improved\naccess  to  markets  and  cheaper  transport  costs;  (iii)  farmers  in  settlements  served  by  the\ncomplementary road schemes will have improved access to education and health facilities and\nincreased information flows and interaction with the outside world; (iv) the expressway is likely\nto provide opportunities for construction employment, some permanent employment, revenues\nfrom the sale of construction materials, and trading and service activities in the service areas;\n(v) the Project will benefit most of the poor in the project area, with direct benefits arising mainly\nfrom the complementary road program rather than from the expressway, the impact of which will\nbe felt over a longer term; (vi) disbenefits will arise from resettlement and land acquisition, but\nwill  be  mitigated  by  compensation  payments  and  replacement  houses  as  per  the  resettlement\n\n\f30\n\nplan; and (vii) health risks could increase due to infectious diseases and potential crossborder\nHIV/AIDS  transmission,  but  will  be  mitigated  by  distribution  of  targeted  information,  education,\nand communication during and after construction.\n\n94.\nThe  population  of  the  Project  area  is  dominated  by  the  Zhuang  ethnic  group.  Because\nthe Zhuang are fully assimilated into the mainstream economy, their cultural identity will not be\nadversely affected by the Project.\n\nb. \n\nImpact on Minorities\n\nc.\n\nGender Issues\n\n95. Women  participate  fully  in  the  rural  economy  and  frequently  engage  in  small-scale\ntrading. They are however underrepresented as drivers and long-distance traders, in the public\nsector, and in the management of enterprises. The impacts on farmers therefore apply equally\nto  women.  The  complementary  road  program  will  help  women  expand  livestock  rearing  and\nother small-scale retail activities, and improve agriculture in general. Although 15 percent of the\nconstruction  employment  will  go  to  women,  they  will  be  given  equal  opportunities  and  pay  for\nconstruction  and  operational  jobs,  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and\nDevelopment.\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA.\n\nFinancial and Economic Analysis\n\n1.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n96.\nAn economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated based on a comparison of the\nwith-  and  without-project  situations  (Appendix  15).  The  economic  costs  of  the  project  roads\ninclude  the  resource  costs  for  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance,  and  the  value  of\nagricultural  production  from  land  lost  permanently.  Allowance  has  been  made  for  costs  of\nequipment replacement, road maintenance, and minor improvements to the network without the\nProject. The economic benefits generated by the project roads include (i) VOC and time savings\nfor those who remain on their original routes, (ii) VOC and time savings for those who choose to\npay the toll and divert to the new road, (iii) VOC savings on the improved local road network; (iv)\nbenefits  from  generated  traffic,  (v)  savings  in  the  direct  and  indirect  costs  of  accidents,  (vi)\nworking  capital  savings  to  freight  in  transit;  and  (vii)  resource  cost  savings  arising  from\ndiversions from rail to road. Environmental benefits will come from avoided vehicular emissions\nas a result of the reduced level of congestion on the NH 322. However, these benefits were not\nincluded in the analysis due to lack of an established methodology for their valuation. Economic\ncosts and benefits have been valued in economic prices.\n\n97.\nOn this basis, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project is 20.0 percent,\nindicating that the Project is economically viable. The EIRR of the complementary road program\nalone  is  22.7  percent.  Results  of  sensitivity  analysis  confirm  the  robustness  of  the  project's\neconomic viability. Changes in the key variables, such as 20 percent reduction in VOC savings\nand growth rate of normal traffic, do not significantly impact the economic viability. The capital\ncost would have to increase by about 100 percent over the base estimate for the EIRR to fall\nbelow 12 percent. The benefit level would have to decrease by more than 50 percent to achieve\nthe  same  effect.  Given  the  previous  experience  in  the  PRC,  variations  of  such  magnitude  are\nunlikely.\n\n\f31\n\n2.\n\nFinancial Performance and Analysis\n\n98.\nThe responsibility of toll setting has been devolved by MOC to provincial governments.\nWithin GZAR, the level of tolls is set by the Price Control Bureau in consultation with GCD. The\nprovincial  government  approves  and  endorses  the  toll  rate  proposal.  The  primary  criteria  for\nestablishing  toll  rates  include  (i)  standard  of  the  road,  (ii)  total  construction  and  maintenance\ncosts,  (iii)  traffic  volumes,  and  (iv)  affordability  of  toll  rates.  Toll  rate  increases  are  decided  on\nthe  basis  of  the  actual  traffic  volumes  on  the  road,  debt  servicing,  real  income,  and  price\nincreases.\n\n99.\nThe  toll  rates  proposed  for  the  project  roads  are  in  line  with  tolls  proposed  for  other\nroads  in  Guangxi,  and  are  in  the  high  end  of  rates  nationally.  Based  on  preliminary  financial\nanalysis,  the  proposed  toll  level  would  ensure  the  financial  viability  of  the  Project.  GCD  will\nundertake a toll study prior to opening the expressway and each year for five years thereafter, to\nconfirm the appropriate toll level, and will submit the results for ADB concurrence. ADB provided\nTA (footnote 44) to carry out a toll diversion study and the resulting manual has been distributed\nto  PCDs.  Findings  of  these  studies  will  help  GCD  determine  the  toll  levels  for  the  proposed\nProject. Toll levels will be reviewed annually to account for increases in costs, and other factors.\nThe level and structure of the tolls for the tollway will be designed to ensure that the revenue will\ncover  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  debt  servicing,  and  depreciation  in  excess  of  debt\nservicing, and generate an acceptable rate of return on the investment as adjusted for inflation.\nIf  an  adjustment  in  the  toll  levels  is  required  based  on  this  principle,  GCD  will  submit  its  toll\nadjustment  plans  for  ADB\u2019s  concurrence  prior  to  finalizing  and  submitting  it  to  the  provincial\ngovernment for approval.\n\n100.\nThe  financial  performance  of  the  project  expressway  was  forecast  taking  into  account\nthe  anticipated  traffic,  the  projected  operating  costs,  and  the  proposed  toll  rates.  The  working\nratio is expected to be below 12 percent over the project life. The debt service coverage ratio of\nmore than 1.2 is achievable from the first year of full operation. The debt-to-equity ratio will be\nbelow 65:35.\n\nThe  GEMC,  when  established  as  a  corporation  independent  of  the  provincial\n101.\ngovernment, is expected to be financially autonomous. Projections based on currently available\ninformation and investment plans show that the expressway portfolios will be financially sound\n(Appendix  16).  The  after  tax  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  for  the  project  expressway\nincluding the cost of complementary roads is estimated at 9.0 percent, which is acceptable as it\nexceeds the estimated weighted average cost of capital of 3.1 percent (Appendix 17). Sensitivity\nanalysis  shows  that  the  Project  will  be  able  to  meet  all  its  financial  obligations,  and  that  the\nFIRR  will  stay  above  the  estimated  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  under  various  adverse\nscenarios (20 percent increase in the project cost, 20 percent decrease in the toll revenue, 30\npercent increase in operation and maintenance costs, and a one-year implementation delay). A\ndevaluation of the yuan by 30 percent would reduce the FIRR to 8.1 percent. Without including\nthe complementary roads, which do not generate any direct revenues, the FIRR after tax is 9.7\npercent.\n\nB.\n\nSocial Dimensions and Impact on Poverty\n\nThe Government, with the assistance of ADB, prepared a poverty impact analysis for the\n102.\nProject, based on 1999 poverty data. Of the 1.6 million people living in the project area, about\n1.1 million are expected to directly benefit from the Project. The proportion of poor (footnote 50)\n\n\f32\n\namong  project  beneficiaries  will  be  around  13  percent,  slightly  above  the  12  percent  poverty\nincidence  in  the  PRC.  During  appraisal,  the  GZAR  government  provided  new  poverty  data,\nbased on surveys conducted in 2000, which result in a much higher proportion of poor among\nproject beneficiaries.58 A summary of the poverty impact analysis is in Appendix 14.\n\n103.\nThe  economy  in  the  project  area  is  predominantly  agricultural  providing  40  percent  of\nGDP  and  75  percent  of  the  employment.  Industrial  development  is  limited,  accounting  for  20\npercent of GDP, much lower then the 45 percent at the national level. There is a high level of\ntemporary migration to the eastern cities (especially Guangzhou and Shenzhen). About 30 to 40\npercent of the rural labor force has temporary jobs outside their area. Remittances from those\nmigrating to work temporarily in other provinces are an important factor in boosting household\nincomes, and reducing poverty. This results from the wide wage rate differences between rural\nand urban areas.\n\n104.\nLack  of  access  to  economic  opportunities  is  a  significant  cause  of  rural  poverty  in  the\nPRC.  Poverty  counties  are  concentrated  in  remote  mountainous  areas  in  the  central  and\nwestern regions. In the project area, townships that are far from NH 322 have higher incidences\nof  poverty  than  those  closer  to  the  highway.  Linking  the  poor  areas  to  growth  centers  will\nimprove  the  economic  conditions  and  expand  the  scope  for  economic  and  social  activities.\nDirect  or  indirect  access  to  growth  centers  will  provide  market  and  employment  opportunities,\nand better social services. The Project is expected to generate a sustainable poverty reduction\nimpact in the long term and a limited positive impact in the short term. The improvement of the\nroad network under the Project, including expressway, connectors, and complementary roads,\nwill boost investments in GZAR, which will create demand for the goods and services provided\nby  the  people  in  remote  areas,  even  if  they  are  not  directly  connected  to  the  Project.  The\ncombination  of  these  anticipated  effects  will  have  a  pronounced  positive  influence  on  poverty\nreduction in GZAR, within and beyond the project area.\n\n105. Poverty considerations have been an integral part of project design. The Project includes\nmeasures  to  extend  socioeconomic  benefits  to  the  poor,  in  particular  the  complementary  road\nprogram, explicitly formulated to target the remaining concentrations of poor populations in the\nproject area (para. 63). Virtually all settlements served by the complementary road scheme are\neither  classified  as  poor  today  or  have  only  recently  been  elevated  from  poverty  status.\nAdditional  measures  will  be  required  to  stimulate  and  encourage  increased  agricultural\nproduction and build new income opportunities for the poor.59\n\n106. During  construction  and  operation,  the  Project  will  generate  employment  opportunities\nand priority will be given to poor people living in the project area. Approximately 16,500 laborers\nwill be hired for the duration of the construction. The Government has assured ADB that a large\nproportion of these will be from labor teams identified through PADO and that they will be paid a\nmarket  wage.  In  addition,  during  the  operational  phase  up  to  750  poor  workers  will  be\nemployed,  whose  living  conditions  will  improve.  The  wages  from  employment  during\nconstruction  and  operation  of  the  Project  will  increase  family  incomes,  raise  living  standards,\n\n                  \n\n58  Based  on  the  new  data,  which  are  still  unofficial,  the  proportion  of  poor  among  the  GZAR  population  would  be\naround 32 percent, much higher than estimated in 1999, due to the correction of overestimation of rural incomes\nbefore 2000. The official 2000 poverty data will be available by the end of 2001, and taken into account during loan\ninception when updating the base line used for the project performance monitoring system (para. 82).\n\n59 To implement such measures, ADB is helping the Guangxi PADO prepare a project proposal for financing under\nthe Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. The proposal includes investment in fruit tree planing, and training of poor\nfarmers to improve quality, productivity, and marketing of their produce.\n\n\f33\n\nand thus reduce poverty. The impact of the Project on poverty reduction will be evaluated during\nand after Project implementation.\n\nC.\n\nProject Risks\n\n107.\nThe Project has been formulated to reduce potential technical and economic risks. The\nmain  technical  risks,  which  could  result  in  implementation  delays  and  cost  overruns,  are\nassociated  with  the  six  large  bridges  and  two  tunnels.  To  mitigate  these  risks,  international\nconsultants  have  reviewed  the  proposed  construction  methods.  The  prequalification  of\ncontractors will focus on their financial and technical capability in handling similar works. During\nthe construction period, monitoring and contract management information systems will be set up\nand implemented with the assistance of the international consultants for timely identification of\ntechnical  problems  and  implementation  of  corrective  measures.  GCD  has  proven  experience\nand  has  satisfactorily  implemented  similar  projects.  There  are  no  major  environmental  and\nresettlement risks and adequate mitigation and monitoring mechanisms have been built into the\nProject.  Appropriate  coordination  and  monitoring  mechanisms  will  be  put  in  place  for\nresettlement.\n\n108. Economic  performance  in  the  project  influence  area  would  have  to  deteriorate\nsubstantially  for  the Project to lose economic viability. While a financial risk is associated  with\nconstruction  and  operation  of  the  expressway,  its  extent  will  depend  upon  the  actual\nconstruction costs when contracts are awarded and during the subsequent implementation. To\nmitigate  this  risk,  GCD  is  consciously  oriented  to  building  up  a  commercial  business\nenvironment  for  expressway  operations,  and  the  project  expressway  will  receive  substantial\nequity  injections  from  the  central  and  provincial  governments.  As  the  Project  will  generate\nrevenue in domestic currency, there is a risk related to exchange rate changes. Sensitivity tests\nindicate that an adverse exchange rate change will have only a limited effect on the FIRR.\n\nVI.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe following assurances in addition to the standard assurances will be incorporated in\n\n109.\nthe legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nCounterpart  Financing.  The  Government  and  GZAR  will  ensure  that  GCD\nobtains, on a timely basis, all funds and resources necessary for construction of\nthe project roads, in accordance with the financing plan for the Project as agreed\nto by ADB.\n\nthat \n\nin  accordance  with \n\nthe  project  roads  are  constructed \n\nConstruction  Quality  and  Sound  Development  Management.  GCD  will\nthe\nensure \nGovernment\u2019s  technical  standards  of  highway  engineering.  GCD  will  promote\nsound  development  management,  and  ensure  that  quality  control,  contract\nmanagement,  and  construction  supervision,  are  performed  in  accordance  with\nnational  standards  and  internationally  accepted  practices.  GCD  will  (a)  provide\nthe international team leader with all the necessary powers to review and certify\nvariation orders and contractors\u2019 monthly payments, prior to their approval by the\nchief  supervision  engineer;  (b)  submit  for  ADB  concurrence  the  TOR  of  the\ncontract management specialist, quantity engineer, and quality control specialist\nhired  as  deputy  chiefs  of  the  Supervision  Division,  Measurement  Office,  and\nCentral  Laboratory,  respectively,  of  the  Chief  Supervision  Engineer  Office;  (c)\nsubmit  for  ADB  concurrence  the  resumes  of  the  candidates  selected  for  these\n\n\f34\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nthree  positions;  (d)  confirm  to  ADB  the  recruitment  of  the  selected  candidates;\nand  (e)  find  internationally  recruited  consultants  to  fill  these  positions,  if  the\nselected domestic consultants can not satisfy the requirements of the TOR.\n\nRoad  Traffic  Safety.  GCD  will  ensure  that  the  recommended  road  safety\nenhancement  measures  are  incorporated  in  the  design  of  the  Project  and  are\nimplemented,  and  that  road  safety  audits  are  carried  out  before  construction\nstarts, and again before operations commence. The Government will ensure that\nthe  project  roads  are  adequately  patrolled  to  mitigate  against  illegal  use  of  the\nfacilities.\n\nAxle Load. GZAR will take appropriate measures to prevent overloading on the\nproject roads by installing vehicle axle weighing equipment at selected locations,\nand  making  suitable  arrangements  for  operation  of  such  equipment.  Prior  to\ncommercial operation of the project roads, GCD will submit to ADB a statement\nindicating  legal  axle  load  limits,  frequency  of  testing,  and  penalties  for\ninfringement.\n\nOperation  and  Maintenance.  GZAR  will  ensure  that,  upon  completion  of  the\nProject, the project facilities will be adequately operated and maintained, and that\nthe project road pavement will be maintained at an international roughness index\nlevel of not more than 3 meters per kilometer.\n\nCorporatization.  Six  months  prior  to  the  expected  date  of  project  completion,\nand not later than 30 June 2004, GCD will have created a corporation, tentatively\ncalled  Guangxi  Expressway  Management  Company  (GEMC),  to  construct,\noperate,  and  maintain  all  expressways  in  GZAR.  Details  on  the  creation  of\nGEMC, and transfer of assets, revenues, and debt service obligations from GCD\nto  GEMC,  including  GEMC's  financial  statements  for  the  Project,  will  be\nsubmitted for ADB's approval six months prior to GEMC creation. GCD will enter\ninto an agreement with GEMC to ensure autonomy of operations, encourage the\nestablishment of road facility performance indicators, and facilitate refinancing of\nroad sector assets. Prior to opening to traffic, the onlending agreement between\nGZAR and GEMC for transfer of part or all of the ADB loan will be submitted for\nADB\u2019s  concurrence.  After  GEMC  has  been  created  as  a  corporation,  the\nresponsibilities  of  GCD  as  EA  will  be  transferred  to  GEMC.  Prior  to  the\nassumption of GCD\u2019s responsibilities under the Project by GEMC, ADB will enter\ninto  a  project  agreement  with  GEMC,  which  will  set  forth  the  responsibilities  of\nGEMC as EA under the Project.\n\nTolls. The tolls for the project roads will be set at levels sufficient to ensure the\nmaximum  debt  service  coverage,  the  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  and\ndepreciation in excess of debt service, and to generate an acceptable return on\nassets as adjusted from time to time for inflation. Six months prior to the start of\ncommercial  operations,  GCD  will  prepare  and  submit  for  ADB\u2019s  concurrence  a\nreport on the proposed toll structure and levels, before submitting the application\nto  the  GZAR  government  for  its  approval.  For  the  first  five  years  of  operation,\nGCD will review the toll structure and levels annually and submit a report to ADB.\nIf  the  toll  levels  must  be  adjusted  to  cover  inflation,  GCD  will  submit  for  ADB\u2019s\nconcurrence  the  toll  adjustment  plan,  prior  to  finalizing  and  submitting  it  to  the\nGZAR government for its approval.\n\n\f35\n\n(viii)  Financial  Ratios.  To  ensure  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  operation  of  the\ntolled  project  roads,  GCD  and  GEMC  after  it  is  established,  will  maintain  (a)  a\nworking  ratio  (operating  and  annual  maintenance  costs,  excluding  periodic\nmaintenance,  to  revenue)  of  not  more  than  12  percent;  (b)  a  debt  service\ncoverage  ratio  of  not  less  than  1.2;  and  (c)  a  debt-to-equity  ratio  of  less  than\n65:35.  To  this  end,  GZAR  will  provide  or  cause  to  be  provided,  to  GEMC  on  a\ntimely basis all funds needed in addition to their internally generated revenues.\n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nNongovernment  Financing.  Six  months  prior  to  the  opening  of  the  project\nroads,  GCD  will  analyze  the  feasibility  of  attracting  nongovernment  investment\nfunds  for  the  project  facilities  (including  private  sector  participation  in  the\noperation,  maintenance,  and  management  of  the  project  roads);  report  its\nconclusions and objectives to ADB; and outline the approach for achieving these\nobjectives.\n\nEnvironment.  GCD  will  ensure  that  the  Project  is  constructed  and  operated  in\naccordance  with  environmental  procedures  and  guidelines  of  the  national\ngovernment,  local  government,  and  ADB;  that  any  adverse  environmental\nimpacts  arising  from  the  Project  are  minimized  by  implementing  the  mitigation\nmeasures  and  environmental  monitoring  program  presented  in  the  EIA  and\nsummary  EIA;  and  that  the  implementation  of  the  environmental  monitoring\nprogram,  including  mitigation  measures,  and  copies  of  permits,  licenses,  and\nclearances  is  regularly  reported  to  ADB  as  specified  in  the  EIA,  including\nviolations of safety and environmental standards, if any, and how they have been\ncorrected.\n\nLand  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  GCD  will  ensure  that  the  resettlement\nplan is carried out promptly and efficiently, including land acquisition, in line with\nthe PRC Land Administration Law and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement;\nthat  all  affected  people  are  consulted  on  the  entitlements  at  least  four  months\nbefore ground clearing commences; and that sufficient budget is made available,\nthe compensation to the affected people is made in a timely manner, and those\naffected will be at least as well off after the Project as they were before it. GCD\nwill  ensure  that  the  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan  is  monitored  and\nevaluated independently by a local institute and reported annually to ADB. GCD\nwill keep ADB informed of the progress of resettlement activities through regular\nreporting as specified in the resettlement plan.\n\n(xii) \n\nPoverty  Reduction.  GCD,  in  cooperation  with  the  Guangxi  PADO  and  Labor\nBureau,  will  ensure  that  (a)  contractors  maximize  the  employment  of  local  poor\npeople  for  constructing  the  project  roads;  and  (b)  local  villagers  working  for  the\ncomplementary road program will receive a salary based on market rates. GCD\nwill monitor the impacts on poverty with the assistance of a local institute. GCD\nwill  provide  semiannual  monitoring  reports  on  these  impacts  to  ADB  during\nconstruction, as part of the quarterly reports, and an evaluation report three years\nafter project completion.\n\n(xiii)  Complementary Road Program. GZAR and GCD will (a) ensure that the county\ngovernments implement the complementary road program as agreed with ADB, (b)\nprovide,  in  a  timely  manner,  adequate  funds  to  implement  the  program  and  the\n\n\f36\n\nsocial and environmental mitigation measures for the program, and (c) ensure that\nthe  county  governments  adequately  operate  and  maintain \nroads\nconstructed/upgraded under the program.\n\nthe \n\n(xiv)  Gender  and  Development.  GCD  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and\nDevelopment  during  implementation  of  the  Project,  and  will  take  all  necessary\nactions  to  encourage  women  living  in  the  project  area  to  participate  in  planning\nand  implementing  the  Project,  including  construction  work.  GCD  will  monitor\neffects  on  women  during  project  implementation,  through  gender-disaggregated\ndata  in  the  resettlement  plan  and  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  system,  in\nconsultation  with  the  All-China  Women\u2019s  Federation  at  the  provincial  and  local\nlevels.\n\n(xv)  Health  Risks.  GCD,  together  with  the  appropriate  authorities,  will  ensure  that\ncontractors disseminate information on the risks of sexually transmitted diseases\nto  those  employed  during  project  implementation.  GCD  will  also  ensure  that\nsimilar information is disseminated to transport operators during operation of the\nproject facilities.\n\n(xvi)  Vehicle  Emissions.  GCD  will  cooperate  with  and  assist  the  environmental\nprotection bureau in controlling vehicle emissions on the project roads. GCD will\nsubmit  to  ADB,  before  commercial  operation  of  the  project  facilities,  the\nGovernment-prescribed  emission \ntheir\nfor \ninfringement, and a plan for operation of vehicle emissions testing stations.\n\nlimits,  penalties \n\nregulation \n\n(xvii)  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  GCD  will  monitor  and  evaluate  project  impacts\nthrough  a  project  performance  management  system  to  ensure  that  the  project\nfacilities  are  managed  effectively  and  the  benefits,  particularly  to  the  poor,  are\nmaximized.  GCD  will  collect  data  agreed  with  ADB  prior  to  implementation,  at\ncompletion, and annually for three years thereafter.\n\n(xviii)  Human  Resource  Development  and  Training.

Its primary disadvantage is its high cost to road users and to the economy. Equity\ninvestors  require  a  higher  rate  of  return  than  lenders,  and  seek  to  obtain  this  from  road  users\nthrough higher tolls, reducing the net economic benefits from projects. The current expected rate\nof return on cooperative joint venture equity for PRC road projects is about 18 percent. The Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) facilitated the development of cooperative joint ventures in Guangdong,\nHebei,  Hunan,  and  Sichuan  provinces  by  investing  about  $15  million  through  the  China  Assets\nHolding  Limited,  and  $71  million  in  the  DeMat  TransAsia  Holdings  Limited,  through  the  Asian\nInfrastructure Fund (Table).\n\n2.\n\nSecuritization\n\n2.\nSecuritization through an initial public offering can benefit from cash flow accruing at the\noperating entity level as well as at the project level. The share of the toll road entity sold to public\ninvestors usually ranges from 20 percent to 40 percent. The advantage of this financing option is\nits  low  cost.  Securitization  is  undertaken  at  the  operation  stage,  after  certain  project  risks  have\nbeen mitigated, such as construction delays, cost overruns, and initial traffic levels. An H share\nlisting on the stock exchange in Hong Kong, China is an inexpensive modality with a high price-\nearning  ratio2  (6  to  17  times  in  1999).  B  share  listings  on  the  Shenzhen  or  Shanghai  stock\nexchanges are slightly more expensive with a price-earning ratio of 10 to 15 times in 1999, which\nis  lower  and  less  volatile  than  A  share  listings  (with  an  average  monthly  price  earning  ratio  of\nabout 54 times in 2000).3 The greatest disadvantage of this financing modality is the time required\nto  complete  the  regulatory  formalities.  In  addition,  in  the  Shenzhen  and  Shanghai  stock\nexchanges,  companies  must  have  three  profitable  years  of  operation  before  they  can  be  listed.\nBecause of these issues, this modality is more appropriate as a refinancing instrument.\n\n3.\nSince  1995,  15  PRC  expressway  companies  and  infrastructure  developers  have  been\nlisted  on  the  stock  exchanges  in  Hong  Kong,  China;  Shanghai;  and  Shenzhen.4  Two  of  these\n\n                                                          \n1 \n\nIn a cooperative joint-venture scheme, the foreign investor receives a percentage of profit higher than its equity\nshare during the early years of operation until its equity investment is fully recovered, and less over the following\nyears.  Normal  equity  joint  ventures  are  less  attractive  because  there  is  no  such  preference  for  foreign\ninvestments.\n\n2  Calculated as the stock price divided by the earnings per share.\n3  An  H  share  listing  involves  the  sale  of  shares  on  the  stock  exchange  in  Hong  Kong,  China  only  in  foreign\ncurrency. A and B listings involve the sale of shares on a PRC stock exchange (Shanghai or Shenzhen) in local\nand  foreign  currencies,  respectively.  The  Government  has  recently  allowed  Chinese  with  available  foreign\ncurrency to buy B shares, which is likely to boost their price.\n\n4  These  are:  Anhui,  Jiangsu,  Shenzhen,  Sichuan,  and  Zhejiang  Expressways  and  Cheung  Kong,  New  World,  and\nRoad King Infrastructures, in Hong Kong (H shares); Northeast (Jilin) Expressway in Shanghai (A shares); Ganyue,\nGuandong, Hainan, and Hubei Expressways in Shenzhen (A shares); and Guangdong and Hunan Expressways in\nShenzhen (B shares).\n\n\f49\n\nAppendix 5, page 2\n\nprojects  were  financed  by  ADB.5  After  three  years  of  profitable  operations,  the  Jilin  Provincial\nExpressway  Corporation6  established  the  Northeast  Expressway  Co.,  Ltd.7  by  securitizing  the\nfuture toll revenues of the expressway. The company went public on 10 August 1999, offering\n25 percent of the total shares on the Shanghai stock exchange as an A share listing. The issue\nprice was Y4.00 per share and the trading prices ranged between Y4.92 and Y6.40 after listing.\nA  price  earning  ratio  of  44  was  achieved  during  1999.  ADB  helped  review  the  initial  public\noffering  proposal  and  revenue  projections  of  the  corporation  for  this  transaction.  The  Hunan\nExpressway  Project  was  completed  in  November  1996,  and  one  of  the  project  components,\ntogether with other toll roads and bridges, was listed on the Shenzhen stock exchange, B share\nsection,  on  28  January  1999.  Because  of  a  stock  split  in  May  1999,  earnings  per  share  have\ndecreased  slightly,  while  the  market  capitalization  has  reached  Y2,629  million.  Average  price\nearning ratio was 30 in 1999.\n\n3.\n\nRevenue Bond Financing\n\n4.\nRevenue  bond  financing  involves  the  sale  of  rated  notes  backed  by  a  pledge  of  a\ncompany\u2019s  cash-flow  sources.  This  is  a  relatively  new  highway  financing  modality  in  Asia.  In\nAugust  1996,  Zuhai  Municipality  in  Guangdong  Province  completed  a  landmark  company-level\nrevenue bond financing, which raised $200 million from investors in the United States (US) for the\nZhuhai  Highway  Company  Limited.  The  main  problem  of  this  financing  option  is  the  weak\nregulatory framework, which results in a difficult and time-consuming procedure for securing the\nnecessary  approvals.  The  US  dollar  rate  of  return  required  by  investors  in  a  company-level\nrevenue bond was in the 10-15 percent range for a PRC issue in 1999.\n\n4.\n\nBuild-Operate-Transfer (BOT) Structure\n\n5.\nAlthough the BOT approach has been widely used in the power generation industry, it has\nmet with only limited success in the roads, except where the project is a natural monopoly, such\nas a bridge or tunnel. BOT financing transfers risk to the private sector. It relieves the government\nof funding responsibility, but makes the investment less attractive to private investors in a high-\nrisk  environment.  In  the  PRC,  the  State  Development  Planning  Commission  has  developed  a\npolicy and regulatory framework to facilitate the formulation and award of BOT projects, but this\nhas  yet  to  be  formalized  through  Government  decree.  One  of  a  few  road  projects  in  the  PRC\nattractive enough to be developed under a BOT scheme is the Tianjin-Shugang Highway project\nto upgrade and operate a 40 km three-lane dual expressway between Tianjin City and Tanggu\nPort,  under  a  25-year  concession.  ADB  invested  in  the  Asian  Infrastructure  Development\nCompany  that  holds  a  $36.2  million  equity  stake  in  the  Tianjin-Shugang  Highway.  Another\nsuccessful BOT agreement was concluded in December 2000 in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous\nRegion for the Liujing-Xingyue section of the Nanning-Guangzhou Expressway, which has a very\nhigh expected traffic. Although ADB attempted to develop the Yangjiang-Dianbai expressway in\nGuangdong Province on a BOT basis, the feasibility study8 concluded that the project was not\nfinancially  viable  for  this  modality,  because  of  weak  performance  criteria  and  high  risks\nassociated  with  the  traffic  forecast.9  ADB  is  providing  further  assistance  in  this  area  through\n\n                                                          \n5  Loan 1262-PRC: Jilin Expressway Project, for $ 126 million, approved on 9 November 1993; and Loan 1261-PRC:\n\nHunan Expressway Project, for $74 million, approved on 9 November 1993.\n6  Wholly owned subsidiary of the Jilin Provincial Communications Department.\n7  Founded jointly by the Jilin and the Heilongjiang Provincial Expressway Corporations and a subsidiary of MOC.\n8  TA 2649-PRC: Facilitating Build-Operate-Transfer Modality in the Highway Sector, for $1.1 million, approved on\n\n9  The  World  Bank  attempted  to  develop  a  bridge  project  on  a  BOT  basis  in  Hubei  Province,  but  it  did  not\n\n27 September 1996.\n\nmaterialize.\n\n\f50\n\nAppendix 5, page 3\n\ntechnical assistance10 to develop an 80-kilometer section of the Nanjin-Hanzhou expressway in\nJiangsu Province on a BOT basis.\n\n6.\nThe initial model BOT projects were structured to have 100 percent foreign financing. The\nAsian  currency  turmoil  made  investors  and  commercial  lenders  cautious  about  infrastructure\nprojects  that  use  foreign  currency  debt  in  construction  but  generate  revenues  in  local  currency.\nPart of ADB\u2019s policy dialogue has been to encourage the Government to allow BOT sponsors to\narrange some domestic financing should they so wish. Other potential risks for BOT projects are\nlower-than-expected  levels  of  traffic  and  revenues  in  the  early  years  of  operation,  construction\ncost  overruns,  implementation  delays,  and  land  acquisition  problems.  The  current  lack  of  legal\nand  regulatory  clarity  has  also  increased  the  perceived  risk  of  the  BOT  approach,  making  it\nunattractive for most PRC road projects. The model based on cooperative joint ventures is rather\ncostly, and hence feasible only for projects with high financial rates of return.\n\nB. \n\nADB Investment in Private Sector Funds in the Road Sector\n\nADB, through its Private Sector Group, has holdings in several funds that invested $122.7\n7.\nmillion  in  equity  in  seven  road  projects,  mostly  in  the  eastern  coast  of  the  PRC  (Table).  The\nprojects in which ADB has participated are well established in the market, with satisfactory track\nrecords  and  quality  assets.  As  such,  most  are  operating  profitably,  although  traffic  flows  are\ngenerally below those forecast. Future financial returns are expected to improve as the projects\nmature;  most  are  still  in  the  early  stages  of  operation  when  revenues  have  not  peaked.  In  an\nexception to the generally good performance, revenues are much lower than anticipated in one\ncase because of inadequate toll collection arrangements and a competing road with similar travel\ndistance and time.\n\n                                                          \n10 TA 3569-PRC: Jiangsu Highway BOT Project, for $555,000, approved on 12 December 2000.\n\n\f51\n\nAppendix 5, page 4\n\nInvestments in the PRC Road Sector by Private Sector Funds\nwith ADB Holdings\n\nInvestment No.,\nFund Name\n7072, China Assets\nHoldings Ltd.

The  surveys  included  manual  counts  and  origin  and  destination  surveys.  The\nsurveys were verified and updated by the project preparatory technical assistance consultants in\n2000  and  the  additional  work  included  a  survey  of  traffic  traveling  to  the  Viet  Nam  border\ncrossings and free trade area1.\n\n2.\nTraffic  increased  considerably  during  1990-1997  on  the  existing  national  highway  (NH)\n322 between Nanning and the border with Viet Nam. Overall annual growth in this period has\nbeen 13 percent for motorized traffic and 5 percent for nonmotorised vehicles, although in some\nroad sections it is as high as 21 percent overall. The increase reflects the high economic growth\nin counties adjacent to the highway over the same period.\n\n3.\nMany sections of NH 322 have traffic volumes over capacity levels and the journey from\nNanning to the border currently takes five hours for the 220 km for passenger cars and longer\nfor trucks. When breakdowns occur these times can be much longer. If highway capacity is not\nincreased, average times will increase dramatically and economic growth will not be sustained.\nTraffic volumes on NH 322 in 2000 were 6,000 medium truck equivalent (MTE) units per day at\nWuxu, 30 km from Nanning, dropping to 1,500 MTE near Banli in the middle of the project area,\nand rising to 5,000 MTE close to Ningming town and nearly 3,000 MTE close to the border. This\nindicates  a  slowing  in  the  growth  rates  since  1998  except  in  the  border  area,  where  traffic\ngrowth has been over 20 percent for the last two years.\n\nB. \n\nTraffic Forecast\n\n4.\nFuture  traffic  demand  forecasts  were  prepared  for  the  proposed  expressway  and  the\nsurrounding  road  network  for  the  years  2005,  2015,  and  2025.  The  forecasts  were  prepared\nusing the feasibility study 1999 trip matrixes and a model of the road network within the project\narea coupled with the major roads outside the project area within Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous\nRegion  (GZAR).  The  forecasts  of  travel  demand  use  forecasts  of  economic  growth  within  the\nproject  area  and  in  GZAR  and  the  rest  of  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  estimates  of\nelasticity  of  demand,  and  projected  future  changes  in  freight  and  passenger  vehicle  fleet\ncomposition.  Allowance  was  made  for  some  limited  diversion  from  rail  to  road.  Waterborne\ntraffic in the area is negligible and unlikely to divert, and there is little air traffic; the only possible\naffected route would be that between Nanning and Hanoi.\n\nAs  the  existing  NH  322  will  be  very  congested  by  2005  when  the  expressway  opens,\n5.\nsome allowance was made for traffic suppression on this road in the without-Project case. With\nthe expressway constructed this suppressed traffic will be released.\n\nSome trips will be generated as a result of the new expressway and class I road, from (i)\n6.\npeople  who  choose  to  travel  more  as  a  result  of  improved  highway  and  reduced  travel  costs\n(travel from Nanning to Pingxiang and back will take a single day); (ii) new trips made by people\nwho  would  not  travel  due  to  the  condition  of  the  existing  highway;  (iii)  additional  national  and\ninternational  trade  resulting  from  reduced  transport  costs;  (iv)  new  and  relocated  businesses\n\n                                                          \n1  This traffic was not defined in the original surveys.\n\n\f53\n\nAppendix 6, page 2\n\nalong  the  new  highway  taking  advantage  of  reduced  transport  costs;  and  (v)  new  trips  due  to\nincreased tourist numbers particularly between the PRC and Viet Nam.\n\n7.\nVolumes of traffic forecast on the NanYou Expressway and on the existing parallel NH\n322  are  summarized  in  Table  A6.1.  The  forecasts  clearly  show  the  need  for  additional  road\ncapacity in the corridor after 2005.\n\n8.\nBecause of the large time and distance savings (over four hours in 2005 and 45 km from\nNanning  to  YouYiGuan)  and  poor  condition  of  the  existing  road,  virtually  all  (over  95  percent)\nlong  distance  traffic  will  divert  to  the  new  road  under  the  toll  system  proposed.  Lesser  rates\napply  to  short  haul  traffic  although,  as  some  of  the  major  towns  on  the  route  (Fusui  and\nChongzuo) lie far from NH 322 and close to the expressway, diversion rates are also high for\ntraffic from these towns.\n\n9.\nConstruction  of  the  expressway  will  provide  significant  savings  in  travel  times  both  for\nusers who divert to the new expressway and those who remain on the existing NH 322. These\nsavings  are  shown  in  Table  A6.2.  The  table  sets  out  travel  time  savings  for  freight  traffic\nbetween major towns in the project area both on the expressway and the existing road when the\nexpressway  is  complete,  compared  to  times  on  the  existing  NH  322  if  the  expressway  is  not\nconstructed. Time savings for other vehicles are similar.\n\nTable A6.1:\n\nForecast Average Annual Daily Traffic Volume by Section by Year\n\nNH 322 Expressway\n\nTotal Percent Growth\n\n(per annum)\n\n1998a\nMTE/day\n\n5,850\n2,500\n3,600\n1,500\n2,000\n900\n\nCorridor Section\n\n2005\nWuxu-Xichang\nXichang-Banli (Fusui County)\nBanli-Ningming (Chongzuo County)\nNingming-Xiashi (Ningming County)\nXiashi-Pingxian\nPingxiang-YouYiGuanb, c\n\n2015\nWuxu-Xichang\nXichang-Banli (Fusui County)\nBanli-Ningming (Chongzuo County)\nNingming-Xiashi (Ningming County)\nXiashi-Pingxian\nPingxiang-YouYiGuan b, c\n\n2,400\n1,000\n5,300\n1,000\n400\n\n3,350\n1,900\n5,600\n1,900\n1,700\n\n7,350\n4,300\n3,800\n2,300\n3,600\n1,600\n\n14,100\n8,500\n8,000\n5,100\n6,300\n2,900\n\n9,750\n5,300\n9,100\n3,300\n4,000\n1,600\n\n17,450\n10,400\n13,600\n7,000\n8,000\n2,900\n\n2025\nWuxu-Xichang\nXichang-Banli (Fusui County)\nBanli-Ningming (Chongzuo County)\nNingming-Xiashi (Ningming County)\nXiashi-Pingxian\nPingxiang-YouYiGuanb, c\nMTE=medium truck equivalent unit, NH=national highway.\na On existing NH 322 road.\nb Existing road and new Class I road use substantially the same alignment over this section.\n\n25,250\n16,100\n16,000\n11,350\n11,900\n5,000\n\n4,500\n3,200\n5,900\n3,200\n4,300\n\n29,750\n19,300\n21,900\n14,550\n16,200\n5,000\n\nLocal slow moving traffic will use a service road where the two alignments coincide.\n\nc Does not include local service traffic to free trade areas.

Trade with Viet Nam has also grown steadily in\nthe 1990s following relaxation of border controls in the mid-1990s. The road and rail routes from\nNanning to Viet Nam through the project area accounts for half of Guangxi trade with Vietnam\nthus traffic traveling to the border areas has grown correspondingly. There is one rail and four\nroad  border  crossings  in  Pingxiang  City  (county)  and  trade  between  the  PRC  and  Viet  Nam\ntakes  place  under  the  auspices  of  the  Customs  General  or  less  formally  through  the  local\nfrontier trading administration. The majority of trade is of the less formal type.\n\n11.\nFormal Government trading passes through the customs at Friendship Pass, the junction\nof NH 322 and Viet Nam NH 1. The proposed road will also meet Viet Nam NH 1 at this spot.\nTourist  traffic  also  uses  this  crossing  point.  The  majority  of  trade  however  uses  the  two  free\ntrade areas close to Pingxiang City at Pozhai and Nongyao. Roads from these areas connect\nwith NH 322 close to Pingxiang City, about 20 km from Friendship Pass. At present all goods to\nand from Viet Nam by road are transshipped at the free trade areas.\n\n12.\nFollowing the signing of the Frontier Trade Agreement in 1999 a further agreement, the\nHighway Transport Agreement, was signed (December 2000). This has facilitated crossborder\ntraffic between Guangxi and the three bordering provinces of Viet Nam. The two countries hold\nregular  meetings  and  discussions  to  improve  the  crossborder  movements  of  freight  and\npassenger  vehicles  in  the  Nanning-Hanoi  economic  corridor.  Guangxi  Communications\nDepartment considers that the Project and the improvement of Viet Nam's NH 1, financed by the\nAsian Development Bank, will facilitate the discussions by providing better road infrastructure in\nthe corridor. At present, however, the permitted bus and truck routes between Guangxi and Viet\nNam are restrictive and are unlikely to stimulate growth by any significant amount. With further\nfreeing of travel restrictions, however, crossborder traffic will rise given the shortened travel time\nfrom Nanning to the border.\n\n13.\nIn  1999  over  251,000  tons  of  goods  crossed  into  Vietnam  by  road  from  Pingxiang\nthrough the free trade areas and 189,000 tonnes was imported. In addition 170,000 tonnes went\n\n\f55\n\nAppendix 6, page 4\n\nthrough Friendship Pass. Only 61,000 tonnes was transshipped by rail.2 In the last three years\nthe tonnage has grown at an annual rate of 16 percent and this rate should continue to rise as\ntrade restrictions are further liberalized.\n\nGiven  the  fluid  nature  of  ongoing  discussions  on  further  agreements  on  crossborder\n14.\ntrade it is difficult to estimate with any confidence the future growth in traffic going to and over\nthe border. For this reason, only traffic growth following normal economic growth has been used\nin  the  economic  and  financial  evaluations  for  the  Project.  However,  these  growth  rates  are\nalmost certainly understated.\n\n15.\nBenefits  of  increased  trade  as  a  result  of  the  Project  are  similarly  difficult  to  estimate.\nWhile  the  vehicle  operating  cost  benefits  are  measurable  for  traffic  using  the  project  roads\nincluded in the project evaluation, the liberalization of border crossing and trade will reduce the\nneed  for  the  free  trade  areas  and  transshipment  requirements;  although  through  traffic  will\nincrease, local growth in Pingxiang City may suffer.\n\n                                                          \n2  Because of the difference in rail gauge between the two countries all goods must be transferred at Pingxiang City.\n\nThis will continue to put rail travel at a disadvantage and the move from rail to road is likely to continue.\n\n\fSUMMARY COMPLEMENTARY ROAD PROGRAM\n\nAppendix 7\n\n 56\n\nLengtha \n(km)\n\nCost        \n\n(million \nYuan)\n\nGCD Poverty \nAlleviation \nFund\n\nIn which\n\nGCD \nSubvention \n\nOther\n\nRoad Improvement Type\n\nFushui County\n\nCounty Roads\n\nClass III-paved\nClass IV-paved\n\nVillage Roads\n\nClass IV-unpaved\n\nChongzuo County\nCounty Roads\n\nClass III-paved\n\nVillage Roads\n\nClass IV-unpaved\n\nLongzhou County\nCounty Roads\n\nNingming County\n\nCounty Roads\n\nClass III-paved\nClass IV-paved\n\nVillage Roads\n\nClass IV-paved\n\nPingxiang City\n\nCounty Roads\n\nClass III-paved\n\nVillage Roads\n\nClass III-paved\n\nClass III-paved\n\n142.40\n\n113.14\n\n3.08\n\n101.50\n\n8.56\n\n50.00\n42.00\n\n25.20\n\n40.00\n\n27.00\n\n12.00\n10.40\n\n0.91\n\n9.60\n\n1.62\n\n38.20\n12.00\n\n111.00\n\n33.80\n3.48\n\n32.20\n\n0.96\n\n11.50\n\n10.17\n\n0.29\n\n7.30\n\n2.56\n\n12.00\n5.40\n\n0.47\n\n9.60\n\n0.60\n\n30.17\n2.88\n\n26.64\n\n9.09\n\n2.19\n\n5.00\n\n0.44\n\n1.02\n\n2.67\n0.60\n\n5.56\n\n0.79\n\n0.37\n\nTotal\n\n506.60\n\n229.88\n\n4.33\n\n200.54\n\n25.01\n\na The improvement of 471 km of roads, earlier identified to be included in the complementary road program, has\n  already started and will be completed before the end of 2001.

For the first two components,\nbased  on  detailed  survey,  the  resettlement  impacts  and  measures  are  covered  by  the  current\nresettlement plan. Due to still in early planning stage, the last two components are not covered\nin  the  plan.  However,  since  both  components  will  mainly  involve  upgrading  on  the  existing\ntownship  and  village  roads,  little  land  acquisition  will  be  expected.  The  GZAR  government\nassured  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  that  if  additional  farmland  will  be  required,  the\naffected  people  will  receive  the  same  compensation  and  other  assistance  provided  in  the\nresettlement plan.\n\n2.\nThe Guangxi Communication Department (GCD) is the project Executing Agency. Xi\u2019an\nHighway  University  prepared  a  resettlement  plan  in  February  2000,  based  on  the  preliminary\ntechnical design, incorporating socioeconomic survey and village data collection of impacts. The\nresettlement  plan  has  been  updated  to  take  into  account  subsequent  design  modifications\nrequested by the Ministry of Communications and recently approved GZAR land administration\ndirectives.\n\nB. \n\nScope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n\nThe expressway and connector and link roads will affect 21 townships, 61 administrative\n3.\nvillages,  and  187  village  groups  in  6  counties:  Chongzuo,  Fushui,  Longzhou,  Ningming,\nPingxian and Yongning. According to the initial detailed resettlement plan survey, which is being\nupdated based on the changes proposed, nearly 1,200 hectares (ha) of land will be acquired, 65\npercent  of  which  is  cultivated  land,  comprising  paddy  (15  percent),  with  the  remaining  85\npercent  including  dry  fields,  vegetables,  and  sugarcane.  Other  identified  assets  on  the  land\ninclude  telecommunications  and  electrical  infrastructure,  ponds  for  fish  and  lotus  cultivation,\nsheds,  walls,  graves,  and  economic  trees.  The  assets  will  all  be  compensated  for  at\nreplacement  value.  Approximately  196  ha  of  land  will  be  borrowed  temporarily  during\nconstruction.  Land  acquisition  will  directly  affect  an  estimated  30,600  people  in  about  6,440\nhouseholds.  However,  given  the  relatively  high  farmland  per  capita  ratios,  which  range  from\n0.10  ha  per  person  in  Ningming  to  0.18  ha  per  person  in  Chongzuo,  the  number  of  people\nrequiring  full  economic  rehabilitation,  defined  as  losing  their  share  of  farmland,  is  likely  to  be\nless than 10,000.\n\n4.\nAbout  14,000  square  meters  of  structures,  including  houses,  will  be  demolished,\nnecessitating  relocation  of  about  200  households  and  1,100  people.  The  households  will\ngenerally be moved a short distance to another site within the same administrative village.\n\nC. \n\nPolicy Framework and Entitlements\n\n5.\nFor people unavoidably affected, the resettlement objective is to achieve equal, or better\nincome and living standards in line with the 1998 Land Law of the People's Republic of China\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 12, page 2\n\nand  ADB's  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement.  GCD  will  ensure  that  any  people  losing  land,\nhousing,  other  assets  or  income  will  be  assisted  to  restore  their  income  and  living  standards.\nGZAR in 2000 issued a directive to implement the 1998 Land Law to cover large infrastructure\nprojects,  with  the  land  compensation  set  at  7  times  the  annual  average  output  value  for\ncultivated  land,  and  the  resettlement  subsidy  will  be  5-14  times  the  value,  depending  on  the\naverage per capita farmland. These rates are within the range set by the 1998 Land Law. Given\nthe  average  yield  and  per  capita  farmland  in  the  region,  the  total  compensation  (land  and\nresettlement  subsidy)  will  be  set  between  185,000  and  225,000  yuan  per  ha  for  rice;  360,000\nand  540,000  yuan  per  ha  for  vegetable  land;  150,000  and  170,000  yuan  per  ha  for  dryland;\n550,000  and  630,000  yuan  per  ha  for  fish  pond;  and  170,000  and  220,000  yuan  per  ha  for\nsugarcane. People losing land temporarily for borrow sites will receive a payment equivalent to\nproduction  value  foregone,  for  the  period  of  loss,  expected  to  be  1-2  years.  The  land  used\ntemporarily will be restored to the owner in the original condition, or funds will be provided to the\nowner to restore the land to its original condition. For structures lost, replacement value will be\nprovided  to  the  affected  households.  Those  losing  housing  will  be  provided  with  a  free  new\nhousing  site  serviced  with  road,  electricity,  and  water  within  their  own  administrative  village.\nThere will be no depreciation for housing and people will be allowed to salvage materials from\ntheir old houses.\n\nD. \n\nResettlement Strategy\n\n6.\nEfforts  to  minimize  resettlement  effects  resulted  from  consultations  with  local  officials\nduring the setting of the alignment during the initial feasibility study. The amount of rice land to\nbe  acquired  was  kept  to  15  percent  of  the  total  agricultural  land  lost,  while  the  number  of\nrelocated  households  was  kept  to  approximately  200.  For  those  unavoidably  affected,  the\nresettlement  strategy  will  replace  losses  of  housing,  land,  other  assets,  infrastructure,  and\nincome.\n\nOver 95 percent of affected people are losing agricultural land. Most of these people will\n7.\nbe either reabsorbed back into agriculture, with the affected villages carrying out some village\nland  adjustment  to  ensure  that  village  members  still  have  sufficient  land  to  farm;  or  provided\nwith cash compensation to develop cash trees and nonfarm activities. The survey has identified\nvillage  groups  that  are  severely  affected,  through  losing  25  percent  of  their  land  or  more,  and\nwill  develop  options  for  improving  livelihoods  on  readjusted  agricultural  land.  These  options\ninclude,  for  example,  the  use  of  the  cash  compensation  to  enhance  irrigation  facilities  and\nextend  the  area  of  higher  producing  rice  land,  and  the  purchase  of  more  productive  crop\nvarieties, for example, sugarcane and marketable tree products such as star anise. Expressway\ncontractors  will  be  requested  to  give  priority  to  resettlement-affected  households  in  the\nallocation  of  unskilled  jobs  during  construction,  through  consultation  with  the  township  and\nvillage leaders.\n\n8.\nGCD  will  ensure  that  the  resettlement  entitlements  are  provided  to  the  people  affected\nbefore  ground  leveling  and  demolition  commence.  The  land  compensation  and  resettlement\nsubsidy will be paid to the villages affected. Housing compensation and compensation for young\ncrops and other assets will be provided directly to people losing those assets. Compensation for\ninfrastructure  such  as  electrical  and  communication  fixtures  will  be  paid  to  the  concerned\ndepartment.\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 12, page 3\n\nE. \n\nInstitutional Arrangements\n\n9.\nThe GZAR government will assume the responsibility for implementing the resettlement\naccording  to  the  agreed  resettlement  plan.  A  project  management  unit  (PMU)  within  GCD  will\ncoordinate  the  planning,  implementation,  financing,  and  reporting  of  land  acquisition  and\nresettlement  for  the  expressway  and  connector  roads.  GCD  is  responsible  for  any  land\nacquisition and resettlement for the complementary roads. By early April 2001, leading groups\nfor resettlement, each comprising 20 staff, had been be established within the affected counties.\nThe  county  offices  will  take  the  primary  responsibility  for  the  resettlement  consultation,\nimplementation, and timely delivery of entitlements.\n\nF. \n\nVulnerable Groups\n\n10.\nVulnerable  households  will  be  identified  during  final  survey  prior  to  implementation,\nincluding  those  below  the  poverty  line,  destitute  households,  and  households  headed  by\nwomen.  Under  the  resettlement  plan,  such  households  will  receive  special  attention  in  the\nrestoration  of  livelihood,  for  example,  through  preferential  unskilled  labor  opportunities,\nproviding they meet the other recruitment criteria. Those losing housing will also receive village\nassistance to construct a new house and are eligible for any ongoing welfare support, to which\nthey are already entitled from the village or the Civil Affairs Bureau.\n\nG. \n\nConsultation and Grievance Redress\n\nThe 1998 Land Law requires disclosure to and consultation with people affected. Some\n11.\nof the people affected have been notified about the key elements of the resettlement plan during\nmeetings and interviews. Further consultations will include meetings, arranged by township and\nvillage officials, on the specific impacts to be felt in each area and how they will be addressed.\nThe  people  losing  housing  will  have  be  offered  a  choice  of  housing  sites;  and  those  losing\nagricultural land will have the opportunity to consider suitable income replacement alternatives.\n\n12.\nIn early April 2001, an information booklet about the resettlement plan was distributed to\nall affected townships, and will be further distributed to the people affected through the peasant\neconomic collectives. The information booklet contains key information such as the resettlement\nscope; expected time frame; compensation rates for land and other assets; other assistance to\nreplace  assets,  housing,  and  incomes;  and  the  grievance  redress  mechanisms.  The  county,\ntownship,  and  village  officials  will  ensure  that  any  concerns  raised  by  the  people  affected  are\naddressed.\n\n13.\nIn case of grievance, people affected will submit their oral or written complaint first to the\nvillage  committee  or  the  township  resettlement  office.  The  village  committee  must  write  down\nany complaint presented orally. If a complaint is not settled in two weeks, the complainants can\nseek  redress  at  the  county  resettlement  office,  within  one  month.  If  the  matter  remains\nunresolved within two weeks, the PMU will try to achieve a solution. The final redress would be\nsought, if necessary, in the civil courts, in accordance with the Civil Procedures Act.\n\nH. \n\nMonitoring and Reporting\n\nA  monthly  reporting  system  is  being  established  in  the  PMU.  The  detailed  plan  for\n14.\ninternal and external monitoring and evaluation is currently being developed. GCD will engage a\nqualified independent social research agency, with experience in resettlement assessments, to\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 12, page 4\n\nconduct independent resettlement monitoring and evaluation. The purpose of this is to assess\nthe extent to which the people affected have received their entitlements on time, as well as to\nascertain the extent to which the resettlement objectives of full restoration of incomes and living\nstandards have been achieved. The monitoring and evaluation method includes the conduct of\na baseline study before the end of June 2001, to be followed by periodic survey updates at the\nend of years 1 and 2 and again after project completion. The survey will be conducted through\nhousehold  questionnaires,  on  a  statistically  valid  sample  of  those  affected.  The  survey  will\ninclude a significant number of those severely affected by loss of land, as well as those losing\nhousing, and will allow identification of the effects on the poor and vulnerable.\n\n15.\nThe  PMU  will  report  to  ADB  on  progress  in  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  through\nquarterly progress reports, and will submit periodic reports from the independent monitoring and\nevaluation agency.\n\nI. \n\nFinance and Implementation Schedule\n\nThe  cost  of  the  resettlement  is  estimated  at  Y321.7  million,  equivalent  to  about  $38.8\n16. \nmillion, for all costs including compensation, resettlement subsidy, payments for assets such as\nhousing,  fees,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Annual  adjustments  in  the  cost  estimates,\nincluding  compensation  rates,  will  be  made  based  on  the  inflation  rate  for  the  previous  year.\nGCD will supplement the resettlement budget if necessary to meet any shortfall to achieving the\nresettlement  objectives.  The  implementation  schedule  is  being  updated  for  the  revised\nresettlement plan based on the new construction timetable.\n\n\fAgency\n\nDate\n\nParticipants\n\nResponses\n\nAppendix 13\n\nPUBLIC CONSULTATIONS\n\n65\n\nNumber of\nPeople\n\n116\n\nXi\u2019an University\n(Environmental\nImpact\nAssessment\nTeam) and\nGuangxi\nCommunication\nDepartment\n\nXi\u2019an University\n(Resettlement\nPlan Team)\nand Guangxi\nCommunication\nDepartment\n\nJune 1998\nSeptember\n1999\n\nFarmers,\ncounty and\nvillage\ngovernments,\nand local\nenterprises\n\nSeptember\n1999\n\nResidents\nalong the\nproposed\nalignment\n\nFebruary\n2001\n\nHeavily\naffected\nvillages\n\nMay - July\n2000\n\nFebruary -\nApril 2001\n\nTechnical\nAssistance\nConsultants\nand Guangxi\nCommunication\nDepartment\n\nADB loan\nprocessing\nmissions and\nGuangxi\nCommunication\nDepartment\n\nCounty\ngovernment\nagencies,\nvillage heads,\nfarmers\n\nCounty\ngovernments\nand residents\nalong the\nalignment\n\n796\n\n158\n\n150\n\n80\n\n1.

The expressway also crosses two townships in\nYongning  County  (Suxu  and  Wuxu)  just  outside  Nanning  City.  These  have  been  included\nwherever statistical data permits. The PIA is the appropriate area to examine the impacts of the\nProject as a whole. Clearly part of the population that will be impacted by the construction of the\nexpressway is not based in the identified areas. This part of the client population includes long\ndistance passengers and drivers who pass through the PIA or who only stay temporarily within\nthe  area.  It  also  includes  nonresident  freight,  bus,  and  goods  distribution  enterprises  that\narrange  for  the  transportation  of  goods  and  people  in,  out,  and  through  the  PIA.  Vietnamese\nfarmers and traders are also in this broad group.\n\nB. \n\nPoverty Trends\n\n2.\nPoverty levels in the project area have decreased considerably in recent years as they\nhave  done  throughout  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  Since  1985,  changes  in  the\npoverty  situation  in  the  PIA  have  arisen  as  a  result  of  three  principal  factors:  (i)  changes  in\neconomic activity, (ii) improvements in infrastructure, and (iii) other initiatives.\n\nChanges  in  Economic  Activity.  The  most  important  change  in  production  in  terms  of\n3.\nimpact on the rural areas is almost certainly the increase in sugar cultivation. Production in 1998\nin the PIA was around 7 million tons, a 9-10 fold increase over production in 1985. The PIA now\nproduces  almost  17  percent  of  the  total  Guangxi  Zhuang  Autonomous  Region  (GZAR)\nproduction  and  6  percent  of  total  PRC  production.  Sugar  refineries  are  the  most  important\nindustries  of  the  PIA.  The  companies  purchase  all  sugar  products  locally  at  a  fixed  price\ndetermined by the Government.1 Fruit production has also increased dramatically (the cultivated\narea has increased 10-fold) as has vegetable cultivation in areas with good access to the urban\nareas,  especially  Nanning  City.  Other  important  factors  have  been  the  rapid  increase  in\ncrossborder trade, urbanization in the county towns, and remittances from temporary migration\nto the large cities of the eastern PRC.\n\nImprovements  to  Infrastructure.  In  parallel  with  the  increases  in  productive  capacity,\n4.\nthere  have  been  major  improvements  to  infrastructure.  Water  supply  has  been  improved\nthrough  the  construction  of  reservoirs,  irrigation  and  wells,  extensive  road  improvements,\nexpansion  of  rural  electrification  to  most  villages,  and  construction  and  expansion  of  schools\nand health facilities.\n\n5.\nOther Initiatives. These include (i) promotion of temporary migration to the large cities\nof  the eastern PRC,  which has increased rural incomes through remittances; (ii) a program to\nresettle  residents  of  the  most  inaccessible  and  least  productive  areas  (e.g.,  Tiandeng  and\nMashan)  to  more  favorable  locations;  and  (iii)  considerable  expansion  of  technical  assistance\nand farmer\u2019s credit.\n\n                                     \n1  This might change with the PRC\u2019s entrance in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the influx of cheaper farm\nproducts from abroad. The PRC\u2019s Government commitment to the protection of the rural sector is one of the key\nunresolved issues regarding the PRC\u2019s entry in the WTO.\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 14, page 2\n\n6.\nThe  combination  of  favorable  economic  circumstances,  direct  investment  by  the\ngovernment, extensive technical advice and credit, and the willingness and ability of farmers to\ninnovate  and  join  together  for  community  projects,  has  resulted  in  a  positive  change  in  the\nsituation of the absolute poor of the PIA. Only 14 townships are now poor, compared with over\n30 in 1985. Table A14.1 indicates the current poverty levels in the PIA.2 The table shows that\nthe PIA has a poverty incidence of about 9 percent.\n\nTable A14.1: Poverty Incidence in the PIA\n\nPoverty Incidence Number of Poor\n\nArea\nWuxu\nFusui\nChongzuo\nNingming\nPingxiang\nLongzhou\nPIA\nGZAR\nGZAR = Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, PIA = project influence area.\nSource: Poverty Alleviation Office, Nanning Prefecture and Consultant\u2019s estimates.\n\nPopulation\n122,000\n405,000\n329,000\n388,000\n100,000\n267,000\n1,611,000\n47,609,000\n\n10.0%\n6.0%\n8.0%\n9.0%\n8.0%\n15.0%\n9.0%\n6.3%\n\n12,200\n24,300\n26,320\n34,920\n8,000\n40,050\n144,990\n3,008,900\n\n7.\nA  high  percentage  of  people  have  an  average  income  just  slightly  above  the  Y1,000\nannual income level. Based  on  an income distribution analysis, approximately one third of the\nGZAR and PIA population earns an annual income between Y1,500 and Y2,000, and therefore\nis still vulnerable to shocks and economic fluctuations that could drag them into poverty.\n\nC. \n\nImpact on Women and Ethnic Minorities\n\n1.\n\nWomen\n\nThe  full  participation  of  women  in  the  economic  and  political  life  of  rural  areas  implies\n8.\nthat,  to  a  very  great  extent,  project  benefits  will  accrue  to  women  as  much  as  to  men.  This  is\ncertainly true for benefits arising from improved access. Although women\u2019s role in construction\nworks  is  estimated  at  15  percent  of  the  overall  labor  employment,  women  will  be  given  equal\nopportunities  and  pay  for  construction  and  operation  work  during  project  implementation,  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development.\n\n2.\n\nMinorities\n\n9.\nThe PIA population is dominantly the Zhuang minority who are fully assimilated into the\nmainstream economy. Zhuang dominance in the PIA is more pronounced that in the province as\na  whole;  over  80  percent  as  against  61  percent.  Consequently,  project  benefits  will  largely\naccrue to this group. In the PIA, although there are some Han villages, the majority of the Han\npeople tend to reside in the urban areas. The other minorities mostly live in hilly and peripheral\nareas  in  small  natural  villages.  There  is  only  one  Yao  dominated  administrative  village  in  the\nPIA, Fenglui, in the south of Ningming County. A large proportion of the small Yao population\nwill be affected by the construction of a new access road. The Yao population will benefit from\n\n                                     \n2  Based on an annual income level of Y1,000 per capita.\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 14, page 3\n\nthe  new  access  through  increased  economic  activity  and  improved  social  and  physical\ninfrastructure and such access will not adversely affected their cultural identity.\n\nD. \n\nSocial and Poverty-Related Project Features\n\n10.\nSocial  and  poverty  considerations  have  been  an  integral  part  of  the  project  design.\nThrough the complementary road program and the social and poverty measures, the Project will\nbenefit  local  people,  especially  the  poor,  by  addressing  their  needs  and  requests  and  by\nincreasing their economic opportunities.\n\n1.\n\nComplementary Road Program\n\nThroughout GZAR and the project area are numerous examples of how improvements to\n11.\nroad  access  have  led  to  increased  incomes  and  improvements  in  the  living  conditions  of\npreviously  poor  communities.  The  expressway  will  instigate  some  of  these  beneficial\nconsequences,  particularly  to  villages  near  the  interchanges.  A  complementary  road  program\ndirectly targeting the poorest areas of the PIA has been formulated to spread these benefits to\nthe remaining concentrations of poor households further away from the expressway corridor.\n\n12.\nBecause  of  major  road  construction  efforts  in  recent  years,  the  great  majority  of\nadministrative  villages  are  now  accessible  by  road.  However  many  village  roads  are\nsubstandard  and  poorly  maintained,  show  signs  of  rapid  deterioration,  and  are  becoming\nimpassable  during  bad  weather.  The  complementary  road  program  has  been  explicitly\nformulated to improve access to poor and recently poor townships and villages in the PIA. As a\nresult  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  policy  dialogue  and  through  discussions  with\ngovernment  officials  and  county  officials  and  field  surveys,  road  segments  were  prioritized  to\nbenefit  the  poor  in  the  PIA.  The  proposed  program  (Appendix  7)  involves  improving  978\nkilometers  of  roads,  providing  all-weather  access  to  more  than  80  villages.  Nearly  all\nsettlements  served  are  currently  defined  as  poor  or  have  only  recently  exceeded  the  official\npoverty line.\n\n2.\n\nSocial and Poverty Measures\n\n13.\nDuring the preconstruction phase, three measures will be implemented. (i) A summary of\nthis social analysis in Chinese, together with other general information about the Project, will be\ncirculated to county governments and other relevant agencies to promote discussion and so that\nthey  can  develop  measures  to  maximize  the  potential  benefits  arising  from  the  NanYou\nExpressway.  (ii)  Entrepreneurs  along  the  national  highway  (NH)  322  will  be  given  information\ndescribing  the  construction  schedule  of  the  expressway  and  the  likely  impact  on  traffic  flows\nalong  this  road  in  order  to  avoid  unsound  investment.  (iii)  Where  townships  will  be  near\ninterchanges, county and township officials, with the full participation of local entrepreneurs, will\ndevelop  land  use  plans  for  attractive  road  service  areas  just  off  the  expressway.  Where\nappropriate, these areas will include marketing points for local farmers to sell their produce to\noutside  traders.  Entrepreneurs  on  NH  322  will  be  given  priority  in  the  allocation  of  sites  so\ndeveloped.\n\n14.\nDuring construction, three measures will be implemented. (i) Companies involved in civil\nworks for the expressway will maximize the employment of the poor, in particular for unskilled\nlabor. Teams of poor laborers will be recruited though the Poverty Alleviation and Development\nOffice and the All-China Women\u2019s Federation. The two agencies will identify appropriate team\nleaders  in  poor  natural  villages  in  the  project  area  and  train  them  on  their  rights  and\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 14, page 4\n\nresponsibilities,  labor  law,  and  other  issues  as  deemed  necessary.  Team  leaders  will,  for\nexample,  be  responsible  for  keeping  records  of  the  names  of  people  working  in  their  teams,\ntheir salaries, and the working time. The team leaders will then select a labor team from poor\nhouseholds in their natural villages. (ii) The following clause, or a similar one, will be included in\nthe contracts agreed with all successful bidders: \u201cThe contractor will distribute to all employees\nand  casually-employed  laborers,  and  display,  in  prominent  positions,  advice  concerning  the\nnature,  dangers,  and  transmission  of  sexually  transmitted  diseases  (especially  HIV/AIDS)  and\ninformation concerning precautionary measures. This material will be obtained directly from the\nMinistry  of  Health  or  supplied  by  the  contracting  organization.  Similar  material  concerning  the\ndangers of drug use and the penalties associated with its possession and trafficking should be\ndistributed.\"  (iii)  Guangxi  Communications  Department  (GCD)  will  extend  procedures  for\ngrievance redress outlined in the resettlement plan (Appendix 12) to include any issues between\ncontractors and local residents relating to the construction of the scheme.\n\n15.\nOnce  the  expressway  is  open,  the  expressway  corporation  will  specifically  invite\nbusinesses  currently  located  along  NH  322  to  tender  for  service  area  concessions,  which  will\nform part of the expressway. The expressway corporation will employ as many residents from\nthe  directly  affected  villages  as  possible.  The  expressway  corporation  will  prominently  display\nmaterial about HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases in rest rooms and service areas and\nconsideration will be given to selling condoms in the service areas. GCD will also assist county\ngovernments  in  carrying  out  road  improvements  and  traffic  routing  measures  where  heavy\ngoods  traffic  from  the  expressway  has  a  detrimental  impact  on  existing  roads  and  the\nenvironment of frontage properties.\n\n3.\n\nPaid Labor\n\n16.\nLaborers working on the project roads will receive a salary based on market rates. The\nshare of labor budget will be reflected in semiannual progress report for each road segment and\nmonitored during project implementation.\n\nE. \n\nPoverty Impact Assessment\n\nThe following analysis focuses on the level of impact of the project roads on the lives of\n17.\nthe  poor.  Since  it  is  difficult  to  quantify  benefits  of  village  and  county  roads,  a  qualitative\nassessment  of  the  significance  of  the  benefits  was  undertaken.  The  analysis  concludes  that\nabout  135,000  of  the  1,050,000  people  directly  affected  by  the  Project  are  poor  and  that  the\nproposed  complementary  road  program  significantly  contributes  to  the  Project\u2019s  poverty\nreduction impact. To define the nature and extent of these potential benefits to the poor in the\nPIA, the assessment will focus on:\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nidentifying the number of poor who will directly benefit from the Project;\nidentifying the benefits likely to accrue from the Project;\ndistributing these benefits to the poor population; and\nquantifying the benefits (where possible).\n\n1.\n\nDirect and Indirect Beneficiaries\n\n18.\nBased  on  income  distribution  analysis,  surveys,  and  review  of  official  data,  the  poor\npopulation  within  the  PIA  is  estimated  to  include  145,000  people  (about  9  percent  of  the  total\nPIA population). While it is realistic to assume that, over time, some project benefits, however\nsmall  and  however  indirect,  will  accrue  to  the  majority  of  the  poor  population  of  the  PIA,  it  is\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 14, page 5\n\nessential  to  identify  groups  who  are  likely  to  benefit  more  directly  from  the  project  roads.  The\nfour  such  groups  are  (i)  residents  in  villages  that  will  be  served  by  the  complementary  road\nprogram, (ii) residents in villages adjacent to the NanYou expressway, (iii) residents adjacent to\nNH  322,  and  (iv)  the  urban  poor.  Table  A14.2  provides  estimates  of  the  total  and  poor\npopulation in each of these groups. Total populations are based on estimates done during the\nanalysis and the percentage of poor population derived from poverty proportions estimated by\ngenerating  income  distribution  using  average  income  for  each  category.  Double  counting  has\nbeen eliminated where possible.\n\nTable A14.2: Direct Project Beneficiaries\n\nItem\n\nTotal Population Poverty Incidence\n\nNumber of Poor\n\nVillage Residents a\nNanYou Expressway residents b\nNH 322 Residents\nUrban\nDirect Project Beneficiaries\nNH = national highway.\na Benefiting from complementary road program.\nb Excludes section west of Ningming where NanYou expressway parallels NH 322 and excluding residents benefiting\n\n420,000\n60,000\n280,000\n290,000\n1,050,000\n\n92,400\n6,000\n22,400\n14,500\n135,300\n\n22.0%\n10.0%\n8.0%\n5.0%\n12.9%\n\nfrom village road improvements.\n\nSource: Project Preparatory Technical Assistance.\n\nThe  data  show  that  approximately  135,000  poor  people  will  directly  and  immediately\n19.\nbenefit from the Project, accounting for about 13 percent of the total population directly affected\nby  the  Project.  The  data  also  shows  the  importance  of  the  complementary  road  program  in\nterms of overall impact of the project. The complementary road program will generate benefits\nas soon as individual schemes are completed, whereas benefits from the NanYou expressway\nwill only accrue after 2005 when the road is opened.\n\n2.\n\nIdentification of Benefits\n\n20.\nPotential  benefits  are  divided  into  income  and  nonincome  components.  The  former\ncorresponds to higher incomes flows while the latter includes improved living conditions, access\nto social and community services, and greater interaction with the outside world.\n\n21.\nIncome component. The income impacts of village and county road improvements can\nfurther  be  divided  into  direct  and  indirect  benefits.  The  direct  income  benefits  are  (i)  enabling\nfarmers  to  capture  an  increasing  proportion  of  the  value  added  by  reducing  the  costs  of\nmarketing;  (ii)  reduced  vehicle  operating  costs  (VOCs)  for  owners  of  tractors  and  other\nmotorized vehicles; (iii) higher agricultural productivity through a reduction in the transport cost\nof fertilizers and other inputs; (iv) farmers switching to higher value crops given their improved\naccess  to  markets  for  cash  crops;3  (v)  development  of  nonagricultural  economic  activity,\nespecially  transportation;  (vi)  direct  employment  opportunities  through  construction  labor;  and\n(vii) purchase of local construction materials. Indirect income benefits are less tangible. These\nessentially  involve  multiplier  and  trickle-down  effects  arising  from  the  Project  as  a  whole.  The\nmost  important  of  indirect  income  benefits  arise  from  increased  urbanization.

Nonincome  impacts  of  road  improvement  essentially  consist\nof  the  following.  (i)  Access  to  health,  schools,  and  other  community  facilities  will  facilitate  (a)\nattracting  resident  teachers  and  health  personnel  to  villages,  and  visits  by  specialists;  and  (b)\nvisiting by more remote people to the villages and such facilities. (ii) Improved access to villages\nfor  technical  personnel  and  local  officials  will  facilitate  agricultural  extension  and  visits  to\nimprove  communications  of  government  projects  and  address  grievances.  (iii)  Time  and  effort\ninvolved in routine tasks will be reduced, especially for travelling to the local market. (iv) Overall\ninteractions  between  villages  and  the  outside  world  will  increase.  (v)  The  safety,  environment,\nand ease of transportation along NH 322 will improve. The NanYou Expressway will lead to a\nmarked reduction of traffic along NH 322. Almost all through traffic will be removed, which will\nreduce  the  risk  of  accidents,  and  make  it  safer,  easier,  and  faster  for  local  traffic  and\npedestrians using NH 322.\n\n3.\n\nDistribution of Benefits\n\n23.\nTable  A14.3  provides  a  simplified  allocation  of  the  principal  benefits  to  each  group.  It\nalso  indicates  the  group/benefit  combinations  likely  to  be  the  most  significant  and  identifies\nbenefits that are quantifiable to some extent.\n\nTable A14.3: Allocation of Project Benefits to Categories of the Poor Population\n\nCategory of Poor\nPopulation\n\nDirecta\n\nIncome Impacts\n\nNonincome Impacts\n\nIncreased\nProductionb\n\nVOC\nSavings\n\nConstruction\nLaborc\n\nSales of\nConstruction\nMaterialsd\n\nIndirect\nMultiplier/\n\nTrickle-Down\nEffects\n\nAccess to\n\nSafety,\n\nServices\n\netc\n\nVillage Residents\n\nNanYou Expressway\nResidents\n\nNH 322 Residents\n\nUrban\n\nLess affected\n\nLSW\n\nLSW\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nE\n\nLSW\n\nLSW\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nLSW\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\n CS\n\nCS\n\nCS\n\nNo\n\nCS\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nLSW\n\nE\n\nE\n\nLSW\n\nLSW\n\nE\n\nNo\n\nE\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nLSW\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nCS = impact could be significant, E = impact is expected, LSW = impact likely to be significant and widespread, NH = national highway.\na\n\nb\n\nSome quantification may be possible for significant direct income impacts.\n  Whether through increased productivity, increased cash cropping, higher prices, non-agricultural activity.\n  Dependent on demand for local labor which may not be high; benefit will be transitory.\nd\nDependent on location of borrow sites; benefits will be transitory and highly localized.\n\nc\n\nSource: Consultants\u2019 estimates.\n\n4. \n\nQuantifiable Benefits\n\na.\n\nComplementary Road Program\n\nIncreased  Production.

This is equivalent to Y27 million per annum.\n\nEmployment.  During  construction,  the  Project  will  generate  direct  and  indirect\n26.\nemployment.  Employment  opportunities  will  be  generated  by  the  construction  of  507  km  of\ncomplementary road works, and a large share of unskilled jobs will be given to those below the\npoverty  line  living  in  the  PIA.  The  construction  of  class  II,  III,  and  IV  roads  will  require  and\nestimated  9,000  person-years  of  unskilled  labor.  This  is  estimated  to  provide  about  4,500\nperson-years of employment for unskilled poor laborers. Total additional income for these poor\nlaborers  is  estimated  to  be  around  Y30  million,  which  will  be  assured  by  the  covenant\nrequesting the payment of market-level wages for all laborers on the project roads.\n\nVOC Savings. As the use of the complementary road network is not charged, economic\n\n27.\nbenefits will be passed on in full. All village residents will benefit.\n\nb.\n\nExpressway and Connector Roads\n\n28.\nEmployment.  The  construction  of  the  expressway  and  connector  roads  will  require\nabout 25,000 person-years of unskilled labor and 15,000 person-years of skilled labor. A large\nshare  of  the  unskilled  jobs  will  be  given  to  those  living  below  the  poverty  line  (about  13,000\nperson-years).  Total  additional  income  for  these  poor  unskilled  laborers  is  estimated  around\nY100  million  during  the  construction  phase.  For  the  operation  of  the  expressway,  new\nemployees  will  be  recruited  from  within  the  PIA.  Those  below  the  poverty  line  will  acquire  at\nleast half of the permanent operational positions required.\n\n29.\nVOC  Savings.  Economic  benefits  (lower  transport  costs,  accidents,  etc.)  will  greatly\naffect consumers. Since the transport markets appear to be fairly competitive, most welfare gain\nwill  be  absorbed  by  consumers  rather  than  vehicle  owners.  Principal  beneficiaries  among  the\npoor will be bus passengers who are village residents. Also, some of the poor, both village and\nurban residents, will benefit from lower costs of transport by light and medium goods vehicles.\n\nConstruction Materials. Some local financial gain to owners of quarry sites and service\n\n30.\noutlets is expected. However the effect of such benefits on poor people is likely to be minor.\n\n\f73\n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS\n\nAppendix 15, page 1\n\n1.\nThe  proposed  expressway  has  four  principal  rationales:  (i)  to  link  the  National  Trunk\nHighway  System  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  to  National  Highway  1,  Viet  Nam\u2019s  north-\nsouth artery; (ii) to reduce congestion on the existing NH 322, which is currently congested and\nflows exceed design capacities in several locations\u2014expected economic growth and projected\nincome  elasticity  will  deter  some  travel  by  2005,  and  more  thereafter;  (iii)  to  provide  a  better\nalignment  that  will  (a)  reduce  the  distance  from  Nanning  to  Youyiguan  by  45  km,  leading  to\nexpected time savings in 2005 of 3.25 hours for goods and passenger vehicles; and (b) move\nthe  alignment  closer  to  the  principal  centers  of  population  in  the  corridor;  and  (iv)  to  foster\ncrossborder trade by reducing transport costs.\n\nThe  complementary  road  program  will  support  poverty  reduction.  The  program  will\n2.\nprovide  basic  all-weather  access  to  villages;  upgrade  deteriorated  village  roads;  and  improve\naccess  to  townships,  administrative  villages,  and  other  villages  directly  affected  by  the\nexpressway. It will facilitate effective distribution of expressway benefits. Although the program\nwill  reduce  transport  costs,  its  wider  role  is  that  of  fulfilling  an  essential  precondition  for\nimproved access to social and health services.\n\nA. \n\nValuation of Costs and Benefits\n\n1. \n\nBasis for Evaluation\n\n3.\nThe  basis  for  evaluation  of  the  expressway  and  Class  I/II  connecting  roads  is  a\ncomparison  of  the  Project  with  a  base  case.  The  base  case  incorporates  minimum\nimprovements  to  the  existing  highway  and  planned  improvements  to  the  remainder  of  the\nnetwork.  In  a  situation  where  demand  for  transport  is  growing  fast,  this  will  lead  to  some\njourneys being diverted to other roads and some being suppressed. In the \"with Project\" case\nthere  will  be  little  or  no  trip  suppression.  The  difference  between  the  two  equilibrium  levels  of\ntraffic is treated as generated traffic.\n\n4.\nQuantified evaluation of the complementary road program is based on a comparison of\nvehicle  operating  costs  (VOCs)  with  and  without  the  proposed  improvements.  Network  effects\nare  not  taken  into  account.  Other  unquantifiable  benefits  of  the  program  will  be  (i)  increased\nproduction  due  to  better  access  to  markets  and  agricultural  officers,  (ii)  increased  trading  and\ntransport  opportunities,  (iii)  improved  access  to  school  and  health  facilities,  and  (iv)  increased\naccess to other information.\n\nThe  evaluation  period  is  20  years  following  the  expected  opening  early  in  2005.  The\n\n5.\nbase case construction period is 40 months, from the end of 2001 to early 2005.\n\n2. \n\nCosts\n\n6.\nEconomic  costs  are  at  mid-2000  prices  and  are  expressed  in  domestic  currency.  For\ntradeable  items  an  exchange  rate  of  $1=Y8.28  and  a  shadow  exchange  factor  of  1.08  was\nused.  In  general,  equipment  was  tax  exempt  and  the  overall  conversion  factor  was  0.967;  a\nlower conversion factor of 0.9 was used for local road construction and maintenance costs.\n\n\f74\n\nAppendix 15, page 2\n\n3. \n\nBenefits\n\n7.\nThe main economic benefits generated by the Project are VOC savings, reduced travel\ntime,  and  accident  cost  savings  for  normal  traffic.  Half  of  the  VOC  benefits  accrued  to  the\ngenerated traffic are included as a proxy for willingness to pay. Other benefits included working\ncapital savings to freight in transit and resource cost savings arising from diversion from rail to\nroad.\n\n8.\n VOC savings were calculated for five vehicle types, taking into account the differences\nof terrain, road roughness, speed, and congestion. The economic costs of vehicles included in\nthe VOC savings are derived from international prices with a quality adjustment for domestically\nproduced  vehicles.  Parts,  fuel,  and  oil  were  also  calculated  based  on  the  current  international\nprices.  The  benefits  from  VOC  savings,  which  will  initially  accrue  to  vehicle  owners  and\noperators, will in the long term be passed on to users of transport services through reductions in\ntransport  rates  and  fares,  given  the  increasingly  competitive  nature  of  the  road  transport\nindustry in the project area.\n\n9.\nTravel  time  saving  will  be  enjoyed  by  the  traffic  on  the  project  expressway  and  the\nexisting roads. Saved travel time is valued using 70 percent of average after-tax salary for work-\nrelated trips only. Only 25 percent of bus passengers were assumed to be on work-related trips.\nNo value was assigned to leisure trips.\n\n10.\nThe  benefits  from  a  reduction  in  number  and  severity  of  accidents  constitute  an\nimportant  element  of  economic  benefits.  Accident  reductions  were  estimated  based  on  the\nfindings of a study on accidents carried out by the Highway Planning and Design Institute of the\nMinistry of Communications. The cost of property damage (Table A15.1) is high. Although the\neconomic  cost  of  accidents  is  higher  on  the  expressway  than  on  the  existing  roads,  with  the\nProject,  the  number  of  accidents  per  vehicle-kilometer  in  the  project  corridor  will  be  reduced\nsubstantially. Therefore, net cost saving will derive from avoided accident costs.\n\n11. Working  capital  savings  to  freight  in  transit  were  estimated  conservatively,  taking  only\nthe actual time saved, rather than assuming that (for example) a proportion of overnight stays\ncan be eliminated. The resource savings from diversion from rail to road are difficult to estimate\nbut are considered to be small. Most rail freight is commodities in bulk; the scope for diversion\nand  resource  cost  savings  is  negligible.  Substantial  diversion  of  passenger  traffic  is  expected.\nHowever,  the  railway  runs  at  well  below  capacity  and  marginal  costs  must  be  low.  Resource\ncost  savings  using  a  historic  rail  conversion  factor  and  derived  bus  VOCs  were  therefore\nreduced before inclusion in the evaluation.\n\nB. \n\nResults and Conclusion\n\n12.\nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project is 20.0 percent (Table A15.4).\nThe  EIRR  for  the  complementary  road  program  alone  is  22.7  percent.  VOC  savings  are  the\nmajor  economic  benefit,  accounting  for  76  percent,  followed  by  generated  traffic  (11  percent),\ntravel time savings (6 percent), local road component (4 percent), and accident cost savings (3\npercent).\n\nThe sensitivity of the EIRR to changes in significant and uncertain variables is shown in\n13.\nTable  A15.2.  Switching  values  are  identified.  The  project  EIRR  is  highly  robust  in  the  face  of\nadverse cost and benefit estimates. To reduce the EIRR to 12 percent would take:\n\n\f75\n\nAppendix 15, page 3\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nan increase in costs to about double the base case, or\na drop in benefits to 0.44 times the base case.\n\n14.\nTolls  affect  the  volume  of  traffic  on  the  expressway.  Economic  benefits  are  maximized\nwith no toll, as this allows the maximum number of vehicles to take advantage of the superior\ntravel conditions on the expressway. As expressway tolls increase, more drivers and operators\nwill  opt  to  use  other  routes.  This  effect  has  been  tested,  and  the  results  are  shown  in  Table\nA15.3. Below the base toll level, EIRRs are relatively insensitive to further changes in price (toll)\nlevel,  i.e.,  demand  for  expressway  travel  is  relatively  inelastic.

The\ninternational inflation rate used is 2.4 percent throughout the projection period.\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nB. \n\n2. \n\nThe project expressway financial projections are based upon the following assumptions:\n\nCorporate income tax1 is assessed against the expressway operating entity at 33\npercent of net profit per year.\n\nGovernment  grants  consist  of  equity  capital  contributed  by  Ministry  of\nCommunications and Guangxi Communications Department (GCD).\n\nThe grants  from  Ministry of Communications and GCD will be Y836 million and\nY777  million,  respectively  and  will  be  invested  during  the  first  five  years  of\nconstruction to cover initial deficits.\n\nThe toll rates expected to be levied to the project expressway are in 2000 prices\nand  based  upon  the  traffic  forecast  estimated  by  GCD  for  various  types  of\nvehicles (Table A16.1). Traffic volumes were forecast to increase by 7.3 percent\nper year during 2005-2015 and 6.8 percent per year during 2016-2025.\n\nTable A16.1: Projected Toll Rates\n(Yuan per vehicle km)\n\nRoad Type\n\nVehicle Type\nSmall Passenger\nLarge Passenger/Medium Truck\nLarge Truck\nTruck with Trailer\nSource: The Price Control Bureau of the Guangxi Planning Committee.\n\nExpressway\n0.30\n1.00\n1.85\n2.60\n\nClass I\n0.25\n0.85\n1.60\n2.40\n\nThe  operating  and  maintenance  costs,  including  routine  maintenance  and\nenvironmental  monitoring,  are  Y10  million  per  year  in  mid-2000  prices.  Routine\nmaintenance  cost  will  amount  to  Y8.1  million  per  year.  The  operating  costs  are\nbased  on  a  staff  of  127  people  employed  at  toll  stations,  in  the  maintenance\nteams, and at the administrative offices. Annual salaries and benefits amount to\nan  average  of  Y10,500  per  employee.  Operating  costs  will  increase  in  line  with\ntraffic growth and domestic inflation. Maintenance costs will increase in line with\ndomestic inflation.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n                  \n1 Business Tax was abolished, effective 1 January 2001.\n\n\f78\n\nAppendix 16, page 2\n\n(vi) \n\nThe bank loans repayments will begin in 2006. The interest rate charged on the\nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  loan  was  estimated  at  4.51  percent,  based  on\nthe  six-month  LIBOR  in  US  dollars  in  June  2001,  and  the  interest  rate  on  the\ndomestic loan is 6.21 percent. The commitment fee of 0.75 percent per year and\nthe 1.0 percent front-end fee for the ADB loan are also included.\n\nC. \n\nSummary of Financial Statements\n\nThe projected financial statements in Tables A16.2 to A16.4 indicate that the expected\n3. \nrevenues at the rates proposed are sufficient to cover the operating costs and debt repayments\non the ADB and domestic loans. The debt-to-equity ratio of much less than 65:35 from the first\nyear  of  the  expressway  construction  and  the  decreasing  of  the  debt-to-equity  ratios  thereafter\nindicates a sound financial condition for the expressway under the proposed financing plan. The\nreturn  on  equity  will  be  positive  from  the  beginning  of  operations.  This  ratio  indicates  that\nGuangxi Expressway Management Company, which will be created to operate the expressway,\ncan  sustain  a  totally  commercial  operation  from  year  2005,  if  GCD  decides  to  privatize  the\nexpressway operation in the future.\n\n\fTable A16.2:  Income Statement for Nanning-YouYiGuan Expressway\n(current Y million)\n\n         Million Yuan in Calendar Year (current prices)\n\nItem\n\n2000 2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2015\n\n2020\n\n2025\n\nTotal Operating Costs\nPretax Operating Profit/(Loss) before Capital Charges\n\n8.2\n238.3\n\n11.3\n347.6\n\n11.9\n376.0\n\n12.6\n406.3\n\n13.3\n438.7\n\n14.1\n547.8\n\n14.9\n591.6\n\n18.7\n926.5\n\n24.7\n  \n1,490.6\n\n32.2\n2,396.8\n\n   \n\nProportion of Full Year's Revenue \n1.

They cover a period of 24 years, comprising 4 years of\nconstruction (2001 to 2005) and 20 years of operation (2006 to 2025).\n\n(ii) \n\nThe FIRR was calculated after corporate income tax.\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\nCapital  costs  include  all  incremental  capital  expenditures  related  to  the\nconstruction  and  equipment  of  the  project  expressway,  but  exclude  price\ncontingency provisions and interest during construction.\n\nOperation and maintenance costs include all incremental costs for operating the\nproject expressway, but exclude depreciation provisions.\n\nOperating revenues were projected based on forecast traffic for the toll rates for\nall  vehicle  types  in  real  terms.  The  toll  rates  were  applied  to  the  whole  project\nexpressway in real terms during the period of analysis. The traffic volumes have\ntaken  into  account  vehicles  that  are  exempt  from  tolls,  such  as  military,\nemergency, and public security vehicles.\n\n2. \nThe  results  of  the  financial  evaluation  for  the  project  expressway  including  the  cost  of\ncomplementary  roads  show  an  FIRR  in  real  terms  of  9.0  percent  after  corporate  income  tax\n(Table  A17.1).  This  is  higher  than  the  real  after  tax  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  for  the\nProject  estimated  at  3.1  percent.  Sensitivity  analysis  of  the  financial  return  was  carried  out  to\ntest  the  effects  of  several  scenarios  on  key  parameters  that  determine  costs  and  revenues\n(Table A17.2). The FIRR after tax varies between 4.8 and 11.1 percent, which is always above\nthe after tax weighted average cost of capital. The Project is shown to be most sensible to the\ntoll revenue stream and capital costs and the delay in completion. An increase of 20 percent in\ncapital costs will decrease the FIRR to 7.5 percent and a decrease of 20 percent in revenues\nwill  decrease  the  FIRR  to  6.5  percent,  and  a  one-year  delay  in  construction  will  decrease  the\nFIRR to 8.3 percent. Under the most adverse scenario (one-year delay; capital, operation, and\nmaintenance  costs  higher  by  20  percent;  and  revenues  lower  by  20  percent)  the  FIRR  would\ndecrease to 4.8 percent. A devaluation of the yuan by 30 percent would reduce the FIRR to 8.1\npercent. The financial evaluation without complementary roads shows an FIRR of 9.7 percent in\nreal terms.\n\n\f 83\n\nAppendix 17, page 2\n\nTable A17.1 Financial Internal Rate of Return\n(Yuan million)\n\nYear\n\nCapital \nInvestment\n\nGross        \n\nRevenue\n\nNet Cash \nFlow\n\nCorporate \nIncome Tax\n\nOperating \nand \nMaintenance \nCosts\n\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\n\n299.7\n           \n931.7\n           \n919.5\n           \n928.1\n           \n           \n191.6\n               \n-\n               \n-\n               \n-\n               \n-\n               \n-\n               \n-\n               \n-\n               \n-\n               \n-\n             \n87.8\n               \n-\n-\n               \n               \n-\n               \n-\n               \n-\n               \n-\n               \n-\n               \n-\n               \n-\n       \n(1,308.2)\n\n-\n           \n           \n-\n-\n           \n-\n           \n           \n7.3\n         \n10.1\n         \n10.4\n         \n10.6\n         \n10.9\n         \n11.2\n         \n11.5\n         \n11.8\n         \n12.1\n         \n12.4\n         \n12.7\n         \n13.0\n         \n13.3\n         \n13.7\n         \n14.0\n         \n14.4\n         \n14.7\n         \n15.1\n         \n15.5\n         \n15.9\n         \n16.3\n\n           \n-\n           \n-\n           \n-\n           \n-\n        \n214.6\n        \n298.0\n        \n310.4\n        \n323.3\n        \n336.8\n        \n406.6\n        \n423.5\n        \n441.2\n        \n459.5\n        \n478.6\n        \n584.4\n        \n606.0\n        \n628.5\n        \n651.7\n        \n675.8\n        \n812.5\n        \n842.6\n        \n873.8\n        \n905.6\n        \n939.7\n     \n1,128.2\n\n     \n     \n     \n     \n         \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n    \n\n(299.7)\n(931.7)\n(919.5)\n(928.1)\n15.6\n287.9\n300.0\n312.7\n325.9\n395.5\n412.1\n429.4\n447.5\n466.3\n483.9\n593.0\n615.1\n638.0\n661.8\n798.1\n827.8\n858.7\n890.1\n923.7\n2,420.1\n\n8.9\n15.6\n22.4\n29.3\n54.7\n63.0\n71.2\n79.5\n88.0\n153.8\n163.6\n172.6\n181.9\n191.4\n238.0\n250.2\n261.7\n273.5\n285.7\n349.2\n\nNet Cash \nFlow After \nCorporate \nIncome Tax\n\n       \n       \n       \n       \n          \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n(299.7)\n(931.7)\n(919.5)\n(928.1)\n15.6\n279.0\n284.4\n290.3\n296.6\n340.8\n349.1\n358.2\n368.0\n378.3\n330.1\n429.4\n442.5\n456.1\n470.4\n560.1\n577.6\n597.0\n616.6\n638.0\n2,070.9\n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return after Corporate Income Tax:\n\n9.0%\n\nSource: Staff estimates.\n\n\f 84\n\nAppendix 17, page 3\n\nTable A17.2: Sensitivity Analysis\n\nCase\n\nBase Case\n\nChanges in Capital Costs\nPlus 20%\nPlus 10%\nMinus 10%\nMinus 20%\n\nChanges in Revenues\nMinus 20%\nMinus 10%\n\nChanges in Operating and Maintenance Costs\nPlus 10%\nPlus 20%\n\nProject Delayed by 1 Year\n\nCombined Changes\nCapital Costs plus 20%, Revenues minus 20%\nCapital Costs plus 10%, Revenues minus 10%\nProject delayed 1 Year, Capital Costs plus 10%\n10% and Revenues minus 10%, and O&M plus 10%\nProject delayed 1 Year, Capital Costs plus\n20% and Revenues minus 20%, and O&M plus 20%\nCurrency Devaluation by 30%\nFIRR=financial internal rate of return, O&M=operating and maintenance.\n\nSource: Staff estimates.\n\nFIRR\n\n9.0%\n\n7.5%\n8.2%\n10.0%\n11.1%\n\n6.5%\n7.8%\n\n9.0%\n9.0%\n\n8.3%\n\n5.2%\n7.1%\n\n6.5%\n\n4.8%\n8.1%\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 31 August 2001)\n", "Currency Unit\nY1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013\n=\n=\n", "Yuan (Y)\n$0.1208\nY8.2767\n", "The  exchange  rate  of  the  renminbi  yuan  is  determined  under  a  floating  exchange  rate\n", "system.
