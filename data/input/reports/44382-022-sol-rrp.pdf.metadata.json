Solomon  Islands  is  one  of  the  largest  countries  in \nMelanesia, with a land area of about 28,000 square kilometers. The country comprises six large \nislands,  dozens  of  smaller  islands,  and  hundreds  of  islets  and  atolls.  About  85%  of  the \npopulation of  550,000  lives in rural  areas  spread  across the  islands,  living in widely  dispersed \nvillages,  most  of  which  have  a  few  hundred  inhabitants.  The  economy  is  based  on  primary \ncommodities from agriculture, forestry, and fishing; alternative income-generating opportunities \nare scarce, especially in rural areas. \n \n3. \nDisparity and isolation. Solomon Islands has the second-lowest average income in the \nregion,  with an  estimated gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  per capita  of  $1,347  in 2010 (current \nprices).  Income  distribution  is  uneven,  with  rural  expenditure  levels  significantly  below \nexpenditure levels in urban areas. Social indicators are improving, but remain among the worst \nin the region. Electricity, water, transport, and telecommunication services are not available to a \nlarge  percentage  of  the  population.2 Lack  of  access  to  markets  and  services,3 combined  with \nhigh transport and communication costs, leaves much of the geographically isolated portion of \nthe country economically isolated from national and regional markets.4 These factors also limit \nprovision of access to basic services, a situation which is exacerbated by the lack of affordable, \nfast  and  reliable  data  traffic.  Investments  in  submarine  cables  for  the  smaller  islands  of  the \nPacific  have  meanwhile  been  limited,  primarily  due  to  (i)  the  requirement  for  large  up-front \ncapital investments, (ii) a long period of return on investments, and (iii) the inability of the small \nprivate sector to mobilize the large investment that is required. \n \n4. \nExpected  benefits  from  broadband  connectivity.  Such  constraints  to  economic  and \nto  more  affordable \nsocial  development  can  be  mitigated  by \ntelecommunications,  particularly  high-speed  (broadband)  internet,  that  offers  new  economic \nopportunities domestically, as well as connections to larger markets, and new avenues for  the \ndelivery  of  key  social  services.5 In  addition  to  the  expected  positive  socioeconomic  impact  in \nSolomon Islands, improved broadband connectivity  is also expected to increase the frequency \nand quality of communications among the countries in the region, facilitating a growth in trade-\nrelated services such as tourism and back-office functions. A recent World Bank study indicates \nthat a 10% increase in broadband penetration results in a 1.38% increase in GDP growth in low- \nand  middle-income  countries. 6  Such  impacts  result  from  (i)  reduced  transaction  costs  for \nbusiness, government, and household communications; (ii) new business opportunities such as \n\nimproved  access \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The project is phase 2 of the Pacific Regional Information \nand  Communications  Project,  which  seeks  to  improve  connectivity  in  selected  Pacific  countries.  Under  phase  1, \nADB  and  the  World  Bank  supported  the  development  of  a  submarine  cable  system  (SCS)  linking  Tonga  to  Fiji \n(ADB 2011. Tonga-Fiji Submarine Cable Project. Manila). \n\n2  Solomon Islands has also been identified as a core fragile state since 2007. \n3   Government of Solomon Islands. 2011. National Development Strategy, 2011\u20132020.

As an immediate result \nof  the  SCS,  wholesale  bandwidth  prices  are  expected  to  halve,  leading  to  a  conservatively \nestimated retail price reduction of 20%. \n \nTelecommunications market.  Solomon Islands introduced a second mobile operator in \n5. \n2010, and competition has already resulted in a 29% reduction in mobile telephony prices and \nan  improvement  in  the  quality  of  services.  7  Access  to  affordable,  good  quality  broadband \ninternet-based  services,  however,  has  so  far  remained  out  of  reach  (Table  1).  The  limited \ncapacity and high cost of international bandwidth is caused by a total dependence on satellite \nconnectivity,  which  is  also  the  principal  constraint  to  higher  broadband  penetration,  the \nintroduction of new telecommunications services, and new market entrants. \n \n\n \n\nTable 1: Market Indicators \n2009 \n\n2011 \n\n \n57,000 \n11 \n10 \n \n1,276 \n<1 \n\n \n274,872  \n53 \n67 \n \n21,133  \n4 \n\n Item \nMobile network \nSubscribers \nPenetration rate (%) \nNetwork coverage (%) \nInternet / broadband \nSubscribers  \nPenetration rate (%) \nSource: Telecommunications Commission of Solomon Islands. 2012. Annual Report 2011. Honiara. \n \nThe  2012  wholesale  price  for  two-way  satellite  capacity  is  roughly  $3,600  per  megabit \n6. \nper  second  (Mbps)  per  month.  With  normal  growth,  bandwidth  demand  in  Solomon  Islands  is \nprojected  to  increase  to  1.243  gigabits  per  second  (Gbps)  by  2032.  It  would  be  impossible  to \nmeet  the  growing  demand  using  the  current  satellite  capacity  and  price.  The  submarine  cable \nsystem  (SCS)  will  provide  substantially  higher  initial  capacity  of  10  Gbps  and  is  expected  to \nreduce  international  connectivity  costs  by  more  than  60%.8 In  2012,  the  cheapest  broadband \ninternet  subscription  costs  roughly  $60  per  month,  which  is  about  28%  of  average  monthly \nincome (approximated using GDP per capita in 2010).  \n \n7. \nGovernment  policy  and  strategy.  Following  endorsement  of  the  government\u2019s  debt \nmanagement strategy in June 2012, Solomon Islands is resuming its first borrowing since 2005. \nThe government considers the SCS a national asset and an immediate investment priority, thus \nrecognizing  the  potentially  significant  contribution  that  improved  broadband  connectivity  can \nmake  in  addressing  the  constraints  imposed  by  geographic  and  economic  isolation,  and \npromoting  inclusive  growth. 9 The  Government  is  currently  developing  a  national  ICT  strategy, \nwhich is expected to be adopted by 31 December 2013. \n \n8. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB), development partner, and private sector support. \nSupporting  inclusive  growth  and  investment  in  information  and  communication  technology  are \nimportant elements of ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach (which provides broad operational focus) and the \ncountry operations business plan, 2012\u20132014 for Solomon Islands.10 ADB\u2019s sovereign financing \nhas  leveraged  roughly  $33  million  of  commercial  financing  for  the  Solomons  Oceanic  Cable \n                                                \n7  Telecommunications Commission of Solomon Islands. 2012.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fCompany  (SOCC),  thereby  minimizing  public  debt  liabilities.  ADB\u2019s  investment  support  is \ncomplemented  by  World  Bank  technical  assistance  to  support  the  Telecommunications \nCommission  of  Solomon  Islands,  which  has  regulatory  responsibility  for  telecommunications, \nand the Ministry of Communication and Aviation, which is developing a national ICT strategy.11  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n9. \nThe impact will be increased broadband-based economic opportunities, and broadband-\nbased  improvements  in  the  inclusive  delivery  of  social  services.  The  outcome  will  be  that  the \npopulation  of  Solomon  Islands  increasingly  uses  good  quality  broadband  internet  services  at \naffordable prices.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\n10. \nThe  output  will  be  a  fully  operational  Solomon  Islands  SCS,  linked  to  an  existing \ninternational  submarine  cable  network  that  runs  between  Guam  and  Sydney  (PIPE  Pacific \nCable  1,  or  PPC-1).12   An  international  spur13 into  Guadalcanal  (landing  in  Honiara)  and  two \ndomestic  spurs  linking  Guadalcanal  with  Malaita  (landing  in  Auki)  and  the  Western  Province \n(landing  in  Noro)  will  have  jointly  opened  telecommunications  access  to  roughly  72%  of  the \ncountry\u2019s population. The SCS is expected to be ready for service by December 2013, operated \nby the SOCC.  \n  \nD. \n \nThe project is estimated to cost $60 million.14 The financing is structured to include Asian \n11. \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) loan and grant funds, commercial financing, and equity brought in by \nSOCC.  ADB  sovereign  financing  and  SOCC  equity  cover  about  50%  of  the  total  financing \nrequired for  the  project, while  SOCC  is  in  an  advanced  stage  of negotiations  over  commercial \ndebt  financing.  The  investment  plan  is  summarized  in  Table  2.  Detailed  cost  estimates  by \nexpenditure category and by financier are in the project administration manual.15  \n \n12.  \nTo demonstrate the government priority and commitment to foster the private sector led \noperation  of  the  SCS,  and  to  help  leverage  the  required  commercial  funds,  the  government \nrequested  a  loan  from  the  ADB  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights \n(SDR) 6,997,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project. The loan will \nhave  a  32-year  term,  including  a grace  period  of  8 years,  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum \nduring  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions \nset  forth  in  the  draft  financing  and  project  agreements.  Under  the  recently  endorsed  debt \nmanagement  strategy, 16  Solomon  Islands  can  only  afford  to  take  on  limited  borrowing. \nTherefore,  the  government  has  also  requested  a  grant  not  exceeding  $7.5  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources to help finance the project. The financing plan is in Table 3. \n \n\n                                                \n11 As anchored in the Telecommunications Act, 2009. \n12 Submarine Cable Map. http://www.submarinecablemap.com/  \n13  PIPE  Networks  (the  owners  of  PPC-1)  have  confirmed  in  writing  that  connecting  the  international  spur  must \ncoincide with repair work on PPC-1 for which the cable needs to be lifted (scheduled for July 2013).  Consequently, \nnot meeting this timeline poses a major risk to the project, including the economic loss of existing investments.  \n14 Inclusive of $6.3 million taxes and duties on capital goods, which is expected to be exempted by the government.  \n15  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Government  of  Solomon  Islands,  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Treasury.  2012.

SOCC  was \n\n                                                \n17 Exclusive  of the following  non-core  project  funding:  (i)  Senior  Secured  Loan of  $2  million  (Debt  Service  Reserve \nAccount); (ii) Senior Secured Loan of $1 million (Maintenance Reserve Account); (iii) Senior Secured Contingent \nConstruction Facility of $3 million); and (iv) Senior Secured Revolving Working capital Facility of $1 million), all of \nwhich will be financed through the commercial debt component. Transport and insurance costs may be financed by \nADB. \n\n18 The  draft  terms  and  conditions,  which  are  subject  to  ADB  endorsement,  are  (i)  4%  interest  over  the  loan \ncomponent; (ii) 1.5% interest over the grant component; (iii) 25-year payback period, inclusive of a grace period of \n8 years. This will be formalized in a subsidiary loan agreement between the Ministry of Finance and Treasury and \nSOCC. \n\n19 The financing plan is firm in terms of its structure, and negotiations between the prospective commercial financiers, \nMoFT  and  SOCC  are  at  an  advanced  stage  (a  signed  common  term  sheet  is  expected  to  be  in  place  by  14 \nSeptember). Financial closing of the commercial lending is expected by the end of November, 2012. \n\n\fincorporated  under  the  Companies  Act,  2009  on  15  September  2011. 20 SOCC  is  currently \nowned  by  the  Solomon  Islands  National  Provident  Fund  and  Solomon  Telekom  Company \nLimited.

SOCC is \ngoverned  by  a  board  comprising  four  directors,  and  currently  led  by  a  chief  executive  officer \n(CEO) with a long experience in the submarine cable industry (including 10 years as CEO of the \nAustralia\u2013Japan Cable). The board is currently assisted by an experienced financial adviser (a \nformer ANZ staff member). A core SOCC team\u2014consisting of the CEO, a head of engineering, \nand an office manager\u2014will be based in Honiara to manage network construction and establish \nongoing  marketing  and  operations.  Once  a  stable  operating  environment  is  established,  the \nCEO role will be merged with the head of engineering. The following operational and business \nfunctions  will  be  outsourced:  marine  maintenance,  the  Network  Operations  Centre,  landing \nstation management, project management, information technology support, financial accounting, \nauditing and legal services.  \n\n \nThe  lack  of  an  established  procurement  unit  in  SOCC  poses  a  risk  to  the  project. \n16. \nMitigation measures include (i) intense support from ADB in the preparation of bid documents; \n(ii)  establishment  of  a  bid  evaluation  committee,  comprising  SOCC\u2019s  CEO  and  two  highly \n\n                                                \n20 Company Haus of Solomon Islands. http://www.companyhaus.gov.sb/app/viewInstance/413487 \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nexperienced  consultants  from  the  industry;  (iii)  strict  review  of  the  bid  evaluation  report  by  the \nADB; and (iv) the establishment of a records management system at SOCC. \n \n17. \nAdvance  action  will  be  required  for  procurement  of  the  indefeasible  right  of  use  (direct \nprocurement)  and the  domestic  spurs  (international  competitive  bidding).  Retroactive financing \nmay be required to ensure mobilization payments to the suppliers of the domestic spurs.  \n \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nThe insertion of a new branching unit on PPC-1 with a cable spur to Honiara has been \n18. \nselected  as  the  most  feasible  and  least-cost  international  option  (Table  5).  Landing  sites  in \nHoniara,  Noro,  and  Auki  were  selected  based  on  the  suitability  of  the  shoreline,  availability  of \nland,  and  minimum  disruption  to  the  marine  environment  and  human  activities.  The  cable \nlanding  stations  and  auxiliary  facilities  will  be  located  by  arrangement  with  Solomon  Telekom \nCompany Limited in their existing secure telecommunication facilities near each landing site. \n \n\nTable 5: Summary of International Cable Routes Considered \n\nOption \nCable to a new branching unit on PPC-1  \nCable to Coolum, Australia \nCable to Vanuatu \n\nCapital expenditurea  \n($ million) \n30.0 \n60.7  \n44.5  \n\nSpur to an existing Telikom PNG-owned \n\n39.2  \n\nBU3 on PPC-1 \n\nRecommendation \nSelected as best overall option \nEliminated due to much higher cost  \nEliminated due higher cost and need for \nonward connection via Fiji \nWould be second choice but carries \nsignificant risk of execution failure \n\nBU3 = branch unit 3, PNG = Papua New Guinea, PPC-1 = PIPE Pacific Cable 1. \na Estimates include indefeasible right of use and required permits. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n19. \nSOCC will obtain all permits required for the international and domestic cables. Once the \ndetailed  cable  route  for  the  domestic  spurs  is  confirmed  by  a  marine  survey,  the  government \ncan, if necessary, declare the cable-passing area as no-anchor zone for shipping to avoid any \ndamage from vessel activity. The viability of the system will be ensured by choosing only proven \nsubmarine cable technology from  well-established and  reputable suppliers.  A  small  number of \ntechnical support staff will be fully trained in the operation of the system before the anticipated \nready-for-service date (December 2013).  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nAs  an  immediate  result  of  the  project,  i.e.,  reduced  prices,  users  of  existing  mobile \n20. \nservices  (voice  and  data)  will  enjoy  an  increase  in  their  consumer  surplus.  Increased \naffordability  will  also  lead  to  an  increase  in  the  number  of  new  users.  Wholesale  bandwidth \nprices  are  expected  to  halve,  more  or  less,  leading  to  a  conservatively  estimated  retail  price \nreduction  of  20%.  Other  benefits  may  be  substantial  but  are  more  difficult  to  analyze \nquantitatively.  They  include  (i)  the  improved  efficiency  and  quality  of  public  service  delivery \nthrough  the  introduction  of  broadband  based  delivery  modalities;  (ii) reduction  in  the  cost  of \ndoing business, resulting in efficiency gains for the private sector; (iii) mobile banking; and (iv) \nincremental economic growth.  \n\n21. \nBenefits  are  assumed  to  increase  over  time  as  the  population  grows  and  incomes \nincrease. Projected GDP growth is applied to the benefits computed in the first year the cable \n\n\fcomes into service. In the first year it is assumed that 50% of the computed benefits will actually \naccrue to  beneficiaries,  increasing to 100%  in  the  third  year. The  project  appears  to  be  highly \nsocially profitable, with a projected economic rate of return of 37%.     \n\nThe  cost  of  SOCC  equity  was  assumed  to  be  15%,  and  the  cost  of  commercial  debt \n22. \n6.5%.  ADB\u2019s  grant  and  loan  to  the  government  will  be  onlend  to  SOCC  at  a  blended  rate  of \n2.95%.  The  resulting  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  is  3.75%.  The  financial  internal  rate  of \nreturn  is  22%,  calculated  using  a  15%  hurdle  rate  over  18  years,  including  the  construction \nperiod  of  2  years.  This  far  exceeds  the  estimated  cost  of  capital  and  clearly  indicates  the \nfinancial  viability  of  the  project.21 As  the  project  is  for  a  revenue-generating  entity,  a  discount \nrate  of  15%  was  used for  the  net  present  value  to examine commercial  viability.  The financial \nevaluation  indicates  that  the  project  has  a  healthy  net  present  value,  which  only  becomes \nnegative when revenue decreases by 15% or more. \n   \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nPublic \n\nfinancial  management  and  procurement.  The  main  public \n\nfinancial \n23. \nmanagement risk concerns the capacity of the Ministry of Finance and Treasury to appropriately \nonlend  and  administer  the  loan  and  grant  proceeds  to  SOCC.  This  risk  is  mitigated  by  (i)  the \ncurrent  and  ongoing  capacity  development  support  to  the  debt  management  unit  within  the \nministry;  and  (ii)  ADB  making  direct  payments  to  the  suppliers  of  the  domestic  spurs  and  the \nIRU.22 Wider  support for  the  strengthening  of  public financial management  is  provided through \nthe ongoing Economic Recovery Support Program (Subprogram 2).23  \n \nAt the project level, a financial assessment conducted of the implementing agency found \n24. \nthe  project\u2019s  overall  risk  profile  to  be  moderate,  mitigated  by  the  appointment  of  a  firm  of \naccountants  and  an  office  manager  and  bookkeeper  to  ensure  transactions  are  appropriately \nclassified  and  a  set  of  accounts  maintained.  In  addition,  SOCC  will  recruit  two  highly \nexperienced  consultants  to  assist  in  managing  the  procurement  process  (bid  documents  are \nprepared as part of project preparatory technical assistance). Annual audits will be performed by \na locally recruited firm.   \n \nThe risk of excessive and/or unproductive borrowing by  the government is mitigated by \n25. \nthe endorsement of a debt management strategy in June 2012. The strategy comes with clear \nobjectives  for  debt  management  and  provides  a  framework  for  the  government  to  resume \nprudent  borrowing  for  projects  that  provide  revenue  or  key  infrastructure  to  increase  the \nwellbeing  of  Solomon  Islanders.  Finally,  the  government  will  onlend  to  SOCC,  so  the  primary \ndebt servicing responsibility rests with the implementing agency.  \n \n26. \nCorruption.  Reports  on  corruption  throughout  the  public  service  persist.  However, \nsubstantial  progress  has  been  made  in  developing  institutional  capacity  to  address  corruption \nfollowing  the  arrival  in  2003  of  the  Regional  Assistance  Mission  to  Solomon  Islands  and \nreestablishment of law and order. This is reflected in the World Bank\u2019s governance indicator for \nthe  control  of  corruption,  which  shows  a  marked  improvement  from  5.9  in  2003  to  38.8  in \n2010.24   \n\n                                                \n21 The  availability  of  a  sovereign  component  in  the  financing  plan  has  been  crucial  in  securing  the  equity  and \n\ncommercial debt shares. \n\n22 Regional  Assistance  Mission  to  Solomon  Islands.

Manila. \n\n24 http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/sc_chart.asp \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n \n27. \nSector  regulation.  Solomon Telekom  Company  Limited,  which is  one  of  the  two retail \nproviders, owns a 49% share in SOCC, which poses the risk of preferential treatment. This risk \nis  mitigated  through  the  implementation  of  the  Telecommunications  Act,  2009  as  overseen  by \nthe  Telecommunications  Commission  of  Solomon  Islands.  The  existence  of  the  act  and  the \ncontinued  presence  of  a  fully  operational  telecommunications  commission  should  provide  the \nnecessary  assurance,  by  intervention  if  needed,  that  the  owners  and  operator  of  the  SCS  will \nprovide wholesale capacity on a fair and equitable basis to all its wholesale customers and that \nthe availability of much lower-cost, higher-quality broadband internet is passed on to businesses, \ngovernment,  and  consumers.  As  an  additional  risk  mitigation  measure,  SOCC  will  publish  a \nreference offer,  setting  out  standard  terms  and conditions  under  which wholesale services will \nbe provided.   \n \n28. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the Ministry of Finance and Treasury. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual.25 \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\nIn addition to wider socioeconomic benefits discussed above, the immediate contribution \n29. \nof  the  project  to  the  country\u2019s  social  and  poverty  profile  lies  in  a  substantial  decrease  in \ntelecommunication costs, leading to a greater affordability of services to wider segments of the \npopulation,  in  particular  those  who  are  geographically  and  economically  isolated  and \ndisadvantaged  (wholesale bandwidth prices  are expected  to  halve,  leading to a  conservatively \nestimated  retail  price  reduction  of  20%).  ADB  will  also  provide  parallel  support  to  the \nGovernment  to  realize  the  expected  socio-economic  and  poverty  benefits,  through  the \ndevelopment of broadband applications in the delivery of critical public services, including health \nand education services. 26 \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples\u2019 impacts were assessed \n30. \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Proposed cable laying and minor \ncivil  works  will  not  result  in  any  significant  adverse  environmental  or  social  impacts,  and  all \npotential  environmental  impacts  can  be  adequately  mitigated  and  managed  and  will  be \nmonitored.  An  initial  environmental  examination,  incorporating  an  environmental  management \nplan, has been prepared for the project.27 The project is classified as environmental category B. \nThe project does not involve any physical displacement, and no indigenous people issues have \nbeen  identified.  The  cable  will  be  laid  along  existing  road  and  property  boundaries  on  public, \ncustomary,  and  private  land.  Land  access  and  easements  across  customary  and  private  land \nwill be obtained through negotiated agreements with the respective land owners, guided by the \nresettlement plan prepared in compliance with the Safeguard Policy Statement.28 The project is \nclassified  under  involuntary  resettlement  category  B  and  indigenous  peoples  category  C.  The \nsafeguard  documents  will  be  endorsed  by  the  government  and  SOCC,  disclosed  locally  by \nSOCC, and posted on the ADB website.    \n\n                                                \n25 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 In addition, the 2011 country performance assessment highlights critical weaknesses in the area of social inclusion \n\nand the effectiveness of the public administration.   \n\n27  Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n28 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\fF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 6 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.29 Significant project risk arises from the fact \nthat  the  connection  of  the  international  spur  to  PPC-1  must  coincide  with  the  scheduled \nmaintenance of PPC-1 in July 2013. A delay in any of the key project milestones\u2014especially a \ndelay  in the  award  or  execution  of contracts,  a failure  to obtain timely  commercial  cofinancing \nresources  for  the  project,  or  a  delay  in  disbursements\u2014could  mean  that  the  project  is  not \nimplemented at all or that the economic value of certain project expenditures would be severely \nimpaired. All parties involved in the project are keenly aware of this risk and are making every \neffort  to  adhere  to  project  milestones  so  as  to mitigate  this  delay  risk.  The  integrated  benefits \nand impacts of the project are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nTable 6: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nMitigating Measures \nStrict  process  management,  and  strict  adherence  by  all  parties  to  preparation \nmilestones, to ensure that the deadline is met \n\nRisks \nDelays in project preparation \nlead to missing the engineering \ndeadline of July 2013 to install \nthe branching unit on PPC-1 \nGovernment highly vulnerable \nto excessive borrowing \n\nFailure to reach agreement on \nthe commercial debt \ncomponent results in a \nfinancing gap  \n\nPricing by SOCC not reflective \nof economic cost base \n \nCollusion on pricing between \nretail operators \n\nThe  project  is  private  sector-led,  through  equity  contributions  by  SOCC,  and \ngearing  with  commercial  debt.  Government  borrowing  for  the  project  is  limited  to \n$10.5  million  (or  17.5%  of  total  financing).  Primary  debt  servicing  responsibility \nrests with SOCC (this is also true for the sovereign component). \n(i)  the  availability  of  a  substantial  sovereign  component  in  the  financing  plan;  (ii) \npolitical  support  at  the  highest  levels  of  the  Solomon  islands  Government;  (iii)  a \ncommon  term  sheet  agreed  by  the  commercial  partners;  (iv) coordination  of  the \ncommercial  due  diligence;  (v)  in-principle  agreement  on  the  relative  share  of  the \ncommercial debt to be covered \nThe existence of the Telecommunications Act, 2009 and the continued presence of \na fully funded and functioning telecommunications commission should provide the \nnecessary  assurance,  by  intervention  if  needed,  that  wholesale  capacity  is \nprovided on a fair and equitable basis and that the availability of much lower-cost, \nhigher-quality  broadband  internet  is  passed  on  to  businesses,  government  and \nconsumers. \nBid  documents  prepared  in  cooperation  with  ADB;  strict  review  of  bid  evaluation \nreport by ADB; establishment of records management system in SOCC  \n\nWeak procurement capacity in \nSOCC \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PPC-1 = PIPE Pacific Cable 1, SOCC = Solomons Oceanic Cable Company. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nThe  government  has  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  project,  which  are \n\n32. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the project \nadministration manual and financing agreement. \n \n33. \nset forth in the financing agreement and project agreement.  \n \n34. \nSpecific  effectiveness  conditions  include  the  execution,  on  terms  acceptable  to  ADB, \nand effectiveness of a subsidiary loan agreement between the government and SOCC.
