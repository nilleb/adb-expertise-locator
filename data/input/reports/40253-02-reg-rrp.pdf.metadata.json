The  project  will  (i)  provide  tenurial  security  to \npoor households and ethnic minority groups for collaborative management of forest resources; \n(ii) restore habitat on degraded forestlands with tree planting of native species, and agroforestry \nmodels  with  improved  sources  of  nontimber  forest  products  (NTFPs);  (iii)  improve  livelihoods \nand income-enhancing small-scale infrastructure; (iv) generate over 5 million cash-based labor \ndays through project activities; and (v) augment ecosystem service flows and benefits through \ncarbon  sequestration  and  improved  watershed  management.  The  project  is  positioned  for \nmultiple types of long-term financial support for expanded and sustained local and civil society \n5\nengagement in natural resource management.PF\nFP The project will cover an area of more than 1.93 \nmillion hectares (ha) involving 22 communes in Cambodia, 69 villages in the Lao PDR, and 34 \ncommunes  in  Viet  Nam  with  a  total  population  of  172,000  or  35,000  households,  with  58% \nidentified as ethnic minorities and more than 50% considered poor. \n\n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nThe six GMSPF\n\n \nA. \n \n6\nFP governments, with support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \n3. \nnongovernment  organization  partners,  have \nimportant  biodiversity \nconservation  landscapes  in  the  GMS  that  are  vulnerable  to  increased  development  pressures \nand  environmental  degradation  (attached  map).  These  regionally  and  globally  high-value \nbiodiversity  landscapes  and  watersheds  need  to  be  conserved  to  safeguard  local  livelihoods \nand  investments  in  energy  and  hydropower,  transport,  water,  and  food  security  enhancing \nsectors.

Manila. \n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nP  The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity identifies ecosystem fragmentation as a key driver of loss of \n\nglobal biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. \n\nP  Biodiversity corridors are geographic areas within or cutting across GMS economic corridors that need to be placed \nunder  sustainable  management  regimes  to  secure  local  livelihoods,  address  habitat  fragmentation,  and  maintain \necosystem services. They ensure the continuity of ecological processes between natural protected areas. \n\nP  By supporting sustainable forest management practices, the project  will assist in securing long-term financing for \nconservation  of  transboundary  landscapes.  It  could  serve  as  a  funding  bridge  to  Reduced  Emissions  from \nDeforestation  and  Forest  Degradation  and  Conservation  and  Enhancement  of  Carbon  Stocks  (REDD/REDD+) \nmechanisms and REDD carbon market opportunities. \n\nP   Cambodia, People\u2019s Republic of China, the Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n\nP\nP\nP\nP\nP\nP\n\f 2 \n\n7\n\n \n\n8\nFP \n\nThe  development  of  GMS  transport  infrastructure  is  connecting  people,  natural \n\nFP  The  project \n2005,  with  the  biodiversity  corridors  initiative  (BCI)  as  the  flagship  component.PF\nrepresents the first generation of investments emerging from the pilot phase (2006\u20132009) of the \nCEP-BCI.PF\n \n4. \nresources,  and  markets;  and  acting  as  a  catalyst  for  broader  economic  development.    \nResource-rich,  relatively  remote  locations  such  as  Koh  Kong  and  Mondulkiri  provinces  in \nCambodia,  Attapeu  and  Sekong  provinces  in  the  Lao  PDR,  and  Quang  Nam  and  Quang  Tri \nprovinces  in  Viet  Nam  have  recently  been  connected  to  markets  through  the  development  or \nupgrading  of  major  transboundary  roads  that  provide  the  backbone  of  the  North\u2013South \nEconomic  Corridor,  East\u2013West  Economic  Corridor,  and  Southern  Economic  Corridor.  The \ninvestment  plans  to  convert  these  transport  corridors  into  economic  corridors  need  to  be \nembedded  in  an  ecosystem  management  approach.P\nPFailure  to  do  so  risks  jeopardizing  the \nnature  and  magnitude  of  ecosystem  service  flows,  including  biodiversity  conservation  and \ncarbon  sequestration  benefits  to  local  communities,  and  undermining  the  performance  and \n \nsustainability of investments.P\n \n5. \nDevelopment  pressures.  The  development  of  regional  hydropower  systems,  roads, \nlarge-scale  tourism  infrastructure,  mining,  and  plantation  agriculture  ventures  pose  challenges \nto  these  biodiversity  conservation  landscapes.  Hydropower  development  of  more  than  \n10\n900 megawatts is envisaged in the project area.PF\nFP In the provinces of Attapeu, Champasak, and \nSekong, which are the focus of BCI landscapes connecting to the Lao PDR, nearly 97,000 ha \nare  expected  to  be  inundated  from  the  planned  hydropower  investments.PF\nFP  In  addition,  some \n600,000  ha  are  under  various  mining  and  logging  concessions,  indicating  rapid  natural \nresources  sector-led  growth.PF\nFP  Similarly,  in  the  Cardamom  Mountains  in  Cambodia,  22 \nproposed  hydropower  stations  will  inundate  large  forest  areas,  while  in  Mondulkiri  province  in \nnortheast Cambodia, 18 hydropower dams are proposed.PF\nFP In Viet Nam, the BCI sites spanning \n1.7 million ha will come under increasing pressure with eight hydropower dams planned to meet \nthe rapidly growing demand for electricity (15% per annum). PF\nFP In addition to the development of \nproductive sectors, climate change is likely to have an additional effect on ecosystem services. \nIncreasing weather variability, and extreme weather events and shifts in agro-ecological zones \nare  likely  to  increase  vulnerability  of  ecosystem  services  and  amplify  impacts  on  dependent \npoor communities.PF\n\n9\nFP \n\nFP  \n\n12\n\n11\n\n15\n\n14\n\n13\n\nF\n\n8\n\n9\n\n                                                 \n7\nP  Supported by ADB. 2005.

The  project  will  contribute  to  pillar  4  of  ADB's  regional  cooperation \nand integration strategy: cooperation in regional public goods. The project will also support the \nnew  GMS  strategic  framework  (2012\u20132022),  currently  being  prepared,  and  the  process  of \ntransitioning  from  GMS  transport  corridors  into  full-fledged  economic  corridors.  Sustainable \nenvironmental management is a critical aspect of the poverty reduction strategies in Cambodia, \nthe Lao PDR, and Viet Nam, with more than two-thirds of the population directly deriving their \nsustenance  from  natural  resources  and  agricultural  sectors.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the \ntargets of the National Strategic Development Plan Update 2009\u20132013 of Cambodia; the draft \nVII National Socio Economic Development Plan 2011\u20132015 of the Lao PDR; and Article 9 of the \nrecently  approved  Biodiversity  Law  (Law  No.  20/2008/QH12),  the  Forestry  Development \nStrategy  to  2020  (Prime  Minister  Decision  No.  18/2007/QD-TTg,  5  February  2007),  and  the \noverall socioeconomic development objectives of Viet Nam for 2011\u20132015. \n \n7. \nis informed by lessons from ADB support to the Tonle Sap Initiative in Cambodia,PF\nsector  interventions  in  the  Lao  PDRPF\nFP  and  Viet  Nam.PF\n(i) decentralized community-oriented management approaches offer the best chance of success \nin  addressing  environment  and  natural  resource  issues,  and  (ii)  provincial  coordination  of \nmultisector interventions needs to go hand-in-hand with developing the implementation capacity \nof  line  agencies.PF\nFP  The  BCI  pilot  phase  demonstrates  that  coupling  conservation  with  direct \nlivelihood  improvement  is  feasible  as  demonstrated  by  piloting  conservation  stewardship \nprograms  delivering  direct  cash  income  of  about  $800,000  to  more  than  28,000  beneficiaries, \nand avoiding deforestation and forest degradation of more than 2 million ha.PF\nFP It also confirmed \nthat viable alternatives can be designed and deployed for (i) using local communities as willing \nand able service providers to undertake biodiversity restoration and conservation investments; \n(ii) \n(iii)  increasing  the  economic  returns  to  hydropower  and  tourism  investments  through  payment \nfor ecosystem service policy and financial regimes. \n \nB. \n \n8. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  climate-resilient  sustainable  forest  ecosystems \nbenefiting  local  livelihoods.

In  particular,  activities  will  contribute  to  \n(i) management plans and corridor policy and legal framework covering around 1.93 million ha \nof forest and nonforest land in 56 communes and 69 villages spread across Cambodia, the Lao \nPDR, and Viet Nam; and (ii) participatory land use maps and commune and village investment \nplans  with  delineation  and  demarcation  of  permanent  forest  boundaries  and  provision  of  new \nland use certificates.  \n \n11. \nOutput  2:  Biodiversity  corridors  restored,  protected,  and  maintained. The focus is \non  commune  and  village-based  forest  protection  and  restoration.  The  bulk  of  the  investments \nunder  output  2  will  target  forest  restoration,  covering  19,200  ha  in  the  form  of  natural  forest \nreplanting, enrichment planting, NTFP planting, and agroforestry. Restoration activities include \nlabor inputs provided by women on a cash basis, thus improving household incomes. Activities \nto identify viable reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and conservation \nand  enhancement  of  carbon  stocks  (REDD/REDD+)  pilot  sites  will  enable  the  project  to \nleverage incremental funding for forest protection and restoration (an additional 16,100 ha) from \nfunds  specifically  set  up  to  promote  REDD.  The  commune  and  village  development  fund \nmechanism will be used as a decentralized local instrument to receive REDD funding for carbon \nsequestration.  The  project  will  also  assist  the  selected  districts  in  the  provinces  to  establish \ninventory  sample  plots,  conduct  biodiversity  surveys,  and  draft  village/commune  forest \nmanagement plans. \n \n12. \nOutput  3:  Livelihoods  improved  and  small-scale  infrastructure  support  provided. \nDemand-driven  livelihood  and  small-scale  infrastructure  subprojects  prioritized  in  participatory \nconsultations at the start of project will be identified and undergo a rigorous screening process. \nEach  selected  commune  has  a  block  allocation  for  livelihood  improvements  comprising  NTFP \nproduction and processing, home gardens, livestock farming and other interventions selected by \nbeneficiaries. Some of these livelihood options can also be pursued through the mechanism of \nthe  commune  and  village  development  funds,  which  will  provide  microfinancing  facilities  to \nhouseholds  to  borrow  for  their  projects  of  choice.  At  least  4,775  households  and  more  than \n4,000  farmers  will  receive  technical  and  cash  support  for  livelihood  and  productivity \nenhancement.  In  addition  to  livelihood  interventions,  the  selected  communes  and  villages  will \nreceive small-scale infrastructure support ($100,000 per village in the Lao PDR, $150,000 per \ncommune  in  Cambodia,  and  $235,000  per  commune  in  Viet  Nam).  Small-scale  infrastructure \nsupport will primarily focus on (i) commune-based potable water schemes; (ii) provision of waste \nmanagement  and  sanitation  facilitations;  and  (iii)  improvement  and  upgrading  of  rural  access \nroads  from  communes  to  markets.  Special  attention  will  be  given  to  ensure  that  the  poor  and \nethnic minority groups participate equitably in subproject benefits.  \n \n13. \nOutput  4:  Project  management  and  support  services  operationalized.

The  project  is  expected  to  yield  major  benefits,  including  \n(i)  incremental  employment  for  households  and  local  communities  generated  from  proposed \ninvestments  for  boundary  surveys,  demarcation,  inventories,  and  reforestation,  that  in  turn  will \nprovide  incentives  to  engage  in  corridor  planning  and  management  activities;  (ii)  improved \nlivelihoods  through  innovative  mechanisms  to  engage  local  communities  in  conservation  and \nprovision  of  essential  rural  infrastructure  facilities;  (iii)  access  to  safe  drinking  water  and \navoidance  of  significant  water-related  diseases  and  health-care  related  costs;  and  (iv)  public \nand  private  utilities,  enterprises,  and  downstream  farmers  benefiting  from  the  enhanced \necosystem services generated through the action of direct beneficiaries. The value of improved \nlandscape  management  will  include  gains  from  increased  carbon  sequestration  and  resultant \nemission  reductions;  expanded  ecotourism  potential;  and  losses  avoided  from  flood  damage, \nextreme  weather  events,  saltwater  inundation  of  coastal  aquifers,  and  costs  associated  with \nreduced and irregular river flow. The project is expected to generate social benefits that accrue \nto communities, local government units, and private and nongovernment organizations through \nstakeholder  empowerment  resulting  from  the  project\u2019s  institutional  and  capacity-building \ninterventions.
