Outputs 1, 2, and 3 will strengthen the capacity of the microfinance industry to provide \nfinancial  services  to  a  broader  cross-section  of  the  community  and  strengthen  the  capacity  of  its \nclients  and  potential  clients  to  utilize  these  services.  Output  4  will  provide  appropriate  regulation \nfor,  and  supervision  of,  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs)  and  savings  and  loan  societies  (SLSs) \nthrough the Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG). Output 5 will increase lending to micro and small \nenterprises (MSEs) to increase rural income generation. Output 6 will provide efficient and effective \nproject management services. As a result, institutions selected as participating financial institutions \n(PFIs), which will be identified through a series of institutional assessments, will be better able to \nprovide profitable, appropriate, reliable, and safe financial services to financially literate clients and \ncapable businesses, with a view to reducing poverty. \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n3. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  estimates  that  only  approximately  15%  of  the \npopulation in PNG has access to formal or informal banking facilities, and that this is lower in rural \nareas.  Lack  of  access  to  financial  services  is  an  impediment  to  the  monetization  of  rural \neconomies,  a  constraint  on  the  growth  of  MSEs,  and  a  restraint  on  the  mobilization  of  domestic \ncapital.  The  project  will  extend  and  build  on  the  experiences  and  lessons  learned  from  ADB\u2019s \nMicrofinance  and  Employment  Project,  which  built  a  solid  base  for  microfinance  and  developed \nmicrofinance as a suitable tool for rural development in PNG.2 \n\nMicrofinance services in PNG are being supplied through 20 SLSs, 2 licensed microbanks, \n4. \nthe  National  Development  Bank,  and  around  70  small  community-based  nongovernment \norganizations.  The  microbanks,  6  SLSs,  and  13  nongovernment  organizations  have  indicated \ninterest in project participation. Currently, these institutions have 43,000 microcredit borrowers and \n250,000  deposit  accounts.  Asset  growth  in  the  licensed  microbanks  has  exceeded  20%  per \nannum, whereas recently there has been more moderate growth in other institutions. Overall, ADB \nestimates  that  the  demand  for  microfinance  services  is  more  than  twice  the  current  supply.  The \nproject  will  improve  supply  and  efficiency  of  use  of  financial  services,  especially  in  areas  outside \nPort Moresby and major provincial capitals. \n\n5. \nDespite earlier  successes,  the microfinance sector  in PNG  continues to face  a number of \ndevelopment issues, including (i) lack of access to financial services, particularly in rural areas; (ii) \npoor financial literacy and business management skills; (iii) low capacity among microfinance and \nsocioeconomic  institutions;  (iv)  increasing  demand  for  borrowing  by  MSEs;  (v)  lack  of  a \nmicrofinance-specific  legal  and  regulatory  framework;  and  (vi)  lack  of  accepted  industry-wide \nstandards.  The  project  will  direct  assistance  to  achieve  greater  impact  on  these  issues  through \nmutually reinforcing activities. Poverty in rural areas is significantly greater than in urban areas and \nwomen  face  particular  issues  in  accessing  income-generating  opportunities.  A  key  focus  of  the \nproject  will  be  improving  access  to  credit  and  income-generating  opportunities  in  rural  areas  and \nfor women, both directly and through improvements in the enabling environment. \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB.  2000.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Microfinance  and  Employment \n\nProject for Papua New Guinea. Manila. Cofinanced by the Australian Agency for International Development. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nThe  design  of  the  project  has  taken  into  consideration  the  key  learnings  from  the \n\n6. \nMicrofinance and Employment Project, i.e., that \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nthere is widespread demand for accessible savings services relative to borrowing; \ndifferent  MFIs  and  SLSs  require  greatly  differing  levels  of  support  to  properly \nmanage their assets, liabilities, and operations; \nsupport for capacity development provided offsite, with poor follow up and mentoring \ncan reduce its long term effectiveness; \nfinancial illiteracy, poor loan monitoring, and social and cultural factors have resulted \nin a high rate of arrears in all loan portfolios; and \nMFIs have avoided lending, particularly to MSEs, due to repayment concerns. \n\n7. \nThe project is consistent with the Government of PNG's Development Strategic Plan 2010\u2013\n2030,  and  Vision  2050,  which  recognize  that  significant  progress  is  needed  to  extend  financial \nservices  to  the  general  population. 3  It  also  aligns  with  the  government's  focus  on  rural \ndevelopment,  as  outlined  in  the  2010  budget.  The  project  is  also  consistent  with  ADB's  Strategy \n20204 and Pacific Approach 2010\u20132014,5 and is included in the PNG country operations business \nplan  2009\u20132011. 6  The  Microfinance  and  Employment  Project  has  generated  opportunities  for \nADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  that  complement  the  project.  Ongoing  technical \nassistance is also available through the Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative\u2013Phase II.7 \n\n8. \nUnder  the  project,  and  more  generally,  ADB  will  cooperate,  liaise,  and  engage  with \ndevelopment  partners  focused  on  access  to  finance  in  PNG  through  coordination  meetings  and \nthrough  local  agency  coordinators.  These  will  include  the  Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment as cofinancier of the project, the International Finance Corporation through its Pacific \nMicrofinance  Initiative  and  its  broader  activities,  and  the  multidonor  Pacific  Financial  Inclusion \nProgram. Furthermore, under the project ADB will pursue synergies with development partners in \nrural  development,  including  the  World  Bank  and  the  New  Zealand  Aid  Programme.  More  detail \ncan be found in the development coordination linked document (Appendix 2). \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n9. \nThe  project\u2019s  impact  will  be  increased  economic  growth  led  by  the  private  sector.  The \noutcome  will  be  PFIs  sustainably  and  safely  providing  financial  services  to  a  substantially \nincreased number of clients across PNG.  \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe project\u2019s outputs are summarized in paras. 11\u201319. They are more fully described in the \n10. \ndetailed  implementation  plans  and  the  project  administration  manual  (PAM).  In  addition,  further \ndetail can be found in the sector assessment summary, the summary poverty reduction and social \nstrategy, and the gender action plan (Appendix 2). \n\n1. \n\nBusiness  and  Product  Management  Capacity  of  Participating  Financial \nInstitutions is Increased \n\n11. \nThis output will address low and variable capacity to manage operations, the lack of on-site \ntraining  and follow  up,  and  poor  rural  outreach.

It  is \nexpected that at least seven institutions will become PFIs.8 A system for independent monitoring, \nfeedback,  and  evaluation  of  training  will  be  developed  and  implemented.  PFIs  will  be  monitored \nand assessed before moving to the next level of assistance. A comprehensive training program will \nbe  developed  for  delivery  to  PFI  staff.  All  training  modules  will  incorporate  gender  issues,  and \ntraining will be delivered in locations across PNG. PFIs will have the opportunity to receive on-site \ntechnical mentoring to strengthen their operations and systems. Business mentors will be assigned \nto each qualifying PFI to support implementation of improved accounting, management information \nsystems  (MISs),  reporting,  human  resources,  and  operational  and  business  management. \nInstitutions failing to respond to, or not institutionalizing, support measures will risk losing access to \nproject services. \n\n13. \nAll PFIs will receive training on data collection, reporting, analysis, and monitoring. Eligible \nPFIs will receive technical assistance to upgrade or replace their MISs, which will have the capacity \nto collect and report on sex-disaggregated data. Where appropriate, the project will provide support \nto  PFIs  to  ensure  their  MISs  can  connect  to  electronic  platforms  such  as  mobile  phone  banking \n(MPB).  This  will  extend  rural  outreach  and  reduce  costs  for  PFIs  by  enabling  clients  to  make \npayments remotely. The project will provide expertise in market research and microfinance product \ndevelopment.  The  consulting  team  will  assist  PFI  product  development  staff  to  develop  new \nproducts designed to service both existing and new market segments, including women and rural \nand agriculture-dependent communities.  \n\n2. \n\nClients and Potential Clients Understand and Know How to  Access  Financial \nServices for Personal or Business Use \n\n14. \nPoor financial literacy is a key inhibitor to making financial services accessible to the rural \npoor.  To  address  this,  the  project  will  undertake  a  large-scale  financial  literacy  training  program \ntargeting  120,000  clients  and  potential  clients  (at  least  40%  of  whom  will  be  women)  of  PFIs.9 \nProject  staff  will  conduct  initial  needs  assessments  and  design  the  training  program  and \nmaterials.10 It  will  include  a  training-of-trainers  component  enabling  local  \u201cmaster\u201d  trainers  to  be \ntrained.  Delivery  of  the  training  will  be  contracted  to  suitably  qualified  field  contractors  (such  as \nwomen\u2019s  groups,  church  groups,  and  other  community-based  organizations)  or  to  PFIs \nthemselves. PFIs will be able to influence the schedule and location of the training in accordance \nwith  their  marketing  and  expansion  strategies.  This  will  ensure  PFIs  are  able  to  offer  financial \nservices  to  graduating  training  participants.  To  assist  with  project  start  up  and  organization  of \nactivities,  the  government  has  requested  that  the  training  and  curriculum  development  specialist \nand the microfinance institutional development specialist be engaged under advance action. \n\n                                                \n8  Eligibility criteria will be developed in consultation with the technical specialists. In general, the project will not support \nMFIs and SLSs that have no clear prospect of financial sustainability within approximately 3 years, or that are unwilling \nto actively utilize resources to improve their operations. \n\n9  Financial literacy pilot programs were undertaken in the later stages of ADB\u2019s Microfinance and Employment Project. It \nis  too  early  to  determine  their  success,  though  consultations  during  project  design  indicate  that  (i)  there  is  a  link \nbetween participation in financial literacy training and the opening of savings accounts, and (ii) the training was useful \nto  participants  in  better  understanding  and  managing  their  household  finances.  In  addition,  a  recent  study  on  the \nimpact of financial capability and competence on well-being in rural communities in the Fiji Islands found that there is a \npositive relationship between financial competence and household well-being in rural households. Households in which \nthe principal financial decision makers are financially competent are more likely to manage household cash flows and \nto  use  a  budget  to  plan  future  expenditure  than  those  that  did  not.

Suva. \n\n10The training program and materials will be adapted from existing international best practice financial literacy programs. \nWherever  possible,  curriculum  and  materials  developed  specifically  for  use  in  the  Pacific  context,  and  programs \ndeveloped for indigenous communities, will be referenced.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n15. \nTo  address  poor  business  skills,  PFIs  will  be  able  to  access  business  development  skills \n(BDS)  training  for  clients  they  select  to  enable  them  to  better  manage  and  develop  their \nbusinesses.11 A  network  of  BDS  training  providers  throughout  PNG  will  be  identified  and  trained \nunder  the  project.  A  subsidized  voucher  system  will  enable  PFIs  to  select  from  the  short  list  of \ntraining  providers  for  the  provision  of  BDS  training  to  clients.  Skills  training  will  be  delivered  to \n22,000  clients  (20%  of  whom  will  be  women),  and  at  least  15%  of  the  training  courses  will  be \ndelivered  by  women  trainers  to  women-only  groups. 12  A  system  for  independent  training \nmonitoring, feedback, and evaluation will be developed and implemented.  \n\n3. \n\nThe  Association  of  Microfinance \nMicrofinance Industry Standards \n\nInstitutions  Monitors  Jointly  Agreed \n\n16. \nTo develop, implement, and assist institutions to understand the importance of best practice \nmicrofinance  industry-wide  standards,  industry  associations  will  receive  support  and  training  to \nbuild their capacity for advocacy and development of services to industry members. Associations \nwill be supported in identifying international and national financial and social benchmarks, such as \nthose developed and reported internationally by the Microfinance Information Exchange (including \nindicators  measuring  women\u2019s  and  rural  participation),  and  key  operational  indicators  to  be \nreported by association members and published on a quarterly basis.13 A website and publication \non  industry  reports  will  be  developed  to  support  industry  activities,  promote  transparency,  and \nencourage improvement of microfinance industry standards. \n\n4. \n\nBank  of  Papua  New  Guinea  Regulation  and  Supervision  of  Microfinance \nInstitutions and Savings and Loan Societies is Streamlined and Improved \n\n17. \nTo address the lack of a  microfinance-specific legal and regulatory framework, the project \nwill propose a risk-based categorization of MFIs and SLSs. It will undertake a review of the Bank \nand  Financial  Institutions  Act  2000  and  the  Savings  and  Loan  Societies  (Amendment)  Act  to \ndevelop  recommendations  for  regulatory  and  supervisory  requirements  of  each,  as  well  as  for \nMPB.14 The  project  will  assist  the  BPNG  to  draft  articles  of  regulation  for  MPB,  SLSs,  and  each \ncategory of MFI. The BPNG will be assisted to develop a risk-based supervision approach to its off- \nand on-site supervision of MFIs, SLSs, and MPB providers.15 Operational procedures manuals will \nbe developed for the Supervision Department as well as for off- and on-site supervision procedures \nand  implementation  skills.  Lastly,  staff  of  the  BPNG  MFI  and  SLS  supervision  units  will  undergo \ntraining in all new procedures developed. \n\n5. \n\nA Risk-Share Facility Supports Increased Micro and Small Enterprise Lending \n\n18. \nTo address the low level of, and increasing demand for, MSE lending, a risk-share facility \n(RSF)  will  be  established  to  share  some  of  the  default  risk  on  PFI  MSE  loan  portfolios  and \nencourage  them  to  expand  these  portfolios  and  improve  lending  quality.16 This  will  complement \nefforts  under  other  project  outputs  and  lead  to  increased  demand  for  MSE  borrowing  and \ndevelopment  of  more relevant  products,  and  wider  outreach  of  lending for  an  expanded range of \n\n                                                \n11   Research  shows  that  the  provision  of  business  training  in  microfinance  leads  to  improved  business  knowledge, \npractices,  and  revenues.  MFIs  also  had  direct  benefits  through  higher  repayment  and  client  retention  rates.  Karlan \nand Valdivia. 2006.

Thus, most institutions have enough funds to \nlend and therefore do not require direct financing. Instead they are constrained by the risks associated with lending \nand need assistance with risk mitigation. Lending quality is expected to improve as a result of the requirements set for \nparticipation in the facility. See the detailed implementation plans for more details (Appendix 2). \n\n\fMSE borrowers and investments. It may also encourage development of commercially sustainable \nlinks  with  other  donor  programs  and  organizations.  The  RSF  will  be  financed  through  ADB  loan \nproceeds of $5.4 million. \n\n6. \n\nThe  Project  Management  Unit  Provides  Efficient  and  Effective  Project \nManagement Services \n\n19. \nThe  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  coordinate  the  project,  establish  and  manage \nproject accounts, prepare work plans, carry out procurement, prepare and submit relevant reports, \nand  monitor  and  evaluate  project  performance.  To  address  the  lack  of  capacity  within  the \nexecuting agency, support from key project consultants will be provided to assist the PMU.  \n\nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $24.06  million  equivalent,  including  taxes  and  duties  of \n20. \n$0.91  million.

Beneficiary \nhouseholds  and  businesses  accessing  project  training  services  will  finance  16%  of  such  costs.19 \nThe financing plan is shown in Table 2, and further detail is available in the PAM (Appendix 2).  \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment of Australiaa \nPFIs and beneficiaries \nGovernment \n\nTotal \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\nShare of Total \n(%) \n\n13.00 \n6.00 \n1.97 \n3.09 \n24.06 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n54.0 \n25.0 \n8.2 \n12.8 \n100.0 \n\nPFI = participating financial institution. \na This amount includes the Asian Development Bank\u2019s administration fee, audit cost, bank charges, and provision for \nforeign exchange fluctuations (if any), to the extent that these items are not covered by the interest and investment \nincome earned on this grant, or any additional grant contribution by the Government of Australia. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n23. \nThe  National  Centre  for  Financial  Inclusion  (NCFI)  will  be  formed  from  the  current \nMicrofinance  Competence  Centre  under  the  Institute  for  Banking  and  Business  Management \n(IBBM).  Until  NCFI  is  established,  IBBM  will  be  the  implementing  agency  for  outputs  1,  2,  and 3 \nand will be assisted by about seven administrative staff that will be recruited to work in the NCFI. \nOnce  established  as  an  independent  entity,  within  approximately  9  months  of  the  beginning  of \nproject implementation, the NCFI will replace the IBBM as the implementing agency for outputs 1, \n2, and 3. The NCFI will also be supported by international and national consultants. It will generate \nrevenue from PFIs and client contributions to training costs, as well as from other services it may \nprovide. At the time of the project's midterm review, an assessment of the post-project role of the \nNCFI  will  be  undertaken,  and  a  plan  developed  to  ensure  that  it  is  able  to  generate  sufficient \nrevenue or attract further donor funding to continue its activities. \n\nImplementation  arrangements  are  summarized  in  Table  3  and  described  in  detail  in  the \n\n24. \nPAM. \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated project completion date \nLoan and grant closing date \nProject management \n(i)  Project steering committee \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Project management unit \n(iv)  Implementing agencies \n\nArrangements \n1 January 2011\u201331 December 2017 \n31 December 2017 \n30 June 2018 \n \nBPNG (chair), DFCD, DNPM, AMFI, FESALOS, IBBM, DOT, \nSBDC, PMU (secretary), ADB, AusAID (observers) \nBPNG \n \nHeaded by a project manager for output 6 \nIBBM for outputs 1, 2, and 3; BPNG for output 4; DOT for output 5a \n1  international  consultant,  2  national \n\na.

The  government  has \nrequested  that  one  international  and  one  national  consultant  be  engaged  as  individuals  under \nadvance  action  to  enable  project  start-up.  Business  mentors  will  be  hired  through  a  firm  using \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nQCBS with a quality:cost ratio of 70:30. A services firm will be engaged through QCBS to provide \nmanagement services for the RSF using an 80:20 quality:cost ratio, modified for evaluation criteria. \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nThe project is expected to increase access to safe and reliable financial services for people \n27. \nliving  throughout  PNG, particularly  in rural  areas.  Extensive consultations  and focus groups were \nundertaken  with  potential  financial  services  users,  policy  makers,  civil  society,  the  private  sector, \neducational  institutions,  and  development  partners  during  project  design.  Key  stakeholders  also \nparticipated in a workshop to review and comment on the final proposed project design. There is \nbroad-based support for the project from all sectors. \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nOver the project period, approximately 18,000 jobs will be created.20 It is estimated that PFI \n28. \nloans  outstanding  will  increase  by  more  than  $54.00  million,  to  an  additional  52,000  borrowers. \nApproximately  60%  of this  increase,  or  around  $33.60 million,  will  be  in MSE  borrowing.  Savings \ndeposits  are  expected  to  increase  by  more  than  $100.00  million  and  the  number  of  deposit \nhouseholds will increase by more than 160,000.21 An economic and financial internal rate of return \nanalysis  was  undertaken  for  the  proposed  project.  The  results  of  this  analysis  are  heavily \ninfluenced  by  the  mix  of  activities  selected  to  represent  a  reasonable  activity  mix;  a  different  mix \nwould  yield  a  different  result.  As  such,  overall  rates  of  return  are  not  shown.  Details  are  in  the \neconomic and financial analysis (Appendix 2). \n\nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n29. \nThe  BPNG  was  the  executing  agency  for  the  ADB  Microfinance  and  Employment  Project \nand  has  the  structure,  skills,  capacity,  and  authority  to  implement  the  project  by  establishing  a \nPMU  inside  the  BPNG  and  a  project  implementation  unit  inside  the  Supervision  Department. \nFinancial  management  and  procurement  assessments  found  satisfactory  capacity  in  the  BPNG. \nThe  IBBM  has  also  demonstrated  satisfactory  financial  management  skills,  in  particular  as  the \nimplementing  agency  for  a  major  component  of  the  Microfinance  and  Employment  Project.  The \nimplementing agency for the  RSF will be the Department of Treasury, although the facility will be \nmanaged by a professional manager. International and national consultants have been included in \nproject  design  to  support  financial  management  and  procurement  activities.  While  the  financial \nmanagement, procurement, and corruption situation in PNG remains weak, the assessments show \nfew concerns regarding such capabilities within the relevant agencies. \n\n30. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  BPNG.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (Appendix 2).  \n\nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n31. \nThroughout PNG, lack of access to financial services, particularly in rural areas, is a major \nconstraint  on  income  growth  for  households  and  MSEs. 22 The  project\u2019s  activities  will  increase \n\n                                                \n20  This is based on one full time job being created for each $1,843 in MSE loan disbursements. \n21  Under the project, it is assumed that each household has approximately 1.4 deposit accounts. The total increase in \nthe number of deposit accounts as a result of the project is therefore about 250,000. Household disposable income is \na major determinant of savings volumes and households are the key focus for development of new savings products. \nFor more detail, see the economic and financial analysis (Appendix 2). \n\n22  It is estimated that less than 16% of the population use financial services.

Manila. \n\n\foutreach  and  access  by  building  the  capacity  of  PFIs  to  deliver  services  and  products  in  rural \nareas. This will increase rural incomes and reduce poverty by stimulating informal business activity \n(via  loan  services),  balancing  income  and  expenditure,  and  increasing  asset  accumulation  (via \nsavings  services).  The  delivery  of  training  to  clients  will  improve  their  ability  to  access  and  use \nfinancial  services.  Women  will  benefit  from  (i)  financial  literacy  training;  (ii)  BDS  training;  (iii) \ndevelopment  of  new,  women-focused  products;  (iv)  gender  awareness  training  for  PFI  staff;  (v) \nimproved monitoring of services and participation; and (vi) links to women-focused programs. \n\nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n32. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  FI  (financial  intermediary),  although  it \nwill  be  treated  as  category  C  as  it  is  unlikely  to  have  adverse  environmental  impacts.  Urban \nmicrofinance borrowing is mainly for retail activities and transport. Rural microfinance borrowing is \nmainly  for  agriculture  and  consumer  finance,  such  as  school  fees  and  life-cycle  events  such  as \nbirths  and  funerals.  The  project  will  not  finance  any  of  the  activities  included  in  ADB\u2019s  prohibited \ninvestment activities list. \n\nThe project will have no involuntary resettlement impacts and has been classified category \n33. \nC.  The  project  does  not  specifically  target  indigenous  peoples  as  the  population  is  largely \nindigenous.  Its  goal  to  increase  access  to  financial  services  will  have  only  positive  impacts  for  a \nbroad  cross-section  of  the  population,  particularly  women  and  those  living  in  rural  areas. \nAccordingly,  although  the  project  has  been  classified  B,  an  indigenous  peoples  plan  is  not \nrequired. Wide-ranging  consultations  across  PNG  to  ensure  that  project  design  is  sympathetic  to \nthe needs of PNG\u2019s people confirmed overwhelming support for the project. The project has been \ncategorized as effective gender mainstreaming. \n\nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n34.
