I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nrupiah-denominated loan of up to Rp430 billion to Aetra Air Jakarta for the East Jakarta Water \nSupply Development Project in Indonesia.  \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  Development  need.  Indonesia  continues  to  face  the  dual  challenges  of  low  water \nsupply coverage and poor service quality. At the end of the last medium-term development \nprogram in 2009, only 48% of the total population had access to a sustainable source of safe \nwater, and only about 26% had access to piped water.1 Following the current trajectory, the \nGovernment of Indonesia will fall short of reaching the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) \ntarget of halving the proportion of those without access to safe drinking water sources by 2015.2 \n3.  The development need is heightened by the combination of rapid urbanization and aging \ninfrastructure.  The  urban  population  has  more  than  doubled,  from  56  million  in  1990  to \napproximately 122 million in 2010.3 Most public utilities, especially water companies, are not \n \nequipped to handle such drastic growth in urbanization. The proportion of the urban population \nserved by piped water actually decreased from 36% in 1998 to 31% in 2008 (footnote 1). \nJakarta, the largest city and capital, anchors an extended urban region4 with a population of \nmore than 28 million, which is expected to grow to 35 million by 2020. However, Jakarta\u2019s water \nsupply network, originally built during the Dutch occupation, has not kept pace with the city's \naccelerated growth. Less than 65% of Jakarta's residents currently have access to piped water. \nThe remaining urban population depends on individual wells, small-scale providers, or water \nvendors; often at high cost. The urban poor make up only 10%\u201315% of those with access to \npiped water and remain particularly vulnerable to the lack of access to safe water because of  \nE. coli contamination of wells and groundwater, a main alternate water supply.5  \n4.  According  to  Ministry  of  Public  Works  2011\u20132014  estimates,  a  total  investment  of \nRp65.3 trillion is needed for Indonesia to achieve the MDG for water supply and sanitation by \n2015 (footnote 1, p. 29).6 As the funding capacity for the 2011\u20132014 investment program is \nlimited to Rp28.5 trillion, the shortfall of Rp36.8 trillion demonstrates how public expenditure \nalone cannot sufficiently address the country\u2019s water sector needs. \n \n5.  Concession history. Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum Jakarta Raya (PAM Jaya), a state-\nowned enterprise, was established in 1977 to manage water supply and sewerage services in \nJakarta. However, despite high tariffs compared with other Asian countries, PAM Jaya could not \nsustain an efficient management or investment program to meet the needs of residents.

Republic of Indonesia: Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Assessment, Strategy and Roadmap. \nManila. \n6 This implies annual spending on water services of about Rp16.3 trillion. ", "2   \n1997,  PAM  Jaya  granted  the  right  to  operate  the  city\u2019s  water  supply  system  to  two \nconcessionaires under two separate 25-year concessions; they will both terminate in 2023. \nThames Pam Jaya (TPJ) was granted the concession for East Jakarta and PAM Lyonnaise \nJaya (PALYJA) the concession for West Jakarta. Each concession was granted pursuant to the \nterms of a cooperation agreement. \n6.  Under  the  cooperation  agreements,  each  concessionaire  is  responsible  for  the \nproduction and distribution of clean water, including the expansion and maintenance of the \nwater assets, for its respective assigned service areas in Jakarta. Responsibilities include the \nprovision of water services to residential, industrial, and commercial customers, as well as \nmanagement of billing and collections. Revenue collected by each concessionaire is placed in \nan escrow account. PAM Jaya receives a proportion7 as payment for its day-to-day monitoring \nand supervision of the relevant concession, and the concessionaires receive a water charge8 for \neach cubic meter of water produced.  \n \n7.  The concessionaires have faced sizeable challenges. Indonesia was affected by the \nAsian financial crisis in the late 1990s and due to economic and political turmoil, PAM Jaya was \nunable to implement the tariff increases as agreed in the cooperation agreements. The resulting \ntariff freeze initiated a buildup of PAM Jaya accounts payable and strained the sustainability of \nthe concessionaire operations. In 2001, PAM Jaya signed a restated cooperation agreement \n(RCA) with TPJ and PALYJA to try and resolve the tariff issue. The RCA laid the foundation for \nthe creation of the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body (JWSRB), which was intended to be \nan independent regulator in charge of supervising the concessions and reviewing requests for \ntariff increases on behalf of the governor of Jakarta and the Ministry of Public Works. \n8.  In 2003, for the first time since 1998, the average water tariff (charged to consumers) of \nRp5,000 per cubic meter became higher than the water charge (paid to concessionaires) of \nRp4,000 per cubic meter. In July 2004, the Jakarta City Council agreed to an automatic water \ntariff adjustment every 6 months over 5 years to allow PAM Jaya to pay accumulated water \ncharge  arrears  to  the  concessionaires.  The  water  tariff  adjustment  formula  assumed  that \nincreases in the water charge as well as any changes in the financial requirements of PAM Jaya \nand  JWSRB  would  be  fully  passed  on  to  consumers.  However,  the  adjustment  was  only \nimplemented from 2004 to 2007.  \n9.  Transfer  of  ownership.  In  2007,  TPJ\u2019s  majority  owner,  Thames  Water  Overseas, \ndivested 95% of its ownership9 in TPJ to Acuatico through a competitive bid process. Acuatico is \na special purpose investment vehicle incorporated in Singapore. TPJ subsequently changed its \nname to Aetra Air Jakarta. \n10.  2012  master  agreement.  Following various further amendments of the cooperation \nagreement (from 2001 onwards),10 Aetra and PAM Jaya entered into a master agreement, \nsigned on 5 June 2012 to address a number of fundamental issues with the East Jakarta \nconcession. The master agreement came into effect in April 2012. One of the key principles of \nthe master agreement is that Aetra will operate under the assumption of no overall average tariff \n                                                \n7  Part  of  PAM  Jaya\u2019s  receipts,  also known  as the  \u2015first  party  primary  requirement\u2016 covers  the  debt  service \nrequirement of PAM Jaya to the Ministry of Finance for loans taken prior to the water concession privatization.  \n8  The water charge is a flat fee that the concessionaires receive, which is delinked from the actual water tariff \ncharged to consumers, which is tiered according to each customer\u2019s socioeconomic status. \n9  The decision of Thames Water Overseas to divest its overseas holdings, including TPJ, was part of a global \nstrategic decision for the company to refocus its core business back in Europe. \n10 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "  3 \n \nincrease. In addition, the master agreement confirms the water charges to be applied to the end \nof the concession period, as well as a reduction in Aetra\u2019s internal rate of return from 22.00% to \n15.85%. The parties intend to enter into a further amended and restated cooperation agreement \n(ARCA) in 2013 so that the cooperation agreement is entirely consistent with the terms of the \nmaster agreement. This will require numerous provisions of the cooperation agreement to be \nreviewed and harmonized. \n11.  ADB has been involved, through its nonsovereign operations, in the Indonesian water \nsector since 2007, when it approved a loan of Rp455 billion (approximately $50 million) to \nPALYJA, for  its  $121 million  capital  expenditure  program for  2008\u20132012.11 ADB\u2019s  relevant \nexperience makes engagement with Aetra a natural complement to ADB\u2019s water strategy in the \nGreater Jakarta region. \n2.  Project Design \n12.  The East Jakarta concession provides water supply services through 340,000 residential \nconnections  (both  piped  water  and  hydrants)  and  49,000  commercial  and/or  industrial \ncustomers in a concession area with a total population of 4.6 million.12 Approximately 740,000 \nmillion liters of treated water are distributed daily through 5,929 kilometers of pipeline network. \n3.  The Borrower and/or Sponsor \n13.  Aetra is owned by Acuatico (95%) and Alberta Utilities (5%). Incorporated in Singapore, \nAcuatico is a leading investor, developer, and operator of water infrastructure projects with a \nfocus on Indonesia and Viet Nam. It operates as a joint venture between Recapital Advisors \n(50%), a major Indonesian investment and financial advisory company, and Avenue Capital \nGroup (50%), an asset management company based in New York. The Acuatico portfolio \nincludes a 25-year water production and distribution concession in the Tangerang region in \nIndonesia,  a  30-year  water  supply  contract  for  a  Jakarta  development,  and  two  separate  \n20-year water supply and distribution concessions in Viet Nam. \n \n14.  The four managing directors of Aetra have an average of 20 years of experience in the \nindustry and retain strong relationships with all stakeholders in the Indonesian water sector. One \nof  the  directors  is  seconded  from  PAM  Jaya,  bringing  expertise  as  well  as  encouraging \ncooperation between Aetra and the grantor of its concession. Aetra management is supported \nby a team of 633 key operations staff with an average of 17 years of industry experience.13 \nLeveraging the strength of management and staff expertise, Aetra has maintained profitability \nevery year since the management team was appointed, following the change of ownership of \nthe  concessionaire  in  2007.  Management  is  overseen  by  a  five-member  board,  which \nsupervises company strategy and management. The board includes experienced water sector \nprofessionals from Southeast Asia as well as key personnel from Acuatico to provide financial, \nlegal, and engineering expertise. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2007.

The project supports the government\u2019s effort to meet the MDG 7 target for water \nsupply by increasing access to improved drinking water sources through investment in critical \nwater infrastructure, helping the people of Indonesia gain access to more stable and affordable \npiped water supply. The commercial success of this concession is also expected to attract \nprivate sector participation in water concessions in other cities across the country.  \n \n16.  Meeting  the  impact  targets  will  require  improvements  in  the  overall  regulatory \nenvironment for the water sector in Indonesia as well as public sector investment to provide \n\u2015last-mile connectivity\u2016 for low-income households that currently rely on relatively expensive \nwater supplied by vendors.14 ADB nonsovereign and sovereign operations15 have collaborated \nto  build  JWSRB  capacity  (para.  23)  and  expand  access  to  the  urban  poor  (para. 29). \nCoordination  with  ADB  public  sector  efforts  to  improve  the  regulatory  framework  in  the \nIndonesian water sector and facilitate connectivity is essential to achieving the project\u2019s impact. \n \n17.  Outcome. The outcome will be improved water provision in East Jakarta by a more \nfinancially viable Aetra. \n \n18.  Output. The output will be the completion of the 2013\u20132017 capital expenditure program \nfor Aetra, involving (i) the rehabilitation and upgrading of production facilities; (ii) the expansion, \nrehabilitation,  and  maintenance  of  distribution  networks;  and  (iii)  improved  corporate \nenvironment and social safeguard standards. The investment is expected to add 45,000 new \nresidential  water  connections,  benefiting  both  individual  households  and  communities  with \naccess to a shared water connection. \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n19.  The  project  directly  supports  infrastructure  development,  one  of  the  core  areas  of \nStrategy 2020.16 The project targets solving critical underinvestment problems in the operation \nand maintenance of key urban infrastructure assets to facilitate more sustainable urbanization.  \nThe project is fully consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132014 for Indonesia \nthrough its first pillar of inclusive growth, which includes support for catalytic projects to improve \naccess to water supply in selected cities and towns in Indonesia.17 It supports government \nefforts  to  expand  access  to  improved  water  supply  services,  particularly  for  poor  and \nunderserved populations, and strengthens local government capacity for public service delivery. \nThe  project  is  also  in  line  with  the  country  partnership  strategy\u2019s  focus  on  enhanced \ncollaboration between ADB's sovereign and nonsovereign operations to improve the business \nclimate  and  engage  in  capacity  building  to  promote  bankable,  scalable  public\u2013private \npartnership projects. \n2.  Consistency with the Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020 \n20.  The project promotes development of sustainable water supply and is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020, which identifies increased efficiency in water use \nand greater private sector partnership as priority solutions in response to the huge unmet water \n                                                \n14 As of 2012, 1 cubic meter of water from a vendor is priced at Rp35,000\u2013Rp72,000, compared with the projected \naverage tariff of piped water at Rp7,600.  \n15 Southeast Asia Department, Urban Development and Water Division.  \n16 ADB. 2008.

", "  5 \n \nneeds in Asia and the Pacific.18 The project is also consistent with the plan\u2019s vision of total \ninvestment reaching $25 billion by 2020, of which private sector participation will provide more \nthan $500 million per year. \n \n3.  Previous Operations and Lessons  \n21.  On 31 August 2007, ADB approved a loan of Rp455 billion (approximately $50 million) to \nsupport PALYJA in its $121 million capital expenditure program for 2008\u20132012, the third 5-year \nperiod of the water concession. In 2011, PALYJA\u2019s performance was limited by a tariff freeze \nand  the  unavailability  of  new  sources  of  bulk  water.  However,  through  prudent  cash \nmanagement and operating efficiency, PALYJA\u2019s 2011 financial and operating performance \nremained positive, and outstanding debt servicing capacity for the ADB debt remains strong. \n  \n22.  ADB\u2019s financing of PALYJA illustrates the importance of ADB engaging with JWSRB and \nPAM Jaya to ensure continuous dialogue between the two entities to facilitate the resolution of \ndisputes over the cooperation agreement. ADB has approved a capacity building opportunity for \nJWSRB to  enhance  its  effectiveness  and facilitate the  performance of  its functions  as  an \nindependent regulator in the Jakarta water sector. This is expected to considerably enhance the \nsuccess of the project.19 \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n23.  Aetra  is  responsible  for  procurement;  obtaining  government  approvals;  carrying  out \nenvironmental  and  social  assessments,  preparing  audit  reports,  and  overseeing  capital \ninvestment. Table 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements for the project.20 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n18 ADB. 2011.

The initial capacity building exercise took place in October 2012 and involved meetings \nwith Manila\u2019s water concessionaires and Manila\u2019s independent regulator, as well as relevant site visits.  \n20 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2.)  \n ", "6   \nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory  Under Law No. 22 of 1999 on regional governance, authority for all aspects of local \nframework  infrastructure and service delivery, including planning, providing financing, and \nmanaging water supply and sanitation, was devolved from the central government \nto district and city governments. In 1997, PAM Jaya offered the right to operate \nJakarta\u2019s water supply system to private enterprises under two separate \nconcessions. Under the cooperation agreements, the concessionaires are \nresponsible for expanding and maintaining water assets in Jakarta, providing water \nservices to residents, and managing billing and collections.  \nManagement  The four managing directors of Aetra have an average of 20 years of experience in \nthe industry and retain strong relationships with all stakeholders in the Indonesian \nwater sector, including PAM Jaya. Main operations staff have an average of 17 \nyears of industry experience. Aetra has maintained profitability every year since \nthe management team was appointed, following the change of ownership of the \nconcessionaire in 2007. \nImplementation   Loan availability period: March 2013\u2013March 2016 \nOperating arrangements \nRevenue and  Under the 25-year cooperation agreement, revenue collected by Aetra is placed in \ncost structure  an escrow account. Aetra receives a flat water charge for each cubic meter of \nwater produced. The water charge is delinked from the water tariff. \nOperation and  Aetra will directly manage its capital investment program as well as associated \nmaintenance  operation and maintenance activities.  \nRelevant parties  Aetra, the borrower, is owned by Acuatico (95%) and Alberta Utilities (5%). \nPerformance  Aetra will report key performance indicators, including output and outcome \nmonitoring  indicators.  \nF.  Projected Financial and Economic Performance \n24.  The project is financially viable because the expected financial internal rate of return is \nhigher than the weighted average cost of capital. The project is economically sustainable with \nan economic internal rate of return higher than the social discount rate of 12%.21 \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n25.  The assistance will be a corporate unsecured loan to Aetra of up to Rp430 billion \n(approximately $44.7 million) without government guarantee. \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n                                                \n21 ADB. 2003. Economic Analysis of Projects. Operations Manual. OM G1/BP. Manila. An economic return on \ninvested capital of 10%\u201312% is acceptable as a hurdle rate for projects with significant unquantifiable benefits. The \nEvaluation Cooperation Group's Good Practice Standards for Private Sector Investment Operations rates a project \nsatisfactory if the economic return on invested capital is 10% or higher. ", "  7 \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n26.  ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  the  project  is  justified  through  (i)  diversified  financing\u2014Aetra \ncurrently has access to financing from local commercial banks, and ADB participation will help \nAetra diversify its sources of local currency financing; and (ii) public\u2013private partnerships\u2014the \nproject is an excellent example of the complementary value offered by ADB\u2019s private and public \nsector  operations. While  the  private  sector  investment  will  help  ensure  Aetra  achieves  its \ntechnical and financial targets without tariff increases, ADB as a whole brings value as follows: \n \n(i)  Improving \u201clast-mile\u201d connections. While the investment in water treatment is \nessential to complement existing public sector efforts22 to increase the quality, \nquantity, and reliability of Jakarta\u2019s raw water supply through investments in West \nTarum Canal and Bekasi siphon, public investment in the distribution network is \nalso needed, especially for poorer areas of the city. ADB sovereign operations \nwill provide capacity development technical assistance (TA) in 2013 to introduce \nprograms similar to those implemented by local governments in other Indonesian \ncities, and similar to the Tubig para sa Barangay (Water for the Community \nProgram) of Manila Water in the Philippines. The TA will provide an additional \navenue for Aetra to reach the urban poor.23  \n \n(ii)  Enhancing the efficiency of the independent regulatory body. In 2012, ADB \nnonsovereign and sovereign operations successfully used regional TA funds to \nbuild the capacity of JWSRB through dialogue with regulators in Manila. The plan \ninvolves twinning JWSRB with other regulators in Southeast Asia and outside the \nregion  to  facilitate  the  knowledge  and  experience  exchange.  The  twinning \nprogram would give JWSRB the opportunity to adopt or learn from management \nmodels that have achieved success in other similar concession areas. \n \n27.   Through its collaborative approach, the project will demonstrate how public\u2013private \npartnerships can help water projects in Indonesia remain commercially and technically viable, \nand  can  benefit  from  ongoing  regulatory  reform.  This  assistance  complements  ADB\u2019s \ninvolvement in PALYJA. ADB\u2019s holistic engagement in Jakarta will allow ADB to better observe \nand raise issues with the government on key policy challenges facing the evolving Indonesian \nwater  sector.  Moreover,  combined  with  experience  across  ADB, the  project  will  help  ADB \nmeaningfully contribute to dialogue on water sector management and regulation throughout \nSoutheast Asia. \nC.  Risks \n28.  Raw water risk. Aetra\u2019s water supply originates from the Jatiluhur reservoir and flows \nthrough West Tarum Canal. As such, Aetra is exposed to possible water supply interruptions \nthrough (i) inadequate maintenance and repair of the canal and associated pumping stations; \nand (ii) lack of management capacity of Perum Jasa Tirta II, the canal operator. To date, overall \nraw water availability has been adequate and the risk of short-term supply interruptions is \nmitigated through  ADB\u2019s  public  sector  assistance  on  improving  integrated  water resources \nmanagement in the Citarum Basin. One such project, ADB\u2019s construction of the Bekasi siphon \n(to be completed in 2013), will markedly improve Aetra\u2019s raw water supply quality by diverting \n                                                \n22 ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Integrated Citarum Water \nResources Management Investment Program in Indonesia. Manila.  \n23 The TA will share key success factors from programs that have successfully implemented last-mile connections, \nincluding flexible financing, public consultation, and customization of delivery systems. \n ", "8   \nflows from Bekasi River away from the canal. This will improve Aetra\u2019s water quality and lower \nassociated treatment costs.  Aetra does not have direct water supply contract with Jatiluhur \nreservoir operator Perum Jasa Tirta II; its raw water is supplied by Perum Jasa Tirta II under a \nfive yearly renewable contract with Pam Jaya (due for renewal in December 2016). The lender\u2019s \ntechnical advisor considers that a failure by PAM Jaya to supply bulk water to Aetra is highly \nunlikely given the social and political importance of a steady water supply for Jakarta. \n \n29.    Regulatory risk. Since Aetra and PAM Jaya have neither the authority nor control over \nincreases in the levels of the water tariff, the master agreement fixes the water tariff schedules \nat  their  currently  agreed  levels  for  the  remainder  of  the  concession  period.    The  master \nagreement also provides for an agreed set of financial projections that allow for Aetra to operate \nsustainably.  ADB has identified that the financial projections need to ensure a clear linkage \nbetween all financial statements and therefore ADB will enter into the facility agreement only \nafter it is satisfied that appropriate revisions have been made to the financial projections.  In \nlight of the multiple amendments to the cooperation agreement to-date, Aetra and PAM Jaya \nare scheduled to execute the ARCA in 2013 which will consolidate the cooperation agreement \nso that it is entirely consistent with the master agreement. The master agreement stipulates the \nnature of the amendments to be expected. ADB\u2019s review of the ARCA prior to its execution will \nbe a condition of ADB\u2019s second loan disbursement.   \n \n30.  Revenue risk. Under the master agreement, Aetra must operate within the constraint of \nwater tariff schedule remaining fixed for the remainder of the concession period.  This requires \nAETRA to achieve a higher average tariff from its customer base via customer reclassifications \nand to progress with NRW reductions, in order to grow its revenues.  NRW remains a key issue \nfor Aetra.  The lender\u2019s technical advisor also notes that Aetra has robust systems in place to \nallow for early detection of leaks and related repair.  Under the new operating principles agreed \nto in the master agreement, both Aetra and PAM Jaya agree that Aetra can achieve long-run \nfinancial and operational viability under the current arrangements.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n31.   Accumulated receivables risk.  If the operating cash flow falls short of projections, \nAetra\u2019s liquidity position could be adversely affected, especially in 2015 when a large portion of \nits debts will come due.  To minimize the risk of a tight liquidity situation Aetra can consider \nraising additional debt (from its current base of modest leverage) or conserving cash by limiting \ndividend payouts.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n32.   Tail risk and financing risk.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n33.   Execution risk. The four managing directors of Aetra have an average of 20 years of \nexperience in the industry and retain strong relationships with all stakeholders in the Indonesian \nwater sector, including PAM Jaya itself.  After Acuatico took over the concessionaire from \nThames Water, Aetra has reversed its accumulated deficit into a surplus.  There is continuity \nwith the staff that performs operations and maintenance services, as they are carried out in-\nhouse by experienced technicians who have been with the concessionaire from the time when \nThames Water was Aetra\u2019s primary owner.  \n ", "  9 \n \n34.   Portfolio risk rating.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n35.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory B for environment. Aetra\u2019s past and present performance on environmental and social \nsafeguards  was  audited  and  found  satisfactory.  Aetra  will  take  actions  stipulated  in  the \ncorrective action plan in the audit report, including improvement of its environmental and social \nmanagement system (ESMS) to comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. Aetra will \nconfirm to ADB annually its compliance with national laws and the ESMS, and provide reports \naccordingly. The project is classified as category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous \npeoples. It does not involve land acquisition or relocation of inhabitants since rehabilitation of \nexisting connections and development of new connections will be along the roadsides or rights-\nof-way. Nevertheless, Aetra has reviewed the land acquisition history of the proposed sites to \nensure that national requirements were met, and ADB\u2019s requirements were complied with. \nFurthermore, as the project is located in East Jakarta, where no indigenous peoples live, no \nimpact on indigenous peoples is foreseen. \n \n36.  ADB  assesses  the  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  Aetra  to  manage  the \nproject\u2019s social and environmental impacts as adequate.24 Measures to benefit new connection \nhouseholds, including benefits to women through reduced water collection times and improved \nhealth conditions, are incorporated in the project design in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on \nGender and Development (1998). ADB will ensure that the investment documentation includes \nappropriate provisions requiring Aetra to comply with national labor laws and take specific \nmeasures (including contractors) in relation to the internationally recognized core labor standard \nfor  the  ADB-financed  portion  of  the  project,  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection \nStrategy.25 \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n37.  Aetra was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date), and \npolicy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism (2003).26 \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB \nrequires Aetra to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  and  money \nlaundering activities and the financing of terrorism; and to covenant with ADB to refrain from \nengaging in such activities.   \n                                                \n24  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy; Safeguards and Social Dimensions Summary (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n25  ADB. 2001.
