An  environmental  impact  assessment  was \nAssessment  undertaken, and the summary circulated to the Board and made \npublic through the Asian Development Bank (ADB) website on \n25 July 2007. \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  is  designed  to  provide  (i)  a  244-kilometer  grade-\nseparated  and  access-controlled  highway,  including \n10 interchanges with toll booths and five service areas, starting at \nNoi Bai in a suburb of Hanoi and ending at Lao Cai, on the border \nwith the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in northwest Viet Nam; \n(ii) electric, communications, and tolling systems and associated \nfacilities,  and  the  Vietnam  Expressway  Corporation\u2019s  (VEC\u2019s) \nhighway  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  equipment  and \nvehicles; and (iii) capacity building for VEC on management of \nproject implementation, corporate financing management, O&M of \nhighways, and safeguard planning and implementation. \n   \nRationale  The Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Highway is an integral section of the eastern \nlink of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Northern Economic \nCorridor, connecting Kunming in Yunnan province of the PRC with \nHanoi, and Hai Phong and Cai Lan ports in Viet Nam. Most of the \nexisting national road between Hanoi and Lao Cai is narrow, with \na  large  number  of  bridges  with  limited  capacity,  and  there  is \nsubstantial  ribbon  development  on  most  of  its  length.  By \nupgrading the Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai section, the Kunming\u2013Hai Phong \nTransport Corridor will be completed.  \n \nPoverty  in  the  project  area  is  largely  a  result  of  inadequate \naccess, caused by poor local road infrastructure. People living \nbelow  the  poverty  line  are  suffering  from  poor  accessibility  to \neconomic  opportunities,  education,  and  health  services.  The \nhighway will decrease the cost of travel, which will encourage \neconomic  activities  in  the  project  area,  provide  employment \nopportunities  for  the  local  population,  and  improve  access  to \nsocial services. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Project will: (i) construct an efficient, safe, and reliable high-\nstandard road from Noi Bai to Lao Cai; (ii) create a new freight \ntransport link between PRC\u2019s Yunnan province, Hanoi, and Hai ", "ii   \nPhong and Cai Lan ports in northern Viet Nam; (iii) enable 1-day \ntransport between Kunming, Hanoi, and Hai Phong; (iv) stimulate \noperations of long-distance bus transportation services and local \npublic transportation; (v) generate revenue for VEC through the \nhighway  toll;  and  (vi)  create  business  opportunities  and \nemployment for local people along the highway. The Project will \nhave the following impacts: (i) sustainable economic growth and \npoverty reduction in the project area and along the Kunming\u2013Hai \nPhong  transport  corridor,  (ii) strengthened  connections  with \nYunnan province and strengthened international competitiveness; \nand (iii) enhancing mobility of people living along the highway. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $1.216 billion \nequivalent, including local taxes and duties of $82.8 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  Source  Total  % \n  ($ million) \nADB (OCR)  896.0  74 \nADB (ADF)  200.0  16 \nVEC  120.0   10 \nTotal  1,216.0  100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund, \nOCR = ordinary capital resources, VEC = Vietnam Expressway Corporation \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nLoan Amounts and  A loan of $896 million from the ordinary capital resources (OCR) \nLending Terms  of ADB will be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 27-year \nterm  including  a  grace  period  of  7  years,  an  interest  rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.35%  per  annum,  and  such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan and Project \nAgreements. \n \nA loan equivalent to $200 million in special drawing rights will be \nprovided from the Special Funds resources of ADB. The loan will \nhave a 32-year term including a grace period of 8 years, and an \ninterest rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper annum thereafter and such other terms and conditions as set \nforth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The Government of Viet Nam will be the Borrower for the ADB \nTerms  loans. The entire loan proceeds will be onlent to VEC, as the \nExecuting Agency, on terms acceptable to ADB, and at ADB\u2019s \ninterest  rate  applicable  to  the  loans,  plus  an  onlending  fee \npursuant to the Borrower\u2019s regulations.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2012 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2012 \nCompletion Date ", "  iii\n   \nExecuting Agency  Vietnam Expressway Corporation (VEC) \n   \nImplementation  VEC will have overall responsibility for project implementation. \nArrangements  VEC  will  establish  a  project  management  team  to  manage \nimplementation of the Project. The project management team will \nhave responsibility for day-to-day project implementation, and will \ncoordinate with the people\u2019s committees of provinces affected by \nthe project\u2014Hanoi city, and Vinh Phuc, Pho Tho, Yen Bai, and \nLao  Cai  provinces\u2014in  implementing  the  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  activities  and  livelihood  development  and  income \nrestoration programs. \n   \nProcurement  Civil works and equipment to be financed under the loans will be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). \n   \nConsulting Services  The project supervision consulting services will be implemented \nby  an  international  consulting  firm  in  association  with  national \nconsultants. Consulting inputs will be about 510 person-months of \ninternational consulting services and about 6,200 person-months \nof  national  consulting  services  for  (i)  construction  supervision; \n(ii) assistance  to  VEC  in  social  development  activities  and  in \nenvironmental  management,  land  acquisition,  and  resettlement \nactivities; (iii) project performance monitoring; (iv) assistance to \nVEC  in  procuring  equipment  for  the  highway  O&M;  and  (v) \ncapacity  building  of  VEC  staff  on  project  implementation, \nenvironmental  management,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement, \nsocial development assistance, corporate financing management, \nand O&M of the highway. The duration of the consulting services \nwill be about 46 months. The international consulting firm will be \nrecruited using the quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) and \nfull technical proposal procedure in accordance with Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The \nquality\u2013cost ratio for QCBS is 80:20. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will (i) reduce travel time between Noi Bai and Lao \nBeneficiaries  Cai from 7\u201310 hours to 3\u20134 hours, (ii) reduce the volume of traffic \npassing through cities and towns in the project area, (iii) reduce \nthe transport distance for container and other freight, (iv) allow \noperations  of  frequent  long-distance  bus  services  along  the \nhighway and feeder public transportation services connecting the \nhighway bus stops to communes, (v) reduce the number of traffic \naccidents, (vi) generate toll revenue to cover debt service of VEC, \nand  (vii)  create  small  and  medium  businesses  and  generate \nemployment opportunities for local people.  \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  estimated  at \n18.2%. The Project\u2019s financial internal rate of return after tax is \nestimated at 6.5%, which exceeds the weighted average cost of \ncapital of 2.6%. \n ", "iv   \nThe major project beneficiaries will be (i) highway users, including \ncargo forwarders, bus operators, and tourists; (ii) local residents, \nwho  will  benefit  from  improved  mobility  and  lower  prices  of \ncommodities and transport services; (iii) local laborers involved in \nthe  construction  works  and  supply  of  materials  during  project \nimplementation and later in operation of the highway; (vi) local \nand international manufacturers and traders, who will be able to \nestablish new businesses and increase production capacity, (v) \nVEC, who will receive toll revenue from highway users; (vi) bus \noperators, who will be able to expand their businesses; and (vii) \nport authorities in north Viet Nam, who will benefit from increased \ncargo volume. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  VEC\u2019s human resources and organizational structure are currently \ninadequate  to  implement  a  large-scale  highway  construction \nproject. The lack of knowledge of and experience with safeguards, \ncorporate finance, and highway O&M are of particular concern. \nThe project supervision consultant will provide on-the-job training \nto VEC staff.  \n \nOne concern is potential project implementation delays caused by \ndelayed land acquisition and resettlement, delayed procurement, \nand/or  poor  performance  of  the  contractors.  To  avoid  project \nimplementation  delays,  the  Project  will  take  the  following \napproaches: (i) notice to commence civil works on a particular \nsection will be issued only when land acquisition and resettlement \nhave been satisfactorily completed; (ii) VEC will proceed with the \ninitial steps of procurement of the civil works before signing the \nLoan and Project Agreements; and (iii) prequalification of bidders \nwill be undertaken to eliminate bidders that lack the technical and \nfinancial capacity to implement highway construction contracts of \nthis size and complexity.   \n \nThe  highway\u2019s  construction  will  involve  a  large  amount  of \nembankment  construction  and  excavation,  acquisition  of \nresidential  and  agricultural  lands,  and  resettlement  of  project-\naffected people, although the final alignment has been developed \nto ensure that environmentally sensitive areas are avoided and \ninvoluntary resettlement is kept to a minimum. An environmental \nimpact assessment was undertaken, and a full resettlement plan, \nincluding an ethnic minority development plan, was prepared to \nmitigate these risks. \n \nThe Project will increase road traffic and mobility of goods and \npeople, and consequently could increase HIV incidence, illicit drug \nuse, and human trafficking in local communities. The Project will \ninclude a technical assistance component to minimize these risks. \nAccidents  between  highway  users  and  the  local  people  may \noccur, in particular in the early period of highway operation, since \nthere  is  limited  experience  in  Viet  Nam  with  access-controlled \nroads. The project supervision consultants will develop a road ", "  v\nsafety campaign focusing on the access-controlled highway. \n \nThe economic and financial viability of the Project depends on \ntraffic demand on the highway. Moreover, traffic demand will be \naffected  by  toll  levels.  VEC  has  agreed  to  set  toll  levels  that \noptimize highway accessibility while ensuring that the Project is \neconomically  and  financially  viable,  and  that  VEC  remains \nfinancially viable and sustainable. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  ADB is financing the ongoing TA 6321-REG: Fighting HIV/AIDS in \nAsia  and  the  Pacific  (financed  by  the  Cooperation  Fund  for \nFighting  HIV/AIDS  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific),  which  provides  a \ntechnical  assistance  subproject  for  an  HIV,  illicit  drugs,  and \nhuman trafficking prevention program to minimize exposure of the \nlocal population to these risks through additional allocation of the \ncooperation fund. \n \n \n ", " \n ", " \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS): Kunming\u2013Hai \nPhong Transport Corridor\u2014Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Highway Project.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  The  Kunming\u2013Hai  Phong  Transport  Corridor  consists  of  multiple  transport  modes, \nnamely road, rail, and inland waterway. To meet the growing transport demand in the project \narea, possible alternatives to transport infrastructure projects were considered. The alternatives \nwere reviewed based on travel time, alignments, technical designs, social and environmental \nimpacts, and economic and financial viability. The analysis concluded that constructing the \nproposed Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Highway, and rehabilitating and upgrading the existing railway\u2014for \nwhich ADB approved a loan in 20061\u2014are important for the corridor development.2 While the \n(cid:31)F\nrailway project is expected to partly meet the increasing transport demand, it will not completely \nsatisfy the demand for all the various kinds of traffic\u2014particularly passenger traffic and high-\nvalue general cargo traffic, which require a more flexible and responsive mode to meet the \nneeds of a market economy. The Project was proposed to satisfy these needs. \n \n3.  The Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Highway is an integral section of the eastern link of the GMS \nNorthern Economic Corridor, connecting Kunming in Yunnan province of the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC) with Hanoi and Hai Phong in Viet Nam. In Yunnan province, a 400-kilometer \n(km) expressway with four to six lanes from Kunming to the border with Viet Nam will be \ncompleted in 2008. However, in Viet Nam, most of the existing national road between Hanoi and \nLao Cai, on the border with the PRC, is narrow, contains a large number of limited-capacity \nbridges, and has substantial ribbon development on most sections. These factors severely limit \nits capacity and reduce the possibility of improving it to cater for the projected substantial growth \nin traffic demand in the corridor. The section of the highway from Noi Bai to Hanoi and Hai \nPhong has been improved with assistance from other external donor agencies. Only the Noi \nBai\u2013Lao Cai section needs to be upgraded to complete the Kunming\u2013Hai Phong Highway. The \nproject feasibility study confirmed the necessity and viability of a modern highway linking the \nexisting highway network around Hanoi, at Noi Bai, with the border crossing at Lao Cai.3 The \n(cid:31)F\ndesign and monitoring framework for the Project is in Appendix 1. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n4.  The proposed highway will originate in Hanoi, and cross Vinh Phuc, Pho Tho, Yen Bai, \nand Lao Cai provinces. Together, these provinces have a population of about 7 million\u20148.4% of \nthe total population of Viet Nam\u2014and were responsible for 11.4% of gross domestic product \n(GDP). Viet Nam is one of the fastest growing economies in Asia, recording an average annual \ngrowth in GDP of 7.5% over the last decade. Per capita GDP in the country was $622 in 2005. \nPer capita GDP in 2005 was $1,381 in Hanoi; but only $503 in Vinh Phuc, $327 in Pho Tho, \n$266 in Yen Bai, and $313 in Lao Cai provinces, which were all below the country per capita \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2006.

Manila (Loan 2222-VIE).  ", "2 \nGDP. Per capita GDP in 2003 was $1,011 in Hanoi, $254 in Vinh Phuc, $361 in Pho Tho, $210 \nin Yen Bai, and $198 in Lao Cai provinces. It is noted that the economy of Hanoi, and Vinh Phuc \nand Lao Cai provinces, which are located at both ends of the highway, have rapidly grown in the \n2 years. The highway will be used as a transport link connecting two economically developing \nareas, and also contribute to economic growth in provinces sandwiched between areas that are \nrapidly growing economically. \n \n5.  In the context of the GMS and regional integration, economic cooperation between \nViet Nam and PRC has increased since the late 1990s. PRC is Viet Nam\u2019s third largest export \nmarket, and largest import supplier. In 2005 the value of exports to PRC was $2.3 billion and the \nvalue of imports was $6.2 billion.4 Yunnan province is a major producer of tobacco, minerals, \n(cid:31)F\nsteel, and fertilizer. Viet Nam, on the other hand, produces vegetables, fruits, seafood, crude oil, \nrubber, minerals, and light industrial goods such as textiles and footwear. So Yunnan province \nand Viet Nam have become important trade partners. Cross-border trade between Yunnan \nprovince and Viet Nam grew from $351 million in 2004 to $477 million in 2006, a year-on-year \nincrease of around 15%. Around 1 million tons of cargo is transported annually across the \nHekou\u2013Lao Cai border crossing points. There is a roughly equal split between goods carried by \nroad and by rail. Arrangements for initial implementation of the GMS Cross-Border Transport \nAgreement  at  the  Hekou\u2013Lao  Cai  border  crossing  points  have  been  finalized.  In  addition, \nagreement has been reached by the two governments to consider, at the earliest possible time, \nexpanding the scope of the existing bilateral road transport agreement to include the entire \nKunming\u2013Hanoi\u2013Hai Phong transport corridor as an interim measure until the relevant annexes \nand protocols of the GMS Cross-Border Transport Agreement have been ratified. This will \nfacilitate the exchange of commercial traffic rights along the corridor, which would reduce the \nincidence of costly and time-consuming transshipment at the Hekou\u2013Lao Cai border crossing \npoints. \n \n6.  The passage of containerized freight is particularly important for the trading relationship. \nForwarders of overseas container cargo in Kunming do not currently use the Kunming\u2013Hekou\u2013\nLao Cai\u2013Hanoi\u2013Hai Phong route, partly because of the poor condition of the Lao Cai\u2013Hanoi \nsection in Viet Nam, inefficient custom control procedures at the Hekou\u2013Lao Cai border, and the \nhigh  cost  of  transshipping  containers  at the border  crossing.  Instead,  they  send  container \ncargos by rail or road to the large ports in Guangzhou province (PRC), which takes up to \n6 days, and by road to the nearest ports in Guangxi province (PRC), which is about 1,050 km \nfrom Kunming. The proposed Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Highway will allow forwarders in Kunming to \nreach Hai Phong and Cai Lan ports, which contain large container facilities, in 1 day. Once the \nproposed  Noi  Bai\u2013Lao  Cai  Highway  has  been  completed,  and  the  ADB-supported  border \ncrossing operation is streamlined, a substantial number of containers originating in Kunming \ncould be diverted to the Kunming\u2013Hai Phong route. Viet Nam would benefit from this through \ntransit and port fees, among other benefits. \n \n7.  The major sources of livelihood in the project area are related to agriculture. Rice is the \nmajor crop in the project area. In the lowland areas where the proposed highway will be \nconstructed, crops for household consumption are also cultivated, and the livelihood system \nincludes rearing of livestock\u2014primarily pigs and to a lesser extent poultry and cattle. Upland \nagriculture is typically the domain of ethnic minorities in the project area, but is only significant in \nYen Bai and Lao Cai and to a much lesser extent in Vinh Phuc and Phu Tho. There are \nsophisticated and highly effective terraced rice production systems in the higher mountainous \nareas of Lao Cai. In recent times, cash crops such as cinnamon and cassava have been \n                                                 \n4 ADB. 2006. Key Indicators of Developing Asian and Pacific Countries. Manila. \n ", "3 \ncultivated in these upland areas. The Project\u2019s socioeconomic survey indicates that the major \npoverty issue relates first and foremost to household food security, including access to safe \ndrinking water, and there are a significant number of days when whole households have less \nfood to eat than they need. The poverty rates in 2006 were 15.0% in Vinh Phuc, 26.6% in Pho \nTho, 30.7% in Yen Bai, and 33.6% in Lao Cai provinces. The poverty rates in Pho Tho, Yen Bai, \nand Lao Cai provinces were higher than the country average, which is 20%. Improved transport \ninfrastructure in these provinces is critical for poverty reduction.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n8.  Viet Nam\u2019s economy has grown at 7\u20138% per annum over the past decade, and the \nGovernment estimates that this growth will continue, as reflected in the forthcoming Five-Year \nSocio-Economic Development Plan 2006\u20132010.5 While this growth has had a dramatic impact \n(cid:31)F\non the country\u2019s poverty rate, which declined from about 58% in 1993 to an estimated 20% in \n2006, it has severely strained the capacity of basic economic infrastructure, particularly power \nand transportation systems. The feasibility study of the Project has found that traffic is growing \nat about twice the rate of GDP and that this high growth rate is likely to continue beyond 2020, \nreflecting Viet Nam\u2019s low level of vehicle ownership.6 Appendix 2 provides an analysis of the \n(cid:31)F\nroad subsector. \n \n  1.  The Government\u2019s Strategy \n \n9.  The Government is acutely aware of the negative impact of inadequate infrastructure on \ngrowth  and  poverty  reduction.  It  is  beginning  to  see  the  adverse  impact  of  infrastructure \nbottlenecks on foreign investment, and on its desire to spread development more equitably to \nareas far from the major urban centers (Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang, etc.). For the critical \ntransport infrastructure, the Government is taking a dual approach to developing the country\u2019s \nroad capacity: (i) developing a network of high-capacity expressways and highways linking the \nmain  urban  areas  with  (a)  each  other,  (b)  less-developed  regions  of  the  country  and,  (c) \nneighboring countries; and (ii) developing the institutions required to plan, design, implement, \nand manage this network.  \n \n10.  The existing national road system was mainly constructed with two traffic lanes, although \nthere are short lengths with four lanes. Traffic management is rudimentary and the rate of traffic \naccidents is very high (Appendix 2). Government studies have indicated that the main national \nhighway  network  should  be  widened,  and  an  expressway  and  modern  highway  network \nthroughout Viet Nam should be built to connect important economic zones, large urban centers \nand  industrial  zones,  and  international  borders.  Reflecting  this  need,  the  Government  has \ndirected the Ministry of Transport (MOT) to prepare an expressway master plan. ADB has \nprovided technical assistance (TA) to assist MOT with completing the plan, of which of the \nproposed highway is an integral part.7 \n(cid:31)F\n \n11.  The  Government\u2019s  transport  sector  reform  program  aims  to  improve  efficiency  and \ncreate  an  institutional  and  financial  framework  conducive  to  accelerating  infrastructure \ndevelopment. MOT is being restructured to differentiate between regulation and infrastructure \ndevelopment and operations. Four modal administrations in road, railway, inland waterway, and \nmaritime have been created under MOT. In the road subsector, the aim of the restructuring is to \n                                                 \n5 Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2005.

More recently, MOT established \nVEC  as  a  state-owned  enterprise  financially  independent  of  MOT,  and  responsible  for \nimplementation of expressway projects and development of the expressway network, to be \nfunded by revenues from expressway tolls. \n \n  2.  Lessons Learned \n \n12.  Viet  Nam  country  portfolio  review  missions  have  noted  that  there  have  been \nimplementation delays in previous road projects, in particular during the project start-up phase. \nPast project designs have required that project supervision consultants prepare detailed designs \nand bidding documents for civil works, meaning that the initial 1\u20133 years of the loan period were \ndevoted to these essential but low-disbursement activities. Further delays in award of civil works \nhave  been  caused  by  delays  in  recruiting  consultants  and  preparing  detailed  design.  The \nongoing GMS: Kunming\u2013Hai Phong Transport Corridor\u2014Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Highway technical \nassistance project (TA loan, footnote 3) addresses these issues. The TA loan has two stages: (i) \nproject  preparation,  including  detailed  engineering  design,  detailed  economic  and  financial \nstudy, and social and environmental study; and (ii) procurement assistance for civil works and \nsupervision consulting services required for the Project. Procurement for the civil works and the \nconsulting services for this project will proceed under the second phase of the TA loan. The \nobjective of this approach is to reduce implementation delay by ensuring that the construction \nand  supervision  contracts  are  ready  to  be  signed  when  the  investment  loans  have  been \ndeclared effective. This two-tiered approach will enable construction to commence much earlier \nand will ultimately speed up completion of the highway by as much as 2 years. \n \n13.  Another reason for the project implementation delay is in approval of resettlement plans \nthat are updated after detailed design and the land acquisition and resettlement activities. \nContractors needed to delay commencement of the civil works until the land acquisition and \nresettlement activities, which must be carried out in accordance with the approved resettlement \nplans, have been completed for the entire sections covered by their contracts. To reduce the \nrisk,  the  following  sectional  hand-over  concept  will  apply  to  this  Project.  After  detailed \nmeasurement surveys are made based on the detailed design, VEC and 18 district people\u2019s \ncommittees  in  the  project  area  will  prepare  district-level  updated  resettlement  and  ethnic \nminority development plans (REMDP) including outputs of the detailed measurement surveys. \nThe district-level updated REMDPs will be individually submitted to ADB for approval. Land \nacquisition and resettlement activities will commence in a specific district only when ADB has \napproved  the  REMDP  for  that  district.  Each  civil  works  contract  package  covers  highway \nconstruction in more than one district. VEC will issue a notice to proceed to the civil works \ncontractors for a particular highway section in a district only once (i) compensation payment, \nand relocation to new sites of people affected by the Project have been satisfactorily completed; \n(ii) rehabilitation assistance is in place; and (iii) the particular length required for civil works is \nfree of all encumbrances.  \n \n  3.  ADB\u2019s Strategy \n \n14.  As set out in ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program (CSP 2007\u20132010),8 ADB will support \n(cid:31)F\nthe Government\u2019s investment program to improve transport infrastructure and reduce transport \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program (2007\u20132010) Viet Nam. Manila \n ", "5 \ncosts. For the road sector, the condition of the primary network, in terms of surface roughness, \nis reasonable. However, the network lacks the capacity\u2014in terms of road widths, horizontal and \nvertical  geometry,  pavement  strengths,  and  other  parameters\u2014to  provide  for  the  rapidly \ngrowing  transport  demand.  The  Government  is  addressing  these  capacity  constraints  by \nextending  the  paved  national  road  network  (100%  of  which  will  be  paved  by  2015)  and \nprovincial roads network (65% of which will be paved by 2015). In addition, it is developing a \nnetwork  of  expressways,  with  plans  to  have  about  500  km  in  service  by  2015.  The \nGovernment\u2019s studies indicate that these improvements will reduce the present transport costs \nby about 10% by 2010 and 15% by 2015. ADB\u2019s investment program, as described in the CSP, \nhas three thrusts in line with the Government\u2019s Socio-Economic Development Plan. First, ADB\u2019s \ninvestments  in  the  transport  sector  would  include  support  for  provincial  road  networks, \naddressing the social equity aspects of transport needs through use of Asian Development \nFund  (ADF)  resources.  Second,  ADB  will  help  develop  infrastructure  to  attract  business \ninvestment  and  development  in  an  environmentally  sound  manner.  Projects  could  include \ninvestments in expressway and railway facilities to facilitate the safe and efficient movement of \ngoods and people around, through, and between national centers of economic activity. Urban \ntransport  bottlenecks  will  also  be  addressed.  Third,  ADB  will  improve  connectivity  of  the \ntransport  network  with  the  transport  networks  of  neighboring  countries.  Viet  Nam  has \ncontributed significantly to enhancing connectivity, increasing competitiveness, and promoting a \ngreater sense of community in the GMS. The proposed Project is fully supportive of the second \nand third thrusts of ADB\u2019s strategy. The Project is also in the lending pipeline of the Regional \nCooperation Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008)9 as it forms a high-priority section of \n(cid:31)F\nthe Kunming\u2013Hanoi\u2013Hai Phong transport route of the GMS Northern Economic Corridor. \n \n15.  VEC will play a critical role in investments and financial management, construction \nmanagement,  and  operation  &  maintenance  (O&M)  of  expressway  projects  in  Viet  Nam. \nHowever,  to  date  it  has  little  experience  in  project  management,  financial  management, \nprocurement, environmental management, and land acquisition and resettlement. The Project \nwill provide institutional capacity building and staff training, so that VEC may manage the \nProject and similar projects in the future. \n \n  4.  External Assistance \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s interventions in the transport sector have been primarily in the road subsector \n(Appendix 3). Three loans addressed the rehabilitation of National Road 1, which runs along the \neast coast of Viet Nam and acts as the central spine for the road network.10 Subsequently, \n(cid:31)F\nintegral parts of the GMS economic corridors in Viet Nam were improved under ADB-funded \nprojects. 11 As  the  work  on  improving  national  roads  is  drawing  to  a  close,  projects  are \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2005.

In 2005, ADB provided technical assistance for developing a modern expressway and \nhighway network. The TA for Expressway Network Development Plan Project provided (i) a \nbusiness plan setting out an institutional, organizational, and financial structure that will allow \nVEC to successfully implement the expressway program; (ii) a long-term master plan for the \nexpressway network, including a detailed plan for expressways to be developed within the \nperiod 2006\u20132015; and (iii) a detailed economic and financial viability assessment of priority \nexpressway links, as well as a financing plan for these links (footnote 7). Moreover, TA for this \nproposed  Project  provides  for:  (i)  detailed  engineering  design,  (ii)  updated  economic  and \nfinancial studies, (iii) social and environmental studies, and (iv) procurement assistance for civil \nworks and project supervision consulting services for the proposed Project. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n18.  The current travel time between Kunming and Hai Phong is more than 2 days. This will \nbe reduced to 1 day upon completion of the proposed highway. By providing a shorter and lower \ncost  route  to  major  ports  and  inland  markets,  traffic  demand  at  Lao  Cai  will  increase  by \napproximately 10%. This increase will be caused by (i) reduced travel time on the Kunming\u2013Hai \nPhong Transport Corridor and transshipment cost savings at the Lao Cai\u2013Hekou border; and \n(ii) diversion of freight traffic in Kunming from the ports in Guangxi province (PRC) to Hai Phong \nand Cai Lan Ports in Viet Nam.16 Viet Nam\u2019s ability to export agricultural and maritime products \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nto Yunnan province, already a rapidly growing trade area, will also be enhanced substantially. \n \n19.  Poverty in the project area is largely a consequence of poor local road infrastructure, \nparticularly on the right bank of the Red River. People living below the poverty line are suffering \nfrom limited economic opportunities and poor education and health services. Once the project \nhighway has been completed, reduced travel times and improved transport conditions will allow \nthe  industries  clustered  around  Hanoi  and  Hai  Phong  to  expand  into  the  country\u2019s  poor \nnorthwest region, bringing employment, better access to social services, and other benefits. \n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2001.

The highway will enable the operation of long-distance bus transportation services and \nlocal public transportation services connecting bus stops on the highway to local communities. \nAs people living below the poverty line on the right bank of Red River do not own cars, \nmotorcycles, or bicycles, their mobility is extremely limited. The Project will provide them with \naccess to social and economic services and to employment in cities and towns.  \n \n21.  The  Project  is  expected  to  make  a  substantial  contribution  to  achieving  the \nGovernment\u2019s objectives for the project area, which include (i) raising the average per capita \nincome in Vinh Phuc, Phu Tho, Yen Bai, and Lao Cai provinces to the national average by \n2015; (ii) reducing overall poverty incidence in these provinces from 52% in 2004 to 15% in \n2015; (iii) increasing annual border trade volume at Lao Cai from $477 million in 2006 to at least \n$800 million in 2015; (iv) increasing the amount of small and medium businesses and increasing \nemployment of local people by 70% in 2015; and (v) improving awareness of the risks of HIV- \nAIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), illicit drugs, and human trafficking.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n22.  The  highway  will  have  a  high  design  speed,  be  fully  grade-separated  and  access-\ncontrolled, and will connect Noi Bai to the Lao Cai international border\u2014a distance of about 263 \nkm. Closer to Hanoi, between Noi Bai and Yen Bai, the terrain is flat to rolling, traffic volume is \nhigh and growing quickly, and population density is relatively high. From Yen Bai to Lao Cai, the \nterrain changes from rolling to mountainous; existing and projected traffic is relatively low, and \npopulation density is very low (particularly on the right bank of the Red River where the highway \nwill be located). The configuration of the highway reflects these differences. The Noi Bai\u2013Yen \nBai section is designed as a four-lane dual carriageway expressway (the first stage), with \npotential for upgrading to six lanes (the second stage). Similarly, the Yen Bai\u2013Lao Cai section is \ndesigned as a two-lane single carriageway highway, with potential for upgrading to a four-lane \ndual carriageway expressway. The additional two lanes will be completed at a later date when \ntraffic volume reaches the highway capacity. Between Noi Bai and Lao Cai, construction of 19 \ngrade-separated interchanges and five service areas is planned. \n \n23.  The scope of the Project generally covers the first stage of the highway, basically four \nlanes  for  the  Noi  Bai\u2013Yen  Bai  section  and  two  lanes  for  the  Yen  Bai\u2013Lao  Cai  section. \nEmbankment of the two additional lanes will be constructed under the Project to use surplus \nexcavated material generated in the mountainous and hilly areas. The outputs of the Project are \n(i)  a  244  km  highway,  including  10  grade-separated  interchanges  with  toll  booths  (nine \ninterchanges will be installed at a later date) and axle-weighing equipment, and five service \nareas, starting at Noi Bai and ending at Tran Hung Dao Road in Lao Cai city (the 19 km in Lao \nCai city will be constructed when traffic demand is about to reach capacity of Tran Hung Dao \nRoad); (ii) electric, communication, and tolling systems for the highway and associated facilities, \nand VEC\u2019s highway O&M equipment and vehicles; and (iii) capacity building of VEC on project \nimplementation management, corporate financing management, planning and implementation of \nhighway O&M, and safeguard planning and implementation. Land for the right-of-way for the \nultimate lane configuration, the 19 interchanges, and the five service areas will be acquired \nunder the Project. The Tran Hung Dao Road has six lanes and a wide median, and is partially \naccess-controlled. International traffic will use this road between the cross-border facilities at \nLao Cai and the project highway. Access roads, underpasses, and overbridges connecting land \n ", "8 \nand communities on either side of the highway will be provided at 500-meter intervals on \naverage, to ensure an appropriate balance between social impacts and construction costs. \n \n24.  VEC  will  strengthen  its  existing  environmental  unit  and  establish  a  social  and \nresettlement unit (SRU) within its technical department. These units will be responsible for \nproviding overall guidance for social and environmental safeguards. Also, VEC will establish \nfour  field  offices  in  the  project  provinces  to  work  with  the  provincial  and  district  people\u2019s \ncommittees and the project supervision consultant. VEC will also gain experience on a large-\nscale project implementation management, social and environmental safeguards, corporate \nfinancing management, and O&M of the highway. \n \n25.  The cities and provinces along the highway have some of the worst HIV levels in Viet \nNam and the GMS. The Project will include technical assistance\u2014the core component will be \nan HIV, illicit drugs and human trafficking prevention program\u2014to minimize exposure of local \npopulation to HIV during and after the construction stage, and to mitigate the increased risk of \nillicit drug use and human trafficking that may result from the Project. Key outputs of the TA \ncomponent will include (i) increased awareness of HIV-AIDS, STIs, drugs, and human trafficking \namong local communities, road contractors and workers, and local authorities; (ii) behavioral \nchanges  among  construction  workers,  local  communities,  and  sex  workers;  (iii)  improved \naccess to affordable, high quality condoms, HIV and STI-related services, and other health \nservices and products in project area; (iv) increased collaboration among key players for drug \nand trafficking prevention; and (v) an improved HIV-AIDS and STI monitoring system. \n \nC.  Special Features \n26.  Subregional Highway Network Development. Entry of PRC traffic into Viet Nam is \nlimited to the Lao Cai border area at present. Likewise, entry of Vietnamese traffic into the PRC \nis limited to the Hekou border area. Freight is transshipped by workers from truck to truck at the \nborder areas. This results in high transportation costs and longer haulage times. The GMS \ntransport corridor concept, of which the highway is an integral section, will enhance social and \neconomic activities by removing border-crossing barriers. The governments of Viet Nam and \nPRC agreed to implement the GMS Cross-Border Transport Agreement for the Lao Cai\u2013Hekou \nborder, which streamlines cross-border operations and grants transit traffic rights for traffic \ntransiting to or from the territory of other signatories of the Agreement. Travel time on the \ncurrent Kunming\u2013Hai Phong route currently averages about 2 days for passenger cars and 3 \ndays for trucks. The proposed highway will reduce travel times between Hanoi and Lao Cai from \n7 hours to 3 hours for passenger cars, and from 10 hours to 4 hours for trucks. Taking into \nconsideration  expressway  construction  in  Yunnan  Province,  and  the  streamlining  of  cross-\nborder operations, travel from Kunming to Hai Phong will be reduced to about 1 day once the \nproject highway is completed. This decrease in travel time and cost could induce international \nfreight originating in Kunming to shift from PRC ports to Viet Nam ports via the Kunming\u2013Hai \nPhong  Transport  Corridor,  and  consequently  encourage  economic  activities  in  the  project \nprovinces. \n \n27.  ADF  Financing. The Project\u2019s financing plan includes a substantial portion of ADF \nsupport. This reflects two specific project characteristics: (i) the project highway, particularly the \nsection from Yen Bai to Lao Cai, passes through areas with high levels of poverty; and (ii) the \nProject has a strong subregional focus (reflecting this, the ADF allocation is sourced in part from \nADB\u2019s ADF IX subregional allocation). From a poverty perspective, the northwest area of Viet \nNam is the country\u2019s poorest. In 2004, the portion of the area\u2019s population living below the \npoverty line was about 52%, compared with a countrywide average of 23%. Much of this \n ", "9 \ndifference reflects the lack of access of the western portion of the project area to major areas of \neconomic activity, employment opportunities, etc, which the project highway will substantially \nimprove. From a subregional perspective, the ADF allocation supports the connection of two \neconomically dominant areas\u2014Hanoi\u2013Hai Phong and Kunming\u2014through a hinterland that is \nmuch less developed. The specific benefit of the ADF allocation for both of these objectives is \nthat initial toll levels on the project highway will be significantly lower than would be the case if \nonly  nonconcessional  financing  were  provided.  By  softening  the  terms  of  the  total  project \nfinancing, the toll levels can be lowered to socially acceptable levels, and thus the highway can \nbe accessible to a much wider section of the population, while maintaining the financial viability \nof VEC and the Project.  \n \n28.  Ports Capacity. Hai Phong and Cai Lan are major ports in northern Viet Nam. The Hai \nPhong port has a planned capacity of 6 million tons per year for cargo throughput and 550,000 \ntwenty-foot equivalent units per year for container throughput. Only midsized vessels can enter \nthe port because of its shallow depth. The port mainly serves Southeast Asia. Freight traffic at \nthe port is reaching its capacity. The Cai Lan port has a capacity of 15 million tons per year for \ncargo throughput. Large-size vessels can enter the port, and it serves destinations outside \nSoutheast Asia. The volume of cargo handled in 2006 was about 1.5 million tons, and the \nvolume of containers was about 110,000 twenty-foot equivalent units. Since land transport costs \nwere higher because of its geographic disadvantage compared to Hai Phong port, the Cai Lan \nport still has sufficient cargo and container handling capacity. The improved National Road 18 \nconnects Noi Bai to these ports. Completion of the Bai Chay Bridge on National Road 18 in \n2006 effectively removed the geographical disadvantage of the Cai Lan port. The Project\u2019s \ntraffic demand forecast indicates that the growth rate of freight volume will accelerate to an \nannual rate of 4.6\u20136.1% by 2022. It is expected that these ports will be able to accommodate \nthe increased trading demand. \n \n29.  International Trade Zone. The Government\u2019s policy provides incentives to potential \ninvestors in frontier economic zones, through public sector financing for ground clearance, \ninfrastructure development, exemption of land rent, and labor training support. The Lao Cai \ninternational trade center and Kim Thanh free trade zone are being constructed in the Lao Cai \ninternational border area. Construction of the Hekou economic zone near the new international \nbridge is also planned on the PRC side. Agroforestry and aquatic products in Viet Nam, and \nelectric and mechanical products and chemicals in Yunnan province (PRC) will be, at least \ninitially,  significantly  traded  commodities.  Involvement  of  project-affected  households  in  the \nmarkets in the free trade zone will be an integral part of the income restoration program set out \nin the Project\u2019s REMDP.   \n \n30.  Development of Special Industrial Zones. Almost all of the special industrial zones in \nnorthern Viet Nam are located around Hanoi and along the national roads between Hanoi and \nHai  Phong.  This  concentration  has  raised  environmental  concerns  and  led  to  unbalanced \nsocioeconomic conditions. The Government, therefore, is prioritizing the development of special \nindustrial zones west of Hanoi, along the proposed project highway. \n \n31.  Tourism Development. Tourism along the Kunming\u2013Hai Phong Transport Corridor has \ngreat potential. Sa Pa and Bac Ha in Lao Cai province are famous summer retreats and are \nhome to ethnic minority villages that are of interest to tourists. Ha Long Bay, near Hai Phong, is \nregistered as natural world heritage site. Yunnan province (PRC) also has several tourist spots, \nincluding one registered as a world heritage site. However, the two areas are poorly linked, \nespecially since the railway in Yunnan province stopped passenger services between Kunming \nand Hekou, on the border with Viet Nam. The Project will strengthen tourism links between the \n ", "10 \ntwo countries. Tours highlighting the two countries\u2019 natural, cultural, and ecological features will \nbe very attractive to international and domestic tourists. \n \n32.  Mobility of Local Population. Local communities, particularly those living below the \npoverty line, have poor access to economic opportunities, education, and health services. This \nis largely caused by poor road infrastructure, particularly on the right bank of the Red River, \nsince the existing roads travel along the left bank and there is very little cross-river access. The \nhighway will provide an immediate and significant benefit to communities in this area that have \nnever  had  good  road access.  Bus  stops  will  be  installed  in  towns  and  villages  along  the \nhighway.  This  will  provide  employment  opportunities  for  the  local  population,  and  improve \naccess to socioeconomic services. \n \n33.  Toll Setting and Tolling System. The highway will be tolled as a closed system. The \ntoll amount will vary depending on vehicle classification and distance traveled. A card-type toll \ncollection system will be introduced. The toll levels will be set from the perspectives of social \nacceptance and VEC\u2019s financial sustainability. The willingness-to-pay survey and the project \nfinancial study indicated that a level of D800 per km, which is equivalent to $0.05 per km for \npassenger cars, meets the two requirements. However, VEC will make a final determination of \nappropriate toll levels before the highway is opened to public traffic. Periodic review of the toll \nlevels will be required to adjust for inflation and unanticipated costs. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n \n34.  The project investment cost is estimated at $1,216 million, including local taxes and \nduties,  as  shown  in  Table  1  below.  Detailed  cost  estimates  by  expenditure  category  and \ndetailed cost estimates by financier are in Appendix 4. ADB will finance the whole cost for the \ncivil works, consulting services, and equipment, including all local taxes and duties imposed on \nthese,  as  well  as  VEC's  incremental  administration  cost.  All  financing  charges  are  to  be \ncapitalized. The Government will finance the whole cost for the mine-clearance works and land \nacquisition and resettlement. Local taxes on the civil works, equipment, and the mine-clearance \nworks are estimated at 12% of the base cost, consisting of 10% for value-added taxes (VAT) \nand 2% for corporate income taxes. Local taxes on the consulting services are estimated at \napproximately 20% of the base cost, consisting of 10% for VAT, 5% for corporate income taxes, \nand  approximately  5%  for  personal  income  taxes.  In  all,  local  taxes  are  estimated  at \n$82.8 million equivalent.  \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n \n35.  The Government has requested a loan of $896 million from ADB\u2019s OCR, and a loan \nequivalent to $200 million from the Special Funds resources of ADB to help finance the Project. \nThe OCR loan will have a 27-year term, including a grace period of 7 years, an interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.35% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. The grace and maturity periods are extended to \nreduce  the  toll  levels  of  the  highway  and  ensure  the  financial  robustness  of  VEC.  The \nGovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The ADF loan will be denominated in special drawing rights \n(SDR) with a term of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years, an interest charge of 1% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and \n ", "11 \nconditions as set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. An additional $1 million will be \nfinanced by the grant from the Cooperation Fund for Fighting HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific \n(para. 53). \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amount a \nA.

The ADB loans will finance 90% of the total project cost (Table 2). The remaining cost, \n$120 million, will be financed by VEC. The Borrower of ADB\u2019s OCR and ADF loans will be the \nGovernment of Viet Nam. The entire OCR and ADF loan proceeds will be onlent. VEC will \nborrow the loans from the Ministry of Finance through subsidiary loan agreements, on terms \nacceptable to ADB and at ADB\u2019s interest rate applicable to the loans plus an onlending fee \npursuant to the Borrower\u2019s regulations.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank (OCR)    896.0    74 \nAsian Development Bank (ADF)    200.0    16 \nVietnam Expressway Corporation    120.0     10 \n  Total  1,216.0  100 \n \nADF = Asian Development Fund, OCR = ordinary capital resources. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "12 \n37.  The ADB loans will finance all of the local taxes imposed on ADB-financed civil works, \nconsulting services, and equipment in the amount of $82.4 million. This is 6.8% of the total \nproject cost. Counterpart funds should best be allocated for land acquisition and resettlement, \nand mine-clearance works, as these activities need to start before loan effectiveness. As the \ncounterpart funding is $120 million (10% of the total project cost), all of which is required for the \nland acquisition and resettlement activities, ADB\u2019s financing should cover all of the local taxes \non the remaining ADB-financed project components. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n38.  The Executing Agency for the Project will be VEC. VEC will have overall responsibility \nfor  project  implementation  and  formal  correspondence  with  the  line  ministries,  provincial \nauthorities,  and  ADB.  VEC  will  establish  a  project  management  team  (PMT)  to  manage \nimplementation of the Project. VEC will strengthen the environmental unit by increasing its \nenvironmental specialist staff by at least five additional persons, and establishing an SRU within \nits  technical  department  to  provide  overall  guidance  on  social  and  resettlement  matters, \ncoordinating closely with MOT and the local authorities. SRU will be headed by a senior social \ndevelopment  and  resettlement  officer  and  six  social  development  and  resettlement  staff \nmembers. The PMT, comprising a headquarters office in Hanoi and four field offices in Vinh \nPhuc, Phu Tho, Yen Bai, and Lao Cai provinces, will have responsibility for day-to-day project \nimplementation. The headquarters office will comprise staff in the Project Implementation Unit 2, \nthe implementing agency for the TA loan, and specialists from the environmental unit and SRU. \nEach field office will be staffed with a director, engineers, accountants, social and environmental \nspecialists, and other specialists. One environmental unit staff member and one SRU staff \nmember will be assigned in each project field office as full-time members of the PMT. The field \noffices will coordinate with the provincial people\u2019s committees and district people\u2019s committees \non  civil  works,  environmental  management,  implementation  of  the  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement activities, and livelihood development and income restoration program. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n39.  The Project will be implemented over a period of 4 years for completion in June 2012. \nThe overall implementation schedule for the Project is presented in Appendix 5.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n40.  All  procurement,  except  for  the  mine  clearance  works  that  will  be  financed  and \nimplemented by the Government, will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). The Project\u2019s procurement plan and a list of proposed contract packages are \nin Appendix 6.  \n \n41.  The civil works to construct all the highway structures, including road embankments and \npavements, bridges, tunnels, underpasses, drainages, slope protection works, environmental \nmitigation works, interchanges and toll booths, service areas, guide signs, variable message \nsigns, and O&M offices, will be divided into eight packages to be procured under international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB) procedures. The typical length of each package will be about 30 km, \nwith each one costing $60 million\u2013$120 million. Electric, communications, and tolling system for \nthe highway and associated facilities, which will cost an estimated $23 million, and vehicles for \nthe highway O&M, which will cost  an estimated $2 million, will be procured under ICB. \n ", "13 \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n42.  The objectives of the consulting services are to (i) supervise the civil works for the \nhighway construction; (ii) assist VEC in undertaking an environmental impact assessment (EIA); \nland acquisition, resettlement, income restoration, and social development activities; (iii) assist \nVEC with undertaking procurement of equipment for the highway O&M; and (iv) develop the \nskills of VEC staff on project implementation management, environmental management, land \nacquisition and resettlement, social development assistance, corporate financing management, \nand highway O&M. The outline of the consulting services is provided in Appendix 7. \n \n43.  The  consulting  services  will  be  implemented  by  an  international  consulting  firm  in \nassociation  with  national  consultants.  The  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  project \nmanagement, supervision of highway construction works, highway O&M, road traffic information \nsystems,  EIAs  and  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs),  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement,  income  restoration  programs,  social  development,  financial  analysis,  and \nprocurement assistance. Duration of the consulting services will be about 46 months. It is \nenvisaged that about 510 person-months of international experts and about 6,200 person-\nmonths of national experts will be required. The international consulting firm will be recruited \nusing  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  (QCBS)  and  full  technical  proposal  procedure  in \naccordance with Guidelines on Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The \nquality\u2013cost ratio for QCBS is 80:20. The Government and VEC were advised that for the \nrecruitment of consultants, advance contracting is the normal procedure and that ADB\u2019s support \nof  advance  contracting  does  not  commit  ADB  to  approve  the  loan  project  or  finance  the \nconsultant recruitment costs. \n \n  5.  Incremental Administration \n \n44.  ADB will finance VEC\u2019s incremental administration cost for project management, such as \n(i) salary, per diem for field visits, and travel cost of staff in the PMT; and (ii) vehicles, office \nequipment,  communication,  and  electricity  of  the  VEC  offices.  VEC  will  maintain  separate \nrecords for the incremental administration costs, and will submit to ADB (i) an annual operating \nplan, projected financial statements, anticipated debt obligations, and estimated incremental \nadministration costs\u2014to be estimated based on an acceptable standard costing method for \ncharging incremental costs to the Project\u20143 months before the referred fiscal year starts, and \n(ii) an audited statement in the annual audit of accounts confirming that the charged services \nwere duly provided to the Project.  \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n45.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  and  VEC.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin the loan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n46.  To ensure transparency and good governance, VEC will publicly disclose on its website \ninformation on how loan proceeds are being used. For each procurement contract VEC will \n ", "14 \ndisclose (i) the list of participating bidders, (ii) name of the winning bidder, (iii) basic details on \nbidding  procedures  adopted,  (iv)  amount  of  the  contract  awarded,  (v) list  of  goods  and/or \nservices  purchased,  and  (vi)  intended  and  actual  utilization  of  loan  proceeds  under  each \ncontract. VEC will also disclose details of resettlement reports on its website. The website will \nbe updated within two weeks of each contract being awarded. Also, VEC will submit internal and \nexternal resettlement monitoring reports to ADB every quarter. The resettlement reports will be \nuploaded onto VEC\u2019s website within two weeks of their submission. Moreover, the Government \nwill ensure that all of VEC\u2019s project staff are fully aware of and comply with the Government\u2019s \nand  ADB\u2019s  procedures,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  procedures  for  (i) implementation, \n(ii) procurement,  (iii)  use  of  consultants,  (iv)  disbursement,  (v)  reporting,  (vi) monitoring,  and \n(vii) prevention of fraud and corruption. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n47.  Loan disbursement will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  between  the \nGovernment and ADB. The Project\u2019s funds flow diagram is provided in Appendix 8. The loan \nproceeds will be disbursed directly to the contractors, the consultants, and the suppliers of the \nequipment,  based  on  an  approved  contract  under  the  direct  payment  procedure.  The \ncommitment  letter  procedure  is  also  applicable  to  payment  to  the  equipment  suppliers. \nPayments for the incremental administration cost will be made from an imprest account held at \na commercial bank acceptable to the Government and ADB, under ADB\u2019s imprest account \nprocedure as shown in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The imprest account is to be \nestablished for the OCR and ADF loans. The initial deposit to the imprest account will be based \non estimated expenditures for the first 6 months of the project implementation or $300,000, \nwhichever is lower. The statement of expenditure procedure will be used to reimburse eligible \nexpenditures and liquidate advances to the imprest account to facilitate project implementation. \nThe ceiling for each payment under the statement of expenditure procedure is $50,000. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n48.  VEC will maintain separate financial records and accounts adequate to identify financing \nresources received and project expenditures, including goods, works, and services financed out \nof the loan proceeds and local funds. The loan accounts and related financial statements will be \naudited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards by an auditor acceptable to ADB. \nVEC will submit annual audited reports and related financial statements to ADB within 6 months \nof the end of each fiscal year. The audit opinion will include (i) a detailed description of the \nsource of funds and expenditures made; (ii) an assessment of the adequacy of accounting and \ninternal controls systems with respect to project expenditures and other financial transactions, to \nensure safe custody of project-financed assets; (iii) a determination as to whether VEC has \nmaintained  adequate  documentation  for  all  financial  transactions,  specifically  including  the \nstatement of expenditure and imprest account procedures; and (iv) confirmation of compliance \nwith loan covenants on the debt service coverage ratio and debt\u2013equity ratio of VEC. \n \n49.  The  PMT,  on  behalf  of  VEC,  will  make  satisfactory  arrangements  for  reporting  the \nprogress of project implementation. The PMT will monitor project implementation in accordance \nwith the implementation schedule, and will keep ADB informed through quarterly progress \nreports of any significant deviations from the schedule. The quarterly reports will summarize \ninformation in detailed Project reports, including basic data related to the Project, utilization of \nfunds,  achievement  of  immediate  development  objectives,  implementation  progress, \nenvironmental  management  and  monitoring,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  progress, \n ", "15 \ncompliance with loan covenants, and major issues and problems. Within 6 months of physical \ncompletion, the PMT will submit through VEC a project completion report to ADB, which will \nprovide a detailed evaluation of the project design, costs, performance of the project supervision \nconsultants  and  contractors,  the  above  performance  indicators,  social  and  environmental \nimpacts, economic and financial assessment, and such other details as may be requested by \nADB. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n50.  The project design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1) was discussed by MOT, \nVEC, and ADB during the loan Fact-Finding mission. VEC will implement a systematic project \nperformance monitoring and evaluation system that indicates: (i) the effectiveness of project \nimplementation,  including  (a)  the  precise  nature,  timeliness,  cost,  and  quality  of  physical \ninfrastructure implemented in the Project; (b) the integrity of resettlement and related programs; \nand (c) the extent to which the HIV, illicit drugs, and human trafficking prevention program is \nimplemented and its impacts; (ii) the effectiveness of the Project with regard to its anticipated \neffect on economic and social development, as indicated by at least the following indicators (a) \nper capita income and poverty rate in the project area, (b) level of cross-border trade at Lao Cai, \n(c) passenger and freight vehicle operating costs on the project highway and between key \nlocations, (d) cost for freight and fare for passenger movement between the selected locations \n(these indicate the impact of the Project on the community), (e) traffic volume at selected \nlocations and travel time between the selected locations, (f) number of traffic accidents, and (g) \nnumber of new small and medium businesses and employment of local people. The impacts of \nimproved road access on low-income households will receive particular attention in measuring \nthe effectiveness of the Project. Disaggregated monitoring indicators by gender and ethnic \nminority will be developed for monitoring social benefits, economic opportunities, resettlement \nactivities, the income restoration program, road safety, and the HIV, illicit drugs, and human \ntrafficking prevention program. \n \n51.  Within 6 months of the loan effectiveness, VEC, assisted by the project supervision \nconsultants,  will  establish  baseline  data  for  the  performance  indicators  and  targets  for \nevaluating project performance in relation to the Project's impacts, outcomes, and outputs. The \nperformance  indicators  and  targets  will  be  measured  6  months  and  3  years  after  project \ncompletion, and compared with the baseline data. VEC will submit a report summarizing key \nfindings of the project performance monitoring and evaluation to ADB. \n \n10.  Project Review \n \n52.  In addition to the regular review mission every 6 months, ADB will undertake special \nreview missions. First, an inception review mission will be fielded to review land acquisition and \nresettlement, the mine clearance works, and procurement of the project supervision consulting \nservices and civil works. The mission will also address issues that VEC is encountering and is \nabout to encounter. Second, a midterm review will be undertaken in mid-2010 to assess (i) \noverall progress of project implementation, (ii) the income-restoration status of project-affected \nhouseholds, (iii) performance of project supervision consultants and contractors, (iv) status of \ncompliance with the loan covenants, and (v) need for any changes in the project scope or \nschedule to achieve the project impact. Third, a project completion review mission will be fielded \nabout 1 year after project completion. There will also be special reviews as required to address \nissues that arise during project implementation. \n \n \n ", "16 \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n53.  ADB is financing an ongoing regional technical assistance for fighting HIV/AIDS in Asia \nand the Pacific,17 from which $1 million will be allocated to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nalong the project highway during and after the construction stage and to mitigate the risk of illicit \ndrug use, drug trafficking, and people trafficking that may result from the Project. VEC is the \nExecuting Agency for the TA subproject, and will be responsible for overall coordination among \nthe steering committees to be established and partners such as Vietnam\u2019s Administration of \nHIV/AIDS Control, the provincial people's committees, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of \nLabor, Invalids, and Social Affairs, the Ministry of Education, the Women\u2019s Union, the Public \nSecurity, the Ethnic Minority and Religion Committee, the Youth Union, and other relevant civil \nsociety organizations working in the project area. The TA subproject will be implemented over 4 \nyears starting at least 4 months prior to the commencement of highway construction activities. A \nsummary of the TA subproject is provided in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits \n \n54.  The traffic volume on the existing roads in the project area has been increasing at about \n12% per annum for the last 7 years. In certain sections, the capacity is saturated. If the project \nhighway is not constructed, traffic growth will be suppressed and transport costs will increase. \nThe congested traffic movements will slow economic growth in the project area. The forecast \ndaily traffic volume on the Noi Bai\u2013Viet Tri section, for example, is expected to grow from \n15,300 vehicles in 2012 to 47,600 vehicles in 2022, a 12% average annual growth rate. It will \nthen grow more slowly at 5% per annum to reach an average of 77,600 vehicles in 2032 \n(Appendix 9). The highway provides additional road capacity of 80,000 vehicles per day for the \nNoi Bai\u2013Yen Bai section, and 20,000 vehicles per day for the Yen Bai\u2013Lao Cai section. \n \n55.  The major project beneficiaries will be (i) highway users, including cargo forwarders, bus \noperators, and tourists; (ii) local residents, who will benefit from improvements in mobility and \nlower prices of commodities and transport services; (iii) local labor involved in the construction \nworks and supply of materials during implementation and in operation of the highway; (vi) local \nand international manufacturers and traders, who will be able to establish new businesses and \nincrease production capacity; (v) VEC, which will receive toll revenue from highway users; \n(vi) bus operators, who will be able to expand their businesses; and (vii) port authorities in \nnorthern Viet Nam, whp will see increased cargo volumes. \n \n56.   Economic Benefit. The Project\u2019s economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was estimated \nby comparing the major road networks in northern Viet Nam with and without the Project. \nWithout the Project, traffic will use the existing road network, which will be congested and \nexpensive to maintain because of rapidly increasing traffic. With the Project, congestion on \nexisting roads will be reduced, and traffic on both the project highway and existing roads will \nbenefit from faster travel. The project economic costs include (i) capital costs and resettlement \ncosts,  excluding  tax  and  price  contingency;  and  (ii)  the  highway\u2019s  O&M  cost.  The  project \neconomic benefits are reduced vehicle operating costs and reduced passenger travel times, \nwhich will be enjoyed both by traffic on the highway and traffic on the existing roads. The Project \n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2006. TA 6321-REG: Technical Assistance for Fighting HIV/AIDS in Asian and the Pacific (Financed by the \nCooperation Fund for Fighting HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific). Manila. The Fund was established in 2005 with \nan initial grant of approximately $15 million from the Government of Sweden. \n ", "17 \nyields an EIRR of 18.2%, indicating that the Project is economically viable. Sensitivity analysis \nconfirms the robustness of the Project\u2019s economic viability. Changes in the key variables, such \nas a 10% increase in investment cost, a 10% reduction in benefits, and a 1-year delay in \ncompletion of the Project, do not significantly impact the economic viability. The economic \nanalysis of the Project was extended to analyze the distribution of project net benefits by \ndetermining the project effects for various beneficiaries, including road users, labor, and the \nGovernment (Appendix 10). \n \n57.  Financial Benefit. The financial viability of the Project is assessed by (i) the financial \ninternal rate of return (FIRR) analysis and (ii) the Project\u2019s financial statements analysis. The \nFIRR has been assessed by comparing the project financial return to the weighted average cost \nof capital (WACC) in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines for the Financial Management and \nAnalysis of Projects (2005). The financial analysis examined the aggregated costs and benefits \nfrom toll revenues of the highway. Toll rates are set at D800 per km in the analyses. The FIRR \nof the Project has been calculated over a period from 2008 to 2039 using constant prices for \n2007. The projected financial statements of the Project are prepared in current terms using the \nsame period as the FIRR analysis. The Project\u2019s FIRR is estimated at 6.5% after tax, which \nexceeds the WACC of 2.6%, indicating that the Project is financially viable. Sensitivity tests \nshow  that  the  FIRR  exceeds  the  WACC  even  under  a  range  of  adverse  scenarios.  The \nprojected financial statements show that the Project will have enough retained cash flow to \ncover its O&M costs and annual debt service. The FIRR calculation and the projected financial \nstatements are shown in Appendix 11. \n \nB.  Project Impacts \n \n58.  Improved transport infrastructure is critical for sustained rapid economic growth and \npoverty reduction and it can also contribute to regionally balanced and equitable economic \ngrowth by stimulating the production of goods and increasing trades. Road connectivity under \nthe Project will contribute to the ability of the poor to benefit from economic growth in the long \nrun. One of the benefits of the Project is that it will reduce travel time between Lao Cai, Hanoi, \nand Hai Phong by up to 50%. The Project will benefit vehicle operators in terms of lower \ntransport costs and reduced travel times. The reduced travel time from Hanoi to Lao Cai could \nincrease tourism in Sa Pa and surrounding areas. Increased tourism will generate additional \ndemand for locally produced goods and services. In addition, lower transport costs and reduced \ntravel time will improve access to schools, higher education facilities, and medical facilities in \nthe provincial towns.  \n \n59.  The highway\u2019s construction will involve a large amount of embankment construction and \nexcavation, acquisition of residential and agricultural lands, and resettlement of project-affected \npeople,  although  the  final  alignment  has  been  developed  to  ensure  that  environmentally \nsensitive areas are avoided, and impacts on involuntary resettlement are kept to a minimum, as \nrequired  by  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995). \nNonetheless, since the social and environmental impacts of the highway\u2019s construction are \nsignificant, in accordance with ADB\u2019s safeguard policies an EIA and a full REMDP have been \nprepared. Details of the social assessment, including a gender strategy, are shown in the \nSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (Appendix 12).   \n \n60.  Environmental Impacts. The alignment of the highway avoids environmentally sensitive \nareas. The project area is mainly agricultural and dominated by rice paddies. People have \nsettled  and  cultivated the  area  for  centuries.  The  EIA  identified  no  habitats  of  vulnerable, \nthreatened, or endangered flora or fauna within the Project\u2019s impact areas. However, the EIA \n ", "18 \nidentified several major environmental impacts during the construction period, and proposed \nmitigation measures and an EMP. Sand extraction in rivers for road embankment works will be \ndone at licensed areas, with care taken to minimize environmental impacts. Surplus excavated \nmaterial generated in the mountainous and hilly sections will be used for embankment of the \nadditional two lanes in the Yen Bai-Lao Cai section of the highway. The total volumes of \nexcavation and embankment for the Project will be balanced as much as possible to minimize \nthe need for soil disposal. The contractors will be required to prepare site-specific EMPs to \nmanage environmental impacts at construction camps and construction sites based on the EMP \nof the EIA. Public consultations were carried out in the local language in project-affected areas. \nThe  project  design  has  taken  local  concerns  into  consideration  and  provides  several \nunderpasses and overpasses to maintain the functions of existing local roads and irrigation \nsystems during the highway\u2019s construction and operation. Noise barriers will also be installed in \nenvironmentally sensitive areas based on noise simulation results. A capacity-building program \nwill  be  provided  to  VEC  during  project  implementation  to  strengthen  its  capacity  in \nenvironmental management and monitoring. \n \n61.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement. The right-of-way of the highway is a minimum of \n50 meters in accordance with the highway standards in Viet Nam. It is estimated that about \n2,000 hectares of land needs to be acquired for the highway construction. Productive land, such \nas rice paddies, fish ponds, vegetable gardens, orchards, and woodland, accounts for 1,800 \nhectares (90%) of all affected land. Nonproductive land such as residential land, nonagricultural \nland, and other land (waterways, footpaths, and graveyards) account for 200 hectares (10%). A \ntotal of 5,458 households (approximately 24,560 persons based on an average household size \nof 4.5) will be adversely affected by losses of assets and sources of livelihood. A total of 3,998 \nhouseholds will lose more than 10% of their productive land, and the majority of these will lose \nall of their productive land. The socioeconomic surveys also identified 1,083 households that \nwere  headed  by  women;  83 households  that  were  headed  by  disabled  persons;  1,210 \nhouseholds living below the officially set poverty threshold; and 1,586 households that were \nheaded by persons within the retirement age bracket of the government. \n \n62.  Ethnic Minority People. The main ethnic minority groups in the project area are Tay, \nThai, Phu La, Nung, Giay, Moung, and Hamong, and together they represent 18% of the total \npopulation in the project area. Ethnic minority groups such as Tay, Thai, and Moung who inhabit \nlower mountain areas have long traditions of wet-rice cultivation. They also traditionally interact \nmore with the majority Kinh. Although the ethnic minority groups retain their traditional culture, \nreligion and social organization, they have adopted mainstream Vietnamese language and \nagricultural practices. Of the 5,458 project-affected households, 136 (approximately 2.4%) are \nfrom ethnic minority groups. The socioeconomic and inventory-of-losses surveys indicated that \nimpacts on the ethnic minority groups and the main ethnic group are the same. However, to \nensure that ethnic minority groups are not marginalized during the process of implementation of \nresettlement activities, an ethnic minority development plan is incorporated in the resettlement \nplan. \n \n63.  Gender. The resettlement impact on women-headed households is significant since \nwomen-headed households constitute 20% of the total affected households. In addition, women \nfrom poor households living below the poverty line will be also affected by resettlement. Poor \nwomen and women-headed households in the project area face more economic risks (like loss \nof productive assets resulting from land acquisition) and social risks (posed by HIV/AIDS, road \nsafety, and possible human trafficking) than males. To address loss of livelihood of poor women \nand women-headed households, the Project includes a livelihood program targeted at women in \n ", "19 \nthe project districts. Details of impacts are given in the Summary of Poverty and Social Strategy \n(Appendix 12).  \n \nC.  Project Assumptions and Risks \n \n64.  Financial Sustainability of VEC. VEC is currently processing or implementing three \nprojects: (i) the Cau Gie\u2013Ninh Binh Expressway Project (50 km, under construction); (ii) this \nProject; and (iii) the Ho Chi Minh City\u2013Long Thanh\u2013Dau Giay Expressway Project (55 km). The \ntotal  capital  expenditure  for  the  three  projects  will  exceed  $2  billion.  VEC  will  obtain  toll \nrevenues from 2010, when operation of the Cau Gie\u2013Ninh Binh Expressway starts. An analysis \nof the financial projections of VEC was made. Based on a toll rate of D800 per km for passenger \ncars, to be adjusted every 5 years to account for inflation, VEC will have net operating losses \nuntil 2012 because toll revenues will not be sufficient to cover depreciation costs and interest in \nthe  initial  operation  stage.  However,  VEC  can  maintain  positive  accumulated  cash  flow \nthroughout the operating period to cover debt service. Net operating profit will be generated \nfrom 2013 with the projected rapid increase of traffic volume. The estimated debt\u2013equity ratio \nwill be about 89:11 in 2012, and will improve to 74:26 in 2020 as a result of an increase of \nretained earnings. Despite its large-scale investments, VEC will maintain its financial viability in \nthe  medium  and  long  term  without  additional  subsidies  in  the  operation  period.  VEC  will \nestablish  a  financial  management  system  to  ensure  that  investments  target  financially \nsustainable expressway projects, through which VEC may monitor cost recovery, plan traffic \nforecast and toll levels, make projected financial statements, and develop a debt management \nstrategy. The financial and institutional analyses of VEC are provided in Appendix 13. \n \n65.  Environment. The Project is environmental category A. The EIA for the Project was \nprepared by VEC with assistance from a consultant engaged under the TA loan. A summary \nEIA for the Project was prepared and circulated to the Board and made publicly available \nthrough ADB\u2019s website on 25 July 2007. The EIA assessed anticipated physical, ecological, and \nsocial  impacts  of  the  selected  alignment  of  the  highway,  and  prescribed  environmental \nmitigation measures. Public consultation meetings for the EIA were held twice in each province, \nwhile focus group meetings were held at the commune level. The useful suggestions provided \nat the meetings were incorporated into the design of the Project and the EIA. An EMP has been \nprepared and will be updated during detailed design of the highway. The bidding documents for \nthe civil works will include contract clauses requiring the contractor to implement the EMP. The \nenvironmental mitigation cost during construction is estimated at about $3.3 million. VEC will \nensure that the contractors prepare a site-specific EMP based on this EMP and the actual \nsituation on-site. Supplementary Appendix B provides the EIA. \n \n66.  The Project will cause social impacts related to (i) displacement of local people because \nof land acquisition; (ii) loss of productive land; (iii) increased traffic risks for people living and \nworking along the highway, resulting from large traffic volumes and higher vehicle speeds on \nthe highway; (iv) increased risks of exposure to HIV, and increased risk of trafficking of women \nand children during the construction and post-construction phases, because of large volumes of \ntransit  traffic  along  the  highway  and  in  the  border  area.  Unless  compensation,  income-\nrestoration measures, and livelihood activities related to involuntary resettlement are delivered \non time, these impacts could pose significant risks to the livelihoods of the project-affected \nhouseholds. The Project has been formulated to minimize these risks  \n \n67.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement. The involuntary resettlement category for the \nProject is Category A. VEC has prepared a full REMDP based on the socioeconomic and \ninventory of losses surveys. A summary of the REMDP is in Appendix 14, and the full REMDP is \n ", "20 \nprovided in Supplementary Appendix C. Consultations, public meetings, and village discussions \nwith affected households and local officials were carried out during the resettlement planning \nprocess. These activities will continue during updating and implementation. Compensation, \nassistance, and resettlement boards (CARBs) have been established in the project provinces \nand in the project districts to update the approved REMDP, based on detailed design of the \nhighway,  and  implement  land  acquisition,  resettlement,  livelihood  restoration,  and  income-\nrestoration activities in each CARB\u2019s administrative jurisdiction. The estimated resettlement cost \nis $100 million equivalent. VEC will undertake detailed measurement surveys after the detailed \ndesign has been completed; and prepare and submit district-level updated REMDPs to ADB for \napproval before land acquisition and resettlement starts. VEC will be responsible for internal \nmonitoring of resettlement activities, and also contract an independent agency for external \nmonitoring and evaluation. The internal and external monitoring reports will be uploaded to \nVEC\u2019s website, and will be submitted to ADB every quarter and uploaded to ADB\u2019s website until \nresettlement  and  income  restoration  programs  are  complete.  The  project  supervision \nconsultants will provide formal and on-the-job training to VEC and the CARBs. \n \n68.  Gender  and  Ethnic  Minorities.  The  gender  and  ethnic  minority  strategy  includes \ncapacity building and consultation workshops with project-affected households to increase their \nunderstanding of resettlement issues (compensation, entitlement, grievance procedures, etc.) \nand  to  develop  skills  for  effective  planning  of  livelihood  activities.  The  project  supervision \nconsultants will include specialists to help VEC and provincial people's committees manage \nresettlement, ethnic minority, and gender-specific activities.  \n \n69.  HIV, Illicit Drugs, and Human Trafficking. In 2005, it was estimated that the project \narea (excluding Hanoi) had 6,000 HIV cases. HIV has mostly spread through injecting drug use \nand sex workers, with current prevalence among injecting drug users exceeding 50%. Injecting \ndrug use, commercial sex, and trafficking of women and children are rapidly increasing in Lao \nCai, the international border town with Yunnan province (PRC). Lao Cai has the worst HIV \nsituation among the cluster, with 181 reported cases in 2003, of which 75% were associated \nwith  injecting  drug  use. 18 Lao  Cai  has  around  1,000\u20131,500  travelers  passing  through  its \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\ninternational border gate on a daily basis. Among them are traders, long-distance truckers, \nconstruction  and  transportation  workers,  and  porters. 19 With  improved  transportation  and \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\ninfrastructure, enabling 1-day travel time between Kunming and Hai Phong via Lao Cai, the \nexisting  risks  and  vulnerabilities  for  HIV  transmission,  drug  use  and  trafficking  along  the \nhighway will significantly increase if targeted risk mitigation initiatives are not implemented. The \nProject will increase road traffic and mobility of goods and people, and consequently, could \nincrease  risks  of  HIV-AIDS  and  STIs;  human  trafficking;  and  use  of  illicit  drugs  in  local \ncommunities,  especially  among  poor  women  and  children.  The  TA  subproject  (para.  53) \nprovides the HIV, illicit drugs, and human trafficking prevention program to minimize local \npopulations\u2019 exposure to these risks. \n \n70.  Road Safety. The accident rate on access-controlled highways or expressways is much \nlower than that on access-free general roads. However, when the highway starts operation, \ntraffic accidents involving highway users and the local people may occur. To minimize this risk, \nthe Project provides a road safety program with a focus on awareness of access-controlled \nhighway operations through the project supervision consulting services, immediately after the \n                                                 \n18  Viet Nam Commission for Population, Family and Children, Ministry of Health and Population Reference Bureau. \n2006.

Moreover, vehicle overloading is one of the factors that jeopardize \nhighway road safety, and also the life of the highway. Axle-weighing equipment will be installed \nat the Noi Bai and Lao Cai interchanges to control vehicle overloading. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n71.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  VEC  have  given  the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Operation and Maintenance.

VEC  will  ensure  that  the  contract \ndocuments for works under the Project include specific measures in accordance \nwith the EIA and ADB's Environment Policy to mitigate negative environmental \nimpacts caused by the construction and to give due consideration to prevention \nof damage to the natural environment in the design, construction, operation and \nmaintenance of the Project. \n ", "22 \n(viii)  VEC will ensure that it allocates adequate budget and staff resources for EMP \nimplementation and monitoring. VEC will ensure that the Project complies with \nbest  environmental  practices  and  meets  the  mitigation  and  monitoring \nrequirements in a timely manner as described in the EIA.  \n(ix)  VEC will ensure that the design, construction, operation and maintenance of \nproject facilities are carried out in accordance with the EMP, ADB\u2019s Environment \nPolicy and the Government\u2019s laws and regulations. In accordance with the EMP, \nVEC will cause (a) the contractors engaged under the works contracts to comply \nstrictly with all environmental impact mitigation and monitoring requirements set \nout in the EMP and contract documents, and (b) the consultants engaged for \nconstruction supervision to monitor closely compliance by the contractors with \nthe environmental impact mitigation and monitoring requirements. \n(x)  Resettlement and Ethnic Minorities. The Government and VEC will ensure that \nany involuntary resettlement will be carried out in accordance with the agreed \nREMDP, ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), and the Government\u2019s \nlaws and regulations on involuntary resettlement. In case of differences between \nthe  Government\u2019s  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB's  Involuntary  Resettlement \nPolicy, ADB's Policy will prevail. The Government will ensure that VEC carries \nout the specific measures in regard to ethnic minorities as stipulated in the \nupdated REMDP, and the Project will be implemented in accordance with the \napplicable laws and regulations of the Borrower and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous \nPeoples (1998). \n(xi)  The Government and VEC will ensure that the local authorities do not commence \nany land acquisition and relocation activities until the updated REMDP has been \nprepared  following  detailed  design  and  that  the  updated  REMDP  has  been \nreviewed and approved by ADB.  \n(xii)  The Government and VEC, whenever feasible, will allow project-affected people \nto cultivate land inside the right-of-way that is not required during the first phase \nof  the  highway  project  to  annual crops  (e.g.,  rice  and low-lying  crops).  The \ntemporary permit to utilize this land will be given on condition and with clear \nunderstanding by all concerned that, in the event that such land is required for \nimproving  or  carrying  out  the  second  phase  of  the  highway  project,  the \npossession of the land will be relinquished to VEC at no cost to the Government. \n(xiii)  VEC will ensure that notices to commence for a particular length of the project \nhighway are only issued to the contractor responsible for that length when (a) \ncompensation payment and relocation to new sites completed for a particular \nlength  have  been  satisfactorily  completed,  in  accordance  with  the  updated \nREMDP approved by ADB; (b) rehabilitation assistance for the particular length is \nin  place;  and  (c)  the  particular  length  required  for  civil  works  is  free  of  all \nencumbrances. \n(xiv)  VEC will be responsible for internal monitoring of resettlement activities, and also \ncontract an independent agency for external monitoring and evaluation 1 month \nafter  the  commencement  of  REMDP  updating.  The  internal  and  external \nmonitoring reports will be submitted to ADB every quarter and uploaded onto \nVEC\u2019s  website  within  two  weeks  of  their  submission  until  resettlement  and \nincome restoration programs are complete.  \n(xv)  Social Protection. VEC will ensure that all works contracts under the Project \nincorporate provisions and budgets to the effect that contractors (a) comply with \nthe  Government\u2019s  applicable  labor  laws  and  related  international  treaty \nobligations and do not employ child labor; (b) provide safe working conditions \nand water and sanitation facilities for male and female workers; and (c) provide \n ", "23 \nequal wages to male and female workers for work of equal value, (d) provide \nday-care services for female construction workers, and (e) carry out HIV/AIDS \nand human trafficking education and awareness campaigns in the construction \ncampsites with such campaigns being held in coordination with the Government\u2019s \nprograms and other initiatives. \n(xvi)  VEC will fully implement the HIV, illicit drugs, and human trafficking prevention \nprogram in the construction camps, towns, and rural areas of the project area.  \n(xvii)  Gender.

Road Asset and Road Traffic Conditions \n \n1.  The total length of Viet Nam\u2019s road system is approximately 210,000 kilometers (km), \nincluding 17,300 km of national roads, 17,450 km of provincial roads, 36,400 km of district roads, \n7,000 km of urban roads, and 131,500 km of rural roads. Out of the national road length, 83.5% \nis paved. National roads are country\u2019s most important lifelines, but in 2004 only 44.8% of \nnational  roads\u2019  total  length  was  in  good  condition.  The  national  road  system  was  mainly \nconstructed with two lanes. \n \n2.  The Viet Nam economy has been growing rapidly, with gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrowing at an average annual rate of 7.5% from 2001 to 2005. Even though vehicle ownership \nis  rising  quickly,  car  ownership  is  still  low  and  road  traffic  is  dominated  by  motorcycles. \nMotorcycle ownership has grown by over 20% per year, and totaled more than 11 million in \n2003, or 140 per 1,000 people. The number of four-wheel vehicles and articulated trucks grew \nslightly faster than GDP, from 400,000 in 1997 to 600,000 in 2002 (7.5 vehicles per 1,000 \npeople). The shift from motorcycles to passenger cars will happen in the near future. When it \ndoes, the national road system as it stands will not be able to accommodate traffic demand; \nthus, construction of highway networks throughout the country should start as soon as possible.  \n \nB.  Expressway Network Development Plan \n \n3.  Road traffic is concentrated on national roads and around major urban centers. Rising \nlevels of motorization is a major challenge to transport planners and policy makers, especially in \nlarge urban areas and on primary intercity roads. The Government has started to undertake \ndevelopment of high-quality highways with design operating speeds exceeding current national-\nroad  levels\u2014in  a  word,  expressways.  The  Vietnam  Expressway  Corporation  (VEC)  was \nestablished in October 2004 to develop expressways in Viet Nam. VEC is a fully state-owned \ncompany under the Ministry of Transport. On the basis of preliminary economic and financial \nappraisals and rationalization, the expressway construction programs shown in Table A2.1 were \nproposed.1 Over the next 5 years the Government plans to implement the following expressway \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nprojects: (i) Cau Gie\u2013Ninh Binh (50 km), (ii) Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai (264 km), (iii) Ho Chi Minh City\u2013\nLong Thanh\u2013Dou Giya (55 km), (iv) Trung Luong\u2013Can Tho (95 km), and (v) Ninh Binh\u2013Thanh \nHoa (63 km). \n \nTable A2.1: Expressway Network Development Plan \n \nLength  Estimated Cost \nTerm \n(km)  ($ million) \nShort term (2006\u20132015)  1,968  11,556 \nMedium term (2016\u20132025)     875     5,238 \nLong term (2026\u2013onwards)  1,969  10,804 \nTotal  4,812  27,598 \n \nNote: Estimated cost is based on 2007 prices. \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n     \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2007.

There are 54 toll stations located on 26 national roads in the country. Toll revenue \ncollected by tolling agencies is distributed as follows: (i) 5% is delivered to the Vietnam Road \nAdministration for general funds to modernize toll-collection technology; (ii) 15% is reserved for \noperational expenditures and equipment purchase by tolling agencies; (iii) principal and interest \nfor roads financed by credit are paid; and (iv) the remainder is delivered to state\u2019s treasury. The \ncurrent toll level for national roads is shown in Table A2.2. For national and provincial roads \nfinanced by joint ventures between the state and investment partners, the Ministry of Finance \nand relevant provincial people\u2019s councils determine the toll based on class and length of the \nroads and the investors\u2019 proposals. The financial analysis found that current toll levels can cover \nexpressway operation and maintenance costs, but not capital costs including interest repayment. \nA new toll setting for expressways is required.  \n \nTable A2.2: Current Toll Level for National Roads \n(D per km) \n \nVehicle  Unit Toll Rate \nMotorbike or Lambretta     143 \nTourist Car or Jeep     143 \nSmall Coach (<25 seats)     143 \nBig Coach (>=25 seats)     214 \nLight Truck (<2.5 tons)     214 \nMedium Truck (>=2.5 tons, 2 axles)      314 \nHeavy Truck (>3 axles)     571 \nContainer Truck  1,143 \n \nD = dong, km = kilometer. \nSource: Ministry of Finance. \n \n5.  A willingness-to-pay survey was carried out among potential users of the Noi Bai\u2013Lao \nCai Highway. It was found in an interview with 58 private car owners in Viet Tri, Yen Bai and \nLao Cai that almost 100% of the respondents were willing to use the highway at a toll rate of \nD600 per km ($0.04 per km), and around 70% were willing to use it at a toll rate of D800 per km \n($0.05 per km). However, only 20% of the respondents were willing to use the highway at a rate \nof D1,200 per km ($0.08 per km). \n \n6.  For international container cargo forwarders in Kunming, transport costs to the shipping \nport is a principal concern. The highway toll is a major  cost for container trucks carrying \ncontainer cargo. The base transport cost (fuel and tolls) from Kunming to the nearest ports in \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) is estimated at about $510. The distance of this route is \n1,053 km. The toll rate for container trucks was adjusted to be eight times the rate for private \ncars, as shown in Table A2.2. The transport costs from Kunming to ports in Viet Nam using the \nKunming\u2013Hai Phong Transport Corridor will be $490 with a toll rate of D8,000 per km, and $410 \nwith a toll rate of D4,800 per km. The distance of the transport corridor route is 813 km. This \nindicates that the advantage of the Kunming\u2013Hai Phong Transport Corridor would disappear for \ninternational cargo forwarders in Kunming if the toll level is set at D8,000 per km (equivalent to \nD1,000 per km for passenger cars); and that they would be willing to use the transport corridor \nand ports in Viet Nam if the toll level is set at D4,800 per km (equivalent to D600 per km for \npassenger cars). \n \n                     ", "  Appendix 2  29 \n7.  In Viet Nam, expressway passenger toll rates of D800\u2013D1,000 per km for passenger \ncars have been approved. As shown in Table A2.3, the toll rates for passenger cars in the \nPhilippines, Indonesia, PRC, Thailand, and Malaysia range between D300 and D740 per km per \npassenger car. The toll rates are in proportion to GDP per capita in these countries, with the \nexception of except PRC. It is found that the approved toll rate in Viet Nam is on the high side \ncompared to other Asian countries. The high toll rate is related to VEC\u2019s high debt\u2013equity ratio. \nToll levels should be both socially acceptable and financially viable. The toll analysis was \nexamined under various financing conditions, and indicated that lengthening the grace period of \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources loan is the most effective way to lower the toll level and ensure \nVEC\u2019s financial robustness. With a 5-year grace period and 25-year maturity period, toll levels of \ngreater than D1,000 per km would be required to ensure the financial sustainability of VEC. \nHowever, toll levels can be lowered to D800 per km by lengthening the grace period from 5 \nyears to 7 years and the maturity period from 25 years to 27 years. A detailed analysis of VEC\u2019s \nfinancial projection is given in Appendix 13. \n \nTable A2.3: Expressway Toll Levels Comparison in Asia \n \nGDP per Capita in 2005  Toll Rate per car \nCountries  ($)  (D/km) \nViet Nam  610  800\u20131,000 \nPhilippines  1,088  292 \nIndonesia  1,237  325 \nPRC  1,416  737 \nThailand  2,736  500 \nMalaysia  4,989  636 \n \nGDP = gross domestic product, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \nSources:  APEC  outcomes  and  outlook,  Chengyu  Expressway,  Sichuan \nExpressway Company Limited, Jasa Marga, Expressway and Rapid \nTransit Authority of Thailand, and Manila Expressway. \n \nD.  Road Safety \n \n8.  Road safety is a serious issue in Viet Nam. Between 1999 and 2002, the number of fatal \naccidents increased from 7,100 to 13,200, an increase of more than 20% per annum. In the last \nfew years the number has remained a little more stable. In 2004, although the rate was lower, \nwith 11,400 fatalities, road accidents still cost the Viet Nam economy $600 million,2 about 1% of \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nthe gross domestic product. The traffic fatality ratio of 12 per 10,000 vehicles is 5\u201310 times of \nthe ratio in developed countries. According to the National Transportation Safety Council of \nVietnam, 80% of all accidents in 2003 were caused by poor driver behavior, including 33% for \nspeeding, 17% for dangerous overtaking, 16% for driver fatigue and 6.5% for driving while \nintoxicated. The condition of roads and vehicles was a minor cause of accidents. About one half \nof road accidents occurred on national roads, particularly those passing through populated \nareas, and one quarter occurred on urban roads. The \u201curbanization\u201d of road space in Viet Nam \nis a major contributing factor to high accident rates, as many people live within a few meters of \nroad sides. Unless urgent action is taken, road traffic fatalities in Viet Nam are predicted to \ncontinue at current or higher levels. Road safety improvement was clearly recognized as a high \ngovernment priority by the Government of Viet Nam, as reflected in their National Policy on \n                                                 \n2 2005. The source of this estimate is the paper, \u201cThe Cost of Road Traffic Accident in Vietnam\u201d, published in the \nproceedings of the Eastern Asia Society for Transport Studies, 2005. \n ", "30  Appendix 2 \nAccident and Injury Prevention 2002\u20132010 and their National Program for Traffic Safety 2001\u2013\n2005, which were prepared by the National Traffic Safety Committee. \n \n9.  Development  of  highway  and  expressway  networks  is  one  of  the  most  effective \napproaches to improving road safety and reducing the number of traffic accidents. Accident \nrates on access-controlled highways and expressways are much lower than that on access-free \ngeneral roads. The Project ensures that all important safety measures are in place. Independent \nroad safety audits of the project roads will be carried out during final design and construction \nand before the opening of the project highway. Axle-weighing equipment will be installed at the \nNoi Bai and Lao Cai interchanges to control vehicle overloading in the corridor. VEC will \nconcentrate on the engineering, the road safety audit, blind-spot improvement, and operational \nissues, while the police will deal with traffic law enforcement.  \n \nE.  Cross-Border Operation and Trade \n \n10.  About 1 million tons of cargo is transported annually across the Hekou\u2013Lao Cai border \ncrossing points. The daily truck volume observed at the border is approximately 100. Two-\nwheeled carts are also broadly used for trading vegetables and fruits. PRC trucks are currently \nallowed to go inside Lao Cai city to transship their cargos to the Vietnamese trucks, and vice-\nversa. Transshipment increases transport cost. The governments of Viet Nam and PRC agreed \nto begin implementing the Cross-Border Transport Agreement on the Hekou\u2013Lao Cai border in \nSeptember 2007. This will result in new procedures. The opening of the border crossing to \ninternational  through  traffic,  which  will  enable  qualified  vehicles  and  operators  to  continue \nthrough to destination, is one major change in the nature of operations. The formalities and \nprocedures will continue in much the same way as before, but will be streamlined to ensure that \nimmigration, custom clearance, and quarantine be processed at a single window of the border \nfacilities. Consequently, transport costs and travel times will be reduced in both countries, and \ntrading volume and traffic volume will increase substantially. \n \nF.  Future Stage of the Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Highway \n \n11.  Expressways are high-speed divided highways with access controlled, and should have \n4 or more lanes to allow fast traffic to overtake slow traffic. The two-lane structure for the Yen \nBai\u2013Lao Cai section of the highway is not an expressway. However, construction of a two-lane \nhighway designed to the expressway standard, as a tentative configuration, in medium traffic \ndemand areas is a reasonable approach. Compared to the configuration of expressways, a two-\nlane highway still has some disadvantages. Overtaking slower traffic is allowed only on limited \nsections. The design capacity of two-lane highways is 20,000 vehicles per day (passenger car \nunit), which is only 25% of four-lane highways. The risk of accidents on two-lane highways is \nmuch lower than on general roads, as access to the highway is controlled. However, there \nremains a risk of head-on collisions caused by reckless overtaking. Construction of an additional \ntwo lanes should be considered within 10 years of the project highway\u2019s opening. \n \n12.  The Kim Thanh Bridge in Lao Cai city, which is being constructed across the Red River, \nwill be a new international entry point for the Kunming\u2013Hai Phong Transport Corridor. In the \nfuture, Viet Nam and PRC will establish new cross-border facilities on both sides of the bridge. \nWhile the Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Highway will be constructed up to the Tran Hung Dao Road under \nthis Project, it will be connected to the bridge only when traffic demand approaches the highway \ncapacity of the Tran Hung Dao Road. \n \n                     ", " \n  Appendix 3  31 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ROAD SUBSECTOR \n($ million) \nLOAN  TOTAL \nLOAN  DATE \nPROJECT  PROJECT SCOPE  CLOSING  PROJECT  FINANCING \nNO.

The consulting services will be provided by an international consulting firm, joint venture, \nor consortium of consulting firms, in association with national consulting firms, which will be \nselected by VEC in accordance with Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time).  \n \n3.  The selected project supervision consultants (PSCs) will establish a main office in Hanoi \nheaded by the team leader, and a site office in Vinh Phuc, Pho Tho, Yen Bai, and Lao Cai \nprovinces  to  provide  adequate  coverage  of  the  project  highway.  The  main  office  will  be \nresponsible for highway design, procurement assistance, project performance monitoring and \nevaluation, development of the skills of VEC staff, and overall assistance to VEC. The site \noffices, headed by resident engineers, will supervise the civil works in accordance with the \ncontracts,  undertake  environmental  management  and  monitoring,  and  assist  with  land \nacquisition, resettlement, the income restoration program, and social development activities to \nbe undertaken by VEC and provincial and district people\u2019s committees. \n \nA.  Scope of the Project  \n \n4.  The Project will construct a 244 km grade-separated and access-controlled highway, \nincluding 10 interchanges with toll booths and five service areas, starting at Noi Bai and ending \nat Tran Hung Dao Road in Lao Cai city. The Noi Bai\u2013Yen Bai section is designed as a four-lane \ndual carriageway, with potential for upgrading to six lanes. The Yen Bai\u2013Lao Cai section is \ndesigned as a two-lane single carriageway, with potential for upgrading to a four-lane dual \ncarriageway. The additional two lanes will be completed at a later date when traffic volume \nreaches the highway capacity. The right-of-way for the highway will be acquired based on the \nultimate lane configurations. The civil works will be executed through eight contract packages, \nranging in estimated value from $60 million to $120 million (Table A6.3). All eight packages will be \nprocured based on international competitive bidding (ICB) following prequalification procedures. \n \n5.  The highway\u2019s construction will involve a large amount of embankment construction and \nexcavation, acquisition of residential and agricultural lands, and resettlement of project-affected \npeople.  Since  the  social  and  environmental  impacts  of  the  highway\u2019s  construction  are \nsignificant,  an  environmental  impact  assessment  and  a  resettlement  and  ethnic  minority \ndevelopment plan (REMDP) have been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy \n(2002), Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), and Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n \n6.  Electric, communication, and tolling systems and associated facilities, and vehicles for \nhighway O&M such as patrol cars, maintenance trucks, water tankers and sweepers, will be \nprocured following ICB procedures.  \n                     ", "Appendix 7  37 \n7.  VEC\u2019s current human resources and organizational structure needs to be strengthened \nto  implement  the  Project.

International Traffic Demand Analysis \n \n1.  ADB made a multimodal traffic demand analysis in 2004\u20132005 for the existing and \nplanned expressways, the existing roads, and the existing rail transport routes in the project \narea  covering  Kunming  in  Yunnan  province,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  ports  in \nGuangxi province, and Hai Phong and Cai Lan ports in Viet Nam.1 The base case consists of \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nthe existing road and railway network in Viet Nam, and the existing and planned expressway \nand railway network in PRC. The project case adds the Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Highway and the \nupgraded Yen Vien\u2013Lao Cai Railway on the base case. Route and mode choice was made \nbased  on  users\u2019  transport  costs.  International  traffic  demand  was  forecast  based  on  a \ncomparison between the base case and the project case.  \n \n2.  The multimodal traffic demand analysis showed that after project completion, passenger \ntraffic for the highway would increase by 17%, freight traffic would increase by 11%, and railway \ntraffic would decrease by 5% at Lao Cai as a result of a modal shift to road transportation. In \ntotal, traffic demand at Lao Cai will increase by approximately 10%. This increase will be caused \nby (i) reduced travel time on the Kunming\u2013Hai Phong Transport Corridor and transshipment \ncost savings at Lao Cai\u2013Hekou border, and (ii) diversion of freight traffic in Kunming from the \nports in Guangxi province (PRC) to Hai Phong and Cai Lan Ports in Viet Nam. The international \nroad traffic volume passing through the Lao Cai border is only about 410 vehicles per day, as \nestimated in 2004 in the multimodal traffic demand analysis, as PRC trucks are not allowed to \ngo outside Lao Cai city and Vietnamese trucks are not allowed to go outside Hekou city. As \nentry of PRC trucks into Viet Nam and vice-versa will be allowed under the Cross-Border \nTransport Agreement on the Hekou\u2013Lao Cai border, which became effective in September 2007, \ninternational daily traffic is expected to reach 810 vehicles in 2012 and 2,100 vehicles in 2022. \n \nB.  Traffic Demand Forecast in Viet Nam \n \n3.  The Project\u2019s traffic demand was forecast for 30 years assuming a highway toll rate of \nD800 per kilometer for passenger cars. The forecast was conducted for freight and passenger \nmovement in Viet Nam across all transport modes\u2014land, water, and air. For the forecast, Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency\u2019s VITRANSS national model2 was updated and prepared in \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nCUBE 3 software.  In  the  model,  a  four-step  traffic  estimation  was  used,  covering  (i)  trip \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\ngeneration and attraction, (ii) trip distribution, (iii) modal split, and (iv) trip assignment. Cross-\nborder traffic and induced traffic were included in the forecast. \n \n4.   Traffic  Survey. The traffic survey was made at 13 locations in the corridor of the \nproposed Project. The daily traffic volumes ranged from 26,000 vehicles near Hanoi to about \n1,500 vehicles in Lao Cai province. Roadside interviews were undertaken at nine sites. A \nsample rate of 10\u201330% for the six low-volume traffic sites and 9\u201310% for the three high-volume \ntraffic sites was achieved. The collected survey data as well as the estimated international traffic \nvolume were used to validate the model\u2019s origin\u2013destination data in the base year. \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2005.

Trip Generation and Attraction. The trip generation and attraction module in the model \ncalculated the number of the trips that start and finish in particular traffic zones. Every province \nin northern Viet Nam is represented as a traffic zone in the module. The number of person-trips \ngenerated or attracted by a traffic zone was determined as a function of population and zonal \ngross domestic product (GDP). For freight movements, the amount of freight generated or \nattracted  to  a  particular  traffic  zone  was  in  tonnage  for  a  particular  commodity.  This  was \ndeveloped for 14 commodity groups and was determined as a function of the commodity\u2019s \nsurplus or deficit, regional GDP, and urban population. \n \n6.  Trip Distribution. The trip distribution module estimated the number of trips between \norigin and destination zones for freight and passengers and developed future origin\u2013destination \nmatrixes. For the passenger trip distribution, interzonal traffic was determined using a pseudo \nGravity model with a function of trip generation and attraction, and travel distance.4 For the \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nfreight trip distribution, a Frater procedure5 was adopted to forecast the future travel patterns \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nfrom the present travel patterns. The future freight distribution was calculated by an iterative \nprocess of modifying origin\u2013destination matrix values based on the present distribution patterns, \nand future generation and attraction growth rates.  \n \n7.  Modal Split. The modal split module was the procedure for splitting interzonal traffic into \nthe various travel modes. For passenger trips, travel modes (car, air, rail, inland water, and bus) \nwere selected by using a function of travel time, urban population, and zonal GDP per capita. \nThe modal split of freight trips reflected the existing modal designations into the future. \n \n8.  Trip Assignment. The trip assignment module was the allocation of the interzonal trips \nto various travel routes, which was done only for road transport. The routes within the road \nnetwork were selected by a cost function of travel time, vehicle operating cost, and the project \nhighway toll, affected by road conditions and traffic congestion. About 55% of the diverted traffic \non the project highway is expected to come from the parallel highways (National Roads 2 and \n70) in 2022, while the rest (45%) is expected to come from the other road network. \n \n9.  Traffic Forecast. After validating the transport model in the base year, traffic demand \nwas projected by taking into account expected increases in population and GDP. The GDP \ngrowth  rate  was  projected  to  be  6.1%  in  2005\u20132012,  and  4.6%  in  2012\u20132022.  Demand \nelasticities for passenger and freight traffic were based on the above-mentioned multimodal \ntransport study. For passenger traffic, growth in vehicle ownership was used as a proxy for \ngrowth in vehicle traffic, and an elasticity of 2 was derived from experience in other Southeast \nAsian countries in the last 15 years. For freight traffic growth, the general freight traffic of Viet \nNam and PRC and the international freight traffic through the Haiphong Port were analyzed. \nThe statistical analysis showed an elasticity of 1 for the freight traffic. Generated traffic caused \nby the Project was included in the traffic forecast, with generated truck traffic comprising 26% of \ntotal  traffic  between  Lao  Cai  and  Yen  Bai  and  12%  of  total  traffic  southeast  of  Viet  Tri. \nGenerated passenger traffic of 22% between Lao Cai and Yen Bai, and 18% southeast of Viet \nTri, were also included. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4 A mathematical model based on an analogy with Newton's gravitational law to estimate traffic volumes between two \ntraffic zones.

The Project will construct 244 km of four-lane and two-lane highway from Noi Bai to Lao \nCai. The Project will be implemented over 4 years; economic analysis covers the 20 years \nfollowing the launch of full operation. The Project\u2019s economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was \nestimated  by  comparing  the  with-Project  and  without-Project  scenarios  for  the  major  road \nnetwork in northern Viet Nam. Without the Project, traffic will use the existing road network, \nwhich will be congested and expensive to maintain because of rapidly increasing traffic. The \nwithout-Project scenario assumes expansion to four lanes of parallel National Road 2. With the \nProject, the congestion of existing roads will be reduced, and traffic on the project highway and \nexisting roads will benefit from faster travel. The economic analysis includes an alternative \nanalysis, an assessment of a valuation of project costs and benefits, and, finally, an assessment \nof the EIRR. Risk and sensitivity analyses have been undertaken for key risk variables to \nexamine the robustness of the economic viability. \n \nB.  Alternative Analysis \n \n2.  Possible alternative interventions were considered1 in 2003 to meet growing transport \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\ndemand in the project area as part of the national transport network plan. Alternative analysis \nproposed six alternatives in three transport modes (roads, railways, and inland waterways). The \nalternatives were reviewed based on travel time, improvement costs, technical designs, social \nand environment impacts, and economic and financial viability. The analysis concluded that the \nonly two of the six options were viable in these aspects: (i) the proposed Project, and (ii) the \nrailway upgrading project, to which ADB approved a loan in 2006.2 While the railway project is \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nto partly meet the increasing demand, it will not completely satisfy the various kinds of traffic, \nparticularly passenger traffic and high-value general cargo, which requires a more flexible and \nresponsive mode to meet the needs of a market economy. Therefore, the Project was proposed \nto satisfy the needs.  \n \nC.  Valuation of Costs and Benefits \n \n3.  The project economic costs include (i) capital costs\u2014including physical contingency land \nacquisition\u2014and resettlement costs, but excluding the tax and price contingency; and (ii) the \nProject\u2019s operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. The financial costs are revalued at economic \nprices by separating the cost items into tradable and nontradable goods and services. The \ntradable goods and services are converted to the domestic price numeraire using a shadow \nexchange rate factor of 1.04. A shadow price was used to put an economic value on the wages \npaid to unskilled labor. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.55 was used to convert the financial \nwage rate to an economic opportunity cost of labor. The land cost was based on the opportunity \ncost. The capital costs are estimated to be about $780 million at constant 2007 prices. The \nannual O&M costs and the periodic road maintenance costs are included in the analysis.  \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2003.

The diverted traffic to the project highway was \ntaken into consideration in economic and financial viability assessment of the railway project. \n                     ", "Appendix 10  45 \n4.  The economic benefits include savings in vehicle operating costs (VOC), passenger time \nsavings on the project highway, and passenger time savings on the existing road network in Viet \nNam.  Reduced  VOC  is  the  main  source  of  economic  benefits  for  the  Project.  VOC  are \ncalculated for 11 vehicle types using the World Bank\u2019s roads economic decision model, taking \ninto account the differences of terrain, road alignment, road roughness, and travel speed (Table \nA10.1). Traffic diverting from existing roads to the project highway would travel at faster speeds \non a smoother road surface, with better vertical and horizontal alignment, less congestion, and a \nshorter journey distance. Traffic remaining on the existing road network would also benefit from \na reduction in traffic volume and congestion. All these changes affect vehicle speeds and VOC \nfor all vehicle types. Savings in travel time will be seen on both the project highway and the \nexisting road network. After completion of the Project, the travel time between Noi Bai and Lao \nCai is expected to be 3\u20134 hours\u2014a reduction in journey time of about 7\u20138 hours. The values of \ntravel time savings, outlined in Table A10.2, were used for estimating the benefit of reduced \ntravel times. Work-related travel time, which accounts for 30% of total travel time, was evaluated \nfor passenger cars, and 25% of total travel time was evaluated as work-related for the buses. A \nshadow wage rate factor of 0.55 was applied to unskilled labor. Non-work-related trips were \nestimated at 30% of the value of work-related trips. \n \nTable A10.1: Estimated Economic Vehicle Operating Costa \n($ per km, 2007 prices) \n \nGeneral Roads \nVehicle Type  Expressway \nFlat  Rolling  Mountainous \n         \nMotorcycle  \u2014  0.031  0.033  0.033 \nCar  0.183  0.224  0.239  0.260 \nLarge Bus  0.305  0.352  0.389  0.445 \nHeavy Truck  0.494  0.576  0.634  0.726 \n \na The VOCs are selected from the typical speed on each road.

For international container cargo forwarders in Kunming, transport costs to shipping \nports are a principal concern. If the base transport cost (fuel and tolls) for the Kunming\u2013Hai \nPhong Transport Corridor route is lower than that for the domestic route, they could divert to the \nKunming\u2013Hai Phong Transport Corridor route.

Macroeconomic Impact \n \n10.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  was  about  $52.8  billion  in  2005.  An \ninvestment as large as this $1.2 billion Project could impact the country\u2019s macroeconomic \nsituation.  Possible  impacts  of  the  Project  on  the  country\u2019s  overall  debt  sustainability  and \ndomestic inflation were studied. A simulation of ordinary capital resources (OCR) lending of \n$500 million per year from 2007 to 2020 shows an impact on additional 0.32% debt service ratio \nto the foreign currency amount obtained through exports of goods and services. Viet Nam\u2019s debt \nservice ratios during the period are estimated at about 2.0% in the base case scenario, which \nare far below 15% of the debt burden threshold. The OCR lending for the Project in the amount \nof about $250 million per year will therefore have little impact on the debt sustainability of the \ncountry. Moreover, it will not affect domestic inflation, because the local currency cost during the \nproject implementation period would count only 0.4% of the expected investment in Viet Nam. \nTaking also into account that targeted annual growth of GDP in Viet Nam is more than 7.5%, \nwhich is roughly a $4 billion-a-year GDP increase, the Project\u2019s macroeconomic impacts are \nfound to be very minor. \n \n                     ", "Appendix 11  49 \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS  \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The financial viability of the Project is assessed by the financial internal rate of return \n(FIRR) analysis and the Project\u2019s financial statements analysis. The FIRR analysis will assess \nthe project return, comparing it to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The Project\u2019s \nfinancial statements analysis will focus on the debt service repayment capacity and capital \nstructure of the Project. The financial analysis will examine the aggregated costs and benefits \nfrom  toll  revenues  of  the  Noi  Bai\u2013Lao  Cai  Highway.  The  FIRR  of  the  Project  has  been \ncalculated over  the  period  2008\u20132039  using  constant  2007  prices. The  projected  financial \nstatements of the Project are prepared in current terms, over the same period as the FIRR \nanalysis. The foreign inflation rate is assumed to be 1.2%, and the local inflation rate 5.0% \nduring the projection period. The foreign exchange rate used for 2007 is D16,200 to $1. \n \nB.  Financial Analysis \n \n2.  Assumptions.  The  main  project  costs  are  capital  investment  and  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) costs. The capital costs for the highway includes civil works such as \nearthwork, pavement and bridges, and land acquisition costs. The O&M costs include annual \nexpenses incurred in operating the highway. All capital costs are expressed in real terms using \nconstant 2007 prices. The FIRR was calculated on the basis of the base costs, excluding price \ncontingency and financial charges during development. \n \n3.  The financial benefits for the Project are measured by the operating revenue from toll \ncollection by users. The revenues are projected based on the forecast of future traffic and a \nbase toll rate of D800 per kilometer (km) per passenger car. Tolls to be applied to the operation \nto the Project are in constant 2007 prices. The residual values are not included in the analysis. \n \n4.  WACC.  The FIRR was compared with the WACC of 2.6%. The WACC, after-tax, in real \nterms was calculated using estimated capital mix and costs of funds as shown in Table A11.1. \nThe assumptions are as follows: (i) the applicable 5-year swap rate plus a provision for ADB\u2019s \nspread of 0.6% and on-lending premium of 0.2% are used for ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \n(OCR) debt; (ii) ADB\u2019s spread of 1.0% plus an on-lending premium of 0.2% is used for ADB\u2019s \nAsian Development Fund (ADF) debt; and (iii) the cost of counterpart funding is assumed to be \n9.0%, which is the estimated interest of government-guaranteed bonds. The cost of debt is \nadjusted to reflect the impact of an income tax of 28%. The nominal cost of debt is converted to \nthe real cost of debt by applying the average domestic inflation rate for domestic debt, and the \naverage international inflation rate for foreign currency-denominated debt. \n \n5.  FIRR.  The FIRR for the Project, computed on an after-tax basis, is 6.5%. This exceeds \nthe WACC of 2.6%. The results of sensitivity tests are shown in Table A11.2. The FIRR exceeds \nWACC for each sensitivity scenario.

Financial Projections \n \n6.  Projected financial statements of the Project (income statement, balance sheet, and \ncash-flow statement) were prepared to monitor the debt service repayment capacity and capital \nstructure of the Project on a stand-alone basis.   \n \n7.  Assumptions.  The financial projections are presented in current price terms, which \ntake into account the potential impact of domestic and foreign inflation. The domestic inflation \nrate is assumed to be 5.0% per year over the analysis period, and the international inflation rate \nis assumed to be 1.2%. Depreciation of the Vietnamese dong against the US dollar is assumed \nto be 1.3% per annum, based on the historical trend of the past 5 years. Toll rates will be \nadjusted every 5 years to account for domestic inflation; there will be no real increase in toll \nrates over the project life span. A corporate tax rate of 28% is assumed, in line with corporate \ntax laws, which allows the following: (i) in the first 2 years of operational profit VEC is tax \nexempt; (ii) in the following 5 years of operational profit VEC will pay 50% of the 28% corporate \ntax; and (iii) in the years thereafter, VEC will pay the full 28% corporate tax. The 10% value-\nadded tax is included in the toll rate. \n \n8.  The  projected  O&M  costs,  comprising  annual  routine  costs  and  periodic  road \nmaintenance costs, are based on the results of engineering studies. The annual O&M costs are \napproximately $4.5 million at 2007 prices. The cost of periodic maintenance to overlay the \nhighway is assumed to be $21.3 million every 8 years starting in 2019. It is assumed that these \nO&M costs will increase in accordance with the domestic inflation rate of 5% per annum. A \ndepreciation period of 40 years is assumed, which reflects the current depreciation regulation. \n \n9.  Financing Plan.  The project cost will be funded by ADB\u2019s OCR and ADF loans, and by \nVEC. For ADB\u2019s OCR and ADF loans, VEC will borrow the funds from the Ministry of Finance \n                     ", "Appendix 11  51 \nbased on subsidiary loan agreements. It is assumed that VEC plans to borrow in Vietnamese \ndong, and will pay an on-lending premium of 0.2% per annum in addition to the interest rate of \nADB loans. \n \n10.  Financial Projections. The summary financial projection is shown in Table A11.3, and \nthe detailed financial projection is given in Supplementary Appendix D. The projections show \nthat the accumulated net cash flow remains positive, which means that VEC will not require \nsubsidies throughout the operation period. The debt\u2013equity ratio of the project is about 89:11 in \nthe opening year of 2012. In 2022, after 10 years of operation, the debt\u2013equity ratio will be \nimproved to about 77:23 because of increasing toll revenue. Although the Project will have a \ndebt service coverage ratio of less than 1.0 in 2016, the Project will have enough accumulated \ncash flow to cover the debt service. Therefore, the Project\u2019s debt service capacity is considered \nto be sufficient and sustainable. \n \nTable A11.3: Summary Financial Statements of the Project (2012\u20132022) \n($ million) \nItem  2012  2014  2016  2018  2020  2022 \nGross Revenue  45.3  62.2  78.3  119.3  137.6  197.8\nDepreciation  28.3  28.3  28.3  28.3  28.3  28.4\nInterest  0.0  0.0  54.7  52.2  49.2  45.6\nNet Operating Profit / (Loss)  4.7  15.3    (19.7) 19.0  34.2  68.0\nAccumulated Cashflow  33.1  115.1  86.5  114.7  130.4  210.0\nTotal Asset  1,128.1  1,254.5  1,171.6  1,143.1  1,102.1  1,128.3\nEquity  124.7  150.1  106.3  134.9  159.3  261.1\nLoan  1,003.4  1,104.4  1,065.2  1,008.2  942.8  867.2\nCash Available for Debt Service  33.1  43.6  63.4  99.5  111.7  138.7\nDebt Service  0.0  0.0  80.5  81.6  83.0  84.8\nDebt Service Coverage Ratio  \u2014  \u2014  0.79  1.22  1.35  1.64\nDebt to Total Assets  0.89  0.88  0.91  0.88  0.86  0.77\n \nSource: Vietnam Expressway Corporation and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n11.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam: \n \nViet Nam\u2019s record in poverty reduction has been remarkable over the last decade. During the period 2001\u20132005, Viet \nNam\u2019s economy recorded a relatively high growth rate of about 7.5% per annum. Rapid economic growth in economic \noutput, investment in business, infrastructure, and private sector, combined with the Government\u2019s targeted poverty \nreduction interventions, has resulted in a sharp decline in poverty. Poverty incidence fell from about 58% in 1993 to \n24.1% in 2004, with a corresponding increase in gross domestic product. The proposed target for the Five-Year Socio-\nEconomic Development Plan 2006\u20132010 is to reduce poor households to 15%\u201316% by 2010. While significant in terms \nof magnitude, progress in poverty reduction remains fragile, with a significant number of \u201cnear poor\u201d clustered just above \nthe poverty line. To support the Government in pursuing balanced economic growth and poverty reduction, the Country \nStrategy and Program Update 2006\u20132008 for Viet Nam and the Poverty Partnership Agreement between Viet Nam and \nADB emphasize regional cooperation through cross-border trade and access to markets within the region. Viet Nam and \nYunnan province in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) are experiencing rapid economic growth, centered on exports \nto world markets, and through increasingly bilateral trade in agriculture, aquatic, mining, and industrial products. \nSustained development requires modernization and improvement of physical infrastructure and associated services\u2014\ninfrastructure that accommodates bilateral trade and international transit traffic. The Kunming\u2013Hai Phong Transport \nCorridor is recognized by Viet Nam and the PRC as a strategic asset that enables accelerated economic growth based \non bilateral trade and transit traffic. The corridor is perceived as a cornerstone in developing the economies in Yunnan \nprovince and northern Viet Nam. The Kunming\u2013Hai Phong Transport Corridor\u2014Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Highway will help to \ndevelop the subregional transport system and improve intersectoral linkages through the development of an economic \ncorridor. Remoteness and disconnection have been identified as factors in the inability of poor people to benefit from \neconomic growth. Improved transport infrastructure is critical for sustained rapid economic growth and poverty reduction, \nand will also contribute to regionally balanced and equitable economic growth by stimulating agriculture production, \nincreasing access to employment opportunities, and facilitating better access to social services. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nFollowing ADB\u2019s Enhanced Poverty Reduction Strategy (December 2004), projects classified as general intervention no \nlonger  require  project-level  poverty  assessments.  Following  is  a  discussion  of  socioeconomic  conditions  of  the \npopulation in the project area, social impact, and risk related to the Project. The proposed Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Highway \nproject constitutes part of the Greater Mekong Subregion Eastern Economic Corridor linking Kunming in PRC and Hanoi \nand Haiphong in Viet Nam. The highway traverses the provinces of Vinh Phu, Phu Tho, Yen Bai, and Lao Cai towards \nthe Chinese border in the north. The total population of these provinces is 6.9 million (2005). Females represent 51.3% \nof the total population in the project area and ethnic minorities represent 18.3% of the population, although in the upland \nprovinces of Yen Bai and Lao Cai ethnic minorities represent 35.6% of the population. However, ethnic minority groups \nconstitute only 2.44% of the households affected by resettlement activities. The average age of the people in the project \narea is 47 years, compared to the national average of 42 years. According to social assessment in the project area, \nmore than 28.05% of the population is under 15 and 43% of the population is aged between 15 and 45. In the lowland \nRed River Delta provinces (Phu Tho, Vinh Phuc, and Hanoi) all people surveyed had completed 6 years of primary \nschooling irrespective of their gender and ethnicity. In the upland provinces of Yen Bai and Lao Cai, many people have \nalso completed 6 years of primary schooling. All these people are functionally literate in the Vietnamese language. \nAccess to secondary school at the district level is a major problem for upland people. Health indicators in the project \narea are not good in terms of upper respiratory tract infections and lung infections. Diarrhea and dysentery are common \nin the lowland areas because of poor water quality toward the end of the dry season. Poor transport links and high travel \ncosts constrain the ability of upland people to seek quality medical service. Agriculture in both lowland and upland areas \nincludes both rice crops and cash crops. Households in the upland areas also grow cash crops, rice, cassava, maize, \ntea, etc. Wage labor in the project area is another income earning strategy for poor households. In addition, economic \nactivities such as fishing, aquaculture, collection of non-timber forest products, and small business are part of the rural \nlivelihood. According to the social assessment there is substantial poverty in the project area. The Yen Bai province is \nthe poorest in the project area. The poverty level is higher in the upland provinces than in the lowland provinces.  \n ", "54  Appendix 12 \nHIV, AIDS, and other sexually transmitted diseases have been identified as major risks. The project area is contiguous \nto Yunnan province in PRC\u2014an area with a significantly high HIV/AIDS rate. This could cause negative impacts during \nthe post-construction period. The social assessment finds that 75% of respondents at the community level lack \nknowledge on HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases. The work of various international organizations suggests \nthat human trafficking seems to be an intra-country problem at present. However, the demand in Southern China for \nVietnamese brides increases the risk that young unmarried Kinh women will be trafficked. \n \nIt is expected that the project activities will bring both positive and negative social and economic changes. One of \nbenefits of the Project is that it will reduce travel time between the Port of Haiphong and the Lao Cai border post by up to \n50%. This will benefit vehicle operators, who will experience lower transport costs, and people, who will experience \nreduced travel times. Reduced travel times from Hanoi to Lao Cai could increase tourism in Sa Pa. Increased tourism \nwill generate additional demand for locally produced goods and services. In addition, lower transport costs and reduced \ntravel times could improve access to schools, higher education, and medical facilities in the district and provincial towns \nas well as in the capital city. However, the extent to which the people in the project area can take advantage of these \nservices depends on further improvement of the provincial road network and rural access roads.  \n \nAdditional project impacts relate to (i) displacement of a large number of households because of land acquisition; (ii) loss \nof productive land; (iii) increased traffic risks for people living and working along the road because of large volumes of \ntraffic and higher vehicle speeds along the expressway; (iv) increased risks of exposure to HIV and trafficking of women \nand children during the construction and post-construction phases (because of the large volumes of transit traffic along \nthe road and border area); and (v) increased flow of illegal drugs to the project area and an increased number of drug \nusers in the project area (because road improvements may provide more favorable routes for drug dealers). Poor \nwomen in the project area more are at risk economically (loss of productive assets because of land acquisition) and \nsocially (risks posed by HIV, road safety, and possible human trafficking) than males. To minimize the potential risks of \ntraffic accidents, HIV, and human trafficking, the Project includes a road safety program and an HIV, illicit drugs, and \nhuman trafficking prevention program. \n \nGiven that there is a shortage of available agricultural land in the lowland area, an effective livelihood development \nprogram in the resettlement and ethnic minority development plan (REMDP) for the affected households is critical. \nEffective planning and implementation of the livelihood development program will impact the extent to which affected \nhouseholds can overcome poverty. The strategies to address resettlement of ethnic minorities and gender issues include \ncapacity-building training and consultation workshops with project-affected households to increase their understanding of \nresettlement issues (compensation, entitlement, grievance procedures) and to develop skills for effective planning of \nlivelihood  activities.  The  supervision  consultants  will  include  specialists  to  help  the  executing  agency  manage \nresettlement, ethnic minority, and gender-specific activities. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?     Yes     No  \nDuring the feasibility study of the Project, focus group discussions, surveys, and consultations were held with the people \nin the project area, affected households, different ethnic minority groups, local government officials at the commune and \ndistrict levels, traditional leaders, mass organizations, the Vietnam Expressway Corporation and various government \nagencies.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nThe participation strategy included in the various activities of the Project includes: formation of local resettlement \ncommittees, participation of project-affected households in the detailed measurement survey, and designing a livelihood \nprogram targeted at women in the project districts. Separate consultation on resettlement issues will be undertaken with \naffected minority groups, women-headed households, and poor households. Capacity-building training of resettlement \ncommittees and project-affected households on resettlement issues will facilitate effective participation of the relevant \nstakeholders in planning and implementing the resettlement program. The road safety awareness campaign, HIV, illicit \ndrugs, and human trafficking prevention program will have community-based components to increase community \nparticipation. \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nFemales represent 51.3% of the total population in the project area. The average life expectancy at birth in Viet Nam is \n69.9; for women it\u2019s 70.2 years. Most of women in the project area have completed primary school. In the project area, \nthe main sectors in which women are involved are agriculture (lowland and upland crops), small business, social \nservices, and light industry. Most women in the project area live in rural areas and are engaged in agriculture. The \ngender division of labor in agriculture varies somewhat between upland and lowland areas and between different ethnic \nminority groups. Livestock rearing is mainly undertaken by women and children. In upland areas, it is the women and \nchildren who collect almost all non-forest timber products. In the lowlands both men and women are involved in orchard-\nrelated activities. Small business involves both men and women; however, in the uplands small businesses are mainly \n                     ", "  Appendix 12  55 \nrun by women. Women carry a heavy burden both at home and outside work. Women\u2019s involvement in commune affairs \nis low and women are marginalized in the village decision-making process. \nThe highway would create new opportunities for women by improving access to higher education, employment, and \nsocial services. However, the extent to which women can take advantage of these opportunities depends on economic, \nsocial, and cultural factors. In terms of risks of the Project to women, resettlement poses potential risks for women\u2019s \nability to work in agriculture, small businesses, and other productive activities. A large number (5,458) of households will \nbe affected by resettlement. As a result of relocation, a significant number of women will lose productive assets and/or \nlivelihood. Women-headed households (1,083) represent 20% of project-affected households. Resettlement can make \nwomen and children more vulnerable and make it difficult for women to restore their income and livelihood activities. In \naddition, the highway and the cross-border facility increase risks related to HIV and trafficking of women and children. \n \nThe gender strategy includes specific activities to ensure that project benefits reach women.  \n\u2013  The  district  compensation,  assistance,  and  resettlement  boards  (CARBs)  and  commune-level  resettlement \ncommittees will include representatives from the Committee for Ethnic Minority, the District Women\u2019s Union, the \nCommune Women\u2019s Union, and women from affected households. In addition, one male and one female \nrepresentative from each ethnic minority group will be included in the commune-level resettlement committee.  \n\u2013  At the inception of the Project, a capacity-building training program on resettlement activities will be held to \neducate commune officials and representatives of affected households (both male and female) about the \nresettlement process. Poor women, female heads of household, and ethnic minorities will all be invited to \nparticipate. The training will also include representatives of line agencies and representatives from commune-\nlevel Women\u2019s Union and Youth Union involved in resettlement committees. For ethnic minority groups, separate \ntraining in their language will be organized for both men and women, including female heads of household. The \nobjective of the training will be to provide affected communities with an understanding of resettlement issues and \nbetter access to compensation resources and information on grievance procedures. The training will include \ninformation  on  resettlement  activities,  compensation,  management  of  compensation  money,  grievance \nprocedures and impact of the Project on livelihood activities related to loss of agricultural produce and other \nproductive assets.  \n\u2013  Men and women from the households will participate in discussions related to preparation of inventory of losses. \n\u2013  Livelihood activities will be planned with active involvement of women. Needs assessment for livelihood activities \nand skills development of livelihood activities will be conducted separately for women-headed households, elderly \nwomen, and poor women.  \n\u2013  Compensation money will be given to both men and women from the households. Special attention will be paid to \npaying poor woman-headed households and ethnic minority households on time, and to developing relevant \nlivelihood activities for such households. Consultation meetings on resettlement activities will be held separately \nwith affected women, women-headed households, ethnic minority women, and elderly women.  \n\u2013  The resettlement plan will include joint registration of land rights in the names of husband and wife in instances \nwhere land is acquired.  \n\u2013  Relocation of houses in the resettlement sites will include separate discussions with women from project-affected \nhouseholds, women-headed households, and ethnic minority households for selection of sites, housing structure, \nand other social infrastructure. \n\u2013  The  consultants  will  conduct  an  HIV,  illicit  drugs,  and  human  trafficking  prevention  program  during  the \nconstruction  and  post-construction  phases,  with  active  involvement  of  communities,  relevant  government \nagencies, and nongovernment organizations. The women\u2019s union, youth union, health workers, female community \nleaders and members, and women from affected households will be involved in monitoring the program at the \nlocal level.

Introduction \n \n1.  Vietnam Expressway Corporation (VEC) was newly established in late 2004 with a \nmandate to promote expressway development. VEC does not yet own its expressway assets \nand  is  in  the  process  of  developing  three  expressway  projects.  Institutional  and  financial \nmanagement analysis of VEC was conducted to monitor its financial management capacity. \nFinancial  analysis  of  VEC  was  assessed  from  VEC\u2019s  consolidated  projected  financial \nstatements for 2010\u20132022. \n \nB.  Institutional and Financial Management Analysis \n \n2.  VEC was established as a state-owned company on 6 October 2004 by Ministry of \nTransport (MOT) Decision No. 3033. VEC\u2019s operation is mainly governed by two important legal \ndocuments: its corporate charter (VEC Charter), promulgated by MOT Decision No. 3466 of 12 \nNovember 2004; and the Law on State Enterprise. Pursuant to Decision No. 3033, VEC\u2019s main \nactivities  are  the  following:  (i)  investment  in  expressway  construction,  management,  and \nmaintenance,  and  organizing  toll  collection  on  the  national  highways;  (ii)  investment  in \nconstruction of other transport infrastructure in all modes; (iii) management and operation of \nservices  adjacent  to  its  expressways,  such  as  motels,  restaurants,  advertisements,  and \nconstruction materials; (iv) technical consulting services in the transport sector, research and \ndevelopment of national highway systems, and design and supervision of transport facility \nworks; and (v) research and development of services in areas adjacent to expressways. In \naccordance with Article 166 of the Law on Enterprises, VEC will be converted from a state-\nowned company to either a limited liability company or a shareholding company no later than 1 \nJuly 2010. \n \n3.  VEC\u2019s operations are divided into five functional divisions and three project management \nunits. VEC currently has 96 employees on staff. VEC\u2019s organizational structure was established \nin accordance with the provisions of the Law on State Enterprises and is divided into three \nlevels: (i) management board and internal audit unit, (ii) VEC\u2019s management, and (iii) eight \noperation departments including three project management units. The organizational structure is \ngiven in Figure A13. \n \n4.  The finance and accounting department is responsible for funds and asset management, \nand implementation of financial accounting and bookkeeping. VEC has issued audited financial \nstatements for the years 2004 and 2005. The financial statements are prepared in accordance \nwith the Vietnamese Accounting System issued by the Ministry of Finance. The reports include \nthe balance sheet, profit and loss reports, and cash-flow reports. These reports are prepared by \naccountants using a computerized accounting system connected to all transactions in an online \ngeneral ledger. The reports and reviewed by an internal auditing control board, and audited by \nan independent external auditor annually. The financial management system and VEC staff are \nconsidered adequate for accounting purposes. However, it is recommended that VEC develop \nits own financial information system to make a financially sustainable expressway investment \nplan that takes into account monitoring and planning cost-recovery tariff levels, forecasting \ntraffic  levels,  making  projected  financial  statements,  and  developing  a  debt-management \nstrategy.  The  setup  of  the  VEC\u2019s  financial  management  system  is  proposed  in  the  loan \ncovenants. \n ", "58  Appendix 13 \nFigure A13: Organizational Structure of VEC \n \n \n \nManagement Board\n \n \nInternal Audit / \n  Inspection Committee \nBoard of Directors\n \n \n  General Director\n \n \n \n  Deputy General Director  Deputy General Director Deputy General Director \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Adminis-  Finance  Business  Project  Cau Gie\u2013 South Noi Bai\u2013 International \n  Detpraartitvmee nt  Accaonudn ting  DPeplaanrntminegn t Technical  Ninh Binh  Expressway Lao Cai  Relations\n  Department Department PMU PMU TA Project  Division\n  PIU \n \n \nPMU = project management unit, PIU = project implementation unit, VEC = Vietnam Expressway Corporation. \nSource: Vietnam Expressway Corporation. \n \nC.  Financial Projections (2010\u20132022) \n \n5.  As mentioned in para. 2, VEC was established in late 2004 with a basic mandate to \npromote  expressway  development.  VEC  is  currently  engaged  in  the  realization  of  three \nexpressway  projects  and  estimates  that  initial  expressway  operation  will  launch  in  2010. \nTherefore, VEC will begin generating toll revenues from 2010. Unaudited financial statements of \nfiscal year 2006 show the company\u2019s modest profitability of $3 million; this income came from \ninterest earned from deposits, not from toll revenue. VEC\u2019s charter capital is D1,000 billion, or \nabout $62 million. \n \n6.  Financial Projections: The financial analysis of VEC is carried out in current terms on \nan after-tax basis. VEC\u2019s projected financial statements are prepared by consolidating VEC\u2019s \ncurrent assets and the three expressway projects that are currently under construction or at the \ndetailed feasibility study stage: (i) the Cau Cie\u2013Ninh Binh Expressway (50 km, currently under \nconstruction); (ii) the Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Highway (244 km); and (iii) Ho Chi Minh City\u2013Long \nThanh\u2013Dau Giay Expressway (55 km). Total capital expenditures on the three projects will \nexceed $2 billion. The financial projections assume that VEC will charge D800 per km for \npassenger cars and the toll rate will be adjusted every 5 years to account for inflation. Other \nassumptions, such as corporate taxes, value-added taxes, depreciation, and international and \nlocal inflation rates, reflect the assumptions used in Appendix 10. \n \n7.  Results: The financial projections of VEC and the key financial ratios are shown in Table \nA13, and the detailed financial projections are provided in Supplementary Appendix D. As \n                     ", "Appendix 13  59 \nshown in the table, VEC will have net operating losses until 2012 because the toll revenue is not \nsufficient to cover depreciation costs and interest in the initial operation stage. However, VEC \ncan maintain positive accumulated cash flow throughout the operating period to cover debt \nservices.  Gross  revenue  will  increase  to  generate  net  operating  profit  from  2013  with  the \ngradual increase of traffic volume. The debt\u2013equity level will be about 89:11 in 2012, and will \nimprove to about 74:26 in 2020 because of increase of retained earnings. Despite its large-scale \ninvestment plan, VEC will maintain its financial viability in the medium and longer term without \nadditional subsidies in the operation period. \n \nTable A13: Financial Projections of VEC (2010\u20132022) \n($ million) \nItem 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022\nGross Revenue 29.9 82.7 177.2 208.5 306.7 350.0 503.6\nO&M Expense 0.2 5.8 9.2 10.1 45.1 12.3 13.6\nInterest 38.6 38.6 38.6 98.4 103.4 101.9 100.0\nDepreciation 11.3 53.6 53.6 53.6 53.6 53.6 53.7\nNet Operating Profit / (Loss) (23.1) (23.7) 48.3 14.2 53.2 106.0 205.8\nAccumulated Cashflow 29.2 49.5 249.7 333.7 475.5 673.2 1,039.9\nTotal Asset 1,725.7 2,075.2 2,299.6 2,279.6 2,314.5 2,404.9 2,664.2\nDebt 1,498.7 1,876.0 2,007.5 1,958.6 1,883.1 1,789.7 1,682.8\nEquity 227.0 199.2 292.1 320.9 431.5 615.2 981.4\nCash Available for Debt Service 26.7 68.6 140.5 176.9 213.1 262.0 357.4\nDebt Service 38.6 38.6 38.6 140.3 148.7 150.6 153.1\nDSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio)            0.69            1.78            3.64            1.26            1.43            1.74            2.34\nDebt to Total Assets            0.87            0.90            0.87            0.86            0.81            0.74            0.63\nWorking Ratio 1% 7% 5% 5% 15% 4% 3% \n \nDSCR = debt service coverage ratio, O&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: Vietnam Expressway Corporation and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \n8.  A minimum debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.2 is proposed to ensure VEC\u2019s debt \nservice capacity and efficient operation. The DSCR will remain within the limit during almost the \nentire forecast period, but could undercut the limit in 2010 and 2011 of initial operation period. It \nis proposed that VEC submits for ADB\u2019s review and comment the proposed toll structure and \nlevels\u2014which should satisfy the minimum DSCR of 1.2 times\u2014within 6 months of the project \nhighway's opening.  \n \n \n ", "60  Appendix 14 \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT AND ETHNIC MINORITY DEVELOPMENT PLAN \n \n1.  Vietnam  Expressway  Corporation  (VEC)  has  prepared  a  resettlement  and  ethnic \nminority development plan (REMDP) for the whole project based on the socioeconomic and \ninventory of losses surveys. This Appendix provides a summary of the REMDP. VEC must \nundertake  detailed  measurement  surveys  after  the  detailed  highway  design  has  been \ncompleted,  and  submit  district-level  updated  REMDPs  to  ADB  for  approval  before  land \nacquisition and resettlement starts. \n \nA.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n \n2.  The proposed Project generally involves the construction of the first phase of a new \nhighway of approximately 244 km, to be open to public traffic by 2012. The highway will start \nnear the Noi Bai International Airport in the District of Soc Son, Hanoi City, and will traverse the \nprovinces of Vinh Phuc, Phu Tho, Yen Bai, and Lao Cai, terminating at Lao Cai on the PRC \nborder. The highway will traverse 72 communes in 18 districts. The scope of the Project, as the \nfirst phase of the ultimate highway configuration, includes the construction of four lanes (i.e., two \nlanes each way) from Noi Bai to Yen Bai and two lanes (i.e., one lane each way) from Yen Bai \nto Lao Cai. The second phase will complete an additional two lanes for the entire length of the \nhighway, meaning the Noi Bai\u2013Viet Tri section will ultimately have six lanes and the Yen Bai\u2013\nLao Cai section will ultimately have four lanes. Based on projections for Viet Nam's economic \ngrowth and for traffic that will use the highway, this expansion will be required not later than 10\u2013\n12 years from now\u2014that is, within 5\u20137 years of the opening of the highway's first phase to traffic. \nTo reduce overall resettlement impacts for the highway's ultimate configuration, the right-of-way \nfor the ultimate configuration\u2014typically 50 meters wide\u2014is to be acquired now. The rapid \neconomic development induced by the highway will change land use along its length. This \napproach will ensure that the rapid economic development will not encroach on land required for \nthe highway's ultimate configuration. It will also ensure that land acquisition and resettlement \nimpacts are planned and implemented in accordance with ADB\u2019s social safeguards policies for \nthe ultimate configuration, not just for the first phase. \n \n3.  The census of affected persons and inventory of losses carried out between April and \nJune 2007 has estimated that about 2,000 hectare (ha) will be acquired. Productive land, such \nas rice paddies, fish ponds, vegetable gardens, orchards, and woodland, accounts for 89% \n(1,800 ha) of all affected land. A total of 3,998 households will lose more than 10% of their \nproductive land, and the majority of these will lose all of their productive land. Nonproductive \nland, such as residential, nonagricultural, and \u201cother land\u201d (e.g. waterways, footpaths, and \ngraveyards), accounts for 11%, or about 200 ha. Houses and shops (or kiosks), which will be \ntotally affected and will require relocation, account for 1,844 and 11, respectively. Of these, \naround two thirds (1,202 or 65%) will have to acquire new land as the residual land will no \nlonger be viable to support rebuilt houses. The remaining 642 households (35%) will be able to \nreconstruct their houses on what remains of their land plots. Secondary structures such as \nkitchens, toilets, porches, and fences were identified. In addition, trees of commercial value will \nalso be affected (about 175,000 fruit-bearing trees and 32,000 timber trees) by the Project. The \nProject will also affect public facilities such as electric posts, telephone wires, and communal-\nowned irrigation systems.   \n \n4.  It  is  estimated  that  5,458  households  (approximately  26,118  persons  based  on  an \naverage household size of 4.8) will be adversely affected by loss of assets and sources of \nlivelihood. Of these, 97% hold land use rights certificates, are in the process of obtaining land \n                     ", "Appendix 14  61 \nuse rights certificates, or can claim customary rights over their properties; the rest (148 affected \nhouseholds, or 3%) hold lease agreements with the Government.   \n \nB.  Legal and Policy Framework  \n \n5.  The project resettlement policy and entitlements have been developed from the laws of \nthe Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, principally the Constitution (1992) that \nconfirms the right of citizens to own and protect the ownership of a house; Land Law No. \n13/2003/QH11, providing Viet Nam with a comprehensive land administration law; Decree No. \n197/2004/ND-CP,  on  compensation,  rehabilitation  and  resettlement  in  the  event  of  land \nrecovery by the State, as amended by Decree No. 17/2006/ND-CP; Decree No. 188/2004/ND-\nCP, specifying the methods for land pricing and land price frameworks in the event of land \nrecovery by the State; and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) guided by Operations \nManual on Involuntary Resettlement (2006). Provisions and principles adopted in this Project \nwill supplement the provisions of relevant decrees currently in force in Viet Nam wherever a gap \nexists, consistent with Decree No. 131/2006/ND-CP, which provides that in case of \u201cdiscrepancy \nbetween any provision in an international treaty on Official Development Assistance (ODA), to \nwhich the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam is a signatory, and the Vietnamese Law, the provision \nin the international treaty on ODA shall take precedence\u201d (Article 2, Item 5).  \n \nC.  Project Entitlements \n \n6.  One of key policy objectives of the Project is to replace and compensate lost assets. All \ncompensation is based on the principle of replacement cost. Compensation and provision of \nassistance  will  be  provided  and  income  restoration  programs  will  be  put  in  place  prior  to \ndisplacement of affected households from their houses, land, and assets, such that they will be \nat least as well off as they would have been in the absence of the Project, and the poorest \naffected households and vulnerable groups, including affected persons from ethnic minorities, \nare assisted to help improve their socioeconomic status. The project entitlements are shown in \nTable A14.1 below. \n \n7.  The type and number of affected persons and the entitlements will be added to the \nupdated  REMDP,  as  needed,  to  cover  other  eligible  persons  (for  example,  tenants  losing \ngovernment or private housing, non-titled users on government land, registered establishments \nthat will be required to relocate) and impacts identified during the detailed measurement survey. \nThey will be eligible for compensation and assistance provided that they meet the established \ncutoff date.  \n \nD.  Ethnicity, Vulnerability, and Gender Issues \n \n8.  The  census  has  identified  136  households  (2.44%  of  the  total  number  of  affected \nhouseholds) belonging to six ethnic minority groups that will be affected by the Project\u2014namely, \nthe  Tay,  Dao,  Giay,  Thai,  Muong,  and  Mong.  Likewise,  the  census  has  identified  1,083 \nhouseholds (19.84%) headed by women, 83 households (1.52%) headed by disabled persons \n(all males), 1,210 households (22.17%) living below the officially set poverty threshold, and \n1,586  households  (29.06%)  headed  by  persons  within  the  retirement  age  bracket  of  the \nGovernment (i.e., 55 or older for women, and 60 or older for men). Particular attention has been \ngiven to the specific needs and concerns of ethnic minorities and other vulnerable groups such \nas the landless, poor, and households headed by women, disabled, elderly, or children without \nmeans of support. Ethnic minority and gender strategies are included in the REMDP. Such \nstrategies include active participation of women and ethnic minorities from the consultation \n ", "62  Appendix 14 \nstage to the monitoring stage; representation of women and ethnic minorities in resettlement \ncommittees;  and  capacity-building  targeting  women  and  ethnic  minorities.  To  ensure  the \neffective implementation of the ethnic minority development plan and gender strategies, the \nproject supervision consultant (PSC) will employ specialists in social development, gender, and \nethnic minority issues. Monitoring indicators broken down by gender and ethnic minority will be \ndeveloped, and the external monitoring agency will include a female staff member. \n \nTable A14.1: Entitlement Matrix \n \nImpacts  Entitlements \nPermanent  acquisition of land   For legal land owners, owners of land to be legalized, and those covered by \ncustomary rights, replacement land or cash compensation at replacement cost (i.e., \ncurrent market value, productive value, and similar location attributes).

Participation and Grievance Redress \n \n9.  Consultations, public meetings, and village discussions with affected households and \nlocal officials were carried out during the resettlement planning process. These activities will \ncontinue  during  updating  and  implementation  and  will  follow  the  Project\u2019s  participatory \napproach. A grievance mechanism has been designed to ensure that affected households\u2019 \nconcerns and grievances are addressed and resolved in a timely and satisfactory manner.  \nAffected households will be made fully aware of their rights verbally and in writing during \nconsultation, survey, and at the time of compensation. \n \nF.  Income Restoration and Relocation Strategies \n \n10.  The  inventory  of  losses  has  identified  3,998  affected  households  that  stand  to  be \nseverely affected by the loss of 10% or more of their productive assets, most of which are land-\nbased (i.e., rice paddies, gardens for growing vegetables and perennials, fish or shrimp ponds, \nor woodlands).  Wherever feasible, VEC will allow the cultivation of annual crops (e.g., rice and \nlow-lying crops) on land inside the right-of-way that is not required during the first phase of the \nhighway  project.  This  will  be  carried  out  as  a  collective  endeavor  of  severely  affected \nhouseholds  in  a  particular  village  or  commune  under  the  close  supervision  of  the  local \nauthorities, VEC, and the consultants, in line with the Project's income restoration program. The \ntemporary permit to utilize said land is given on the condition, and with clear understanding by \nall concerned, that in the event that such land is required for improving or carrying out the \nsecond phase of the highway project, the possession of the same will be relinquished to VEC at \nno cost to the government.   \n \n11.  During the TA loan stage, a local organization that has a track record in community-\nbased socioeconomic work will be contracted to design, pilot, and commence implementation of \na responsive income restoration program in each commune with the full participation of the \naffected  households  and  local  authorities,  especially  the  compensation,  assistance,  and \nresettlement boards (CARBs) in the project provinces and in the project districts.1 The progress \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nof the income restoration program will be monitored regularly and will be evaluated every 6 \nmonths to ensure attainment of objectives. Modifications in the program and additional cash and \nmaterial assistance to the participating affected households will be provided as and when \nnecessary.  Subject  to  satisfactory  performance,  the  PSC  can  subcontract  the  same  local \norganization to continue to implement the income restoration program until its completion in \n2010. \n \n12.  The income restoration organization will also carry out a detailed assessment of present \nskills vis-\u00e0-vis the labor requirements in industrial zones and in neighboring places that have \nfactories in line with the design and implementation of training programs and/or vocational \ncourses. Additionally, short-term employment at the worksite (as laborers) or in the offices of the \ncivil works contractor and supervision consultants will be made available to members of the \naffected households, especially the severely affected, as practicable. \n \n13.  Of the 1,844 affected households who stand to lose entire houses and therefore must \nrelocate, 1,169 households will have to acquire new land on which to rebuild their homes. Initial \nmeetings with the local authorities show the availability or nonavailability of replacement land \nper commune. During REMDP updating, the final location of sites (individual or small group \nrelocation  sites)  will  be  determined  in  close  coordination  with  the  local  authorities  and  in \n                                                 \n1 Provincial Resettlement Steering Committee functions as Provincial CARB.  \n ", "64  Appendix 14 \nconsultation  with  affected  households  to  ensure  that  the  social  and  economic  implications \ncaused by relocation will be avoided or at least minimized. Affected households will not be \ndisplaced until a suitable relocation site is provided to them.    \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  VEC will have overall responsibility for all land acquisition and resettlement activities.  \nThe technical department of the VEC will create a social and resettlement unit (SRU) to provide \noverall  guidance  and  coordinate  closely  with  MOT  and  local  authorities.  The  SRU  will  be \nheaded by a senior social development and resettlement officer and six social development and \nresettlement staff members. For this Project, four staff members of the SRU will be full-time \nmembers of the project management team (PMT) and will be assigned on a full-time basis to \neach project field office. The four SRU staff members will represent the PMT in the provincial \nCARBs and will act as conduit between MOT, the local governments, VEC, and the project \nconsultants. \n \n15.  The provincial and district CARBs, under the guidance of VEC, will carry out updating \nand implementation of resettlement within their administrative jurisdictions in accordance with \nthe approved and updated REMDP. Each CARB will be headed by the vice chairman of the \nprovincial  or  district  people\u2019s  committee  and  will  include  members  from  departments \nconcerned\u2014including the departments of finance, national resource and environment, transport, \nand agriculture\u2014and representatives from local organizations and project affected persons. \n \n16.  The consultants engaged under the TA loan will continue to assist the SRU staff and the \nCARBs during REMDP updating and implementation to ensure social safeguards compliance. \nThese consultants will continue to provide training and capacity-building interventions on a full-\ntime  basis.  The  social  development  and  resettlement  team  will  be  composed  of:  one \ninternational  resettlement  specialist;  one  international  social  development  specialist;  one \nnational resettlement specialist; one national ethnic minority specialist; one national gender \nspecialist; a national training program expert; and five provincial coordinators and assistants. In \naddition,  the  consultants  under  the  TA  loan will  subcontract  a qualified  local  development \norganization to design and implement income restoration programs. \n \nH.  Monitoring, REMDP Budget and Implementation Schedule \n \n17.  The  contract  of  the  consultants  engaged  under  the  TA  loan  will  be  completed  in \nSeptember 2008; hence, implementation of updated REMDPs, including income restoration \nprograms, will be handed over to the PSC. At least 1 month prior to demobilization of the \nconsultants engaged under the TA loan, the PSC will mobilize a similar social development and \nresettlement team with the same tasks to ensure continuous assistance to the PMT and CARBs \nduring  implementation  of  the  updated  REMDPs,  and  to  act  on  issues  and  unforeseen \nresettlement impacts. Subject to satisfactory performance, the PSC can subcontract the same \nlocal  organization  engaged  by  the  consultants  under  the  TA  loan  to  continue  with  the \nimplementation of income restoration programs. \n \n18.  VEC will have overall responsibility for internal monitoring of resettlement activities. \nProgress reports will be submitted to ADB on a quarterly basis. An external monitoring agency \nwill be mobilized 1 month following the start of updating of the district-level REMDPs. The \nexternal monitoring agency will be required to submit an inception report 1 month following its \nmobilization and quarterly reports on the progress of updating of the district-level REMDPs  and \nimplementation,  and  make  recommendations  regarding  the  issues  identified.  The  external \n                     ", "Appendix 14  65 \nmonitoring agency will likewise conduct a post-resettlement implementation evaluation study 6\u2013\n12 months following completion of resettlement activities. \n \n19.  The total cost for resettlement is estimated at $100 million. This includes compensation \nand  allowances,  development  of  replacement  plots  for  relocating  households,  design  and \nimplementation of livelihood programs, operational and administration expenses, and internal \nand external monitoring. Additionally, $15 million contingency for resettlement cost is included in \nthe total project cost. VEC will ensure the timely provision of counterpart funds for resettlement \nto meet any unforeseen obligations in excess of the resettlement budget estimates.  \n \n20.  Following detailed highway design, REMDP updating will be carried out by the district \npeople\u2019s committees (DPCs) in the project area. As soon as an updated REMDP is completed \nby a DPC, VEC will submit it to ADB for review and approval. All resettlement activities will be \ncoordinated  with  the  civil  works  schedule.  Land  acquisition  and  relocation  of  affected \nhouseholds in a given district can commence only once ADB has reviewed and approved the \nupdated REMDP for that district. Each civil works contract package covers highway construction \nin more than one district. VEC will issue a notice to proceed to the civil works contractors for the \nparticular highway section in a district where (i) compensation payment and relocation to new \nsites have been satisfactorily completed, (ii) rehabilitation assistance is in place, and (iii) the \nparticular length required for civil works is free of all encumbrances. The contractors do not \nneed to delay commencement of the civil works until the land acquisition and resettlement \nactivities have been completed for the entire sections covered by their contracts. \n \n21.
