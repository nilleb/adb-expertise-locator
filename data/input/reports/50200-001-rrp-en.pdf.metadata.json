Acute  energy  deficit  has  been  one  of  the  major  constraints  to \nPakistan\u2019s economic growth. To ensure a sustainable energy supply, the Government of Pakistan \nhas  launched  some  initiatives  to  promote  private  sector  participation  in  the  country\u2019s \ninfrastructure. As part of these efforts, several energy policies were introduced and have resulted \nin significant investment from the private sector. As of FY2015, private sector investments owned \nand operated 11,574 megawatts (MW), or 46.2% of the country\u2019s installed power capacity.2 TBCC \nis a special purpose vehicle set up to develop, construct, commission, and operate three adjacent \n49.7  MW  wind  power  plants  in  southern  Sindh  Province;  once  commissioned,  the  149.2  MW \nfacility will be the county\u2019s largest wind farm to date. The sponsors, Sapphire Textile Mills Limited \n(STML) and Bank Alfalah Limited (BAFL), have a right to possession of almost 3,800 acres for \nthe project, which has been leased on a long-term basis to TBCC by the Government of Sindh. \nThe project will be developed under the Renewable Energy Power Policy of 2006, under which \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has already financed three wind power independent power \nproducers  (IPPs),  and  will  benefit  from  the  20-year  upfront  wind  feed-in-tariff  (FiT)  set  by  the \nNational Electric Power and Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), Pakistan\u2019s power sector regulator. \n \n3. \nSTML  and  BAFL  formed  a  partnership  in  2012  to  jointly  develop  renewable  energy \nprojects in Pakistan. The first project of STML and BAFL was a 52.8 MW wind farm in Jhimpir \nSindh, Sapphire Wind Power Company Limited (SWPCL) that achieved commercial operations \nin 2015.3 After  successfully  completing  the  project  and leveraging  the  experience gained in  its \ndevelopment, STML and BAFL decided to develop a pipeline of future renewable (wind and solar) \nenergy projects in Pakistan and, as a part of that strategy, acquired TBCC to develop a 150 MW \nwind  farm  in the  same vicinity  as SWPCL.  STML  and BAFL  approached  ADB  in late  2015 for \nfinancing given (i) ADB\u2019s record of supporting the country\u2019s first three wind-based IPPs\u2014Zorlu \nEnerji  Power  Project  and Foundation  Energy  I  and  II  Projects;4 (ii)  the  large  long-tenor  project \ndebt  requirement;  (iii)  earlier  discussions  between  ADB  and  STML  and  BAFL  in  which  ADB \nindicated it was interested in supporting renewable energy projects and/or initiatives in Pakistan; \nand  (iv) the  project\u2019s  need  for  foreign  financing,  given  that  the  majority  of  costs  will  be  dollar-\ndenominated. \n \nProject  design.  The  project  comprises  the  design,  construction,  and  operation  and \n4. \nmaintenance (O&M) of three 50 MW wind power plants (and associated infrastructure) adjacent \nto  each  other  in  Jhimpir,  about  100  kilometers  (km)  northeast  of  Karachi  in  Sindh  Province.  \n(Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy) \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  National Electric Power Regulatory Authority. 2016.

TBCC is a \nspecial  purpose  vehicle  that  has  the  right  to  develop  three  wind  power  plants  of  50  MW  each \n(collectively the project). TBCC is owned by (i) the Sapphire Group, a leading local conglomerate \nwith experience in thermal and renewable power project development, including a successfully \ncommissioned wind farm in the same wind corridor as the project; and (ii) BAFL, Pakistan\u2019s sixth \nlargest  bank.  ADB  conducted  integrity  due  diligence  following  its  Integrity  Due  Diligence \nGuidelines  for  Nonsovereign  Operations.5 No  significant  or  potentially  significant  integrity  risks \nwere found. \n \n6. \n(Confidential  information  redacted  under  para.  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications \nPolicy).  Founded  in  1940,  the  Sapphire  Group\u2014a  network  of  family  owned  and  managed \ncompanies\u2014is one of Pakistan\u2019s largest conglomerates, with investments in textiles, power, dairy, \nand real estate development. (Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public \nCommunications Policy). \n \nSapphire Fibres Limited was incorporated in 1979 and is publicly listed. It is a vertically \n7. \nintegrated textile unit manufacturing cotton yarn, fabrics, and garments.

(Confidential  information \nredacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy). It has a 6.5% market share \n(based on total deposits) and holds a notable position among the domestic private banks. BAFL \nhas presence in Afghanistan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, and the United Arab Emirates and is listed \non  the  Pakistan  Stock  Exchange.  In  December  2014,  the  International  Finance  Corporation \nacquired a 15% shareholding in BAFL to allow BAFL to focus more on small- and medium-sized \nenterprises, agricultural industries, and sustainable energy financing. \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n9. \nImpacts. The impacts will be (i) ensured access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and \nmodern energy for all, set by the Sustainable Development Goals; (ii) improved power supply in \nPakistan, and (iii) improved power generation mix through investment by the private sector. The \nproject  will  help  alleviate  Pakistan\u2019s  severe  power  shortages,  which  hamper  the  country\u2019s \neconomic growth and efforts to reduce poverty. The project\u2019s successful implementation will also \nfoster confidence among investors and lenders, and promote further private sector investment in \nrenewable energy and power. \n \n10. \nOutcome.  The  outcome  will  be  an  increased  supply  of  renewable  energy  from  wind \nsources. The project will generate an additional 520 gigawatt-hours of electricity annually by using \nwind, and the tariff for project-supplied electricity will be lower than that for plants using imported \nfuel  and  other  renewable  energy  sources  such  as  wind  and  solar.  The  project  will  also  avoid \ngreenhouse  gas  emissions  of  about  380,000  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  equivalent  per  year.  The \nproject will contribute to the local economy by creating 35 full-time jobs during operations. \n \n11.   Outputs. The output will be the net additional installed power generation capacity of 150 \nMW, which is equivalent to about 3% of the country\u2019s power shortfall. The project will contribute \n\n                                                \n5  ADB. 2015 Integrity Due Diligence Guidelines for Nonsovereign Operations.

The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  for  inclusive  economic  growth,  environmentally \nsustainable growth, private sector development and operations, environment and climate change \nadaptation and mitigation, and infrastructure development.6 ADB\u2019s support for the project is in line \nwith  its  Pakistan  country  partnership  strategy,  2015\u20132019,  which  emphasizes  energy  sector \ndevelopment, private sector participation in infrastructure development, and ADB\u2019s private sector \noperations\u2019  expansion  in  the  energy  sector. 7  The  project  is  a  logical  outcome  of  ADB\u2019s \ndevelopment  and  reform  efforts  in  Pakistan\u2019s  energy  sector,  which  have  promoted  a  well-\nregulated, market-oriented power industry, particularly as the country faces challenges attracting \ncommercial  financing.  Energy  infrastructure  has  featured  prominently  in  ADB\u2019s  private  sector \noperations in Pakistan. \n \n13. \nConsistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project is in line \nwith ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, particularly with one of its three pillars\u2014maximizing access to energy \nfor  all.8 The  project  will  add  power-generation  capacity  and increase  the reliability  of  electricity \nsupplies in a country facing a severe power shortage. The electricity tariff for the project will not \nbe susceptible to volatility of international fuel market prices, which severely impact much of the \ncountry\u2019s  thermal  power-generation  capacity.  The  project  will  promote  use  of  indigenous  and \nrenewable resources,  and will  contribute to  the  country\u2019s  energy  security. The project  will  also \nhelp ADB meet its annual commitment to invest at least $3 billion in clean energy, and at least $6 \nbillion in climate change adaptation and mitigation. \n \n14. \nLessons  from  previous  operations.  ADB  has  taken  the  lead  in  supporting  the \ngovernment\u2019s initiatives to attract private capital into the renewable energy sector and has been \ninstrumental  in  pioneering  many  transactions,  given  local  and  international  banks\u2019  long-term \nlending constraints and reluctance to finance renewable energy initiatives. ADB led the structuring \nand financing of the country\u2019s first three private wind power projects: Zorlu Enerji (56.4 MW) and \nFoundation  Wind  Energy  I  (50  MW)  and  II  (50 MW)  (footnote  4). ADB\u2019s  participation  in  these \nprojects  not  only  provided  the  much-required  long-term  debt  (crucial  for  infrastructure \ndevelopment), but was also a catalyst to raise the needed equity and debt cofinancing. It also \nconfirmed that investment in the wind sector is feasible and needed to ensure the country\u2019s long-\nterm  energy  security.  The  project  fully  complements  ADB  sovereign  operation\u2019s  support  for \nenergy sector reforms that target fuel mix diversification in the power sector through renewable \nenergy resources.9 \n \nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $360 million to be financed by debt and equity.  \n\n15. \n \n(Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy). \n \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2014.

ADB\u2019s presence reassures STML \nand BAFL that government entities will continue to provide support throughout the project\u2019s lives. \nSTML and BAFL have been engaged with ADB since 2010 as they value ADB\u2019s pioneering role \nand subsequent sector and development knowledge in structuring and developing Pakistan\u2019s first \nthree internationally financed wind projects. (Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) \nof ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy).  ADB\u2019s support will foster confidence among investors \nand government entities that efficiencies in renewable energy can be realized and that wind power \ncan successfully achieve grid parity in line with the government\u2019s stated objective of reducing the \nsystem wide generation costs from $0.12 to 0.10/kWh by 2017.10 \n \nC. \n\nRisks  \n\n(Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy). \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \n18. \ncategory B for environment and C both for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The \nproject\u2019s potential environmental and social impacts have been identified, and effective measures \nto  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and  compensate  for  the  adverse  impacts  are  incorporated  in  the \nsafeguard  reports  and  plans.  The  project  is  located  in  an  arid  area  with  sparse  vegetation. \nConstruction-related activities are expected to have short-term impacts, with increased airborne \ndust and noise levels. Occupational health and safety risks such as exposure to excessive noise, \nvibration, work at heights, and risk of falling objects are also anticipated. Mitigation procedures \nfor  these  are  incorporated  in  an  environmental,  health,  and  safety  manual.  Based  on  initial \nfindings, potential noise and shadow flicker impacts during operations are expected to be within \nacceptable  limits,  but  this  will  be  verified  once  project\u2019s  layout  is  finalized.  The  project  is  not \nexpected to adversely affect the avian population, as the site is located more than 20 km from \nKeenjhar Lake, the nearest Ramsar Site wetland. Community safety risks will be minimal since \n\n                                                \n10 Government of Pakistan. 2013. National Power Policy 2013. Islamabad. \n\n\f \n\n \n5 \n\nthe  bases  of  the  wind  turbine  generators  will  be  fenced  and  guarded  to  prevent  unauthorized \nentry.  \n \n19. \nThe cumulative impact assessment shows that the project conforms to the area\u2019s visual \ncharacter  since  the  government  allocated  the  wind  corridor  to  wind  farm  development. \nEnvironmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  implementation  during  construction  and \noperation  will  minimize  or  mitigate  these  impacts.  Initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs), \nincluding an environmental management and monitoring plan compliant to national requirements, \nhave been prepared, with approvals given by the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency. The \nIEEs will be updated to comply with the Safeguard Policy Statement, and an updated, integrated \nIEE will be disclosed on ADB website upon approval by the ADB Board of Directors. NTDC will \nconduct a detailed IEE for a 7 km transmission line. Initial findings indicate limited impacts since \nthe transmission line will pass through mostly barren lands with sparse vegetation and avifauna. \nAn environmental management plan will also be developed to mitigate mostly construction-related \nimpacts.  TBCC  will  submit  periodic  monitoring  reports  to  ADB.  Information  disclosure  and \nconsultations with affected people and land users were conducted following ADB requirements. \nTBCC  will  establish  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  to  handle  project  grievances.  TBCC\u2019s \ninstitutional capacity and commitment to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts \nare deemed adequate. \n \nAll wind farm components (Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s \n20. \nPublic Communications Policy), will be located within the leased area, which is uninhabited and \nagriculturally unproductive. A portion of the proposed wind farm has been used for opportunistic \ngrazing  when  intermittent  rain  has  produced  edible  foliage.  The  project  will  not  affect  these \noccasional herders as other grazing grounds are available, and the site will remain accessible to \nthem  within  health  and  safety  limits.  NTDC  will  construct  the  7  km  transmission  line  on \ngovernment  land,  and  the line  will  not  impact  any  individual  or  household.  The  project  will  not \nimpact any indigenous peoples. \n \n21. \nOther social dimensions. The project is categorized as having no gender element given \nits limited potential for gender-inclusive design. The project has no gender-specific employment \ntarget  since  it  is  not  common  in  Pakistan  for  women  to  work  in  construction.  TBCC,  however, \nadheres to the principle that there will be no discrimination in recruiting project workers. During \nthe peak construction period, the EPC contractor and its subcontractors will engage about 300 \nworkers. During operations, the number of workers will be reduced to about 35 persons. TBCC \nwill  ensure  that  its  contractors  and  their  subcontractors  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and, \npursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy, will take measures to comply with internationally \nrecognized core labor standards.11 The borrower will be required to report regularly to ADB on (i) \nits compliance with such laws, and (ii) the measures taken to comply with such laws. TBCC will \nconduct  continuous  engagement  with  the  community  and  consultation  with  affected  people \nfollowing ADB requirements. \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nTBCC, STML, and BAFL were advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international \n22. \npractice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism.
