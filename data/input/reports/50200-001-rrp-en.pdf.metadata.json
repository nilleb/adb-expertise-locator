THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $75 million to the Triconboston Consulting Corporation (Private) Limited (TBCC) for the \nTriconboston Wind Power Project in Pakistan.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n2.  Project identification. Acute energy deficit has been one of the major constraints to \nPakistan\u2019s economic growth. To ensure a sustainable energy supply, the Government of Pakistan \nhas  launched  some  initiatives  to  promote  private  sector  participation  in  the  country\u2019s \ninfrastructure. As part of these efforts, several energy policies were introduced and have resulted \nin significant investment from the private sector. As of FY2015, private sector investments owned \nand operated 11,574 megawatts (MW), or 46.2% of the country\u2019s installed power capacity.2 TBCC \nis a special purpose vehicle set up to develop, construct, commission, and operate three adjacent \n49.7 MW wind power plants in southern Sindh Province; once commissioned, the 149.2 MW \nfacility will be the county\u2019s largest wind farm to date. The sponsors, Sapphire Textile Mills Limited \n(STML) and Bank Alfalah Limited (BAFL), have a right to possession of almost 3,800 acres for \nthe project, which has been leased on a long-term basis to TBCC by the Government of Sindh. \nThe project will be developed under the Renewable Energy Power Policy of 2006, under which \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has already financed three wind power independent power \nproducers (IPPs), and will benefit from the 20-year upfront wind feed-in-tariff (FiT) set by the \nNational Electric Power and Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), Pakistan\u2019s power sector regulator. \n \n3.  STML and BAFL formed a partnership in 2012 to jointly develop renewable energy \nprojects in Pakistan. The first project of STML and BAFL was a 52.8 MW wind farm in Jhimpir \nSindh, Sapphire Wind Power Company Limited (SWPCL) that achieved commercial operations \nin 2015.3 After successfully completing the project and leveraging the experience gained in its \ndevelopment, STML and BAFL decided to develop a pipeline of future renewable (wind and solar) \nenergy projects in Pakistan and, as a part of that strategy, acquired TBCC to develop a 150 MW \nwind farm in the same vicinity as SWPCL. STML and BAFL approached ADB in late 2015 for \nfinancing given (i) ADB\u2019s record of supporting the country\u2019s first three wind-based IPPs\u2014Zorlu \nEnerji Power Project and Foundation Energy I and II Projects;4 (ii) the large long-tenor project \ndebt requirement; (iii) earlier discussions between ADB and STML and BAFL in which ADB \nindicated it was interested in supporting renewable energy projects and/or initiatives in Pakistan; \nand (iv) the project\u2019s need for foreign financing, given that the majority of costs will be dollar-\ndenominated. \n \n4.  Project design. The project comprises the design, construction, and operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) of three 50 MW wind power plants (and associated infrastructure) adjacent \nto each other in Jhimpir, about 100 kilometers (km) northeast of Karachi in Sindh Province.  \n(Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy) \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  National Electric Power Regulatory Authority. 2016.

The borrower, Sapphire Textile Mills Limited and Bank Alfalah Limited. TBCC is a \nspecial purpose vehicle that has the right to develop three wind power plants of 50 MW each \n(collectively the project). TBCC is owned by (i) the Sapphire Group, a leading local conglomerate \nwith experience in thermal and renewable power project development, including a successfully \ncommissioned wind farm in the same wind corridor as the project; and (ii) BAFL, Pakistan\u2019s sixth \nlargest  bank.  ADB  conducted  integrity  due  diligence  following  its  Integrity  Due  Diligence \nGuidelines for Nonsovereign Operations.5 No significant or potentially significant integrity risks \nwere found. \n \n6.  (Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications \nPolicy).  Founded  in  1940, the  Sapphire Group\u2014a  network  of family  owned  and managed \ncompanies\u2014is one of Pakistan\u2019s largest conglomerates, with investments in textiles, power, dairy, \nand real estate development.

It has a 6.5% market share \n(based on total deposits) and holds a notable position among the domestic private banks. BAFL \nhas presence in Afghanistan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, and the United Arab Emirates and is listed \non the Pakistan Stock Exchange. In December 2014, the International Finance Corporation \nacquired a 15% shareholding in BAFL to allow BAFL to focus more on small- and medium-sized \nenterprises, agricultural industries, and sustainable energy financing. \n \nB.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n9.  Impacts. The impacts will be (i) ensured access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and \nmodern energy for all, set by the Sustainable Development Goals; (ii) improved power supply in \nPakistan, and (iii) improved power generation mix through investment by the private sector. The \nproject  will  help  alleviate  Pakistan\u2019s  severe  power  shortages,  which  hamper  the  country\u2019s \neconomic growth and efforts to reduce poverty. The project\u2019s successful implementation will also \nfoster confidence among investors and lenders, and promote further private sector investment in \nrenewable energy and power. \n \n10.  Outcome. The outcome will be an increased supply of renewable energy from wind \nsources. The project will generate an additional 520 gigawatt-hours of electricity annually by using \nwind, and the tariff for project-supplied electricity will be lower than that for plants using imported \nfuel and other renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. The project will also avoid \ngreenhouse gas emissions of about 380,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. The \nproject will contribute to the local economy by creating 35 full-time jobs during operations. \n \n11.   Outputs. The output will be the net additional installed power generation capacity of 150 \nMW, which is equivalent to about 3% of the country\u2019s power shortfall. The project will contribute \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2015 Integrity Due Diligence Guidelines for Nonsovereign Operations. Manila. ", "   3 \nto the local economy by purchasing $31 million in local goods and services and creating 300 jobs \nduring construction. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n12.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  for  inclusive  economic  growth,  environmentally \nsustainable growth, private sector development and operations, environment and climate change \nadaptation and mitigation, and infrastructure development.6 ADB\u2019s support for the project is in line \nwith its Pakistan country partnership strategy, 2015\u20132019, which emphasizes energy sector \ndevelopment, private sector participation in infrastructure development, and ADB\u2019s private sector \noperations\u2019  expansion  in  the  energy  sector.7 The  project  is  a  logical  outcome  of  ADB\u2019s \ndevelopment and reform efforts in Pakistan\u2019s energy sector, which have  promoted a well-\nregulated, market-oriented power industry, particularly as the country faces challenges attracting \ncommercial financing. Energy infrastructure has featured prominently in ADB\u2019s private sector \noperations in Pakistan. \n \n13.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project is in line \nwith ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, particularly with one of its three pillars\u2014maximizing access to energy \nfor all.8 The project will add power-generation capacity and increase the reliability of electricity \nsupplies in a country facing a severe power shortage. The electricity tariff for the project will not \nbe susceptible to volatility of international fuel market prices, which severely impact much of the \ncountry\u2019s thermal power-generation capacity. The project will promote use of indigenous and \nrenewable resources, and will contribute to the country\u2019s energy security. The project will also \nhelp ADB meet its annual commitment to invest at least $3 billion in clean energy, and at least $6 \nbillion in climate change adaptation and mitigation. \n \n14.  Lessons  from  previous  operations.  ADB  has  taken  the  lead  in  supporting  the \ngovernment\u2019s initiatives to attract private capital into the renewable energy sector and has been \ninstrumental in pioneering many transactions, given local and international banks\u2019 long-term \nlending constraints and reluctance to finance renewable energy initiatives. ADB led the structuring \nand financing of the country\u2019s first three private wind power projects: Zorlu Enerji (56.4 MW) and \nFoundation Wind Energy I (50 MW) and II (50 MW) (footnote 4). ADB\u2019s participation in these \nprojects  not  only  provided  the  much-required  long-term  debt  (crucial  for  infrastructure \ndevelopment), but was also a catalyst to raise the needed equity and debt cofinancing. It also \nconfirmed that investment in the wind sector is feasible and needed to ensure the country\u2019s long-\nterm energy security. The project fully complements ADB sovereign operation\u2019s support for \nenergy sector reforms that target fuel mix diversification in the power sector through renewable \nenergy resources.9 \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n15.  The project is estimated to cost $360 million to be financed by debt and equity.  \n \n(Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy). \n \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2014.

Projected Financial and Economic Performance \n(Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy). \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n16.  ADB\u2019s proposed assistance comprises a direct loan of up to $75 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources. \n   \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n17.  ADB\u2019s funding is needed for this critical energy security asset, as long-term limited \nrecourse dollar financing is not readily available in Pakistan\u2019s market; international commercial \nbanks are not active, and most have left the market altogether. ADB\u2019s presence reassures STML \nand BAFL that government entities will continue to provide support throughout the project\u2019s lives. \nSTML and BAFL have been engaged with ADB since 2010 as they value ADB\u2019s pioneering role \nand subsequent sector and development knowledge in structuring and developing Pakistan\u2019s first \nthree internationally financed wind projects. (Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) \nof ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy).  ADB\u2019s support will foster confidence among investors \nand government entities that efficiencies in renewable energy can be realized and that wind power \ncan successfully achieve grid parity in line with the government\u2019s stated objective of reducing the \nsystem wide generation costs from $0.12 to 0.10/kWh by 2017.10 \n \nC.  Risks  \n(Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy). \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n18.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory B for environment and C both for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The \nproject\u2019s potential environmental and social impacts have been identified, and effective measures \nto avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts are incorporated in the \nsafeguard reports and plans. The project is located in an arid area with sparse vegetation. \nConstruction-related activities are expected to have short-term impacts, with increased airborne \ndust and noise levels. Occupational health and safety risks such as exposure to excessive noise, \nvibration, work at heights, and risk of falling objects are also anticipated. Mitigation procedures \nfor these are incorporated in an environmental, health, and safety manual. Based on initial \nfindings, potential noise and shadow flicker impacts during operations are expected to be within \nacceptable limits, but this will be verified once project\u2019s layout is finalized. The project is not \nexpected to adversely affect the avian population, as the site is located more than 20 km from \nKeenjhar Lake, the nearest Ramsar Site wetland. Community safety risks will be minimal since \n                                                \n10 Government of Pakistan. 2013. National Power Policy 2013. Islamabad. ", "   5 \nthe bases of the wind turbine generators will be fenced and guarded to prevent unauthorized \nentry.  \n \n19.  The cumulative impact assessment shows that the project conforms to the area\u2019s visual \ncharacter  since  the  government  allocated  the  wind  corridor  to  wind  farm  development. \nEnvironmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  implementation  during  construction  and \noperation will minimize or mitigate these impacts. Initial environmental examinations (IEEs), \nincluding an environmental management and monitoring plan compliant to national requirements, \nhave been prepared, with approvals given by the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency. The \nIEEs will be updated to comply with the Safeguard Policy Statement, and an updated, integrated \nIEE will be disclosed on ADB website upon approval by the ADB Board of Directors. NTDC will \nconduct a detailed IEE for a 7 km transmission line. Initial findings indicate limited impacts since \nthe transmission line will pass through mostly barren lands with sparse vegetation and avifauna. \nAn environmental management plan will also be developed to mitigate mostly construction-related \nimpacts.  TBCC  will  submit  periodic  monitoring  reports  to  ADB.  Information  disclosure  and \nconsultations with affected people and land users were conducted following ADB requirements. \nTBCC will establish a grievance redress mechanism to handle project grievances. TBCC\u2019s \ninstitutional capacity and commitment to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts \nare deemed adequate. \n \n20.  All wind farm components (Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s \nPublic Communications Policy), will be located within the leased area, which is uninhabited and \nagriculturally unproductive. A portion of the proposed wind farm has been used for opportunistic \ngrazing when intermittent rain has produced edible foliage. The project will not affect these \noccasional herders as other grazing grounds are available, and the site will remain accessible to \nthem  within  health  and  safety  limits.  NTDC  will  construct  the  7  km  transmission  line  on \ngovernment land, and the line will not impact any individual or household. The project will not \nimpact any indigenous peoples. \n \n21.  Other social dimensions. The project is categorized as having no gender element given \nits limited potential for gender-inclusive design. The project has no gender-specific employment \ntarget since it is not common in Pakistan for women to work in construction. TBCC, however, \nadheres to the principle that there will be no discrimination in recruiting project workers. During \nthe peak construction period, the EPC contractor and its subcontractors will engage about 300 \nworkers. During operations, the number of workers will be reduced to about 35 persons. TBCC \nwill ensure that its contractors and their subcontractors comply with national labor laws and, \npursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy, will take measures to comply with internationally \nrecognized core labor standards.11 The borrower will be required to report regularly to ADB on (i) \nits compliance with such laws, and (ii) the measures taken to comply with such laws. TBCC will \nconduct continuous engagement with the community and consultation with affected people \nfollowing ADB requirements. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n22.  TBCC, STML, and BAFL were advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international \npractice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB \nwill  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting \ncorruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event \nof noncompliance. \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2003.
