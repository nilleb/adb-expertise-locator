It  has  the  largest  provincial  economic  base  in  the  country, \naccounting  for  over  50%  of  Pakistan\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP). \nWhile  the  province  has  achieved  robust  economic  growth  in  recent \nyears, its social indicators have lagged behind those of the other South \nAsian  countries.  The  government  of  Punjab  (GoPb)  has  placed  high \npriority on the attainment of MDGs, and has recently increased budget \nallocations to social sectors. The province is likely to achieve all MDGs \nexcept reduction of the infant mortality rate (MDG4) from  77 to 40 per \n1000  live  births,  and  the  maternal  mortality  ratio  (MDG5)  from  300  to \n140  per  100,000  live  births.  More  serious  efforts  are  needed  to  attain \nthese  two  essential  health  MDGs.  If  they  are  achieved,  Punjab  can \nleast  11,000  women  and \npotentially  save \n235,000 children by 2015. \n \nRecognizing the critical need, the GoPb has developed a health sector \nreform framework, and has sought support from the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  to  accelerate  attainment  of  the  two  health  MDGs.  At  a \nbroader  level,  it  has  initiated  service  delivery  reforms  as  part  of  the \nADB-supported Public Resource Management Program and the Punjab \nDevolved  Social  Services  Program.  The  former  aims  to  improve  the \noperational  efficiency  of  the  provincial  government  and  thereby  create \nfiscal  space  for  social  service  delivery,  while  the  latter  aims  to \nstrengthen  district  systems  and  develop  necessary  service  delivery \nstandards  for  devolved  social  services,  including  health,  education, \nwater supply, and sanitation. \n \n\nlives  of  at \n\nthe \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProgram Rationale \n\n \n\n\fADB  has  been  committed  to  MDGs  since  2002.  The  attainment  of \nMDGs  will  help  achieve  inclusive  economic  growth,  a  key  objective  of \nADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic  framework  2008\u20132020  (Strategy  2020), \nwhich encourages ADB member countries to promote greater access to \nopportunities  by  expanding  human  capacities,  especially  for  the \ndisadvantaged,  through  investments  in  education,  health,  and  basic \nsocial  protections.  In  line  with  Strategy  2020,  the  PMDGP  focuses  on \ngovernance  of  health  service  delivery  and  management  of  public \nresources.  Moreover,  the  PMDGP  adopts  a  programmatic  modality, \nwhich  by  leveraging  policy  and  institutional  reforms  is  expected  to \nensure  sustained  GoPb  focus  on  health  sector  needs  beyond  the \nmedium term, unlike stand-alone project interventions. \n\nThe  PMDGP  is  an  integral  part  of  the  Punjab  Government  Efficiency \nImprovement Program Cluster approved by ADB in December 2007.  \n\nThe  PMDGP  marks  a  major  priority  shift  by  the  Punjab  Health \nDepartment from quantity to quality of health care, from fragmented to \nconsolidated health service, and from tertiary to primary and secondary \nhealth  care.  The  impact  of  the  PMDGP  is  the  attainment  of  MDGs \nrelating  to  the  reduction  of  the  infant  mortality  rate  and  maternal \nmortality  ratio  in  Punjab  Province.  The  Program\u2019s  outcome  will  be \nimproved  access,  quality,  and  equity  of  health  services.  The  Program \nwill  assist  the  GoPb  in  undertaking  health  sector  reforms  in  the \nfollowing areas.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nImproving  the  Availability  and  Quality  of  Primary  and \nSecondary  Health  Services.  PMDGP  will  help  GoPb  ensure \nimplementation  of  certain  minimum  service  delivery \nthe \nstandards  (MSDS)  for  primary  and  secondary  health  services, \nthrough  incorporation  of  the  MSDS  in  provincial  and  district \nhealth sector plans, and by increasing the quality and quantity of \nhuman resources in the health sector.  \n\nStrengthening  Management  of  Health  Service  Delivery. \nPMDGP  will  help  the  GoPb  improve  the  daily  management  of \nhealth service delivery by reducing delays in the procurement of \nessential  drugs, \nthe  contracting  of  health \nservices  to  nongovernment  organizations,  and  improving  the \nexisting performance monitoring and evaluation systems.  \n\ninstitutionalizing \n\nEstablishing  a  Sustainable  Pro-Poor  Health  Financing \nSystem. PMDGP will assist the GoPb in substantially increasing \nthe  health  care  budget  and \nimproving  planning  and \nmanagement  of  the  budget,  introducing  a  targeted  program  for \nreducing out-of-pocket health expenditure among the poor, and \ndeveloping  a  sustainable  health  care  financing  and  provider \npayment system. \n\nii \n\n \n\n \n\nProgram \nDescription \n\n \n\n\f \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\nProgram Period and \nTranche Release \n\n \nExecuting Agency  \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\niii\n\nthe  MSDS \n\nis  projected \n\nimplementation  of \n\nto  cost  GoPb \nFull \nPRs34 billion  ($425  million)  over  2008-2011.  The  first  phase  of  MSDS \nimplementation, with focus on maternal, neonatal, and child health, will \ncost about PRs7 billion ($88 million) apart from expenditure for capacity \nbuilding  and  enhancement  of  information  systems.  Overall,  health  and \nsafety-net related public expenditures are estimated at $735 million for \nFY2009. For subprogram 1, given the significant pro-poor impact of the \nproposed measures, ADB will provide a loan of $100 million equivalent \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. For subsequent programs, $200 \nmillion\u2013$300  million  in  total  is  envisaged,  depending  on  reform \nprogress, expenditure requirements and the availability of resources. \n \nThe loan from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will have an interest rate \nof  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter, a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and \nsuch other terms and conditions as set forth in the loan agreement. The \nBorrower  will  be  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan.  The  Government  of \nPakistan will relend the local currency generated from the proceeds of \nthe loan to GoPb. The terms and conditions will be the same as those \nextended by ADB to the Borrower.  \n\nfor \n\nthe \n\nimplementation  period \n\nThe  local  currency  counterpart  funds  generated  from  the  loan  will  be \nused  to  increase  the  GoPb\u2019s  health  sector  budget,  and  transferred  to \nthe district governments, earmarked for implementing MSDS.  \n \nThe  implementation  period  for  PMDGP  subprogram  1  is  from  January \nto  October  2008.  The \nfor \nindicative \nsubprogram 2 is November 2008\u2013November 2009; for subprogram 3, it \nis  January\u2013December  2010.  The loans  supporting  the subprograms  of \nthe PMDGP will be disbursed in a single tranche subject to satisfactory \ncompletion  of  all  policy  actions  applicable \nrespective \nsubprogram,  and  effectiveness  of  the  respective  subprogram.  Upon \ncompletion  of  all  subprograms,  the  PMDGP  is  expected  to  be \ncompleted by 30 June 2011.  \n \nThe Health Department of GoPb will be the Executing Agency.  \n \nThe  program  management  unit  for  the  Health  Sector  Reform  Program \nwill  be  responsible  for  daily  coordination  and  management  of  the \nPMDGP. The existing program steering committee for the health sector \nthe  Planning  and \nreform  program\u2014chaired  by  chairman  of \nDevelopment  Board,  comprising  the  secretary  of  health,  secretary  of \nfinance,  secretary  of  local  government  and  community  development, \nand  health  care  providers  as  members\u2014will  be  the  program  steering \ncommittee for the PMDGP and oversee policy decisions. The program \nsteering  committee  will  meet  at  least  once  every  6 months.  A  working \ngroup  will  be  constituted  for  developing  pro-poor  health  care  financing \nand provider payment.  \n\nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n\nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange \ncosts (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured \nin  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  the  items  specified  in  a  negative \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \nProgram Benefits \nand Impacts \n\n \n\nlist  of  ineligible  items  (and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral  sources).  The  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be \ndisbursed  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  as  the  Borrower.  No \nsupporting  import  documentation  will  be  required  if,  during  each  year \nthat  the  loan  proceeds  are  expected  to  be  disbursed,  the  value  of \nPakistan\u2019s  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries, \nineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development \nassistance is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected \nto  be  disbursed  during  that  year.  The  Government  of  Pakistan  will \ncertify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal  request. \nOtherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be \nrequired.  Disbursements  will  be  made  under  the  simplified  procedures \nfor program loans.  \n \nImproved  Access  and  Quality  of  Primary  and  Secondary  Health \nCare  Services.  By  helping  Punjab  attain  the  health  MDGs,  the \nproposed  Program  could  potentially  save  up  to  11,000  women\u2019s  lives \nand 235,000 lives of infants by 2015 compared to the scenario without \nprogram  support.  This  would  be  contingent,  however,  on  additional \ninvestments being made by the GoPb. By helping district governments \nto  endorse  and  implement  MSDS,  the  Program  will  ensure  that \nstandards are followed across the province.  \n \nPoverty  Reduction.  Poor  people  have  the  worst  health  outcomes. \nThey are pushed further into poverty because of ill health\u2014resulting in \nlower  productivity  or  loss  of  daily  wages,  and  burden  of  health  care \nexpenditure.  Although  public  health  care  is  in  principle  free,  patients \noften have to pay a substantial amount because of missing drugs and \nsupplies  at  public  health  facilities.  The  proposed  Program  will  reduce \nthe health care burden and the risks of falling seriously ill through timely \nhealth interventions, by making quality care available and affordable at \npublic \nthe \ndevelopment of an equitable health financing system.  \n \nEconomic Impact. Improved public financial management in the health \nsector and better strategic planning skills in the Health Department will \ncontribute to increased value for money of public spending. Provision of \nconditional grants to district governments for MDG-related interventions \nwill  ease  the  district  governments\u2019  resource  limitation  while  ensuring \nthat  social  sectors  are  protected  from  expenditure  cuts.  Increased \naccess  to  and  quality  of  public  health  services  will  also  have  a  direct \npoverty reducing impact by reducing the burden of health expenditures \non the poor.  \n \nSustainable  and  Efficient  Health  Care  Financing  System.  The \nProgram will increase and improve the efficiency of the public stream of \nhealth care financing while supporting development of alternative health \ncare  financing  systems  that  may  pool  different  financial  resources. \nStrengthened  internal  controls  and  increased  transparency  in  the \nallocation  of  resources  will  ensure  that  public  funds  are  spent  in \naccordance to needs and that resource leakage is minimized.  \n\ntargeted  program,  and \n\nthrough  a \n\nfacilities \n\nthrough \n\n\f \n\n \n\nv\n\nthe  ground \n\nimplementation \n\n \nInstitutional Impact. Establishment of the strategy and policy unit and \nfinancial management cell within the Health Department will ensure that \npolicies  and  strategies  are  properly  defined,  corresponding  actions \nplanned,  and  resources  allocated  accordingly;  and  that  the  budget \npreparation  and  execution  process  is  owned  at  the  managerial  level. \nRevitalization of the internal audit wing and of the departmental account \ncommittees  in  the  Health  Department,  and  appointing internal  auditors \nat district governments, will increase accountability for the use of public \nfunds.  \n  \nRevisions to the Decentralization Framework. The future of the local \ngovernment  system  under  the  present  political  setup  may  be  at  risk. \nWhile  a  drastic  reversal  of  the  devolved  setup  is  unlikely,  changes  in \nthe  current  attribution  of  power  and  authority  across \nlevels  of \ngovernment  may  occur.  However,  the  health  sector  is  likely  to  remain \nrequirements. \nlevel \ndevolved  given \nRegardless,  the  flexibility  built  into  the  cluster  approach  is  suitable  for \nchanging the implementation arrangements.  \n \nGovernance  Risks. As in any complex environment with capacity and \nresource constraints, there are governance risks in the areas of public \nfinancial management, expenditure planning and control, procurement, \nand  anticorruption.  As  a  program  loan,  the  PMDGP  deliberately  and \nexplicitly  puts  governance  and  public  expenditure  management  issues \nat the center of the reform effort. Reforms proposed under the PMDGP \nwill  positively  affect  the  current  institutional  setup  in  the  health  sector \nand  address  these  governance  risks.  The  change  in  public  financial \nmanagement practices and the emphasis on results-based allocation of \nresources  is  likely  to  encounter  resistance  from  middle  management \nofficials who have vested interests in perpetuating the current situation. \nThe  strong  commitment \nthe  highest  political  and \nto  reform  at \nbureaucratic  level  within  the  Health  Department  will  help  mitigate  this \nrisk.  In  addition,  internal  and  external  performance  monitoring  and \nevaluation, and publicizing the performance are expected to change the \nsituation  gradually.  The  PMDGP  has  built-in  third  party  assessments, \nincluding a citizen satisfaction survey, as policy conditions.  \n \nImplementation  Risks.  The  proposed  Program  is  building  on  the \nachievements of the Punjab Devolved Social Services Program and the \nPublic  Resource  Management  Program,  but  still  requires  technical \nassistance  (TA)  support  for  capacity  building  of  district  governments \nand  the  Office  of  the  Director  General,  Health  Services;  and  for \ndesigning  health  care \nimplementation \nproblems  encountered  in  TA  loans  in  Pakistan,  a  deliberate  decision \nwas taken against a TA loan for the PMDGP. The Health Department is \ncoordinating  with  the  PDSSP  program  management  unit  to  utilize \nresources from an ongoing $20 million TA grant attached to the Punjab \nDevolved  Social  Services  Program  (financed  by  the  Department  for \nInternational Development of the United Kingdom) to mitigate the risk.  \n \n\nfinancing.  Based  on  past \n\nRisks \n\n \n\n\fin \nExternal  and  Macroeconomic  Risks.  The  recent  upsurge \ninternational  commodity  prices  is  having  an  adverse  impact  on \nPakistan\u2019s  macroeconomic  indicators.

For  the  first  time  since  FY2003,  the \neconomy  has  posted  a  real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  rate  below  6%,  caused  by \nboth  domestic  and  international  developments.  During  FY2008,  domestic  supply  shocks  and \nrising  international  food  and  fuel  prices  have  pushed  inflation  above  25%.  After  2  years  of \nmodest increase, the fiscal deficit\u2013GDP ratio rose to 7.4% in FY2008, breaching the 4% of GDP \nthreshold  set  by  the  Fiscal  Responsibility  Act,  2005.  Higher  global  food  and  fuel  prices  have \naffected  the  budget  through  higher  subsidies  for  oil,  wheat,  electricity,  and  fertilizers.  During \nFY2008,  government  borrowing  from  the  central  bank  has  almost  doubled,  as  it  has  been  a \nmain source of deficit financing2 in the presence of a deteriorating external account. The current \naccount  deficit  has  deteriorated  (about  8%  against  a  target  5%)  because  of  higher  imports, \ndriven  by  higher  prices  and  strong  aggregate  demand,  and  lower  exports,  especially  in  the \ntextile sector. The capital account surplus has also deteriorated because of a decline in foreign \ndirect investments and lower portfolio investments. On the other hand, the growth in remittances \n(17.4%) has not been sufficient to offset the decline in other components of the capital account. \nThe progressive depletion of foreign exchange reserves has led to a sharp depreciation (22%) \nof  the  Pakistan  rupee  against  the  US dollar  since  July  2007.  In  order  to  restore  stability,  the \nGovernment  of  Pakistan  has  signed  a  Letter  of  Intent  on  20  November  2008  seeking  a \n$7.6 billion stand-by arrangement from the International Monetary Fund, as part of which broad-\nranging macroeconomic reforms have been agreed upon. \n \n3. \nPunjab contributes more than 50% of the Pakistan\u2019s GDP and is home to 56% of its total \npopulation. Punjab\u2019s GDP growth rate for FY2007 was estimated at 7.8%. The slowdown of the \nnational economy is likely to impact Punjab\u2019s economy as well. Although reliable data on GDP \ngrowth  projections  are  not  available,  revised  budget  figures  for  FY2008  and  budget  estimates \nfor FY2009 provide some insights as to the effects of the economic slowdown on the provincial \neconomy.  These  point  to  a  widening  budget  deficit  mostly  caused  by  shrinking  revenue \nreceipts.3 General revenue receipts have decreased by 11% because of lower tax (\u201318%) and \nnon-tax (\u201330%) revenues and lower federal transfers (\u20133%) and grants (\u201334%) during FY2008. \nTotal expenditures have been lower than budgeted (\u20138%) mainly because of lower development \nspending (\u201313%). \n \n4. \nThe  provincial  budget  for  FY2009  contains  a  subsidy  package  of  PRs13  billion  in  the \nform  of  cash  transfers  to  the  poorest  to  compensate  for  higher  food  prices  and  maintain \naffordability of health services. For FY2009, Punjab\u2019s share of the national financial commission \naward  will  be  25%  higher  than  in  FY2008  because  of  the  federal  government\u2019s  decision  to \nincrease the general sales tax on consumer goods and services from 15% to 16%, which may \nhelp meet the additional expenditures somewhat. Provincial tax revenues will increase by 8%, \n\n                                                 \n1 Appendix 1 presents the design and monitoring framework for the PMDGP. \n2 The Government\u2019s outstanding borrowings with the State Bank of Pakistan has almost doubled over FY2008. \n3  According  to  FY2008  budget  estimates,  the  fiscal  deficit  was  estimated  at  about  PRs37.315  billion.  Revised \n\nestimates released in March 2008 point to a larger deficit of about PRs46.5 billion.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fwhile total spending will also rise by 8%. The overall financing gap is expected to be lower than \nthe (revised) figure for FY2008.4 \n \n5. \nAgainst  this  backdrop  of  fiscal  constraints,  GoPb  has  been  able  to  preserve  health \nsector spending from drastic cuts. Although starting from a low base, per capita health spending \nby  the  public  sector  has  been  increasing  in  recent  years\u2014$4.4  in  FY2007;  $5.77  in  FY2008 \n(revised  estimates);  and  $6.38  in  FY2009  (budget  estimates).  Yet,  this  is  far  less  than  the \nresource allocation in comparable South Asian countries.5  \n \n6. \nGoPb has sought support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to bolster its efforts \nto  increase  the  quality  of  and  access  to  key  social  services,  especially  by  improving \nmanagement  of  service  delivery  and  public  resources.  GoPb  has  been  undertaking  education \nsector reforms for the last several years with the World Bank\u2019s program support, and has seen \neducation Millennium Development Goal (MDG) indicators improve. On the other hand, health \nMDGs  have  shown  very  little  improvement.  In  line  with  the  thrust  of  ADB\u2019s  recently  approved \nlong-term strategic framework (Strategy 2020),6 the PMDGP will support health sector reforms \nwith the objective of promoting inclusive growth, by improving access\u2014particularly of the poor\u2014\nto  quality  health  care.  As  a  programmatic  operation,  the  PMDGP  will  not  directly  finance \nconstruction  of  health  facilities,  and  it  will  approach  health  sector  and  public  financial \nmanagement reforms with the goal of improving the overall efficiency of the public sector, in line \nwith  the  thrust  of  Strategy  2020.  ADB  has  been  working  with  GoPb  through  the  Punjab \nDevolved Social Services Program (PDSSP)7 for the past 3 years. It has also provided support \nfor  broad-based  public  sector  resource  management  reforms  through  the  Punjab  Resource \nManagement  Program  (PRMP) 8  from  2003\u20132007,  and  through  the  Punjab  Government \nEfficiency Improvement Program (PGEIP)9 approved in December 2007. At the request of GoPb, \nthe conceptual framework for the proposed PMDGP was included as part of the PGEIP.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n7. \nAt  the  national  level,  Pakistan  recognizes  the  need  to  improve  health  outcomes  as  an \nimportant  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  alleviation  plan.  Pakistan\u2019s  National  Health  Policy \n2001 10  prioritizes  primary  and  secondary  health  care,  and  emphasizes  the  need  for  good \ngovernance  as  the  basis  of  health  sector  reform.  However,  the  national  policy  has  not  been \nimplemented  effectively  because  of  resource  and  capacity  constraints,  and  the  absence  of  a \nconcrete action plan with measurable outputs. As a result, Pakistan compares poorly on infant \nand maternal mortality indicators among the South Asian countries (Table 1). Pakistan also lags \nbehind  comparable  countries  with  respect  to  public  as  well  as  private  expenditures  on  health \n                                                 \n4  FY2009 budget estimates point to a fiscal deficit of PRs27 billion.  \n5  Appendix 2, Table A2.2. \n6 ADB.  2008.

Punjab has the highest under-five mortality rate and an infant mortality rate (IMR) \nthat  surpasses  other  countries  in  the  region,  although  it  compares  favorably  on  maternal \nmortality in relation to other countries in South Asia. In Pakistan the IMR is higher in rural than \nurban areas, and among boys than girls (80 for boys and 73 for girls). Higher levels of women\u2019s \neducation and household wealth correlate with a lower IMR and maternal mortality ratio (MMR). \n \n\nTable 1: Key Health Indicators for Pakistan and Punjab \nin Comparison with Selected Countries \n\nUnder-Five Mortality Rateb  Maternal Mortality Ratioa \n\nInfant Mortality Ratea \n\nCountry \nBhutan \nBangladesh \nIndia \nNepal \nSri Lanka \nPakistan \nPunjabc \n  a United Nations Population Fund. 2007.

It  has  embarked  on  social  sector  reforms  with  its  own \nresources as well as support from the international community. MDG attainment has been given \nprominence in Punjab\u2019s medium-term development agenda. Yet, while the province is likely to \nachieve most MDGs by the targeted date of 2015, it is seriously lagging behind on two important \ngoals\u2014MDG4,  which  includes  reducing  the  IMR;  and  MDG5,  in  reducing  the  MMR.  Without \nsignificant and concerted additional efforts and wide-ranging reforms in health service delivery \nand  improvements  in  health  care  financing,  the  province  is  unlikely  to  reach  these  two  MDGs \n(Appendix  3).  Failure  on  this  front  would  have  serious  implications,  given  the  size  of  the \nprovince and its contribution to Pakistan\u2019s economy.   \n \n9. \nIMR and MMR are in Table 2.  \n\nThe  Health  Department\u2019s  targets  and  the  associated  health  service  indicators  for  the \n\nTable 2: Key Health MDGs and Associated Indicators for Punjab \n \n\nTargeting Indicators  \nInfant Mortality Rate per 1,000 Live Births \nUnder-Five Mortality Rate per 1,000 Live Births \nMaternal Mortality Ratio per 100,000 Live Births \nPercentage of Births Attended by Skilled Birth Attendants \nPercentage of Fully Immunized Children (12\u201323 months old) \n\nFY2004a \n77 \n112 \n300 \n32 \n50 \n\nFY2007b  2015 Targets \n\n71 \n102 \n300 \n38 \n79.7 \n\n40 \n47 \n140 \n100 \nAbove 80 \n\nMDG = Millennium Development Goal. \n a Government of the Punjab. 2004.

About 70% \nof infant deaths in Pakistan and Punjab occur during the neonatal period,11 the majority of which \n\n                                                 \n11 National  Institute  of  Population  Studies  (Pakistan)  and  Macro  International  Inc.  2008.

The  percentage  of  births  attended  by  skilled  birth \nattendants  remains  very  low.  Only  a  third  of  the  deliveries  take  place  at  health  facilities. \nAccording to the District-Based Multiple-indicators Cluster Survey, 2003-04,12 the IMR in Punjab \ndoes  not  show  a  significant  difference  by  gender  (81  for  boys  and  73  for  girls),  while  the \ndifference between major cities and rural areas is large (82 for rural areas, 74 for urban areas, \nand  55  for  major  cities).  The  urban\u2013rural  disparity  in  health  indicators  reflects  the  historical \nurban  bias  of  health  spending,  i.e.,  the  main  part  of  public  health  expenditure  has  been  in \ntertiary hospitals in major cities, at the expense of investments in district level health services, \nespecially in rural areas.  \n\n11. \nTimely use of quality primary and secondary health care by the poor, especially women \nand children in rural areas, is the key to attaining the MDGs relating to the IMR and MMR. The \nPunjab  Local  Government  Ordinance  (PLGO)  has  made  the  district  governments  responsible \nfor primary  and secondary health services, which  are the key to attaining MDGs,  whereas the \nprovincial Health Department has retained responsibility for policy setting for the entire sector; \nperformance  monitoring;  and  the  provision  of  tertiary  care  services,  medical  education,  and \nresearch and development. Punjab\u2019s primary health service system consists of 293 rural health \ncenters  (RHCs),  2,456  basic  health  units  (BHUs),  and  188  maternal  and  child  health  centers. \nFor secondary health services, there are 35 district headquarter hospitals (DHQs) and 77 tehsil \nheadquarter hospitals (THQs). Punjab has over 140,000 health department employees spread \nacross its 35 districts.  \n\n12. \nRealizing  that  health  MDGs  would  not  be  attained  without  wide-ranging  health  sector \nreforms, GoPb has developed a health sector reform framework as part of the ADB-supported \nPRMP. It has also designed a Health Sector Reform Program (HSRP), which has been under \nimplementation with GoPb\u2019s own financing since 2006.13 In parallel, GoPb has taken measures \nto strengthen district level social service delivery systems through the PDSSP. GoPb has also \nadopted minimum service delivery standards (MSDS) for health services through PDSSP.  \n\nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n13. \nIn Punjab, the health system consists of two parallel streams. The budget-based public \nhealth  system  provides  health  care  to  any  user  of  a  public  facility,  with  negligible  official  user \ncharges.  The  private  health  care  system  is  largely  unregulated  and  charges  fees  for  services. \nQualified  private  providers  mainly  cater  to  urban  populations  who  can  afford  the  fees.  Public \nsector  spending  accounts  for  less  than  20%  of  total  expenditures,  with  privately  provided  and \nprocured  health  care  dominating  the  sector.  Yet,  for  the  rural  poor,  public  health  facilities  are \noften the only choice for receiving qualified and affordable medical care.  \n\n14. \nDespite the massive network of public primary and secondary health facilities, coverage \nof basic health services remains low (Appendix 4). The reasons for low coverage of basic health \nservices  include  limited  availability  and  low  quality  of  services,  and  suboptimal  health-seeking \nbehavior.  Public  primary  health  care  has  been  largely  underutilized  mainly  because  of  the \nabsence  of  doctors,  unavailability  of  drugs,  and  unreliable  and  poor  quality  of  services.  The \nbiggest obstacle for improving quality is the absence of doctors and paramedics, and the poor \nquality  of  their  training.  The  day-to-day  management  of  health  services  has  suffered  from \ninadequate  capacity,  challenges  in  recruiting  and  posting  motivated  doctors  and  other \nprofessionals in rural and remote areas, rigid administrative procedures, inefficient and lengthy \nprocurement processes for drugs and medical supplies, and lack of performance monitoring to \n                                                 \n12 GoPb. 2004. District-Based Multi Indicators Cluster Survey 2003-04. Lahore.  \n13 The HSRP has focused on rehabilitation of primary health facilities and incentives for doctors at BHUs. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nidentify  problems  and  solutions  periodically.  With  health  sector  spending  less  than 2%  of  total \npublic expenditures, the public health service has been severely underfinanced, and the limited \nresources available have not been effectively allocated or used. \n\nPublic  health  service  in  Pakistan  is  financed  and  managed  by  governments  at  three \n15. \ndifferent  levels\u2014federal,  provincial,  and  district.  The  2001  PLGO  devolved  responsibility  for \nprimary and secondary health service delivery to district governments. However, this devolution \nwas  not  supported  by  sufficient  structural  changes  and  capacity  building  efforts  for  the  Health \nDepartment,  especially  for  the  Office  of  Director  General,  Health  Services  (ODGHS),  and  for \ndistrict  governments.  District  governments  remain  dependent  on  provincial  fiscal  transfers. \nAlthough  budget  planning  and  execution  is  transferred  to  district  governments,  there  is  limited \nplanning  and  management  capacity  at  district  health  departments.  The  approval  of  health \nworkers\u2019  posts  in  primary  and  secondary  health  care  facilities  largely  remain  with  the  Health \nDepartment, not with district governments, while the recruitment of lower level posts has been \nshifted to district governments\u2019 responsibility. No mechanism has been developed yet to monitor \nthe  performance  of  the  district  health  departments.  Federally-financed  health  programs  have \ntheir  own  implementation  and  reporting  mechanisms,  and  their  coordination  and  information-\nsharing with district health departments is often limited.  \n\n16. \nFigure  1  illustrates  the  key  challenges  facing  the  attainment  of  the  two  critical  health \nMDGs  in  Punjab.  In  summary,  the  delivery  of  maternal,  neonatal,  and  child  health  (MNCH) \nservice in Punjab suffers from three main problems: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nlow quality and uneven adherence to service delivery norms, \npoor management of health service delivery, and \ninadequate financing and weak fiduciary systems. \n\n1. \n\nNeed for Implementing Service Delivery Standards \n\n17. \nThe  demand  for,  and  spending  on,  private  health  care  is  higher  because  the  public \nperceive the quality of private health care to be better than that at public health facilities. Low \nquality, lack of standardized provision of health services within and across health facilities, lack \nof  adequate  human  resources,  and  lack  of  drugs  and  medical  supplies  have  been  the  main \nimpediments resulting in the low utilization of BHUs and RHCs. The public either chooses to use \nunqualified health care providers or home treatment, or go to hospitals even for minor illnesses. \nThis  has  resulted  in  delays  in  seeking  appropriate  health  care  when  needed  as  well  as \novercrowded hospitals. \n\n18. \nBoth  the  federal  and  provincial  governments  are  allowed  to  set  health  sector  policies. \nAlthough the GoPb does not have a health sector policy specific to Punjab, the National Health \nPolicy gives a reasonable vision, focusing on (i) poverty alleviation, (ii) primary and secondary \nhealth  care,  and  (iii)  good  governance.  However,  it  does  not  specify  the  steps  and  outputs \nrequired  for  realizing  the  vision  or  MDGs.  Without  specifying  what  services  are  provided  at \nwhich level of health care by whom, and the minimum acceptable quality for different types of \nservices  to  achieve  the  goals,  it  has  been  impossible  to  translate  the  policy  and  the  MDG \ncommitment of GoPb into investments and action plans.  \n\n \n\n\fFigure 1: Problem Tree for the Punjab Health Care System \n\nPoor Health Outcome \nHigh MMR and IMR \n\nPoor Health Status \n\nPoverty \n\nLack of Timely Use of  \nQuality Health Services \n\nBurden of Health \nExpenditure \n\nLimited Availability of \nQuality Health Care \n\nLack of Pro-Poor  \nHealth Financing \n\nPoor Health \nFacilities \n\nAbsence of Skilled  \nHealth Workers \n\nLack of Equipment,  \nDrugs Supplies \n\nInadequate Training\n\nReluctance to be  \nPosted in Rural Areas \n\nPoor Enforcement of Standards \n\nLack of Private \nSector Regulations \n\nPoor Resource \nManagement \n\nUnder-Financing \n\n \n\nIMR=infant mortality rate, MMR=maternal mortality ratio. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n19. \nThe MSDS notified in Punjab in December 2007 have filled this crucial gap. They were \ndeveloped  through  consultations  involving  provincial  and  district  health  officials  and  public \nhealth specialists, based on reviews of service delivery standards in other South Asian countries \n(Bangladesh,  India,  and  Sri  Lanka);  the  international  evidence-based  standards  set  by  the \nWorld Health Organization for developing countries; and existing services in Punjab. The MSDS \ndefine  the  minimum  package  of  services  that  the  public  is  entitled  to,  a  set  of  performance \nindicators and minimum acceptable levels of performance by service providers at each level of \nhealth  care,  and  the  required  physical  and  human  resource  requirements.  To  facilitate  the \nimplementation  of  MSDS,  GoPb  has  also  developed  comprehensive  referral  guidelines, \nstandard operating procedures (SOPs), and standard medical protocols (SMPs). MSDS, SOPs, \nand SMPs together have well-defined accountability parameters at each level of health care, for \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\ndifferent health professionals, and benchmarks against which performance of the health system \nas a whole and that of each worker will be monitored and evaluated.  \n\n20. \nImplementation of the MSDS, SOPs, SMPs, and the referral system will help attain the \nMDGs  and  lead  to  an  overall  improvement  in  public  health  through  better  primary  and \nsecondary  health  care. These  standards  and  protocols  need  to  be  updated  periodically  based \non emerging requirements. In parallel, building capacity for evidence-based medicine will be a \nmedium-term requirement.  \n\n21. \nThe  lack  of  well-trained  human  resources  is  the  biggest  constraint  in  implementing \nMSDS. To implement the MNCH-related MSDS successfully, it is critical to have adequate and \nwell-qualified  and  skilled  women  medical  officers  (WMOs),  midwives,  nurses,  female  health \nvisitors, and paramedics. Currently, about 22% of the approved posts for various health workers \nat BHUs and RHCs in Punjab are vacant. Among the medical staff, the highest (32%) proportion \nof vacant posts is for the WMO. Similarly, 37% of the approved posts for nurses at BHUs and \nRHCs are currently vacant. At DHQs, almost one third of the approved posts of gynecologists \nand anesthetists are vacant. The situation is even worse at THQs, where 48% of the approved \nposts of gynecologists and 59% of anesthetists\u2019 posts are vacant. 14 \n \n22. \nTo  implement  MNCH-related  MSDS  effectively,  about  14,000  new  posts  need  to  be \napproved  and  filled.  They  include  about  660  specialists  (primarily  gynecologists,  obstetricians, \nanesthetists,  and  pediatricians);  about  1,550  medical  officers  (including  WMOs);  about \n5,000 nurses;  3,000  each  of  lady  health  visitors  and  midwives;  and  1,000  paramedics.  The \nshortage  is  especially  pronounced  among  paramedics  and  nurses.  Against  this  requirement, \nPunjab  produces  about  1,400\u20131,600  nurses  and  350  lady  health  visitors per  year.  In  addition, \n39,000  nurses  have  been  registered  until  2006.  Therefore,  once  posts  are  approved,  a \nsubstantial part of them are expected to be filled in the next 2 years. For some posts, however, \nadditional measures may be necessary for attracting health workers to the posts. For example, \nPunjab  produces  a  large  number  of  doctors\u2014including  female  doctors\u2014in  relation  to  nurses, \nbut the availability of WMOs (particularly in rural areas) is a challenge as many female doctors \nleave  the  profession  or  opt  to  practice  in  urban  areas.  GoPb  has  introduced  incentives  for \ndoctors posted at BHUs. As a result, their vacancies at BHUs have significantly reduced for the \nlast 2 years.  \n \n23. \nApart  from  the  quantitative  challenge,  there  are  serious  quality  concerns  in  the  health \nprofession.  Some  of  the  medical  training  institutions  in  Punjab  do  not  appear  to  apply  any \nstringent  quality  standards.  In  addition,  there  is  no  continuous  education  system  to  enable \ndoctors to update their knowledge and skills regularly. Further, the quality of paramedics is not \nup to required standards. For instance, the entrance requirement for dispensers is only 10 years \nof  schooling.  Since  1947,  only  about  35,000  dispensers  have  been  qualified  out  of  1.2  million \nwho  appeared  for  the  exam  after  a  year  of  training.  The  quality  of  training  offered  is  very  low \nmainly because of lack of qualified trainers. Consequently, the quality of the paramedics is low \nand they are ill-prepared to offer quality care.   \n  \nThe HSRP has made substantial headway in closing gaps in physical infrastructure and \n24. \nstaff  requirements.  Vacant  positions  at  RHCs  and  BHUs  are  being  filled  through  monetary \nincentives for doctors. Absenteeism is actively checked. Correspondingly, the utilization rates of \nRHCs  and  BHUs  are  increasing,  albeit  slowly.  The  federal  MNCH  program  also  plans  to \nupgrade  the  maternal  wards  and  delivery  rooms  of  DHQs,  THQs,  and  RHCs.  The  federal \n\n                                                 \n14 GoPb. 2008. HSRP database. Lahore.  \n\n \n\n\fgovernment\u2019s  plan  to  increase  coverage  of  lady  health  workers  who  provide  preventive  health \ncare  and  health  education  in  the  community  is  expected  to  improve  people\u2019s  health-seeking \nbehavior. It is critical that the PMDGP help Punjab sustain reforms and investments, and ensure \nstaff retention to improve the quality of health care provision for MNCH. \n \n\n2. \n\nNeed for Improved Management of Health Service Delivery \n\n25.  Management  and  Performance  Monitoring.  One  of  the  lessons  from  the  PDSSP  is \nthat district governments require substantial technical assistance (TA) to develop and manage a \nrational and strategic action plan. ODGHS,  which was responsible for delivering district health \nservices before the 2001 devolution, is now responsible for providing TA to district governments \nand  monitoring  performance  of  health  services  in  districts.  The  structure  and  capacity  of  the \noffice,  however,  has  not  been  adjusted  to  its  new  responsibilities;  consequently,  there  is  a \nserious  vacuum  of  monitoring  and  supervision.  The  office  still  has  10  senior  directors  and \n350 supporting  staff,  and  in  some  cases  continues  to  work  on  services  that  are  supposed  to \nhave  been  devolved.  On  the  other  hand,  the  district  health  departments  are  left  to  assume \nresponsibilities  for  primary  and  secondary  health  service  delivery,  without  the  Health \nDepartment\u2019s technical support.  \n \n26.  Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) cannot be effective in the absence of a comprehensive \ninformation  system.  There  is  no  consolidated  source  in  place  that  provides  reliable  and \ncomprehensive health information on time to those managing health services. At the provincial \nlevel,  the  HSRP  has  its  own  effective  mechanism  of  collecting  information  through  M&E \nassistants whereas ODGHS collects routine information from health facilities through executive \ndistrict  officers  (EDOs),  Health.  Federal  or  provincial  vertical  programs  and  donor-funded \nprojects have their own mechanisms to collect information through their respective district and \nsubdistrict  coordinators.  In  addition,  a  number  of  studies  and  community  surveys  are  being \nundertaken  by  various  stakeholders.  However,  the  collected  information  is  hardly  used  for \nimproving health services, particularly at the local level.  \n \n27. \nRecently  the  Health  Department  has  pilot  tested  a  comprehensive  district  health \ninformation  system  (DHIS),  which  can  generate  information  on  indicators  related  to  service \ndelivery,  human  resources,  financial  management,  logistics,  capital  assets,  and  regulations. \nDHIS  is  gradually  becoming  operational  in  the  pilot  districts.  Districts\u2019  capacity  is  the  major \nconstraint in rapid expansion. The posts for a director at ODGHS for DHIS have only recently \nbeen  filled  and  district  DHIS  related  officers\u2019  posts  have  not  yet  been  filled.  DHIS  will  be  an \nimportant  instrument  for  the  Health  Department  to  monitor  district  health  service  performance \nand adjust its strategies.  \n\n28. \nDrug Procurement. There is a shortage of drugs across primary and secondary health \nfacilities. While inadequate budget allocation is one key reason, cumbersome drug procurement \nprocedures seem to be another major cause. Efficient procurement of drugs is an essential part \nof  the  drug  management  cycle,  and  plays  a  key  role  in  ensuring  cost-effective  and  timely \navailability  of  quality  drugs  and  medicines.  Drug  procurement  absorbs  a  substantial  portion  of \nthe health budget of each facility. For these reasons, good procurement systems are vital\u2014not \njust for health service delivery but also for ensuring efficient use of public funds.  \n\n29. \nIn Punjab, essential drugs are supposed to be provided free at any public facility. After \nthe 2001 devolution, each district government has become responsible for purchasing the drugs \nand medicines in the essential drug list defined at the federal level. After contracts are awarded, \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nthe supplier delivers the drugs to each facility and a sample of each batch is submitted to the \ndrug test laboratory for testing before payment to the supplier can be authorized. \n \n30. \nThe decentralized procedure, however, showed its limitation through large differences in \nprocurement prices across district governments. Therefore, since FY2008, GoPb has introduced \na partial centralization of the procurement process under which the Health Department, through \nits procurement cell, would be responsible for determining the price range on behalf of all district \ngovernments.  However,  the  procurement  cycle  and  awarding  of  contracts  are  protracted.  The \nprocess  only  starts  on  31  August  of  each  fiscal  year,  as  prescribed  by  the  purchase  manual, \nand it is expected to be completed by mid-October. As a result, district governments could start \nprocuring  the  needed  supplies  of  drugs  and  medicines  only  around  October,  sometimes \nextending  to  January  or  February,  leaving  district  governments  to  complete  drug  procurement \nwithin the remaining few months of the fiscal year. Similarly, the drug test laboratory is flooded \nwith  requests  for  drug  testing  just  for  these  few  months.  This  mismatch  between  the  financial \ncycle  of  the  district  governments  and  their  procurement  process  increases  the  risk  of  drug \nshortages in case of delays in the award of the procurement contract.  \n\n31. \nThere is a need to define a uniform and accepted procedure for procurement, streamline \nthe current process and its timing, and ensure that the compiled listings of drugs and supplies \nby each facility are updated and made consistent with both the facility needs and the essential \ndrug list.  \n\n32. \nAlternative  Service  Delivery  Models.  Punjab  has  tried  two  models  of  contracting \nhealth service delivery, one with the Punjab Rural Support Program (PRSP) and the other with \nthe  National  Commission  for  Human  Development  (NCHD).  The  PRSP  has  covered  BHUs  in \n12 districts to date, while NCHD has covered one district and may be expanded to other districts. \nThe PRSP has managed BHUs on behalf of the district governments. It has been given funds \nunder its contract with the districts to operate the BHUs. It also has the authority to hire and fire \nBHU  health  workers.  NCHD  provides  additional  services  specified  in  the  contract  with  the \ndistrict  governments,  including  financial  resources  to  top  up  the  regular  primary  health  care \nbudget. \n\nBoth  the  PRSP  and  NCHD  are  classified  as  government-owned  nongovernment \n33. \norganizations  (NGOs),  associated  with  the  federal  government.  They  operate  as  independent \nentities to execute the health service management contracts. As there are only two at present, \nand  since  the  other  NGOs  are  smaller  and  lack  scale  economies, NCHD  and  the  PRSP  have \nbeen  entrusted  with  most  of  the  BHUs  that  are  contracted  out.  As  a  result,  their  selection  as \ncontractors is not competitive. Some EDOs, Health see their presence as interference. There is \nan opinion that district governments could manage the district health system more efficiently, if \nthe  same  administrative  power  given  to  these  NGOs  is  given  to  EDOs.  As  a  result  of  these \nconcerns, GoPb is planning to improve and institutionalize contracting models in district health \nservice  delivery,  incorporating  lessons  from  a  systematic  third-party  evaluation  of  the  two \nmodels.  \n \n34.   With various vertical programs financed by the federal and provincial governments, and \nthe  NGO-  and  donor-financed  programs  for  MNCH  services,  service  delivery  in  districts  risks \nfragmentation, duplication, and inefficiency in resource use. Although most of the programs at \nleast  keep  EDOs,  Health \nthey  have  separate  management  and  reporting \narrangements.  GoPb  has  been  long  aware  of  the  problems,  and  is  keen  on  functionally \nintegrating primary health services at BHU level. ODGHS has been tasked to conceptualize and \noversee the integration process.   \n\ninformed, \n\n \n\n\f3. \n\nNeed for Greater and Rationally Allocated Financial Resources and \nEffective Resource Management \n\n35. \nUnder-Financing  at  the  National  Level.  Public  health  care  is  financed  through \nbudgetary allocations from three different levels of government: federal, provincial, and district. \nPakistan\u2019s  public  health  care  has  been  persistently  underfinanced.  Its  total  health  care \nexpenditure in 2004 was only 2.2% of GDP, more than 80% of which was private expenditure. \nPer capita government expenditure on health was only $9.4, against a benchmark of about $30 \nrecommended  by  the  World  Health  Organization  for  developing  countries.  It  also  compares \nunfavorably  with  neighboring  countries  such  as  Sri  Lanka  ($74.1),  Nepal  ($18.6),  Bangladesh \n($18.1), and India ($15.8).  \n\nThe increase in district governments\u2019 spending responsibilities has not been matched by \n36. \nconcurrent revenue autonomy necessary to fulfill this new role. District governments depend on \nthe  provincial  fiscal  transfers  for  a  large  part  of  their  revenues  through  Provincial  Finance \nCommission  (PFC)  awards.  District  governments  typically  spend  less  than  $2  per  capita  on \nhealth  care,  severely  under-financing  primary  and  secondary  health  care.  This  has  led  to \nshortage  of  drugs  and  medical  supplies  across  health  facilities.  For  FY2003\u2013FY2007,  total \nhealth sector expenditure accounted for 6%\u201313% of district governments\u2019 total regular budget. \nThe health sector\u2019s share in district governments\u2019 recurrent budget ranges from 7%\u201319%, and \n0%\u20137% in the development budget depending on the district. Salaries account for about 60% of \ntotal  health  expenditures.  The  HSRP  and  the  tied  grants  received  under  the  ADB-supported \nPDSSP are sometimes the sole sources of funding for health sector development  schemes in \nsome districts. Under the PDSSP, conditional grants are being provided to district governments \nand  the  tehsil  municipal  administration  to  achieve  progress  toward  MDGs  related  to  poverty, \ngender, education, health, and water supply and sanitation. The grants are transferred as part of \nthe PFC award. Seventy percent of the grant is transferred based on population and 30% based \non  the  development  deprivation  index  calculated  based  on  the  Multiple  Indicators  Cluster \nSurvey  data.  A  memorandum  of  understanding  (MOU)  between  GoPb  and  each  local \ngovernment sets the rules and conditions of the grants. The MOU defines the specific eligibility \ncriteria  and  access  criteria  each  local  government  has  to  meet  to  receive  the  grants.  It  also \nestablishes  criteria  for  the  use  of  funds,  including  the  request  that  funds  be  kept  in  a  civil \naccount  and  that  such  account  and  related  financial  statements  be  audited  annually  by  the \nDistrict Audit Office of the Auditor General of Pakistan.  \n \n37. \nUnder-Financing in Punjab. GoPb has substantially increased the budget allocation for \nhealth in recent years. Still, in FY2007, GoPb\u2019s total health care spending was PRs23.5 billion, \nor  $4.4  per  capita,  which  is  less  than  half  of  the  national  per  capita  spending.  Overall,  total \nhealth  public  spending,  including  spending  at  district  level,  has  accounted  for  only  7%\u20138%  of \ntotal  spending,  and  since  FY2005  the  majority  of  funds  is  being  allocated  to  recurrent \nexpenditures. \n\n38. \nPrimary and secondary health care has proven to be more pro-poor than tertiary health \ncare. Yet, allocation of GoPb\u2019s health budget in the past used to be heavily tilted toward tertiary \nhealth  care.  With  the  introduction  of  the  HSRP,  however,  45%  of  the  Health  Department\u2019s \nannual  development  program  was  allocated  to  primary  and  secondary  health  services  in \nFY2008. Reforms in this direction need to be sustained through the PMDGP.   \n\nInadequate Budget Planning and Execution. Any budget increases have to be based \n39. \non  sound  rationale  and  priorities  set  out  by  the  prevailing  health  policy.  Now  that  GoPb  has \ndeveloped and committed itself to attaining MSDS, which define the necessary inputs (physical \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\ninvestment  and  human  resource  needs)  for  primary  and  secondary  health  services,  GoPb \nshould be able to prepare medium-term budget for these levels. However, a series of structural \nconstraints prevent rational budget formulation and execution. The Medium-Term Development \nFramework  shows  little  consistency  in  the  projections  from  one  year  to  the  next  and  there  is \nample  variation  in  allocations  to  major  programs  in  the  health  sector  annual  development \nprogram. This points to poor planning of the financing needs and low predictability of financial \nallocations. \n \nThe planning and budget preparation processes, both at the provincial and district levels, \n40. \nshare common limitations. The recurrent and the development budget process are two separate \nexercises,  with  insufficient  consideration  of  the  links  between  the  two.  The  incremental \napproach  to  budget  preparation  perpetuates  inefficiencies  and  imbalances  in  inputs  and \nresource  allocation  decisions.  Since  budget  preparation  remains  at  the  lower  levels  of  the \ndepartment  or  district  officers,  there  is  a  risk  that  the  sight  of  goals  and  objectives  for  the \ndepartment  or  district  governments  can  be  lost  with  incremental  budgeting.  Performance \nmeasurement,  both  physical  and  financial,  is  hampered  by  the  lack  of  an  integrated  and \ninformed budget statement about recurrent and development activities, and by the split between \nthe  various  development  initiatives.  The  district  governments\u2019  allocation  of  resources  among \ncompeting demands is often driven by political choices. \n \n41.  Weak  Financial  Reporting.  The  state  government\u2019s  financial  reporting  does  not \nconform to best practices. Budget execution and expenditure statements do not allow drawing \nreliable, homogenous, and reconciled information at any level. Severe weaknesses also exist at \nthe  district  governments.  The  EDO,  Health  does  not  receive  regular  financial  statements  on \nbudget utilization from the health facilities under its jurisdiction. As a result, the EDO does not \nhave a holistic picture of the use of resources in his district, and cannot measure performance \nagainst  planned  targets.  Therefore,  in  spite  of  being  the  officer  in  charge  of  health  service \ndelivery  across  the  district,  the  EDO  is  unable  to  manage  programs  effectively  and  hold  staff \nand facilities responsible for delivery of services. Weak financial reporting undermines resource \nallocation decisions at the time budget estimates are prepared or revised, and prevents rational \nscrutiny of resources utilized in service delivery. \n \nAt  the  provincial  level,  there  is  a  similar  absence  of  consolidated  financial  reporting \n42. \nshowing  budget  execution  for  the  various  provincial  level  programs  and  sections  in  the \nsecretariat as well as for the district governments. The reliance on prior control for each item of \nexpenditure  does  not  ensure  proper  budgetary  control  as  this  would  involve  monitoring  the \nperformance  of  a  unit  or  entity,  including  financial  performance,  and  taking  corrective  action \nwhere  necessary.  Dual  budgeting  also  restricts  the  scope  for  comprehensive  analysis  of \ngovernment operations and evaluation of their performance. Like the EDO, Health, the secretary \nof health\u2014as the principal accounting officer for the Health Department\u2014has limited access to \nconsolidated  financial  information  to  enable  proper  scrutiny  of  the  performance  of  subordinate \nofficers, facilities, or spending units, let alone having an overview of overall resource allocation \nand financial performance in the public health sector. \n \n43.  Weak  Fiduciary  Environment.  An  organization\u2019s  internal control  system  is  defined  as \nthe whole network of systems established to provide reasonable assurance that objectives will \nbe  achieved  in  an  efficient  and  economic  manner;  and  that  policies,  procedures,  laws,  and \nregulations  are  complied  with.  A  well-structured  and  executed  internal  control  system  ensures \nthe integrity and reliability of information, accounts, and data; and provides assurance that the \ninstitutions\u2019 assets and interests are protected from losses. The role of internal audit, in turn, is \nbased on the presence of an adequate, effective, and reliable set of internal controls. Any audit \n\n \n\n\fwill need to begin by assessing the controls in place and indicating where the controls are failing \nor are inadequate. \n \n44. \nIn Punjab, the manual of financial rules and regulations, the purchase manual, and other \ndocuments  and  handbooks  define  the  set  of  internal  controls  at  provincial  and  district  levels. \nThese consist mainly of ex-ante controls on all non-salary expenditures, ultimately enforced by \nthe district account officer at the district level and Accountant General\u2019s Office at the provincial \nlevel.  This  effectively  limits  commitments  to  cash  availability  and  approved  budget  allocations, \nand  is  effective  in  controlling  expenditures.  However,  as  the  recent  assessment15 noted,  while \nthe  rules  are  widely  understood,  in  some  cases  they  may  be  excessive,  cause  unnecessary \ndelays, and are generally not adhered to effectively. \n \nPunjab\u2019s internal audit function is not effective. Although a number of  key departments \n45. \nhave some form of internal audit functions, these are not focused on systems, the reporting is \nirregular, and not all recommendations are acted upon. In district governments, the appointment \nof  internal  audit  staff  by  district  nazims  (mayors)  has  generally  not  taken  place.  In  the  Health \nDepartment, the internal audit function has weakened substantially and is being used in an ad \nhoc  manner  since  devolution.  Its  role  and  direction  are  unclear  and  its  reporting  line  is  to  the \nadditional secretary for establishment rather than to the secretary, as it should be given that the \nlatter is the principal accounts officer of the Health Department. The audit wing does not have \nany  systematic  approach  to  audit  planning,  or  formal  processes  for  reporting  to  senior \nmanagement or an audit committee, which would approve the audit plan, review audit reports, \nand ensure follow-up actions. Within the Health Department, there is a clear misconception that \nthe function of the internal audit wing is limited to supporting the department in addressing the \naudit observations raised by the external audit.  \n\n46. \nAlternative  Health  Financing  and  Provider  Payment.  While  the  increase  in  budget \nallocation for public health services to implement MSDS is the most urgent need and will be a \nkey  focus  of  the  government  policy  for  the  next  few  years,  GoPb  is  also  concerned  about  the \nlong-term  sustainability  and  equity  of  health  care  financing  and  provider  payment  system. \nContinuation  of  the  present  budget-supported  public  health  provisions  may  be  an  option,  if \nadjusted to emerging issues; clearly, this will be inadequate. As the GoPb successfully improves \npublic  health  services,  not  only  the  relative  poor,  but  also  wealthier  people,  may  start  using \npublic health services heavily. Then, the present model of basically universal free public health \ncare  may  disproportionately  subsidize  wealthier  people,  without  a  progressive  tax  scheme  in \nplace,  and  lead  to  a  distorted  and  highly  unsustainable  system.  To  develop  an  equitable  and \nsustainable  health  financing  system,  an  in-depth  assessment,  especially  of  out-of-pocket \nexpenditure,  is  required.  Until  a  holistic  equitable  health  financing  system  is  developed, \nimmediate safety net measures for reducing the poor\u2019s health expenditure burden are needed. \n\nPublic health care is in principle free, except ticket charges ranging from PRe1 to PRs7, \n47. \nand user charges for selected diagnostic tests. The user charge system, however, is in a state \nof confusion. Best practice dictates that the resources generated from user charges be kept at \nthe facility level, or at least used for sector financing needs. However, Punjab\u2019s system requires \nthe user charges to be deposited to the provincial general account. The practice widely varies \nacross  the  province.  Some  district  governments  deposit  them  in  their  own  district  accounts, \nsometimes with part of the collected user charges shared with the health staff, while most do not \naccount  for  them  properly.  In  either  case,  the  user  charges  were  not  retained  in  the  health \n\n                                                 \n15 GoPb, ADB, the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom, European Commission, and the \n\nWorld Bank. 2007.

At  the  outset,  the  user  charges  themselves  vary  across  districts, \nwhile  they  were  regulated  by  the  Health  Department  prior  to  the  2001  devolution.  The  user \ncharge  system  needs  to  be  reviewed,  rationalized,  and  overhauled  thoroughly  to  keep  the \ncharges at the health facilities, or at least in the health sector, to mitigate the problem of gross \nunder-financing of the sector.  \n \n48. \nPatients  often  incur  additional  out-of-pocket  expenditures  visiting  public  health  facilities \nbecause medicines and medical supplies required for treatments are often missing and have to \nbe  purchased  from  the  market  by  the  patients  themselves.  As  a  result,  childbirth  at  a  public \nhealth  facility  may  cost  PRs300\u2013PRs5,000  depending  on  the  case.  Out-of-pocket  health  care \nexpenditures  often  severely  affect  the  poor.  There  is  some  assistance  for  the  poor,  mainly \nfinanced by schemes such as the Zakat Fund (Islamic charity) and Baitulmaal. The Zakat Fund \ngives  funds  to  hospitals,  which  in  turn  support  poor  patients.  Baitulmaal  reimburses  claims  to \nthose who have applied for assistance and are found to be eligible. Medical superintendents of \npublic  hospitals  also  have  discretionary  power  to  exempt  up  to  25%  of  the  patients  from  user \ncharges. Both Zakat and Baitulmaal are thinly spread over many categories of assistance, and \napplication  procedures  are  cumbersome.  The  negative  connotation  associated  with  Zakat \nsupport receivers often discourages people from applying. To address these deficiencies in the \nexisting  programs,  GoPb  is  reviewing  different  possibilities  of  programs  targeted  at  the  poor. \nOne  of  them  is  health  cards  targeted  at  poor  pregnant  women  and  children,  who  will  be \nexempted from health care expenditure up to a certain ceiling.  \n \nC. \n\nADB Strategy \n\nADB  committed  itself  to  supporting  the  attainment  of  MDGs  in  2002.  Strategy  2020 \n49. \nreinforces  that  commitment.  A  key  premise  of  Strategy  2020  is  inclusive  economic  growth.  It \nencourages  the  region  to  \u201cpromote  greater  access  to  opportunities  by  expanding  human \ncapacities, especially for the disadvantaged, through investments in education, health and basic \nsocial protections.\u201d In terms of the health sector, Strategy 2020 identifies strengthening of public \nexpenditure management for cost-effective delivery of health programs and services as an area \nof  ADB\u2019s  comparative  advantage.  In  that  regard,  ADB\u2019s  1999  health  sector  policy  remains \nrelevant.16 The policy stresses the need for ensuring access of the poor, women, and children to \ncost-effective preventive, promotive, and curative health services. ADB\u2019s possible roles include \nhelping  developing  member  countries  to  strengthen  their  public  sector  management  capacity, \ndiversify health care financing sources, and adopt innovative approaches and technologies. In \nline  with  Strategy  2020,  the  proposed  PMDGP  will  focus  on  enhancing  access,  particularly  of \nthe poor, to health services.    \n \nD. \n\nCoordination with Other Projects and Programs  \n\nThe  design  of  the  PMDGP  is  based  on  an  evidence-based,  technical  approach  for \n50. \nimproving  women\u2019s  and  children\u2019s  health.  The  MSDS  were  developed  based  on  the  World \nHealth  Organization  standards  and  other  specialist  technical  agencies.  The  nature  and  mix  of \ntechnical  inputs  needed  to  provide  MSDS  are  well-known  and  technically  feasible,  even  in \nchallenging  environments.  When  provided  at  sufficient  scale  and  coverage,  international \nexperience  shows  this  approach  can  rapidly  improve  health  outcomes.  More  specifically,  the \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) pilots of some of the key MSDS in three districts of \nPunjab  have  shown  significant  improvements  in  access  and  outcomes.  The  PMDGP  thus \nprovides a good illustration of complementarity and partnership\u2014WHO and UNICEF identifying \n\n                                                 \n16 ADB. 1999.

ADB  is  also \nproviding  policy  and  technical  input  on  public  expenditure  management  and  more  rational \nallocation of resources, which complements the advice of technical agencies such as WHO and \nUNICEF. \n\n51. \nPMDGP  has  been  designed  in  coordination  with  ADB-financed  provincial  government \nprograms\u2014PDSSP,  PRMP  and  PGEIP\u2014and  the  MNCH  Program  financed  by  the  federal \ngovernment. Both the PRMP and PDSSP have received significant cofinancing support from the \nDepartment  for  International  Development  (DFID)  of  the  United  Kingdom.  The  PDSSP  has \nintroduced  the  district  sector  planning  system  and  developed  minimum  service  delivery \nstandards for the devolved social services including health, education, and water and sanitation \nservices.  The  PRMP  has  helped  mostly  at  the  provincial  level  to  improve  efficiency  of  service \ndelivery,  while  the  PGEIP  is  deepening  reforms  started  under  the  PRMP.  One  of  the  most \nimportant contributions of the PRMP is the development of the health sector reform framework \nthat is the launching pad of the HSRP. The PMDGP constitutes an important part of the health \nsector  reform  initiatives  started  under  the  HSRP,  and  implementation  of  the  health  MSDS \ndeveloped  by  the  PDSSP  is  a  core  objective  of  the  PMDGP.  The  development  partners\u2019 \ncoordination matrix is in Appendix 5. \n\nE. \n\nLessons \n\n52. \nThree  generic  pointers  from  past  program  and  projects  operations  are  relevant  to  this \nProgram:  (i)  government  ownership  is  crucial;  (ii)  programs  and  projects  often  fail  because  of \ntheir complexity compared to the capacity of the executing agencies; and (iii) policy matrices are \nfrequently  long,  with  many  conditions,  but  tend  to  lack  linkages  between  conditions  and \nexpected  impacts. 17  The  social  action  program,  which  helped  the  Government  put  long-\nneglected primary health services on its political agenda, also revealed that the performance of \nPakistan\u2019s  public  social  sector  strongly  depended  on  political  will,  governance,  and  funding, \nrather  than  technical  issues.  The  program\u2019s  experience  also  warns  against  multisector,  multi-\nprovincial  programs,  and  urges  for  capacity  building.  Specific  to  Pakistan,  the  recent  country \nassistance  program  evaluation  presented  similar \nthat  ADB\u2019s \nimplementation  capacity  has  to  be  strengthened,  especially  by  increasing  human  resource \nallocations  in  the  resident  mission.18 The  PMDGP  design  reflects  these  lessons.  First,  it  is  a \nsingle-province, single-sector program. It has been built on the state government\u2019s health sector \nreform programs, especially to address the priority actions recommended by the health working \ngroup  constituted  by  the  chief  minister  in  April  2008.  The  weak  planning,  budgeting,  and \nimplementation  capacity  (especially  in  district  governments)  is  a  major  bottleneck.  To  address \nthis,  a  team  of  experts  will  be  placed  in  the  Health  Department  exclusively  tasked  to  capacity \nbuilding  for  district  governments.  The  proposed  policy  conditions  are  directly  linked  to \nimplementation of the MSDS, which directly contributes to the program goals. Pakistan Resident \nMission\u2019s  capacity  has  been  built  up  in  public  resource  management  in  general,  which \nencompasses social service delivery.  \n\nlessons,  and  suggested \n\nThe  project  completion  report  for  the  Women\u2019s  Health  Project 19  suggested  that \n53. \nimproving  human  resources,  increasing  health  sector  financing,  and  strengthening  districts\u2019 \nhealth  management  capacity  are  required.  The  PMDGP  emphasizes  these  three  aspects \naccordingly.  Review  of  previous  health  sector  projects  in  Pakistan  also  suggests  that  delay  in \n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2001.

The  capacity  of  the \nexecuting  agency  was  also  a  concern  in  some  projects  and  programs.  The  Program  is \naddressing  this  by  establishing  a  strategy  and  planning  cell  and  a  financial  management  cell \n(FMC)  in  the  Health  Department,  and  a  team  of  experts  exclusively  tasked  to  do  capacity \nbuilding for the district governments.   \n\nimplementation.  The  proposed  Program  will  avoid \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n54. \n The  impact  of  the  PMDGP  will  be  attainment  of  the  MDGs  of  reducing  the  IMR  and \nMMR in Punjab. The Program\u2019s outcome will be improved access to, and quality and equity of, \nhealth  services.  The  delivery  of  the  minimum  package  of  services  stipulated  in  the  MSDS, \nespecially  in  MNCH,  is  the  core  strategy  for  attaining  the  MDGs.  Therefore,  the  Program \nfocuses on reforms required for effective implementation of the MSDS. The Program will assist \nthe  GoPb  in  undertaking  health  sector  reforms  to  (i)  improve  the  availability  and  quality  of \nprimary  and  secondary  health  services;  (ii) manage  health  service  delivery  better;  and \n(iii) develop  a  sustainable  and  pro-poor  health  care  financing  system.  The  development  policy \nletter  is  in  Appendix  6.  A  policy  matrix  for  subprogram  1  and  tentative  policy  actions  for \nsubsequent subprograms is in Appendix 7.   \n\nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n1. \n\nImproving the Availability and Quality of Primary and Secondary Health \nServices \n\n55. \n Key actions in this reform area are to introduce institutional arrangements and provide \nadequate  and  skilled  human  resource  inputs  required  for  effectively  delivering  the  minimum \npackage of MNCH-related services stipulated in the MSDS. \n \n56. \nPolicy Objective 1-1: MSDS Introduced to Primary and Secondary Health Services. \nThis  policy  objective  aims  to  introduce  public  services  standards,  which  should  be  eventually \nobserved  by  private  practitioners.  The  MSDS  define  a  set  of  services  to  be  available  at  each \nhealth facility, and coverage targets for each service. GoPb has decided that MSDS should be \nenforced  in  phases,  with  the  first  phase  comprising  MNCH-related  standards  (Appendix  8). \nDuring  subprogram  1,  all  districts  will  have  agreed  to  reach  the  minimum  acceptable  levels  of \nMSDS by 2012, by signing MOUs with the GoPb. The MOU clearly specifies the responsibilities \nof  both  provincial  and  district  governments.  At  least  seven  districts  are  expected  to  achieve \nMNCH-related MSDS in 2009, and a total of 15 in 2010, with others complying prior by 2012. \n\n57.  MSDS  implementation  guidelines  that  spell  out  technical  and  financial  resources \navailable  for  district  governments  and  steps  for  planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring  are \nprepared by GoPb in consultation with district governments. ODGHS helps district governments \nimprove  their  MSDS  implementation  plan,  by  providing  TA.  Under  subprogram  2,  a  plan  for \nachieving  MSDS  will  be  included  in  the  districts\u2019  3-year  rolling  plans,  which  have  been \nintroduced  under  the  PDSSP.  The  planning  format  will  be  improved  to  cover  the  MSDS \nimplementation  plan,  including  the  situation  analysis,  problem  identification,  and  strategic \n\n \n\n\fpriority  actions  required  for  attaining  MSDS,  and  a  detailed  financing  plan  for  the  necessary \nactions. 20 The various sources of funds will be integrated into a comprehensive financing plan. \nAs the MSDS have defined the services that the public are entitled to, it is important to ensure \nthat the public is aware of the MSDS. Further, the public have an important role in making the \nhealth  system  accountable.  District  governments  will  disseminate  MSDS  to  health  facilities, \nhealth  workers,  and  communities  during  subprogram  2  and  onward  through  various  media. \nDuring subprogram 3, performance of the health sector, especially the district health system, will \nbe  evaluated  through  a  third-party  assessment  of  its  progress  toward  attaining  MSDS  and  a \ncitizen satisfaction survey.  \n\n58. \nPolicy  Objective  1-2:  Primary  and  Secondary  Health  Services  Fully  Staffed  and \nEquipped according to MSDS. To improve access to MNCH services quickly, GoPb will recruit \nabout  360  additional  lady  health  visitors  under  subprogram  1  to  fill  at  least  90%  of  the  400 \nvacant posts. GoPb will also create about 2,500 additional posts for midwives at BHUs, and 150 \nposts for gynecologists at THQs and DHQs under subprogram 1, in accordance with the MSDS. \nUnder  subprogram  2,  GoPb  will  create  an  additional  2,500  posts  of  lady  health  visitors,  and \nabout  4,000  posts  of  nurses.  By  subprogram  2,  it  is  expected  that  95%  of  BHUs  will  have  a \nWMO or alternative arrangement for providing access to competent female staff in the MNCH, \nand 80% of all primary and secondary health facilities will be fully equipped and staffed. During \nsubprogram 3, 100% of primary and secondary health facilities will be fully equipped and staffed. \n\n59. \nGoPb  will  use  part  of  the  program  assistance  to  provide  district  governments  with \nsupplementary  funds  through  conditional  grants  to  implement  the  MSDS,  as  explained  under \npolicy  objective  3,  and  otherwise  use  the  program  funds  to  support  the  additional  posts  for \nhealth  staff  and  equipment  according  to  MSDS  requirements.  GoPb  will  also  strengthen \nODGHS to support district governments in MSDS and other priority areas as agreed with district \ngovernments under policy objective 2.  \n \nPolicy Objective 1-3:  Measures Adopted to Improve Quality of Health Workers and \n60. \ntheir Practices. The Health Department has recognized that the quality of health workers is the \nmost  critical  determinant  of  the  quality  of  health  services;  and  that  the  paramedics,  nurses, \nmidwives,  and  lady  health  visitors  play  an  important  role  in  health  service  delivery.  GoPb \ncommits  to  developing  a  comprehensive  health  human  resource  plan  that  will  cover  improved \nservice  structures,  registration  and  examination  systems,  personnel  management  (including \nrotation  of  staff  in  rural  areas  and  linking  promotion  to  rural  placement),  and  quality \nimprovement  of  both  pre-  and  in-service  training.  GoPb  pays  special  attention  to  paramedics\u2019 \nquality,  which  has  been  long-neglected.  While  GoPb  is  in  control  of  paramedics\u2019  training,  to \nimprove  the  quality  of  nurses  and  medical  doctors,  GoPb  will  have  to  closely  work  with  the \nPakistan Nursing Council, and Pakistan Medical and Dental Council.   \n\nImproving the quality of health workers\u2019 services requires a range of actions. Poor quality \n61. \nof  teaching  has  a  long-term  impact  on  the  performance  of  the  health  system.  Improving  the \nquality  of  nurses,  lady  health  visitors,  midwives,  and  dispensers  requires  urgent  upgrading  of \ntraining  institutes.  This  will  be  initiated  under  subprogram  1  by  developing  a  conceptual \nframework for upgrading training institutes urgently. At least 50% of the training institutions will \nbe upgraded under subprogram 2, and all training institutions will be upgraded by subprogram 3. \nBoth  short-  and  medium-term  actions  will  be  taken  for  improving  the  quality  of  teaching. \nMoreover,  for  paramedics,  the  accreditation  system  needs  to  be  upgraded.

Punjab  Devolved  Social  Services  Program:  Guidelines  for  Development  of  Three-Year  Rolling  Plan \n\nfor Health\u20142009\u20132011. Lahore. \n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nFaculty  is  the  examining  and  licensing  body  for  paramedics,  and  accredits  public  and  private \nparamedical training institutes. However, Punjab Medical Faculty\u2019s limited capacity is regarded \nas  a  bottleneck  for  ensuring  quality  of  paramedics.  Under  subprogram  1,  a  new  service \nstructure and regulatory framework for paramedics has been drafted, to be implemented under \nsubprograms 2 and 3. Neither medical doctors nor paramedics have a systematic opportunity or \nincentive  to  update  their  knowledge.  During  subprogram  2,  a  continuing  education  system  for \nthem will be developed, linked to promotion and/or relicensing.    \n\nA comprehensive health human resources plan will be developed and approved during \n62. \nsubprogram  2.  The  plan  should  address  both  the  quality  and  quantity  of  health  sector  human \nresources,  incentives  for  filling  vacancies,  rationalization  of  the  service  structure,  and \ncomputerized registration of health workers.  \n \n63. \nUnder subprogram 1, the Health Department has approved SMPs, SOPs, and a protocol \nfor referral services, to be implemented under subprograms 2 and 3. Health workers need to be \ntrained  on  the  new  SMPs  as  soon  as  possible  to  keep  up  with  the  emerging  requirements. \nTherefore, during subprogram 1, the training plan has been developed for MNCH-related health \nworkers  on  SMP,  the  referral  protocols,  and  SOPs.  During  subprogram  2,  SMP,  the  referral \nprotocols,  and  SOP  training  for  MNCH-related  workers  should  be  completed.  During \nsubprogram  3,  all  other  health  workers  will  be  trained.  Simultaneously,  more  systematic \nmeasures  for  regularly  updating  health  workers\u2019  knowledge  and  skills  will  be  developed  and \nimplemented during subprograms 2 and 3. Continued education systems for both doctors and \nparamedics will be established and linked to their promotion or licensing. \n\nPolicy  Objective  1-4:  MSDS  Introduced  to  the  Private  Sector.  In  Punjab,  private \n64. \nhealth  services  are  not  subject  to  any  quality  standards  and  the  quality  of  their  services  is \nquestionable.  Prior  to  engaging  private  practitioners  in  quality  assurance  activities,  there  is  a \nneed  for  understanding  the  situation  of  both  qualified  and  unqualified  private  practitioners  in \nPunjab.  The  Health  Department  plans  to  take  stock  of  private  health  service  providers  and \nanalyze  their  locations,  categories,  and  qualifications,  as  the  first  step  during  subprogram  1. \nOver  subprograms  2  and  3,  additional  districts  are  expected  to  reach  the  minimum  level  of \nacceptance for the core MNCH-related MSDS  gradually. During subprogram 3, MSDS, SOPs, \nand SMPs will be introduced to private sector practitioners.  \n \n\n2. \n\nStrengthening the Management of Health Service Delivery \n\nThis  reform  area  will  aim  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  daily  management  of  health \n65. \nservice  delivery  with  an  initial  focus  on  MNCH,  by  improving  district  health  management  and \nmonitoring,  resource  management,  and  developing  alternative  models  of  health  care  delivery. \nThe ODGHS plays an important role in ensuring district governments\u2019 satisfactory performance \nthrough their performance and providing TA.   \n\n66. \nPolicy Objective 2-1: Improved Management and Performance Monitoring. ODGHS \nneeds  to  be  restructured  and  strengthened  to  support  the  district  governments  effectively  in \nimproving  strategic  planning,  especially  for  implementing  and  attaining  MSDS,  and  day-to-day \nmanagement  and  monitoring  of  the  district  health  system.  One  of  the  most  critical  areas  that \nrequire  improvement  is  the  M&E  system.  Regular  M&E  of  performance  of  the  district  health \nsystem  and  feedback  to  district  governments  on  their  health  service  will  introduce  more \noutcome-based service delivery.  \n \n\n \n\n\fDuring  subprogram  1,  ODGHS  will  have  been  reorganized and  strengthened  to  be  the \n67. \nmain  source  of  TA,  and  reliable  and  comprehensive  health  information.  It  will  analyze  the \nperformance  of  the  district  health  system,  especially  in  view  of  MSDS,  and  regularly  publish \nreports  on  the  district\u2019s  health  situation  and  district  governments\u2019  performance.  Further,  a \ncapacity  development  plan  for  the  district  health  management  team  will  also  have  been \ndeveloped  (Appendix  9).  Based  on  monitoring  of  the  district  governments\u2019  progress  in \nimplementing  MSDS,  ODGHS  will  recast  each  district  government\u2019s  capacity  and  adjust  the \ncapacity development and provide TA for each district government accordingly.  \n\n68. \nTo improve performance monitoring, under subprogram 1 an M&E policy framework will \nhave  been  developed.  The  framework  should  clearly  highlight  the  scope  and  emphasize \nharmonization  of  various  sources  of  information,  the  frequency  of  health  information,  and  the \nuse  of  such  information  for  decision  making.  The  DHIS  should  be  introduced  in  10  districts \nduring subprogram 1, and rolled out to all the 35 districts during subprogram 2. Technical inputs \nshould  be  provided  to  district  governments  by  ODGHS  to  enable  them  to  use  the  information \ncontent of the DHIS effectively and produce quarterly reports.  \n\n69. \nPolicy  Objective  2-2:  Improved  Efficiency  of  Drug  and  Supply  Procurement.  The \nprocurement of drugs and medicines is an essential component of the quality of health service \ndelivery. At present, the system of procuring drugs and medicines by the district governments is \nin a state of flux. Under subprogram 1, the Health Department has conducted a comprehensive \nreview  of  drug,  equipment  and  supply  management  systems  in  consultation  with  district \ngovernments;  and  identified  different  options  for  improving  the  procurement  system  in  its \nefficiency,  cost-effectiveness,  and  transparency.  During  subprogram  2,  the  Health  Department \nwill clarify its own responsibilities as well as those of the district governments in the process of \nprocurement of drugs, equipment, and supplies by issuing sector-specific guidelines based on \nthe  comprehensive  review.  Improvements  in  the  procurement  process  have  to  be  further \nsupported  by  the  introduction  of  a  comprehensive  monitoring  mechanism  of  the  availability  of \ndrugs,  equipment,  and  supplies  at  each  health  facility  by  subprogram  2.  All  primary  and \nsecondary  health  facilities  should  have  regular  supply  of  appropriate  essential  drugs  by \nsubprogram  2.  Information  on  drug  availability  is  included  in  the  DHIS.  Moreover,  the  EDO, \nHealth will be responsible for submitting periodic reports to the Health Department on utilization \nof the procurement budget and of drugs and medicines to support future rounds of procurement. \nDuring  subprogram  3,  the  Health  Department\u2019s  procurement  system  will  be  further  improved \nthrough adoption of health technology assessment tools.  \n \nPolicy Objective 2-3: Alternative Models of Health Service Delivery Examined and \n70. \nInstitutionalized.  Contracting  of  health  services,  or  health  service  management,  could  help \nimprove the effectiveness and efficiency of health service delivery, as shown in other countries. \nPunjab has in the past tried two models of contracting, one with the PRSP and the other with \nNCHD (discussed in para. 32). GoPb wants to determine whether or not the contracting model \nhas  produced  better  health  outcomes  and/or  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  health  services  in \nthe districts compared to those that did not contract services, and if yes, what kind of contracting \nmodel  is  suitable  for  Punjab.  Therefore,  during  subprogram  1,  GoPb  has  started  a  third-party \nevaluation  of  the  PRSP  and  NCHD  models.  During  subprogram  2,  based  on  the  evaluation \nresults,  the  GoPb  will  determine  a  suitable  model  of  contracting,  and  encourage  district \ngovernments  to  contract  entire  or  part  of  health  services,  according  to  their  needs.  GoPb  has \nfinalized the concept on the functional integration of various health services financed by different \ntiers of the government at BHUs for their better coordination and efficiency during subprogram 1, \nand pilot test the model during subprogram 2. Based on the results of the pilot test, the concept \nwill be adjusted and expanded to all districts during subprogram 3.  \n\n18 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\n3. \n\nEstablishing Sustainable Pro-Poor Health Financing Arrangements  \n\n71. \nPublic  health  care  has  been  underfinanced  in  Punjab.  GoPb  should  substantially \nincrease the health care budget to be able to finance the minimum package of health services, \nand simultaneously improve the targeting of public health financing and efficiency of funds. This \nreform area addresses the need for pro-poor health care financing and improving the efficiency \nof limited resources. \n \nPolicy  Objective  3-1:  Greater  Provision  and  More  Rational  Budget  Allocation  for \n72. \nthe  Health  Sector,  especially  for  Primary  and  Secondary  Health  Services.  Attaining  the \nMDGs  relating  to  the  IMR  and  MMR  requires  a  substantial  increase  in  public  health \nexpenditures.  It  is  equally  important  that  the  increased  public  resources  are  allocated  more \nrationally to those key gaps and bottlenecks in the system. This requires effective medium-term \nstrategic  planning  at  both  district  government  and  Health  Department  levels,  especially  to \nensure  that  the  MNCH-related  MSDS  are  met.  The  capacity  for  such  planning  is  very  limited \nwithin the health sector in Punjab. Therefore, reforms in planning and budgeting are prioritized \nduring  subprogram  1  to  develop  an  action  plan  that  prioritizes  the  implementation  of  MNCH-\nrelated MSDS and seek budgets according to the plan. \n \n73. \nUnder subprogram 1, the Health Department will ensure that the strategy and policy unit \nset  up  under  the  PGEIP  will  be  fully  staffed  and  its  capacity  built  to  provide  policy  directions. \nA comprehensive  policy  framework  will  also  be  defined  for  the  health  sector.  In  addition,  a \nmedium-term  financing  plan  that  clearly  includes  the  cost  of  ensuring  compliance  with  the \nMSDS  will  be  developed.  This  will  represent  the  starting  point  for  development  of  a  more \ncomprehensive medium-term expenditure framework for the health sector under subprogram 2. \nGoPb has increased actual spending in the health sector during FY2009 by 15% in accordance \nwith the MTEF projection. \n\nThe low revenue autonomy of district governments suggests that any additional funding \n74. \nneeds arising from MSDS implementation will have to be met by increased provincial transfers. \nAlthough  the  non-matching,  non-conditional  structure  of  the  PFC  award  promotes  district \ngovernments\u2019 ability to allocate resources autonomously, there is no way to ensure that districts\u2019 \nspending  decisions  target  provincial  policy  priorities. 21  Therefore,  under  subprogram  1,  the \nFinance  Department  and  the  Health  Department  will  have  devised  a  conditional  grant \nmechanism,22 and will channel an additional PRs3.5 billion to district governments through the \nmechanism  earmarked  for  implementing  the  MNCH-related  MSDS  and  selected  health \ninterventions for FY2009.  \n \n75. \nThe conditional grant mechanism will be regulated by a set of conditions divided into two \ncategories: (i) minimum conditions, which will define the eligibility of each district government to \nenter the scheme and receive a base allocation; and (ii) a set of performance indicators, which \nwill  entitle  district  governments  to  an  additional  allocation  based  on  their  ability  to  meet  each \nperformance  indicator.  Fifty  percent  of  the  total  pool  of  resources  will  be  set  aside  as  a  base \nallocation  and  the  remaining  half  will  be  allocated  on  the  basis  of  the  performance  indicators. \nThe base allocation will be distributed among districts in accordance with a formula that takes \n\n \n\n                                                 \n21 The PFC award was introduced by the PLGO and is the main tool of fiscal equalization in Pakistan. The Provincial \nFinance Commission is the entity in charge of defining the formula for allocation of the provincial allocable amount \namong district governments. Each award has a validity of 3 years, and in Punjab the first award has covered the \nperiod up to FY2009.  \n\n22 The PLGO establishes that conditional  grants can be given to the  district governments. The amount is based on \n\nconditions agreed between the provincial and district governments under the Program. \n\n \n\n\finto  account  their  development  needs  (poverty  incidence  and  health  indicators)  and  size.  The \nperformance component will kick in from FY2010  onwards. Ten percent of the base allocation \nwill  have  to  be  used  for  capacity-building  purposes.  The  minimum  conditions  should  include \n(i) preparation of a quality health sector plan, including a budgeted action plan for implementing \nthe  MNCH-related  MSDS;  (ii)  evidence  of  the  district  government\u2019s  actual  health  sector \nexpenditure  corresponding  to  the  plan,  both  in  terms  of  size  and  expenditure  items;  and \n(iii) evidence that the conditional grants are additional to the district governments\u2019 regular health \nbudget\u2014the district governments should increase the regular health budget in real terms. The \nperformance indicators should be directly linked to MSDS, and easy to measure. The evaluation \nof  district  governments\u2019  performance  will  take  into  account  the  differences  in  initial  conditions. \nThe Health Department, through ODGHS,  will ensure the quality of district governments\u2019 plans \nand monitor the performance of district governments in terms of health outputs and outcomes. \nThe  Finance  Department  will  monitor  the  accounts  of  the  conditional  grants  at  district \ngovernments. \n\n76. \nUnder  subprogram  2,  to  ensure  the  continuity  of  fund  flows  to  the  health  sector, \nconditional grants earmarked for the health sector will be incorporated in the next PFC award for \nFY2010\u2013FY2012. Effective use of the conditional grants, however, relies on the presence of a \nrobust monitoring mechanism, which makes district governments accountable for the use of the \ngrants. District governments will be required to submit quarterly progress reports to the Health \nDepartment for monitoring execution of the health budget.  \n \n77. \nPolicy Objective 3-2: Improved financial Management and Reporting in the Health \nSector.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  Health  Department  has  decided  to  merge  the  development \nwing  and  the  budget  and  accounts  wing  into  an  FMC  tasked  to  drive  financial  management \nreforms  in  the  Health  Department  and  its  spending  agencies,  and  for  collecting  budget  and \nexpenditure  information  from  districts  (Appendix  10).  The  FMC  will  be  the  focal  point  in  the \nHealth Department for the Finance Department and Planning and Development Department for \nbudget  preparation.  The  FMC  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating  the  budget  preparation  and \nexecution process and ensuring adherence to the budget preparation principles. The FMC will \nbe central to financial reporting in the health sector, and will be able to generate management \naccounting  information  to  facilitate  budgetary  control  and  achievement  against  policy  goals.  It \nwill  liaise  with  the  internal  audit  wing  to  review  internal  control  mechanisms  in  the  Health \nDepartment  and  its  spending  agencies.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  Finance  Department  will \nfacilitate \nthe  revised  budget  manual  and \ndisseminating it to all line departments. \n \n78. \nThe FMC will be the nucleus of financial information in the sector, with reporting streams \nestablished  between  itself  and  all  districts,  autonomous  bodies,  subdepartments  in  the  Health \nDepartment,  the  drug  test  laboratory,  and  ODGHS.  Statements  of  expenditure,  in  an  agreed \nformat  based  on  the  new  accounting  model  chart  of  accounts  and  classifications  developed \nunder  the  World  Bank-supported  Project  for  Improved  Financial  Reporting  and  Accounting \n(PIFRA), will be collected on a monthly basis for all provincially funded units and on a quarterly \nbasis  from  districts.  Consolidation  could  be  done  on  a  simple  database  or  preferably  on  the \naccounting module of the PIFRA system, and monthly management accounts produced for the \nsecretary and senior management of the Health Department. Reconciliation with the Accountant \nGeneral\u2019s  Office  will  be  required.  During  subprogram  2  and  3,  as  the  FMC  gets  up  to  full \nstrength,  district  reporting  will  also  be  monthly  and  will  be  based  on  accounting  information, \nwhich is fully reconciled at the district account officer\u2019s office.  \n \n\nimproved  budget  preparation  by  publishing \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nUnder subprogram 1, the Finance Department has agreed to prioritize implementation of \n79. \nthe  budget  module  of  the  PIFRA  interface  in  the  Health  Department.  A  range  of  supporting \nactivities  for  this  will  include  the  provision  of  comprehensive  staff  training  in  the  system,  the \nestablishment and staffing of a SAP (PIFRA software) competency center in Lahore and other \ntraining to ensure linkages with MTEF requirements, and rollout of the PIFRA system at district \nlevel. \n \n80. \nThe PIFRA SAP 3 system has been used for 2 financial years in Punjab and has been \nextended  to  all  35  district  account  officer  offices.  The  classification  codes,  drafted  as  part  of \nPIFRA  reforms  nationally,  are  fixed  at  the  functional  code  level  but  can  be  adjusted  via  the \nnational  code  control  committee.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  classification  codes  for  financial \nreporting  in  the  health  sector  will  be  modified  to  better  reflect  the  health  sector  core  areas  of \nactivity in primary, secondary, and tertiary health care; research and development; and medical \neducation. This will become important as the MTEF is strengthened.  \n \n81. \nPolicy  Objective  3-3:  Improved  Internal  Controls  and  Audit  in  the  Health  Sector. \nUnder  subprogram  1,  the  Health  Department  analyzes  the  effectiveness  and  adequacy  of \ninternal controls based on audit observations, and prepares a conceptual framework on how to \nimprove  the  internal  controls.  Periodic  meetings  of  the  departmental  accounts  committees  will \nbe convened by the secretary of health to reduce the backlog in audit observations raised by the \nexternal auditor in a timely manner. The Health Department will have satisfactorily responded to \nat least 1,000 audit observations during subprogram 1. \n \n82. \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  Health  Department  will  fill  the  director  and  deputy  director \nposts in the internal audit wing and ensure that the latter remains fully staffed. An audit plan for \nthe wing will be prepared and submitted to the secretary of health. A timetable and format for \ninternal  audit  reports,  a  plan  for  the  audit  committee  to  review  these  reports  and  take \nmanagement action as required will be prepared. The deepening of internal audit reforms will be \nbased on effective auditing of entities in accordance with the audit plan, and more importantly, \nthe evidence of follow-up action by the secretary of health where needed. This will be required \nin a situation where audit recommendations and objections are raised, but no follow-up action is \ntaken  by  the  auditor.  By  setting  examples  and  demonstrating  the  seriousness  of  senior \nmanagement  to  improving  internal  control,  the  secretary,  as  principal  accounting  officer,  will \nensure  that  a  virtuous  circle  of  improvement  occurs  in  internal  controls,  with  more  efficient \noperating conditions and better functioning of the management. \n \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  Finance  Department  will  prepare  and  approve  detailed  job \n83. \ndescriptions  and  terms  of  service  for  district  governments\u2019  internal  auditors,23 along  with  an \ninternal  audit  manual.  The  internal  audit  function  of  the  district  governments  will  also  be \nstrengthened,  as  district  governments  will  have  appointed  internal  auditors  who  will  develop \naudit  plans,  reporting  channels  to  the  district  coordination  officer,  and  local  audit  committees \nevidenced by regular meetings and follow-up actions.  \n \n\n                                                 \n23 The lack of regulations on the terms of service for internal auditors of district governments is a serious obstacle for \neffective  functioning  of  the  internal  audit  function,  and  is  a  key  aspect  to  be  dealt  with  under  this  policy  action. \nDistrict governments do not have a cadre of civil servants and this impairs the district nazim\u2019s ability to appoint an \ninternal auditor. A decision has to be taken regarding whether the internal auditors will be from the accounting and \nbudgeting cadre of the provincial government or seconded from the Auditor General\u2019s Office of Pakistan. Training \nof  internal  auditors  also  deserves  the  serious  attention  of  the  Finance  Department,  which  can  be  addressed \nthrough the TA support provided by the PDSSP.   \n\n \n\n\fthe  poor  may  not  access \n\nPolicy  Objective  3-4:  A  Pro-Poor  Health  Financing  System  Developed.  GoPb  is \n84. \ncommitted  to  increasing  public  health  expenditure  in  primary  and  secondary  health  services, \nwhich  are  proven  to  be  more  pro-poor  than  in  tertiary  health  care.  The  conditional  grants \nintroduced with PMDGP support will also be distributed among districts through a formula taking \ninto  account  poverty  incidence.  In  addition  to  targeting  the  public  resources  in  a  pro-poor \nmanner  through  these  measures,  GoPb  will  have  employed  two  additional  approaches  to \nprovide equitable health services: (i) health expenditure subsidy programs targeted at the poor, \nand (ii) an equitable health financing system. An immediate need is to develop a mechanism to \nrelieve  poor  women  and  children  from  the  burden  of  high  health  expenditures.  Under  policy \nobjective  1,  the  state  government  will  have  made  quality  health  services  available  to  its \npopulation.  However, \nthe  services  because  of  economic \nconsiderations.  During  subprogram  1,  GoPb  has  started  studies  on  user  charges  and  out-of-\npocket  expenditures  to  collect  data  required  for  designing  the  programs  targeted  at  the  poor, \nand preparing possible models to be pilot tested. During subprogram 2, the selected models will \nbe  pilot  tested  and  successful  ones  will  have  been  expanded  to  cover  at  least  50%  of  the \ntargeted population during subprogram 3.  \n \nDevelopment  of  a  long-term  health  financing  and  provider  payment  system  requires \n85. \ncareful  examination  of  different  options  and \nthe \nstakeholders. It has been agreed that a working group comprising individuals with expertise in \nfinance,  public  health  services,  and  private  health  services  will  be  constituted  to  examine \ndifferent  models,  calculate  financial  implications,  and  write  reports  to  be  submitted  to  the \nsteering committee that will make the final decision. During subprogram 1, a working group has \nbeen  constituted  comprising  representatives  of  the  Planning  and  Development  Department, \nFinance  Department,  Health  Department,  private  health  care  providers,  and  other  relevant \nstakeholders; and an action plan has been agreed. During subprogram 2, initial policy directions \nregarding  health  care  financing  and  provider  payment  should  be  determined,  and  a  capacity-\nbuilding plan and budget for it should be included in the provincial budget. During subprogram 3, \nnecessary  regulatory  frameworks  for  the  new  health  care  financing  and  provider  payment \nsystem will be adopted.  \n\nimplications,  and  consultations  with \n\n \n\nC. \n\nImportant Features \n\n86. \nThe PMDGP has two pillars: (i) improving the quality and availability of health services, \nand  (ii)  improving  public  financial  management  within  the  health  sector.  ADB  has  extensive \nexperience  in  financing  reforms  in  the  health  sector  and  public  financial  management.  By \ncombining  both  areas  in  one  program,  the  PMDGP  will  help  GoPb  achieve  MDGs  by  making \nmore  effective  use  of  available  resources.  For  ADB\u2019s  developing  member  countries,  attaining \nMDGs is as much a problem of technical constraints as that of managing limited resources. \n \nThe PMDGP marks the Health Department\u2019s major priority shifts from quantity to quality \n87. \nof health care, from fragmented to consolidated health service, and from tertiary to primary and \nsecondary health care. Building on GoPb\u2019s health sector reform framework, which has covered \na  wide  range  of  activities,  the  PMDGP  will  help  prioritize  actions  around  the  MSDS,  and  give \nfinancial  means  to  implement  them.  The  PMDGP  will  integrate  different  levels  of  health  care \nthrough  the  referral  system;  different  levels  of  planning  and  financing  exercises  through \nstreamlined  budgeting  and  reporting  mechanisms;  and  institutional  reforms  through  FMC  and \nstrategy and policy unit, and the Health Department and EDOs. \n\n88. \nThe  PMDGP  will  help  GoPb  institutionalize  contracting  of  health  services  delivery  or \nmanagement  to  other  organizations,  based  on  the  evaluation  of  pilots  in  Punjab.  This  is \n\n22 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n23\n\nexpected to improve the efficiency of health service delivery, and make the services flexible by \nremoving  bureaucratic  rigidities.  Contracting  has  been  successfully  tried  out  in  Cambodia  and \nBangladesh  with  ADB\u2019s  financial  support,  but  has  not  been  expanded  to  other  countries  on  a \nlarge scale yet.   \n\nD. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n89. \nThe PMDGP adopts a program cluster loan approach consisting of three subprograms, \neach  supported  by  a  single-tranche  loan.  Intervals  of  about  1.0\u20131.5  years  are  envisaged \nbetween  the  subprograms.  Subject  to  satisfactory  progress  and  approval  of  subprogram  1  in \nOctober  2008,  subprogram  2  could  be  considered  in  December  2009,  and  subprogram  3  in \nDecember 2010.  \n \n90. \nThe  reform  agenda  for  subprogram  2,  and  especially  subprogram  3,  will  be  refined \nbased on progress made and emerging needs. GoPb has requested that financing support for \nsubprograms 2 and 3 be about $200 million\u2013$300 million in total, in view of the large resource \nrequirements until alternative financing modalities take hold and mature. The amount for each \ntranche will be reconfirmed during the PMDGP review and processing of each subprogram. \n \n91. \nFor subprogram 1, it is proposed that ADB support GoPb\u2019s reforms under the PMDGP \nwith  a  loan  of  $100  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources.  The  loan  size  for \nsubprogram 1 and the indicative financing requirements for subprograms 2 and 3 are based on \nthe following factors: \n \n\n\u2022  Maintaining basic health services for the poor and mitigating the financial crisis impact: \n\nRs.13 billion ($162 million) for July 2008-June 2009 \n\n\u2022  Roll  out  of  MSDS24 in  the  health  sector:  Rs.34  billion  ($425  million)  for  the  next  three \n\nfiscal years \n\n\u2022  Scaling up of per capita public health expenditures by at least 40% per year for the next \nyears  allowing  Punjab  to  raise  per  capita  spending  to  about  half  of  the  international \nbenchmark set by WHO, or to about $16, by FY2011: this will require a tripling of public \nhealth expenditures from $431 million in FY2009 to $1.36 billion in FY201125    \n\n \n92. \nUnder  subprogram  1,  GoPb  will  allocate  PRs3.5  billion  (in  counterpart  funds)  as \nconditional grants to district governments to carry out the reforms associated with the program \n(see para.97). This is based on a careful assessment of the district health systems\u2019 absorption \ncapacity given that a substantial part of an expected tranche release under the PDSSP will be \ntransferred to districts earmarked for social service delivery and resources have been allocated \nfor district governments under the federal MNCH program.  \n \nThe  loan  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  will  have  an  interest  rate  of  1%  per \n93. \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, a term of 24 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the loan agreement. \nThe Borrower will be the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The Government of Pakistan will relend \nthe local currency generated from the proceeds of the loan to GoPb. The terms and conditions \nwill be the same as those extended by ADB to the Borrower.   \n                                                 \n24 Out of this, MNCH-related MSDS will cost Punjab about PRs7 billion for the next three years. \n25 These  figures  are  obtained  from  the  current  and  projected  per-capita  expenditures,  net  of  the  cost  of  MSDS \nimplementation. For FY2009, the total health budget requirement at the provincial and district levels is $573 million \nin total, including $142 million for MSDS implementation (which is computed as an average of the 3-year projected \nrequirements). \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management  \n\nThe  Health  Department  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  PMDGP.  The  program \n94. \nmanagement  unit  for  HSRP  will  be  responsible  for  daily  coordination  and  management.  The \nhigh-level  program  steering  committee  for  HSRP\u2014chaired  by  chairman  of  the  Planning  and \nDevelopment Board, and comprising the secretary of health, secretary of finance, secretary of \nlocal  government  and  community  development,  and  health  care  providers  as  members\u2014will \nalso  be  the  program  steering  committee  for  the  PMDGP  and  oversee  policy  decisions.  The \nprogram  steering  committee  will  meet  at  least  once  every  6  months.  A  working  group\u2014\ncomprising  at  least  representatives  of  public  and  private  health  providers,  Health  Department, \nFinance Department, and existing social insurance programs\u2014will be constituted for developing \npro-poor health care financing and provider payment.  \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n95. \nThe  implementation  period  for  the  PMDGP  subprogram  1  is  from  January  to  October \n2008.  The  indicative  implementation  period  for  subprogram  2  is  November  2008\u2013November \n2009; and for subprogram 3, January 2010\u2013December 2010.  \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n96. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs  (excluding \nlocal duties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding the \nitems specified in a negative list of ineligible items (and imports financed by other bilateral and \nmultilateral sources). The list of ineligible items is in Appendix 11. The proceeds of the program \nloan will be disbursed to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan as the Borrower. No supporting import \ndocumentation will be required if, during each year that the loan proceeds are expected to be \ndisbursed,  the  value  of  Pakistan\u2019s  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries, \nineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development assistance is equal to \nor  greater  than  the  amount  of  the  loan  expected  to  be  disbursed  during  that  year.  The \nGovernment will certify its compliance with this formula with each withdrawal request. Otherwise, \nimport documentation under existing procedures  will be required. Disbursements will be made \nunder the simplified procedures for program loans.  \n\n4. \n\nRelease of Program Proceeds and Counterpart Financing \n\n97. \nThe  subprogram  1  loan  of  $100  million  equivalent  will  be  released  in  a  single  tranche \nupon  loan  effectiveness,  and  satisfactory  completion  of  all  subprogram  1  actions  in  the  policy \nmatrix. The federal government will ensure that the local currency counterpart funds generated \nby  the  loan  will  be  used  as  additional  resources  to  provincial  financial  resources  already \nallocated for primary and secondary health care; PRs3.5 billion of these counterpart funds will \nbe specifically allocated to district governments as conditional grants for the health sector. GoPb \nwill certify the use of counterpart funds through audited statements acceptable to ADB. \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption, Fiduciary Issues, Accounting and Auditing \n\n98. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Program.  To  support  these \n\n \n\n\f \n\n25\n\nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Program. The policy actions under the PMDGP will mitigate \nthe corruption risks in the health sector. Policy objectives 3-2 and 3-3 are especially meant to \nstrengthen  financial  reporting  and  internal  control  of  the  Health  Department  and  district \ngovernments.   \n\n99. \nThe  Program\u2019s  emphasis  on  improving  internal  controls  and  internal  audit  at  both  the \nHealth Department and district government levels will improve transparency and accountability \nin the use of public resources and ensure that fund leakage is minimized. Furthermore, the use \nof the conditional grant mechanism for the transfer of funds to district governments will ensure \nthat  money  is  used  effectively  to  achieve  the  MNCH-related  MSDS  and  is  not  diverted  to \nalternative  uses,  for  which  a  built-in  performance  monitoring  mechanism  consisting  of  various \nmonitoring  tools  will  be  instituted.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  information  and  communication \ncampaign to be undertaken by district governments on the MSDS will help in raising community \nawareness on the minimum level of service delivery, thus enabling civil society to scrutinize the \nperformance of public health facilities. The Program will also support disclosure of information \non achievement of MNCH-related MDGs and MSDS. \n\n6. \n\nPerformance Monitoring and Evaluation, Program Review, and Reporting \n\n100.  The  Health  Department,  through  ODGHS,  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  and \nanalyzing  progress  in  attaining  health  MDGs  and  related  indicators  that  include  PMDGP \noutcome  indicators.  An  M&E  framework  that  harmonizes  different  sources  of  information \nregularly  collected  by  different  levels  of  the  government  and  different  programs  will  be \ndeveloped, and DHIS data will be regularly analyzed and published. The baseline of the MMR \nand  IMR  will  be  established  based  on  the  Multi-Indicators  Cluster  Survey  conducted  by  the \nBureau of Statistics in 2007\u20132008. GoPb will conduct a repeated Multi Indicators Cluster Survey \non  the  IMR  and  MMR  in  2011\u20132012  to  examine  progress  in  attaining  MDG  goals.  The \navailability  of  drugs  and  human  resources  will  be  regularly  monitored  by  EDOs,  Health; \nproblems  will  be  tackled  at  the  district  level,  and  if  necessary,  by  the  Health  Department.  In \naddition,  the  program  management  unit  for  the  PMDGP  will  regularly  monitor  primary  and \nsecondary health facilities through the chief minister\u2019s army.  \n\n101.  GoPb  has  been  regularly  reporting  the  proportion  of  births  attended  by  skilled  birth \nattendants  and  immunization  coverage,  which  have  a  direct  impact  on  the  IMR  and  MMR,  in \naddition to the IMR and MMR themselves. The percentage of deliveries at health facilities with \nthe assistance of skilled birth attendants will be added to the report. Most maternal deaths occur \nduring labor, delivery, or within 24 hours of delivery. Most complications are difficult to predict or \nprevent,  and  diagnosis  of \ninterventions  require \nconsiderable  skills  and  timely  access  to  a  referral  level  facility,  which  skilled  birth  attendants \ncannot provide in time if at home. \n\nthese  complications  and  appropriate \n\n102. \n GoPb  and  ADB  will  periodically  review  progress  in  implementation  and  assess  the \nimpact of the PMDGP. GoPb will keep ADB informed of the outcome of policy discussions with \nother multilateral and bilateral agencies that have implications for the PMDGP implementation, \nand  will  provide  ADB  with  the  opportunity  to  comment  on  any  resulting  policy  proposals.  A \nprogress  review  will  be  conducted  by  the  steering  committee  every  quarter,  and  the  Health \nDepartment will submit to ADB detailed quarterly reports, which will include the minutes of the \nreviews. The first progress report will be due within 3 months of loan effectiveness.   \n\n \n\n\fV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\nImproved  Access  and  Quality  of  Primary  and  Secondary  Health  Services.  By \n103. \nhelping Punjab attain the health MDGs, the proposed Program will have potentially helped the \nprovince save at least 11,000 women\u2019s lives and 235,000 infants\u2019 lives by 2015 compared to the \nscenario without program support, assuming that the two health MDGs are fully met within that \ntime frame. By helping all 35 district governments endorse and implement MSDS, the Program \nwill ensure that minimum acceptable levels of service delivery standards are followed across the \nentire  province.  The  adoption  of  guidelines  for  MSDS  implementation  and  the  requirement  for \ndistrict  governments  to  develop  a  time-bound  and  fully-costed  implementation  plan  will  help \nminimize slippages in the introduction of the minimum standards. Sufficient and capable human \nresources are an essential determinant of service quality. The proposed Program will improve \nthe  capacity  of  the  Health  Department  and  district  governments  to  plan  their  human  resource \nneeds, and more importantly will support continued education of medical staff. Finally, progress \ntoward  introduction  of  a  quality  assurance  mechanism  for  private  health  care  providers  will \nensure a safe and uniform standard of services across the province. By ensuring primary and \nsecondary health services to meet MSDS, the Program is expected to have a positive impact on \nMDG6 on HIV/AIDS. MSDS includes HIV preventive measures.  \n\n104.  Poverty  Reduction.  Poor  people  have  the  worst  health  outcomes.  They  are  pushed \nfurther  into  poverty  because  of  ill  health,  resulting  in  lower  productivity  or  loss  of  daily  wages, \nand a burden of high health care expenditures. Although public health care is in principle free, \npatients  often  have  to  pay  substantial  amounts  for  health  care  because  of  missing  drugs  and \nsupplies at public health facilities. The cost of care at private facilities is even more expensive. \nBy making quality and affordable care available at public facilities through a targeted program, \nand the development of an equitable health financing system, the proposed Program will reduce \nthe  health  care  expenditure  burden  and  the  risks  of  falling  seriously  ill  by  giving  timely \ninterventions.  By  ensuring  increased  allocations  to  primary  and  secondary  health  care,  and \ndistributing  the  conditional  grants  among  districts  through  a  formula  that  takes  into  account \npoverty incidence, the Program will make public finances more pro-poor. The summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 12. \n\n105. \nImproved Management of Health Services. Timely availability of drugs and medicines \nin all health facilities is an essential aspect of health service delivery. The Program will support \nstreamlining  of  the  drug  procurement  process  and  will  help  the  Government  institutionalize \nalternative mechanisms for service delivery by building on lessons from experience.  \n\n106.  Economic  Impact.  Improved  public  financial  management  in  the  health  sector  and \nbetter  strategic  planning  skills  in  the  Health  Department  will  contribute  to  increased  value  for \nmoney  of  public  spending.  Provision  of  conditional  grants  to  district  governments  for  MDG-\nrelated  interventions  will  ease  district  governments\u2019  resource  constraints  while  ensuring  that \nessential service delivery priorities are protected from expenditure cuts. The increased access \nand quality of public health services will also have a direct poverty-reducing impact by lowering \nthe burden of health expenditures on the poor.  \n\n107. \nInstitutional Impact. The health sector in Punjab is in dire need of institutional reforms. \nStrengthening  of  the  strategy  and  policy  unit  within  the  Health  Department  will  ensure  that \npolicies  and  strategies  are  properly  defined,  corresponding  actions  planned,  and  resources \nallocated  accordingly.  Creation  of  the  FMC  and  related  capacity-building  interventions  will \n\n26 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n27\n\nensure that the budget preparation and execution process is owned at the managerial level and \nthat strategic decisions are based on realistic information through adequate reporting on the use \nof  financial  resources  across  the  health  sector.  Revitalization  of  the  internal  audit  wing  and  of \nthe  departmental  account  committees  in  the  Health  Department,  and  appointing  internal \nauditors at district governments, will enhance the effectiveness of internal controls and increase \naccountability  for  the  use  of  public  funds.  Simultaneously,  ODGHS  will  be  restructured  and \ngiven  capacity-building  support  to  give  technical  guidance  to  and  monitor  the  performance  of \nhealth service delivery by district governments.    \n\nB. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures  \n\n108.  Political  Risks. There is strong commitment at both political and bureaucratic levels in \nPunjab to improving the living standards of the poor. To this purpose, GoPb has accorded high \npriority to investments in social sectors, particularly health and education. The FY2009 recurrent \nand  development  budget  allocations  to  the  health  sector  have  substantially  increased  (+53% \nrecurrent  and  +38%  development).  Although  commitment  to  the  broad  direction  of  reforms  is \nensured, the future of the local government system under the new political setup may be at risk \nas  provincial  governments  across  Pakistan  are  exploring  options  to  revisit  intra-provincial \nadministrative and fiscal relationships within the current local government system. While a total \nreversal of the 2001 PLGO is unlikely, changes in the current distribution of power and authority \nacross levels of government may occur. The flexibility built into the single tranche operations is \nwell-suited  to  addressing  the  uncertainty  surrounding  the  local  government  setup,  and  reform \nactions  may  be  adjusted  under  subprogram  2.  However,  if  the  change  in  the  PLGO  leads  to \nseparation of primary and secondary health services financing and administrative management, \nthe negative effect of the separation (i.e., further fragmentation of the health services) would be \nvery difficult to contain. ADB should dialogue closely with GoPb to avoid such fragmentation.  \n\n109.  Governance  Risks. There are several governance risks in the areas of public financial \nmanagement,  expenditure  planning  and  control,  procurement,  and  corruption.  As  a  policy  and \ninstitutional reform program, the PMDGP deliberately and explicitly puts governance and public \nexpenditure management issues at the center of the reform effort. Reforms proposed under the \nPMDGP  will  positively  affect  the  current  institutional  setup  in  the  health  sector  and  address \nthese  governance  risks.  The  change  in  public  financial  management  practices  and  the \nemphasis on results-based allocation of resources is likely to encounter resistance from middle-\nmanagement  officials  who  have  vested  interests  in  perpetuating  the  situation.  The  strong \ncommitment  to  reform  at  the  highest  political  and  bureaucratic  level  within  the  Health \nDepartment will help mitigate this risk. In addition, internal and external performance M&E, and \npublicizing  the  performance  are  expected  to  change  the  situation  gradually.  The  PMDGP  has \nbuilt-in third-party assessments, including a citizen satisfaction survey, as policy conditions.  \n\nC. \n\nImplementation Risks  \n\n110.  Capacity Risks. The success of the PMDGP is premised on the existence of a cadre of \nqualified  and  committed  health  professionals  at  all  levels,  and  assumes  that  the  proposed \nincentive structures ensure the retention of health professionals, particularly those posted to the \nBHUs. There are risks that the required number of health professionals may not be immediately \navailable  for  the  public  sector.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  GoPb  has  introduced  monetary  and \nnonmonetary  incentives  for  doctors  posted  at  BHUs,  which  have  resulted  in  a  significant \nreduction of vacancies. In addition, the measures of the PMDGP will cascade over time, starting \nwith lower levels and gradually moving up to doctors. At the lower levels, the required number of \nfemale  health  visitors,  for  instance,  can  be  mobilized  in  a  relatively  short  period.  The  Health \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\nDepartment will also develop a dedicated capacity-building plan, and subprograms 2 and 3 will \nprovide resources for implementing the plan.   \n\n111.  External  and  Macroeconomic  Risks.  The  recent  upsurge  in  international  commodity \nprices  is  having  an  adverse  impact  on  Pakistan\u2019s  macroeconomic  indicators.  While  recurrent \nand development expenditures need to be managed carefully, essential pro-poor investments in \nhealth and education are likely to be preserved at the federal and provincial levels.  Finally, the \npolitical  commitment  to  investments  in  social  sectors  will  protect  pro-poor  investments  from \nbudget cuts.  \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITION FOR DISBURSEMENT \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nA. \n \n112. \nfollowing assurances, which have been incorporated into the legal documents: \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  of  Pakistan  has  given  the \n\nCounterpart  funds  will  be  used  to  meet  the  reform  and  other  financing  needs \nrelating  to  implementation  of  the  PMDGP,  including  specific  allocation  of  a \nportion  of  the  counterpart  funds  for  the  conditional  grants  as  described  in \nparas. 74-75 above;  \n\nGoPb will ensure that (a) the objectives achieved, policies adopted, and actions \ntaken  prior  to  the  date  of  the  Loan  Agreement,  as  set  forth  in  the  development \npolicy  letter,  will  continue  to  be  in  full  force  and  effect  for  the  duration  of  the \nPMDGP and subsequently; and (b) once achieved, adopted, complied with, and \nimplemented,  the  objectives,  policies,  and  actions  set  forth  in  the  development \npolicy letter will continue to be in full force and effect during and subsequent to \nthe PMDGP program period;  \n\nGoPb  will  allocate  a  total  of  PRs3.5  billion  in  conditional  grants,  to  district \ngovernments  for  FY2009  to  support  the  health sector  component,  in  addition  to \nthe regular PFC awards;  \n\nGoPb  will  ensure  that  the  conditional  grants  will  be  disbursed  by  its  Finance \nDepartment  to  district  governments  within  1  month  from  the  date  each  such \ndistrict government has satisfied the minimum conditions;  \n\nGoPb  will  ensure  that  primary  and  secondary  health  services  continue  to  be \nintegrated and are operating as one coherent health system; \n\nGoPb  will  ensure  that  the  conditional  grant  will  be  in  addition  to  district \ngovernments\u2019  regular  health  budget,  and  used  for  implementing  MNCH  related \nMSDS  and  other  selected  activities  agreed  between  GoPb  and  district \ngovernments,  including  a  minimum  of  10%  of  the  base  conditional  grants \nallocation for capacity building activities;  \n\n(vii)  GoPb,  through  the  Health  Department,  will  ensure  that  the  existing  policy \nguidelines on transfers and tenure are adhered to in order to ensure appropriate \njob tenure and effective implementation of the Program; and \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n29\n\n(viii)  GoPb  will  ensure  that  the  PMDGP  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the \nin  Pakistan  and  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental  rules  and  regulations  applicable \nEnvironment  Policy \nimplementation  of  any \n(2002).  GoPb  will  ensure \nenvironmental  monitoring  and  mitigation  measures,  including  development  and \nimplementation  of  any  service  standards  and  operating  procedures  for  disposal \nof hazardous and medical waste. \n\n \nB. \n\nCondition for Disbursement \n\n113.

However, progress toward achieving the MDGs in Pakistan is \nfar from satisfactory. While there had been claims of poverty reduction, economic growth, and \nimprovement  in  gross  domestic  product  (real  growth  rate1 rose  from  4.5%  in  2003  to  6.6%  in \n2007), no corresponding impact is visible on reducing maternal and child mortality. For example, \nthe infant mortality rate (IMR) was 77 per 1,000 live births in 2000-2001 and 78 per 1,000 live \nbirths  in  2006\u20132007.  Pakistan\u2019s  IMR  and  maternal  mortality  ratio  (MMR)  are  the  highest  in \nSouth Asia, population growth rate is the highest, and contraceptive availability the lowest. High \npopulation  growth  will  increase  pressure  on  the  already  weak  public  health  service  delivery \nsystem.  \n\n2. \nAs  Pakistan,  including  Punjab,  is  going  through  an  epidemiological  and  demographic \ntransition, it is still facing a challenge of burden of pre-transitional communicable diseases, while \nthe  prevalence  of  noncommunicable  and  chronic  illnesses  is  emerging  as  an  additional \nchallenge for the already compromised health service delivery system. Coupled with prevailing \nilliteracy,  poverty,  and  low  status  of  women  in  society,  this  is  hampering  progress  toward \nachieving  the  MDGs  related  to  maternal,  neonatal  and  child  health  (MNCH).  Development \nefforts are further threatened because of political instability, extremism, and violence. \n\n3. \nPunjab health sector analysis shows that it is unlikely to achieve the MDGs unless the \nhealth  sector  is  effectively  reformed  to  make  good  quality  MNCH  services  accessible  to  the \nmasses in Punjab. To bridge urban\u2013rural inequity in coverage, more allocation will be required \nfor  services  in  rural  areas  along  with  enhanced  efficiency  and  institutional  capacity  to  deliver \ngood quality services. Furthermore, to achieve the MDG related to MMR (MDG5), a significant \npolicy shift will be required to encourage institutional delivery to ensure that all required care can \nbe offered including emergency obstetric care. \n\n1. \n\nCurrent Status of Health MDGs \n\n4. \nChild  Mortality  (MDG4).  In  Punjab,  the  under-five  mortality  rate  is  recorded  to  be \n112 per  1,000  live  births  (2003\u20132004).  There  is  significant  regional  disparity,  with  a  lower  rate \n(75  per  1,000  live  births)  in  major  urban  cities  and  a  higher  rate  (119  per  1,000  live  births)  in \nrural  Punjab\u2014against  the  MDG  target  of  52  per  1,000  live births  by  2015.  The  IMR  in  Punjab \nwas  115  in  1996\u20131997  and  has  been  reduced  to  77  per  1,000  live  births  in  2003\u20132004.2 It  is \nmuch higher in rural areas (82 per 1,000 live births) than major urban cities (55 per 1,000 live \nbirths).  Districts  located  in  northern  Punjab  close  to  the  provincial  capital  report  lower  IMR \ncompared to districts in the south. The significant urban\u2013rural disparity shows inequity in service \ndistribution and access to basic health services in Punjab.  \n\n5. \nMore  than  half  of  the  under-five  deaths  and  70%  of  infant  deaths  occur  during  the \nneonatal period caused by sepsis, asphyxia, preterm births, and neonatal tetanus.3 The causes \n\n                                                 \n1  Gross  domestic  product  growth  on  an  annual  basis  adjusted  for  inflation  and  expressed  as  a  percentage. \n\nhttp://indexmundi.com/pakistan/gdp_real_growth_rate.html. \n\n2  Government of the Punjab (GoPb). 2004.

Mortality Country Fact Sheet for Pakistan.  \n    http://www.who.int/whosis/mort/profiles/mort_emro_pak_pakistn.pdf \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n \n37\n\nof  postneonatal  child  death  include  infectious  diseases,  mainly  diarrhea  and  pneumonia.4 The \ndeaths caused by all these causes are preventable if good quality health care is accessible.  \n\n6. \nThe current situation suggests that achieving the MDG target for under-five mortality will \nbe  a  challenge  unless  health  sector  reform  efforts,  including  effective  implementation  of \nminimum  service  delivery  standards  (MSDS),  are  rigorously  followed.  If  there  is  no  significant \nimprovement and if the IMR continues to be as high as 77 per 1,000 live births, Punjab will lose \nalmost  257,000  infants  in  2009.  There  is  an  urgency  to  act  now  and  improve  access  to  good \nquality basic MNCH-related health care.  \n\n7. \nMaternal Health (MDG5). Pakistan reports the sixth highest number of maternal deaths, \nabout 15,000 a year.5 Currently, the MMR of Pakistan is estimated to be 400 per 100,000 live \nbirths, which shows a decline from 550 per 100,000 live births in 1990. In Punjab, the MMR is \nestimated  to  be  300  per  100,000  live  births6 against  the  MDG  target  of  140  per  100,000  live \nbirths.  \n\nThe main causes of maternal death include hemorrhage (53%), puerperal sepsis (16%), \n8. \neclampsia  (14%),  and  incomplete  abortion  and  retained  placenta  (11%). 7  According  to  the \nexperts, once the postpartum hemorrhage has started the patient has only an hour or two within \nwhich she will require blood transfusion and obstetrical assistance to save her life. The 2006\u2013\n2007  demographic  health  survey  revealed  that  lack  of  knowledge  is  the  primary  cause  of  not \nseeking  medical  assistance,  followed  by  concerns  about  costs.  Physical  access  to  a  health \nfacility,  including  availability  of  transportation,  is  also  a  major  problem  for  some  pockets.  The \nexisting cultural norms, dominated by patriarchal characteristics and limited mobility of women, \nare sometimes a problem.  \n\n9. \nIf the current MMR of 300 in Punjab is not reduced, about 10,000 mothers will die in the \nprocess of giving birth in 2009. Unfortunately, looking at past trends and inefficiencies in health \ncare delivery systems, coupled with the poor status of women in society, it seems highly unlikely \nthat  this  MDG  will  be  attained  unless  (i)  serious  input  is  provided  to  reform  the  health  sector; \n(ii) MSDS  are  strictly  implemented;  and  (iii)  effective  obstetric  emergency  care  is  made \naccessible to the masses, particularly in rural areas.    \n\n2. \n\nCoverage of Health Interventions Essential to Reduce Maternal and Child \nMortality \n\nCoverage  of  all  essential  health  interventions  is  unacceptably  low  (Table  A2.1).  This \n10. \nfurther  illustrates  the  significant  urban\u2013rural  disparity  in  coverage.  Since  the  majority  (69%)  of \npeople  in  Punjab  resides  in  rural  areas8 where  coverage  is  low,  an  overall  improvement  in \nPunjab\u2019s health indicators will not be visible unless attention is given to raise coverage in rural \nareas.  \n\n                                                 \n4   United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund.  2008.

District-Based  Multiple \n\nIndicator Cluster Survey 2003\u201304. Lahore.  \n\n \nAlthough all the above indicators are unacceptably low, perhaps the most worrisome is \n11. \nthe  low  proportion  of  women  delivering  babies  in  health  facilities,  particularly  in  rural  areas.  A \nrecent  article9 highlights  the  importance  of  institutional  deliveries  and  the  risk  of  delivering  at \nhome, even by a skilled birth attendant, since there is a limit to what a skilled person can do in a \nhome. \n\n12. \nIt  is  critical  for  policy  makers  and  program  implementers  to  start  thinking  of  ways  of \nencouraging institutional deliveries if MDG5 is to be achieved. At least addressing institutional \nbarriers\u2014such  as  the  unavailability  of  women  medical  officers  (WMOs),  gynecologists,  lady \nhealth  visitors,  and  midwives;  and  ensuring  privacy  at  labor  rooms,  physical  standards,  and \navailability of equipment and supplies\u2014could be a starting point by the Health Department.   \n\nNutritional  Status  of  Children.  Malnutrition  among  children  is  identified  as  a  major \n13. \nunderlying  condition  that  predisposes  children  to  fatal  diseases,  leading  to  high  mortality.  The \nprevalence  of  34%  malnutrition  in  Punjab  is  higher  than  the  threshold  of  the  World  Health \nOrganization (WHO) to call it a serious public health problem.  \n\n14. \nHealth  Awareness  and  Basic  Hygiene  Practices.  One  of  the  major  causes  of  child \nmortality  is  diarrhea,  which  can  be  prevented  with  simple  basic  hygiene  practices.  In  Punjab, \nonly 41% of households reported using soap to wash their hands before eating food and 55% \nafter using toilets.   \n\n3. \n\nHealth Care Provision and Service Utilization \n\nIn Punjab, health care is offered through the network of health facilities in the public and \n15. \nprivate sectors. The public sector consists of primary care facilities including 188 maternal and \nchild  health  centers,  2,456  basic  health  units  (BHUs),  293  rural  health  centers  (RHCs); \nsecondary  care  facilities  including  77  tehsil  headquarter  hospitals  (THQs)  and  35  district \nheadquarter  hospitals  (DHQs)  for  inpatient  and  outpatient  care;  and  tertiary  care  facilities \n                                                 \n9  Campbell, Oona M. R., and Wendy J. Graham. 2006. Strategies for Reducing Maternal Mortality: Getting on with \n\nWhat Works.

Despite this elaborate infrastructure in the public \nsector, the majority (72%) of patients use the private sector.10 There was no significant increase \nin the utilization of services at BHUs and RHCs from1997 to 2006.11   \n\nThe  major  causes  of  underutilization  of  the  public  sector  are  unavailability  of  staff, \n16. \nunfriendly attitude of staff, short working hours, and lack of drugs. Recent provision of incentives \nand  rigorous  monitoring  by  the  Health  Sector  Reform  Program  (HSRP)  and  the  Punjab  Rural \nSupport  Program  (PRSP)  have  resulted  in  availability  of  staff  and  a  significant  reduction  in \nabsenteeism. As a result, a 30% increase in utilization at BHUs and RHC is reported.12 However, \nutilization of health facilities for deliveries and postnatal care continues to be unacceptably low. \nThis requires a serious rethink and new strategies. \n\nPrivate  Sector.  The private sector is concentrated in urban areas, and generally offers \n17. \ncurative care through small private office-based clinics. There are some 46 private hospitals in \nPunjab, with a range of 10 to over 100 beds, including small maternity homes with very basic \nequipment.  Considering  Punjab\u2019s  35  districts  and  the  number  of  private  hospitals  in  big  cities, \nthese  statistics  are  a  gross  underestimate  of  the  actual  number  of  private  hospitals  in  the \nprovince.  The  private  sector  also  includes  pharmacies  and  non-pharmacy  retail  outlets  from \nwhere, more often than not, an unqualified dispenser sells all kinds of prescription and over-the-\ncounter drugs.13    \n\n18. \nReferral  System.  The  referral  system  is  extremely  weak  and  largely  self-directed.  For \neffective  service  delivery  related  to  the  MNCH  services,  it  is  essential  that  all  services  from \ncommunity  level  to  DHQs  are  linked  in  a  chain  of  referral.  An  effective  referral  system  is \nparticularly  critical  when  it  comes  to  emergency  obstetric  care  where  efficient  referral  and \neffective handling of the referred case can prevent maternal death.  \n\n19 \nProcurement of Drugs. The shortage of drugs in a health facility is a major reason for \nlow utilization of the health facilities. The shortage is due to lower budgetary allocation as well \nas an inefficient procurement and drug-testing procedure.   \n\n4. \n\nHealth Human Resources  \n\n20. \nTo  implement  MNCH-related  MSDS  successfully,  there  is  a  critical  need  to  have  an \nadequate number of health workers (particularly WMOs, midwives, nurses, lady health visitors, \nand  paramedics)  with  adequate  skills  in  addressing  the  health  needs  of  mother  and  child. \nCurrently,  about  22%  of  the  approved  posts  for  various  health  workers  at  BHUs  and  RHCs  in \nPunjab are vacant, although GoPb has introduced various incentive schemes and the vacancies \nhave  been  gradually  reduced.  Among  medical  staff,  the  highest  proportion  (32%)  of  vacant \nposts14 is  for  the  WMO  who  is  expected  to  play  a  critical  role  in  preventing  maternal  death. \nSimilarly,  37%  of  the  approved  posts  for  nurses  at  BHUs  and  RHCs  are  vacant.  At  DHQs, \nalmost  one  third  of  the  approved  posts  of  gynecologists  and  anesthetists  are  vacant.  The \nsituation is even worst at THQs where 48% of the sanctioned posts for gynecologists and 59% \nfor anesthetists are vacant. \n\n                                                 \n10  Government of Pakistan. 2007.

Punjab. \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nIf MNCH-related MSDS is to be implemented effectively, then about an extra 27,068 new \n21. \nposts  will  be  required  to  be  sanctioned  and  filled.  This  comprises  664  specialists  including \ngynecologists/obstetricians,  anesthetists,  and  pediatricians;  about  1,550  medical  officers \nincluding  WMOs;  5,000  nurses;  3,000  each  of  lady  health  visitors  and  midwives;  and \n1,000 paramedical staff including operation theater technicians and lab technicians. Against this \nrequirement, Punjab produced 1,400\u20131,600 nurses and 78 and 351 lady health visitors  per year \nfrom  2004  to  2006,  who  cannot  all  be  expected  to  work  in  the  public  sector.  Although  the \nproduction  of  doctors  (Figure  A2.1)  including  female  doctors,  is  higher  than  nurses,  many \nfemale doctors have either left the profession after marriage, prefer being with their families, or \nfavor  shorter  working  hours  in  urban  areas.  The  availability  of  WMOs  for  rural  area  is  a \nchallenge.   \n \n\nFigure A2.1: Trends in Health Human Resource Production \n\n1947 \n\n1951 \n\n1961\n\n1971\n\n1981\n\n1991\n\n2001\n\nYear\n\n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank calculation on government of Punjab data. \n\nSource: ADB staff calculation on government of Punjab data. \n\nHealth facilities\n\nDoctors\n\nNurses\n\n \n \n22. \nApart from the insufficient quantity of health workers, quality is a serious issue. Medical \ntraining  institutions  in  Pakistan  produce  the  bulk  of  doctors  without  any  application  of  quality \nstandards,  and  the  quality  of  paramedics  is  also  below  the  requisite  standard.  The  entrance \nrequirement for dispensers is 10 years of schooling. Since 1947, only 34,599 dispensers have \nbeen qualified out of 1.2 million who appeared for the exam after 1 year of training. The quality \nof training offered is very low because of lack of conducive physical conditions and unavailability \nof  training  equipment  and  resources  at  the  training  institutions.  Consequently,  the  quality  of \nparamedics is low and they are inadequately prepared to offer the required quality of care.    \n \n23. \nFurthermore, issues of contract-based tenure of health care providers, no opportunity for \ncontinuing  education,  lack  of  effective  and  objective  appraisal,  and  no  incentive  for  good \nperformance are some factors leading to de-motivation.    \n\n24.  Mandatory  medicolegal  duty  by  WMOs  at  RHCs  is  a  deterring  factor.  WMOs  are  not \njoining  RHCs,  mainly  because  they  are  required  to  attend  to  medicolegal  cases  and \nconsequently face political pressures and harassment. As a result, there are hardly any WMOs \nat RHCs. This is one of the reasons that women do not come to health facilities for deliveries. \nRecently,  the  national  MNCH  program  succeeded  in  getting  an  approval  for  exemption  of \nWMOs from this requirement but it may take a while before this can be implemented.    \n\nNumber \n \nof \nWorkers \n100000\n90000 \n80000 \n70000 \n60000 \n50000 \n40000 \n30000 \n20000 \n \n10000 \n \n        0 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n \n41\n\n5. \n\nInfrastructure and Equipment Maintenance \n\n25. \nThe  trend  in  Pakistan  and  Punjab  shows  that,  once  the  facility  is  erected,  adequate \nallocation is never made toward its maintenance until the infrastructure is completely run-down. \nUnder  the  HSRP,  a  major  initiative  is  under  way  to  rehabilitate  facilities  but  several  BHUs \nlocated in remote villages have still not been renovated. Physically, the examination room and \nparticularly  the  labor  room  do  not  offer  sufficient  privacy  for  rural  women  to  be  comfortable  in \nreceiving medical care.    \n\n26. \nA  recent  study  showed  that,  in  both  the  public  and  private  sectors,  half  of  the  overall \nfacilities  had  operation  theaters  available  but  only  38%  were  functional.15 Currently,  there  are \nonly three workshops in Punjab for repair of such medical equipment, and they have very limited \ncapacity.  Therefore,  these  workshops  are  mostly  giving  no-objections  to  DHQs/THQs  to  go  to \nprivate  firms  for  maintenance.  However,  this  process  requires  time  and  energy  for  the  DHQ \nteam to secure a no-objection certificate allowing them to go to private firms for maintenance. \n\nB. \n\nHealth Care Financing  \n\n27. \nIn  Pakistan,  public  health  care  is  financed  by  three  different  levels  of  government: \nfederal,  provincial,  and  district. 16  Despite  this,  public  health  care  in  Pakistan  has  been \npersistently  underfinanced.  Per  capita  public  health  expenditure  is  the  lowest  among  South \nAsian countries (Table A2.2).  \n\nTable A2.2: Health Care Financing in South Asia (2004) \n\nItem \n\nPakistan \n\nBangladesh \n\nIndia \n\nNepal \n\nTotal expenditure on health as percentage \nof GDP (%) \nGovernment expenditure on health as \npercentage of total expenditure on health \n(%) \nGovernment expenditure on health as \npercentage of total government \nexpenditure (%) \n\nPer capita total expenditure on health ($)  \n \n\nPer capita government expenditure on \nhealth ($)  \n\n2.2\n\n19.6\n \n\n1.9 \n \n\n47.7\n \n\n9.4 \n \n\n3.1 \n\n28.1 \n \n\n5.9  \n \n\n64.3 \n \n\n18.1  \n \n\n \n \n5.0\n \n17.3\n\n \n2.9 \n\n \n91.4 \n\n \n15.8 \n\nSri \nLanka \n\n4.3 \n\n45.6 \n \n\n8.4  \n \n \n162.6  \n\n74.1  \n \n\n \n5.6 \n\n26.3  \n \n\n8.1  \n \n\n71.0 \n  \n\n18.6  \n \n\n  GDP = gross domestic product \n  Source: World Health Organization database. \n \nIn Punjab, public spending in the health sector has been growing over the past few years \n28. \nboth  in  absolute  terms  and  as  a  share  of  total  public  spending.  Nonetheless,  with  health \nspending still averaging only 8% of total public spending, additional funding is needed if Punjab \nis to meet the minimum requirements of the population\u2019s health needs.  \n\n                                                 \n15  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID).  2005.  Health  Facility  Assessment  Methods. \n\nWashington, DC (The Pakistan Initiative for Mothers and Newborn Project by USAID conducted in Lahore). \n\n16 The  2001  devolution  made  the  districts  responsible  for  primary  and  secondary  health  care,  which  is  the  key  to \nattaining MDGs, whereas the provincial Health Department has retained responsibility for the provision of tertiary \ncare services, medical education, and research and development; and has been given a major role in policy setting \nfor the health sector. \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n29. \nThe importance of public sector under-financing is more evident by examining per capita \nspending.  Against  a  benchmark  of  $30\u2013$40  per  capita  recommended  by  the  WHO  for \ndeveloping countries, per capita spending in Punjab was equal to PRS270.7 as of FY200717 and \nis  projected  to  increase  to  PRS420.93  in  FY2009.  Table  A2.3  shows  per  capita  spending  for \nprovincial  and  district  governments  separately.  The  low  per  capita  spending  at  the  district \ngovernment  level  points  to  severe  under-financing  of  primary  and  secondary  health  services, \nwhich are crucial for attainment of the MDGs.  \n\nTable A2.3: Per Capita Health Spending in Punjab \n\n \nItem \nPer capita health sector \nspending (PRs) \nPer capita health sector \nspending ($) \n\nFY2005 \nActual \n143.29 \n\nFY2006 \nActual \n179.94 \n\nFY2007 \nActual \n270.72 \n\nFY2008 \nRE \n358.72 \n\nFY2009a \nBE \n420.93 \n\n2.43 \n\n3.00 \n\n4.47 \n\n5.77 \n\n6.38 \n\nof which: \nProvincial ($) \nDistrict ($) \n\n \n1.22 \n1.21 \nBE = budget estimates, RE = revised estimates. \na For FY2009 the rupee\u2013US dollar exchange rate is assumed equal tot the average of the last quarter of FY2008 or \nPRs66 = $1.  \nSource:  Asian  Development  Bank  elaboration  on  government  of  the  Punjab  data;  International  Monetary  Fund \nstatistics on exchange rate for various years.  \n\n \n3.49 \n2.89 \n\n \n3.02 \n2.75 \n\n \n2.46 \n2.01 \n\n \n1.59 \n1.42 \n\n \n30.  Moreover, efficiency in the use of existing resources is an issue. Both at the provincial \nand  district  level,  recurrent  spending  (mostly  in  the  form  of  salaries)  absorbs  the  bulk  of \nresources. During FY2004 to FY2007, for which information on actual expenditures is available, \nrecurrent expenditures accounted for 80% of provincial government expenditures and more than \n90%  of  district  expenditures  on  average.  Conversely,  development  expenditures  are  almost \nnegligible. During the same period under consideration, more than 80% of development outlays \nwere from the provincial government budget.  \n\n31. \nThe  low  share  of  district  health  spending  (both  in  per  capita  terms  and  development \nspending) is a cause for concern, considering that district governments have been responsible \nfor financing and delivering both primary and secondary health care services, which are key to \nachieving  the  MDGs  and  reducing  poverty,  since  the  2001  devolution.  District  governments\u2019 \nability to provide adequate financing to the health sector is limited in many respects. Their low \nrevenue-raising  autonomy  and  the  rigidity  of  expenditures  considerably  reduce  flexibility  in \nresource  allocation.  Moreover,  under  the  devolved  setup,  district  governments\u2019  authority  to \napprove  investment  projects  is  limited  to  PRs50 million,  which  is  a  very  low  threshold.  This \nleaves the most expensive capital investment projects to the provincial and federal government \ninitiative. During FY2008, 45% of the provincial government\u2019s annual development plan for the \nhealth  sector  was  allocated  to  primary  and  secondary  health  care.  In  addition,  the  federal \ngovernment and the donor community funded several other initiatives. These multiple sources \nof funding target similar areas, which results in overlaps, high transaction costs, and inefficient \nallocation of financial and human resources. Although district governments are to some extent \ninvolved  in  implementation  of  the  vertical  and  donor-funded  programs,  they  seldom  have \nenough capacity to coordinate different interventions, which often carry competing requests. \n\n                                                 \n17 The corresponding figure for Pakistan as a whole was $9.4 as of FY2004.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n \n43\n\n \nB. \n\nPublic Health Financial Management  \n\n1. \n\nPublic Financial Management in Theory  \n\n32. \nThe  budget,  as  a  management  tool  for  economic  and  fiscal  planning,  is  the \ncommunication  of  a  plan  for  a  given  period  expressed  in  financial  terms,  and  is  a  means  of \ncontrolling and monitoring the use of funds. Effective planning of programs and activities should \nprecede  budget  preparation  so  that  the  main  policy  priorities  of  government  can  be  translated \ninto  manageable  components  and  subsequently  costed  to  determine  affordability.  Budget \npreparation should then follow at the end of this process.  \n \nEffective budget execution requires on the one hand that spending departments receive \n33. \nreliable information on available funds within which they can commit expenditure. This may be \nundermined by poor access to budget during the year and may lead to a downward revision of \nallocations in the revised budget estimates. On the other hand, basic management accounting \npractices throughout the year should enable management to analyze underperforming activities \nand  take  corrective  action  accordingly.  This  relies  on  the  preparation  of  systematic  financial \nreports,  and  constant  checking  and  verification  of  the  bookkeeping  and  recording  practices  of \nbudget.  Important  reconciliations  should  be  undertaken  on  a  regular  (daily,  weekly,  monthly) \nbasis  to  ensure  accuracy  in  recording,  reliability  in  reporting,  and  control  to  ensure  that \nadequate checks and balances exist at key points in the system.  \n \n34. \nThe  quality  of  the  internal  control  systems  within  an  organization  affects  the  fiduciary \nenvironment,  hence  the  efficiency  of  public  spending.  Organizations  and  their  systems  are \nsusceptible  to  weaknesses  and  risks,  resulting  in  the  possibility  of  poor  performance,  error \nand/or  abuse.  Senior  management,  therefore,  introduces  and  maintains  control  procedures  to \nensure that organizational objectives are achieved and public standards are met. Internal audit, \nin turn, relies on the presence of an adequate, effective, and reliable set of internal controls. The \ninternal  audit  department  of  any  organization  is  an  integral  part  of  the  management  of  that \norganization. It can be defined as an independent, objective assurance and consulting activity \ndesigned  to  add  value  and  improve  an  organization\u2019s  operations.  It  helps  an  organization \naccomplish  its  objectives  by  bringing  a  systematic,  disciplined  approach  to  evaluate  and \nimprove the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes. \n \n35. \nUnlike  internal  auditors,  external  auditors  are  independent  of  the  organization,  and \nprovide  an  annual  opinion  on  the  financial  statements.  The  work  of  the  internal  and  external \nauditors should be coordinated for optimal effectiveness and efficiency. The primary mission of \nthe  external  auditors  is  to  provide  an  independent  opinion  on  the  organization\u2019s  financial \nstatements  annually.  Their  approach  is  historical  in  nature,  as  they  assess  whether  the \nstatements conform to generally accepted accounting principles, whether they fairly present the \nfinancial  position  of  the  organization,  whether  the  results  of  operations  for  a  given  period  are \naccurately represented, and whether the financial statements have been materially affected. \n \n\n2. \n\nBudget Formulation and Execution by the Health Department and District \nGovernments \n\n36. \nThe  GoPb  prepares  two  budgets\u2014the  annual  development  budget  and  the  recurrent \nbudget.  The  two  budget  setting  processes  are  entirely  separate  exercises,  with  insufficient \nconsideration  of  the  links  between  the  two.  In  the  Health  Department,  incremental  budgeting \nserves to perpetuate inefficiencies and imbalances in inputs and resource allocation decisions. \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nInvolvement in budget preparation remains at the lower levels of the department, with the result \nthat the sight of goals and objectives for the health sector can be lost along with an opportunity \nto  develop  a  budget  based  on  the  agreed  priorities  for  health  service  delivery.  The  budget \nexercise has poor credibility as actual expenditures considerably differ from the original budget \nestimates,  whereas  revised  estimates  produced  in  March  heavily  overestimate  the  actual \nspending capacity of the department. Figure A2.2 illustrates the trend of underspending of the \nHealth  Department  budget  and  shows  the  systematic  tendency  to  inflate  revised  estimates \ntoward the end of the fiscal year. Figure A2.3 shows how the lack of budget credibility is more \nsevere for the development budget compared to the recurrent budget.  \n \n\nFigure A2.2: Credibility of the Budget in Health Department \n\nFY2004 \n\nFY2005\n\nFY2006\n\nFY2007\n\nFY2008 \n\nOverestimate (RE/Actual)\n\nUnderspending (Actual/BE) \n\nBE = budget estimates, RE = revised estimates. \nActual figures for FY2008 are up to April 2008.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank calculation on government of Punjab data.         \n \n\n \n\n140% \n120% \n100% \n80% \n60% \n40% \n20% \n0% \n-20% \n-40% \n-60% \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n \n45\n\nFigure A2.3: Budget Credibility of Health Department \nRecurrent and Development\n\n  \n\n200% \n\n150% \n\n100% \n\n50% \n\n0%\n\n-50% \n\n-100%\n\nFY2004 \n\nFY2005\n\nFY2006\n\nFy2007\n\nFY2008\n\nOverestimate (Recurrent; RE/Actual))\n\nUnderspending (Recurrent; Actual/BE) \n\nOverestimate (Development; RE/Actual)\n\nUnderspending (Development; Actual/BE) \n\nBE = budget estimates, RE = revised estimates. \nActual figures for FY2008 are up to April 2008.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank calculation on government of the Punjab data.  \n\n \n\n \n\nAs access to funds is not smooth throughout the year, departments tend to concentrate \n37. \nmost  of  the  outlays  in  the  last  quarter.  The  capacity  to  spend  according  to  allocations  also \nremains limited, which may be due to low absorptive capacity and/or poor expenditure planning. \nThe  latter  aspect  is  particularly  severe  in  the  case  of  the  development  budget,  where  poor \ncapacity  to  plan  investment  projects  and  the  political  economy  of  the  annual  development \nprogram  result  in  implementation  delays  and  a  substantial  part  of  the  development  budget  is \ncarried over to the next year\u2019s budget.  \n \nProper financial management relies on the possibility to analyze the links between policy \n38. \nand budgetary allocations. This is currently not possible in the health sector in Punjab. Financial \nmanagement  in  the  province  is  constrained  by  widespread  unavailability  of  reliable  financial \ninformation with which to analyze expenditures in the health sector against policy objectives and \npriorities. While plenty of financial data is available, much of it is inconsistent and gives little or \nno indication of how much is spent, where, and on what.  \n \n39. \nAs  a  result,  performance  measurement,  both  physical  and  financial,  is  not  possible \nbecause  of  lack  of  an  integrated  and  informed  budget  statement\u2014the  split  between \nnondevelopment  and  development  and  between  the  various  separate  development  initiatives. \nThe  development  budget  is  not  structured  using  the  Project  for  Improved  Financial  Reporting \nand Accounting (PIFRA) classifications (although they are broadly similar). Hence, alignment or \nanalysis  of  budgets  and  expenditures  using  these  codes  is  not  possible,  making  it  difficult  to \nidentify the flow of public resources into the same sector or program from the two budgets. By \nhaving appropriate links between the structure of how the budget is prepared and policy goals, \nthe  Health  Department  should  be  able  to  establish  the  amount  of  funds  allocated  toward  a \ncertain  policy  objective.  This  will  require  classification  of  the  budget  at  all  levels  of  the  health \nsector on the basis of \u201cpolicy aligned\u201d subfunctional or program classification codes. \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nAt  both  the  provincial  and  district  level,  there  is  an  absence  of  consolidated  financial \n40 \nreporting  showing  budget  execution  for  the  various  health  programs  and  spending  units.  At \ndistrict level, the executive district officer (EDO), Health does not have a comprehensive picture \nof  what  resources  are  being  consumed  by  facilities  in  his  or  her  district.  No  regular  financial \nstatements on budget utilization are prepared, which would enable the EDO, Health to measure \nperformance  against  planned  targets  and  as  such,  he  or  she  is  unable  to  manage  programs \neffectively  and  hold  staff  and  facilities  responsible  for  delivery  of  services.  Similarly,  the \nsecretary  of  health,  as  the  principal  accounting  officer,  has  little  access  to  any  consolidated \nfinancial  information  at  any  significant  level  to  scrutinize  properly  the  performance  of \nsubordinate  officers,  facilities,  or  spending  units,  let  alone  having  an  overview  of  overall \nresource allocation and financial performance in the public health sector.    \n\n3. \n\nInternal Control  \n\n41. \nInternal  controls  are  the  various  checks  and  balances  set  within  an  organization  to \nsafeguard  the  integrity  of  expenditure.  They  are  a  critical  part  of  public  expenditure \nmanagement and governance more generally. On the one hand, there is in a formal sense an \nextensive system of internal controls, including well-documented approval processes; numerous \nmanuals  and  guidelines,  including  the  GoPb\u2019s  financial  rules  and  regulations,  the  purchase \nmanual,  and  standardized  registers;  a  well-entrenched,  hierarchical,  \u201capprovals  culture  by \ndocumentation\u201d;  and  an  extensive\u2014albeit  manual\u2014\u201cpaper  trail\u201d.  On  the  other  hand,  these \ninternal  controls  are  often  cumbersome  and  administratively  burdensome.  More  importantly, \nwhile  the  internal  controls  are  in  principle  generally  sound  and  sensible,  they  are  in  practice \nadhered  to  in  a  weak  and  uneven  manner.  There  is  limited  technical  capacity  to  implement \nprocedures  in  the  way  envisaged,  and  weak  supervision  and  enforcement,  especially  at  the \ndistrict  government  level.  However,  there  are  improvements\u2014the  PIFRA  is  streamlining  the \nchart  of  accounts  and  financial  management,  and  enabling  quicker  and  more  accurate \nreconciliation of accounting information via an electronic rather than manual system.  \n\nPunjab\u2019s  system  of  internal  controls  against  the  internationally  recognized  internal \n\n42. \ncontrol benchmarks are as follows: \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nSegregation of duties. Segregation of duties does exist in the health sector. For \nexample,  in  a  DHQ  hospital  setting,  goods  are  ordered  by  a  medical \nsuperintendent;  received  and  recorded  by  a  storekeeper;  and  processing  of \npayment against supplier\u2019s invoice is done by the hospital\u2019s accounts staff, which \nis then authorized by the district accounts officer (DAO) to release the payment \ndirectly  in  supplier\u2019s  bank  account.  However,  in  this  whole  process,  the  vested \ninterest plays its role at almost every stage to defeat the spirit of segregation of \npowers.  \n\nEffective  organizational  structures.  The  current  organizational  structure  does \nnot  facilitate  effective,  efficient,  or  transparent  financial  management  and \nfinancial flows. The existence of national, provincial, and district organizations\u2014\nall providing separate aspects, and funding, for health care\u2014is problematic. This \nsituation  is  likely  to  be  exacerbated  if  another  layer  at  divisional  level  is \nintroduced,  or  certain \nthe  provincial \ngovernment, thus fracturing the referral chain from primary to secondary levels. \n\nlevel  hospitals  returned \n\ntertiary \n\nto \n\nAppropriate  levels  of  authorization  and  approval  adhered  to.  Rules  on \ndelegation of financial powers in Punjab exist, and were revised in 2006 to take \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n \n47\n\ninto  effect  the  structural  and  fiscal  changes  brought  in  by  devolution.  However, \nadherence to these approval limits remains an issue. Noncompliance with these \nrules and regulations occurs at both the district and provincial levels. Many of the \npending  audit  observations  relate \nthe  noncompliance  with  rules  and \nto \nregulations.18 \n\nPhysical  safeguards.  These  are  necessary  to  protect  personnel,  assets, \nsystems,  and  records.  In  the  Health  Department,  management  review  and \nmonitoring  of  assets  does  not  take  place  in  a  systematic  manner,  nor  controls \nprovided by external audit, which is confined to the audit of financial statements \nonly.  Under  current  arrangements,  the  payroll  function  (preparation  of  payroll \nbudgets,  payment  of  salaries,  posting  of  costs  to  the  PIFRA  system,  etc.)  is  a \nfunction of the DAO\u2019s office, with the obligation on the drawing and disbursement \nofficers in each line department to notify the DAO of any changes in personnel. \nUnder these shared responsibilities, there is little to prevent (or even detect at a \nlater date) a drawing and disbursement officer from retaining the salary paid for a \nmember of staff who has left the service.   \n\nManagement review and monitoring. Under the present arrangements, there is \nlittle  evidence,  if  any,  of  monitoring  to  ensure  that  personnel  understand  the \nsystems,  processes,  procedures,  and  activities  established  by  management. \nExpenditure  management  and  tracking  is  missing  across  the  whole  system. \nMostly, time is spent on budget preparation, execution, and recording of financial \ninformation in the prescribed books of accounts. Arrangements exist wherein the \ndrawing and disbursement officers reconcile their expenditure with the DAO on a \nmonthly  basis.  This  is  the  only  form  of  reconciliation  that  takes  place  at  the \ndistrict  level.  There  is  little,  if  any,  analytical  or  diagnostic  work\u2014including \nvariance accounting\u2014so it is not possible for the Government to satisfy itself that \nexpenditures are being allocated or aligning with its core priorities.   \n\nAccounting  and  arithmetical  controls. These exist only in the DAO\u2019s office at \ndistrict  level  and  in  the  Accountant  General\u2019s  Office  for  provincial  expenditures. \nThere is very limited adherence, at any level in the health sector, to statutory and \nother  professional  requirements  to  maintain  proper  accounts,  ledger  balances, \nand reconciliation procedures; and to ensure transactions are correctly recorded \nand processed. \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n(vii)  Appropriate  personnel  and  staffing  levels.  The  numbers  and  levels  of \napproved  staffing  positions  responsible  for  financial  management  are  poorly \nallocated  between  province  and  district.  However,  it  is  clear  that  the  technical \ncapacity and professional qualifications of staff remain a challenge. Particularly at \nthe district government level, there is a noticeable absence of trained or qualified \naccounting  officials  and/or \nto  manage  and  supervise \ninternal  auditors \nexpenditures and procurement.    \n\n(viii)  Effective  supervision  of  controls  and  systems.  Reliance  on  pre-audit  and \nexternal audit as substitutes for internal controls has increased fiduciary risk at all \nlevels  of  government  in  Punjab.  Internal  audit  remains  very  weak,  especially  at \ndistrict levels.  \n\n                                                 \n18 World Bank. 2005. Punjab Public Financial Management and Accountability Assessment. Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n4. \n\nInternal Audit  \n\n42. \nInternational  accounting  standards  dictate  that  any  organization  should  have  effective \ninternal  audit.  The  internal  audit  function  is  an  integral  part  of  the  organization\u2019s  management \nand it is based on the presence of an adequate, effective, and reliable set of internal controls. \nThe findings and recommendations included in a standard internal audit report are reported to \nthe  management  of  the  organization,  which  should  then  act  upon  these  recommendations. \nSubsequent  internal  audits  would  begin  with  previous  recommendations  and  whether  or  not \nmanagement  has  acted  in  response.  Internal  audit  work  can,  and  often  is,  relied  upon  by \nexternal  auditors  to  help  target  the  time-limited  external  audit  to  areas  of  greatest  control \nweakness and to avoid duplication. \n\nIn the health sector and in Punjab in general, the internal audit function is not effective. \n43. \nAlthough  the  internal  audit  wing  in  the  Health  Department  exists,  the  director  and  deputy \ndirector posts are vacant. The \u201cconfidential\u201d nature of the internal audit reports, unclear role and \ndirection of the internal audit wing, its reporting line to the additional secretary for establishment, \nand the absence of any training for the audit team are symptoms of the poor effectiveness of the \ninternal audit function in the health sector.  \n\n44. \nAt  the  district  government  level,  the  internal  audit  function  is  non-existent.  Although \nmandated  by  the  Punjab  Local  Government  Ordinance  (PLGO),  very  few  nazims  (district \nmayors)  have  appointed  internal  auditors.  There  is,  from  the  part  of  the  district  governments\u2019 \nbureaucracy, a generalized mistrust toward the internal audit function mostly because it reports \nto  the  nazim.  This  is  in  fact  a  flaw  in  the  PLGO  since  the  internal  auditor  should  report  to  the \ndistrict coordination officer as the chief executive of the district. This problem is compounded by \nthe lack of clear terms of service and job descriptions for the internal auditors, which make their \nappointment  even  more  controversial.  According  to  some  GoPb  officials,  in  those  few  cases \nwhere  an  internal  auditor  has  been  appointed  by  nazims,  patronage  has  prevailed  with  little \nregard to the professional qualifications of the appointee.  \n\n5. \n\nExternal Audit  \n\nThe  auditor  general  of  Pakistan  is  responsible  for  external  audit  of  both  the  provincial \n45. \nand district governments. Both provincial and district director generals for audit offices conduct \nsystematic  external  audit  of  provincial  and  district  governments\u2019  entities.  They  mostly  perform \nfinancial audit, but in the case of the provincial office, risk-based audit and performance audit of \nselected  functions  of  selected  spending  agencies  is  also  carried  out.  The  external  audit  also \ncomprises a compliance testing with internal controls for a given institution and this is reportedly \none of the high-risk areas for many institutions within the Health Department. Based on the audit \nobservations raised by the director general for audit, the Health Department should convene the \nDepartmental  Accounts  Committee,  which  is  chaired  by  the  secretary,  to  address  the  audit \nobservations  raised  by  the  external  audit.  It  is  not  clear,  however,  to  what  extent  the \nDepartmental  Accounts  Committee  is  regularly  convened  and  audit  observations  cleared.  A \nsimilar  situation  is  found  at  the  district  governments\u2019  level,  where  there  is  poor  follow-up  on \nexternal audit observations.   \n\nPunjab health sector analysis shows that it is unlikely to achieve MDGs unless the health \n46. \nsector is effectively reformed to make good quality MNCH services accessible to the masses in \nPunjab.

Recruitment is also in \nprocess and some posts have been filled at \nfacilities. The waiver of the medicolegal work \nhas been granted to WMOs at RHCs.  \n \nCommunity midwives will be trained to \nconduct deliveries at home in order to \nincrease the number of deliveries by skilled \nbirth attendants.  \n \nHealth Sector Reform Program (HSRP) \nstarted in 2006, based on the health sector \nreform framework, to achieve MDGs by \nstrengthening primary and secondary health \ncare. The development budget allocation for \n\nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX \n\n \nAsian Development Bank \nPunjab Devolved Social Services \nProgram (PDSSP) is a multi-sector and \nmultidimensional governance reform \nprogram ($210 million). It aims to address \ngovernance, financing, and technical \nconstraints for devolved service delivery in \nthe health, education, special education, and \nwater supply and sanitation sectors. \nReforms under the PDSSP seek three \nprincipal policy outcomes: (i) realigning \nintergovernmental relations to support \ndevolved social services; (ii) rationalizing \nand setting minimum standards for social \nservices; and (iii) strengthening public \naccountability mechanisms and promoting \npublic\u2013private partnerships (PPPs).   \n \nThe PDSSP has contributed to \n(i) articulating and clarifying devolution \namong local governments by developing a \ncompendium of local government laws, \nrules, and regulations that has been \ncirculated free of cost to all local \ngovernments; (ii) building local government \nplanning capacity through introduction of the \nannual sector planning process, later \nchanged into the 3-year rolling plan; \n(iii) bridging financing gaps and introducing \nresource allocation through conditional \ngrants. These have made possible timely \ntransfers of funds to local governments in a \ntransparent manner, helped to bridge \nfinancing gaps, assisted local governments \nto improve social service delivery, and \npaved the way for introducing transparent \nrules-based resource allocation; \n\nOther Multilateral/ \nBilateral Donors \nJapan International Cooperation Agency \n(JICA) has assisted the Government of \nPakistan to develop the district health \ninformation system. The Government of \nPunjab (GoPb) has already introduced \ndistrict health information system in 10 \ndistricts and will roll it out to all 35 districts. \nAll primary and secondary health facilities \nwill input data at the facility, and the district \nand provincial governments are able to \nanalyze the data.  \n \nUnited States Agency for International \nDevelopment (USAID): The Pakistan \nInitiative for Mothers and Newborn \nProject (PAIMAN) is a 5-year project for \n$50 million. It covers four districts in Punjab \n(Jhelum, Rawalpindi, D.G Khan, and \nKhanewal) and 15 more districts should be \ncovered in the whole country.  \n \nPAIMAN\u2019s goal is to reduce maternal, \nnewborn, and child mortality in Pakistan \nthrough viable and demonstrable initiatives, \nand capacity building of existing programs \nand structures within health systems and \ncommunities. The project has completed \ncivil works in selected health facilities in four \ndistricts in Punjab. It has also provided \nequipment to facilities relating to MNCH and \nambulances. It has trained midwives and \nlady health workers in counseling skills and \nestablishing support groups for birth \npreparedness. Four functional district health \nmanagement teams are working in Punjab. \nTeam members have been trained in \n\n \n\n \n\n\fGovernment-Funded \nPrograms \nthe HSRP in FY2009 is PRs2.8 billion, which \nis 45% of the total health sector \ndevelopment budget.  \n \nThe HSRP has invested in rehabilitation of \nprimary health care facilities, and introduced \nmonetary incentives to medical doctors \nposted at basic health units (BHUs). The \nprogram tries to streamline paramedical \neducation and standardize its quality. \nPreparation for job descriptions of \nparamedics is ongoing.   \n \nThe program uses independent monitoring \nand evaluation assistants to monitor BHUs\u2019 \nand RHCs\u2019 performance regularly. As a \nresult, doctors\u2019 absenteeism has declined. \nImplementation of the HSRP has been \nextended its operation to secondary health \ncare facilities.  \n \nChief minister\u2019s initiative for primary \nhealth care managed by the Punjab Rural \nSupport Program (PRSP) commenced in \n2003 in one district (Rahim Yar Khan) and \nwas later replicated in 11 other districts. The \nPRSP signs a 5-year contract with the \nHealth Department for managing health \nservices at BHUs and RHCs. Initially, the \nprogram received PRs500 million as an \nendowment fund from the government of \nPunjab to cover the management costs. In \n2003, additional funds were granted to cover \nthe capital costs and overhead costs. The \nPRSP also receives funding from the district \ngovernments for BHUs and RHCs as one \nline transfer. The PRSP has authority to \nallocate the budget to various activities as \n\n \nAsian Development Bank \n\n(iv) introducing minimum service delivery \nstandard in the health, education, special \neducation, and water supply and sanitation \nsectors in the province. The standards \nprovide benchmarks for regulators, service \nproviders, and users as well as changes in \nservice delivery; (v) strengthening \nmonitoring through the development of \nsystematic monitoring frameworks for \nprovincial and local governments. These \nmeasures have helped to improve the \naccountability mechanisms of both provincial \nand local governments; and (vi) enhancing \nPPP through the development of a well-\ndefined PPP strategy.  \n \nPunjab Resource Management Program \n(PRMP) started in 2003 with the aim of \nenhancing the effectiveness of public \nfinancial management in Punjab \n($400 million). The program introduced a \nwide range of reforms in the areas of \n(i) fiscal space creation; (ii) improved \nefficiency and transparency in the allocation \nand utilization of funds; (iii) increased pro-\npoor orientation of spending and service \ndelivery; and (iv) created an enabling \nenvironment for private sector development. \n \nUnder subprogram 1 (January 2003\u2013\nJune 2005), fiscal space creation initiatives \nled to improved allocations to social sectors, \nincluding health and education. Under the \nprogram, GoPb prepared a poverty \nreduction strategy paper that culminated in \nthe preparation of a medium-term poverty-\nfocused investment strategy, which links \nstrategic outcomes and targets from the \n\nOther Multilateral/ \nBilateral Donors \n\nplanning, financial management, logistics \nmanagement, and in supportive supervision. \n \nUnited Nation Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) \nsupported the immunization of 32 million \nchildren nationwide against polio, and 30 \nmillion against measles. It also supported \nthe Government\u2019s Multiple Indicators Cluster \nSurvey (MICS) in 2003\u20132004. This was an \nimportant achievement because it provided \nthe Government with a rigorous, \ninternationally recognized evidence base for \nidentifying achievements and gaps in \nsocioeconomic outcomes related to the \nMDGs. The UNICEF Safe Motherhood \nInitiative Project has piloted safe \nmotherhood initiatives in Sheikhupura \ndistrict of Punjab. Major outputs and \noutcomes include the availability of a team \nof medical professionals on a 24-hour basis \nin the district and tehsil (town) headquarter \nhospitals; an increase of 11 times in facility \ndeliveries (from 571 in 2003 to 6,063 in \n2006); and 9,558 obstetric complications \ntreated during FY2005, averting deaths and \nmorbidity of mothers and newborns. \nAntenatal care increased from 43% in 2004 \nto 58% in 2006. Skilled birth attendance also \nincreased from 32% to 37%.  \n \nThe World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) \ncountry cooperation program 2005\u20132009 \nhas seven strategic priorities: (i) health \npolicy and system development; (ii) health of \nwomen and children; (iii) partnership, \nresource mobilization, and coordination; \n(iv) communicable disease control, \n(v) noncommunicable disease control, \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n5\n\ni\n\n \n\n5\n3\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f5\n4\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n5\n \n\ni\n\nGovernment-Funded \nPrograms \nappropriate. \n \nThe program provides primary health care \nservices through 845 BHUs, 184 RHCs, \n14 maternal and child health centers, and 6 \ndispensaries. It is working with 661 medical \nprofessionals and more than 4,000 other \nstaff. During FY2007, almost 1.5 million \nvisits were recorded for gynecological and \nrelated services in the 12 districts. A typical \nBHU in a PRSP district sees on average 21 \nmore patients per day than a non-PRSP \ndistrict. The biggest achievement of the \nPRSP is increased availability of doctors, \nparticularly WMOs.  \n \nPunjab Integrated Primary Health Care \nModel Program is being implemented by \nthe Health Department with support from the \nNational Commission for Human \nDevelopment (NCHD). \n \nThe program was approved in August 2007 \nfor the duration of 45 months. The total cost \nestimate is PRs3.377 billion. NCHD \nprograms are public\u2013private partnerships, \nbetween NCHD and the Government of \nPakistan.  \n \nThe program was initially piloted in the \ndistrict of Gujrat and is being replicated in \nanother 11 districts.  \n \nNCHD aims to promote human development \nby supporting government line departments, \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), and \nelected officials at the district level in primary \neducation, literacy, and provision of basic \n\n \nAsian Development Bank \n\nstrategy paper with expenditure \ncommitments in the medium-term budget \nframework. Under the program, key \ndepartments concerned with service delivery \n(such as health, education, and municipal \nservices) prepared sector-specific strategies \nto improve service delivery outcomes. The \nHSRP, which represents the GoPb vision for \nhealth sector reform has been prepared \nunder the aegis of subprogram 1.  \n \nAnother important contribution of \nsubprogram 1 to improved service delivery \nis initiation of the MICS. The first MICS was \ncompleted in FY2004 and it provides \nimportant baseline indicators for health, \neducation, and water supply and sanitation \nat the district level.  \n \nSubprogram 2 (July 2005\u2013June 2007), \ncarried forward and consolidated reforms \ninitiated under subprogram 1. Fiscal space \ncreation was further pursued and \nrationalization of expenditure was achieved \nthrough reduction of interest payments by \nswapping high-interest cash development \nloans from the federal Government with less \ncostly borrowings from international donors. \nDuring the PRMP, a total of $300 million in \ncash development loans was retired by the \nGoPb. Subprogram 2 supported \nrevitalization of the Punjab Health \nFoundation tasked to develop different \nmodels for PPPs in the health sector.  \n \nPunjab Government Efficiency \nImprovement Program (PGEIP), building \non the foundation laid by the PRMP, assists \n\nOther Multilateral/ \nBilateral Donors \n\n(vi) social determinants of health; and \n(vii) emergency preparedness.  \n \nCanadian International Development \nAgency: Systems-Oriented Health \nInvestment Program is being implemented \nin the two district governments of Pakpatan \nand Mianwal for a total cost of \nCan$7 million. Its goal is to strengthen \ndistrict governments\u2019 systems for improved \nhealth care service provision, particularly to \nwomen, by integrating prevention and health \npromotion in Punjab Province. The program \nis a capacity-building project for health \nservice providers and managers; and aims \nto develop tools, processes, and systems for \nbetter service delivery. In the two project \ndistricts, the program has supported district \nhealth management teams in developing a \ncomprehensive district health plan and \nintroducing the district health information \nsystem. Support has also been provided to \nPunjab Medical Faculty in strengthening the \ntraining program for dispensers. \n \nWorld Bank: Project to Improve Financial \nReporting and Auditing (PIFRA) aims to \ntighten internal controls, modernize audit \nprocedures, and improve the financial \naccounting and information system. PIFRA I \nwas completed in July 2005 and PIFRA II \nstarted in 2006 (completion expected in \nJuly 2010).  \n \nThe general objectives of PIFRA are to  \n1.  build capacity to improve the accuracy, \ncomprehensiveness, reliability, and \ntimeliness of financial reporting at all \n\n \n\n \n\n\fGovernment-Funded \nPrograms \nhealth care services. NCHD is a fast-track \ninitiative to improve social sector outcomes \nat the grassroots level. The primary health \ncare extension program aims at \nstrengthening preventive health care in \nremote areas not covered by the National \nLady Health Workers Program. Specifically, \nNCHD aims to reduce infant mortality by \n33%, maternal mortality by 25%, and \npopulation growth rate to less than 2%. \n \nThe NCHD program covers 919 BHUs for a \ntotal population of 22.7 million. RHCs within \nexisting districts and new districts will be \nadded in phase II. The program has \nrecruited additional 1,323 lady health \nworkers out of 1,470 planned to be recruited \nunder the program. The current household \ncoverage is estimated to be 91%. The \nprogram has also recruited 470 of 561 lady \nhealth worker supervisors that are planned \nto be recruited under this program.  \n \nUnder the school health program, about \n34,719 teachers were trained and so far \n598,413 students are claimed to have been \nscreened for eye, ear, teeth, and skin \nproblems. Meanwhile, the deworming \nintervention is in process.  \n \n \n\n \nAsian Development Bank \n\nthe GoPb\u2019s key reform areas:  \n(i) efficient public financial management; \n(ii) a fully funded and well-governed civil \nservice pension system; (iii) civil service \nreforms for attaining a responsive, efficient, \nand effective civil service; (iv) broadening \nmeasures to support private sector \ndevelopment for economic growth, job \ncreation, and poverty reduction; \n(v) attainment of MDGs by 2015; and \n(vi) improving access to justice to enhance \nlegal and regulatory certainty and \nenforceability in all economic spheres. \n \nThe PGEIP consists of a cluster of three \nsubprograms. Subprogram 1 was completed \nin October 2007. Under the fiscal and \nfinancial management component, efforts to \nconsolidate the medium-term budget \nframework exercise have been undertaken \nwith specific emphasis on active \ninvolvement of the line departments in the \npreparation of 3-year rolling budget \nestimates. The Health Department in Punjab \nhas been included as a pilot department in \nthis endeavor. As part of the reform efforts \nundertaken by the Health Department, a \nstrategy and policy unit has been created \nwith the purpose of building capacity within \nthe department to develop a medium-term \nstrategy for the sector.  \n\nOther Multilateral/ \nBilateral Donors \n\nlevels of government; \n\n2.  directly support improved public \n\nfinancial management, accountability, \nand transparency;  \n\n3.  enhance the capacity of public sector \nmanagers to use credible financial \ninformation for better and informed \ndecision-making; and \nfacilitate oversight of the use of public \nmonies, and increase the credibility of \ngovernment financial statements and \nassurance processes. \n\n4. \n\n \nIn Punjab (as in all other provinces), the \nPIFRA reforms and the new accounting \nmodel have seen a revision of the \nclassification codes used in the GoPb, and \nthe chart of accounts that the Accountant \nGeneral\u2019s Office uses to prepare budget \nestimates and actual expenditures. The \nPIFRA SAP3 system has been used for \n2 financial years in Punjab and has been \nextended to all 35 district account offices. In \nPunjab, pilot testing of the budgeting \nmodule has started in the education and \nirrigation departments, and 10 other \ndepartments are preparing to roll this out in \nFY2009 (including the Health Department).  \n \n \n\n \n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n5\n\ni\n\n \n\n5\n5\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nDEVELOPMENT POLICY LETTER \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n57 \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n59 \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n61 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n62 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n63 \n\nPOLICY MATRIX  \n \n\nSubprogram 2 \nTentative  \nBy the end of 2009 \n\nSubprogram 3 \nTentative \nBy the end of 2010 \n\nOutputs \n\nSubprogram 1 \nBy October  2008  \n\n1.

Consequently, each district has to prepare its \nown  plan  of  action  and  budget  to  reach  the  district  health  goals.  The  Punjab  Devolved  Social \nServices  Program  (PDSSP) 1 introduced  the  annual  sector  plan  exercise  as  a  condition  for \nreceiving PDSSP tied grants; this evolved to be the 3-year rolling sector plan. Under the Punjab \nMillennium  Development  Goals  Program  (PMDGP),  district  governments  are  expected  to \nreceive  conditional  grants  to  augment  financial  resources  for  the  health  sector,  especially  to \nimplement  maternal,  neonatal,  and  child  health-related  minimum  service  delivery  standards \n(MSDS). The district governments will be required to include the MSDS implementation plan in \nthe 3-year rolling plan and utilize the conditional grants according to the plan. \n \n2 \nThe  existing  capacity  of  district  governments  to  prepare  a  good  plan  is  still  limited. \nTraining  has  been  given  by  the  PDSSP  and  various  programs  but  the  skills  have  been  lost \nbecause of frequent transfers of staff. One-time training is not sufficient to develop capacity. A \nteam of experts devoted to continuous training of district governments and technical assistance \nwill  be  housed  in  the  Office  of  Director  General,  Health  Services  (ODGHS).  To  assist  district \ngovernments  in  preparing  plans,  a  team  of  health  planning  (2),  monitoring  and  evaluation  (2), \nfinancial management (2), and public health (2) specialists will be constituted. The team will visit \ndistricts and provide technical support and facilitate their planning process. In the long run, such \na team of experts should be an integral part of ODGHS. \n  \nThe  team  will  support  and  build  the  capacity  of  district  governments,  especially  the \n3. \nexecutive  district  officers  (EDOs),  Health,  in  all  the  districts  to  prepare  an  evidence-based \n3-year  rolling  sector  plan,  and  to  establish  a  mechanism  at  ODGHS  and  EDOs,  Health  to \nmonitor execution of the plans. The team\u2019s tasks are to do the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nImprove the format of the 3-year rolling plan to clearly indicate inputs required for \nproducing the district health goals and meeting MSDS requirements. The format \nshould include the financial sources for each activity.  \nProduce  customized  training  and  capacity-building  sessions  for  districts  to \ndevelop \na.  3-year \n\nrolling  sector  plans \n\ninclude  MSDS \n\nimplementation,  and   \n\nthat \n\nrealistically budget the plan; \n\nb.  a built-in mechanism for monitoring and evaluation; \nc.  activity-based budgeting leading to appropriate resource allocation; and \nd.  an advocacy tool for attracting funds for health sector. \nProvide onsite technical assistance to district governments in preparing the plans \nand budgets.  \nDevelop  tools  to  monitor  execution  of  the  plan,  and  help  the  staff  of  district \ngovernments use the tools in monitoring the execution of district health plans.  \nEstablish  a  mechanism  for  regularly  preparing  a  summary  quarterly  report \nsubmitted  to  ODGHS,  highlighting  the  progress  and  expenditure  made  in \nimplementing  the  plan.  Such  report  should  be  prepared  in  conjunction  with  the \nreport from the district health information system (DHIS) in such a way to avoid \nduplication. \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2004.

The  creation  of  a  financial \nmanagement  cell  (FMC)  will  be  the  core  unit  for  driving  financial  reforms  in  the  Health \nDepartment and the spending agencies that it funds, and for collecting budget and expenditure \ninformation from district health departments. \n\n2. \n\nThe following initial key tasks will be performed by the FMC: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nEnsure strict adherence, by all budget/accounting and drawing and disbursement \nstaff in the Health Department and its spending agencies, to budget preparation \nprinciples. \n\nRevise,  coordinate,  and  monitor  the  budget  preparation  calendars  to  assist  the \nhealth  budget  ceiling  committee  in  securing  the  accurate  and  timely  completion \nof  budget  estimates  in  the  medium-term  budgetary  framework  format;  and  to \ncoordinate  production  of  the  departmental  strategic  review  for  the  Health \nDepartment. \n\nBe  the  focal  point  in  the  Health  Department  for  the  Finance  Department  and \nPlanning  and  Development  Department  in  budget  preparation  to  ensure \nefficiency in the transfer of budgetary information to and from these departments \nto the Health Department. \n\nDevelop  procedures  and  systems  for  the  production  of  budget  (detailed  and \nconsolidated)  information  on  all  activities  in  the  health  sector,  accounting, \nfinancial reporting, and analysis of expenditure in the health sector. \n\nEnsure  that,  once  the  budgets  have  been  prepared  according  to  agreed  Health \nDepartment  objectives,  actual  expenditure  in  the  Health  Department  and  the \nagencies that it funds, is in accordance with the appropriations made. The FMC \nwill  be  central  to  financial  reporting  in  the  health  sector  and  will  be  able  to \ngenerate  management  accounting  information  to  facilitate  budgetary  control  for \ncost  center  managers,  senior  managers,  the  core  team,  and  the  secretary  (as \nprincipal accounting officer). \n\n(vi) \n\nDevelop appropriate automation tools (including an interface with the Project for \nImproved  Financial  Reporting  and  Accounting  system)  to  assist  in  budget \npreparation and financial reporting; \n\n(vii)  Review  internal  control mechanisms  in  the  Health  Department  and  its  spending \n\nagencies.  \n\n \n\n\f74 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nLIST OF INELIGIBLE ITEMS \n\nNo withdrawals shall be made in respect of: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n525 \n667 \n\n718 \n\n728 \n897 \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n \n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\nexpenditures  for  goods  included  in  the  following  groups  or  subgroups  of  the \nUnited  Nations  Standard  International  Trade  Classification,  Revision  3  (SITC, \nRev. 3), or any successor groups or subgroups under future revisions in the SITC, \nas designated by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to the Borrower: \n\nChapter  Heading \n112 \n121 \n122 \n\n \n \n \n\nTable A11: Ineligible Items \n\nDescription of Items \n\nAlcoholic beverages \nTobacco, unmanufactured; tobacco refuse \nTobacco, manufactured (whether or not containing tobacco \nsubstitute \nRadioactive and associated materials \nPearls, precious and semiprecious stones, unworked or \nworked \nNuclear reactors, and parts thereof, fuel elements (cartridges), \nnonirradiated for nuclear reactors \n\n \n \n\n718.7 \n\n728.43  Tobacco processing machinery \n897.3 \n\nJewelry of gold, silver, or platinum-group metals (except \nwatches and watch cases) and goldsmiths\u2019 or silversmiths\u2019 \nwares (including set gems) \nGold, nonmonetary (excluding gold ore and concentrates) \n\n971 \nSource: United Nations. \n\n \n\nexpenditures  in  the  currency  of  the  Borrower  or  of  goods  supplied  from  the \nterritory of the Borrower;  \n\nexpenditures  for  goods  supplied  under  a  contract  that  any  national  or \ninternational  financing  institution  or  agency  will  have  financed  or  has  agreed  to \nfinance, including any contract financed under any loan from ADB;  \n\nexpenditures  for  goods  intended  for  a  military  or  paramilitary  purpose  or  for \nluxury consumption;  \n\nexpenditures for narcotics;  \n\nexpenditures  for  environmentally  hazardous  goods,  the  manufacture,  use,  or \nimport  of  which  is  prohibited  under  the  laws  of  the  Borrower  or  international \nagreements to which the Borrower is a party; and \n\nexpenditures  on  account  of  any  payment  prohibited  by  the  Borrower  in \ncompliance  with  a  decision  of  the  United  Nations  Security  Council  taken  under \nChapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n75 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry/Project Title: Pakistan Punjab Millennium Development Goals Program  \n\n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n \n\n \n\nCluster Program loan  \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n \n\nCentral and West Asia Department \nGovernance, Finance and Trade  Division \n\n \n\nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nPakistan\u2019s health indicators are the worst among South Asian countries. For instance, Pakistan\u2019s infant mortality rate \n(IMR) is 78 compared to 57 in India and 46 in Nepal. Poor people have the worst health outcomes. They are pushed \nfurther into poverty because of ill health, resulting in lower productivity or loss of daily wages, and the burden of health \ncare  expenditure.  Pakistan  rightly  recognizes  the  importance  of  improving  health  outcomes  (i.e.,  health  sector \ninvestments) as an important part of the Government\u2019s poverty alleviation plan (Pakistan\u2019s national health policy 2001).  \n \nPakistan,  especially  Punjab,  has  demonstrated  strong  commitment  to  achieving  the  Millennium  Development  Goals \n(MDGs), and actively monitoring the MDG indicators. The health care budget has increased substantially in the last few \nyears. Despite these efforts, Punjab is unlikely to achieve the MDG targets for reduction of the maternal mortality ratio \n(MMR) and IMR without extra efforts and reforms in health service delivery, while it may achieve all other MDGs. \n \nThe Punjab Millennium Development Goals Program intends to improve health services delivery by improving quality \nand standards of health care, increasing public health financing, improving the efficiency of public health financing, and \ninstitutional  management  of  health  service  delivery.  The  country  partnership  strategy  2007\u20132011,  which  is  being \nfinalized, includes support for reforms to address governance and institutional bottlenecks leading to improved delivery \nof inclusive social services.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: TI-M \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nThe  majority  of  maternal  and  infant  deaths  in  Punjab  are  preventable  if  women  and  children  have  timely  access  to \nquality preventive, primary, and secondary  health care. Access is limited or delayed because health services are not \nphysically available in their neighborhood, doctors and/medicines are not available, or services are unaffordable. Even \nif health care services are available, their quality is not always optimal. Punjab\u2019s health service delivery system needs \nquantitative and qualitative improvements, and measures to reduce the burden of health care expenditure on the poor.  \n \nPrivate  practitioners  are  prevalent,  but  in  rural  areas  they  are  often  quacks  and  unskilled  birth  attendants.  Qualified \nprivate  health  care  is  more  expensive  than  public  health  care.  Thus,  it  is  essential  to  improve  public  primary  and \nsecondary health care, if Punjab is to reduce the IMR and MMR among the poor.  \n \nThe  poor  quality  of  public  primary  and  secondary  health  is  mainly  due  to  historical  under-financing  of  health  care  in \nPakistan.  Pakistan\u2019s  per  capita  public  health  expenditure  is  the  lowest  in  South  Asia.  It  spends  only  about  $9  per \nperson,  against  the  $30\u2013$40  recommended  by  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  for  developing  countries.  In \naddition, the limited resources have not been utilized cost-effectively. Until 2 years ago, the majority of the health care \nbudget of the government of Punjab went to tertiary health care, which mainly serves the urban population and whose \nbenefits are known to be regressively distributed.  \n \n2. Design Features \n \n\nThe Program is aimed at improving maternal, neonatal, and child (MNCH) services for rural areas, where \nsocial  indicators are  worse than those urban areas. Availability of health  services is  a  major problem in \nrural areas. \nThe  Program  focuses  on  primary  and  secondary  health  care,  whose  benefits  are  more  progressively \ndistributed than those of tertiary health care. \nThe  Program  supports  health  cards  that  will  target  the  bottom  30%  of  pregnant  women,  in  accordance \nwith the present plan, although the plan has to be detailed and tested first.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f76 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \nDiscuss  the  impact  channels  of  the  policy  reform(s)  (direct  and  indirect,  short  and  medium  term)  to  the  country  and \nmajor groups affected. \n \nBetter  primary  and  secondary  health  services  will  lead  to  better  health  of  the  populations  and  lead  to  increased \nproductivity. In addition, affordable health services available for the poorer segment of the population will prevent them \nfrom falling deeper into poverty. \n \n1.  Discuss the impact of the policy reform(s) on vulnerable groups and ways to address it/them (refer to social \n\nanalysis). \n\n \nThe health sector reforms are especially focused on women and children in rural areas who cannot afford proper private \nhealth care. They are the most vulnerable populations in Punjab.  \n \n2.  Discuss how the policy reform(s) contribute(s) to poverty reduction, pro-poor growth, and the MDGs. \n  \nThe entire program is to attain health MDGs 4 and 5.. A sustainable health care financing system to be designed by \n2011  will  pool  the  health  risks  of  the  rich  and  the  poor,  and  let  the  rich  compensate  for  the  poor.  This    will  mitigate \nburden of health care expenditure on the poor.    \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe  main  beneficiaries  are  pregnant  women  and  young  children  in  rural  areas.  Secondary  beneficiaries  are  other \nresidents  of  rural  areas  who  use  public  health  facilities.  As  discussed  above,  these  beneficiaries  tend  to  come  from \npoorer  households,  as  the  better  off  choose  private  practitioners  for  curative  care.  Causes  of  disparity  in  access  to \nhealth services or other social in services in Punjab is (i) residence\u2014either rural or urban, (ii) gender, and (iii) economic \nstatus.  \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) team consulted with a wide range of government staff both in the provincial and \ndistrict governments, and health workers at primary and secondary health care facilities, federal health programs, \nPunjab Medical and Dentistry Association, and other development partners. The team also consulted with a group of \nlady health workers who work in the beneficiaries\u2019 community. Although systematic consultation with beneficiaries was \nnot conducted, the team reviewed the studies based on survey and focus group meetings among the beneficiaries.   \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nThe Program mainly focuses on supply-side constraints and on the health system. The major premise of the Program \nis  that  by  reducing  cost  and  increasing  availability  of  health  care,  the  beneficiaries  will  change  their  health-seeking \nbehavior. The issue is to disseminate information on improved health services to the beneficiaries quickly, so that they \ncan make an informed decision. Therefore, the policy matrix has included dissemination of information to beneficiaries.  \n \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues.   \n \nThe  low  socioeconomic  status  of  women  in  Pakistan  has  been  well-documented.  The  biggest  constraint  in  women\u2019s \naccess to health services is their low level of education. For example, more than more than 70% of women who have \nsecondary  education  deliver  at  health  facilities,  while  only  20%  of  uneducated  women  do.  Punjab  has  been \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n77 \n\nimplementing  education  reform  to  increase  the  primary  school  enrollment  rate.  At  present,  the  primary  school  net \nenrollment rate is 70%, which shows there will be an increase in institutional deliveries in the future leading to reduced \nMMR  and  IMR.  In  the  meantime,  stress  is  given  to  awareness  building  about  danger  signs  of  pregnancy  in  rural \ncommunities,  through  lady  health  workers;  and  increasing  the  availability  of  24-hour  obstetric  and  health  care  and \nwomen medical doctors in rural areas.  \n \n2.  Key  Actions.  Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access \nto and use of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n\n \n\n  Gender plan      \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\n \nThe program primarily focuses on health services for pregnant women and young children, and indicators monitored \ninclude reproductive health indicators.  \nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nStrategy to Address \nIssue \n\nPlan or Other Measures \nIncluded in Design \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n   Full Plan \n   Short Plan \n   Resettlement \nFramework \n\n   No Action \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action \n   Indigenous Peoples \n\nFramework \n\n   No Action \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action  \n   No Action \n\n   Action \n   No Action \n\n  Plan \n  Other Action \n   No Action \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \n\nNo construction of new \nfacilities is planned and no \nland acquisition is \nenvisaged.  \n\nThe Program improves all \nprimary and secondary \nhealth facilities and services. \nThere is no evidence that \ndistribution of primary and \nsecondary health facilities \nmakes particular ethnic \ngroups disadvantaged or \ntreated in a discriminatory \nmanner.  \nThe health sector reform \nsupported by the Program is \nexpected to add 80,000 jobs \nfor paramedics.  \n\nThe Program supports \nimplementation of health \ncards targeted at poor \npregnant women.  \nNone. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nIssue \n\n \nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\n \nIndigenous Peoples \n \n\nLabor \n\n Employment  \nopportunities \n Labor retrenchment \n Core labor standards \n\n \nAffordability \n\nOther Risks and/or \nVulnerabilities \nHIV/AIDS \nHuman trafficking \nOthers(conflict, political \n\ninstability, etc), please \nspecify \n\n \n  \n\n \n\nIV.
