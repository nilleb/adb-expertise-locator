THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed equity \ninvestment of up to \u20b9780,000,000 (or its equivalent in United States dollars) in Zenex Animal \nHealth India Private Limited (ZAHL) for the Zenex Improved Animal Health and Welfare Project \nin India. \n \n2.  The project will support the enhanced production of quality animal health care products, \nwhich  will  help  smallholder  farmers  to  mitigate  disease  risk,  reduce  losses,  and  increase \nproductivity,  thereby  increasing  farmers'  incomes.  The  project  will  also  support  increased \nawareness about antimicrobial resistance, better farm hygiene, and biosecurity best practices. \nThe project will also support gender inclusion at corporate and farm levels. It is fully aligned with \nthe Government of India\u2019s goal of boosting agricultural productivity and farmers\u2019 incomes. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n1.  Project Identification \n \n3.  Importance of livestock and poultry in India. Livestock contributes about 5% to India\u2019s \ngross domestic product and nearly 12% to rural household income. As income per capita grows, \nthe Indian population is shifting towards better nutrition through high-protein diets, including milk \nand meat. Globally, India is the largest producer of milk with an estimated output of about 187.7 \nmillion metric tons, and the fourth-largest broiler (chicken) producer with an estimated output of \n5.1 million metric tons, in fiscal year (FY) 2019.1 However, livestock rearing in India is plagued by \nissues such as high fragmentation of land, low national average in productivity, and poor hygiene \nand animal health practices, leaving smallholder farmers vulnerable to income loss. \n \n4.  Improving  productivity.  To  increase  productivity,  progress  is  required  in  breed \nimprovement, better feed and nutrition, animal health, and better herd composition. In dairying, \nmilk output has grown, but largely because of the increased number of livestock. This type of \ngrowth  is  not  sustainable.  Dairying  practices  need  a  shift  to  automated  milking  and  feed \nmanagement, while health and disease control need skill improvement and capacity building. \nVaccination and health care infrastructure and services are equally critical, and animal health and \nwelfare assume even greater importance because of disease outbreaks. The infrastructure for \nvaccination and veterinary services is highly inadequate in many states.2 \n \n5.  Biosecurity risks. Since India\u2019s first major avian flu incident, reported in FY2006, India \nexperienced about 28 episodes of the disease, reported mostly by poultry farms. In all the reported \noutbreaks, all birds in broiler farms within the prescribed radius were promptly culled to prevent \nthe disease from spreading. In other livestock such as cattle, buffalo, sheep, and goat, prevalence \nof diseases such as foot and mouth disease and brucellosis led the government to create the \nNational Animal Disease Control Programme in 2019. The program aims to control foot and mouth \ndisease by 2025 with vaccination and achieve its eradication by 2030. This will result in increased \ndomestic production and, ultimately, in increased exports of milk and livestock products. Similarly, \nthe Intensive Brucellosis Control Program aims to control brucellosis in animals, resulting in \n                                                 \n1  Government of India, Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairy. 2019.

Antibiotic misuse. Antibiotics are an effective and important veterinary tool for treating \nanimal diseases when used appropriately. However, smallholder farmers in India typically use \nfeedstuff mixed with antibiotic additives as growth promoters to increase growth rates while \nreducing feed conversion ratios and feed costs. As India ramps up poultry production, areas of \nhigh antimicrobial consumption (30 kilograms per square kilometer) are expected to grow 312% \nby 2030, and antimicrobial use is expected to double between 2010 and 2030.5 Meanwhile, the \ncountry still faces high levels of infectious disease, with a lack of health advice and guidance in \nveterinary care. This, together with weak regulations surrounding the sale and use of antibiotics \nand  surveillance,  has  led  to  the  emergence,  maintenance,  and  spread  of  antimicrobial \nresistance.6 Antimicrobial resistance is one of the top 10 global public health threats facing \nhumanity, according to the World Health Organization, and India is a particular hotspot for its \ndevelopment.7 In India, nearly 60,000 newborns die of antimicrobial-resistant neonatal infection.8 \n \n7.  One Health in India. Since 2007, the government made significant strides towards One \nHealth9, including withdrawal periods to limit antibiotic residues in food, strict restrictions on the \npurchase and use of the last resort drug colistin, and a ban on the use of antibiotics and several \npharmacologically active substances in fisheries.10 However, despite many policies for livestock, \npoultry, and aquaculture, a lack of coordination and uniformity among relevant parties continue to \nhinder the effectiveness of efforts to tackle antimicrobial resistance in livestock India.11 \n \n8.  Project selection. An existing investee of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Multiples \nPrivate Equity Fund III Limited (Multiples) identified the established animal health business \noperated by Zydus Animal Health Limited (Zydus) as a potential acquisition; Zydus is a subsidiary \nof Cadila Healthcare Limited, one of India\u2019s largest pharmaceutical companies. To complete the \nacquisition of the animal health business from Zydus, Multiples needed to establish ZAHL and \nsource additional capital from other investors.

ZAHL has been chosen as an attractive potential investment for ADB, because of its (i) \nleading market position and diversified portfolio; (ii) significant penetration across milk animals \nand poultry, both fast-growing end segments; (iii) distribution reach to 100,000 veterinary doctors \nand more than 100,000 farmers; and (iv) good financial profile. \n \n2.  Project Design \n \n10.  ZAHL  will  use  ADB\u2019s  investment  proceeds  for  working  capital,  maintenance  capital \nexpenditure, and research and development, including new product development. The investment \nby ADB and other investors together with re-investment of internal accruals will enable accruals \nto grow the business as opposed to upstreaming of cash to its previous owners, CHL, from when \nthe animal health business was under Zydus. \n \n11.  Improved farmers\u2019 incomes. The project will help improve farmer incomes by making \nhealth care products available and supporting their appropriate and responsible use. The use of \nantibiotics  in  livestock  has  significantly  helped  increase  farm  efficiency,  productivity,  and \nincomes.13 While  overuse  of  antibiotics  at  subtherapeutic  levels  for  growth  promotion  and \nprophylaxis led to antimicrobial resistance, the use of antibiotics for responsible therapeutic and \nmetaphylaxis purposes improves animal health, reduces mortality, and leads to better incomes \nfor farmers compared to where antibiotics are not available. \n \n12.  Improved animal welfare. The project, via complementary technical assistance (TA), will \nimprove animal welfare by increasing the availability of antibiotics and supporting their responsible \ntherapeutic  and  metaphylactic  use  to  treat  sick  and  injured  animals.  Animal  welfare  is \nunquestionably impacted when sick or injured animals remain untreated because appropriate \nantibiotics are not available.14 Additionally, the appropriate metaphylactic use of antibiotics in \nlivestock improves animal welfare.15 Improved animal health and productivity can also reduce the \nintensity of GHG emissions, or carbon footprint, of livestock.  \n \n13.  Increased quality health care. The project will promote increased availability of quality \nhealth care products. It will allow ZAHL to reinvest its free cash accruals towards (i) maintenance \ncapital  expenditure,  (ii)  incremental  working  capital  needs,  (iii)  investments  in  acquisitions, \nincreasing product portfolio as well as geographical footprint, and (iv) new product development. \nThis will allow ZAHL to expand the animal health business to its full potential, which was restricted \nas a noncore business division when under the ultimate control of Cadila Healthcare Limited. \n \n                                                 \n12 Investors that have already invested in ZAHL are (i) Multiples, (ii) Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and (iii) \nRare Equity Private Limited. Other investors that are currently negotiating an investment in ZAHL are (i) International \nFinance Corporation and (ii) International Finance Corporation\u2019s Asset Management Company. \n13 C.

The  project  will  promote  a  less  antibiotic-\ndependent model of animal health by discouraging the use of antibiotics as growth promoters and \nby encouraging antibiotic alternatives like vaccines, herbals, and improved animal health and \nwelfare practices. The project will train farmers and veterinarians (vets) on (i) the appropriate use \nof antibiotics and effective alternatives to antibiotics; and (ii) improved biosecurity and farm \nhygiene standards towards better animal health and productivity, distributing training materials to \n10,000  vets.  The  project  will  also  raise  awareness  about  antimicrobial  resistance  by \ndemonstrating that with higher-quality therapeutics, vaccines, natural alternatives, and a higher \nlevel of farm hygiene and biosecurity, antibiotics use can be reduced without compromising \nanimal  health  and  productivity.  Additionally,  the  responsible  use  of  antibiotics  to  reduce \nantimicrobial resistance (AMR) and thus preserve antibiotic effectiveness, will be imperative \nadaptation to climate change as immune responses are rendered less effective in both humans \nand livestock due to increased heat. \n \n15.  Increased gender participation. Pharmaceuticals and life sciences are a nontraditional \narea of employment for women and tend to employ few women.16 India is one of the world\u2019s \nlargest producers of drugs, but only 15% of the nearly 50 million workforce are women.17 While \ndata on women's participation in veterinary professions is not available, recent developments \nsuggest that veterinary medicine has undergone dramatic, rapid feminization.18 Further, women \nplay an important role in livestock-farming labor and animal care in India, yet often lack knowledge \nand access to suitable animal health services.19 Through the project, ZAHL is committing to \nincrease women\u2019s representation in different roles of its operations, including on its board of \ndirectors, and to develop a gender inclusion policy, all of which will contribute to increasing gender \nequality results at the company level. \n \n16.  Technical assistance. To complement the project, ADB will provide TA of $575,000 to \nsupport ZAHL\u2019s training programs for 2,300 farmers and 580 vets in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, \nand  Sri  Lanka  in  appropriate  therapeutic  and  metaphylactic  use  of  antibiotics,  effective \nalternatives to subtherapeutic antibiotic use for prophylaxis or growth promotion, biosecurity best \npractice, antibiotic management, waste management, animal welfare, and gender sensitization. \nAt least 40% of training participants (farmers and vets) will be women.20 \n \n3.  Investee \n \n17.  With operations spanning more than six decades and a strong presence in all product \nsegments, Zydus was a reputed company in the Indian animal health industry. It had a well-\nregarded, technically trained field force and wide distribution network. Most of these attributes \ntransferred to ZAHL when it acquired the animal health business from Zydus. ZAHL will operate \nthe animal health business through species-based strategic business units for livestock and \n                                                 \n16 Institute for Transportation and Development Policy. 2017.

Of the total amount, \n$300,000 has been secured from Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund, $175,000 from Technical Assistance \nSpecial Fund (TASF-7), and $100,000 from Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). Outside of \nIndia, the TA will work with ZAHL\u2019s distribution partners. As regional and global trade and cooperation expand, the \npotential for the widespread and cross-border transmission of emerging infectious diseases is an increasing risk. \nThese risks are heightened where zoonoses and antimicrobial resistance are a factor.

For its livestock business line, ZAHL has two product categories: (i) therapeutic drugs for \nspecific  medical  indications;  and  (ii)  farm-care  products,  including  feed  supplements  and \nantiparasitic products. For its poultry business line, ZAHL also has two product categories: (i) \nbiologicals, primarily vaccines; and (ii) nonbiologicals, including therapeutic and feed supplement \nproducts. ZAHL follows an asset light business model and uses a mix of third-party manufacturing \nand its own manufacturing. It has one manufacturing facility located in the state of Uttarakhand \nand employs more than 900 staff, including almost 600 on-field staff and 200 manufacturing staff. \n \n18.  ZAHL acquired the existing management team of Zydus as part of the acquisition of the \nanimal health business. ZAHL is led by Dr. Arun Atrey (managing director and chief executive \nofficer), an industry veteran with 35 years of experience, earlier in Zydus and now in ZAHL. He \nhas been responsible for building the business from inception and will spearhead ZAHL\u2019s growth. \nThe two business verticals, livestock and poultry, are both headed by highly experienced persons \nwith more than 20\u201330 years of experience in the animal health sector and are continuing from \nZydus to ZAHL. To ensure adequate focus on growth, exports is managed as a separate vertical, \nheaded  by  a  separate  business  head.  The  board  composition  of  ZAHL  is  yet  to  be  fully \nascertained and will be completed once all investors have completed their respective investments. \n \n19.  ADB  conducted  integrity  due  diligence  on  the  investee,  its  management,  and  its \nshareholders, and on the investee\u2019s significant contracting entities. 21 They do not appear to \nconstitute a significant or potentially significant integrity risk, since no unresolved or substantiated \nadverse media or other relevant information related to them exists. ADB has obtained reasonable \nassurance that the investee was not established and is not being used for money laundering or \nterrorism financing in the project jurisdiction. Tax integrity due diligence was not required.  \n \nB.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n20.  Impacts.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impacts:  healthy  and  productive \nlivestock in the Indian subcontinent using standard, efficient, and safe veterinary biological \nproducts achieved, and farmers\u2019 income doubled through increased agricultural productivity.22 \n \n21.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: production and delivery of animal \nhealth products improved.23 \n \n22.  Outputs. The expected outputs of the project will be (i) animal health care product portfolio \nexpanded, (ii) animal health and welfare practices in a gender-sensitive manner improved, (iii) \ncorporate governance and gender-inclusive policies improved, and (iv) gender equality and \nemployment opportunities enhanced. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n23.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nADB's Strategy 2030 and four of its operational priorities (OPs): OP1: addressing remaining \npoverty (by improving the incomes of farmers and improving health outcomes for all); OP2, \naccelerating progress in gender equality (by promoting gender equality); OP5, promoting rural \n                                                 \n21 ADB. 2003.

Projected Financial and Economic Performance \n \n[Redacted] \n \nG.  Unique Features \n \n26.  The project will be the first agribusiness co-investment of ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations \nDepartment leveraging on the market reach and due diligence abilities of an existing investee \nprivate equity fund. This is also the department\u2019s first investment in a new sector of animal health. \nThe animal health sector is an extremely important sector for ADB in the post-COVID-19 world, \nwhere improving biosecurity, AMR mitigation, and zoonosis prevention have gained immense \nsignificance. The project also benefits from strong collaboration with the South Asia Environment, \nNatural Resources and Agriculture Division whose staff have made significant contribution to \nproject  design  by:  (i)  providing  regional  and  local  context,  (ii)  identifying  implementation \ngeographies, (iii) offering technical inputs, and (iv) establishing linkages with governmental \ninitiatives based on their experience gained in complementing sovereign projects (para. 24).  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n27.  ADB will make an equity investment of up to \u20b9750 million (approximately $10.3 million) \nfrom its ordinary capital resources to purchase common equity shares of ZAHL from Multiples \n(footnote 31). This will result in ADB owning about 3.0% of ZAHL\u2019s issued share capital.31  \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n28.  ADB assistance will add value on three fronts: \n(i)  Provide equity capital. ADB\u2019s investment will fill a market gap at the request of \nMultiples towards total funding required. Without ADB\u2019s participation, Multiples \nwould need to find another investor to fill the gap, which would prevent the intended \nstrategy implementation whereby the development priorities are implemented. \n                                                 \n31 ADB will purchase shares in ZAHL on a secondary basis from Multiples because of the need for ZAHL\u2019s acquisition \nof the animal health business to complete in July 2021, which was prior to ADB\u2019s completion of its due diligence \nrequirements on this proposed investment in ZAHL. ZAHL will apply an amount equivalent to ADB\u2019s investment \nproceeds as described in paragraph 10. \n ", "8 \n(ii)  Encourage  best  safeguard  and  governance  practices  and  improving \nindustry best practices. ADB will promote higher environmental and social (E&S) \nstandards,  particularly  in  effluent  and  waste  treatment,  labor  standards,  and \nhuman resources and corporate governance policies. The project\u2019s accompanying \nTA will train farmers and vets on correct use of antibiotics, biosecurity, farm \nhygiene, and alternatives to antibiotics\u2019 use.  \n(iii)  Promote gender inclusion. ADB will promote gender equality in the project, \nworking with ZAHL to implement a gender action plan integrating strong gender \ninterventions directly benefiting the project\u2019s male and female stakeholders (vets \nand farmers) and addressing gender gaps at corporate level. Further, ADB will \npromote that at least 20% of directors on ZAHL\u2019s board are female. \n \nC.  Risks \n \n[Redacted] \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n29.  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) as follows: environment (category B), involuntary resettlement, category C) and \nindigenous peoples (category C).32 \n \n30.  ADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \nimpacts of the project and the measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the \nadverse impacts in the safeguard reports and plans. The environmental and social measures and \ninstitutional capacity of ZAHL to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts needs to \nbe strengthened. \n \n31.  A  third  party  audit  report  comprised  of  (i)  an  assessment  of  the  current  status  of \nenvironmental, social, and governance risks in the animal health business; (ii) a review of Zydus\u2019 \nexisting procedures in operating the manufacturing plant; (iii) an evaluation of Zydus\u2019 existing \nprocesses  and  procedures  in  the  absence  of  an  existing  formal  environmental  and  social \nmanagement system (ESMS) and their implementation; and (iv) a review of compliance with \napplicable national laws of Zydus\u2019 identified existing procedures, sites, and facilities. The audit \nconfirmed that the operational footprints of the animal health business that ZAHL was acquiring \nfrom Zydus were limited to a corporate head office in Ahmedabad, Gujarat and the manufacturing \nplant in Haridwar\u2019s Integrated Industrial Estate, away from residential areas and not impacting \nany indigenous peoples\u2019 communities. Audit findings and recommendations, including the E&S \naction plan, have been documented. ADB reviewed and updated the E&S action plan to be \naddressed by ZAHL. ZAHL will (i) apply ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list, (ii) ensure that \nany future investment and/or re-investment activities using ADB funds will comply with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement and abide by national laws and regulations, and (iii) implement \nactivities to build staff capacity to implement the ESMS. ZAHL will engage a third-party consultant \nto prepare an ESMS commensurate with the nature of its business operations. Also, the ESMS \nwill set out requirements to comply with national labor laws and take measures to comply with the \ninternationally recognized core labor standards pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy \n(2001). ZAHL will ensure that the human resource policies on working hours, overtime pay, and \n                                                 \n32 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n \n ", "9 \ninternal grievance mechanism, among others, are consistent with state and federal labor laws. \nThe ESMS will also contain requirements for information disclosure and consultation with affected \npeople following ADB requirements. ZAHL will report annually to ADB on its compliance with the \nESMS, applicable national laws and regulations, and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and \nsocial protection requirements. \n \n32.  Effective gender mainstreaming Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development \n(1998),  ZAHL  has  incorporated  measures  to  promote  gender  equality  and  women\u2019s \nempowerment in its business activities. Key features of the gender action plan are as follows: (i) \ngender sensitization introduced in ZAHL\u2019s training programs to farmers and vets; (ii) participation \nof female livestock farmers in trainings; (iii) appointment of women in the company\u2019s new board \nof directors; (iv) development of a corporate policy on diversity, gender equality, and inclusion; (v) \nworkshops on gender equality at work, contributing to ZAHL\u2019s women leadership intervention \ninitiative; (vi) increase of women in technical roles; (vii) integration of female interns in the \ncompany\u2019s  internship  program;  and  (viii)  targeted  participation  of  female  employees  in  a \nmanagement  and  leadership  development  program.  ZAHL  will  submit  periodic  reports  on \nimplementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n33.  ZAHL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n[Redacted] \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n34.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),33 \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of India \nhas no objection to the proposed assistance to ZAHL. ADB will enter into suitable finance \ndocumentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed \nassistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n35.  I am satisfied that the proposed equity investment would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nequity investment of up to \u20b9780 million (or its equivalent in United States dollars) from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources in Zenex Animal Health India Private Limited for the Zenex Improved \nAnimal Health and Welfare Project in India, with such terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n22 October 2021\n                                                 \n33 ADB. 1966.
