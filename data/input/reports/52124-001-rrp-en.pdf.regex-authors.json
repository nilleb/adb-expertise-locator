THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $25,000,000, comprising (i) an A loan of up to $15,000,000 and (ii) a B loan of up to \n$10,000,000, to Kashf Foundation for Expanding Access to Credit for Women in Pakistan. The B \nloan will be syndicated by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to impact investors and other \neligible participants on a best-effort basis, subject to market conditions. \n \n2.  The loan will support Kashf Foundation\u2019s lending to low-income women, female micro- \nand small entrepreneurs and low-cost schools in Pakistan. An increase in Kashf Foundation\u2019s \ncapacity to provide critically needed financial products to this underserved segment will  (i) \nsignificantly improve the financial access of women, especially those belonging to poor rural \nhouseholds; and (ii) help improve and sustain their livelihood and incomes. The ADB loan will \nalso support the diversification of Kashf Foundation\u2019s funding base and strengthen its balance \nsheet by providing longer-tenor financing, thereby enabling it to provide longer-maturity financial \nproducts to its clients. \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n3.  The long-run gross domestic product (GDP) growth of Pakistan is characterized by \nrepeated cycles of rapid growth followed by slowdowns. After expanding at an average GDP \ngrowth rate of 6.2% during FY2003\u2013FY2008,1 GDP growth slowed during FY2008\u2013FY2013 to an \naverage  rate  of  3.0% because  of  a  challenging  investment climate, high  inflation,  and  an \nunresolved energy crisis.2 Pakistan\u2019s economy has gained positive momentum since FY2014, \nand GDP grew 5.8% in FY2018\u2014the highest growth since FY2007.3 ADB projects GDP growth \nof 4.8% for FY2019, in light of the pressing need to deal with large budget and external \nimbalances.4 \n \n4.  Finance sector. The finance sector in Pakistan is underdeveloped and characterized by \nlow access to finance primarily because of heavy investment by banks in government securities \nand risk aversion of certain customer segments. Total bank assets increased 15.9% in FY2017 \nto PRs18,342 billion. Customer deposits grew 14.4% from PRs11,798 billion in FY2016 to \nPRs13,012 billion in FY2017. Net advances grew 18.4% from PRs5,499 billion in FY2016 to \nPRs6,512 billion in FY2017, but remain at 35.5% of total banking industry assets in Pakistan.5 \nThe loan\u2013deposit ratio for the Pakistan banking industry was 50.1% in FY2017 compared with \n73.3% in India and 87.7% in Bangladesh. The capital adequacy ratio of the industry was 15.8% \nat the end of FY2017 under the Basel III standard as compared with 15.9% at the end of FY2016.6 \n \n                                                \n1  Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Finance, Finance Division. 2008.

Karachi. \n6  Basel III is an international regulatory accord that introduced a set of reforms designed to improve the regulation, \nsupervision and risk management within the banking sector. \n \n ", "2 \n5.  Microfinance.  Microfinance  plays  a  vital  role  in  the  country\u2019s  finance  sector,  as  it \naddresses market gaps. Pakistan has 52 entities with microfinance operations. These are mainly \nmicrofinance banks (MFBs), microfinance institutions (MFIs), rural support programs, and other \nentities with microfinance operations as part of their multidimensional service offering. MFBs \nprovide credit; take deposits from the general public; and are regulated by the central bank, the \nState Bank of Pakistan. MFIs provide microcredit to clients but do not raise deposits from the \ngeneral  public.  Rural  support  programs  provide  microcredit  as  part  of  an  array  of  service \nofferings.7 \n \n6.  Since 2005, microfinance has grown nearly 12 times in terms of borrowers and 29 times \nwith respect to outstanding credit, with about equal growth from MFBs and MFIs.8 As of the \nsecond quarter of 2018, outstanding credit in the microfinance industry had reached PRs239 \nbillion. The industry targets increasing the active borrower base of microfinance entities from 6 \nmillion in 2017 to 10 million by 2020.9 Most clients of microfinance entities are females, who \nconstituted 53% of active borrowers as of FY2017. The urban\u2013rural ratio of active borrowers was \n47:53 during the fourth quarter of 2017.10 \n \n7.  MFIs,  including  Kashf  Foundation,  are  regulated  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange \nCommission of Pakistan (SECP) and provide finance to two defined categories of borrowers: \n(i)  Poor person. Nonbanking finance company (NBFC) regulations define a poor \nperson as an individual with meager means of subsistence and whose total \nbusiness income, excluding expenses, during a year is less than or equal to \nPRs600,000 or such other minimum limit as may be prescribed from time to time; \nand \n(ii)  Microenterprises.  NBFC  regulations  define  microenterprises  as  projects  or \nbusinesses in trading, manufacturing, services, or agriculture that lead to livelihood \nimprovement and income generation. These projects or businesses are run by \nmicro-entrepreneurs  who  are  self-employed  or  employ  no  more  than  10 \nindividuals, excluding seasonal labor. \n \n8.  The SECP also imposes maximum MFI lending requirements of PRs200,000 for a general \nloan to an individual, PRs500,000 for a housing loan to an individual, and PRs500,000 for a loan \nto a microenterprise. The maximum exposure per borrower must not exceed PRs700,000.11 As \nof August 2018, the SECP regulated 25 NBFCs. \n \n9.  Access to finance is very limited. According to World Bank estimates, as of FY2017, \nonly 21.3% of Pakistani adults and 7.0% of women over the age of 15 had a bank account with a \nformal financial institution or mobile money service provider. This is well below the account \nownership rate of 50.1% (overall population) and 35.8% (women) in Bangladesh and 79.9% \n(overall) and 76.6% (women) in India.12 About 86% of the population in Pakistan has no access \nto formal financial services; 56% of adults in Pakistan use neither formal nor informal products \n                                                \n7  Pakistan Microfinance Network (PMN). 2018.

Issue 46. Islamabad. \n11 Credit exposure can be verified through the State Bank of Pakistan-operated Credit Information Bureau or four \nprivately owned credit bureaus. MFIs regularly report to the SECP. \n12 World Bank. World Bank Open Data (accessed 26 November 2018). \n ", "3 \nand, while 36% of adults save, only 4% save at a formal financial institution. Similarly, one-third \nof adults borrow money, but only 3% borrow from a formal financial institution. \n \n10.  Access  to  finance  is  particularly  constrained  for  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized \nenterprises (MSMEs) and individual micro-borrowers, including farmers. Banks in Pakistan tend \nto be selective in risk-taking with a clear preference for providing working capital and trade finance \nto large corporations with lower risk profiles and an aversion to lending to small and medium-\nsized enterprises (SMEs). Access to finance for microenterprises, particularly microenterprises \nrun by women, is even more limited and remains largely unmet by the formal finance sector. The \nlimited supply of credit to microenterprises is a major concern to policy makers in Pakistan. As of \nFY2016, MSMEs received only 7% of total bank credit to the private sector but contribute 40% to \nGDP.13 As of FY2017, MSMEs are estimated to account for 98% of all enterprises in Pakistan \nand employ more than 80% of the nonagricultural labor force. \n \n11.  Investment rationale. ADB met with several banks and NBFCs in 2017 to identify \ncandidates for funding due to the very low credit extended to the private sector, specifically to \nMSMEs and female borrowers, and the importance of MSMEs in general and women, more \nspecifically, to economic growth and poverty alleviation in Pakistan. ADB signed a loan of up to \n$20 million to Khushhali Microfinance Bank in 2017 to support MSMEs; the loan is pending \ndisbursement.14 To further expand ADB\u2019s support of the banking and microfinance sector in \nPakistan, ADB also entered into discussions with a number of other financial institutions, including \nKashf Foundation. Kashf Foundation stands out as one of the few MFIs with a long and successful \nrecord of lending to female micro-borrowers. Kashf Foundation also has the highest percentage \nof female borrowers in Pakistan. It has multiple branches across 50 districts in Pakistan and is \nideally positioned to use ADB funding to improve access to finance for underserved women. Of \nKashf Foundation\u2019s clients, 99% are women, and households headed by women are given \npriority. Kashf Foundation also offers mandatory health insurance to its borrowers, as well as \neducational seminars and programs, all of which contribute to its leading position in Pakistan\u2019s \nmicrofinance industry. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n12.  Established in 1996 as a microfinance service provider, Kashf Foundation launched \nmicrofinance services in 1999. Its objective is to reduce poverty and empower women by \nproviding quality and cost-effective microfinance services to low-income households. Modeled \nafter Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, Kashf Foundation is also a partner institution of the Grameen \nFoundation in Pakistan. Kashf Foundation transitioned to a nonprofit company in February 2007 \nand obtained an NBFC license in October 2016 from the SECP. As of June 2018,  Kashf \nFoundation served 412,983 clients and had a gross loan portfolio of PRs10,513 million, with total \nassets of PRs14,378 million. Target clients are households with monthly incomes of PRs3,500\u2013\nPRs27,500, a low asset base, vulnerable sources of income, or a high dependency ratio.15 As of \nFY2018, Kashf Foundation\u2019s distribution network comprised 291 branches across 50 districts in \nPakistan. While since its founding Kashf Foundation has focused on commercially active cities \nand small towns, it put a rural strategy in place in 2016. Kashf Foundation had opened 10 rural \nbranches as of FY2018 and plans to expand rural lending. \n \n                                                \n13 M. Pasha. 2016.

Disbursement was delayed due to exchange \nrate volatility and is expected to disburse in 2019. \n15 Dependency ratio is the ratio of nonworking-age individuals to working-age individuals. \n ", "4 \n13.  Kashf Foundation has a diversified loan portfolio consisting of the following products: \n(i)  Individual loans. Loans to individuals to support new or existing businesses, \nranging from PRs30,000 to PRs100,000, make up 95% of Kashf Foundation\u2019s total \nportfolio.  Each  loan  has  a  1-year  maximum  tenor  repayable  in  12  monthly \ninstallments. The loans are unsecured, but postdated checks are a mandatory \nrequirement. \n(ii)  Easy loans. Loans at 12-month tenors and up to PRs15,000 are available to \nfemale  clients  who  need  small  loans  quickly  for  business  and  nonbusiness \nexpenses. \n(iii)  School investment loans. Support for the education sector consists of technical \nand  financial  assistance  for  low-cost  private  schools  to  improve  education \ninfrastructure and the quality of education. Loan amounts to schools range from \nPRs60,000 to PRs300,000 with a maximum tenor of 18 months. \n(iv)  Islamic product: Offered in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, shariah compliant loans range \nfrom PRs30,000-PRs100,000. The maximum tenor of such a loan is one year with \nrepayment in 12 monthly installments. \n(v)  Life insurance loans and health insurance. Kashf Foundation provides life \ninsurance for its clients and has sold health insurance products to more than 1.5 \nmillion clients. Kashf Foundation is a pioneer in Pakistan in providing micro health \ninsurance. Every borrower must participate in Kashf Foundation\u2019s health insurance \nscheme. \n(vi)  Nonfinancial products. Kashf Foundation also offers services such as basic \nfinancial  literacy  training,  systemized  financial  education  training,  business \nincubation laboratories, vocational training, child safeguards training, and a gender \nempowerment program. \n \n14.  Kashf Foundation expects its loan portfolio to grow from PRs10,513 million in FY2018 to \nPRs29,119 million by the end of FY2020. Total individual clients served are projected to increase \nfrom 412,983 as of FY2018 to more than 1 million by June 2020. To achieve these operational \nlevels, the distribution network is projected to reach 370 branches by 2021, as Kashf Foundation \nplans to increase penetration in Punjab and expand operations in Sindh, Baluchistan, and Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa. The individual loan product will initially be made available in the new service areas, \nand the expansion will provide geographical diversification in the portfolio. \n \n15.  Kashf Foundation is assessing the addition of seven new products, including a product for \nSMEs. Kashf Foundation\u2019s growth strategy is supported by ongoing investment in information \ntechnology infrastructure and a rigorous training program for new staff. As part of its digital finance \nstrategy, Kashf Foundation has provided tablet computers to all loan officers and has converted \nall branches to cashless branches. It is exploring the implementation of a credit scoring model, \nfurther digitization of services, and the use of data analytics in the lending process. Kashf \nFoundation estimates that it will require PRs24 billion in additional funding until FY2020 to meet \nits growth and disbursement targets. \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n16.  Ownership. Kashf Foundation is a nonprofit NBFC registered under Section 42 of the \nCompanies Ordinance 1984 and regulated by the SECP. The memorandum of association of \nKashf Foundation outlines the legal structure of the company, which does not have shareholders \nbecause of its nonprofit structure. Instead, Kashf Foundation has members who have a maximum \nindividual liability of PRs50,000. Initial members of the company were those individuals who \nsubscribed to the memorandum of association at the time of its formation. Of the 10 founding \n ", "5 \nmembers, 6 have resigned, and Kashf Foundation\u2019s board of directors has admitted 8 new \nmembers. Integrity due diligence was conducted.16 No significant or potentially significant integrity \n \nrisks were identified. Tax integrity due diligence was not required.\n \n17.  Management.  Kashf  Foundation\u2019s  management  team  has  extensive  experience  in \nfinance, banking, social development, accounting, and auditing; it also has a long record in the \nlocal banking and microfinance market. Senior oversight is led by  Roshaneh Zafar, Kashf \nFoundation\u2019s chief executive officer and founder, and four other senior managers. Zafar is widely \nknown in Pakistan\u2019s microfinance industry and has received many global awards for her work and \nadvocacy. Before establishing Kashf Foundation, Zafar worked with the World Bank in Islamabad \nin the water and sanitation department for several years. \n \n18.  Governance  structure.  Kashf  Foundation  is  governed  by  a  ten-member  board  of \ndirectors. The board is chaired by Mueen Afzal, who has been with Kashf Foundation since 2013 \nand has held high-level positions in the civil service of Pakistan since 1964, including finance \nsecretary and finance and economic affairs secretary general in the Government of Pakistan. The \nboard also has eight independent voting directors with diverse experience, including senior \npositions in the private sector. \n \n CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n19.  ADB will provide a senior unsecured loan to Kashf Foundation of up to $15,000,000. ADB \nexpects to syndicate a B loan of up to $10,000,000 by mobilizing impact investors and other \neligible B loan participants, subject to market conditions. \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  Use of proceeds. Kashf Foundation will use the proceeds of ADB\u2019s loan to finance low-\nincome women, female micro- and small entrepreneurs in Pakistan, and low-cost private schools. \n \n21.  Reporting arrangements. ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department will carry out \nproject monitoring. Kashf Foundation will provide ADB with financial reports at predetermined \nregular intervals and as requested, including (i) annual audited financial statements; (ii) quarterly \nunaudited financial statements; (iii) quarterly compliance certificates for loan covenants; (iv) \nsemiannual reporting on the loan portfolio; and (vi) annual reporting on environment and social \nperformance, including the development indicators specified in the gender action plan (GAP) \nagreed by ADB and the borrower. \n \n22.  Evaluation. Monitoring reports will be prepared and submitted to ADB regularly, and at \nleast  annually.  The  first  report  will  be  submitted  no  later  than  12  months  after  the  first \ndisbursement. \n \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2003.

Broaden access to finance for women. Access to finance for women in Pakistan is still \nseverely limited. ADB\u2019s funding will help broaden access to formal institutional finance for micro-\nborrowers, whose only alternative of access to finance is the often exploitative and expensive \ninformal finance sector. The project will promote lending to women as a financial approach and \nwill support employment and income-generating activities. Kashf Foundation has agreed to \nimplement the GAP to further enhance support for female borrowers. \n \n24.  Provide longer-tenor debt for a nonprofit nonbanking finance company. As a non-\ndeposit-taking  NBFC,  Kashf  Foundation  must  continuously  diversify  its  funding  base.  The \nmanagement team\u2019s strategic plan focuses on diversifying and growing Kashf Foundation\u2019s loan \nportfolio and rolling out new products, which may have relatively longer tenors. Since Kashf \nFoundation needs additional sources of longer-tenor financing, ADB\u2019s loan will provide longer-\ntenor funds to help Kashf Foundation diversify its product portfolio. \n \n25.  Catalyze private sector financing. ADB will provide a B loan and mobilize additional \nprivate sector financing that Kashf Foundation needs to support its growth strategy and diversify \nits funding sources. \n \n CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n26.  Impact. The project supports the government\u2019s Pakistan 2025 vision, which promotes, \namong other things, access to finance, financial inclusion, and increased availability of financial \ninstruments.17 It also supports the vision statement of the State Bank of Pakistan, which outlines \nhow microfinance could be transformed into a dynamic industry that is integrated into the overall \nfinancial system, providing inclusive financial services to underserved economic and geographic \nsegments through self-sustaining business models and demand-driven products, while keeping \nhigh governance and service delivery standards, supported by an agile regulatory environment.18 \n \n27.  Outcome. The outcome of the project is an increased use of sustainable microfinance by \nwomen in Pakistan. \n \n28.  Outputs. The project will (i) improve Kashf Foundation\u2019s ability to serve female borrowers, \nand (ii) improve the quality of education of the schools supported by Kashf Foundation. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n29.  Consistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  project  supports  the \nfollowing key operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: (i) addressing remaining poverty and \nreducing inequality, (ii) promoting rural development, and (iii) accelerating progress in gender \n                                                \n17 Government of Pakistan; Ministry of Planning, Development and Reform; Planning Commission. 2014.

Without \naccess to formal financial services, low-income people or underserved segments, specifically \nwomen, will be excluded from the growth process and its benefits. This is consistent with ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy for Pakistan, 2015\u20132019, which prioritizes inclusive growth by \nsupporting financial services to segments whose access to finance is limited.20 ADB's activity in \nPakistan's finance sector began in 2000 with the Microfinance Sectors Development Program, \nwhich concluded in 2008.21 Finally, the project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Gender Equality and \nWomen\u2019s Empowerment Operational Plan, 2013\u20132020.22 \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s participation in the project will help borrowers, who are predominantly from poor \nhouseholds, access financial services, which will contribute to the improvement of their living \nconditions. As ADB\u2019s financing helps enable access to such finance, the project is classified as \ninclusive  business.  The  project  also  has  high  development  impact  and  contributes  to  the \nachievement of Sustainable Development Goal 10 on reducing inequality within and among \ncountries. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n31.  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009).23 \n \n32.  Category FI (treated as C). ADB has assessed the transaction's potential environmental \nand social impacts, risks associated with Kashf Foundation\u2019s existing and/or likely future portfolio, \nand commitment and capacity for environmental and social management. Kashf Foundation has \nin place a screening mechanism with a business exclusion list and requires all clients and their \nbusiness activities to comply with Pakistan laws and regulations.24 Kashf Foundation has a \nmechanism to monitor client activities though its staff at different levels. BDOs visit clients within \n45 days after loan approval to confirm loan use, and branch managers and compliance officers \nalso visit a random sample of clients. Kashf Foundation has an environmental policy to reduce its \ndirect and indirect impacts. It also has whistle-blowing and grievance policies as well as open \nhotlines for issues related to Kashf Foundation activities; such issues are reported regularly to \nmanagement. \n \n33.  Given the size, tenor, and nature of Kashf Foundation\u2019s loans, transactions under Kashf \nFoundation will have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts and are unlikely to entail \nimpacts on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. In addition to its current system, \nKashf Foundation will (i) apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list to its existing business \nexclusion list; (ii) exclude activities with category A and B environment and social safeguard \n                                                \n19 ADB. 2018.

Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998), \nKashf  Foundation  has  incorporated  measures  to  promote  gender  equality  and/or  women\u2019s \nempowerment in its business activities. ADB and Kashf Foundation prepared the GAP to support \nthe project\u2019s gender equity as a theme classification. Key features of the GAP are increased \nprovision of microloans and additional financing products to women, increased loan facilities to \nimprove education infrastructure, and provision of training on gender-responsive delivery of \ncustomer service for new staff and training on financial literacy for female borrowers. Kashf \nFoundation will submit periodic reports on the implementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n35.
