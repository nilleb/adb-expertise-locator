It will support the \nGovernment\u2019s  Regional  Development  Policy  and  Action  Program  and \nwill  increase  the  management  capacity  of  local  public  urban  services \norganizations (PUSOs) in the eight provincial capitals. \n \n\n(Baruun-Urt, \n\n  Mongolia\u2019s  rapid  urbanization  in  the  late  20th  century  has  created  an \nurban  population  of  1.4  million  people  (about  58%  of  the  country\u2019s \ntotal). As the capital, Ulaanbaatar, gained primacy in the last decade, it \nattracted  the  most  foreign  assistance,  to  the  detriment  of  balanced \nurban  and  regional  development.  About  40%  of  the  urban  population \nlives in the provincial capitals, which are expected to serve not only the \ntowns  themselves  but  also  their  rural  hinterlands.  Because  of  the  lack \nof  funds  for  rehabilitation  and  periodic  maintenance,  urban  service \ninfrastructure in these towns is seriously dilapidated and in urgent need \nof  repair.  Provincial  capitals  function  as  the  economic  centers  of  their \nrural  hinterlands,  as  most  of  the  agroprocessing  and  nonagricultural \nemployment  in  the  provinces  is  located  there.  The  provincial  capitals \nneed to improve their service coverage of the towns in their provinces \nso that they can function as sustainable regional economic centers as \nwell as seasonal shelters for the rural population from the hinterlands.  \n \nWhile  the  incidence  of  poverty  in  Ulaanbaatar  is  only  34%,  in  the \nproject  towns  it  is  over  50%.  Moreover,  the  formal  areas  in  urban \nsettlements, with their fully networked utilities, stand in sharp contrast to \nthe  informal  ger  (traditional  circular  tent)  settlements  with  minimal \nservices.  On  average,  46%  of  the  people  in  the  formal  areas  have \nconnections to water supply, as opposed to very few in the ger areas. \nWaterborne  diseases  are  therefore  more  prevalent  in  informal  areas, \nand  children  in  the  ger  areas  are  twice  as  likely  to  have  diarrhea  and \nrespiratory  infections.  The  high  incidence  of  poverty  and  poor  living \nstandards  in  the  provincial  towns  strongly  suggest  that  poverty \nreduction programs should be targeted at the informal settlements, and \nthat the present imbalance in the provision of urban services should be \nredressed in favor of the informal ger areas. \n \nAccordingly,  the  Government  of  Mongolia  is  seeking  to  improve  the \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nObjectives and \nScope \n \n\n \n\nCost Estimates \n \n\n \n\nquality of life and to protect public health by rehabilitating and extending \nbasic urban services, while strengthening the capacity of local PUSOs \nto  provide  and  operate  these  essential  services.  Following  the \nsuccessful  implementation  of  the  Provincial  Towns  Basic  Urban \nServices  Project  financed  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for \nfive  provincial  capitals  in  western  Mongolia,  the  Government  is \nendeavoring to expand the project concept to other regions where living \nconditions and service functions are rapidly deteriorating. \n \nThe long-term goals of the proposed Project are to (i) support balanced \nand  equitable  regional  development  by  promoting  viable  provincial \nurban  centers  that  can  provide  support  and  services  for  their  rural \nhinterlands; and (ii) reduce urban poverty and improve living conditions \nfor  urban  residents  in  provincial  towns.  The  specific  objectives  of  the \nProject are to (i) improve basic urban services, (ii) reduce inequality in \naccess  to  urban  services  between  the  formal  and  informal  areas,  and \n(iii)  strengthen  the  operation  and  management  capacities  of  local \nPUSOs  in  order  to  achieve  sustainable  regional  development  in  the \neight provincial capitals of central and eastern Mongolia. \n \nThe  project  comprises  two  parts:  Part  A,  Urban  Infrastructure  and \nEquipment,  covers  (i)  rehabilitation  of  the  centralized  water  supply \nsystems and improvement of water distribution for residents of  informal \nareas;  (ii)  improvement  and  extension  of  sanitation  facilities,  including \nsewage treatment works; (iii) refurbishment and replacement of heating \nand  hot  water  supply  systems,  including  boilers  and  distribution  lines; \n(iv) provision of solid waste collection and management equipment; and \n(v) rehabilitation of public bathhouses and provision of new bathhouses \nto serve informal areas. Part B, Project Implementation and Institutional \nDevelopment,  covers  (i)  project  management,  detailed  engineering \ndesign,  construction  supervision,  and  implementation  support;  and  (ii) \ninstitutional  capacity  building  programs  for  PUSOs,  including  (a)  a \ncommunity participation and health education program, (b) a water loss \nreduction  program  and  training  in  operation  and  maintenance,  (c) \ntraining  in  financial  management  and  corporate  planning,  (d)  land  use \nplanning and management, and (e) solid waste management planning \nand training. \n \nThe Project will cost about $26.5 million equivalent, $13.3 million of this \nin foreign exchange costs and $13.2 million equivalent in local currency \ncosts. \n \n\n \nComponent \n\nA.

The  Loan  will  be  repayable  over  32  years  with  a  grace \nperiod  of  8  years  and  an  interest  charge  of  1.0%  per  year  during  the \ngrace period and 1.5% thereafter. \n \nThe  Borrower  will  relend  portions  of  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  Loan  to \nthe  provincial  governments  in  each  of  the  project  towns  under \nsubsidiary  loan  agreements  (SLAs).  The  PUSOs  will  enter  into \nonlending  agreements  (OLAs)  with  their  provincial  governments  to \nimplement the physical aspects of the Project, commensurate with the \ninvestment  component  in  each  town.  The  costs  of  Part  B,  Project \nImplementation  and  Institutional  Development,  will  be  borne  by  the \nGovernment through the Loan. Subloans to the provincial governments \nand onlending to the PUSOs will have a term of 22 years, including a 4 \nyear grace period during which only interest payments will be required. \nThe  SLAs  and  OLAs  will  carry  an  interest  rate  of  1.5%,  plus  a  3% \ncharge  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economy  to  cover  the  foreign \nexchange rate risk and administration costs.

The  domestic \nconsulting  inputs  will  be  split  into  two  packages:  one  for  project \nmanagement,  design,  and  supervision;  and  the  other  for  institutional \ndevelopment.  The  services  of \ninternational  consultants  will  be \nindividually contracted.

Residents of \nthe  informal  settlement  areas  will  have  improved  access  to  water  and \nbathing  facilities,  and  are  expected  to  increase  their  consumption  of \nwater  as  a  result  of  no  tariff  increases.  The  Project  is  expected  to \nprovide over 41,000 person-months of income-earning opportunities for \nunskilled workers locally, and over 5,000 person-months of employment \nfor  skilled  construction  workers.  The  Project  will  also  enhance  local \ncapabilities,  contributing  to  project  sustainability,  and  help  sector \ninstitutions operate in a market-based economy.  \n \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  Mongolia  for  the  Integrated  Development  of  Basic  Urban  Services  in  Provincial  Towns \nProject. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \n2. \nIn  line  with  its  long-term  goals  for  the  urban  sector  of  promoting  balanced  regional \ndevelopment  and  improving  living  conditions,  the  Government  of  Mongolia  has  requested  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to assist in the integrated development of urban infrastructure \nand services in eight provincial capitals in the eastern and central regions.1 This Report is based \non  the  findings  of  the  Fact-Finding  Mission,  discussions  with  national  and  local  government \nagencies  concerned,  and  talks  with  international  organizations.  The  project  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1, and the project processing chronology is in Appendix 2. \n \nA. \n \n3. \nMongolia  urbanized  rapidly  in  the  second  half  of  the  20th  century,  and  the  trend \naccelerated  during  the  transition  from  a  centrally  planned  to  a  market-based  economy.  The \nurban population2 increased by 20%, to 1.4 million (about 58% of Mongolia\u2019s total population of \n2.4 million), from 1990 to 2000.3 More than half of these live in the capital, Ulaanbaatar, while \n10%  live  in  the  three  cities  of  Darhan,  Erdenet,  and  Choir.  The  remaining  40%  live  in  18 \nprovincial  capitals,  or  aimag  centers,  with  an  average  population  of  25,000.  The  18  provinces \nare  further  divided  into  324  rural  districts  (soums),  and  each  soum  is  divided  into  smaller \nadministrative  units  called  bags.  This  administrative  hierarchy  has  played  an  important  role  in \ngovernment  administration  as  well  as  in  the  delivery  of  basic  services  to  the  widely  dispersed \nrural  population.  As  the  administrative  and  service  centers  of  the  provinces,  the  18  provincial \ncapitals serve their own populations as well as the rural hinterlands. \n \n4. \nWhile all provincial capitals serve their respective provinces, some of the capitals have \nimportant regional roles. The meat-packing plants in Sainshand and Choibalsan, which export to \nRussia, serve livestock owners in a wide region covering most of the project provinces. Another \nproject town, Dalandzadgad, is the center of tourism and cashmere production in the southern \nGobi area. Prospects for oil and mineral exploitation are also creating demand for infrastructure \nservices  in  other  provincial  centers.  The  provincial  capitals,  where  most  nonagricultural \nemployment can be found, function as the economic centers of their rural hinterlands, and also \nlink urban industrial processing activities with agricultural and raw material supplies. \n \n5. \nHowever,  infrastructure  for  urban  services  in  the  provincial  capitals  is  seriously \ndilapidated and in urgent need of repair and improvement. In the early 1980s, Mongolia began \ndeveloping basic infrastructure and services in provincial capitals with financial assistance from \nthe former Soviet Union (FSU). When the FSU collapsed, the program stopped; some towns in \nthe  eastern  and  central  regions  ended  up  with  incompletely  installed  services.  At  the  end  of \n2000,  32%  of  the  urban  population  had  access  to  potable  water,  27%  to  district  heating,  and \n37%  to  waste  disposal  services.  Public  bathhouses,  largely  serving  informal  ger  (traditional \n\n                                                 \n1   The  towns  are  Baruun-Urt,  Bulgan,  Choibalsan,  Dalandzadgad,  Mandalgobi,  Sainshand,  Tsetserleg,  and \n\nUndurkhaan, with populations ranging from 13,000 to 39,000. \n\n2  The Law on the Legal Status of Cities Villages of 1993 defines urban areas based on population size: settlements \nof 15,000 people or more are cities, and settlements of at least 500 but less than 15,000 people are towns.  In this \nProject, the term \u201ctown\u201d is used in the general sense to indicate an urban center.  \n\n3  National Statistical Office of Mongolia 2001. Population and Housing Census 2000: National Results, Ulaanbaatar.  \n\n\f 2 \n\ncircular tent) areas, have substantially decreased, from 740 in 1990 to about 134 in 2000. This \nimportant  basic  urban  service  collapsed  as  a  result  of  sudden  privatization  in  the  early  1990s \nand the subsequent inability of the private sector to operate them on a commercial basis. The \nlack  of  funds  for  rehabilitation  and  periodic  maintenance  has  led  to  serious  deterioration  in \nurban  services  in  the  provincial  capitals  and  thus  to  shrinking  service  coverage  in  their  rural \nhinterlands.  Hence,  to  help  improving  the  productivity  of  the  urban  economy  and  to  sustain \nregional  service  functions,  basic  urban  services  such  as  heating  and  hot  water,  water  supply \nand  sanitation,  solid  waste  management,  and  bathhouses  in  provincial  capitals  must  be \nimproved and delivered efficiently.  \n \n6. \nIn  the  past  decade,  Ulaanbaatar  has  attracted  most  of  the  foreign  investment  in  urban \ninfrastructure  and  services  as  well  as  urban  migration,4  to  the  detriment  of  the  provincial \ncapitals.  Other  than  ADB\u2019s  investment  in  the  provincial  capitals  of  the  five  western  provinces5 \n(para.  11),  there  has  been  little,  if  any,  investment  in  improving  urban  service  delivery  in  the \nprovincial capitals. The Government\u2019s regional development policy aims to remedy this situation \nby  encouraging  investment  in  the  provincial  capitals,  thereby  correcting  the  imbalance  in \ninvestment  between  Ulaanbaatar  and  the  provincial  centers,  while  at  the  same  time  achieving \nmore balanced regional growth. \n \n7. \nA  second  level  of  imbalance  in  urban  investment  exists  within  the  provincial  capitals \nthemselves.  Socialist  planning  led  to  a  separation  of  formal  apartment  and  institutional  areas \nfrom informal ger areas. Formal areas have, to varying degrees, centrally provided heating and \nhot  water;  water  supply  and  sanitation;  solid  waste  collection;  and  a  full  range  of  educational, \nhealth,  social,  and  commercial  facilities.  On  the  other  hand,  services  are  minimal  in  the \nsupposedly  temporary  informal  ger  areas,  which  hold  at  least  half  of  the  population  of  the \nprovincial  capitals.  In  ger  areas  water  tanks  supply  neighborhood  water  kiosks;  sanitation \nfacilities take the form of on-plot pit latrines; and coal-, wood-, or dung-fired stoves are used for \nheating  and  cooking.  The  separation  of  the  two  communities  has  contributed  to  the \ndevelopment  of  towns  with  extensive  unused  open  space  and  low  densities,  making  service \ndelivery  more  costly.  In  a  typical  provincial  capital,  46%  of  the  residents  in  formal  settlements \nhave  connections  to  water  supply  versus  very  few  in  informal  areas.  Likewise,  households  in \ninformal  areas  pay  significantly  more  for  heating,  water,  and  solid  waste  disposal.  Water \nconsumption in the informal areas is low, typically 6\u201312 liters per capita per day, because the \nwater  costs  up  to  20  times  as  much  as  that  supplied  to  apartment  residents.  Hence,  in  all \nprovincial  capitals,  informal  area  residents  tend  to  subsidize  the  price  of  water  for  apartment \ndwellers. \n \nAccording  to  the  1998  Living  Standards  Measurement  Survey,6  some  36%  of  the \n8. \nnational population is poor, living below the weighted national poverty line of $17 per person per \nmonth.7  The  population  of  Ulaanbaatar  is  marginally  poorer  (34%  fall  below  the  poverty  line) \nthan  the  rural  population  (32%  below  the  poverty  line).  However,  those  living  in  provincial \ncenters  are  the  poorest,  with  45%  below  the  poverty  line.8  At  the  same  time,  the  average \nmonthly income of households living in ger areas is less than 70% of that of households living in \napartment areas. The critical poverty and livelihood prospects of the provincial capitals indicate \n                                                 \n4   During  the  last  decade,  the  urban  population  has  grown  on  average  at  3.3%  per  year  with  the  1.3%  per  year \n\ngrowth rate in rural areas, although Ulaanbaatar has grown most rapidly of all. \n\n5   ADB.  1997.

Living  Standards  Measurement \n\nSurvey 1998, Ulaanbaatar. \n\n7   Gross Domestic Product per capita in 1998 was $452 equivalent.  \n8   Based  on  1998  data,  reported  in  ADB,  2000.Country  Operation  Strategy:  A  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  for  ADB \n\nOperations in Mongolia (2000\u20132005), Manila. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nthat poverty reduction programs and measures should be targeted at these urban centers, and \nthat  the  imbalance  in  the  provision  of  infrastructure  and  services  between  formal  and  informal \nareas  should  be  redressed.  Targeting  provincial  capitals  for  assistance  is  consistent  with  the \nPoverty Reduction Strategy for ADB operations in Mongolia.  \n \nB. \n \nAn analysis of urban sector problems and constraints is presented in Appendix 3.9 A key \n9. \nconstraint  on  the  provincial  capitals  is  the  lack  of  a  long-term  financing  mechanism  for  capital \ninvestment  and  sustainable  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M).  Since  the  withdrawal  of \nsubsidies from the FSU, the sector has not attracted enough funds to stop the deterioration of \ninfrastructure  and  urban  services.  Low  capacity  constrains  private  sector  participation  and \nimproved service delivery through public-private partnerships. \n \n10. \nIn addition, local public service organizations, for lack of financial and managerial skills \nsuited  to  the  new  economic  situation,  have  not  been  able  to  optimize  the  provision  of  urban \nservices.  The  institutional  structure,10  which  is  dominated  by  the  provincial  governments,  has \nworsened  the  situation.  The  incomes  of  the  public  utility  companies  have  been  effectively \ncontrolled  by  the  provincial  governors,  but  it  is  not  clearly  defined  what  kinds  of  financial \noversight or responsibilities of the utilities are exercised by the local government. In 1997, the \nGovernment  initiated  the  establishment  of  public  urban  services  organizations  (PUSOs)  to \nprovide  water  and  sewerage,  and,  in  many  cases,  apartment  maintenance,  solid  waste \ncollection,  and  public  bathhouses  under  one  organization  for  delivery  efficiency.  However,  in \nmost provincial capitals, the PUSOs still operate as departments of the provincial governments, \nreporting principally to the provincial governor, and are thus limited in delivering urban services \nefficiently based on commercial principles. \n \n11. \nTo  address  these  concerns,  ADB  in  1997  approved  the  Provincial  Towns  Basic  Urban \nServices  (PTBUS)  Project  (footnote  5),  the  implementation  of  which  in  the  five  western \nprovincial  capitals11  has  given  clear  direction  to  urban  management  policy  and  coherence  in \ninstitutional,  technical,  and  financial  conditions.  Notably,  in  contrast  to  the  other  13  provincial \ncapitals,  where  population  has  decreased,  the  five  western  provincial  capitals  have  added  to \ntheir  population  over  the  implementation  period.  Their  PUSOs  have  also  acquired  critical \nknowledge and management skills. To make the other PUSOs more independent and financially \nsustainable,  the  Government  is  striving  to  introduce  market-based  management  in  their \nprovincial  capitals.  At  the  same  time,  the  Government  learned  from  the  PTBUS  Project  that  it \nwould  be  more  efficient  to  include  district  heating  as  one  of  the  PUSO\u2019s  service  delivery \ncomponents,  and  tariff  adjustments  should  be  enforced  within  consumers\u2019  affordability  and \nbased on cost-recovery principles.  \n \n12. \nThe  positive  experience  as  well  as  the  lessons  learned  from  the  PTBUS  Project  are \nrecognized  in  the  Government\u2019s  Action  Program  for  2000\u20132004,  which  was  approved  by  \nParliament in 2001. The Program calls for (i) replicating the principles of the PTBUS Project in \nother  provincial  capitals;  (ii)  improving  living  standards  and  urban  service  productivity  and \nefficiency; (iii) improving financial resource mobilization, particularly by expanding cost-recovery \nand  cost-sharing  mechanisms  including  tariff  adjustments;  and  (iv)  improving  urban  service \noperation and management. In an important shift in urban development policy, the Program also \nsituates  itself  in  a  regional  economic  development  context  by  identifying  five  economic \n                                                 \n9   Detailed sector analysis is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n10  Institutional  analysis,  including  the  capacity  of  public  urban  services  organization,  is  discussed  in  Supplementary \n\nAppendix E. \n\n11  Hovd, Moron, Olgiy, Ulaangom, and Uliastay. \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\nin \n\ninvestment \n\nthrough  coherent \n\ndevelopment regions\u2014western, northern, capital, central, and eastern. The proposed Project is \ndesigned to assist the Government in implementing the Action Program, and to strengthen the \neconomic and service functions of the provincial capitals in the eastern and central regions that \nlie  in  the  main  transportation  corridor,  connecting  the  Russian  Federation  and  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. \n \n13. \nTo  improve  national  economic  integration,  Parliament  in  2001  passed  the  Regional \nDevelopment Policy, which provides a conceptual framework for space planning and balanced \nregional  development \ninfrastructure  and  systematic \ndevelopment  of  urban  economic  centers  outside  Ulaanbaatar.  In  an  effort  to  increase \nagricultural  production  and  to  sustain  the  dispersed  distribution  of  the  population,  the \nGovernment  is  encouraging  people  to  remain  in  the  provinces  instead  of  migrating  to \nUlaanbaatar.  However,  multinational  development  agencies  have  not  yet  systematically \nsupported  implementation  of  the  policy.  The  activities  of  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme target small settlements in Mongolia\u2019s rural areas. The World Bank has focused on \nimproving access to water supply and sanitation in ger areas of Ulaanbaatar. The Japan Bank \nfor International Cooperation has provided assistance to improve water supply and sanitation in \nUlaanbaatar,  Gobialtay,  and  Mandalgobi;  and  to  rehabilitate  power  plants  in  rural  district \ncenters.  (External  assistance  to  the  sector  is  summarized  in  Appendix  4.)  Thus,  targeting \nprovincial  capitals  for  assistance  not  only  fills  a  gap  in  international  investment  but  is  also \nconsistent with the Government\u2019s Action Program and Regional Development Policy.  \n \n14. \nThe  proposed  Project  has  been  developed  in  close  consultation  with  the  development \ncommunity.  ADB\u2019s  strategic  emphasis  on  provincial  towns  is  fully  recognized  by  the \nGovernment, and policy dialogue on the design and the implementation of the Action Program \nhas  been  initiated  with  the  Government.  The  policy  dialogue  also  covers  (i)  integrating  basic \nurban  services  under  a  local  PUSO  for  efficient  service  delivery;  (ii)  corporatizing  PUSOs  as \nstate-owned  limited  liability  companies  to  operate  according  to  principles  of  good  corporate \ngovernance  and  to  be  businesslike  entities;  (iii)  promoting  public-private  partnerships  through \nforms of joint shareholding and management contracts for service delivery;12 (iv) strengthening \nthe  financial  management  capacity  of  PUSOs  for  decentralized  basic  service  delivery;  (v) \navoiding increases in real tariffs for the poor living in informal ger areas; and (vi) promoting full \ncost  recovery,  including  debt  service  and  O&M  costs,  through  an  integrated  approach.  A  plan \nfor  the urban sector is in Appendix 5, and the Policy Action Plan is in Appendix 6. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nProject Objectives, Rationale, and Area \n\n \nA. \n \n15. \nThe  long-term  goals  of  the  Project  are  to  (i)  support  balanced  and  equitable  regional \ndevelopment by promoting viable provincial urban centers that can provide support and services \nfor their rural hinterlands, and (ii) reduce urban poverty and improve living conditions for urban \nresidents  in  provincial  towns.  The  Project  is  classified  as  a  core  poverty  intervention:  at  least \n52% of the beneficiaries are poor,13 and the Project will directly help reduce poverty by giving \nthe poor better access to improved basic urban services. About 88,000 people in informal ger \nareas  are  expected  to  benefit  directly  from  the  rehabilitation  and  extension  of  urban  services. \nThe specific objectives of the Project are to (i) improve basic urban infrastructure and services \n                                                 \n12  Government Resolution No. 159 of October 1999 sets out the program for the privatization of the management of \nthe PUSOs, and State Property Committee Resolution No.123 of March 2001 provides guidelines on a renewable \n3-year management contract system. The Government encourages private sector participation in the management \nof urban service delivery.  \n\n13 Based on household surveys conducted in the project towns. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nin  provincial  towns  through  integrated  development,  (ii)  reduce  inequality  in  access  to  urban \nservices between residents of formal and informal areas, and (iii) strengthen the operation and \nmanagement capacities of the local PUSOs in order to achieve sustainable urban and regional \ndevelopment.  \n \nADB\u2019s intervention is based on the necessity to promote effective regional development \n16. \nby  integrating  physical  and  economic  development  strategies,  to  reduce  poverty  by  improving \nliving standards, and to improve the sustainability of investments in urban services. The Project \nwill  take  an  approach  that  conforms  to  ADB\u2019s  Urban  Sector  Strategy  as  well  as  the  Poverty \nReduction Strategy for ADB Operations in Mongolia (2000\u20132005). \n \n17. \nAt  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  fact-finding  stage,  the  Government \nsuggested  investigating  the  inclusion  of  12  provincial  capitals  focusing  on  the  eastern  and \ncentral regions (the six western provincial capitals, five of which were covered under the PTBUS \nProject, were excluded). The list was pared down to eight towns on the basis of several criteria, \nincluding  the  provincial  governments\u2019  willingness  to  borrow,  economic  growth  potentials,  and \nregional  and  provincial  centers  designated  by  the  Regional  Development  Policy.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  borrowing  capacity  also  influenced  the  number  of  towns  selected.  The  eight \ntowns are located within the eastern and central economic development zones, connecting the  \nRussian Federation and the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n  \nB. \n \n18. \nThe Project comprises two parts. Part A, Urban Infrastructure and Equipment, covers (i) \nrehabilitation of the centralized water supply systems and improvement of water distribution for \nthe residents of informal areas; (ii) improvement and extension of sanitation facilities, including \nsewage  treatment  works;  (iii)  refurbishment  and  replacement  of  heating  and  hot  water  supply \nsystems,  including  boilers  and  distribution  lines;  (iv)  provision  of  solid  waste  collection  and \nmanagement  equipment;  and  (v)  rehabilitation  of  public  bathhouses  and  the  provision  of  new \nbathhouses  to  serve  informal  areas.  Part  B,  Project  Implementation  and  Institutional \nDevelopment,  covers  (i)  project  management,  detailed  engineering  design,  construction \nsupervision,  and  implementation  support;  and  (ii)  institutional  capacity-building  programs  for \nPUSOs, including (a) a community participation and health education program, (b) a water loss \nreduction  program  and  training  in  O&M,  (c)  training  in  financial  management  and  corporate \nplanning for PUSOs, (d) land use planning and management, and (e) solid waste management \nplanning and training.  \n \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nPart A: Urban Infrastructure and Equipment \n\n \n19. \nThe  urban  infrastructure  and  equipment  investment  components  for  each  town  are \nsummarized  in  Appendix  7.  Infrastructure  improvements,  by  subsector,  are  summarized  in \nparas. 20-24. \n \n\na. \n\nWater Supply \n\n \n\nFor  all  towns,  the  Project  will  finance  (i)  rehabilitation  of  the  centralized  water  supply \n20. \nsystems,  including  refurbishment  of  pumps,  repair  and  replacement  of  broken  pipes,  and \nsystem  expansion  to  improve  system  efficiency;  and  (ii)  a  comprehensive  program  for  water \nloss  and  leakage  reduction,  including  metering.  Subsector  improvements  include  (i)  pipes  and \nmaterial  for  reducing  leakage  in  the  distribution  network;  (ii)  new  control  panels,  switch  gear, \ncabling, and electrical surge protection for pump houses; (iii) bulk meters for source wells and \npumping  stations,  and  pressure  gauges;  (iv)  meters  for  apartment  blocks,  commercial \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\nestablishments,  and  major  public  buildings  to  reduce  nonrevenue  water;  (v)  replacements  for \nplumbing fixtures in apartments and public buildings to reduce unaccounted-for-water; and (vi) \nlaboratory  equipment  for  water  quality  testing.  The  Project  will  also  improve  water  supply \ndelivery, accessibility, and affordability for the residents of the informal ger areas by increasing \nthe  number  and  location  of  water  distribution  points,  integrating  most  of  these  in  the  central \ndistribution system, and converting them to 24-hour self-service facilities. The improvements in \nthe  centralized  distribution  system  will  also  benefit  informal  area  residents,  as  more  water  for \ndistribution will be directly available in the system at lower cost to users. In addition, individual \nplot  connections  will  be  made  possible  in  selected  informal  areas  through  the  installation  of \ntertiary networks along the roads and footpaths.14  \n\n \nb. \n\n \n\nSanitation \n\nAll  project  towns  currently  have  a  centralized  sewage  treatment  plant  but,  except  for \n21. \nthose  in  Bulgan  and  Mandalgobi,  the  plants  are  dilapidated  and  the  equipment  does  not \nfunction.  The  Project  will  replace  the  dilapidated  plants  with  sewage  lagoons.  Project  work  in \nthis regard will include (i) construction of new lagoon treatment systems and provision of pumps, \n(ii)  rehabilitation  of  pumping  stations  with  new  pumps  and  fittings,  (iii)  repair  of  defects  and \nupgrading of the pipe network, and (iv) provision of individual connections to selected informal \nsettlements.  Since  most  informal  area  households  use  dry  pit  latrines,  the  health  education \ncampaign, to be implemented under the institutional development component of the Project, will \ncover best-practice construction and operation of pit latrines. \n \n\nc. \n\nHeating and Hot Water \n\n \nThe  Project  will  provide  for  the  extensive  upgrading  of  heating  plants  and  the \n22. \nrehabilitation of the hot water supply network serving buildings, except in Dalandzadgad.15 The \nproposed replacement of 37 boilers and the installation of 68 new heat exchangers will improve \nheat  transmission  efficiencies.  Improvements  will  include  (i)  refurbishment  and  replacement  of \nboilers  and  heating  lines,  (ii)  installation  of  hotwater  heat  exchangers  in  buildings  to  allow \nhotwater  connections,  and  (iii)  network  extensions  to  provide  for  individual  plot  heating \nconnections.  Wherever  possible,  small  systems  will  be  aggregated  to  increase  economies  of \nscale and to reduce emissions. \n \n\nd. \n\nSolid Waste Management \n\n \n23. \nIt has been a common practice in all towns to dump wastes a few kilometers outside of \nthe  town  premises  without  any  control.  Often  these  uncontrolled  dump  sites  stretch  over  3 \nkilometers.  To  reduce  casual  disposal  and  promote  efficient  management  of  solid  waste \ndisposal, the Project will (i) consolidate and fence sanitary landfill sites in four of the eight towns, \n(ii)  provide  new  landfill  management  equipment,  (iii)  provide  solid  waste  collection  trucks  and \ncommunal steel disposal bins, and (iv) prepare a comprehensive solid waste management plan \nfor  each  town  to  achieve  more  intensive  use  of  equipment  and  cost-efficient  routing  and \nscheduling.  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n14 The  exact  combination  of  ger  area  water  improvements  for  each  town  will  be  determined  at  the  detailed \nengineering  design  stage.  It  is  expected  that  80%  of  the  ger  area  residents  will  be  within  200  meters  of  a  water \ndistribution point. \n\n15  District heating in Dalandzadgad is provided by a state-owned electric power plant. Since the plant is owned and \noperated  by  the  Energy  Authority  of  Mongolia,  not  by  the  local  PUSO,  Dalandzadgad  will  be  excluded  from  the \nheating component. \n\n\f \n\n7\n\ne. \n\nBathhouses \n\n \n24. \nOnly  one  public  bathhouse  still  operates  in  most  of  the  towns,  and  they  are  old  and \ndilapidated. Due to the high cost of fuel for heating water during the 6 months of winter, these \npublic bathhouses require subsidies from the provincial government or PUSO in order to meet \noperating  costs.  The  Project  will  aim  to  (i)  rehabilitate  public  bathhouses  by  introducing  more \nefficient designs and heating technologies; replacing boilers, pumps, external pipe work, steam \nducts, heat exchangers, electrical switch gear, internal pipe work, shower fittings, and taps; and \nundertaking general building refurbishment; and (ii) provide at least one additional bathhouse in \nor  near  the  informal  areas,  connected  with  the  water,  hot  water,  heating,  and  sewerage \nnetworks.  Community  management  of  bathhouses,  including  the  spaces  for  complementary \nservices, will be encouraged. \n \n\n2. \n\nPart B: Project Implementation and Institutional Development \n\na. \n\nProject Implementation \n\n \nProject  implementation  includes  (i)  project  management  and  implementation  support, \n25. \ndetailed  engineering  design,  procurement,  disbursement,  construction  supervision,  budgeting, \nreporting,  overall  project  performance  monitoring,  coordination  with  relevant  government \nagencies  and  ADB,  and  resolution  of  issues;  (ii)  technical,  economic,  financial,  legal,  and \nmanagement advice; (iii) on-the-job training to improve the disbursement and procurement skills \nof project management office (PMO) staff; and (iv) equipment to support the PMO.  \n \n\nb. \n\nInstitutional Development \n\n \n26. \nThe  PUSOs  of  the  project  towns  are  the  principal  target  of  institutional  development, \nsince  they  bear  the  primary  responsibility  for  basic  urban  service  delivery.  This  component \nincludes  consultant  support  for,  training  of  PUSO  staff  in,  and  beneficiary  involvement  as \nrequired in the following: (i) a community participation and health education program, (ii) training \nin water loss reduction and O&M, (iii) financial management strengthening of PUSOs, (iv) land \nuse  planning  and  management,  (v)  assistance  in  solid  waste  management  planning,  and  (vi) \ncomputer  equipment  to  support  the  project  implementation  units  (PIUs).  The  institutional \ndevelopment program is summarized in Appendix 8. \n \nC. \n \nThe proposed Project responds to the priority areas of urban sector policy, institutional \n27. \ndevelopment, and cost recovery issues. The Project is designed to promote good governance \nand  private  sector  participation  through  public  administration  reform  and  institutional  capacity \nbuilding for improved service delivery. This will eventually strengthen public-private partnerships \nin capital investment, as well as efficient service delivery and management in a market-based \neconomy. \n \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nAppropriate Technologies \n\n \n28. \nThe Project will follow a least-cost approach to providing the required interventions and \nimprovements  in  basic  urban  services.  Existing  systems  will  be  rehabilitated,  instead  of  new \nones being built, to keep the costs low so that tariffs remain affordable to end users. The use of \nlocal materials and labor-intensive approaches was given priority in choosing among alternative \noptions.  Water  supply  rehabilitation  will  help  provide  more  reliable  service  and  produce \nquantitative as well as qualitative improvements in hygiene and health. In particular, extending \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\nwater  distribution  lines  to  ger  areas  will  reduce  the  time  spent  hauling  water  and  will  increase \nwater  consumption  by  low-income  households.  Given  the  cold  weather,  the  construction  of \noxidation ponds in place of the dilapidated sewage plants has been adopted as a cost-effective \nand  appropriate  technology.  The  district  heating  and  hot  water  supply  components  will  largely \nreplace  dilapidated  old  pumps  and  outdated  hotwater  heat  exchangers.  The  Project  will  also \nprovide  for  the  development  of  proper  landfill  planning  and  management  skills,  using  locally \navailable, low-cost materials and approaches. Overall, the Project will promote investments that \nare cost-effective and simple to operate and maintain in the context of technologies suitable for \nthe harsh winters in the country. \n \n\n2. \n\nCorporatization of PUSOs \n\n \n29. \nThe  Project,  through  the  proposed  institutional  development  program,  will  help  the \nPUSOs  become  state-owned  limited  liability  companies,  in  conformity  with  Mongolia\u2019s  1999 \nCompany  Law.  The  PUSOs  are  responsible  for  water  supply,  sewerage  systems,  apartment \nmaintenance,  public  baths,  district  heating  and  hot  water  supply,  and  in  some  cases  the \nmanagement of state-owned hotels. It has been agreed with the Government that the PUSOs in \nthe  project  towns  will  be  organized  to  develop,  provide,  and  operate  services  in  the  following \nsubsectors:  water  for  both  ger  areas  and  apartments,  sewerage,  public  baths,  solid  waste \nmanagement,  and  district  heating  and  hot  water.  The  corporatization  of  the  PUSOs  through \nformal articles of association will provide legal definition for their services and integrate the five \nbasic urban services subsectors. The five PUSOs in the western provincial centers covered by \nthe  PTBUS  Project  were  corporatized  in  1999,  and  the  Government,  through  the  Ministry  of \nInfrastructure (MOI), is committed to extending this organizational structure to the PUSOs in the \neastern and central regions. \n \n\n3. \n\nGood Governance and Management Capacity Building \n\n \n30. \nThe Project also aims to improve the management capability of PUSOs to plan, finance, \nand  manage  basic  services  and  to  implement  infrastructure  development  projects  in  a \nsustainable manner, both during and after the Project. Local government officials are technically \ncompetent  in  many  areas  but  are  hampered  by  (i)  decades  of  working  within  the  hierarchical \nstructures  of  a  command  and  controlled  economy,  and  (ii)  limited  management  capacity  and \nfinancial  autonomy  from  their  provincial  governments.  Staff  must  be  trained  in  financial \nmanagement  and  updated  corporate  planning.  The  corporatization  of  the  PUSOs,  as  state-\nowned  enterprises,  requires  that  they  establish  performance  agreements  with  their  provincial \ngovernments  and  operate  according  to  the  principles  of  good  corporate  governance  and \ncommercial  practice.  To  achieve  the  project  objectives,  the  PUSOs,  through  the  institutional \ndevelopment  program,  will  be  assisted  in  forming  new  relationships  with  their  provincial \nadministrations \ntheir \nresponsibilities as providers of basic urban services.  \n \n\nthem  more  effective  autonomy,  while  recognizing \n\nthat  will  give \n\n4. \n\nPublic-Private Partnerships \n\n \n31. \nThe Government is promoting public-private partnerships through joint shareholding and \nmanagement  contracts  for  service  delivery.  The  Project  will  encourage  the  private  sector  to \noperate  the  systems  built  by  local  governments.  The  Government  is  also  planning  to  contract \nout  the  management  of  PUSO  services  to  the  private  sector.  Under  the  institutional \ndevelopment  program,  participating  PUSOs  will  be  assisted  in  improving  their  corporate \ngovernance  and  financial  management  skills  to  attract  private  sector  participation  in  service \ndelivery. Consulting services will be provided in financial, legal, and contractual matters. \n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\n5. \n\nLand Use Planning and Management \n\n \n32. \nIn  all  the  project  towns,  urban  densities  should  be  increased  to  make  better  use  of \ninfrastructure and to promote the efficiency of urban development and land markets. Among the \nproposed  interventions  is  the  development  by  each  town  of  proper  urban  infrastructure  and \nservices  on  vacant  land  owned  by  the  local  government  and  the  auction  of  use  rights  to  the \nhighest bidders. Through the Project, staffs of participating PUSOs will be assisted in preparing \nland use plans and will be trained in management skills. The proposed component will promote \nprivate sector participation based on market economy principles. \n  \n\n6. \n\nCost Recovery and Subsidy \n\n \n33. \nAn important objective of the Project is to assist the PUSOs in generating more revenue \nfrom  their  own  sources  and  to  ensure  that  administration,  O&M,  and  capital  costs  are \nadequately covered. Tariffs will be increased so that PUSOs can meet their full cost recovery, \ntaking  into  account  O&M,  capital  investment  costs  and  debt  service  obligations.  At  the  same \ntime, the proposed tariff increase will always be below the generally accepted rule of household \naffordability, less than 6% of monthly income for water and sanitation, for example. To enhance \nthe  poverty  impact  of  the  Project  and  reverse  the  regressive  subsidies  to  apartment  dwellers, \ntariff  cross-subsidies  have  been  targeted  to  informal  ger  areas,  where  the  percentage  of \nhouseholds below the poverty line is higher than average. For families in these areas, tariffs for \nwater, sanitation, solid waste collection, and bathhouses will not increase until 2006 and have \nbeen  kept  constant  in  2002  prices.  The  targeted  internal  cross-subsidies  will  enhance  health \nand  personal  hygiene  among  poor  households  through  increased  access  to  water.  Funds \nrequired  to  subsidize  water,  solid  waste,  and  bathhouse  services  in  informal  areas  will  come \nprimarily  from  heating,  hot  water,  and  water  supply  charges  levied  on  organizations  and \napartment dwellers in the project towns. According to PUSO financial projections and evaluation \n(Appendix 9), sufficient surpluses will be generated to cover the subsidies.  \n \nD. \n \n34. \nThe  Project  will  cost  about  $26.5  million  equivalent\u2014$13.3  million  in  foreign  exchange \ncosts and $13.2 million equivalent in local currency costs. The cost estimates are summarized \nin Table 1. Further details of the base cost estimates, by town, are in Appendix 10. \n \nE. \n \nIt is proposed that ADB provide a loan of SDR 15.515 million ($20.1 million equivalent) \n35. \nfrom  its  Special  Funds  resources,  representing  76%  of  the  total  project  cost.  The  Loan  will \nfinance the entire foreign exchange cost of $13.3 million and $6.8 million equivalent of the local \ncurrency  cost.  The  PUSOs  will  contribute  the  equivalent  of  $2.8  million  for  incremental \nadministration  costs  and  interest  during  construction  in  the  towns.  The  Government  will  meet \nthe  remaining  project  cost  of  $3.6  million  equivalent  to  cover  the  taxes  levied  on  all  domestic \ntransactions, import duties, and administrative support and counterpart staff. The ADB Loan will \nbe repayable over 32 years with a grace period of 8 years and an interest charge of 1.0% per \nyear during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter.

The  PUSOs  in  the  various  towns  will  enter  into  onlending  agreements  (OLAs)  with  their \nprovincial governments to implement the physical aspects of the Project (Part A). The SLAs and \nsubsequent  OLAs  will  carry  an  interest  rate  of  1.5%,  plus  a  3.0%  charge  by  the  Ministry  of \nFinance and Economy (MOFE) to cover the foreign exchange rate risk and administration costs. \nThe  subloans  to  the  provincial  governments  and  the  PUSOs  will  have  a  term  of  22  years, \nincluding a 4-year grace period during which only interest payments will be required. This term \nis  broadly  consistent  with  the  average  economic  life  of  the  assets  to  be  implemented  through \nthe Project. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk from the 3% charge.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n \n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n37. \nThe  Executing  Agency  will  be  MOI.  The  Government  Implementing  Agency  for \nConstruction, Urban Development and Public Utilities (GIACUDPU), under MOI will implement \nthe  Project.16  The  PMO  has  been  established  within  GIACUDPU  and  headed  by  a  full-time \nproject director and staffed with persons having expertise in financial accounting, procurement, \nconstruction  supervision,  and  other  areas  as  appropriate.  In  each  town,  a  PIU  will  be \nestablished in the PUSO; its membership will comprise the PUSO director, the chief engineer, \nand  the  chief  accountant.  The  PIUs  will  coordinate  closely  with  the  PMO,  participate  in  each \nstage of project implementation, and advise on subproject design. A project steering committee \n(PSC)\u2014composed  of  senior  officials  from  MOI,  MOFE,  and  GIACUDPU  and  the  governors  of \nthe project aimags\u2014has been formed for high-level policy guidance and coordination. The PSC \nis chaired by the Vice Minister of MOI and will meet as required, but at least twice a year. To \nenhance ownership at the local level and participation by local communities, town consultative \ncommittees  (TCCs),  including  the  PUSO  director  as  chairperson,  the  speaker  of  the  local \nparliament,  the  head  of  the  National  Federation  of  Women,  and  a  staff  member  of  a  local \npoverty alleviation program office, will be formed. The TCC will keep the public informed about \nproject  activities  and  make  the  public's  views  known  to  the  PUSO.  Its  role  is  to  increase  the \ncommercial orientation of the PUSO and its independence from the provincial governor\u2019s office. \nThe TCCs will meet quarterly, in advance of the PSC meetings.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \nBecause  of  extreme  weather  conditions  during  the  winter  months,  the  construction \n38. \nseason  in  the  project  towns  ranges  from  5  to  7  months.  The  Project  is  expected  to  be \nimplemented  over  5  years,  with  preparatory  activities  starting  in  July  2002,  detailed  design  in \nOctober  2002,  procurement  and  contract  awards  in  2003,  and  construction  occurring  mostly \nfrom  2004  to  2007.  The  Project  is  expected  to  begin  in  January  2003.  The  project \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 11. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n39. \nProcurement of ADB-financed goods and services will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The  procurement  will  be  in  line  with  the  project \nimplementation  monitoring  system  and  Mongolia\u2019s  Public  Procurement  Law,  which  were \nprepared  with  ADB  assistance.17  Equipment  will  be  procured  by  international  competitive \nbidding  for  contracts  above  $500,000  equivalent,  international  shopping  for  contracts  above \n$100,000  equivalent  and  up  to  $500,000  equivalent,  and  direct  purchase  for  contracts  with  a \nvalue of $100,000 equivalent or less. Civil works with a value of $1,000,000 equivalent or less \nwill be carried out under local competitive bidding (LCB) and, for the installation of meters and \nplumbing  fixtures,  under  PUSO  force  account.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  procedures,  eligible \nforeign  contractors  may  bid  for  LCB  contracts.  MOI  will  provide  drafts  of  the  procurement \ncontracts  to  MOFE  for  review  before  the  contracts  are  finalized  and  signed.  Indicative \nprocurement packages are included in Appendix 12. \n \n                                                 \n16 The  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  as  well  as  the  implementation  arrangements,  are  discussed  in   \n\nSupplementary Appendix E. \n\n17  ADB.  2001.

Technical  Assistance  to  Mongolia  for  the  Development  of  Procurement  Legislation  and \nGuidelines. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f 12 \n\n4. \n\nLand Acquisition \n\n \n40. \nIn  Mongolia,  land  is  owned  by  the  Government.  No  new  land  will  be  required  for  the \nProject, as existing landfills and old dilapidated sewage treatment facilities will be rehabilitated \nand improved. No residents will be displaced as a result of project activities. \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n41. \nA total of 271 person-months of consulting services (35 international and 236 domestic) \nwill  be  needed.  The  international  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  (i)  water  supply  and \nsanitation  engineering,  (ii)  heating  and  hot  water  engineering,  (iii)  mechanical  and  electrical \nengineering,  (iv)  contracting  and  procurement,  (v)  urban  planning  and  land  management,  (vi) \nfinancial  management  and  accounting,  and  (vii)  management  information  systems  and \nmonitoring  and  evaluation.  The  domestic  consultants  will  have  similar  expertise,  as  well  as \nexpertise \nin  geotechnical  engineering,  regional  civil  works  coordination,  solid  waste/ \nenvironmental management, water loss reduction/O&M, and community participation and public \nhealth.  \n \n42. \nConsulting  services  will  be  provided  under  the  Project  to  (i)  assist  in  project \nimplementation by strengthening the PMO and PIUs, (ii) design and supervise the construction \nof  infrastructure,  and  (iii)  support  institutional  development  in  the  eight  towns.  The  project \nmanagement  and  design  and  supervision  services  will  be  combined  under  a  contract  with  a \ndomestic  firm,  while  the  institutional  development  support  will  be  provided  through  another \ncontract with a domestic firm. All international consultant services will be individually contracted. \nThe consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants18 and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement \nof  domestic  consultants.  MOI  will  provide  MOFE  with  drafts  of  the  consulting  contracts  for \nreview before contract signing. Outline terms of reference for consultants are given in Appendix \n13.  \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n43. \nAn  imprest  account  will  be  established  in  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB  to \nspeed  up  the  disbursement  of  the  loan  proceeds.  The  Government  may  withdraw  from  the \nimprest  account  to  pay  the  PMO  and  the  PUSOs  through  SLAs  for  eligible  project  expenses \nrelated  to  equipment  used  by  the  PMO  and  PIUs,  training  and  seminars,  force  account  work, \nand civil works contracts under LCB. The imprest account will be established in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook of January 2001 and detailed arrangements between the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  The  initial  deposit  in  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  $500,000. \nADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures  (SOE)  procedures  will  be  followed  in  liquidating  the  imprest \naccount and reimbursing individual SOE payments up to $50,000 equivalent. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n44.  MOI has built up substantial strength in project administration and in accounting through \nthe  PTBUS  Project.  Further  necessary  support  has  been  included  under  the  project \nimplementation component to improve the financial management skills of PMO staff. The PMO \nand  the  PIUs  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts.  The  PIUs  will  keep  records  of  all \n\n                                                 \n18  Effective 1 April 2002, the selection of consultants under ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants includes the \nuse of the quality and cost-based selection method. This method involves the simultaneous submission of technical \nand financial proposals and the use of price as an evaluation criterion. \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nsubproject  expenditures  and  forward  these  every  quarter  to  the  PMO  for  consolidation. \nIndependent auditors acceptable to ADB will audit the consolidated project accounts every year. \nCertified copies of the audited accounts in English will be submitted to ADB not later than nine \nmonths  after  the  end  of  the  financial  year  to  which  they  relate.  The  independent  auditors  will \nalso provide a separate audit report on the imprest account and the SOE. If the audited project \naccount  is  not  received  within  6  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  may  stop  replenishing  the \nimprest  account  and  processing  reimbursement  requests,  commitment  letters,  and  contract \nawards. If the audited project account is not received within 12 months after the due date, ADB \nmay  suspend  the  Loan.  The  PMO  will  submit  to  ADB  reports  and  information  concerning  the \nuse  of  the  loan  proceeds,  the  Project,  and  administration  and  financial  information  on  the \nPUSOs.  The  reports  will  include  (i)  monthly  progress  briefing  notes  summarizing  project \nactivities,  progress,  disbursements  procurement  issues,  and  planned  activities;  (ii)  semiannual \nprogress reports on project implementation; and (iii) a project completion report, within 3 months \nof the physical completion of the Project.  \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  a  comprehensive  program  for  project  performance \n45. \nmonitoring and evaluation (PPME) acceptable to ADB is carried out to (i) examine the Project\u2019s \ntechnical  performance;  (ii)  evaluate  the  delivery  of  the  planned  facilities;  (iii)  assess  the \nachievement  of  the  Project\u2019s  objectives;  and  (iv)  measure  the  Project\u2019s  social  and  economic \nbenefits.  A  set  of  PPME  indicators  will  be  developed  at  the  start  of  the  Project  by  the \nconsultants  and  staff  of  the  PMO  and  PIUs  in  consultation  with  the  local  communities.  PPME \nwill  be  integrated  into  the  management  information  system  of  the  PUSOs,  to  be  developed \nunder  the  institutional  development  program,  so  that  the  monitoring  of  social  and  economic \nbenefits can continue beyond project implementation. Annual PPME reports will be prepared by \neach  PIU,  then  consolidated  by  the  PMO  and  submitted  to  ADB,  with  a  copy  to  MOFE.  The \nintegrated  system  for  the  management,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  of  project  benefits,  social \nimpact, and physical improvements will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines for the Project \nPerformance Management System. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n \nBesides the regular reviews, ADB and the Government will undertake a comprehensive \n46. \nreview at the end of the first year when detailed design is completed. A midterm review will also \nbe undertaken within 30 months from loan effectiveness. These reviews will include a detailed \nevaluation  of  the  project  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  and  achievement  of  scheduled \ntargets. They will also cover the status of subproject progress and implementation, performance \nof  consultants,  institutional  development  components,  and  possible  reallocation  of  loan \nproceeds.  The  PMO,  with  the  environmental  consultant\u2019s  support,  will  prepare  an  annual \nenvironmental monitoring report and submit it for ADB\u2019s review. \n \n\n10. \n\nAdvance Action and Retroactive Financing \n\n \n47. \nBecause of the severe and long winters, construction work on the Project can be carried \nout  only  during  the  summer  (April\u2013October).  Delivering  construction  materials  and  procured \nequipment  to  eight  project  towns  also  complicates  project  logistics.  To  facilitate  physical \nimplementation,  predesign  activities  must  begin  in  2002.  Therefore  ADB  approved  advance \naction for the recruitment of consulting services for detailed engineering design. \n \n48. \nADB  also  approved  retroactive  financing  ($150,000,  or  less  than  1%  of  the  ADB  loan \namount) with respect to the advance payment for mobilizing the consultants. The Government \n\n \n\n\f 14 \n\nhas been advised that the approval of advance action and retroactive financing does not commit \nADB to finance the Project. \n \n\nIV. \n\nNONLENDING ASSISTANCE \n\nPublic Bathhouses \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n \nA. \n \n49. \nThe  Japanese  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  project,  Improving  the  Living \nEnvironment of the Poor in Ger Areas of Mongolia\u2019s Cities,19 is closely linked to the proposed \nProject. It will pilot innovative and sustainable approaches to addressing asset-related poverty in \nselected ger areas of cities in Mongolia. To improve the living conditions of the poor the JFPR \nproject  will  (i)  pilot  sustainable  opportunities  for  housing  finance  for  the  poor,  (ii)  demonstrate \nand  promote  environment-friendly  low-cost  housing  technologies,  and  (iii)  show  viable  and \nsustainable ways of operating public bathhouses. \n \n50. \nThe  JFPR  project  will  target  the  poor  and  low-income  groups  in  selected  ger \ncommunities in three cities20 covered by the Housing Finance (Sector) Project,21 and in the eight \ntowns  under  the  proposed  Project.  The  JFPR  project  comprises  the  following:  (i)  housing \nmicrofinance for the poor, (ii) low-cost demonstration houses, (iii) viable public bathhouses, (iv) \nincome-earning  opportunities  through  briquette  making  and  greenhouses,  and  (v)  project \nmanagement  and  poverty  impact  assessment.  While  the  housing  finance  and  housing \ndemonstration  components  will  be  implemented  initially  only  in  Ulaanbaatar,  the  bathhouse, \nbriquette making, and greenhouse components will be implemented in the Project\u2019s eight towns. \nTwo bathhouses will be built in selected ger areas in each of the eight project towns. \n \nB. \n \n51. \nThe  JFPR  project  will  pilot  a  new  approach  to  operating  public  bathhouses  on  a \nsustainable  basis.  Since  the  major  reason  for  the  inefficiency  of  bathhouses  is  their  high \noperating costs, which are largely related to the cost of heating fuel, the JFPR project will (i) use \nrenewable  solar-powered  heating  systems  for  hot  water  supply;  (ii)  finance  insulation  of \nbathhouses;  (iii)  promote  the  use  of  energy-efficient  boilers;  (iv)  finance  bathhouses  that  save \noperating costs by following new designs (smaller rooms, lower ceilings, shower facilities placed \nat the center, etc.); (v) select bathhouses to be integrated into the apartment service system to \nmake  water,  heating,  and  sewage  connections  available;  (vi)  generate  more  revenue  by \nextending bathhouse services to include other services such as laundries, small workshops, and \nsmall shops; and (vii) introduce social pricing based on a social service card registration system, \nwhich will ensure both poverty targeting and higher revenue generation.  \n \nC. \n \nAn innovative aspect of the JFPR project, which could be applied to components of the \n52. \nproposed Project, is a social pricing system based on the various categories of monthly income \nof poor households residing in the selected ger areas: (i) very poor: up to MNT50,000; (ii) poor: \nover  MNT50,000  and  up  to  MNT150,000;  (iii)  low  income:  over  MNT150,000  and  up  to \nMNT250,000;  and  (iv)  nonpoor:  more  than  MNT250,000.  Each  selected  ger  area  community \nwould distribute social services registration cards among the various categories of poor families. \n                                                 \n19  The JFPR Project (grant of $2.2 million) was approved by the Government of Japan on 21 December 2001, and \n\nSocial Pricing System \n\nwas approved by ADB\u2019s Board on 7 May 2002.  \n\n20 Ulaanbaatar, Darhan, and Dzuunmod. \n21  ADB.  2001.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to \n\nMongolia for the Housing Finance (Sector) Project. Manila.  \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nTo  ensure  fair  distribution,  the  local  poverty  alleviation  program  office  under  each  local \ngovernment  would  check  the  distribution  against  its  records  of  poor  families.  On  the  basis  of \ntheir social services card, poor families would pay different bathhouse tariffs: MNT200 per use \nfor  the  very  poor,  MNT500  for  poor  and  low-income  families,  and  full  price  (MNT800)  for  the \nnonpoor.  PUSOs  and  provincial  governments  could  adopt  social  pricing  using  social  services \nregistration  cards  for  other  services  for  the  very  poor  in  ger  areas  such  as  water  supply  and \nsolid waste collection.22 \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACT, AND RISKS \n\nSocial and Environmental Aspects \n\n \nA.  \n \n53. \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  have  a  high  level  of  community  involvement  in  design  and \nimplementation,  and  a  positive  social  impact.  The  improvement  in  living  conditions  resulting \nfrom the upgrading of basic urban infrastructure and services will contribute materially to social \nwell-being.  In  addition  to  facilitating  economic  development  in  the  project  towns  through \nremedial  investment  in  local  infrastructure  and  services,  the  Project  will  significantly  reduce \npoverty  in  the  8  towns.  Some  148,000  residents  of  the  project  towns  (of  whom  88,000  are  in \ninformal areas)\u201411% of the urban population of Mongolia\u2014are expected to benefit directly or \nindirectly  from  the  Project.  Rural  populations  are  also  expected  to  capture  the  benefits  of \nimproved  heating  in  schools,  hospitals,  dormitories,  and  public  bathhouses  during  the  winter \nmonths when they shelter in the project towns. The residents of the informal areas in particular, \nwhere  the  concentration  of  poverty  is  at  its  highest  in  Mongolia,  will  benefit  from  improved \naccess to water and bathing facilities, increased consumption of water with low tariff, and more \nefficient  solid  waste  management.  Children  from  these  areas,  who  now  collect  most  of  the \nwater, will be among the beneficiaries. Women, who in general are more likely to be poor, will \ndirectly  benefit  through  a  gender-inclusive  project  design  that  will  support  their  participation  in \nthe Project through (i) the community participation program; (ii) opportunities for entrepreneurial \nactivities, such as the provision of bathhouse services in the ger areas; and (iii) labor-intensive \naspects  of  project  implementation.  Additional  benefits  in  personal  and  household  hygiene \nthrough  improved  services  and  an  accompanying  health  education  component  will  positively \naffect the health of women and families. \n \nImprovements  in  heating,  hot  water,  water  supply,  and  sanitation  systems  will  also \n54. \nbenefit the residents of apartments and public and private organizations through more reliable \nsupply  and  lower  operating  and  maintenance  costs.  Improvements  and  extensions  to  the \nheating systems, which have substantially deteriorated in the past decade, will provide heat and \nhot  water  to  school  dormitories,  nurseries,  kindergartens,  hospitals,  offices,  and  apartments. \nMore efficient solid waste collection and disposal management will benefit the entire community \nin each town. The rehabilitation of bathhouses and the construction of two new bathhouses in \neach town will give significant public health benefits to the residents of informal areas, as well as  \nto some apartment residents.  \n \n55. \nThe Project will be implemented in each provincial town through local contracts that will \nprovide  significant  employment  for  local  people.  As  the  civil  works  will  adopt  labor-intensive \nconstruction methods, the Project should provide about 5,000 person-months of income-earning \nopportunities  per \nlabor  during \nimplementation).  Project  implementation  will  also  stimulate  the  local  construction  industry, \ngenerating  significant  direct  and  indirect  employment  opportunities.  The  computed  poverty \nimpact ratio of about 63% indicates significant pro-poor benefits, considering that the cumulative \n\ntown  on  average  (41,000  person-months  of  unskilled \n\n                                                 \n22 Affordability and subsidy schemes are discussed further in Supplementary Appendix F. \n\n \n\n\f 16 \n\nincome  share  of  the  poor  is  estimated  to  be  less  than  25%  of  the  total.  An  initial  poverty \nreduction and social analysis is found in Appendix 14. \n \n56. \nEnvironmental  benefits  will  be  realized  under  the  Project  through  efficient  wastewater \ndisposal.  The  project  towns  generate  solid  waste  with  little  organic  material  and,  hence,  little \nenvironmental  risk.  However,  abattoir  and  hospital  waste  in  several  towns  will  be  disposed  of \nseparately under the Project with the implementation of the solid waste management program. \nSewage  oxidation  ponds  and  solid  waste  disposal  sites  will  be  rehabilitated  to  eliminate \ncontamination of groundwater and nearby rivers. The rehabilitation of sites owned by the local \ngovernments  will  obviate  the  need  to  acquire  new  land  or  displace  local  residents.  Minor \nnegative  environmental  impacts  during  the  construction,  such  as  increased  dust,  noise,  or \ninconveniences to the neighborhood, will be monitored and mitigated by incorporating adequate \nprotection measures in the contract conditions. The PMO, with the support of the consultants, \nwill  follow  up  environmental  monitoring.  Provincial  government  environmental  protection  unit \nstaff will be trained to strengthen monitoring capacity. Water conservation will be promoted by \nundertaking  water  loss  reduction  and  consumer  awareness  programs.  No  indigenous  people \nare  affected  by  the  Project.  Supplementary  Appendix  H  gives  the  results  of  an  initial \nenvironmental examination. \n \n57. \nThe Project will help reduce operating costs resulting from the use of aging equipment \nand outdated practices. The installation of meters in apartments and other public buildings and \nan increase in tariffs for those with direct connections to the water supply system will encourage \nusers  to  limit  their  water  consumption.  On  the  other  hand,  improved  access  to  water  and \nreduced water tariffs for residents of informal areas should increase consumption from as low as \n6 liters per capita per day to at least 15 liters by the end of the Project. These improvements, \ntogether  with  the  leakage  reduction  component  of  the  Project,  will  avoid  the  need  to  produce \nmore raw water over the next two decades. \n \nB. \n \n58. \nIn all project towns, tariffs for water and sanitation services are now lower than operating \ncosts  and  would  fail  to  meet  the  full  O&M  costs  and  debt  servicing  of  any  loan.  Hence,  tariffs \nunder the Project are based on two objectives: (i) to enable full cost recovery of capital, interest \non debt, and O&M costs amortized over 22 years (including a 4-year grace period) at a rate of \n4.5%;  and  (ii)  to  maintain  affordability  of  the  three  major  consumer  groups  (organizations, \napartment dwellers, and informal area households). Water and sanitation tariffs together do not \nexceed the generally accepted norm of 6% of monthly expenditure. Significantly, the proposed \nwater tariff burden for informal area households is uniformly less than half of the accepted norm \nof  4%  of  household  expenditure.  By  keeping  tariffs  low  with  no  increase  in  real  terms,  the \nProject  will  help  increase  the  water  consumption  of  poor  informal  area  residents  to  almost \ndouble  within  their  affordability  limit  percentages  of  monthly  expenditure  for  apartment  and \ninformal area households.  \n \n59. \nThe  Project\u2019s  relending  term  has  been  carefully  designed  considering  the  Project\u2019s \nfinancial  issues,  i.e.,  keeping  the  principle  of  full  cost  recovery,  maintaining  affordability  to  the \nend beneficiaries, and strengthening the financial and institutional capacity of the PUSOs during \nthe  transition  toward  a  market  economy.  Through  the  4.5%  relending  rate,  the  Project  will \nchannel the concessionality of the funds to the end beneficiaries, allowing the PUSOs to keep \ntariff  increases  minimal,  financially  viable,  and  affordable  to  end  users  at  the  same  time. \nTherefore, the low relending rate will be applied to some extent as an implicit subsidy to the end \nbeneficiaries, but at the same time as a way to instill financial discipline in the PUSOs for cost \n\nFinancial Aspects \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nrecovery without hampering the principle of full cost recovery.23  The affordability, subsidy, and \nrelevant financial analyses are summarized in Appendix 15.  \n \n60. \nTo  keep  affordability  within  the  generally  accepted  norm  of  4%  of  household  monthly \nexpenditure  for  water,  and  6%  for  water  and  sanitation  together,  tariff  increases  will  be  kept \nminimal (no increase in informal residential areas, and less than 1% increase in real terms per \nyear in formal residential areas). The base-case financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) in the 8 \nproject  towns  range  from  3.6%  in  Dalandzadgad  to  6.2%  in  Sainshand.  All  FIRRs  are  well \nabove  the  real  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  2.5%,  in  spite  of  the  minimal  increase  in \ntariffs  required  to  maintain  affordability.  They  are  lowest  in  Dalandzadgad  and  Tsetserleg,  as \nheating and hot water services in these towns are provided by separate entities (the power plant \nin the former, and a separate company in the latter); incorporating these entities into the PUSOs \nwould significantly increase their revenues. On the other hand, FIRRs are high for Baruun-Urt \nand Sainshand, as the PUSOs derive most of their revenue from heating and hot water supply. \nIn general, the FIRRs are sensitive to declines in operating revenues. With a decline of 10%, all \nFIRRs except the components in Mandalgobi decrease below the real weighted average cost of \ncapital.  \n \n61. \nAn important objective of the Project is to assist the PUSOs in generating more revenue \nfrom  their  own  sources  to  sustain  the  administration  and  O&M  of  all  basic  infrastructure  and \nurban services. Full cost recovery will be achieved for the heating and hot water, water supply \nand sanitation, and solid waste components. To enhance the poverty impact of the Project and \nreverse the regressive subsidy to apartment dwellers, tariff cross-subsidies have been targeted \nat  informal  areas,  where  the  percentage  of  households  falling  below  the  poverty  line  is  above \nthe average. The overall subsidy is modest and is justified on the basis of (i) the health benefits \nthat  will  result  from  increased  access  to  water  supply  as  well  as  individual  water  supply  and \nsewerage connections in some informal areas, (ii) the high priority of informal area households \nfor  improved  solid  waste  collection  and  more  bathhouses,  and  (iii)  the  improvements  in \nenvironmental  cleanliness  and  therefore  in  health  and  productivity  among  informal  area \nhouseholds.  While  cross-subsidies  between  consumer  groups  are  extensive,  those  between \nsubproject components are limited, and exist mainly for bathhouses, all of which are located in \ninformal  ger  areas.  Funds  required  to  cross-subsidize  water,  solid  waste,  and  bathhouse \nservices  to  informal  areas  will  come  primarily  from  heating,  hot  water,  water  supply  and \nsanitation  charges  imposed  on  organizations  and  apartment  dwellers.  According  to  PUSO \nfinancial projections, sufficient surpluses will be generated to cover the subsidies. Following the \nsocial pricing concept, it should be possible to recover a substantial portion of the costs from the \nusers at affordable tariffs. \n \nC. \n \n62. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was  calculated  for  subproject  components \ncosting higher than $200,000, following ADB\u2019s Framework for the Economic Financial Appraisal \nof Urban Development Sector Projects.24 In particular, EIRRs were tested on water supply and \ndistrict heating with hot water supply components. The economic analysis was conducted based \non  a  domestic  price  numeraire,  and  the  economic  cost  of  capital  and  O&M  using  a  standard \n\nEconomic Aspects \n\n                                                 \n23 The relending rate of the PTBUS Project was set at 10% to cover the high foreign exchange rate risk prevailing at \nthe time of project processing in 1996. Under this proposed Project, the foreign exchange risk becomes much more \nmanageable than before. Given the stable exchange rate of the togrog  during the last 3 years, the relending rate of \n4.5% (1.5% Asian Development Fund term with MOFE\u2019s charge of 3% [2% for the foreign exchange rate risk plus \n1% administration fee]) is established to channel concessionality to the project end beneficiaries. \n\n24 ADB. 1994. Framework for the Economic Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f 18 \n\n \n\nconversion  factor  of  unity.  All  EIRRs  exceed  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12%. \nThe results of the economic evaluation are presented in Appendix 15.  \n \n63. \nThe economic evaluation of the water supply component is based on the benefits from \n(i)  improved  quality  of  nonincremental  water  supply  to  apartments  and  organizations,  and  (ii) \nincremental  water  supply  to  informal  area  households  and  newly  developed  plots.  The  water \nsupply improvements comprise benefits to public and commercial organizations and households \nwith connections and to households in informal areas that will have connections or will benefit \nfrom  improved  supply  to  local  water  kiosks.  Public  buildings  and  apartment  households  now \nconnected  to  the  central  system  will  benefit  under  the  Project  from  improved  quality  and \nreliability of piped water. Households in informal areas with new connections and those that still \nobtain  water  from  kiosks  will  benefit  from  the  quantity  of  incremental  water  resulting  from  the \nhigher level of service. The economic evaluation indicates that the water supply components in \nthree  towns\u2014Choibalsan,  Dalandzadgad,  and  Sainshand\u2014have  a  highly  satisfactory  EIRR \nranging from 46.3% in Choibalsan to 56.2% in Dalandzadgad. These are the three towns where \nthe  water  supply  is  most  efficient,  and  the  economic  value  of  both  the  nonincremental  and \nincremental  water  volume  is  quite  high.  While  the  EIRRs  are  lower  in  the  other  towns,  they \nremain well above the economic opportunity cost of capital (EOCC) of 12%. Sensitivity analysis \nindicates that EIRRs are robust with respect to changes in costs and benefits, though they are \nmarginally  more  sensitive  to  a  decrease  in  benefits.  In  general,  benefits  have  to  be  reduced \nsignificantly (ranging from 10% in Bulgan to 55% in Dalandzadgad) to push the EIRR below the \n12% EOCC level. \n \n64. \nThe  economic  viability  of  the  district  heating  and  hot  water  supply  component  was \nanalyzed  on  the  basis  of  (i)  the  economic  value  of  incremental  heat  supply,  estimated  as \nconsumers\u2019  willingness  to  pay  for  improved  heating  service;  and  (ii)  economic  cost  savings \nresulting from reduced losses of heat and hot water. EIRRs range from 23% to 58%, all above \nthe  EOCC  of  12%.  The  results  of  sensitivity  analysis  indicate  that  the  economic  viability  of \ndistrict heating with hot water in general is slightly sensitive to a reduction in benefits, compared \nwith  cost  increases.  However,  benefits  have  to  be  reduced  substantially  (from  31%  to  91%) \nbefore EIRRs fall down to the EOCC level of 12%. \n\n \n65. \nThe  sanitation  improvement,  solid  waste  management,  and  bathhouse  components  of \nthe Project have been selected on a least-cost basis. The benefits of these components relate \nprimarily  to  health,  environment,  and  poverty  reduction,  and  as  such,  were  assessed  in \nqualitative  terms.  Since  the  economic  cost  of  project  components  is  uniformly  less  than  the \nfinancial  cost  (adjusting  for  taxes),  the  results  of  the  financial  assessment  of  the  project \ncomponents provide an indication of their lower-bound estimates of economic merit. In addition, \nsince  all  components  will  have  positive  health  and  environmental  externalities,  they  are \nexpected to add substantial benefits from the improvement in public health through a reduction \nin  typhus,  diarrhea,  and  skin  diseases  such  as  scabies  resulting  from  (i)  an  increase  in  the \nquantity of water consumed by the informal area residents, (ii) an improvement in the quality of \nwater,  and  (iii)  an  improvement  in  the  health  of  children  in  the  informal  areas  because  of  the \nreduced  burden  and  energy  consumption  for  the  collection  of  water.  Several  unquantifiable \neconomic  benefits  of  the  Project  are  difficult  to  capture  in  the  analysis.  These  include  (i) \nimprovements in the environment because of the improved wastewater treatment and disposal \nof urban waste, (ii) improvements in the quality of urban life resulting from more reliable urban \nservices,  (iii)  increased  opportunities  for  local  enterprise  and  employment  through  the \ncommunity-type bathhouse facilities, and (iv) the use of labor-intensive construction methods for \nproject implementation to stimulate and support the economies of the towns and hinterlands.  \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nProject Risks \n\n \nD. \n \n66. \nThe main risks associated with the Project are (i) Government fiscal constraints, which \nmay  limit  the  availability  of  counterpart  funds;  (ii)  logistical  difficulties  associated  with  the  long \ndistances  from  the  capital  city  and  between  the  towns,  which  would  increase  transportation \ncosts;  (iii)  the  reluctance  of  provincial  governments  to  relinquish  sufficient  autonomy  to  the \nPUSOs to increase tariffs as necessary; and (iv) the limited institutional and financial capacities \nof  the  local  governments  and  PUSOs  to  sustain  the  Project.  The  first  constraint  is  general  to \nMongolia  and  is  not  Project-specific.  However,  this  risk  has  been  addressed  by  keeping  the \nproject  intervention  in  each  town  small  in  size,  thus  reducing  the  financial  demands  for  its \nimplementation.  The  potential  logistical  difficulties  of  the  Project  have  been  minimized  by \nselecting towns that form circular patterns outside the hinterland boundary of Ulaanbaatar in the \neastern  and  central  sections  of  the  country.  Local  governments  in  each  town  have  also \ndemonstrated a high commitment to the Project. Through the corporatization of the PUSOs and \nincreased  financial  independence,  an  arm\u2019s-length  relationship  will  be  developed  between  the \nPUSOs  and  their  provincial  governments.  Financial  discipline  has  been  introduced  in  the \nPUSOs by requiring them to borrow funds to implement infrastructure improvements. They must \nsustain  their  financial  performance  to  successfully  service  the  debt.  To  this  end,  commitment \ntoward  tariff  increases  during  project  implementation  has  been  obtained  from  the  PUSOs  and \ntheir  provincial  governments.  The  institutional  development  component  is  also  geared  toward \nmaking  PUSO  activities  financially  and  technically  sustainable.  The  limited  experience  of  the \nPMO and PIUs in project implementation and supervision has been addressed by providing for \nconsulting  assistance  in  implementation.  Experienced  personnel  and  lessons  learned  in  the \nimplementation of PTBUS Project will also benefit project implementation. The project PMO and \nPSC have been established to help minimize potential delays in Project startup. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n67. \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Central  Government  and  the  provincial \ngovernments of the project aimags have given the following assurances, which are incorporated in \nthe legal documents: \n\n \n1. \n\nPUSO Corporatization  \n\n \nThe  central  and  provincial  governments  will  ensure  that  for  each  PUSO,  except  as \n68. \notherwise  agreed  on  with  ADB,  (i)  all  five  basic  urban  services  subsectors  in  the  project  town \n(water  supply,  sanitation,  solid  waste,  heating  and  hot  water  supply,  and  bathhouse  services) \nare integrated into the PUSO\u2019s operations; (ii) the PUSO is duly established as a state-owned \nlimited  liability  company  under  the  1999  Company  Law,  with  a  management  board,  auditors, \nand articles of association authorizing the PUSO to engage in the services described in item (i) \nabove,  as  appropriate,  and  to  borrow  funds;  and  (iii)  separate  accounting  for  each  of  the \nservices described in item (i) above, as appropriate, is undertaken.  \n\n \n\nTariff Determination  \n\n2. \n \n69. \nThe central and provincial governments will ensure that, except as otherwise agreed to \nby  ADB,  the  tariffs  for  water,  sanitation,  solid  waste,  heating  and  hot  water  supply,  and \nbathhouse services in the project towns are as set forth in the tariff schedule that the central and \nprovincial  governments  and  ADB  agree  on  (Supplementary  Appendix  I).  Starting  in  2004,  the \n\n \n\n\f 20 \n\nCentral  Government  and  the  relevant  provincial  government  will  ensure  that  the  calculation  of \ntariffs for water, sanitation, solid waste, heating and hot water supply, and bathhouse services in \neach  project  town  is  based  on  the  principle  of  full  cost  recovery,  taking  into  account  capital \ninvestment  costs,  debt  service  obligations  and  O&M  costs.  Tariffs  will  be  reviewed  yearly  and \nadjusted  as  necessary,  in  accordance  with  this  principle.  With  respect  to  the  residents  of \ninformal areas, during the term of the Loan there will be no increase, in real terms, in the tariffs \nfor water, sanitation, solid waste, heating and hot water supply, and bathhouse services that are \nset  forth  in  the  tariff  schedule,  until  otherwise  agreed  on  with  ADB.  If  tariffs  are  increased  for \ninformal  areas  during  the  term  of  the  Loan,  the  PUSO  and  ADB  will  review  and  agree  on  the \ncalculation of future tariffs for such urban services subsectors.  \n \n70. \nThe central and provincial governments will ensure that project bathhouses (i) are cross-\nsubsidized  by  the  PUSOs  in  a  manner  acceptable  to  ADB;  and  (ii)  charge  according  to  the \nsocial pricing system formulated under ADB\u2019s JFPR Project, Improving the Living Environment \nof the Poor in Ger Areas of Mongolia\u2019s Cities. \n\n \n71. \nEach  provincial  government  will  ensure  that  (i)  the  PUSO  submits  annually  to  its  tariff \nregulatory  board  tariff  proposals  calculated  according  to  the  principle  of  full  cost  recovery \ndescribed  above;  and  (ii)  tariffs  thus  set,  and  the  obligation  to  pay  them  on  time,  are  valid, \nbinding, and enforceable on all consumers and entities, including government-owned entities.  \n\nManagement Contracts  \n\n \n3. \n \n72. \nIf  a  PUSO  proposes  to  enter  into  a  contract  for  the  management  of  its  operations \npursuant  to  Order  No.  123  of  22  March  2001  of  the  State  Property  Committee,  the  provincial \ngovernment will ensure that the PUSO consults with ADB before and during the tendering of the \ncontract  and  that  the  draft  tender  documents,  draft  management  contract  (including  the \nprovisions  to  ensure  that  the  delivery  of  public  urban  services  for  the  poor  are  not  adversely \naffected by the contract), and award of contract are acceptable to ADB.  \n\n \nFinancial Matters  \n\n  \n4. \n \n73. \nThe  central  and  provincial  governments  will  ensure  that  (i)  adequate  budgetary \nresources  are  provided  on  time  to  the  PMO  and  the  PUSOs  throughout  the  project \nimplementation  period;  and  (ii)  no  domestic  or  international  loan  funds  for  water  supply, \nsanitation,  solid  waste  services,  heating  and  hot  water  supply,  or  public  bathhouses  are \nprovided to any of the PUSOs without the prior approval of ADB. \n\nConflicting Laws or Regulations  \n\n \n5. \n \n74. \nThe  central  and  provincial  governments  will  ensure  that  no  legislation,  regulation, \nresolution,  decree,  order,  rule,  or  other  legal  act  limits,  interferes  with,  or  alters  the  project \nobjectives  or  implementation  arrangements  set  forth  in  the  Loan  Agreement  without  prior \nconsultation with ADB. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement Matters  \n\n \n6. \n \nThe central and provincial governments will ensure that all project facilities are located \n75. \nwithin  existing  government-owned  lands  that  are  vacant,  and  that  no  resettlement  will  be \ninvolved. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nEnvironmental Matters  \n\n7. \n \n76. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  (i)  project  implementation  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  applicable  environmental  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  environmental \nguidelines,  in  particular,  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Requirements  and  Procedures;  (ii) \nall  monitoring  and  mitigation  measures  indicated  in  the  initial  environmental  examination  are \ncarried  out  during  project  implementation;  (iii)  project  implementation  will  include  consultation \nwith local communities on environmental issues; and (iv) the environmental monitoring capacity \nof solid waste management will be strengthened. \n  \n \nB. \n \n77. \nLoan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  for  the  procurement  of  equipment  under  the  Project \nsubject  to  the  conditions  that  (i)  except  as  otherwise  agreed  with  ADB,  all  eight  PUSOs  have \nbeen  duly  established  and  registered  as  state-owned  limited  liability  companies  under  the \nCompany  Law;  and  (ii)  SLAs  and  OLAs  acceptable  to  ADB  have  been  duly  executed  and \ndelivered and are binding on their respective parties. \n \n\nConditions for Disbursement \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n78. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSpecial Drawing Rights 15,515,000 to Mongolia for the Integrated Development of Basic Urban \nServices  in  Provincial  Towns  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest \ncharge at the rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a \nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as \nare  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project  Agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \n \n \n\nTADAO CHINO \n   President \n\n09 July 2002 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \nDesign Summary \n1.

Develop the capacity of \n\nGovernment Implementing \nAgency of Construction and \nUrban Development \n(GIACUDPU) and Ministry of \nInfrastructure (MOI) to monitor \nand promote improved PUSO \nperformance. \n\n1.  Develop the PUSOs\u2019 capacity \n\nfor effective operational \npractices to fulfill their mandated \nfunctions in a market-based \nenvironment. \n\n \nReview and advise on the development of a mutually \nsupportive relationship between the PUSO and the aimag \ngovernment. \n \nBased on agreed upon performance indicators, develop \nprotocols for defining the operational independence of the \nPUSOs vis-\u00e0-vis the aimag government. \n \n \nDevelop a mechanism in which the PUSOs can consult \neffectively with the local communities to ensure their \nparticipation in the design and implementation of the \nProject. \n \nReview institutional relationship between PUSOs, and \npower sector heat suppliers, and recommend efficient \nframework by which PUSOs can effectively coordinate \nwith private sector as well as state-owned power \nsuppliers for district heating/hot water supply services. \n \nAssist MOI and GIACUDPU to develop a public utilities \nmonitoring system benchmarking key physical, financial, \nand social data. \n \nDevelop an exchange mechanism whereby the PUSOs \ncan gain from the experience of others through the \nexchange of information, training, and consulting \nservices. \n \n\nConduct a legal, operational, organizational, and \nadministrative diagnostic of each of the project PUSOs. \n\n \nFacilitate the development of corporate and business \nplans for each of the project operations, \nmanaged/accounted for separately. \n \nDevelop performance indicators for PUSOs. \n\nTarget Date \n \n \nJun 2003 \n \n \n \nJan 2004 \n \n \n \n \nJan 2004 \n \n \n \n \nJun 2004 \n \n \n \n \n \nDec 2003 \n \n \n \nDec 2004 \n\nCurrent Status \n\n \n\n \nPUSO operations are based on public sector \noperations in which the aimag governor makes \nall critical PUSO decisions. \n \nTo operate independently of political pressure, \nprivate and joint venture PUSOs must have a \ntransparent, mutually supportive relationship with \naimag government. \n \nDuring the project preparation stage, community \nconsultation and participation were incorporated \nin developing the project. The practice should be \nincorporated during project implementation in a \nsystematic way. \nEnergy sector law is vague about the suppliers \nand distributors of small-size district heat \ngenerators. \n \n \n \nAt present, neither MOI nor GIACUDPU monitors \nthe operations and performance of PUSOs. \n \n \nThere is potential to improve overall PUSO \nperformance by observing the practices and \nexperience of other PUSOs. \n\nJun 2004 \n\n \n \nDec 2004 \n \n \n \nJun 2004 \n\nAlthough most PUSOs are organizationally \nsimilar, their performance varies depending on \nexisting staff and equipment. \n \nPUSOs do not have corporate or business plans, \nand most operations are not accounted for \nseparately. \n \nThere is no mechanism to monitor performance \nof PUSOs. \n \n\nB.

The objectives of the program are to (i) minimize the amount of water \nlost  from  the  system  during  production  and  delivery;  (ii)  develop  consumer  awareness  and \nincentives  to  reduce  wasteful  practices  and  repair  leaking  fixtures;  (iii)  create  sustainable \nprograms  in  each  town  so  that  wastage  reduction  objectives  are  maintained  in  the  future;  (iv) \ninstitute  maintenance  management  systems  so  that  PUSOs  can  obtain  the  data  required  to \nidentify the true cost of operating and maintaining individual assets in their system; (v) provide \nspecific training in the operation and maintenance of the new systems and equipment provided \nby the project; and (vi) provide training in water meter reading in conjunction with a water loss \nreduction program. Designs for water system improvements will incorporate metering so there \ncan be an accurate accounting of water produced up to the point of sale. Water meters provided \nby the Project will be installed in each apartment building such that residents can be billed for \nactual  usage,  which  creates  an  immediate  incentive  to  reduce  wastage,  as  opposed  to  the \npresent  flat  rate  system.  The  program  will  work  in  conjunction  with  the  community  awareness \nprogram  so  that  residents  are  introduced  to  the  concepts  of  water  metering  and  water \nconservation practices, and so that they are aware of the assistance available with replacement \nfixtures. The program will help PUSOs to analyze component maintenance cost, and to prioritize \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  activities  with  the  PUSOs  such  that  changes  in  tariff \nstructure  are  coordinated  with \nfixture  replacement. \nImplementation  will  require  that  the  PUSOs  be  supplied  with  computers  and  software.  PUSO \npersonnel  who  will  operate  these  systems  will  be  given  the  training  in  their  operation  and \nassistance in the establishment of documentation systems and in the restructuring of reporting \nand communication responsibilities that will be necessary. \n \nB. \n\nCommunity Participation and Health Education \n\nintroduction  of  metering  and \n\nthe \n\n3. \nTo  organize  and  carry  out  a  community  participatory  development  approach,  the  town \nconsultative  committee  in  each  town  will  be  the  target  group  for  the  training,  while  involving \nstakeholders from the affected communities. The objectives of the program are to (i) achieve a \nsignificant degree of community participation in urban management, (ii) establish public support \nfor  the  Project  including  actions  to  reduce  the  negative  consequences  of  tariffs  and  metering \nreforms  for  formal  area  residents,  and  (iii)  promote  the  benefits  that  will  materialize  from  the \nProject  through  health  education  and  public  awareness  programs.  Each  town  has  designated \ncommunity leaders, local branches of the National Women\u2019s Federation, and poverty alleviation \nprogram offices. Participation of communities will be achieved through open meetings involving \nthese existing offices, community organizations, as well as leaders and residents representing \nindividual  ger  areas.  The  scope  of  the  program  includes  (i)  informing  the  community  of  the \nscope and nature of the Project; (ii) involving the community in designing and implementing the \nProject;  and  (iii)  meetings  to  address  the  need  to  (a)  increase  bathing  and  laundry  for  health \npurposes; (b) handle solid waste disposal in a hygienic way; and (c) switch water sources from \na river or open wells to piped supply, with of particular emphasis on waterborne diseases such \nas  diarrhea,  fevers,  or  skin  and  eye  infections.  The  program  will  identify  the  activities, \ninstitutional  responsibilities,  organizational  arrangements,  and  implementation  schedule.  It  is \ncritical that the information dissemination and public consultations start prior to the completion of \nthe detailed engineering design of the project components so that community participation in the \nproject  design  will  be  ensured.  The  awareness  program  will  include  messages  on  the \nimportance  of  hygiene  and  sanitation  practices,  and  the  relationships  among  these  practices, \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n33 \n\nLand Use Planning and Management   \n\nTraining in Financial Management and Corporate Planning  \n\nwater, and good health. The awareness program will also be delivered through radio and local \nmedia, targeting the community as a whole. \n \nC.  \n \nPUSO management staff, accountants, and directors are the main target of the training. \n4. \nThe objectives of the program are (i) the introduction of financial management accounting and \ninformation  systems  that  are  prerequisites  to  (a)  improve  the  operational  efficiency  of  the \nPUSOs, (b) provide measures of their performance, and (c) create effective internal corporate \ngovernance;  and  (ii)  the  determination,  introduction,  and  maintenance  of  tariffs  covering  all \nactivities  conducted  by  the  PUSOs  that  are  designed  to  meet  basic  financial  criteria. \nInternational  and  domestic  consultants  will  work  with  small  task  forces  in  each  PUSO  in  five \nstages of work: (i) developing a business plan for the PUSO in each project town; (ii) developing \nand implementing an appropriate and locally compatible financial and management accounting \nsystem and supporting documentation that will produce annual financial statements and regular \noperational  reports;  (iii)  delivering  accountancy  training  modules;  (iv)  developing  practical \nguidelines and appropriate formulas for setting tariffs to recover full investment and O&M costs; \nand  (v)  establishing  an  institutional  framework  and  mechanism  within  the  Ministry  of \nInfrastructure to monitor and determine their relative operational efficiency and performance. \n \nD. \n \n5. \nLand  use  planning  is  a  development  tool,  by  which  each  town  can  strategize  future \neconomic  activities  and  infrastructure  development  needs.  The  PUSO  director,  operation \nmanagement  staff,  as  well  as  the  chief  engineers  of  each  town  will  be  assisted  by  the \nconsultants in land use planning. The objectives of the program are to (i) strengthen the town \nand  provincial  governments\u2019  land  use  planning  and  management  capacity;  (ii)  introduce  the \nconcepts  of  land  management  in  a  market  economy  to  local  administrations  and  their \ncommunities; (iii) develop best practice systems for the process of allocating land; (iv) assist in \nthe  revision  of  master  plans;  (v)  assist  with  the  programming,  pricing  and  management  of \nhousing  action  area  planning  schemes  and  their  establishment  as  amendments  to  the  master \nplans.  \n \nE. \n \n6. \nThe  objectives  of  the  program  are  to  (i)  work  with  the  PUSOs  to  prepare  solid  waste \nmanagement  plans  that  define  the  policy,  institutional,  financial,  and  operational  requirements \nfor effective collection, treatment, and disposal for both formal and informal areas of the project \ntowns; and (ii) identify and provide capacity building, training and support as may be required to \npromote good practice and economic efficiency in solid waste management. This will involve (i) \nidentifying  constraints  to  the  existing  services  and  least-cost  technical  and  operational \nupgrading  options;  (ii)  projecting  domestic,  municipal,  and  industrial  solid  waste  volumes  and \nfuture  disposal  capacity  requirements;  (iii)  identifying  current  and  projected  special  and \nhazardous  wastes,  (including  clinical  and  toxic  wastes);  (iv)  determining  the  institutional  and \ncapital  equipment  requirements  necessary  to  meet  the  projected  collection,  treatment,  and \ndisposal  requirements  identified;  and  (v)  undertaking  financial  analyses  to  determine  the \ncharging  structure  required  to  achieve  full  cost  recovery  of  the  investments  taking  account  of \ndifferential tariffs among household, municipal, commercial, and industrial generators. \n \n \n\nSolid Waste Management Planning and Training  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nFINANCIAL EVALUATION OF PUBLIC URBAN SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS \n\nRevenue Projections \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nWater Sales.  (Table  A9.1)  Total  revenues  have  been  projected  by  multiplying  the \nproposed  tariff  rates  (Supplementary  Appendix  I)  for  the  three  groups  of  customers \n(organizations,  apartments,  and  informal  areas)  by  the  respective  forecasts  for  annual  water \nsales. Tariff rates used in the financial projections have been based on tariff increases agreed \nupon  with  the  Government  at  the  time  of  loan  processing.  In  2007,  the  year  full  operation  will \ncommence,  these  rates  will  range  from  MNT509  per  cubic  meter  (current  price)  in \nDalandzadgad  to  MNT5,958  per  cubic  meter  in  Baruun-Urt  for  organization  customers,  from \nMNT284  in  Bulgan  to  MNT958  in  Tsetserleg  per  person  per  month  for  apartment  customers, \nand will be MNT1,400 per cubic meter for all informal area customers. Increases in water sales \nhave been projected from the actual sales figures for 2001 based on new connections proposed \nin new plot areas and 20% increase in water consumption in informal areas. Town population is \nset  constant,  and  it  is  estimated  that  150  liters  per  capita  per  day  of  water  consumption  are \nrequired for formal areas. \n \n2. \nHeating  Sales.  Heating  sales  revenues  are  derived  from  monthly  standing  charges \nlevied based on cubic meters of office space for organization customers and on square meter of \nroom size for apartment customers. There is no heating service in informal areas. The tariffs in \n2007 at current price ranges from MNT424 in Undurkhaan to MNT1,179 in Baruun-Urt per cubic \nmeter  of  building  per  month  for  organization  customers,  and  from  MNT74  in  Mandalgobi  to \nMNT298  in  Choibalsan  per  square  meter  of  floor  size  per  month  of  apartment  customers. \nDalandzadgad does not have heating revenue, as the heating service is operated by the Energy \nAuthority of Mongolia  \n \n3. \nOther  Revenues.  Other  revenues  come  from  hot  water,  sanitation,  solid  waste,  and \nbathhouses.  Hot  water  revenue  is  calculated  based  on  gigacalories  (or  1,000,000  kilocalorie) \nconsumption  for  organization  customers  and  per  person  for  apartment  customers.  Hot  water \ntariffs in 2007 at current price range from MNT3,077 in Mandalgobi, Tsetserleg, and Bulgan to \nMNT3,328 in Undurkhaan per gigacalorie for organization customers. The tariffs for apartment \ncustomers  are  MNT531  in  Tsetserleg  and  MNT709  in  Choibalsan  per  person  per  month.  The \naverage  sanitation  charge  is  estimated  at  80%  of  water  tariffs  charged.  Solid  waste  revenues \nare  calculated  based  on  tons  of  waste  generated  from  organization,  per  person  for  apartment \ncustomers, and per family for informal areas. The bathhouse revenue is assumed to be constant \nin real terms. \n \nB. \n\nExpenditure Projections \n \n4. \nPersonnel  Costs.  Personnel  costs  include  salary  and  social  payments  for  all  staff \nemployed by PUSOs. In this analysis, it was assumed that the number of employees remains \nthe  same  except  those  subprojects  with  new  boiler  plants,  bathhouse,  water  service  unit,  and \nsolid  waste  management  subcomponents.  Salary  is  constant  in  real  terms.  Personnel  costs, \nhowever, would increase due to inflation. \n \n5. \nDepreciation.  Depreciation  of  fixed  assets  has  been  calculated  using  the  straight-line \nmethod based on the nature of the fixed assets. No salvage value is assumed in the projections. \nEquipment  and  vehicles  are  depreciated  on  an  average  asset  economic  life  of  10  years. \nBuildings, pipes, and other fixed assets are depreciated over 40 years. There is no reevaluation \non  existing  fixed  assets.  Therefore,  those  existing  fixed  assets  will  continue  be  recorded  and \ndepreciated  at  historical  cost.  It  is  expected  that  there  will  be  a  major  rehabilitation  and  repair \nafter 10 years.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n35 \n\n  \nElectricity and Coal. There would be some saving on the usage of electricity and coal \n6. \ndue to the replacement of new water pumps and new equipment on the boiler plants under the \nproject.  The  total  electricity  and  coal  expenses  will  be  increased  as  the  supply  of  hot  water \nincreases.  The  electricity  tariff  and  coal  price  are  assumed  constant  in  real  terms  and  will  be \nadjusted in line with inflation.  \n \n7. \nInterest.    All  project  capital  costs  are  assumed  to  be  funded  by  loans  to  public  urban \nservices organization (PUSO) at a cost of 4.5% per year, with repayment of loan principal over \n22  years  inclusive  of  a  4-year  grace  period  commencing  in  2007.  Repayments  of  the  loan \nprincipal are assumed to increase in real terms during the course of the repayment period. The \nforeign exchange risk will be borne by the Government. The current portion of long-term loans, \nbeing the amount payable within a year, is included as a current liability in the balance sheet. \n \n8. \nTax.  Value-added  tax  is  calculated  at  15%  on  civil  works,  equipment,  vehicles,  and \nadministrative  support  works.  Custom  duty  is  assumed  at  5%  on  imported  goods  and \nequipment. Income tax at a rate of 10% of net income has been assumed. \n \nC. \n \n9. \nLocal inflation is assumed to be 6% per annum during the forecast period. The exchange \nrate is assumed to have averaged about MNT1,100 per dollar during 2002 and is assumed to \nremain constant at the current rate of MNT1,100 per dollar throughout the forecast period. \n \nD. \n \n10. \nThe income statement, cash flow statement, and balance sheet projections are based on \nthe  anticipation  that  the  Government  will  implement  the  tariff  rates  proposed  in  the  loan \nagreement.  Details  of  the  evaluation  and  the  proposed  tariff  schedule  are  contained  in \nSupplementary Appendix I. The current tariffs in all PUSOs are below the required tariffs and do \nnot  generate  enough  revenue  to  meet  the  debt  service  ratios.  The  financial  projections  reveal \nthat  all  PUSOs  are  financially  sustainable  over  the  projection  period.  While  Baruun-Urt  and \nMandalgobi  have  negative  retained  earnings  during  the  implementing  period,  the  retained \nearnings will become positive in 2012 and 2009, respectively. In 2007, full operation and debt \nservice  of  the  loan  will  start.  A  summary  of  2008  projected  financial  evaluation  ratios\u20141  year \nafter operations commence\u2014is presented in Table A9.1.  \n \n\nInflation and Exchange Rates \n\nFinancial Evaluation \n\n1. \n\nProjected Financial Performance \n\n \n11. \nThe  operating  ratio  measures  the  performance  for  the  level  of  operating  revenues \nconsumed  by  operating  costs.  Projected  operating  ratios  of  eight  PUSOs  are  from  66%  in \nChoibalsan  to  97%  in  Baruun-Urt.  Five  PUSOs  have  ratios  below  80%,  which  shows  that  the \noperating costs are within a reasonable level. Baruun-Urt\u2019s high operating ratio will be improved \ngradually  to  80%  by  2012.  Percentage  growths  in  revenue  are  from  8%  in  Sainshand  and \nMandalgobi  to  16%  in  Tsetserleg.  The  percentage  growth  shows  that  all  PUSOs  will  have \noperating revenues increase over the whole projection period. Baruun-Urt has a negative return \non fixed assets and Dalandzadgad has zero return in 2008. This is due to significant increase in \nthe  cost  of  sales  as  a  result  of  operating  of  new  boiler,  and  depreciation.  The  return  on  fixed \nassets  for  both  PUSOs  will  become  positive  in  2009  and  continue  to  improve  throughout  the \nprojection period.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTable A9.1: Projected Financial Evaluation Ratios of PUSOs, FY2008 \n\nFinancial Indicators \n\nBulgan  Choibalsan  Dalandzadgad  Mandalgobi  Undurkhaan \n\nSainshand \n\nTsetserleg \n\n36 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nBaruun- \nUrt \n97 \n\n11 \n\n-2 \n\n74 \n\n11 \n\n2 \n\n0.76 \n\n6.18 \n\n2.73 \n\n1.3 \n\n0.76 \n\n0.58 \n\n1.29 \n\n1.64 \n\n66 \n\n9 \n\n3 \n\n6.05 \n\n1.37 \n\n0.59 \n\n1.96 \n\nOperating ratio (%) \n \nGrowth in revenue \n(%) \nReturn on fixed \nassets  (%) \nCurrent ratio \n \nDebt/equity ratio  \n \nDebt to assets ratio \n \nDebt service ratio \n\n   \n\n82 \n\n14 \n\n0 \n\n3.5 \n\n1.52 \n\n0.62 \n\n1.31 \n\n76 \n\n8 \n\n2 \n\n3.00 \n\n1.49. \n\n0.61 \n\n1.81 \n\n73 \n\n13 \n\n2 \n\n3.23 \n\n1.57 \n\n0.63 \n\n1.50 \n\n81 \n\n8 \n\n2 \n\n4.62 \n\n1.41 \n\n0.60 \n\n1.56 \n\n70 \n\n16 \n\n2 \n\n2.93 \n\n1.63 \n\n0.63 \n\n1.36 \n\n2. \n\nProjected Financial Position \n\n \n12. \nThe  projected  current  ratios  of  all  PUSOs  except  Baruun-Urt  are  above  2  to  1  through \nthe whole debt service period.

Yes \n\nA. \nSector identified as a National Priority in        \nCountry Poverty Analysis?  Yes  \n Contribution of the urban sector to reduce poverty in Mongolia:  \n \n1. \nand the Government on 24 March 2000, endorsed the poverty analysis and the long-term visions of \npoverty reduction. Review of the PPA in 2001 concluded that (i) ADB should adopt a more balanced \napproach in addressing urban and rural poverty, and (ii) infrastructure should be given increased \nemphasis. The Project will contribute to achieving the objectives of the Poverty Reduction Strategy for \nADB operations in Mongolia (2000-2005) by improving urban infrastructure in informal ger areas, \ncontributing balanced regional development, creating short-term employment opportunities for the poor, \nand promoting good governance of public service utility organizations. \n \n2. \nAbout  40%  of  the  urban  population  live  in  18  provincial  capitals  or  aimag  centers.  Provincial \ncapitals function not only as the administrative service centers but also as the economic focuses of their \nrural  hinterlands,  as  most  of  the  non-agricultural  employment  in  the  provinces  is  located  there.  To \ngenerate  maximum  benefits  and  increase  the  productivity  of  the  urban  population,  efficient  delivery  of \nbasic  urban  services,  such  as  heating  and  hot  water,  water  and  sanitation,  solid  waste  management, \nand bathhouses, is an essential condition. However, in the past decade, Ulaanbaatar has attracted most \nof  the  foreign  investment  in  urban  infrastructure  and  services  to  the  detriment  of  the  aimag  centers. \nUrban  services  in  the  provincial  capitals  are  seriously  dilapidated  and  in  urgent  need  of  repair  and \nimprovement.  \n \n3. \nPoverty means more than lack of adequate income, and involves multidimensional aspects. For \npoverty reduction, the Project aims to improve the quality of living standard, while redressing two levels \nof  imbalance:  (i)  unequal  regional  development  between  Ulaanbataar  and  provincial  capitals,  and  (ii) \nunequal  access  of  basic  urban  services  by  the  poor  living  in  informal  ger  areas.  For  the  former,  the \nProject  focuses  on  the  development  assistance  for  the  provincial  capitals  where  poverty  incidence  is \nhigher than the national average. For the latter, the Project emphasizes (i) the expansion and provision \nof the basic urban services to the informal ger areas where poverty incidence is likely to be twice as high \nas in the formal residence areas, and (ii) tariff reform to lower service charges to affordable levels for the \npoor  informal  ger  areas  residents.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  also  contribute  to  improving  the \ngovernance  of \ninstitutional  development \ncomponents. \n \n4. \nThe  total  population  of  the  eight  provincial  towns  is  estimated  to  be  about  148,000,  of  whom \n60% live in informal ger areas. With an integrated development approach, all the residents in the project \ntowns are expected to have benefits through improved water supply, sanitation, public baths, solid waste \ndisposal,  and  district  heating.  The  project  poverty  impact  ratio  is  63%,  substantially  higher  than  the \nincome share of the poor. In addition, it is estimated that a total of 46,500 person-months of construction \nemployment  opportunities  (unskilled  41,000  person-months,  and  skilled  5,500  person-months)  will  be \ngenerated over the 5 years of implementation. The Project\u2019s impact on employment generation will be \nhighly significant and will positively influence local economic activities.  \n \n \nB. \n\nProposed Classification : Core Poverty Intervention \n\nlocal  service  delivery  organizations \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\nthrough  various \n\n \n\n \n\n5.  Poverty  incidence  statistics  by  project  towns,  average  of  all  18  provincial  capitals,  and  national \naverage is summarized in Table A14.1. Also, the economic impact of the Project on the poor is analyzed \nthrough  the  calculation  of  poverty  impact  ratios  (PIRs).  The  PIR  expressing  the  proportion  of  net \neconomic benefits accruing to the poor has been calculated for the Project as a whole by comparing the \nnet economic benefits to the poor with the net economic benefits to the Project as a whole. All financial \nand  economic  values  are  given  in  constant  2002  prices  and  in  present  value  terms.  The  net  present \nvalues of economic and financial returns of the Project and subprojects are estimated at 12%. The net \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n43 \n\npresent  values  are  derived  from  the  financial  and  economic  analyses  conducted  for  the  Project  as  set \nout  in  Appendix  15.  Project  beneficiaries  are  divided  into  three  major  groups:  informal  ger  area \nresidents, formal apartment residents, and the government economy as a whole. The extent of benefits \nto  the  poor  is  expressed  by  the  percentage  of  poor  in  each  group,  as  determined  by  project \nsocioeconomic surveys. In the case of net economic benefits to the Government, it is assumed that 50% \nof the return to the Government will be shared by the poor, as the weighted average percentage of the \npoor in the eight towns is about 50%. Table A14.2 shows that the PIR for the Project as a whole is 63%, \nsubstantially higher than the income share by the poor, which is estimated at 25% of cumulative income. \n \n \n \nTable A14.1: Percentage of Poor and Very Poor in Project Towns \nAimag center \n\nTotal  \n\nPopulation ('000) \nTotal \nPoor (a) \n\n% of population in\nInformal \nGer Areas\n\n% Poor  Formal \nAreas \n\nPer Capita \nPoverty \nThreshold in  \nMNT(a) \n\nAverage \nHousehold \nMonthly Income \nin  MNT  \n\nAverage Daily \nWater \nConsumption \nper Capita in \nGer Areas  \n\n25\n41\n65\n18\n12\n38\n50\n20\n-\n40\n\n75\n59\n35\n82\n88\n62\n50\n80\n-\n60\n\n5 \n5 \n17 \n7 \n5 \n7 \n5 \n9 \n60 \n8 \n\n15 \n15 \n39 \n13 \n14 \n16 \n18 \n18 \n148 \n19 \n\n71%\n58%\n51%\n45%\n67%\n45%\n28%\n51%\n-\n51%\n\n19,900\n18,200\n14,500\n15,600\n15,600\n19,300\n15,600\n14,500\n-\n-\n\nBaruun-Urt \nBulgan \nChoibalsan \nDalandzadgad \nMandalgobi \nUndurkhaan \nSainshand \nTsetserleg \nTotal \n8 towns average \n18 provincial towns \n46%\naverage  \nNational average  \n36%\n(a)  Internal Information Report of the Poverty Alleviation Program Office, at the end of 1999. \nSource: Statistical Yearbook of Mongolia, 2000; project preparatory technical assistance consultants\u2019 survey results \nat the end of 2001.  \n \nTable A14.2: Project Poverty Impact Ratio (MNT million) \nA.

The  local  public  service \norganizations\u2019  decision  on  the  selection  and  prioritization  of  components  was  also  incorporated  in  a \nparticipatory manner, involving relevant government officials, community leaders, and representatives of \neach  ger  area,  particularly  the  poor  and  women.  To  strengthen  the  project  design  and  enhance  the \nsustainability  of  the  Project,  a  community-based  participatory  approach  to  project  planning  and \nimplementation,  as  well  as  public  health  awareness  education  involving  the  communities  will  be \nemphasized during all phases of project implementation. To enhance community ownership at the local \nlevel  and  participation  by  the  local  communities,  town  steering  committees  will  be  formed,  which  will \ninclude the head of the women\u2019s organization and the secretary of the poverty alleviation program office. \nEmphasis  will  be  given  to  the  participation  of  women  in  the  Project  through  (i)  the  community \nparticipation  program;  (ii)  opportunities  for  entrepreneurial  activities,  such  the  provision  of  bathhouse-\nrelated  services  in  the  ger  areas;  and  (iii)  involvement  in  labor-intensive  aspects  of  project \nimplementation.

Through  the  Project,  over \n41,000 person-months of income-earning opportunities for unskilled laborers\u2019 will be generated, which will \nlargely  benefit  the  poor.  The  Project  aims  to  increase  the  average  water  consumption  level  from  the \ncurrent average of 8 liters per capita day to 30 liters per capita day on average, when informal ger area \nresidents  connect  to  the  improved  water  system  (ranging  up  to  50  liters  per  capita  day  after  individual \nconnections).  Also,  with  the  installation  of  meters  in  apartments  and  public  buildings,  the  after-project \nwater  consumption  level  is  expected  to  decrease  to  some  100  liter  per  capita  per  day,  once  apartment \ndwellers have to pay for consumption per liter as opposed to the present flat monthly per person rate. The \nservice gap between formal and informal areas will be reduced in a longer term by gradually reducing the \ncurrent  regressive  subsidies  from  informal  poor  areas  to  formal  apartment  areas.  Currently,  the  water \ntariff  in  informal  areas  is  almost  10  times  higher  than  that  in  formal  apartment  areas.  To  reduce  this \nunequal  service  gap,  the  real  tariffs  on  all  project  services  to  informal  ger  areas  will  be  kept  constant, \nwhile average tariffs for services (not only for water but all other services including district heating and hot \nwater supply) to formal apartment dwellers and organizations will be increased in real terms. Hence, as \ncosts  increase,  basic  services  to  ger  area  residents  such  as  water  supply,  solid  waste  collection,  and \nbathhouses  will  be  provided  at  less  than  full  cost.  As  the  tariff  increase  in  the  formal  apartment  areas \nwould be limited by their affordability during the project implementation period, the extent of reversing this \nregressive subsidy scheme will take longer than the project period. Hence, from both sides of consumer \ngroups, while still existing, the level of service differential will be significantly reduced through the Project \n(Table A14.3).  \n \n \nTable A14.3.

In addition, economic analysis has been conducted following \nADB Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Water Supply Projects. The main objective of the \nevaluation  is  to  determine  various  aspects  of  financial  and  economic  feasibility  of  the \nsubprojects in each town.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nFIRRs  have  been  prepared  for  the  integrated  subprojects  in  each  project  town \ncomprising  heating  and  hot  water,  water  supply  and  sanitation,  solid  waste  management,  and \nbathhouse  components.  The  analysis  has  been  carried  out  using  projected  public  urban \nservices organization (PUSO) finances, with and without the Project, up to 2017, i.e., 10 years \nafter assumed project completion. In most cases, 3 years, 1999-2001, have been used as the \nbase years, as before that time reliable records do not exist for the various entities, which were \nmerged to become the present day PUSOs. The analysis is expressed in constant 2002 prices \nand  is  based  on  (i)  the  estimated  cost  of  the  Project  components  inclusive  of  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  and  depreciation;  (ii)  implementation  over  the  period  2003-2007;  (iii) \nprojections  of  operating  revenues  and  costs,  with  and  without  the  Project;  and  (iv)  a  real \nweighted average cost of capital of 2.5% for the Project. With-Project assumptions are based on \nenhanced  revenues  due  to  increased  tariffs  for  public  and  commercial  buildings  and \napartments, as well as the savings that will occur to overall service production as a result of the \nProject. Tariff for informal (ger) areas have been kept constant in 2002 prices, while increases \nfor commercial/public buildings and apartments have been kept as low as possible to maintain \naffordability  and  enhance  political  and  consumer  acceptance.  Details  of  subproject  and \nindividual  component  FIRR  calculations  are  contained  in  Supplementary  Appendix  F  and \nAppendix 5 of the Town Feasibility Studies. \n \n3. \nOverall,  the  integrated  FIRRs  are  adequate  in  spite  of  the  minimal  increase  in  tariffs \nrequired  to  maintain  affordability.  The  base  case  FIRRs  in  the  eight  project  towns  vary  from \n6.2% in Sainshand to 3.6% in Dalandzadgad, which are above the real weighted average cost \nof capital of 2.5%. They are the lowest in Dalandzadgad as heating and hot water services are \nprovided  by  a  state-owned  power  company,  the  power  plant  of  which  also  supplies  district \nheating  to  the  town.  FIRRs  are  high  for  Baruun-Urt  and  Sainshand,  as  heating  and  hot  water \nsupply  the  majority  of  revenue  for  these  PUSOs.  Mainly  due  to  the  minimal  level  of  tariff \nincreases,  the  FIRRs  are  sensitive  to  declines  in  operating  revenues.  The  FIRRs  of  individual \ncomponents in each town all exceed 4%. Although the analysis of the individual subcomponents \nshows  that  they  are  quite  viable  on  their  own,  the  Project  will  be  investing  in  the  integrated \nservices of the PUSOs and not in individual subcomponents. \n \nC. \n \n4. \nTariffs  have  been  set  to  match  household  affordability  levels  as  well  as  the  ability  of \nPUSOs  to  meet  their  associated  debt  service  obligations.  Tariffs  for  heating,  hot  water,  water \nsupply,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  management  have  been  increased  annually  an  average  of \n2.7% over the domestic inflation rate for public/commercial buildings and only 0.4% per year for \n\n \nTariffs and Household Affordability   \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n47 \n\nSubsidies and Cost Recovery \n\napartments.  Given  the  low  real  rate  of  tariff  increases,  the  average  total  tariff  burden  for \napartment dwellers is 7.2% of monthly expenditure and only 1.5% for water and sanitation. The \naverage  total  tariff  burden  for  informal  area  households  is  4.3%  of  monthly  expenditure,  with \nwater  tariffs  less  than  the  2%  target  of  monthly  household  expenditure.  By  keeping  tariffs \nconstant in real terms, the Project will contribute to increase the water consumption level of poor \nfamilies in informal areas, almost double (from the current average 8 liters per capita per day to \nover  15)  within  the  general  rule  of  4%  affordability  limit.  Percentage  tariff  increases  for  all \nservices and percent of monthly expenditures spent by apartment and informal area households \non basic services are set out in Supplementary Appendix F. Detailed tariff tables and projections \nare contained in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \nD. \n \nTo  enhance  the  poverty  impact  of  the  Project  and  reverse  the  present  regressive \n5. \nsubsidy  to  apartment  dwellers,  tariff  cross-subsidies  have  been  targeted  at  informal  areas, \nwhere  the  percentage  of  households  falling  below  the  poverty  line  is  extremely  high.  The \nbathhouse component, which provides bathing facilities for poor families in informal areas, is not \nfinancially  viable  and  is  therefore  the  target  of  cross-subsidies  from  other  financially  viable \ncomponents.  Under  the  social  pricing  scheme  for  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction-funded \nbathhouses, tariffs for very low and low income families will be substantially lowered such that \nthese  families  will  be  spending  roughly  half  as  much  on  bathhouse  facilities  as  they  are  at \npresent.  Funds  required  to  subsidize  water,  solid  waste,  and  bathhouse  services  to  informal \nareas  will  be  derived  primarily  from  revenues  from  heating  and  hot  water  and  water  and \nsanitation charges to organizations and apartment dwellers. The overall subsidy to informal area \nresidents is modest and is justified on the basis that the country\u2019s economy is still in a state of \ntransition, and the fact that the private sector has not developed to the point that it can efficiently \nserve  low  income  households.  The  cross-subsidies  are  also  justified  based  on  (i)  the  health \nbenefits  that  will  result  from  increased  access  to  water  supply  as  well  as  individual  water  and \nsewerage connections in some informal areas, (ii) the high priority of informal area households \nfor improved solid waste collection and more bathhouses, and (iii) the improved environmental \ncleanliness  and  resultant  improvements  in  health  and  productivity  among  informal  area \nhouseholds. \n \nE. \n \n6. \nThe  economic  analysis  of  the  Project  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Water  Supply  Projects  and  Framework  for  Economic \nand  Financial  Appraisal  of  Urban  Development  Sector  Projects.  A  standard  conversion  factor \nhas been calculated based on Bank of Mongolia data. The shadow exchange rate factor in 2000 \nwas calculated to be 1.018, the inverse of which, 0.978, is the standard conversion factor. Since \nthe standard conversion factor is so close to unity, it does not appear that component costing, \nwhich  is  presently  at  the  preliminary  engineering  stage,  is  very  sensitive  to  shadow  exchange \nrates. The economic analysis of the water supply components for each project town has been \nconducted using a domestic price numeraire. Due to distortions in the labor market, mainly the \ndifficulty  in  mobility  of  labor  among  the  project  towns,  a  shadow  wage  rate  factor  of  1.2  has \nbeen  applied  to  skilled  labor  and  0.8  to  unskilled  labor.  Following  the  guidelines  set  out  in \nFramework  for  Economic  and  Financial  Appraisal  of  Urban  Development  Sector  Projects, \nsubproject components of which the base costs are higher than $200,000 have been the subject \nof the economic analysis. In general, economic analyses have been carried out on the Project\u2019s \nwater supply and heating components.  \n \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Evaluation of Water Supply \n\n7. \nThe economic evaluation of the water supply component is based on the gross benefits \nfrom (i) the improved quality of non-incremental water supply to apartments and organizations, \nand  (ii)  the  substantial  incremental  water  supply  to  informal  area  households  and  newly \ndeveloped  plots.  The  water  supply  improvements  comprise  benefits  to  public  and  commercial \nbuildings  and  apartment  households  with  existing  connections  as  well  as  to  households  in \ninformal areas that will have new connections or improved supply to local water kiosks. Benefits \nfrom non-incremental water were valued at the average supply price in economic terms, while \nbenefits from incremental water were valued at willingness-to-pay prices. Willingness to pay for \nincreased  water  consumption  was  determined  according  to  the  results  of  the  feasibility  study \nsocioeconomic survey in each of the project towns. Details of the economic calculations for the \nproject  towns  are  contained  in  Supplementary  Appendix  F  and  Appendix  6  of  the  Town \nFeasibility Studies. \n\n \n8. \nThe  results  of  the  economic  evaluation  indicate  the  water  supply  components  in  three \ntowns, Choibalsan, Dalandzadgad and Sainshand, have substantially high EIRRs ranging from \n56.2% in Dalandzadgad to 27.6% in Sainshand. These are the three towns where the existing \nwater  supply  is  most  difficient,  and  the  economic  value  of  both  the  non-incremental    and \nincremental water volume is quite high, while the EIRRs in the other towns remain well above \nthe economic opportunity cost of capital of 12%.  \n \n\n2. \n\nEconomic Evaluation of Heating \n\n \n9. \nGiven  the  fact  that  the  Project\u2019s  heating  component  comprises  some  45%  of  the  total \ninvestment,  an  analysis  was  carried  out  on  the  economic  viability  of  the  district  heating \ncomponents  in  each  project  town.  The  economic  analysis  is  based  on  the  following \nassumptions: \n \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\ncapital and O&M costs for each town net of taxes and duties; \nsavings in O&M costs due to the subproject; and \nincremental consumer heat supply is valued on the basis of willingness to pay for \nheating.  The  incremental  heat  supply  results  from  heating  being  supplied  to \nadditional  apartments  and  institutions,  savings  resulting  from  reduced  losses \nfrom boilerhouses, reduced wasteful heat in the main heating lines, and reduced \nlosses in hot water from apartment dwellers tapping radiators for hot water.  \n\n \nIn  general,  the  EIRRs  are  substantially  higher  than  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of \n10.  \ncapital of 12%, varying from 23.4% in Choibalsan to 58.7% in Mandalgobi. This result is to be \nexpected for two reasons: (i) the substantial difference between project financial and economic \ncosts,  where  taxes  are  20%  on  equipment  (15%  value-added  tax  and  5%  import  duty),  15% \nvalue-added  tax  on  civil  works,  and  10%  corporate  tax  on  the  PUSOs;  and  (ii)  the  substantial \nwillingness  to  pay  for  heating,  a  necessary  service  in  the  winter  time,  which  has  been \ndeteriorating  in  quantity  and  quality  over  the  past  decade  in  all  project  towns.
