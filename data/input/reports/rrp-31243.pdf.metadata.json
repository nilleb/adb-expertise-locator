It will support the \nGovernment\u2019s Regional Development Policy and Action Program and \nwill increase the management capacity of local public urban services \norganizations (PUSOs) in the eight provincial capitals. \n \nRationale    Mongolia\u2019s rapid urbanization in the late 20th century has created an \n  urban population of 1.4 million people (about 58% of the country\u2019s \ntotal). As the capital, Ulaanbaatar, gained primacy in the last decade, it \nattracted the most foreign assistance, to the detriment of balanced \nurban and regional development. About 40% of the urban population \nlives in the provincial capitals, which are expected to serve not only the \ntowns themselves but also their rural hinterlands. Because of the lack \nof  funds  for  rehabilitation  and  periodic  maintenance,  urban  service \ninfrastructure in these towns is seriously dilapidated and in urgent need \nof repair. Provincial capitals function as the economic centers of their \nrural hinterlands, as most of the agroprocessing and nonagricultural \nemployment in the provinces is located there. The provincial capitals \nneed to improve their service coverage of the towns in their provinces \nso that they can function as sustainable regional economic centers as \nwell as seasonal shelters for the rural population from the hinterlands.  \n \nWhile  the  incidence  of  poverty  in  Ulaanbaatar  is  only  34%,  in  the \nproject  towns  it  is  over  50%.  Moreover,  the  formal  areas  in  urban \nsettlements, with their fully networked utilities, stand in sharp contrast to \nthe  informal  ger  (traditional  circular  tent)  settlements  with  minimal \nservices. On average, 46% of the people in the formal areas have \nconnections to water supply, as opposed to very few in the ger areas. \nWaterborne diseases are therefore more prevalent in informal areas, \nand children in the ger areas are twice as likely to have diarrhea and \nrespiratory infections. The high incidence of poverty and poor living \nstandards  in  the  provincial  towns  strongly  suggest  that  poverty \nreduction programs should be targeted at the informal settlements, and \nthat the present imbalance in the provision of urban services should be \nredressed in favor of the informal ger areas. \n \nAccordingly, the Government of Mongolia is seeking to improve the ", "ii   \nquality of life and to protect public health by rehabilitating and extending \nbasic urban services, while strengthening the capacity of local PUSOs \nto  provide  and  operate  these  essential  services.  Following  the \nsuccessful  implementation  of  the  Provincial  Towns  Basic  Urban \nServices Project financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \nfive  provincial  capitals  in  western  Mongolia,  the  Government  is \nendeavoring to expand the project concept to other regions where living \nconditions and service functions are rapidly deteriorating. \n \nObjectives and    The long-term goals of the proposed Project are to (i) support balanced \nScope  and  equitable  regional  development  by  promoting  viable  provincial \n  urban  centers  that  can  provide  support  and  services  for  their  rural \nhinterlands; and (ii) reduce urban poverty and improve living conditions \nfor urban residents in provincial towns. The specific objectives of the \nProject are to (i) improve basic urban services, (ii) reduce inequality in \naccess to urban services between the formal and informal areas, and \n(iii)  strengthen  the  operation  and  management  capacities  of  local \nPUSOs in order to achieve sustainable regional development in the \neight provincial capitals of central and eastern Mongolia. \n \nThe  project  comprises  two  parts:  Part  A,  Urban  Infrastructure  and \nEquipment,  covers  (i)  rehabilitation  of  the  centralized  water  supply \nsystems and improvement of water distribution for residents of  informal \nareas; (ii) improvement and extension of sanitation facilities, including \nsewage treatment works; (iii) refurbishment and replacement of heating \nand hot water supply systems, including boilers and distribution lines; \n(iv) provision of solid waste collection and management equipment; and \n(v) rehabilitation of public bathhouses and provision of new bathhouses \nto serve informal areas. Part B, Project Implementation and Institutional \nDevelopment,  covers  (i)  project  management,  detailed  engineering \ndesign, construction supervision, and implementation support; and (ii) \ninstitutional  capacity  building  programs  for  PUSOs,  including  (a)  a \ncommunity participation and health education program, (b) a water loss \nreduction  program  and  training  in  operation  and  maintenance,  (c) \ntraining in financial management and corporate planning, (d) land use \nplanning and management, and (e) solid waste management planning \nand training. \n \nCost Estimates    The Project will cost about $26.5 million equivalent, $13.3 million of this \n  in foreign exchange costs and $13.2 million equivalent in local currency \ncosts. \n  ($ million equivalent) \n  Foreign  Local  Total  \nComponent  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  Mongolia  for  the  Integrated  Development  of  Basic  Urban  Services  in  Provincial  Towns \nProject. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n2.  In line with its long-term goals for the urban sector of promoting balanced regional \ndevelopment and improving living conditions, the Government of Mongolia has requested the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to assist in the integrated development of urban infrastructure \nand services in eight provincial capitals in the eastern and central regions.1 This Report is based \non the findings of the Fact-Finding Mission, discussions with national and local government \nagencies concerned, and talks with international organizations. The project framework is in \nAppendix 1, and the project processing chronology is in Appendix 2. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n3.  Mongolia  urbanized  rapidly  in  the  second  half  of  the  20th  century,  and  the  trend \naccelerated during the transition from a centrally planned to a market-based economy. The \nurban population2 increased by 20%, to 1.4 million (about 58% of Mongolia\u2019s total population of \n2.4 million), from 1990 to 2000.3 More than half of these live in the capital, Ulaanbaatar, while \n10% live in the three cities of Darhan, Erdenet, and Choir. The remaining 40% live in 18 \nprovincial capitals, or aimag centers, with an average population of 25,000. The 18 provinces \nare further divided into 324 rural districts (soums), and each soum is divided into smaller \nadministrative units called bags. This administrative hierarchy has played an important role in \ngovernment administration as well as in the delivery of basic services to the widely dispersed \nrural population. As the administrative and service centers of the provinces, the 18 provincial \ncapitals serve their own populations as well as the rural hinterlands. \n \n4.  While all provincial capitals serve their respective provinces, some of the capitals have \nimportant regional roles. The meat-packing plants in Sainshand and Choibalsan, which export to \nRussia, serve livestock owners in a wide region covering most of the project provinces. Another \nproject town, Dalandzadgad, is the center of tourism and cashmere production in the southern \nGobi area. Prospects for oil and mineral exploitation are also creating demand for infrastructure \nservices  in  other  provincial  centers.  The  provincial  capitals,  where  most  nonagricultural \nemployment can be found, function as the economic centers of their rural hinterlands, and also \nlink urban industrial processing activities with agricultural and raw material supplies. \n \n5.  However,  infrastructure  for  urban  services  in  the  provincial  capitals  is  seriously \ndilapidated and in urgent need of repair and improvement. In the early 1980s, Mongolia began \ndeveloping basic infrastructure and services in provincial capitals with financial assistance from \nthe former Soviet Union (FSU). When the FSU collapsed, the program stopped; some towns in \nthe eastern and central regions ended up with incompletely installed services. At the end of \n2000, 32% of the urban population had access to potable water, 27% to district heating, and \n37% to waste disposal services. Public bathhouses, largely serving informal ger (traditional \n                                                 \n1  The  towns  are  Baruun-Urt,  Bulgan,  Choibalsan,  Dalandzadgad,  Mandalgobi,  Sainshand,  Tsetserleg,  and \nUndurkhaan, with populations ranging from 13,000 to 39,000. \n2  The Law on the Legal Status of Cities Villages of 1993 defines urban areas based on population size: settlements \nof 15,000 people or more are cities, and settlements of at least 500 but less than 15,000 people are towns.  In this \nProject, the term \u201ctown\u201d is used in the general sense to indicate an urban center.  \n3  National Statistical Office of Mongolia 2001. Population and Housing Census 2000: National Results, Ulaanbaatar.  ", "2   \ncircular tent) areas, have substantially decreased, from 740 in 1990 to about 134 in 2000. This \nimportant basic urban service collapsed as a result of sudden privatization in the early 1990s \nand the subsequent inability of the private sector to operate them on a commercial basis. The \nlack of funds for rehabilitation and periodic maintenance has led to serious deterioration in \nurban services in the provincial capitals and thus to shrinking service coverage in their rural \nhinterlands. Hence, to help improving the productivity of the urban economy and to sustain \nregional service functions, basic urban services such as heating and hot water, water supply \nand  sanitation,  solid  waste  management,  and  bathhouses  in  provincial  capitals  must  be \nimproved and delivered efficiently.  \n \n6.  In the past decade, Ulaanbaatar has attracted most of the foreign investment in urban \ninfrastructure  and  services  as  well  as  urban  migration,4  to  the  detriment  of  the  provincial \ncapitals. Other than ADB\u2019s investment in the provincial capitals of the five western provinces5 \n(para. 11), there has been little, if any, investment in improving urban service delivery in the \nprovincial capitals. The Government\u2019s regional development policy aims to remedy this situation \nby  encouraging  investment  in  the  provincial  capitals,  thereby  correcting  the  imbalance  in \ninvestment between Ulaanbaatar and the provincial centers, while at the same time achieving \nmore balanced regional growth. \n \n7.  A second level of imbalance in urban investment exists within the provincial capitals \nthemselves. Socialist planning led to a separation of formal apartment and institutional areas \nfrom informal ger areas. Formal areas have, to varying degrees, centrally provided heating and \nhot water; water supply and sanitation; solid waste collection; and a full range of educational, \nhealth,  social,  and  commercial  facilities.  On  the  other  hand,  services  are  minimal  in  the \nsupposedly temporary informal ger areas, which hold at least half of the population of the \nprovincial  capitals.  In  ger  areas  water  tanks  supply  neighborhood  water  kiosks;  sanitation \nfacilities take the form of on-plot pit latrines; and coal-, wood-, or dung-fired stoves are used for \nheating  and  cooking.  The  separation  of  the  two  communities  has  contributed  to  the \ndevelopment of towns with extensive unused open space and low densities, making service \ndelivery more costly. In a typical provincial capital, 46% of the residents in formal settlements \nhave connections to water supply versus very few in informal areas. Likewise, households in \ninformal  areas  pay  significantly  more  for  heating,  water,  and  solid  waste  disposal.  Water \nconsumption in the informal areas is low, typically 6\u201312 liters per capita per day, because the \nwater costs up to 20 times as much as that supplied to apartment residents. Hence, in all \nprovincial capitals, informal area residents tend to subsidize the price of water for apartment \ndwellers. \n \n8.  According  to  the  1998  Living  Standards  Measurement  Survey,6  some  36%  of  the \nnational population is poor, living below the weighted national poverty line of $17 per person per \nmonth.7 The population of Ulaanbaatar is marginally poorer (34% fall below the poverty line) \nthan the rural population (32% below the poverty line). However, those living in provincial \ncenters are the poorest, with 45% below the poverty line.8 At the same time, the average \nmonthly income of households living in ger areas is less than 70% of that of households living in \napartment areas. The critical poverty and livelihood prospects of the provincial capitals indicate \n                                                 \n4  During the last decade, the urban population has grown on average at 3.3% per year with the 1.3% per year \ngrowth rate in rural areas, although Ulaanbaatar has grown most rapidly of all. \n5  ADB. 1997.

Targeting provincial capitals for assistance is consistent with the \nPoverty Reduction Strategy for ADB operations in Mongolia.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n9.  An analysis of urban sector problems and constraints is presented in Appendix 3.9 A key \nconstraint on the provincial capitals is the lack of a long-term financing mechanism for capital \ninvestment  and  sustainable  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M).  Since  the  withdrawal  of \nsubsidies from the FSU, the sector has not attracted enough funds to stop the deterioration of \ninfrastructure  and  urban  services.  Low  capacity  constrains  private  sector  participation  and \nimproved service delivery through public-private partnerships. \n \n10.  In addition, local public service organizations, for lack of financial and managerial skills \nsuited to the new economic situation, have not been able to optimize the provision of urban \nservices. The institutional structure,10 which is dominated by the provincial governments, has \nworsened the situation. The incomes of the public utility companies have been effectively \ncontrolled by the provincial governors, but it is not clearly defined what kinds of financial \noversight or responsibilities of the utilities are exercised by the local government. In 1997, the \nGovernment  initiated  the  establishment  of  public  urban  services  organizations  (PUSOs)  to \nprovide  water  and  sewerage,  and,  in  many  cases,  apartment  maintenance,  solid  waste \ncollection, and public bathhouses under one organization for delivery efficiency. However, in \nmost provincial capitals, the PUSOs still operate as departments of the provincial governments, \nreporting principally to the provincial governor, and are thus limited in delivering urban services \nefficiently based on commercial principles. \n \n11.  To address these concerns, ADB in 1997 approved the Provincial Towns Basic Urban \nServices  (PTBUS)  Project  (footnote  5),  the  implementation  of  which  in  the  five  western \nprovincial capitals11 has given clear direction to urban management policy and coherence in \ninstitutional, technical, and financial conditions. Notably, in contrast to the other 13 provincial \ncapitals, where population has decreased, the five western provincial capitals have added to \ntheir  population  over  the  implementation  period.  Their  PUSOs  have  also  acquired  critical \nknowledge and management skills. To make the other PUSOs more independent and financially \nsustainable,  the  Government  is  striving  to  introduce  market-based  management  in  their \nprovincial capitals. At the same time, the Government learned from the PTBUS Project that it \nwould  be  more  efficient  to  include  district  heating  as  one  of  the  PUSO\u2019s  service  delivery \ncomponents, and tariff adjustments should be enforced within consumers\u2019 affordability and \nbased on cost-recovery principles.  \n \n12.  The positive experience as well as the lessons learned from the PTBUS Project are \nrecognized  in  the  Government\u2019s  Action  Program  for  2000\u20132004,  which  was  approved  by  \nParliament in 2001. The Program calls for (i) replicating the principles of the PTBUS Project in \nother  provincial  capitals;  (ii)  improving  living  standards  and  urban  service  productivity  and \nefficiency; (iii) improving financial resource mobilization, particularly by expanding cost-recovery \nand cost-sharing mechanisms including tariff adjustments; and (iv) improving urban service \noperation and management. In an important shift in urban development policy, the Program also \nsituates  itself  in  a  regional  economic  development  context  by  identifying  five  economic \n                                                 \n9  Detailed sector analysis is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n10  Institutional analysis, including the capacity of public urban services organization, is discussed in Supplementary \nAppendix E. \n11  Hovd, Moron, Olgiy, Ulaangom, and Uliastay. \n ", "4   \ndevelopment regions\u2014western, northern, capital, central, and eastern. The proposed Project is \ndesigned to assist the Government in implementing the Action Program, and to strengthen the \neconomic and service functions of the provincial capitals in the eastern and central regions that \nlie in the main transportation corridor, connecting the Russian Federation and the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. \n \n13.  To improve national economic integration, Parliament in 2001 passed the Regional \nDevelopment Policy, which provides a conceptual framework for space planning and balanced \nregional  development  through  coherent  investment  in  infrastructure  and  systematic \ndevelopment  of  urban  economic  centers  outside  Ulaanbaatar.  In  an  effort  to  increase \nagricultural  production  and  to  sustain  the  dispersed  distribution  of  the  population,  the \nGovernment  is  encouraging  people  to  remain  in  the  provinces  instead  of  migrating  to \nUlaanbaatar.  However,  multinational  development  agencies  have  not  yet  systematically \nsupported  implementation  of  the  policy.  The  activities  of  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme target small settlements in Mongolia\u2019s rural areas. The World Bank has focused on \nimproving access to water supply and sanitation in ger areas of Ulaanbaatar. The Japan Bank \nfor International Cooperation has provided assistance to improve water supply and sanitation in \nUlaanbaatar,  Gobialtay,  and  Mandalgobi;  and  to  rehabilitate  power  plants  in  rural  district \ncenters.  (External  assistance  to  the  sector  is  summarized  in  Appendix  4.)  Thus,  targeting \nprovincial capitals for assistance not only fills a gap in international investment but is also \nconsistent with the Government\u2019s Action Program and Regional Development Policy.  \n \n14.  The proposed Project has been developed in close consultation with the development \ncommunity.  ADB\u2019s  strategic  emphasis  on  provincial  towns  is  fully  recognized  by  the \nGovernment, and policy dialogue on the design and the implementation of the Action Program \nhas been initiated with the Government. The policy dialogue also covers (i) integrating basic \nurban services under a local PUSO for efficient service delivery; (ii) corporatizing PUSOs as \nstate-owned limited liability companies to operate according to principles of good corporate \ngovernance and to be businesslike entities; (iii) promoting public-private partnerships through \nforms of joint shareholding and management contracts for service delivery;12 (iv) strengthening \nthe  financial  management  capacity  of  PUSOs  for  decentralized  basic  service  delivery;  (v) \navoiding increases in real tariffs for the poor living in informal ger areas; and (vi) promoting full \ncost recovery, including debt service and O&M costs, through an integrated approach. A plan \nfor  the urban sector is in Appendix 5, and the Policy Action Plan is in Appendix 6. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Objectives, Rationale, and Area \n \n15.  The long-term goals of the Project are to (i) support balanced and equitable regional \ndevelopment by promoting viable provincial urban centers that can provide support and services \nfor their rural hinterlands, and (ii) reduce urban poverty and improve living conditions for urban \nresidents in provincial towns. The Project is classified as a core poverty intervention: at least \n52% of the beneficiaries are poor,13 and the Project will directly help reduce poverty by giving \nthe poor better access to improved basic urban services. About 88,000 people in informal ger \nareas are expected to benefit directly from the rehabilitation and extension of urban services. \nThe specific objectives of the Project are to (i) improve basic urban infrastructure and services \n                                                 \n12  Government Resolution No. 159 of October 1999 sets out the program for the privatization of the management of \nthe PUSOs, and State Property Committee Resolution No.123 of March 2001 provides guidelines on a renewable \n3-year management contract system. The Government encourages private sector participation in the management \nof urban service delivery.  \n13 Based on household surveys conducted in the project towns. ", "  5\nin provincial towns through integrated development, (ii) reduce inequality in access to urban \nservices between residents of formal and informal areas, and (iii) strengthen the operation and \nmanagement capacities of the local PUSOs in order to achieve sustainable urban and regional \ndevelopment.  \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s intervention is based on the necessity to promote effective regional development \nby integrating physical and economic development strategies, to reduce poverty by improving \nliving standards, and to improve the sustainability of investments in urban services. The Project \nwill take an approach that conforms to ADB\u2019s Urban Sector Strategy as well as the Poverty \nReduction Strategy for ADB Operations in Mongolia (2000\u20132005). \n \n17.  At  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  fact-finding  stage,  the  Government \nsuggested investigating the inclusion of 12 provincial capitals focusing on the eastern and \ncentral regions (the six western provincial capitals, five of which were covered under the PTBUS \nProject, were excluded). The list was pared down to eight towns on the basis of several criteria, \nincluding the provincial governments\u2019 willingness to borrow, economic growth potentials, and \nregional  and  provincial  centers  designated  by  the  Regional  Development  Policy.  The \nGovernment\u2019s borrowing capacity also influenced the number of towns selected. The eight \ntowns are located within the eastern and central economic development zones, connecting the  \nRussian Federation and the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n  \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n18.  The Project comprises two parts. Part A, Urban Infrastructure and Equipment, covers (i) \nrehabilitation of the centralized water supply systems and improvement of water distribution for \nthe residents of informal areas; (ii) improvement and extension of sanitation facilities, including \nsewage treatment works; (iii) refurbishment and replacement of heating and hot water supply \nsystems, including boilers and distribution lines; (iv) provision of solid waste collection and \nmanagement equipment; and (v) rehabilitation of public bathhouses and the provision of new \nbathhouses  to  serve  informal  areas.  Part  B,  Project  Implementation  and  Institutional \nDevelopment,  covers  (i)  project  management,  detailed  engineering  design,  construction \nsupervision, and implementation support; and (ii) institutional capacity-building programs for \nPUSOs, including (a) a community participation and health education program, (b) a water loss \nreduction program and training in O&M, (c) training in financial management and corporate \nplanning for PUSOs, (d) land use planning and management, and (e) solid waste management \nplanning and training.  \n \n1.  Part A: Urban Infrastructure and Equipment \n \n19.  The  urban  infrastructure  and  equipment  investment  components  for  each  town  are \nsummarized  in  Appendix  7.  Infrastructure  improvements,  by  subsector,  are  summarized  in \nparas. 20-24. \n \na.  Water Supply \n \n20.  For all towns, the Project will finance (i) rehabilitation of the centralized water supply \nsystems,  including  refurbishment  of  pumps,  repair  and  replacement  of  broken  pipes,  and \nsystem expansion to improve system efficiency; and (ii) a comprehensive program for water \nloss and leakage reduction, including metering. Subsector improvements include (i) pipes and \nmaterial for reducing leakage in the distribution network; (ii) new control panels, switch gear, \ncabling, and electrical surge protection for pump houses; (iii) bulk meters for source wells and \npumping  stations,  and  pressure  gauges;  (iv)  meters  for  apartment  blocks,  commercial \n ", "6   \nestablishments, and major public buildings to reduce nonrevenue water; (v) replacements for \nplumbing fixtures in apartments and public buildings to reduce unaccounted-for-water; and (vi) \nlaboratory  equipment  for  water  quality  testing.  The  Project  will  also  improve  water  supply \ndelivery, accessibility, and affordability for the residents of the informal ger areas by increasing \nthe number and location of water distribution points, integrating most of these in the central \ndistribution system, and converting them to 24-hour self-service facilities. The improvements in \nthe centralized distribution system will also benefit informal area residents, as more water for \ndistribution will be directly available in the system at lower cost to users. In addition, individual \nplot connections will be made possible in selected informal areas through the installation of \ntertiary networks along the roads and footpaths.14  \n \nb.  Sanitation \n \n21.  All project towns currently have a centralized sewage treatment plant but, except for \nthose  in  Bulgan  and  Mandalgobi,  the  plants  are  dilapidated  and  the  equipment  does  not \nfunction. The Project will replace the dilapidated plants with sewage lagoons. Project work in \nthis regard will include (i) construction of new lagoon treatment systems and provision of pumps, \n(ii) rehabilitation of pumping stations with new pumps and fittings, (iii) repair of defects and \nupgrading of the pipe network, and (iv) provision of individual connections to selected informal \nsettlements. Since most informal area households use dry pit latrines, the health education \ncampaign, to be implemented under the institutional development component of the Project, will \ncover best-practice construction and operation of pit latrines. \n \nc.  Heating and Hot Water \n \n22.  The  Project  will  provide  for  the  extensive  upgrading  of  heating  plants  and  the \nrehabilitation of the hot water supply network serving buildings, except in Dalandzadgad.15 The \nproposed replacement of 37 boilers and the installation of 68 new heat exchangers will improve \nheat transmission efficiencies. Improvements will include (i) refurbishment and replacement of \nboilers and heating lines, (ii) installation of hotwater heat exchangers in buildings to allow \nhotwater  connections,  and  (iii)  network  extensions  to  provide  for  individual  plot  heating \nconnections. Wherever possible, small systems will be aggregated to increase economies of \nscale and to reduce emissions. \n \nd.  Solid Waste Management \n \n23.  It has been a common practice in all towns to dump wastes a few kilometers outside of \nthe town premises without any control. Often these uncontrolled dump sites stretch over 3 \nkilometers.  To  reduce  casual  disposal  and  promote  efficient  management  of  solid  waste \ndisposal, the Project will (i) consolidate and fence sanitary landfill sites in four of the eight towns, \n(ii) provide new landfill management equipment, (iii) provide solid waste collection trucks and \ncommunal steel disposal bins, and (iv) prepare a comprehensive solid waste management plan \nfor  each  town  to  achieve  more  intensive  use  of  equipment  and  cost-efficient  routing  and \nscheduling.  \n \n                                                 \n14 The exact combination of ger area water improvements for each town will be determined at the detailed \nengineering design stage. It is expected that 80% of the ger area residents will be within 200 meters of a water \ndistribution point. \n15  District heating in Dalandzadgad is provided by a state-owned electric power plant. Since the plant is owned and \noperated by the Energy Authority of Mongolia, not by the local PUSO, Dalandzadgad will be excluded from the \nheating component. ", "  7\ne.  Bathhouses \n \n24.  Only one public bathhouse still operates in most of the towns, and they are old and \ndilapidated. Due to the high cost of fuel for heating water during the 6 months of winter, these \npublic bathhouses require subsidies from the provincial government or PUSO in order to meet \noperating costs. The Project will aim to (i) rehabilitate public bathhouses by introducing more \nefficient designs and heating technologies; replacing boilers, pumps, external pipe work, steam \nducts, heat exchangers, electrical switch gear, internal pipe work, shower fittings, and taps; and \nundertaking general building refurbishment; and (ii) provide at least one additional bathhouse in \nor  near  the  informal  areas,  connected  with  the  water,  hot  water,  heating,  and  sewerage \nnetworks. Community management of bathhouses, including the spaces for complementary \nservices, will be encouraged. \n \n2.  Part B: Project Implementation and Institutional Development \n \na.  Project Implementation \n \n25.  Project implementation includes (i) project management and implementation support, \ndetailed engineering design, procurement, disbursement, construction supervision, budgeting, \nreporting,  overall  project  performance  monitoring,  coordination  with  relevant  government \nagencies  and  ADB,  and  resolution  of  issues;  (ii)  technical,  economic,  financial,  legal,  and \nmanagement advice; (iii) on-the-job training to improve the disbursement and procurement skills \nof project management office (PMO) staff; and (iv) equipment to support the PMO.  \n \nb.  Institutional Development \n \n26.  The PUSOs of the project towns are the principal target of institutional development, \nsince they bear the primary responsibility for basic urban service delivery. This component \nincludes  consultant  support  for,  training  of  PUSO  staff  in,  and  beneficiary  involvement  as \nrequired in the following: (i) a community participation and health education program, (ii) training \nin water loss reduction and O&M, (iii) financial management strengthening of PUSOs, (iv) land \nuse planning and management, (v) assistance in solid waste management planning, and (vi) \ncomputer  equipment  to  support  the  project  implementation  units  (PIUs).  The  institutional \ndevelopment program is summarized in Appendix 8. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n27.  The proposed Project responds to the priority areas of urban sector policy, institutional \ndevelopment, and cost recovery issues. The Project is designed to promote good governance \nand private sector participation through public administration reform and institutional capacity \nbuilding for improved service delivery. This will eventually strengthen public-private partnerships \nin capital investment, as well as efficient service delivery and management in a market-based \neconomy. \n \n1.  Appropriate Technologies \n \n28.  The Project will follow a least-cost approach to providing the required interventions and \nimprovements in basic urban services. Existing systems will be rehabilitated, instead of new \nones being built, to keep the costs low so that tariffs remain affordable to end users. The use of \nlocal materials and labor-intensive approaches was given priority in choosing among alternative \noptions.  Water  supply  rehabilitation  will  help  provide  more  reliable  service  and  produce \nquantitative as well as qualitative improvements in hygiene and health. In particular, extending \n ", "8   \nwater distribution lines to ger areas will reduce the time spent hauling water and will increase \nwater consumption by low-income households. Given the cold weather, the construction of \noxidation ponds in place of the dilapidated sewage plants has been adopted as a cost-effective \nand appropriate technology. The district heating and hot water supply components will largely \nreplace dilapidated old pumps and outdated hotwater heat exchangers. The Project will also \nprovide for the development of proper landfill planning and management skills, using locally \navailable, low-cost materials and approaches. Overall, the Project will promote investments that \nare cost-effective and simple to operate and maintain in the context of technologies suitable for \nthe harsh winters in the country. \n \n2.  Corporatization of PUSOs \n \n29.  The  Project,  through  the  proposed  institutional  development  program,  will  help  the \nPUSOs become state-owned limited liability companies, in conformity with Mongolia\u2019s 1999 \nCompany Law. The PUSOs are responsible for water supply, sewerage systems, apartment \nmaintenance,  public  baths,  district  heating  and  hot  water  supply,  and  in  some  cases  the \nmanagement of state-owned hotels. It has been agreed with the Government that the PUSOs in \nthe project towns will be organized to develop, provide, and operate services in the following \nsubsectors: water for both ger areas and apartments, sewerage, public baths, solid waste \nmanagement, and district heating and hot water. The corporatization of the PUSOs through \nformal articles of association will provide legal definition for their services and integrate the five \nbasic urban services subsectors. The five PUSOs in the western provincial centers covered by \nthe PTBUS Project were corporatized in 1999, and the Government, through the Ministry of \nInfrastructure (MOI), is committed to extending this organizational structure to the PUSOs in the \neastern and central regions. \n \n3.  Good Governance and Management Capacity Building \n \n30.  The Project also aims to improve the management capability of PUSOs to plan, finance, \nand  manage  basic  services  and  to  implement  infrastructure  development  projects  in  a \nsustainable manner, both during and after the Project. Local government officials are technically \ncompetent in many areas but are hampered by (i) decades of working within the hierarchical \nstructures of a command and controlled economy, and (ii) limited management capacity and \nfinancial  autonomy  from  their  provincial  governments.  Staff  must  be  trained  in  financial \nmanagement and updated corporate planning. The corporatization of the PUSOs, as state-\nowned enterprises, requires that they establish performance agreements with their provincial \ngovernments  and  operate  according  to  the  principles  of  good  corporate  governance  and \ncommercial practice. To achieve the project objectives, the PUSOs, through the institutional \ndevelopment  program,  will  be  assisted  in  forming  new  relationships  with  their  provincial \nadministrations  that  will  give  them  more  effective  autonomy,  while  recognizing  their \nresponsibilities as providers of basic urban services.  \n \n4.  Public-Private Partnerships \n \n31.  The Government is promoting public-private partnerships through joint shareholding and \nmanagement contracts for service delivery. The Project will encourage the private sector to \noperate the systems built by local governments. The Government is also planning to contract \nout  the  management  of  PUSO  services  to  the  private  sector.  Under  the  institutional \ndevelopment  program,  participating  PUSOs  will  be  assisted  in  improving  their  corporate \ngovernance and financial management skills to attract private sector participation in service \ndelivery. Consulting services will be provided in financial, legal, and contractual matters. \n ", "  9\n5.  Land Use Planning and Management \n \n32.  In all the project towns, urban densities should be increased to make better use of \ninfrastructure and to promote the efficiency of urban development and land markets. Among the \nproposed interventions is the development by each town of proper urban infrastructure and \nservices on vacant land owned by the local government and the auction of use rights to the \nhighest bidders. Through the Project, staffs of participating PUSOs will be assisted in preparing \nland use plans and will be trained in management skills. The proposed component will promote \nprivate sector participation based on market economy principles. \n  \n6.  Cost Recovery and Subsidy \n \n33.  An important objective of the Project is to assist the PUSOs in generating more revenue \nfrom  their  own  sources  and  to  ensure  that  administration,  O&M,  and  capital  costs  are \nadequately covered. Tariffs will be increased so that PUSOs can meet their full cost recovery, \ntaking into account O&M, capital investment costs and debt service obligations. At the same \ntime, the proposed tariff increase will always be below the generally accepted rule of household \naffordability, less than 6% of monthly income for water and sanitation, for example. To enhance \nthe poverty impact of the Project and reverse the regressive subsidies to apartment dwellers, \ntariff  cross-subsidies  have  been  targeted  to  informal  ger  areas,  where  the  percentage  of \nhouseholds below the poverty line is higher than average. For families in these areas, tariffs for \nwater, sanitation, solid waste collection, and bathhouses will not increase until 2006 and have \nbeen kept constant in 2002 prices. The targeted internal cross-subsidies will enhance health \nand  personal  hygiene  among  poor  households  through  increased  access  to  water.  Funds \nrequired to subsidize water, solid waste, and bathhouse services in informal areas will come \nprimarily  from  heating,  hot  water,  and  water  supply  charges  levied  on  organizations  and \napartment dwellers in the project towns. According to PUSO financial projections and evaluation \n(Appendix 9), sufficient surpluses will be generated to cover the subsidies.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n34.  The Project will cost about $26.5 million equivalent\u2014$13.3 million in foreign exchange \ncosts and $13.2 million equivalent in local currency costs. The cost estimates are summarized \nin Table 1. Further details of the base cost estimates, by town, are in Appendix 10. \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n \n35.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of SDR 15.515 million ($20.1 million equivalent) \nfrom its Special Funds resources, representing 76% of the total project cost. The Loan will \nfinance the entire foreign exchange cost of $13.3 million and $6.8 million equivalent of the local \ncurrency  cost.  The  PUSOs  will  contribute  the  equivalent  of  $2.8  million  for  incremental \nadministration costs and interest during construction in the towns. The Government will meet \nthe remaining project cost of $3.6 million equivalent to cover the taxes levied on all domestic \ntransactions, import duties, and administrative support and counterpart staff. The ADB Loan will \nbe repayable over 32 years with a grace period of 8 years and an interest charge of 1.0% per \nyear during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter.

Part of the proceeds of the Loan will be re-lent to the provincial governments under \nsubsidiary loan agreements (SLAs), commensurate with the infrastructure component in each \ntown. The PUSOs in the various towns will enter into onlending agreements (OLAs) with their \nprovincial governments to implement the physical aspects of the Project (Part A). The SLAs and \nsubsequent OLAs will carry an interest rate of 1.5%, plus a 3.0% charge by the Ministry of \nFinance and Economy (MOFE) to cover the foreign exchange rate risk and administration costs. \nThe subloans to the provincial governments and the PUSOs will have a term of 22 years, \nincluding a 4-year grace period during which only interest payments will be required. This term \nis broadly consistent with the average economic life of the assets to be implemented through \nthe Project. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk from the 3% charge.  \n   ", "  11\nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n37.  The  Executing  Agency  will  be  MOI.  The  Government  Implementing  Agency  for \nConstruction, Urban Development and Public Utilities (GIACUDPU), under MOI will implement \nthe Project.16 The PMO has been established within GIACUDPU and headed by a full-time \nproject director and staffed with persons having expertise in financial accounting, procurement, \nconstruction  supervision,  and  other  areas  as  appropriate.  In  each  town,  a  PIU  will  be \nestablished in the PUSO; its membership will comprise the PUSO director, the chief engineer, \nand the chief accountant. The PIUs will coordinate closely with the PMO, participate in each \nstage of project implementation, and advise on subproject design. A project steering committee \n(PSC)\u2014composed of senior officials from MOI, MOFE, and GIACUDPU and the governors of \nthe project aimags\u2014has been formed for high-level policy guidance and coordination. The PSC \nis chaired by the Vice Minister of MOI and will meet as required, but at least twice a year. To \nenhance ownership at the local level and participation by local communities, town consultative \ncommittees  (TCCs),  including  the  PUSO  director  as  chairperson,  the  speaker  of  the  local \nparliament, the head of the National Federation of Women, and a staff member of a local \npoverty alleviation program office, will be formed. The TCC will keep the public informed about \nproject activities and make the public's views known to the PUSO. Its role is to increase the \ncommercial orientation of the PUSO and its independence from the provincial governor\u2019s office. \nThe TCCs will meet quarterly, in advance of the PSC meetings.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n38.  Because  of  extreme  weather  conditions  during  the  winter  months,  the  construction \nseason  in  the  project  towns  ranges  from  5  to  7  months.  The  Project  is  expected  to  be \nimplemented over 5 years, with preparatory activities starting in July 2002, detailed design in \nOctober 2002, procurement and contract awards in 2003, and construction occurring mostly \nfrom  2004  to  2007.  The  Project  is  expected  to  begin  in  January  2003.  The  project \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 11. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n39.  Procurement of ADB-financed goods and services will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The  procurement  will  be  in  line  with  the  project \nimplementation  monitoring  system  and  Mongolia\u2019s  Public  Procurement  Law,  which  were \nprepared  with  ADB  assistance.17  Equipment  will  be  procured  by  international  competitive \nbidding for contracts above $500,000 equivalent, international shopping for contracts above \n$100,000 equivalent and up to $500,000 equivalent, and direct purchase for contracts with a \nvalue of $100,000 equivalent or less. Civil works with a value of $1,000,000 equivalent or less \nwill be carried out under local competitive bidding (LCB) and, for the installation of meters and \nplumbing fixtures, under PUSO force account. In accordance with ADB\u2019s procedures, eligible \nforeign contractors may bid for LCB contracts. MOI will provide drafts of the procurement \ncontracts  to  MOFE  for  review  before  the  contracts  are  finalized  and  signed.  Indicative \nprocurement packages are included in Appendix 12. \n \n                                                 \n16 The  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  as  well  as  the  implementation  arrangements,  are  discussed  in   \nSupplementary Appendix E. \n17  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for the Establishment of a Central Procurement Monitoring Office. \nManila; and ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for the Development of Procurement Legislation and \nGuidelines. Manila. \n ", "12  \n4.  Land Acquisition \n \n40.  In Mongolia, land is owned by the Government. No new land will be required for the \nProject, as existing landfills and old dilapidated sewage treatment facilities will be rehabilitated \nand improved. No residents will be displaced as a result of project activities. \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n \n41.  A total of 271 person-months of consulting services (35 international and 236 domestic) \nwill  be  needed.  The  international  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  (i)  water  supply  and \nsanitation engineering, (ii) heating and hot water engineering, (iii) mechanical and electrical \nengineering, (iv) contracting and procurement, (v) urban planning and land management, (vi) \nfinancial  management  and  accounting,  and  (vii)  management  information  systems  and \nmonitoring and evaluation. The domestic consultants will have similar expertise, as well as \nexpertise  in  geotechnical  engineering,  regional  civil  works  coordination,  solid  waste/ \nenvironmental management, water loss reduction/O&M, and community participation and public \nhealth.  \n \n42.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  under  the  Project  to  (i)  assist  in  project \nimplementation by strengthening the PMO and PIUs, (ii) design and supervise the construction \nof infrastructure, and (iii) support institutional development in the eight towns. The project \nmanagement and design and supervision services will be combined under a contract with a \ndomestic firm, while the institutional development support will be provided through another \ncontract with a domestic firm. All international consultant services will be individually contracted. \nThe consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants18 and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement \nof domestic consultants. MOI will provide MOFE with drafts of the consulting contracts for \nreview before contract signing. Outline terms of reference for consultants are given in Appendix \n13.  \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n43.  An imprest account will be established in a commercial bank acceptable to ADB to \nspeed up the disbursement of the loan proceeds. The Government may withdraw from the \nimprest account to pay the PMO and the PUSOs through SLAs for eligible project expenses \nrelated to equipment used by the PMO and PIUs, training and seminars, force account work, \nand civil works contracts under LCB. The imprest account will be established in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook of January 2001 and detailed arrangements between the \nGovernment and ADB. The initial deposit in the imprest account will not exceed $500,000. \nADB\u2019s statement of expenditures (SOE) procedures will be followed in liquidating the imprest \naccount and reimbursing individual SOE payments up to $50,000 equivalent. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n44.  MOI has built up substantial strength in project administration and in accounting through \nthe  PTBUS  Project.  Further  necessary  support  has  been  included  under  the  project \nimplementation component to improve the financial management skills of PMO staff. The PMO \nand  the  PIUs  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts.  The  PIUs  will  keep  records  of  all \n                                                 \n18  Effective 1 April 2002, the selection of consultants under ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants includes the \nuse of the quality and cost-based selection method. This method involves the simultaneous submission of technical \nand financial proposals and the use of price as an evaluation criterion. ", "  13\nsubproject  expenditures  and  forward  these  every  quarter  to  the  PMO  for  consolidation. \nIndependent auditors acceptable to ADB will audit the consolidated project accounts every year. \nCertified copies of the audited accounts in English will be submitted to ADB not later than nine \nmonths after the end of the financial year to which they relate. The independent auditors will \nalso provide a separate audit report on the imprest account and the SOE. If the audited project \naccount is not received within 6 months after the due date, ADB may stop replenishing the \nimprest account and processing reimbursement requests, commitment letters, and contract \nawards. If the audited project account is not received within 12 months after the due date, ADB \nmay suspend the Loan. The PMO will submit to ADB reports and information concerning the \nuse of the loan proceeds, the Project, and administration and financial information on the \nPUSOs.  The  reports  will  include  (i)  monthly  progress  briefing  notes  summarizing  project \nactivities, progress, disbursements procurement issues, and planned activities; (ii) semiannual \nprogress reports on project implementation; and (iii) a project completion report, within 3 months \nof the physical completion of the Project.  \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n45.  The Government will ensure that a comprehensive program for project performance \nmonitoring and evaluation (PPME) acceptable to ADB is carried out to (i) examine the Project\u2019s \ntechnical  performance;  (ii)  evaluate  the  delivery  of  the  planned  facilities;  (iii)  assess  the \nachievement of the Project\u2019s objectives; and (iv) measure the Project\u2019s social and economic \nbenefits.  A  set  of  PPME  indicators  will  be  developed  at  the  start  of  the  Project  by  the \nconsultants and staff of the PMO and PIUs in consultation with the local communities. PPME \nwill be integrated into the management information system of the PUSOs, to be developed \nunder the institutional development program, so that the monitoring of social and economic \nbenefits can continue beyond project implementation. Annual PPME reports will be prepared by \neach PIU, then consolidated by the PMO and submitted to ADB, with a copy to MOFE. The \nintegrated system for the management, monitoring, and evaluation of project benefits, social \nimpact, and physical improvements will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines for the Project \nPerformance Management System. \n \n9.  Project Review \n \n46.  Besides the regular reviews, ADB and the Government will undertake a comprehensive \nreview at the end of the first year when detailed design is completed. A midterm review will also \nbe undertaken within 30 months from loan effectiveness. These reviews will include a detailed \nevaluation of the project scope, implementation arrangements, and achievement of scheduled \ntargets. They will also cover the status of subproject progress and implementation, performance \nof  consultants,  institutional  development  components,  and  possible  reallocation  of  loan \nproceeds.  The  PMO,  with  the  environmental  consultant\u2019s  support,  will  prepare  an  annual \nenvironmental monitoring report and submit it for ADB\u2019s review. \n \n10.  Advance Action and Retroactive Financing \n \n47.  Because of the severe and long winters, construction work on the Project can be carried \nout only during the summer (April\u2013October). Delivering construction materials and procured \nequipment  to  eight  project  towns  also  complicates  project  logistics.  To  facilitate  physical \nimplementation, predesign activities must begin in 2002. Therefore ADB approved advance \naction for the recruitment of consulting services for detailed engineering design. \n \n48.  ADB also approved retroactive financing ($150,000, or less than 1% of the ADB loan \namount) with respect to the advance payment for mobilizing the consultants. The Government \n ", "14  \nhas been advised that the approval of advance action and retroactive financing does not commit \nADB to finance the Project. \n \nIV.  NONLENDING ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n \n49.  The  Japanese  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  project,  Improving  the  Living \nEnvironment of the Poor in Ger Areas of Mongolia\u2019s Cities,19 is closely linked to the proposed \nProject. It will pilot innovative and sustainable approaches to addressing asset-related poverty in \nselected ger areas of cities in Mongolia. To improve the living conditions of the poor the JFPR \nproject will (i) pilot sustainable opportunities for housing finance for the poor, (ii) demonstrate \nand promote environment-friendly low-cost housing technologies, and (iii) show viable and \nsustainable ways of operating public bathhouses. \n \n50.  The  JFPR  project  will  target  the  poor  and  low-income  groups  in  selected  ger \ncommunities in three cities20 covered by the Housing Finance (Sector) Project,21 and in the eight \ntowns  under  the  proposed  Project.  The  JFPR  project  comprises  the  following:  (i)  housing \nmicrofinance for the poor, (ii) low-cost demonstration houses, (iii) viable public bathhouses, (iv) \nincome-earning  opportunities  through  briquette  making  and  greenhouses,  and  (v)  project \nmanagement  and  poverty  impact  assessment.  While  the  housing  finance  and  housing \ndemonstration components will be implemented initially only in Ulaanbaatar, the bathhouse, \nbriquette making, and greenhouse components will be implemented in the Project\u2019s eight towns. \nTwo bathhouses will be built in selected ger areas in each of the eight project towns. \n \nB.  Public Bathhouses \n \n51.  The  JFPR  project  will  pilot  a  new  approach  to  operating  public  bathhouses  on  a \nsustainable  basis.  Since  the  major  reason  for  the  inefficiency  of  bathhouses  is  their  high \noperating costs, which are largely related to the cost of heating fuel, the JFPR project will (i) use \nrenewable  solar-powered  heating  systems  for  hot  water  supply;  (ii)  finance  insulation  of \nbathhouses; (iii) promote the use of energy-efficient boilers; (iv) finance bathhouses that save \noperating costs by following new designs (smaller rooms, lower ceilings, shower facilities placed \nat the center, etc.); (v) select bathhouses to be integrated into the apartment service system to \nmake  water,  heating,  and  sewage  connections  available;  (vi)  generate  more  revenue  by \nextending bathhouse services to include other services such as laundries, small workshops, and \nsmall shops; and (vii) introduce social pricing based on a social service card registration system, \nwhich will ensure both poverty targeting and higher revenue generation.  \n \nC.  Social Pricing System \n \n52.  An innovative aspect of the JFPR project, which could be applied to components of the \nproposed Project, is a social pricing system based on the various categories of monthly income \nof poor households residing in the selected ger areas: (i) very poor: up to MNT50,000; (ii) poor: \nover  MNT50,000  and  up  to  MNT150,000;  (iii)  low  income:  over  MNT150,000  and  up  to \nMNT250,000; and (iv) nonpoor: more than MNT250,000. Each selected ger area community \nwould distribute social services registration cards among the various categories of poor families. \n                                                 \n19  The JFPR Project (grant of $2.2 million) was approved by the Government of Japan on 21 December 2001, and \nwas approved by ADB\u2019s Board on 7 May 2002.  \n20 Ulaanbaatar, Darhan, and Dzuunmod. \n21 ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to \nMongolia for the Housing Finance (Sector) Project. Manila.  ", "  15\nTo  ensure  fair  distribution,  the  local  poverty  alleviation  program  office  under  each  local \ngovernment would check the distribution against its records of poor families. On the basis of \ntheir social services card, poor families would pay different bathhouse tariffs: MNT200 per use \nfor the very poor, MNT500 for poor and low-income families, and full price (MNT800) for the \nnonpoor. PUSOs and provincial governments could adopt social pricing using social services \nregistration cards for other services for the very poor in ger areas such as water supply and \nsolid waste collection.22 \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACT, AND RISKS \n \nA.   Social and Environmental Aspects \n \n53.  The Project is expected to have a high level of community involvement in design and \nimplementation, and a positive social impact. The improvement in living conditions resulting \nfrom the upgrading of basic urban infrastructure and services will contribute materially to social \nwell-being.  In  addition  to  facilitating  economic  development  in  the  project  towns  through \nremedial investment in local infrastructure and services, the Project will significantly reduce \npoverty in the 8 towns. Some 148,000 residents of the project towns (of whom 88,000 are in \ninformal areas)\u201411% of the urban population of Mongolia\u2014are expected to benefit directly or \nindirectly from the Project. Rural populations are also expected to capture the benefits of \nimproved heating in schools, hospitals, dormitories, and public bathhouses during the winter \nmonths when they shelter in the project towns. The residents of the informal areas in particular, \nwhere the concentration of poverty is at its highest in Mongolia, will benefit from improved \naccess to water and bathing facilities, increased consumption of water with low tariff, and more \nefficient solid waste management. Children from these areas, who now collect most of the \nwater, will be among the beneficiaries. Women, who in general are more likely to be poor, will \ndirectly benefit through a gender-inclusive project design that will support their participation in \nthe Project through (i) the community participation program; (ii) opportunities for entrepreneurial \nactivities, such as the provision of bathhouse services in the ger areas; and (iii) labor-intensive \naspects  of  project  implementation.  Additional  benefits  in  personal  and  household  hygiene \nthrough improved services and an accompanying health education component will positively \naffect the health of women and families. \n \n54.  Improvements in heating, hot water, water supply, and sanitation systems will also \nbenefit the residents of apartments and public and private organizations through more reliable \nsupply  and  lower  operating  and  maintenance  costs.  Improvements  and  extensions  to  the \nheating systems, which have substantially deteriorated in the past decade, will provide heat and \nhot water to school dormitories, nurseries, kindergartens, hospitals, offices, and apartments. \nMore efficient solid waste collection and disposal management will benefit the entire community \nin each town. The rehabilitation of bathhouses and the construction of two new bathhouses in \neach town will give significant public health benefits to the residents of informal areas, as well as  \nto some apartment residents.  \n \n55.  The Project will be implemented in each provincial town through local contracts that will \nprovide significant employment for local people. As the civil works will adopt labor-intensive \nconstruction methods, the Project should provide about 5,000 person-months of income-earning \nopportunities  per  town  on  average  (41,000  person-months  of  unskilled  labor  during \nimplementation).  Project  implementation  will  also  stimulate  the  local  construction  industry, \ngenerating  significant  direct  and  indirect  employment  opportunities.  The  computed  poverty \nimpact ratio of about 63% indicates significant pro-poor benefits, considering that the cumulative \n                                                 \n22 Affordability and subsidy schemes are discussed further in Supplementary Appendix F. \n ", "16  \nincome share of the poor is estimated to be less than 25% of the total. An initial poverty \nreduction and social analysis is found in Appendix 14. \n \n56.  Environmental benefits will be realized under the Project through efficient wastewater \ndisposal. The project towns generate solid waste with little organic material and, hence, little \nenvironmental risk. However, abattoir and hospital waste in several towns will be disposed of \nseparately under the Project with the implementation of the solid waste management program. \nSewage  oxidation  ponds  and  solid  waste  disposal  sites  will  be  rehabilitated  to  eliminate \ncontamination of groundwater and nearby rivers. The rehabilitation of sites owned by the local \ngovernments  will  obviate  the  need  to  acquire  new  land  or  displace  local  residents.  Minor \nnegative environmental impacts during the construction, such as increased dust, noise, or \ninconveniences to the neighborhood, will be monitored and mitigated by incorporating adequate \nprotection measures in the contract conditions. The PMO, with the support of the consultants, \nwill follow up environmental monitoring. Provincial government environmental protection unit \nstaff will be trained to strengthen monitoring capacity. Water conservation will be promoted by \nundertaking water loss reduction and consumer awareness programs. No indigenous people \nare  affected  by  the  Project.  Supplementary  Appendix  H  gives  the  results  of  an  initial \nenvironmental examination. \n \n57.  The Project will help reduce operating costs resulting from the use of aging equipment \nand outdated practices. The installation of meters in apartments and other public buildings and \nan increase in tariffs for those with direct connections to the water supply system will encourage \nusers to limit their water consumption. On the other hand, improved access to water and \nreduced water tariffs for residents of informal areas should increase consumption from as low as \n6 liters per capita per day to at least 15 liters by the end of the Project. These improvements, \ntogether with the leakage reduction component of the Project, will avoid the need to produce \nmore raw water over the next two decades. \n \nB.  Financial Aspects \n \n58.  In all project towns, tariffs for water and sanitation services are now lower than operating \ncosts and would fail to meet the full O&M costs and debt servicing of any loan. Hence, tariffs \nunder the Project are based on two objectives: (i) to enable full cost recovery of capital, interest \non debt, and O&M costs amortized over 22 years (including a 4-year grace period) at a rate of \n4.5%; and (ii) to maintain affordability of the three major consumer groups (organizations, \napartment dwellers, and informal area households). Water and sanitation tariffs together do not \nexceed the generally accepted norm of 6% of monthly expenditure. Significantly, the proposed \nwater tariff burden for informal area households is uniformly less than half of the accepted norm \nof 4% of household expenditure. By keeping tariffs low with no increase in real terms, the \nProject will help increase the water consumption of poor informal area residents to almost \ndouble within their affordability limit percentages of monthly expenditure for apartment and \ninformal area households.  \n \n59.  The  Project\u2019s  relending  term  has  been  carefully  designed  considering  the  Project\u2019s \nfinancial issues, i.e., keeping the principle of full cost recovery, maintaining affordability to the \nend beneficiaries, and strengthening the financial and institutional capacity of the PUSOs during \nthe transition toward a market economy. Through the 4.5% relending rate, the Project will \nchannel the concessionality of the funds to the end beneficiaries, allowing the PUSOs to keep \ntariff  increases  minimal,  financially  viable,  and  affordable  to  end  users  at  the  same  time. \nTherefore, the low relending rate will be applied to some extent as an implicit subsidy to the end \nbeneficiaries, but at the same time as a way to instill financial discipline in the PUSOs for cost ", "  17\nrecovery without hampering the principle of full cost recovery.23  The affordability, subsidy, and \nrelevant financial analyses are summarized in Appendix 15.  \n \n60.  To keep affordability within the generally accepted norm of 4% of household monthly \nexpenditure for water, and 6% for water and sanitation together, tariff increases will be kept \nminimal (no increase in informal residential areas, and less than 1% increase in real terms per \nyear in formal residential areas). The base-case financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) in the 8 \nproject towns range from 3.6% in Dalandzadgad to 6.2% in Sainshand. All FIRRs are well \nabove the real weighted average cost of capital of 2.5%, in spite of the minimal increase in \ntariffs required to maintain affordability. They are lowest in Dalandzadgad and Tsetserleg, as \nheating and hot water services in these towns are provided by separate entities (the power plant \nin the former, and a separate company in the latter); incorporating these entities into the PUSOs \nwould significantly increase their revenues. On the other hand, FIRRs are high for Baruun-Urt \nand Sainshand, as the PUSOs derive most of their revenue from heating and hot water supply. \nIn general, the FIRRs are sensitive to declines in operating revenues. With a decline of 10%, all \nFIRRs except the components in Mandalgobi decrease below the real weighted average cost of \ncapital.  \n \n61.  An important objective of the Project is to assist the PUSOs in generating more revenue \nfrom their own sources to sustain the administration and O&M of all basic infrastructure and \nurban services. Full cost recovery will be achieved for the heating and hot water, water supply \nand sanitation, and solid waste components. To enhance the poverty impact of the Project and \nreverse the regressive subsidy to apartment dwellers, tariff cross-subsidies have been targeted \nat informal areas, where the percentage of households falling below the poverty line is above \nthe average. The overall subsidy is modest and is justified on the basis of (i) the health benefits \nthat will result from increased access to water supply as well as individual water supply and \nsewerage connections in some informal areas, (ii) the high priority of informal area households \nfor  improved  solid  waste  collection  and  more  bathhouses,  and  (iii)  the  improvements  in \nenvironmental  cleanliness  and  therefore  in  health  and  productivity  among  informal  area \nhouseholds. While cross-subsidies between consumer groups are extensive, those between \nsubproject components are limited, and exist mainly for bathhouses, all of which are located in \ninformal  ger  areas.  Funds  required  to  cross-subsidize  water,  solid  waste,  and  bathhouse \nservices  to  informal  areas  will  come  primarily  from  heating,  hot  water,  water  supply  and \nsanitation  charges  imposed  on  organizations  and  apartment  dwellers.  According  to  PUSO \nfinancial projections, sufficient surpluses will be generated to cover the subsidies. Following the \nsocial pricing concept, it should be possible to recover a substantial portion of the costs from the \nusers at affordable tariffs. \n \nC.  Economic Aspects \n \n62.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated for subproject components \ncosting higher than $200,000, following ADB\u2019s Framework for the Economic Financial Appraisal \nof Urban Development Sector Projects.24 In particular, EIRRs were tested on water supply and \ndistrict heating with hot water supply components. The economic analysis was conducted based \non a domestic price numeraire, and the economic cost of capital and O&M using a standard \n                                                 \n23 The relending rate of the PTBUS Project was set at 10% to cover the high foreign exchange rate risk prevailing at \nthe time of project processing in 1996. Under this proposed Project, the foreign exchange risk becomes much more \nmanageable than before. Given the stable exchange rate of the togrog  during the last 3 years, the relending rate of \n4.5% (1.5% Asian Development Fund term with MOFE\u2019s charge of 3% [2% for the foreign exchange rate risk plus \n1% administration fee]) is established to channel concessionality to the project end beneficiaries. \n24 ADB. 1994. Framework for the Economic Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects. Manila. \n ", "18  \nconversion factor of unity. All EIRRs exceed the economic opportunity cost of capital of 12%. \nThe results of the economic evaluation are presented in Appendix 15.    \n \n63.  The economic evaluation of the water supply component is based on the benefits from \n(i) improved quality of nonincremental water supply to apartments and organizations, and (ii) \nincremental water supply to informal area households and newly developed plots. The water \nsupply improvements comprise benefits to public and commercial organizations and households \nwith connections and to households in informal areas that will have connections or will benefit \nfrom improved supply to local water kiosks. Public buildings and apartment households now \nconnected  to  the  central  system  will  benefit  under  the  Project  from  improved  quality  and \nreliability of piped water. Households in informal areas with new connections and those that still \nobtain water from kiosks will benefit from the quantity of incremental water resulting from the \nhigher level of service. The economic evaluation indicates that the water supply components in \nthree  towns\u2014Choibalsan,  Dalandzadgad,  and  Sainshand\u2014have  a  highly  satisfactory  EIRR \nranging from 46.3% in Choibalsan to 56.2% in Dalandzadgad. These are the three towns where \nthe water supply is most efficient, and the economic value of both the nonincremental and \nincremental water volume is quite high. While the EIRRs are lower in the other towns, they \nremain well above the economic opportunity cost of capital (EOCC) of 12%. Sensitivity analysis \nindicates that EIRRs are robust with respect to changes in costs and benefits, though they are \nmarginally more sensitive to a decrease in benefits. In general, benefits have to be reduced \nsignificantly (ranging from 10% in Bulgan to 55% in Dalandzadgad) to push the EIRR below the \n12% EOCC level. \n \n64.  The economic viability of the district heating and hot water supply component was \nanalyzed on the basis of (i) the economic value of incremental heat supply, estimated as \nconsumers\u2019 willingness to pay for improved heating service; and (ii) economic cost savings \nresulting from reduced losses of heat and hot water. EIRRs range from 23% to 58%, all above \nthe EOCC of 12%. The results of sensitivity analysis indicate that the economic viability of \ndistrict heating with hot water in general is slightly sensitive to a reduction in benefits, compared \nwith cost increases. However, benefits have to be reduced substantially (from 31% to 91%) \nbefore EIRRs fall down to the EOCC level of 12%. \n \n65.  The sanitation improvement, solid waste management, and bathhouse components of \nthe Project have been selected on a least-cost basis. The benefits of these components relate \nprimarily  to  health,  environment,  and  poverty  reduction,  and  as  such,  were  assessed  in \nqualitative terms. Since the economic cost of project components is uniformly less than the \nfinancial  cost  (adjusting  for  taxes),  the  results  of  the  financial  assessment  of  the  project \ncomponents provide an indication of their lower-bound estimates of economic merit. In addition, \nsince  all  components  will  have  positive  health  and  environmental  externalities,  they  are \nexpected to add substantial benefits from the improvement in public health through a reduction \nin typhus, diarrhea, and skin diseases such as scabies resulting from (i) an increase in the \nquantity of water consumed by the informal area residents, (ii) an improvement in the quality of \nwater, and (iii) an improvement in the health of children in the informal areas because of the \nreduced burden and energy consumption for the collection of water. Several unquantifiable \neconomic  benefits  of  the  Project  are  difficult  to  capture  in  the  analysis.  These  include  (i) \nimprovements in the environment because of the improved wastewater treatment and disposal \nof urban waste, (ii) improvements in the quality of urban life resulting from more reliable urban \nservices,  (iii)  increased  opportunities  for  local  enterprise  and  employment  through  the \ncommunity-type bathhouse facilities, and (iv) the use of labor-intensive construction methods for \nproject implementation to stimulate and support the economies of the towns and hinterlands.  ", "  19\n \nD.  Project Risks \n \n66.  The main risks associated with the Project are (i) Government fiscal constraints, which \nmay limit the availability of counterpart funds; (ii) logistical difficulties associated with the long \ndistances from the capital city and between the towns, which would increase transportation \ncosts; (iii) the reluctance of provincial governments to relinquish sufficient autonomy to the \nPUSOs to increase tariffs as necessary; and (iv) the limited institutional and financial capacities \nof the local governments and PUSOs to sustain the Project. The first constraint is general to \nMongolia and is not Project-specific. However, this risk has been addressed by keeping the \nproject intervention in each town small in size, thus reducing the financial demands for its \nimplementation.  The  potential  logistical  difficulties  of  the  Project  have  been  minimized  by \nselecting towns that form circular patterns outside the hinterland boundary of Ulaanbaatar in the \neastern  and  central  sections  of  the  country.  Local  governments  in  each  town  have  also \ndemonstrated a high commitment to the Project. Through the corporatization of the PUSOs and \nincreased financial independence, an arm\u2019s-length relationship will be developed between the \nPUSOs  and  their  provincial  governments.  Financial  discipline  has  been  introduced  in  the \nPUSOs by requiring them to borrow funds to implement infrastructure improvements. They must \nsustain their financial performance to successfully service the debt. To this end, commitment \ntoward tariff increases during project implementation has been obtained from the PUSOs and \ntheir provincial governments. The institutional development component is also geared toward \nmaking PUSO activities financially and technically sustainable. The limited experience of the \nPMO and PIUs in project implementation and supervision has been addressed by providing for \nconsulting assistance in implementation. Experienced personnel and lessons learned in the \nimplementation of PTBUS Project will also benefit project implementation. The project PMO and \nPSC have been established to help minimize potential delays in Project startup. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n67.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Central  Government  and  the  provincial \ngovernments of the project aimags have given the following assurances, which are incorporated in \nthe legal documents: \n \n1.  PUSO Corporatization  \n \n68.  The central and provincial governments will ensure that for each PUSO, except as \notherwise agreed on with ADB, (i) all five basic urban services subsectors in the project town \n(water supply, sanitation, solid waste, heating and hot water supply, and bathhouse services) \nare integrated into the PUSO\u2019s operations; (ii) the PUSO is duly established as a state-owned \nlimited liability company under the 1999 Company Law, with a management board, auditors, \nand articles of association authorizing the PUSO to engage in the services described in item (i) \nabove, as appropriate, and to borrow funds; and (iii) separate accounting for each of the \nservices described in item (i) above, as appropriate, is undertaken.  \n \n2.  Tariff Determination  \n \n69.  The central and provincial governments will ensure that, except as otherwise agreed to \nby  ADB,  the  tariffs  for  water,  sanitation,  solid  waste,  heating  and  hot  water  supply,  and \nbathhouse services in the project towns are as set forth in the tariff schedule that the central and \nprovincial governments and ADB agree on (Supplementary Appendix I). Starting in 2004, the \n ", "20  \nCentral Government and the relevant provincial government will ensure that the calculation of \ntariffs for water, sanitation, solid waste, heating and hot water supply, and bathhouse services in \neach project town is based on the principle of full cost recovery, taking into account capital \ninvestment costs, debt service obligations and O&M costs. Tariffs will be reviewed yearly and \nadjusted  as  necessary,  in  accordance  with  this  principle.  With  respect  to  the  residents  of \ninformal areas, during the term of the Loan there will be no increase, in real terms, in the tariffs \nfor water, sanitation, solid waste, heating and hot water supply, and bathhouse services that are \nset forth in the tariff schedule, until otherwise agreed on with ADB. If tariffs are increased for \ninformal areas during the term of the Loan, the PUSO and ADB will review and agree on the \ncalculation of future tariffs for such urban services subsectors.  \n \n70.  The central and provincial governments will ensure that project bathhouses (i) are cross-\nsubsidized by the PUSOs in a manner acceptable to ADB; and (ii) charge according to the \nsocial pricing system formulated under ADB\u2019s JFPR Project, Improving the Living Environment \nof the Poor in Ger Areas of Mongolia\u2019s Cities. \n \n71.  Each provincial government will ensure that (i) the PUSO submits annually to its tariff \nregulatory  board  tariff  proposals  calculated  according  to  the  principle  of  full  cost  recovery \ndescribed above; and (ii) tariffs thus set, and the obligation to pay them on time, are valid, \nbinding, and enforceable on all consumers and entities, including government-owned entities.  \n \n3.  Management Contracts  \n \n72.

The institutional development program comprises five subprograms: \n \nA.  Water Loss Reduction Program and Training in Operation and Maintenance  \n \n2.  Public urban services organization (PUSO) engineering staff will be the major target \nrecipient of this program. The objectives of the program are to (i) minimize the amount of water \nlost from the system during production and delivery; (ii) develop consumer awareness and \nincentives  to  reduce  wasteful  practices  and  repair  leaking  fixtures;  (iii)  create  sustainable \nprograms in each town so that wastage reduction objectives are maintained in the future; (iv) \ninstitute maintenance management systems so that PUSOs can obtain the data required to \nidentify the true cost of operating and maintaining individual assets in their system; (v) provide \nspecific training in the operation and maintenance of the new systems and equipment provided \nby the project; and (vi) provide training in water meter reading in conjunction with a water loss \nreduction program. Designs for water system improvements will incorporate metering so there \ncan be an accurate accounting of water produced up to the point of sale. Water meters provided \nby the Project will be installed in each apartment building such that residents can be billed for \nactual usage, which creates an immediate incentive to reduce wastage, as opposed to the \npresent flat rate system. The program will work in conjunction with the community awareness \nprogram  so  that  residents  are  introduced  to  the  concepts  of  water  metering  and  water \nconservation practices, and so that they are aware of the assistance available with replacement \nfixtures. The program will help PUSOs to analyze component maintenance cost, and to prioritize \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  activities  with  the  PUSOs  such  that  changes  in  tariff \nstructure  are  coordinated  with  the  introduction  of  metering  and  fixture  replacement. \nImplementation will require that the PUSOs be supplied with computers and software. PUSO \npersonnel who will operate these systems will be given the training in their operation and \nassistance in the establishment of documentation systems and in the restructuring of reporting \nand communication responsibilities that will be necessary. \n \nB.  Community Participation and Health Education \n3.  To organize and carry out a community participatory development approach, the town \nconsultative committee in each town will be the target group for the training, while involving \nstakeholders from the affected communities. The objectives of the program are to (i) achieve a \nsignificant degree of community participation in urban management, (ii) establish public support \nfor the Project including actions to reduce the negative consequences of tariffs and metering \nreforms for formal area residents, and (iii) promote the benefits that will materialize from the \nProject through health education and public awareness programs. Each town has designated \ncommunity leaders, local branches of the National Women\u2019s Federation, and poverty alleviation \nprogram offices. Participation of communities will be achieved through open meetings involving \nthese existing offices, community organizations, as well as leaders and residents representing \nindividual ger areas. The scope of the program includes (i) informing the community of the \nscope and nature of the Project; (ii) involving the community in designing and implementing the \nProject; and (iii) meetings to address the need to (a) increase bathing and laundry for health \npurposes; (b) handle solid waste disposal in a hygienic way; and (c) switch water sources from \na river or open wells to piped supply, with of particular emphasis on waterborne diseases such \nas  diarrhea,  fevers,  or  skin  and  eye  infections.  The  program  will  identify  the  activities, \ninstitutional responsibilities, organizational arrangements, and implementation schedule. It is \ncritical that the information dissemination and public consultations start prior to the completion of \nthe detailed engineering design of the project components so that community participation in the \nproject  design  will  be  ensured.  The  awareness  program  will  include  messages  on  the \nimportance of hygiene and sanitation practices, and the relationships among these practices, ", "  Appendix 8  33 \nwater, and good health. The awareness program will also be delivered through radio and local \nmedia, targeting the community as a whole. \n \nC.   Training in Financial Management and Corporate Planning  \n \n4.  PUSO management staff, accountants, and directors are the main target of the training. \nThe objectives of the program are (i) the introduction of financial management accounting and \ninformation  systems  that  are  prerequisites  to  (a)  improve  the  operational  efficiency  of  the \nPUSOs, (b) provide measures of their performance, and (c) create effective internal corporate \ngovernance; and (ii) the determination, introduction, and maintenance of tariffs covering all \nactivities  conducted  by  the  PUSOs  that  are  designed  to  meet  basic  financial  criteria. \nInternational and domestic consultants will work with small task forces in each PUSO in five \nstages of work: (i) developing a business plan for the PUSO in each project town; (ii) developing \nand implementing an appropriate and locally compatible financial and management accounting \nsystem and supporting documentation that will produce annual financial statements and regular \noperational  reports;  (iii)  delivering  accountancy  training  modules;  (iv)  developing  practical \nguidelines and appropriate formulas for setting tariffs to recover full investment and O&M costs; \nand  (v)  establishing  an  institutional  framework  and  mechanism  within  the  Ministry  of \nInfrastructure to monitor and determine their relative operational efficiency and performance. \n \nD.  Land Use Planning and Management   \n \n5.  Land use planning is a development tool, by which each town can strategize future \neconomic  activities  and  infrastructure  development  needs.  The  PUSO  director,  operation \nmanagement  staff,  as  well  as  the  chief  engineers  of  each  town  will  be  assisted  by  the \nconsultants in land use planning. The objectives of the program are to (i) strengthen the town \nand provincial governments\u2019 land use planning and management capacity; (ii) introduce the \nconcepts  of  land  management  in  a  market  economy  to  local  administrations  and  their \ncommunities; (iii) develop best practice systems for the process of allocating land; (iv) assist in \nthe revision of master plans; (v) assist with the programming, pricing and management of \nhousing action area planning schemes and their establishment as amendments to the master \nplans.  \n \nE.  Solid Waste Management Planning and Training  \n \n6.  The objectives of the program are to (i) work with the PUSOs to prepare solid waste \nmanagement plans that define the policy, institutional, financial, and operational requirements \nfor effective collection, treatment, and disposal for both formal and informal areas of the project \ntowns; and (ii) identify and provide capacity building, training and support as may be required to \npromote good practice and economic efficiency in solid waste management. This will involve (i) \nidentifying  constraints  to  the  existing  services  and  least-cost  technical  and  operational \nupgrading options; (ii) projecting domestic, municipal, and industrial solid waste volumes and \nfuture  disposal  capacity  requirements;  (iii)  identifying  current  and  projected  special  and \nhazardous wastes, (including clinical and toxic wastes); (iv) determining the institutional and \ncapital equipment requirements necessary to meet the projected collection, treatment, and \ndisposal  requirements  identified;  and  (v)  undertaking  financial  analyses  to  determine  the \ncharging structure required to achieve full cost recovery of the investments taking account of \ndifferential tariffs among household, municipal, commercial, and industrial generators. \n \n \n ", "34  Appendix 9 \nFINANCIAL EVALUATION OF PUBLIC URBAN SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS \n \nA.  Revenue Projections \n \n1.  Water Sales.  (Table  A9.1)  Total  revenues  have  been  projected  by  multiplying  the \nproposed  tariff  rates  (Supplementary  Appendix  I)  for  the  three  groups  of  customers \n(organizations, apartments, and informal areas) by the respective forecasts for annual water \nsales. Tariff rates used in the financial projections have been based on tariff increases agreed \nupon with the Government at the time of loan processing. In 2007, the year full operation will \ncommence,  these  rates  will  range  from  MNT509  per  cubic  meter  (current  price)  in \nDalandzadgad to MNT5,958 per cubic meter in Baruun-Urt for organization customers, from \nMNT284 in Bulgan to MNT958 in Tsetserleg per person per month for apartment customers, \nand will be MNT1,400 per cubic meter for all informal area customers. Increases in water sales \nhave been projected from the actual sales figures for 2001 based on new connections proposed \nin new plot areas and 20% increase in water consumption in informal areas. Town population is \nset constant, and it is estimated that 150 liters per capita per day of water consumption are \nrequired for formal areas. \n \n2.  Heating Sales. Heating sales revenues are derived from monthly standing charges \nlevied based on cubic meters of office space for organization customers and on square meter of \nroom size for apartment customers. There is no heating service in informal areas. The tariffs in \n2007 at current price ranges from MNT424 in Undurkhaan to MNT1,179 in Baruun-Urt per cubic \nmeter of building per month for organization customers, and from MNT74 in Mandalgobi to \nMNT298 in Choibalsan per square meter of floor size per month of apartment customers. \nDalandzadgad does not have heating revenue, as the heating service is operated by the Energy \nAuthority of Mongolia  \n \n3.  Other Revenues. Other revenues come from hot water, sanitation, solid waste, and \nbathhouses. Hot water revenue is calculated based on gigacalories (or 1,000,000 kilocalorie) \nconsumption for organization customers and per person for apartment customers. Hot water \ntariffs in 2007 at current price range from MNT3,077 in Mandalgobi, Tsetserleg, and Bulgan to \nMNT3,328 in Undurkhaan per gigacalorie for organization customers. The tariffs for apartment \ncustomers are MNT531 in Tsetserleg and MNT709 in Choibalsan per person per month. The \naverage sanitation charge is estimated at 80% of water tariffs charged. Solid waste revenues \nare calculated based on tons of waste generated from organization, per person for apartment \ncustomers, and per family for informal areas. The bathhouse revenue is assumed to be constant \nin real terms. \n \nB.  Expenditure Projections \n \n4.  Personnel  Costs.  Personnel  costs  include  salary  and  social  payments  for  all  staff \nemployed by PUSOs. In this analysis, it was assumed that the number of employees remains \nthe same except those subprojects with new boiler plants, bathhouse, water service unit, and \nsolid waste management subcomponents. Salary is constant in real terms. Personnel costs, \nhowever, would increase due to inflation. \n \n5.  Depreciation. Depreciation of fixed assets has been calculated using the straight-line \nmethod based on the nature of the fixed assets. No salvage value is assumed in the projections. \nEquipment  and  vehicles  are  depreciated  on  an  average  asset  economic  life  of  10  years. \nBuildings, pipes, and other fixed assets are depreciated over 40 years. There is no reevaluation \non existing fixed assets. Therefore, those existing fixed assets will continue be recorded and \ndepreciated at historical cost. It is expected that there will be a major rehabilitation and repair \nafter 10 years.  \n ", "  Appendix 9  35 \n  \n6.  Electricity and Coal. There would be some saving on the usage of electricity and coal \ndue to the replacement of new water pumps and new equipment on the boiler plants under the \nproject. The total electricity and coal expenses will be increased as the supply of hot water \nincreases. The electricity tariff and coal price are assumed constant in real terms and will be \nadjusted in line with inflation.  \n \n7.  Interest.  All project capital costs are assumed to be funded by loans to public urban \nservices organization (PUSO) at a cost of 4.5% per year, with repayment of loan principal over \n22 years inclusive of a 4-year grace period commencing in 2007. Repayments of the loan \nprincipal are assumed to increase in real terms during the course of the repayment period. The \nforeign exchange risk will be borne by the Government. The current portion of long-term loans, \nbeing the amount payable within a year, is included as a current liability in the balance sheet. \n \n8.  Tax. Value-added tax is calculated at 15% on civil works, equipment, vehicles, and \nadministrative  support  works.  Custom  duty  is  assumed  at  5%  on  imported  goods  and \nequipment. Income tax at a rate of 10% of net income has been assumed. \n \nC.  Inflation and Exchange Rates \n \n9.  Local inflation is assumed to be 6% per annum during the forecast period. The exchange \nrate is assumed to have averaged about MNT1,100 per dollar during 2002 and is assumed to \nremain constant at the current rate of MNT1,100 per dollar throughout the forecast period. \n \nD.  Financial Evaluation \n \n10.  The income statement, cash flow statement, and balance sheet projections are based on \nthe  anticipation  that  the  Government  will  implement  the  tariff  rates  proposed  in  the  loan \nagreement.  Details  of  the  evaluation  and  the  proposed  tariff  schedule  are  contained  in \nSupplementary Appendix I. The current tariffs in all PUSOs are below the required tariffs and do \nnot generate enough revenue to meet the debt service ratios. The financial projections reveal \nthat all PUSOs are financially sustainable over the projection period. While Baruun-Urt and \nMandalgobi  have  negative  retained  earnings  during  the  implementing  period,  the  retained \nearnings will become positive in 2012 and 2009, respectively. In 2007, full operation and debt \nservice of the loan will start. A summary of 2008 projected financial evaluation ratios\u20141 year \nafter operations commence\u2014is presented in Table A9.1.  \n \n1.  Projected Financial Performance \n \n11.  The  operating  ratio  measures  the  performance  for  the  level  of  operating  revenues \nconsumed by operating costs. Projected operating ratios of eight PUSOs are from 66% in \nChoibalsan to 97% in Baruun-Urt. Five PUSOs have ratios below 80%, which shows that the \noperating costs are within a reasonable level. Baruun-Urt\u2019s high operating ratio will be improved \ngradually to 80% by 2012. Percentage growths in revenue are from 8% in Sainshand and \nMandalgobi to 16% in Tsetserleg. The percentage growth shows that all PUSOs will have \noperating revenues increase over the whole projection period. Baruun-Urt has a negative return \non fixed assets and Dalandzadgad has zero return in 2008. This is due to significant increase in \nthe cost of sales as a result of operating of new boiler, and depreciation. The return on fixed \nassets for both PUSOs will become positive in 2009 and continue to improve throughout the \nprojection period.  \n ", "36  Appendix 9 \n \nTable A9.1: Projected Financial Evaluation Ratios of PUSOs, FY2008 \n \nFinancial Indicators  Baruun-  Bulgan  Choibalsan  Dalandzadgad  Mandalgobi  Undurkhaan  Sainshand  Tsetserleg \nUrt \nOperating ratio (%)  97  74  66  82  76  73  81  70 \n \nGrowth in revenue  11  11  9  14  8  13  8  16 \n(%) \nReturn on fixed  -2  2  3  0  2  2  2  2 \nassets  (%) \nCurrent ratio  0.76  6.18  6.05  3.5  3.00  3.23  4.62  2.93 \n \nDebt/equity ratio   2.73  1.3  1.37  1.52  1.49.  1.57  1.41  1.63 \n \nDebt to assets ratio  0.76  0.58  0.59  0.62  0.61  0.63  0.60  0.63 \n \nDebt service ratio  1.29  1.64  1.96  1.31  1.81  1.50  1.56  1.36 \n   \n2.  Projected Financial Position \n \n12.  The projected current ratios of all PUSOs except Baruun-Urt are above 2 to 1 through \nthe whole debt service period. Baruun-Urt\u2019s current ratio will exceed 2 to 1 by 2010. The current \nratios show that all PUSOs will have adequate financial liquidity to meet short-term debts. \nSeven of the eight PUSOs have debt/equity ratios below 2, which is considered adequate. Debt \nto assets ratios are high because the project costs are mainly from Asian Development Bank \nloan financing. Once the project is complete, the high debt ratio situation will be improved \nthrough revenue realization and the repayment of loans.  \n \n3.  Projected Cash Position \n \n13.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a National Priority in         Sector identified as a National Priority in Country \nCountry Poverty Analysis?  Yes   Poverty Partnership Agreement?  Yes \n Contribution of the urban sector to reduce poverty in Mongolia:  \n \n1.  A Poverty Partnership Agreement (PPA), signed between the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nand the Government on 24 March 2000, endorsed the poverty analysis and the long-term visions of \npoverty reduction. Review of the PPA in 2001 concluded that (i) ADB should adopt a more balanced \napproach in addressing urban and rural poverty, and (ii) infrastructure should be given increased \nemphasis. The Project will contribute to achieving the objectives of the Poverty Reduction Strategy for \nADB operations in Mongolia (2000-2005) by improving urban infrastructure in informal ger areas, \ncontributing balanced regional development, creating short-term employment opportunities for the poor, \nand promoting good governance of public service utility organizations. \n \n2.  About 40% of the urban population live in 18 provincial capitals or aimag centers. Provincial \ncapitals function not only as the administrative service centers but also as the economic focuses of their \nrural hinterlands, as most of the non-agricultural employment in the provinces is located there. To \ngenerate maximum benefits and increase the productivity of the urban population, efficient delivery of \nbasic urban services, such as heating and hot water, water and sanitation, solid waste management, \nand bathhouses, is an essential condition. However, in the past decade, Ulaanbaatar has attracted most \nof the foreign investment in urban infrastructure and services to the detriment of the aimag centers. \nUrban services in the provincial capitals are seriously dilapidated and in urgent need of repair and \nimprovement.  \n \n3.  Poverty means more than lack of adequate income, and involves multidimensional aspects. For \npoverty reduction, the Project aims to improve the quality of living standard, while redressing two levels \nof imbalance: (i) unequal regional development between Ulaanbataar and provincial capitals, and (ii) \nunequal access of basic urban services by the poor living in informal ger areas. For the former, the \nProject focuses on the development assistance for the provincial capitals where poverty incidence is \nhigher than the national average. For the latter, the Project emphasizes (i) the expansion and provision \nof the basic urban services to the informal ger areas where poverty incidence is likely to be twice as high \nas in the formal residence areas, and (ii) tariff reform to lower service charges to affordable levels for the \npoor  informal  ger  areas  residents.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  also  contribute  to  improving  the \ngovernance  of  local  service  delivery  organizations  through  various  institutional  development \ncomponents. \n \n4.  The total population of the eight provincial towns is estimated to be about 148,000, of whom \n60% live in informal ger areas. With an integrated development approach, all the residents in the project \ntowns are expected to have benefits through improved water supply, sanitation, public baths, solid waste \ndisposal, and district heating. The project poverty impact ratio is 63%, substantially higher than the \nincome share of the poor. In addition, it is estimated that a total of 46,500 person-months of construction \nemployment opportunities (unskilled 41,000 person-months, and skilled 5,500 person-months) will be \ngenerated over the 5 years of implementation. The Project\u2019s impact on employment generation will be \nhighly significant and will positively influence local economic activities.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis      Proposed Classification : Core Poverty Intervention \n5. Poverty incidence statistics by project towns, average of all 18 provincial capitals, and national \naverage is summarized in Table A14.1. Also, the economic impact of the Project on the poor is analyzed \nthrough the calculation of poverty impact ratios (PIRs). The PIR expressing the proportion of net \neconomic benefits accruing to the poor has been calculated for the Project as a whole by comparing the \nnet economic benefits to the poor with the net economic benefits to the Project as a whole. All financial \nand economic values are given in constant 2002 prices and in present value terms. The net present \nvalues of economic and financial returns of the Project and subprojects are estimated at 12%. The net \n ", "  Appendix 14  43 \npresent values are derived from the financial and economic analyses conducted for the Project as set \nout  in  Appendix  15.  Project  beneficiaries  are  divided  into  three  major  groups:  informal  ger  area \nresidents, formal apartment residents, and the government economy as a whole. The extent of benefits \nto  the  poor  is  expressed  by  the  percentage  of  poor  in  each  group,  as  determined  by  project \nsocioeconomic surveys. In the case of net economic benefits to the Government, it is assumed that 50% \nof the return to the Government will be shared by the poor, as the weighted average percentage of the \npoor in the eight towns is about 50%. Table A14.2 shows that the PIR for the Project as a whole is 63%, \nsubstantially higher than the income share by the poor, which is estimated at 25% of cumulative income. \n \n \n \nTable A14.1: Percentage of Poor and Very Poor in Project Towns \nAimag center  Population ('000)  % of population in Per Capita  Average  Average Daily \nTotal   Total  % Poor Formal  Informal  Poverty  Household  Water \nPoor (a)  Areas  Ger Areas Threshold in  Monthly Income  Consumption \nMNT(a)  in  MNT   per Capita in \nGer Areas  \nBaruun-Urt  15  5  71% 25 75 19,900 100,000  7\nBulgan  15  5  58% 41 59 18,200 88,000  12\nChoibalsan  39  17  51% 65 35 14,500 86,000  8\nDalandzadgad  13  7  45% 18 82 15,600 125,000  8\nMandalgobi  14  5  67% 12 88 15,600 100,000  7\nUndurkhaan  16  7  45% 38 62 19,300 93,000  7\nSainshand  18  5  28% 50 50 15,600 190,000  10\nTsetserleg  18  9  51% 20 80 14,500 194,000  12\nTotal  148  60  - - - - -  -\n8 towns average  19  8  51% 40 60 - 156,000  8\n18 provincial towns \naverage   25  12  46% 62 38 - -  -\nNational average   2,400  864  36% - - 18,500 -  -\n(a)  Internal Information Report of the Poverty Alleviation Program Office, at the end of 1999. \nSource: Statistical Yearbook of Mongolia, 2000; project preparatory technical assistance consultants\u2019 survey results \nat the end of 2001.  \n \nTable A14.2: Project Poverty Impact Ratio (MNT million) \nA.

About 40% of the project investment will be used for improving basic services in informal \nresidence areas, such as water and sewer pipeline extensions, solid waste collection facilities, public \nbathhouse facilities, and rehabilitation of pumping and treatment facilities. Through the Project, over \n41,000 person-months of income-earning opportunities for unskilled laborers\u2019 will be generated, which will \nlargely benefit the poor. The Project aims to increase the average water consumption level from the \ncurrent average of 8 liters per capita day to 30 liters per capita day on average, when informal ger area \nresidents connect to the improved water system (ranging up to 50 liters per capita day after individual \nconnections). Also, with the installation of meters in apartments and public buildings, the after-project \nwater consumption level is expected to decrease to some 100 liter per capita per day, once apartment \ndwellers have to pay for consumption per liter as opposed to the present flat monthly per person rate. The \nservice gap between formal and informal areas will be reduced in a longer term by gradually reducing the \ncurrent regressive subsidies from informal poor areas to formal apartment areas. Currently, the water \ntariff in informal areas is almost 10 times higher than that in formal apartment areas. To reduce this \nunequal service gap, the real tariffs on all project services to informal ger areas will be kept constant, \nwhile average tariffs for services (not only for water but all other services including district heating and hot \nwater supply) to formal apartment dwellers and organizations will be increased in real terms. Hence, as \ncosts increase, basic services to ger area residents such as water supply, solid waste collection, and \nbathhouses will be provided at less than full cost. As the tariff increase in the formal apartment areas \nwould be limited by their affordability during the project implementation period, the extent of reversing this \nregressive subsidy scheme will take longer than the project period. Hence, from both sides of consumer \ngroups, while still existing, the level of service differential will be significantly reduced through the Project \n(Table A14.3).  \n \n \nTable A14.3.

General \n \n1.  Financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) and economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) \nand fund flow projections have been prepared in accordance with the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) Framework for Economic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects \nand Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed \nby the Asian Development Bank. In addition, economic analysis has been conducted following \nADB Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Water Supply Projects. The main objective of the \nevaluation  is  to  determine  various  aspects  of  financial  and  economic  feasibility  of  the \nsubprojects in each town.  \n \nB.  Financial Analysis \n \n2.  FIRRs  have  been  prepared  for  the  integrated  subprojects  in  each  project  town \ncomprising heating and hot water, water supply and sanitation, solid waste management, and \nbathhouse  components.  The  analysis  has  been  carried  out  using  projected  public  urban \nservices organization (PUSO) finances, with and without the Project, up to 2017, i.e., 10 years \nafter assumed project completion. In most cases, 3 years, 1999-2001, have been used as the \nbase years, as before that time reliable records do not exist for the various entities, which were \nmerged to become the present day PUSOs. The analysis is expressed in constant 2002 prices \nand is based on (i) the estimated cost of the Project components inclusive of operation and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  and  depreciation;  (ii)  implementation  over  the  period  2003-2007;  (iii) \nprojections of operating revenues and costs, with and without the Project; and (iv) a real \nweighted average cost of capital of 2.5% for the Project. With-Project assumptions are based on \nenhanced  revenues  due  to  increased  tariffs  for  public  and  commercial  buildings  and \napartments, as well as the savings that will occur to overall service production as a result of the \nProject. Tariff for informal (ger) areas have been kept constant in 2002 prices, while increases \nfor commercial/public buildings and apartments have been kept as low as possible to maintain \naffordability  and  enhance  political  and  consumer  acceptance.  Details  of  subproject  and \nindividual  component  FIRR  calculations  are  contained  in  Supplementary  Appendix  F  and \nAppendix 5 of the Town Feasibility Studies. \n \n3.  Overall, the integrated FIRRs are adequate in spite of the minimal increase in tariffs \nrequired to maintain affordability. The base case FIRRs in the eight project towns vary from \n6.2% in Sainshand to 3.6% in Dalandzadgad, which are above the real weighted average cost \nof capital of 2.5%. They are the lowest in Dalandzadgad as heating and hot water services are \nprovided by a state-owned power company, the power plant of which also supplies district \nheating to the town. FIRRs are high for Baruun-Urt and Sainshand, as heating and hot water \nsupply the majority of revenue for these PUSOs. Mainly due to the minimal level of tariff \nincreases, the FIRRs are sensitive to declines in operating revenues. The FIRRs of individual \ncomponents in each town all exceed 4%. Although the analysis of the individual subcomponents \nshows that they are quite viable on their own, the Project will be investing in the integrated \nservices of the PUSOs and not in individual subcomponents. \n   \nC.  Tariffs and Household Affordability   \n \n4.  Tariffs have been set to match household affordability levels as well as the ability of \nPUSOs to meet their associated debt service obligations. Tariffs for heating, hot water, water \nsupply, sanitation, and solid waste management have been increased annually an average of \n2.7% over the domestic inflation rate for public/commercial buildings and only 0.4% per year for \n ", "  Appendix 15  47 \napartments.  Given  the  low  real  rate  of  tariff  increases,  the  average  total  tariff  burden  for \napartment dwellers is 7.2% of monthly expenditure and only 1.5% for water and sanitation. The \naverage total tariff burden for informal area households is 4.3% of monthly expenditure, with \nwater tariffs less than the 2% target of monthly household expenditure. By keeping tariffs \nconstant in real terms, the Project will contribute to increase the water consumption level of poor \nfamilies in informal areas, almost double (from the current average 8 liters per capita per day to \nover 15) within the general rule of 4% affordability limit. Percentage tariff increases for all \nservices and percent of monthly expenditures spent by apartment and informal area households \non basic services are set out in Supplementary Appendix F. Detailed tariff tables and projections \nare contained in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \nD.  Subsidies and Cost Recovery \n \n5.  To  enhance  the  poverty  impact  of  the  Project  and  reverse  the  present  regressive \nsubsidy to apartment dwellers, tariff cross-subsidies have been targeted at informal areas, \nwhere the percentage of households falling below the poverty line is extremely high. The \nbathhouse component, which provides bathing facilities for poor families in informal areas, is not \nfinancially viable and is therefore the target of cross-subsidies from other financially viable \ncomponents. Under the social pricing scheme for Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction-funded \nbathhouses, tariffs for very low and low income families will be substantially lowered such that \nthese families will be spending roughly half as much on bathhouse facilities as they are at \npresent. Funds required to subsidize water, solid waste, and bathhouse services to informal \nareas  will  be  derived  primarily  from  revenues  from  heating  and  hot  water  and  water  and \nsanitation charges to organizations and apartment dwellers. The overall subsidy to informal area \nresidents is modest and is justified on the basis that the country\u2019s economy is still in a state of \ntransition, and the fact that the private sector has not developed to the point that it can efficiently \nserve low income households. The cross-subsidies are also justified based on (i) the health \nbenefits that will result from increased access to water supply as well as individual water and \nsewerage connections in some informal areas, (ii) the high priority of informal area households \nfor improved solid waste collection and more bathhouses, and (iii) the improved environmental \ncleanliness  and  resultant  improvements  in  health  and  productivity  among  informal  area \nhouseholds. \n \nE.  Economic Analysis \n \n6.  The economic analysis of the Project has been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Water Supply Projects and Framework for Economic \nand Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects. A standard conversion factor \nhas been calculated based on Bank of Mongolia data. The shadow exchange rate factor in 2000 \nwas calculated to be 1.018, the inverse of which, 0.978, is the standard conversion factor. Since \nthe standard conversion factor is so close to unity, it does not appear that component costing, \nwhich is presently at the preliminary engineering stage, is very sensitive to shadow exchange \nrates. The economic analysis of the water supply components for each project town has been \nconducted using a domestic price numeraire. Due to distortions in the labor market, mainly the \ndifficulty in mobility of labor among the project towns, a shadow wage rate factor of 1.2 has \nbeen applied to skilled labor and 0.8 to unskilled labor. Following the guidelines set out in \nFramework  for  Economic  and  Financial  Appraisal  of  Urban  Development  Sector  Projects, \nsubproject components of which the base costs are higher than $200,000 have been the subject \nof the economic analysis. In general, economic analyses have been carried out on the Project\u2019s \nwater supply and heating components.  \n \n   ", "48  Appendix 15 \n1.  Economic Evaluation of Water Supply \n7.  The economic evaluation of the water supply component is based on the gross benefits \nfrom (i) the improved quality of non-incremental water supply to apartments and organizations, \nand  (ii)  the  substantial  incremental  water  supply  to  informal  area  households  and  newly \ndeveloped plots. The water supply improvements comprise benefits to public and commercial \nbuildings and apartment households with existing connections as well as to households in \ninformal areas that will have new connections or improved supply to local water kiosks. Benefits \nfrom non-incremental water were valued at the average supply price in economic terms, while \nbenefits from incremental water were valued at willingness-to-pay prices. Willingness to pay for \nincreased water consumption was determined according to the results of the feasibility study \nsocioeconomic survey in each of the project towns. Details of the economic calculations for the \nproject  towns  are  contained  in  Supplementary  Appendix  F  and  Appendix  6  of  the  Town \nFeasibility Studies. \n \n8.  The results of the economic evaluation indicate the water supply components in three \ntowns, Choibalsan, Dalandzadgad and Sainshand, have substantially high EIRRs ranging from \n56.2% in Dalandzadgad to 27.6% in Sainshand. These are the three towns where the existing \nwater supply is most difficient, and the economic value of both the non-incremental  and \nincremental water volume is quite high, while the EIRRs in the other towns remain well above \nthe economic opportunity cost of capital of 12%.  \n \n2.  Economic Evaluation of Heating \n \n9.  Given the fact that the Project\u2019s heating component comprises some 45% of the total \ninvestment,  an  analysis  was  carried  out  on  the  economic  viability  of  the  district  heating \ncomponents  in  each  project  town.  The  economic  analysis  is  based  on  the  following \nassumptions: \n \n(i)  capital and O&M costs for each town net of taxes and duties; \n(ii)  savings in O&M costs due to the subproject; and \n(iii)  incremental consumer heat supply is valued on the basis of willingness to pay for \nheating. The incremental heat supply results from heating being supplied to \nadditional  apartments  and  institutions,  savings  resulting  from  reduced  losses \nfrom boilerhouses, reduced wasteful heat in the main heating lines, and reduced \nlosses in hot water from apartment dwellers tapping radiators for hot water.  \n \n10.   In general, the EIRRs are substantially higher than the economic opportunity cost of \ncapital of 12%, varying from 23.4% in Choibalsan to 58.7% in Mandalgobi. This result is to be \nexpected for two reasons: (i) the substantial difference between project financial and economic \ncosts, where taxes are 20% on equipment (15% value-added tax and 5% import duty), 15% \nvalue-added tax on civil works, and 10% corporate tax on the PUSOs; and (ii) the substantial \nwillingness  to  pay  for  heating,  a  necessary  service  in  the  winter  time,  which  has  been \ndeteriorating  in  quantity  and  quality  over  the  past  decade  in  all  project  towns.  Detailed \ncalculations of the individual EIRRs are contained in Supplementary Appendix F and Appendix \n6 of the Town Feasibility Studies. \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20020716114540", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 4.0 for Windows", "ModDate": "D:20020809101825+08'00'"}}
