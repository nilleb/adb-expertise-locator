Subprogram  2  of \nthe program cluster will support improved fiscal management and structural measures that will \naid  economic  recovery  and  place  the  economy  on  a  sustainable  medium-term  growth  path. \nBudget  support  will  help  protect  the  delivery  of  basic  services  to  the  vulnerable,  and  be \ncomplemented by actions to engage with key stakeholders. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe Solomon Islands economy has been among the most affected in the Pacific by the \nglobal economic crisis. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 7.3% per annum in the \n5 years to 2008. In 2009, GDP contracted by 1.2%. Solomon Islands returned to positive growth \nof  around  7.2%  in  2010.  While  economic  growth  rebounded  quickly,  medium-term  growth \nprospects  are  uncertain.  Stocks  for  the  key  industry\u2014logging\u2014are  expected  to  be  largely \nexhausted by the middle of the decade. The economy is also one of the most aid-dependent in \nthe world.  \n \n4. \nThe  program  cluster  was  designed  to  support  the  Government  of  Solomon  Islands  to \nmake short-term fiscal adjustments in response to the global financial crisis and lay a foundation \nfor strengthening the medium-term reform agenda. Since its initiation, the program has helped \nthe  government  weather  the  recent  global  economic  crisis  with  its  financial  position \nstrengthened, largely due to the efforts made under the government\u2019s reform program supported \nby  the  Core  Economic  Working  Group  (CEWG)  development  partners. 3  The  change  in \ngovernment  in  late  2010  required  additional  time  to  resume  work  on  formulating  and \nimplementing policy. The new government, however, remains strongly committed to continuing \nregular and systematic policy dialogue through the CEWG to support the reform program. The \nCEWG donor coordination model in Solomon Islands is considered to be a best-practice model \nof donor coordination in the Pacific.4 The government is now committed to improving the quality \nof public expenditure for better service delivery, as reflected in the government policy statement \nand the new National Development Strategy (NDS) 2011\u20132020 (currently being finalized). \n \n5. \nFrom  subprogram  1  to  subprogram  2. Subprogram 1, which was completed in 2010, \nachieved successful policy and institutional reforms. Solomon Islands satisfied all 19 conditions \nfor  the  subprogram  1  grant  and  the  single  tranche,  totaling  $5  million,  was  fully  disbursed.5 \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Program Cluster and \n\nGrant for Subprogram 1 to Solomon Islands for the Economic Recovery Support Program. Manila. \n\n3  CEWG development partners include ADB, Australia, the European Union, New Zealand, the Regional Assistance \n\nMission to Solomon Islands, and the World Bank. \n\n4  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Public  Sector  Management  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n5  Progress,  achievement,  and  lessons  learned  from  subprogram  1  are  in  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Public \nSector Management, and Contribution to the ADB Results Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2). \n\n\f2 \n\nSubprogram  2  completes  the  program  reform  agenda  under  the  program  cluster.  In  addition, \nafter the program completion, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will continue to be involved in \nproviding  policy  advice,  offering  technical  assistance  (TA),  and  monitoring  reform  progress \nagainst  the  incremental  reforms. 6  Subprogram  2  supports  the  government\u2019s  economic  and \nfinancial reform program in coordination with key development partners including Australia, the \nEuropean  Union,  New  Zealand,  the  Regional  Assistance  Mission  to  Solomon  Islands,  the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank.  \n \nSubprogram  1  has  effectively  supported  recovery  from  the  crisis  with  growth,  and  the \n6. \nfiscal  and  external  positions  all  significantly  improved  in  2010  compared  with  2009. 7 \nSubprogram  2  continues  to  (i)  support  the  government  with  the  adjustment  costs  arising  from \nimplementing an economic reform program to place the economy on a sustainable growth path, \nand (ii) facilitate a diversification of the economy away from unsustainable levels of logging and \naid. It supports improved fiscal management and structural measures to ensure sustainability of \nthe economic recovery and helps protect the delivery of basic services to the vulnerable. \n \nAfter  closely  consulting  with  the  government  and  accounting  for  evolution  of  priorities \n7. \nand policies, the prior policy actions for subprogram 2 were finalized, closely approximating the \n24 indicative triggers identified at the time of subprogram 1, with two modifications. One of the \nindicative triggers, regarding amendment of the bareboat charter law, was removed in light of a \nconsensus  that  impediments  to  operation  of  the  franchise  shipping  scheme  had  been  more \nefficiently addressed with other measures. Another indicative trigger, concerning adoption of the \nExtractive  Industries  Transparency  Initiative  (EITI)  principles,  was  adjusted  to  recognize  that \nSolomon  Islands  has  officially  endorsed  the  principles,  with  the  consequential  legislative \namendments  in  the  tax  regime  to  be  proposed  through  government  undertakings  in  the  grant \nagreement. All 23 prior policy actions and conditions in the policy matrix have been performed \nand satisfied, except for the adoption of NDS, which is at an advanced stage. ADB is currently \nsupporting the government in preparing the NDS.8 Completion of the adoption of the NDS is a \ncondition to the effectiveness of the grant agreement.   \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  expected  impact  of  subprogram  2  is  the  achievement  of  a  higher  and  more \n8. \ninclusive path of economic growth.  The expected outcome is to continue the positive trend of \neconomic  recovery  with  protection  of  the  vulnerable  and  the  fiscal  position.  The  impact  and \noutcome are to be achieved through reforms in the four program outputs, leading to improved \nfiscal  management, an improved  enabling  environment for  the  private  sector, support  for the \nvulnerable,  and  strengthened  communication  and  ownership  of  policy  actions  by  the \ngovernment and the general public. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nSubprogram  2  continues  the  policy  and  institutional  reform  actions  begun  under \n\n9. \nsubprogram 1. \n\n                                                 \n6  On 9 June 2011, the cabinet endorsed the medium-term policy matrix with triggers and actions to be accomplished \nand  assessed  annually  by  the  end  of  2011,  2012,  and  2013.  This  medium-term  policy  matrix  will  be  a  basis  for \nCEWG development partners in providing additional budget support to the government. \n\n7  Detailed  economic  and  fiscal  analyses  and  the  recovery  are  in  Economic  Analysis,  and  detailed  macroeconomic \n\ntrends are in Country Economic Indicators (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to Solomon Islands for Support for the Formulation of a National Strategic Plan. \n\nManila (TA 7616-SOL). \n\n \n\n\f \n10. \nOutput  1:  Improved  fiscal  management.  This  output  is  directed  to  achieving  the \nmedium-term goals of achieving overall fiscal discipline, providing strategic guidance to public \nfinancial  management  (PFM)  reform,  ensuring  effective  expenditure  controls  are  in  use, \nraising  the  efficiency  and  fairness  of  the  revenue  system,  and  improving  the  allocation  of \npublic  resources  through  strengthened  budgeting  and  planning  processes.  This  output \nsupports  short-term  fiscal  consolidation  while  seeking  to  maintain  the  capacity  to  fund \nessential  services  and  public  investment  over  the  medium  term.  The  output  also  helps \naddress shortcomings in governance. The emphasis is on initiatives that address the weakest \nareas  of  PFM  identified  in  the  2008  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability \nassessment.9 ADB operations have also provided additional technical support for achievement \nof output 1 through several TA projects.10 \n \n11. \nAchieving  overall  fiscal  discipline.  Subprograms  1  and  2  provide  for  adherence  by \nthe 2010 and 2011 budgets and the medium-term fiscal framework to the fiscal commitments \nof  the  Honiara  Club  Agreement 11  (or  any  updated  arrangement  put  in  place  with  the \ninternational community). Under subprograms 1 and 2, the government committed to keep the \npublic debt\u2013GDP ratio below 30% and to keep the ratio of payroll charges to GDP in 2010 to \nno  more  than  the  2009  level.  Under  the  agreement,  the  government  committed  to  (i)  avoid \nfurther  borrowing  or  sovereign  guarantees  until  the  government  reaches  green  light  status \nunder  the  international  debt  distress  rating  system,  and  (ii)  maintain  a  fully  funded  recurrent \nbudget  excluding  the  use  of  borrowing  to  fund  recurrent  expenditure.  There  has  been \ncompliance with these fiscal provisions. \n \nThe 2011 budget, which was approved by the Parliament on 11 April 2011, is consistent \n12. \nwith fiscal consolidation and was assessed by ADB. The budget is based on the assumption of \ncontinued  economic  expansion  and,  consistent  with  the  Honiara  Club  Agreement,  does  not \nenvisage  new  sovereign  borrowing.  Due  attention  has  been  paid  to  supporting  the  delivery  of \nessential  services,  with  priority  given  to  maintaining  recurrent  budget  for  education,  health, \ntransport,  and  grants,  such  as  provincial  grants,  at  original  2010  levels,  which  comfortably \nexceed  the  2009  benchmark  by  an  amount  greater  than  the  value  of  the  ADB  loan.  The \ngovernment's  contribution  to  the  development  budget  has  also  increased  substantially. \nAdditional  budget  support  (both  general  and  sectoral)  is  factored  into  the  budget,  including  a \ngrant  of  SI$40  million  (around  $5  million)  from  ADB.  Payroll  is  estimated  at  10.2%  of  GDP,  a \nlower  figure  than  for  the  previous  2  years  as  growth  in  payrolls  has  been  kept  below  that  of \nnominal  GDP.  A  cash  cushion  of  3  months  of  recurrent  expenditure  has  been  provided  for  as \nrequired  by  the  conditions  of  the  IMF  program  for  standby  credit  facility.12 The  IMF  mission, \nwhich  was  fielded  on  3\u201313  May  2011,  found  that  the  IMF  program  performed  well,  with \n\n                                                 \n9  European Union. 2008.

This  document  is  also \nknown as the Honiara Club Agreement, which is a key instrument for guiding overall fiscal consolidation. \n\n12 IMF.  2010.

The key risk factors in the budget include (i) \nthe potential for an overestimation of domestic revenue, that is forecast to rise by 12.0%; (ii) the \nprospect of a decline in logging; and (iii) expenditure pressures that may arise from the need for \nthe  government  to  accommodate  a  fractious  coalition,  which  may  result  in  a  series  of \nsupplementary appropriations. The large wage and salary bill will remain an ongoing source of \nfiscal pressure, and may displace funding for investment and goods and services if the revenue \noutcome is less than expected. \n \n14.  Moving  to  multiyear  budgeting  and  strengthening  the  budgeting  and  planning \nprocesses.  Subprogram  2  provides  for  (i)  commencement  of  a  public  expenditure  review \n(launching  operation  of  the  new  budget  system  with  capacity  to  accommodate  multiyear \nbudgeting  and  integration  of  recurrent  and  development  budgets),  and  (ii)  instituting  the  new \nNDS.  The  NDS  has  been  under  formulation  since  early  2010.  In  May  2010,  the  cabinet \nendorsed (i) the national strategy framework, precursor to the NDS; and (ii) an NDS task force \ncomprising the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT), Prime Minister\u2019s Office, the Ministry of \nDevelopment  Planning  and  Aid  Coordination,  and  the  Central  Bank  of  Solomon  Islands. \nFollowing  submission  of  the  first  draft  NDS  in  December  2010,  intensive  work  on  stakeholder \nconsultation is anticipated to conclude with adoption of the NDS by late July or August 2011. \n\nto \n\nto \n\nthe  government's  efforts \n\nimprove  PFM.  Subprogram  2  provides \n\n \n15. \nProviding  strategic  guidance  to  public  financial  management  reform.  Under \nsubprogram  1,  the  cabinet  endorsed  a  number  of  measures  to  provide  high-level  strategic \nguidance \nfor \nimplementation of the strategies to improve whole-of-government financial reporting and internal \naudit.  These  actions  are  oriented  towards  the  long-term  goal  of  receiving  an  unqualified  audit \nopinion on the whole-of-government accounts. \n \nEnsuring  effective  expenditure  controls  are  in  use.  The  program  has  assisted  the \n16. \nprocess  of  fiscal  consolidation  by  strengthening  expenditure  controls  including  (i)  upgrades  to \nthe financial management information and payroll systems, (ii) preparation and adoption of new \nfinancial  instructions,  and  (iii)  cabinet  endorsement  of  strategies  to  modernize  supply  chain \nmanagement  (procurement)  procedures  under  subprogram  1.  Subprogram  2  provides  for  (i) \nimplementing  new  financial  instructions,  (ii)  \u201ccleansing\u201d  the  payroll  data  to  increase  the \neffectiveness of the new payroll system introduced in subprogram 1, and (iii) implementing the \nmechanisms  to  tighten expenditure  controls.  Procurement  compliance has  been  strengthened, \nwith the revised financial instructions becoming operational with effect from 1 July 2010.14 \n \n17. \nRaising the efficiency and fairness of the revenue system. The Medium-Term Fiscal \nStrategy 2008\u20132013 outlined the government\u2019s commitment to further tax reform. Key objectives \nare  to  broaden  the  tax  base,  shift  reliance  away  from  direct  taxes,  and  simplify  the \nadministration of tax, both for the government and for taxpayers. Subprogram 2 provides for the \nadoption  of  cross-government  revenue  management  enhancements  covering  legislative  and \noperational  reform,  endorsement  of  EITI,  preparation  of  a  new  tax  regime  for  the  mining \nindustry, and commencement of a review of the Customs Act, overseen by a high-level steering \ncommittee. Subprograms 1 and 2 demonstrated concrete progress in revenue management by \nMOFT and its subordinated agencies.  By a cabinet decision on 19 May 2011, the government \n\n                                                 \n13 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 MOFT  has  developed  procurement  tools  including  revised  and/or  expanded  procurement  checklists  and  provided \ntraining  to  line  ministries.  Opportunities  for  further  analysis  of  procurement  information  and  publication  of  tender \noutcomes will be important to ensure effective implementation and compliance with the revised financial instructions. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\ffor  coordinating  revenue  management \n\ninitiated  a  broader  cross  government  strategy \nenhancement in other branches such as land and fisheries. \n \n18. \nOutput  2:  Productivity  enhancing  structural  initiatives.  This  output  implements \nstructural  initiatives  with  the  potential  for  short-term  boosts  in  economic  activity  and  those \nreforms  needed  to  achieve  medium-term  rebuilding  of  economic  growth.  A  key  concern  is \ndiversifying  the  economy  away  from  logging  and  foreign  aid  towards  alternative  sources  of \ngrowth\u2014agriculture  (primarily  palm  oil,  cocoa,  and  copra),  fishing  and  marine  products, \nmining, and tourism.15 \n \n19. \nThere are four areas of focus under this output: (i) improving the efficiency and reducing \nthe  drain  of  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  on  the  budget,  which  should  in  turn  reduce \ncrowding  out  of  the  private  sector;  (ii)  deregulating  the  telecommunications  industry  to  expand \nservice  coverage,  raise  standards,  and  lower  prices;  (iii)  enhancing  the  business  regulatory \nenvironment  to  directly  reduce  the  cost  of  doing  business  in  Solomon  Islands;  and  (iv) \ndeveloping  the  transport  infrastructure  to  raise  investment  levels  and  service  standards  and \nlower transport operating costs. \n \n20. \nImproving accountability and performance of state-owned enterprises. Subprogram \n2  provides  for  (i)  public  release  of  an  annual  SOE  monitoring  report, 16  (ii)  endorsing  debt \nrestructuring  for  the  Solomon  Islands  Electricity  Authority  (SIEA)  and  new  appointments  to \nsenior  positions,  (iii)  completing  the  tender  process  for  sale  of  Sasape  Marina  and  initiating  a \nrestructure  of  Solomon  Airlines,  and  (iv)  implementing  SOE  regulations  on  community  service \nobligations and appointing directors with a view to further enhancing performance. Subprogram \n2 requires further actions to resolve the debt that the Solomon Islands Water Authority (SIWA) \nowes  to  the  SIEA  (more  than  SI$20  million).  A  joint  donor  program\u2014the  Pacific  Regional \nInfrastructure  Facility\u2014is  currently  funding  advisory  assistance  to  SIWA.  An  output  from  this \nassistance includes completing the recovery action plan, which includes proposed measures to \nsettle SIWA\u2019s debt to the SIEA. \n \n21. \nDeregulating  the  telecommunications  industry.  The program provides for the end of \nthe  legislated  monopoly  on  mobile  telecommunications.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  voluntary \nlicense  was  completed  and  new \nrelinquishment  of \ntelecommunications legislation was enacted. Subprogram 2 provides for the continuation of this \nprocess  through \nindependent  regulator.

The government is implementing a number of \nreforms  aimed  at  reducing  the  cost of  doing  business  and ensuring  a  level  playing  field  for  all \nbusinesses. The Companies Act 2009 and the Companies (Insolvency and Receiverships) Act \n2009  and  associated  regulations  were  gazetted  and  commenced  on  1  July  2010.  The  new \ncompany  registry  commenced operation  on  the  same  day  with  paper-based  registration;  the \nnew electronic registry successfully went live in December 2010. To ensure sustainability of the \n                                                 \n15 ADB operations that have provided additional support to achieve this output area include: ADB. 2006.

Subprogram  2  provides  for  (i)  updating  the \nnational  transport  plan  to  implement  an  updated  3-year  rolling  work  program,  and  (ii) \nimplementing \nIslands  Maritime  Safety \nAdministration.  Redesign  of  shipping  routes  and  insurance  coverage  was  introduced  to  bring \nabout  timely  modification  and  successful  operation  of  the  scheme  without  the  need  for \nlegislative revisions earlier anticipated during subprogram 1. \n \n24. \nOutput  3:  Support  for  the  vulnerable.  The  budget  support  provided  under  the \nprogram  cluster  will  allow  a  slightly  higher  level  of  government  expenditure  than  would \notherwise be possible. Additional financial resources provided by ADB will reduce the national \nbudget's financing gap and thereby help preserve the delivery of basic transport services, rural \nhealth  services,  and  basic  education.  The  increased  budget  allocation  for  education  and \nhealth  is  more  critical  for  females  than  males  in  Solomon  Islands,  given  the  current  gender \ngap  in  these  sectors.  Specifically,  the  government  made  commitments  under  subprogram  2 \nregarding the additional allocation of its own funds under the 2011 recurrent budget to goods \nand  services  (i.e.,  nonpayroll  costs)  to  education,  health,  and  infrastructure  services.  These \nadditional funds are at least equal to the level of the grant provided under subprogram 1. The \n2011  recurrent  budget,  less  the  sum  of  the  payroll  and  development  budgets,  provided  an \nadditional  allocation  of  SI$157  million \nfor  education,  health,  and \ninfrastructure  services,  which  substantially  exceeds  the  grant  of  approximately  SI$40  million \nprovided under subprogram 2. \n \n25. \nOutput 4: Communication and ownership of policy actions. Under subprogram 2, a \ncommunications  and  engagement  strategy  is  being  developed  to  explain  the  government\u2019s \nresponse  to  the  global  economic  crisis,  including  (i)  actions  to  address  the  needs  of  the \nvulnerable, (ii) the state of public finances and PFM reform, and (iii) structural initiatives. Public \nrelease of key fiscal information has been expanded to include debt statistics and operation of \nan  MOFT  website.  The  engagement  strategy  developed  in  consultation with  stakeholders  was \nendorsed by the cabinet in May 2011. \n \nD. \n\nProgram Costs and Financing \n\nfrom  2009 \n\nlevels \n\nThe  government  has  requested  a  grant17 not  exceeding  $5  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \n26. \nFunds  resources  to  help  finance  the  program.  The  grant  size  was  determined  after  due \nconsideration of (i) the estimated impact of the global economic crisis and the associated overall \nprojected financing requirements for the national budget, which is estimated by the IMF at $25 \nmillion  annually  in  2010  and  2011;  (ii)  the  availability  of  additional  finance  from  other \ndevelopment partners; (iii) the significance and complexity of the policy actions of the program, \nwhich are expected to generate substantial development benefits; and (iv) the grant proceeding, \nthereby  allowing  the  government  to  expand  budget  expenditure  for  public  services  thus \nprotecting  vulnerable  populations  from  adverse  impacts  of  the  global  economic  crisis.  The \ndetermination  of  grant  size  took  into  account  the  government's  demonstrated  commitment  to, \nand progress in implementing, the policy agenda. \n\n                                                 \n17 A country's eligibility for Asian Development Fund grants under the revised grant framework is determined by its risk \nof  debt  distress.  The  latest  debt  sustainability  analysis  in  the  IMF  2009  Article  IV  Consultation  determined  that \nSolomon Islands had a moderate risk of debt distress and was therefore eligible to receive 50% of its ADF allocation \nas grants. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n27. \nThe  program  cluster  period  spans  from  1  March  2009  to  28  February  2012,  with  the \nsubprogram 2 implementation period embracing 1 March 2010 to 28 February 2012 with post-\nprogram  partnership  monitoring  efforts  with  other  CEWG  members  to  continue  through  2013. \nSubprogram 2 funding will be provided as a single tranche grant of $5 million to be disbursed \nwhen  the  government  has  met  the  conditions  for  effectiveness  including  completion  of  the \nagreed prior policy actions as set forth in the policy matrix.18 \n \n28. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  grant  will  be  disbursed  to  Solomon  Islands  as  the  recipient \naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  simplified  disbursement  procedures  and  related  requirements  for  program \ngrants.19 The  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member \ncountries;  items  in  the  list  of  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral  sources  are  excluded.20 Grant  proceeds  disbursed  against  imports  will  require  a \ncertificate from the government stipulating that the value of the total imports of Solomon Islands, \nminus  its  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports  financed  under \nother  official  development  assistance,  is  at  least  equal  to  the  amount  of  the  grant  to  be \ndisbursed during a particular year. Local currency generated from the proceeds of the grants will \nbe used to support public expenditure objectives under the program. \n \nThe MOFT will be the executing and implementing agency and will oversee policy, legal, \n29. \nand  regulatory  actions  and  ensure  that  the  policy  actions  as  agreed  upon  by  the  government \nand ADB are duly carried out on time. Several ongoing ADB TA projects (footnotes 10 and 15) \nare assisting the government in (i) implementing the reforms and meeting tranche conditions in \nthe  short  term,  and  (ii)  building  the  government\u2019s  capacity  in  the  medium  and  long  term.  The \nMOFT  is  responsible  for  overall  implementation  of  subprogram  2,  including  carrying  out  all \npolicy actions, program administration, disbursements, and maintenance of all program records. \nThe  MOFT  will  (i)  establish  and  maintain  a  performance  evaluation  system  for  the  program, \nwhich will be derived from the design and monitoring framework, policy letter, and policy matrix; \nand  (ii)  monitor  and  report  to  ADB,  on  a  biannual  basis  over  the  term  of  the  program,  the \nimplementation of policy actions and their impact on budget outcomes, in line with the program \nimpact and outcome indicators agreed upon with the government. Monitoring of outcomes and \nimpacts will maximize use of the government\u2019s own processes and the CEWG mechanism. \n \n30. \nIn  cooperation  with  the  MOFT  and  CEWG,  ADB  will  carry  out  periodic  reviews  of \nprogress implementation and assess the impact of the program, which continues from the well-\nfunctioning practice under subprogram 1.21 The government will continue to keep ADB informed \nof  the  outcome  of  policy  discussions  with  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies  that  have \nimplications for program implementation, and will provide ADB with the opportunity to comment \non any resulting policy proposals. ADB, in collaboration with the MOFT and key multilateral and \nbilateral  agencies  via  the  CEWG,  will  undertake  regular  reviews  of  program  performance.  The \nreviews  will  evaluate  implementation  of  the  policy  reform  measures  and  assess  the  impact, \ndescribe  lessons  identified  during  the  program  period,  and  outline  policy  actions  and  any \nassistance  needed  for  sustained  economic  recovery.  The  program  reviews  and  the  design  of \nsubprogram  2  have  drawn  on  dialogue  with  stakeholders  from  the  private  sector  and  civil \n                                                 \n18 An informal Board seminar  was held on 16 October 2009 to discuss program assistance to the Pacific developing \n\nmember countries: the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Tonga. \n\n19 ADB. 1998.

A large gold mine \nclosed during the civil unrest has recently reopened in March 2011, and there is potential over \nthe  longer  term  to  develop  large  nickel  deposits.  While  mining  projects  would  boost  GDP,  the \nsector would employ few people and there would be long lags before government revenue rose. \nThe best prospects for job creation and for higher government revenue lie in large-scale palm oil \ndevelopments,  in  fishing  (there  is  already  one  large  fish  cannery),  and  in  the  smallholder  tree \ncrops  of  cocoa  and  copra.  The  supply  of  fruit  and  vegetables  to  the  urban  centers  as  a \nsubstitute for imports also offers good prospects, as does the fledgling tourism industry. \n \n32. \nA number of recent studies have examined the economic growth prospects allowing for \ndifferent scenarios. The studies have identified the potential for economic growth after logging, \nalbeit at only low to moderate rates that would see, at best, slow growth in real GDP per capita \nin  the  medium  term.  The  studies  have  also  highlighted  the  need  for  concerted  government \naction to realize the potential growth, and the risk of inaction. \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n33. \nPublic  financial  management.  The  quality  of  public  sector  financial  management  has \nbeen improved in recent years. The government has embarked on a series of public expenditure \nreforms,  including  clearing  the  backlog  of  unaudited  central  government  financial  statements, \nintroducing a medium-term fiscal framework, paying debt interest and trade creditor arrears, and \nincreasing  revenue  collection.  However,  a  number  of  weaknesses  remain  in  public  sector \nfinancial  management  that  adversely  affect  public  service  delivery,  threaten  aggregate  fiscal \ndiscipline,  and  undermine  the  strategic  allocation  of  public  resources.  To  address  the \nweaknesses,  the  government  and  development  partners  continue  to  deepen  the  reforms  that \nsimultaneously strengthen the government\u2019s institutions and capacity.22 \n \n34. \nAnticorruption.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  MOFT.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the legal documents and the grant regulations. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n35. \nThrough  all four  main  program  outputs,  policy  reforms  are  expected  to  have  significant \npoverty and social benefits. Reforms under the first output of improved fiscal management allow \nthe  government  to  dedicate  more  resources  to  pro-poor  expenditure.  Improvements  in  budget \nprocesses  are  expected  to  lead  to  more  efficient  service  delivery.  Policy  actions  under  the \nsecond  output  to  enhance  productivity  are  aimed  at  increasing  economic  activities  and \ninvestment.  Promoting  private  sector  development  was  designed  to  support  economic  growth, \n\n                                                 \n22 Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Public  Sector  Management  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \nAppendix 2) contains detailed information on public sector management performance, problems, and opportunities \nas well as the government\u2019s sector strategy and ADB sector assistance. Risk Assessment and Risk Management \nPlan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) also addresses risk mitigation measures.  \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fjob  creation,  business  opportunities,  improved  livelihood,  and  poverty  reduction.  More  specific \nsupport  for  the  vulnerable  is  featured  in  the  third  output  by  requiring  an  increased  share  of \nrecurrent budget funding for basic education, health, and rural transport services, in recognition \nof the extra hardship imposed by the global economic crisis and the preceding episode of high \ninternational  commodity  prices.  Essential  public  services  used  by  the  most  vulnerable  (basic \ntransport,  health,  and  education  services)  have  been  identified,  and  ADB  grant  resources  will \nhelp maintain budget expenditure in 2011 on the goods and services used in their delivery. The \npolicy actions under the fourth output enhance the voice of the population, including poor people \nand women, regarding policy formulation and implementation. \n \n36. \nThe  policy  reforms  under  the  program  cluster have  indirect  impacts  on  gender  equality \nand  empowerment  of  women.  Given  the  current  gender  gap  in  education  and  health,  the \nincreased  budget  is  expected  to  benefit  more  women.  While  the  policy  reforms  under  the \nprogram  may  make  a  limited  and  indirect  contribution  to  gender  equality  and  women\u2019s \nempowerment, the improved PFM will have indirect benefits for poor people, who rely most on \npublic services as they cannot afford alternative services. The budget increase can be linked to \nwomen\u2019s  improved  access  to  basic  education  services  and  health  services,  particularly \nreproductive health services. The program requires monitoring of women\u2019s improved access to \nhealth and basic education services as indicated in the design and monitoring framework.23 \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nThe  program  is  classified  as  category  C  with  no  significant  adverse  environmental \n\n37. \nimpacts identified. No involuntary resettlement or impacts on indigenous people are expected.  \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n38. \nThe  program  is  designed  in  line  with  the  government\u2019s  2011  budget  and  2010\u20132012 \nmedium-term  fiscal  framework.  The  key  assumptions  underlying  the  program  include  that  (i) \ndomestic  political  and  macroeconomic  stability  is  maintained,  (ii)  the  global  economy  recovers \nfrom the financial crisis, and (iii) the government continues to be committed to improved fiscal \nmanagement and performance. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 1 \nand also described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.24 \n \n\nTable 1: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nPolitical instability weakens fiscal discipline and policy \ncommitment. \n\nThere will be insufficient capacity in government to \nimplement the program. \nThe revenue position of the government deteriorates \nand impedes service delivery. \nExcessive growth in expenditure will crowd out \nessential expenditure, making it difficult to achieve and \ncapitalize on the policy actions of the program. \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nADB will continue policy engagement in the Core Economic \nWorking Group with the government and key development \npartners guided by the post-program monitoring framework. \nTechnical assistance will be provided in a flexible manner \nwhere possible and appropriate. \nMore capacity building elements are expected to be infused \ninto external assistance provided by development partners. \nADB will provide recommendations and assistance on \nexpenditure control and management. \n\n                                                 \n23 Program contribution to poverty reduction and ADB results framework is included in Contribution to the ADB Results \nFramework  and  Summary  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Strategy  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \nAppendix 2). \n\n24 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n39. \nThe  government  and  MOFT  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  program \ncluster  and  subprogram  2  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those \nconcerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the grant documents. \n \n40. \nSpecific  assurances.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  government  and \nMOFT have given the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: (i) \nthe  government  will  (a)  maintain  the  policies  adopted  and  actions  taken  under  subprogram  1 \nand  subprogram  2  prior  to  the  date  of  the  grant  agreement  for  subprogram  2,  as  described  in \nthe  development  policy  letter  and  the  policy  matrix,  for  the  duration  of  the  program  and \nsubsequently;  (b)  promptly  adopt  the  other  policies  and  the  other  actions  as  specified  in  the \ndevelopment  policy  letter  and  the  policy  matrix;  and  (c)  ensure  that  such  policies  and  actions \ncontinue in effect for the duration of the program and subsequently; and (ii) the government and \nthe  program  implementing  agencies  will  ensure  that,  throughout  the  implementation  of \nsubprogram  2,  adequate  budgetary  allocations  of  the  required  counterpart  funds  are  made, \napproved, and released in a timely manner to ensure proper program implementation. \n \n41. \nCondition  for  grant  effectiveness.  The  grant  will  become  effective  after  the \ngovernment  has  satisfactorily  fulfilled  all  conditions  for  the  release  of  the  single  tranche  of \nsubprogram  2.  Adoption  of  the  NDS,  anticipated  by  late  July  or  August  2011,  is  the  only \noutstanding item among these conditions.  \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n42. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  grant  not \nexceeding $5,000,000 to Solomon Islands from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for subprogram \n2 of the Economic Recovery Support Program, on terms and conditions that are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n\n19 July 2011 \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \n\nAchievement of a \nhigher and more \ninclusive path of \neconomic growth \n\nOutcome \n\nInitiation of economic \nrecovery combined \nwith protection of the \nvulnerable members \nof the community and \nthe fiscal position \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines\n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms\n \n\nAssumptions and \nRisks\nAssumptions \n\nNational accounts, \nbudget papers, CBSI \nquarterly reviews and \nannual reports, \nhousehold income and \nexpenditure surveys \n\n \n\nNational accounts, \nbudget papers, CBSI \nquarterly reviews and \nannual reports, medium-\nterm development \nstrategy, health \ninformation system \n(Ministry of Health and \nMedical Services), \nMinistry of Education \nand Human \nDevelopment records, \nIMF Article IV staff \nreports, PEFA \nassessments \n\n \n\n \n\nReal GDP growth \nprogressively raised by \n2012, from close to 0% in \n2009 to a rate higher than \nthe population growth rate \n(latest estimate of \npopulation growth of 2.8% \nper annum) \n\nRelative standard of living \nof the most vulnerable \nmembers (sex \ndisaggregated) of the \ncommunity improved, as \nmeasured by a rising \nexpenditure share of the \npoorest 20% of \nhouseholds between \n2005\u20132006 and the next \nhousehold income survey \n(2005\u20132006 level of 6.9) \n\nReal GDP growth in 2011 \n\nNew national development \nstrategy released in 2011 \n\nAverage antenatal clinic \ncoverage for pregnant \nwomen rates in \nrepresentative rural areas \nin 2011 no lower than the \nlatest 5-year average (as \nreported in administrative \nrecords) \n\nPrimary school enrolment \nrates (sex disaggregated) \nin representative rural \nareas in 2011 no lower \nthan the latest 5-year \naverage (as reported in \nadministrative records) \n\nNo deterioration in 2011 of \nthe \u201cmedium risk of debt \ndistress\u201d assessment from \nthe IMF \n\nOverall improvement by \n2011 against the 2008 \nPEFA assessment \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nGlobal economy \ncontinues recovering \n\nPrivate sector responds \nto improved economic \nconditions \n\nNo major natural \ndisasters \n\n \nRisks \n\nPolitical instability \nweakens fiscal \ndiscipline and policy \ncommitment \n\nHigher  crude  oil  prices \ndamage the economy \n\nAssumptions \nParliamentary and \ncommunity support for \nthe government actions \n\nGovernment agencies \ncommitted to improved \nfiscal management and \nperformance \n\nDevelopment partners \nprovide timely technical \nand budget support \n\nCentral bank maintains \nindependent monetary \nmanagement \n\n \nRisks \n\nRevenue position of \ngovernment \ndeteriorates and \nimpedes service \ndelivery \n\nChange in cabinet \ncomposition slows the \nimplementation of \npolicy actions \n\n \n\n\fPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines\n\n \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms\n \n\nAssumptions and \nRisks \nAssumptions \n\nAdherence to the Honiara \nClub Agreement, including \na continued commitment to \na freeze on borrowing and \nthe issue of sovereign \nguarantees until it is \nsustainable for it to relax \nthe freeze \n\nNational accounts, \nbudget papers, CBSI \nquarterly reviews and \nannual reports, MOFT \nfiscal updates and SOE \nmonitoring reports, \npublic accounts, \ngovernment gazette. \n\nThe role of the monthly \nmonetary management \nmeeting is broadened \nand the meeting takes \non a lead role in the \nprogram \n\nEndorsement by \ngovernment and \nstakeholders of a \nprioritization of activities \nthat targets the needs of \nthe most vulnerable \n\nThe joint government\u2013\ndevelopment partner \nCore Economic Working \nGroup remains active \nand effective \n\n \nRisks \n\nInsufficient suitably \nqualified and \nexperienced personnel \navailable to implement \nthe program \n\n \n\nPolitical interference \ndiverts budget funds \nfrom areas of \ndevelopment priority \n\nExcessive growth in \nexpenditure will crowd \nout essential \nexpenditure, making it \ndifficult to achieve and \ncapitalize on the policy \nactions linked to the \nprogram  \n\n12 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nDesign Summary \nOutputs \n\n1.
