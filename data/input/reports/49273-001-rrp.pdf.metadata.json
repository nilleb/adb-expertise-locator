THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Small  and  Medium-Sized \nEnterprises Line of Credit Project, and (ii) the proposed administration of technical assistance \n(TA) to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Cluster Development and \nSmall and Medium-Sized Enterprise Finance Innovation.1 \n0F\n \n2.  Despite being a source of economic growth and employment, small and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs) often struggle to access bank loans. SME loans are generally riskier and \ncostlier for banks to administer. The project and TA will address this issue by (i) providing a \ncredit line to increase the supply of SME credit through an innovative auction that will allow \nbanks to factor in the higher costs of SME loans; and (ii) the TA increasing the number of \ncreditworthy SMEs by supporting three of Sri Lanka\u2019s most important industry clusters.2 \n1F\n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  SMEs are critical for Sri Lanka\u2019s economic growth. They are responsible for 30% of the \ncountry\u2019s gross domestic product and 35% of employment. SMEs are arguably even more \nimportant for poverty reduction as they are effective at generating employment\u2014at 51%, the \nemployment\u2013population ratio in Sri Lanka is one of the lowest in developing Asia. Moreover, \nwith large corporations almost exclusively based in Colombo, SMEs drive business activity in \nother regions of the country and are key to reducing regional disparities. \n \n4.  Despite their importance, SMEs struggle to access the banking system. A recent survey \nidentified collateral requirements, high interest rates, and unsatisfactory client support among \nthe  constraints.  Because  female  entrepreneurs  generally  lead  smaller  businesses,  their \nchallenges are compounded.3 \n2F\n \n5.  Banks, however, have a reasonable bias for larger enterprises. SME loans are more \nexpensive.  Risks  are  higher  because  of  insufficient  collateral,  shorter  operating  histories, \ninformal recordkeeping, and lack of registration. These higher risks often translate into higher \ncredit losses. Operating expenses are also higher because some of the costs of originating and \nadministrating a loan are fixed regardless of the loan size. Banks cannot always recover these \ncosts through higher pricing. \n \n6.  A simple solution would be to subsidize SME lending. Through a subsidy, banks could \nhave a financial incentive to reach these more difficult borrowers without charging usurious \nrates. But subsidies can distort the market in ways that ultimately undermine financial stability \nand harm the intended beneficiaries. During the 2008\u20132009 global financial crisis, sectors that \nwere benefiting from government subsidies were among the most severely impacted. \n \n7.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is proposing an innovative solution. Instead of \nlending to participating banks at the average deposit rate or some other benchmark, the project \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Clusters are a geographical proximate group of interconnected companies. For example, the Sri Lankan tea cluster \nincludes tea producers, processors, exporters, and other support services. \n3  Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka. 2014. Female Entrepreneurship and the Role of Business Development \nServices in Promoting Small and Medium Women Entrepreneurship in Sri Lanka. Colombo. ", "2 \nwill require participating banks to bid on the funds. Banks can adjust their bids to account for the \nhigher costs of SME lending. In effect, the auction will establish the market price for banks \nborrowing to onlend to underserved SMEs. The auction price is expected to be lower than \nparticipating banks\u2019 normal borrowing costs, and will preserve their financial incentive to lend to \nSMEs. This will also mitigate the risk of poor disbursement, a common challenge among SME \ncredit lines. Moreover, it will promote economic efficiency because banks that establish the most \neffective SME lending programs will be positioned to submit the most competitive bids. \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s  support  for  SMEs  in  Sri  Lanka  is  particularly  timely.  First,  it  is  aligned  with \ngovernment efforts to develop SMEs to create more and better employment opportunities.4 \n3F\nSecond, SMEs\u2019 demand for credit is robust and not fully met. During due diligence, multiple \nbanks commented that their client requirements easily exceed project size.5 Finally, ADB\u2019s \n4F\ninterim  country  partnership  strategy,  2015\u20132016  for  Sri  Lanka  emphasizes  private  sector \ndevelopment, including projects that promote finance sector development.6 This would be the \n5F\nfirst sovereign project in Sri Lanka under the new ADB partnership strategy to address these \npriorities. \n \n9.  Lessons. The project draws from the experience of previous credit lines in Sri Lanka \nand  from  ADB  experience  in  other  developing  member  countries.  The  most  recent  ADB-\nsupported SME development project in Sri Lanka was a $50 million credit line approved in \n2007.7 Although the project is rated successful, it encountered difficulties in disbursing to SMEs \n6F\noutside of Colombo. The current project\u2019s auction mechanism is designed explicitly as a market-\nbased  response  that  will  incentivize  participating  banks  to  reach  these  more  challenging \nborrowers.8 \n7F\n \n10.  More broadly, ADB\u2019s experience is that credit lines have to reach beyond credit supply \nand also address credit demand. Sri Lanka\u2019s institutions are generally favorable in this regard. \nThe country has a credit information bureau, a movable property registry, and a relatively strong \ninsolvency framework.9 To further support credit demand, the attached TA will include support \n8F\nfor  business  development  services  and  financial  literacy  training,  which  are  particularly \nimportant in extending financial services to borrowers outside the formal system. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  impact  will  be  increased  employment  opportunities  for  SMEs  aligned  with \ngovernment policy (footnote 4). The outcome will be strengthened SMEs\u2019 access to finance. \n \n                                                 \n4  Government of Sri Lanka. 2015.

Outputs \n12.  The project\u2019s output will be increased financing to SMEs through formal intermediaries. \nThe TA outputs will be (i) innovative SME financing schemes, (ii) enhanced capacity of SMEs in \ntargeted  clusters  to  access  financial  services,  and  (iii)  strengthened  international \ncompetitiveness  of  the  information  and  communication  technology  and  business  process \noutsourcing (ICT\u2013BPO) cluster. \n \n13.  The outputs support the outcome on two levels. From the supply side, the credit line\u2014\ndeployed through the auction mechanism\u2014and research into SME credit guarantee schemes \nwill make more financing available to SMEs that banks would otherwise not find creditworthy. \nFrom the demand side, the attached TA will help female entrepreneurs develop their businesses \nand access formal financing. It will provide targeted support to develop ICT\u2013BPO, one of Sri \nLanka\u2019s most promising export-generating clusters. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n14.  The project is estimated to cost $117.7 million (Table 1).10 \n9F\n \nTable 1: Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank   100.0  85.0 \nOrdinary capital resources (loan)  100.0  85.0 \nSME contribution  17.7a 15.0 \nTotal  117.7  100.0 \nSMEs = small and medium-sized enterprises. \na  SMEs will contribute equity to the project at a level consistent with market norms. Based on \ndiscussions with participating banks, the average contribution is estimated at 15%. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n15.  With 3 years as the estimated duration of an SME loan, banks can reuse the funds an \naverage of 3.3 times during the 10-year borrowing period. ADB\u2019s $100 million is expected to \nsupport $392 million of SME subprojects.11 \n10F\n \n16.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $100  million  from  ADB's  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB's  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the \nloan and project agreements. The loan will be disbursed in eight tranches of approximately \n$12.5 million each. Each tranche will have a 10-year term and a disbursement-linked bullet \n                                                 \n10  Every $1 of ADB investment is expected to catalyze an average of $0.177 of private sector investment on the \nassumption that the banks will require SMEs to fund on average 15% of a subproject\u2019s cost with equity. Banks will \nhave discretion to determine the SMEs\u2019 equity contributions as per market norms and the nature of the credit risk. \nAs a reference, subborrower equity would typically range from 33% to 50% of the project cost for uncollateralized \ncommercial loans, 20% to 30% for commercial real estate loans, and less than 10% for working capital loans. \nAlthough not part of the banks\u2019 disbursements to SMEs, ADB will require the banks to hold $0.10 of capital for each \n$1 they lend under the project to SMEs. This equity capital, along with loan loss reserves, are the first defenses \nagainst any SME payment defaults and ensure that the banks are incentivized to originate creditworthy SME \nsubloans. \n11  Estimated loan duration based on interviews of banks during fact finding. ($100 million ADB funding + $17.7 million \nestimated average SME equity contribution) x (10 years) / (3-year estimated average loan duration) = $392 million. \n ", "4 \nrepayment. Based on the foregoing, the average loan maturity is 12.25 years, and there is no \nmaturity premium payable to ADB. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The ADB loan to the government will be in US dollars. The government will relend the \nlocal currency equivalent to participating banks in amounts and at interest rates determined \nthrough eight semiannual auctions. At each auction, $12.5 million equivalent will be available.12 \n11F\nThe resulting loans to participating banks will have 10-year tenors and bullet repayments; the \ngovernment will bear the foreign exchange risk.13 The auction mechanism is described in the \n12F\nproject administration manual (PAM); an independent third party in consultation with ADB and \nthe government will develop more detailed operating procedures.14 \n13F\n \n18.  The independent third party will administer the auction on behalf of the Ministry of \nFinance.15 ADB  will  oversee  the  independent  third  party  in  consultation  with  a  steering \n14F\ncommittee,  with  members  including  the  secretary  to  the  Treasury  (chair),  Department  of \nDevelopment Finance, ADB, Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Export Development Board, Federation \nof Chambers of Commerce, and others who may be considered appropriate by the government. \n19.  In winning an auctioned loan, participating banks have discretion to establish the rate, \ntenor, and other terms of onlending.16 However, they must commit to reaching SMEs that \n15F\ncurrently struggle to access formal finance. Banks will not be allowed to participate in any \nsubsequent auctions until they have achieved SME onlending targets. Specifically, \n(i)  10%  of  the  number  of  subloans  is  to  first-time  borrowers  from  a  licensed \ncommercial or specialized bank; \n(ii)  5% of the number of subloans is to SMEs led by women;17 and \n16F\n(iii)  50% of the amount of subloans is lent cumulatively to targeted SMEs, which \ninclude SMEs that are (a) located outside of Colombo District, (b) borrowing for \nworking capital, (c) led by women, or (d) first-time borrowers from a licensed \ncommercial or specialized bank. \n \n20.  Public and private domestic banks in good standing with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka \nare eligible. The eligibility criteria includes (i) central bank confirmation that the applicant is in \ngood regulatory standing (including corporate governance, reputation, integrity, and anti-money-\nlaundering procedures), (ii) compliance with the central bank\u2019s regulatory capital norms, and  \n                                                 \n12 For example, if institution X bids $3 million at 10%, institution Y $8 million at 8%, and institution Z $12 million at 6%, \nthen X would receive $3 million at 10%, Y $8 million at 8%, and Z $1.5 million at 6%. \n13 The government will receive the difference between its borrowing rate (set in dollars) and the auction rate (set in \nSri Lanka rupees) as compensation for the foreign exchange risk with a minimum foreign exchange charge of 1%. \n14 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The eligibility criteria for \nparticipating financial institutions, and criteria for subborrowers and subloans are attached to the PAM. \n15 ADB will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) in recruiting the independent \nthird party, whose work will be funded under the attached TA. \n16 Eligible subborrowers must meet the government\u2019s SME definition of annual turnover of less than SLRs750 million, \nfewer than 300 employees if a manufacturer, or fewer than 200 employees if in the service sector. Other \nrequirements are that the SME is economically and financially viable, not a related party to the participating bank, \nand not borrowing for the purpose of a \u201cthree-wheeler\u201d business. Eligible subloans will be fully funded via the ADB \nproject but must be SLRs50 million or less. No more than 50% of funds can be used as subloans for working \ncapital. \n17 Defined as led by a woman, at least 51% of the enterprise ownership is controlled by women, at least 60% of \nsenior managers are women, or at least 50% of board members are women. \n ", "5 \n(iii) tangible equity of at least SLRs1 billion.18 Based on these criteria as well as ADB\u2019s own due \n17F\ndiligence on the banks\u2019 financial strength, financial management, integrity, and governance,  \n10 banks were invited to participate.19 \n18F\n \n21.  After the first two semiannual auctions, ADB and the steering committee will review the \nauction\u2019s effectiveness and may agree to make modifications. In the unlikely event that more \nfundamental changes are required, ADB in consultation with the steering committee may elect \nto revert to a conventional first-come, first-serve distribution system with the borrowing rate for \nparticipating banks fixed at Sri Lanka\u2019s average weighted deposit rate. \n \n22.  Additional implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 2 and described in \ndetail in the PAM. \n \nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  March 2016\u2013May 2020 \nEstimated completion date  31 May 2020 \nLoan closing date  30 November 2020 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Steering committee, including the secretary to the Treasury \n(chair), Department of Development Finance, ADB, Central \nBank of Sri Lanka, Export Development Board, Federation of \nChambers of Commerce, and others considered appropriate by \nthe government \n(ii) Executing agency  Ministry of Finance \n(iii) Implementing agency  Department of Development Finance \n(iv) Implementation unit  Project management unit, under the leadership of the director \ngeneral, Department of Development Finance \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to \ntime) and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the \ngovernment and ADB. \nProcurement  Loan funds will be used as described in ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) for loans to \nfinancial intermediaries (para. 3.12). \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n23.  The attached TA will support three of the outputs.20 It will fund the administration of the \n19F\nauction and will study the introduction of an SME credit guarantee scheme to Sri Lanka (output \n2).21 The TA will be implemented from February 2016 to May 2020. \n20F\n                                                 \n18 Sri Lanka is in the process of implementing Basel III; the exact capital requirements will change during the program \nas implementation progresses.  \n19 Bank of Ceylon, Commercial Bank, DFCC Bank, Hatton National Bank, National Development Bank, Nations Trust \nBank, People\u2019s Bank, Regional Development Bank, Sampath Bank, and Seylan Bank. Note that the participation of \ntwo of these banks is contingent on their compliance with the criteria that their audited net nonperforming loan ratio \nbe less than or equal to 5%. ADB and the steering committee may invite additional banks or nonbank financial \ninstitutions, which will then be subject to the same criteria and due diligence. \n ", "6 \n \n24.  The government requested that the attached TA focus on the ICT\u2013BPO, fruits and \nvegetables, and rubber clusters, which have positive potential to increase Sri Lanka\u2019s exports. \nThe TA will support business development services and financial literacy training for female \nentrepreneurs in all three clusters (output 3) and branding of and the promotion of female \nparticipation in the ICT\u2013BPO cluster (output 4). The focus on ICT\u2013BPO is particularly timely as \nthis  is  an  opportunity  to  attract  international  clients  looking  for  a  secondary  location  to \ncomplement their ICT\u2013BPO operations in India. \n \n25.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.1 million, of which $2.0 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The Ministry of \nFinance will be the executing agency. The Ministry of Finance\u2019s Department of Development \nFinance will be the implementing agency for the TA component supporting output 2. The Export \nDevelopment Board will be the implementing agency for the TA component supporting outputs 3 \nand 4. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of office accommodation, \nremuneration of the project management unit and other staff, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n26.  The project is economically and financially viable. Economically, the gains are likely to \ncome from the project\u2019s requirement to lend to SMEs that cannot access the banking system. \nProviding SMEs with better access to finance has a multiplier effect because SMEs can borrow \nto  (i)  invest  in  more  productive  technologies,  and  (ii)  enlarge  their  businesses  to  achieve \neconomies of scale. These gains are especially significant in economies, such as Sri Lanka\u2019s, \nwhere unmet SME credit demand is significant.22 \n21F\n \n27.  Financially, participating banks will assess the creditworthiness of each SME subloan \nand will have discretion to charge loan premiums that are sufficient to cover the risks and \nadministration  of  the  subloan.  Additionally,  ADB  has  reviewed  the  soundness  of  each \nparticipating bank and concluded that they have the financial track record to make these credit \ndecisions and the financial strength to repay funds borrowed via the project. \n \nB.  Governance \n28.  ADB\u2019s financial management and integrity due diligence on each participating bank \nindicates  moderate  risk.  The  program\u2019s  design  includes  several  governance  mechanisms, \nincluding  (i)  steering  committee  oversight,  (ii)  independent  third-party  administration,  \n(iii) transparent disclosure of auction results to eliminate real or perceived conflicts of interest, \nand (iv) other measures detailed in the PAM. With these measures in place, the overall financial \nmanagement arrangements are considered adequate. \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM. \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \n20 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Based on the availability of additional TA resources, the scope of the output may be expanded to also study the \nintroduction of an SME venture capital fund. \n22 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nC.  Poverty and Social \n30.  Poverty impact. Although Sri Lanka has made notable progress in reducing poverty, \nregional imbalances remain. SMEs struggle to borrow for working capital because they often \nlack real estate or financial assets that banks require as collateral. In response, the project will \nprimarily target SMEs that have less access to financial resources but have a key role in \nreducing income and social imbalances. Specifically, these SMEs are (i) located outside of \nColombo District, (ii) borrowing for working capital without pledging financial assets or real \nestate,  (iii)  led  by  women,  and  (iv)  first-time  borrowers  from  a  licensed  commercial  or \nspecialized  bank.  The  expected  impacts  of  the  project  include  employment  creation  and \nincreased income, especially among the targeted SMEs. \n \n31.  Gender and social dimensions. Sri Lanka\u2019s low female labor participation rate of 39% \nsuggests a large pool of untapped human resources for national economic development. One \nmeasure to address this is to support women\u2019s greater involvement in SMEs. Thus, the project \nis categorized as effective gender mainstreaming because of its large potential to contribute to \nwomen\u2019s  empowerment  and  gender  equity.  In  view  of  this,  the  project  requires  5%  of \nsubborrowers to be SMEs led by women. Furthermore, the attached TA aims to strengthen \nfemale entrepreneurship and capacity in three clusters (ICT\u2013BPO, fruits and vegetables, and \nrubber), as well as support the promotion of careers in ICT\u2013BPO among female students and \ngraduates. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n32.  The project category for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples \nis financial intermediary, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The \nproject complies with ADB\u2019s information disclosure and consultation requirements. Subproject \nselection criteria will ensure that participating banks finance only SME subprojects with no \ninvoluntary  resettlement  or  indigenous  peoples  impacts  (category  C).  For  environment, \nparticipating  banks  can  decide  to  (i)  exclude  all  subprojects  with  environmental  impacts \n(categories A and B) or (ii) exclude subprojects with significant impacts (category A) but include \nsubprojects with impacts that are not significant (category B). ADB will require participating \nbanks  electing  for  the  latter  to  maintain,  as  part  of  their  overall  management  system,  an \nenvironmental management system that complies with ADB requirements and national laws.23 \n22F\n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n33.  The project carries an overall medium risk. Its benefits are expected to outweigh its \ncosts. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.24  \n23F\n   \n                                                 \n23 ADB must approve the environmental management system of any participating bank that would like to lend to \nsubprojects that are category B for environment. If ADB has not approved a participating bank\u2019s environmental \nmanagement system at project inception, the Public Management, Financial Sector and Trade Division, in \nconsultation with safeguard specialists, may subsequently do so after the completion of satisfactory due diligence. \nFor further details, see the Environmental Management System Framework (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n24 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n \nTable 3: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nParticipating banks could collude  The attached TA will provide a third party to administer the \nin the auctions.  auction.
