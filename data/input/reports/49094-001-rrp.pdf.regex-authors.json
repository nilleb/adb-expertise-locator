THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Railway Rolling Stock Project.1 \n \n2.  The proposed project will improve railway transport capacity in Bangladesh on key \ncorridors\u2014such as the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong and Dhaka\u2013Khulna main line corridors\u2014by financing \nadditional rolling stock (locomotives, passenger carriages, and related equipment). The new \nrolling stock will enable Bangladesh Railway to satisfy steadily growing demand and increase its \nmarket share. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Historically,  the  railway  enjoyed  a  monopoly  as  a  carrier  and  carried  most  of  the \ncountry\u2019s commodities and passengers. With the gradual emergence of road transport, the \nrailway began losing market share, which declined from 30% in 1975 to a mere 4% in 2005 for \nboth passenger and freight transport. Despite a growing demand for transport, Bangladesh \nRailway\u2019s  market  share  in  passenger  and  freight  transport  has  declined  due  to  a  lack  of \ninvestment in infrastructure and rolling stock (its transport capacity is the same as it was in \n1975). Railway travel in Bangladesh is safer, more energy-efficient and reliable, and has a lower \nenvironmental impact than other modes of transport. Railway transport is also considered more \ncomfortable than long-distance buses. Intercity trains operated by Bangladesh Railway are very \npopular. Occupancy is very high, especially in the east zone (98%); intercity trains in the \nDhaka\u2013Chittagong  corridor  are  usually  sold  out.  About  40%  of  Bangladesh  Railway\u2019s \npassengers travel by intercity trains, which account for more than 75% of passenger revenue. \nThe high demand for intercity service in the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong corridors cannot be fully met and \nno additional trains can be scheduled to tap into the lucrative market for Bangladesh Railway \ndue to insufficient line capacity and rolling stock availability. \n \n4.  The  government\u2019s  Sixth  Five-Year  Plan  (2011\u20132015)  includes  the  improvement  of \nrailways as energy efficient multimodal transport systems to reduce carbon emissions.2 The \nRailway Sector Master Plan towards 2030, approved in 2013, noted the railway sector must \nsignificantly improve its efficiency and service quality, and establish better connectivity in order \nto survive as a viable mode of transport.3 The government\u2019s strategy is to increase Bangladesh \nRailway\u2019s market share from 4% to 15% in freight transport, from 10% to 15% in container \ntransport between Dhaka and Chittagong Port, and from 4% to 10% in passenger transport. The \nrailway will focus on lucrative market segments and provide (i) long-distance passenger traffic \nvia intercity trains, (ii) long-haul freight traffic along selected corridors, and (iii) container traffic \n(mainly between Dhaka and Chittagong Port). To achieve this, the government is (i) augmenting \nline capacity along main corridors; (ii) procuring modern locomotives, passenger carriages, and \nfreight  wagons;  and  (iii)  reforming  Bangladesh  Railway,  introducing  a  modern  financial \nmanagement  system,  improving  operation  and  maintenance,  and  establishing  a  human \nresource management system. \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission, Ministry of Planning. 2011.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is supporting the government\u2019s sector strategy \nthrough (i) investments in infrastructure development for the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong and Dhaka\u2013\nKhulna main railway corridors in Bangladesh through the Railway Sector Investment Program,4 \n(ii) the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Railway Connectivity: Akhaura\u2013Laksam \nDouble Track Project,5 and (iii) sector reforms. The Japan International Cooperation Agency \nfinanced upgrading of the Laksam\u2013Chinki Astana section of the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong corridor, \nprocurement of 11 locomotives, modernization of a rolling stock workshop in Chittagong, and \nupgrading of the Chittagong Station Yard. The upgraded infrastructure financed by the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency was completed in 2015, and the projects financed by ADB will \nbe completed in 2016. \n \n6.  Bangladesh Railway has a shortage of modern and reliable rolling stock: of the fleet of \n282 locomotives and 1,476 passenger carriages, 76 locomotives and 651 passenger carriages \nhave passed their economic life of 35 years and need to be replaced. Procurement of 70 \nlocomotives and 270 passenger carriages is ongoing; together with 20 multiple units recently \ncommissioned, this will enable Bangladesh Railway to replace the majority of the oldest and \nleast-efficient rolling stock. \n \n7.  The project will finance approximately 264 passenger carriages, 10 locomotives, and \nadditional state-of-the-art maintenance equipment, which will support the maintenance of new \nand existing rolling stock and provide training facilities for train drivers, who will operate the \nadditional trains.6  The  capacity of  Bangladesh  Railway to maintain  rolling  stock  was \nstrengthened by the updating of several of its operation manuals as part of the Bangladesh \nRailway Reform Project (footnote 4); the rolling stock will be maintained in accordance with \nthese manuals. \n \n8.  The project is part of ADB\u2019s railway sector development strategy to support a series of \ninvestment projects in infrastructure, railway reform, and institutional capacity development to \nimprove overall transport capacity. Adding rolling stock to Bangladesh Railway\u2019s fleet will enable \nit to use its enhanced infrastructure capacity by running additional passenger trains, and thereby \nsatisfy the  increasing  demand for  trips  by train. The  project  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership strategy for Bangladesh, 2011\u20132015,7 which aims to reduce high transport and \nlogistical costs in support of sustainable and inclusive economic growth by connecting all parts \nof the country with national and regional markets. \n \n9.  The project is processed as a stand-alone project loan embedded into ADB\u2019s railway \nsector development strategy and ongoing projects, as the implementation period is comparably \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2006.

The  project  design  incorporates  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  previous  interventions  in  the \nBangladesh  railway  sector.  To  avoid  startup  delays,  project  preparation  began  early,  in \nconjunction with the existing project implementation unit (PIU), which is well experienced in ADB \nproject implementation and procurement processes; support from staff consultants is being \nprovided to facilitate procurement and government internal approvals, which will be completed \nbefore loan approval. Project readiness is high\u2014bid document preparation is well advanced and \nthe overall project design focuses on the procurement of rolling stock and equipment as part of \nADB\u2019s  railway  sector  strategy,  and  supplements  infrastructure  investments,  capacity \ndevelopment, and reform activities supported by other projects. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be efficient and safe railway transport in Bangladesh, aligned with the \nSixth Five-Year Plan (2011\u20132015).8 The outcome will be increased railway transport capacity in \nthe main line network of Bangladesh Railway. \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  The project has two outputs. Output 1 comprises the procurement and commissioning of \nnew rolling stock consisting of approximately 264 passenger carriages and 10 diesel electric \nlocomotives for Bangladesh Railway's meter gauge main line network. Output 2 comprises the \nprocurement  and  commissioning  of  new  equipment  consisting  of  approximately  four  relief \ncranes, two train washing plants, and one simulator for loco-master training. \n \nD.

The  government  of  Bangladesh  has  requested  a  loan  of  $200  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources to  help finance  the project. The  loan  will  have  a  25-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, straight-line repayment method, an annual interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year  (the  interest  and  other  charges  during \nconstruction to be capitalized in the loan), and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft loan agreement.

Bangladesh Railway will be the executing agency for the project. Under ADB\u2019s ongoing \nRailway  Sector  Investment  Program  (footnote 4),  an  investment  PIU was  established  with \nexperienced staff; two specialized PIUs will be established to implement this project, each \nheaded by a project director. Procurement for contracts to be financed under the project will be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to \n                                                \n9  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \ntime). All contracts for goods and services will be procured using international competitive \nbidding procedures. ADB standard bidding documents with post qualification under the single-\nstage,  two-envelope  system  will  be  adopted.  Advance  procurement  action  for  goods  and \nservices is proposed to enhance project readiness and ensure faster disbursement of the loan. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n18.  The project will finance additional railway rolling stock in line with international design \nstandards  and  Bangladesh  Railway\u2019s  updated  technical  specifications;  all rolling stock  and \nequipment procured under this project is based on the existing design standards of Bangladesh \nRailway.  As  a  result,  Bangladesh  Railway  staff  are  well  familiar  with  the  materials  and \nconstruction methods used. Where modern materials are used, the technical requirements \ninclude  ample  time  and  resources  to  properly  train  and  familiarize  staff  with  the  new \ntechnologies. As-built documentation will be provided by the contractor for all components and \nequipment procured under the project to ensure that operation and maintenance will be carried \nout as specified by the manufacturers. \n \n19.  Bangladesh Railway has recruited a team of national and international experts to inspect \nthe  passenger  carriages,  locomotives,  relief  cranes,  washing  plants,  and  simulator  to  be \nprocured under this loan at the manufacturer\u2019s premises before shipment to Bangladesh. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n20.  Economic and financial analyses have been undertaken and concluded the project\u2019s \nlending decision is based more on the economic than the financial viability, as detailed in the \neconomic and financial analysis.10 \n21.  The project economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated at 26.4%. The economic \nanalysis compares the benefits and costs of with- and without-project scenarios. The main \nbenefits are a reduction in the generalized cost and savings in bus operating costs due to \ndecongestion on the roads caused by passengers shifting from bus to rail transport , and time \nsavings. The sensitivity analysis showed the project would remain economically viable in the \nevents of (i) a 10.0% increase in capital cost, (ii) a 10.0% reduction in benefits, and (iii) a 1-year \ndelay in project commencement. The results show the quantified economic benefits are robust; \nthe project has an EIRR well above 12.0% in all sensitivity tests. In the unlikely event that a  \n10.0% increase in capital cost and a 10.0% reduction in benefits occurred together, the EIRR \nremains above the 12.0% benchmark. \n \n22.  A financial analysis has been undertaken to assess the financial viability of the project, \nusing a similar approach to that employed for the economic analysis. As a public utility service \nprovider, the government subsidizes Bangladesh Railway to cover its operating expenses. The \nfinancial  analysis  considered  with-subsidy  and  without-subsidy  scenarios.  The  with-subsidy \nfinancial internal rate of return is about 5.2%, while the without-subsidy financial internal rate of \nreturn is about \u20133.7%. The annual incremental recurrent cost associated with the project is \nestimated  to  be  1.7%  of  the  overall  budget  of  the  Ministry  of  Railways  in  FY2014.  The \ngovernment is seeking to establish and implement a new tariff scheme, which would contribute \n                                                \n10 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nto reducing Bangladesh Railway\u2019s subsidy level. It is reasonable to expect that a sufficient \nfinancial sustainability of both the project and Bangladesh Railway will be maintained.11 \n \nC.  Governance \n23.  Financial  management.  A  financial  management  assessment  concluded  that \nBangladesh  Railway  has  adequate  capacity  to  undertake  financial  management  of  ADB-\nfinanced projects. Bangladesh Railway has prior and ongoing experience in implementing ADB \nprojects funded under the ADB Railway Sector Investment Program. Bangladesh Railway has \nknowledge of project financial accounting methods and ADB disbursement procedures, and \ntheir staff have participated in workshops on financial management good practice conducted by \nADB. Bangladesh Railway\u2019s capacity is being further strengthened through implementation of a \nnew accounting and financial management system by the Bangladesh Railway Reform Project \n(footnote 4). The overall financial management capacity is adequate but, given the country risk \nrating, the project risk is considered moderate. \n \n24.  Procurement and anticorruption. Procurement will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  ADB  will  review  documents  and  submissions  related  to \nprocurement at all major milestones prior to proceeding with the procurement process. The \nprocurement rules for the selection of contractors required by international financial institutions \nsuch  as  ADB  are  considered  sufficiently  robust  to  deter  corruption.  National  procurement \nregulations have improved through the Public Procurement Act, 2006, and through related \nPublic Procurement Rules (2008), with subsequent amendments and the establishment of a \nCentral  Procurement  Technical  Unit  under  the  Implementation  Monitoring  and  Evaluation \nDivision of the Ministry of Planning. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas explained to and discussed with the government and Bangladesh Railway. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration \nmanual (footnote 9). In October 2012, a National Integrity Strategy (NIS) was approved and a \nNational Integrity Advisory Committee formed, chaired by the Prime Minister, to oversee the \nanticorruption  activities  and  implement  the  strategy.  The  NIS  includes  a  road  map  for \nstrengthening both the state and non-state accountability institutions to fight corruption and \nimprove governance. Under the NIS, all line ministries and key watchdog institutions have \nformed  ethics  committees  and  appointed  focal  points  to  implement  corruption-prevention \nprograms and actions. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n25.  Poverty and social. Data from 2010 indicates 17.6% of the population lives below the \npoverty line.12 The poverty incidence in the country is high, although the national poverty level \ndeclined  by  8.5%  during  2005\u20132010  (an  average  of  1.7  percentage  points  per  year). \nBangladesh Railway is one of the principal modes of transportation in the country due to its low \nfares,  safety,  and  punctuality  compared  with  other  transport  modes.  The  new  passenger \ncarriages procured under the project will provide safer, more comfortable, and faster passenger \ntransport in all ticketed classes. Wheelchair access will be included on at least one carriage per \nrake, promoting comfort and social inclusion. The potential long-term socioeconomic benefits of \nnew  carriages  include  development  of  industrial  and  micro  and  small  and  medium-sized \n                                                \n11 The tariff reform and other efficiency improvement initiatives are supported by the Bangladesh Railway Reform \nProject (footnote 4). \n12 Ministry of Planning, Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. 2010.

Dhaka. \n ", "7 \nenterprises along the railways; improved access to employment opportunities, and educational \nand health care facilities; and decreased travel time and cost. \n \n26.  Gender, HIV/AIDS, and trafficking. Railways are considered one of the most reliable, \ncomfortable, and safest modes of land transportation, and women passengers are important \nrailway users who will benefit from the project. Rail services allow women passengers to access \neducational and health facilities, and transport their products at a reasonable cost. Although \ngender is not a specific focus of Ministry of Railway documents (e.g., the National Rail Transport \nPolicy,  Citizen  Charters,  and  Railway  Master  Plan),  the  ministry  has  undertaken  steps  to \npromote the comfort and safety of female passengers.13 Modern services for women\u2014such as \nseparate toilets, ticket counters, waiting rooms, and prayer rooms\u2014have been installed in major \nstations  to make rail  transportation more  attractive  to  and  comfortable for  women,  and  to \nencourage them to travel alone. The project does not offer opportunities to address gender-\ninclusive designs of public spaces such as station buildings, as it supports only procurement of \nrolling stock. However, the passenger carriages will include unisex-type toilets that allow use by \nboth females and males. The project is not anticipated to contribute to an increase in the \nincidence of HIV/AIDS or trafficking, as it only involves the procurement of passenger carriages. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n27.  The project is limited to the procurement of rolling stock and equipment that will operate \non existing railway lines. According to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is \nclassified as category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples \nimpacts.  The  review  of  environmental  impacts  indicates  that  there  will  be  no  adverse \nenvironmental impacts during project implementation. During project operation, there will be a \nnet environmental benefit through reductions in carbon dioxide emission due to a modal shift of \npassengers from road to rail, and the use of more efficient locomotives. Recommendations for \nproper solid and liquid waste management during project operations have been provided. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n28.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk management plan.14 The integrated benefits are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nProject  The start-up delay has been substantially reduced (by 3 years) compared with previous \nimplementation  railway projects in Bangladesh, as the design is complete and bid documents are being \ndelay  finalized. Bidding will start soon and contracts are targeted to be awarded within 1 year \nafter loan approval. Progress of project implementation will be closely monitored by the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). \nDelay in  ADB will finance all foreign exchange-related project costs, thereby reducing the \nreleasing  government\u2019s share of the project cost. The government will finance local taxes and \ncounterpart  duties related to the procurement, and government internal approvals for the \nfunds  counterpart funding will be obtained before loan approval. This will significantly reduce \nthe risk of delays in delivery and commissioning of the rolling stock and goods to be \nprocured under the proposed loan. \n                                                \n13 Ministry of Finance, Finance Division. 2015.
