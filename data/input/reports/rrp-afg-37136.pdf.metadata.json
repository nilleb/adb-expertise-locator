In  addition  to  the  lack  of \nmaintenance, the deterioration was further accelerated by the \nheavy  damage  inflicted  by  prolonged  civil  strife  and  military \noperations. Afghanistan relies significantly on the civil aviation \nsector  for  keeping  most  of  its  remote  communities  within \nreach  of  much  needed  humanitarian  aid  and  basic  public \nservices.  Rehabilitating  and  strengthening  the  civil  aviation \nsector is crucial for extending the reach of the Government in \nKabul,  thereby  facilitating  stabilization  and  integration  of  the \ncountry.  Rehabilitation  of  the  civil  aviation  infrastructure  is  a \nprerequisite  for  private  sector  service  providers  to  provide \nefficient  and  affordable  means  of  transport  to  most  of  the \npopulation  living  in  remote  rural  provinces.  The  rehabilitation \nof  the  airports  will  also  help  create  employment,  generate \nincome  at  the  household  level,  improve  safety,  improve  the \nspread  of  medical  facilities,  help  reconcile  different  ethnic \ngroups,  and  unify  the  country  politically.  To  the  extent \npossible,  the  Project  will  use  labor-intensive  construction \nmethods  to  provide  badly  needed  employment  and  income \ngeneration  opportunities.  It  will  contribute  to  social  stability \nand  poverty  reduction  by  engaging  those  internally  displaced \nbecause of the war and civil unrest. Thus this investment will \ncontribute significantly to improving the overall socioeconomic \nsituation and mitigating the pervasive poverty.  \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nto \n\ntourists, \n\nincluding \n\ninternational  standards; \n\nIn  the  civil  aviation  sector,  the  Government\u2019s  goal  is  to \nrehabilitate  and  improve  airports  and  air  transport,  together \nwith  tourism  services.  This  will  bring  remote  areas  into  the \nmainstream  economy  and  improve  linkages  with  and  faster \ntravel to and from the rest of the world and within the country \nbetween  major  cities  and  towns.  It  will  also  facilitate  the \nmovement  of  people, \nfor  whom \nAfghanistan\u2019s  natural  and  historical  sites  should  become  an \nincreasingly  attractive  destination,  and  increase  trade  in  low-\nvolume, high-value goods. With this sectoral goal in place, the \nGovernment\u2019s key priorities for investment in civil aviation are \n(i)  upgrading  Kabul  International  Airport  to  a  fully  fledged \ninternational  airport  that  meets  International  Civil  Aviation \nOrganization  standards;  (ii)  upgrading  Herat,  Mazar-e-Sharif, \nand  Jalalabad  airports \n(iii) \nupgrading  15  other  major  domestic  airports;  (iv)  establishing \nan  appropriate  air  traffic  management  system  that  meets \ninternational  standards;  (v)  constructing  hangars  and  parking \nbays; and (vi) building training and other related facilities.  \n \nTo  support  the  achievement  of  the  Government\u2019s  goal  in  the \ncivil  aviation  sector,  aid  agencies  coordinated  their  efforts  to \navoid  a  duplication  of  assistance  and  agreed  that  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank \nfor \nrehabilitating  domestic  and  regional  airports  while  the  World \nBank  and  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  will \nsupport \nInternational  Airport. \nAccordingly, ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program Update for \nAfghanistan (2003\u20132005) indicated that ADB assistance in the \ncivil aviation sector would be directed toward the rehabilitation \nof  important  regional  airports  to  promote  the  integration  of \nremote  regions  and  facilitate  more  rapid  economic  growth  in \nthose  areas.  The  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  for \nAfghanistan  (2004\u20132006) \nthe  Regional  Airports \nRehabilitation Project Phase 1 for 2004 in the amount of $30 \nmillion and the Regional Airports Rehabilitation Project Phase \n2 for 2006 in the amount of $40 million.  \n\n(ADB)  will  provide  assistance \n\nthe  upgrading  of  Kabul \n\nincludes \n\nThe  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  help  the  Government \nreconstruct  and  rehabilitate  the  country  by  rehabilitating \nregional airports damaged during two decades of conflict and \nneglect.  \n\nThe total project cost is estimated at $32.1 million equivalent, \nincluding  physical  contingencies  and  interest  charges  during \nconstruction. The foreign exchange cost is estimated at $23.7 \nmillion,  representing  about  74%  of  total  costs.  The  local \ncurrency cost is estimated at $8.4 million equivalent, or about \n26% of total costs.  \n\n \nObjective \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \n \n\n\fFinancing Plan \n\n  ($ million) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project  \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\nv\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        \n\n \nSource \nADB-ADF  \nGovernment \nUNOPS \nTotal \n\n \nForeign \nExchange\n23.7 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n23.7 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n6.3 \n0.1 \n2.0 \n8.4 \n\nTotal \nCost \n30.0 \n0.1 \n2.0 \n32.1 \n\n \n% \n93.5 \n0.3 \n6.2 \n100.0 \n\n   ADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund, UNOPS \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n= United Nations Office of Project Services. \nSource: ADB staff. \n \nThe  United  Nations  Office  of  Project  Services  will  provide \ncofinancing on a parallel basis. \n \nA  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR20,370,000.  \n($30 million equivalent) will be provided.

The  PIU  will  be \nimplementation  of  the  Project,  including  the  completion  of \ntraining  programs  and  provision  of  assistance \nto \npostconstruction operations. The PIU will consist of a team of \nproject  management  consultants  who  will  undertake  key \nproject management functions and supervise and train MCAT \nstaff  assigned  to  the  unit.  A  project  steering  committee, \nchaired by the minister of MCAT and consisting of the deputy \nminister of the Ministry of Finance and the deputy minister of \nMCAT, will be established to provide the overall guidance and \noversight required for smooth implementation of the Project.  \n\nThe  procurement  of  goods,  services,  and  civil  works  to  be \nfinanced  under  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Given the emergency \nnature  of  the  Project,  the  Government  requested  flexible \napplication  of  such  guidelines,  including  a  shorter  bidding \nperiod  for  international  procurement  and  no  prequalification \nexercise.  The  Government  Procurement  Unit  of  Afghanistan \n(ARDS)  will \nReconstruction  and  Development  Services \nundertake  all \nthe \ninternational  procurement, \nrecruitment  of  project  management  consultants.  MCAT  will \n\nincluding \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits  \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nexecute  and  administer  the  contracts  in  close  coordination \nwith the Procurement Unit of ARDS.  \n\nConsulting services will be required to help MCAT implement \nthe Project. The consulting services will involve (i) carrying out \noverall project management as part of the work of the PIU, (ii) \nproviding  assistance  with  the  procurement  of  civil  works,  (iii) \nsupervising the construction and installation of equipment, (iv) \ntesting  and  certifying  completed  works,  (v)  implementing  and \nsupervising  the  training  component,  (vi)  providing  assistance \nfor  institutional  capacity  building  in  MCAT,  (vii)  providing \nassistance  for  designing  an  airport  accounting  system,  (viii) \nproviding  assistance  with  postconstruction  operations  and \nproviding  on-the-job \nfor  airport  operations  and \nmaintenance  staff,  and  (ix)  monitoring  benefits  and  carrying \nout evaluation. The consultants will be selected and appointed \nby  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  using  full \ntechnical  proposals  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \nthe Use of Consultants and arrangements satisfactory to ADB \nfor engaging domestic consultants.  \n\ntraining \n\nThe  primary  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  consist  of  (i)  \nbenefits  to  operators  (direct  wear  and  tear,  fuel  savings,  and \nsafety  benefits);  (ii)  benefits  to  passengers  (direct  time \nsavings  and  safety  benefits);  (iii)  benefits  to  the  Government \n(direct  revenue  benefits);  and  (iv)  benefits  to  regional  and \nlocal  communities  (indirect \ntourist  arrival  benefits).  The \nbenefits to operators are substantial in terms of improvements \nto  aircraft  productivity  resulting  from  reduced  downtime  for \nmaintenance;  elimination  of  costs  associated  with  damage  to \naircraft  caused  by  flying  stones  from  gravel  runways  (to \nexternal  instruments,  wing  flaps,  propeller  blades,  engines); \nand \nthe \noperational life of tires. The Project will severely diminish the \nrisk (and economic costs) of accidents or incidents. Currently \nairstrip  incursions  are  increasingly  becoming  a  safety  hazard \nbecause of poor regional airstrip conditions and poor visibility. \n\ntire  replacement  costs  by  extending \n\nlowered \n\nPassengers  benefit  from  improved  arrival  and  departure \nreliability,  savings  on  travel  time,  diminished  risks  of  flight \ncancellation  or  diversion,  and  safety  improvements.  The \ncurrent conditions of uncontrolled airstrips, poor visibility, and \npoor  record  of  on  time  arrivals  and  departures  have  a \nsignificant  impact  on  the  confidence  of  current  and  potential \ntravelers.  The  current  upward  trend  in  airstrip  incursions  is \nlikely  to  result  in  a  catostrophic  accident  if  airstrips  are  not \nfenced and properly surfaced and if access  is not controlled. \n\nAt the regional and local community levels, the economy can \nbenefit  from  significant  second-round  benefits  from  tourism. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nvii\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nAirports will receive foreign and national tourist traffic because \nsome areas have significant potential for attracting tourists.  \n\nfor \n\nImplementation of the Project entails a number of risks. First. \nthe  overall  political  and  security  situation  remains  volatile. \nADB will need to monitor the situation closely and coordinate \nwith  local  and  central  authorities  and  the  United  Nations  to \nensure  adequate  protection  of  ADB  operations.  ADB\u2019s \nthe  Security  of  ADB-Financed \nTechnical  Assistance \nin  Afghanistan  will  help  provide  a  safe  work \nProjects \nenvironment \nthe \nfor  on-site  personnel  assigned  by \ncontractors,  subcontractors,  and  consulting \nfirms.  Given \nprevailing  conditions,  however,  this  security  risk  cannot  be \nmitigated  completely,  and  if  security  hazards  occur  in  project \nlocations,  delays  in  project  implementation  will  be  inevitable \ndespite any measures put in place to control this risk. Second, \nthe regional warlords maintain their military strength and their \ninfluence  in  regional  politics.  This  political  instability  could \nhamper  the  smooth  supply  of  raw  materials  and  equipment, \nwhich would need to be transported through areas controlled \nthe  supervision  of \nby  regional  warlords,  and  constrain \nconstruction  works  by  consultants  and  ADB  staff.  Third,  the \nrehabilitated  regional  airports  could  be  used  to  transport \nopium.  While  security  checks  in  regional  airports  will  be \nthe \nthe  distribution  of  opium \nstrengthened, \nrehabilitated  airports  cannot  be  completely  contained  unless \nopium  cultivation  is  eradicated.  Fourth,  the  Government\u2019s \nimplementation  capacity  is  weak,  which  may  result  in  undue \ndelays  in  implementing  key  activities.  Also  the  lack  of \naccounting  and  auditing  capacity  implies  a  risk  of  corruption. \nThus  resources  will  be  allocated  for  consultancy  services  to \nassist with project management and implementation. Fifth, the \nPIU will consist of a team of consultants and MCAT staff and \nbe  headed  by  the  deputy  minister  of  MCAT.  Because  of  the \nlack of capacity of MCAT staff, the consultant team will carry \nout  substantial  works  and  make  key  decisions.  Lack  of \ncoordination  between  the  project  director  and  the  consultant \nteam  may  cause  delays  in  project  implementation.  ADB\u2019s \nResident  Mission  in  Afghanistan  will  play  a  key  role  in \nfacilitating  close  coordination  to  prevent  any  stalemates  in \nimplementation.

Its  population,  estimated  at  26  million,  is  spread \nover  some  652,000  square  kilometers  of  mostly  mountainous  terrain.  Apart  from  Kabul,  the \ncapital, and a few provincial capitals such as Herat, Kandahar, and Mazar-e-Sharif, Afghanistan \nhas few population centers. With the rugged Hindu Kush mountains occupying the geographical \ncenter of the country, the population centers are physically separated by steep mountains or by \ndesert.  In  the  absence  of  a  railway  system  and  functioning  river  ports,  Afghanistan  depends \nsolely on road and air transport for the movement of passengers and goods. Since the end of \nthe  conflict,  the  country  has  made  massive  efforts  to  rehabilitate  its  3,300-kilometer  primary \nroad network, which consists of a ring road that connects Kabul to major population centers and \ninternational  links  to  neighboring  countries.  While  the  road  network  will  offer  reliable  links \ncapable  of  transporting  large  volumes  of  goods  and  people  when  rehabilitation  has  been \ncompleted,  air  transport  will  continue  to  offer  the  best,  and  often  the  only,  quick  link  between \nremote  provinces  and  Kabul.  Because  of  its  strategic  geographic  location,  Afghanistan\u2019s \nairspace offers one of the shortest routes between Asia and Europe, thus keeping Afghanistan\u2019s \nairspace open to international overflights broadly benefits both the international community and \nthe country. \n \nAfghanistan  has  two  major  air  gateways:  Kabul  International  Airport  serving  the  capital \n3. \nand  Kandahar  International  Airport  serving  the  south  of  the  country.  In  the  past,  both  airports \nwere operated under instrument flight rules with day and night operations. Four major domestic \nairports (at Herat, Jalalabad, Kunduz, and Mazar-e-Sharif) provide air connections to the major \ncities. In addition, 16 regional domestic airports are spread across the country to serve smaller, \nmore  remote  areas.  These  airports  have  mainly  graveled  airside  facilities  and  operate  under \nvisual flight rules. \n \nThe prolonged conflict in Afghanistan has resulted in large-scale deterioration of the civil \n4. \naviation  infrastructure  and  depletion  of  skilled  human  resources.  In  addition  to  the  lack  of \nmaintenance,  the  heavy  damage  inflicted  during  the  decades  of  civil  strife  and  the  recent \nmilitary  operations  accelerated  the  deterioration.  Paved  runways,  taxiways,  and  aprons, \noriginally  constructed  to  a  high  standard,  are  showing  signs  of  severe  ageing,  embrittlement, \nand loss of bitumen, plus bomb craters and similar damage at a number of locations. Existing \nasphalt  pavements  will  need  asphalt  overlays  to  restore  proper  longitudinal,  cross\u2013sectional, \nand  surface  texture.  Terminal  buildings  are  in  poor  condition,  with  few  amenities  such  as \nbaggage  handling  facilities,  restaurants,  modern  heating,  lighting,  toilets,  or  plumbing.  Airport \nrescue  and  fire  services  are  also  in  a  poor  state,  with  little  equipment  and  limited  mobility. \nExisting  security  arrangements  are  lax  and  trespassing  by  unauthorized  persons  and  straying \nby animals onto airport property are common. Control tower operations and communications fall \nfar short of minimum international standards. Organized, regular airport maintenance activities \nare currently nonexistent. Airport plans and surveys are not available and none of the airports \n\n\f2\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nhas  a  master  plan.  The  current  state  of  civil  aviation  calls  for  a  significant  initiative  to  put  the \nsector on par with international standards. The project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\n2. \n\nSector Management \n\n \n5. \nThe  Ministry  of  Civil  Aviation  and  Tourism  (MCAT)  is  responsible  for  operating  and \nmaintaining  the  country\u2019s  22  airports.  MCAT  also  owns  the  national  airline  (Ariana  Afghan \nAirlines)  and  major  hotels  and  is  responsible  for  promoting  tourism  and  providing  related \nservices. MCAT is divided into eight presidencies, and currently has about 1,200 staff. Because \nof the deteriorated infrastructure and the depletion of trained staff, MCAT is unable to provide \nadequate  air  traffic  control  for  Afghanistan\u2019s  airspace.  Given  existing  controllers;  technical \nsupport staff; and communications, surveillance, and navigation systems, assuring the safety of \nflights  over  Afghanistan  is  impossible.  Immediate  action  has  to  be  taken  to  rehabilitate  and \nimprove MCAT\u2019s institutional capacity to operate and maintain the country\u2019s airports. \n \n6. \nThe  Ministry  of  Public  Works  was  responsible  for  airport  design,  construction,  and \nmaintenance. While MCAT currently continues to be responsible for airport management at all \nairports and air traffic control at certain large domestic airports, the role of the Ministry of Public \nWorks has been defunct for many years. As a result, little airport maintenance work has been \ncarried  out  since  1989.  MCAT  currently  has  no  capability  for  carrying  out  either  day-to-day  or \nmajor periodic airport maintenance, but intends to take over the airport design, construction, and \nmaintenance role in the future. \n \n7. \nMCAT carries out regulatory functions on the basis of the Civil Aviation Act of July 2003. \nHowever,  the  act  is  seriously  deficient  in  that  it  does  not  provide  MCAT  with  the  powers  and \nauthority to regulate civil aviation, such as the authority to issue the kinds of regulations, orders, \nand  directives  necessary  to  ensure  the  safety  of  aviation.  The  reestablishment  of  a  regulatory \nsystem  and  of  the  capability  to  oversee  safety  is  urgently  needed  to  ensure  the  safety  of  air \noperations and the commercial success of Ariana Afghan Airlines. In the future, the regulatory \nframework will be based on a new civil aviation act that will enable the establishment of a civil \naviation authority to act as a regulator instead of MCAT \n \n\n3. \n\nAir Transport Services \n\n \n8. \nPrior to 1989, air travel was a well-developed mode of transport in Afghanistan, popular \nwith  tourists  and  Afghan  business  people,  Government  officials,  and  other  users  who  could \nafford  to  fly.  The  national  airline,  Ariana  Afghan  Airlines,  was  established  in  1955  and  has \ncontinued to operate, despite the adverse circumstances of the last two decades. At its peak in \nthe  late  1970s,  Ariana\u2019s  fleet  regularly  flew  to  major  Western  European  cities  as  well  as  to \nneighboring  countries.  During  the  last  decade,  however,  Ariana  lost  most  of  its  international \nroutes  mainly  because  of  the  conflict  within  the  country  and  international  sanctions  imposed \nagainst the previous regime. It also lost most of its fleet and trained personnel.  \n \n9. \nSince  the  end  of  the  conflict,  Ariana  has  been  expanding  its  international  reach.  It \ncurrently owns seven aircraft and operates international flights to 13 destinations to as far away \nas Germany. However, the old age of its fleet, the shortage of properly trained personnel, the \npoorly equipped maintenance facilities, and the lack of proper oversight functions in MCAT have \ncontributed to concerns about the safety and reliability of Ariana\u2019s fleet operations. In addition to \nAriana, foreign airlines from nearby countries have started services to Afghanistan and Afghan \nairspace is rapidly opening up to international flights.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n \n\nAriana currently provides limited services on domestic routes. United Nations agencies \n10. \nand nongovernment organizations (NGOs) started a network of domestic services immediately \nfollowing  the  commencement  of  international  assistance  to  Afghanistan  in  2002.  These \nservices, operated by United Nations Humanitarian Air Services, the United Nations Assistance \nMission to Afghanistan, and Partners in Aviation Communications and Technology chiefly cater \nto  United  Nations  and  NGO  personnel.  Kam  Air,  a  start-up  commercial  airline  licensed  in \nNovember  2003,  operates  both  international  and  domestic  services  and  its  domestic  network \ncurrently serves six to eight airports. A large, untapped demand for air service appears to exist \nthat  can  only  be  met  by  developing  new  commercial  air  services.  Such  development  must  be \nunderpinned by the rehabilitation of airports and supporting infrastructure.  \n \n11. \n\nAppendix 2 presents an analysis of the civil aviation sector in Afghanistan.  \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n \n\nB. \n \n\n1. \n\nTransport Sector Review  \n\n \n12. \nThe  Transport  Sector  Review  (TSR),  prepared  with  assistance  from  the  Swedish \nInternational  Development  Cooperation  Agency  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB), \ncomprehensively  assessed  the  entire  transport  sector  in  Afghanistan  and  made  policy \nrecommendations.  Recommendations  pertinent  to  civil  aviation  concerned  (i)  policy  on \ninternational  and  domestic  routes,  (ii)  creation  of  a  proper  licensing  system,  (iii)  relationship \nbetween Ariana and the Government, (iv) airport infrastructure and its operation,  (v) air traffic \nmanagement,  (vi)  regulation  of  aviation  safety,  and  (vii)  cross-cutting  themes  such  as  the \nenvironment and subsidies for domestic routes to support the provision of basic public services.  \n \n13. \nThe  TSR  identified  weaknesses  in  the  current  organization  of  MCAT  and  proposed \nreorganizing  it  in  such  a  way  that  (i)  Ariana  will  be  run  without  Government  involvement  in \ncommercial or operational matters, but the Government\u2019s powers need to be clearly defined; (ii) \napplications  for  licenses  and  the  assessment  and  allocation  of  tenders  to  run  noncommercial \ndomestic services will be handled by a separate licensing division that will be created to handle \nthese matters; (iii) MCAT will take over responsibility for capital works for airport infrastructure \nfrom the Ministry of Public Works, a function that will ultimately be separated from MCAT and be \nestablished  as  a  corporate  structure,  analogous  to  Ariana,  to  operate  airports;  (iv)  air  traffic \nmanagement operations, once modernized, will be transferred to an independent agency or to a \nseparate  corporate  entity;  and  (v)  safety  regulation,  once  restored,  will  be  assigned  to  an \norganization separate from the central Government.  \n  \n\n2. \n\nGovernment Strategy for Sector Development \n\n \nThe Government\u2019s vision for developing the transport sector is to restore or create basic \n14. \ntransport infrastructure facilities, including roads and airports, to allow better operation of public \nand  private  transport  services  in  all  areas  of  the  country  and  international  linkages.  The \nobjectives are to facilitate economic development by improving access to markets and reducing \npoverty and promoting national and regional integration, development, and security. In the civil \naviation sector, the Government\u2019s goal is to rehabilitate and improve airports and air transport, \ntogether with tourism services. This will bring remote areas into the mainstream economy and \npermit improved linkages with and faster travel to and from the rest of the world and within the \ncountry between major cities and towns. It will also facilitate the movement of people, including \ntourists,  for  whom  Afghanistan\u2019s  natural  and  historical  sites  should  become  an  increasingly \nattractive  destination,  and  increase  trade  in  low-volume,  high-value  goods.  On  this  basis,  the \n\n\f4\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nGovernment decided to rehabilitate regional airports with ADB assistance. Pending completion \nof the Civil Aviation Master Plan  by 2004, the Government selected seven regional airports to \nbe covered by the Project in 2004 given the need to provide access to air transport services to \nremote areas with poor access by road and to balance regional development. The Government \nintends to rehabilitate the remaining regional airports by means of the ADB  Regional Airports \nRehabilitation Project Phase 2, scheduled for 2006. \n \n15. \nThe Government envisages reorganizing MCAT to focus its role on (i) formulating policy \nand  strategy,  (ii)  carrying  out  planning  and  budgeting  tasks,  and  (iii)  creating  and  maintaining \ndatabases.  The  Government  is  considering  restructuring  the  board  of  Ariana  Afghan  Airlines \nand  placing  it  directly  under  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF).  It  will  soon  reconstitute  the  board \nand  work  toward  privatizing  the  airline.  The  Government  is  also  considering  corporatizing \nairports, in which case the airports will be operationally self-financing. It will establish a separate, \nself-financing,  corporate  entity  to  operate  the  air  navigation  system  at  airports.  Legislation \nestablishing airport and air navigation system corporations will enable facilities and services to \nbe  privately  financed  and  operated  as  concessions.  A  system  for  economic  regulation  of  the \nairports and air navigation system consisting primarily of self-regulatory arrangements will have \nbeen established.  \n \n16. \nSupplementary Appendix A provides the Government\u2019s policy statement for the transport \nsector,  which  sets  out  the  principles  guiding  the  transport  sector  reforms  and  provides  a \nframework for reform implementation. \n\n \n3. \n\nExternal Assistance and Aid Coordination \n\n \n17. \nADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  (TA)  Cluster  for  Capacity  Building  for  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment,1 approved in 2002, allocated $500,000 for capacity building in MCAT. MCAT sent \n27  of  its  staff  to  the  Civil  Aviation  Training  College  in  Allahabad,  India,  for  training  in  area \ncontrol. The World Bank, as part of its Emergency Transport Rehabilitation Project approved in \n2003,  has  provided  $19.3  million  to  rehabilitate  Kabul  International  Airport,  including  the \nrunways,  the  permanent  runway  lighting  system,  and  the  power  distribution  system,  and  to \npurchase  equipment  for  communication  and  radio  navigation  aids,  runway  operations,  mobile \nlighting  for  fire  fighting,  ground  handling,  and  airfield  operations.  The  Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency  will  provide  assistance  to construct  a new  passenger  terminal  building  at \nKabul International Airport.  \n \n18.  Within the Government, MOF plays the key role in coordinating external assistance. The \nGovernment has undertaken three initiatives to improve aid coordination. First, external funding \nagencies  have  been  asked  to  focus  on  three  specific  sectors.  Second,  the  Government  has \nestablished consultative groups of aid agency and Government representatives at the local level \ncovering  12  national  development  programs  and  4  cross-cutting  advisory  groups  for  gender \nissues,  the  environment,  humanitarian  affairs,  and  human  rights,  with  one  external  agency \ndesignated  as  the  focal  point.  Third,  the  funding  agency-Government  forum  moved  from  an \nimplementation framework to a Government-led consultative process. ADB is the focal point for \ntransport,  natural  resource  management,  and  the  environment.  ADB  is  assessing  whether  to \nestablish  a  secretariat  for  the  consultative  group  on  transport  to  facilitate  policy-level \ndiscussions  and  provide  guidance  on  generic  issues  related  to  project  implementation.  ADB \nstaff are actively engaged in the proceedings of the consultative groups and the components of \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance Cluster to Afghanistan for Capacity Building for Reconstruction and Development. \nManila.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n \n\nthe proposed Project were developed in close consultation with other external funding agencies \nat the consultative group meetings. \n \n\n4. \n\nADB Strategy \n\n \n19. \nADB\u2019s  Initial  Country  Strategy  and  Program  for  Afghanistan  (2002\u20132004)  identified  the \nfollowing four principles for ADB\u2019s medium-term development framework. First, Afghan men and \nwomen must be fully involved in all stages of the reconstruction process from planning to design \nand implementation and the Government must fully own and drive the reconstruction process. \nThe  social  exclusion  of  Afghan  women,  in  particular,  should  end  with  their  return  to  the \nsocioeconomic mainstream. Second, an appropriate policy and institutional framework must be \nin  place  to  support  investment  in  reconstruction,  which  also  requires  sound  governance. \nTransparency,  accountability,  participation,  and  the  rule  of  law  provide  the  basis  of  good \ngovernance,  which  must  be  established  at  all  levels  from  the  central  level  to  community  and \nlocal  levels.  Third,  substantial  institutional  capacity  building  is  needed  to  ensure  the \neffectiveness of the reconstruction and development process. This will require solid partnerships \nwith  other  aid  agencies,  NGOs,  and  community-based  organizations.  Fourth,  investments  in \nreconstruction  must  promote  human  rights  and  social  inclusion  and  respond  to  the  needs  of \nreturning refugees, internally displaced people, and the vulnerable and disabled.  \n \nIn relation to the rehabilitation of physical infrastructure, the Initial Country Strategy and \n20. \nProgram  emphasized  that  physical  infrastructure  constraints,  which  arose  because  of  the \ninhospitable  environment,  hostilities,  and  disrepair  of  facilities,  should  be  removed  to  revive \nnormal  economic  activities.  The  Initial  Country  Strategy  and  Program  identified  those  physical \nconstraints requiring priority attention as (i) agricultural land and irrigation facilities inaccessible \nbecause of mines and unexploded ordnance or irrigation systems in disrepair; (ii) economic and \nsocial infrastructure destroyed or degraded; and (iii) other infrastructure destroyed, degraded, or \ninadequately exploited. Infrastructure rehabilitation, reconstruction, and development and mine \nclearing are to address these constraints.  \n \n21.  With  this  strategy  in  place,  the  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  for  Afghanistan \n(2003\u20132005) indicated that ADB assistance in the civil aviation sector would be directed toward \nthe rehabilitation of important regional airports to promote the integration of remote regions and \nfacilitate  more  rapid  economic  growth  in  those  areas.  The  Country  Strategy  and  Program \nUpdate  for  Afghanistan  (2004\u20132006)  includes  the  Regional  Airports  Rehabilitation  Project \nPhase 1 for 2004 in the amount of $30 million and the Regional Airports Rehabilitation Project \nPhase 2 for 2006 in the amount of $40 million to rehabilitate regional airports other than Kabul \nand Kandahar airports. It also includes TA for institutional strengthening of MCAT in 2005 in the \namount of $1 million. In addition, ADB is financing preparation of the Civil Aviation Master Plan.  \n \n\n5. \n\nInstitutional Capacity Building \n\n \n22. \nAs proposed by the TSR, the long-term goal of MCAT\u2019s reorganization is to (i) run Ariana \nwithout  Government  involvement  in  commercial  or  operational  matters,  (ii)  create  a  separate \nlicensing division to handle license applications, (iii) corporatize airport operation, (iv) create a \nseparate  agency  for  operating  the  air  traffic  management  system,  and  (v)  assign  the  safety \nregulation system to an organization separate from the central Government. These goals will be \npursued  during  a  10-year  period  as  proposed  by  the  TRS;  however,  in  the  short  and  medium \nterm,  MCAT  should  restructure  its  organization  and  strengthen  its  capacity  to  support  the \nachievement  of  its  long-term  goals.  The  TSR  proposes  restructuring  the  current  eight \npresidencies into the following four functional departments: (i) the Airports Department, (ii) the \n\n\f6\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFlight  Safety  and  Licensing  Department,  (iii)  the  Administration  Department,  and  (iv)  the  Air \nNavigation Services Department.  \n \n23. \nThe  restructuring  and  capacity  building  of  MCAT  will  be  implemented  in  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  Priority  Reform  and  Restructuring  (PRR)    scheme  in  a  phased  manner.2 The \nrestructuring of MCAT will be carried out in four phases by creating the four new departments \n(in  the  same  order  as  listed  in  para.  22).  To  facilitate  the  restructuring  and  capacity  building \nprocesses, a separate capacity building unit will be established in MCAT within the ambit of the \nPRR scheme, and ADB will support the processes of obtaining PRR status for the unit. Kabul \nInternational  Airport,  currently  a  separate  MCAT  department,  has  obtained  PRR-S  status  with \ntechnical support from the World Bank. \n \nThe  restructuring  and  capacity  building  will  not  be  undertaken  within  the  existing \n24. \norganization.  An  embryonic  new  organization  will  be  set  up  within  the  capacity  building  unit, \nwhich will serve as an incubator. This new organization will have a skeleton staff to be recruited \nfrom  among  qualified  local  or  overseas  Afghan  professionals.  The  human  resources \ndevelopment program to be provided by the Project will be used to strengthen the capacity of \nthese core staff. Once the new departmental setup has been finalized, the application for PRR \nstatus  will  be  obtained  to  have  it  established  as  a  complete  department.  Then  staff  in  the  old \ndepartment  will  be  transferred  to  the  new  one.  The  project  management  consultants  to  be \nengaged  by  the  Project  will  help  MCAT  implement  this  restructuring  and  capacity  building \ninitiative, particularly the application for PRR status for new departments.  \n \n25. \nA fair financial and budget accounting system is a prerequisite for efficient planning of \nairport  operations  and  investments.  MCAT\u2019s  current  accounting  system  is  based  on  the \nGovernment\u2019s  accounting  system  and  is  maintained  on  a  cash  basis.  Under  this  system, \nascertaining the true value of airport assets and the financial situation of airport operations and \nservices  is  difficult.  MCAT  does  not  have  accurate  information  about  actual  expenditures  and \nrevenues in relation to civil aviation operations. As a result, the governance and accountability \nof  airport  operations  are  threatened  and  MCAT\u2019s  capacity  for  long-term  planning  for  the  civil \naviation  sector  cannot  be  improved.  MCAT  should  develop  its  capacity  to  maintain  its \naccounting  records  in  accordance  with  commercial  accounting  standards  as  well  as    with  \nGovernment  accounting  rules.  Redesigning  and  upgrading  MCAT\u2019s  accounting  system  is  an \nurgent component of capacity building in MCAT.  \n \n26. \nADB\u2019s TA for Capacity Building for MCAT programmed for 2005 will support the redesig \nand  upgrading  of  MCAT\u2019s  accounting  system.  In  the  short  term,  the  project  management \nconsultants to be engaged by the Project and to be fielded around March 2005 will set up the \naccounting system for project implementation and airport operations. MCAT staff will be trained \nin  the  new  accounting  system  for  airport  operations  under  the  Project\u2019s  scheme  for \npostconstruction operations assistance. \n \n27. \nSome  key  milestones  of  the  restructuring  and  capacity  building  of  MCAT  will  be \nimplemented in line with the following time frame: (i) MCAT will establish the capacity building \nunit, obtain PRR status (stage 1) by the end of February 2005, and submit the application (stage \n2) for its PRR status by the end of March 2005; (ii) MCAT will submit the application (stage 2) \n                                                 \n2  The intent of the PRR scheme is to promote the reform and restructuring of ministries and Government agencies. \nMinistries and Government agencies can apply for PRR status in two stages by submitting preliminary institutional \nreform plans for stage 1 and by submitting detailed action plans to implement the reforms for stage 2. Once they \nhave  obtained  PRR  status,  employees  who  fill  new  posts  under  the  restructured  organization  are  compensated \nwith additional salary in the form of an interim additional allowance. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n \n\nfor  its  PRR  status  for  the  Technical,  Operations,  and  Meteorology  Department  by  the  end  of \nMarch 2005 on the basis of the PRR status (stage 1) already obtained; and (iii) MCAT will start \npreliminary analysis of the existing accounting system by the end of May 2005 and start detailed \nredesigning  and  upgrading  of  its  accounting  system  by  the  end  of  November  2005  with  ADB \nassistance.  ADB\u2019s  loan  for  the  Project  will  be  disbursed  only  when  MCAT  has  achieved \nmilestones (i) and (ii).  \n \n\n6. \n\nSecurity Situation \n\n \n28. \nSecurity  is  the  main  issue  and  constraint  in  relation  to  reconstruction.  Without  an \nadequate  level  of  security,  the  country  will  fail  to  achieve  key  national  goals  for  economic \ngrowth, political normalization and national reconciliation, and social development. Afghanistan \nhas  made  significant  gains  in  security  in  the  last  2  years  that  have  laid  a  solid  foundation  for \ncontinued and accelerated reform and has avoided a resurgence of major civil conflict. Sporadic \noutbreaks  of  armed  conflict,  even  if  not  always  fully  resolved,  have  been  contained  and \nprevented  from  spreading.  The  internationally  sponsored  security  arrangements  for  Kabul, \nbased  on  the  international  security  assistance  forces  working  in  cooperation  with  Afghan \nsecurity  forces,  have  worked  reasonably  well.  Some  improvements  have  been  made  in  the \npolice force, and the first units of a national army have been formed and trained. Security on the \nmain intercity roads has improved significantly compared with the situation 2 years ago.  \n \n29. \nNevertheless, the security situation has deteriorated in parts of the country, particularly \nin  rural  areas.  Opium  poppy  cultivation,  which  had  been  sharply  reduced  during  2000,  and \nespecially  in  2001,  made  a  strong  comeback  in  2002,  and  cultivation  expanded  further  during \nthe 2003 season. Narcotics production and trade and the profits from these activities constitute \na  major  threat  to  Afghanistan\u2019s  security,  political  normalization,  and  economic  development. \nContainment  and  eradication  of  illicit  drug  production  will  inevitably  be  a  long-term  effort  that \nrequires  a  combination  of  effective  law  enforcement  and  rural  development  that  generates \nalternative livelihoods. \n \n30. \nThe disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration program to reduce the number and \nsize  of  private  militias  and  undercut  the  military  strength  of  the  regional  governors  has \nprogressed  slowly.  A  number  of  local  militias  have  resisted,  claiming  that  the  Ministry  of \nDefense was monopolized by a particular ethnic group. Even though the Government replaced \na  number  of  senior  ministry  officials  belonging  to  this  ethnic  group  with  officials  belonging  to \nother ethnic groups in September 2003, some concerns linger about the loyalty of lower-ranking \nministry officials. This situation enables regional warlords to maintain their military strength and \ncontinue to influence regional politics, which has not helped the security situation. The security \nsituation will continue to constrain the progress of reconstruction, and concerns about security \nmay continue to discourage foreign and large-scale domestic investment. \n \n31. \nThis  fragile  security  situation  will  adversely  affect  the  implementation  of  the  Project \nbecause (i) the security hazard around project locations will disrupt and delay construction work; \n(ii)  the  supply  of  raw  materials,  which  will  have  to  be  transported  through  areas  controlled  by \nregional  warlords,  may  be  hampered;  and  (iii)  the  supervision  of  construction  work  by \nconsultants  and  ADB  staff  may  be  constrained.  To  overcome  these  problems,  the  Project  will \nmake use of the arrangements devised by ADB\u2019s TA for the Security of ADB-Financed Project \nin Afghanistan,3 which will help provide a safe work environment for on-site personnel assigned \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2004.

The current ban on cultivation \nhas  had  an  extremely  limited  effect,  and  opium  is  a  major  source  of  cash  income  for  farmers \nbecause of its ready profitability and because of a lack of other livelihood alternatives. According \nto  the  United  Nations  Office  on  Drugs  and  Crime  (UNODC),  opium  was  cultivated  on  80,000 \nhectares  in 2003, an increase of 8% over 2002, and production increased by 6% to 3,968 tons, \n20  times  more  than  in  2001,  the  last  year  of  Taliban  rule.  Farmers  grew  poppies  in  28  of  the \ncountry\u2019s 32 provinces in 2003, up from 18 in 1999. UNODC estimates that 264,000 families, or \nabout 7% of Afghanistan\u2019s population, are producing poppies, each cultivating an average of 0.3 \nhectares.  UNODC  estimates  average  yearly  earnings  at  $3,900  per  opium-growing  family,  or \n$594 per capita, in a country where per capita gross domestic product is only $207. The share \nof poppy production in the economy is large. If opium exports were included, total exports would \nbe 40% greater.  \n \n33. \nPoppy  cultivation  and  narcotics  production  and  trade  constitute  a  major  threat  to \nAfghanistan\u2019s  security  and  political  normalization  and  tie  a  poor  rural  population  to  regional \nwarlords  and  international  crime  syndicates.  To  combat  this  problem,  the  Government  has \ndeveloped a national counternarcotics strategy and is working with aid agencies involved in the \nsecurity  sector  on  containing  and  eradicating  poppy  cultivation  and  providing  support  for \nalternative  livelihoods.  ADB  support  focuses  on  helping  farm  households  develop  livelihood \nalternatives  to  poppy  cultivation.  ADB  activities  in  this  regard  include  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment  for  the  commercialization  and  diversification  of  agricultural  production  and \nrehabilitating irrigation systems, which ADB is pursuing through a demand-driven, participatory, \nand  community-based  approach.  ADB  is  also  supporting  measures  to  contain  the  flow  of \nnarcotics  across  borders  through  some  of  its  subregional activities, including  building  capacity \nand strengthening customs and immigration departments in the region.  \n \n\n8. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n \n34. \nA  number  of  lessons  can  be  drawn  from  past  emergency  assistance  projects,  best \npractices, and ADB\u2019s initial lending and nonlending operations in Afghanistan since 2002. First, \ncontinued emphasis has to be given to capacity building to improve planning, project design and \nimplementation, administration, and financial management. Second, aid coordination by means \nof consultative groups is important for avoiding duplication and delays. Third, aid groups must \nwork closely with a country\u2019s MOF and central bank to develop a viable and working payment \nsystem,  without  which  maintaining  a  flow  of  funds  is  difficult.  Fourth,  capacity  building  in \nexecuting  agencies  is  vital,  and  consulting  services  for  project  design  and  implementation \nshould provide for the training of executing agency staff in the operations and maintenance of \nrehabilitated  facilities.  Fifth,  the  number  of  procurement  packages  should  be  minimized,  given \nthe limited implementation capacity of executing agencies. Sixth, ADB\u2019s procurement guidelines \nshould  be  applied  flexibly  for  emergency  assistance  projects  to  allow  reduced  procurement \nperiods  for  the  urgent  delivery  of  project  components.  Seventh,  law  and  order  situations \nresulting  from  conflict  hamper  the  smooth  implementation  of  projects  and  extensive  security \nplans should be put in place to address possible security hazards in project locations. All these \nlessons have been incorporated into the design of the Project.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nObjective \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  help  the  Government  with  the  reconstruction  and \n35. \nrehabilitation  of  the  country  by  rehabilitating  regional  airports  damaged  during  two  decades  of \nconflict and neglect. While the Project focuses on rehabilitating key airport infrastructure, related \npolicy and institutional reforms in the transport sector are reflected in the on-going Postconflict \nMultisector Program Loan.4   \n \nB. \n \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nRehabilitation of Regional Airports  \n\n \n36. \nThe  Regional  Airports  Rehabilitation  Project  included  in  ADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy  and \nProgram  Update  for  Afghanistan  (2004\u20132006)  will  provide  rehabilitation  support  for  domestic \nand regional airports in two phases: $30 million in 2004 for phase 1 and $40 million in 2006 for \nphase  2.  The  Project  covers  the  rehabilitation  of  seven  airports:    Bamyan,  Chaghcharan, \nFaizabad,  Farah,  Maimana,  Qalai-Naw,  and  Zaranj.  Major  rehabilitation  work  includes  the \nfollowing:  \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nreconstructing runways and stopways; building new taxiway and apron; \nconstructing, widening, or regrading runway strip; \nbuilding  new  passenger  terminal  or  renovating  existing  one,  including  providing \nfurniture; \nproviding water supply, sewerage, and power supply system; \nreconstructing access roads and car parks; \nproviding  airport  maintenance  plant,  equipment,  and  airport  maintenance \nbuilding; \nconstructing airport boundary fence and apron security fencing and gates; \nproviding new fire station, control tower, technical building including furniture, and \nwarehouse including temperature-controlled storage facilities;5 \nproviding staff housing; \nproviding  automatic  weather  observation  system  and  precision  approach  path \nindicator; and \nproviding de-mining support. \n\nThe  civil  works  contracts  are  packaged  as  design-build.  Appendix  3  summarizes  the \n\n \n37. \ndetailed design standards for runways and required equipment for each airport.  \n \n\n2. \n\nHuman Resource Development \n\n \n38. \nThe Project will provide two human resource development  packages for current MCAT \nstaff  and  new  recruitments  to  strengthen  their  capacity  for  sector  management  and  airport \n\n                                                 \n4   Policy  objectives  in  the  transport  sector  include  (i)  creating  an  enabling  framework  for  market-based  competition \nand  efficiency,  (ii)  establishing  safe  and  reliable  transport  services,  (iii)  improving  institutional  efficiency,  (iv) \nestablishing a regulatory framework, (v) improving transparency and accountability, (vi) instituting a mechanism for \ncost  recovery,  (vii)  encouraging  private  sector  participation,  and  (viii)  establishing  a  national  system  for  road \nimprovement and maintenance.  \n\n5  Temperature-controlled storage facilities  will be leased out to a private sector operator for sustainable operations \n\nand maintenance. \n\n\f10\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\noperations and maintenance. The first package will strengthen the training capacity of the Civil \nAviation  Training  Center  operated  by  MCAT.  The  Project  will  provide  support  for  course \ndevelopment  and  engagement  of  instructors  and  in  a  2-year  period  will  produce  about  180 \ngraduates  in  a  range  of  disciplines,  such  as  airport  management,  airport  inspection,  airport \nmaintenance,  airport  engineering,  airside  operations  and  management,  flight  safety,  airport \nsecurity checks for opium smuggling, and aviation security.  \n \n39. \nThe  second  package  will  provide  an  overseas  training  program  for  MCAT  staff  for \nadvanced training. ADB\u2019s TA Cluster for Capacity Building for Reconstruction and Development \n(footnote 1), approved in 2002, provided assistance for MCAT to train 27 of its staff in air traffic \ncontrol.  This  package  will  extend  the  on-going  overseas  training  program  by  expanding  the \ncourses  to  cover  such  critical  subjects  as  airport  management,  flight  safety,  and  aviation \nsecurity and increasing the number of trainees to about 50. The Regional Airport Rehabilitation \nProject Phase 2, programmed for 2006, will continue supporting human resource development \nso as to build adequate capacity over the long term. \n \n\n3. \n\nPostconstruction Operations Assistance \n\noperations \n\n \n40. \n MCAT  will  face  a  major  challenge  in  operating  and  maintaining  the  airports  that  will \nhave  been  rehabilitated  by  the  Project,  because  adequate  human  resources  to  manage  the \nairports  appropriately  are  not  available.  The  Project  will  provide  assistance  to  engage  a \npostconstruction \nairport \nmanagement/operations  specialist,  an  airport  maintenance  specialist,  and  an  airport  fire \nservices specialist for 1 year following the completion of rehabilitation. The team will be placed \nin MCAT and form the nucleus of an airport operations and maintenance division. The team will \ninclude  the  graduates  from    the  Civil  Aviation  Training  Center  and  the  trainees  who  have \nreturned from training overseas, and the specialists engaged will provide on-the-job training for \nthem  until  their  technical  competence  is  sufficient  for  them  to  take  over  the  responsibility  of \nairport operations and maintenance. \n \n\nassistance \n\nthat  will \n\nconsist \n\nteam \n\nan \n\nof \n\n4. \n\nProject Management and Monitoring \n\n \nA consultant team will be hired to help MCAT implement the Project. Team members will \n41. \noccupy key posts in the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) to be established under MCAT, with \nthe  team  leader  serving  as  project  manager.  The  consultant  team  will  be  responsible  for  (i) \noverseeing  overall  project  management;  (ii)  assisting  with  the  procurement  of  civil  works;  (iii) \nsupervising  construction  and  installation  of  equipment,  including  reviewing  detailed  designs \nprepared  by  contractors;  (iv)  testing  and  certifying  completed  works;  (v)  implementing  and \nsupervising  the  training  component  of  the  Project;  (vi)  providing  assistance  for  institutional \ncapacity building in MCAT; (vii) assisting with postconstruction operations and providing on-the-\njob  training  for  airport  operations  and  maintenance  staff;  and  (viii)  undertaking  benefit \nmonitoring and evaluation.  \n \n\n5. \n\nAdministrative Support \n\nThe  Project  will  finance  the  engagement  of  external  auditors  to  audit  project  accounts \n\n \n42. \nand the payment of additional salary to MCAT staff assigned to the PIU.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCost Estimates \n\nSpecial Features \n\nC. \n \n43. \nIn view of the extraordinary challenges inherent in coping with the postconflict situation, \nAfghanistan  has  requested  enhanced  concessionality  in  ADB\u2019s  funding  the  transition  and \nreconstruction  phase.  The  request  is  supported  by  a  recent  analysis  of  debt  sustainability  by \nADB  and  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  which  concludes  that  funding  for  development \nprojects should be on a grant basis or on highly concessional terms for key projects and reforms \nfor which no grant funding can be mobilized. Accordingly, special lending terms are proposed as \nfollows:  (i)  grandfathering  pre-1999  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  lending  terms  so  that  the \nloan  has  a  40-year  maturity,  including  a  10-year  grace  period,  with  a  1%  interest  charge \nthroughout its term; and (ii) capitalizing interest during the grace period. These special lending \nterms  have  been  applied  to  other  projects  approved  for  Afghanistan  since  lending  operations \nresumed in late 2002. \n \nD. \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $32.1  million  equivalent,  including  physical \n44. \ncontingencies and interest charges during construction. The foreign exchange cost is estimated \nat $23.7 million, representing about 74% of total costs. The local currency cost is estimated at \n$8.4 million equivalent, or about 26% of total costs. The local currency costs include $0.2 million \nequivalent  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Detailed  cost  estimates  are  provided  in \nAppendix 4.  \n \nE. \n \n45. \nThe proposed ADB loan is $30 million equivalent from Special Funds (ADF) resources \ndenominated in special drawing rights. The ADB loan will finance 100% of the foreign exchange \ncosts  of  the  Project  and  76%  of  the  local  currency  costs.  The  total  ADB  financing  will  cover \n93.5%  of  the  total  project  costs.  The  United  Nations  Office  of  Project  Services  (UNOPS)  will \nprovide parallel cofinancing of $2 million equivalent for the Project, or 6.2% of total project costs, \nwhich  will  be  used  to  finance  renovation  of  terminal  buildings,  water  supply  systems,  and \nboundary fencing. The Government will finance the land acquisition cost of $0.1 million, or 0.3% \nof total project costs. If UNOPS cofinancing does not materialize, financing to cover the UNOPS \ncomponent  will  be  considered  through  alternative  sources  (including  from  ADB,  subject  to \napproval of its Board). \n \n46. \nloan available for the Project\u2019s executing agency through appropriate budgetary allocation.  \n \nF. \n\nThe  borrower  will  be  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan.

MCAT will be the executing agency for the Project. A project steering committee (PSC), \nchaired  by  the  minister  of  MCAT,  will  be  established  to  provide  the  overall  guidance  and \noversight required for smooth implementation of the Project. The PSC will consist of the deputy \nministers  of  MOF  and  MCAT  and  will  meet  at  least  quarterly  to  review  project  implementation \nand  to  resolve  procurement  and  other  issues.  If  necessary,  the  PSC  will  be  supported  by \n\n\f12\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nexternal  experts  financed  by  the  Project  to  help  resolve  sector-specific  technical  issues.  The \nimplementation arrangements are shown in Appendix 5. \n \n\nb. \n\nProject Implementation Unit \n\n \n48. \nThe PIU will be established in MCAT, will be headed by the project director, and will be \nresponsible for day-to-day implementation of the Project, including completing training programs \nand  providing  assistance  with  postconstruction  operations.  The  deputy  minister  of  MCAT  will \nserve as project director. MCAT will provide counterpart staff for the PIU to be assigned under \nthe project management consultants on a full-time basis. MCAT staff will play a supporting role \nin the PIU\u2019s operations and build up their technical competence for project management through \non-the-job training. Appendix 6 shows the organization of the PIU. \n\n \nc. \n\nAdvance Action for Procurement  \n\n \n49. \nADB management approved advance action for the procurement of consulting services, \ncivil  works,  and  equipment.  Such  advance  action  is  in  general  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \nprocurement requirements and procedures. The approval of advance action will not necessarily \ncommit ADB to financing the Project.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe  Project  will  be \n\n \n50. \nincluding  preconstruction  and \nimplemented  over  4  years, \npostconstruction activities. The project management consultants will be mobilized in April 2005, \nand civil works will start in July 2005 and be completed by June 2007. The entire Project will be \ncompleted by June 2008. Appendix 7 presents a detailed implementation schedule.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n51. \nThe procurement of goods, services, and civil works to be financed under the Project will \nbe  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The  Government \nrequested flexible application of such guidelines, including shorter bidding periods of 60 days for \nthe  procurement  of  civil  works  under  international  competitive  bidding  and  no  prequalification \nexercise  for  international  procurement.  The  Government  Procurement  Unit  of  Afghanistan \nReconstruction and Development Services (ARDS) will undertake all international procurement, \nincluding the recruitment of project management consultants. MCAT will execute and administer \nthe  contracts  in  close  coordination  with  the  Government  Procurement  Unit  of  ARDS.  For  the \ncomponents cofinanced by UNOPS, UNOPS\u2019s own procurement procedures will be followed.  \n \n52. \nAll  contracts  for  carrying  out  civil  works  and  supplying  equipment  will  be  divided  into \nsuitable  contract  packages.  The  civil  works  contracts  are  packaged  as  design-build  to  ensure \ndelivery  within  the  project  implementation  period.  The  civil  works  contracts  will  be  awarded \nfollowing  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.  The  contracts  for  navigational  aid \nequipment  will  be  procured  using  international  shopping  procedures  given  that  only  a  limited \nnumber of suppliers are available and that the purchase of equipment needs to be expedited. All \nmanufacturers and suppliers of needed navigational aid equipment certified by the International \nCivil  Aviation  Organization  will  be  invited  to  bid  during  the  course  of  international  shopping. \nIndicative contract packages are provided in Appendix 8. \n \n53. \nSome of the project airports are located in the western part of the country, where ADB \nnonmember countries, particularly those in the Gulf region, are competitive sources of materials, \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n \n\n \n\n \n\nespecially  the  bitumen  required  for  runway  pavement.  Explicit  procurement  restrictions  may \npreclude  civil  works  contractors  under  the  Project  from  seeking  the  best  business  terms,  and \nultimately  erode  economic  efficiency.  To  maximize  the  Project\u2019s  development  impact  and \neconomic efficiency, it is proposed that civil works contractors under the Project be allowed to \nprocure the bitumen required for runway pavement from all countries, including from countries \nthat are not ADB members.6  \n\n \n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n54. \nThe consultants will be selected and appointed by the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod using complete technical proposals in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  The \nconsulting services will require about 301 person-months of international consultants and about \n152  person-months  of  domestic  consultants.  For  designing  an  accounting  system,  individual \nconsultants will be engaged separately for 24 person-months of international consultants and 24 \nperson-months of domestic consultants. The outline terms of reference for consulting services \nare provided in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \nLoan funds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \n55. \nAn  imprest  account,  primarily  for  expenditures  related  to  the  implementation  of  training, \npostconstruction  operations  assistance,  and  other  operations  support,  will  be  established  in \nMOF with a designated treasurer in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The \ndesignated  treasurer  will  open  a  deposit  account  at  the  Da  Afghanistan  Bank  to  which  ADB\u2019s \nloan proceeds will be transferred and against which the treasurer\u2019s checks will be issued. The \ninitial  amount  to  be  deposited  into  the  imprest  account  will  be  the  lesser  of  6  months  of \nestimated  expenditures  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount.  The  statement  of  expenditure  procedures \nwill  be  used  for  reimbursing  eligible  expenditures  and  liquidating  the  imprest  account  for  any \nindividual payment transaction up to $50,000 equivalent.  \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n56.  MCAT  will  maintain  separate  accounts  and  records  for  the  Project  in  accordance  with \nsound  accounting  principles.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  MCAT  has  proper  audit  and \naccounting procedures in place to ensure efficient and economical use of the loan proceeds for \nthe beneficiaries. Separate project accounts and financial statements will be maintained that are \nadequate  to  identify  the  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  the  financing \nresources,  the  expenditures  incurred,  and  the  use  of  local  funds.  Such  accounts and  financial \nstatements will be maintained in accordance with sound accounting principles and certified by \nindependent private auditors acceptable to ADB.  \n \n57. \nThe  unaudited  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  submitted  to \nADB  no  later  than  6  months  after  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year,  followed  by  the  submission  of \naudited project accounts and related financial statements no later than 9 months after the end of \nthe fiscal year. The annual audit will include an audit of the imprest account and statement of \nexpenditure  records,  and  the  audit  report  will  include  a  separate  opinion  on  the  audit.  The \n\n                                                 \n6 This  is  pursuant  to  Article  14  (ix)  of  the  ADB  Charter,  which  provides  that  the  Board  may,  by  a  vote  of  directors \nrepresenting  not  less  than  two  thirds  of  the total  voting  power  of  the  members,  agree  to  permit  procurement  from \nnon-ADB member countries in special circumstances that make such procurement appropriate. \n\n\f14\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nGovernment will help ADB representatives carry out spot and random checks on the flow and \nuse of funds. \n \n58.  MCAT,  with  PIU  assistance,  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project  monitoring.  The  PIU \nwill  establish  a  system  for  preparing  quarterly  reports  for  performance  monitoring  and  issues \nresolution  plus  periodic  action  plans.  The  action  plans  will  incorporate  quantitative  and  time-\nbound  implementation  targets  and  will  be  reviewed  and  approved  by  the  PSC.  The  quarterly \nreports will serve as a feedback system for management to update and improve procedures and \nproject  implementation.  The  PIU  will  submit  the  quarterly  reports  to  ADB.  Within  3  months  of \nproject  completion,  the  PIU  will  prepare  a  comprehensive  project  completion  report  on  the \noverall impact of the Project.  \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n59. \nAided  by  the  PIU,  MCAT  will  undertake  quantitative  and  qualitative  performance \nmonitoring of each project component to evaluate the delivery of the planned facilities and the \nproject benefits accrued. With the help of the project management consultants, no later than 3 \nmonths following loan effectiveness, MCAT will develop a comprehensive system for monitoring \nthe Project\u2019s performance. ADB will review and approve this system. ADB and the Government \nwill  agree  on  the  performance  parameters  to  be  monitored  during  the  implementation  of  the \nProject and for 3 months after project completion. \n\n \n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n \nADB staff will review project implementation through regular or special review missions. \n60. \nBased  on  the  project  schedule,  a  midterm  review  will  be  carried  out  around  July  2006.  The \nGovernment  will  submit  a  detailed  progress  report  on  the  Project\u2019s  implementation  and \nachievements  to  ADB  prior  to  the  midterm  review.  Terms  of  reference  for  the  midterm  review \nwill be included in the project administration memorandum to be prepared by ADB\u2019s Inception \nMission for the Project.  \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nFinancial Management and Financial Viability \n\n \nA. \n \n61. \nExcept for military airports, MCAT directly owns, manages, and operates all airports and \nair navigation services. All revenues generated by civil airports and air navigation services are \ncollected  by  the  civil  aviation  authorities  under  MCAT  and  deposited  in  the  Government \ntreasury.  All  expenditure  on  salaries,  repairs  and  maintenance,  and  utilities  are  met  by  the \nGovernment\u2019s budget allocation. Accounting for the revenues and expenses of MCAT and the \nairports  and  air  navigation  services  is  centralized  in  MOF.  MOF  finalizes  the  operational \nexpenditure  budget  on  the  basis  of  proposals  prepared  by  MCAT.  After  MOF  finalizes  the \ndetails of the annual expenditure budget, MCAT transfers the budget provision to each airport.  \n \nFinancial projections have been prepared for Afghanistan\u2019s civil aviation sector to assess \n62. \nthe  Project\u2019s  financial  viability  and  sustainability  as  a  whole  (Appendix  9).  The  projections \nindicate that financial revenues will be sufficient to cover operating and maintenance costs.  \n \nThe  financial  evaluation  for  each  airport  was  undertaken  in  real  terms  using  constant \n63. \n2004 prices. Incremental costs and benefits were derived by evaluating the financial position of \neach airport under with and without project scenarios. The financial internal rate of return for the \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nseven airports, computed on an after tax basis, ranges from 3.7% to 7.9%, with an average over \nall seven subprojects of 5%. This compares favorably with the weighted average cost of capital, \nalso  computed  on  an  after  tax  basis,  of  4%.  Sensitivity  and  risk  analyses  indicates  that  the \nfinancial internal rate of return for all airports is robust under adverse conditions. Based on the \nfinancial  projections  and  financial  evaluation,  the  Project  is  considered  both  financially  viable \nand sustainable. \n \nB. \n \n64. \nFor the economic evaluation, the benefits of the Project have been calculated in term of \nusers\u2019 willingness to pay as reflected in incremental revenues from airport operations, such as \nlanding  charges,  passenger  service  charges,  and  other  fees  and  charges  for  airport  services. \nThe  evaluation  also  includes  as  assessment  of  (i)    benefits  to  operators,  such  as  savings  in \ndirect wear and tear costs and fuel; (ii) benefits to passengers, such as direct time savings; (iii) \nbenefits  from  safety  improvements;  and  (iv)  benefits  to  regional  and  local  communities  from \nsuch things as the development of tourism.  \n \n65. \nThe benefits to operators are substantial in terms of improvements in aircraft productivity \nresulting from reduced downtimes for maintenance; elimination of costs associated with damage \nto aircraft (external instruments, wing flaps, propeller blades, engines) caused by  flying stones \nfrom gravel runways; and reduced costs for tire replacement by extending the operational life of \ntires. Aircraft landing on a gravel surface take longer to stop than on a bitumen surface because \nof  reduced  braking  efficiency,  thus  bitumen  runways  improve  fuel  efficiency.  The  Project  will \nalso  severely  diminish  the  risk  and  economic  costs  of  accidents  or  other  incidents  caused  by \nairstrip  incursions,  which  are  increasingly  becoming  a  safety  hazard  because  of  poor  airstrip \nconditions and poor visibility. \n \n66. \nThe Project\u2019s economic costs include the resource costs for traded and nontraded costs, \nmaterials,  and  labor.  All  cost  elements  are  valued  at  border  prices,  using  a  world  price \nnumeraire, with all taxes and duties excluded. A standard conversion factor of 0.80 was applied \nto the financial costs of nontraded inputs to calculate economic prices. Subproject facilities are \nexpected to have an average economic life of 30 years. \n \n67. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the seven airports ranges from 18.0% to \n28.4%, with a consolidated EIRR of 22.2%. A sensitivity analysis tested the effects of possible \nunfavorable scenarios resulting from changes in the key parameters that determine the Project\u2019s \ncosts  and  benefits.  This  analysis  indicates  that  the  Project\u2019s  economic  viability  would  remain \nsatisfactory even under adverse scenarios, and that it would require a cost increase i of 113% \nor a decrease in benefits of 53% to reach a cut-off EIRR of 12%. Appendix 10 presents details \nof  the  economic  analysis.  The  project  benefits  distribution  analysis  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix C. \n \nC. \n \n\nSocial Impacts \n\n1. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n \n68. \nThe Project\u2019s impact on land and resettlement will be insignificant, because most of the \nrehabilitation activities are to be carried out on land the Government already owns. Of the seven \nairports included in phase I, the Project will have land acquisition and resettlement impacts at \nonly  four  airports  (Bamyan,  Faizabad,  Qalai-Naw,  and  Zaranj).  The  Project  will  affect  42 \npermanent residential structures, as a result of which nearly 2 hectares of homestead land will \n\n\f16\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nalso have to be acquired. In addition, 0.8 hectare of agricultural land owned by the Agriculture \nDepartment and currently being used by a private agency for agricultural research will have to \nbe transferred to MCAT. Two community structures, including one graveyard and one mosque, \nwill be affected, and five households currently cultivating Government land would suffer income \nlosses. Overall, the Project will affect 56 households and 196 people. Those people affected will \nreceive  the  replacement  value  of  their  property  and  other  physical  assets  and  assistance  to \ncover income losses and relocation and additional assistance will also be provided to vulnerable \nhouseholds.  The  estimated  cost  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  AF7,853,023  or  $0.17 \nmillion. The short resettlement plan has been translated into Dari and will be disclosed to those \naffected (Appendix 11). The complete plan will be publicly available at MCAT, ADB\u2019s Resident \nMission in Afghanistan, and ADB\u2019s web site.  \n \n\n2. \n\nIndigenous People \n\nPoverty Reduction Impacts \n\n \n69. \nAfghanistan is home to many ethnic and linguistic groups, as well as to several sects of \nIslam  and  to  other  religions.  Historic  and  geographic  factors  have  created  and  preserved  this \ndiversity,  although  the  degree  of  cultural  assimilation  varies  and  a  considerable  degree  of \ncultural  homogeneity  exists.  The  main  ethnic  groups  in  the  project  area  are  Pushtuns,  Tajik, \nHazara,  Turkoman,  Uzbek,  and  other  Muslim  and  non-Muslim  groups.  These  ethnic \ncommunities  have  become  part  of  mainstream  society  and  are  prominent  groups  with  large \npopulations  in  each  region.  The  social  assessment  did  not  identify  the  presence  of  any \nindigenous populations in the project area. None of the ethnic communities will be marginalized \nbecause  of  a  dominant  community  in  the  region  or  by  project  development.  The  summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \nD. \n \n70. \nApproximately  53%  of  Afghanistan\u2019s  population  is  classified  as  poor,  that  is,  living  on \nless than $1 per day or approximately 2,100 kilocalories per day. In the project provinces, the \naverage daily income is less than $1, no more than $0.74 per person per day, compared with a \nnational  average  income  for  unskilled  labor  of  $1.7  to  $3.2  per  person  per  day.  The  social \nassessment in the project area also revealed that 50% to 60% of the population lives below the \npoverty line and has an average income of AF2,000 to AF3,000 per month. Thus high levels of \npoverty are apparent in all the project provinces.  \n \n71. \nThe direct benefit of the Project to poor households will be employment in construction \nactivities  at  airports  in  terms  of  net  income  earned  during  the  project  period.  Both  poor  and \nnonpoor households are likely to benefit directly in the medium and long term, as additional jobs \nwill  be  created  in  airport  administration  and  management,  fire  fighting  services,  and  catering; \nwith  private  airlines;  with  local  contractor  firms  likely  to  be  involved  in  maintaining  airport \nfacilities;  and,  most  important,  in  the  tourism  industry.  An  indirect  but  important  impact  will  be \nthe provision of much needed humanitarian aid and basic public services to remote regions. The \nProject will also generate additional employment opportunities by facilitating access to regional \nand  international  markets  for  agricultural,  livestock,  and  other  manufactured  and  perishable \nproducts; facilitating regional trade; and stimulating the growth of local trade and enterprises.  \n \nE. \n \nThe  Project  is  categorized  as  \u201cB\u201d  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  2003  Environmental \n72. \nAssessment  Guidelines.  Therefore  an  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  undertaken \nas  part  of  the  feasibility  study.  The  IEE  found  that  the  Project  would  not  have  any  significant \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n \n\n \n\n \n\nimpact that would need to be assessed further. The most likely environmental impact is related \nto the construction work, such as erosion and sedimentation associated with earthworks. Other \nimpacts are increased dust and volatile gases from hot mix plants used for the reconstruction of \nrunways and taxiways and the contamination of surface water. All these impacts are temporary \nand  mitigation  measures  are  manageable.  Mitigation  measures  during  the  construction  stage \nwill  be  incorporated  into  contractors\u2019  job  assignments,  therefore  the  IEE  report  will  have  been \nmade available to contractors. The environmental impacts related with actual airport operations \nare (i) noise caused by increased air traffic; (ii) solid wastes and wastewater resulting from office \nand  airport  activities;  and  (iii)  oil  wastes  from  the  operation  of  power  generation,  aircraft \ncleaning, and refueling activities. However, given the level of airport operations, these impacts \nwill not be significant. Nonetheless, proper waste management and the installation of oil traps in \nall  outlets  and  drainage  facilities  prior  to  discharging  wastewater  into  water  bodies  will  be \nnecessary. The summary IEE is in Appendix 13.  \n \nF. \n \n73. \n \n\nImplementation of the Project entails a number of risks as follows: \n\nRisks \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe  overall  political  and  security  situation  remains  volatile.  ADB  will  need  to \nmonitor the situation closely and coordinate with local and central authorities and \nthe  United  Nations  to  ensure  that  ADB  operations  are  adequately  protected.7 \nADB\u2019s TA for the Security of ADB-Financed Projects in Afghanistan will provide \nadvice on how to ensure a safe work environment for on-site personnel assigned \nby  the  contractors,  subcontractors,  and  consulting  firms.  Under  prevailing \nconditions, however, the security risk cannot be mitigated completely, and delays \nin  project  implementation  will  be  inevitable  if  security  hazards  occur  in  project \nlocations despite the measures put in place to control the risk. \nThe regional warlords have maintained their military strength and their influence \nin regional politics. This political instability could hamper a smooth supply of raw \nmaterials  and  equipment,  which  would  be  transported  through  areas  controlled \nby  regional  warlords,  and  constrain  the  supervision  of  construction  works  by \nconsultants and ADB staff.  \nThe rehabilitated regional airports could be used to transport opium. The security \nchecks carried out in regional airports will be strengthened, but the distribution of \nopium  through  rehabilitated  airports  cannot  be  completely  contained  unless \nopium cultivation is eradicated.  \nThe  implementation  of  key  activities  may  be  unduly  delayed  because  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  weak  implementation  capacity.  Also  the  lack  of  accounting  and \nauditing  capacity  implies  a  risk  of  corruption.  Resources  will  be  allocated  for \nconsultancy services to help with project management and implementation. \nThe  PIU  will  consist  of  a  team  of  consultants  and  MCAT  staff  with  the  deputy \nminister  of  MCATserving  as  project  director.  Because  of  the  lack  of  capacity  of \nMCAT  staff,  the  consultant  team  will  be  responsible  for  a  significant  amount  of \nthe  work  and  take  key  decisions,  and  any  lack  of  coordination  between  the \nproject  director  and  the  consultant  team  may  delay  project  implementation. \nADB\u2019s  Resident  Mission  will  play  a  key  role  in  facilitating  coordination  and \nprevent any stalemate in implementation.  \n\n                                                 \n7   Coordination  with  the  provincial  reconstruction  team  providing  security  for  development  activities  in  the  project \n\nareas may also be explored. \n\n\f18\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  progress  of  project  implementation  may  be  disrupted  if  poorly  qualified \nMCAT  staff  are  assigned  to  the  PIU.  The  consultant  team  will  be  involved  in \nselecting staff to be assigned to the PIU and will provide continuous training for \nthem once they have been selected and assigned.  \nThe  Government  Procurement  Unit  of  ARDS,  a  dedicated  agency  for  handling \nplanning,  coordination,  preparation,  and  procurement  for  major  reconstruction \nprojects, will be responsible for all procurement related to the Project. A lack of \nclose  coordination  between  the  PIU  and  the  Government  Procurement  Unit  of \nARDS  will  delay  procurement.  The  Government  Procurement  Unit  will  be \ninvolved in project implementation as an observer of the PSC to provide technical \nadvice in procurement matters relating to the Project.  \n\n(viii)  The  retention  of  trained  MCAT  staff  will  be  a  major  challenge,  as  they  may  be \nlured  by  better  remuneration  offered  by  the  private  sector.  MCAT  will  provide  a \ntransparent  career  development  path  for  its  staff  so  they  can  plan  their  careers \nwith a long-term perspective. For those who receive overseas training, MCAT will \nobtain  a  commitment  that  they  will  either  stay  on  in  MCAT  for  a  certain  period \nafter their training or will repay the cost of training if they resign before the end of \nthe period. The Project includes an administrative support component to pay for \nextra remuneration for MCAT staff who are assigned to the PIU after training. \n\n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n74. \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe  Government  will  make  its  best  effort  to  provide  adequate  security  for  the \nsmooth and uninterrupted implementation of the Project. \nThe Government will ensure strengthened airport security checks to prevent and \ndetect smuggling of opium through improved air transport. \nThe Government will ensure that adequate budgetary allocations of the required \ncounterpart  funds  are  made,  approved,  and  released  in  a  timely  manner  to \nensure  proper  implementation  of  the  Project.  The  Government  will  also  ensure \nthat  adequate  staff  resources  are  allocated  for  the  Project  by  concerned \nministries as required for implementation of the Project. \nThe Government will allocate and make available, in a timely manner, sufficient \nfunds  from  its  budget  for  each  fiscal  year  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  of \nthe project facilities and ensure that such facilities are operated and maintained \nin accordance with sound practices in the civil aviation sector. The Government \nwill also ensure that after completion of airport rehabilitation, a post-construction \noperations assistance team will be established under MCAT which will consist of \nexternal  experts  for  airport  operation,  and  take  charge  of  the  operations  and \nmaintenance for the rehabilitated airports for 1 year, providing on-the-job training \nfor MCAT staff assigned to the team. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  temperature-controlled  storage  facilities  to \nbe  provided  by  the  Project  will  be  leased  out  to  a  private  sector  operator  for \nsustainable operation and maintenance of the facilities, following transparent and \nfair procedures for selection of such a private sector operator. \nThe Government will ensure that no duties or other similar levies will be imposed \non  any  equipment,  material,  or  services  required  for  the  Project,  and  if  such \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(vii) \n\nduties and levies are imposed, they will be paid by the Government promptly to \nensure timely project implementation. \nTo  the  extent  feasible,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  the  reconstruction  and \nrehabilitation of the project facilities will be carried out on land already acquired \nand/or owned by the Government. In case there are adjustments to the rights-of-\nway that necessitate land acquisition, the Government will ensure that the social \nand economic condition of the affected persons, regardless of the land title, will \nbe restored and/or enhanced through mitigating measures. The Government will \nfurther ensure that any land acquisition and resettlement activities will be carried \nout  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  laws  and  policies  of  the  Government,  the \nADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement,1995, and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous \nPeople,1998 as set forth in the short resettlement plan. The Government will also \nensure that, all land and rights-of-way required for project implementation will be \nmade available in a timely manner. \n\n(ix) \n\nimplement \n\nthe  Project \n\n(viii)  The short resettlement plan will be updated by MCAT through the PIU, based on \ndetailed design and will be subject to ADB approval before award of civil works \ncontract.  MCAT  will  disclose  the  short  resettlement  plan  and  make  the \ninformation  available \nland  acquisition  and \nto  all  affected  people  before \nresettlement,  and  confirm  that  such  information  is  posted  on  ADB\u2019s  web  site. \nMCAT  will  also  submit  revised  resettlement  plan  for  ADB\u2019s  approval  if  the \nGovernment enforces civil aviation law standards of maintaining a clear zone of \n150-meter flyover area outside the 90-meter graded runway strip for the airports \nduring project implementation. \nThe  Government  will \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy,  2002,  the  IEE  and  the  environmental  monitoring  plan.  For \nthis  purpose  the  Government  will  make  available  adequate  budget,  and  ensure \nthat  all  mitigation  and  monitoring  measures  set  out  in  the  IEE  and  the \nenvironment  monitoring  plan  are  incorporated  in  the  design,  including  detailed \ndesign,  of  the  project  facilities,  and  implemented  during  construction, operation, \nand maintenance thereof.  \nThe Government will ensure that a specific plan for local consultation to address \nsafety, social, and cultural issues, during project implementation, will be included \nin  the  bidding  documents.  The  Government  will  further  ensure  that  men  and \nwomen are given equal employment opportunities and without any differentiation \nof  wages  for  equal  work  by  the  civil  work  contractors.  The  mechanism  for \nmaximizing local employment benefits will be included in the project design and \nthe bidding documents. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  civil  works  contracts  include  legally \nmandated  provisions  on  health  and  sanitation  and  on  appropriate  working \nconditions, including, as appropriate, accommodation, for construction workers at \ncampsites during the construction period. The Government will also ensure that \ncivil  work  contractors  do  not  employ  children  for  construction  and  maintenance \nworks. \n\n(xi) \n\n(x) \n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness \n\nThe Government will have established the PIU  within MCAT and appointed the project \n\n \nB. \n \n75. \ndirector. \n \n\n\f20\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nConditions for Loan Disbursement \n\nC. \n \n76. \nThe Government will have established a capacity building unit in MCAT.

of  the  high  costs  of  land  transport  caused  mainly  by  difficult  terrain,  severe  weather \nconditions  ranging  from  snow  to  sandstorms  and  high  temperatures,  flash  flooding,  and \nbanditry. \n \n2. \nPrior to 1989, civil aviation was reasonably well developed and well patronized by local \ncommunities and foreign tourists. Passenger and freight data for 1980 indicate that upward of \n125,000 passengers traveled between 12 airports. However, after 20 years of conflict, most of \nthe sector\u2019s infrastructure has either been damaged or destroyed, airlines have been decimated, \nand  trained  human  resources  have  been  severely  depleted.  Since  2002,  limited  civil  aviation \nhas  given  crucial  support  to  emergency  rehabilitation  and  recovery  efforts,  and  the  nation \nbuilding  processes  currently  under  way  will  be  highly  dependent  on  civil  aviation  for  the \nforeseeable future. \n \n3. \nThe  national  road  system,  which  is  currently  in  poor  condition,  is  undergoing  an \nextensive rehabilitation program, with completion of the ring road as the first priority. While this \nwill  restore  relatively  rapid  and  reliable  services  for  freight  and  passengers  within  proximity  of \nthe  ring  road,  many  other  more  isolated  provincial  centers  with  large  populations  will  have  to \nwait  many  years  for  good  road  connections.  Many  roads  may  never  be  upgraded  to  highway \nstandards because of constraints imposed by the terrain. \n \n4. \nAirports  and  air  transport  present  different  challenges  for  policymakers  and  regulators. \nThe differences arise from the cost characteristics and from the market structures through which \neach  transportation  subsector  provides  facilities  and  services.  Afghanistan\u2019s  airport  industry  is \nundergoing  a  transformation  from  being  a  grossly  undermanaged  public  utility  in  decline  with \nmounting financial losses, a result of the prolonged conflict situation, to being a more efficient, \nmarket-oriented industry with a more commercial outlook.  \n \nChanges in Afghanistan\u2019s political and economic growth prospects have created a new \n5. \nchallenge,  namely,  establishing  an  appropriate  form  of  competition  and  rebuilding  regulatory \ninstitutions to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of domestic and international \naviation services. \n \n6. \nThe  Government  is  currently  addressing  the  aviation  sector\u2019s  rehabilitation  and \ndevelopment needs required to support the rebound with financial and technical assistance from \nexternal  funding  agencies.  If  the  current  trend  in  development  is  to  be  sustainable,  the \nGovernment  needs  to  remove  as  many  as  possible  of  the  impediments  that  tend  to  suppress \nbusiness and consumer confidence. \n \nB. \n \n7. \nPrior  to  1989,  the  Ministry  of  Civil  Aviation  and  Tourism  (MCAT)  was  responsible  for \nairport operations and generally provided an airport manager and air traffic control staff for each \nairport. The Ministry of Public Works (MOPW) was responsible for airport design, construction, \nand  maintenance.  While  MCAT  is  currently  continuing  with  airport  management  at  all  airports \nand air traffic control at certain of the larger domestic airports, MOPW has not played a role in \nairports for many years. As a result, little airport maintenance work has been carried out since \n\nInstitutional Organization and Responsibilities \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24\n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n1989. MCAT currently has no capability to carry out either day-to-day or major, periodic airport \nmaintenance, but does intend to take over airport design, construction, and maintenance in the \nfuture. \n \nC. \n \n\nAirport Infrastructure and Supporting Services \n\n1. \n\nInfrastructure \n\n \nPublished  information  indicates  that  Afghanistan  had  47  airports  in  2002,  including \n8. \nseasonal landing strips in remote border areas, or roughly 1.63 airports per 1 million people. Of \nthese 47 airports, 10 were reported to have paved runways (with 3 of these located above 3,047 \nmeters),  while  the  remaining  37  have  gravel  runways.  The  country  also  has  five  heliports \nserving  military  and  humanitarian  needs.  However,  the  United  Nations  Joint  Logistics  Center \nonly recognizes 27 airports, of which only the following 13 receive commercial flights: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\ninternational (category I): Kabul, Kandahar; \nmajor domestic (category II): Herat, Kunduz, Jalalabad, Mazar-e-Sharif; \nregional  (category  III):  Bamyan,  Chaghcharan,  Faizabad,  Farah,  Maimana, \nTaloqan; and \nsubregional (category IV): Zaranj. \n\n \n9. \nBecause  of  the  restructuring  of  MCAT  and  a  reduction  in  the  agency\u2019s  personnel  and \nfinancial  resources,  regional  airstrips  are  not  being  maintained  and  are  being  allowed  to \ndeteriorate. This situation has serious implications for aircraft passenger and crew safety and for \nthe cost of operations.  \n \n10. \nThe Government has prepared a civil aviation and airport development plan, which is in \nline with International Civil Aviation Organization standards and recommendations and reflects \nthe priorities and strategy of MCAT. The plans includes \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nupgrading Kabul International Airport to full international standards, including the \nterminal building, facilities, and amenities, at a cost of approximately $100 million \nover 7 years; \nupgrading  the  international  terminals  at  Herat,  Jalalabad,  and  Mazar-e-Sharif  at \nan estimated cost of $50 million over 7 years; \nrehabilitating  the  two  major  domestic  airports  at  Kunduz  and  Faizabad  at  an \nestimated cost of $10 million each over 7 years; and \nrehabilitating  the  remaining  13  domestic  airports  in  two  phases  at  an  estimated \ncost of $5 million for each airport.  \n\n \n11. \nThe total cost of the plan is estimated at $375 million and is to be apportioned as follows: \nrunways,  30%;  terminals  and  required  facilities,  20%;  vehicles  and  equipment,  20%;  air  traffic \ncontrol, 15%; approach roads and parking, 10%; and aviation safety, 5%. \n \n12. \nThe  aim  is  for  all  airports  to  be  able  to  handle  more  landings,  thereby  generating \nsubstantial revenue for the Government, improving linkages, and allowing for faster travel to and \nfrom the rest of the world and between regional centers, which will increase tourist penetration. \n \n\n2. \n\nAir Navigation Services \n\n \n13. \nAll navigation, communication, landing aid, and meteorological facilities were destroyed \nduring  the  conflict.  NATO  currently  provides  air  traffic  control  services  at  Kabul  International \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n Appendix 2 \n\n25  \n\nAirport.  Only  daytime  flights  are  accepted  for  regional  services.  At  present,  no  facilities  for  air \ntraffic  management  exist  at  the  major  domestic  and  regional  airports.  There  is  also  an  acute \nshortage of qualified and trained air traffic controllers and maintenance personnel. \n \n14. \noverflying the country even though minimal information is provided to air crews. \n \n \n\nCurrently, MCAT levies a $400 charge on all international and inter-regional airline flights \n\n3. \n\nMeteorological Services \n\n \n15.  Meteorological services at Kabul and all other regional and domestic services are out of \nservice until International Security Assistance Force, and then NATO, install their own services. \nThere  is  an  urgent  need  to  install  and  train  specialists  in  the  operation  of  automatic  weather \nobservation  systems  at  the  two  international  airports  (Kabul  and  Kandahar)  and  the  four  main \ndomestic airports (Herat, Kunduz, Jalalabad, and Mazar-I-Sharif). \n \n\n4. \n\nSafety Oversight \n\n \n16. \nThe  civil  aviation  safety  orders  of  1972  do  not  provide  MCAT  with  clear  power  and \nauthority to regulate civil aviation, and therefore the authority to issue regulations, orders, and \ndirectives necessary to ensure the safety of aviation, i.e., those pertaining to security, accident \nand incident reporting, certification of airports, licensing of air traffic controllers, and certification \nof air operators. The authority over these areas is not institutionalized in the organization, which \ncan seriously hinder the sector\u2019s development. \n \n17. \nAirport  incursion  is  becoming  a  serious  problem  at  many  airstrips  and  is  likely  to \ncontinue. Airstrips are used for many community activities, but are primarily used as a means of \naccess,  especially  where  local  footpaths  and  vehicle  tracks  cross  runways  or  run  alongside \nthem.  This  is  a  matter  that  needs  to  be  addressed  to  reduce  the  probability  of  accidents  that \ncould be catastrophic for crews, passengers, and local bystanders. \n \n\n5. \n\nHuman Resources \n\n \n18. \nAviation in Afghanistan faces serious human resource challenges because of the lack of \nskilled  manpower.  To  be  sustainable  in  a  deregulated  market,  MCAT  and  other  aviation \nagencies will need to recruit and train suitable personnel if investment over the next 7 years is to \nbe  sustainable.  Like  in  many  other  developing  countries,  the  maintenance  and  upkeep  of \ninfrastructure and services is essential for supporting on-going improvements in efficiency and \nlowering utilization costs. \n \n19.  When new infrastructure comes on-stream starting at the end of 2005, properly staffing \nthe  airports  with  personnel  trained  in  airport  management,  operations,  maintenance,  fire \nfighting,  and  so  on  will  be  essential.  Hence  the  intensive  training  program  that  is  being \nundertaken as part of the Project. \n \nD. \n \n\nDomestic Civil Aviation \n\n1. \n\nMarket \n\n \n20. \nAt  this  early  stage  in  the  development  of  the  postwar,  domestic  aviation  sector,  the \nmarket served is predominantly humanitarian, but with a growing commercial sector. This is not \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26\n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nunexpected  after  a  prolonged  period  of  internal  conflict.  Much,  if  not  all,  of  the  road  network \ninfrastructure  has  deteriorated  to  such  an  extent  that  a  journey  by  road\u2014often  the  preferred \nchoice of nongovernment organizations (NGOs)\u2014is long and arduous; safety and security are \nstill major concerns, with many areas of the country still classified as serious security risk areas; \nand facilities available to travelers are basic or nonexistent. \n \n21. \nThe domestic aviation sector serves and supports the high-value, time-sensitive end of \nthe transport market. In 2000, up to 3,400 departures were recorded. During this early stage of \npostwar reconstruction, the market as a whole is characterized by widely varying load factors, \nfrequent long delays, and varying probability of a service cancellation depending on the security \nsituation and the operating environment of the destination airstrip (Table A2.1). \n \n\nTable A2.1: Representative Load Factors and Cancellation Rates, Project Airports \n\nAirport \nBamyan \nChaghcharan \nFaizabad \nFarah \nMaimana  \nQalai-Naw \nZaranj \nSource: Consultant\u2019s report. \n\nAverage Load Factor \n(%) \n60 \n20 \n40 \n10 \n  5 \n40 \n10 \n\nProbability of a Cancellation \n(%) \n  5 \n75 \n10 \n75 \n10 \n75 \n10 \n\n \n22. \nAircraft  currently  serving  regional  domestic  airports  out  of  Kabul  include  small-seater \nB190s, B200s, F28s, and others up to the 47-seater AN24. Although improving airstrip runways \nto International Civil Aviation Organization standards is unlikely in the near future, it would give \noperators  the  flexibility  to  change  their  technology  to  meet  market  demand  needs  more \nefficiently and be able to respond to changes in load factors. \n \n\n2. \n\nOperators \n\n \nPrior to 1989, air travel was a well-developed mode of transport in Afghanistan, popular \n23. \nwith tourists, Afghan business people, government officials, and other users with the money to \nfly.  Two  airlines  served  an  extensive  domestic  network  that  gave  access  to  the  main  cities  of \nmost provinces and to a number of smaller, isolated communities. \n \n24. \nBecause of the destruction of airport, navigation aid, and air traffic control infrastructure \nin the years of conflict, domestic air services are currently rudimentary. The state airline, Ariana \nAfghan  Airlines,  is  still  recovering  from  severe  losses  of  equipment  and  skilled  personnel,  but \nprovides  limited  domestic  services  from  Kabul  to  Herat,  Jalalabad,  Kandahar,  and  Mazar-e-\nSharif.  The  Boeing  B727  aircraft  used  by  Ariana  are  expensive  to  operate,  their  technology  is \nold, and they are too big for domestic services. \n \nUnited Nations agencies and NGOs started a network of domestic services immediately \n25. \nfollowing  the  commencement  of  international  assistance  to  Afghanistan  in  2002.  These \nservices,  operated  by  United  Nations  Humanitarian  Air  Services  (UNHAS),  the  United  Nations \nAssistance  Mission  to  Afghanistan  (UNAMA),  and  Partners  in  Aviation  Communications  and \nTechnology (PacTec), use small aircraft with 8 to 18 seats and chiefly cater to United Nations \nand  NGO  personnel.  UNHAS  will  continue  this  support  role  even  when  commercial  services \nbecome more widespread. UNHAS also operates a DC9 between Kabul and Dubai, Dushanbe, \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n Appendix 2 \n\n \n27 \n\nHerat,  Islamabad,  and  Kandahar,  while  UNAMA  has  one  or  two  An72  mixed  configuration \ncargo/passenger aircraft mainly for domestic use. \n \n26. \nKam  Air,  a  start-up  airline  that  began  operations  in  November  2003,  is  operating  both \ninternational and domestic services. Its domestic network currently serves six or eight airports \nusing 50-seat An24 aircraft. Indications already suggest that a large, untapped demand for air \nservices  exists,  which  can  only  be  met  by  developing  new  commercial  air  services.  Such \ndevelopment must be underpinned by the rehabilitation of airports and supporting infrastructure. \n \n27. \nA  number  of  corporate  charter  aircraft  also  operate  within  Afghanistan  and  nearby \ncountries. These are all small turboprops similar to the Beechcraft 200 and 1900s operated by \nUNHAS, UNAMA, and PacTec. Many large cargo aircraft fly into Kabul and Kandahar on both \ncivil  and  military  missions,  but  few  are  deployed  to  other  domestic  airports.  Nevertheless, \nmilitary C130 cargo aircraft regularly fly to some airports, including Bamyan. \n \nE. \n \n28. \nAs  in  all  industrial  and  many  developing  economies,  air  travel  will  continue  to  play  an \nessential role in Afghanistan. It can provide a safe, fast, comfortable, and convenient connection \nbetween  the  capital,  Kabul,  and  other  centers  of  commerce,  administration,  and  tourism.  As \nsuch, it can appeal to business people, government officials, international and domestic tourists, \nand  to  citizens  who  have  the  means  to  travel  for  personal  reasons.  Air  cargo  is  also  an \nimportant  factor,  enabling  the  delivery  of  urgent  supplies  and  exports  of  high\u2013value,  low\u2013\nvolume,  manufactured or  perishable  products. Air  also  provides  rapid access  for humanitarian \naid to areas that might be devastated by natural disasters, famine, epidemics, and the like and \nfor the evacuation of the sick and injured. When the country returns to relative stability and the \nnormal processes of nation building commence, unfettered by security concerns and uncertainty \nabout the future, civil aviation will become even more important to the national economy. \n \n\nOpportunities for Improving Airport Efficiency \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\n \n\nOUTLINE OF PRELIMINARY DESIGN OF RUNWAYS AND REQUIRED EQUIPMENT  \n \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe  Project  includes  rehabilitating  runways,  taxiways,  aprons,  offices,  and  passenger \n1. \nterminals and supplying equipment for navigation aids and airport maintenance at seven regional \nairports in Bamian, Chaghcharan, Faizabad, Farah, Maimana, Qalai-Naw, and Zaranj.  \n \nThe runways of these airports have deteriorated to the extent that they have no standard \n2. \nasphalt pavement and insufficient runway strips. These poor physical conditions, along with  the \nlack of navigation aids, have limited aircraft operations and increased the risk of accidents. \n \nAll  seven  airports  also  lack  the  basic  facilities  for  civil  aviation,  such  as  water  and \n3. \nelectricity  supply,  security  fences,  and  maintenance  equipment.  For  minimum  commercial \noperations, existing passenger terminals need  to  be  renovated  at  four  of  the  airports and new \npassenger terminals are required at the other three.  \n \n As required by the terms of reference for the project preparatory technical assistance1, \n4. \nthe  consultant  conducted  the  feasibility  study  for  the  project  airports  and  prepared  preliminary \ndesigns.  The  consultant  designed  infrastructure  and  equipment  in  accordance  with  the \nrecommendations of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for airport infrastructure, \nmovement  area  design,  and  operational  equipment.  ICAO  has  developed  standards  and \nrecommended practices to ensure the safety and efficiency of air transport and airport facilities.  \n \nThe principal recommendations are that the Project should provide \n\n(i)  \n\nAirport facilities: \n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \n(e) \n(f) \n\npaved runways that are as maintenance free as possible,  \nrunway strips at least 90 meters wide, \npassenger terminal buildings and basic security,  \nstock-proof boundary fencing, \nwater supply and sewerage facilities, and \nmaintenance equipment for facilities and structures.  \n\n       \n\n \n(ii)  \n\nOperational facilities: \n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \n(e) \n\ncontrol towers, \nautomatic weather observation systems,  \nprecision approach path indicators, \nother visual aids to identify runways when visibility is poor (Zaranj), and \ngenerators. \n\n \nPhysical Dimensions  \n\nB.  \n \n\n1.  \n\nDimension of Runway and Runway Strips \n\n \nAs the seven airports are categorized as regional airports in accordance with designation \n5. \n3C of the  ICAO code, it is recommended that  runways be at least 30 meters wide  and runway \nstrips be 90 meters to 150 meters wide as indicated in Table A3.1 \n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2003.

Nevertheless,  some  runways  will  be  shortened  because of  physical  restrictions  to  the \nextent which is required for the operation of each design aircraft as indicated in Table A3.2. \n \n \n\nTable A3.2: Runway Length of Each Airport  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nAirport \n\nBamyan  \n\nChaghcharan \n\nFaizabad \n\nMaimana \n\nQalai-Naw \n\nFarah \n\nZaranj \nm = meter. \nSource: Consultant\u2019s report. \n \n\n \n\nRunway Length  \n(m) \n\nExisting \n\nProposed  \n\n(30 m wide) \n\n2,590 \n\n1,950 \n\n2,000 \n\n2,000 \n\n2,100 \n\n2,600 \n\n1,800 \n\n2,450 \n\n1,880 \n\n2,000 \n\n2,000 \n\n1,880 \n\n2,000 \n\n2,000 \n\nPaved Stopway  \n(30 m wide) \n\n60 m each end \n\n60 m each end \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n \n30 \n\n \n\n \n\n2.  \n\nPavement Design  \n\n \n7. \nThe thickness of pavement for each airport is designed taking into account the aircraft to \nbe  used,  the  expected number of flights,  and the  bearing  capacity  of  the  subgrade  under  the \npavement. For Bamian, Chaghcharan, Farah,  Maimana, and Qalai-Naw airports, where existing \ngravel  runways  can  be  considered  as  sub-base courses,  a  total  pavement  thickness  of  200 \nmillimeters is recommended, of which 50 millimeters is an asphalt concrete wearing course over \na base course of 150 millimeters of highest quality crushed rock.  \n\n \n\nEquipment  \n\n8. \nFaizabad Airport needs a new runway parallel to the existing one,  because it is covered \nby steel panels. The runway at Zaranj Airport has no pavement and subgrade, and the condition \nof  the  soil  is  worse  than  at  the  other  airports.  Therefore  thicker  total  pavements  of  550 \nmillimeters  and  1,000  millimeters  are  recommended  at  Faizabad  and  Zaranj  airports, \nrespectively. \n \nC.  \n \n9. \nIn relation to navigation aids, precision approach path indicator systems will be provided \nat  the  seven airports to assist  with  landings.  The  system\u2019s  lights boxes, located  alongside  the \ntouchdown  point,  will  give  pilots  an  approach  slope  indication.  In  addition,  flashing  strobe \nthreshold identifications and runway lead-in lighting will be installed at Zaranj airport  because of \nits permanent low visibility during the summer. Standard windsocks and masts will be provided \nto  indicate  wind  direction.  Automatic  weather  observation  systems  will  be  installed  and \nconnected to the control towers for real-time monitoring of meteorological conditions. \n \n10. \nAs concerns maintenance  equipment,  to maintain  the  runways,  the  Project  will  provide \nsweepers  for  snow  and  stones,  tractors  and  compactors  for  surface  repair  work,  and  other \nequipment.

Under  this  system,  capital  expenditure  incurred  on  a  project  is  presented  as \nexpenditure  in  the  year  of  occurrence  and  cumulative  numbers  are  not  available.  Therefore \nascertaining the true value of airport assets is difficult. Depreciation is not accounted for in the \nGovernment accounting system. Revenues from scheduled flights are directly collected by the \ntreasury  of  MOF.  Revenues  from  nonscheduled  flights  are  collected  by  the  airports  and \ndeposited in the treasury of MOF. Given this particular accounting system, and more important, \nbecause  of  the  loss  of  records  during  the  conflict  in  recent  decades,  assessing  the  financial \nsituation  of  civil  aviation  activities  accurately,  especially  for  individual  airports  and  services,  is \nvirtually impossible. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n38 \n \n\n \n\n4. \nActual  expenditures  airports  incur  against  their  budget  allocations  are  not  always \nreported to MCAT in a timely fashion. The main reason for this is that the major, regional, and \nsubregional airports fall under the administrative jurisdiction of the governors of provinces, and \nthus  the  financial  allocations  are  transferred  to  the  respective  governors.  Furthermore,  the \nreporting system for expenditures is poor, and hence actual expenditure figures for the various \nairports,  and  also  for  the  entire  civil  aviation  sector,  are  not  readily  available  in  MCAT.  In  the \ncase of revenues, MCAT bills scheduled airlines for landing, parking, and air traffic services, but \nfor  nonscheduled  flights,  unless  arrangements  are  made  ahead  of  time,  the  airport  operators \nnormally  collect  the  charges  in  cash  and  MCAT  does  not  always  obtain  complete,  timely \ninformation about deposits from airport operators. Thus aggregate revenue figures by airport are \nnot available, and as a result, MCAT does not have accurate numbers for actual expenditures \non and revenues from civil aviation operations.  \n \n5. \nThis poor financial management capacity is pervasive in all sectors in Afghanistan. The \nWorld  Bank  and  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  are  providing  assistance  to \nstrengthen public administration and improve public accounting at the central Government level. \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance for Capacity Building for MCAT, programmed for 2005, will support \nthe  redesign  and  upgrading  of  MCAT\u2019s  accounting  system.  In  the  short  term,  the  project \nmanagement  consultants  to  be  engaged  by  the  Project  will  set  up  an  accounting  system  for \nproject implementation and airport operations. MCAT staff will be trained in this new system fas \npart of the project assistance for postconstruction operations.  \n \nB. \n \n6. \nTable  A9.2  shows  operational  revenues  and  expenditures  for  civil  aviation  for  2003\u2013\n2004.  During  this  period,  the  revenues  generated  by  civil  aviation  activities  substantially \nexceeded operational expenditures, generating a surplus of more than $17 million. Almost the \nentire  surplus  came  from  overflying  charges;  however,  even  without  the  overflying  charge, \noperating  revenues  can  cover  operating  expenditures.  Furthermore,  overflights  are  increasing. \nHowever,  the  surplus  will  decline  substantially  when  operating  revenues  are  spent  on \nrehabilitation and development of facilities and services at airports and on training existing staff \nand recruiting qualified new staff.  \n \n7. \nforecast  operating  revenues  and \nexpenditures  for  the  civil  aviation  sector  in  Afghanistan  as  part  of  its  preparation  of  a  civil \naviation  master  plan  funded  by  ADB  technical  assistance.  The  forecast  is  based  on  the \nassumption  that  airport  operations  will  be  normalized  so  as  to  finance  investment  and  human \nresource  development  with  funds  generated  by  civil  aviation  activities.  Table  9.3  presents  the \nforecast for revenues and expenditures.  \n \n8. \nThe  forecast  for  revenues  and  expenditures  indicates  that  the  civil  aviation  sector  is \nfinancially  self-sustainable  in  the  short  term,  medium  term,  and  long  term.  However,  if  the \noverflying charges were not allocated to the civil aviation sector, the sector would suffer from a \nlack  of  investment  in  rehabilitation  and  the  development  of  airport  infrastructure  that  would \ndamage the sector\u2019s self-sustainability in the long-term. \n\nFinancial Sustainability of the Civil Aviation Sector \n\nInternational  Civil  Aviation  Organization \n\nThe \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                         Appendix 9         39\n\nTable A9.2: Operational Revenues and Expenditures for Civil Aviation, \n2003\u20132004 \n\n \n\nItem \nRevenue \n\nLanding Charge \nParking Charge \nRoute Navagation Services \nPassenger Service Charge \nNon-Aeronautical Revenue \nLicence Fee, etc \n        Subtotal \nOver-Flying Charge \n\nExpenditures \nSalaries \nOthers  \n\nTotal Expenditures\n\nAfghani\n\nDollars\n\n44,850\n\n11,435\n\n1,456,823\n\n1,800\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n36,840,581\n\n15,990,273\n\n52,830,854\n\n623,724\n\n365,326\n\n227,800\n\n70,813\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nTotal \n($) \n\n624,621\n\n365,555\n\n227,800\n\n29,136\n\n70,813\n\n36\n\n1,317,961\n\n17,136,400\n\n18,454,361\n\n736,812\n\n319,805\n\n1,056,617\n\n1,514,908\n\n1,287,663\n\n17,136,400\n\nTotal Revenue \n\n1,514,908\n\n18,424,063\n\n          Source: Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism and Ministry of Finance data. \n\n \nTable A9.3: Forecast Operational Revenues and Expenditures of the Civil Aviation \nSector, Selected Years \n($) \n\nItem\n\nRevenue\n\nLanding Charge\n\nParking Charge\n\nRoute Navagation Services\n\nPassenger Service Charge\n\nNon-Aeronautical Revenue\n\nLicence Fee, etc\n\n        Subtotal\n\n2004\n\n2008\n\n2013\n\n624,621\n\n365,555\n\n227,800\n\n29,136\n\n70,813\n\n36\n\n876,900\n\n401,500\n\n290,700\n\n1,066,900\n\n452,000\n\n353,700\n\n2,700,000\n\n3,567,200\n\n442,000\n\n897,500\n\n50\n\n80\n\n1,317,961\n\n4,711,150\n\n6,337,380\n\nOver-Flying Charge\n\n17,136,400\n\n21,870,900\n\n27,913,400\n\nTotal Revenue\n\n18,454,361\n\n26,582,050\n\n34,250,780\n\nExpenditures\n\nSalaries\n\nOperation and Maintenance\n\n736,812\n\n319,805\n\n1,171,900\n\n3,000,000\n\n2,197,300\n\n5,000,000\n\nCapital Investments\n\n0\n\n15,000,000\n\n25,000,000\n\nTotal Expenditure\n\n1,056,617\n\n19,171,900\n\n32,197,300\n\nSource: International Civil Aviation Organization forecast. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n40 \n \n\n \n\nFinancial Analysis  \n\nC. \n \n9. \nThe  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  was  estimated  using  a  with  Project  and \nwithout Project comparison. The major assumptions are that (i) the FIRR reflects constant 2004 \nprices,  (ii)  the  capital  costs  include  all  incremental  capital  expenditures  associated  with  the \nproposed  investment  program  less  interest  charges  during  construction,  (iii)  the  costs  of \nincremental operations and maintenance include periodic maintenance that will be carried out in \nthe  year  of  2019,  (iv)  the  projections  used  to  derive  airport  revenue  streams  were  developed \nspecifically for forecasting aircraft movements and passenger volumes, (v) the tariffs at airports \nwith higher volumes will be adjusted when costs equal revenues, and (vi) the revenue and cost \nstreams are compared for a 30-year period with no residual value. The expenditure components \nof the analysis include the initial capital costs, recurrent annual costs, and periodic maintenance \ncosts.  Included  in  expenditures  is  the  cost  of  staffing  airports  with  managers,  administrative \nstaff, cleaners, and maintenance staff.  \n \nThe  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  was  calculated  as  4%  in  line  with  the \n10. \nminimum  requirement  as  set  out  in  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Financial  Governance  and \nManagement of Investment Projects Financed by ADB. The FIRR for the seven project airports \nranges 3.7% to 7.9%, with an aggregate FIRR of 5.0% (Table 9.4). \n \n11. \nSensitivity analysis was carried out to test the effects of possible unfavorable changes in \nkey parameters that determine the Project\u2019s costs and revenues. The results are shown in Table \nA9.5.  \n\n \nTable A9.4: Financial Internal Rate of Return by Airport \n\nAirport\n\nBamyan\n\nChaghcharan\n\nFaizabad\n\nFarah\n\nMaimana\n\nQalai-Naw\n\nZaranj\n\n      Aggregate\n\nFIRR (%)\n\n4.6\n\n3.7\n\n7.9\n\n4.4\n\n4.5\n\n4.3\n\n3.7\n\n5.0\n\nFIRR = financial internal rate of return \nSource: Consultant\u2019s estimates. \n\n \n \n \n12. \nTwo airports, Chaghcharan and Zaranj, have an FIRR slightly lower than the WACC. As \nindicated  earlier,  the  civil  aviation  sector  is  in  general  financially  self-sustainable  in  the  short, \nmedium, and long term. The two airports whose FIRR is lower than the WACC show a robust \neconomic internal rate of return. The implication is that national resources are transferred to the \nusers  of  these  two  airports  in  the  form  of  a  subsidy.  If  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is \nhigher  than  the  threshold  and  the  two  airports  are  a  Government  priority  for  investment  to \nprovide better access to local users of air transport services, the subsidy can be justified as long \nas the aviation sector is financially self-sustainable. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                         Appendix 9        \n\n41\n\nTable A9.5: Sensitivity Analysis \n\nChange\n\nFIRR (%)\n\n10%\n\n10%\n\n1 year\n\n5.0\n\n4.4\n\n4.2\n\n4.8\n\nSensitivity Item\n\nBase Case\n\nCost Increase\n\nRevenue Decrease\n\nImplementation Delay\n\n \n\n \nR\n\n \n\nFI R = financial internal rate of return. \nSource: Consultant\u2019s estimates. \n\nTable A9.6: Financial Internal Rate of Return 2005-2034\n(AF million)\n\nYear\n\nCapital\n\nIncremental\nOperating\n\nLanding \nCharges\n\nParking\nCharges\n\nNet\nRevenues\n\nIncremental Revenues\nPassenger \nService \nCharges\n\nCosts\n\n245.8\n491.5\n245.8\n\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n240.6\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n\n5.1\n5.5\n5.9\n6.4\n7.1\n7.8\n8.5\n9.4\n10.3\n11.2\n12.1\n13.0\n14.1\n15.2\n16.4\n17.7\n18.8\n20.1\n21.5\n23.0\n24.6\n26.3\n28.2\n30.2\n32.3\n34.6\n37.1\n39.7\n\n14.7\n15.9\n17.1\n18.4\n20.1\n22.0\n24.2\n26.5\n29.1\n31.3\n33.8\n36.4\n39.2\n42.3\n45.6\n49.2\n52.1\n55.4\n58.9\n62.7\n66.6\n70.9\n75.4\n80.2\n85.3\n90.7\n96.6\n102.9\n\n11.7\n12.6\n13.5\n14.6\n15.9\n17.5\n19.1\n21.0\n23.0\n24.8\n26.0\n27.2\n28.0\n28.2\n28.5\n28.7\n28.9\n28.9\n28.9\n28.9\n28.9\n28.9\n28.9\n28.9\n28.9\n28.9\n28.9\n28.9\n\n-245.75\n-491.51\n-215.69\n32.47\n35.06\n37.87\n41.65\n45.81\n50.39\n55.42\n60.94\n65.82\n70.32\n75.18\n-159.29\n84.26\n89.04\n94.18\n98.39\n102.97\n107.88\n113.12\n118.71\n124.67\n131.04\n137.83\n145.08\n152.82\n161.17\n170.07\n\n146.9\n\n5.0\n\nFinancial Net Present Value\n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return (%)\nSource: Consultant\u2019s report. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\n\n \n\n\f42\n\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\n Introduction \n\n \nA. \n \nPrior  to  1989,  air  travel  was  a  well-developed  transport  mode  in  Afghanistan,  popular \n1. \nwith tourists and Afghan business people, government officials, and others. Two airlines served \nan extensive domestic network that provided access to the main cities of most provinces and a \nnumber of smaller, isolated communities. Because of the destruction of airport, navigational aid, \nand  air  traffic  control  infrastructure  in  the  years  of  conflict,  domestic  air  services  are \nrudimentary. Currently the condition of regional airports is such that it only allows for restricted \noperations,  and  these  are  often  curtailed  by  poor  airstrip  condition,  poor  visibility,  and  the \nabsence of adequate terminal conditions and security. \n \n2. \nThe Project will help Afghanistan address its domestic needs for aviation development. \nDuring  phase  I  of  the  Project,  rehabilitation  work  will  be  carried  at  seven  regional  airports: \nBamyan,  Chaghcharan,  Farah,  Faizabad,  Maimana,  Qalai-Naw,  and  Zaranj.  The  proposed \nupgrading and improvement works will include the following:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nlevel 1: constructing perimeter fences to improve airstrip safety and the efficiency \nof air service operators;  \nlevel  2:  reducing  the  substantial  cost  of  aircraft  maintenance  and  repairs  by \nupgrading gravel pavement to asphalt standard; and \nlevel  3:  constructing  adequate  terminal  and  airport  operation  facilities,  including \ncontrol towers. \n\n Traffic Forecasts \n\n \n3. \nThe  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  enhance  civil  aviation  infrastructure  to  support \nreliable and safe operations in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) \nstandards  across  all  major  and  minor  airports  in  the  country.  Bringing  these  airports  up  to \nstandard  will  (i)  remove  infrastructure  constraints  on  the  growth  of  domestic  air  services;  (ii) \nreduce  airlines\u2019  operational  costs;  (iii)  improve  air  safety;  (iv)  assist  the  development  of \ncommercial,  agricultural,  and  tourism  activities  in  the  Project  areas  and  improve  market \nconnections;  (v)  facilitate  the  provision  of  much  needed  humanitarian  aid  and  basic  public \nservices  to  remote  regions;  and  (vi)  improve  the  access  of  local  communities  to  social \nservices\u2014medical, educational, and administrative\u2014and to better job opportunities. \n \nB. \n \n4. \nAccording  to  1980  passenger  and  freight  statistics,  the  number  of  domestic  arrivals \narrivals  and  departures  recorded  at  17  airports  amounted  to  more  than  125,000  passengers. \nEven  though  the  traffic  figures  provide  limited  information  about  load  factors,  seasonality, \nnumber of services, and market trends, they do provide a snapshot of the size of the market and \nits development by 1980. Currently no comparable statistics are available to determine the size \nof the aviation market and the share of each airport. \n \nMany observers argue that postconflict countries tend to exhibit above normal economic \n5. \ngrowth that typically peaks some time from the fourth to the seventh year of peace. The period \nof  catch-up  growth  dissipates  over  time  as  the  economy  reverts  to  a  longer-term  growth  rate. \nThe  delayed  onset  of  relatively  high  economic  growth  after  conflict  probably  reflects  the  time \nneeded  for  business  and  investor  confidence  to  be  restored  and  for  the  institutional  and \ninfrastructure base of the economy to be rebuilt. Afghanistan\u2019s prospects for a strong economic \nrecovery look promising, even in the short run, provided that certain preconditions in relation to \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n  Appendix 10          43\n\nsecurity,  the  Government\u2019s  continued  commitment  to  sound  economic  management,  and \ncontinued donor support are met. \n \n6. \nBecause little or no primary data are available for the postwar domestic aviation sector, \ntwo  sets  of  surveys  were  conducted  in  June  and  July  2004  to  obtain  information  from  both \npassengers  using  regional  airports  and  operators  serving  such  airports.  A  team  at  Kabul \nInternational Airport surveyed all departing domestic passengers. In the case of passengers at \nother  airports,  one  operator  agreed  to  assist  by  conducting  on-board  surveys  of  passengers \ntraveling between regional airstrips and flight crews handed out and collected  questionnaires. A \npilot study was conducted in the second week of July prior to undertaking a full scale survey.   \n \n7. \nThe  forecasting  methodology  used  in  this  analysis  follows  that  recomended  by  the  US \nFederal Aviation Administration. It looks at aircraft movements and then uses seating capacity \nand  load  factors  to  forecast  annual  passenger  arrival  and  departure  volumes.  Data  from \npublished  operator  schedules,  operator  surveys,  and  historic  airport  movement  data  for  Kabul \nInternational Airport were used as the primary source for establishing current levels of demand \nfor each regional airstrip. In practice, however, the number of actual flights is likely to differ from \nwhat operators publish in their timetables. This is one of the reasons for the slow development \nof the market, that is, it is due principally to operators canceling flights because of poor visibility, \nunexpected passenger cancellations and no-shows, low load factors, and security issues. \n \n8. \nA draft civil aviation master plan prepared by  by ICAO provides estimates for three long-\nterm growth scenarios (high, most likely, and low) for both  aircraft movements and passenger \nnumbers for regional airports based on traffic data for 1993 (raw data not provided). Two sets of \nforecasts have been developed based on a review of the ICAO estimates and discussions with \nthe  Government,  operators,  and  likely  users  (Table  A10.1).  These  forecasts  represent  a  with \nproject scenario and a without -project scenario as follows: \n  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nAn  unconstrained  scenario  in  which  the  economy  rebounds  and  exhibits  strong \npostwar  growth;  the  Government  pushes  ahead  with  reforms  to  improve  the \nsector\u2019s efficiency, safety, and reliability; investment in domestic and international \nairports  is  a  Government  priority  and  receives  support  from  external  funding \nagencies;  and  (iv)  consumer  confidence  returns  and  operators  expand  their \ncapacity to meet demand. \nA  constrained  scenario  where  reform  of  the  aviation  sector  (including  delays  in \nthe  program \nto  upgrade  domestic  airports)  does  not  keep  pace  with \neconomywide  infrastructure  development  in  the  major  population  centers, \nthereby affecting operator and consumer confidence. Postconflict growth is also \nsuppressed  as  a  result  of  the  security  situation,  which  continues  to  depress \nbusiness  and  consumer  confidence  and  private  investment  in  economic \ndevelopment. Gross domestic product growth is dampened because of reduced \ninvestor  interest  in  infrastructure  development  and  operators  postpone  capacity \nexpansion. \n\n \n\n\f44\n\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n\n \nPeriod \n\n \n2004\u20132005 \n2004\u20132008 \n2009\u20132013 \n2014\u20132020 \n2021\u20132033 \n \n\nTable A10.1: Aircraft Movement Growth Projections, 2004\u20132034 \n\nWithout-Project  Scenario \n(%) \n\n             With-Project Scenario \n         (%) \n\n \n2  \n4  \n5 \n4 \n4 \n\n \n\n2 \n8 \n10 \n8 \n6 \n\n       Source: Consultant\u2019s estimates. \n\nCosts \n\n \nC. \n \nThe financial costs of the subprojects consist of all incremental capital expenditures, but \n9. \nexclude  price  contingencies  and  interest  and  other  charges  during  construction.  The \nincremental  operation  and  maintenance  costs  of  the  project  facilities  were  estimated  on  the \nbasis of cost parameters developed by the consultant. The Project\u2019s economic costs include the \nresource  costs  for  traded  and  nontraded  costs,  materials,  and  labor.  All  costs  elements  are \nvalued  at  border  prices,  using  a  world  price  numeraire,  with  all  taxes  and  duties  excluded.  A \nstandard  conversion  factor  of  0.8  was  applied  to  the  financial  costs  of  nontraded  inputs  to \ncalculate  economic  prices.  Table  A10.2  presents  economic  costs  for  each  airport.  Subproject \nfacilities are expected to have an average economic life of 30 years.  \n \n\nTable A10.2: Phase I Economic Costs, 2004 Market Prices  \n(AF million) \n \n\nAirport                  \nBamyan              \nChaghcharan \nFaizabad \nMaimana \nQalai-Naw \nZaranj \nFarah \n\nTotal \n\nCost \n \n180 \n112 \n159 \n110 \n105 \n118 \n121 \n905 \n\n     Source: Consultant\u2019s estimates. \n\nBenefits \n\n \nD. \n \n10. \nThe  Project  is  aimed  primarily  at  improving  aviation  operation  and  safety  standards  by \nrehabilitating  existing  facilities  heavily  damaged  during  the  conflict  period,  including  runways, \ntaxiways, and aprons; terminal buildings; and navigation equipment. The most important project \nbenefits would be those associated with improved aviation safety. To measure project benefits, \nthe willingness to pay approach has been applied to estimate incremental airport revenues for \nairside and landside operations. Other economic benefits considered for economic analysis are \n(i)    aircraft  operating  cost  savings  accrued  from  nonincremental  movement  of  traffic,  (ii) \npassenger  time  savings  accrued  from  nonincremental  movement  of  traffic,  (iii)  benefits  from \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n  Appendix 10          45\n\nsafety  improvements,  and  (iv)  benefits  to  regional  and  local  communities  from  promoting \ntourism. A standard conversion factor of 0.8 was applied to the financial value of the benefits to \ncalculate their economic value.  \n  \nThe benefits to operators are substantial in terms of improvements to aircraft productivity \n11. \nfrom  reduced  maintenance  downtime;  elimination  of  costs  associated  with  damage  to  aircraft \ncaused by flying stones from gravel runways (external instruments, wing flaps, propeller blades, \nengines); and reduced cost of tire replacement by extending the operational life of tires. Gravel \nrunways have lower coefficients of friction than bitumen runways, meaning that aircraft landing \non  a  gravel  surface  take  longer  to  stop  because  of  reduced  braking  efficiency,  thus  bitumen \nrunways improve fuel efficiency. The Project will also severely diminish the risk (and economic \ncosts)  of  accidents  and  other  incidents  caused  by  airstrip  incursions,  which  are  increasingly \nbecoming a safety hazard because of poor regional airstrip conditions and poor visibility. \n \n12. \nPassengers will benefit from improved arrival and departure reliability, savings on travel \ntime (valued in terms of the economic value of time) and on diminished risk of flight cancellation \nor diversion, and safety improvements calculated on the basis of risk reduction of a catastrophic \naccident.1 The confidence of travelers is currently significantly affected by uncontrolled airstrips, \npoor visibility, and a poor record of on time arrivals and departures..  \n \nAt  the  regional  and  local  community  levels,  other  than  direct  labor  benefits  related  to \n13. \nairport construction and operation, the economy could enjoy significant secound-round benefits \nfrom  tourism.  Calculations  have  assumed  that  airports  will  receive  some  foreign  and  national \ntourist  traffic,  though  field  trip  observations  clearly  indicate  that  some  areas  have  significantly \nmore  potential  for  attracting  tourists  than  others.  Consequently,  a  forecast  based  on \nconservative assumptions was developed to calculate the benefits. It is estimated that only 50 \npercent  of  tourism  expenditure  represents  the  real  cost  of  consumption  of  locally  produced \ngoods  and  services  and  return  on  local  investments.  On  this  basis,  it  is  estimated  that  about \n$110  per  tourist  represents  the  real  net  benefit  from  tourists  arriving  by  air.  The  long-term \nbenefits to the community are conservative, because they would also include the benefits from \nadditional jobs that would not be created if the airports had not been upgraded. \n \nE. \n \n15. \nAviation forecasts have been estimated for 30 years. The residual value after 30 years is \nassumed to be zero. The benefits and costs of the Project occur as an annual stream, occurring \nat different points in time as benefits start after expenditures have been completed\u2014in this case \n2005 for phase I projects. All costs and benefits used for the analysis of tphase I airports are in \nconstant 2004 values. \n \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the seven airports varies between 18.0% \n16. \nand 28.4%, with a consolidated EIRR of 22.2%, indicating that the Project is economically viable \n(Table A10.3). The cost and benefit stream table for the consolidated EIRR is in Supplementary \nAppendix D.  \n \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis \n\n                                                 \n1  Based  on  risk  factors  for  different  types  of  airstrips,  the  current  risk  of  a  catastrophic  accident  would  be  reduced \nfrom 10-5 to 10-7 in an operating hour, or one accident in 10 million operating hours. \n\n\f46\n\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nTable A10.3: Economic Internal Rate of Return and Net Present Value \n\n \n\n \n\n \nAirport \nBamyan                           \n \nChaghcharan \n \nFaizabad \n \nFarah \n \nMaimana \n \nQalai Naw \nZaranj \n \n \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n         Economic Internal Rate of Return \n(%) \n28.4 \n18.5 \n18.7 \n27.4 \n18.5 \n18.0 \n18.4 \n \n22.2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n297.8 \n62.4 \n71.3 \n243.8 \n62.5 \n54.5 \n65.8 \n\n858.1 \n\nNet Present Value\n                            (AF million) \n\nSource: Consultant\u2019s estimates. \n \n17. \nIn addition to the base case, the following four sensitivity test cases were examined: (i) \nthe  construction  costs  increase  by  20%,  (ii)  the  benefits  are  reduced  by  20%,  (iii)  the  costs \nincrease  by  20%  and  the  benefits  are  reduced  by  20%,  and  (iv)  the  construction  period \nlengthens  by  2  years.  Table  A10.4  summarizes  the  EIRRs  for  the  base  case  and  sensitivity \ncases.  The  Project  remains  economically  viable  under  the  adverse  scenarios  tested.  The \neconomic viability is quite robust, because the EIRR values are well above 12% in the sensitivity \nanalysis cases.  \n \n\nTable A10.4: Economic Internal Rate of Return Values for the Base Case and Sensitivity \nAnalysis Cases \n\nScenario \n \nBase Case \n \nSensitivity Tests \n\n1.

Based  on  the  analysis,  it  was  estimated  that \nconstruction  costs  would  need  to  be  more  than  112%  higher  or  benefits  would  have  to  be \nreduced  by  more  than  53%  over  the  total  period  of  the  project  to  have  an  EIRR  of  less  than \n12%. This demonstrates, once again, the robustness of the Project. \n\nEconomic Internal \nRate of Return (%) \n \n22.2 \n\n \n19.3 \n \n18.7 \n\n16.2 \n\n17.8 \n\n\f Appendix 11    47 \n\n  \n\n \n\nSHORT RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n\nBackground \n\nProject Description and Impacts \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nRegional  airports  are  an  important  mode  of  communication  in  Afghanistan  and  are \ngenerally  the  only  mode  whereby  the  various  international  and  national  agencies  working \ntoward  the  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  this  war-torn  country  can  carry  out  their \ndevelopment  activities.  The  intent  of  this  Project  is  to  rehabilitate  at  least  18  airports  in  2 \nphases. Phase I will be financed in 2004 and phase II will be taken up under loan financing in \n2006.  Phase  I  will  cover  seven  regional  airports:  Bamyan,  Chaghcharan,  Faizabad,  Farah, \nMaymana, Qalai Naw, and Zaranj.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe Project envisages the following activities: (i) developing paved runways 30 meters \nwide  and  2,000  meters  long;  (ii)  establishing  graded  runway  strips  of  90  meters  and  flyover \nareas outside this of up to 150 meters wherever feasible; (iii) constructing aprons and taxiways; \nand  (iv)  renovating  or  constructing  passenger  terminal  buildings,  control  towers,  fire  stations, \nand  maintenance  garages  with  such  basic  amenities  as  electricity  and  water  supply  and \nsanitation facilities.  \n \n3. \nMost of the rehabilitation work will be carried out on land already owned by the Ministry \nof  Civil  Aviation  and  Tourism  (MCAT),  but  will  involve  some  minimal  acquisition  of  residential \nstructures,  and  a  few  households  currently  cultivating  Government  land  will  suffer  temporary \nlosses  of  income.  The  study  included  the  90  meters  width  required  to  establish  a  graded \nrunaway strip for assessing the Project\u2019s social impacts. All the structures and land within this \nwidth  were  examined  and  a  detailed  socio-economic  survey  was  conducted.  The  social \nassessment and public consultation has been carried out for all seven airports in phase I and a \nsample  socioeconomic  survey  was  conducted  at  three  regional  airports,  namely,  Bamyan, \nFaizabad,  and  Qalai-Naw.  However,  if  the  scope  of  the  Project  changes  during  detailed \nengineering design, MCAT will submit an updated resettlement plan to the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) for approval prior to the award of civil works contracts.  \n \n4. \nThe short resettlement plan addresses the  Project\u2019s impact and outlines the measures \nto be taken, including the resettlement of affected persons in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  and  the  Handbook  on  Involuntary  Resettlement:  A  Guide  to  Good \nPractice.  MCAT  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  this  Project.  All  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement activities will be carried out prior to the award of civil works contracts.  \n \nC. \n \n5. \n\nSocial impacts are presented in Table A11.1.   \n\nSurveys and Data Analysis \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \nAirport \n\nNumber of \nStructures Affected \n\n48 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nBamyan \nChaghcharan \nFaizabad \nFarah \nMaymana \nQalai Naw \nZaranj \nTotal \n\n11 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n26 \n15 \n42 \n\nTable A11.1: Project Impacts  \n\nNumber of \nHouseholds Affected \n11 \n0 \n5 \n0 \n0 \n25 \n15 \n               56 \n\n(196 affected \npersons) \n\nNumber of Community \nStructures Affected \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n1 mosque \n0 \n1 \n\nExtent of Land \nAcquisition \n2 ha of homestead \nland and 0.8 ha of \ngovernment- owned \nagricultural land \n\n  \n\n2.8 \n\nSource: Socio-economic Survey (SES), July 2004.  \n \n \nTable  A11.1  clearly  shows  that  of  the  seven  airports,  the  Project  will  only  have  land \n6. \nacquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  at  four  airports.  It  will  affect  42  permanent  residential \nstructures  (whose  owners  are  titleholders),  as  a  result  of  which  the  Project  will  also  have  to \nacquire nearly 2 hectares (ha) of homestead land. In addition, 0.8 ha of agricultural land owned \nby  the  Agriculture  Department  will  have  to  be  transferred  to  MCAT.  One  mosque  will  be \naffected, and five squatter households currently cultivating Government owned agricultural land \nwill suffer income losses, but will not lose any structures. The total number of those affected is \n196 people in 56 households. \n \n7. \nAll the households losing residential structures claimed that they were legal titleholders, \nalthough  they  do  not  posses  any  ownership  records.  At  Qalai  Naw,  the  0.8  hectare  of \nagricultural  land  owned  by  the  Agriculture  Department  is  being  used  by  a  private  agency  for \nagricultural research. Consultations were carried out with the agency, and it has asked that it be \ngiven  sufficient  time  to  relocate  the  plants  and  crops  being  grown  on  this  land  before \nacquisition,  but  does  not  require  any  compensation  for  the  harvest.  Discussions  with  local \nadministrations revealed that the Government has decided to move people living in the vicinity \nof the airports for their own safety and that of aircraft. In Qalai Naw, the local administration has \nbeen  giving  periodic  warnings  and  notices  to  people  to  move  before  any  major  accident  or \nuntoward  incident  occurred  because  of  how  close  to  the  runway  they  live.  In  Bamyan,  public \nconsultations  revealed  that  plans  had  already  been  made  to  move  the  settlement  near  the \nrunway  and  compensation  negotiations  had  been  completed,  but  because  of  a  lack  of  funds, \nthe  local  administration  was  delaying  the  payment  of  compensation.  Under  this  Project, \nhouseholds holding titles that lose residential structures will be relocated only after the payment \nof full compensation for their structures and land according to the Land Acquisition Act and prior \nto the award of civil works contracts. \n \nD. \n \nThe survey revealed that 23% of households have an income of less than AF2,000 per \n8. \nmonth, while 40% have an income of AF2,000 to AF3,000 per month and 25% have more than \nAF3,000 per month. Because of the lack of employment opportunities during the war years and \ndrought in the last couple of years, poverty levels have risen rapidly. The poverty line the United \nNations  has  adopted  for  Afghanistan  is  $1  per  person  per  day.  About  23%  of  the  families \ncontacted  during  the  social  survey  fall  below  this  minimum  subsistence  level.  Those  families \nwith an income between AF2,000 and AF3,000 per month can also be considered as falling into \n\nIncome Level and Occupational Profile of Affected Persons  \n\n  \n\n\f Appendix 11    49 \n\n  \n\n \n\nthis category as they do not have continuous employment for the whole year. Thus more than \n60% of the affected families fall below the poverty line.  \n \n9. \nIn terms of the occupational profile of those affected, 3% of affected persons worked as \nagricultural laborers and 26% were nonagricultural laborers, while the remainder were involved \nin  businesses  or  worked  for  private  companies  or  the  government.  Among  women,  the  most \ncommon occupation was working as servants, although the proportion working was extremely \nlow.  The  women  in  the  affected  families  generally  do  not  work  outside  the  home.  The  group \ndiscussion in Bamyan revealed that the women wanted the airport to be better than it is today. \nThey  believe  that  if  the  airport  is  improved,  it  will  bring  in  more  flights,  which  would  enhance \nbusiness  in  the  region,  giving  their  families  better  employment  opportunities,  and  therefore \nincreased incomes.  \n \nE. \n \nThose  affected  by  the  Project  have  indicated  that  they  would  like  to  self-relocate  and \n10. \nonly requested that they be given appropriate compensation or assistance so that they can buy \nland  of  equivalent  value  or  build  an  equivalent  type  of  house  wherever  they  relocate.  The \nsquatter  farmers  in  Faizabad  have  asked  for  advance  notice  or  appropriate  compensation  for \nany  loss  of  crops.  Those  affected  have  noted  that  they  would  be  happy  if  employment \nopportunities  could  be  provided  during  project  development  and  in  future  activities  at  the \nairports.  The  process  of  self-relocation  and  payment  of  compensation  to  households  losing \nresidential  structures  will  be  carefully  monitored  by  MCAT  with  the  assistance  of  the \nnongovernment organization (NGO) implementing the resettlement plan. \n \n\nRelocation Options \n\nF. \n\nPolicy Framework and Entitlement Matrix \n\n \n11. \nThe  policy  framework  is  based  on  the  laws  and  practices  of  the  Government  of \nAfghanistan  and  ADB\u2019s  requirements.  The  resettlement  entitlement  matrix  (Table  A11.2) \nrecognizes different types of losses associated with dislocation and resettlement, namely, loss \nof residential structures, religious structures, trees, crops, community structures, and agriculture \nland.  The  land  acquisition  will  be  carried  out  based  on  Afghanistan\u2019s  Land  Acquisition  Law. \nFollowing current practice, the compensation will be provided at rates set by the Government. If \nland and property are acquired, the owner gets compensation to cover the value of the land; the \nvalue of residential houses and buildings; and the value of trees, orchards, and other assets on \nthe land. The act also states that a person who loses a residential land plot will receive a new \nplot of land of the same value. If people wish, they can get a residence or house on government \nproperty  in  exchange  under  proper  procedures.  Under  the  Land  Acquisition  Act,  the \nGovernment  or  local  municipality  will  set  up  a  committee  that  will  be  responsible  for  the  land \nacquisition. The committee will consist of the landlord or the person who uses the land or his or \nher representative, the local MCAT representative, a representative of the municipality, the local \nrepresentative of the Ministry of Finance, and the local representative of the Ministry of Justice. \nAt the central level, MCAT will monitor the land acquisition through the Project Implementation \nUnit (PIU).  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n \n \n \n\nTable A11.2: Resettlement Entitlement Matrix \n \n\nType of Loss \n\nApplication \n\nEntitlement \n\nLoss of residential \nstructure by \nowners  \n\nLoss of residential \nstructure by \nencroachers  \n\nStructure within 90 \nmeters of a \nrunway strip and \nwithin the project \narea  \n\nStructure within 90 \nmeters of a \nrunway strip and \nwithin the project \narea \n\nLoss of \ntrees/crops \n\nStanding \ntrees/crops within \nthe 90 meters \nwidth \n\n Loss of \nresidential land by \nstructure owners \n\nDisplacement of \nreligious or \ncommunity \nstructure \n\nStructure/plot \nowners  \nwithin 90 meters \nof a  \nrunway strip  \nReligious or \ncommunity \nstructures within \n90 meters of a \nrunway strip, if  \nremoved for \nProject interest  \n \n\nDefinition of \nAffected Persons \nOwner(s) of \nstructures identified \nby the socio-\neconomic survey \n\nOwners extending  \nproperty or using \npublic land as \nidentified by joint \nverification during \ndetailed design and \nimplementation \n\nOwners of trees, \nperennials and \nsquatter farmers \n(not losing \nstructures) \n\nOwner(s) of  \nstructures identified \nby  \nthe socio-economic \nsurvey \nReligious head, \nreligious \ncommittee, or \ncommunity \nrepresentative as \nidentified  \nduring the  \nSocio-economic \nSurvey  \n\nLoss of access to \nagriculture land \n\nAgriculture, \nhorticulture, etc., \nwithin 90 meters \nof a runway strip \n\nAgriculture \nDepartment,  \nprivate developers, \nothers \n\n(cid:131)  Replacement value of structure \n\nat market price  \n\n(cid:131)  AF2,000 as shifting allowance \n\nor provide transportation for \nshifting to the new self-\nrelocation site/structure \n(cid:131)  Salvage materials free of cost \n(cid:131)  Replacement value of structure \non Government land at market \nprice \n\n(cid:131)  AF2,000 as shifting allowance \n\nor provide transportation for \nshifting to the new self-\nrelocation site/structure \n(cid:131)  Salvage materials free of cost \n(cid:131)  Advance notice to harvest \n\ncrops. \n\n(cid:131)  In case of standing crops and \n\ntrees, compensation at the rate \nestimated by the Agriculture \nDepartment \n\n(cid:131)  Salvage materials free of cost \n(cid:131)  Replacement value of plot/land \n\narea at market price \n\n(cid:131)  Fees and charges for \n\nregistration or transfer of \nownership  \n\n(cid:131)  Replacement value of structure \n\nat market price  \n(cid:131)  AF2,000 as a shifting \n\nallowance for relocation of  the \nstructure \n\n(cid:131)  Plot as decided by the religious \n\nbody, the local religious head, \nor the religious committee \n(cid:131)  Dismantling and reconstruction \n\ncash assistance as per \nassessed value by the \ncommittee for assessing the \nstructure. \n\n(cid:131)  Government land to be \ntransferred between \ndepartments, private \ndevelopers to be provided with \nappropriate compensation for \nthe standing crops, allocate \nsimilar Government land for \ndevelopment to private \ndevelopers \n\nExpected \nResults  \nReconstruction \nof structure at a \nnew site \n\nCompensation \nfor lost \nstructure  \n\nCompensation \nfor trees, \nperennials and \nstanding crops \n\nPurchase of \nland for \nconstruction of \na new structure \n\nRestoration of \nreligious or \ncommunity \nstructure  \n\nRestoration of \nland for \nreplantation by \nthe \nGovernment \nand private \ndevelopers  \n\nSpecial \nassistance to \nvulnerable groups \n\nHouseholds within \n90 meters of a \nrunway strip \n\nAffected persons \nliving below the \npoverty line \n\n(cid:131)  Lump sum assistance of \nAF2,000 for 1 month \n(cid:131)  Employment in construction \n\nIncome \nrestoration \nassistance \n\nactivities \n\n12. \nAffected persons will receive the replacement value of their property and other physical \nassets, based on the assessment of the legally constituted committee for land acquisition and \nthe valuation of the structures and the land to be acquired. The affected persons will be allowed \nto  salvage  whatever  material  they  find  useful  for  rebuilding  from  their  structures  after  their \nstructures have been demolished. In the case of agricultural land, those affected will be given \nenough time to move plants and harvest standing crops or be compensated for the crops based \n\n \n\n  \n\n\f Appendix 11   \n\n \n\n51 \n\n  \n\n \n \n\n \nG. \n\non  their  market  value.  The  affected  households  will  self-relocate  with  rehabilitation  assistance  as \nper the resettlement matrix. They will be given cash allowances for relocating to the new place of \nresidence, including transportation costs. Those people who are unable to show title to the land or \nto the structure they are using shall be legally considered as the occupiers of the land or structure \nand considered for compensation and assistance under the Project.  \n\nConsultation Meetings and Stakeholder Participation \n\nProject  development  and  activities  were  discussed  with \n\n \n13. \nlocal  communities  during \nconsultation  meetings  at  the  sample  project  sites. The discussions were held with all the primary \nstakeholders  (those  directly  affected  by  the  Project),  with  secondary  stakeholders  (local \nadministrations,  etc.),  and  with  various  other  international  and  local  agencies  involved  in \nrehabilitation and reconstruction in Afghanistan. The directly affected populations were consulted to \ngain an understanding of their concerns in relation to the Project and to  gather suggestions on the \ntypes  of  mitigation  measures  that  should  be  considered  to  address  the  envisaged  impacts.  The \nconsultations and discussions with  those affected will be continued throughout the implementation \nof the Project. During implementation, MCAT will be assisted in conducting the consultations by the \nNGO that will be contracted for  resettlement plan implementation. The short resettlement plan will \nbe  translated  into  local  language  (Dari)  and  disclosed  to  affected  persons  and  will  be  made \navailable  in  local  MCAT  offices,  ADB\u2019s Resident Mission in Afghanistan,  and  on  ADB\u2019s  web  site. \nThe NGO will keep  those affected informed about the Project\u2019s impacts  and the compensation and \nassistance proposed for them and  will help them deal with  any  grievances. The  affected  persons \nwill  participate  in  all  the  decisions  and  in the  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan.  Affected \npersons will also be involved in the  grievance redress committees set up to review and resolve any \ndisputes  about  compensation  and  other  resettlement  benefits.  Finally,  continuous  on-site \nconsultation  will take place  during  the  implementation  stage  to  ensure  that  the  affected  persons \nreceive their proper entitlements.  \n \nH. \n \n14.  MCAT, through its PIU, will be responsible for  implementing the resettlement plan. The PIU \nwill  be  headed  by  a  project  director  and  will appoint  an NGO  to implement the  resettlement  plan \nand  carry  out  the  relocation  and  rehabilitation  based  on  the  choices  of  those  affected. The  PIU\u2019s \nsocial  development  officer  will  monitor  the  implementation  of the  resettlement  plan.  The  social \ndevelopment officer will have at least a master\u2019s degree in a social science, preferably sociology or \neconomics. The officer should have at least 1 or 2 years of experience in working on infrastructure \ndevelopment  projects  involving  resettlement  and  rehabilitation.  If  the  PIU  is  unable  to  locate \nsomeone  with  these  qualifications,  it  should  identify  an  ideal candidate  from  within  MCAT  and \nprovide appropriate training to handle the social issues during the resettlement plan implementation \nand post implementation periods. The appointed NGO will generally have staff located at the airport \nsites for carrying out the implementation of the RP.  \n \nPIU officials and NGO staff will undergo a week of training on ADB\u2019s policy on resettlement, \n15. \nresettlement management, and implementation. The PIU will have to constitute a grievance redress \ncommittee following loan negotiations that will comprise (i) a representative of the affected persons, \n(ii) a representative of the  local  administration (the chief administrator from the  governor\u2019s  office), \n(iii) a representative from the municipality, and (iv) a representative from the local legal department. \nAny grievances will be brought before a committee and a decision  has to be taken within 7 to 10 \n\nImplementation Responsibilities and Cost Estimates \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n \n \n \n\nworking days. If any committee members are absent during the decisionmaking  process, they will \nnominate an appropriate person to take their place.  \n \nThe  estimated  cost  of  relocation  and  resettlement  is  AF7,853,023  or  $0.17  million.  The \n16. \ncompensation  and  assistance  have  been  calculated  based  on  information  gathered  during  the \nsocial surveys and from local administration officials and the project affected  community. The unit \nvalues  have  been  drawn  from  consultations  carried  out  with  various  stakeholders.  The  PIU  will \nensure  that  resettlement  budgets  are  delivered  on  time  to  the  implementing  NGO  for  timely \nimplementation  of  the  resettlement  plan.  Individual  entitlements  on  a  household  basis  will  be \nprocessed  by  the  NGO  based  on  confirmed  Socio-economic  Survey (SES)  data.  Each  entitled \nperson  will  receive  an  identity  card.  The  implementation  of  this  short  resettlement  plan  will  be \ncompleted  in  12  months  from  households  receiving  notice  that  they  must  relocate,  and  all \nhouseholds will receive the compensation and assistance due to them 3 months prior to relocation.  \n \nI. \n \n17.  MCAT will supervise and monitor  implementation of the short  resettlement plan through the \nPIU  social  development  officer.  The  social  development  officer  will  report  to  ADB  on  a  quarterly \nbasis  during  the  resettlement  plan  implementation  period.  The  monitoring  report  will  deal  with  all \naspects of  the  relocation,  resettlement,  and  rehabilitation  of  households. The  NGO implementing \nthe resettlement plan will conduct field-level monitoring, assess progress in the field on a monthly \nbasis, and prepare a monthly report for the social development officer. A complete status report on \nresettlement plan implementation will be prepared by the  social development officer and submitted \nto  ADB  at  the  end  of  the  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan.  The  report  will  reflect  on  the \nresettlement experience and on lessons learned for improved management of resettlement in future \nprojects.  \n\nMonitoring Arrangeme nts \n\n \n \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                       Appendix 12         53 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY (SPRSS) FORM \n\n  \n A.

In addition to a lack of maintenance, the deterioration was further accelerated by the heavy \ndamage  inflicted  by  the  prolonged  civil  strife  and  military  operations.  Afghanistan  relies  significantly  on  the  civil  aviation \nsector for keeping most of its remote communities within reach of much needed humanitarian aid and basic public services. \nRehabilitation and strengthening of the civil aviation sector is crucial in extending the reach of the Government in Kabul to \nfacilitate  stabilization  and  integration  of  the  country.  Rehabilitation  of  the  civil  aviation  infrastructure  is  a  prerequisite  for \nprivate  sector  service  providers  to  provide  efficient  and  affordable  means  of  transport  to  most  of  the  population  living  in \nremote, rural provinces. Rehabilitation of the airports will also contribute to employment creation, income generation at the \nhousehold  level,  improvements  in  safety,  improvements  in  the  spread  of  medical  facilities,  interethnic  reconciliation,  and \npolitical  unification  of  the  country.  To  the  extent  possible,  the  Project  will  use  labor-intensive  construction  methods  to \nprovide  much  needed  employment  and  income  generation  opportunities.  It  will  contribute  to  social  stability  and  poverty \nreduction  by  engaging  internally  displaced  by  the  war  and  civil  unrest.  Thus  this  investment  will  significantly  improve  the \nsocioeconomic situation, and help mitigate the pervasive poverty. \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\n                                                                                                      Poverty Intervention \n\nB. \nPhase I of the project will cover seven regional airports in the provinces of Badakhshan, Bagdis, Bamyan, Farah, Faryab, \nGhor, and Nimroz with a total population of about 3,201,000. Of the seven airports, Maimana is the major economic center \nand  has  the  largest  population,  while  Qalai-Naw  has  the  lowest.  Nationally,  approximately  53%  of  the  population  is \nclassified as poor and living on less than $1 per day or approximately 2,100 kilocalories per day. In the project provinces, \nthe  average  daily  income  is  less  than  $1,  no  more  than  $0.74  per  person  per  day,  compared  with  the  national  average \nincome  of  an  unskilled  laborer  of  $1.7  to  $3.2  per  day.  The  prolonged  war,  further  exasperated  by  drought,  has  severely \naffected people\u2019s livelihoods. The decline in farm productivity and the loss of seasonal opportunities for agricultural labor is \none of the main determinants of poverty, because unskilled labor is often piecemeal over time or seasonal as opposed to a \nregular income source over the year. The social assessment in the project area also revealed that 50% to 60% of residents \nlived below the poverty line and had an average income of AF2,000 to AF3,000  per month. Thus poverty levels are high in \nthe project provinces.  \n \nDemographic health indicators of poverty reveal that Afghanistan ranks fourth highest in the mortality rate for children under \n5  at  257  deaths  per  1,000  and  has  a  high  infant  mortality  rate  of  165  per  1,000.1  In the  phase  1  provinces,  the  maternal \nmortality rate is an extremely high 820 per 100,000 live births, and average life expectancy is just 44 years, compared to 60 \nto  75  years  in  neighboring  countries.  Access  to  reproductive  health  services  for  mothers  is  extremely  limited.  More  than \n70%  of  deliveries  are  at  home.  Basic  health  center  facilities  are  generally  more  concentrated  in  Badakhshan  than  in  the \nother provinces. The facilities within the basic health centers are extremely poor because of the prolonged disturbances and \nthe  out-migration  of  medical  personnel.  In  addition,  nearly  99%  of  the  households  in  the  project  provinces  lack  sanitary \nfacilities,  most  resort  to  unsafe  sources  of  water,  and  adult  literacy  ranges  from  15%  among  the  male  population  to  less \nthan 7% among the female population. \n \nThe project would have both direct and indirect poverty reduction impacts. The direct poverty impact would be on income \ngeneration and the demand for unskilled labor. The direct benefit to poor households will be employment in construction of \nairstrip perimeter fences, terminal buildings, and other passenger facilities in terms of net income earned during the period \nof the project. Expectations are that this additional income will be spent within families on education, nutrition, agricultural \nimplements,  seed,  and  fertilizer,  which  will  benefit  families  and  communities  through  surplus  crops  and  improve  their \nincome levels. The Project will generate 380 person-months of employment opportunities for unskilled labor. Both poor and \nnon-poor households are likely to benefit directly in the medium and long term, as additional jobs will be created in airport \nadministration  and  management  and  in  the  tourist  industry.  Employment  opportunities  will  also  be  created  in  fire  fighting \nservices,  catering,  private  airline  services,  and  car  hire  services  for  business  travelers  and  tourists  and  within  small  and \nlarge contractor firms that will be responsible for the operations and maintenance of the airports in the future. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. 2004.

Remote  areas  that  are  not  well  connected  by  land  transport  would  be  linked  and  receive  fast,  comfortable,  and \nconvenient  connections  between  the  capital,  Kabul,  and  other  centers  of  commerce,  administration,  and  tourism.  The \nProject  will  also  facilitate  access  to  regional  and  international  markets  for  agricultural,  livestock,  and  other  products; \nfacilitate regional trade; and stimulate the growth of local trade and enterprises, thereby generating additional employment \nopportunities. Air cargo will enable the delivery of urgent supplies and the export of high\u2013value, low-volume manufactured \nor perishable products to both national and international markets. The construction of controlled airstrips will reduce aircraft \noperating  costs  and  pass  significant  benefits  on  to  airline  operators  in  terms  of  flexibility  in  the  types  of  aircraft  operated, \nhigher payloads, and improved safety. The Project will also attract investment from private airlines and bring new business \nand employment opportunities to the areas, especially opportunities related to tourism.  \n \nIn addition, the rehabilitation of regional airports will result in improved service frequency and reliability, leading to greater \nuse  of  domestic  airline  services,  and  passengers  will  save  time  in  transit  leading  to  savings  in  travel  time.  Local \ncommunities served by regional or private airline operators would receive tourism benefits (hotel occupancy, car hire, local \ncraft  industries,  tour  guides,  etc.);  improved  connections  to  markets  (where  they  can  obtain  higher  prices  for  outputs  and \npay  less  for  inputs);  and  improved  connections  to  social  services  (medical,  educational,  and  administrative)  and  remote \nregions (improvements in productive capability and increased self-reliance). \n \n \nC.     Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nDuring the course of social analysis, consultations with various project stakeholders, including those potentially affected by \nthe Project, were organized to ascertain their acceptance of the rehabilitation of the airports and their opinions and views \nabout the Project. In addition to public meetings, focus group discussions were organized with people living in the vicinity of \nthe  airport  and  along  the  runway  strips,  including  with  women\u2019s  groups,  to  comprehend  the  various  social  issues,  both \npositive and adverse. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n\n   Yes               \n\n  Yes \n\n   No \n\n \nD.

They  lack  decisionmaking  authority  in  major  household \nand  other  economic  activities.  The  proposed  airport  rehabilitation  will  benefit  both  men  and  women.  While  women  in  the \nproject  area  will  not  benefit  from  employment  in  construction  activities,  they  can  avail  themselves  of  direct  employment \nopportunities at the airports during the operational stage of the Project. \n\n   No \n \n\n \n\n \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n  No \n\nE. \n\nSocial Safeguards and Other Social Risks \n\n \n\nItem \nResettlement \n\n \nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone \n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Not significant \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n \n\n \nPlan Required \n Full \n\nThe project development is being carried out for 90 \nmeters graded runway strips construction of which will be \nmostly within the existing rights of way (ROW).

An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  study  was  undertaken  during  June\u2013\nAugust  2004.  This  summary  IEE  is  based  on  the  IEE  report  for  the  Project  prepared  by  the \ninternational  technical  assistance  consultants  (SMEC  International  Pty.  Ltd.,  Australia),  which \nwere retained by ADB to assist the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism (MCAT) as part of the \nproject preparatory technical assistance funded by ADB. \n \nB.  \n \n2. \nThe  project  area  is  located  in  seven  different  provinces  spread  across  seven  of \nAfghanistan\u2019s  eight  regions,  including  (i)  northeast,  (ii)  north,  (iii)  west;    (iv)  central,    (v)  east \ncentral,  (vi) southwest, and (vii) south.1   \n \n3. \nThe  Project  involves  rehabilitating  seven  airports  across  Afghanistan  at  Bamyan, \nChaghcharan,  Faizabad,  Farah,  Maimana,  Qalai-Naw,  and  Zaranj.  The  Project  will  be \nimplemented  over  a  period  of  2.5  years  commencing  in  April  2005.  The  project  activities  will \ninvolve  (i)  reconstructing  the  runways  (about  2,000  meters  x  30  meters)  with  an  asphalted \nconcrete wearing course; (ii) constructing new taxiways and aprons with an asphalted concrete \nwearing  course;  (iii)  widening  runway  strips  to  90  meters  graded  width,  including  drainage  as \nrequired;  (iv)  constructing,  rehabilitating,  or  renovating  existing  passenger  terminals  and \nproviding water supply and sanitation facilities; (v) providing new powerhouses and generators; \n(vi) providing apron security fences and gates; (vii) providing two wind indicators; (viii)  providing \nairport  maintenance  buildings  and  equipment;  (ix)  constructing  boundary  fences;  (x)  providing \nnew  fire  stations  and  equipment  (category  4);  and  (xi)  providing  two  fire  tenders  to  meet \ncategory 4 requirements.  \n \nC.  \n \n4.  \nThe general topography of most of the airports sites is rolling to hilly except in Maimana \nand Zaranj, where the terrain around the airports is almost flat.  The soil type in and around the \nairports is generally sandy loam to sandy silt. The general land use around the project airports \nconsists of agriculture and horticulture (Qalai-Naw); residential areas (Bamyan, Qalai-Naw, and \nZaranj); and military camps (Bamyan and Qalai-Naw). Limited encroachments are also apparent \nat least at one of the phase I airports (Faizabad). All but Farah and Zaranj airports are located \nfrom 50 to 500 meters of rivers. \n \n5.  \nconsidered good. The ambient noise levels are also reported to be within acceptable levels. \n \n\nAs there is no major source of air pollution, the ambient air quality at all these airports is \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n                                                 \n1  The  United  Nations  has  defined  eight  regions  for  its  assistance  planning:  (i)northeast\u2014Badakhshan,  Baghlan, \nKunduz,  Takhar;(ii)  north\u2014Balkh,  Jawzjan,  Samangan,  Saripul;(iii)  west\u2014Badghis,  Farah,  Faryab,  Herat;  (iv)east \n(v)  central\u2014Bamyan,  Ghor;  central\u2014Kabul,  Kapisa,  Logar,  Parwan,  Wardak;(vi)  east\u2014Kunar,  Laghman, \nNangarhar,  Nuristan;  (vii)  south\u2014Ghazni,  Khost,    Pakteka,  Paktya;(viii)  southwest\u2014Hilmand,  Kandahar,  Nimroz,  \nUruzgan, Zabul.   \n\n \n\n\f     \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n      Appendix 13         \n\n      57\n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nThere  is  no  environmentally  sensitive  area  (cultural  heritage  site,  protected  area, \n6.  \nprotected  wetland,  mangrove,  estuarine,  buffer  zone  of  a  protected  area,  or  a  biodiversity \nconservation area) near any of these airports. \n \nD.  \n \n7.  \nThe  location  of  the  Project  will  have  no  significant  environmental  impact,  because  the \nProject  will  be  executed  only  on  existing  and  already  operational  airports,  none  of  which  are \nlocated in an environmentally sensitive area. The project design will have no significant negative \nimpacts as long as the Project adheres to good construction practices and fully implements the \nmitigation  measures  and  environmental  management  plan.  However,  the  Project  will  involve \nclearing about 750 Afghan pistachio, walnut, almond, and pine trees (mostly at Qalai-Naw) ) and \n7  hectares  of  horticulture  areas  growing  mainly  Afghan  pistachio,  walnut,  almond,  and  pine \ntrees; Iranian quince, sunflower, and cabbage; Brazilian cotton; and Australian corn species to \nobtain  the  designed  runway  strip  width  of  150  meters.  This  needs  to  be  compensated  for  by \nplanting and maintaining two sapling for each tree cleared for a reasonable period at designated \nlocations. \n \n8. \nMinor  and  short-term  environmental  impacts  are  anticipated  during  the  construction \nstage.  The  short-term  and  manageable  potential  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the \nconstruction stage will include (i) increased air pollution due to dust and other volatile chemical \nsubstances  resulting  from  the  operations  of  asphalt  plants,  (ii)  disturbances  from  noise  and \nvibration, (iii) impacts related to the location and operation of construction camps and borrowed  \nand  quarry  areas,  (iv)  soil  erosion  and  downstream  sedimentation  caused  by  earthworks,  and \n(v) social conflicts between local laborers and those from outside the area. Mitigation measures \nto minimize these impacts will need to be adopted, including (i) maintaining optimum moisture \ncontent  during  the  handling  of  soil,  spraying  water  to  minimize  dust  as  necessary,  and \nmaintaining a safe distance between asphalt plants and residential areas; (ii) strictly controlling \nconstruction  work  that  creates  noise  and  vibration  by  prohibiting  night-time  work  in  residential \nareas; (iii) ensuring environmentally sound management of construction camps, vehicle yards, \nand borrowed and quarry areas; (iv) providing temporary sedimentation traps at the outfalls of \ndrainage  channels  and  ditches  if  erosion  is  likely;  and  (v)  establishing  a  mechanism  in  the \ncontract conditions to maximize the employment of local labor. All these impacts are temporary \nand manageable. Nonetheless, all the mitigation measures and requirements will be included in \nthe  bidding  and  contract  documents  for  the  contractors  and  will  be  closely  monitored  by  the \nproject  manager.2  The  limited  amount  of  earthwork,  ground  preparation,  asphalt  work,  runway \nconstruction,  building,  rehabilitation,  etc.,  are  not  expected  to  adversely  affect  the  local \nenvironment.  The  Project\u2019s  estimated  daily  water  requirement  of  about  25  Kilo  liter  would  not \nsignificantly affect the supply of water to the residents of project towns.  \n \nThere will hardly be any fire hazard, because no combustible materials will be used and \n9. \nno fires will be ignited. Solid waste generated by some 50 workers at each site, as well as solid \nwaste  from  construction  activities,  will  be  disposed  of  daily  by  the  contractors  in  collaboration \nwith municipal staff. \n \n10. \nImproved runways will have a positive impact on local ambient air quality because of the \nreduction  in  dust  during  landings  and  takeoffs.  The  Project  will  also  enhance  aviation  safety, \nvisual  aesthetics,  and  economic  activities  in  the  region.  The  provision  of  water  supply  and \nsanitation facilities will improve overall environmental sanitation at the airports. \n\n                                                 \n2 The IEE report will be provided to prospective contractors and will be attached to the contract document.  \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n58 \n\n \n \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n\nDuring  the  operation  of  terminal  buildings,  building  and  fire  codes  will  be  strictly \n\nThe potential adverse environmental impacts associated with the Project are mainly the \n11. \nrisk of accidents and the noise nuisance to local people during landing and take-off operations. \nThe  additional  aircraft  movements  will  slightly  increase  the  present  ambient  noise  level; \nhowever, given the level and extent of flight services expected during the project design period \nof  10  years,  the  noise  impacts  are  expected  to  be  insignificant.  Moreover,  flights  are  normally \nscheduled during the daytime to minimize noise disruption to settlements. The diesel-operated \ngenerator  sets  could  also  contribute  to  the  ambient  noise  levels  should  noise  mufflers \nmalfunction.  All  the  generators  will  be  fitted  with  pollution  control  devices.  Thus  the  impacts \ncaused by the marginal and short duration increase in noise levels will not affect local residents \nsignificantly. \n \n12. \nThe estimated water requirement of 10 Kilo liter per day will be met from groundwater. \nThe limited quantity of water withdrawal is not expected to adversely affect the water needs of \nlocal  communities;  however,  the  wastewater  generated  might  contain  oil  wastes,  therefore  oil \ntraps will be installed in all drainage outlets.  \n \n13. \nenforced. Fire extinguishers will be provided at all the airports. \n \n14. \nNew  refueling  stations  at  Bamyan  and  Faizabad  will  be  constructed  and  operated  with \nstandard  operating  procedures  to  ensure  that  no  leakage  or  spillage  of  fuel  will  occur.  To \nprevent potential contamination, oil traps will be installed in the outlets of all drainage alongside \nrefueling sites. \n \nE.  \n \n15.  MCAT  will  be  the  overall  responsible  entity  for  ensuring  that  mitigation  measures  are \nimplemented.  The  Project  Implementation  Unit  (PIU),  especially  constituted  within  MCAT  to \nimplement  the  Project,  will  help  MCAT  supervise  and  monitor  the  implementation  of  the \nenvironmental monitoring plan. The implementation of mitigation measures during construction \nwill be the responsibility of the contractors. An environmental and social specialist will help the \nPIU  prepare  the  contract  documentation  so  that  the  bidding  documents,  bill  of  quantities,  and \nother  contractual  obligations  of  the  contractors  identify  their  environmental  management \nresponsibilities and stipulate penalties for noncompliance. In addition, the project manager will \nalso  be  required  to  assist  the  implementing  agency  in  monitoring  the  implementation  of  the \nenvironmental monitoring plan. \n \n16. \nThe supervision plan for the proposed Project will include provisions for participation by \nADB  environmental  staff  in  supervision  missions,  as  appropriate  and  subject  to  available \nfunding, \nthe  environmental  monitoring  plan.  The \nperformance  of  the  PIU  in  implementing  these  activities  will  be  a  standard  element  of \nsupervision mission reports, including those from the early implementation assessment and the \nImplementation  Completion  Mission.  Contractors  will  submit  monthly  and  quarterly \nenvironmental  monitoring  reports  to  the  project  manager,  who  in  turn  will  submit  consolidated \nquarterly reports to MCAT and ADB. The IEE includes a detailed environmental monitoring plan. \n \n17. \nThe  training  component  of  the  Project  will  include  an  environmental  training  and \ninstitutional  strengthening  plan  to  build  environmental  management  capacity  and  mainstream \nenvironmental considerations into all policy and operation functions of MCAT. \n \n\nto  review  progress \n\nimplementing \n\nin \n\n\f     \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n      Appendix 13         \n\n      59\n\ninternational  and \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure \n\nThe  total  estimated  cost  of  implementing  the  environmental  monitoring  plan  has  been \n18. \ncalculated as $0.28 million. The proposed monitoring plan includes monitoring the water quality \nof  drainage  from  project  areas  with  a  focus  on  BOD  (Biological  Oxygen  Demand)    COD \n(Chemical Oxygen Demand),  oil and grease, TSS (Total Suspended Solid) and air quality (SPM \n(Suspended  Particulate  Matter),  PAHs  (Polycyclic  Aromatic  Hydrocarbons),  NOx  (Nitrogen \nOxide),  SO2  (Sulphur  Dioxide)    prior  to  starting  the  work;  monitoring  the  implementation  of \nmitigation measures and water and air quality during the construction period and water and air \nquality;  and  continued  monitoring  of  air  and  water  quality  and  noise  levels  following  project \ncompletion.   \n \nF.  \n \nDuring  project  preparation,  five  levels  of  consultations  were  undertaken  using  a  public \n19. \ninformation consultation tool. The first level was in Kabul at the national capital level with various \nfunding  agencies,  research  agencies,  relevant \nlocal  nongovernment \norganizations,  and  relevant  ministries  and  Government  departments.  The  second  level  was  at \nthe  provincial  level  with  provincial  heads,  local  administrations,  municipalities,  agriculture \ndepartments,  legal  departments,  airport  authorities,  cadastral  departments,  and  relevant \ninternational  and  local  nongovernment  organizations.  The  third  level  was  with  community \nleaders  and  local  educated  people  primarily  to  solicit  information  about  natural  resources, \ncommunity  facilities,  and  likely  impacts  of  the  Project.  The  fourth  level  was  with  affected \ncommunities. The fifth level included consultation with people potentially affected by the Project, \nincluding  women  members  of  affected  families  on  an  individual  level.  Prior  to  these \nconsultations,  relevant  information,  such  as  a  description  of  the  Project  and  its  objectives  and \nan explanation of possible adverse effects of the proposed Project, were disseminated in a form \nand language meaningful to the groups consulted. \n \n20.  Major  perceived  benefits  as  identified  during  the  community  consultations  were  (i) \nreduced travel time; (ii) better access to public amenities; (iii) significant economic opportunities \nresulting from increased access to markets; (iv) benefits to local businesses from increased air \ntraffic; and (v) increased regional development in terms of industry, tourism, and development of \ncrafts  industries.  The  major  perceived  losses  include  (i)  loss  of  residential  and  agricultural \nproperties; (ii) safety risks posed by increased numbers of aircraft; (iv) children\u2019s loss of playing \nareas  following  the  fencing  of  airports;  and  (v)  increased  noise  pollution.  The  results  from  the \ncommunity consultation were taken into account during project planning and were incorporated \ninto the preparation of the resettlement plan as well as the preparation of mitigation measures.  \n \nG.  \n \n21. \nThe  initial  findings  of  the  IEE  study  show  that  the  negative  environmental  impacts \nassociated  with  the  rehabilitation  of  the  regional  airports  are  deemed  to  be  minor  and  the \nmitigation measures will be incorporated into the contract document for the contractors. All the \nproposed  mitigation  measures  for  all  project  components  are  manageable,  and  a  full \nenvironmental impact assessment to assess further impacts of the Project is not required. \n \nH.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                 \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  an  environmental  category  \u201cB\u201d  project,  as  it  is  unlikely  to \n22. \nhave  any  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts.

Implementation of the \nproposed  Project  will  provide  the  country  with  facilities  that  could  adequately  accommodate \nabout 10,000 passengers annually by the end of the first 10 years and is expected to increase \nthe tourism potential of the country. Direct employment opportunities that will be generated from \nthe proposed Project are estimated to be 1,000 people during construction and 50 people during \noperations.  In  addition,  several  indirect  benefits  will  accrue  to  users,  the  business  community, \nthe  poor,  aircraft  operators,  and  suppliers  of  various  goods  and  services.  The  Project  will \nespecially  benefit  women  through  the  provision  of  an  improved,  secure,  and  efficient  mode  of \ntransportation  in  comparison  with  road  transportation.  Nonetheless,  the  residents  of  nearby \nsettlements  will  be  subjected  to  both  temporary  and  permanent  marginal  increases  in  noise \nlevels, which in terms of level, time of occurrence, and distribution will not be significant. \n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 25 October 2004) \n  \n \n\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "afghani (AF) \nAF42.7 \n$0.023 \n", "Currency Unit  \n$1.00 \nAF1.00 \n \n \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAsian Development Fund \nAfghanistan Reconstruction and Development Services \neconomic internal rate of return \nfinancial internal rate of return \nInternational Civil Aviation Organization  \ninitial environmental examination \nMinistry of Finance \nMinistry of Civil Aviation and Tourism \nMinistry of Public Works \nnongovernment organization \nPartners in Aviation Communications and Technology   \nproject implementation unit \nPriority Reform and Restructuring  \nproject steering committee \nspecial drawing rights \ntransport sector review \ntechnical assistance \nUnited Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan  \nUnited Nations Humanitarian Air Services  \nUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes  \nUnited Nations Office of Project Services \nweighted average cost of capital \n", " \nNOTES \n", " \n", " \nADB \nADF \n \nARDS   \n \nEIRR \nFIRR \n \nICAO   \nIEE \n \n \nMOF \nMCAT   \nMOPW  \nNGO \n \nPacTec \nPIU \nPRR \nPSC \nSDR \nTSR \nTA \nUNAMA \nUNHAS \nUNODC \nUNOPS \nWACC  \n", " \n \n", " \n(i) \n", " \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 19 \nMarch.
