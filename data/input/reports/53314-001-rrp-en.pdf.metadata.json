The project \nwill support the diversification of the Kazakhstan economy by enhancing non-oil exports and will \nimprove the livelihoods of shopkeepers and support women\u2019s empowerment in both countries. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT    \n\n \nA. \n \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n1. \n\nProject Identification \n\n \n3. \nKazakhstan\u2019s middle-income country challenge. From 2010 to 2018, gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) grew at an average annual rate of 4.5%, reaching $9,331 in 2018; and the share \nof the population living below the national poverty line fell from 6.5% to 2.5%.1 However, the global \nfinancial  crisis  of  2007\u20132008  and  the  tenge  devaluations  of  2014\u20132015  considerably  reduced \neconomic  growth;  and  Kazakhstan  continues  to  need  to  diversify  its  economy  from  natural \nresources,  which  still  accounted  for  16%  of  gross  domestic  product  (footnote  1)  and  90%  of \nexports in 2017.2 To diversify and transcend its middle-income country challenges, productivity \nand  competitiveness  need  to  increase  in  the  non-oil  private  sector,  supported  by  appropriate \ninvestment, capacity building and innovation.3 \n \nKazakhstan\u2019s underdeveloped food and agriculture sector. Agriculture represents 4% \n4. \nof Kazakhstan\u2019s GDP (footnote 1) and 6% of exports (footnote 2). Local agricultural products are \ngenerally less competitive than imported products, due to lower productivity and quality. Further, \ncapacity  utilization  in  the  food  industry  remains  low  due  to  obsolescence  and  physical \ndeterioration of fixed assets. Food safety systems are underdeveloped, and agricultural exports \ncontinue to be plagued by a lack of logistics, imperfections in legislations and insufficient efforts \nfor brand promotion.4 \n \nThe Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s development priorities. The Kyrgyz Republic is a lower-middle \n5. \nincome country, with GDP per capita at the lower end of Central Asian countries ($1,281 in 2018). \nPoverty remains high at 26% in 2017, based on the national poverty line, and uneven across the \ncountry  (74%  of  the  poor  live  in  rural  areas).  The  Kyrgyz  Republic  critically  needs  to  create \nemployment and livelihoods opportunities in all productive sectors. As the country is a small and \nlandlocked economy, regional cooperation and integration is also a national imperative.5  \n \n6. \nRegional integration in Central Asia. As part of the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), \nall markets in the union, including Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic, come under common \n\n \n\n1  World Bank. World Development Indicators.

This  is  beneficial  to  food  and  beverage \nmanufacturers who can access a larger market and increase cross border exports, strengthening \nagricultural  value  chains.  The  EEU  also  provides  a  common  external  tariff  that  offers  some \nprotection  vis-\u00e0-vis  imports  from  third  countries,  with  tariffs  on  flavored  and  sweetened  drinks \n(8%), juice (10%), packaged tea (12%) and bottled water (15%). \n \n7. \nBorrower\u2019s  selection.  RGB  is  a  leading  food  and  beverage  group  in  Kazakhstan, \nproducing milk, tea, juice, water, and other packaged beverages. ADB had provided a loan to the \ngroup in 2013.6 Given ADB\u2019s long-term relationship with RGB, ADB was approached for financing \nanother round of expansion [Redacted]. ADB again assessed the financing needs of the company \nand  found  it  to  be  suitable  given  its  continued  solid  operational  and  financial  track  record. \n[Redacted] \n \n\n2. \n\nProject design \n\n \n8. \nThe  project  consists  of  (i)  the  expansion  and  strengthening  of  RGB\u2019s  distribution \ninfrastructure,  (ii)  the  expansion  and  upgrading  of  production  lines  for  beverages,  (ii)  working \ncapital for beverage production and distribution, and (iv) potential acquisitions that would further \nboost  RGB\u2019s  and  shopkeeper\u2019s  sales.  The  project  is  central  to  RGB\u2019s  strategy  of  improving \nproduction and distribution efficiency and maintaining and expanding direct access to customers \nin Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic. [Redacted] \n \n9. \nEnergy  efficiency  and  inclusive  distribution.  The  project  will  help  expand  and \nstrengthen  RGB\u2019s  distribution  infrastructure  across  Kazakhstan  and  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  The \nfunds will be invested in energy efficient coolers (which will reduce annual emission of CO2) that \nwill be deployed in small convenience stores, of which at least 50% owned by women. [Redacted] \nGiven  the  large  territory  of  Kazakhstan,  efficient  distribution  is  critical.  RGB  works  with  about \n44,000 small convenience stores, including more than half in rural areas. These stores are often \nowned and run by families that lack the financial resources to buy their own equipment. RGB will \nalso place coolers in the Kyrgyz Republic. This will reduce concentration risk for RGB and improve \nnon-farm livelihoods for small shopkeepers in the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \nResource efficient beverage production. The investment will include a new bottling line \n10. \nfor flavored water and other beverages and the upgrading of existing juice and water bottling lines, \nto  increase  production  efficiency,  notably  through  reduced  usage  of  both  energy  and  plastics, \nused  in  bottles  and  caps.  The  project  will  also  support  modernization  across  RGB\u2019s  existing \nproduction facilities, to improve cost and energy efficiency, as well as partly finance the company\u2019s \nincremental working capital requirements. \n \n11. \nCorporate governance technical assistance (TA). As a complement to the project, ADB \nwill  provide  TA  to  RGB  to  enhance  its  corporate  governance,  including  through  deeper \nengagement with stakeholders in the beverage value chain.7 The TA will help RGB strengthen \ncorporate policies. The TA will support an inclusive business approach for RGB\u2019s engagement \nwith shopkeepers, with the implementation of a monitoring mechanism to track the gender and \nincome of the shopkeepers and trainings for women shop owners on financial literacy and digital \ntechnology.  The  TA  will  help  RGB  engage  with  local  and  central  governments  to  improve  the \n\n \n\n6  ADB.  2013.

Finally, the TA will support RGB in conducting an \noutreach program to raise consumer awareness on the health impact of sweet beverages and \nalternatives.  The  TA  will  draw  on  international  expertise  in  corporate  governance,  circular \neconomy,  and  responsible  consumption,  which  is  not  readily  available  in  Kazakhstan  or  the \nKyrgyz Republic. \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrower \n\nRGB has its own extensive, nationwide sales and distribution platform.  \n\nRGB has two main production centers: Kostanay and Aksengir. A third, smaller production \n\n \nEstablished  in  1994,  RGB  is  a  leading  producer  of  milk,  tea,  juice,  water,  and  other \n12. \npackaged  beverages  in  Kazakhstan.  With  leading  brands  and  dominant  market  shares  in  key \nsegments,  a  modern  production  base  and  a  strong  management  team,  RGB  is  focused  on \nbecoming  the  largest  and  most  efficient  food  and  beverage  group  in  Central  Asia  by  2025. \n[redacted] \n \n13. \nfacility, Tealand, hosts the tea packaging activity, just outside of Almaty.  \n \n14. \n  \nRGB\u2019s founder and majority shareholder is a well-known businessman, Kairat Mazhibayev, who \nowns the business through a holding company: JSC RG Brands.  \n \n15. \nRGB  directly  employs  about  2,400  staff,  who  receive  benefits  in  compliance  with  local \nlabor law. In addition, about 3,000 households indirectly depend on RGB for their livelihood (e.g., \ndairy farmers, juice concentrate factory workers, fruit farmers and shopkeepers). \n \nIntegrity  due  diligence  was  conducted. 8 RGB\u2019s  founder,  shareholders,  managers  and \n16. \nsignificant contracting entities do not appear to constitute a significant or potentially significant \nintegrity  risk,  as  there  is  no  unresolved  or  substantiated  adverse  media  or  other  information \nrelated to them. Tax integrity due diligence was not required. \n \nB. \n \n17. \nImpacts. The project is aligned with the fifth target of sustainable development goal (SDG) \n5 (gender equality): \u201censure women\u2019s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for \nleadership at all levels of decision making in political, economic and public life\u201d. The project will \nalso contribute the second target of SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth): \u201cachieve higher \nlevels of economic productivity through diversification, technological upgrading and innovation, \nincluding through a focus on high-value added and labor-intensive sectors\u201d.9 \n \nOutcome.  The  project\u2019s  outcome  is  inclusive  production  and  distribution  of  quality \n18. \nbeverages  promoted.  At  least  7,000  additional  shopkeepers  will  benefit  from  cooler-generated \nsales in Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic. Further, RBG will create at least 138 jobs (including \n125 for women) in Kazakhstan.  \n \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n8  ADB. 2003.

The  project\u2019s  outputs  are:  (i)  Kazakhstan  gender  inclusive  investment  plan \n19. \ncompleted, and (ii) RGB as a more gender inclusive employer. RGB has committed to a gender \naction plan (para. 41). \n \nC. \n \n20. \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  project  is  aligned  with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, which calls for ADB: (i) \u201cto scale up its financing for agribusiness\u201d; (ii) to \n\u201cpromote  commercial  sustainability  through  high  standards  of  corporate  governance,  integrity, \ntransparency, and environmental and social safeguards\u201d, and (iii) to promote gender equality in \nat least 75% of the number of ADB\u2019s committed operations by 2030.10 The project is also aligned \nwith  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategies,  for  Kazakhstan  (2017\u20132021)  and  for  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic  (2018\u20132022). 11  The  country  strategy  for  Kazakhstan  identifies  strengthening  the \nfoundations for economic diversification through private sector development as a key operational \npriority.  The  strategy  also  emphasizes  the  role  that  ADB  can  play  to  contribute  to  inclusive \ndevelopment and reducing spatial and gender inequalities. The project is also aligned with the \ncountry strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic, which identifies the strengthening of agricultural value \nchains and promotion of regional integration and cooperation as key focus areas. \n \n21. \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent with Strategy 2030 Operational Plan for Priority 5 (Promoting Rural Development and \nFood Security, 2019\u20132024) as the plan emphasizes the importance of \u201clocal value addition for \nboth  domestic  and  export  markets\u201d  and  \u201copportunities  to  make  an  impact  in  the  fast-growing \nbranded food, modern retail, and e-commerce sectors\u201d. The project is also aligned with Strategy \n2030  Operational  Plan  for  Priority  7  of  Strategy  2030:  (Fostering  Regional  Cooperation  and \nIntegration), which makes the development of regional trade a strategic priority.12 The project is \nalso consistent with ADB\u2019s sovereign operations in Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic, notably \nthe  ongoing  TA  by  ADB\u2019s  Central  and  West  Asia  Department  to  support  the  development  of \nagricultural wholesale markets in Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic, within the Almaty-Bishkek \nEconomic Corridor framework.13 \n \nD. \n \n[Redacted] \n \nE. \n \n[Redacted] \n \nF. \n \n[Redacted] \n \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n10 ADB.  2018.
