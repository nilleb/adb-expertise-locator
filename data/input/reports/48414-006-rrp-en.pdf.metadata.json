The project road \nis part of the CAREC Corridor 2 and one of the key trade routes in the region. The project will \nhelp  the  Committee  for  Roads  under  the  Ministry  of  Transport,  to  ensure  effective  road \nmaintenance,  control  vehicle  overloading,  and  ensure  sound  traffic  management  through  the \ninstallation  of  intelligent  transport  system  (ITS)  and  weigh-in-motion  (WIM)  system  on  key \nsections  of  the  national  road  network.  The  project  will  scale  up  the  efforts  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  and  other  development  partners  in  developing  this  critical  CAREC \ncorridor and contribute to Uzbekistan\u2019s economic growth through improved transport connectivity. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale  \n\n \nA. \n \nImportance of regional connectivity to Uzbekistan. Surrounded by Afghanistan to the \n3. \nsouth, Kazakhstan to the north and northwest, the Kyrgyz Republic to the northeast, Turkmenistan \nto  the  southwest,  and  Tajikistan  to  the  southeast,  Uzbekistan  serves  three  of  six  CAREC \ncorridors. With 34 million people, Uzbekistan is the most populous country in Central Asia. As a \ndouble landlocked country, which requires crossing at least two countries to reach seaports, the \ngovernment has made regional connectivity a centerpiece of its transport policy. The government \naims to realize the great trade potential through developing the country into a regional transport \nand logistics hub between Europe, Central Asia, South Asia, and East Asia. \n \n4. \nRoad network as a bedrock of regional connectivity. Uzbekistan\u2019s road network, under \nthe purview of the Committee for Roads, covers 185,000 km, with a core network of 42,654 km\u2014\ninternational roads (3,979 km), national roads (14,069 km), and regional roads (24,606 km). While \nUzbekistan is comparable with other countries in Central Asia in terms of  the density of paved \nroads, the distribution of paved roads varies within the country.1 \n \n5. \nADB\u2019s  and  development  partners\u2019  support  to  regional  connectivity.  The  CAREC \nprogram provides Uzbekistan and its neighboring countries with a common platform to coordinate \ninvestments. ADB has invested in road and rail transport infrastructure in Uzbekistan, at a total \nvalue of $1.3 billion.2 The majority of this support has been provided through two multitranche \nfinancing facilities.3 \n\n6. \nModernization of CAREC Corridor 2 as a key priority. The east\u2013west trade corridor is \na key priority. A large part of these efforts focused on the strengthening of CAREC Corridor 2, \n\n \n\n1  Density  is  higher  in  the  eastern  regions  (4,000  km\u20136,000  km  per  10,000  square  kilometers  [km2]  in  Andijan, \nFerghana, Namangan, and Tashkent). To the south, density decreases to moderate values (1,000 km\u20133,000 km per \n10,000 km2) and is lowest in the western regions (less than 1,000 km per 10,000 km2 in Karakalpakstan and Navoi). \n\n2   Sector Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 4). \n3   ADB.  2010.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fwhich  connects  East  Asia  with  the  Caucasus,  Mediterranean,  and  southern  Europe,  covering \nAfghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, \nand the People\u2019s Republic of China. The project is a crucial part of these efforts and will improve \nthe  last  road  link  to  the  international  border  with  Kazakhstan,  and  thus  help  complete  the \nmodernization of CAREC Corridor 2. The project thereby supports the implementation of CAREC \n2030,  particularly  operational  clusters  2  (trade,  tourism,  and  economic  corridors)  and  3 \n(infrastructure and economic connectivity).4 The project promotes the CAREC Transport Strategy \n2030,  particularly  the  strategic  pillars  on  (i) cross-border  transport  and  logistics  facilitation,  by \nfacilitating the movement of cargo from Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States \n(CIS) countries; and (ii) road safety, by increasing the road safety management capacity of the \nCommittee for Roads and introducing a state-of-art ITS.5 The modernization of this key section of \nCAREC  Corridor  2 will  help  boost  Uzbekistan\u2019s  trade,  particularly  with the Russian  Federation \nand the People\u2019s Republic of China, Uzbekistan\u2019s two major trade partners. It will also enhance \nUzbekistan\u2019s role in transiting international goods and shipments by reducing transport costs and \ntime. In addition, it will facilitate economic corridor development among Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, \nand Tajikistan, as the improved road will boost industrial and tourism activities.6 \n \n7. \nKarakalpakstan, located at the northwestern end of Uzbekistan, is the country\u2019s largest \nregion,  occupying  about  35%  of total  land  area.  However,  its  population of  1.89 million  (2019) \naccounts for only 5.6% of the country\u2019s total. Karakalpakstan is one of the two poorest regions of \nUzbekistan, suffering high levels of poverty, unemployment, and poor health conditions. The size \nand strategic geographical location of Karakalpakstan make transport connectivity a paramount \npriority, not only for Uzbekistan but also for the subregion. Karakalpakstan has about 700 km of \ninternational  roads,  two  international  airports,  and  a  railway  network  that  connects  with \nTurkmenistan  and  Kazakhstan.  The  Kungrad  to  Daut-Ata  road  is  the  only  road  connecting \nUzbekistan in a northwestern direction to the countries of the CIS and Europe, which is vital to \nlink the region with the CIS, particularly the Russian Federation, as well as with Europe. \n \nNeed for institutional reforms to be accelerated. The government, supported by ADB \n8. \nand  other  development  partners,  has  carried  out  several  policy  and  institutional  reforms  since \n2003, including (i) creating the Ministry of Transport as the apex agency responsible for transport \nsector  planning,  policy  formulation,  regulation,  and  oversight;  (ii)  transforming  the  joint  stock \ncompany  Uzavtoyul  into  the  Committee  for  Roads;  (iii)  promoting  competitive  bidding;  (iv) \nengaging road design engineers through competitive selection; and (v) establishing a state-owned \nroad  equipment  company  to  lease  equipment  to  all  contractors.7  Uzbekistan  has  developed  a \nroad sector policy framework to improve governance and accountability, sustainability, transport \nlogistics, and private sector participation. In 2019, the government decided to start further reforms8 \nand unbundle the Committee for Roads, devolving its current functions (owner of road assets, \nroad  works  contractor,  and  road  operator)  to  different  agencies  to  improve  accountability  and \nefficiency.  Linked  to  such  reforms,  the  government  needs  to  diversify  investment  sources  for \nroads  to  different  independent  entities.  The  government  is  set  to  expand  the  country\u2019s  road \nnetwork to cater for growing traffic. Government funds and financing from development partners \nare  unlikely  to  match  future  financing  needs,  and  private  sector  involvement  in  road  financing \nneeds to be explored. The project is designed to address many of these key issues. In addition, \n\n \n\n4  ADB. 2017. CAREC 2030: Connecting the Region for Shared and Sustainable Development. Manila. \n5  ADB. 2020.

Efforts must be enhanced to improve safety. In terms of \n9. \nroad safety, conditions in Uzbekistan are poor, with an estimated 2,496 road fatalities per year, \ntranslating  into  about  1%  of  gross  domestic  product  lost  per  year.10  Poor  road  conditions  and \ntraffic rule violations, particularly of speed limits, are major causes. \n \n10. \nImportance  of  enhancing  climate  resilience  of  road  infrastructure.  Karakalpakstan \nhas a very arid climate, with average temperatures expected to increase by 2.4\u00baC by mid-century \nand nearly 5\u00baC by the end of the century. Roads will increasingly face risks from climate change, \naffecting their performance and life span. The design, maintenance, and planning of roads should \nadequately incorporate relevant risk management. \n \n11. \nNeed for modernization of design standards. The design and construction standards \ncurrently in use were developed in the 1980s and have been updated periodically, but without \nchanging their essential features. Some provisions for road geometric and pavement design are \nexcessive, resulting in unnecessarily high construction and maintenance costs. \n\n \n\nConsistency with national development objectives. Alongside the government\u2019s long-\n12. \nstanding  focus  on  regional  connectivity  (para.  3),  the  Development  Strategy  for  2017\u20132021 \npursues  five  priorities:  (i)  improvement  of  the  system  of  state  and  public  construction;  \n(ii) ensuring the rule of law and further reform of the judicial system; (iii) economic development \nand liberalization; (iv) development of the social sectors; and (v) security, inter-ethnic harmony \nand  religious  tolerance,  and  the  implementation  of  a  balanced,  mutually  beneficial,  and \nconstructive foreign policy.11 Transport is crucial to supporting priority areas (iii) and (iv). \n \nConsistency with ADB\u2019s strategy. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and \n13. \nsupports  five  operational  priorities:  (i)  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities \n(para. 36); (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality (para. 36);12 (iii) tackling climate change, \nbuilding  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental sustainability  (paras.  10 \nand 27); (iv) strengthening governance and institutional capacity (paras. 30\u201335); and (v) fostering \nregional cooperation and integration (paras. 3\u20136).13 The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership  strategy  for  Uzbekistan,  2019\u20132023,14  which  calls  for  investments  in  the  transport \nsector,  including  road  development,  and  promotes  regional  connectivity  along  major  CAREC \ncorridors. The project is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan.15 \n \n14. \nKey lessons learned. Lessons from previous and ongoing projects are that (i) a strong \nproject  management  unit  (PMU)  is  indispensable  for  successful  project  implementation  and \nshould be in place from the planning stage of the project, (ii) tender committee members need to \nhave a full understanding of ADB\u2019s procurement procedures, and (iii) the PMU and the Committee \nfor  Roads  should  streamline  approval  procedures  to  facilitate  procurement  and  contract \nmanagement. \n\n \n\n9   ADB. 2020.

The COVID-19 pandemic reinforces the \n15. \nneed  for  improving  the  connectivity  and  mobility  of  remote  and  isolated  areas  such  as \nKarakalpakstan.  With  improved  road  infrastructure,  the  accessibility  of  these  areas  can  be \nenhanced,  thus,  helping  the  government  to  implement  future  pandemic  mitigation  measures  if \nrequired. Road construction works under the project will start in early 2021 when the spread of \nCOVID-19 is expected to subside and be made manageable by the national COVID-19 response \nmeasures.  If  this  scenario  materializes,  the  project  will  be  implemented  within  the  planned \nimplementation period from 2021\u20132025. However, if COVID-19 is not contained by early 2021, \nthe Committee for Roads will enact measures for resources to be mobilized steadily, albeit at a \nreduced speed, and for construction works to continue without serious threat to peoples\u2019 health.16 \nIn the  medium  term,  the  project  will  play  an  essential  role,  helping  the  economy  bounce  back \nresiliently and regain its competitiveness in the project areas most affected by COVID-19. This \nroute is vital for international and domestic trade; and will help Uzbekistan achieve its ambitious \nplans to revitalize horticultural exports, revive the ravaged tourism industry and services, provide \nemployment, and regain momentum toward meeting its ambitious infrastructure plans. \n \nB. \n \n16. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: regional trade and economic connectivity \non the CAREC Corridor 2 is enhanced, particularly between Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.17 The \nproject will have the following outcome: regional trade and road transport connectivity in Western \nUzbekistan improved.18 The project will have the following three outputs. \n \n17. \nOutput  1:  Road from  Kungrad  to  Daut-Ata  reconstructed.  The  240 km  road  will  be \nreconstructed  to  a  two-lane,  cement  concrete  road.  The  road  design  incorporates  climate \nresiliency measures for the arid Karakalpakstan region. Access roads will be constructed to link \nvillages to the A380. Five rest stops with market stalls will be constructed, 50% of which will be \nallocated  for  women  entrepreneurs  with  separate  sanitary  facilities  for  women  and  men.  Two \nmultipurpose community complexes will be constructed in Jaslik and Karakalpakstan settlements \nto house facilities for livelihood training programs, and maternal and child health care services. \n \n18. \nOutput 2: Intelligent transport system installed. To improve road safety performance, \nan ITS will be installed on a 100 km pilot section of the Tashkent\u2013Namangan road (A373). This \nroad section has one of the heaviest traffic conditions in Uzbekistan. The ITS will monitor traffic \nand road conditions in real time and help to provide information and warnings on display boards \nand websites. Following the results of this pilot project, the government plans to implement such \nsystems in other parts of the road network. The introduction of an ITS will also help report critical \nincidents involving women, the elderly, children, and those with mobility impairments to relevant \ngovernment agencies for action. The Committee for Roads will submit yearly sex-disaggregated \nreports on road crashes by the type of road user and incident. \n \n19. \nOutput  3:  Weigh-in-motion  system  supplied  and  installed.  To  avoid  overloading  of \nvehicles  on  the  highway  network  and  to  prevent  accelerated  pavement  deterioration,  two  fully \n\n \n\n16 The Committee for Roads will develop and implement a risk mitigation plan to comply with the Ministry of Health and \nWorld Health Organization COVID-19 preparedness and response guidelines to prevent and monitor the spread of \nCOVID-19.  The  program  will comprise  health-related  measures to prevent  and  stem  the spread  of  COVID-19 by \nconstruction workers and improve the capacity of the project implementation team on site to protect construction \nworkers and people from the community from COVID-19. \n\n17 Government of Uzbekistan. 2019.

Before the implementation of the WIM stations, \nthe Committee for Roads will update axle load norms compatible with national legislation.20 The \nWIM stations will be constructed with the ITS systems to allow the collection of overloading data \nand  enforce  anti-overloading  regulations.  Based  on  the  outcome  of  the  pilot  project,  the \ngovernment  plans to  expand  the  implementation  of  an  axle load control program for  improved \nroad asset management throughout the road network in line with the strategy.21 \n  \nC. \n \n20. \nADB\u2019s involvement in this project provides tangible value. First, updated standards and \nspecifications will be used for civil works under the project (output 1), which have been developed \nand  improved  through  ADB  support.22  Second,  ADB  will  support  the  introduction  of  new \ntechnologies to support traffic management, axle load control, and road safety (outputs 2 and 3). \nThe installation of fully automated WIM systems will extend the life of paved roads, and ADB will \nhelp  improve  local  regulations  on  axle  load  control,  road  maintenance,  and  road  asset \nmanagement to international standards.23 Third, measures will be taken to protect biodiversity, \nand  introduce  climate  change  adaptation measures.24  These  measures  go  far  beyond  what  is \nrequired  under  national  legislation,  and were  developed  by world-leading experts  in their field. \nFourth,  the  project  will  introduce  gender-inclusive  measures  as  outlined  in  the  gender  action \nplan.25  These  will  enable women from the  communities to  develop skills  for  livelihood  activites \nand  access  maternal  and  child  health  services  through  a  telemedicine  facility.  Fifth,  ADB  will \nsupport capacity development of the Committee for Roads in several areas, including improving \nproject delivery, strengthening procurement, and introducing modern technologies. \n \nD. \n \n21. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $383.4  million  (Table  1),  including  taxes  and  duties, \nphysical  and  price  contingencies,  and  other  charges  during  implementation.  Detailed  cost \nestimates  by  expenditure  category  and  by  financier  are  included  in  the  project  administration \nmanual (PAM). 26 \n \nThe government has requested (i) a regular loan of $248.2 million and (ii) a concessional \n22. \nloan of $26.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The regular \nloan  will  have  a  24-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  4  years;  an  annual  interest  rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft loan and project agreements. Based on the straight-line method, the average maturity is \n14.25 years, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per year. The concessional loan \nwill have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an interest rate of 2.0% per year \nduring the grace period and thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n \n\n19 \u041c39 is an international corridor connecting Termez, Samarkand, Tashkent, Alma-ata, and Bishkek.

The road will remain a two-lane \nroad, with 3.75 meter lane widths, 0.75 meter paved and 3.00 meter unpaved shoulders. Concrete \nsurfacing to be applied to the project road has a long life of more than 30 years, as well as lower \nmaintenance requirements, and is more resilient to climate change. Road safety measures have \nbeen  introduced  into  the  detailed  design.  Climate  adaptation  measures  incorporated  into  the \nproject  include  temperature-resilient  cement  concrete  pavement,  larger  expansion  joints, \nincreased drainage capacity, and additional salt management measures. \n \nB. \n \nEconomic analysis was conducted based on ADB\u2019s guidelines.33 Direct benefits include \n28. \nvehicle operating cost savings, travel time savings, and reduced vehicle emissions. The use of \nconcrete pavement will improve the level of service and reduce routine and periodic maintenance \ncosts.  An  origin  and  destination  survey  confirmed  that  nearly  all  trips  on  the  project  road  are \ninternational, confirming its importance to CAREC Corridor 2. The economic internal rate of return \nfor the project is estimated at 11.0%, surpassing ADB\u2019s hurdle rate of 9.0% and indicating that \nthe project is viable. Traffic growth reflects forecasts of gross domestic product growth, revised \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\n \n33 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nSustainability \n\nby ADB in April 2020 to take into account the impacts of COVID-19. Under a sensitivity analysis, \nan increase in costs of 20% and a reduction in benefits of 20% reduces the economic internal \nrate of return to 8.4%. While this is slightly lower than the hurdle rate, it shows that the project is \ngenerally  viable  in  the  face  of  adverse  variations  in  key  assumptions.  34  Although  not  fully \nquantified, the project is expected to have positive cross-border spillover effects. It will increase \ntrade  flows  and  cross-border  movement  of  people  between  Uzbekistan,  on  the  one  hand,  and \nKazakhstan, the Russian Federation, and the South Caucasus and Eastern European countries, \non  the  other.  Improved  competitiveness  and  efficiency  will  materialize  in  other  sectors  of  the \neconomy through unobstructed access for business entities to regional and international markets. \n \nC. \n \nFinancial sustainability. Since the project is nonrevenue generating, financial analysis \n29. \nfocused  on  whether  the  project  outputs  will  be  sustained  financially.35  Projected  maintenance \nexpenditure, following the Committee for Roads budget for 2020, averages $7,650 per km.36 The \nestimated annual maintenance requirement for the project road is well within this allocation. The \nCommittee for Roads will establish two additional road maintenance units. The rest stops with \nmarket  stalls  and  multipurpose  community  complexes  are  social  infrastructure,  which  will  not \ntarget cost recovery or have a commercial component.  \n \nD. \n \n30. \nInstitutional capacity. The Committee for Roads will empower the PMU to make contract \nadministration decisions and/or establish a steering committee within the Committee for Roads to \nexpedite the  decision-making  process,  with  established  timelines  for  contract-related  decision-\nmaking. ADB will continue providing assistance, as needed, to the Committee for Roads and the \nproject PMU to ensure efficient project implementation and compliance with audit and financial \nmanagement requirements. \n \n31. \nLegal  capacity.  Recent  reforms  have  clarified  the  lines  of  command  for  project \nmanagement by defining the responsibilities of the Committee for Roads. In December 2018, the \ngovernment empowered the Committee for Roads to act as the executing agency for road projects \nsupported by all international financing institutions. The Committee for Roads has assumed this \nresponsibility from the Republican Road Fund for ongoing ADB-financed projects.  \n \n32. \nProcurement  capacity.  Overall,  the  capacity  of  the  Committee  for  Roads  and  the \nproposed PMU to conduct, control, and supervise procurement activities requires strengthening. \nMost public officials responsible for procurement do not have clearly defined terms of reference \nand usually have not received any formal procurement training. For previous projects, this has \nled  to  delayed  procurement  actions,  multiple  re-tendering,  and  litigations.  International \nconsultants mobilized under the project will support the PMU. ADB will continue to provide regular \nin-country  guidance  and  support  from  ADB.  The  Committee  for  Roads  will  establish  a  tender \ncommittee,  chaired  by  the  deputy  chair  of  the  Committee  for  Roads,  for  approval  of  all \nprocurement decisions.37 All contracts will be procured in accordance with the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers \n\n \n\n34 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 The analysis was conducted based on ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n36 This budget includes a wide range of roadworks, including routine, emergency, winter maintenance, and support for \n\n37 Other members will consist of representatives from the Ministry of Investments and Foreign Trade, the Ministry of \n\nthe financing of road maintenance units. \n\nFinance, and Uzbek Engineering. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n(2017, as amended from time to time). The procurement plan is guided by the following principles: \nfor civil works, the sectioning in 40 km lots was guided by the intent to attract participation from \nlocal contractors alongside international contractors, and divided so that each section is close to \na railway station, reducing logistics costs and reliance on road transport. As for the evaluation \ncriteria, considering the relatively low technology content, it was assessed that the best value for \nmoney would be achieved by using the one-stage, one-envelope system with open competitive \nbidding on the basis of the lowest evaluated substantially responsive bidder. \n \nFinancial  management  capacity.  The  Committee  for  Roads  and  the  proposed  PMU \n33. \nhave basic financial management capability to (i) record the required financial transactions, (ii) \nprovide regular and reliable financial statements, (iii) provide reliable monitoring reports, and (iv) \nsafeguard financial assets. The assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is moderate, \nmainly because the Committee for Roads still has no internal audit unit, despite its experience \n(and the PMU\u2019s experience) with ADB. Full-time ongoing accounting support and outsourcing of \nthe internal audit function will be carried out. Until such an arrangement is in place, a thorough \npre-audit  of  vouchers  may  be  done  by  a  trained  financial  expert  at  the  PMU  before  making \npayments.  The  Committee  for  Roads  will  recruit  an  external  audit  firm  to  carry  out  quarterly \ninternal audits. External audits of all existing projects and the proposed project will be conducted \nby external  auditors  acceptable to ADB,  and the  Committee for  Roads  will  ensure  compliance \nwith Audited Project Financial Statements submission deadlines. The Committee for Roads will \nprepare and submit to ADB detailed accounting and financial reporting manuals. \n \n34. \nSafeguards  capacity.  The  PMU  will  recruit  experienced  safeguards  specialists  by \nOctober 2020. The Committee for Roads will also hire experienced safeguards consultants with \nsufficient relevant experience, including an international and a national environmental consultant, \none with ecology background. \n \n35. \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  Committee  for  Roads.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nE. \n \n36.  Women in the project area travel to different destinations to carry out domestic and care-\ngiving  tasks  with  paid  employment,  income-earning  activities,  and  community  and  social \nobligations.  However,  their  mobility  is  hampered  by  poor  road  conditions  and  lack  of  reliable, \naffordable, and safe public transportation. The project will provide facilities and programs to help \nwomen build skills to start and/or improve their livelihoods and access to health services and other \nprograms. The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming and will build two multipurpose \ncommunity  complexes  with  facilities  for  livelihood  training.  The  nongovernment  organization \n(NGO) engaged in an ADB-supported TA will conduct the livelihood training.38 The community \ncomplexes will house telemedicine facilities to allow consultations by members of the community \nwith health professionals. This will be coordinated by local health care professionals in the local \ngovernment.39 It will also build five rest stops with market stalls for women and separate sanitary \nfacilities. The ITS component will monitor critical incidents, including those involving women, the \nelderly, children, and persons with disabilities; and will submit yearly reports on sex-disaggregated \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n \n\n38 Livelihood training courses will be conducted by the local NGO (Businesswomen Association) supported by ADB. 2019. \nDeepening  Civil  Society  Engagement  for  Development  Effectiveness  Subproject  3:  Deepening  Civil  Society \nEngagement in ADB Operations. Manila (TA 9769-REG). \n\n39 The  project  will  coordinate  with  the  local  government  for  the  provision  of  health  and  other  relevant  community \n\nprograms and services. \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\ndata  on  road  crashes  by  type  of  incident  and  road  user.  The  project  will  conduct  road  safety \nprograms;  awareness  raising  programs  on  sexually  transmitted  infections,  human  trafficking, \nsexual harassment, exploitation, and abuse in the context of travel and safety; and a mitigation \nplan to address risks and comply with core labor standards. \n \nF. \n \n37. \ncategories are as follows.40 \n \n38. \nEnvironment  (category  A).  An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  study  was \nprepared and disclosed on the ADB website on 13 April 2020. The project area is considered a \ncritical habitat with high biodiversity value, supporting 17 internationally and nationally recognized \nthreatened species, including the critically endangered sociable lapwing, saiga antelope, and the \nendangered  saker  falcon,  Egyptian  vulture,  and  steppe  eagle.  The  critical  habitat  assessment \nconducted as part of the EIA study concluded that the project area is a potential critical habitat for \nthe  saiga  antelope.  A  biodiversity  action  plan  prepared  as  part  of  the  EIA  study  will  be \nimplemented during various project phases to ensure that any adverse impacts on critical habitat \ncan  be  avoided  or  minimized.  The  contractor  will  prepare  and  implement  site-specific \nenvironmental  management  plans  (EMPs).  Other  potential  impacts  include  dust  or  vehicular \nemissions,  noise,  and  occupational  and  community  health  and  safety,  which  will  be  mitigated \nthrough the implementation of the EMP. Meaningful stakeholder consultations (including with local \nbiodiversity  experts  and  NGOs)  have  also  been  carried  out  as  part  of  the  EIA  study.
