The  project  will  be  implemented  in  five \nprovinces  and  one  municipality  in  the  upper  and  middle  reaches  of  the  Yangtze  River  Basin, \nnotably  the  provinces  of  Guizhou,  Hubei,  Hunan,  Sichuan,  and  Yunnan;  and  Chongqing \nMunicipality.1 The  proposed  project  will  promote  sustainable  and  modern  farming  systems  to \nenhance  productivity,  reduce  nonpoint  source  (NPS)  pollution  and  environmental  degradation, \nand strengthen institutional capacity for coordinated natural resources management. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  Yangtze  River  Economic  Belt  (YREB)  covers  nine  provinces  and  two  specially \nadministered cities within the Yangtze River Basin. It accounts for more than 40% of the entire \nPRC population, has 40% of the freshwater resources, serves as the drinking water resource for \n400 million people, provides 60% of total fisheries production, has 20% of the total wetland area, \nand already contributes about 45% of the PRC\u2019s economic output. Based on its demographic and \ngeographic assets, the PRC government has earmarked YREB as one of the three key growth \nengines  to  ensure  the  PRC\u2019s  future  economic  development. 2  However,  development  and \neconomic growth in the middle and upper reaches of the YREB are still undermined by (i) slow \ntransformation  into  green  development  and  economic  diversification;  (ii)  limited  integration  of \nwaterways,  ports,  and  intermodal  logistics;  (iii)  increasing  pollution  and  pressure  on  natural \nresources; and (iv) weak institutional coordination for strategic planning.3 \n\n3. \nTo  address  these  challenges,  the  Government  of  the  PRC  formulated  the  YREB \ndevelopment  plan  2016\u20132030,4 which  stipulated  the  prioritization  of  ecological  protection  and \npromotion  of  green  development  as  the  guiding  principle  for  the  YREB  development. 5 In  this \nconnection,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  government  have  agreed  to  adopt  a \nframework approach, providing about $2.0 billion of funding in the YREB  during 2018\u20132020 to \nstrategically program ADB\u2019s lending support for development initiatives in the YREB with priority \ngiven to the following four areas: (i) ecosystem restoration, environmental protection, and water \nresources management; (ii) green and inclusive industrial transformation; (iii) construction of an \nintegrated multimodal transport corridor; and (iv) institutional strengthening and policy reform. \n\n4. \nIn  the  middle  and  upper  reaches  of  the  YREB,  the  traditional  modes  of  economic \ndevelopment  strongly  rely  on  the  rural  economy  and  primary  sector.  However,  unsustainable \nproduction practices continue to cause environmental degradation and limit the opportunities for \nimproving rural livelihoods. This has severely impacted the water resources that the quality of the \n\n                                                \n1  Selection criteria included: low and medium agricultural productivity; high risk and occurrence of soil erosion; high \nlevels of agricultural nonpoint source pollution; lack of or outdated infrastructure; and the opportunity to implement \nintegrated watershed management in counties with poverty alleviation priority. The selection criteria and process are \nsummarized in Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n2  The other flagship projects are the Belt and Road Initiative and the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei Integration. \n3  ADB. 2016.

Beijing. \n5  Green development aims to (i) change the traditional development model to a sustainable development model; (ii) \n\naddress the challenges of rapid urbanization; and (iii) serve as a guide to socioeconomic development. \n\n \n\n\friver  water  suffers  from  increasing  NPS  pollution  because  of  excessive  levels  of  nitrogen, \nphosphorus,  and  pesticide  entering  water  bodies  through  agricultural  chemical  runoff. 6 \nAgricultural  intensification  has  degraded  the  land  resources,  driven  by  changes  to  land  use, \ndeforestation, diminished water availability and quality, soil erosion, and reduced soil quality from \noveruse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. The loss of agricultural productivity as a result of \nland  degradation  in  the  PRC  amounts  to  an  estimated  $37.09  billion  per  year. 7  Moreover, \nagriculture  is  highly  vulnerable  to  climate  change.  Coping  with  significant  variability  in  future \nclimatic impacts requires efficient water resource management, increased capacity of agricultural \nsupport institutions and stakeholders, improvement of the support services to farmers, and more \nresilient production and ecosystems. \n\n5. \nThe  provinces  of  Guizhou,  Hubei,  Hunan,  Sichuan,  and  Yunnan;  and  the  Chongqing \nMunicipality  support  large  rural  populations  and  have  an  agrarian  rural  economy.8 Agriculture, \nanimal husbandry, and fisheries are the main sources of livelihood for the 156.34 million people \nliving  in these  rural  areas,  but their  per  capita  disposable income  of  CNY8,090\u2013CNY12,725  is \nonly 31%\u201343% of that of their urban counterparts.9 While the terrains vary\u2014ranging from steep \nand  high  mountains  to  valley  bottoms  near  rivers\u2014they  can  all  be  characterized  by  outdated \nagricultural production systems and practices, with inefficient use of land and water resources, \nhigh  rate  of  land  conversions,  prevalent  soil  erosion,  excessive  fertilizer  and  pesticide  use, \noutdated  or \nimproper  waste \nmanagement and disposal practices, and lack of adequate extension services. The difficult terrain, \npoor land management practices, and limited opportunities to adopt modern and better practices \nhave caused widespread environmental degradation, which is further exacerbated by a changing \nclimate and extreme weather conditions, posing significant challenges for achieving sustainable \nagriculture and enhancing agricultural productivity and rural livelihoods. \n\nlivestock  production  with \n\ninfrastructure, \n\nintensive \n\nlacking \n\n6. \nModernizing  the  agriculture  sector  is  aligned  with  the  National  Agricultural  Sustainable \nDevelopment Plan, 2015\u20132030 and focuses on investments in (i) the protection of water and soil \nresources,  such  as  construction  of  high-standard  farmland,  protection  and  improvement  of \ncultivated farmland,  provision  of  efficient,  water-saving  irrigation,  and  monitoring of  agricultural \nresources;  (ii)  agricultural  and  rural  environmental  control,  specifically  waste  management, \nchemical  fertilizer  and  pesticide  control,  recycling  and  reuse  of  agricultural  film  and  pesticide \npackaging,  straw  utilization,  and  rural  environmental  integrated  management;  and  (iii) \nenvironmental rehabilitation.10  \n\n7. \nCurrently,  provincial  agencies  have  limited  opportunity  to  cooperate  on  agricultural \ndevelopment and natural resource management, and to coordinate rural economic development \nacross  the  YREB  because  of  (i)  fragmented  responsibilities  for  natural  resource  management \n                                                \n6  B.

For the country as a \nwhole, the rural population contributes 42.6% and the primary industry contributes 8.6% to the national GDP. \n\n9  The  provincial  per  capita  GDP  is  as  follows:  Guizhou  (CNY33,246),  Hunan  (CNY46,382),  Hubei  (CNY55,665), \nSichuan (CNY40,003), and Yunnan (CNY31,093). The per capita GDP of Chongqing Municipality is CNY58,502. The \nnational per capita GDP is CNY53,980. \n\n10 Released on 20 May 2015 by the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the Ministry of \nFinance,  the  Ministry  of  Land  and  Resources,  the  Ministry  of  Science  and  Technology,  the  Ministry  of  Water \nResources, the National Development and Reform Commission, and the State Forestry Administration.  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\facross the various agencies, (ii) competing priorities and policies within and across sectors, and \n(iii) limited options and mechanisms for upstream\u2013downstream coordination. A new approach is \nneeded  to  achieve  integrated  management  and  green  development  that  can  balance  natural \nresource management; improve agricultural productivity and thus food security; and increase the \nresilience  of  the  environment  and  people.  This  will  require  (i)  synergies  with  other  social, \neconomic, and environmental objectives; (ii) enhanced cooperation and coordination within and \nbetween  provinces  beyond  administrative  barriers;  (iii)  responsible  and  inclusive  governance; \n(iv) organized planning; and (v) stronger institutional capacity and cooperation. \n\n8. \nThe \u201cGreen Ecological Corridor\u201d is an integrated management approach that aims to unite \nmanagement and development priorities within the YREB. It aims to restore ecological health by \nmanaging the functional ecological zones, strengthening water source protection, applying soil \nand water conservation, and putting in place risk prevention and control measures.11 This requires \na combination of policy support, targeted research, financial incentives such as eco-compensation, \nand structural mechanisms to promote integrated and sustainable farming systems to protect and \nrehabilitate the ecological environment while promoting green economic development.12 Applied \nat the scale of the watershed, which serves as the natural environmental management unit, it can \nenable comprehensive and unified management of natural resources as well as cooperation to \nshare  experiences  and  lessons,  and  focus  on  green  growth  rather  than  the  traditional \ndevelopment model.  \n\nIn line with the State Council\u2019s guidelines to build an \u201cecological civilization\u201d,13 the National \n9. \nDevelopment  and  Reform  Commission  prepared  the  YREB  Development  Plan  2016\u20132030, \nemphasizing  green  development,  environmental  protection,  rehabilitation,  and  management  of \nwater resources (footnote 4). The plan specifically aims to (i) facilitate conservation and highly \nefficient  utilization  of  natural  resources;  (ii)  strengthen  management  efforts  to  improve \nenvironmental quality as the core purpose; and (iii) prioritize ecological protection and restoration, \nand the strengthening of water environmental management.14  \n\nStrategic fit. The project will protect the ecological environment, improve water security, \n10. \nincrease resilience to climate change, and improve the livelihoods of people. Thus, it is consistent \nwith  (i)  the  PRC\u2019s  Thirteenth  Five-Year  Plan,  2016\u20132020,  which  aims  to  realize  \u201cecological \ncivilization\u201d;15 (ii) the National Agricultural Sustainable Development Plan, 2015\u20132030 (footnote \n10), which promotes agricultural reform and modernization; (iii) ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030\u2019s operational \npriorities for rural development and food security and strengthening governance and institutional \ncapacity;16 (iv) the country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020, which aims to improve \nthe  PRC\u2019s  environment  and  manage  climate  change  by  realizing  \u201cecological  civilization\u201d;17 (v) \nADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020, which aims to increase efficiency and productivity in \n\n                                                \n11  Government of the PRC. 2016.

The County Project Management Offices (CPMO) will serve as the project \nimplementation units, which will be responsible for the daily implementation of project activities \nand  quality  control.  The  proposed  institutional  arrangements  are  based  on  the ADB-financed \nComprehensive Agriculture  Development  Project  (footnote  23)  and  take  into  account  five  key \nlessons: first, to effectively coordinate and manage project activities across multiple provinces, \noverall  coordination  at  the  state  level  is  required.  Second,  already  being  responsible  for \nagricultural infrastructure investment and development projects, the PPMOs and CPMOs have \nexisting skills in procurement and will be able to quickly learn and adopt ADB\u2019s regulations and \nrequirements. Third, PPMOs and CPMOs existing financial management capacity supports strong \nfinancial management and timely project disbursement. Fourth, proven operational mechanisms \nare in place to streamline project management including the annual work planning, monitoring, \nand  reporting,  thus  reducing  the  time  for  the  project  to  become  effective  and  ensuring  overall \nmanagement  during  implementation.  Finally,  established  and  tested  implementation  manuals \nexist from the ongoing project that will be used to guide financial management, procurement, and \nproject  progress  as  well  as  safeguard  monitoring  and  reporting.  The \nimplementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM. \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements \nJune 2019\u2013June 2024 \n30 June 2024 \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date  \nEstimated loan closing date  31 December 2024 \nManagement: \n(i)   Oversight body \n(ii)   Executing agency \n\n(iii)  Key implementing \n\nagencies \n\n(iv)  Implementation units \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs \nNational Project Management Office  \nOffice for Comprehensive Agriculture Development, Farmland Construction \nand Management Department, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs  \nProvincial Project Management Offices for the provinces of Guizhou, Hubei, \nHunan,  Sichuan,  and  Yunnan;  and  for  Chongqing  Municipality  through \nrespective provincial and/or municipal government \nCounty  Project  Management  Offices  of  47  cities  and/or  counties  through \ntheir respective government \nNational competitive bidding \nShopping \nQuality- and cost-based selection, \nconsultant qualifications selection, \nand/or individual consultant selection  \n\n$316.7 million \n$3.2 million \n$3.1 million \n \n\n521 contracts \n56 contracts \nmultiple \ncontracts \n\n                                                \n27 The Office for Comprehensive Agriculture Development, the executing agency for Loan 2943-PRC (footnote 23), \nwas relocated from the Ministry of Finance to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs.

The  technical \nfeasibility was confirmed to be adequate after detailed examination of the project\u2019s compatibility \nwith local conditions. A climate risk and vulnerability assessment rated the climate change impact \non the project as medium high because of projected increases in annual mean temperatures and \nprecipitation as well as more intense and frequent extreme weather events (e.g., droughts, severe \nstorms). The project addresses these concerns through the application of water-saving irrigation \nmeasures, better crop varieties, and stronger disease control. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nB. \n \nThe economic analysis indicated that the project is economically viable, with an overall \n24. \neconomic \ninternal  rate  of  return  of  17.7%  and  an  economic  net  present  value  of \nCNY3,511.3 million.  The  analysis  also confirmed  the  economic  viability  of  all  subprojects,  with \neconomic internal rates of return between 12.4% and 22.4%. The sensitivity analysis indicated \nthat the project is robust to the negative scenarios examined, such as an increase in investment \ncosts,  a  reduction  in  revenues,  and  an  increase  in  operation  and  maintenance  costs.  The  full \neconomic  benefits  of  the  project  are  expected  to  be  significantly  higher  because  some  effects \nsuch  as  ecological  benefits  are  not  easily  quantifiable.  The  financial  analysis  included  an \nassessment of the project\u2019s financial sustainability, and of the financial management capacity of \nthe executing and implementing agencies. The financial sustainability assessment covered the \nfiscal  impact  of  counterpart  funding  for  the  project  and  incremental  recurrent  costs  such  as \noperation and maintenance expenditures. It confirmed the financial sustainability of the project, \nand the fiscal impacts are well within the government\u2019s projected revenue capacities.28 \n\nGovernance \n\nC. \n \n25. \nThe  financial  management  risk  before  considering  mitigation  measures  is  moderate \nmainly because of a moderate inherent risk, low control risk, and the comparatively high level of \nfinancial management capacities. Measures to mitigate the identified financial management risks \nare in the financial management assessment.29 The procurement risk assessment confirmed that \nthe implementing agencies, which will conduct procurement through a procurement agency and \nwith the assistance of ADB and the consultants, have adequate procurement capacity to comply \n\n                                                \n28 For all five provinces and one municipality, the counterpart funding commitment and incremental recurrent costs are \n\nless than 0.01% of projected revenue. \n\n29 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and the Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the NPMO. The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nD. \n \n26. \nPoverty and social. The project is classified as targeted intervention-geographic (TI-G) \nfor poverty reduction. The project\u2019s support for rural livelihoods will benefit 1.787 million people in \npoor  and  less  developed  rural  areas\u2014724  villages,  144  townships,  and  47  counties\u2014of  five \nprovinces and one municipality. Of these 31 counties are national- and/or provincial-level poverty \ncounties, and the poverty ratio in the project area is high.30 The project will significantly contribute \nto poverty reduction by involving many farmers in the development of high-quality farmland, by \nintroducing modern farming and environmental management practices as well as voluntary land \nleasing, and by building human capital. The project will provide 25,078 full-time and 45,883 part-\ntime jobs for local people, including the poor, ethnic minorities, and women. Consultations with \nfarmers  and  stakeholders  took  place  during  project  preparation,  and  resulting  measures  were \nincluded in the social development action plan. \n\n27. \nGender.  The  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  It  will  particularly \nbenefit women, who are the majority workforce in the agriculture sector. In the medium and long \nterm, the newly restored high-quality farmland and modern farming practices will expand women\u2019s \naccess  to  economic  opportunities.  The  environmental  management  and  training  programs  will \nincrease their capacity and improve their living environment and quality of life. In the short term, \nthe  project  will  provide  women  with  access  to  construction  and  operation  jobs  during \nimplementation.  It  will  increase  women\u2019s  voice  in  decision  making  through  their  active \nparticipation  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  project  activities.  A  gender  action  plan  was \nprepared based on gender analyses and local consultations; and it includes specific targets for \nwomen, including at least (i) 40% participation of women in design and implementation of farming \nand environmental management; (ii) 40% participation of women in training and capacity building \nfor farmers; (iii) 30% of jobs for women in project construction and operation works; (iv) 40% of \njobs for women in the operations of farmer cooperatives; and (v) 30% participation by women in \ntraining provided to each CPMO and/or PPMO. Key gender indicators were included in the design \nand monitoring framework. \n\nSafeguards \n\nE. \n \n28. \ncategories are as follows:31 \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B,  and  an  initial \n29. \nenvironmental examination and consolidated environmental management plan was prepared by \nthe NPMO and PPMOs in accordance with the requirements of the Safeguard Policy Statement \nand was disclosed publicly and posted on the ADB website on 1 October 2018. These documents \nare consistent with and complement the domestic environmental impact assessment report that \n\n                                                \n30 In  2016, the poverty  incidence  in  the  project  areas  was 21%  in  Yunnan, 15%  in  Guizhou,  6%  in  Sichuan,  5%  in \n\nHunan, and 3% in Hubei provinces, and 4% in Chongqing Municipality. \n\n31 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fmeets the requirements of the PRC\u2019s Environmental Impact Assessment Law (2016) and relevant \nregulations.32  \n\n30. \nThe environmental assessment confirmed that the project is expected to generate multiple \nand  significant  environmental  benefits,  such  as  (i)  a  decrease  in  the  application  rate  and total \nquantity of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and contribution to the control of NPS pollution in \nthe project region; (ii) less soil erosion and better soil quality; (iii) recycling of agricultural waste \nand its reuse as fertilizer resource, and promotion of green agricultural development; (iv) better \nwater use efficiency; and (v) stronger climate resilience. These will contribute to the improvement \nof the Yangtze River\u2019s ecological and environmental quality, and the development of sustainable \nagriculture. Major adverse impacts were not identified. Some counties may increase their overall \nwater use, but they are all located in areas where water resources are more abundant. Potential \nerosion  risks  can  be  mitigated  adequately.  The  impacts  on  water  quality  or  eutrophication  are \nconsidered  negligible  because  the  use  of  agrochemicals  per  hectare  will  be  reduced.  Project \nactivities will not be carried out in environmentally sensitive areas. It is expected that all impacts \nwill  be  prevented  or  minimized  to  an  acceptable  level  by  implementing  the  environmental \nmanagement plan and monitoring program. \n\n31. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  C).  The  project  will  not  involve  involuntary  land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts. Of an estimated total 1,400,622 mu of land area under the \nproject construction activities, 1,348,905 mu is managed and operated by the beneficiary farmers, \nwhere  agricultural  activities  will  be  undertaken  that  do  not  involve  any  land  use  rights  transfer \n(LURT).33 The  construction  of  farming  facilities  will  take  place  on  existing  rights  of  way  or  on \nunutilized  land  (5,379  mu)  donated  by  beneficiary  villages.  The  plantation  activities  will  be \nundertaken mostly on unutilized slopes (45,938 mu) leased by cooperatives. In addition, existing \nstate-owned land (400 mu) will be used for bridge and embankment upgrades. A due diligence \nreview of the LURT and donation agreements confirmed that these are voluntary and based on \nconsultations and provide fair benefits to farmers. In addition, a LURT framework was prepared \nfor future transfers that may be needed during project implementation. Consultations were held \nduring project preparation with local people, village committees, and farmer cooperatives, who \nwill be further consulted during project implementation. Specific grievance redress mechanisms \nwere  set  up  and  incorporated  into  the  LURT  framework.  The  project  will  engage  an  external \nmonitoring agency to verify or monitor the LURT agreements, and semiannual social monitoring \nreports will be submitted to ADB during project implementation. \n\n32. \nIndigenous  peoples  or  ethnic  minorities  (category  B).  The  project  area  in  Guizhou \nProvince has 44.19% beneficiaries belonging to ethnic minorities and 27 ethnic minority villages. \nThe project area in Yunnan Province has 4.6% beneficiaries belonging to ethnic minorities and \nfour ethnic minority villages. Project areas in other provinces either do not have or have only very \nsmall  percentages  of  scattered  ethnic  minority  populations.  The  ethnic  minority  communities, \nparticularly in Guizhou and Yunnan provinces, are expected to benefit from the project through \nemployment opportunities, modern agriculture, better environmental management, and capacity \nbuilding. The  ecological protection  activities are not  expected to  involve impacts  of  involuntary \ndisplacement  or  restrictions  for  ethnic  minorities.  An  ethnic  minority  development  plan  was \nprepared in consultation with relevant stakeholders, including ethnic minority communities. The \nplan will promote ethnic minority communities\u2019 participation in and benefits from project activities, \n\n                                                \n32 Government of the PRC, People\u2019s Congress. 2003.

The  plan  was  disclosed  publicly  and \nposted on the ADB website on 6 December 2017. \n\n33. \nCapacity  for  social  measures.  The  NPMO  has  experience  in  implementing  an  ADB \nproject, but most PPMOs and CPMOs do not. To implement the social measures properly (i) the \nNPMO, the PPMOs, and the CPMOs will each appoint focal social staff; (ii) focal social staff will \nbe  provided  with  training  in  social  measures;  (iii)  consultants  will  be  recruited  to  assist  in  the \nimplementation and internal monitoring of social measures; and (iv) an independent monitoring \nagency will be recruited for external monitoring. \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nF. \n \nThe risk assessment of the overall project is medium, and the benefits and impacts are \n34. \nexpected  to  outweigh  the  costs.  The  risks,  which  were  rated  either  low  or  moderate,  and  the \nmitigation measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.34 \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \n35. \nThe government and the NPMO have assured ADB that the implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin  the  PAM  and  loan  documents.  The  government  and  the  NPMO  have  agreed  with  ADB  on \ncertain  covenants  for  the  project,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  loan  and  project  agreements. \nAdditionally,  no  withdrawal  from  the  ADB  loan  account  will  be  made  for  any  civil  works  until \nconfirmation is obtained from the government in a manner satisfactory to ADB that the relevant \nbeneficiaries have committed to providing their in-kind contributions. \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n36. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$300,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Yangtze River Green Ecological Corridor \nComprehensive  Agriculture  Development  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  in \nregular terms, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n\n \n\n17 October 2018\n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n \n\n                                                \n34 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nEnvironmental protection, rehabilitation, and management of the Yangtze River improved (Yangtze River Economic \nBelt Development Plan, 2016\u20132030)a \n\n \n\nData Sources and \nReporting  \n\n \n \na.
