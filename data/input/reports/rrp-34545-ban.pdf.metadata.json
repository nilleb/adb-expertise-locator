The  Project  will  also  establish  a  socioeconomic\nrehabilitation fund to provide microcredit facilities for village\nreconstruction and income restoration activities.\n\nClassification\n\nPrimary: \nEconomic Growth\nSecondary:  Poverty Reduction\n\nEnvironment Assessment\n\nCategory B\n\nRationale\n\nThe  principal  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  rehabilitate\ndamage caused by the 2000 floods in the southwest region\nof  Bangladesh,  thereby  enabling  restoration  of  normal\neconomic  and  social  activity.  In  developing  an  urgent\nresponse to the crisis, account was taken of the following:\n(i) scale and extent of flood damage; (ii) response of other\nrelief  agencies  and  external \nfinancing  agencies;  (iv)\nGovernment capacity to respond to the disaster; (v) impact\nof  the  floods  on  the  poor,  particularly  given  that  the  area\nwas not flood-prone; (v) ongoing Asian Development Bank\n(ADB)  and  other  financing  agency  activities  in  different\nsectors  in  the  areas  to  ensure  complementarity  of  effort;\n(vi) response of civil society; and (vii) need for a structured\nto  deal  with  disasters.\ncommunity-based  mechanism \nParticular note was taken of the need to identify (i) areas in\nwhich rehabilitation would have a substantial impact on the\neconomic  and  social  welfare  of  communities,  and  (ii)\ninnovative  approaches  to  ensure  assistance  reaches  the\npoor.\n\nThe Project will address restoration and rehabilitation of (i)\nnational,  regional,  and  type-A  feeder  roads;  (ii)  growth\ncenter  markets,  type-1  rural  roads  and  type-B  feeder\nroads;  (iii)  water  resources  (embankments  and  drainage\nfacilities);  (iv)  railways  (tracks  and  facilities);  (v)  public\nhealth  engineering  (community  sanitation  and  water\nsupply);  and  (vi)  agricultural  development  facilities  (seed\nmultiplication  farms).  In  addition  to  the  sector-specific\ninterventions,  a  needs-focused,  community  directed,\nfund  managed  by  a\nsocioeconomic \nnongovernment  organization  has  been  set  up  to  ensure\nthat \nrehabilitation  needs  of  affected\ncommunities, particularly the poor, are addressed.\n\nthe  economic \n\nrehabilitation \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n\fCost Estimates\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nLoan Amount and Terms\n\niii\n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project,  including  service  charge\nduring  construction, \nis  estimated  at  $84.9  million\nequivalent,  comprising  foreign  exchange  costs  of  $29.9\nmillion (about 35 percent of the total project cost) and local\ncurrency costs of $55.0 million equivalent (65 percent).\n\nForeign\nExchange\n29.9\n0.0\n29.9\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n37.9\n17.1\n55.0\n\nTotal\nCost\n67.8\n17.1\n84.9\n\n($ million)\n\nPercent\n\n80\n20\n100\n\nSource\nADB\nGovernment\nTotal\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank.\n\nAn  ADB  loan  equivalent  in  various  currencies  to  Special\nDrawing Rights 42,747,000 ($54.8 million equivalent) from\nthe  Special  Funds  resources,  which  together  with  the\napplication of $13.0 million equivalent in loan savings from\nongoing ADB projects, will represent 80 percent of the total\nProject  cost.  The  repayment  period  will  be  32  years,\nincluding a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge\nof  1  percent  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent\nthereafter. The remaining local currency cost ($17.1 million\nequivalent, 20 percent of total project costs) will be met by\nthe Government from its own resources.\n\nfor \n\n(EAs) \n\nThe  executing  agencies \nthe  six  project\ncomponents  are:  (i)  Part  A,  Roads  and  Highways\nDepartment for national, regional, and type-A feeder roads;\n(ii) Part B1, Local Government Engineering Department for\ntype-B feeder roads, type-1 rural roads, and growth center\nmarkets;  and  Part  B2,  Department  of  Public  Health\nEngineering for community water supply and sanitation; (iii)\nPart  C,  Bangladesh  Railway  for  railway  infrastructure  and\nfacilities;  (iv)  Part  D,  Bangladesh  Water  Development\nBoard  for  water  management  and  drainage  facilities;  (v)\nPart  E,  Palli  Karma  Sahayak  Foundation \nthe\nsocioeconomic rehabilitation fund; and (vi) Part F, Ministry\nof Agriculture for seed multiplication farms.\n\nfor \n\nEach EA will be responsible for implementing its respective\npart  of  the  Project,  which  will  consist  of  a  series  of\nsubprojects. Other than Part E, implementation will largely\nutilize  existing  project \nimplementation  arrangements.\nOverall  project  coordination  will  be  the  responsibility  of  a\nproject  steering  committee  chaired  by  a  Member  of  the\nPlanning  Commission,  which  will  monitor  implementation,\n\nPeriod of Utilization             \n\nUntil 30 December 2003\n\nExecuting Agencies\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n\fProcurement\n\nConsulting Services\n\niv\n\nresolve  interagency  issues  and  procedural  problems,  and\nensure counterpart funding.\n\nthe \n\nto  ADB  approval  of \n\nAdvance  action  and  retroactive  financing  have  been\napproved  for  eligible  expenditures  after  the  date  of\nappraisal,  subject \nloan.\nProcurement of goods and services to be financed by ADB\nwill be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for\nProcurement. Equipment  and  materials  will  be  procured\nunder international competitive bidding for items valued at\nmore  than  $1,000,000  equivalent  or  by  international\nshopping  if  the  value  is  $1,000,000  equivalent  or  less.\nEquipment or materials costing less than $100,000 will be\nprocured  on  a  direct  purchase  basis.  The  Government\u2019s\nlocal competitive bidding procedures, which are acceptable\nto  ADB,  will  be  followed  for  civil  works  contracts.  To\nencourage  the  participation  of  local  residents  (especially\nwomen) and provide them with employment opportunities,\nthe  civil  works  for  small  earthworks,  estimated  to  cost\n$2,500 equivalent or less in  each case, may be awarded\nto  labor-contracting  societies  in  accordance  with  the\nrespective  EA\u2019s  standard  procurement  procedures,\nincluding force account, acceptable to ADB.\n\n(ii) \n\nand \n\nformulate \n\nsubprojects; \n\nThe  Project  will  require  a  total  of  105  person-months  of\ninternational  and  560  person-months  of  domestic\nconsulting  services.  The  consultants  will  help  the  EAs  (i)\nidentify \nprepare\nspecifications,  design,  and  cost  estimates;  (iii)  evaluate\nbids  and  award  contracts;  (iv)  supervise  construction  and\nquality,  and  cost  control  including  issuing  certificates  for\npayment; and (v) report on progress.

To save time, and in view of the fact\nthat  the  EAs  have  already  engaged  consultants  under\nrelated  ADB-assisted  projects,  direct  engagement  of\nconsultants  will  be  undertaken,  as  provided  under  these\nguidelines.  Where  required,  and  at  the  request  of  the\nGovernment,  ADB  will  assist  in  the  selection  process  by\nundertaking  evaluation  of  the  consultants  in  accordance\nwith  procedures  already  agreed  upon  by  ADB  and  the\nGovernment.\n\nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date\n\n30 June 2003\n\n\fv\n\nProject Benefits & Beneficiaries\n\nthe \n\nThe  benefits  of  the  emergency  loan  will  be  evident  in  the\nspeedy  rehabilitation  of  infrastructure  and  facilities  in  the\naffected  areas,  which  have  not  experienced  floods  in  60\nyears. Flood disasters affect the poor disproportionately in\nterms of health, housing, employment, livelihood, and food\nsecurity.  Through \nrehabilitation  of  public  and\ncommunity  infrastructure,  the  Project  will  help  to  restore\nsocial  and  economic  activities  disrupted  by  the  floods,\nparticularly  in  village  reconstruction.  The  Project  will\nreduce  flooding  and  waterlogging  of  agricultural  land,\nbenefiting  residents,  and  farmers  in  low-lying,  flood-prone\nareas.  Improved  community  water  and  sanitation  facilities\nwill  help  reduce  risk  of  health-related  problems  and\nimprove  quality  of  life.  Aside  from  relieving  human  and\nsocietal distress, the Project will have significant economic\nbenefits. The civil works under the rural roads rehabilitation\ncomponents alone are expected to provide about 262,500\nperson-days  of  employment  to  local  skilled  and  unskilled\nlabor.  The  Project  will  help  bring  the  farmlands  in  six\ndistricts  back  to  productivity  and  allow  people  to  regain\nemployment and to generate incomes of their own instead\nof \nrelying  on  Government  emergency  assistance.\nRehabilitation of vital infrastructure will allow resumption of\ncommunication  links  and  economic  activity  disrupted  by\nflood  damage.  The  involvement  of  Palli  Karma  Sahayak\nFoundation,  a  highly  regarded  apex  microcredit  financing\nagency, will ensure that the critical needs of flood-affected\nfamilies for settlement development and income restoration\nactivities are met quickly and efficiently.\n\n\fvi\n\n\fvii\n\n\fviii\n\n\fI.\n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\n1.\nI submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on (i) a proposed\nloan  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Southwest  Flood  Damage  Rehabilitation\nProject, and (ii) a proposal for a change in scope, implementation arrangements, reallocation of\nloan  proceeds,  and  reemployment  of  loan  savings  from  ongoing  projects  in  Bangladesh  for\nrehabilitation of flood damage.\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nDuring  late  September  and  early  October  2000  southwest  Bangladesh,  an  area\ncustomarily  not  flood-prone,  experienced  severe  flooding.  The  rapidity  and  magnitude  of\nfloodwaters affected an area quite unprepared for a disaster of these nature and caused widespread\ndamage to infrastructure, agriculture, community facilities, and personal property. The Government\nrequested emergency assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the rehabilitation\nof flood-damaged facilities. ADB responded promptly by fielding the Appraisal Mission during 30\nOctober-16  November.1  The  objectives  of  the  Mission  were  to  (i)  assess,  together  with  the\nagencies  concerned,  the  extent  of  flood  damage  and  rehabilitation  requirements  in  various\nsectors;  (ii)  determine  what  resources  could  be  made  available  from  ongoing  projects;  (iii)\nprepare a flood damage rehabilitation project to finance urgent rehabilitation requirements; and\n(iv)  explore  the  possibility  of  establishing  a  community  needs-based  social  fund  that  could  be\nused to meet postdisaster rehabilitation requirements.\n\n3.\nThe Mission met with officials of ministries and agencies concerned, representatives of\nexternal  financing  agencies,  and  national  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  Bangladesh\nResident  Mission  staff  participated  in  a  multiagency  mission  that  included  various  United\nNations  agencies,  and  bilateral  and  multilateral  financing  agencies.  The  Mission  visited  the\naffected  areas  to  initiate  a  needs  assessment  survey  and  hold  field  discussions  with  affected\npersons,  local  governments,  and  NGOs.  In  preparing  the  Project,  the  Mission  drew  upon  the\nfindings of the various assessment teams, NGO reports, Government estimates, and consultant\nassessments to develop a picture of the extent of damage and the rehabilitation requirements.\nThe Mission established the need for a new loan that together with savings from four ongoing\nprojects  would  meet  the  immediate  needs  for  rehabilitation  in  five  sectors,  as  well  as  provide\nfunds  for  socioeconomic  rehabilitation  through  a  fund  established  in  a  leading  NGO.  The\nMission\u2019s findings were presented in an aide memoire that was confirmed by the Government\nduring a wrap-up meeting held on 15 November 2000. A summary of ADB\u2019s assistance package\n(the Project and loan savings) for flood damage rehabilitation is presented in Appendix 1.\n\nA.\n\nFloods in Bangladesh\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n4.\nThe  deltaic  nature  of  Bangladesh  makes  it  susceptible  to  frequent  flooding,  which\nreplenishes  soils,  but  varies  enormously  in  extent  and  severity.  The  Ganges  (known\ndownstream as the Jamuna), Brahmaputra, and Meghna are the three major rivers that cause\n                                                \n1 The  Mission  comprised  A.  Akanda,  Senior  Transport  Specialist/Mission  Leader;  S.W.  Handayani,  Social\nDevelopment  Specialist;  S.  Hutaserani,  Senior  Economist;  E.  Ouano,  Senior  Environment  Specialist;  K.H.  Ryu,\nProject Engineer; M. Noguchi, Counsel; and C. Vandenabeele, Counsel. The Mission benefited from the guidance\nof P. Suphaphiphat, Resident Representative, BRM, and the participation of BRM staff (J.R. Cahoon, J. Mahmood,\nO. Shrestha, M. Subroto, and K.H. Talukdar) and missions in the field led by H. Tucker, Forestry Specialist; and W.\nAzmin, Health Specialist. The Mission was assisted by H. Zillur Rahman, Poverty Reduction Specialist/Consultant.\n\n\f2\n\nmuch  of  the  flooding  during  the  monsoons.  However,  the  catchment  areas  for  monsoon  rains\nare largely outside Bangladesh \u2014 in Bhutan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, India, and Nepal.\nOver the years, floods have increased in frequency and severity. The most recent major flood\nwas in 1998 in which 52 districts covering about 60 percent of the country were inundated over\nan 11-week period. The 2000 flood was unlike the 1987, 1988, and 1998 floods, which resulted\nfrom large inflows in the major rivers and covered extensive areas of Bangladesh.\n\n5.\nIn late September 2000, extremely heavy rainfall \u2014 estimated at 1,700 millimeters (mm)\nover  5-7  days  \u2014  was  experienced  in  the  upper  catchment  areas  of  West  Bengal  between\nHooghly  and  Nadia  districts,  causing  massive  overflows,  primarily  in  the  Bhagirathi  and\nMathabhanga rivers, that crossed into Bangladesh. The floodwaters from West Bengal entered\nthe  country  through  the  districts  of  Chuadanga,  Jessore,  Jhenaidah,  and  Meherpur,  down  to\nSatkhira.  Heavy  rainfall  in  southwest  Bangladesh  at  about  the  same  time  exacerbated  the\nsituation,  spreading  the  floods  to  Kushtia,  and  parts  of  Magura.  The  total  affected  area  was\nabout  3,300  square  kilometers,  and  the  total  affected  population  about  2  million  as  shown  in\nTable  1.  Over  1  million  had  to  be  housed  in  temporary  shelters.  The  floodwaters  caused\nwidespread  damage  to  infrastructure  (roads,  water  management  and  drainage,  irrigation\nfacilities, schools, health centers), agriculture, community facilities (water supply and sanitation),\nand personal property.\n\nTable 1: Heavily Affected Areas and Population\n\n District\n\nTotal Population\n\nAffected Population\n\nTotal Area\n(km 2)\n\nAffected Area\n(km 2)\n\nChuadanga\nJessore\nJhenaidah\nKushtia\nMeherpur\nSatkhira\n   Total\n\n1,170\n2,594\n1,189\n1,672\n620\n3,858\n11,103\n\n               920,000\n            1,858,106\n            1,393,674\n            1,501,126\n               498,189\n            1,597,178\n            7,768,273\n\n       702\n       603\n       428\n       403\n       403\n       700\n    3,239\n\n           400,000\n           552,813\n           200,000\n           250,000\n           250,000\n           357,000\n                   2,009,813\n\nkm 2   = square kilometer\nSource:  Rapid United Nations InterAgency Needs Assessment in the Flood Affected Areas of Southwestern\nBangladesh. 9 October 2000. Preliminary estimates.\n\n6.\nBy  early  October,  the  damage  in  the  southwest  area  was  estimated  at:  six  districts\nseverely  affected,  2-3  million  persons  affected  with  1+  million  in  temporary  shelters,  and\n500,000 houses destroyed, and 230,000 partially damaged. Infrastructure damage included 66+\nhealth centers; 850+ schools; and 35+ growth center markets; 600 km of national, regional and\ntype-A,  roads;  680  km  type-B  and  rural  roads;  246  km  of  embankments,  437  water  control\nstructures, and 863 drainage canals; 800+ bridges and culverts on major and rural roads; and\n128 km of railways and 7 bridges. There were less than 50 fatalities. 154,000 hectares (ha) of\ncrops area was destroyed, and 103,000 ha of shrimp and fish farms.\n\n7.\nUnlike many parts of Bangladesh, the southwest region is generally not flood-prone as\n75  percent  of  the  land  is  high  and  medium  high.  The  last  flood  that  local  residents  can  recall\nwas over 60 years ago. Hence, the rapidity and magnitude of floodwaters affected an area quite\nunprepared for such a disaster. Over the years, the buildup of infrastructure (particularly east-\nwest  feeder  roads),  extensive  construction  of  shrimp-farm  embankments,  dilapidation  of\ndrainage  facilities  and  water  control  structures,  siltation  in  rivers  and  canals  (many  of  which\nbegan  dying  several  years  ago),  and  lack  of  attention  to  drainage  patterns  has  created  a\n\n\f3\n\nsituation  that  has  significantly  slowed  the  recession  of  floodwaters.  The  waters  continued  to\ncover most areas even six weeks after the first onrush.\n\n8.\nThe  populations  affected  by  the  waters  have  little  in  the  way  of  coping  strategies,\nparticularly  the  many  who  have  lost  their  entire  possessions  and  currently  face  a  tenuous\nexistence in the relief camps. Those who managed to salvage a few possessions have had to\nresort to distress sales, particularly of livestock for which fodder and facilities were not available,\nto generate income. The evident immediate needs are for food, shelter, clothing, medicine, and\nsanitation  facilities.  In  the  medium  term,  agricultural  rehabilitation  will  be  a  priority  \u2014  crops\n(much  of  the aman  standing  crop  has  been  destroyed,  and  the  planting  of  winter boro  will  be\ndelayed),  livestock,  fisheries  (particularly  hatcheries),  agroforestry,  and  homestead  gardens.\nReconstruction  of  village  facilities  and  housing  \u2014  most  houses  in  the  area  were  of  sun-dried\nmud that disintegrated in the flooding \u2014 will also be a priority, and financial resources in grants\nand microcredit will be needed.\n\nB.\n\nImpact of the 2000 Floods\n\n1.\n\nMacroeconomic Outlook\n\n9.\nIn the aftermath of the 1998 floods, the growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) in\nFY1999  slowed  due  to  (i)  disruptions  of  the  production  and  transportation  systems  of  the\nmanufacturing  sector  (including  the  export  sector);  (ii)  crop  damage  and  shortage  of  food\nsupplies; (iii) increased import of foodgrains; (iv) increased Government spending, fiscal deficits,\nand  borrowing  from  the  banking  system  to  recoup  the  losses;  and  (v)  increased  inflation.  As\nshown in Table 2, manufacturing growth in FY1999 dropped by almost half to 4.9 percent from\nthe preflood level of 8.3 percent in FY1998. Export growth decreased from 16.8 percent to 2.9\npercent  between  FY1998  and  FY1999,  while  import  growth  increased  from  5.1  percent  to  6.6\npercent, thereby raising the current account deficit from 1.1 percent of GDP to 1.4 percent. At\nthe same time, foreign exchange reserves declined from $1.8 billion to $1.5 billion, equivalent to\nonly  2.3  months  of  imports.  With  greater  need  for  rehabilitation,  Government  spending  and,\nhence, the fiscal deficit increased from 13.3 and 4.1 percent of GDP in FY1998 to 13.8 and 4.8\npercent of GDP, in FY1999. The Government financed the deficit by borrowing from the banking\nsystem;  this  resulted  in  increases  in  money  supply  and  inflation  from  10.2  and  7  percent  in\nFY1998 to 12.8 and 9 percent, in FY1999. Fortunately, the bumper harvest of boro (winter) rice\ncontributed  significantly  to  avoid  an  economic  downturn.  Agriculture  growth  increased  to  4.8\npercent in FY1999 compared with the preflood level of 3.2 percent.  The dampening effect of the\n1998 floods on overall economic growth was thus milder than it would have been, with a slight\ndecline to 4.9 percent in FY1999 as against the preflood level of 5.2 percent in FY1998.\n\n10.\nDuring  FY2000,  prior  to  the  recent  flooding  in  the  southwestern  region  of  the  country,\noverall  economic  performance  was  satisfactory  except  for  poor  fiscal  performance.  Economic\ngrowth  increased  to  5.5  percent  in  FY2000,  mainly  because  of  the  acceleration  of  agricultural\ngrowth to 6.4 percent in the same year.  Such acceleration also contributed to reducing inflation\nto  3.8  percent  in  FY2000.  Manufacturing  growth  increased  slightly  to  5.6  percent  in  FY2000,\nwhereas  service  sector  growth  remained  at  around  6  percent.  Export  growth  increased  to  9\npercent in FY2000, while import growth increased slightly to 6.8 percent. However, due to high\nremittance  growth  of  about  14  percent  in  FY2000,  the  current  account  deficit  dropped  to  1\npercent of GDP. Foreign exchange reserves remained at a low level of $1.5 billion\u2014equivalent\nto only 2.3 months of import. On the fiscal side, the fiscal deficit increased to 6.1 percent of GDP\nin FY2000 due to high Government spending of 15.5 percent of GDP and low revenue collection\nof  8.9  percent  of  GDP.  With  greater  bank  borrowing  to  finance  the  deficit,  money  supply\n\n\f4\n\nincreased to 19 percent in FY2000. Expansionary fiscal and monetary policies could cause high\ninflationary pressure if the forthcoming crop production is much lower than expected.\n\nTable 2: Macroeconomic Indicators\n\nItem\n\nGDP Growth (percent, in constant prices)a\n     Agriculture\n     Manufacturing\n     Services\n\nTotal Revenue (percent of GDP)\nTotal Spending (percent of GDP)\nFiscal Surplus/Deficit (-) (percent of GDP)\n\nMoney Supply (percent change)\nConsumer Prices (percent change, annual average)\n\nExport ($) Growth (percent change)\nImport ($) Growth (percent change)\nCurrent Account Surplus/Deficit (-) (percent of GDP)\nForeign Exchange Reserves (billion $)\nMonths of Import\n\n   GDP  =  Gross Domestic Product\na\n   \nb\n   \nc\n   \n   Sources: Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, World Bank, and staff estimates.\n\n  Based on the new national accounts series, with 1995/96 as base year.\n  Staff estimates.\n  Based on preliminary ADB and World Bank projections.\n\nFY1998\n\nFY1999\n\nFY2000b\n\nFY2001c\n\n5.2\n3.2\n8.3\n5.0\n\n9.3\n13.3\n(4.1)\n\n10.2\n7.0\n\n16.8\n5.1\n(1.1)\n1.8\n2.8\n\n       4.9\n       4.8\n       4.9\n       5.2\n\n       9.0\n     13.8\n      (4.8)\n\n       5.5\n       6.4\n       5.6\n       6.0\n\n       8.9\n     15.5\n      (6.1)\n\n     12.8\n       9.0\n\n     19.0\n       3.8\n\n       2.9\n       6.6\n      (1.4)\n       1.5\n       2.3\n\n       9.0\n       6.8\n      (1.0)\n       1.5\n       2.3\n\n       5.0\n       5.4\n       7.0\n       6.0\n\n       9.0\n     16.0\n      (6.0)\n\n     16.0\n       5.0\n\n       9.0\n       5.5\n      (1.3)\n       1.5\n       2.0\n\n11.\nUnlike  the  nationwide  1998  floods,  the  recent  flooding  was  concentrated  in  the\nsouthwestern region of the country. Although the production of aman rice within the region was\nheavily destroyed, the impact of the recent floods on the country\u2019s overall agriculture sector in\nFY2001 is likely to be limited as the total foodgrains production is estimated to be sufficient to\nmeet  the  total  requirement.  The  impact  on  the  overall  manufacturing  sector  in  FY2001  is  also\nexpected to be mild as the floods affected small-scale enterprises within the region. Although no\nshortage of food supplies is expected, and import of foodgrains on account of floods may not be\nneeded, upward pressure on the overall import bill is expected due to the recent oil price hike.\nOn  the  fiscal  side,  although  the  recent  flood  is  unlikely  to  have  significant  effects  on  overall\nrevenue  collection,  Government  spending  and,  hence,  fiscal  deficit  as  well  as  bank  borrowing\nwill continue to be high in FY2001 to finance rehabilitation needs, in addition to preparation for\nthe forthcoming election. Coupled with the recent increase in oil prices, the resulting inflation in\nFY2001 is expected to be higher than that in FY2000.\n\n2.\n\nRoads and Rural Infrastructure\n\n12.\nThe floods inundated about 60 percent of the land area in seven southwestern districts.\nDamage  to  the  road  network  was  extensive.  Initially,  various  road  links  were  under  water  and\nthe  pavement  structures  became  weaker  as  the  duration  of  inundation  increased.  During  this\ntime,  the  roads  were  still  traversed  by  trucks  and  buses.  Although  the  movement  of  vehicles\ncontributed significantly to the premature deterioration of pavement surfaces, the need to move\npeople and supplies could not be denied. The next phase of road damage occurred when the\nfloodwaters  started  to  recede.  As  the  water  rushed  to  find  convenient  outlets,  embankments\nwere scoured, abutments washed away, and many bridges and culverts damaged or destroyed.\nWith road transport to the southwest districts of the country completely cut off, relief efforts used\n\n\f5\n\nother transport means or longer land routes. In areas most affected by the floods, the social and\neconomic  cost  was  high,  and  complete  recovery  will  require  repair  or  rehabilitation  of  the\ninfrastructure,  including  roads,  bridges,  and  culverts  damaged  by  the  floods.  Damage  is\nsignificant for about 600 kilometers (km) of roads, 1,213 km of embankment, and 800 bridges\nand  culverts.  In  the  reconstruction  effort,  it  will  be  necessary  not  only  to  rehabilitate  damaged\ninfrastructure, but also construct some bridges and culverts at places cut or breached to enable\ndrainage of floodwaters.\n\n3.\n\nWater Management and Drainage Facilities\n\n13.\nThe  recent  floods  damaged  the  water  management  and  drainage  facilities  in  the\nsouthwest  region.  This  infrastructure  was  originally  designed  to  cope  with  normal  floods,  but\nwith  the  recent  major  flood,  substantial  parts  of  these  facilities  became  overloaded  and  broke\ndown.  The  problem  was  aggravated  because  adequate  routine  maintenance  had  not  been\nprovided in previous years to repair damage caused by small floods. Based on an assessment\nfor the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), over $46.0 million would be needed to\nrehabilitate  BWDB  infrastructure,  including  246  km  of  flood  control  embankments,  865  km  of\ndrainage canals, 437 water control structures (minor bridges and culverts), river bank protection\nwork, and other infrastructure.\n\n4.\n\nFoodgrains, Shrimp Farms, and Fishponds\n\n14.\nThe Ministry of Food estimated the country\u2019s total rice and wheat production to be 24.31\nmillion  tons  (t)  in  FY2000,  0.6  million  t  below  the  FY2000  level.  The  original  area  planted  to\naman rice was 5.9 million hectares (ha). With the loss of 0.15 million ha of the aman area from\nrecent  flood,  5.75  million  ha  remains.  Given  the  estimated  aman  yield  of  1.73/ha,  the  total\nquantity  of  aman  produced  would  be  9.9  million  t  while  the  total  quantity  lost  would  be  0.26\nmillion t. The estimated production of aus and boro rice, as well as wheat of 1.55, 11.02, and\n1.84 million t, respectively, the total foodgrain production for FY2001 would be 24.31 million t.\nAfter deducting 10 percent for seeds, feed, wastage, and damage, and including 1.2 million t of\nmaize, total foodgrain production would be 22.96 million t. This would approximately balance the\noverall  foodgrain  requirement  of  21.68  million  t  for  131  million  people  on  an  average\nrequirement  basis  (454  gm/capita/day).  Food  shortage  does  not  appear  to  be  a  problem,  the\nkey issues are the delivery of adequate food resources and the need to accelerate drainage and\nagricultural rehabilitation to ensure that the expected production for 2001 is achieved.\n\nAt  the  affected  area  level,  the  unprecedented  flood  that  started  in  the  third  week  of\n15.\nSeptember engulfed six southwest districts, resulting in a complete loss of about 150,000 ha of\nstanding crops. The main crops \u2014 transplanted aman and horticulture \u2014 were submerged and\nfarmers had no means of protecting the seeds of rabi crops, mainly boro paddy, vegetables, and\nspices.  The  affected  area  is  the  early  vegetable-producing  region  of  the  country.  When  the\nfloods  struck,  most  of  the  vegetable  crops  (eggplant,  country  beans,  cauliflower,  cabbage,\ntomatoes,  gourd)  were  at  various  stages  of  harvesting.  The  total  production  loss  is  about\n420,000  tons  of  rice  and  vegetables  worth  $83.64  million.  About  130,000  hectares  of  aman\npaddy and 24,000 ha of summer vegetables were completely damaged. Among the horticultural\ncrops,  80-90  percent  of  papaya  plantations  and  70-80  percent  of  jackfruit  trees  (highly\nsusceptible to waterlogging) were destroyed. Homestead gardens, among the major sources of\nincome  for  resource-poor  farm  families  headed  primarily  by  women,  were  also  extensively\ndevastated.  Farmers  in  flooded  areas  keep  seeds  for  the  next  cropping  season.  With  over  90\npercent  of  seeds  being  farmer-saved,  the  sudden  flooding  destroyed  most  of  the  seedstocks.\nWith the five seed multiplication farms in the area heavily damaged, a seed crisis is foreseen.\n\n\f6\n\nThe seed multiplication farms need to be rehabilitated urgently to supply seeds to the affected\nfarms  for  the  coming  cropping  season.  Livestock  losses  were  also  substantial,  primarily  with\ndistress  sales  to  generate  income,  lack  of  fodder  (scarcity  of  rice  straw),  and  rapidly\ndeteriorating health of the animals. The loss of livestock represents not only a major asset loss,\nbut  also  constrains  agricultural  rehabilitation  as  the  animals  provide  the  draught  power  for  the\nfields. The flood has affected not only the landowners who have lost their crops, but also many\nof the functionally landless who are dependent on agricultural employment during the harvesting\nseason.\n\n16.\nInformation  from  satellite  images  indicates  that  approximately  8,600  ha  (67  percent)  of\nthe shrimp-farm area was lost due to the recent flood. However, as the floods came at the end\nof the harvesting season, the losses were not as high as anticipated with about 1,200 t valued at\nabout $5.0 million. About 4,300 t of whitefish worth over $2.6 million were also washed away.\nRehabilitation of shrimp-farm and fishpond infrastructure is estimated at over $9.0 million.\n\n5.\n\nSocial Infrastructure\n\n17.\nThe  major  health  problems  caused  by  the  2000  floods  have  been  (i)  communicable\ndiseases such as diarrhea, dysentery, acute respiratory infections, and skin diseases; (ii) those\nrelated  to  water  contamination  and  poor  sanitation.  In  the  34  affected  upazilas,  66  health\ncenters were damaged.  During the floods, 524 treatment and relief centers were set up; 41,391\ncases  of  diarrhea  were  treated,  8,756  cases  of  acute  respiratory  infection,  and  83,827  others.\nBy late October, fewer than 50 deaths had been reported, a remarkably low figure, attributable\nto timely emergency assistance.\n\n18.\nThe  major  needs  in  the  health  sector  were  (i)  rehabilitation  of  damaged  health  care\nfacilities;  (ii)  medicines  and  oral  rehydration  supplements,  and  (iii)  health  education  materials.\nSanitation emerged as a major issue in the temporary relief shelters, particularly for women who\nhad little or no privacy and consequently suffered physiological problems.\n\n19.\nBeing  largely  mud  structures,  over  500  primary  schools  were  extensively  damaged  by\nthe  floods.  Some  350  secondary  schools  were  also  affected,  but  not  necessarily  structurally.\nThe resources provided by ADB\u2019s ongoing Secondary Education Sector Project2 for repair and\nreconstruction  of  secondary  schools  damaged  by  the  1998  flood  will  also  be  used  to  cover\ndamage  from  the  2000  flood.  The  World  Bank-financed  Primary  Education  Development\nProgram provides for the construction of new schools, and reconstruction and rehabilitation of\ndamaged primary schools.\n\nC.\n\nDisaster Response\n\nAs  the  floods  were  unexpected  and  no  early  warning  was  given,  particularly  across\n20.\nborders, preparedness for the 2000 disaster was minimal. Emergency procedures set out in the\nStanding Orders on Disaster were initially applied slowly. Nonetheless, once initiated, resources\nwere soon mobilized by the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MODMR). Particularly\nnoteworthy  was  the  response  of  the  Bangladesh  Army,  local  NGOs,  and  private  firms  and\nindividuals; they provided gruel kitchens, temporary shelters, and provisioning. The Association\nof Development Agencies in Bangladesh (ADAB), the apex NGO body, played a major role in\nmobilizing  resources  from  local  and  international  sources  \u2014  including  NGOs  such  as\nBangladesh  Rural  Advancement  Committee,  Proshika,  Grameen  Bank,  and  OXFAM  \u2014  and\n\n                                                \n2 Loan 1690-BAN(SF): Secondary Education Sector Project, for $60.0 million, approved on 22 June 1999.\n\n\f7\n\norganizing  assistance  through  ADAB  Chapters  in  the  flood-affected  areas.  The  Palli  Karma\nSahayak Foundation (PKSF), an apex microcredit financing NGO, also prepared assessments\nand mobilized credit resources through its partner organizations (POs).\n\nBangladesh  has  a  decentralized  system \n\nin  which\n21.\nadministrative  entities  at  various  levels  (national,  district,  upazila,  and  union)  are  mandated  to\nplay a specific role during and after a disaster. Those roles are specified in the Standing Orders\non Disaster. The entire process is supported by groupings of disaster management committees\nat several levels. The system has not been fully implemented, especially in areas not perceived\nto be disaster prone, such as the southwest region of Bangladesh.\n\nfor  disaster  management \n\n22.\nThe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)-supported disaster management,\ncapacity-building project has helped establish and strengthen the Disaster Management Bureau\nunder the MODMR. International disaster management institutions such as the Asian Disaster\nPreparedness Center have contributed to the project through comprehensive training programs.\nRecently,  UNDP  and \nthe\nits  collaborating  partners  commissioned \nComprehensive  Disaster  Management  Plan  (CDMP)  that  provides  the  program  framework  for\nlong-term risk reduction. Disaster preparedness in the southwest region is a complex issue that\nwill have to be addressed across sectors and closely involve communities to lessen the impacts\nof future floods on human health, and loss of material possessions such as crops, livestock, and\nhousehold  equipment  and  furnishings.  Future  programs  should  address  (i)  warning  and\nmonitoring  systems,  (ii)  emergency  procedures,  (iii)  location  and  preliminary  design  of\nappropriate evacuation centers, (iv) security procedures for items abandoned and left in houses,\n(v)  provision  and  access  of  facilities  during  and  after  floods,  and  (vi)  relief  and  rehabilitation\nprocedures. Drainage of floodwaters is a major long-term issue that will have to be addressed in\nfuture  projects  \u2014  construction  of  proper  drainage  channels,  bridges,  and  culverts;  controls  on\nshrimp-farm growth and infrastructure (particularly miniembankments that impede water flows);\nregional cooperation in exchange of river flow data; dredging of canals; and social mobilization\nto allow empowerment of water management systems to communities and local governments.\n\nformulation  of \n\nthe \n\nD.\n\nAid Coordination and External Assistance\n\nThe  response  of  the  international  community  to  the  disaster  in  southwest  Bangladesh\n23.\nwas quick, with relief operations initiated soon after the initial flood. Overall coordination was led\nby  UNDP,  and  a  postflood  needs  assessment  mission  was  fielded  during  26  October  \u2013  2\nNovember  led  by  the  World  Food  Programme,  comprising  representatives  from  World  Health\nOrganization  (WHO),  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  (FAO),  UNDP,  and  United  Nations\nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF). ADB participated in that mission and fielded a separate poverty and\nneeds  assessment  mission  to  prepare  a  social  fund.  Aid  coordination  has  been  close,  with\ncontinuous  exchange  of  data  and  reports,  and  several  multiagency  meetings;  a  local\nconsultative group meeting was held on 9 November.\n\n24.\nADB\u2019s  response  to  the  emergency  situation  was  immediate,  with  a  reconnaissance-\nappraisal  mission  fielded  only  a  few  weeks  after  the  floodwaters  entered  Bangladesh.  The\nmission coordinated with other agencies in gathering data to prepare an emergency loan, with\nthe intention of submitting the loan proposal for approval within five weeks after appraisal.\n\n25.\nInformation  on  commitments  from  other  agencies  immediately  after  appraisal  indicate\nthat  the  World  Bank  will  be  providing  about  $12.0  million  in  rehabilitation  funds  for  municipal\ninfrastructure  and  $8.0  million  for  major  roads,  both  drawn  from  loan  savings;  World  Food\n\n\f8\n\nProgramme,  $30.0  million;  Department  for  International  Development,  $2.7  million  equivalent\nand UNICEF, $200,000.\n\nE.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nADB has provided emergency assistance to Bangladesh through seven loans,3 as well\n26.\nas through the reallocation of loan savings. Two projects have been postevaluated.4 A review of\nthe  project  performance  audit  reports,  and  organizational  experience  with  rehabilitation\nassistance  indicates  the  following  lessons:  (i)  ADB  must  prepare  rehabilitation  projects  as\nquickly as possible; (ii) projects should be limited to restoring facilities to substantially preflood\nlevels; (iii) implementation periods should be short and, to the extent possible, completed in one\nor two construction seasons; (iv) as project implementation places a heavy burden on EA staff,\na  higher  degree  of  consulting  support  and  ADB  supervision  is  needed  during  implementation,\n(v)  efforts  should  be  made  to  ensure  that  ADB\u2019s  rapid  response  to  disasters  is  matched  by\nequally  quick  action  on  the  part  of  the  Government;  (vi)  beneficiary  participation  in  project\npreparation and implementation must be increased, especially for the maintenance of facilities;\n(vii) environment and social aspects should be considered in project design; (viii) arrangements\nfor disbursement should give EAs quick and simple access to funds; (ix) objectives and scope\nneed  to  be  carefully  defined;  (x)  criteria  for  subproject  selection  should  permit  simple\nprioritization  of  subprojects,  and  short  implementation  periods;  and  (xi)  the  presence  of  a\nsteering  committee  chaired  by  senior  civil  servants  has  the  positive  effect  of  bringing  together\nproject  directors  of  the  many  project  components,  as  well  as  expediting  decision-making\nprocesses and activities to be implemented.\n\nThe flood factor featured prominently in a recent ADB-financed study,5 which observed\n27.\nthat  the  1998  floods  had  policy  implications  for  the  institution.  The  study  recommended  that\nADB continue to support schemes that consider the flood factor in project design, and enhance\nefforts  to  ensure  better  disaster  preparedness  through  a  more  people-centered  approach  to\nmanaging flood impact rehabilitation.\n\n28.\nDespite the complexity of works covering six sectors, 13 subsectors, eight EAs, and 75\npercent  of  the  country  area,  the  implementation  of  the  1998  Flood  Damage  Rehabilitation\nProject  (footnote  3)  has  been  successful.  The  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  continues  to\nmeet on a monthly basis, complemented by periodic reviews by the ADB Bangladesh Resident\nMission, which administers the project. The project is scheduled to close in June 2001, and by\nNovember  2000,  most  works  had  been  completed  for  an  overall  weighted  progress  of  92\npercent.  Procurement  problems  hampered  the  progress  of  the  component  implemented  by\nBangladesh  Railways,  which  achieved  70  percent  completion.  The  experience  has  pointed  to\nthe need to (i) avoid a profusion of small contracts, particularly in urban and rural infrastructure\nworks, as supervision can be difficult; (ii) control the tendency of small contractors to bid far too\n\n                                                \n3  Loan  882-BAN(SF):  Flood Rehabilitation Project,  for  $14.3  million,  approved  on  4  February  1988;  Loan  892-\nBAN(SF): Flood Damage Restoration Project,  for  $40.0  million,  approved  on  30  June  1988;  Loan  941-BAN(SF):\nFlood Damage (Rural Infrastructure) Project,  for  $40.0  million,  approved  on  22  December  1988;  Loan  967-\nBAN(SF): Second Flood Damage Restoration Project, for $80.0 million, approved on 24 August 1989; Loan 1124-\nBAN(SF):  Dhaka Integrated Flood Protection Project,  for  $91.5  million,  approved  on  21  November  1991;  Loan\n1202-BAN(SF): Secondary Towns Integrated Flood Protection Project, for $55.0 million, approved on 3 December\n1992;  and  Loan  1666-BAN(SF):  Flood  Damage  Rehabilitation  Project,  for  $104.0  million,  approved  on  18\nDecember 1998.\n\n4  PEO466,  October  1996.

Simplified approval procedures have been agreed upon with the Government and will be\ncovenanted.  Consulting  inputs  have  been  provided  where  appropriate.  Detailed  criteria  have\nbeen  developed  for  subproject  selection.  In  developing  an  innovative  social  fund  concept,\nparticular  attention  was  paid  to  poverty  reduction  and  delivery  mechanisms  for  effective\noutreach to the poor.\n\nF.\n\nADB\u2019s Country Strategy\n\n30.\nConsistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  medium-term  development  strategy,  ADB\u2019s  country\noperational  strategy  for  Bangladesh  identifies  poverty  reduction  as  its  overall  strategic\nobjective.6  This  will  be  achieved  by  targeting  four  priority  areas:  promotion  of  faster  private\nsector-led  economic  growth,  creation  of  better  development  opportunities  for  the  poor  in  rural\nand  urban  areas,  human  development,  and  environmental  protection.  The  poverty  reduction\nobjective  emphasized  in  the  strategy  was  amplified  in  the  recently  signed  Partnership\nAgreement on Poverty Reduction between ADB and the Government.7 The agreement sets long\nand  medium-term  goals  based  on  the  Government\u2019s  vision  and  plans  for  poverty  reduction  \u2014\nboth  the  income  and  nonincome  aspects.  It  also  guides  ADB\u2019s  medium-term  operations  to\nsupport the Government\u2019s medium-term priorities through pro-poor growth, social development,\nand  good  governance.  To  make  growth  more  pro-poor,  the  strategy  is  to  adopt  an  area\napproach to focus assistance on areas with high concentrations of poverty.\n\n31.\nThe  Project  is  consistent  with  the  country  operational  strategy  and  the  Partnership\nAgreement in that it will rehabilitate key physical and social infrastructure essential to restoring\nnormal levels of economic and social activities. This will, in turn, improve the poverty situation\naggravated  by  the  flood  damage.  The  Project  will  also  contribute  to  clearing  up  the\nenvironmental  damage  caused  by  the  floods.  The  incidence  of  poverty  in  most  of  the  flood-\naffected  districts  in  the  region  varies  between  40-50  percent  compared  with  the  national\naverage  of  44.7  percent.  One  of  those  districts,  Kushtia,  has  a  poverty  incidence  of  over  50\npercent. However, in the postflood situation, poverty has reached alarming proportions owing to\nmassive  income  erosion,  complete  loss  of  physical  assets,  and  debt  accumulation.  Timely\nassistance  is  critical  to  ensuring  that  the  current  poverty  profile  does  not  become  a  long-term\nfeature in southwest Bangladesh.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\n32.\nThe  2000  flood,  not  as  extensive  as  earlier  floods,  was  concentrated  in  southwest\nBangladesh, an area that customarily has been free of floods of significant magnitude. Hence,\nthe  damage  has  been  more  severe  to  the  population,  infrastructure,  crops,  fish  farms,  shrimp\n\n                                                \n6    Asian  Development  Bank.  1999,  Bangladesh Country Operational Strategy: Responding to the Challenge of\n\n7    Asian  Development  Bank  and  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh,  April  2000.

Rural  settlements  have  been  hardest  hit  as\ntraditional mud houses disintegrated with the flooding. The flood water are slow to recede as the\ninfrastructure  network  built  up  over  many  years  of  flood-free  existence  has  affected  drainage\nflows. Given the highly fertile nature and productive potential for production and export earnings,\nit is critical to resume economic activities as quickly as possible, particularly as the aman crop\nhas  been  lost  and  boro  crop  planting  may  be  delayed.  The  cost  of  rehabilitation  is  high  and\ndespite the overall economic health of the country, resources to cope with such a disaster are\nlimited. ADB assistance will avoid the need to divert resources for flood rehabilitation from other\nessential development programs.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nThe principal objective of ADB assistance is to rehabilitate damage caused by the 2000\n33.\nfloods in the southwest region of Bangladesh, thereby enabling restoration of preflood levels of\neconomic and social activity. In developing an urgent response to the crisis, the project design\ntook account of the following: (i) scale and extent of flood damage; (ii) response of other relief\nagencies and external financing agencies; (iv) Government capacity to respond to the disaster;\n(v)  impact  of  the  floods  on  the  poor,  particularly  given  that  the  area  was  not  flood-prone,  (v)\nongoing  ADB  and  other  financing  agency  activities  in  different  sectors  in  the  areas  to  ensure\ncomplementarity  of  effort;  (vi)  response  of  civil  society;  and  (vii)  need  for  a  structured\ncommunity-based mechanism to deal with disasters. Particular note was taken of the need to (i)\nidentify  areas  in  which  rehabilitation  would  have  a  substantial  impact  on  the  economic  and\nsocial welfare of communities, and (ii) innovative approaches to ensure that assistance reaches\nthe poor.\n\n34.\nFive  areas  were  identified  for  ADB  flood  rehabilitation  assistance  (i)  national,  regional,\nand type-A feeder roads; (ii) type-B feeder roads, type-1 rural roads, and growth center markets;\n(iii)  railways;  (iv)  water  management  and  drainage  facilities;  (v)  water  supply  and  sanitation.\nFinancing for these sectors would be provided under a new project. Funds from ongoing ADB\nprojects  were  identified  for  use  to  supplement  the  new  resources.  Complementarity  with  the\nefforts of other external financing agencies will ensure that the use of resources is optimized. In\naddition  to  the  sector-specific  interventions,  a  focused,  community-directed,  NGO-managed\nsocial  fund  was  determined  to  be  an  effective  way  to  ensure  that  the  economic  rehabilitation\nneeds of affected communities, particularly the poor, would be addressed.\n\n35. Within  each  sector,  priorities  were  established  as  follows:  (i)  first,  to  repair  damage  to\nongoing  ADB-assisted  projects  for  which  financing  was  not  available  from  current  sources;  (ii)\nsecond,  to repair damage  to completed ADB projects; (iii) third, to repair damage to non-ADB\nsubprojects in the relevant sector.\n\nRehabilitation  of  damaged  social  infrastructure  and  urban  facilities  can  be  financed  by\n36.\nongoing ADB projects in the education sector and the World Bank\u2019s Municipal Services Project.\nAssistance for the health sector can be provided as emergency relief and through the ongoing\n$3.5 billion Health and Population Sector Program, an assistance program designed to support\nthe  Government\u2019s  Health  and  Population  Sector  Strategy  during  1998-2003.  The  program  is\nsupported by the Government and consortium of assistance agencies, led by the World Bank,\nand including Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), DFID, European Community\n(EU),  France,  Deutsche  Gesellschaft \n(GTZ),  Japan\nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (KfW),  Netherlands,\nNorway,  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation  Agency  (SIDA),  UNDP,  United\nNations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA), and UNICEF. Others supporting the strategy,\n\nf\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit \n\n\f11\n\nbut not members of the Health and Population Program consortium, are ADB through its Urban\nPrimary Health Care Project8 and United States Agency for International Development (USAID)\nthrough NGOs.\n\nThe Project will rehabilitate flood-damaged facilities by providing civil works; equipment,\n37.\nand  materials;  and  consulting  services  for  project  design,  evaluation,  implementation,  and\nsupervision.  The  Project  will  follow  a  sector  approach  as  the  fastest  and  most  appropriate\nresponse  to  an  emergency  situation,  with  subprojects  selected  during  project  implementation.\nThe  sector  approach  allows  rapid  processing  of  the  loan  proposal  in  parallel  with  detailed\nassessment of requirements, and permits a flexible response within the selection criteria agreed\nupon with the Government. Subprojects will consist of a group of similar works, located in the\nsame geographic area that forms the most efficient unit for implementation. In each sector, the\nEA will identify eligible subprojects on the basis of general as well as sector-specific criteria. The\nProject will comprise six components:\n\n1.\n\nPart A:  National, Regional, and Type-A Feeder Roads\n\n38.\nThis  component,  described  in  Appendix  2,  will  involve  rehabilitation  by  the  Roads  and\nHighways Department (RHD) of flood-damaged national and regional roads to full serviceability\nlevels within seven districts: Chuadanga, Kushtia, Jessore, Jhenaidah, Magura, Meherpur, and\nSatkhira, and. One damaged road (Tala-Paikgacha) in Khulna District will also be rehabilitated.\nFor  type-A  feeder  roads,  the  rehabilitation  will  be  limited  to  Jessore,  Jhenaidah,  and  Satkhira,\nwhich  are  the  most  severely  affected  areas.  The  component  will  include  rehabilitation  and\nconstruction  to  appropriate  standards  of  essential  bridges  and  culverts  in  road  sections\nbreached or cut to allow proper drainage of floodwaters. Construction supervision services for\ndetailed  damage  assessment,  subproject  preparation,  and  civil  works  supervision  will  be\nincluded.\n\nDesign  and  construction  of  bridges  and  culverts  should  recognize  the  dynamics  of  the\n39.\nhydrological regime to ensure that appropriate drainage standards are applied. The design team\nshould coordinate with Bangladesh Water Development Board as required, and recognize local\ncustoms and practices in water management.\n\n2.\n\nPart B:  Rural Infrastructure\n\na.\n\nPart B1:  Roads, Structures, and Growth Center Markets\n\n40.\nThe  component,  described  in  Appendix  3,  will  rehabilitate,  within  seven  districts\n(Chuadanga,  Kushtia,  Jessore,  Jhenaidah,  Magura  Meherpur,  Satkhira),  flood-damaged\ninfrastructure  (type-B  feeder  roads,  type-1  rural  roads,  structures  on  both  types,  and  growth\ncenter markets) to operating conditions, including rehabilitation and construction to appropriate\nstandards  of  bridges  and  culverts  in  sections  in  which  breaches  or  cuts  were  necessary  for\ndrainage  of  floodwaters.  The  rehabilitation  will  also  include  growth  center  markets  and\ncommunity  facilities  within  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Local  Government  Engineering  Department\n(LGED).\n\n41.\nDesign  and  construction  of  bridges  and  culverts  should  recognize  the  dynamics  of  the\nhydrological regime to ensure that appropriate drainage standards are applied. The design team\nshould coordinate with BWDB as required, and recognize local customs and practices in water\n\n                                                \n8 Loan 1538-BAN(SF): Urban Primary Health Care Project, for $40.0 million, approved on 16 September 1997.\n\n\f12\n\nmanagement.  Construction  supervision  services  for  detailed  damage  assessment,  subproject\npreparation, and civil works supervision will be included.\n\nb.\n\nPart B2:  Public Health Facilities\n\n42.\nThe  component,  also  described  in  Appendix  3,  involves  the  rehabilitation  by  the\nDepartment  of  Public  Health  Engineering  of  water  supply  (tubewells,  and  upazila  and  district\nwater  supply  systems)  and  sanitation  facilities  in  the  seven  districts  of  the  southwest:\nChuadanga,  Kushtia,  Jessore,  Jhenaidah,  Magura,  Meherpur,  and  Satkhira.  It  will  include  the\nprovision  of  water  supply  (tubewells)  and  sanitation  (latrines)  facilities  at  market  centers  and\nprimary schools that may serve as emergency shelters in the event of a future disaster.\n\n3.\n\nPart C:  Railways\n\n43.\nThe  component,  described  in  Appendix  4,  will  involve  rehabilitation  by  Bangladesh\nRailway of flood-damaged infrastructure and related facilities along affected routes to the level\nof  service  required  to  ensure  regular  operations,  including  (i)  civil  works  to  restore\nembankments, tracks, essential buildings, station roads, and signaling and telecommunications\nfacilities;  and  (ii)  the  construction  and  reconstruction  of  critical  bridges  and  culverts  where  the\nrailway  embankment  has  been  breached  or  drainage  is  essential.  Design  and  construction  of\nbridges  and  culverts  should  recognize  the  dynamics  of  the  hydrological  regime  to  ensure  that\nappropriate drainage standards are applied. The design team should coordinate with BWDB as\nrequired, and recognize local customs and practices in water management. Owing to the limited\nimpact, construction supervision services will not be required.\n\n4.\n\nPart D:  Water Management and Drainage Facilities\n\n44.\nThe  component,  described  in  Appendix  5,  will  involve  rehabilitation  by  BWDB  of  flood-\ndamaged  infrastructure  and  related  facilities  in  the  water  resource  management  subsector,\ncovering sluice gates, embankments, water control structures, and drainage canals. Consulting\nservices required for assistance in procurement and construction supervision will be obtained by\ndirectly  engaging  qualified  consultants  with  experience  in  ADB-assisted  flood  damage\nrehabilitation  projects.  Works  in  other  components  that  will  have  implications  for  drainage  and\nfloodwater  movement  within  the  affected  area  will  be  required  to  liaise  with  BWDB  to  ensure\nthat designs are appropriate. BWDB will also consult with local communities to ensure that local\ncustoms and practices in water management are recognized in subproject designs.\n\n5.\n\nPart E:  Socioeconomic Rehabilitation Fund\n\n45.\nThe concept of a social fund was developed to address the urgent needs of the poor and\ndisadvantaged  in  the  affected  areas.  The  fund  would  respond  to  community  needs  in  village\nreconstruction, livelihood restoration, and other purposes that could be met through an effective\nmicrocredit  facility  that  would  build  on  the  resources  offered  through  emergency  relief\nassistance. Such a fund would thereby initiate a sustainable rehabilitation effort. The importance\nof microcredit in postflood reconstruction is highlighted in several publications.9\n\n                                                \n9  For  example,  S.  Ahmed.  1998.  Coping with Disaster in Bangladesh: PKSF Experience of Flood 1998 and\nMicrocredit,  mimeo,  Dhaka;  S.  Ahmed,  2000.  Post-Flood Rehabilitation: Microcredit Requirements,  1998;  Q.K.\nAhmed et al. November 2000. Perspectives on 1998 Flood, Dhaka.\n\n\f13\n\nThe  Project  will  support  the  creation  of  a  socioeconomic  rehabilitation  fund  (SRF),  to\n46.\nmitigate  the  social  and  economic  impact  of  floods  and  to  improve  the  living  conditions  of  the\npoor  through  speedy  provision  of  loans  for  village  reconstruction,  primarily  rehabilitation  of\nhousing,  and  on-  and  off-farm  income-generating  activities.  The  SRF  will  strengthen\ndecentralized  delivery  mechanisms  by  supporting  local  (government  and  nongovernment)\norganizations  that  are  responsive  to  local  needs,  and  build  institutional  capacity  at  the  local\nlevels.\n\nThe scope of activities funded by the SRF will be based on beneficiary demand and the\n47.\nimplementation capacity of local NGOs. Community participation, demand orientation, and local\norganizational capacity will be used as guiding principles for SRF activities. These principles will\nbe  reflected  in  the  design,  implementation,  and  evaluation  of  the  SRF.  NGO  involvement,\nparticularly local NGOs, will enable the SRF to reach poor and isolated communities, enhance\ncommunity participation, and improve project design and implementation.\n\n48.\nPKSF,  described  in  Appendix  6,  is  a  highly  regarded  organization  in  microcredit-based\nincome generation schemes. It will be the apex microcredit organization for the SRF. PKSF is\nalso the apex institution under the World Bank\u2019s Poverty Alleviation Microfinance Project (1996)\nand  ADB\u2019s  Participatory  Livestock  Development  Project.10    Currently,  PKSF  has  182  partner\norganizations  (POs)  covering  61  of  the  64  districts  of  Bangladesh.  Starting  with  only  6,000\nbeneficiaries  in  1990,  the  credit  program  covered  1.5  million  beneficiaries  in  1998;  90  percent\nare  women.  In  1999,  the  cumulative  loan  amount  stood  at  Tk5,637.0  million,  reflecting  an\naverage annual growth rate of about 125 percent. PKSF\u2019s operating criteria are satisfactory to\nADB,  with  (i)  an  independent  governing  body,  professional  management  and  staff,  and  sound\noperating  policies;  (ii)  reliable  and  transparent  accounting  practices,  management  information\nsystems, and internal audit systems; (iii) accounts audited by reputable external auditors on an\nannual  basis;  and  (iv)  a  loan  recovery  rate  of  98  percent  on  a  continuous  basis.  The\norganization  of  the  SRF  component  will  involve  close  coordination  between  PKSF,  local\ngovernments, and participating POs.\n\n49.\nAll  POs  must  direct  SRF  resources  to  borrower  groups  of  the  poor.  The  first-time\nbeneficiaries  of  the  POs  will  be  persons  who  fulfill  the  following  eligibility  criteria,  as  usually\napplied by PKSF, or other criteria as agreed between PKSF and the POs from time to time: (i)\nare a permanent resident in the project area; (ii) have total assets not exceeding the value of 0.4\nha  of  arable  land  in  their  locality;  and  (iii)  are  members  of  a  savings  group  organized  and\nmonitored directly by the PO. Preference will be given to poor households whose houses were\ndestroyed  in  the  recent  floods.  Loans  by  POs  to  the  final  borrowers  will  be  provided  on\ngenerous terms (at no more than 3-5 percent) and for substantially longer periods than normal,\nreflecting the disaster nature of the facility. PKSF will provide loans to the POs at 1.5 percent,\nrepayable in liberal installments.\n\n50.\nIn  view  of  the  high  cost  of  both  supervised  microcredit  and  social  intermediation\nactivities,  the  Government  has  agreed  that  part  of  the  concessionality  of  the  ADB  loan  will  be\nused  to  provide  an  adequate  interest  spread  to  cover  all  costs  and  provision  for  bad  and\ndoubtful  debts.  The  Government  will  relend  on  an  interest-free  basis,  $10.0  million  equivalent\nfrom loan proceeds to PKSF for the SRF. The Government loan to PKSF will be amortized over\n32  years,  with  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  to  coincide  with  the  amortization  period  of  the  ADB\nloan,  and  to  allow  (i)  the  fund  to  be  replenished,  (ii)  a  revolving  fund  to  be  established  with\nrepayments, and (iii) the fund to be applied to any future disasters.\n\n                                                \n10 Loan 1524-BAN(SF): Participatory Livestock Development Project, for $19.7 million, approved on 19 June 1997.\n\n\f14\n\n51.\n  PKSF  submitted  a  detailed  program  design  for  the  SRF  to  ADB,  including  specific\nlending guidelines, and will designate, within one month after the ADB loan becomes effective, a\nfull-time project coordinator with qualifications and experience acceptable to ADB to oversee the\nimplementation  of  SRF  activities.    PKSF  will  also  provide  an  adequate  number  of  suitable\nqualified professional and support staff to assist the project coordinator to implement the SRF\ncomponent and monitor its subloans to the POs.\n\n6.\n\nPart F: Agriculture\n\n52.\nFive seed multiplication farms in the six districts were damaged by the floodwaters. The\nflood affected not only the landowners, but also many of the functionally landless dependent on\nagricultural employment during the harvesting season. The component, described in Appendix\n7,  will  rehabilitate  the  seed  multiplication  farms  to  supply  seeds  to  the  affected  farms  for  the\ncoming cropping season.\n\nC.\n\nSubproject Selection Criteria and Approval\n\n53.\nAs  rehabilitation  works  will  require  more  detailed  assessments  than  are  currently\navailable,  a  sector  approach  will  be  followed  with  the  identification  of  subprojects  finalized\nduring  project  implementation.  The  subprojects  will  be  identified  and  selected  by  the  EA\nconcerned in accordance with the following general criteria:\n\n(i) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nSubprojects must repair or rehabilitate to appropriate operating and serviceability\nstandards,  damage  caused  by  the  2000  floods  based  on  assessments  carried\nout by consultants selected for that purpose or in the case of Parts C and F, by\nthe  EA,  and  subject  to  technical  review  by  ADB  as  agreed  by  ADB  and  the  EA\nconcerned.  For  activities  financed  under  Part  E,  identification  and  approval  of\nactivities  under  SRF  will  follow  PKSF  rules  and  procedures  for  microcredit\noperations as set out in the subsidiary agreement between the Government and\nPKSF.\n\n(ii) \n\nSubprojects must not include items that represent deferred maintenance.\n\n(iii) \n\nSubprojects must be the least-cost solution.\n\nImplementation of subprojects must be completed within the project period of 30\nmonths.\n\nPriority will be given to subprojects that rehabilitate ongoing or completed ADB-\nfinanced projects.\n\n(vi) \n\nNo other external financing agency is funding any subprojects.\n\n(vii) \n\nSubprojects  comply  with  sector-specific  criteria,  including  environmental  and\ninvoluntary resettlement requirements.\n\n54.\nThe  first  subproject  to  be  carried  out  by  each  EA  (except  for  Part  E)  will  be  subject  to\nprior review and approval by ADB before commencement. Subsequent subprojects (except for\nPart E) costing over $200,000 will also be submitted to ADB for prior review and approval. For\nsubprojects  that  require  construction  of  infrastructure  along  new  alignments  or  involve\n\n\f15\n\nacquisition of land, the EA will prepare an initial environmental examination (IEE) in accordance\nwith  ADB\u2019s  environmental  requirements,  and  submit  the  IEE  to  ADB  on  a  no-objection  basis\nprior  to  construction.  For  projects  that  may  involve  resettlement,  the  EA  will  prepare  a  brief\nresettlement plan for concurrence by ADB prior to commencement of civil works.\n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates\n\n55.\n\nThe tentative cost estimates are in Table 3.

With  application  of  $13.0  million  in  loan  savings  from  ongoing  ADB  projects,  ADB\nfunding represents 80 percent of the total project cost. Together with loan savings, the proposed\nADB financing will cover all of the foreign exchange costs of equipment and materials, and 69\npercent of local currency costs, excluding taxes and duties.

Part of the loan proceeds will be relent by the Borrower to PKSF and provided on an\ninterest-free  basis  under  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement  on  terms  and  conditions  satisfactory  to\nADB, with a repayment period of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years. For all other EAs,\nthe loan proceeds will be made available through budgetary allocations.\n\n58.\nLocal cost financing is justified given the existing fiscal situation in Bangladesh and the\nincreased emergency expenditure required for relief and rehabilitation works. ADB financing of\ntotal project costs is proposed to be 80 percent, which exceeds the current cost-sharing limit of\n70 percent for Bangladesh as a B1 country.11 The need for the high proportion of ADB financing\nis justified not only because of the country's weak fiscal position, but also owing to the country's\nneed for increased expenditure to finance rehabilitation works under exceptional circumstances;\nthe arrangement thereby avoid additional demands on the Government budget.\n\nF.\n\nExecuting Agencies\n\n1.\n\nPart A:  National, Regional, and Type-A Feeder Roads\n\n59.\nRHD  within  the  Roads  and  Railways  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Communication  will  be\nthe EA for Part A of the Project. RHD is responsible for administering the national, regional, and\ntype-A feeder road network. A Chief Engineer heads the organization, with 12 Additional Chief\nEngineers,  each  responsible  for  field  work  in  each  road  zone.  RHD  has  been  implementing\nroadworks for about 30 years, including ADB-financed projects since 1973.\n\n2.\n\nPart B: Rural Infrastructure\n\n60.\nLGED  of  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Rural  Development,  and  Cooperatives  will\nbe the EA for Part B1 of the Project. LGED, which is responsible for type-B feeder roads, rural\nroads,  and  growth  center  markets,  has  substantial  experience \nimplementing  rural\ninfrastructure  works,  including  several  ADB-assisted  projects.  It  is  currently  implementing\nseveral  externally  assisted  projects.  The  chief  executive  of  LGED  is  the  Chief  Engineer,\nassisted by Additional Chief Engineers.\n\nin \n\n                                                \n11 Asian Development Bank. 14 December 1998.

BR  has  substantial  experience\nimplementing major ADB-financed projects over several years.\n\n4.\n\nPart D: Water Management and Drainage Facilities\n\nBWDB within the Ministry of Water Resources will be the EA for Part D of the Project.\n63.\nBWDB is a semiautonomous body, responsible for providing surface water irrigation, drainage,\nflood control, erosion control, town protection, and river training works throughout Bangladesh.\nBWDB  has  been  the  EA  for  a  number  of  large-scale  water  resources  development  projects\nassisted by ADB. BWDB\u2019s performance in these projects has been generally satisfactory.\n\n \n\n5.\n\nPart E:  Socioeconomic Rehabilitation Fund\n\nPKSF will be the EA for Part E of the Project. PKSF was set up by the Government in\n64.\n1990 under the Companies Act of Bangladesh as an operationally autonomous nonprofit apex\norganization to provide loans to NGOs, which in turn would provide collateral-free credit to their\npoor  members.  PKSF  also  provides  advisory  services  and  training  to  NGOs  to  enhance  their\ninstitutional  capacity.  PKSF  has  received  grants  of  Tk1,100.0  and  $4.8  million  from  the\nGovernment,  and  Tk650.0  million  from  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development\n(USAID). It received loans of $100.0 million from the World Bank under the Poverty Alleviation\nMicrocredit  Project,  $18.0  million  from  ADB  under  the  Participatory  Livestock  Development\nProject,  and  Tk17.5  million  from  the  Ministry  of  Women  and  Children  Affairs.

Although damages\nfrom  the  2000  flood  are  limited  to  the  southwest  part  of  the  country,  the  inclusion  of  a  PSC\nwithin the Planning Commission is considered essential. This will ensure that implementation is\ncarried out as successfully as in the earlier project, particularly as the damages were severe in\nan  area  that  customarily  did  not  experience  floods,  and  because  the  proposed  Project  has\nunique dimensions with the SRF. Meetings to review project implementation with all EAs will be\nconducted  as  often  as  required,  but  at  least  once  every  three  months  for  the  duration  of  the\nProject.\n\nEach EA will be responsible in its respective sector for  (i) selecting all subprojects and\n67.\napproving  subprojects  up  to  $200,000;  (ii)  designing  civil  works;  (iii)  preparing  tender\ndocuments,  and  selecting  and  engaging  civil  works  contractors;  (iv)  supervising  contracts  and\nquality  control;  (v)  maintaining  accounts,  including  imprest  accounts;  (vi)  preparing  withdrawal\napplications;  (vii)  engaging  consultants;  and  (viii)  submitting  progress  reports  to  the  PSC  and\nADB.\n\n68.\nAs  the  Project  is  a  relatively  short-term  rehabilitation  activity,  no  new  or  elaborate\ninstitutional structures will be set up. As most works are to be undertaken in or adjacent to areas\ncovered  by  ongoing  ADB-assisted  projects,  separate  project  implementation  units  will  not  be\nneeded  within  most  of  the  EAs.  Where  appropriate,  an  existing  project  implementation  unit\nunder an ongoing ADB-assisted project will undertake implementation of its part of the Project,\nwith necessary additional capacity in staff, resources, and logistical support.\n\n2.\n\nSimplification of Government Procedures\n\nThe Government has issued a Circular (No. PD/NEC-ECNEC/Coordination-2/13/98/223,\n69.\n16 October 2000) specifying simplified approval procedures for the rehabilitation of losses and\ndamages  owing  to  flooding  in  the  southwest  region  of  Bangladesh.  This,  together  with  other\nsimplified  procedures  of  the  Government\u2019s  customary  processes  for  project  approval  and\nmodification,  and  procurement  of  goods  and  services  are  described  in  the  assurances  (para.\n89).\n\n3.\n\nProcurement\n\n70.\nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be  carried  out  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Equipment and materials will be procured\nunder international competitive bidding for items valued at more than $1,000,000 equivalent or\nby  international  shopping  when  the  value  is  $1,000,000 equivalent  or  less.  Since the  project\nsites are scattered, and involve relatively small civil works contracts, the civil works are unlikely\nto attract the interest of international contractors.  Domestic contractors have the capacity and\ncapability  to  undertake  such  contracts.  Therefore,  the  Government\u2019s  local  competitive  bidding\nprocedures,  which  are  acceptable  to  ADB,  will  be  followed  for  civil  works  contracts.  To\nencourage  the  participation  of  local  residents  (especially  women)  and  provide  them  with\nemployment opportunities, civil works for small earthworks, estimated to cost $2,500 equivalent\n\n\f19\n\nor  less  in  each  case,  may  be  awarded  to  labor-contracting  societies  in  accordance  with  the\nrespective EA\u2019s standard procurement procedures, including force account, acceptable to ADB\n\n71.\nConsidering  the  need  for  rapid  implementation  of  the  Project,  and  the  request  of  the\nGovernment,  a  two-envelope  tendering  procedure  will  be  used  for  civil  works,  with  a  bidding\nperiod  of  21  days.  The  tender  evaluation  and  contract  documents  for  civil  works  for  the  first\nsubproject selected by each EA and for civil works with a value exceeding $200,000 equivalent\nwill  be  reviewed  and  approved  by  ADB  before  the  award  of  the  contract.    The  award  of\nsubsequent civil works contracts with a value not exceeding $200,000 equivalent will be subject\nto ADB\u2019s retroactive approval, provided that, if the award or terms of any such contract are not\nsubsequently  approved  by  ADB,  the  Government  will  refund  to  ADB  any  payment  made  from\nthe  loan  to  finance  such  a  contract  and  then  provide  the  financing  from  its  own  or  other\nresources.  Equipment  or  materials  valued  at  less  than  $100,000  equivalent  each  may  be\nprocured on a direct purchase basis. At this stage the details of subprojects are not known and\ntherefore  bid  packages  cannot  be  itemized.  Given  the  small  size  and  scattered  nature  of  the\nworks, most items will likely be procured locally; Part C may require import of materials such as\nballast. Bid packages will be prepared for the subprojects in line with the practice being followed\nby EAs for ongoing ADB-assisted projects.\n\n4.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n72.\nThe  need  for  consulting  services  were  considered  in  view  of  (i)  the  need  for  careful\nverification  of  flood  damage  assessment  reports  in  each  sector,  (ii)  the  sector  loan  approach\nrequiring  preparation  and  evaluation  of  subprojects,  (iii)  need  for  intensive  supervision  for  the\nrapid completion of works, (iv) the increased work load on the existing supervisory staff of the\nEAs; and (v) need for consistency in design and construction standards. The only components\nfor which such services will be required are the roads and structures under the supervision of\nRHD  (Part  A)  and  LGED  (Part  B1),  and  water  management  under  BWBD  (Part  D)  For  other\ncomponents,  the  existing  resources  were  noted  to  be  adequate  for  the  tasks  envisaged.  The\nProject  will  require  a  total  of  105  person-months  of  international  (major  roads,  75;  rural\ninfrastructure,  30)  and  560  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  (major  roads,  487;\nrural infrastructure, 57; water management, 16).\n\n73.\nThe  consultants  will  help  the  EAs  (i)  identify  and  formulate  subprojects;  (ii)  prepare\nspecifications, design, and cost estimates; (iii) evaluate bids and award contracts, (iv) supervise\nconstruction,  and  quality  and  cost  control,  including  issue  of  certificates  for  payment;  and  (v)\nreport on progress.\n\n74.\nAll  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  the  EA  concerned  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. To save time, and in view of the fact that the EAs have\nalready engaged consultants under related ADB-assisted projects, it has been agreed with the\nGovernment that direct engagement of consultants will be undertaken, as provided under these\nguidelines. General conditions for direct selection under the Project require that the consultant\n(i)  be  currently  engaged  or  have  prior  experience  in  a  similar  ADB-financed  flood  damage\nrehabilitation project in the country, (ii) have needed expertise available at short notice, and (iii)\nhave  been  originally  selected  for  ongoing  projects  following  ADB's  Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic\nconsultants. When required, and at the request of the Government for ADB participation in the\nselection  process,  ADB  may  assist  the  Government  by  undertaking  the  shortlisting  of  the\nconsultants,  the  invitation  of  proposals,  and  the  evaluation  and  ranking  of  such  proposals.\n\n\f20\n\nSpecific selection criteria for sectors requiring consulting services are set out in Appendixes 2, 3\nand 4.\n\n5.\n\nAdvance Action\n\n75.\nGiven  the  urgency  of  the  Project  and  the  need  to  initiate  flood  damage  rehabilitation\nactivities so that key works are completed before the onset of the next flood season, ADB has\napproved advance action for the procurement of essential equipment, materials, and civil works,\nand  for  the  recruitment  of  consultants.  The  Government  was  advised  that  approval  of  such\nadvance action does not commit ADB to finance any part of the Project.\n\n6.\n\nRetroactive Financing\n\n76.\nThe Project provides for retroactive financing to fully utilize the current working season\nfrom November 2000 to June 2001, and for rehabilitation of critical facilities before the next rainy\nseason.  ADB  has  agreed  to  provide  retroactive  financing  of  eligible  expenditures  incurred  not\nearlier than 15 November 2000 (date of appraisal), provided that the expenditures are certified\nby  the  EAs  and  consultants,  and  that  such  certification  is  acceptable  to  ADB.  Retroactive\nfinancing will be approved under the following conditions: (i) the consultants are in the field and\nhave  prepared  the  subproject,  (ii)  contracts  over  $50,000  equivalent  were  approved  by  ADB,\nand  (iii)  works  were  tendered  according  to  agreed  upon  procedures  and  certified  by  the\nconsultants. Retroactive financing for consulting services has been requested and approved for\nany expenditures incurred not earlier than 15 November 2000. Such retroactive financing should\nnot  exceed  10  percent  of  the  loan  amount  allocated  to  each  project  component.  The\nGovernment has been advised that provision for retroactive financing does not commit ADB to\nfinance any part of the Project.\n\n7.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n77.\nAs the Project is for emergency assistance, project implementation will be completed in\n30  months;  this  will  allow  the  utilization  of  as  much  of  the  current  dry  season  as  possible\n(depending  on  the  rate  of  water  recession  from  the  affected  areas,  which  may  take  several\nmonths  in  the  most  heavily  flooded  areas)  and  two  dry  seasons  during  2001/02  and  2002/03.\nThe  agreed  upon  implementation  schedule  recognizes  the  critical  importance  of  restoring  as\nmuch key infrastructure as possible before the onset of the next rainy season in July 2001. The\nimplementation schedules for the Project are in Appendix 9.\n\n8.\n\nDisbursements\n\n78.\nTo  expedite  project  implementation,  an  imprest  account  will  be  established  in\nBangladesh  Bank  or  in  a  commercial  bank  for  Parts  B  \u2013  D  and  F  of  the  Project,  in  an  initial\namount  not  exceeding  six  months\u2019  estimated  expenditures.  Each  imprest  account  will  be\noperated  by  the  EA  concerned  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook  and\ndetailed arrangements agreed upon by the Government and the ADB. The ADB\u2019s statement of\nexpenditures  procedures  will  be  followed  for  reimbursement  of  expenditures  and  for  the\nliquidation  of  each  imprest  account  for  payments  not  exceeding  $100,000  equivalent  in  each\ncase.\n\nFor  Part  A,  reimbursement  procedures  will  be  followed  consistent  with  current  ADB\n79.\npractices for ADB-financed RHD-administered projects. For Part E, the Government will relend\n\n\f21\n\nto  PKSF  through  a  special  account  established  for  that  purpose  at  Bangladesh  Bank  or  in  a\ncommercial bank.\n\n9.\n\nReporting Requirements\n\n80.\nThe overall progress of project implementation will be monitored by the PSC. The EAs\nwill provide quarterly reports to the PSC and ADB indicating the progress made and problems\nencountered during the review period, the steps taken or proposed to remedy the problems, the\nproposed  program  of  activities,  and  the  expected  progress  during  the  following  quarter.  In\naddition  to  such  periodic  reviews,  ADB,  the  Government,  and  the  EAs  will  jointly  carry  out  a\ncomprehensive  review  at  the  end  of  the  first  year  of  project  implementation  to  address  any\nproblems and recommend remedial measures, if any.\n\n81. Within three months of physical completion of the Project, the Government will submit to\nADB  a  completion  report  that  provides  details  about  implementation,  cost,  benefits,  and  other\ninformation requested by ADB.\n\n10.\n\nRecords, Accounts, and Audit\n\nEach EA will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and\n82.\nservices  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  the  financing  resources  received,  the  expenditures\nincurred for the Project, and use of local funds. The accounts will be set up in accordance with\nsound accounting principles. Consolidated project accounts and related financial statements will\nbe  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  reports  and\nrelated financial statements will be submitted to the ADB not later than 12 months after the end\nof the fiscal year to which they relate\n\nH.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironment\n\nThe  Project  has  been  classified  as  environmental  category  B:  and  is  not  likely  to  have\n83.\nany  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts.  Civil  works  will  involve  rehabilitation  or\nreconstruction  of  flood-damaged  infrastructure.  Reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of  roads  and\nrailways  will  follow  existing  alignments  and  will  avoid  acquisition  of  land  or  resettlement.  All\nsubprojects will follow environmental safeguards and technical design specifications established\nfor  ongoing  ADB  projects,  which  have  already  been  subjected  to  ADB\u2019s  environmental\nassessment  procedures.  During  the  flood,  the  cross  drains  of  the  highways  were  found\ninadequate and in a number of sections that used to be natural channels for runoff, residents cut\nthe highway to allow free passage of floodwaters. Both RHD and LGED have realized the need\nto  increase  the  number  of  cross  drains  and  may  retain  the  breached  sections  as  permanent\nchannels  for  surface  runoff.  In  instances  were  the  highway  served  as  a  bund  preventing  the\ninland  flow  of  saline  water,  the  channels  can  be  provided  with  sluice  gates  to  control  the\ndirection of water flow. Although any application of the proposed Project for construction outside\nof the existing right of way of the damaged infrastructure is not foreseen, in instances that the\nflood  may  have  destroyed  the  integrity  of  the  existing  alignment  and  repair  along  existing\nalignment may pose risk to public safety, a new alignment may have to be considered. In that\nsituation,  the  EA  concerned  will  prepare  an  IEE  for  submission  to  ADB  for  approval  on  a  no-\nobjection  basis  prior  to  starting  construction.  The  Project  will  have  positive  environmental\nbenefits by limiting land erosion and failure of embankments along damaged infrastructure and\n\n\f22\n\nby  reducing  health  risks  by  rehabilitating  damaged  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities  and\ncleaning drainage systems.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n84.\nA  participatory  rapid  appraisal  was  conducted  to  assess  the  socioeconomic  impacts  of\nfloods. A social and poverty assessment is in Appendix 10. As a first step to designing the SRF,\nneed assessments were conducted in six affected districts to gather information about the need\nand  demand  of  flood  victims.  The  assessments  identified  the  magnitude  of  socioeconomic\nimpacts  people  face;  community  efforts  to  address  flood  victim  needs;  presence  and  role  of\nGovernment, NGOs, and community-based organizations; the constraints the community faces\nas a result of the disaster; and measures to mitigate those impacts and address the needs of\naffected persons.\n\n85.\nApproximately 500,000 houses were affected by floods. About 2 million-3 million people\nin the flooded areas were exposed to the elements. About 80-90 percent of mud houses in the\nareas  did  not  survive  the  floods  and  will  need  to  be  reconstructed.  Damage  to  crops,\ninfrastructure and homestead gardens was substantial.  The standing aman rice (harvest due in\nNovember)  and  summer  vegetable  and  fruit  crops  were  seriously  affected  by  floods.  A  large\nnumber of tubewells were inundated and will need to be rehabilitated. Persistent waterlogging\nproblems exist in many areas creating inhuman living conditions and spreading diseases. The\nclean  water  supply  situation  is  insufficient  and  latrines  are  scarce.  A  major  concern  is  the\nsituation  after  the  recession  of  floodwaters  when  the  risk  of  epidemics,  particularly  diarrheal\ndiseases and skin diseases will be high.  Thus, social issues, such as provision of a safety net\nfor affected people, particularly the poor and vulnerable groups, have emerged as major issues.\nBased  on  community  consultations,  the  major  demands  are:  (i)  drainage  rehabilitation;  (ii)\nhousing; (iii) working capital for on- and off-farm income-generating activities; (iv) employment;\nand  (v)  rehabilitation  of  rural  and  urban  basic  infrastructure  facilities  such  as  roads,  schools,\ntubewells, community health centers, and irrigation facilities.\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA.\n\nBenefits\n\n86.\nThe  benefits  of  the  emergency  loan  will  be  evident  in  the  speedy  rehabilitation  of\ninfrastructure  and  facilities  in  the  affected  areas.  By  rehabilitating  public  and  community\ninfrastructure, the Project will help restore social and economic activities disrupted by the flood.\nThe Project will reduce flooding and waterlogging of agricultural land, benefiting residents and\nfarmers in low-lying flood-prone areas.  Improved community water and sanitation facilities will\nhelp  reduce  risk  of  health-related  problems  and  improve  quality  of  life.  Aside  from  relieving\nhuman  and  societal  distress,  the  Project  will  have  economic  benefits,  which  are  likely  to  be\nsubstantial  although  not  fully  quantifiable.  The  civil  works  under  the  rural  road  rehabilitation\ncomponent  alone  are  expected  to  provide  about  262,500  person-days  employment  to  local\nskilled  and  unskilled  labor.  The  Project  will  help  bring  the  farmlands  in  six  districts  back  to\nproductivity,  and  allow  people  to  regain  employment  and  to  generate  incomes  of  their  own\ninstead  of  relying  on  Government  emergency  assistance.  Flood  disasters  affect  the  poor\ndisproportionately  in  terms  of  health,  housing,  employment,  livelihood,  and  food  security.\nRehabilitation of vital infrastructure will allow resumption of communication links and economic\nactivity  disrupted  by  flood  damage.  The  Project  will  involve  the  repair  and  rehabilitation  of\nexisting roads and bridges; irrigation canals; and urban and community infrastructure, such as\n\n\f23\n\nwater supply, drainage, sewage collection and disposal, and health and education facilities that\nwere damaged by the floods.\n\nB.\n\nRisks\n\n87.\nThe risk of procedural delays in obtaining various Government approvals that may slow\nimplementation has been offset by the Government\u2019s agreement to use simplified procedures.\nThe selection of EAs with considerable experience in implementing ADB-assisted projects and\nwith  familiarity  with  ADB  procedures,  implementation  by  established  project  implementation\nunits, and use of existing or directly selected consultants minimizes the likelihood of delay at the\nEA level. The availability of counterpart funding has not been a problem to date for ADB projects\nin Bangladesh. The risk of selecting unnecessary subprojects and of governance-related issues\nis addressed by the detailed selection criteria, strong consultant support, and the provisions of\nADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy,  which  have  been  specifically  brought  to  the  attention  of  the\nGovernment and all EAs.\n\nC.\n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n88.\nThe  project  area  is  characterized  by  high  levels  of  poverty.  The  national  statistics  in\nTable 5 tend to hide the incidence of poverty across upazilas and the impact of the 2000 floods\nin  an  area  previously  thought  to  have  a  moderate  level  of  food  security,  such  as  in  Satkhira.\nCurrently,  in  the  affected  areas,  poverty  is  as  high  as  80-90  percent  with  the  loss  of  physical\nassets  and  income-generating  opportunities  caused  by  the  flood.  The  prevalence  of  poverty\namong  landless  households  and  households  headed  by  women  is  particularly  high.  The\nestimated  numbers  within  vulnerable  groups  (such  as  children  under  5  years  age,  pregnant\nmothers,  and  elderly  people)  among  the  total  population  is  approximately  22  percent.  A  rapid\npoverty assessment was conducted in the project area.  Most of the people living in the project\narea  are  directly  or  indirectly  involved  in  agricultural  production.  About  27  percent  are  literate.\nThe  proportion  of  literacy  among  males  (67  percent)  is  more  than  double  the  literacy  among\nfemales (33 percent).  In the project area, female labor is engaged in the traditional household\nwork, agriculture, fishing, petty trade, and some low-level nonfarm jobs. The lower the status of\nthe  family  (landless  and  marginal),  the  higher  the  percentage  of  women  involved  in  activities\nother  than  household  work.  The  poverty  reduction  needs  addressed  through  the  Project  will\ninvolve  urgent  drainage  works  to  allow  faster  recession  of  water  and  enable  agricultural\nactivities  to  resume  microcredit  for  village  reconstruction  and  livelihood  restoration,  and\nrehabilitation of infrastructure to restore access.\n\n                                            Table 5:  Poverty Profile a\n\nArea\n\nIncidence of Poverty (Moderate and Extreme)\n(percent)\n45-50\n40-45\n40-45\n50+\n40-45\n35-40\n\nChuadanga\nJessore\nJhenaidah\nKushtia\nMeherpur\nSatkhira\na/    Preflood  situation.  Owing  to  massive  income  erosion  and  complete  loss  of  physical  assets,  the\nincidence of poverty has become much higher in the postflood situation, reaching almost 80 percent\nin parts of Satkhira.\n\nSource: Bangladesh Human Development Report, 1999.

The\nGovernment  will  make  available,  on  a  timely  basis,  the  necessary  funds  for\noperation and maintenance during and after project implementation.\n\nThe  EAs  will  actively  seek  community  involvement  and  participation  in  the\nselection, design, and implementation of all rehabilitation works carried out under\nthe Project.\n\nThe Government will allocate on a timely basis adequate counterpart funds from\nits  budget  for  each  fiscal  year  during  project  implementation  starting  from\nFY2000.\n\nRehabilitation  or  reconstruction  of  infrastructure  and  facilities  under  the  Project,\nthe  EAs  will  carry  out  the  Project  according  to  the  Government\u2019s  environmental\nstandards  and  regulations.  Each  EA  will  prepare  an  IEE  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s  environmental  requirements \nthe\nconstruction of infrastructure along new alignments or acquisition of land, and will\nsubmit  the  IEE  to  ADB  for  approval  on  a  no-objection  basis  prior  to  the  start  of\nconstruction.  Any  acquisition  of  land  or  displacement  of  persons  under  the\nProject will require submission, to ADB for approval, of a brief resettlement plan\nwith  compensation  and  rehabilitation  measures  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on\ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  the  laws,  practices,  and  procedures  of  the\nGovernment.\n\nfor  any  subproject \n\ninvolves \n\nthat \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  simplified  procedures  specified  in  Government  Circular  No.  PD/NEC-\nECNEC/  Coordination-2/13/98/223  dated  16  October  2000  will  apply  to  the\nProject.\n\n(viii)  The Government will ensure that the Planning Commission approves subprojects\nnot  already  included  in  the  Annual  Development  Plan  for  FY2000  under  the\nsimplified approval  procedures  specified  in  the  circular  (para.  89[vii]).  In  giving\nsuch  approval,  the  Planning  Commission  will  (i)  provide  the  necessary\ncounterpart funding, and (ii) issue a specific order to the EAs that the subprojects\nare  included  in  the  Annual  Development  Plan  for  FY2000,  and  authorize  the\nopening of any imprest accounts required for the Project.\n\n\f25\n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nAs in the 1998 flood rehabilitation project, the Government will delegate authority\nto the concerned line ministries to increase consulting service inputs by contract\nvariation of up to 33 percent of the existing contract to meet the estimated cost of\nservices needed for project rehabilitation works.\n\nThe  Government  will  increase,  for  the  purpose  of  the  Project,  the  delegated\nfinancial  authority  of \nthe  Additional  Chief\nthe  Chief  Engineer  and \nEngineer/Project  Director  of  RHD  to  approve  contracts  under  the  Project  in\namounts  necessary  to  facilitate  and  expedite  successful  implementation  of  the\nProject.\n\nB.\n\nCondition for Disbursement\n\n90.\nThe  conclusion  of  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement  between  the  Government  and  PKSF,\nsatisfactory to ADB, will be in place before withdrawals can be made for Part E of the Project to\nbe carried out by that agency.\n\nVIII.\n\nUSE OF SURPLUS LOAN FUNDS\n\n91.\nThe cost of rehabilitating of damage caused by the floods in southwest Bangladesh was\nestimated at over $200.0 million. While prepared to respond to the crisis, ADB is cognizant of\nthe  constraints  on  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  resources.  ADB\u2019s  policy12  on  disaster\nrehabilitation allows the use of surplus loan funds for rehabilitation works. A detailed review was\nundertaken  of  the  availability  of  surplus  loan  funds  that  could  be  used  to  meet  some  of  the\nfinancing requirements of the proposed Project. The Mission identified $13.0 million in surplus\nloan  funds  from  four  ongoing  projects,  primarily  from  currency  depreciation  and  lower  than\nestimated appraisal costs.\n\nThe  Government  has  requested  that  the  identified  surplus  loan  funds  be  used  for\n92.\nrehabilitation  works  to  be  carried  out  under  three  of  the  components  identified  for  the  Project\n(Parts  B,  C  and  E),  which  are  in  sectors  different  from  those  in  the  ongoing  projects.  The\nimplementation arrangements described in paras. 30 and 31 will also apply to the use of loan\nsavings.

Owing to the emergency nature and unprecedented severity of the 2000\nfloods,  and  constraints  on  ADF  resources,  it  is  proposed  to  re-employ  $13.0  million  in  loan\nsavings identified for flood damage rehabilitation in four ADF-financed projects for the purposes\nidentified  in  para.  92.  As  the  utilization  of  such  loan  savings  is  an  integral  part  of  the  Project,\nBoard  approval  is  being  sought  in  this  report.  The  four  ongoing  loans  are  proposed  to  be\nrestructured such that (i) the savings under three of the ongoing loans will be canceled from the\nrespective loan accounts and added to the loan account of one ongoing loan, and (ii) the project\nscope  of  that  ongoing  loan  will  be  expanded  to  undertake  the  rehabilitation  assistance.  As  no\nnew ADF resources will be used in the proposed restructuring, it is appropriate that the terms\nand  conditions  of  the  expanded  loan  would  remain  unchanged.  Subject  to  the  approval  of  the\nrecommendation in para. 94, the loan documents for those projects will be appropriately revised\nto reflect the necessary changes.\n\nVIII.

Damage to the road network was\nextensive.  Initially,  various  road  links  were  under  water  and  the  pavement  structures  became\nweaker as the duration of inundation increased. During this time, the roads were still traversed\nby  trucks  and  buses.  The  movement  of  vehicles  contributed  significantly  to  the  destruction  of\npavement  surfaces,  but  the  need  to  move  people  and  supplies  around  the  country  was\nnecessary.  The  next  phase  of  road  damage  occurred  when  the  floodwaters  started  to  recede\nand  as  the  water  rushed  to  find  convenient  outlets,  embankments  were  scoured,  abutments\nwashed  away,  and  many  bridges  and  culverts  were  damaged  or  disappeared.  With  road\ntransport to the southwest districts of the country completely cut off, relief efforts were met by\nother transport means or through longer land routes. In areas most affected by the floods, the\nsocial and economic cost was high, and complete recovery will require repair or rehabilitation of\nthe infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and culverts, damaged by the floods.\n\n2.\nAbout  600  kilometers  (km)  of  roads  were  submerged,  and  damage  was  sustained  to\n1,213 km of embankment, and 800 bridges and culverts. The total estimated cost of the damage\nat  that  time  was  Tk2,302  million  ($42.5  million).  Consultants  will  be  engaged  to  refine  these\nestimates using a detailed assessment and to supervise construction.\n\nB.\n\nScope\n\n3.\nUnder Part A of the Project, flood-damaged national, regional, and feeder type-A roads\nwill be rehabilitated, essentially to their condition before the flood within eight districts of Khulna\nzone under the Roads and Highways Department (RHD).\n\n4.\nThis  component  of  the  Project  will  cover  all  repair  and  reconstruction  necessary  to\nrestore the basic road transport network to full serviceability conditions prior to the 2000 flood.\nThe  project  consultants  will  conduct  a  detailed  damage  assessment  that  will  identify  priorities\nand  estimate  the  rehabilitation  cost.  Although  the  priorities  will  be  followed  to  prepare\nsubprojects,  exceptions  can  be  made  in  line  with  the  criteria  for  subprojects  shown  in  para.  5\nand in consultation with the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Repairs will vary from minor repair\nof an existing facility to the rehabilitation and reconstruction of culverts or bridges. Repair works\nwill be carried out to restore the facility to the preflood level or to a marginally higher standard as\nconsidered  cost  effective,  and  where  appropriate  will  include  flood  protection  measures  to\nminimize damage from future floods.\n\nC.\n\n5.\n\nSubproject Selection Criteria\n\nSubprojects will meet the following criteria:\n\n(i)\n\nThe subproject will comprise repair and rehabilitation, without any increase in the\nheight  of  the  road,  of  the  extensive  damage  of  the  RHD  road  network  in  the\nKhulna  zone  (seven  districts  for  national  and  regional  roads:  Chuadanga,\nKushtia,  Jessore,  Jhenaidah,  Magura,  Meherpur,  Satkhira;  three  districts  for\ntype-A feeder roads: Jessore, Jhenaidah, Satkhira; and one flood-damaged road\n\n\f31\n\nAppendix 2, page 2\n\nin  Khulna  (Tala-Paikgacha).  The  damage  must  have  been  caused  by  the  2000\nfloods and be identified by the consultant during detailed damage assessment.\n\nThe subproject does not comprise deferred maintenance.\n\nThe subproject must be the least cost solution.\n\nNo  other  aid  agency  is  providing  financing  for  the  roads,  bridges,  and  culverts\nproposed under the subproject.\n\nTo ensure contractor efficiency and ease of implementation, the subproject civil\nworks will be in the same general area.\n\n(vi)\n\nThe subproject will comprise similar types of civil works.\n\nThe  subproject  will  have  packages  generally  ranging  from  Tk10.0  million\n($184,270.0) to Tk80.0 million ($1.47 million).\n\nSubproject works will be based on technical and environmental design standards\npresently being followed under ongoing ADB-financed projects.\n\nSubprojects  will  be \nenvironmental standards and regulations.\n\nimplemented \n\nin  conformity  with \n\nthe  Government\u2019s\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\n(vii)\n\n(viii)\n\n(ix)\n\n(x)\n\nSubprojects will avoid resettlement of people or acquisition of land.\n\nD.\n\nCost Estimates\n\nBased on the preliminary assessment, the cost of restoration and rehabilitation works is\n6.\nabout  $40.2  million.  The  consulting  services  cost  of  $3.7  million  includes  remuneration  and\nother  expenses,  and  provides  for  office  equipment,  vehicles,  office  supplies,  and  vehicle\noperation. ADB will finance the entire foreign exchange cost, and part of the local currency cost\nfor a total of $31.8 million equivalent or 80 percent of the total project cost. ADB financing will\ncover  the  entire  cost,  both  foreign  exchange  and  local  currency,  for  consulting  services.  The\nGovernment  will  finance  the  remaining  local  currency  cost  of  $8.4  million  equivalent,  which\nincludes taxes and duties.

RHD is responsible for administration of the\nnational,  regional,  and  type-A  feeder  road  network.  RHD  has  a  Chief  Engineer  as  the  chief\nexecutive, and 12 Additional Chief Engineers (ACEs). Five ACEs assist the chief engineer with\nvarious functions at the headquarters in Dhaka and are in charge of ADB-funded projects, World\nBank projects, network management, technical services, and mechanical services. Seven other\nACEs, one for each of RHD's seven zones, are responsible for construction and maintenance\noperations  and  are  located  in  Barisal,  Chittagong,  Comilla,  Dhaka,  Khulna,  Rajshahi,  and\nRangpur. Each of the ACEs has an adequate number of staff. RHD has been carrying out road\nworks for about 30 years, including projects financed by ADB and the World Bank since 1973.\nRHD  has  acquired  considerable  experience  and  under  arrangements  agreed  upon  for  project\nimplementation will be able to satisfactorily execute this component.\n\n8.\nThe Chief Engineer, RHD, will have overall responsibility for implementation with day-to-\nday  implementation  coordinated  by  the  ACE  responsible  for  ADB-funded  projects.  The\nrespective zonal ACEs will act as project directors, the respective Superintending Engineers as\nadditional project directors, and the Executive Engineers as project managers and Subdivisional\nEngineers as deputy project managers. The ACE in charge of ADB-funded projects (ACE-ADB)1\nwill undertake coordination within RHD and the Government, and with other agencies, including\nthe Project Steering Committee (PSC) and ADB. The ACE-ADB will also be responsible for the\nsubmission  of  progress  reports  and  disbursement  requests  to  ADB.  The  zonal  ACE  will  make\npayments  to  the  contractors  and  the  project  coordinator  (ACE-ADB)  will  process  withdrawals\nunder reimbursement procedures in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.\n\nF.\n\nConsulting Services\n\nBoth  international  and  domestic  consultants  will  be  needed  for  the  detailed  damage\n9.\nassessment,  detailed  design,  and  project  implementation.  Considering  the  urgency  of  the\nProject  and  the  need  for  rapid  preparation  and  implementation,  the  Mission  agreed  to\nrecommend  advance  action  for  the  engagement  of  consultants  to  ADB  at  the  request  of  the\nGovernment.  Similarly,  the  Mission  recommended  and  the  Government  agreed  to  the  direct\nselection  of  consultants  for  the  component.  Conditions  for  direct  selection  are  that  the\nconsultants  (i)  be  currently  engaged  in  a  similar  ADB-financed  project  in  the  country,  (ii)  have\nneeded expertise available at short notice, and (iii) were originally selected for ongoing project\nfollowing the ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory\nto ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants.\n\n10.\nStaffing  inputs  will  be  about  75  person-months  of  international  consulting  and  487\nperson-months of domestic consulting. The exact number of person-months will be determined\non  the  basis  of  the  detailed  assessment  that  will  be  carried  out  in  the  first  phase  of  the\ncontractor\u2019s work, followed by the second phase of full deployment. Expertise required includes\nproject  and  contract  management,  materials  and  hydrological  engineering,  structural\nengineering, and construction operations. The services will be provided over about 30 months.\nThe consultant's contract will include facilities and services required, including accommodation,\nvehicles,  offices,  and  equipment.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  consulting  services  are\nincluded in paras. 15-19.\n\n                                                \n1\n\nProject Director (ACE), RHD, Jamuna Bridge Access Roads Project, also responsible for all ADB projects and for\nease of reference is referred to as the ACE-ADB.\n\n\f33\n\nAppendix 2, page 4\n\nG.\n\nProcurement\n\n11.\nThe  procurement  of  all  goods  and  services  under  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in\naccordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Given the urgency of the Project, at the\nrequest  of  the  Government,  the  Mission  agreed  to  ask  ADB  to  approve  advance  procurement\naction with the understanding that such action does not commit ADB to finance any part of the\nProject.  Contract  packages,  except  for  some  culvert  and  bridge  works,  will  generally  range  in\nvalue  from  Tk10.0  million  to  Tk80.0  million.  Considering  the  urgent  need  for  speedy  project\nimplementation,  ADB  has  agreed  to  a  request  by  the  Government  to  follow  a  two-envelope\ntendering  procedure  and  a  bidding  period  of  15  days.  Local  competitive  bidding  procedures\nacceptable  to  ADB  will  be  followed.  To  facilitate  award  of  civil  works  contracts,  contract\ndocuments,  and  tender  evaluation  for  the  first  subproject  will  be  reviewed  and  approved  by\nADB. Following this, signed contracts will be submitted to ADB for retroactive approval on the\ncondition that should any subproject or contract be found to not conform to the agreed criteria\nand procedures, the Government will be required to finance such contract(s) from its resources.\n\n12.\nConsidering  the  urgency  of  project  implementation,  the  Government  has  agreed  to\ndelegate  additional  financial  authority  to  the  Chief  Engineer,  Additional  Chief  Engineers,  and\nProject  Director  in  RHD  to  approve  contracts  under  the  Project  in  amounts  necessary  to\nfacilitate and expedite successful implementation of the Project. The Government will provide all\nfacilities  and  permits  for  importation  of  equipment,  construction  materials,  and  spare  parts  for\nequipment needed in connection with implementation of the Project.\n\nIn  the  interest  of  economy  and  efficiency,  the  subprojects  will  involve  similar  types  of\n13.\nwork  in  the  same  geographic  setting.  Bridge  rehabilitation  contracts  will  involve  repair  or\nreconstruction  of  large  culverts  and  small  bridges.  No  large  bridges  require  reconstruction.\nConsidering  the  small  size  of  the  contracts  and  their  scattered  locations,  international\ncontractors  are  not  likely  to  be  interested,  and  the  bidding  will  be  carried  out  following  LCB\nprocedures acceptable to ADB.\n\nH.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n14.\nProject  implementation  will  be  spread  over  about  30  months  to  take  advantage  of  two\ndry  seasons  and  allow  for  the  recession  of  waters  in  the  current  2000/01  dry  season.  Priority\nroad  civil  works  will  be  completed  during  the  current  construction  season  to  June  2001,\nremaining  roadworks  and  bridge/culvert  works  may  require  two  more  construction  seasons  to\nJune 2003.\n\nI.\n\nSummary Terms of Reference for Consultant Services\n\n1.\n\nScope of Services\n\n15.\nThe  component  will  restore  to  preflood  full  serviceability  levels  those  sections  of  the\nnational,  regional,  and  type-A  feeder  roads  in  the  Khulna  zone  damaged  by  the  2000  floods.\nThe  rehabilitation  works  will  be  undertaken  by  local  contractors  through  contracts  generally\nranging in value from Tk10.0 million to Tk80.0 million.\n\n\f34\n\nAppendix 2, page 5\n\na.\n\nFlood Damage Assessment and Subproject Preparation\n\n16.\n\nThe consultant tasks will include, but not be limited to, the following:\n\n(i) \n\nReview the findings of the preliminary flood damage assessment report prepared\nby RHD.\n\n(ii) \n\nConduct a detailed survey to assess damage from the 2000 flood.\n\n(iii) \n\nConfirm \nrecommendations.\n\nthe \n\nfindings  of \n\nthe  RHD  damage  assessment  and  provide\n\n(iv) \n\nPrepare subprojects that generally meet the criteria outlined in para. 5.\n\nb.\n\nDetailed Technical Design\n\nThe  consultants  will  carry  out  detailed  design  of  all  structures,  pavements,  and  the\n\n17.\nrelated components.\n\nc.\n\nSubproject designs\n\n18.\n\nThe consultants will have the following responsibilities:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nPrepare tender documents that allow for a two-envelope bidding procedure.

The  2000  floods  seriously  affected  six\ndistricts, most of which were covered under the recently completed Second Rural Infrastructure\nDevelopment  Projects  (SRIDP)1  financed  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  Damage  to\nrural roads, including type-B feeder roads and type-1 rural roads, was extensive. In the flooded\nareas, only road embankments were left above water and wave action caused erosion on the\nboth  sides  of  road  embankments.

In view of the small size of contracts that are scattered over the six\ndistricts,  all  the  civil  works  will  be  carried  out  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive  bidding\nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  maximum  contract  amount  should  not  exceed  $200,000\nunless  ADB  approves  it  as  an  exceptional  case;  to  avoid  an  excessive  number  of  small\ncontracts that make administration difficult, the minimum contract size should be Tk1.0 million. A\nroster  of  prequalified  contractors  will  be  prepared  at  the  start  of  the  Project,  and  updated\nannually,  using  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Small  earthwork  contracts  costing  less  than\n$2,500  equivalent  may  be  carried  out  by \nlabor-contracting  societies  organized  by\nnongovernment  organizations  or  LGED/DPHE  facilitators,  in  accordance  with  force  account\nprocedures.\n\nG.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nThe  project  implementation  period  will  be  30  months  with  two  construction  seasons\n11.\nbeyond  the  current  season,  which  may  be  largely  lost  owing  to  the  slow  recession  of\nfloodwaters. Implementation will commence in January 2001, and be completed by June 2003\nfor Part B1, and June 2002 for Part B2. Start-up activities will include:\n\n(i) \n\ndetailed assessment of damage to rural infrastructure;\n\n(ii) \n\nselection of subprojects according to established criteria;\n\n(iii) \n\npreparation of detailed designs, cost estimates, and tender documents;\n\n(iv) \n\ncontract awards; and\n\n(v) \n\nsupervision of the most urgent works to be implemented under retroactive\nfinancing arrangements starting on 15 November 2000.\n\nH.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n12.\nDue  to  the  emergency  nature  of  the  proposed  rehabilitation  works,  consulting  services\nwill  be  required  immediately  for  roads  and  structures,  to  conduct  detailed  assessments  of\ndamage to rural infrastructure. LGED will appoint consultants for its works on a direct selection\nbasis  for  the  construction  period.  Approximately  30  person-months  of  international  consulting\nand  60  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  will  be  required.  The  Mission\n\n\f40\n\nAppendix 3, page 5\n\nrecommended and the Government agreed to the direct selection of consultants for the public\nhealth  facilities  subcomponent.  Conditions  for  direct  selection  are  that  the  consultants  (i)  be\ncurrently  engaged  in  a  similar  ADB-financed  project  in  the  country,  (ii)  have  needed  expertise\navailable at short notice, and (iii) were originally selected for an ongoing project following ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the\nengagement of domestic consultants.\n\n13.\n\nThe consultants will undertake, but not be limited to, the following principal tasks:\n\n(i) \n\nassess the damage caused to LGED facilities by the 2000 floods;\n\n(ii) \n\nhelp LGED staff prepare detailed design, cost estimates, and tender documents;\n\n(iii) \n\nadvise LGED on the prequalification of contractors;\n\n(iv) \n\nadvise on appropriate contract packages for the works envisaged;\n\n(v) \n\nassist  in  site  supervision  of  construction  works  to  ensure  that  design  standards\nand technical specifications are achieved;\n\n(vi) \n\nensure that construction schedules are maintained;\n\n(vii)  measure  and  check  together  with  LGED  staff  all  works  presented  for  payment\n\nand approve the quality and quantity of the works;\n\n(viii) \n\ncheck and endorse progress bills from contractors;\n\n(ix)  monitor the overall progress of the component;\n\n(x) \n\nprepare  quarterly  progress  reports  for  LGED  for  submission  to  project  steering\ncommittee and ADB;\n\n(xi) \n\nprepare a project completion report at the end of the services.\n\n14.\n\nNo consulting services will be required for the DPHE component (Part B2).\n\n\f41\n\nRAILWAYS\n\nAppendix 4, page 1\n\nA.\n\nBackground\n\nThe sudden onrush of the October 2000 floodwaters caused serious damage to railway\n1.\nembankments,  tracks,  bridges,  ferry  landings,  and  buildings.  The  affected  sections  of\nBangladesh  Railway  (BR)  in  the  southwest  were  Jessore-Benapole,  Chuadanga-Darsana,\nDarsana-Darsana  border,  and  Rohanpur-Rohanpur  border.  The  floodwater  flow  affected  the\nferry connecting Trimohini-Balashi Ghat section in West Zone. Typical damage included railway\nembankment erosion, loss of ballast, displacement of track at certain locations, damage to brick\npiers and abutments of bridges, and damage to roads and level crossing gates. Initial damage\nassessed by BR shows that about 128 kilometers (km) of track and seven bridges experienced\nphysical damage. Five new bridges need to be constructed to allow for proper drainage of water\nalong the affected tracks.\n\nB.\n\nScope\n\n2.\nUnder  Part  C  of  the  Project,  flood-damaged  infrastructure  and  related  facilities\n(embankment, track, bridges, essential buildings and station roads, level crossings) in the flood\naffected areas will be rehabilitated to full operational levels.\n\n3.\nThe  initial  damage  survey  conducted  by  BR  identified  priorities  and  estimated  the\nrehabilitation  cost  for  damaged  track  sections  and  bridges,  types  of  damages,  and  estimated\ncost.  The  repairs  will  vary  from  minor  repair  of  an  existing  facility  to  major  repair  and\nrehabilitation  of  track  sections  or  bridges.  The  repair  works  will  be  carried  out  to  restore  the\nfacility to the preflood level or to a marginally higher standard as considered cost effective, and\nwhere appropriate will include flood protection measures to minimize damage from future floods.\nAs  far  as  possible,  the  works  will  not  include  hardwood  sleepers.  Ballast  and  sleeper  laying\nshould be done by force account.\n\nC.\n\nSubproject Selection Criteria\n\nApart from the general selection criteria applied to all components, the following specific\n\n4.\ncriteria will be applied to the restoration works subprojects:\n\n(i) \n\nthe damage is located on the railway network affected by the 2000 flood;\n\n(ii) \n\nthe subproject is a part of the detailed damage assessment survey of BR;\n\n(iii) \n\na  subproject  will  constitute  similar  types  of  works  in  well-defined  locations  such\nas track sections and bridge locations;\n\n(iv)  major  changes  or  modification  of  subprojects  will  be  submitted  to  the  Asian\n\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for prior approval;\n\n(v) \n\nall  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  works  will,  as  appropriate,  be  based  on\ntechnical  and  environmental  design  standards  presently  being  followed  under\nsimilar ADB-financed projects;\n\n(vi) \n\nall  subprojects  will  be  implemented  in  conformity  with  the  Government\u2019s\nenvironmental standards and regulations; and\n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 4, page 2\n\n(vii) \n\nsubprojects will avoid resettlement of affected people.\n\nD.\n\nCost Estimate and Financing Plan\n\nThe  total  cost  estimated  for  the  railways  rehabilitation  program  and  financing  plan  is\n\n5.\nprovided in the following table.\n\nTable A4: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n1.22\n0.25\n0.10\n1.57\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n0.35\n0.05\n0.03\n0.43\n\nTotal\nCost\n1.57\n0.30\n0.13\n2.00\n\nItem\nTracks\nBridges\nFacilities\n      Total\n\nE.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\nBR  under  the  Ministry  of  Communication  will  be  Executing  Agency  for  the  railway\n6.\ncomponent of the Project. Headed by a Director General, BR is responsible for operation of all\npassenger  and  freight  services  in  Bangladesh.  BR  has  substantial  experience  implementing\nADB-financed  projects  as  well  as  projects  of  similar  type,  i.e.,  rehabilitation  of  flood  damaged\nrailway sections in 1998 is the most recent example.\n\n7.\nBR  had  appointed  a  project  coordinator  under  the  Director  General  to  coordinate  and\nmonitor  rehabilitation  works  of  the  flood  damage  of  1998.  This  coordinator  will  have  overall\nresponsibility  for  coordinating  and  monitoring  of  Part  C  of  the  proposed  Project.  Day-to-day\nimplementation  will  be  managed  by  the  Chief  Engineer  of  West  Zone  as  the  project  director.\nThe  coordinator  will  be  responsible  for  submitting  the  progress  reports  and  disbursement\nrequests to ADB and the Project Steering Committee.\n\nF.\n\nProcurement\n\n8.\nThe  procurement  of  all  goods  and  services  under  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement, essentially as applied for ADB assistance\nfor  damage  rehabilitation  for  the1998  flood.  As  under  that  project,  given  the  urgency  of  the\nsituation,  and  at  the  request  of  the  Government,  BR  will  follow  local  competitive  bidding\nprocedures acceptable to ADB. BR will adopt a two-envelope tendering procedure and a bidding\nperiod  of  21  days  for  civil  works  contracts  valued  at  over  $200,000  using  its  current  roster  of\nprequalified contractors. For materials to be procured under international competitive bidding, a\nbidding  period  of  30  days  will  be  allowed.  To  facilitate  the  award  of  local  competitive  bidding\ncontracts,  the  first  subproject  contract  documents  and  tender  evaluation  will  be  reviewed  and\napproved by ADB. Thereafter, signed contracts will be submitted to ADB for retroactive approval\non  the  condition  that  any  subproject  or  contract  found  to  not  conform  with  the  established\ncriteria  and  procedures  will  be  financed  by  the  Government  from  its  own  resources.  For\ncontracts exceeding $200,000, contract documents and tender evaluation will be subject to ADB\nreview  and  approval.  The  Government  will  provide  all  facilities  and  permits  for  importation  of\nmaterials and equipment needed in connection with the implementation of the component.\n\n\f43\n\nAppendix 4, page 3\n\nContract packages for the component are expected to range from Tk0.7 million to Tk7.0\n9.\nmillion.  Considering  the  small  size  of  the  contracts,  they  are  not  likely  to  be  of  interest  to\ninternational contractors and will be carried out using local competitive bidding procedures.\n\nG.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nH.\n\nConsulting Services\n\nThe  railway  component  will  be  implemented  over  18  months.  The  rehabilitation  works,\n\n10.\nincluding procurement of ballast and sleepers, will be completed by 30 June 2002.\n\nAs the damage is not extensive and the works are limited in area and scope, consulting\n\n11.\nservices will not be required to carry out works for this component.\n\n\f44\n\nAppendix 5, page 1\n\nWATER MANAGEMENT AND DRAINAGE FACILITIES\n\n \nA.\n\nDamage and Impact\n\n1.\nBangladesh  experienced  an  abnormal  late  monsoon  flood  in  2000  in  the  southwest\nregion of the country. Rainfall records show that in the region received unusually high rainfall.\nThese  high  rainfalls  obviously  extended  into  West  Bengal  in  India  and  caused  massive\noverflows in West Bengal, which entered Bangladesh, adding to the severe flood damage from\nthe  local  high  rainfall  in  eight  districts  in  the  region.  The  flood  was  very  unusual  because  the\narea had not experienced a flood of such magnitude in past 60 years. Occasionally, the area is\nsubjected to drainage congestion during heavy rainfall particularly with the coastal polder areas.\nThe  main  cause  of  flooding  was  attributed  to  the  tremendous  flood  inflow  from  West  Bengal.\nExtensive  areas  of  Chuadanga,  Jessore,  Jhenaidah,  Kushtia,  Meherpur,  and  Satkhira  districts\nwere inundated. Nearly 2.5 million people were affected. Most of the homesteads in the flood-\naffected  areas  were  damaged.  Vegetable  gardens,  aman  crop,  and  fisheries  were  mostly\ndamaged in the flood-hit areas. Thousands of people were rendered homeless. Immense loss\noccurred  to  the  forestry  and  plantation  in  the  area.  The  flood  caused  huge  damage  to  road\nbridges  and  culverts,  at  many  locations  the  road  pavement  had  to  be  cut  open  to  allow  faster\ndrainage of floodwater. Immediate repair and rehabilitation works are necessary to restore flood\ncontrol,  improve  drainage  on  a  short-term  basis,  and  secure  the  functioning  of  drainage\ninfrastructure in the region.\n\n2.\nDamage in the water resources sector caused by the flood requires rehabilitation works\nestimated by the Government at about $46 million. An assessment of the total damage of flood\ncontrol and drainage facilities is presented in Table A5.1.\n\nTable A5.1: Total Damage of Flood Control and Drainage Facilities\n\nItem\n\nUnit\n\nFully Damaged\n\nPartially Damaged\n\nEmbankments\nSluices\nBridges and culverts\nProtective works\nClosure\nDrainage canals\n\nkm\nno.\nno.\nkm\nno.\nkm\n\n78\n25\n40\n3\n184\n2\n\n168\n208\n164\n1\n0\n863\n\nSource: Bangladesh Water Development Board.\n\nB.\n\nLarge- and Medium-Scale Works\n \n1.\n\nThe Selection Criteria Applied\n\n3.\nBangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) has identified six districts to be included\nunder  this  project  component  and  prepared  estimates  of  rehabilitation  costs  (Table  A5.2).  On\nthe basis of those estimates and field visits, the damaged structure have been appraised and a\nlist of rehabilitation works have been prepared to be included in the Project. The rehabilitation\nworks identified meet the following criteria:\n\n\f45\n\nAppendix 5, page 2\n\n(i) \n\nThe structure was damaged by the 2000 floods.\n\n(ii) \n\nAll works can be completed by June 2002.\n\n(iii) \n\nNo other aid agency will provide financing for rehabilitation.\n\n(iv) \n\nThe facilities are located in densely populated or intensively cultivated areas.\n\n(v) \n\nThe works will protect communities from floods and river erosion.\n\n(vi) \n\nProtection of embankments will reduce environmental damage.\n\n(vii) \n\nThe works will avoid resettlement of people.\n\nTable A5.2: Identified Rehabilitation Works\n($ million)\n\nDistricts\n\nEstimated Cost\n\n1.

These facilities include embankments, flood control and drainage structures, and\ndrainage  canals.  Restoration  works  will  include  filling  of  embankment  breaches,  resectioning,\nand protecting of damaged embankments. Damaged or destroyed water control structures and\ncanals will be also repaired or replaced.\n\nBWDB, the Executing Agency, will carry out surveys and detailed engineering design of\n5.\nthe  damaged  facilities.  BWDB  will  ensure  that  the  quality  of  work  is  of  an  appropriately  high\nstandard, so rehabilitation works under the Project will be restored to their original specifications\nto ensure integrity with the remaining parts of the facilities.\n\n3.\n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan\n\n6.\nThe  total  cost  is  estimated  at  $16.5  million,  including  about  $2.4  million  in  foreign\nexchange cost and $14.1 million equivalent in local currency cost.

BWDB  has  been  the  executing  agency  for  a  number  of  large-scale\nwater  resource  development  projects.  The  performance  of  BWDB  in  these  projects  has  been\ngenerally  satisfactory.  BWDB  is  considered  to  be  capable  of  implementing  the  project\ncomponent satisfactorily with the assistance of a team of consultants.\n\n9.\nFor  the  reconstruction  of  component  facilities,  the  Director,  Project  Management  Unit,\nunder the overall guidance of the additional director general (operation and maintenance), will\nbe responsible for coordinating and monitoring project activities. At the field level, responsibility\nfor  implementation  will  rest  with  executive  engineers,  under  the  supervision  of  their\nSuperintending engineer and zonal Chief Engineer. The Executive Engineers will be responsible\nfor  preparing  tender  documents,  selecting  contractors,  awarding  contracts,  supervising\nconstruction,  providing  quality  control,  and  establishing  accounting  and  detailed  financial\ncontrol. Design assistance will be provided by Chief Engineer, Design.\n\nBWDB  will  prepare  an  initial  environment  examination  (IEE),  in  accordance  with  the\n10.\nADB\u2019s environmental requirements, in any case that involves construction of new infrastructure\nand  resettlement  of  affected  people,  and  will  submit  the  IEE  to  ADB  for  approval.  For\nrehabilitation  works  involving  resettlement,  the  BWDB  will  prepare  and  submit  a  brief\n\n\f47\n\nAppendix 5, page 4\n\nresettlement  plan  to  ADB  conforming  to  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement,  for  ADB\napproval before implementation of subprojects.\n\nBWDB  will  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  to  ADB  and  within  three  months  of  the\n11.\ncompletion  of  the  Project,  a  project  completion  report.  BWDB  will  maintain  separate  accounts\nand  records  of  expenditures  for  the  Project.  The  accounts  will  be  audited  annually  by  the\nGovernment\u2019s auditor general, and certified copies of the audited financial statements and the\nrelated auditor general\u2019s report will be furnished to ADB not later than 12 months after the end\nof each related fiscal year.\n\n5.\n\nProcurement\n\n12.\nAs the project sites are scattered in remote areas, and have relatively small civil works\ncontracts,  the  civil  works  are  unlikely  to  attract  the  interest  of  international  contractors.  It  has\nbeen  confirmed  that  domestic  contractors  have  the  capacity  and  capability  to  undertake  such\ncontracts, and the procedures to be followed for domestic procurement are acceptable to ADB.\nAs  such,  BWDB\u2019s  local  competitive  bidding  procedures,  which  are  acceptable  to  ADB,  will  be\nfollowed  for  civil  works  contracts.  To  encourage  the  participation  of  local  residents  (especially\nwomen)  and  provide  them  with  employment  opportunities,  civil  works  for  small  earthworks,\nestimated to cost $2,500 or less in each case, may be awarded to labor contracting societies in\naccordance  with  BWDB\u2019s  standard  procurement  procedures, \nforce  account,\nacceptable to ADB.\n\nincluding \n\n6.\n\nRetroactive Financing\n\n13.\nRetroactive financing is essential to fully utilize the working season from November 2000\nto  June  2001,  and  to  completely  restore  critical  facilities  before  the  next  rainy  season.  The\nProject  therefore  provides  for  retroactive  financing  of  eligible  expenditures  incurred  after  the\ndate of appraisal (15 November 2000) provided that it is certified by consultants acceptable to\nADB. Retroactive financing will be approved under the following conditions: (i) the consultants\nare  in  the  field;  (ii)  the  contract  has  been  approved  by  ADB;  and  (iii)  works  are  tendered\naccording to agreed procedures acceptable to ADB and certified by the consultants. Retroactive\nfinancing  for  consultants\u2019  services  has  also  been  requested  and  agreed  for  any  expenditures\nincurred after the date of appraisal.  Retroactive financing will not exceed 10 percent of the loan\namount allocated to each project component.  The Government has been advised that provision\nfor retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance any part of the Project.\n\n7.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n14.\nPart D of the Project is expected to be implemented over two years. Most civil works are\nexpected to start in February 2001 and be completed by June 2001, but the works that require\nsurvey and design, should be completed by June 2002.\n\n8.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n15.\nGiven the urgency of the Project, ADB will approve advance action for the recruitment of\nconsultants.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  such  advance  action  does  not  commit\nADB to finance any part of the Project. BWDB will require two domestic consultants to design\nand supervise the reconstruction of flood-damaged facilities, a team leader and civil engineer,\nand a domestic construction supervision expert for 16 person-months each to help with project\n\n\f48\n\nAppendix 5, page 5\n\nimplementation  over  a  19-month  period.  In  view  of  the  emergency  nature  of  the  Project,  the\nconsultants  will  be  recruited  immediately  through  direct  appointment  by  the  project  director  to\nallow  the  maximum  use  of  the  present  construction  season.  Conditions  for  direct  selection\ninclude (i) the consultants have experience in a similar project in the southwest region; (ii) have\nneeded  expertise  available  at  short  notice,  and  (iii)  have  been  selected  for  an  ADB-financed\nproject following ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n\nThe  consulting  firm  engaged  under  the  Project  will  provide  project  management  and\n16.\nengineering  services  to  assist  BWDB.    The  services  will  include  (i)  project  coordination  and\nadministration,  (ii)  assistance  to  BWDB  for  project  coordination  and  implementation,  (iii)  help\nwith  engineering  design  and  construction  supervision,  (iv)  midterm  project  review,  and  (v)\nprogress monitoring and reporting to ADB and the project steering committee. These services\nrelate to the rehabilitation of the flood control and drainage facilities damaged during the 2000\nfloods.\n\n9.\n\nTerms of Reference for Team Leader and Civil Engineer\n\n17.\n\nThe consultant, as the team leader, will help BWDB:\n\n(i) \n\ncoordinate project activities of BWDB staff concerned;\n\n(ii) \n\nprepare and update yearly work plans, budgets, and financing plans;\n\n(iii) \n\nverify necessary documentation for loan withdrawals;\n\n(iv) \n\ncompile and certify reimbursement applications;\n\n(v) \n\nmaintain contract files;\n\n(vi) \n\nassess the flood damage;\n\n(vii) \n\nidentify measures to be taken;\n\n(viii) \n\nreview  BWDB\u2019s design drawings and tender documents;\n\n(ix) \n\nensure  that  proposed  rehabilitation  works  are  environmentally  sound,  and\nincorporate  mitigation  measures  as  appropriate \nto  meet  Government\nenvironmental standards and regulations;\n\n(x) \n\nsupervise construction of the civil works under the Project; and\n\n(xi) \n\ncheck  and  certify  progress  payments  bills  and  all  final  bills,  prior  to  payment\nbeing made to contractors.\n\n18.\nIf  the  consultant  observes  that,  for  particular  part  of  the  works,  the  requirement  of  the\ncontract specifications have not been met, the consultant will report the deficiency to BWDB and\nsuggest  corrective  measures.  If  the  deficiency  is  not  corrected,  the  payment  for  the\ncorresponding part of the works will not be certified for reimbursement.\n\n\f49\n\nAppendix 5, page 6\n\n19.\nThe consultant will be responsible for monitoring design and construction work to ensure\nthat  beneficiaries  will  participate  in  the  planning  and  construction  of  them  to  the  maximum\nextent. The consultant will assist BWDB in preparing resettlement and compensation plans, in\nconformity with the ADB policy for any rehabilitation works involving involuntary resettlement or\nacquisition of land.\n\n10.\n\nTerms of References for the Construction Supervision Expert\n\nThe  consultant  will  assist  the  team  leader  with  administration  and  supervision  of  the\n\n20.\nconstruction works, including\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\ncarry out checks, preconstruction surveys, and other preconstruction benchmark\ndata;\n\nreview  the  designs  prepared  by  the  design  cell  to  ensure  that  structures  are\ndesigned  to  appropriate  standards,  including  flood  return  periods  for  flood\nprotection structures, and other physical infrastructure;\n\nreview and ensure that cost estimates of subprojects are based on market prices\nfor basic inputs and an appropriate application of the standard rates as approved\nby BWDB;\n\npropose  solutions  for  engineering  and  other  problems  encountered  during\nimplementation;\n\nassist BWDB with the packaging of all civil works and the engagement of all civil\nworks contractors;\n\ncarry  out  a  prereview  of  procurement  actions  for  contractors  to  be  submitted  to\nADB for prior review if necessary;\n\n(vii) \n\nreview force account rates;\n\n(viii) \n\ncarry out post-award review of bidding procedures and bid evaluation, and certify\nthat agreed procedures have been observed; and\n\n(ix) \n\nprovide supervision of the works during all critical construction stages, including\nafter  completion,  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  contract  conditions  and\nspecifications.\n\nC.\n\nSmall-Scale Works\n\nFlood  damage  of  small-scale  water  control  structures  was  relatively  minor  because  of\n21.\ntheir  small  scale  and  the  small  number  of  completed  schemes.  The  main  causes  of  damage\nwere heavy inflow to canal embankments and scouring around water control structures.\n\n\f50\n\nAppendix 5, page 7\n\nThe  ADB-financed  Small-Scale  Water  Resources  Development  Sector  Project1  covers\n22.\nthe  entire  western  half  of  the  country.  Flood  damage  on  small-scale  works  in  the  region  is\nestimated  at  $0.37  million.  The  rehabilitation  of  flood  damaged  facilities  will  be  implemented\nunder the sector project as an extension of ongoing project implementation.\n\nTable A5.5: Flood Damage to Ongoing Projects\n($ million)\n\nItem\n\nDimension\n\nEmbankments\nCanals\nStructures\n       Total\n\n22 km\n35 km\n18  no.\n\nCost\n\n0.12\n0.09\n0.16\n0.37\n\n                                                \n1  Loan 1381-BAN(SF): Small-scale Water Resources Development Sector Project, for $32 million, approved on 26\n\nSeptember 1995.\n\n\f51\n\nAppendix 6, page 1\n\nPALLI KARMA-SAHAYAK FOUNDATION\n\nA.\n\nBackground1\n\n1.\nThe  Palli  Karma-Sahayak  Foundation  (PKSF)  of  Poverty  Foundation  will  be  the  apex\nmicrocredit  organization  managing  the  socioeconomic  rehabilitation  fund  (SRF)  under  the\nProject.  PKSF  was  established  in  May  1990  under  the  Companies  Act  of  1913  as  an\nautonomous,  nonprofit  organization  charged  with  \u201chelping  the  poor,  the  landless,  and  the\nassetless  in  order  to  enable  them  to  gain  access  to  resources  for  their  productive  self-\nemployment,  to  encourage  them  to  undertake  activities  of  icome  generation  and  poverty\nalleviation for enhancing their quality of life.\u201d  The formation of PKSF was prompted by the fact\nthat  a  number  of  small  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  were  engaged  in  promoting\nincome-generating  activities  within  their  local  areas  in  Bangladesh.  Although  many  of  these\nNGOs were competently managed, they generally suffered from a perennial shortage of funds.\nPKSF was thus formed to finance such NGOs. In support of this objective, PKSF received an\ninitial grant of Tk32.0 million from the Government, and it has subsequently received additional\ngrants from the Government for a total of Tk750.0 million.  At the end of 1999, the total equity of\nPKSF was Tk5,920.0 million.  While PKSF functions as an autonomous publicly funded body, it\nfalls under the overall supervision of the Ministry of Finance.  PKSF is the apex organization for\nthe  1996  Poverty  Alleviation  Microfinance  Project  of  the  World  Bank  and  the  International\nDevelopment  Association,  as  well  as  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Participatory\nLivestock Development Project in 1997.\n\nThe principal objectives of PKSF are to help the poor by providing them with resources\n2.\nfor  the  creation  of  productive  self-employment  opportunities.  This  is  achieved  by  (i)  providing\ncredit to various organizations (government or nongovernment) that are engaged in promoting\nsuch  income  generation  activities  for  the  poor;  (ii)  providing  institutional  strength  of  these\norganizations;  (iii)  encouraging  new  ideas,  generating  new  technologies  for  poverty  reduction,\nand  initiating  and  undertaking  research  activities;  and  (iv)  developing  proper  management\ninformation systems, so that poverty reduction  activities can be monitored and evaluated in a\nregular manner.\n\nB.\n\nOrganization\n\n3.\nThe  General  Body  of  PKSF  provides  overall  policy  guidance,  approves  the  annual\nbudget, and reviews the annual report and audited accounts of PKSF. The General Body may\nhave up to 25 members (with up to 15 members being Government employees), all of whom are\nappointed, and may be replaced at any time, by the Government. The nongovernment members\nare  based  on  their  record  of  service  with  respect  to  poverty  reduction  and  income  generation\nactivities  for  the  poor.  In  addition,  the  seven-member  Governing  Board  comprises  the\nchairperson,  managing  director,  and  five  other  members.  The  chairperson  and  two  other\nmembers are appointed by the Government, but in late 1995, PKSF\u2019s Memorandum of Articles\nwas  changed  to  give  its  Governing  Board  full  authority.  The  other  three  board  members  are\nselected  by  the  private  sector  members  of  the  General  Body,  and  represent  knowledgeable\nprofessionals  with  an  interest  in  the  field  of  NGO  activities  and  poverty  reduction.    The  seven\nboard members hold all the shares of PKSF, equitably.\n\n52\n\n4.\nTwo general managers, one for operations and the other for administration, support the\nmanaging  director.  The  operations  wing  of  PKSF  is  responsible  for  the  initial  screening  of\n\n                                                \n1 Drawn from PKSF. 1999. Annual Report, 1998-1999. Dhaka.\n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 6, page 2\n\norganizations  applying  for  registration  as  partner  organizations  (POs);  the  initial  screening  of\nloan  applications  for  authorizing  disbursements;  and  for  tracking  scheduled  compared  with\nactual repayments.  The key functionaries in operations are the loan officers who maintain close\nlinks  with  their  POs  through  regular  field  visits.  The  administration  wing  includes  separate\nsectors  for  finance,  administration,  and  internal  audit.  The  managing  director  and  general\nmanagers control credit operations by forming a loan committee, which includes the loan officer\nin  addition  to  these  three  senior  managers,  and  which  reviews  PO  registration  and  loan\napplications forwarded by the loan officer.\n\nC.\n\nActivities\n\nPKSF\u2019s  activities  largely  focus  on  ensuring  a  rigorous  screening  of  applications  for\n5.\nvarious  NGOs  for  registration  as  POs,  and  the  subsequent  processing  of  loan  approvals,\ndisbursements,  and  repayments.  This  work  involves  regular  field  visits  by  loan  officers.  In\naddition, PKSF has provided technical assistance for the institutional strengthening of the POs,\nprimarily focusing on ensuring a uniform system of accounting and controls for the POs\u2019 credit\nactivities.  Management  information  systems  (MIS)  need  to  be  strengthened  to  ensure\ntransparency;  this  is  being  achieved  through  technical  assistance  provided  under  the  Poverty\nAlleviation Microfinance Project.\n\nD.\n\nProcedures\n\n6.\nPKSF\u2019s credit operations center around the loan officers in the operation wing, each of\nwhom  has  clear  responsibility  for  individual  POs.  Organizations  seeking  to  register  as  POs\ncomplete  a  comprehensive  application  form,  providing  information  about  their  own  financial\nstatus, as well as the status of the borrower groups they service. This is supplemented by field\nvisits  by  a  loan  officer  to  verify  the  information  provided.  Applications  approved  by  the  loan\nofficer  are  then  reviewed  by  the  Loan  Committee  and  presented  to  the  Governing  Body  for\napproval.  The  loan  officer,  who  then  forwards  them  to  the  Loan  Committee  for  final  approval,\nsimilarly  clears  loan  applications.  Supervision  is  performed  by  reviewing  cash  flow  statements\n(supported  by  bank  statements)  and  summaries  of  credit  transactions  between  PO  and\nborrower groups submitted each month by the POs to PKSF. In addition, the loan officers make\nfield visits once every two or three months.\n\nE.\n\nPriorities\n\n7.\nPKSF\u2019s  overall  operating  policies  and  procedures  are  satisfactory.  Its  credit  approval\npolicies are sound and conservative, credit supervision is intensive, accounting systems and the\nMIS are satisfactory, and its own external audit is quite comprehensive.  PKSF\u2019s main focus for\nits  borrowers  is  on  collecting  loans,  which  have  averaged  99.8  percent  since  inception;\nmaintaining  satisfactory  bookkeeping  of  disbursements  and  repayments;  routing  of  PKSF-\nfinanced  transactions  through  banks;  and  ensuring  that  loans  are  made  to  the  target  group.\nMicrocredit financing institutions (MFIs) are required to conduct all transactions of PKSF-funded\nprograms  through  banks,  and  submit  monthly  bank  statements  and  MIS  reports.  Loans  are\napproved on the basis of the annual needs of MFIs, but disbursed, generally, at intervals of 1-2\nmonths, after field supervision and bank statements confirm that the last transaction has been\nsatisfactorily  used.  To  strengthen  its  monitoring,  and  internal  accountability  capabilities,  PKSF\nhas recently established an internal audit cell.\n\n53\n\n8.\nPKSF  encourages  its  POs  to  at  least  (i)  fully  cover  the  recurring  administrative  and\nfunding costs from operating income; (ii) impose a minimum lending rate of 16 percent to ensure\n\n\f53\n\nAppendix 6, page 3\n\nthat they do not lend below commercial bank rates; and (iii) promote cost recovery operations.\nPKSF  does  not  impose  any  other  specific  performance  or  sustainability  targets.  PKSF\u2019s  main\nobjective  is  to  ensure  accountability  for  its  funds.  As  long  as  the  POs  meet  its  stringent\nrequirements for repayment, accounting, and targeting, PKSF neither monitors nor imposes its\nview  on  POs  product  mix,  cross-subsidization  of  nonlending  services  from  lending  profits  or\nlending services from grants and other income, loan pricing and loan-loss reserve policies, level\nof mandatory savings, separation of accounts for different services, etc. PKSF encourages, but\ndoes not mandate, POs that have outside sources of income to set aside a portion of interest\nincome as reserves.  Considering the pervasive loan default situation in Bangladesh, the high\npriority attached by PKSF to loan collection is well placed and should remain as its predominant\nconcern.  In  addition,  but  without  sacrificing  this  emphasis,  PKSF  needs  to  pay  attention  to\nissues of sustainability and its own role as an apex institution.\n\nF.\n\nFunding of PKSF\n\nPKSF\u2019s mandate authorizes PKSF management to mobilize funds in the form of grants,\n9.\nloans, and contributions from a wide variety of sources, which include the Government, private\nindividuals and organizations, foreign governments, international funding and lending agencies,\nand capital markets. PKSF received in total Tk1,100.0 million as a grant from the Government\nand  Tk650.0  million  from  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID),  and\n$100 million as loan from International Development Association (IDA) through the Government\nfor the  Poverty Alleviation Microcredit Project. PKSF also received a grant of $4.8 million from\nthe Government for institutional development under the microcredit project.  PKSF also received\na loan of Tk17.5 million from the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs under IFADEP-I project\nand $18.0 million from ADB for the Participatory Livestock Development Project.\n\nG.\n\nOperations:  Performance and Projections\n\n1.\n\nLending\n\n10.\nPKSF  has  now  enlisted  over  182  POs  as  borrowers.  PKSF\u2019s  gross  disbursements  to\nPOs rose from Tk3.0 million in financial year 1991 (second year of operations for PKSF) to Tk1,\n987.0 million in 1999, the average annual growth rate was as high as 125.2 percent.2 As of June\n1999, the total cumulative amount of loan disbursed by PKSF was Tk5,665.0 million. PKSF has\nbeen able to maintain a loan recovery rate above 98 percent from its POs. Up to June 1999, the\ntotal  cumulative  amount  of  loan  recovered  (principal  amount)  was  Tk1,526.0  million  and\nTk4,138.0 million remained outstanding as loans to the POs.\n\n2.\n\nFinancial Outlook\n\n11.\nProjections indicate that after 2000, along with the evolution of the MFI sector and with\nmore  MFIs  achieving  financial  viability,  as  well  as  PKSF  having  built  up  a  large  pool  of\nconcessional  funds,  reducing  concessionality  in  interest  rates  (both  on  the  borrowing  and\nlending  side)  should  be  possible  over  time.  Thus,  PKSF  could  start  to  pay  higher  rates  on\nincremental borrowings, and by 2015 it could pay an interest rate of 8 percent (7 percent higher\nthan at present and 2 percent higher than the average cost of funds of the banking system) on\nall  its  borrowed  funds,  and  earn  a  satisfactory  1.9  percent  return  on  assets,  while  raising  the\naverage  lending  rate  only  4  percent  points,  from  4.5  percent  in  2000  to  8.5  percent  in  2015.\nBecause of the higher cost of funding, the average interest expense (a percentage of borrowed\n\n                                                \n2 All years in paras. 9-10 are financial years.\n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 6, page 4\n\nfunds)  increased  from  1.0  percent  in  2000  to  6.2  percent  in  2015.  The  favorable  debt-equity\nratio  of  7.7:1  in  2015  enables  PKSF  to  operate  on  a  thin  interest  margin  and  yet  earn  a\nsatisfactory return on assets.  By 2015, PKSF would be earning a return on equity of about 15\npercent, which should be sufficient to attract private capital.\n\nH.\n\nThe Socioeconomic Rehabilitation Fund\n\nPart  E  of  the  Southwest  Flood  Damage  Rehabilitation  Project  involves  setting  up  the\n12.\nSRF in PKSF.  The objective of the SRF is to mitigate the social and economic impact of floods\nand  to  improve  the  living  conditions  of  the  poor  through  speedy  provision  of  loans  for\nrehabilitation of village reconstruction and settlement development, and on- and off-farm income\ngenerating activities. In addition, the SRF will strengthen decentralized delivery mechanisms by\nsupporting  local  (government  and  nongovernment)  organizations  that  are  responsive  to  local\nneeds, and build local institutional capacity.\n\nThe scope of activities funded by the SRF will be based on beneficiaries\u2019 demand and\n13.\nthe implementation capacity of the POs. Community participation, demand orientation, and local\norganizational capacity will be used as guiding principles in SRF activities. These principles will\nbe  reflected  in  the  design,  implementation,  and  evaluation  of  the  SRF.  NGO  involvement,\nparticularly local NGOs, will enable the SRF to reach poor and isolated communities, enhance\ncommunity participation, and improve project design and implementation.\n\n14.\nPKSF  will  develop  a  detailed  design  for  the  SRF,  including  lending  terms,  recovery\nmechanisms,  and  monitoring  and  reporting  arrangements.  The  following  parameters  will  be\nused to develop the SRF.\n\n15.\nAll  POs  must  direct  SRF  resources  to  borrower  groups  of  the  poor.  First-time\nbeneficiaries  of  the  POs  will  be  persons  who  fulfill  the  following  eligibility  criteria,  as  usually\napplied by PKSF, or other criteria as agreed to by PKSF and POs from time to time: (i) are a\npermanent  resident  in  the  project  area;  (ii)  have  total  assets  not  exceeding  the  value  of  0.4\nhectares of arable land in their locality; and (iii) are members of a savings group organized and\nmonitored by the PO directly.  Preference will be given to poor households whose houses were\ndestroyed  by  the  recent  floods.  Loans  by  POs  to  the  final  borrowers  will  be  provided  on\ngenerous terms (at no more than 3-5 percent) and for substantially longer periods than normal,\nreflecting the disaster nature of the facility. PKSF will provide loans to the POs at 1.5 percent,\nrepayable in liberal installments.\n\n16.\nIn  view  of  the  high  cost  of  both  supervised  microcredit  and  social  intermediation\nactivities, the Government has agreed that part of the concessionality of ADB\u2019s loan will be used\nto  provide  an  adequate  interest  spread  to  cover  all  costs  and  provision  for  bad  and  doubtful\ndebts. The Government will relend on an interest-free basis, $10.0 million equivalent under the\nProject  to  PKSF  for  the  SRF.  The  Government  loan  to  PKSF  will  be  amortized  over  32  years\nwith a grace period of 8 years to allow (i) the fund to be replenished, (ii) a revolving fund to be\nestablished with repayments, and (iii) the fund to be applied to any future disaster.\n\n17.\n PKSF will designate, within one month after the ADB loan becomes effective, a full-time\nproject  coordinator  with  qualifications  and  experience  acceptable  to  ADB  to  oversee  the\nimplementation of the SRF component.  PKSF will also provide an adequate number of suitable\nqualified  professional  and  support  staff  to  assist  the  project  coordinator  to  carry  out  the\nimplementation of the SRF component and monitor its subloans to POs.\n\n\f55\n\nAGRICULTURE\n\nAppendix 7\n\nA.\n\nDamage and Impact\n\n1.\nThe  unprecedented  flood,  which  started  in  the  third  week  of  September,  engulfed  six\nsouthwest  districts  of  Bangladesh:  Chuadanga,  Jessore,  Jhenaidaha,  Kushtia,  Meherpur  and\nSatkhira resulting a complete loss of about 150,000 hectares of standing crops. The main crops\n\u2014 aman and horticulture \u2014 were under water and the farmers did not have means to protect\nthe seeds of rabi crops, mainly boro paddy, vegetable, and spices. The total production loss is\nabout 420,000 metric tons of rice and vegetables worth Tk4,600 million ($83.64 million). About\n130,000  hectares  of  aman  paddy  and  24,000  hectares  of  summer  vegetables  have  been\ncompletely  damaged.  Other  flood-prone  horticultural  crops,  particularly  banana,  papaya,\njackfruit, and tuberose were also affected to a great extent. Five seed multiplication farms were\ndamaged.  The  flood  has  affected  not  only  the  landowners  who  have  lost  their  crops,  but  also\nmany  of  the  functionally  landless,  who  are  dependent  on  agricultural  employment  during  the\nharvesting  season.  The  seed  multiplication  farms  need  to  be  rehabilitated  urgently  to  supply\nseeds to the affected farms for coming cropping seasons.\n\nB.\n\nScope\n\n2.\nPart  F  of  the  Project  will  comprise  rehabilitation  of  flood-damaged  seed,  multiplication\nfarms, and associated facilities in the seven affected districts (Chuadanga, Jessore, Jhenaidah,\nKushtia, Magura, Meherpur and Satkhira).\n\nC.\n\n3.\n\nD.\n\nCost Estimate and Financing Plan\n\nThe total cost is estimated at  $0.6 million equivalent in local currency.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n4.\nThe Executing Agency for the component will be the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). The\nImplementing  Agency  will  be  the  Bangladesh  Agricultural  Development  Corporation  (BADC)\nwithin  MOA.  BADC  has  implemented  many  post-flood  agricultural  rehabilitation  projects\nsupported  by  the  Government  and  development  partners.  The  performance  of  BADC  in  those\nprojects  has  been  found  satisfactory.  It  is  considered    BADC  is  considered  to  be  capable  of\nimplementing the component successfully with support from MOA.\n\nE.\n\nRetroactive Financing\n\nF.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nTo utilize the ensuing rabi and boro cropping season from November 2000 to April 2001,\n\n5.\nretroactive financing will be essential.\n\nIt  is  expected  that  Part  F  of  the  Project  will  be  implemented  over  six  months  from\n\n6.\nNovember 2000 to April 2001.\n\n\f56\n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES\n($ million)\n\nAppendix 8\n\nSubproject\n\nForeign\nCurrency\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\n\n1.

The project area is mostly\npoor  and  poverty  levels  are  very  high.  The  Project  will  enable  the  restoration  of  social  and\neconomic  activities  of  these  six  districts,  and  create  opportunities  for  employment  or  income-\ngeneration, particularly for poor men and women through labor-intensive activities.\n\nB.\n\nThe Project Area\n\n2.\nThe  project  area  is  located  in  the  southwestern  region  of  Bangladesh,  and  comprises\nseven  districts:  Chuadanga,  Jessore,  Jhenidah,  Kusthia,  Magura,  Meherpur,  and  Satkhira.  It\ncovers  about  11,103  square  kilometers  (km2)  of  mixed  use  land,  and  has  a  population  of\napproximately 8 million. The total affected area is 3,239 km2 with population of 2 million-3 million\npeople. The affected areas have not experienced flooding for the last 60 years. Poor rural and\nurban infrastructures and poor living conditions (i.e., mud houses) characterize the area.\n\n3.\nDue  to  the  heavy  rainfall  in  West  Bengal  State,  water  flows  from  the  upper  catchment\nareas of India, and heavy rainfall in southwestern Bangladesh, the project area was flooded to\nan average depth of 1.8 to 3.0 meters within a few days. About 80-90 percent of mud houses in\nthe area were damaged. In Satkhira, at least 500,000 people were rendered homeless as the\nunprecedented  floods  destroyed  some  68,000  houses  completely  and  some  47,000  houses\npartially. Over 600,000 people in this district alone took shelter in schools, colleges, madrasahs,\nand other public places.\n\n4.\nMost  of  social  infrastructure  facilities  such  as  schools  and  health  centers  have  not\nsurvived the floods and will need to be reconstructed. A large number of tube wells have been\ninundated  and  most  will  likely  need  to  be  resunk.  Damage  to  crops  and  infrastructure  was\nsubstantial. The standing aman rice (harvest due in November) and summer vegetable and fruit\ncrops  were  seriously  affected  by  the  flood.  The  damage  to  rural  roads  and  embankments  is\nsubstantial. While the damage to national and regional highways is less severe, resources will\nhave to be spent on reconstructing culverts and bridges, particularly at places where the roads\nhad to be cut or were breached by floodwaters.\n\nC.\n\nMethodology\n\n5.\nDuring appraisal, an in-depth needs assessment was fielded involving consultations with\nkey  stakeholders  in  six  districts  that  included  union  parishad  members,  schoolteachers,\nnongovernment  agencies  (NGO)  representatives,  farmers,  shop  owners,  landowners,  and\npeople who were most adversely affected by the floods in the project area. Consultations and a\nseries  of  meetings  were  conducted  with  key  stakeholders  including  international  and  national\nNGOs, government officials, and assistance agencies working in the field.\n\nTogether  with  stakeholders,  the  needs  assessment  team  identified  the  needs  and\n6.\ndemands of communities; magnitude of socioeconomic impacts; types of programs in place to\nserve  poor  and  marginalized  groups,  including  the  role  of  Government;  role  of  local\norganizations  in  supporting  poor  flood  victims;  and  delivery  mechanisms  for  a  social\n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\nrehabilitation  fund  (SRF).    NGOs,  local  community  leaders,  and  local  government  staff  also\nprovided inputs to the proposed design of the SRF to be funded under the Project, and criteria\nfor selection of intermediary agencies.\n\nD.\n\nPoverty Profile\n\n1.\n\nNational Levels\n\n7.\nNearly  80  percent  of  Bangladesh\u2019s  population  of  130  million  people  live  in  rural  areas.\nThe  most  recent  countrywide  evidence  on  the  poverty  status1  shows  that  36  percent  of\nBangladesh\u2019s  population  are  very  poor  and  53  percent  poor.2  The  incidence  of  poverty  has\ndeclined since 1991-1992 as measured by both the lower and upper poverty lines. However, the\ndrop in poverty was larger in urban than rural areas.  For the decade from 1985 through 1995,\nrural  poverty  has  remained  much  higher  than  urban  poverty  as  measured  with  both  the  lower\nand upper lines. In Bangladesh, poverty can be regarded as both a state of deprivation as well\nas  a  state  of  vulnerability.  The  rapid  population  growth  rate,  at  about  2  percent  annually,  is\ncontributing  to  increasing  landlessness;  in  1995/96,  nearly  half  of  all  rural  households  were\nreported as being landless or near-landless, owning less than 0.2 hectare; 17 percent of these\nhouseholds were reported as being completely landless.\n\n8.\nWhile poverty is best measured by comparing per capita consumption to a poverty line,\nother dimensions of well-being are not captured by such measures.  Women in Bangladesh lack\naccess  to  health  and  education,  and  have  a  lower  life  expectancy  than  men  at  birth.  Rural\nhouseholds  headed  by  women  had  a  higher  probability  of  being  among  the  very  poor  than\nhouseholds  headed  by  men  (45  percent  compared  with  39  percent).  The  headcount  ratios  for\npoor  households  were  virtually  identical  for  households  headed  by  females  and  males.\nBecause households headed by females had smaller families and per capita consumption data\nwas used as a welfare indicator, poverty among smaller families was underestimated compared\nwith  larger  families,  and  in  households  headed  by  women3.  If  the  distribution  of  consumption\nwithin households favors men, poverty among women is likely to be higher still.\n\nIn  Bangladesh,  the  burden  of  poverty  falls  disproportionately  on  women.  The  most\n9.\ndisadvantaged  women  are  those  heading  or  managing  households,  about  15  percent  of  all\nhouseholds.  On average, households headed by females earn only 55 percent of the earnings\nof the national average households.  About 96 percent of these households are living below the\npoverty  line,  while  33  percent  are  living  below  the  lower  poverty  line  and  thus  experience\nchronic of food shortages.\n\nPoor  Bangladeshis  have  little  access  to  resources.  In  rural  areas,  poor  people,\n10.\nparticularly  women,  generally  access  financial  resources  through  nonbank  sources,  such  as\nmicrocredit programs of NGOs and other noninstitutional lending sources. The Grameen Bank\nand some NGO credit programs, such as Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF), Bangladesh\nRural Advancement Committee (BRAC), and Proshika provide loans to poor people and target\n\n                                                \n1  Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. 1998.

Dhaka.\n2    Bangladesh  Bureau  of  Statistics  uses  a  cost  of  basic  needs  indicator,  which  expressed  in  taka  per  person  per\nmonth, sets three poverty levels (food, lower, and upper).

Loans  taken  by  poor  people  often  are  to  support  economic  activities,  but\noften are also taken for consumption and household purposes in times of distress.\n\n2.\n\nPoverty in Project Area\n\n11.\nPrior to the floods, the level of poverty in the southwest region was lower than in other\nparts  of  Bangladesh.  With  massive  income  erosion  and  complete  loss  of  physical  assets,  the\naffected areas now face abject poverty. The prevalence of poverty among landless households\nand  households  headed  by  women  is  particularly  high.  The  estimated  number  of  vulnerable\ngroups (such as children under 5 years age, pregnant mothers, and elderly people) among the\ntotal population is approximately 22 percent.\n\n12.\nA rapid poverty assessment was conducted in the project area during appraisal. Most of\nthe people of the project area are involved in agricultural production either directly or indirectly.\nAbout 27  percent of  the  population  in the region are literate. The proportion of literacy among\nmales (67 percent) is more than double the literacy among females (33 percent). In the project\narea, women\u2019s labor is engaged in traditional household works: agriculture, fishing, petty trade,\nand some low-level nonfarm jobs. The lower the status of the families (landless and marginal),\nthe higher the percentage of women involved in activities other than household works.\n\n13.\nPersistent  waterlogging  problems  exist  in  many  areas,  creating  inhuman  living\nconditions, spread of diseases, and lack of employment opportunities. The clean water supply\nsituation  is  insufficient  and  latrines  are  scarce.  A  major  concern  is  the  situation  after  the\nrecession  of  floodwaters  when  the  risk  of  epidemics,  particularly  diarrhea  as  well  as  skin\ndiseases, will be high.  Thus, social issues, such as provision of a safety net for affected people,\nparticularly the poor and vulnerable groups, have emerged as major issues.\n\nD.\n\nProject Beneficiaries\n\n14.\nThrough  the  rehabilitation  of  public  and  community  infrastructure,  the  Project  will  help\nrestore  social  and  economic  activities  disrupted  by  the  flood.  The  Project  will  reduce  flooding\nand waterlogging of agricultural land, benefiting residents and farmers in low-lying flood-prone\nareas.  Improved  water  and  sanitation  facilities  will  help  reduce  risk  of  health-related  problems\nand  improved  quality  of  life.  Aside  from  relieving  human  and  societal  distress,  the  Project  will\nhave economic benefits that are likely to be substantial although perhaps not quantifiable. The\ncivil works under the Project are expected to provide employment of about 262,500 person-days\nto local skilled and unskilled labor. The Project will help bring the farmlands and in six districts\nback  to  productivity  and  allow  people  to  regain  employment  and  to  generate  incomes  of  their\nown instead of relying on government emergency assistance. Table A10 provides an indicative\nnumber of beneficiaries of the Project.\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 10, page 4\n\nTable A10: Estimated Number of Project Beneficiaries\n\nProject Component\n\nBeneficiaries\n\nSocioeconomic\nRehabilitation Fund\n\nRural Infrastructure:\nCommunity Sanitation\n\nWater Resources\n\nApproximately 100,000\nhouseholds will benefit from\nmicrocredit for rehabilitation of\nhousing and working capital for\non- and off-farm, income-\ngenerating activities.\n\nReduction of the incidence of\nenvironment-related diseases and\nconsequent reduction of income\nloss and medical expenses for\n600,000 families who live in\ntemporary shelters.\n\nReduction in income and asset\nlosses due to agriculture, income\ngeneration, business disruption\nfrom flooding.  Estimated 2.9\nmillion people affected.\n\nPercentage of Women\nBeneficiaries\n\nEqual numbers of men and\nwomen will benefit.\n\nA greater proportion of\nbeneficiaries will be women, as\nthey are generally responsible\nfor the care of sick.\n\nA great proportion of\nbeneficiaries will be women, as\nwomen tend to do more of the\npost-flood cleaning.\n\nRural Infrastructure: Civil\nWorks\n\n262,500 person-days of work will\nbe created to rehabilitate\napproximately 650 km of rural and\nfeeder roads.\n\nApproximately 30 percent of\nunskilled laborers for rural\ninfrastructure rehabilitation will\nbe women.\n\n15.\nThe  project  component  with  the  greatest  potential  to  impact  on  existing  poverty\nconditions  within  the  project  area  is  the  Socioeconomic  Rehabilitation  Fund  (SRF)  to  be\nimplemented  in  six  districts.  Based  on  the  poverty  assessment,  approximately  45  percent  of\npeople who live in these districts are living below the official poverty level.\n\nE.\n\nNeeds and Demands for Infrastructure Development\n\nApproximately  80-90  percent  of  houses  in  these  areas  are  made  from  mud,  and  the\n16.\npopulation  in  the  flooded  areas  appears  to  be  most  exposed  to  the  elements.  Most  of  those\nbuildings  did  not  survive  the  floods  and  will  need  to  be  reconstructed.  Damage  to  crops  and\ninfrastructure was substantial. The standing aman rice (harvest due in November) and summer\nvegetable and fruit crops were seriously affected by floods. A large number of tubewells have\nbeen inundated and will need to be rehabilitated. Based on community consultations, the major\ndemand  were  (i)  drainage  rehabilitation;  (ii)  housing;  (iii)  working  capital  for  on-  and  off-farm,\nincome-generating  activities;  (iv)  employment;  (v)  rehabilitation  of  rural  and  urban  basic\ninfrastructure  facilities,  such  as  roads,  schools,  tube  wells,  community  health  centers,  and\nirrigation facilities.\n\nF.\n\nRole of NGOs\n\n17.\nBangladesh is internationally known for its innovative NGOs, which have grown rapidly.\nIn the project area, NGOs play a major role in providing relief programs for flood victims such as\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 10, page 5\n\ntemporary shelters, food distribution, health, water supply, and sanitation facilities. Microfinance\nprograms  such  as  those  provided  by  Bangladesh  Rural  Advancement  Committee  (BRAC),\nAssociation for Social Advancement (ASA), Proshika, Palli Karma Sahayak Foundation (PKSF),\nand Grameen Bank are among the best known. In addition to microfinance, NGOs provide skill\ntraining, education, health, family planning, and water supply and sanitation facilities. NGOs are\nalso  active  in  managing  common  property  resources,  extending  nontraditional  agriculture,  and\ninitiating  income-generating  activities.  Microfinance  programs  are  effective  in  fighting  poverty.\nThe superior performance of microfinance NGO services offers possibilities of partnership with\nthe Government to provide loans for housing, and working capital for on- and off-farm, income-\ngenerating activities for flood victims, particularly the poor and vulnerable groups.\n\nG.\n\nProject Impact on Women\n\n18.\nThe  various  project  components  will  benefit  women  in  a  number  of  ways.  Bangladeshi\nwomen  have  high  labor  force  participation  rates,  many  earn  their  incomes  from  agricultural\nwage  labor,  trading  activities  in  the  home  or  the  markets.  The  Project  will  benefit  women  by\nproviding  employment  opportunities  for  rehabilitation  of  public  and  community  infrastructure\nfacilities.  The  provision  of  community  water  and  sanitation  facilities  will  benefit  women  and\nchildren substantially in terms of health and quality of life.\n\n19.\nGender considerations have been built into the design of the Project to ensure equitable\naccess  to  employment  creation  and  poverty  reduction  opportunities,  as  well  as  to  ensure  that\nthe  perspective  and  needs  of  the  entire  community  are  reflected  in  the  planning  and\nimplementation  process,  particularly  in  the  SRF.  Furthermore,  an  important  contribution  of  the\nSRF component will be empowerment of women in the project area. The SRF will incorporate\nparticipatory  approaches  involving  civil  society  at  various  stages  of  the  development  process,\nfrom planning to implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. The SRF requires that women\nparticipate in a meaningful way both at decision-making levels and as beneficiaries of the labor\nrequired by the Project. As participants, they will represent their respective communities in the\ndecision-making  process.  This  makes  them  accountable  to  their  respective  communities,  and\nthey  will  therefore  become  public  figures.  This  experience  will  help  empower  women,  and\npromote their needs in the village.\n\nH.\n\nImpact on Poor Households\n\nConstruction activities, which mostly require unskilled labor, will generate direct income-\n20.\nearning  opportunities  particularly  for  the  poor.  Over  three  years,  the  Project  will  provide\napproximately 652,500 person-days of employment, which consist of direct labor in civil works\nand production of materials utilized in constructing the works. Poverty targeting will be achieved\nat  the  village  level  through  community  selection,  e.g.,  communities  will  be  able  to  identify  the\nneedy (the very poor) more efficiently than through any objective screening mechanisms.  The\nparticipatory project monitoring and evaluation system to be developed and implemented under\nthe  SRF  component  will  require  each  district  and  village  to  make  plans,  and  monitor  the\nimplementation of that plan, for promoting access of the poor to project benefits.\n\nI.\n\nCommunity Consultation and Participatory Approaches\n\n21.\nThe communities that will be directly and indirectly benefited by the project components\nwill  play  a  significant  part  in  the  planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  the  Project.  The\nbottom-up  planning  process  will  be  a  major  feature  of  the  SRF.  During  the  social  and  poverty\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 10, page 6\n\nassessment,  discussions  were  held  with  a  number  of  relevant  stakeholders  such  as  union\nparishad,  local  NGOs,  communities,  and  particularly  poor  men  and  women.  The  discussions\nhelped  to  highlight  issues  faced  by  the  communities.    For  instance,  to  reduce  the  health  risk,\ncommunities  must  have  clean  water  and  sanitation  facilities.  Participatory  approaches  will  be\nemployed in design, implementation, and monitoring of the Project.\n\nJ.\n\nPerformance Project Monitoring System (PPMS)\n\n22.\nThe specific objectives of PPMS are to identify key criteria and indicators to be used for\nmacro-level  monitoring  of  project  inputs,  outputs,  and  impacts.  The  PPMS  will  enable  the\nExecuting  Agency  and  ADB  to  determine  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  project\nimplementation,  to  identify  constraints,  and  to  compare  performance  and  impact  across  six\ndistricts.  The  PPMS  will  be  established  to  assess  the  Project\u2019s  progress  and  implementation\nand to measure the impact and outcomes of the Project.
