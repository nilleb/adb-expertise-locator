Conversion of $205 million into a tranche to finance Tranche 3 of the Power System \nExpansion and Efficiency Improvement Investment Program1 in Bangladesh is proposed for \nBoard consideration.2 \nII.  BACKGROUND \n2.  The Government of Bangladesh is implementing the Sixth Five Year Plan (2011\u20132015) \nand Power System Master Plan 2010, targeting universal access to grid electricity by 2021 with \na total generation capacity of 16,000 megawatts (MW) by 2016; 20,000 MW by 2020; and \n40,000 MW by 2030. The plans identify $12 billion of investments for 2011\u20132015 and a further \n$58  billion  of  investments  for  2016\u20132030.  In  2012,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \napproved a multitranche financing facility (MFF) amounting to $700 million for the Bangladesh \nPower System Expansion and Efficiency Improvement Investment Program; this was to assist \nthe  government  in  implementing  the  plans  to  provide  sustainable,  affordable,  and  reliable \nenergy  for  all  in  Bangladesh.  The  MFF  supports  power  sector  investments  in  generation, \ntransmission, and distribution systems in Bangladesh for capacity expansion and efficiency \nimprovement. Management approved the first tranche of the MFF on 12 December 2012 and \nthe second tranche on 9 December 2013.  \n3.  Through a periodic financing request dated 5 August 2015, the government asked for a \nloan of $205 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance three outputs under \nTranche 3:  \n(i)  Output 1: replacement of an aging steam and gas turbine power plant of 220 MW \ncapacity with a more efficient 400 MW gas-fired combined-cycle power plant (CCPP) at \nAshuganj Power Station complex.  \n(ii) Output 2: upgrade and construction of approximately 72 kilometers (km) of 132 kilovolt \n(kV) transmission line and associated substations in Chittagong Division.  \n(iii) Output 3: replacement of meters with approximately 700,000 prepayment meters in \nDhaka Division.  \n4.  The impact of Tranche 3 will be better access to reliable electricity supply in Bangladesh. \nThe outcome will be increased efficiency and capacity of the power system in Bangladesh.  \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE ON ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS \n5.  The proposed tranche project is classified as category A for environmental impact under \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Tranche 3 has undergone the applicable business \nprocesses for subsequent tranches of MFFs. The project team has requested Management \napproval of the conversion of a portion of the MFF into financing for Tranche 3. This conversion \nis proposed for Board consideration because of the project\u2019s category A classification for the \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Multitranche Financing Facility \nto Bangladesh for the Power System Expansion and Efficiency Improvement Program. Manila.   \n2  This tranche report is being presented for Board consideration as required under the revised Operations Manual on \nMFF, which states that projects with an environmental impact category A classification in a subsequent tranche \nshould be submitted to the Board for its decision as to whether to authorize the President to convert the tranche. \nThis tranche report also includes a recommendation to allow procurement outside of ADB member economies. ", "2 \n \nenvironment. \n6.  Tranche 3 is classified as category A for output 1, category B for output 2, and category \nC for output 3. The overall classification is A. The project\u2019s environmental safeguard documents \nwere prepared in compliance with the Safeguard Policy Statement, the MFF\u2019s environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework,  and  Bangladesh  environmental  regulations.  The \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) and the environmental management plan (EMP) for \noutput 1 were disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 3 June 2015. A revised EIA incorporating ADB\u2019s \ncomments  was  submitted  to  ADB  and  the  Department  of  Environment  of  Bangladesh  on \n5 August 2015. The updated EIA was disclosed on ADB website on 28 October 2015. The \nupdated EIA is available from the list of linked documents in the Appendix. A draft IEE for \noutput 2 was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 14 September 2015, and an updated IEE on 5 \nOctober 2015. \n7.  Public  consultations  were  held  with  local  communities,  including  fisherfolk.  They \nwelcomed  the  project  since  it  would  improve  the  reliability  of  power  supply.  Community \nconcerns were noted in the EIA and IEE, and mitigation measures were incorporated into the \nEMP. A climate change risk assessment was conducted and led to a medium climate risk rating. \nThe main risks to the project are potentially higher flood levels, temperature rises, and tropical \ncyclones of greater wind speeds. The risks will be factored into the project design. \n8.  Given the potential environmental impacts\u2014e.g., discharge of cooling water into Meghna \nRiver  and  emissions  of  nitrogen  oxides  (NOx)  during  operation\u2014output  1  is  classified  as \nenvironmental category A. However, it is not expected to cause significant harm as Output 1 \nfocuses on replacing an old gas-fired power plant with a more energy-efficient combined-cycle \ngas power plant in an existing power complex. This new plant will reduce pollutant intensity and \noffset  pollution  emissions  growth  without  consuming  more  natural  gas.  The  environmental \nimpacts identified in the EIA are mostly predictable and reversible. Sensitive ecosystems will not \nbe affected. Impacts such as NOx emissions during operation will be mitigated by incorporating \nthe best available technology into the power plant design, which includes the use of low-NOx \nburners  and  a  NOx-reduction  system.    Furthermore,  the  electricity  generated  through  the \nincremental 180 MW combined cycle gas fired generation capacity will offset CO   emissions of \n2\naround 800,000 ton per year equivalent of a new coal-fired generation capacity.   \n9.  Potential  environmental  impacts  of  output  2  are  mostly  temporary,  predictable,  and \nreversible. No impacts will arise on forests, sanctuaries, or protected areas, and historical and \ncultural monuments. Environmental impacts mainly occur during construction stage, including \nincreased  local  air  pollution  due  to  dust  and  vehicular  emissions,  construction  waste  at \nsubstation sites, increase in noise level at the construction sites, deterioration of surface water \nquality due to sanitary wastes from worker-based camps, etc. These temporary impacts can be \nminimized or mitigated by best-practice control measures as set forth in the Environmental \nManagement Plan. Output 3 will have minimal environmental impacts. The replaced meters that \nare functional will be reused in other locations. Any final disposal of used meters would occur at \napproved waste management facilities. \n10.  The EMP includes measures to minimize anticipated impacts during construction and \noperation. The EIA includes a robust monitoring plan that will support smooth implementation of \nthe EMP. The executing agency has experience in implementing ADB-financed projects and \nhas  established  a  project  management  unit  that  includes  dedicated  staff  responsible  for \nmonitoring environmental issues and implementing the EMP. The engineering, procurement, \nand construction contractor will comply with the EMP during pre-construction and construction ", "3 \n \nunder close monitoring by the project supervision consultant and the executing agency. All \ncontractors will submit monthly environmental monitoring reports to the  project supervision \nconsultant,  who  will  prepare  and  submit  quarterly  environmental  monitoring  reports  to  the \nexecuting agency. Based on the contractors\u2019 reports and its own due diligence, the executing \nagency will then submit semiannual environmental monitoring reports to ADB.  \n11.  A grievance redress committee will be set up by the executing agency as soon as the \nproject starts. The committee will convene twice a month and keep record of the grievances, \nand provide the solution(s) within 30 days from the date of the complaint. All complaint-related \ndocumentation, such as minutes of the meeting and decisions, will be summarized and become \npart of the semiannual monitoring report submitted to ADB. If the grievance is not dealt with, the \ncomplainant can seek legal redress in the appropriate courts. \nIV.  JOINT COFINANCING WITH ISLAMIC DEVELOPMENT BANK \n \n12.  The Islamic Development Bank (IDB) will provide $220 million to cofinance the turnkey \npackage for the Ashuganj 400 MW combined-cycle power plant (East). ADB will finance the gas \nturbine and generator, and IDB will finance the balance of the plant, design services, and \ninstallation works. Since it is not possible to separately procure individual components of this \npackage, procurement will be conducted as one package to be financed jointly by ADB and IDB. \nTo enable such joint procurement, it is proposed to expand country eligibility in this particular \ncase by allowing firms, subcontractors, and sourcing of materials from any country eligible \nunder ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and IDB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement of Goods and \nWorks under IDB Financing (2009). Such an expansion of country and source eligibility is \nrequired to implement the jointly financed package and would require a procurement eligibility \nwaiver from the Board. In the absence of such a waiver, a jointly financed procurement package \nwill not be possible.  \n13.  Tranche 3 has undergone the applicable business process procedures for subsequent \ntranches of MFFs. Upon Board approval, the project team will request Management approval of \nthe conversion of a portion of the MFF into financing for tranche 3. \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n14.  The President recommends that the Board  \n(i)  authorize the conversion of $205,000,000 into a tranche to finance Tranche 3 of \nthe Power System Expansion and Efficiency Improvement Investment Program \nin Bangladesh; and \n(ii)  approve the proposal set out in para. 12 of this report to permit procurement in \nnonmember  countries  of  ADB  of  goods,  works,  and  services  produced  in \nnonmember countries of ADB.  \n \n   \n ", "4 \n \nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/LinkedDocs/?id=42378-017-MFF Tranche Report \n \n1.
