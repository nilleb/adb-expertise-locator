THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans in \nthe aggregate amount of up to $100 million (or Indian rupee equivalent) to special purpose \nvehicles owned and controlled by ACME Solar Energy Private Limited for the ACME-EDF Solar \nPower Project in India.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n1.  Project Identification \n \n2.  The  ACME  group  is  a  pioneer  in  solar  power  development  in  India.  In  2009,  it \ncommissioned the first pilot solar thermal power project based on tower technology in India with \na capacity of 2.5 megawatts (MW). Since then it has developed 65 MW of solar photovoltaic \nprojects. In October 2013 EDF Energies Nouvelles (EDF EN) and EREN, two leading renewable \nenergy developers from France, took a combined equity stake of 50% in ACME Solar Energy \nPrivate Limited (ASEPL), the solar subsidiary of ACME. With these new investors and a solid \npipeline, ASEPL is expected to significantly contribute to the goal of the Jawaharlal Nehru \nNational Solar Mission (JNNSM), which aims to achieve an installed capacity of 22,000 MW of \nsolar power in India by 2022.2 In February 2014, ASEPL won 100 MW of solar photovoltaic \npower projects under the JNNSM phase 2 tender. \n \n3.  It will be ADB\u2019s first direct support to solar photovoltaic projects developed under the \nJNNSM. ADB\u2019s assistance is required to support decreasing solar tariffs through long-tenor \nfixed-rate loans. ADB\u2019s assistance will also support the entry of foreign renewable energy \ndevelopers (EDF EN and EREN) into the Indian solar sector, catalyzing much-needed foreign \ndirect investment (FDI) and expertise into this key sector. \n \n2.  Project Design \n \n4.  The project involves the financing and implementation of 200 MW of solar photovoltaic \nprojects by ASEPL during 2014\u20132017. ADB will provide debt financing to the 100 MW already \nawarded under JNNSM phase 2, as well as to 100 MW of projects to be identified after approval \nby the ADB Board of Directors. \n \n5.  The  100  MW  of  capacity  awarded  under  the  JNNSM  phase  2  encompasses  five \nindividual projects of 20 MW each that will be developed by five different special purpose \nvehicles (SPVs): ACME Gurgaon Power Private Limited (Gurgaon Power), ACME  Mumbai \nPower  Private  Limited  (Mumbai  Power),  ACME  Rajdhani  Power  Private  Limited  (Rajdhani \nPower), Medha Energy Private Limited (Medha Energy), and Ranji Solar Energy Private Limited \n(Ranji Energy). The five projects are all located near the village of Badi Sid in Jodhpur district of \nRajasthan,  160  kilometers  northwest  of  the  city  of  Jodhpur.  The  annual  global  horizontal \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. 2010.

", "2   \nirradiance3 at the project site is estimated to be 1,996 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per square meter on \naverage, one of the highest in the country.4 \n \n6.  The five projects will be developed and implemented in accordance with the JNNSM \nphase 2 tender procurement requirements.5 First, Ranji Energy, awarded under the domestic \ncomponent  requirement,  will  procure  mono  crystalline  solar  panels  domestically.  Second, \nGurgaon Power, Mumbai Power, Rajdhani Power, and Medha Energy, awarded under the open \ncategory, will procure panels without any geographical restriction. The panel suppliers are \nselected by ASEPL in compliance with ADB\u2019s procurement policies. Commissioning of the five \nprojects is expected by 28 April 2015. \n \n7.  The additional 100 MW of projects to be financed by ADB will be selected by ADB and \nstructured on standard terms and conditions similar to the first five projects. The selection of \nsuch additional projects will be based on the following criteria and standard ADB private sector \noperations and due diligence procedures: (i) solar photovoltaic projects in India with long-term \nofftake, (ii) financial viability, (iii) risk-adjusted pricing of the ADB loans, and (iv) compliance with \nall ADB policies. Subject to the approval of the proposed loans by the Board, the borrowers, \namount and structure of the financing for the additional projects will be reviewed and approved \nby ADB\u2019s Investment Committee.6 To ensure full utilization of the proposed loans within a \nreasonable  time  after  Board  approval,  the  additional  100  MW  of  projects  will  need  to  be \nfinanced by December 2016. Due diligence has been conducted on the first five borrowers, the \nsponsors, as well as their respective shareholders, directors, and key management. The project \nteam will update due diligence during project implementation, and undertake due diligence on \nall additional borrowers.  \n \n3.  The Borrower and Sponsors \n \n8.  All  borrowers  will  be  different  SPVs  controlled  and  owned  by  ASEPL.  ASEPL  was \nestablished by ACME to develop solar energy projects across India. ASEPL has 25 MW of \noperational  solar  photovoltaic  projects  in  Madhya  Pradesh,  and  25  MW  of  projects  under \nconstruction in Odisha. ASEPL is owned 50% by ACME (32% by ACME Cleantech Solution \nLimited [ACSL] and 18% by MKU Holdings Private Limited), 26% by EDF EN, and 24% by \nEREN. EDF EN and EREN have together committed to invest $100 million in ASEPL. \n \n9.  ACME is specialized in energy saving solutions for telecommunication companies and in \nthe development of renewable energy projects. The company was founded in 2003 by Manoj \nKumar  Upadhyay,  a  research  engineer  in  the  telecommunications  and  power  sectors. \nHeadquartered in Gurgaon, India, ACME has over 20 offices in India and a presence in more \nthan 10 countries.  \n \n10.  EDF EN is fully owned by EDF, the second-largest utility in the world. EDF acquired EDF \nEN from P\u00e2ris Mouratoglou and other investors in 2011. EDF EN has more than 20 years of \nexperience in solar power. With 7,190 MW of capacity in operation7 and 2,320 MW of capacity \n                                                \n3  Measure of intensity and availability of sunlight in a given location, which can be converted to electricity either \nthrough photovoltaic solar panels or concentrating solar thermal power technology. \n4  The global horizontal radiance estimation is based on the METEONORM  6.0  weather database developed by the \nprivate company Meteotest. \n5  Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. 2012.

New Delhi (December). \n6  The borrowers for the additional projects will be different SPVs controlled and owned by ASEPL (para. 8). \n7  This consists of wind 6,255 MW, solar 719 MW, and others 216 MW. ", "  3 \nunder construction worldwide as of June 2014, EDF EN is a leading player in the renewable \nenergy sector. EDF EN operates in 17 countries, mainly in Europe and North America, and \nmore recently in Africa and the Middle East. EDF EN\u2019s turnover for the fiscal year ending 31 \nDecember 2013 was $1.7 billion. \n \n11.  EREN,  founded  in  2012  by  P\u00e2ris  Mouratoglou  and  David  Corchia,  is  a  company \ndedicated to renewable energies and natural resource savings. EREN has a diversified portfolio \nof circa 300 MW of renewable energy projects (wind, solar, and hydro power) in operation and \nconstruction in France, Greece, Italy, Israel and India and is an active investor in several \ncompanies with innovative technology solutions that allow for more efficient use of natural \nresources.  \n \n12.  ASEPL\u2019s board of directors consists of four individuals: (i) Manoj Kumar Upadhyay, the \nfounder of ACME; (ii) R. M. Samy from ASEPL, with over 30 years\u2019 experience in administration, \ncorporate affairs, finance, and accounting; (iii) Antoine Garret, vice-president of EDF EN in \ncharge of business development in Asia; and (iv) Pierre Dagallier, board member of the EREN \ngroup. The board of directors of ASEPL is supported by a well-qualified management team with \na strong solar and/or business background.  \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n1.  Impact \n \n13.  The project's impact will be the diversification of India\u2019s energy mix through the addition \nof renewable energy capacity, helping the country progress towards its clean energy targets.8 \nTo achieve sustainable long-term economic growth, India is promoting alternative sources of \nenergy, such as solar, for power generation. Solar is a secure, reliable, and sustainable source \nof  electricity  that  diversifies  the  country\u2019s  energy  mix,  strengthening  energy  security  and \nreducing reliance on fossil fuels. \n \n14.  The  project  also  contributes  to  the  acceleration  and  expansion  of  private  sector \ninvestment, including FDI, in clean energy infrastructure in India. ASEPL and its shareholders \nsee ADB\u2019s potential assistance as a key success factor to expanding the company\u2019s solar \nportfolio. In particular, it is expected that ADB\u2019s assistance will help demonstrate the viability of \nthe JNNSM phase 2 offtake structure, which in turn will help attract further investments in the \nIndian solar sector from both within and outside India. \n \n2.  Outcome \n \n15.  The project's outcome is increased solar power capacity installed and operated by the \nprivate sector. The project will generate 380,000 megawatt-hours of clean energy per annum \nand  contribute  to  avoiding  280,000  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  emissions  annually  from  2018 \nonwards. \n \n                                                \n8  The government has established targets of adding 30 gigawatts of renewable power (including solar, wind, \nbiomass, and small hydro) by 2017 under the Twelfth Five-Year Plan. \n ", "4   \n3.  Output \n \n16.  The  project  output  is  the  development  and  commissioning  of  100  MW  of  solar \nphotovoltaic power projects under JNNSM phase 2 by December 2015 and an additional 100 \nMW of solar photovoltaic power projects by December 2017. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n \n17.  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.9 The midterm \nreview calls for investing $2 billion annually in clean energy (including renewable energy). The \nmidterm review highlights the key role of the private sector in climate change mitigation and \nconfirms that ADB should continue to prioritize private sector operations in clean and renewable \nenergy. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s India country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017, which \ncalls for \u201cinvestments in renewable energy development, particularly solar.\u201d10 \n \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n \n18.  The project is fully aligned with ADB's Energy Policy.11 The policy states that support for \nrenewable energy projects will be prioritized and broadened. In 2013, ADB increased its target \nof clean energy investments to $2 billion a year from the previous target of $1 billion a year. As \npart of the policy implementation, ADB is emphasizing private sector participation as a tool to \nincrease energy sector efficiency by introducing increased competition and increased investable \nresources. The proposed investment also contributes to ADB\u2019s Asia Solar Energy Initiative and \ncomplements sovereign interventions in the sector (for example, the sovereign project that is \nsupporting renewable power evacuation from Rajasthan to other states).12  \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n \n19.  The total funding requirement for the 200 MW pipeline is estimated at $265 million. \n \n20.

Table 4 summarizes the implementation arrangements.13 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  The construction period for the first five projects (100 MW) is from October 2014 to \nApril 2015. The life of the PPA with SECI is 25 years from COD. The remaining 100 \nMW of projects will be developed between 2015 and 2017. \nConstruction arrangements   All projects will enter into lump-sum turnkey contracts (EPC contracts) for the \nEngineering, procurement, and  procurement and supply of foreign and domestic equipment and erection, \nconstruction  construction, and services for the project. The EPC contracts will include standard \nprovisions for liquidated damages on schedule and performance.  \nEquipment supplier  For the first five projects, ACSL will source panels from well-reputed suppliers and \nfrom different technologies (thin film, multi-crystalline). All selected technologies \nare suited to warm and dry environments such as Rajasthan. All modules will \nbenefit from performance warranties for 25 years.  The remaining 100 MW of \nprojects will use suppliers of similar quality, to ADB\u2019s satisfaction. \nCivil works  Confidential information deleted  \nTransmission line and  The electricity generated from the five first projects will be evacuated from the \nconnection to the grid  project site to the nearest  substation under the responsibility of Rajasthan Vidyut \nPrasaran Nigam Limited through a 132-kilovolt double-circuit transmission line to \nbe built under the EPC contracts of the five projects. The substation is under \nconstruction and is expected to be operational by December 2014. \nOperations arrangements  Each borrower of the first five projects has entered into a PPA with SECI, which is \n     Revenue structure  wholly owned by the Government of India, to sell 100% of the output of the project \nfor a period of 25 years at a fixed tariff of Rs5.45 per kWh ($0.089 per kWh). SECI \nwill on-sell the electricity to a pool of distribution utilities (10\u201320 state electricity \nboards or distribution utilities) under a power sale agreement at a price of Rs5.50 \nper kWh ($0.09 per kWh) and for a period of 25 years. The PPA provides for the \npayment of a subsidy\u2014the viability gap funding\u2014over the first 5 years of operation. \nThe viability gap financing is payable in six tranches: 50% is paid upon successful \ncommissioning and 50% is released over the next 5 years in five equal installments \nof 10% if the borrower maintains a certain level of electricity generation. For the \nremaining 100 MW of projects, output will be sold to government-owned entities \nsuch as state utilities or central government entities such as SECI or private sector \nofftakers with a credit standing, to ADB\u2019s satisfaction. \nOperation and maintenance  ASEPL will be responsible for operation and maintenance of all projects for 25 \nyears from COD.  \nPerformance monitoring  Key performance indicators will be reported by the borrowers of the ACME-EDF \nSolar Power Project and monitored by ADB.

Projected Financial and Economic Performance \n \n22.   Confidential information deleted.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n23.  ADB will provide up to $100 million (or Indian rupee equivalent) in limited-recourse loans \nto multiple SPVs owned by ASEPL to finance 200 MW of solar photovoltaic power projects \nduring 2014\u20132016.  \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n24.  The proposed transaction merits ADB\u2019s assistance for the following reasons: \n(i)  Solar  power  policy  support.  ADB  will  support  the  first  round  of  projects \nfinanced under JNNSM phase 2. While the objective of JNNSM phase 1 was to \npilot different solar power technologies in India, the objective of phase 2 is to \ndramatically scale up capacity addition in the sector. ADB\u2019s assistance will help \ndemonstrate the viability and bankability of the new offtake structure (i.e., pooling \nof multiple offtakers through the Solar Energy Corporation of India [SECI]), which \nwill ensure the success of the subsequent rounds of phase 2. \n(ii)  Single Board approval, multiple projects. The requested Board approval will \nenable ADB to support multiple projects that likely would have been too small for \nseparate financing by ADB. Further, ADB\u2019s commitment for a total of $100 million \nin long-term project finance loans through a single Board approval will enable \nASEPL  to  implement  additional  solar  photovoltaic  projects  in  a  manner  that \ndelivers competitively priced solar tariffs to Indian distribution utilities. \n(iii)  Foreign direct investment support. ADB\u2019s assistance will support the entrance \nof leading foreign renewable energy players (EDF EN and EREN) into the Indian \nmarket. ADB\u2019s assistance will facilitate $100 million in FDI, which EDF EN and \nEREN have committed to invest as equity in ASEPL. In addition to much-needed \ncapital, FDI will bring new technical knowledge and expertise to the country. \n \nC.  Risks14 \n \n25.  Offtaker risk. The first five projects have entered into a power purchase agreement with \nSECI at a tariff of Rs5.45 per kWh. SECI will on-sell the power to a pool of distribution utilities \nand  bulk  purchasers  (10\u201320  offtakers)  at  a  price  of  Rs5.50  per  kWh.  These  projects  are \nexposed to a nonpayment risk from SECI and indirectly from SECI\u2019s offtakers. However, (i) the \ncompetitive tariff of Rs5.45 and the renewable purchase obligation partly mitigates the risk of \nstate  utilities\u2019  default  in  the  short  and  long  term;  (ii)  the  first  five  projects  benefit  from  a \ndiversification effect of the final electricity purchasers; and (iii) SECI is a Government of India \nenterprise and, as such, benefits from the implicit support from the central government.  \n \n26.  Confidential information deleted.  \n \n27.  Confidential information deleted.  \n \n                                                \n14  This section relates to the first five projects awarded under JNNSM phase 2. ", "  7 \n28.  Technology risk. All modules selected for the first five projects are proven technologies \nwhich have been in commercial operation globally for more than 10 years. EDF EN led the \nselection and certification of technology and equipment providers, providing an additional level \nof comfort. Unique local conditions in Rajasthan, such as high ambient air temperatures and \nhigh levels of dust and soiling, could impair module performance. The forecast of energy yields \nhas conservatively factored in the loss in performance caused by high temperatures, soiling, \nand other factors. Adequate performance guarantees and liquidated damages will be obtained \nfrom manufacturers and engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor. \n \n29.  Confidential information deleted.  \n \n30.  Confidential information deleted.  \n \n31.  Construction delay risk. Under the SECI power purchase agreement, commissioning \nfor the first five projects is due by 28 April 2015. A delay of more than 3 months in the \ncommissioning date of the first five projects will affect the tariff, resulting in reduced cash flows \nfor the project. Risk of delay beyond 3 months is viewed as limited because (i) the EPC \ncontractor and the sponsors have extensive experience, and (ii) the EPC contract will provide \nfor liquidated damages for any delay in completion.  \n \n32.  Operation and maintenance risk. Operation and maintenance (O&M) risk for a solar \nphotovoltaic plant is primarily limited to ensuring adequate cleaning and replacing inverters after \n10 years. ASEPL is considered to have the necessary experience, being the O&M contractor for \nits 40 MW operational portfolio since 2012. O&M risk is not considered significant. \n \n33.  Confidential information deleted. \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n34.  The project is processed as corporate finance from a safeguards and social dimensions \nperspective, with ADB funds expected to be allocated for implementing specific solar projects. In \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified category B \nfor  environment  and  involuntary  resettlement  and  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  The \npotential  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  the  projects  will  be  identified  and  effective \nmeasures  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and  compensate  for  the  adverse  impacts  will  be \nincorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. In addition to compliance with the safeguard \nrequirements  for  individual  projects,  ASEPL  has  established  and  commits  to  maintain  an \nenvironmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS)  to  screen,  assess,  and  address \nenvironmental  and  social  impacts  and  risks.  The  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of \nASEPL to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \n35.  The first five projects, developed under JNNSM phase 2 in Jodhpur district, Rajasthan \nwill be constructed on government land, classified as barren and non-agriculture land. ASEPL \nwill avoid any impacts on local population by excluding from the project site parcels of land used \nby locals for grazing or agricultural purposes. Unavoidable impacts, if any, on non-titleholders \noccupying the government lands will be addressed in line with ADB requirements. An audit of \nthe land procurement process to confirm compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) requirements on involuntary resettlement and that no impacts on indigenous peoples \n ", "8   \noccurred will be carried out. Information disclosure and consultations will be carried out in \naccordance with ADB requirements.15 \n \n36.  A corporate audit was conducted on the ASEPL\u2019s ESMS. Key findings of the audit show \nthat the ESMS is substantively compliant with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements, \nwhile  gaps  exist  with  respect  to  the  actual  implementation  of  ESMS  provisions, for  which \ncorrective actions have been agreed upon by ASEPL. ASEPL commits to have in place an \nESMS that is compliant with the Safeguard Policy Statement, which is satisfactory to ADB, prior \nto the first disbursement. ASEPL\u2019s project selection criteria will include that only projects with \nland allotted by government or purchased in the private land market will be eligible for inclusion. \nASEPL will submit monitoring reports on the implementation of its ESMS and the projects. In \naddition, an initial environmental examination and a resettlement plan or a due diligence report \ndocumenting the negotiated settlement for land acquisition will be prepared for each of the \nprojects to be funded by the ADB loan (para. 7).  \n \n37.  Other social dimensions. ASEPL is committed to prioritizing local residents for jobs \ncreated during construction and operation. ASEPL\u2019s human resource policies promote equal \nopportunities for women and ensure that the rights of women are protected. The project is \nclassified as having no gender elements. ADB will ensure that the investment documentation \nincludes appropriate provisions requiring the borrowers to comply with national labor laws and, \nin addition, to take specific measures (including in relation to contractors) in relation to the \ninternationally recognized core labor standard for the ADB-financed portion of the project, in \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy.16 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n38.  ASEPL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe  financing  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n39.  The  proposed  loan  is  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single \nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n40.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment of India will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nassistance to ASEPL and its subsidiaries. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in \nform and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the \nBoard of Directors. \n \n \n \n                                                \n15  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy; and Findings of the Corporate Safeguards Audit: Environmental \nand Social Management System Arrangement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n16   ADB. 2003.
