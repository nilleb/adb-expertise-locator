A number \nof projects are facing implementation problems and delays because of the constrained project \nmanagement  capacity  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  and  the  government\u2019s \nVanuatu Project Management Unit (VPMU). To minimize the reoccurrence of similar problems in \nfuture operations, the TA will also support the strengthening of institutional and policy frameworks \nfor sound and sustainable project management in Vanuatu.  \n \nSignificant capacity weaknesses, particularly in the Ministry of Infrastructure and Public \n2. \nUtilities (MIPU) and VPMU, have severely affected the quality and timeliness of project execution \nby  the  agencies  responsible  for  infrastructure  operations  in  Vanuatu.  The  government  staff \ninvolved  in  projects  is  limited,  and  they  lack  experience  and  skills.  The  Vanuatu  Interisland \nShipping Support Project (VISSP) is facing serious delays and is unable to deliver results because \nof  poor  consultant  performance  and  failed  designs.1 To  help  the  government  meet  its  urgent \nneeds for technical expertise in managing project tasks, the TA will provide consultant support to \nfill gaps in human resources and improve the skills and abilities of national staff to successfully \nimplement projects. For VISSP, this includes redesigning wharves and procuring a new civil works \ncontract. The primary focus of the TA will be to improve the implementation performance of VISSP, \nbut the TA will also support the Cyclone Pam Schools Project and the Vanuatu Energy Access \nProject  to  ensure  timely  implementation. 2  In  addition  to  addressing  the  immediate  capacity \nbuilding  needs  of  MIPU,  VPMU,  and  other  ministries,  government  staff  will  have  increased \nopportunities to work with international experts and acquire technical knowledge through on-the-\njob training.  \n \nTo identify systematic issues affecting project performance, ADB and the Government of \n3. \nVanuatu  held  a  comprehensive  country  portfolio  review  mission  in  April  2018.  The  review \nreinforced the finding that it is critical for Vanuatu to have an enabling institutional setup for strong \nand sustainable project management. Therefore, the TA will support two interlinked endeavors. \nFirst,  the  project  team\u2014through  the  TA\u2014will  review  VPMU\u2019s  organizational  structure,  internal \ncapacity, and defined roles and responsibilities to propose alternative models for effective project \nmanagement. A key objective of the review is to assist the government in establishing optimal \nlines of responsibilities between VPMU and MIPU on project management and to improve project \nownership. Second, the TA will strengthen the government\u2019s public financial management (PFM) \nand investment management practices by supporting the implementation of Vanuatu\u2019s PFM road \nmap.  TA  activities  will  focus  on  medium-term  fiscal  planning,  economic  analysis  of  public \ninvestments, and better data management through a modern financial management information \nsystem. This will lead to better-prepared projects, a broader understanding of the requirements \nto  manage  significant  public  investments,  and  proper  resourcing,  including  lifetime  costs  (i.e., \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2011.

The  TA  is  in  line  with  the  government\u2019s  2015  National \nRecovery  and  Economic  Strengthening  Program  Plan  to  strengthen  the  country\u2019s  economic \nresilience by developing its domestic institutional and human resources and capacity.3 \n \nB. \n \nThe  TA  will  support  three  interlinked  outputs:  (i)  VPMU\u2019s  capacity  for  implementing \n4. \nongoing projects strengthened; (ii) measures to improve government project management and \ninstitutional arrangements recommended, and implementation supported; and (iii) implementation \nof  Vanuatu\u2019s  PFM  road  map  for  improved  public  investments  supported.  These  outputs  are \naligned with the recommendations of the Vanuatu Transport Plan 2030, currently being prepared \nwith  ADB\u2019s  support.4 The  project  team,  through  the  TA,  will  act  on  key  recommendations  for \nstrengthening  the  institutional  setup  for  project  management  made  by  the  April  2018  Vanuatu \ncountry portfolio review mission.   \n \n5. \nOutput 1: Vanuatu Project Management Unit\u2019s capacity for implementing ongoing \nprojects  strengthened.  The  TA  will  provide  critical  expertise  to  VPMU  for  stronger  project \nimplementation. It will fund international and national consultants to help bring VISSP back on \ntrack,  ensure  safeguards  compliance  of  the  Vanuatu  Energy  Access  Project,  and  strengthen \nmanagement of the Cyclone Pam Schools Reconstruction Project. The consultants will provide \non-the-job training for national staff to improve their technical knowledge and capacity for them to \nlead more demanding assignments independently. VPMU will hire junior graduates as trainees to \nincrease its future human resource capacity.  \n \n6. \nOutput 2: Measures to improve government project management and institutional \narrangements recommended, and implementation supported. Building on existing analyses, \nthe  project  team,  through  the  TA,  will  assess  the  institutional  arrangements  for  project \nimplementation  and  propose  a  business  model  that  is  acceptable  to  the  government.  The \nbusiness  model  will  enable  sustainable  project  management,  build  domestic  capacity,  and \nstrengthen government ownership and accountability.5 Identifying and developing this model will \nrequire intensive consultations and consensus-building with VPMU, the Ministry of Finance and \nEconomic Management (MFEM), the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, the Council of Ministers, and other \nministries. Once the government has approved a preferred model for project management, the \nTA will support its implementation. Through the TA, the project team will \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nreview the recommendations made under the existing analyses and assess their \nrelevance  given  the  problems  that  have  arisen  since  the  report  was  finalized \n(footnote 6); \nreview  the  allocation  of  project  implementation  responsibilities  between  VPMU, \nMIPU, and other ministries;  \nreview regional and international practices on project management arrangements; \nsupport the government with consultations and consensus-building; \nassist the government in identifying an optimal project management model;  \nensure the consistency of the recommendation with the Vanuatu Transport Plan \n2030;  \nprepare a report with recommendations to the Council of Ministers, if necessary; \nand  \n\n                                                 \n3   Government  of  Vanuatu.  2015.

Sound  PFM  and  governance  are  prerequisites  for \nsustained investment and growth. To complement the project and institutional-level support under \noutputs 1 and 2, the TA will also help the government to implement its PFM road map. However, \nthe government faces challenges to implement the PFM road map. The TA will respond to the \ngovernment\u2019s needs for ADB to assist in three specific areas: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nfor \n\nimproving \n\nthe  government\u2019s \n\nimplementing key PFM road map actions, including prioritizing and sequencing for \nreforms;   \nreviewing  options \ninformation system, which at present does not meet the country\u2019s needs; and \nsupporting MFEM to improve economic analysis of significant public investments, \nwhich  will  be  considered  in  the  national  budgeting  processes;  and  supporting \nMFEM  to  design  and  implement  a  medium-term  expenditure  framework.  The \ngovernment  needs  to  establish  and  execute  a  proper  medium-term  expenditure \nframework  if  it  is  to  budget  public  resources  effectively  and  efficiently  to  fulfil \nnational and sector strategies and outcomes, and strengthen the coordination of \ndonor-funded projects.  \n\nfinancial  management \n\n \nThese efforts aim to improve the broad policy environment for public investment and PFM. \n8. \nDepending on the government\u2019s preferred approach, ADB can provide follow-up support through \na  policy-based  grant,  a  stand-alone  project,  or  a  combination  of  both  in  a  sector  development \nprogram.6 \n \n9. \n \n\nThe major outputs and activities are summarized in Table 1. \n\nTable 1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities \n \n\nMajor Outputs \n\nDelivery Dates \n\nKey Activities with Milestones \n\n1.
