It  will  also  enhance \ninstitutional capacity to manage railway safety.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nRailway development in the PRC. The railway sector is vital to the PRC\u2019s economic and \nsocial  development,  international  trade,  continued  economic  growth,  and  ability  to  extend  the \nbenefits of development to people living in the more remote regions of the country. The PRC is a \nvast country where people and goods move over long distances, and railways provide the most \neconomic means of transport. Railways have the competitive advantage in moving passengers, \nbulk  goods,  and  containers  over  medium  to  long  distances.  The  government  has  therefore \nprioritized  the  expansion  and  modernization  of  the  railway  network.  During  2003\u20132015,  the \nrailway network expanded by 65%, from 73,000 kilometers (km) to 121,000 km. The PRC has \nalso  developed  the  world's  longest  high-speed  railway  network  (19,000  km).  However, \nimprovements have mainly occurred in eastern PRC and the network remains rather sparse and \nbasic in western and southwestern PRC. \n \n4. \nRailway  development  in  southwestern  PRC.  Despite  the  PRC\u2019s  vast  expertise  in \ndeveloping  the  high-speed  rail  network,  constructing  medium-speed  rail  lines  in  a  highly \nmountainous region such as southwestern PRC poses considerable problems. The difficult and \ndangerous terrain in southwestern PRC is one of the main reasons why the rail network in the \nregion  remains  inadequate.  This  region  has  also  lagged  in  economic  development  and  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) per capita remains quite low compared to the more prosperous eastern \nprovinces  (e.g.  provinces  of  Sichuan  and  Yunnan  are  ranked  23  and  30  respectively  out  of \n31 administrative divisions in the PRC). The limited capacity for freight movements and the long \ntravel times of passenger trains are considered major obstacles to economic development and \npoverty  reduction  in  the  region.  Hence,  the  PRC  is  prioritizing  the  development  of  the  railway \ninfrastructure in this region to increase speeds and more than double the freight-carrying capacity \nthrough its Western Development Strategy. However, the PRC needs assistance and expertise \nin  ensuring  that  the  railway  lines  are  well  designed,  properly  constructed,  and  conform  to  the \nhighest standards of safety. \n \n5. \nRailway  safety.  Safety  is  an  integral  part  of  providing  competitive,  high-quality,  and \nreliable transportation for people and goods. As the PRC railway sector expands, introducing new \nconcepts and technologies and increasing speeds, the safety needs are changing as well. The \nPRC recognizes this important aspect and seeks to promote modern rail safety technologies and \nemergency  management  systems  consistent  with  the  development  needs  of  the  country\u2019s \nrailways. It seeks to attract foreign technology and expertise to meet these needs, an area where \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) can play a significant role. \n\n                                                \n1  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Railway Safety Enhancement Project. \n\n\fThe safety issue is a challenge because the trains encounter difficult operating conditions \n6. \namid varying geological features as they crisscross the length and breadth of the country. This is \nparticularly so in southwestern PRC, where the terrain is mountainous and railway lines should \nbe  built  with  many  bridges  and  tunnels.  Operating  a  railway  through  several  tunnels  poses \nsignificant challenges for railway safety. Special arrangements need to be made for signaling to \nensure  speed  restrictions,  real-time  monitoring  of  tunnel  conditions,  and  proper  lighting,  and \nemergency  systems  for  firefighting,  ventilation,  and  rescue  need  to  be  installed.  Various  new \ntechnologies  now  exist  for  improving  the  safety  of  rail  tunnels,  and  can  play  a  vital  role  in \npreventing accidents as well as enabling a swift emergency response. \n \n7. \nSouthwestern  PRC  has  two  major  fault  lines  (Anning  River  Fault  Line  and  Daliang \nMountain  Fault  Line),  so  railway  construction  in  the  region  requires  high-intensity  earthquake \nfortification.  Mountainous  areas  are  also  prone  to  landslides,  which  cause  rocks  and  debris  to \nblock the track and make train operations unsafe. A stronger safety management system, which \nincludes advanced signaling and communication arrangements and more effective management \ninformation, is needed to prevent train accidents and to respond promptly if they do occur. \n \n8. \nChengdu\u2013Kunming railway line. The Chengdu\u2013Kunming railway line is a key part of a \nregional corridor that will eventually extend to the countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion, \nand  thus  become  a  part  of  an  international  railway  route connecting  the  subregion  to  western \nPRC, Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation countries, and the Eurasian land bridge. \n \n9. \nThe existing line between Chengdu and Kunming was built between 1958 and 1970. It is \na  single-track  line  with  operating  speeds  in  the  range  of  40  km\u201360  km  per  hour.  It  has  been \noperating  at  near  full  capacity  for  more  than  10  years.  To  expand  capacity  across  the \nsouthwestern region of the PRC, the China Railway Corporation (CRC) is constructing a railway \nline from Chengdu to Kunming with 18 stations. This will involve construction of 860 km of double-\ntrack electrified main railway line for passenger and freight transport operations. The proposed \nalignment of the new Chengdu\u2013Kunming railway line is shorter by 236 km (21.5%) compared with \nthe existing single-track line (1,096 km) and has better geometry. The development of the line is \nbeing done in several phases: Guangtong\u2013Kunming (2016), Miyi\u2013Guangtong (2017), Chengdu\u2013\nE\u2019Mei (2018), and E\u2019Mei\u2013Miyi (2022). \n \n10. \nThe capacity along the entire route from Chengdu to Kunming will be greatly increased. \nTrain speeds on the new railway line will increase to 160 km per hour from the existing 60 km per \nhour.  The  tonnage could  increase from  3,200  tons  to  4,000 tons  net  per  freight  train,  and  the \ncapacity for passenger train pairs per day could increase from 12 to 35. The shorter alignment \nand  faster  train  speeds  will  shorten  the  travel  time  to  less  than  8  hours  for  passenger  trains. \nPresently, it takes 18\u201322 hours for people to travel from Chengdu to Kunming via rail. \n \nThe region is also one of the most scenic areas in the PRC, so better rail services along \n11. \nthis  route  will  support  tourism.  Sites  such  as  Qionghai  Lake  in Xichang,  hot  springs  and  karst \ncaves in Panzhihua, and Mount E\u2019Mei will become much more accessible to tourists, and more \nvisitors will also contribute to the overall economic development of southwestern PRC. \n \n12. \nE\u2019Mei\u2013Miyi section. ADB financing will support the provision of safety equipment for the \nE\u2019Mei\u2013Miyi  section  (386  km)  of  the  Chengdu\u2013Kunming  railway  line,  which  is  the  most  difficult \nsection of the railway.2 It runs mostly through treacherous terrain traversing mountains and steep \n\n                                                \n2  This section is currently under construction, and roughly 19% of the works are completed (30 June 2017). \n \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\friver valleys and requiring 141 bridges (80.8 km) and 52 tunnels (211.4 km), 7 of which will be \nlonger than 10 km each, and climbing 1,200 meters over 95 km in a grade of 1.2%.3 The total \nlength of bridges and tunnels is 292.2 km, accounting for 75.7% of the alignment. The complex \nterrain, coupled with the increased weight, speed, and number of trains, adds to the importance \nof the safety of railway operations on the Chengdu\u2013Kunming railway line. \n \n13. \nValue  added  by  ADB  assistance.  While  the  PRC  has  made  significant  advances  in \nrailway  technology,  the  areas  of  signaling  and  safety  systems  remain  a  challenge. 4  ADB's \nfinancing will support railway safety equipment that conforms to the best international standards. \nThe cost of the equipment is relatively small compared  with the cost of other capital assets or \nconstruction of a railway line, but the benefits are significant. For example, investing in a high-\nquality signaling and information system, trackside defect detectors, and advanced train control \nsystems will ensure that unsafe movements of trains are prevented and train operators have the \nnecessary and complete information needed for safe train operations, including routing, spacing, \nspeed control, protection, and shunting. Since the line has many long tunnels, emergency rescue \nfacilities  and  procedures  are  critical  in  preventing  a  disaster  associated  with  an  accident  or  a \ntunnel  fire  involving  a  train.  The  tunnel  safety  equipment  planned  for  the  E\u2019Mei\u2013Miyi  section \nserves to minimize risk and mitigate any potential casualties. \n \n14. \nThe capacity-building component will assist the executing agency, implementing agency, \nand the Chengdu Rail Bureau in developing a strong understanding of international best practices \nin integrating safety and emergency response. Training railway staff in emergency response and \nevacuation  procedures,  along  with  recurrent  emergency  evacuation  drills,  will  ensure  that  any \nemergency involving tunnels can be quickly dealt with by locally stationed personnel. The small \ninvestment would have a significantly high value addition, allowing considerable leverage of ADB \nfinancing. \n \n15. \nNew technologies. ADB financing will help introduce new and modern technologies for \nthe mountain railway line in southwestern PRC. The equipment to be procured will be the most \nsophisticated available in the market, consistent with the safety needs of operating a mountain \nrailway system with very long tunnels. Examples of this kind of equipment to be financed under \nthe project are centralized traffic control,5 train control,6 and advanced ventilation and evacuation \nsystems for tunnels. Other technologies to be installed along the railway line, such as hot box \ndetectors and train fault detection, will enable detection and provide advance warning regarding \nrolling stock failures. \n \nLessons from previous projects. Railway safety has been a major focus of ADB support \n16. \nfor PRC railways. In 2007, ADB provided a loan to develop emergency rescue and restoration \nsystems. 7  More  recently,  the  program  for  energy  efficiency  and  railway  safety  supported \ninstallation of energy-efficient power supply equipment, railway electrification systems, and rail \ntrack  safety. 8 In  2011,  the  safety  of  long  tunnels  and  related  emergency  rescue  plans  and \n                                                \n3  A grade of 1.2% means a 12-meter increase in elevation over a 1,000-meter length. \n4  This is evident from the railway accident that occurred in 2011 near Wenzhou when two high-speed trains collided \n\nowing to serious design flaws in crucial signaling equipment. \n\n5  Centralized traffic control refers to centralized railway signaling management that controls railway traffic flows through \n\na control panel, which graphically depicts the entire railway line. \n\n6  A  train  control  system  is  a  signaling,  control,  and  train  protection  system  designed  to  replace  conventional  track \n\nsignals and prevent overspeeding. It helps eliminate accidents owing to human error. \n\n7  ADB. 2007.

Manila. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nequipment were a particular focus of ADB technical assistance to study Europe\u2019s longest tunnels, \nthe  Chunnel  and  the  Gotthard  Base  Tunnel,  and  to  evaluate  international  best  practices.  The \nproject  seeks  to  build  upon  the  earlier  support,  and  provide  financing,  especially  for  safety \ninterventions  for  railways  in  mountainous  regions  that  have  unique  safety  requirements.  The \nspecialized  safety  requirement  for  a  mountain  railway  makes  this  project  different  from  the \nprevious support and provides additional value. It is expected that the PRC will continue to expand \nthe railway network in southwestern PRC, a region where rail connectivity is presently limited, so \ntechnologies implemented in this project can be replicated in future projects. \n \n17. \nStrategic  priorities.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  strategic  priority  of  \u201csupporting \ninclusive economic growth\u201d of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u201320209 since \nthe railway line is in a less developed region covering two of the poorest provinces in PRC. The \nproject also supports the priority of \u201cmanaging climate change and the environment\u201d because it \nassists  the  development  of  railways\u2013a  transport  mode  with  significantly  lower  emissions  and \nenergy consumption. It will help the PRC tackle the challenges highlighted above, and deepen \nthe cooperation between the government and ADB by helping  develop the rail transport mode \ninto  a  safe  transport  system  for  freight  and  passengers.  The  project  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nSustainable Transport Initiative, which highlights railway development as an important opportunity \nfor sustainable transport operations.10 \n \nThe project is supporting the safety of the E\u2019Mei\u2013Miyi railway section, which is an important \n18. \nproject  under  the  Thirteenth  Five-Year  Plan.11 The  railway  development  is  consistent  with  the \nplan\u2019s objectives of balanced development of rural and urban areas, better transport connectivity, \nand inclusive urbanization. The railway line also directly contributes to the government\u2019s Silk Road \nEconomic  Belt  initiative. 12 It  is  also  part  of  the  PRC\u2019s  latest  medium-  and  long-term  railway \nnetwork plan, which seeks to improve the railway system, especially in the central and western \nPRC.13 \n \nB. \n \n19. \nThe  impact  will  be  a  developed  safe,  reliable,  and  efficient  rail  transport  system  in \nsouthwestern PRC  (footnotes  11  and  13). The  outcome  will  be  a  developed  safe and  efficient \nrailway corridor between E\u2019Mei and Miyi.14 \n \nC. \n \nOutput 1: Railway signaling, communication, and power supply system developed. \n20. \nThis will include signaling and communication equipment to improve train operation safety, such \nas centralized train dispatching and monitoring, automatic block signaling, interlocking devices, \nand train control systems. This will also cover procurement of electric power supply, and bridge \nbearings for the safety of railway bridges.15 \n \n                                                \n9  ADB.  2016.

Staff  from  pertinent \ngovernment agencies will receive training on railway safety, disaster prevention, and emergency \ntunnel rescue operations to better equip them to handle rescue efforts in the event of a tunnel \naccident. About 100 staff from executing and implementing agencies will be trained, and technical \nexchanges  on  advanced  technologies  and  new  maintenance  techniques  will  be  organized  to \nfamiliarize staff in these areas. \n \nD. \n \n23. \n \n24. \nDetailed  cost  estimates  by  expenditure  category  and  by  financier  are  included  in  the \nproject  administration  manual  (PAM). 16  The  major  expenditure  items  are  equipment  and \nconsulting services.  \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $860 million, including taxes and duties (Table 1). \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nRailway signaling, communication, and power supply system \nTunnel safety operation and monitoring system installed \nInstitutional capacity building for railway safety management \n               Subtotal (A) \n\nBase Costb \n1.  \n2.  \n3.  \n \nContingenciesc \nFinancing Charges During Implementationd \n \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \nB. \nC. \n \nNote: Numbers may not sum precisely because of rounding. \na  Includes taxes and duties of $23.37 million to be financed from government resources as counterpart funds \n\n  \n368.80 \n338.71 \n2.25 \n709.76 \n109.11 \n41.13 \n860.00 \n\nTotal (A+B+C) \n\nAmounta \n\n \n\nthrough cash contributions.

The  indicative  flow  of  funds  and  the  onlending \narrangements are specified in the PAM (footnote 16).  \n \n\nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \n \nGovernment \nDomestic commercial bank loans \n\nOrdinary capital resources \n\nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nAmount  \n($ million) \n \n180.00 \n430.00 \n250.00 \n860.00 \n\nShare of Total \n(%) \n \n20.93 \n50.00 \n29.07 \n100.00 \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \nE. \n \n28. \nThe  executing  agency  will  be  the  CRC,  which  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project \nimplementation. The Planning and Statistics Department of the CRC will coordinate and supervise \nproject preparation, while the Material Department of the CRC will be responsible for supervising \nprocurement and project implementation. \n \nThe implementing agency will be CKRC, which is a joint-venture shareholding company \n29. \nestablished under the PRC company law. The shareholders are the China Railway Development \nFund Company Ltd., Chengdu Railway Bureau (both under CRC) and Sichuan Provincial Railway \nIndustry Investment Group Ltd. (under Sichuan Provincial Government). CKRC is responsible for \nproject  construction,  operations  management,  finance  and  accounting,  and  maintenance  of \ninfrastructure assets. CKRC does not have any previous ADB or World Bank project experience, \nand its staff is not familiar with ADB procurement policies and procedures. The executing agency \nhas engaged a tendering company to assist in procurement. Further support will be provided by \nengaging a consulting team under output 3 for guiding and training the staff in the implementing \nagency. \n \n30. \nThe project will be implemented over 7 years from  September 2017 to June 2024. The \nlonger implementation period is because this project is linked to the construction of the railway \nline. All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). All consultant services will \nbe recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time).

Some  of  the  specific  equipment  to  be  procured  under  the  project  includes  a  train \ncontrol  system  with  centralized  traffic  control,  an  advanced  automatic  block  signal  system, \nwayside  detectors,  tunnel  ventilation  systems,  and  tunnel  rescue  systems.  The  preliminary \ntechnical specifications of the equipment have been reviewed, and it has been confirmed that the \nequipment  is  compatible  with  and  suitable  for  the  proposed  railway  line  in  terms  of  the \nrequirements  of  the  projected  rail  traffic  and  speeds,  and  conforms  to  the  best  international \nstandards. \n \nB. \n \n32. \nThe ADB-financed components are limited to the safety systems on the E\u2019Mei\u2013Miyi railway \nline.  However,  it  was  not  considered  possible  to  do  the  economic  analysis  only  on  the  safety \nequipment. The economic assessment17 has been undertaken for the E\u2019Mei\u2013Miyi railway line and \nthe  existing  railway  line  as  a  corridor,  which  includes  track,  stations,  rolling  stock,  and  other \ncomponents. The railway corridor is economically viable with an estimated economic internal rate \nof  return  (EIRR)  of  14.80%.  Economic  benefits  include  (i)  user  cost  savings  for  freight  and \npassenger  traffic,  (ii)  time  savings  for  diverted  passenger  and  freight  traffic,  (iii)  generated \npassenger  and  freight  transport  benefits,  (iv)  road  user  and  shipper  savings  thanks  to  less \ncongestion and increased railway competition, (v) road accidents avoided, (vi) reduced pollution, \n(vii) fuel savings, and (viii) national productivity benefits. \n \nThe  sensitivity  analysis  of  potential  cost  overruns  and  benefit  reductions  demonstrates \n33. \nthat the railway corridor\u2019s economic viability is robust. The total cost would have to be more than \n39.3%  higher  than  estimated  for  the  EIRR  to  fall  below  the  threshold  level  of  9%.  The  freight \nbenefits would have to decrease by about 63.7% to make the rail corridor economically nonviable. \nCost for construction and installation and recurring fixed and variable costs carry relatively less \nrisk.  The  EIRR  is  less  sensitive  to  passenger  traffic  projections  and  delays  in  project \nimplementation. \n \n\n                                                \n17 Economic analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nA financial analysis18 was undertaken to assess the financial viability of the project based \n34. \non  the  capital  cost  of  construction  of  the  E\u2019Mei\u2013Miyi  railway  line.  The  financial  internal  rate  of \nreturn for the project, computed after tax, is 3.71%, which compares favorably with the estimated \nweighted average cost of capital of 3.13%. The average freight rate is assumed to increase by an \nannual 3%, and average passenger revenue rates are assumed to increase in real terms annually \nby  an  average  4%  for  express  trains  and  2%  for  conventional  slower-speed  trains  until  2035. \nThese increases also include the higher charges expected from moving high-value cargo such as \ncontainers and time-sensitive perishable goods, and from express freight services. The E\u2019Mei\u2013\nMiyi  railway  line  will  also provide  passengers  with significantly faster  and better  services,  thus \njustifying an increase in fares. During 2011\u20132015, the average freight rate of the CRC increased \nby 5.9% and the passenger rate by 4.8% annually. The government is also implementing tariff \nreforms that will allow the CRC to set tariffs based on market conditions and cost increases. This \nwill contribute to greater financial sustainability of the project. \n \nC. \n \nFinancial management. The financial management assessment (FMA) was conducted \n35. \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects19 \nand Financial Due Diligence: a Methodology Note20 and related Technical Guidance Notes. The \nFMA concluded that the capacity of both the CRC and CKRC is adequate and the overall financial \nmanagement risk is moderate. The CRC has prior and ongoing experience in implementing ADB \nprojects and an understanding of ADB procurement, disbursement, and financial management \nprocedures.  The  FMA  recommended  that  CKRC  further  strengthen  its  financial  management \ncapability by undertaking training, particularly on ADB policy and its procedural requirements for \nfinancial management, including financial reporting and disbursement.21 \n \n36. \nProcurement and anticorruption measures. All procurement to be financed under the \nADB loan will be done in accordance with ADB Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from \ntime to time). The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwill  be  included  in  all  procurement  documents  and  contracts.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and the CRC. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 16). \n \nD. \n \nA social and poverty analysis was conducted in accordance with ADB guidelines.22 The \n37. \nproject  impact  area  comprises  10  counties,  three  of  which  (Ganluo,  Xide,  and  Yuexi)  are \nprovincial-level poor counties. The project impact area contains 123 villages that are designated \nas  \u201cpoverty  villages\u201d.23 The  main  causes  of  poverty  are  low-intensity  agriculture  because  flat \narable  land  is  scarce,  few  income-generating  opportunities,  poor  road  conditions  and  lack  of \npaved  road  access,  and  slow  rail  services  limiting  transportation  of  products  and  access  to \nschools, markets, and medical services. The economic development level measured by GDP per \ncapita  varies  considerably  within  the  project  counties  given  the  isolation  of  the  mountainous \nvillages. The average GDP per capita was CNY12,000 in 2014 across the three poor counties of \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n                                                \n18 Financial analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 ADB. 2005.

For poor households in \nthese counties, the average GDP per capita was CNY5,500. \n \n38. \nProject beneficiaries. The direct beneficiaries include existing rail users and road users, \nincluding women, who may transfer to rail to save on time and transport cost (freight carriers and \nbus  passengers),  while  indirect  beneficiaries  include  general  goods  and  service  providers, \nsuppliers  of  agricultural  products  and  services,  people  engaged  in  marketing  (producers  and \nconsumers), and stakeholder agencies. Ethnic minority people from Qiang, Yi, and Zang groups, \nwho are dependent on agriculture and livestock, are one of the major direct beneficiary groups. \nThe Yi is the overwhelming majority ethnic group (after Han) in the three poorest counties in the \nproject impact area (accounting for 75%\u201391% of the population). \n \nThe  railway  line  has  the  potential  to  benefit  people  in  the  project  area  through \n39. \n(i) employment during construction; (ii) better access to markets, transport, and other services; \nand (iii) integration of the project area with regional trade and commerce. Rural households will \nincrease  and  diversify  agricultural  production  to  more  market-oriented  agriculture  because  of \nexpanded  access to markets  and  the  ability  to move bulk goods,  improving  their quality  of  life \nthanks to better access to goods, services, and social infrastructure at less cost. Travel time will \nbe reduced by half to tourist destinations such as Xichang in Liangshan prefecture. \n \nGender. The railway line will result in (i) greater participation of women in the labor and \n40. \ntourism markets, (ii) a rise in women\u2019s net income and savings, (iii) improved overall family welfare, \nand (iv) greater empowerment of women. Women and other vulnerable groups will benefit from \nrailway  development  through  equal  access  to  local  employment  and  wages.  Expansion  of \nsecondary and tertiary industries will help generate additional jobs for both men and women, close \nto their homes. Since the ADB-financed project is only limited to procurement and installation of \nequipment, the project does not provide opportunities for integration of gender design elements. \nHowever, it is expected that the enhanced railway system will directly benefit people in terms of \nfaster, safer, and affordable transport and indirectly benefit women and girls in accessing new \neconomic opportunities. \n \nE. \n \n41. \nThe project is limited to the procurement of railway safety equipment along the E\u2019Mei\u2013Miyi \nsection  of  the  Chengdu\u2013Kunming  railway  line.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard categories are as follows.24 \n \n42. \nEnvironment,  Involuntary  resettlement  and  Indigenous  peoples  (category  C). \nEnvironmental  impacts  of  the  safety  equipment  installation will  be  limited.  Occupational  health \nand  safety  measures  and  attention  to  solid  waste  management  will  be  incorporated  into  the \nproject  and  will  be  consistent  with  national  laws  and  regulations.  No  adverse  involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous peoples impacts are foreseen from the implementation of the project. \n \n43. \nThe due diligence done by the government for the E\u2019Mei\u2013Miyi section of the railway was \nreviewed. The review confirmed that the railway line construction and environmental management \nplan  is  satisfactory  and  consistent  with  national  requirements  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement.  Safeguards  due  diligence  on  the  E\u2019Mei\u2013Miyi  section  will  continue  during  its \nconstruction. \n \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n24 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nF. \n \n44. \nThe overall risk is assessed to be low. The integrated benefits and impacts are expected \nto  outweigh  the  costs.  The  project  is  formulated  to  minimize  potential  risks.  Sensitivity  tests \nindicate  that  economic  circumstances  would  have  to  worsen  substantially  for  the  investment \nprogram  to  lose  its  economic viability.  A  potential  risk  is  delay  in implementation,  which would \ndelay the realization of benefits. The CRC has successfully implemented ADB-financed projects. \nRisks  associated  with  potential  changes  in  government  policy  are  minimal.  An  analysis  of  the \ndemand for railway transport shows that the southwestern PRC needs additional railway transport \ncapacity to sustain its economic development. The equipment and materials to be procured and \nincluded in this project are based on proven and most suitable international designs. The CRC \nhas experience in installing new technologies successfully, and these can be implemented within \na relatively short time. Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and \ndescribed in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.25 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nGeological  phenomenon  contributes \nto unforeseen safety hazards \nProject implementation delay \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe project is implementing advanced detection and monitoring technologies \nwhich will enable the mitigation of this risk. \nDesign and preliminary technical specifications of the equipment have been \nreviewed, and preparation of bid documents will be closely monitored. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \nThe government and the CRC have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \n45. \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents.  \n \n46. \nwhich are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \n \n\nThe government and the CRC have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n47. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$180,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Mountain Railway Safety Enhancement \nProject, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof  25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  7  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented \nto the Board. \n \n \n\n27 July 2017 \n\n                                                \n25 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \n\n \n\nImpact the Project is Aligned With \n \nSafe, reliable, and efficient rail transport system in southwestern People\u2019s Republic of China developed \n(Railway Development Plan, Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20122020).a \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPerformance Indicators with \nTargets and Baselines \n\n \nBy 2025: \na.
