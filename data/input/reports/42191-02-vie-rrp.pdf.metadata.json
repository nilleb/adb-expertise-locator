A review of its environmental implications indicates that \nseveral policy actions covered by the subprogram are likely to have a \npositive  environmental  impact.  Enhancement  measures  have  been \ndeveloped  to  optimize  these  positive  impacts.  No  action  has  been \nidentified as likely to have an adverse environmental impact. \n \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved SIPRP V, a program \ncluster  consisting  of \nits \nsubprogram  1  in  December  2008.  SIPRP  V  is  intended  to  help  the \nGovernment of Viet Nam carry out policy reforms that are needed for \nthe  successful  implementation  of  its  Socioeconomic  Development \nPlan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010. To this end, SIPRP V is to provide parallel \nfinancing  with  the  World  Bank\u2019s  poverty  reduction  support  credits \n(PRSCs)  7\u20139  within \nthe  PRSC  process. \nSubprogram 1 provided parallel financing with PRSC 7. \n \nSubprogram 2 will provide parallel financing with PRSC 8, covering a \nsubset  of  actions  included  in the  policy  matrix for  PRSC  8.  Like the \nthe  actions  under \npolicy  actions  covered  by  subprogram  1, \nsubprogram  2  fall  into  the  four  broad  reform  areas:  business \ndevelopment,  social  inclusion,  natural  resource  management,  and \ngovernance.  They  complement  actions  supported  by  ADB's  other \nprogram  loans  to  Viet  Nam  or  are  otherwise  important  to  ADB's \noperations in the country. Most of them were on the combined list of \ntentative  actions  under  subprograms  2  and  3  in  the  original  policy \n\nthree  subprograms,  and  a \n\nframework  of \n\nloan \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nDisbursement \n\n \n\n \n\nmatrix of SIPRP V. ADB staff took part in the consultations on these \nactions,  which  the  Government  and  the  development  agencies \nparticipating in the PRSC process held between December 2008 and \nMay  2009.  All  of  the  actions  have  been  completed,  although  two  of \nthem have not been carried out exactly as envisaged. \n \nThe  impact  and  the  outcome  of  the  proposed  subprogram  are  the \nsame  as  those  of  SIPRP  V.  The  intended  impact  of  SIPRP  V  is  a \ncontinued  reduction  in  poverty  in  Viet  Nam  in  2008\u20132010  and \nbeyond.  Its  expected  outcome  is  the  successful  implementation  of \nthe  Government\u2019s  SEDP  2006\u20132010,  which  will  not  only  reduce \npoverty  in  2006\u20132010  but  also  improve  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economic \ncompetitiveness  and  strengthen  the  foundations  for  inclusive  and \nsustainable  growth  and  a  continued  reduction  in  poverty  beyond \n2010. \n \nSome  of  the  policy  actions  covered  by  subprogram  2  of  SIPRP  V \nentail substantial costs to Viet Nam\u2019s state budget. The total cost to \nthe  state  budget  in  2009\u20132011  of  the  actions  included  in  the  policy \nmatrix for PRSC 8 is estimated at $680 million.  \n \nThe  World  Bank  has  already  approved  PRSC  8  amounting  to \n$350 million  from  the  International  Development  Association.  Other \ndevelopment  agencies  participating  in  the  PRSC  process  (including \nADB)  are  expected  to  provide  grants  or  concessional  loans  totaling \nabout $250 million in cofinancing or parallel financing with PRSC 8. \nThe  remaining  costs  to  the  budget  of  the  actions  included  in  the \npolicy matrix for PRSC 8 will be covered by the Government. \n \nIt  is  proposed  that  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR64,036,000  be  provided  for  subprogram  2  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds resources. The loan will have a term of 24 years, including a \ngrace  period  of  8  years;  an  annual  interest  rate  of  1.0%  during  the \ngrace  period  and  1.5%  during  the  amortization  period;  and  other \nterms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  Loan  Agreement.  The  loan \nproceeds  may  be  used  to  finance  eligible  imports  incurred  within \n180 days before the date of loan effectiveness.  \n \nThe  State  Bank  of  Viet  Nam  (SBV)  is  the  Executing  Agency  for \nSIPRP V. As such, it will be the Executing Agency for the proposed \nsubprogram. \n \nThe  proposed  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  a  single  tranche  upon  the \ndeclaration of loan effectiveness.  \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of \nViet Nam  as  the  Borrower  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of \nADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans (1998).  \n \n\n\fProcurement \n\nPeriod of Utilization \n \nSubprogram Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \nAssumptions and \nRisks \n\n \n\n \n\niii \n\nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used to finance the full foreign  exchange \ncosts  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and \nprocured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and \nimports  financed  from  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  No \nsupporting  import  documentation  will  be  required  provided  that  the \nvalue  of  Viet Nam\u2019s  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember \ncountries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official \ndevelopment assistance is at least equal to the amount of the loan to \nbe  disbursed.  The  Government  will  certify  its  compliance  with  this \nformula with its withdrawal request. Otherwise, import documentation \nunder existing procedures will be required. ADB will have the right to \naudit  the  use  of  loan  proceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the \nBorrower\u2019s certification. \n \nThe loan will be fully utilized by 31 May 2010. \n \nThe policy reforms that SIPRP V and, in particular, its subprogram 2 \nare intended to advance will yield considerable economic benefits to \nViet Nam and substantial financial benefits to the Government. They \nwill raise the living standards of the Vietnamese people by fostering \nsocially inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic growth. \nThe reforms will also increase budget revenue by expanding the tax \nbase,  and  reduce  budget  expenditure  by  improving  public  financial \nmanagement. Over the medium term, the financial benefits of these \nreforms to the Government are likely to exceed their costs (including \ninterest  to  be  paid  on  loans  received  from  various  development \nagencies within the framework of the PRSC process). \n \nSIPRP  V  and,  in  particular,  its  subprogram  2  are  to  support  policy \nactions  that  are  critical  steps  in  the  policy  reforms  needed  for  the \nsuccessful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 and are important to \nADB\u2019s operations in Viet Nam. However, the reforms need to be fully \ncarried  out  if  SEDP  2006\u20132010  is  to  be  successfully  implemented. \nTherefore,  it  is  assumed  that,  after  completing  the  policy  actions \ncovered  by  SIPRP  V  and  the  other  actions  included  in  the  policy \nmatrices  for  the  World  Bank\u2019s  PRSCs  7\u20139,  the  Government  will \nfollow  through  with  the  policy  reforms  needed  for  the  successful \nimplementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 on its own or with the support of \ndevelopment  agencies  under  other  projects.  It  is  further  assumed \nthat  the  investment  projects  that  are  included  in  SEDP  2006\u20132010 \nand necessary for attaining its targets and goals will be implemented \non schedule.  \n \nThese  assumptions  are based  on  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to \ncarry  out  the  policy  reforms  and  implement  the  investment  projects \nthat  are  needed  to  achieve  the  targets  and  goals  of  SEDP  2006\u2013\n2010. Furthermore, policy reforms that are needed for the successful \nimplementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 are now or will be supported by \nADB  through  other  policy-based  loans  to  Viet  Nam,  and  by  other \ndevelopment  agencies  within  and  outside  the  framework  of  the \nPRSC process. \n\n\fThe slowdown of growth caused by the global economic crisis could \nbe so prolonged that it will preclude the successful implementation of \nSEDP  2006\u20132010  and,  in  particular,  the  achievement  of  its  target \nrelated  to  the  poverty  rate.  However,  this  risk  is  small.  The  fiscal \nstimulus  measures  adopted  by  the  Government  in  January\u2013May \n2009 are expected to spur growth in the second half of 2009 and in \n2010.  Moreover,  the  external  environment  is  expected  to  improve \nsignificantly  in  2010.  Accordingly,  growth  is  likely  to  rebound  in  the \nsecond half of 2009 and accelerate further in 2010. \n \nAs  economic  growth  accelerates  and  world  commodity  prices  rise, \ninflation  could  surge  again.  High \ninflation  could  push  many \nhouseholds into poverty and preclude the successful implementation \nof  SEDP  2006\u20132010.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  the  SBV  has  started \ntaking  measures  to  keep  inflation  in  check.  In  particular,  it  has \ncommitted  to  limit  growth  of  money  supply  to  30%  in  2009;  asked \nstate-owned  commercial  banks  to  limit  loan growth  to  25%  in  2009; \nand  urged  all  commercial  banks  to  tighten  credit  for  consumer \nspending  and  purchases  of  real  estate  and  stocks.  The  SBV  is \nexpected to start tightening monetary policy toward the end of 2009 \nand pursue moderately tight monetary policy in 2010. \n \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for subprogram 2 of the Support for the Implementation of \nthe Poverty Reduction Program (SIPRP) V. The updated design and monitoring framework for \nSIPRP V is in Appendix 1. \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\n2. \nViet  Nam's  economy  expanded  rapidly  in  the  past  2  decades.  Real  gross  domestic \nproduct  (GDP)  grew  at  the  average  annual  rate  of  7.4%  in  1988\u20132007.  Following  a  modest \nslowdown  in  1998\u20131999  caused  by  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  growth  of  real  GDP  accelerated \nalmost steadily during 2000\u20132007, from 4.8% in 1999 to 8.5% in 2007.  \n \n3. \nHowever,  the  country  has  been  experiencing  severe  macroeconomic  difficulties  since \n2008.  Inflation  and  the  trade  deficit  surged  in  the  first  half  of  2008.  The  macroeconomic \nimbalances,  which  built  up  for  several  years  and  manifested  themselves  in  inflation  pressures \nand persistent trade deficits, were exacerbated by domestic supply-side shocks (such as poultry \nepidemics).  The  rise  in  world  commodity  prices  contributed  to  the  surge  in  inflation.  The \nGovernment responded by tightening monetary and fiscal policies and adopting other measures \nto stabilize the macroeconomic situation.  \n \n4. \nIn  the  second  half  of  2008,  inflation  fell  sharply  and  the  trade  deficit  narrowed,  in  part \nbecause of the stabilization measures of the Government in the first half of the year. The drop in \nworld commodity prices helped bring inflation down. At the same time, economic activity slowed \nmarkedly,  as  external  demand  weakened  substantially.  In  response,  the  Government  started \nloosening  monetary  and  fiscal  policies.  Still,  growth  of  real  GDP  decelerated  to  6.2%  in  2008 \nfrom more than 8.0% in the preceding 3 years (Table 1). \n \n5. \nIn  2008,  the  global  economic  crisis  slowed  the  growth  of  Viet  Nam's  exports  and \ncontributed to the decrease in portfolio investment inflows. It has had additional adverse impacts \non  Viet  Nam  in  2009.  In  particular,  the  crisis  has  further  crimped  exports.  It  has  also  reduced \nrevenue  from  international  tourism  and  inflows  of  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI).  Exports \ndecreased  by  10.2%,  the  number  of  international  tourist  arrivals  fell  by  22.1%,  and  gross  FDI \ninflows declined by 22.5% in January\u2013June 2009 compared with the same period a year earlier. \nAccordingly, year-on-year growth of real GDP slowed to 3.9% in the first half of 2009, from 6.5% \nin  the  first  half  of  2008.  With  GDP  most  likely  falling  below  its  potential  level,  year-on-year \ninflation eased to 2.0% in August 2009 from 28.3% in August 2008. \n \nThe Government has adopted a range of measures to mitigate the adverse impact of the \n6. \nglobal  economic  crisis  on  growth  and  poverty  in  Viet  Nam.  These  measures  include  one-off \nadditional financial assistance to poor households, housing support for the poor, and provision \nof interest-free short-term loans to firms that have had to shed at least 30% of their staff and are \nexperiencing  difficulties  in  paying  wages  of  the  remaining  staff.  Furthermore,  the  Government \nhas increased the budgetary allocation for the existing social assistance programs, such as the \nprogram for poverty reduction in ethnic minority and mountainous areas (so-called Program 135) \nand  the  health  insurance  program  for  the  poor  and  near-poor.  It  has  also  expedited  the \nformulation  and  approval  of  the  program  for  accelerated  poverty  reduction  in  the  61  poorest \ndistricts. In the central Government budget for 2009, $935 million has been allocated to social \nsafety nets, compared with $518 million spent on social safety nets from this budget in 2008. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTable 1: Country Economic Indicators  \n\nItem \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1,052  \u2014 \n\nB.

According \nto  the  most  recent  available  household  survey  data,  the  poverty  rate  (based  on  the  cost  of  a \nconsumption basket allowing for a daily intake of 2,100 calories per person and some nonfood \nexpenditure)  dropped  from  58.1%  in  1993  to  16.0%  in  2006.1 The  food  poverty  rate  fell  from \n24.9% to 6.7% over the same period, while the poverty gap narrowed from 18.5% to 3.8%.2  \n \nMeasures  of  poverty  not  based  on  household  survey  data  point  to  declines  of  similar \n8. \nmagnitudes in poverty, although they give different levels of poverty. In particular, the proportion \nof  people  living  on  less  than  $1.0  per  day  based  on  purchasing  power  parity  (PPP)  dropped \nfrom  50.8%  of  the  population  in  1990  to  4.0%  in  2007,  and  the  proportion  living  on  less  than \n$2.0  per  day  based  on  PPP  fell  from  87.0%  to  32.9%. 3  The  poverty  rate  based  on  the \nmethodology  of  the  Ministry  of  Labor,  Invalids  and  Social  Affairs  (MOLISA)  fell  from  20.2%  in \n2005 to an estimated 13.1% in 2008.4  \n \nA  combination  of  strong  economic  growth  and  more  efficient  social  protection  enabled \n9. \nViet Nam to make such great strides in poverty reduction.5 Economic growth created new jobs, \nraised  incomes,  and  lifted  millions  of  people  out  of  poverty.  However,  growth  alone  would  not \nhave enabled Viet Nam to reduce poverty as much as it has done. Many of those who did not \nbenefit directly from economic growth (often for reasons beyond their control) were lifted out of \npoverty  or  prevented  from  falling  into  poverty  because  more  resources  became  available  for \nsocial  protection  (thanks  to  the  strong  economic  growth)  and  social  protection  became \nsignificantly more efficient.  \n\n2. \n\nPoverty Reduction Support Credit Process \n\nThe  main  reason  why  Viet  Nam  was  able  to  sustain  rapid  economic  growth  for  a  long \n10. \ntime  and  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  social  protection  significantly  is  that,  since  1986,  the \ncountry  has  carried  out  a  broad  range  of  policy  reforms  fostering  sustainable  and  inclusive \neconomic growth and making social protection more targeted. In particular, Viet Nam has been \nundertaking  a  gradual  transition  from  a  command  to  a  market  economy,  and  from  a  social \nprotection  system  that  relies  heavily  on  price  subsidies  to  a  system  based  on  targeted \nprograms.  It  has  also  continually  strengthened  natural  resource  management  and  improved \ngovernance. Since 2002, more and more multilateral and bilateral development agencies have \nsupported  these  reforms  through  the  poverty  reduction  support  credit  (PRSC)  process  led  by \nthe World Bank.  \n                                                \n1  World  Bank.  2007.  Vietnam  Development  Report  2008:  Social  Protection.  Joint  donor  report  to  the  Vietnam \n\nConsultative Group Meeting, Hanoi, 6\u20137 December 2007. \n\n2  The food poverty rate is the proportion of people whose total expenditure would not be enough for a daily intake of \n2,100 calories even if it were entirely allocated to food. The poverty gap is the difference between the poverty line \nand the average expenditure of the poor expressed as a percentage of the former. \n\n3   World Bank. 2008. East Asia: Testing Times Ahead. Washington, DC. \n4  The poverty rate based on the methodology of MOLISA measures the proportion of people living below the official \npoverty  line,  which  is  D260,000  per  person  in urban areas  and  D200,000 per  person  in rural  areas.  Households \nbelow  the  poverty  line  are  identified  by  local  officials  of  MOLISA  through  a  combination  of  their  personal \nknowledge, survey techniques, and village discussions.  \n\n5   Although economic growth slowed in 2008, it was still faster than that in many other countries around the world. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n11. \nThe  PRSC  process  comprises  several  closely  related  activities  jointly  undertaken  each \nyear by participating development agencies to help the Government carry out the policy reforms \nneeded  for  the  successful  implementation  of  its  poverty  reduction  strategy.  The  process \ninvolves  the  preparation  of  Viet  Nam  development  reports  by  participating  agencies, \nconsultations on the policy matrices for the World Bank\u2019s PRSCs among participating agencies \nand between these agencies and the Government, and general budget support (in the form of \ngrants  and  concessional  loans)  to  Viet  Nam  by  participating  agencies  to  cover  some  of  the \nadjustment  costs  of  the  policy  reforms  to  the  budget.  The  World  Bank  coordinates  PRSC \nactivities for the participating development agencies. \n  \n12.  While the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy largely determines its reform agenda, \nthe  Viet  Nam  development  reports  translate  this  agenda  into  policy  actions.  Because  a \nsustained  reduction  in  poverty  requires  continued  and  balanced  progress  on  a  wide  range  of \npolicy reforms, the Government has an extensive reform agenda and the Viet Nam development \nreports specify numerous policy actions in many different areas.  \n \n13. \nSome  of  these  actions  are  included  in  the  policy  matrices  for  PRSCs.  During  the  year \nbefore the World Bank is expected to approve a particular PRSC, the participating development \nagencies agree among themselves and with the Government on the initial policy matrix for the \nPRSC. At the start of the year in which the World Bank is to approve the PRSC, the agencies \nhold  joint  consultations  with  the  Government  on  individual  policy  actions  included  in  the  initial \nmatrix.  When  the  World  Bank  undertakes  the  appraisal  and  the  negotiations  for  the  PRSC \n(usually in May of the year when the PRSC is expected to be approved), the agencies and the \nGovernment agree on the final policy matrix for that PRSC. Some actions that were included in \nthe  initial  policy  matrix  are  modified  or  dropped  at  this  stage,  based  on  their  status  and \nlikelihood of being completed before the World Bank\u2019s executive board deliberates on the PRSC.  \n \nActions in all key reform areas are usually included in the policy matrices for PRSCs to \n14. \nhelp  the  Government make  balanced  progress  in  reforms  across  various  areas  and fully  carry \nout its reform agenda. Therefore, the policy matrices for PRSCs tend to be broad in scope and \nto closely match the Government\u2019s reform agenda. This makes the PRSC process attractive to \nmany  development  agencies  (focusing  on  different  areas  of  policy  reforms)  and  contributes  to \nthe strong government ownership of the actions included in the policy matrices for PRSCs.  \n \n15. \nAt the same time, the good-practice principle of criticality in development policy lending \nguides the selection of policy actions within a particular reform area. According to this principle, \nonly those actions that are critical to the achievement of results should be made conditions for \ndisbursement.6 Therefore,  the  policy  matrices  for  PRSCs  include  only  those  actions  that  the \nparticipating  development  agencies  and  the  Government  consider  to  be  critical  steps  in  the \nreform  process  in  the  area  concerned,  and  for  which  the  Government  needs  the  combined \nsupport  of  many  development  agencies.  The  Government  follows  through  with  the  reform \nprocess  on  its  own  or  with  the  support  of  development  agencies  under  other  projects.  This \napproach  helps  keep  the  policy  matrices  for  PRSCs  manageable  despite  their  broad  scope. \nHowever, it also limits the continuity of actions included in the policy matrices for various PRSCs. \n \n16. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  joined  the  PRSC  process  in  2003  and  has  taken \npart  in  most  PRSC  activities  since  then.  In  2004,  ADB  approved  SIPRP  I,  a  single-tranche \nstandard program loan of $6.4 million. SIPRP I provided parallel financing with the World Bank\u2019s \n\n                                                \n6  World Bank. 2005.

SIPRP  II  ($15 million)  was  approved  in \n2005 and provided parallel financing with PRSC 4. SIPRP III ($15 million) was approved in 2006 \nand provided parallel financing with PRSC 5. Like SIPRP I, SIPRP II and SIPRP III were single-\ntranche  standard  program  loans,  which  supported  the  implementation  of CPRGS  2002\u20132006.7 \nWith  support  from  ADB,  the World  Bank,  and  other  development  agencies  through  the  PRSC \nprocess,  the  policy  reforms  needed  for  the  successful  implementation  of  CPRGS  2002\u20132006 \nwere carried out and most of the CPRGS goals were achieved.8 \n\n3. \n\nSocioeconomic Development Plan 2006\u20132010 \n\n17. \nThe Government adopted the Socioeconomic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010 in \n2006.  Unlike  previous  SEDPs,  SEDP  2006\u20132010  was  prepared  in  an  open  and  participatory \nmanner  involving  extensive  consultations  with  civil  society,  businesses,  and  development \nagencies.  It  is  oriented  more  toward  attaining  development  outcomes  (including  poverty \nreduction) and less toward achieving production targets. One of its main targets is to reduce the \npoverty  rate  (based  on  MOLISA\u2019s  methodology)  from  20.2%  in  2005  to  10%\u201311%  in  2010. \nSEDP  2006\u20132010  also  aspires  to  strengthen  the  foundations  for  environmentally  sustainable \nand  socially  inclusive  economic  growth,  and  a  continued  reduction  in  poverty  beyond  2010.  It \nprovides for a broad range of policy reforms and a large number of investment projects aimed at \nachieving  its  targets  and  goals.  The  joint  International  Development  Association\u2013International \nMonetary  Fund  staff  advisory  note  of  5 December 2006  on  Viet  Nam\u2019s  poverty  reduction \nstrategy concluded that SEDP 2006\u20132010 has the key features of a poverty reduction strategy \nand is likely to lead to economic growth and poverty reduction.9 \n \n18. \nSince  late  2006,  the  PRSC  process  has  supported  the  policy  reforms  needed  for  the \nsuccessful  implementation  of  SEDP  2006\u20132010.  In  2007,  about  a  dozen  multilateral  and \nbilateral  development  agencies,  including  ADB,  provided  general  budget  support  to  Viet  Nam \nwithin the framework of the PRSC process to help the Government keep these reforms on track \nin  2007.  ADB  approved  SIPRP  IV  (another  single-tranche  standard  program  loan  for  $15 \nmillion) for this purpose in October 2007.  \n\n                                                \n7   SIPRP  I\u2013III  are  all  rated  as  successful  in  the  respective  program  completion  reports  (ADB.  2006.

First, the absolute number of poor people is still large, \nalthough their share in the total population has dropped drastically. According to the household \nsurvey data, 13.5 million people lived in poverty and 5.7 million people suffered from hunger in \n2006. The poverty rate based on MOLISA's methodology suggests that 11.3 million people lived \nbelow the official poverty line in 2008. \n \n20. \nSecond, the incidence of poverty is still high in rural areas and among ethnic minorities, \nalthough  it  has  been  decreasing  faster  than  in  urban  areas  and  among  the  ethnic  majority.  In \n2006,  the  poverty  rate  was  20.4%  in  rural  areas  (compared  with  3.9%  in  urban  areas)  and \n52.2%  among  ethnic  minorities  (compared  with  10.2%  among  the  Kinh  and  Chinese  majority) \n(footnote  1).  Rural  areas  accounted  for  73.3%  of  the  total  population  but  93.6%  of  the  poor. \nEthnic minorities made up 13.5% of the total population but 44.4% of the poor.10 \n \n21. \nThird, the rural poor and poor ethnic minority people not only account for relatively large \nproportions  of  their  respective  population  groups,  but  also  have  significantly  lower  average \nincomes than the urban poor and poor ethnic majority people, respectively. In 2006, the poverty \ngap was 4.9% in the rural areas and 15.4% among ethnic minorities, compared with 3.2% in the \nurban areas and 2.0% among the Kinh and Chinese majority (footnote 1). \n \nFourth,  the  incidence  of  poverty  varies  significantly  across  regions.  It  is  low  in  the \n22. \nSoutheast, Red River Delta, Mekong Delta, and South Central Coast, but high in the Northern \nMountains (especially the Northwest Mountains), North Central Coast, and Central Highlands. In \n2006,  the  poverty  rate  was  30.2%  in  the  Northern  Mountains  (49.0%  in  the  Northwest \nMountains), 29.1% in the North Central Coast, and 28.6% in the Central Highlands, compared \nwith 5.8% in the Southeast and 8.8% in the Red River Delta (footnote 1). \n \n23. \nFifth,  the  vulnerability  of  the  population  to  poverty  is  rather  high.  The  large  difference \nbetween the proportion of the population living on less than $2.0 per day based on PPP (32.9% \nin 2007) and the share of those living on less than $1.0 per day based on PPP (4.0% in 2007) \nsuggests  that  the  near-poor  account  for  a  substantial  proportion  of  the  population.  A  small \nexternal  or  internal  shock  and  a  moderate  deterioration  in  the  economic  situation  can  push \nmany of these people into poverty. \n \n24. \nFinally, some negative trends in poverty have emerged recently. The household survey \ndata  show  that  urban  poverty  increased  between  2004  and  2006.  The  poverty  rate  rose  from \n3.6%  in  2004  to  3.9%  in  2006,  while  the  food  poverty  rate  increased  from  0.8%  to  1.2% \n(footnote 1). Anecdotal evidence suggests that high inflation and, in particular, the steep rise of \nfood  prices  pushed  many  low-income  households,  especially  in  urban  areas,  into  poverty  in \n2008.  As  economic  activity  slowed  sharply,  unemployment  and  underemployment  increased \nand more households, particularly in rural areas, fell into poverty in the first several months of \n2009. Many people from rural areas who were employed in urban areas of Viet Nam or abroad \n\n                                                \n10 World  Bank.  2008.

These reforms \nwill help Viet Nam limit the adverse impact of the global economic crisis on growth, employment, \nand poverty and quickly resume rapid economic growth and poverty reduction.  \n \n26. \nHowever, some of these reforms, such as restructuring state-owned enterprises (SOEs) \nand reforming the health care and education systems, are complex. Moreover, their costs to the \neconomy  as  a  whole  and to  the  state  budget  in particular  are  likely  to  exceed their  benefits  in \nthe short term. Therefore, they are likely to put a considerable burden on the state budget in the \nshort  term  and  result  in  net  losses  for  some  economic  actors  even  over  the  long  term. \nConsequently, potential losers are likely to resist some of these reforms.  \n \n27. \nStrong  support  from  development  partners,  through  the  PRSC  process,  can  help  the \nGovernment  carry  out  these  reforms.  In  2006,  under  the  auspices  of  the  Network  on \nDevelopment  Evaluation  of  the  Development  Assistance  Committee  of  the  Organization  for \nEconomic  Co-operation  and  Development,  several  development  agencies  and  governments \ncommissioned an evaluation study of partnership general budget support (PGBS) operations in \nseven developing countries, including Viet Nam. The study looked into the relevance, efficiency, \nand  effectiveness  of  PGBS  (involving  several  development  agencies  and  the  government).  It \nfound  that  the  PRSC  process  in  Viet  Nam  is  an  efficient,  effective,  and  sustainable  way  of \nsupporting  national  poverty  reduction  strategies.  PGBS  can  significantly  affect  policies  and \npolicy  processes  through  financial  empowerment,  stronger  incentives  within  government,  and \nbetter coherence and coordination among international partners. In the countries covered by the \nstudy,  PGBS  has  reinforced  collaboration  between  governments  and  development  agencies, \nand has improved harmonization of official development assistance. It has helped make public \nincreased  pro-poor  public \nfinance  management  more  comprehensive  and \nexpenditures, and resulted in large savings to the government in transaction costs. The PRSC \nprocess  in  Viet  Nam  has  had  a  strong  positive  impact  on  policy  reforms.  It  is  an  example  of \nsuccessful  government\u2013donor  collaboration,  of  learning  from  experience,  and  of  objectives \nmet.12  \n \n28. \nIndeed,  the  PRSC  process  has  been  a  driving  force  of  policy  reforms  in  Viet Nam  in \nrecent  years.  The  Government  has  used  the  involvement  of  a  large  number  of  development \nagencies (including ADB) in the process to overcome domestic resistance to policy reforms. To \n\ntransparent, \n\n                                                \n11 Reliable statistical evidence on the impact on poverty of high inflation in 2008 and economic slowdown in the first \nhalf of 2009 is not available yet. The most recent Viet Nam Household Living Standards Survey was conducted in \n2008, and the data it has generated are being processed. \n\n12 The  study  also  points  out  several  shortcomings  of  the  PRSC  process  in  Viet  Nam  (some  of  which  were  fully  or \npartly  eliminated  after  the  study  was  conducted).  Among  them  are  inadequate  attention  to  cross-cutting  issues, \nsuch as gender; weaknesses of the monitoring and evaluation framework; limited ex-post impact analysis; and the \nlarge number of the participating development agencies, which makes the coordination of the process more difficult \nand  hinders  its  cohesion  (International  Development  Department  and  Associates.  2006.

Birmingham: University of Birmingham.  \nhttp://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/25/43/37426676.pdf) \n\n \n\n \n\n\fdeal  with  such  resistance,  government  agencies  advocating  certain  reforms  have  often \nproposed the inclusion of these measures in the policy matrices for the PRSCs.  \n \n29. \nAccording to the World Bank\u2019s report on the implementation and results of PRSCs 1\u20135, \nthe  first  phase  of  the  PRSC  process  in  Viet  Nam  (which  supported  the  implementation  of \nCPRGS 2002\u20132006) contributed to the significant achievements by the country in its transition \nto  a  market  economy,  social  inclusion,  and  the  building  of  modern  governance.  The  PRSC \nprocess  had  a  direct  influence  on  the  adoption  of  policy  actions  that  were  conducive  to  faster \neconomic growth  and  poverty  reduction,  and  helped  spread market mechanisms,  create  wage \nemployment,  and  improve  the  delivery  of  public  services.  The  annual  PRSC  cycle  with  tight \ndeadlines  increased  incentives  to  complete  key  policy  actions  on  time.  In  addition,  the  PRSC \nprocess helped the Government strengthen its capacity to conduct cross-sector policy dialogue \nand deliver results on time. Consultations with a large number of development agencies within \nthe framework of the PRSC process showed the Government the benefits of an open dialogue \non key issues, and made it more receptive to sharing its draft documents at an early stage and \neliciting feedback from the stakeholders.13 \n \n30. \nStakeholder consultations that were held in 2006 as part of an independent evaluation of \nthe first phase of the PRSC process found that the process was beneficial to policy reforms in \nViet  Nam.  Both  the  Government  and  the  participating  development  agencies  emphasized  that \nthe  policy  dialogue  within  the  framework  of  the  PRSC  process  was  a  major  benefit  of  the \nprocess. The Government valued the ideas offered by the development agencies on the design \nand  implementation  of  policy  reforms,  while  the  development  agencies  gained  a  broader \nunderstanding  of  the  direction  of  the  reform  process  and  government  thinking.  Other  PRSC \nbenefits  stemmed  not  only  from  improving  the  quality  of  policies,  but  also  from  locking  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s commitment to specific reforms and speeding up their implementation.14 \n\nIV. \n\nSUPPORT FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE POVERTY REDUCTION \n\nPROGRAM V \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n31. \nADB  approved  SIPRP  V,  a  program  cluster  consisting  of  three  subprograms,  and  a \nsingle-tranche loan (about $25 million) for its subprogram 1 in December 2008.15 The intended \nimpact of SIPRP V is a continued reduction in poverty in Viet Nam in 2008\u20132010 and beyond. \nIts expected outcome is the successful implementation of the Government\u2019s SEDP 2006\u20132010, \nwhich  will  not  only  reduce  poverty  in  2006\u20132010,  but  also  enhance  Viet  Nam's  economic \ncompetitiveness  and  strengthen  the  foundations  for  inclusive  and  sustainable  growth  and  a \ncontinued reduction in poverty beyond 2010. To achieve this outcome, SIPRP V is to help the \nGovernment  carry  out  policy  reforms  that  are  needed  for  the  successful  implementation  of \nSEDP  2006\u20132010.  Specifically,  SIPRP  V  is  to  support\u2014through  the  PRSC  process\u2014policy \nactions that are critical steps in carrying out the reforms and are important to ADB\u2019s operations \nin Viet Nam. \n\n                                                \n13 World Bank. 2007.

Manila. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\n \n\n \n32. \n \n\nThe policy actions supported by SIPRP V fall into the following four broad reform areas: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nImproving \n\nBusiness  development. \nfinancial  management  and  corporate \ngovernance of SOEs, developing the financial and private sectors, and improving \nthe quality of infrastructure services. \nSocial inclusion. Improving the quality of health care and education, and access \nto these services.  \nNatural  resource  management.  Strengthening  the  management  of  water \nresources and the protection of the environment.  \nGovernance.  Improving  planning  processes,  strengthening  public  financial \nmanagement and pubic administration, and reducing corruption.16  \n\n \n33. \nThese  reforms  closely  match  the  priorities  of  ADB's  country  strategy  and  program, \n2007\u20132010  for  Viet  Nam.  The  primary  focus  of  the  country  strategy  and  program  is  on \npromoting  business-led, pro-poor  economic growth  by  developing  infrastructure,  improving  the \nbusiness  environment,  strengthening  financial  and  related  market  institutions,  and  building  up \nhuman  capital.  The  country  strategy  and  program  also  aims  to  foster  social  inclusiveness, \nenhance management of the environment, and improve governance.17  \n\nB. \n\nImportant Features \n\n34. \nSIPRP V follows the program-based approach and is, in some respects, a continuation \nof  SIPRPs  I\u2013IV.  It  is  to  provide  parallel  financing  with  the  World  Bank\u2019s  PRSCs  within  the \nframework of the PRSC process. Like SIPRP IV, it is intended to help the Government carry out \npolicy reforms needed for the successful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010.  \n \nUnlike  SIPRPs  I\u2013IV,  SIPRP  V  takes  the  program  cluster  approach.  It  consists  of  three \n35. \nchronologically  ordered  subprograms.  Subprogram  1  provided  parallel  financing  with  PRSC  7, \nsubprogram  2  is  to  provide  parallel  financing  with  PRSC  8,  and  subprogram  3  is  to  provide \nparallel financing with PRSC 9. The outputs, outcome, impact, and performance indicators and \ntargets of SIPRP V are the same for all its subprograms. \n \n36. \nIndividual  subprograms  of  SIPRP  V  can  only  cover  actions  included  in  the  policy \nmatrices  of  the  corresponding  PRSCs.  Moreover,  they  are  to  focus  on  those  actions  in  the \npolicy  matrices  for  PRSCs  7\u20139  that  complement  actions  supported  by  ADB\u2019s  other  program \nloans to Viet Nam or are otherwise important to ADB\u2019s operations in the country.  \n \n37. \nNevertheless,  SIPRP  V  has  a  broad  scope  because  the  policy  matrices  for  PRSCs \ninclude actions in many reform areas. Further, ADB is active in many sectors in Viet Nam, and \npolicy reforms in these sectors often have significant implications for its operations. At the same \ntime,  only  limited  continuity  can  be  expected  in  the  policy  actions  supported  by  various \nsubprograms  of  SIPRP  V  because  of  the  limited  continuity  in  the  policy  matrices  for  different \nPRSCs.  \n \n38. \nSIPRP V is a general intervention aiming to help Viet Nam reduce poverty, but its impact \non  poverty  will  largely  be  indirect.  The  policy  reforms  supported  by  SIPRP  V  will  improve \n\n                                                \n16 Figure  A3.1  in  Appendix  3  shows  graphically  how  the  policy  reforms  supported  by  SIPRP  V  will  contribute  to  its \n\n17 ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program (2007\u20132010): Viet Nam. Manila. \n\noutcome. \n\n \n\n\fgovernance,  develop  businesses,  and  stimulate  economic  growth.  Business  development  and \neconomic growth will create news jobs, raise incomes, and make more resources available for \nsocial  protection.  Poor  and  vulnerable  people  in  both  rural  and  urban  areas,  ethnic  minorities, \nand  poor  regions  will  benefit  from  more  jobs,  higher  incomes,  and  increased  availability  of \nresources  for  social  protection.  The  reforms  supported  by  SIPRP  V  will  also  make  economic \ngrowth  more  socially  inclusive  and  environmentally  sustainable  by  improving  the  quality  of \nhealth care and education and access to these services, and by strengthening the management \nof  natural  resources.  Hence,  SIPRP  V  complements  ADB's  targeted  poverty-reducing \ninterventions in Viet Nam, which seek to reduce poverty in a particular region within the country \nor among ethnic minorities.  \n\nC. \n\nSubprogram 1 and Lessons \n\n39. \nSubprogram  1  of  SIPRP  V  covered  12  of  35  actions  included  in  the  policy  matrix  for \nPRSC 7. All of these actions were completed before ADB approved the loan for the subprogram. \nTherefore,  loan  effectiveness  was  the  only  condition  for  loan  disbursement.  The  loan  became \neffective in April 2009 and was disbursed in May 2009. \n \n40. \nTwo  notable  lessons  emerged from the formulation  and  implementation of  subprogram \n1.  First,  the  policy  reform  process  slows  when  Viet  Nam  faces  macroeconomic  difficulties \nbecause the Government focuses its efforts on overcoming these difficulties and cannot devote \nenough  staff  resources  to  reforms.  The  reform  process  slowed  in  the  first  half  of  2008,  when \ninflation and the trade deficit surged, and the Government's top policy priority became stabilizing \nthe  macroeconomic  situation.  Second,  a  fall  in  stock  prices  causes  delays  in  equitization  of \nSOEs  and  state-owned  commercial  banks  (SOCBs).  While  recognizing  that  equitization  of \nSOEs is essential to improving their corporate governance and efficiency, the Government does \nnot  want  to  sell  their  shares  when  stock  prices  are  low.  These  lessons  were  taken  into \nconsideration when the proposed subprogram was formulated (paras. 52 and 54). \n\nD. \n\nProgress towards Performance Targets \n\nDespite the macroeconomic turbulence and the slowdown in economic growth, Viet Nam \n41. \nmade good overall progress towards the performance targets of SIPRP V in 2008. Due mainly \nto the Government's targeted  interventions, the poverty  rate  based on  MOLISA's  methodology \nfell  from  14.7%  in  2007  to  an  estimated  13.1%  in  2008  (Appendix  4).  Hence,  Viet  Nam  is  on \ntrack to reduce the poverty rate to 10%\u201311% by 2010, which is one of the main targets of SEDP \n2006\u20132010 and one of the two outcome targets of SIPRP V.  \n \n42. \nAt  the  same  time,  the  progress  towards  the  other  outcome  target  of  SIPRP  V\u2014to \nincrease  Viet  Nam's  Global  Competitiveness  Index  score  from  4.04  in  2007\u20132008  to  4.60  in \n2010\u20132011\u2014was  relatively  slow.  The  score  increased  to  4.10  in  2008\u20132009.  Increases  in  the \nsubscores  for  goods  market  efficiency,  financial  markets  sophistication,  infrastructure,  health, \neducation, institutions, and innovation were partly offset by a sharp decrease in the subscore for \nmacroeconomic stability.  \n \n43. \nAs  for  the  SIPRP  V  output  targets  pertaining  to  business  development,  Viet  Nam  has \nachieved the target related to the share of FDI in total investment, and is on track to attain the \ntarget  concerning  the  share  of nonperforming  loans  (NPLs)  in  the  loan portfolio  of  commercial \nbanks (often referred to as the NPL ratio). Despite tight global financial conditions, FDI inflows \nto Viet Nam surged in 2008. As a result, the share of FDI in total investment jumped from 16.0% \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\nin 2007 to 29.8% in 2008, compared with the SIPRP V target of 20% in 2010. FDI inflows are \nlikely to be smaller in 2009 than in 2008 because of the global economic crisis and heightened \nrisk aversion of foreign investors. However, they are expected to rebound in 2010, as the global \nfinancial  conditions  and  investor  sentiment  improve.  Consequently,  the  share  of  FDI  in  total \ninvestment is likely to be higher than 20% in 2010.  \n \n44. \nThe SIPRP V output target for the NPL ratio is that the ratio will not exceed 5% by 2010. \nThe ratio  increased from  1.5%  at  the  end  of  2007  to  2.1%  at the  end  of 2008  because  of the \ndrop  in  stock  prices,  cooling  of  the  real  estate  market,  and  slowdown  in  growth.  The  ratio  is \nlikely  to  increase  further  in  2009  because  of  the  anticipated  further  slowdown  of  growth. \nHowever, it is unlikely to exceed 5% by 2010 in part because growth is expected to rebound in \n2010. \n \n45. \nViet  Nam  completed  the  equitization  of  one  SOCB\u2014Vietcombank\u2014in  2008,  as  part  of \nan  action  included  in  the  policy  matrix  of  PRSC  7  and  covered  by  subprogram  1  of  SIPRP  V. \nFurthermore,  the  Government  approved  equitization  plans  for  two  more  SOCBs\u2014Mekong \nHousing  Bank  and  Vietinbank\u2014in  2008.  Vietinbank  had  an  initial  public  offering  in  December \n2008  and  the  first  general  meeting  of  shareholders  in  June  2009.  As  with  Vietcombank, \nVietinbank's  legal  status  has  been  changed  from  a  fully  state-owned  company  into  a  partially \nstate-owned joint-stock company. The initial public offering of Mekong Housing Bank has been \ndelayed  because  of  unfavorable  market  conditions.  The  equitization  of  many  SOEs  has  been \ndelayed  for  the  same  reason.  Accordingly,  the  progress  towards  the  SIPRP  V  output  targets \npertaining to the number of SOCBs and the share of the private sector in total investment was \nslow in 2008 and the first half of 2009.  \n \n46. \nViet Nam has achieved the social inclusion target related to the mortality rate for children \nunder 5 years old. It is on track to attain the targets concerning the proportion of poor and ethnic \nminority people with health insurance, the number of provinces with universal completed lower \nsecondary  education,  and  the  proportion  of  trained  workers.  However,  the  maternal  mortality \nrate  decreased  only  slightly  and  the  net  primary  education  enrollment  rate  remained  stagnant \nbetween 2007 and 2008.   \n \nViet  Nam  has  achieved  the  natural  resource  management  target  concerning  the \n47. \nproportion of the rural population with access to clean water, and is on track to attain the targets \nrelating  to  the  proportion  of  urban  wastes  that  are  collected.  However,  progress  towards  the \ntarget pertaining to the proportion of urban households with access to clean water was slow in \n2008, and the proportion of hospital waste that was treated decreased between 2007 and 2008.      \n \n48. \nLittle  progress  was  made  towards  the  governance  target  in  2008.  The  non-weighted \naverage  score  of  the  World  Bank's  governance  indicators  for  government  effectiveness, \nregulatory quality, rule of law, and control of corruption in Viet Nam was essentially unchanged \nbetween 2007 and 2008. Higher scores for government effectiveness, rule of law, and control of \ncorruption were offset by a lower score for regulatory quality.  \n\nV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SUBPROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n49. \nA  combined  list  of  tentative  actions  under  subprograms  2  and  3  was  included  in  the \ndesign  and  monitoring  framework  and  the  policy  matrix  of  SIPRP  V  in  the  report  and \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nrecommendation of the President on the program cluster and its subprogram 1. These actions \nwere drawn from the tentative list of policy actions for PRSCs 8\u201310. The report stated that, after \nthe  development  agencies  participating  in  the  PRSC  process  and  the  Government  agreed  on \nthe final policy matrix for PRSC 8, the actions to be covered by subprogram 2 of SIPRP V would \nbe  separated  from  those  to  be  covered  by  subprogram  3.  If  necessary,  the  actions  under \nsubprogram 2 would be adjusted to make them fully consistent with the policy matrix for PRSC \n8.18 \n \nIn  late  2008,  the  development  agencies  participating  in  the  PRSC  process  (including \n50. \nADB)  and  the  Government  agreed  on  the  initial  policy  matrix  for  PRSC  8.    The  policy  actions \nincluded in that matrix can be divided into the following three categories: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nactions  that  were  included  in  the  original  policy  matrix  of  SIPRP  V  as  tentative \nactions under subprograms 2 and 3; \nactions  that  were  not  in  the  original  policy  matrix  of  SIPRP  V  but  within  ADB's \nfocus areas in Viet Nam; and \nactions that were outside ADB's focus areas in Viet Nam.  \n\n(iii) \n \nBetween  December  2008  and  May  2009,  the  development  agencies  and \n\n51. \nthe \nGovernment  held  several  rounds  of  consultations  on  the  actions  included  in  the  initial  policy \nmatrix for PRSC 8. ADB staff took part in the consultations on the actions in the first two of the \nthree categories.  \n \n52. \nIn May 2009, the development agencies and the Government agreed on the final policy \nmatrix for PRSC 8. Some of the actions included in the initial matrix were modified or dropped in \nview of their status and likelihood of being completed before the World Bank's Executive Board \nconsidered PRSC 8 in June 2009. The final matrix includes seven actions in the first category \nand 11 actions in the second category.19 It is arguably less ambitious than the policy matrices of \nprevious  PRSCs. The reason  is  that,  in the  second  half  of 2008  and  the first  half  of 2009, the \nGovernment  focused  on  countering  the  adverse  impacts  of  the  global  economic  crisis  on  Viet \nNam  and  could  not  devote  enough  staff  resources  to  medium-term  policy  reforms.  Therefore, \ndevelopment agencies anticipated the overall process of policy reforms to be relatively slow in \n2009. \n \n53. \nThe  proposed  subprogram  covers  all  seven  actions  in  the first  category  and five  of the \n11 actions in the second category in the final policy matrix of PRSC 8. The actions in the second \ncategory have been selected in consultation with the Government and various units within ADB, \ntaking  into  account  how  much  progress  the  Government  made  in  carrying  them  out  and  how \nimportant they are to ADB's operations in Viet Nam. The purpose is to recognize the substantive \nreforms  that  the  Government  implemented  between  June  2008  and  May  2009  in  consultation \nwith  ADB  and  other  development  agencies  participating  in  the  PRSC  process.  These  reforms \nare within ADB's focus areas in Viet Nam, were not covered by subprogram 1 of SIPRP V, and \nare not supported by ADB's other program loans to Viet Nam.  \n \nThe  subprogram  does  not  include  a  policy  action  on  equitization  of  SOCBs  or  SOEs, \n54. \nalthough  Viet  Nam  made  slow  progress  towards  the  SIPRP  V  targets  on  the  equitization  of \n                                                \n18 ADB.  2008.

Manila (p. 21). \n\n19 A full list of actions included in the final policy matrix of PRSC 8 is in Appendix 5. \n \n\n\f13 \n\nSOCBs and the share of the domestic private sector in total investment in 2008. The reason is \nthat  stock  prices  fell  sharply  in  2008  and  are  expected  to  stay  low  in  2009.  The  Government \ndoes not want to sell shares of SOCBs and SOEs when stock prices are down. It wants to focus \non  restructuring  of  SOEs  with  the  aim  of  improving  their  efficiency  and  selling  their  shares  at \nhigher  prices  when  market conditions  improve. Accordingly, the final  policy  matrix for  PRSC  8 \nincludes an action on financial management of SOEs but no action on equitization of SOCBs or \nSOEs. \n \n55.  Most of the tentative actions under subprograms 2 and 3 in the original policy matrix of \nSIPRP  V  that  have  not  been  included  in  the  policy  matrix  of  PRSC  8  and  are  therefore  not \ncovered  by  subprogram  2  of  SIPRP  V  have  been  retained  as  tentative  actions  under  its \nsubprogram 3. In the second half of 2008 and the first half of 2009, the Government made some \nprogress  in  carrying  out  several  of  these  actions  (e.g.,  transferring  state  ownership  rights  in \nSOEs  to  the  State  Capital  Investment  Corporation,  equitizing  SOCBs,  and  certifying  internal \ncredit  rating  systems  of  commercial  banks).  However,  the  progress  was  not  sufficient  to \nconsider  the  actions  completed.  The  Government  and  development  agencies  are  likely  to \ncontinue  dialogue  on  these  actions  in  conjunction  with  PRSC  9.  Therefore,  they  have  been \nretained as tentative actions under subprogram 3 of SIPRP V. Figure A3.2 in Appendix 3 is the \nupdated policy matrix of SIPRP V. \n \nSome of the tentative actions under subprograms 2 and 3 in the original policy matrix of \n56. \nSIPRP V have been dropped or replaced with other actions in the same reform area. Notably, \nthe  actions  concerning  the  establishment  of  a  national  business  registry  and  the  legal \nframework for the development of small and medium-sized enterprises have been dropped. The \nGovernment made some progress in carrying out these actions in the second half of 2008 and \nthe first half of 2009, but it was not sufficient to regard the actions as completed. They will be \ncovered by the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Program Loan II (included in ADB's \n2009  indicative  pipeline  for  Viet  Nam).  Table  A3.1  in  Appendix  3  shows  the  status  of  each \ntentative  action  under  subprograms  2  and  3  in  the  original  policy  matrix  of  SIPRP  V  and \nindicates why some of them have been dropped or replaced.  \n \n57. \nThe changes in the policy matrix of SIPRP V are not expected to have a major impact on \nits  outcome.  They  slightly  increase  the  likelihood  that  the  SIPRP  V  output  targets  for  natural \nresource management and governance will be achieved. At the same time, they slightly reduce \nthe chances that the SIPRP V output targets related to the number of SOCBs and health will be \nattained. In terms of overall business development, the measures aimed at restructuring SOEs \nwill compensate for the relatively slow progress in their equitization.  \n \n58. \nAll actions covered by the proposed subprogram have been completed, although two of \nthem\u2014action  1.2  (prepare  a  revised  law  on  the  central  bank  focusing  its  mandate  on,  and \nenhancing  its  autonomy  in  regard  to,  monetary  policy  and  financial  sector  stability)  and  action \n4.2  (formulate  a  public  debt  management  law  consolidating  the  management  of  domestic  and \nexternal  debt)\u2014have  not  been  carried  out  exactly  as  envisaged.  The  Government's \nDevelopment Policy Letter is in Appendix 6.  \n\n1. \n\nBusiness Development \n\n59. \nAction  1.1:  Strengthen  financial  management  of  SOEs,  limiting  their  investments \nin other entities, defining the level of such investments.20 Many SOEs invested extensively \n\n                                                \n20 The action is one of the tentative actions under subprograms 2 and 3 in the original policy matrix of SIPRP V. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fthese \n\nissues, \n\nTo  address \n\nin  non-core  businesses,  including  financial  and  real  estate  companies,  in  recent  years.  Their \naggressive  investment  expansion  contributed  to  the  stock  market  bubble  in  2007  and  the \nmacroeconomic  turbulence  in  2008.  Close  links  between  some  SOEs  and  commercial  banks \ncreated  the  risk  that  the  banks'  lending  decisions  would  not  be  guided  solely  by  commercial \nconsiderations. As a result, the allocation of credit could be distorted, the quality of banks' loan \nportfolio could worsen, and the vulnerability of the banking system could increase.  \n \n60. \nthe  Government  has  adopted\u2014through  Decree  No. \n09/2009/ND-CP  dated 5  February  2009\u2014a  new  regulation  on financial management  of SOEs. \nThe  regulation  limits  SOEs'  investments  in  non-core  businesses,  especially  in  the  financial \nsector.  It stipulates  that an  SOE  must  invest  at  least  70%  of  its  capital  and  borrowed funds  in \ncore businesses. Total investments of an SOE in other companies should not exceed its charter \ncapital.  An  SOE  can  only  invest  in  one  company  operating  in  the  banking,  insurance,  or \nsecurities subsectors, and its investment cannot exceed 20% of that company's charter capital. \nIf  an  SOE  and  its  subsidiary  invest  in  the  same  company,  their  combined  investment  cannot \nexceed  30%  of  that  company's  charter  capital.  An  SOE  is  prohibited  from  investing  in  a \ncompany whose senior staff member or major shareholder is related to a senior staff member of \nthe SOE.   \n \n61. \nThis  action  under  subprogram  2  builds  on  action  1.1  under  subprogram  1  (assess  the \nscope  and  nature  of  lending  and  other  transactions  among  affiliated  parties  within  economic \ngroups and general corporations). It provides an impetus to restructure SOEs and complements \nthe reforms that the SOE Reform and Corporate Governance Facility, a program loan in ADB\u2019s \n2009 indicative pipeline for Viet Nam, is intended to support.  \n \n62. \nAction 1.2: Prepare a revised law on the central bank focusing its mandate on, and \nenhancing  its  autonomy  in  regard  to,  monetary  policy  and  financial  sector  stability \n(footnote 20). The current Law on the State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV), the country's central bank, \nassigns the SBV numerous tasks, including those not usually performed by a central bank (such \nas  regulating  the  gold  market).  At  the  same  time,  it  gives  the  SBV  limited  autonomy  in \nformulating monetary policy. The law assigns an important role in monetary policy formulation to \nthe Advisory Board on National Monetary Policy, chaired by one of the deputy prime ministers. \nFurthermore,  the  law  sets  multiple  (potentially  conflicting)  goals  for  monetary  policy  without \nprioritization.  These  goals  include  stabilizing  the  value  of  the  currency,  controlling  inflation, \nfacilitating socioeconomic development, ensuring national defense and security, and improving \nliving standards.   \n \n63. \nIn  consultation  with  development  agencies,  the  Government  is  preparing  a  revised  law \non  the  SBV.  The  latest  draft  of  the  law  incorporates  many  of  the  comments  made  by \ndevelopment  agencies  on  its  earlier  draft.  It  makes  the  SBV's  mandate  more  focused  on \nmonetary  policy  and  financial  sector  stability,  and  increases  its  autonomy  in  formulating \nmonetary  policy.  In  particular,  the  draft  law  does  not  provide  for  the  Advisory  Board  on  the \nNational Monetary Policy. Instead, it gives the SBV governor the power to establish a committee \non monetary policy within the SBV. It also sets one objective for monetary policy\u2014ensuring the \nstability  of  the  value  of  the  currency,  which  encompasses  controlling  inflation  and  preventing \nsharp fluctuations of the exchange rate. However, for a number of country-specific reasons, the \nGovernment has decided that the National Assembly (parliament) should retain the authority to \napprove  inflation  targets  (proposed  by  the  SBV),  and  the  SBV  governor  should  continue \nreporting  to  the  Prime  Minister  rather  than  directly  to  the  National  Assembly.  The  draft  law  is \nexpected to be presented to the National Assembly for discussion in the fourth quarter of 2009 \nand for approval in the second quarter of 2010. \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\f15 \n\ninflation,  and  enhance \n\nfinancial  sector  stability. \n\n \nAction  1.2  under  the  proposed  subprogram  will  help  strengthen  monetary  policy \n64. \nmanagement,  control \nIt  complements \nimprovements  in  the  monetary  policy  framework  that  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  for \nstrengthening  monetary  policy  management  (included  in  the  indicative  pipeline  for  2010)  is \nintended to bring about. It also complements policy actions and reforms under subprogram 1 of \nthe  Third  Financial  Sector  Program  Loan  (approved  in  November  2007)21 and  activities  of  the \nTA  for  Support  for  Developing  Capital  Markets  and  Building  Capacity  in  the  Financial  Sector \n(approved in June 2008).22 \n \n65. \nAction  1.3:  Make  commercial-scale  infringements  of  patents,  trademark  rights, \nand rights of design a crime.23 Although Viet Nam has a Law on Intellectual Property Rights, \nthe  protection  of  intellectual  property  rights  is  weak,  which  stifles  innovation  and  business \ndevelopment.  Companies  that  participated  in  the  business  environment  sentiment  survey \nconducted  by  the  Vietnam  Business  Forum  in  October  2008  ranked  the  weak  protection  of \nintellectual property rights as the second-worst aspect of the business environment in Viet Nam \nafter infrastructure.24  \n \n66. \nOne reason violations of intellectual property rights are common in Viet Nam is that such \nviolations are not considered a crime in the country's Criminal Code. To rectify this situation, the \nGovernment  has  prepared\u2014in  consultations  with  development  agencies\u2014amendments  to  the \nCriminal Code that make commercial-scale infringement of patents, trademark rights, and rights \nof design a crime. The amendments were approved by the National Assembly in June 2009 and \nwill become effective on 1 January 2010. \n \n67. \nThis  action  under  the  proposed  subprogram  complements  policy  actions  that  are \nsupported  by  subprogram  2  of  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Development  Program  Loan \n(approved  in  December  2006) 25  as  well  as  actions  that  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise \nDevelopment  Program  Loan  II  (included  in  the  indicative  pipeline  for  2009)  is  intended  to \nsupport. It will contribute to business development and the successful implementation of SEDP \n2006\u20132010 by promoting private sector development. \n \n68. \nAction  1.4:  Adopt  a  pricing  system  for  electricity  from  renewable  energy  and \nprovide  incentives  for  government  procurement  of  energy-efficient  equipment  (footnote \n20). To meet rapidly growing demand for electricity while protecting the environment, Viet Nam \nneeds  to  increase  power  generation  from  renewable  energy  and  stimulate  the  production  of \nenergy-efficient  machinery  and  equipment.  However,  the  cost  of  generating  electricity  from \nrenewable  energy  is  often  higher  than  the  cost of generating  it from  non-renewable  resources \n(such as coal and gas). Therefore, prices for electricity generated from renewable energy must \nbe  higher  than  those  for  electricity  generated  from  non-renewable  resources  to  make  power \ngeneration from renewable energy financially viable.  \n                                                \n21 ADB.  2008.

Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n69. \nIn  July  2008,  the  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Trade  approved\u2014through  Decision  No. \n18/2008/QD-BCT\u2014the  Regulations  on  Avoided  Cost  and  Standardized  Power  Purchase \nAgreement for Small Power Producers of Renewable Energy. The regulations stipulate that the \nwholsale  price  of  electricity  from  renewable  energy  should  be  based  on  the  weighted  average \ncost of electricity produced by combined-cycle gas turbines, which are the most costly thermal \nunits in Viet Nam's electricity supply system. This pricing system, which became effective on 1 \nJanuary 2009, has made the production of electricity from renewable energy commercially more \nattractive. It has significantly improved the chances that ADB's Renewable Energy Development \nand Network Expansion and Rehabilitation for Remote Communes Sector Project (approved in \nMarch 2009)26 will be successful.  \n \nIn March 2009, the Government decided to take additional measures aimed at ensuring \n70. \nthe  full  and  timely  implementation  of  the  national  program  on  energy  efficiency  (adopted  in \n2008). One of these measures is to provide incentives for government procurement of energy-\nefficient  equipment  (e.g.,  by  providing  government  agencies  with  additional  funds  for \nprocurement of energy-efficient equipment and allowing them to retain savings on electricity bills \narising from the use of such equipment).  \n \n71. \nAction 1.4 under the proposed subprogram will provide an impetus to develop renewable \nenergy  and  use  energy-efficient  equipment  in  Viet  Nam.  In  so  doing,  it  will  help  improve  the \nquality of infrastructure, protect the environment, and help reduce poverty indirectly by fostering \nenvironmentally sustainable economic growth.  \n \nThe action will also contribute to poverty reduction directly. Some of the areas with high \n72. \nincidence  of  poverty  (e.g.,  mountainous  areas  inhabited  by  ethnic  minorities)  have  significant \nuntapped  renewable  energy  resources.  The  new  pricing  system  for  electricity  from  renewable \nenergy will help expand the production of such electricity in these areas. Producers of electricity \nfrom renewable energy will be able to compensate for the relatively high cost of production and \nthe low purchasing power of the local population by supplying surplus electricity to the national \ngrid  at  higher  prices.  The  expansion  of  electricity  production  will  improve  remote  communes' \naccess  to  electricity,  foster  business  development,  create  jobs,  raise  living  standards,  and \nreduce poverty in these communes.27 \n\n2. \n\nSocial Inclusion \n\n73.  Action 2.1: Formulate an education development strategy for the period up to 2020, \nfocusing on the equity of learning outcomes and the relevance of contents (footnote 20). \nAlthough  Viet  Nam's  education  sector  improved  substantially  in  the  last  10\u201315  years,  many \nissues remain. In particular, the primary education enrollment rate remained stagnant between \n2007 and 2008 (Appendix 4). Furthermore, learning outcomes and completion rates in primary \neducation differ significantly among various groups of children. Children from poor households \ntend to do less well than children from non-poor households; children in remote areas tend to do \nless  well  than  children  in  other  areas;  and  ethnic  minority  children  tend  to  do  less  well  than \nethnic majority children. The completion rates for children from the poorest income quintile and \nethnic  minority  children  are  about  20  percentage  points  lower  than those for  children from  the \n\n                                                \n26 ADB.  2009.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  and \nTechnical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Renewable  Energy  Development  and \nNetwork Expansion and Rehabilitation for Remote Communes Sector Project. Manila. \n\n27 Communes are the third-level administrative units (below provinces and districts) in Viet Nam. \n\n\f17 \n\nrichest income quintile and ethnic majority children, respectively.28 The relevance of contents is \nan  issue  at  the  higher  levels  of  education,  especially  in  vocational  and  university  education. \nThere are also small gender disparities in education, with a higher proportion of boys in primary \nand secondary education and a higher proportion of girls in vocational and university education.  \n \n74. \nTo address these issues in a holistic manner, the Government has prepared\u2014through \nextensive  consultations  within  the  Government,  as  well  as  with  the  civil  society,  development \nagencies,  and  other  stakeholders\u2014an  education  development  strategy  for  the  period  up  to \n2020.  Unlike  previous  education  strategies,  which  focused  on  certain  levels  of  education,  the \nnew strategy takes a comprehensive approach to education development. It covers all levels of \neducation  from  early  childhood  to  higher  education,  and  attaches  particular  importance  to  the \nequity of leaning outcomes and the relevance of contents. It is expected to be adopted together \nwith SEDP 2011\u20132020 in 2010.  \n \n75. \nThe  strategy  will  provide  a  medium-term  framework  for  the  Secondary  Education \nSector  Development  Program  (included  in  the  indicative  pipeline  for  2009)  and  the  Higher \nEducation  Sector  Development  Program  (included  in  the  indicative  pipeline  for  2010). \nUltimately,  it  will  help  improve  access  to  and  the  quality  of  education,  enhance  Viet  Nam's \ncompetitiveness,  eliminate  the  remaining  gender  disparities  in  education,  and  foster  socially \ninclusive economic growth. \n\n3. \n\nNatural Resource Management \n\n76. \nAction  3.1:  Issue  regulations  to  ensure  financial  sustainability  of  irrigation \nservices and provide financial relief for poor farmers (footnote 23). The incidence of poverty \namong farmers, especially rice-growing farmers, is significantly higher than among non-farmers. \nThe  household  survey  data  show  that  the  poverty  rate  was  20.4%  among  farmers  and  23.4% \namong rice-growing farmers in 2006, compared with 3.8% for the urban population and 5.0% for \nnon-farmers  living  in  the  rural  areas.29 Because  of  their  low  incomes,  many  poor  farmers  are \nunable to pay for the water they use in crop production.   \n \n77. \nIn October 2007, the Government issued Decree No. 154/2007/ND-CP, which called for \nthe  abolition  of  irrigation  service fees  with  the  aim  of  providing financial relief  to  poor farmers. \nHowever,  the  irrigation  service  fee  waiver  envisaged  in  the  decree  was  poorly  targeted. \nFurthermore,  the  decree  raised  concerns  about  the  financial  viability  of  irrigation  services,  the \nsustainability  of  investment  in  irrigation  infrastructure,  and  the  lack  of  incentives  for  water \nconservation.  \n \n78. \nTo address these concerns, the Government issued Decree No. 115/2008/ND-CP dated \n14  November  2008,  which  clarifies  the  application  of  the  irrigation  service  fee  waver  and \nassigns responsibilities for financing operation and maintenance of irrigation infrastructure. The \ndecree  stipulates  that  the  irrigation  service  fee  waiver  applies  only  to  services  provided  by \nirrigation  management  companies  (which  are  SOEs)  and  only  to  water  used  for  agricultural \n\n                                                \n28 World Bank. 2009.

The decree also requires the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and local \ngovernments  to  provide  adequate  financial  support  from  the  central  and  local  budgets  to \nirrigation  management  companies  to  enable  them  to  properly  operate  and  maintain  irrigation \ninfrastructure.  The  MOF  issued  Circular  No.  36/2009/TT-BTC  dated  26  February  2009  on  the \nimplementation  of  the  decree  and  increased  the  budget  allocation  for  irrigation  subsidies  from \nD1.0 trillion in 2008 to D3.5 trillion in 2009.  \n \n79. \nAction  3.1  under  subprogram  2  addresses  an  important  policy  issue  affecting  ADB's \nseveral  ongoing  and  planned  projects  in  Viet  Nam,  including  the  Second  Red  River  Basin \nSector Project (approved in October 2001),31 Phuoc Hoa Water Resources Project (approved in \nNovember  2003),32 Central  Region  Water  Resources  Project  (approved  in  November  2005,)33 \nand  the  Strengthening  Water  Management  and  Irrigation  Systems  Rehabilitation  Project \n(included  in  the  2010  indicative  pipeline  for  lending  products).  It  will  contribute  to  poverty \nreduction  directly  by  providing  financial  relief  to  poor  farmers  and  indirectly  by  improving  the \nmanagement  of  water  resources  and  fostering  environmentally  sustainable  economic  growth. \nTentative action 3.1 under subprogram 3 (issue guidelines for efficient use of water resources to \naccompany the irrigation service fee waiver policy) will build on action 3.1 under subprogram 2 \nto  address the  issue  of  inadequate  incentives for  water  conservation,  another  important  policy \nissue affecting ADB's operations in Viet Nam.  \n \n80. \nAction  3.2:  Approve  a  national  targeted  program  for  adapting  to  climate  change \nand  allocate  institutional  responsibilities  for  its  implementation  (footnote  20).  Climate \nchange  is  expected  to  have  significant  adverse  impacts  on  Viet  Nam.  A  study  on  potential \nconsequences  of  rising  sea  levels  resulting  from  climate  change  for  84  developing  countries \nfound that Viet Nam is one of the five countries that would be most severely affected.34 A sea \nlevel rise of 1 meter would affect more than 5% of Viet Nam's land area and almost 11% of its \npopulation. An analysis of the potential impact of climate change on human development in Viet \nNam  concluded  that  climate  change  is  \"a  very  real  threat  to  Viet  Nam's  continued  socio-\neconomic development.\"35  \n \nTo  meet  the  challenges  posed  by  climate  change,  the  Government  has  adopted\u2014\n81. \nthrough  Decision  No.  158/2008/QD-TTg  dated  2  December  2008\u2014the  National  Targeted \nProgram  for  Responding  to  the  Climate  Change.  The  objectives  of  the  program  include \nassessing  the  impacts  of  climate  change  on  specific  sectors  and  localities  in  Viet  Nam; \nincreasing  public  awareness  of  the  challenges  posed  by  climate  change;  and  developing  and \nimplementing  national,  sector-specific,  and  local  action  plans  to  respond  to  climate  change. \n                                                \n30 Farmers  are  still  to  pay  fees  for  irrigation  services  provided  by  water  user  associations,  for  water  provided  by \nirrigation  management  companies  and  used  for  non-agricultural  purposes,  and  for  water  provided  by  irrigation \nmanagement companies for agricultural purposes beyond the limits set by the Government.   \n\n31 ADB.  2001.

The TA projects for Assessing Impacts \n82. \nof  the  Climate  Change  on  the  Mekong  Delta  and  for  the  Implementation  of  the  National \nTargeted Program for Responding to the Climate Change (included in the indicative pipeline for \n2009) are intended to help the Government implement the Program.   \n \n83. \nAction  3.3:  Enhance  treatment  of  medical  waste  discharged  by  hospitals  at  both \ncentral  and  local  levels  (footnote  23).  The  proportion  of  hospital  wastes  that  were  treated \ndeclined  between  2007  and  2008.  Therefore,  the  treatment  of  hospital  wastes  was  one  of  the \nsubjects  covered  during  the  consultations  between  the  Government  and  the  development \nagencies on the policy matrix for PRSC 8.    \n \n84. \nIn October 2008, the Ministry of Health issued Directive No. 7164/BYT-KCB, instructing \nall  hospitals  to  set  up  a  system  for  treatment  of  medical  wastes.  In  January  2009,  a  steering \ncommittee on the treatment of medical wastes, chaired by minister of health, was established. \nThe  Ministry  of  Health  is  now  preparing  an  action  plan  for  improving  the  treatment  of  hospital \nwastes, including solid and liquid wastes. The action plan will cover public and private hospitals. \n \n85. \nThis action under the proposed subprogram complements the Health Care in the South \nCentral  Coast  Region  Project  (approved  in  October  2008),  which  aims  to  improve  health \nfacilities and hospital waste management in the south central coast region of Viet Nam.36 It will \nhelp protect the environment and eliminate the risk to public safety posed by medical wastes.   \n\n4. \n\nGovernance \n\n86. \nAction  4.1:  Conduct  a  midterm  review  of  SEDP  2006\u20132010  and  strengthen  the \nresults-based  approach  in  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  framework  for  planning \n(footnote 23). As part of the modernization of planning processes in Viet Nam, the Government \nadopted a results-based monitoring and evaluation framework for SEDP 2006\u20132010 in 2007.37 \nADB  assisted the Government  in  developing  the framework  through the TA for  Results-Based \nMonitoring of Poverty Reduction and Growth (approved in July 2005).38 Although SEDP 2006\u2013\n2010 calls for improvements in many aspects of governance, only a few indicators and targets \nfor monitoring and evaluating progress in this area were included in the framework because of \nthe lack of suitable indicators. \n \n87. \nIn  2008,  the  Government  prepared  a  midterm  review  of  SEDP  2006\u20132010,  using  the \nresults-based  monitoring  and  evaluation framework  adopted  in  2007.  Unlike the  Government's \nprevious  reports  on  the  implementation  of  SEDPs,  the  midterm  review  of  SEDP  2006\u20132010 \nfocused on progress towards development outcomes rather than production targets. The review \nwas  presented  to  the  National  Assembly  in  October  2008  and  to  the  Consultative  Group \nMeeting  for  Viet  Nam  in  December  2008.  It  was  useful  in  assessing  the  progress  towards \nperformance  targets  of  SIPRP  V  (which  are  aligned  with  those  of  SEDP  2006\u20132010)  and \n\n                                                \n36 ADB.  2008.

The survey results, which are being \nanalyzed, will be used in developing governance indicators for monitoring and evaluation of the \nimplementation  of  future  SEDPs  and  in  designing  a  governance  module  for  future  household \nliving standards surveys.  \n \n89. \nlaw  consolidating  the \nmanagement of domestic and external debt (footnote 20). Viet Nam has made considerable \nprogress in modernizing its tax system and improving public expenditure management over the \npast  several  years.  However,  progress  in  strengthening the management  of  public  assets  and \nliabilities  has  been  slow.  In  particular,  the  legal  framework  for  public  debt  management  has \nremained  weak.  The  responsibility  for  managing  public  debt  is  divided  among  several \ngovernment agencies (including the MOF) and among several units within the MOF. Information \nsharing  among  the  government  agencies  responsible  for  managing  public  debt  is  not \nsatisfactory.  \n \n90. \nIn  an  important  step  towards  sound  public  debt  management,  the  Government  has \nformulated\u2014in  consultation  with  development  agencies\u2014a  law  on  public  debt.  The  law \nconsolidates  to  a  large  degree  the  management  of  domestic  and  external  public  debt  in  one \ndepartment  within  the  MOF  and  improves  information  sharing  among  the  MOF  and  other \ngovernment  agencies  that  will,  for  historical  reasons,  continue  playing  a  role  in  public  debt \nmanagement.39  The law was passed by the National Assembly in June 2009 and will become \neffective on 1 January 2010.  \n \n91. \nAction  4.2  under  subprogram  2  will  help  strengthen  public  financial  management  and \nimprove  governance  in  Viet  Nam.  It  complements  activities  of  the  TA  for  the  Support  for \nDeveloping Capital Markets and Building Capacity in the Financial Sector (footnote 22) and the \nTA for Supporting Financial Management Decentralization (approved in December 2007).40  \n \n92. \nAction 4.3: Adopt principles of competition, merit-orientation, and transparency in \nthe  recruitment,  appointment,  promotion,  and  dismissal  of  civil  servants  (footnote  23). \nThe  recruitment  and  promotion  of  civil  servants  are  not  always  competitive,  merit-based,  and \ntransparent. It is one of the main reasons why public administration is weak and corruption is a \nserious problem. \n \n93. \nIn November 2008, the National Assembly passed the Law on Civil Servants, which will \nbecome  effective  on  1  January  2010.  The  law  introduces  the  principles  of  competition,  merit-\norientation, and transparency in the recruitment, appointment, promotion, and dismissal of civil \nservants. ADB assisted the Government in drafting the law through the TA for Supporting Civil \nService Reform (approved in August 2008).41 \n \n\n                                                \n39 In  particular,  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment  will  continue  coordinating  all  public  investment  projects, \nincluding  those  financed  through  external  borrowing,  and  SBV  will  remain  the  Government's  focal  point  for  its \ninteractions with international financial institutions.  \n\n40 ADB.  2008.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  Supporting  Financial  Management \n\nDecentralization. Manila. \n\n41 ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Supporting Civil Service Reform. Manila. \n\n20 \n\n \n\n\f21 \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  has  adopted  an  action  plan  for the  implementation  of  the \n94. \nlaw. The plan includes drafting the necessary implementing regulations and conducting pilot civil \nservice projects, which ADB will support through the TA on civil service reform (para. 93). These \nactivities  have  been  included  in  the  updated  policy  matrix  of  SIPRP  V  as  tentative  action  4.5 \nunder subprogram 3.      \n \n95. \nAction 4.4: Issue a comprehensive anticorruption strategy, setting out preventive, \ndemand-side,  and  sector-specific  solutions,  and  monitoring  mechanisms. 42  The \nGovernment  recognizes  that  corruption  is  a  major  hindrance  to  the  country's  economic \ndevelopment. As part of its effort to reduce corruption, the Government has adopted\u2014through \nResolution No. 21/NQ-CP dated 12 May 2009\u2014a national anticorruption strategy for the period \nup to 2020 and an action plan for the implementation of the strategy. The strategy provides for a \nwide  range  of  measures  to  combat  corruption,  including  preventive  measures  (such  as \nenhancing the transparency of policy making and creating equal opportunities for all businesses) \nand  demand-side  measures  (such  as  adopting  a  law  on  access  to  information  and  narrowing \nthe range of information that is considered to be a state secret). The strategy also calls for the \ndevelopment  of  sector-specific  and  provincial  plans  for  its  implementation.  The  action  plan \nincludes developing indicators for assessing progress in fighting corruption, conducting annual \nhousehold  and  enterprise  surveys  on  unofficial  payments  to  government  agencies,  and \ndisclosing survey results.  \n\nB. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n96. \nSome of the policy actions covered by subprogram 2 of SIPRP V entail substantial costs \nto Viet Nam\u2019s state budget. Some of the actions included in the policy matrix for PRSC 8 but not \ncovered  by  subprogram  2  of  SIPRP  V  also  have  significant  costs.  For  example,  ensuring \nfinancial sustainability  of  irrigation  services,  while  providing financial relief to  poor farmers,  will \ncost the state budget about $170 million in 2008, $190 million in 2009, $210 million in 2011. The \nimplementation  of  the  National  Targeted  Program  for  Adapting  to  the  Climate  Change \n(excluding the national, sector-specific, and local actions plans) will cost more than $100 million, \nhalf of which is to be provided from the state budget. The implementation of the national, sector-\nspecfic, and local action plans is likely to cost the state budget billions of dollars. The total cost \nto  the  state  budget  in  2009\u20132011  of  the  actions  included  in  the  policy  matrix  for  PRSC  8  is \nestimated at $680 million.  \n \n97. \nThe  Government  has  requested  development  agencies  participating  in  the  PRSC \nprocess  to  finance  a  greater  share  of  the  cost  of  policy  reforms  in  2009  than  in  the  previous \nyears.  The  reason  is  that  the  Government  is  facing  difficulties  in  financing  its  increased \nexpenditure  on  social  safety  nets.  Budgetary  revenue  is  expected  to  decline  considerably  in \n2009 compared with 2008 mostly because of lower world oil prices, lower foreign trade turnover, \nand  tax  reductions  and  deferrals  aimed  at  stimulating  growth.  At  the  same  time,  the  cost  of \nborrowing in financial markets has increased substantially because of the global economic crisis \nand investors' heightened aversion to risk.  \n \nIt is proposed that a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR64,036,000 be provided \n98. \nfor subprogram 2 of SIPRP V from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The loan will have a term of \n24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; an annual interest rate of 1.0% during the grace \n\n                                                \n42 This  is  a  more specific  version  of  the  tentative  action  under  subprograms  2  and  3  in  the  original  policy  matrix  of \n\nSIPRP V (adopt a comprehensive anticorruption strategy).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fperiod and 1.5% during the amortization period; and other terms and conditions set forth in the \nLoan Agreement.  \n \n99. \nThe  World  Bank  has  approved  PRSC  8  in  the  amount  of  $350  million  from  the \nInternational  Development  Association.43 More  than  a  dozen  other  development  agencies  are \nexpected  to  provide  grants  or  concessional  loans totaling  about  $150 million  as  cofinancing  or \nparallel financing with PRSC 8 (Appendix 7). The Government will cover the remaining cost to \nthe budget of the actions included in the policy matrix for PRSC 8. \n\nC. \n\nImplementation Arrangements44 \n\n1. \n\nExecuting Agency \n\n100.  The SBV is the Executing Agency for SIPRP V. As such, it will be the Executing Agency \nfor the proposed subprogram.  \n \n101.  The  SBV  hosts  the  PRSC  coordination  unit,  which  facilitates  interactions  between  the \nGovernment  and  development  agencies  within  the framework  of the  PRSC  process. The  SBV \nwas also the Executing Agency for SIPRPs I\u2013IV.  \n\n2. \n\nDisbursement and Procurement \n\n102.  The  proposed  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  a  single  tranche  upon  the  declaration  of  loan \neffectiveness.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs \n(excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries, \nexcluding the ineligible items listed in Appendix 8 and imports financed from other bilateral and \nmultilateral sources. \n \n103.  As provided in ADB\u2019s simplified disbursement procedures and requirements for program \nloans,45 the proceeds of the loan will be disbursed to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam as the \nBorrower.  No  supporting  import  documentation  will  be  required,  provided  that  the  value  of \nViet Nam\u2019s  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and \nimports financed under other official development assistance is at least equal to the amount of \nthe  loan  to  be  disbursed.  The  Government  will  certify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  its \nwithdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be \nrequired. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy \nof the Borrower\u2019s certification. The Borrower's procedures for procurement and disbursement of \nfunds, and the use of counterpart funds, are considered satisfactory. \n\n3. \n\nPeriod of Utilization \n\n104.  The loan will be fully utilized by 31 May 2010. \n\n                                                \n43 By comparison, the amount of PRSC 7 (also provided from the International Development Association) was about \n\n$150 million.  \n\n44 The implementation arrangements for SIPRP V (including its subprogram 2) are described in greater detail in ADB. \n2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on the Proposed Program Cluster \nand  Loan  for  Subprogram  1  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Support  for  the  Implementation  of  the \nPoverty Reduction Program V. Manila. (pp. 20\u201322). \n\n45 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n\n22 \n\n \n\n\f23 \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n105.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government.  Consistent  with  its commitment to good governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  subprogram  2  of  SIPRP  V.  To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the draft \nLoan Agreement. \n\nVI. \n\nSUBPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACT, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial Benefits \n\n106.  The policy reforms supported by SIPRP V and, in particular, its subprogram 2 will yield \nconsiderable  economic  benefits  to  Viet  Nam  and  substantial  financial  benefits  to  the \nGovernment. They will raise the living standards of the Vietnamese people by fostering socially \ninclusive  and  environmentally  sustainable  economic  growth.  The  reforms  will  also  increase \nbudget revenue by expanding the tax base, and reduce budget expenditure by improving public \nfinancial  management.  Over  the  medium  term,  the  financial  benefits  of  these  reforms  to  the \nGovernment are likely to exceed their costs (including interest to be paid on loans received from \ndevelopment agencies within the framework of the PRSC process). \n\nB. \n\nSocial Impact \n\n107.  A detailed poverty and social impact assessment of subprogram 2 of SIPRP V has been \nprepared.  In  particular,  the  social  implications  of  the  actions  covered  by  the  subprogram \n(including  their  indigenous  people  and  involuntary  resettlement  implications)  have  been \nreviewed. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 9. \n\n108.  The  policy  actions  covered  by  the  subprogram will  have  significant  social  effects.  In \nparticular,  they  will  help  reduce  poverty  indirectly  by  improving  governance  and  the  quality  of \neducation,  developing  businesses,  and  spurring  economic  growth.  Business  development  and \neconomic growth will create news jobs, raise incomes, and make more resources available for \nsocial protection. The poor will benefit from new jobs, higher incomes, and increased availability \nof resources for social protection.  \n \n109.  Some of the actions under the subprogram will also make a direct contribution to poverty \nreduction. For example, action 1.4 (adopt a pricing system for electricity from renewable energy \nand  provide  incentives  for  government  procurement  of  energy-efficient  equipment)  will  help \nreduce  poverty  in  areas  with  untapped  renewable  energy  resources  and  high  incidence  of \npoverty  (e.g.,  mountainous  areas  inhabited  by  ethnic  minorities)  by  making  the  production  of \nelectricity  from  renewable  energy  commercially  more  attractive.  Action  2.1  (formulate  an \neducation  development  strategy  for  the  period  up  to  2020,  focusing  on  the  equity  of  learning \noutcomes and the relevance of contents) will help improve access of the poor, ethnic minorities \nand  other  disadvantaged  groups  of  the  population  to  education  and  ensure  that  there  are  no \nsignificant  differences  in  learning  outcomes  among  children  of  different  backgrounds  (i.e., \nchildren from poor households do as well as children from rich households, children in remote \nareas  do  as  well  as  children  in  other  areas,  and  ethnic  minority  children  do  as  well  as  ethnic \nmajority  children).  This  action  will  also  help  eliminate  the  remaining  gender  disparities  in \neducation.  Action  3.1  (issue  regulations  aimed  to  ensure  financial  sustainability  of  irrigation \nservices  and  provide  financial  relief  for  poor  farmers)  will  make  irrigation  services  more \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\faffordable  for  poor  farmers.  Farm  households  headed  by  women  will  benefit  more  from  this \naction  than  farm  households  headed  by  men,  because  the  incidence  of  poverty  among  the \nformer  is  higher  than  among  the  latter.  Action  4.1  (conduct  a  midterm  review  of  SEDP  2006\u2013\n2010 and strengthen the result-based approach in the monitoring and evaluation framework for \nplanning)  will  help  make  future  SEDPs  more  effective  in  reducing  poverty  and  addressing \ngender issues.  \n \n110.  Ethnic  minorities  will  benefit  more  from  the  policy  actions  covered  by  the  subprogram \nthan the ethnic majority. However, none of the actions is centered on ethnic minorities or has an \nadverse  impact  on  ethnic  minorities.  Therefore,  the  subprogram  has  been  assigned  to \nindigenous people category C. \n \n111.  SIPRP V does not have an investment component, and the policy actions covered by its \nsubprogram  2  will  not  cause  any  involuntary  resettlement.  Hence,  the  subprogram  has  been \nassigned to involuntary resettlement category C. \n\nC. \n\nEnvironmental Impact \n\n112.  Subprogram  2  of  SIPRP  V  has  been  assigned  to  environmental  category  C.  Its \nenvironmental implications have been reviewed and a matrix of potential environmental impacts \nhas  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002).  The  matrix  is  in \nAppendix 10. \n \n113.  The review of the environmental implications of subprogram 2 concluded that several of \nthe actions included in the policy framework for this subprogram are likely to have at least minor \npositive environmental impact. For example, the adoption of the National Targeted Program on \nAdapting  to  the  Climate  Change  is  likely  to  have  a  major  positive  impact,  while  the  actions \nrelated  to  renewable  energy,  irrigation  services,  and  medical  wastes  are  likely  to  have  minor \npositive  impact.  Enhancement  measures  have  been  developed  to  optimize  the  expected \npositive impact. No action has been identified as likely to have an adverse environmental impact. \n\nD. \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\n114.  SIPRP V and, in particular, its subprogram 2 are to support policy actions that constitute \ncritical  steps  in  the  policy  reforms  needed  for  the  successful  implementation  of  SEDP  2006\u2013\n2010 and are important to ADB\u2019s operations in Viet Nam. However, the reforms need to be fully \ncarried out if SEDP 2006\u20132010 is to be successfully implemented. Therefore, it is assumed that, \nafter  completing  the  policy  actions  covered  by  SIPRP  V  and  the  other  actions  included  in  the \npolicy  matrices  for  the  World  Bank\u2019s  PRSCs  7\u20139,  the  Government  will  follow  through  with  the \npolicy reforms needed for the successful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 on its own or with \nthe  support  of  development  agencies  under  other  projects.  It  is  further  assumed  that  the \ninvestment projects that are included in SEDP 2006\u20132010 and necessary for attaining its targets \nand goals will be implemented on schedule.  \n \n115.  These assumptions are based on the Government\u2019s commitment to carry out the policy \nreforms and implement the investment projects that are needed to achieve the targets and goals \nof  SEDP  2006\u20132010.  Furthermore,  policy  reforms  that  are  needed  for  the  successful \nimplementation  of  SEDP  2006\u20132010  are  now  or  will  be  supported  by  ADB  through  other \npolicy-based loans to Viet Nam (such as the financial sector program loans and the small and \nmedium-sized  enterprise  development  loans)  and  by  other  development  agencies  both  within \nand outside the framework of the PRSC process. \n\n24 \n\n \n\n\f25 \n\n \n116.  The  slowdown  of  growth  caused  by  the  global  economic  crisis  could  be  so  prolonged \nthat  it  will  preclude  the  successful  implementation  of  SEDP  2006\u20132010  and,  in  particular,  the \nachievement  of  its  poverty  target.  However,  this  risk  is  small.  The  fiscal  stimulus  measures \nadopted  by  the Government  in  January\u2013May  2009  will  spur growth  in the  second  half  of 2009 \nand  in  2010.  Moreover,  the  external  environment  is  expected  to  improve  significantly  in  2010. \nAccordingly,  economic  growth  is  likely  to  rebound  in  the  second  half  of  2009  and  accelerate \nfurther in 2010.  \n \n117.  As economic growth accelerates and world commodity prices rise, inflation could surge \nagain.  High  inflation  could  push  many  households  into  poverty  and  preclude  the  successful \nimplementation of SEDP 2006-2010. To mitigate this risk, the SBV has started taking measures \nto keep inflation in check. In particular, it has committed to limit growth of money supply to 30% \nin 2009; asked state-owned commercial banks to limit loan growth to 25% in 2009; and urged all \ncommercial  banks  to  tighten  credit  for  consumer  spending  and  purchases  of  real  estate  and \nstocks.  The  SBV  is  expected  to  start  tightening  monetary  policy  toward  the  end  of  2009  and \npursue moderately tight monetary policy in 2010.46 \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n118. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the draft loan agreement: \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  actions  covered  by  subprogram  2  of  SIPRP  V  and  specified  in  the \nDevelopment Policy Letter will continue to be in effect during the implementation \nof SEDP 2006\u20132010 and thereafter; and \nAdequate  and  timely  counterpart  funds  for  carrying  out  these  actions  will  be \nmade available. \n\nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n119. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  64,036,000  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet \nNam for subprogram 2 of the Support for the Implementation of the Poverty Reduction Program \nV from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 24 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n22 September 2009 \n \n \n\n                                                \n46 ADB. 2009.

The \n1. \nmost recent available household survey data show that the poverty rate (based on the cost of a \nconsumption basket allowing for a daily intake of 2,100 calories per person and some nonfood \nexpenditure)  dropped  from  58.1%  in  1993  to  16.0%  in  2006.  The  food  poverty  rate  (the \nproportion  of  people  whose  total  expenditure  would  not  suffice  for  a  daily  intake  of  2,100 \ncalories  even  if  it  was  entirely  allocated  to  food)  fell  from  24.9%  to  6.7%  between  1993  and \n2006. The poverty gap (the difference between the poverty line and the average expenditure of \nthe poor expressed as a percentage of the former) narrowed from 18.5% to 3.8% over the same \nperiod (Table A2.1). \n \n\nTable A2.1: Selected Poverty Indicators for Viet Nam, 1993\u20132006 \n \n\nIndicator \n\nPoverty rate (%) \n\n  Urban areas \n\n  Rural areas \n\n  Kinh and Chinese  \n\n  Ethnic minorities  \n\nFood poverty rate (%) \n\n  Urban areas \n\n  Rural areas \n\n  Kinh and Chinese  \n\n  Ethnic minorities  \n\nPoverty gap (%) \n\n  Urban areas \n\n  Rural areas \n\n  Kinh and Chinese  \n\n  Ethnic minorities \n\n1993 \n\n1998 \n\n2002 \n\n2004 \n\n2006 \n\n37.4  \n\n28.9  \n\n19.5  \n\n9.2  \n\n45.5  \n\n31.1  \n\n75.2  \n\n15.0  \n\n2.5  \n\n18.6  \n\n10.6  \n\n41.8  \n\n9.5  \n\n1.7  \n\n11.8  \n\n7.1  \n\n6.6  \n\n35.6  \n\n23.1  \n\n69.3  \n\n10.9  \n\n1.9  \n\n13.6  \n\n6.5  \n\n6.9  \n\n1.3  \n\n8.7  \n\n4.7  \n\n3.6  \n\n25.0  \n\n13.5  \n\n60.7  \n\n7.4  \n\n0.8  \n\n9.7  \n\n3.5  \n\n4.7  \n\n0.7  \n\n6.1  \n\n2.6  \n\n16.0 \n\n3.9 \n\n20.4 \n\n10.3 \n\n52.2 \n\n6.7 \n\n1.2 \n\n8.7 \n\n3.2 \n\n3.8 \n\n3.2 \n\n4.9 \n\n2.0 \n\n41.5  \n\n34.2  \n\n29.2 \n\n58.1  \n\n25.1  \n\n66.4  \n\n53.9  \n\n86.4  \n\n24.9  \n\n7.9  \n\n29.1  \n\n20.8  \n\n52.0  \n\n18.5  \n\n6.4  \n\n21.5  \n\n16.0  \n\n34.7  \n\n24.2  \n\n22.8  \n\n19.2  \n\n15.4 \n\nSource: World Bank. 2007.

The  proportion  of  people \nliving on less than $1.0 a day based on purchasing power parity (PPP) dropped from 50.8% of \nthe population in 1990 to 4.0% in 2007, and the proportion of those living on less than $2.0 per \nday  based  on  PPP  fell  from  87.0%  to  32.9%  (Table  A2.2).  The  poverty  rate  based  on  the \nmethodology  of  the  Ministry  of  Labor,  Invalids  and  Social  Affairs  (MOLISA)  fell  from  22.0%  in \n2005 to an estimated 13.1% in 2008.1 \n\n                                                \n1 The  poverty  rate  based  on  the  methodology  of  the  MOLISA  measures  the  proportion  of  people  living  below  the \nofficial  poverty  line,  which  is  D260,000  per  person  in  urban  areas  and  D200,000  per  person  in  rural  areas. \nHouseholds  below  the  poverty  line  are  identified  by  local  officials  of  MOLISA  through  a  combination  of  their \npersonal knowledge, survey techniques, and village discussions. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n \n33 \n\nTable A2.2: $1-a-Day and $2-a-Day Poverty in Viet Nam, 1990\u20132007 \n\n$1-a-Day based on PPP \n\n$2-a-Day based on PPP \n\nYear \n1990 \n1996 \n1999 \n2002 \n2004 \n2007 \n\nPoverty Rate \n(%) \n50.8 \n23.6 \n16.9 \n13.6 \n7.8 \n4.0 \n\nPoverty Magnitude  \n(million persons) \n33.6 \n17.3 \n13.0 \n10.9 \n6.4 \n3.4 \n\nPoverty Rate \n(%) \n87.0 \n69.4 \n65.9 \n58.2 \n43.9 \n32.9 \n\nPoverty Magnitude \n(million persons) \n57.6 \n50.8 \n50.5 \n46.4 \n36.0 \n28.1 \n\nPPP = purchasing power parity \nSource: World Bank. 2008. East Asia: Testing Times Ahead. Washington, DC.  \n\n \n3. \nAccordingly,  Viet  Nam  has  made  good  progress  toward  the  Millennium  Development \nGoals (MDGs). It has achieved three MDG targets and is likely to attain another four ahead of \ntime.  In  addition  to  the  targets  for  extreme  poverty  and  hunger,  Viet  Nam  has  achieved  the \ntarget concerning the incidence of malaria and other diseases. The country is likely to achieve \nthe  targets  for  the  completion  of  primary  schooling  by  boys  and  girls,  gender  equality  in \neducation, under-5 mortality, and maternal mortality (Table A2.3). \n\nB. \n\nChallenges in Poverty Reduction \n\n4. \nDespite the tremendous strides Viet Nam has made in eradicating poverty over the past \n15\u201320 years, much remains to be done. First, the absolute number of poor people is still large, \nalthough their share in the total population has been drastically reduced. The household survey \ndata show that 13.5 million people lived in poverty and 5.7 million people suffered from hunger \nin  2006.  The  poverty  rate  based  on  MOLISA's  methodology  suggests  that  11.3  million  people \nlived  below  the  official  poverty  line  in  2008.  According  to  the  World  Bank,  3.4  million  people \nsurvived on less than $1.0 per day (based on PPP) and 28.1 million people lived on less than \n$2.0 per day (based on PPP) in 2007 (Table A2.2). \n \n5. \nSecond, the incidence of poverty is still high in rural areas and among ethnic minorities, \neven though it has been decreasing faster than in urban areas and among the ethnic majority. \nIn  2006,  the  poverty rate  was  20.4%  in  rural  areas  (compared  with  3.9%  in  urban  areas),  and \n52.2%  among  ethnic  minorities  (compared  with  10.2%  among  the  Kinh  and  Chinese  majority) \n(Table  A2.1).  Rural  areas  accounted  for  73.3%  of  the  total  population  but  93.6%  of  the  poor. \nEthnic minorities made up only 13.5% of the total population but 44.4% of the poor (Table A2.4). \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nTable A2.3: Viet Nam's Progress toward the Millennium Development Goals \n\n \n\nGoal 1 \n\nEradicate extreme poverty and hunger \n\nProgress \n\nStatus \n\nTarget 1.1  Halve, between 1990 and 2015, the \nproportion of people living in poverty \n\nPoverty reduced by more two-thirds \nbetween 1993 and 2006 \n\nTarget 1.3  Halve, between 1990 and 2015, the \n\nproportion who suffer from hunger \n\nProportion reduced by more than two- \nthirds between 1993 and 2006 \n\nAlready \nachieved \n\nAlready \nachieved \n\nGoal 2 \n\nAchieve universal primary education \n\nProgress \n\nStatus \n\nEnsure that, by 2015, children everywhere, \nboys and girls alike, will be able to complete a \nfull course of primary schooling \n\nPrimary education completion rate was \n85.6% in 2007 \n\nLikely to be \nachieved \n\nPromote gender equality \n\nProgress \n\nTarget 2.1 \n\nGoal 3 \n\nTarget 3.1 \n\nEliminate gender disparity in primary and \nsecondary education, preferably by 2005, and \nin all levels of education no later than 2015 \n\nThere are only small gender \ndisparities in education, with a higher \nproportion of boys in primary and \nsecondary education and a higher \nproportion of girls in vocational and \nuniversity education \n\nGoal 4 \n\nReduce child mortality \n\nProgress \n\nTarget 4.1  Reduce by two thirds, between 1990 and \n\n2015, the under-5 mortality rate \n\nThe under-5 mortality rate fell from 58 \n(per 1,000 live births) in 1990 to 25 \n(per 1,000 live births) in 2008 \n\nGoal 5 \n\nImprove maternal health \n\nProgress \n\nStatus \n\nTarget 5.1  Reduce by three quarters, between 1990 and \n2015, the maternal mortality ratio \n\nThe maternal mortality ratio fell from \n233 (per 100,000 live births) in 1990 to \n75 (per 100,000 live births) in 2008 \n\nLikely to be \nachieved \n\nGoal 6 \n\nCombat HIV/AIDS and other diseases \n\nProgress \n\nTarget 6.1 \n\nBy 2015 have halted and begun to \nreverse the spread of HIV/AIDS \n\nThe number of detected HIV/AIDS \ncases rose from about 1,500 a year in \n1990\u20131993 to more than 20,000 a year \nin 2005\u20132007 \n\nTarget 6.3 \n\nBy 2015 halted and reverse the \nincidence of malaria and other diseases \n\nThe number of malaria cases dropped \nsignificantly in recent years, with only \n20 malaria-related deaths in 2007 \n\nAlready \nachieved \n\nGoal 7 \n\nEnsure environmental sustainability \n\nProgress \n\nTarget 7.1 \n\nEmbrace sustainability and reverse the \nloss of environmental resources \n\nForest cover up, but losses in closed \ncanopy forest and biodiversity \n\nTarget 7.3  Halve, by 2015 the share of people \n\nwithout drinking water and sanitation \n\nRapid progress on drinking water, but \nmuch slower progress on sanitation \n\nSource: Government of Viet Nam, United Nations Development Programme, World Bank, and Asian Development \nBank staff assessment. \n \n6. \nThird, the rural poor and poor ethnic minority people not only account for relatively large \nproportions  of  their  respective  population  groups,  but  also  have  significantly  lower  average \nincomes than the urban poor and poor ethnic majority people, respectively.

It  is  low  in  the \n7. \nSoutheast, Red River Delta, Mekong Delta, and South Central Coast, but high in the Northern \nMountains (especially the Northwest Mountains), North Central Coast, and Central Highlands. In \n2006,  the  poverty  rate  was  30.2%  in  the  Northern  Mountains  (49.0%  in  the  Northwest \nMountains), 29.1% in the North Central Coast, and 28.6% in the Central Highlands, compared \nwith 5.8% in the Southeast and 8.8% in the Red River Delta (Table A2.5).  \n \n\nTable A2.5: Poverty Rate in Viet Nam by Region, 1993\u20132006 \n(%) \n\nRegion \n\n1993 \n\n1998 \n\n2002 \n\n2004 \n\n2006 \n\nNorthern Mountains  \n\n81.5  \n\n64.2  \n\nNortheast  \n\nNorthwest \n\nRed River Delta  \n\nNorth Central Coast  \n\nSouth Central Coast  \n\nCentral Highlands  \n\nSoutheast  \n\nMekong Delta  \n\n \n\n \n\n62.7  \n\n74.5  \n\n47.2  \n\n70.0  \n\n37.0  \n\n47.1  \n\n \n\n \n\n29.3  \n\n48.1  \n\n34.5  \n\n52.4  \n\n12.2  \n\n36.9  \n\n43.9  \n\n38.4  \n\n68.0  \n\n22.4  \n\n43.9  \n\n25.2  \n\n51.8  \n\n10.6  \n\n23.4  \n\n35.4  \n\n29.4  \n\n58.6  \n\n12.1  \n\n31.9  \n\n19.0  \n\n33.1  \n\n5.4  \n\n15.9  \n\n30.2 \n\n25.0 \n\n49.0 \n\n8.8 \n\n29.1 \n\n12.6 \n\n28.6 \n\n5.8 \n\n10.3 \n\nViet Nam  \n16.0 \nSource: World Bank. 2007.

The  large  difference \nbetween the proportion of the population living on less than $2.0 a day based on PPP (32.9% in \n2007)  and  the  share  of  those  living  on  less  than  $1.0  a  day  based  on  PPP  (4.0%  in  2007) \nsuggests  that  the  near-poor  account  for  a  substantial  proportion  of  the  population.  A  small \nexternal  or  internal  shock  and  a  moderate  deterioration  in  the  economic  situation  could  push \nmany of these people into poverty. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nFinally, some negative trends in poverty have emerged recently. The household survey \n9. \ndata  show  that  urban  poverty  increased  between  2004  and  2006,  with  the  poverty  rate  rising \nfrom  3.6%  in  2004  to  3.9%  in  2006,  and  the  food  poverty  rate  increasing  from  0.8%  to  1.2%. \nAnecdotal evidence suggests that high inflation and, in particular, the steep rise of food prices \npushed  many  low-income  households,  especially  in  urban  areas,  into  poverty  in  2008.  As \neconomic  activity  slowed  sharply,  unemployment  increased  and  more  households,  particularly \nin rural areas, fell into poverty in the first several months of 2009. Many people from rural areas \nwho were employed in urban areas of Viet Nam or abroad lost their jobs and stopped sending \nremittances to their households. Some of them returned to their villages, even though they had \nfew alternative sources of income there.    \n\nC. \n\nPolicy Framework for Poverty Reduction  \n\n10. \nRobust economic growth has been the key driver of poverty reduction in Viet Nam, but \ngovernment  policies  and  targeted  programs  have  played  a  major  role  in  making  that  growth \npro-poor.  The  Government\u2019s  current  poverty  reduction  strategy \nthe \nSocioeconomic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010.  \n \n\nis  embedded \n\nin \n\n1. \n\nSocioeconomic Development Plan 2006\u20132010.  \n\n \n11. \nThe  Government  adopted  SEDP  2006\u20132010  in  2006.  Unlike  previous  SEDPs,  it  was \nprepared  in  an  open  and  participatory  manner  involving  extensive  consultations  with  civil \nsociety,  businesses,  and  development  agencies,  and  is  oriented  more  toward  attaining \ndevelopment  outcomes  (including  poverty  reduction)  and  less  toward  achieving  production \ntargets.  Its  targets  include  a  reduction  in  the  poverty  rate  (based  on  MOLISA\u2019s  methodology) \nfrom  22%  in  2005  to  10%\u201311%  in  2010.  SEDP  2006\u20132010  also  aspires  to  strengthen  the \nfoundations  for  environmentally  sustainable  and  socially  inclusive  economic  growth  and  a \ncontinued reduction in poverty beyond 2010. It provides for a broad range of policy reforms and \na  large  number  of  investment  projects  aimed  at  achieving  its  targets  and  goals.  The  joint \nInternational  Development  Association\u2013International  Monetary  Fund  staff  advisory  note  of \n5 December 2006  on  Viet  Nam\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  concluded  that  SEDP  2006\u20132010 \nhas the key features of a poverty reduction strategy and is likely to lead to economic growth and \npoverty reduction.2 \n\n2. \n\nSocial Protection and Targeted Programs for Poverty Reduction \n\n12. \nSEDP  2006\u20132010  recognizes  that  social  protection  and  targeted  programs  for  poverty \nreduction  are  required for  inclusive  growth.  Social  protection  expands  opportunities,  enhances \nequity,  and  protects  against  risks  and  shocks.  Targeted  programs  focus  on  particularly \ndisadvantaged groups and geographic areas. \n \n13. \nViet Nam fares reasonably well in comparison with the 30 other countries in Asia and the \nPacific, according to ADB\u2019s social protection index (SPI).3 The SPI values range from a low of \n0.01 (Papua New Guinea) to a high of 0.96 (Japan). Viet Nam\u2019s SPI of 0.38 ranks the country \n13  of  31,  just  below  Nauru  but  above  Malaysia.  The  SPI  is  a  composite  index  based  on  four \nsocial  protection  summary  indicators.  Expenditure  measures  total  expenditure  on  all  social \n                                                \n2   International Monetary Fund and International Development Association. 2006.

Coverage \nmeasures the beneficiaries of targeted social protection as a share of the reference population \ngroup,  i.e.,  the  elderly,  the  disabled,  the  unemployed,  etc.  (0.40).  Distribution  calculates  the \nnumber of beneficiaries who are poor as a share of the poor population, or efficiency of poverty \ntargeting (0.71). Impact is the average social protection expenditure for each poor person as a \nshare  of  the  national  poverty  line  (0.17).  Viet  Nam  falls  into  the  group  of  countries  with  an \naverage SPI ranking (the average for Asia is 0.36). The policy priority for countries with average \nSPIs is likely to be improving the efficiency, functioning, and targeting of current programs. The \nsocial  protection  summary  indicator  for  impact,  at  17%,  is  lower  than  the  average  of  23%  for \nAsia. \n \n14. \nSocial  Safety  Nets.  Social  safety  net  programs  (e.g.,  social  assistance  and  child \nprotection) account for about 30% of Viet Nam\u2019s total social protection expenditure. The target \ngroup coverage ratios are 65% of the poor, 100% of the disabled, and 62% of targeted children. \nViet Nam\u2019s overall social protection summary indicator for coverage, at 0.40, is high; only eight \nother  countries  have  values  higher.  In  a  decentralized  country  like  Viet  Nam,  the  amount  of \nbudgetary  resources  at the  local  level  has  a major  influence  on the  ability  to  implement  social \npolicy, deliver social services, and provide safety nets. According to the Vietnam Development \nReport  2008,  powerful  allocation  norms  have  been  set  up  to  transfer  resources  from  richer  to \npoorer provinces (on a scale much larger than similar efforts in richer countries). However, there \nhas  been  less  progress  in  the  allocation  of  provincial  resources  to  districts,  communes,  and \nbelow. In general, the quality of programs targeted at specific households is mixed. Some have \nconsiderable impact, but others are less effective. \n \nLabor  Market  Programs.  The  SPI  assessment  of  social  protection  expenditure  by \n15. \ncategory  of  program  shows  that  only  7.7%  of  the  total  goes  toward  labor  market  programs \n(direct  employment  generation,  labor  exchanges  and  other  employment  services,  skills \ndevelopment and training, and the development of labor legislation). \n \n16. \nEach  of  the  country\u2019s  63  provinces  has  a  vocational  training  center  under  the  local \ndepartment  of  labor,  invalids,  and  social  affairs.  The  Government  implements  a  National \nTargeted  Program  on  Job  Generation  and  provides  credit  through  the  National  Fund  for  Job \nCreation and the Social Policy Bank. The vocational training system is being strengthened and \ndiversified  to  meet  the  demands  of  the  labor  market.  The  Government  does  not  provide \nunemployment insurance, but it does give (i) allowances for early retirement, (ii) access to credit \nfor  opening  new  business  after  retirement,  and  (iii)  free  vocational  training  for  the  poor  in \ngovernment-run  vocational  training  centers.  In  the  ADB  SPI  analysis  of  target  group  coverage \nratios,  only  9.4%  of  the  unemployed  and  underemployed  are  covered  by  social  protection \nprograms. \n \nViet  Nam  introduced  a  minimum  wage  for  foreign-invested  companies  in  1990  and  for \n17. \ndomestic enterprises in 1993. The former varies by region; the latter is uniform throughout the \ncountry. The ratio between minimum and average wages in domestic enterprises has increased \nmoderately,  from  25%  in  1998  to  32%  in  2006,  but  minimum  wages  applying  to  foreign \ncompanies  remain  substantially  higher.  The  margin  varies  from  more  than  50%  to  more  than \n90%  depending  on the  region. This  is  incompatible  with  the  national  treatment  principle  of  the \nWorld Trade Organization. Thus, Viet Nam needs to unify the minimum wage, which will mean \nincreasing  the  domestic  enterprise  minimum  wage.  This  may  affect  employment  creation  and \nformalization.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nOld-Age Pensions. Until 1993, Viet Nam only had an old-age pension program for civil \n18. \nservants  and  workers  in  state-owned  enterprises.  The  coverage  was  extended  in  1993  to \ndomestic  and  foreign  private  enterprises  on  a  contributory  basis.  Viet  Nam  Social  Security \nadministers these programs. There is also a noncontributory scheme (administered by MOLISA) \nfor people over 85 who lack resources. The system is now undergoing major and rapid reform. \nThe first Social Insurance Law was passed in 2006, with various elements being implemented \nover 2007\u20132009. The aim is to expand coverage and ensure financial sustainability. Along with \na voluntary pension program for informal sector workers, the compulsory program applies to all \nVietnamese  working  in  any  enterprise  provided  they  have  at  least  a  3-month  contract.  To \nreceive a pension, participants must contribute for 20 years. The minimum pension is set equal \nto the minimum wage; the maximum is 75% of the average salary. Retirement age is low at 55 \nfor  women  and  60  for  men.  The  main  difference  between  the  voluntary  and  the  compulsory \nprograms  is  that  the  voluntary  scheme  does  not  have  a  ceiling  on  contributions  and  or  a \nminimum pension. \n \n19. \nParticipation in the compulsory scheme is growing steadily from its low base, with about \n8  million  active  contributors  in  2007  (18%  of  the  labor  force  and  54%  of  employment  in \nstate-owned  enterprises,  foreign  companies,  and  private  domestic  firms).  In  2007,  there  were \nabout  1.9  million  pensioners,  about  25%  of  the  population  60  years  old  and  above.  However, \nalmost half of pension spending went to the richest two quintiles, with only 2% to the poorest. \nThus, the pension system is not pro-poor. Whether the national voluntary pension program for \nthe  informal  sector  will  attract  many  members  is  not  yet  clear.  The  largest  voluntary  pension \nscheme  in  Viet Nam  operates  in  the  province  of  Nghe  An,  with  about  85,000  participants  in \n2007. \n \nTargeted  Programs  for  Poverty  Reduction.4 Viet Nam implements a host of targeted \n20. \nprograms to reach the most disadvantaged. Some provide cash support to particular vulnerable \ngroups;  others  deliver  other  forms  of  targeted  assistance  to  disadvantaged  groups  or  regions. \nThe pricing of utilities such as water can also be based on different groups\u2019 ability to pay. Cash \ntransfers  are  paid  out  by  social  guarantee  funds,  which  provide  regular  relief  to  defined \nvulnerable  groups  and  to  war  veterans  and  war  invalids.  Subsidies  are  provided  through  the \nNational  Targeted  Program  for  Poverty  Reduction  (NTPPR)  2006\u20132010,  formerly  the  Hunger \nEradication  and  Poverty  Reduction  Program.  Development  assistance  to  poor  communes  is \nmanaged through Program 135 (program for socioeconomic development in communes facing \nextreme  hardship  in  ethnic  minority  and  mountainous  areas);  Program  132  and  Program  134, \nwhich seek to provide ethnic minorities with agricultural and residential land, housing, and water \nsupply;  and  the  Support  Program  for  Fast  and  Sustainable  Poverty  Reduction  in  61  Poor \nDistricts.  These  initiatives  differ  in  the  nature  of  the  benefits  they  provide,  as  well  as  in  the \ntargeting techniques they apply to identify beneficiaries. \n \nThe  NTPPR  targets  households  that  have  been  identified  as  poor  using  the  MOLISA \n21. \nmethodology.  Activities  under  NTPPR  fall  into  three  areas:  (i)  development  of  productive \nactivities  of  the  poor,  (ii)  provision  of  access  to  basic  services,  and  (iii)  capacity  development \nand  monitoring.  The  first  area  includes  the  largest  single  component  of  the  NTPPR,  the \nprovision  of  preferential  credit.  The  second  area  focuses  on  health  care,  education,  housing, \nwater supply, and legal aid. A total of D43.5 trillion has been allocated to this program over a 5 \nyears, with 60% going to the provision of preferential credit. The central budget covers 29% of \n\n                                                \n4   This  discussion  is  summarized  from  World  Bank.  2007.  Vietnam  Development  Report  2008:  Social  Protection. \nJoint donor report to the Vietnam Consultative Group Meeting, Hanoi, 6\u20137 December 2007 (Chapter 7: Targeted \nPrograms). \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n \n39 \n\nthe envelope, with local governments and local communities expected to contribute a further 5% \nand 6%, respectively.  \n \n22. \nProgram 135 is geographically targeted. The first phase of the program allocated D700 \nmillion per year to identified communes. Poverty maps show that the communes targeted by the \nprogram were generally those with higher poverty rates. Targeting issues arise at lower levels, \nas  resource  allocation  may  favor  wealthier  villages  within  a  commune,  and  not  everyone  in  a \nvillage is necessarily poor. The second phase of Program 135 (to be implemented during 2006\u2013\n2010)  is  tackling  these  issues  by  requiring  the  inclusion  of  both  poorer  villages  within  the \npoorest \u201czone III\u201d communes and the poorest villages in the less-poor \u201czone II\u201d communes. \n \n23. \nThe  Support  Program  for  Fast  and  Sustainable  Poverty  Reduction  in  61  Poor  Districts \nwas  approved  in  December  2008.  It  targets  61  districts  where  the  poverty  rate  based  on \nMOLISA's methodology was more than 50% in 2006. The program aims to reduce the poverty \nrate  in  the  target  districts  to  less  than  40%  by  2010,  to  the  corresponding  provincial  average \npoverty  rate  by  2015,  and  to  the  corresponding  regional  average  poverty  rate  by  2020.  The \nactivities  under  the  program  include  providing  free  rice  to  poor  households;  supporting \nagriculture, forestry, fishery, and food processing businesses (especially those being set up or \nrun by poor households); improving the quality of and access to vocational training; developing \ntransport  and  irrigation  infrastructure;  and  providing  incentives  to  businesses for  investing  and \ncreating jobs in the target districts. The total cost of the program for 2009\u20132020 is estimated at \nD160  trillion,  of  which  D10.5  trillion  was  transferred  from  the  central  to  local  budgets  in  early \n2009.  \n\n \n\n

Business Development \n\nStrengthen the financial management of \nstate-owned enterprises (SOEs) and their \ninvestments in other entities, defining the \nlevel of such investments \n\nCompleted. The Government has adopted\u2014through Decree \nNo. 09/2009/ND-CP dated 5 February 2009\u2014a new \nregulation on financial management of SOEs, which limits \nSOEs' investments in non-core businesses and prohibits an \nSOE from investing in a company whose senior staff member \nor major shareholder is related to a senior staff member of \nthe SOE.a  \n \nThe action has been included in the policy matrix for Poverty \nReduction Support Credit (PRSC) 8 and is covered by \nsubprogram 2 of the Support for the Implementation of the \nPoverty Reduction Program (SIPRP) V.  \n\nIn progress. The state ownerships rights in some equitized \nSOEs and Vietcombank (one of the two equitized state-\nowned commercial banks) has been transferred to SCIC. \nHowever, the transfer of the state ownership rights in some \nother equitized SOEs to SCIC has been delayed because of \nlimited institutional capacity of SCIC to exercise these rights. \nOne of the components of the SOE Reform and Corporate \nGovernance Facility, a program loan in the 2009 indicative \npipeline of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Viet Nam, \naims to strengthen SCIC's capacity to exercise state \nownership rights in equitized SOEs. \n \nThe action has not been included in the policy matrix for \nPRSC 8 and has been retained as a tentative action under \nsubprogram 3 of SIPRP V.  \n\nIn progress. The equitization of Vietcombank was completed \nin 2008 and that of Vietinbank was completed in July 2009. \nUnfavorable market conditions have caused delays in the \nequitization of other SOCBs and the sale of shares of the \nequitized SOCBs to strategic investors. \n \nThe action has not been included in the policy matrix for \nPRSC 8 and has been retained as a tentative action under \nsubprogram 3 of SIPRP V.  \n\nIn progress. As required by Decision 493/2005/QD-NHNN of \nthe State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV), all commercial banks have \nestablished an internal credit rating system. The SBV has \ncertified the internal credit ratings system of several \ncommercial banks. The Government and development \nagencies participating in the PRSC process have agreed to \ncontinue dialogue on this subject in conjunction with PRSC 9. \n \nThe action has not been included in the policy matrix for \nPRSC 8 and has been retained as a tentative action under \nsubprogram 3 of SIPRP V.  \n \n\nTransfer state ownership rights in \nequitized SOEs to the State Capital \nInvestment Corporation (SCIC) \n\nComplete the equitization of four state-\nowned commercial banks (SOCBs), with \nthe participation of strategic investors \n\nCertify the internal credit rating system of \nall banks and approve inspection \nmanuals \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n45 \n\nPrepare a revised law on the central bank \nfocusing its mandate on, and enhancing \nits autonomy in regard to, monetary \npolicy and financial sector stability \n\nEstablish a national business registry with \nunique number for business, tax, \nstatistics, and seal agencies \n \n\nAdopt guidelines to govern the operations \nof the Viet Nam Competition Council \n \n\nRevise the legal framework for the \npromotion of small and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs) and enable better \nlinks with large-scale industries \n\nAdopt a pricing system for electricity from \nrenewable energy and provide incentives \nfor government procurement of energy-\nefficient equipment \n\nCompleted. The Government has prepared\u2014in consultation \nwith development agencies\u2014a revised law on the SBV, which \nmakes the SBV's mandate more focused on monetary policy \nand financial sector stability and increases its autonomy in \nformulating monetary policy. \n \nThe action has been included in the policy matrix for PRSC 8 \nand is covered by subprogram 2 of SIPRP V. \n\nIn progress. With technical assistance from Norway and the \nUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization, Viet \nNam is developing a computerized national business registry, \nwhich is expected to become operational in 2011.  \n \nBecause the action has not been included in the policy matrix \nfor PRSC 8 and will be covered by Small and Medium \nEnterprise Development Program Loan II (included in ADB's \n2009 indicative pipeline for Viet Nam), it has been excluded \nfrom the policy matrix of SIPRP V.  \n\nIn progress. The Ministry of Industry and Trade is drafting \nregulations on the operations and the organizational structure \nof the Viet Nam Competition Council. The regulations are \nexpected to be adopted in the second half of 2009. \n \nThe action has not been included in the policy matrix for \nPRSC 8 and has been retained as a tentative action under \nsubprogram 3 of SIPRP V.  \n\nIn progress. Since the Government and development \nagencies held the final round of consultations on the policy \nmatrix of PRSC 8 in May 2009, Viet Nam has made \nconsiderable headway in improving the legal framework for \nSME development. In particular, the procedure for obtaining \nbusiness seals has been simplified significantly effective 1 \nJune 2008. In June 2009, the Government issued a decree \non promoting SME development. The decree gives detailed \nlegal definitions of SMEs and micro-enterprises and calls for \nthe establishment of an SME Development Fund, which will \nfinance programs aimed at fostering SME development.  \n \nBecause the action has not been included in the policy matrix \nfor PRSC 8 and will be covered by Small and Medium \nEnterprise Development Program Loan II, it has been \nexcluded from the policy matrix of SIPRP V. \n\nCompleted. A new pricing system for electricity, which \nmakes the production of electricity from renewable energy \ncommercially more attractive, was adopted in July 2008 and \nbecame effective on 1 January 2009. Incentives for \ngovernment procurement of energy-efficient equipment were \nintroduced in March 2009. \n \nThe action has been included in the policy matrix for PRSC 8 \nand is covered by subprogram 2 of SIPRP V.  \n\nAdopt user charges designed to better \nmanage demand for infrastructure \n\nIn progress. Waste water charges based on cost recovery \nhave been adopted, and electricity tariffs have been adjusted \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nservices \n\nIssue a time-bound action plan for the \nimplementation of commitments to the \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) \n\nComplete the legal framework enabling \nthe improved provision of logistics \nservices, including multi-modal transport \n\nAdopt standards for the certifications of \nhealth care practitioners and the \nclassification of private health facilities \n\nEstablish regulatory and institutional \nframeworks for monitoring the \nperformance of health care providers \n \n\nFormulate an education development \nstrategy for the period up to 2020 \nfocusing on the equity of learning \noutcomes and the relevance of contents \n\n \n\nupward to ensure cost recovery. Tentative action 3.1 (issue \nguidelines for efficient use of water resources to accompany \nthe irrigation service fee waiver policy) under subprogram 3 of \nSIPRP V will address the issue of cost recovery in irrigation. \n \nThe action has not been included in the policy matrix for \nPRSC 8 and has been retained as a tentative action under \nsubprogram 3 of SIPRP V.   \n\nThe action has not been included in the policy matrix for \nPRSC 8 and has been excluded from the policy matrix of \nSIPRP V. It was concluded during the consultations on the \npolicy matrix for PRSC 8 that a time-bound action plan for \nimplementing Viet Nam's commitments to WTO was not \nneeded any longer. The arrangements the country had put in \nplace were adequate to ensure timely and full implementation \nof its WTO commitments.  \n\nIn progress. The Ministry of Transportation has drafted a \ndecree on multimodal transport, which is intended to fill the \ngaps in the existing legal framework for multi-modal transport \nand bring it in line with the Framework Agreement on \nMultimodal Transport of the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations. The decree is expected to be adopted in late 2009 or \nearly 2010. \n \nThe action has not been included in the policy matrix of \nPRSC 8 and has been retained as a tentative action under \nsubprogram 3 of SIPRP V.   \n\n2. Social Inclusion \n\nIn progress. The Government is drafting\u2014in consultation \nwith development agencies\u2014a law on medical examination \nand treatment, which is expected to be adopted in late 2009. \nThe law will provide a legal framework for the certification of \nheath care practitioners and the classification of private \nhealth facilities. However, what standards for the certification \nof health care practitioners are most suitable for Viet Nam is \nstill being debated.      \n \nThe action has not been included in the policy matrix of \nPRSC 8 and has been retained as a tentative action under \nsubprogram 3 of SIPRP V.   \n\nThe action has not been included in the policy for PRSC 8 \nand has been excluded from the policy matrix of SIPRP V \nbecause it can only be carried out after the previous action is \ncompleted.  \nCompleted. Government has prepared\u2014through extensive \nconsultations within the Government as well as with the civil \nsociety, development agencies, and other stakeholders\u2014an \neducation development strategy for the period up to 2020, \nwhich attaches particular importance to the equity of leaning \noutcomes and the relevance of contents. \n \nThe action has been included in the policy matrix for PRSC 8 \nand is covered by subprogram 2 of SIPRP V.  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n47 \n\nFinalize and start implementing the road \nmap for the education management \ninformation system \n \n\nRestructure irrigation management \ncompanies with improved service \norientation and financial viability \n \n\nDevelop a unified national sanitation \nstrategy and encourage greater \nparticipation by communes and the \nprivate sector in sanitation \n\nApprove a national target program for \nadapting to the climate change and \nallocate institutional responsibilities for its \nimplementation \n\nEstablish national and regional pollution \nmonitoring systems to enable results-\nbased environmental planning \n\n3. Natural Resource Management \n\nIn progress. With technical assistance from Belgium, Viet \nNam is developing a road map for a unified education \nmanagement information system, which will integrate various \nexisting education information systems. \n \nThe action has not been included in the policy matrix for \nPRSC 8 and has been retained as a tentative action under \nsubprogram 3 of SIPRP V.  \n\nThe action has not been included in the policy matrix for \nPRSC 8 and has been replaced with an action on irrigation \nservices, which addresses an important issue affecting ADB's \noperations in Viet Nam, has been included in the policy matrix \nof PRSC 8 (at ADB's request), is covered by subprogram 2 of \nSIPRP V, and will help ensure financial viability of irrigation \nmanagement companies. \n\nThe action has been replaced with the tentative action on \nwater conservation under subprogram 3, which is a follow-up \nto the action on irrigation services under subprogram 2 and \nhas been included in the list of triggers for PRSC 9 (at ADB's \nrequest). The Government has decided to develop separate \nprograms on urban and rural sanitation instead of a unified \nnational sanitation strategy. It has adopted a program on \nwater supply and sanitation in the rural areas.   \nCompleted. The Government has adopted\u2014through \nDecision No. 158/QD-TTg dated 2 December 2008\u2014the \nNational Targeted Program for Responding to the Climate \nChange and assigned institutional responsibilities for its \nimplementation. \n \nThe action has been included in the policy matrix for PRSC 8 \nand is covered by subprogram 2 of SIPRP V.  \n\nIn progress. The Government has approved\u2014through \nDecision No. 16/2007/QD-TTg dated 29 January 2007\u2014the \nMaster Plan for Establishing the National Monitoring Network \nfor Natural Resources and Environment. In pursuance of this \ndecision, regional monitoring centers have been set up in \nalmost all provinces. In addition, several national monitoring \ncenters, which focus on river catchment areas and pollution \nhotspots, have been established. However, this extensive \nnetwork of monitoring centers is not functioning well because \nof financing and staff constraints. The Ministry of Natural \nResources and Environments is preparing a proposal aimed \nat increasing the effectiveness of the network, in particular, by \nconsolidating available funds and human resources in a \nsmaller number of monitoring centers and laboratories.    \n \nThe action has not been included in the policy matrix of \nPRSC 8 and has been retained as a tentative action under \nsubprogram 3 of SIPRP V. \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\nEstablish a legal framework for \nstrengthening urban planning and urban \ninfrastructure management \n\nIntegrate sector policies and national \ntarget programs at the commune level, \nemphasizing participation at all stages \n\nFormulate a public debt management law \nconsolidating the management of \ndomestic and external debt \n\nAdopt public sector financial reporting \nstandards in line with international \nstandards \n \n\nConduct user-feedback surveys to \nassess the quality of public services \n \n\nDevelop a road map for improving the \nquality of public services, taking into \naccount the findings of the surveys \n \n\n \n\n4. Governance \n\nIn progress. With the aim of strengthening the legal \nframework for urban planning and urban infrastructure \nmanagement, the Ministry of Construction has drafted an \nUrban Planning Law and proposed amendments to the \nHousing Law, Land Law, national urban development \nprogram for the period 2009-2020, and several government \ndecrees and resolutions concerning urban planning and \nurban infrastructure management. However, it is uncertain \nwhen these amendments will be adopted and when the \nUrban Planning Law will be enacted. \n \nThe action has not been included in the policy matrix of \nPRSC 8 and has been retained as a tentative action under \nsubprogram 3 of SIPRP V.   \n\nIn progress. Sector policies and national target programs are \nbeing integrated in some communes on a pilot basis. \n \nThe action has not been included in the policy matrix of \nPRSC 8 and has been retained as a tentative action under \nsubprogram 3 of SIPRP V.  \n\nCompleted. The law on public debt was passed by the \nNational Assembly in June 2009 and will become effective on \n1 January 2010. It consolidates\u2014to a large degree\u2014the \nmanagement of domestic and external public debt in one \ndepartment within the Ministry of Finance. \n \nThe action has been included in the policy matrix for PRSC 8 \nand is covered by subprogram 2 of SIPRP V.   \n\nIn progress. A new public sector reporting system, which is \nin line with international standards, is being piloted at the \nMinistry of Finance and several line agencies, as part of the  \nPublic Finance Management Reform Project financed by the \nWorld Bank. \n \nThe action has not been included in the policy matrix of \nPRSC 8 and has been retained as a tentative action under \nsubprogram 3 of SIPRP V.  \n\nIn progress. The Government is considering various options \nfor conducting user-feedback surveys on the quality of public \nservices. The surveys are expected to be conducted in 2010. \n \nThe action has not been included in the policy matrix for \nPRSC 8 and has been retained as a tentative action under \nsubprogram 3 of SIPRP V. \n\nThe action can only be carried out after the previous action is \ncompleted. It has therefore been replaced with the tentative \naction on civil service reform under subprogram 3, which is a \nfollow-up to the action on civil service reform under \nsubprogram 2. \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n49 \n\nPrepare a revised press law to encourage \naccurate, objective, and responsible \nreporting on corruption \n\nAdopt a comprehensive anticorruption \nstrategy \n\nIn progress. The Government is drafting\u2014in consultation \nwith development agencies and other stakeholders\u2014a \nrevised press law aimed at encouraging accurate, objective, \nand responsible reporting on corruption. The preparation of \nthe law is expected to be completed by mid-2010, and the \nNational Assembly is expected to pass the law in late 2010 or \nin 2011. \n \nThe action has not been included in the policy matrix of \nPRSC 8 and has been retained as a tentative action under \nsubprogram 3 of SIPRP V.  \nCompleted. The Government has adopted\u2014through \nResolution No. 21/NQ-CP dated 12 May 2009\u2014a national \nanticorruption strategy for the period up to 2020 and an action \nplan for the implementation of the national anticorruption \nstrategy. The strategy provides for a wide range of measures \nto combat corruption, including preventive and demand-side \nmeasures.

ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.   Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n \nViet  Nam\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  is  embedded  in  the  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan  (SEDP)  2006\u20132010.  SEDP \n2006\u20132010 provides for a broad range of policy reforms and a large number of investment projects aimed at reducing poverty. \nOne  of  its  targets  is  to  reduce  the  poverty  rate  (based  on  the  methodology  of  the  Ministry  of  Labor,  Invalids,  and  Social \nAffairs)  from  20.2%  in  2005  to  10%\u201311%  in  2010.  SEDP  2006\u20132010  also  aspires  to  strengthen  the  foundations  for \nenvironmentally sustainable and socially inclusive economic growth and a continued reduction in poverty beyond 2010. The \njoint  International  Development  Association\u2013International  Monetary  Fund  staff  advisory  note  of  5 December 2006  on  Viet \nNam\u2019s poverty reduction strategy concluded that SEDP 2006\u20132010 has the key features of a poverty reduction strategy and is \nlikely to lead to economic growth and poverty reduction.a \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country strategy  and program  (2007\u20132010)  for  Viet  Nam  is  aligned  with  SEDP  2006\u2013\n2010. It provides for assistance to the Government in both carrying out the policy reforms and implementing the investment \nprojects that are needed for the successful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010. Its primary focus is on promoting business-\nled, pro-poor economic growth by developing infrastructure, improving the business environment, strengthening financial and \nrelated  market  institutions,  and  building  up  human  capital.  The  country  strategy  and  program  also  aims  to  foster  social \ninclusiveness, enhance management of the environment, and improve governance.b \n \nIn 2008, ADB approved the Support for the Implementation of the Poverty Reduction Program (SIPRP) V, a program cluster \nwith three chronologically ordered subprograms, and a loan for its subprogram 1.c  SIPRP V is intended to help\u2014through the \npoverty reduction support credit (PRSC) process led by the World Bank\u2014the Government carry out policy reforms needed for \nthe  successful  implementation  of  SEDP  2006\u20132010.  Subprogram  1  of  SIPRP  V  provided  parallel  financing  with  the  World \nBank's PRSC 7, and subprogram 2 will provide parallel financing with PRSC 8 within the framework of the PRSC process.  \n \nThe policy reforms supported by SIPRP V and, in particular by its subprogram 2, closely match the priorities of ADB's country \nstrategy and program (2007\u20132010) for Viet Nam. They fall into the following four broad reform areas: \n \n(i) \n\nBusiness  development.  Improving  financial  management  and  corporate  governance  of  state-owned  enterprises \n(SOEs), developing the financial and private sectors, and improving the quality of infrastructure services. \nSocial inclusion. Improving the quality of health care and education and access to these services.  \nNatural  resource  management.  Strengthening  the  management  of  water  resources  and  the  protection  of  the \nenvironment. \nGovernance.  Improving  planning  processes,  strengthening  public  financial  management  and  pubic  administration, \nand reducing corruption. \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nAlthough Viet Nam made remarkable progress in poverty reduction in the past 15\u201320 years, much remains to be done. The \nabsolute  number of people  living  in  poverty is  still  large.  The  incidence  of  poverty  varies significantly  across  regions  and  is \nrelatively high in the rural areas and among ethnic minorities. Since the number of near-poor people is large, the vulnerability \nof  the  population  to  poverty  is  high.  A  high  inflation  rate  and,  in  particular,  the  steep  rise  in  food  prices  pushed  many  low-\nincome  households,  especially  in  urban  areas,  into  poverty  in  2008.  As  economic  activity  slowed  sharply,  unemployment \nincreased and more households, particularly in rural areas, fell into poverty in the first several months of 2009.  \n \n2.  Design Features  \n \nSubprogram 2 of SIPRP V will help Viet Nam resolve the remaining issues in poverty reduction by helping the Government \ncarry out a broad range of policy reforms needed for the successful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010. These reforms will \nimprove governance, develop businesses, and stimulate economic growth. Business development and economic growth will \ncreate  news  jobs,  raise  incomes,  and  make  more  resources  available  for  social  protection.  Poor  regions,  ethnic  minorities, \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n61 \n\nand poor and near-poor people in rural and urban areas are likely to benefit from new jobs, higher incomes, and increased \navailability of resources for social protection. The reforms supported by subprogram 2 of SIPRP V will also make growth more \nsocially inclusive by improving the quality of health care and education as well as access to these services. \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending \n\nThe  main  positive  impact  on  poverty  of  the  policy  reforms  supported  by  subprogram  2  of  SIPRP  V  will  be  indirect.  These \nreforms will help reduce poverty in Viet Nam primarily by improving the allocation of scarce resources and fostering socially \ninclusive economic growth.  \n \nSome of the policy actions under the subprogram will also make a direct contribution to poverty reduction. In particular, action \n1.4  (adopt  a  pricing  system  for  electricity  from  renewable  energy  and  provide  incentives  for  government  procurement  of \nenergy-efficient equipment) will help reduce poverty in areas with untapped renewable energy resources and high incidence \nof  poverty  (e.g.,  mountainous  areas  inhabited  by  ethnic  minorities)  by  making  the  production  of  electricity  from  renewable \nenergy  commercially  more  attractive.  Action  2.1  (formulate  an  education  development  strategy  for  the  period  up  to  2020 \nfocusing  on  the  equity  of  learning  outcomes  and  the  relevance  of  contents)  will  help  improve  access  of  the  poor,  ethnic \nminorities, and other disadvantaged groups of the population to education and ensure that there are no significant differences \nin learning outcomes among children of different backgrounds (i.e., children from poor households do as well as children from \nrich households, children from remote areas do as well as children from other areas, and ethnic minority children do as well \nas  ethnic  majority  children).  Action  3.1  (issue  regulations  aimed  to  ensure  financial  sustainability  of  irrigation  services  and \nprovide financial relief for poor farmers) will make irrigation services more affordable for poor farmers. Millions of Vietnamese \npeople  (including  the  poor)  who  are  expected  to  be  adversely  affected  by  the  climate  change  will  benefit  from  action  3.2 \n(approve  a  national  target  program  for  adapting  to  climate  change  and  allocate  institutional  responsibilities  for  its \nimplementation). Action 4.1 (conduct a midterm review of SEDP 2006\u20132010 and strengthen the result-based approach in the \nmonitoring and evaluation framework for planning) will help make future SEDPs more effective in reducing poverty. \n \nThe  policy  reforms  supported  by  subprogram  2  of  SIPRP  will  help  Viet  Nam  make  further  progress  on  the  targets  of  the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDG) concerning extreme poverty, hunger, and the incidence of malaria and other diseases, \nwhich  Viet  Nam  has  already  achieved.  The  reforms  will  also  help  Viet  Nam  attain  the  MDG  targets  pertaining  to  primary \nschool completion, gender equality in education, and environmental sustainability. \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \n \nWhile the policy actions under subprogram 2 of SIPRP V are likely to affect all population groups in Viet Nam, they are likely \nto have a relatively larger impact on the poor, ethnic minorities, rural population, and people who can be adversely affected by \nclimate  change.  The  reason  is  that  the  actions  are  aimed  at  reducing  poverty  by  fostering  socially  inclusive  and \nenvironmentally sustainable economic growth, and the incidence of poverty is high among ethnic minorities and in the rural \nareas.    \n \nThe  poverty  rate  based  on  the  methodology  of  the  Ministry  of  Labor,  Invalids, and  Social  Affairs  suggests that 11.3 million \npeople  lived  below  the  official  poverty  line  in  2008.  According  to  the  household  survey  data,  13.5  million  people  lived  in \npoverty  and  5.7 million  people  suffered  from  hunger  in  2006.  Rural  areas  accounted  for  73.3%  of  the  total  population  but \n93.6% of the poor. Ethnic minorities made up 13.5% of the total population but 44.4% of the poor.d \n \nClimate change is expected to affect millions of people in Viet Nam. According to one study, a sea level rise of 1 meter would \naffect 11% of Viet Nam's population. The proportion of people adversely affected by the sea level rise would be particularly \nhigh in the Mekong River and Sun Red River deltas.e \n \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of consultations and participation during the project preparation. \n \nThe Viet Nam Development Report 2007 provides analytical underpinnings for SIPRP V and, in particular, it subprogram 2. \nThe  report  was  jointly  prepared  by  16  development  agencies  (including  ADB)  in  2006.  The  report  analyzes  medium-term \ndevelopment challenges facing Viet Nam and reviews the Government\u2019s strategy for overcoming these challenges (as set out \nin SEDP 2006\u20132010). It also proposes a set of policy actions aimed at successful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010. Some \nof these actions were covered by subprogram 1 of SIPRP V. \n \nSubprogram  2  of  SIPRP  V  is  to  support  actions  included  in  the  policy  matrix  for  PRSC  8,  focusing  on  those  actions  that \ncomplement actions supported by ADB\u2019s other program loans to Viet Nam or are otherwise important to ADB\u2019s operations in \n\n \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nthe  country.  In  late  2008,  the  development  agencies  participating  in  the  PRSC  process  (including  ADB)  agreed  among \nthemselves as well as with the Government, civil society, and private sector on the initial policy matrix for PRSC 8. Between \nDecember 2008 and May 2009, the development agencies and the Government held several rounds of consultations on the \ninitial policy matrix for PRSC 8. In May 2009, they agreed on the final policy matrix for PRSC 8. The actions to be covered by \nsubprogram 2 of SIPRP were selected\u2014in consultation with the Government and various units within ADB\u2014from the actions \nincluded in the final policy matrix of PRSC 8. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n\n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\nC.  Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues. \n \nViet Nam has made good progress in eliminating gender disparities in recent years and is on track to achieve the MDG target \nfor gender equality in education. However, some gender disparities remain. Notably, only 10.9% of land use certificates for \nagricultural land and 31.3% of land use certificates for forest land bore the name of both husband and wife in 2006. More boys \nthan girls were enrolled in primary and secondary education, whereas more girls than boys were enrolled in vocational and \nuniversity education in the 2006\u20132007 school year.f While children from poor households have less education and health care \nopportunities  than  children  from  rich  households,  girls  from  poor  households  have  even  less  opportunities  than  boys  from \npoor households. Living conditions in mountainous and other remote areas are particularly harsh for girls and women.   \n \nSome  policy  actions  under  subprogram  2  of  SIPRP  V  will  help  eliminate  remaining  gender  gaps.  For  example,  action  1.4 \n(adopt a pricing system for electricity from renewable energy and provide incentives for government procurement of energy-\nefficient equipment) will raise living standards of girls and women in mountainous and other remote areas by stimulating the \nproduction of electricity from renewable energy in those areas and improving girls and women's access to modern education \nand  health  facilities  and  equipment  (such  as  computers  and  the  internet).  Action  2.1  (formulate  an  education  development \nstrategy  for  the  period  up  to  2020  focusing  on  the  equity  of  learning  outcomes  and  the  relevance  of  contents)  will  help \neliminate the remaining disparities in education. Farm households headed by women will benefit more from action 3.1 (issue \nregulations  to  ensure  financial  sustainability  of  irrigation  services  and  provide  financial  relief  for  poor  farmers)  than  farm \nhouseholds headed by men because the incidence of poverty among the former is higher than among the latter. Action 4.1. \n(conduct a midterm review of SEDP 2006\u20132010 and strengthen the resulted-based approach in the monitoring and evaluation \nframework for planning) helps make future SEDPs more effective in addressing gender issues. \n \n2.

However, \nnone of the actions under the subprogram is centered \non ethnic minorities or has an adverse impact on ethnic \nminorities. \nBy improving the allocation of scarce resources and \nfostering economic growth, the policy actions under \nsubprogram 2 of SIPRP V will create new jobs. In \nparticular, action 1.1 (strengthen financial management \nof SOEs, limiting their investments in other entities, \ndefining the level of such investments) will make more \nfinancial resources available to small and medium-\nsized enterprises, which are likely to utilize these \nresources more efficiently and create more new jobs \nthan SOEs.   \n \nAction 2.1 (prepare an education development strategy \nfor the period up to 2020 focusing on the equity of \nlearning outcomes and the relevance of contents) will \nimprove access of the poor and disadvantaged to \neducation. \n \nAction 3.1 (issue regulations aimed to ensure financial \nsustainability of irrigation services and provide financial \nrelief for poor farmers) will make irrigation services \nmore affordable for poor farmers. \n \n  \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action \n   No Action \n\n  Plan \n  Other Action \n   No Action \n\nSignificant positive \nimpact \n\nLabor \n\n Employment  \nopportunities \n Labor retrenchment \n Core labor \n\nstandards \n \n\nNo impact \n \n\nOther Risks and/or \nVulnerabilities \nHIV/AIDS \nHuman \n    Trafficking \n\n Others(conflict, \npolitical instability, etc), \nplease specify \n\nAffordability \n\nSignificant positive \nimpact \n\n   Action \n   No Action \n\nIV.
