The  incidence  of \npoverty today is higher than a decade ago. Among the root causes for \nthe poor development performance is a crisis of governance at all \nlevels of government. There is ample evidence that improvement in \npublic  sector  governance  and  resource  management  yields \nconsiderable development gains. \n \nPakistan has initiated substantial governance reforms over the past 3 \nyears. Devolution of powers to local governments has been at the \ncenter of these reforms. This has significantly impacted on provincial \nresponsibilities  at  all  stages  of  public  service  delivery.  Whereas \nprimary responsibility for service delivery in many areas now lies with \nlocal governments, provincial governments have to adjust to a new \nrole  with  a  focus  on  policy  setting,  financing,  monitoring,  and \noversight,  and  have  to  realign  their  systems,  procedures,  and \ngovernance structures accordingly. The elections in October 2002 \nhave broadened the mandate to further the reform agenda. Reforms \nin Punjab, the country\u2019s largest province with more than half of the \ncountry\u2019s population and economic activity, are therefore expected to \nhave a far-reaching impact on the country and its people as a whole.  \n \n  Objectives and  The goal of the Program is to achieve targeted improvements in \n  Scope   socioeconomic  indicators  in  Punjab,  as  outlined  in  the  federal \n  Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), through \n  efficient  and  sustainable  delivery  of  public  services  that  are \nresponsive to the dynamic needs of Punjab\u2019s society. The Program \nwill complement and integrate at the provincial level with various \nother governance-related initiatives anchored in the PRSP, including \nthose  for  fiscal  devolution,  decentralized  social  service  delivery, \nfinancial reporting and auditing, and gender reform. \n \nThe purpose and policy objectives of the Program are to assist the \ngovernment  of  Punjab  through  reforms  in  governance  structures, \nsystems, and processes to (i) strengthen its provincial finances, (ii) \nrealign provincial institutions for pro-poor service delivery, and (iii) \ncreate opportunities for growth and income generation in the private \nsector. \n ", "  iii \nConsidering the comprehensive nature and interlinkages inherent in \nreforms  that  seek  to  address  governance  and  public  resource \nmanagement  issues,  and  the  medium-term  nature  of  the  reform \nprocess,  the  PRMP  will  be  structured  in  three  sequential \nsubprograms under the program cluster modality. The emphasis of \nsubprogram 1 will be on reforming provincial finances through fiscal \nrestructuring  and  financial  management.  Subprogram  1  will  also \ninitiate  reforms  of  processes  and  institutions  for  pro-poor  service \ndelivery  that  aim  to  create  opportunities  for  growth  and  income \ngeneration  through  private  sector  development,  which  will  be \ndeepened further under subprograms 2 and 3. In total, 22 outcomes \nhave been identified, to be achieved fully at the end of the program \ncluster  period  in  2008.  Under  each  subprogram,  time-bound \nachievement targets toward reaching the outcomes are formulated, \nwith progress measurable through specified actions.  \n \n  Poverty  Poverty Intervention \n  Classification   \n   \n  Thematic  Primary:       Good Governance \n  Classification  Secondary:  Private Sector Development \n   \n  Environmental  Category C \n  Classification \n \n  Program Loan   \n \n  Amount and  The PRMP adopts the program cluster modality and comprises three \n Terms  subprograms.  Under  each  subprogram,  quick-disbursing  program \n  loan  will  be  provided  to  finance  adjustment  costs  and  support \n  implementation of agreed measures, with a combined lending volume \nof up to $500 million for the program cluster. \n \nUnder the first subprogram, a loan of \u00a521,761,000,000 ($200 million \nequivalent) will be provided from the ordinary capital resources of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB)  to Pakistan under ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will \nhave a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an interest \nrate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based lending \nfacility; a front-end fee of 0.5%; a commitment charge of 0.75% per \nannum; and other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan \nAgreement. \n \nThe Government of Pakistan will onlend the proceeds of the loan in \nlocal currency to the government of Punjab, at terms similar to those \ngiven by ADB. \n \nEach  subsequent  subprogram  loan  will  be  processed  upon  the \nsuccessful implementation of the previous subprogram. Subprogram \n2 will be presented for ADB board consideration, with amounts and \nterms based on progress in implementing subprogram 1. Release \nconditions  for  subprogram  2  will  be  formulated  to  reflect  the \n   ", "iv   \nconditions  for  subprogram  2  will  be  formulated  to  reflect  the \nGovernment\u2019s progress in achieving the various outcomes under the \nprogram cluster. Subprogram 3 will be processed in a similar manner.  \n \n  Program Period  The program cluster will be implemented over a period of about 5 \n  and Tranching  years, by 30 June 2008. Each subprogram will be implemented over \n  a period of about 1-2 years. Subprogram 1 will cover the period to 31 \n  December 2004.  \n   \nThe  release  of  loan  proceeds  under  subprogram  1  will  be \nperformance  based  in  two  tranches  of  $100 million  each  upon \nmeeting specified achievement targets, after loan effectiveness, and \nbefore the end of the implementation period of subprogram 1. All first \ntranche achievement targets specified in the policy matrix have been \nmet. \n \n  Executing  The  Planning  and  Development  Department  (P&DD)  will  be  the \n  Agency  executing agency for the program cluster. P&DD has established and \nfully staffed a program management unit (PMU) for the PRMP to \nfacilitate and monitor overall program implementation and administer \nthe utilization of loan proceeds. The PMU will coordinate with the \nvarious implementing agencies to ensure compliance with agreed \nactions and conditions. The PMU will also function as the secretariat \nto a high-level steering committee, chaired by the chief secretary of \nthe government of Punjab, that will provide overall guidance and \noversight,  be  responsible  for  interdepartmental  and  policy \ncoordination, and liaise with the federal Government to ensure that \nthe  Program  is  in  line  with  national  structural  adjustment  and \ngovernance initiatives. \n \n  Procurement  The loan will finance foreign exchange costs (excluding local duties \nand taxes) of imports procured in and from ADB\u2019s member countries. \nPakistan, as the Borrower, will certify that the value of eligible imports \nexceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the \nprogram loan in a given period. ADB will have the right to audit the \nuse of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s \ncertification. \n \nCounterpart   The local currency counterpart funds, to be generated out of the loan \nFunds  proceeds, will be used to finance the cost of structural adjustment, \n  including  the  establishment  of  funds  and  facilities  as  well  as \nmeasures under the PRMP that create sustainable fiscal space for \nfinancing  high-priority  social  and  human  development  programs \ntargeted at the poor. Specifically, the proceeds of subprogram 1 will \nbe used to restructure provincial debt through retirement of high-\ninterest \u201ccash development loans\u201d by at least PRs7 billion, and any \nother  cost  directly  related  to  the  implementation  of  the  program, \nincluding capitalization of the General Provident Fund. The Borrower \nwill certify the utilization of counterpart funds in line with the loan \nagreements through audited statements acceptable to ADB. \n ", "  v\nTechnical Assistance  A TA loan, for a total  of $4 million equivalent, will be provided for \nLoan for Supporting  supporting  public  resource  management  reforms  in  Punjab  from \nPublic Resource  ADB\u2019s Special  Funds resources. The loan will have a term of 32 \nManagement Reforms in  years, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per \nPunjab  annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; and \n  such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft TA Loan \nAgreement. \n \n \nThis TA will support studies and capacity-building measures in eight \nareas, including (i) revenue and tax administration reform; (ii) public \nexpenditure  and  financial  management;  (iii) contingent  liability \nmanagement and pension reform; (iv) strategic planning systems and \nchange management; (v) human resources management; (vi) land \nregistration  reform;  (vii) public  sector  organization  reform;  and \n(viii) support for implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. \n \nThe total cost of the TA is estimated to be $5.55 million equivalent, \ncomprising $0.84 million in foreign exchange costs and $4.71 million \nequivalent in local currency costs. ADB will finance the full foreign \nexchange costs and $3.16 million equivalent in local currency costs. \n \nProgram Benefits and  The  Program  is  expected  to  yield  high  benefits  by  supporting  a \nBeneficiaries  comprehensive adjustment in public service delivery, which should \n  positively affect the livelihood of the more than 80 million people that \n  live in Punjab, including the 33% who are poor.  \n \nIdentifiable benefits will accrue over the medium term in line with the \noutcomes  detailed  in  the  program  framework  and  policy  matrix. \nSpecific and immediate impacts of subprogram 1 will relate to fiscal \nrestructuring and utilization of loan proceeds for debt restructuring, \nwhich will create about PRs1 billion of additional fiscal space per \nannum in a sustainable manner. In addition, a number of specific \nactions directly targeted at the poor are included and quantified in the \npolicy matrix. \n \nThe impact on labor markets, prices, net public transfers, and access \nto public goods and services is expected to be positive in the long \nrun. There are no significant adverse impacts directly associated with \nthe  Program,  although  some  adjustment  may  take  place  in  the \nprovincial civil service.  \n \nRisks and Safeguards  The success and impact of the Program depend on a number of \n  assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks. Mitigating measures \n  have been put in place as appropriate. \n   \n  Political  and  Continuity  Risks.  Pakistan  in  the  past  has  faced \n  considerable implementation delays in agreed programs, often linked \n  to a change in government (which have occurred frequently over the \n  past  decade).  Opposition  to  reform  has  often  been  for  political \nmotives,  in  particular  when  unpopular  measures  related  to \nprivatization or reduction of subsidies were involved. Much of the \nopposition stems from misinformation about the real impacts and lack \n   ", "vi   \nopposition stems from misinformation about the real impacts and lack \nof  clear  communication  about  program  implications  to  key \nstakeholders.  In  Punjab,  the  risk  of  opposition  to  reform  on  the \npolitical level is less than in the other provinces of Pakistan or the \nfederal level, as the elections in October 2002 gave a clear majority \nmandate to the party most closely associated with the administration \nthat initiated Pakistan\u2019s comprehensive reform agenda over the past \n3  years.  The  Government  has  demonstrated  clear  commitment \nthrough significant upfront actions and public awareness raising of the \nprogram benefits.  \n \nGovernance  and  Bureaucratic  Risks.  As  the  Program  aims  to \nreduce opportunities for abuse of power and rent-seeking, there is a \nrisk that reform efforts are going to be undermined or delayed by \nthose  who  are  going  to  lose  from  the  greater  transparency  and \naccountability the Program is about to introduce. To mitigate such \nrisks,  strong  ownership  and  support  for  the  Program  has  been \ncreated  at  the  highest  political  and  bureaucratic  levels  and  an \neffective mechanism for program oversight  has been  established, \nincluding representatives from  civil society. Moreover, the Program \nadvocates  the  creation  and  strengthening  of  governance-related \ninstitutions.  \n \nIncentive  and  Design  Risks.  Despite  implementation  of  agreed \nmeasures for improved public service delivery, there is a risk of failure \ndue to incentive incompatibilities. Government employees may not be \nwilling  to  be  subjected  to  greater  transparency  and  performance \nmonitoring, and the private sector may not respond to the incentives \noffered to participate in public service delivery. To manage these \nrisks,  a  detailed  and  dynamic  monitoring  system  will  measure \nperformance and failures in a timely manner to allow for readjustment \nof design parameters, which can be accommodated within the flexible \nprogram  modality.  This  will  be  complemented  through  active \nstakeholder consultation and public awareness campaigns; funding \nfor such activities has been included in the TA loan. A key aspect to \nimprove public service delivery will be to create alternative means for \nservice delivery through fair competition and increased private sector \nparticipation  that  offers  opportunities  to  a  wider  range  of  service \nproviders with market-based rewards. \n \nInstitutional  and  Implementation  Risks.  The  Program  is \ncomprehensive  in  nature  and  places  considerable  demand  on \ninstitutional capacities, in particular as Punjab so far has only limited \nexperience  in  implementation  of  program-type  operations. \nComprehensive  TA  will  be  provided  to  support  the  institutional-\nstrengthening  measures  required  for  successful  implementation. \nOther  institutional  risks  also  relate  to  the  failure  to  take  timely \ndecisions and actions on outputs generated under the TA; failure to \nensure adequate coordination with other ongoing or planned reform \nactivities,  resulting  in  possible  duplication  or  contradiction  of \nmeasures; change in key personnel for program implementation; and \nabsence of decision-making powers resulting in bureaucratic delays \n ", "  vii \nabsence of decision-making powers resulting in bureaucratic delays \nin implementation. To minimize those risks, a high-powered PMU was \nestablished  early  during  program  formulation,  and staffed after a \ncompetitive selection process by senior officials who have familiarity \nwith ongoing activities. \n \nMacroeconomic and Exogenous Risks. Pakistan\u2019s macroeconomic \nparameters have strengthened continuously and considerably over \nthe  past  3  years,  but  the  country  remains  highly  vulnerable  to \nexogenous shocks and is dependent on geopolitical developments. \nSlower than expected winding down of regional tensions or regional \nconflicts could adversely affect growth and fiscal projections. While \nsome of the risks are beyond the control of the provincial government \nand federal Government, the latter has put in place a consistent \neconomic management strategy that aims at reducing debt and fiscal \nstabilization with support from the International Monetary Fund  to \nmitigate macroeconomic vulnerabilities. \n \n   ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the Punjab \nResource Management Program (PRMP, the Program) in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, \ncomprising (i) a proposed program cluster concept for public resource management reforms in \nPunjab, (ii) a proposed program loan for subprogram 1 of the Program, and (iii) a proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) loan for supporting public resource management reforms in Punjab. \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT1 \n \n2.  Economic Recovery Gaining Strength. Pakistan has coped well with the difficult \ninternal and external challenges it has been facing over recent years. The Government was able \nto stabilize the fragile economic situation it was facing at the end of the 1990s, despite the \nglobal economic slowdown as well as the uncertainties following the terrorist attacks in the \nUnited States (US) on 11 September 2001 and the war in Iraq in early 2003. The turnaround of \nthe monetary indicators has been particularly impressive: foreign exchange reserves increased \nfrom less than $1 billion in early 2000 to more than $11 billion in mid-2003, aided largely by a \nshift in remittances from overseas Pakistanis through formal channels, rescheduling of external \ndebt  payments,  and  increased  official  transfers;  interest  rates  have  been  brought  down \nsignificantly for both public and private sector debt; inflation has been kept under control at 3\u2013\n4%; and the Pakistan rupee has been gaining strength and has stabilized against the US dollar. \nRecognizing these positive developments, international credit agencies have upgraded their \nfinancial risk ratings for Pakistan.2  \n \n3.  Need to Sustain Growth. Following the achievements on the monetary front, recent \nindications show a pickup in real sector growth as well. The gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrowth rate in fiscal year (FY) 2003 is estimated at 5.1%, after 3.4% in FY2002 and 2.2% in \nFY2001. This recent upswing was aided by some benign external developments, including \nfavorable  weather  conditions  that  supported  the  agriculture  sector,  improved  access  to \ndeveloped markets for Pakistan\u2019s goods as a result of Pakistan\u2019s support for the US-led \nantiterrorism  coalition,  as  well  as  defense-related  expenditures.  Yet  the  foundations  for \ndomestic and foreign investment need to be strengthened to broaden the growth base beyond \nexternal events and assistance, and sustain the higher levels that are required for poverty \nreduction. Meeting the growth target for FY2004, which is set at 5.3%, will require increased \ndevelopment spending and measures to improve investment and competitiveness, alongside a \nmonetary policy that contains expansion of liquidity (resulting from continued foreign exchange \ninflows), keeps inflation under control, and preserves financial stability. \n \n4.  Fiscal Adjustment Ongoing. In agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), \nPakistan has made good progress in fiscal consolidation and in bringing its chronic budget \ndeficit under control. Due to revenue shortfalls and unforeseen expenditures, the original deficit \ntargets over the past 2 years had to be revised slightly and development spending had to be \ncontained at the expense of higher growth and social development. Reforms of the Central \nBoard of Revenue for strengthening tax collection is an important element in Pakistan\u2019s fiscal \nreform agenda, and efforts in this regard appear to be yielding results. In FY2003, collection \n                                                 \n1  For a more detailed analysis, see ADB. 2003. Pakistan Economic Update. Islamabad; and State Bank of Pakistan. \n2002. Annual Report. Islamabad, available: http://www.sbp.org.pk. \n2  Moody\u2019s Investors Service has raised the rating for Pakistan\u2019s external debt and bank deposits to B2. Standard & \nPoor\u2019s has raised its rating for long-term foreign currency debt to B and long-term local debt to BB\u2013, with a stable \noutlook. For further details, see http://www.moodys.com and www.standardandpoors.com.  ", "2  \ntargets have been met for the first  time with a record amount of PRs460 billion. On the \nexpenditure side, the escalation of debt service payments could be arrested through better \nterms  for  foreign  debt  and  a  general  reduction  in  interest  rates,  although  the  federal \nGovernment continued to attract expensive debt as a result of the high interest rates offered to \nthe general public under National Savings Schemes. The increase in fiscal space allowed for \nmore timely releases under the ambitious Public Sector Development Program (PSDP), and \nsocial sector spending has been gathering momentum.3 While the fiscal deficit target of 4.7%4 in \nFY2003 was met, sustaining the downward trend and further reducing the deficit to 4.0% in \nFY2004, while increasing pro-poor expenditure outlays, will require further measures to contain \nthe  continued  high  losses  of  public  enterprises,  in  particular  in  the  power  sector,  and \nimprovements in tax administration.  \n \n5.  Poverty  Reduction  Remains  Top  Priority.  Despite  many  initiatives  aimed  at \ndeveloping Pakistan\u2019s economic and social sectors, the country\u2019s level of development remains \nbelow its potential and social indicators are lagging. Poverty levels in Pakistan increased during \nthe 1990s and are strongly correlated with the slowdown in economic growth during the last \ndecade. At the same time, inequality in income distribution worsened significantly, in particular \nin urban areas. A large share of employment is in the informal sector, and continued high \npopulation growth has put pressure on the labor market that could not be absorbed.5 This has \ngiven rise to social tensions with far-reaching implications, and is believed also to have fueled \nextremist groups. To counter these trends, the Government\u2019s economic policies seek to uplift \nlivelihoods and create opportunities for the poor through support for employment-generating \nactivities, more effective social sector spending, and greater participation in decision making at \nthe local level. The Government has declared poverty reduction to be its overriding policy \nobjective, and is in the process of finalizing its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).6 A \npoverty partnership agreement with ADB was signed in September 20027 that sets out a shared \nvision and key priorities for reducing poverty in Pakistan. \n \n6.  Far-Reaching  Governance  Reforms  Initiated.  Governance  reforms  are  the \ncornerstone of the Government\u2019s agenda for reducing poverty. The previous administration \nembarked on an ambitious program of restructuring and reforming government institutions at all \nlevels\u2014federal, provincial, and local\u2014and a bold step was taken with the devolution plan \nannounced by President Musharraf in 2000 and the promulgation of a new Local Government \nOrdinance by all provinces in 2001. This was founded in the realization that pro-poor public \nservices require a great degree of direct participation by civil society. The reforms fundamentally \nimpact identification and implementation of development programs and allocation of financial \nresources.  Implementation  of  these  reforms  poses  a  formidable  challenge  that  requires \ndetermination and commitment at all levels of government to make a lasting impact. \n \n                                                 \n3  Pro-poor outlays, much of which took place at the provincial and local levels, fell short of expectations during \nFY2002 partly because of a shortfall in revenues, and partly because local governments became operative only in \nlate 2001. \n4  The Government had originally announced a 4.4% fiscal deficit target, which was later increased to 4.7% due to \ncontinued losses of the power utilities, estimated at about PRs55 billion during the fiscal year. \n5  For further details on Pakistan\u2019s labor market and challenges, see International Labour Organization. 2000. \nPakistan Country Employment Policy Review. Islamabad.  \n6  An interim PRSP was formulated in November 2001 following extensive consultation with stakeholders. It outlines \nkey processes to be set in motion to ensure full participation in formulation of the PRSP, including at the provincial \nlevel and by the newly elected district officials and civil society. Details on the interim PRSP and assessment of \nprogress in finalizing the PRSP can be accessed through http://www.imf.org/external/np/prsp/prsp.asp#cp. \n7  ADB. 2002. Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement between the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the Asian \nDevelopment Bank. Manila.  \n ", "      3\n7.  Reform Commitment Reiterated. The elections in October 2002 have given a broader \nmandate for formulation and implementation of the reform measures that have been initiated by \nthe previous Government. The recent economic upswing, and a politically fragmented coalition \ngovernment  inherently  prone  to  populist  pressures,  have  given  rise  to  some  concerns  of \ncomplacency and that the pace of reform may slow. However, the new Government remains \ncommitted  to  maintaining  macroeconomic  stability  and  strengthening  governance. \nImplementation of the agreements with IMF under the ongoing Poverty Reduction and Growth \nFacility  (PRGF)8  as  well  as  related  sector  reforms  to  date  is  generally  on  track,  despite \nconsiderable internal and external pressures.  \n \n8.  Case for Continued Support.  The reforms of the past years has started to yield \nbenefits in terms of key economic indicators, but more time and effort are required for tangible \nbenefits to emerge in a sustained manner for a larger share of the population. A lasting impact \nwill require above all stronger institutions and governance mechanisms attuned to the new \ndevelopment paradigms. This is a long-term process that requires strong political will, technical \ncompetencies, financial resources, and an open mind to new participatory approaches. Beyond \nfinancing the cost of adjustment, Pakistan\u2019s development partners can contribute to this process \nby fostering an educated dialogue, strengthening analytical underpinnings, and bringing some \nmethodological discipline in agreeing on and implementing a structured reform agenda with \nbroad-based support from a wide range of stakeholders. \n \nIII.  THE SECTOR9 \n \n9.  Public Resource Management and Governance. ADB\u2019s country strategy and program \nfor Pakistan,10 as well as the Government\u2019s development agenda articulated in a number of \ndocuments,11  give  high  priority  to  poverty  reduction  through  private  sector-led  pro-poor \neconomic  growth,  social  sector  development,  and  improved  governance.  Public  resource \nmanagement\u2014which  deals  with  administration  of  public  sector  assets  and  liabilities\u2014and \ngovernance  reforms  play  an  important  role  in  this.  They  comprise  measures  to  increase \nrevenue;  improve  allocation  efficiency  and  accountability  for  public  expenditures;  enhance \nsustainability of and access by the poor to public services, including basic social services and \ninfrastructure; and promote economic development. Public sector reforms at the provincial level \nare of particular importance for poverty reduction, as the delivery of numerous social and other \npublic services that directly impact on quality of life is programmed and executed at that and the \nlocal level. While a first generation of reforms at the federal level has contributed much to \nstabilize Pakistan\u2019s macroeconomic environment over recent years, a second generation of \nstructural reforms at the provincial and local government levels is required to bring about a \ndirect and sustained improvement in the quality of life. \n \n                                                 \n8  A 3-year PRGF was approved by IMF in December 2001, with funding of SDR1.03 billion (100% of quota). The \nPRGF provides a framework for further reforms and macroeconomic stabilization. Details of the PRGF as well as \nprogress in implementation can be accessed through the IMF web site at http://www.imf.org. \n9  A more detailed analysis of recent developments, key issues, and opportunities is in Appendix 1. \n10 ADB. 2002.

Significance  of  Punjab.12  Punjab  is  Pakistan\u2019s  most  populous  and  economically \nsignificant province with more than half of the country\u2019s population and economic activity. It is \ndensely populated, with about 82 million people living in just over 205,000 square kilometers. \nThe high population growth of 2.6% per annum\u2014higher than the national average of 2.3%\u2014is \ncreating further pressure on the already strained infrastructure, environment, and social fabric. \nBeing geographically, economically, and culturally diversified, the province is in many ways \nreflective of the country as a whole. Its economy continues to be largely agriculture based,13 \nalthough industry\u2014much of it small scale\u2014makes a substantial contribution to provincial output. \nPunjab\u2019s social indicators correspond closely to the indicators for Pakistan as a whole, and are \nsignificantly worse than many other countries at similar income levels. Any progress that can be \nachieved in Punjab is therefore expected to have a far-reaching impact on the country and its \npeople as a whole. \n \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n \n11.  Key  Functions  of  Provincial  Government.  Pakistan\u2019s  constitution  accords  a  key \nresponsibility in the delivery of public services to its provinces, including social and physical \ninfrastructure  provision  and  associated  services.  This  includes  important  areas  such  as \nagriculture, natural resources and environmental management (including irrigation, water and \nmineral  resources),  social  services  (including  education,  health,  social  welfare),  physical \ninfrastructure  (including  roads,  municipal  services,  water  supply  and  sanitation),  economic \nservices for private sector development (including sector regulation, support services, labor \nexchanges), as well as asset protection and public order (including historical monuments, \npolice, law and order). Some functions of the provinces may also be taken up by the federal \nGovernment and require adequate coordination. Moreover, important service functions are \ndelegated further to local governments at district, tehsil, and union levels.  \n \n12.  Impact of Decentralization With the advent of the Local Government Ordinance 2001, \nprimary responsibility for the bulk of service delivery (including elementary education, curative \nhealth, rural development, farm-to-market roads, and municipal services) was delegated further \nto local governments. By implication, this has redefined and fundamentally impacted provincial \nresponsibilities at all stages of public service delivery, including planning, financing, execution, \nand monitoring. Provincial governments have a key role to (i) ensure that stable, predictable, \nand sufficient fiscal resources are made available for service delivery; (ii) devise instruments for \nintergovernmental financing to encourage local government implementation of province-wide \npolicy  commitments  on  poverty;  (iii) establish  the  policies,  standards,  and  procedures  for \nintegrated  and  sector-specific  service  delivery  (including  human  resources  policies),  while \nensuring accountability and ensuring that local authorities act within the provisions of new legal \nand  institutional  arrangements;  and  (iv)  enable  effective  private  sector-led  economic \ndevelopment.  This  will  require  an  important  adjustment  of  key  provincial  institutions  and \ngovernance arrangements.  \n \n13.  Fiscal Policies and Constraints. The government of Punjab manages a large amount \nof fiscal resources and budgetary funds, with total expenditures in FY2003 estimated at about \n                                                 \n12 The Government has requested ADB and the World Bank for separate support of similar reforms in all four \nprovinces, with ADB assistance directed toward Punjab and Balochistan, and World Bank assistance directed \ntoward Sindh and North-West Frontier provinces. \n13 Punjab produces about 80% of Pakistan\u2019s cotton and wheat, 65% of its sugar, and more than 50% of its rice. This \nconsiderable agricultural production is supported by one of the world\u2019s most extensive irrigation systems, built \nlargely by the British in the early 20th century, but poor maintenance over past decades is increasingly affecting its \nefficacy. \n ", "      5\nPRs139 billion. Pakistan\u2019s constitution limits the scope for taxes that can be imposed by the \nprovinces, and the government of Punjab depends for nearly 84% of its fiscal resources on \nfederal transfers. As provincial revenues have grown at a slower pace than federal transfers, the \nalready high dependency rate has increased further from about 80% during the late 1990s. \nSpending policies in Punjab have been somewhat more conservative than in other provinces, \nwith average fiscal deficits estimated at only about 1\u20132% of provincial GDP. Due to a rigid and \nskewed expenditure structure as well as inappropriate planning, budgeting, and monitoring \nmechanisms, funds have increasingly been channeled toward ineffective uses, resulting in \nprogressive deterioration of public services and institutions. Thus, while fiscal deficits have \nremained under control, lack of fiscal space has impeded growth, kept poverty and social \nindicators below the potential of the province, and resulted in an increasing qualitative deficit in \npublic service delivery. \n \n14.  Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfers. Most taxes as well as other forms of revenues \nare collected by the federal Government and the provinces receive a share of federally levied \nand collected taxes as a transfer. The list of taxes that constitute the \u201cdivisible pool\u201d that is \nshared with provinces, and the ratio of the provincial  and federal share of the pool and the \nformula to drive  derive the horizontal distribution of resources between the provinces are \ndecided, at least once every 5 years, by the National Finance Commission (NFC). Until FY2003, \nthe divisible pool was allocated under the 1997 NFC award on the basis of population, with \nPunjab receiving about 58% of the provincial share. The provincial share of the divisible pool \nunder the 1997 award is 37.5%. A new NFC award is expected to become effective in 2004, \nwith a 40% share of the divisible pool for the provinces. Shared tax transfers (out of the divisible \npool)  account  for  about  75\u201380%  of  total  federal  transfers  to  Punjab,  with  the  remainder \ncomprising other direct transfers, loans, and grants. On the analogy of the NFC, provincial \nfinance commissions (PFCs) have been established recently to allocate funds between the \nprovinces and their respective local governments, based on a variety of criteria, including \npopulation, area (to reflect population densities), relative backwardness, and revenue effort, \ncomplemented with tied or incentive matching grants to achieve development goals and protect \ncrucial programs.  \n \n15.  Budgeting and Expenditure Management. Traditionally, budgets have been prepared \non an annual basis without medium- or long-term planning. Presentation has been in the form of \nfive documents provided to the provincial assembly. A sixth document, aiming at performance \nbudgeting,  was  introduced  in  1999.  The  multiple  documents  lack  clarity  and  consistency, \npresentation is not program or output oriented, and there is no information on the provincial \ngovernment\u2019s contingent fiscal liabilities or the finances of the provincial autonomous bodies. \nUnpredictability in timing and shortfall in federal resource transfers have hampered budget \nimplementation, and resulted in shortfalls of actual spending against targets. \n \n16.  Expenditures are allocated in a mechanical way that does not adequately reflect policy \npriorities or the needs of citizens, especially the poor. Current expenditures account for 83% of \ntotal expenditures, with 54% of current expenditures estimated for salaries and pensions,14 and \nmore  than  14%  for  interest  payments.  Pension  payments  in  particular  have  registered  a \ndisproportionately high increase over the past years and require strategies to be brought under \ncontrol. Much of the increase in salary-related expenditure is due to the rapid growth in the size \nof the provincial civil service during much of the 1980s and rising steadily at 2% per annum \nduring  the  1990s,  reaching  a  sanctioned  strength  of  862,000  in  FY2000  (including  about \n                                                 \n14 Starting with FY2002, salaries for sectors that were devolved to local governments have been included in the block \ntransfers to the local governments, and are not captured explicitly in the provincial budget.  \n   ", "6  \n312,000 teachers), with the majority at lower levels (grades 1\u20136). This has left little room to \nadequately cover the growing needs for operation and maintenance (O&M) of public services, \nand forcing the Government to cut back on already low levels.15 At the same time, the annual \ndevelopment  program  became  overloaded  with  a  large  number  of  schemes  with  doubtful \neconomic returns initiated under political pressure. This resulted in accumulation of a large \nportfolio of underfunded ongoing projects, with spillover of commitments (\u201cthrow forward\u201d) and \nhuge time and cost overruns.  \n \n17.  In order to improve financial planning and expenditure management, a first attempt at \nintroducing a medium-term budget framework (MTBF) was made in 2003. Detailed budget \nplanning, however, is constrained by inaccurate and delayed reporting on actual expenditures, \nin particular at the district level, and by lack of a credible MTBF at the federal level, including \nrelated uncertainties to federal transfers. To contain further growth of the civil service and \nrelated expenses, the provincial government has instituted a ban on new recruitment and shifted \nto contractual employment instead. To bring down the throw forward, a major restructuring \nexercise  of  the  annual  development  program  was  initiated  in  2001  and  the  portfolio  of \ndevelopment schemes pruned to about 400 in FY2003 from more than 1,700 in FY2001. More \nfundamental  changes  in  budgeting  and  expenditure  management  including  institutional \narrangements and processes will be required to align budget allocations with policy priorities \nand improve efficiency in implementation. \n \n18.  Public Service Delivery Outcomes and Mechanisms. Lack of fiscal space has been a \nmajor factor in the general perception that the quality of public services has deteriorated \ncontinuously, and that the public services are incapable of coping with a growing population and \nwith increasing environmental pressures. Public services are often characterized by physical \ninaccessibility  and  the  poor  physical  condition  of  facilities,  weak  institutional  management \ncapacity, lack of community involvement, weak service standards, and poor quality of the civil \nservice. Over the past decade, there has been little improvement in key sector indicators for \nhealth and education, notwithstanding a large number of provincial employees and the fact that \nbudget allocations for education and health have been among the highest line items in the \nprovincial budget, accounting for about 23.3% and 6.8% of total expenditures, respectively. The \naverage provincial literacy rate remains low at 47%, immunization cover is 52%, and access to \nwater supply and sanitation is 86% and 46% respectively. There are considerable differences \nbetween urban and rural areas, and between the northern and southern parts of the province. \nThere is also a strong gender bias, particularly in access to health and education. Municipal and \ncivic services have come under considerable pressure as a result of high population growth that \nhas been compounded by migration to urban centers.16  \n \n19.  The deficits in both human development and physical infrastructure are marked by a \nvicious cycle of shortage of funds, low spending, low service delivery, low development, and low \nwillingness to pay. To break this nexus, it is important to improve allocation efficiencies and \nservice delivery through participatory approaches. Processes and institutional arrangements still \nrooted in the administrative system preceding Pakistan\u2019s independence have resulted in rigid \nand control-oriented procedures at the provincial level17 that are inefficient, unsustainable, and \n                                                 \n15 Provincial spending on O&M has fallen in the last few years, from 17.5% of total expenditures in FY1998 to 11% in \nFY2001. Allocations for O&M of roads are barely 55% of what would have been required on the basis of accepted \nnorms. \n16 The urban share of the population nearly doubled from 17% in 1951 to 31% in 1998. \n17 Traditionally, provincial departments have attached departments and autonomous bodies as their delivery system \nin the field. Autonomous bodies have a somewhat greater administrative control and financial authority  than \nprovincial departments to undertake assigned tasks.  \n ", "      7\nunresponsive to the dynamic needs of society. A serious attempt to reform service delivery \nstructures  was  initiated  with  the  recent  devolution  plan  (para. 6),  but  this  needs  to  be \ncomplemented  by  further  measures  at  the  provincial  level  to  yield  the  intended  benefits. \nMedium-term projections envisage considerable improvement in social sector indicators that is \nrequired in order to meet the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. \n \n20.  Provincial-Private Sector Relations. Employment and output are almost exclusively in \nprivate hands for the productive sectors that dominate Punjab\u2019s economy, i.e., agriculture and \nmanufacturing. Most of the manufacturing activities are in agriculture-related sectors, such as \ntextiles or food processing, and much of these are unorganized and small in scale, although \nthere are regional production patterns. There has been some industrial specialization in certain \nareas, such as light engineering in Gujranwala, textiles in Faisalabad, or surgical instruments \nand sports goods in Sialkot. Economic performance has been volatile and uneven across \nsectors, depending largely on weather patterns and agricultural output. Productivity is generally \nlow, and competitiveness is eroding further in light of deteriorating physical infrastructure (in \nparticular for irrigation water) and inadequate public support services that are perceived as \nirrelevant  at  best\u2014except  by  the  privileged  few  that  enjoy  the  significant  subsidies  these \nentail\u2014and at worst market and welfare distorting.  \n \n21.  Despite numerous policy statements that call for private sector development and an \ninvestment  regime  that  has  already  been  considerably  liberalized  over  the  past  decade, \nsignificant government involvement remains both at the policy and regulatory level and in terms \nof  providing  infrastructure  and  economic  support  services.  Regulatory  overlap  and \ninconsistencies remain across levels of government and institutions at the federal and provincial \nlevels. The regulatory burden is spread out over many arms of government (such as finance, \nenvironment, labor, social welfare, and industry). These multiple layers of regulation provide \nconsiderable opportunities for rent seeking by public officials and result in high compliance costs \nfor business. In addition, there are imperfections in the legal system and in access to justice to \nfully protect and facilitate the acquisition and disposition of property, as well as to provide for \neffective enforcement of contracts\u2014elements that constitute the foundation of an effective \nmarket economy. \n \n22.  Traditional  government  focus  for  private  sector  development  was  to  ensure  the \navailability of inputs at cheap prices that were often subsidized, including infrastructure-related \nservices, credit, or industrial agricultural inputs. In addition, the Government has dominated \nsocial service delivery, and has attempted to regulate prices of outputs (to reduce the effects of \nmarket fluctuations), in particular for agricultural produce. Government support has been mainly \nthrough the form of about 130 autonomous bodies and public sector organizations (PSOs) that \nemploy more than 100,000 people. Most of these are in the health and education sectors, but \nthere remains considerable involvement in economic services of a commercial nature including \nfinance, trading (in particular for agriculture), business development, industrial estates, mining, \ntransport, and urban services. The performance of these PSOs is not well documented in the \nabsence  of  meaningful  and  timely  accounts,  but  is  generally  considered  to  be  poor  with \naccumulated losses estimated at about PRs35 billion. There is a realization for a need to shift \nthe role of government from directly providing key services toward creating an environment that \nencourages private initiative and public-private partnerships for delivery of public goods and \nservices. \n \n23.  Poverty on the Rise. The overall picture of Punjab corresponds closely with that of \nPakistan as a whole, and incidence of poverty today, at about 33%, is higher than a decade \n   ", "8  \nago.18 While urban poverty increased from 22% in FY1993 to 24.4% in FY2001, poverty in rural \nareas, where about 70% of Punjab\u2019s people live, increased significantly from 26.5% to 44.2% \nover this period, with poverty generally higher in the southern part of the province. To reverse \nthe trend and sharpen the focus on poverty reduction at the provincial level, a Punjab PRSP \nwas  developed  in  2003  in  the  context  of  the  national  PRSP.  To  assist  policy  makers  in \nidentifying priority needs and target groups for intervention, adequate data must be available \nand monitoring of poverty reduction initiatives is required. A better understanding of issues \nspecific to poverty in the province calls for further examination of concentration of poverty \nacross areas within the province, and looking beyond traditional measures as defined by lack of \nfood consumption and income. To examine poverty in a broader context of parameters of needs \nand to collect key information in disaggregated form at the district level, the government of \nPunjab made a first attempt in 2003 with a detailed household survey, the Multiple Indicator \nCluster Survey (MICS), which to be updated every 3 to 4 years.19  \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities  \n \n24.  To strengthen public resource management, the government of Punjab faces a number \nof challenges that may be categorized under fiscal, governance, or institutional areas. Many of \nthese challenges also offer opportunities if properly addressed.  \n \n1.  Fiscal \n \n25.  Like the federal Government as well as other provinces, Punjab is facing a lack of fiscal \nspace and a worsening squeeze on total public spending. On one side, there are limitations on \nrevenue generation capacity, on the other, ongoing commitments for current expenditures \nconsume most of the revenues and leave little room for incremental spending to adjust to policy \npriorities. \n \n26.  Narrow  Tax  Base  with  Inefficient  Collection.  As  key  taxes  are  collected  and \nadministered by the federal Government, the provincial tax structure has been characterized by \na large number of low-yielding and inelastic taxes that have been cumbersome to administer \nand that do not add to provincial revenues. The share of provincial taxes in total revenues has \ndeclined over the years to less than 7% of total revenues in FY2003. Yet there is considerable \npotential, in particular for collection of agricultural income tax (AIT) and general sales tax (GST) \non services. Since 2000, the government of Punjab has taken decisive steps to reform its \nprovincial tax structure and reduced the number of taxes from 36 to nine. It has also changed \nassessments for agricultural income and is gradually introducing the GST on services. To yield \nthe expected returns, the reform in the tax structure needs to be complemented by reforms in \nthe collection system. Tax collection has in the past been inefficient due to the high number of \nagencies involved. Considerable benefits can be expected from consolidation and review of \ncollection mechanisms to make them more transparent and effective. \n \n27.  Unreliability of Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfers. The high degree of dependence \non federal transfers has left the provincial government exposed to national policies and federal \nperformance, with little leeway in absorbing the cost of shortfalls in such transfers. Due to \nrevenue shortfalls at the federal level, transfers often did not take place as budgeted.  The \nvolatility of transfers from the federal divisible pool has also rendered provincial revenue and \n                                                 \n18 Poverty is defined based on an intake of 2,350 calories per person per day and a minimum per capita income of \nPRs650 per month.  \n19 The MICS is prepared with assistance from UNICEF. \n ", "      9\nexpenditure estimates unrealistic. This has resulted in unplanned cuts in expenditures, generally \nresulting  in  deferral  of  expenditures,  and  the  buildup  of  provincial  funding  liabilities  that \ncontributed to fiscal stress.  \n \n28.  With  the  shift  to  fiscal  decentralization,  much  of  the  spending  authority  has  been \ndelegated to local governments. However, due to delays in finalizing financing awards to \ndistricts, as well as capacity limitations on project implementation, funds that were to be \ntransferred to local governments remained with the province, and incongruously the government \nof Punjab now finds itself in a cash-surplus situation while experiencing expanding liabilities. A \nkey  challenge  to  rectify  this  is  to  develop  a  sustainable,  transparent,  and  effective \nintergovernmental transfer mechanism. The first steps have been taken at the provincial level \nwith the establishment of PFCs as well as the introduction of block allocations to districts. \n \n29.  Skewed and Rigid Expenditure Structure Dominated by High Establishment Costs. \nOn  the  expenditure  side,  flexibility  for  much-needed  structural  shifts  is  limited  by  high \nestablishment costs, comprising salaries and pension payments, which account for more than \nhalf of total spending. This is a result of overextended, partly uneconomic, public infrastructure \nnetworks and staff-heavy but ineffective social service networks that are fiscally unsustainable. \nIn  addition,  a  considerable  portion,  about  14%  of  expenditures,  is  allocated  for  servicing \nprovincial debt, primarily cash development loans (CDLs) from the federal Government, which \ncarry high interest. The rigid structure has resulted in persistent and worsening underspending \non critical nonsalary inputs, including O&M of key facilities and pro-poor services. To rectify this \nsituation, the provincial government has taken steps to limit further expansion of establishment \ncosts, reduce subsidies, and develop a debt management strategy with a view to generate \nadditional fiscal space through reduction of interest payments. Implementation of this strategy is \naided through a benign interest environment at present. \n \n30.  Buildup of High Liabilities. Punjab\u2019s debt has increased considerably over the past \ndecade, with an accumulated debt stock of PRs121.2 billion at the end of FY2002. A large \nportion of this, PRs86.9 billion, was financed through expensive CDLs. Some of the loans were \nobtained at rates above 17%. Refinancing of liabilities thus offers a particular opportunity to \nachieve greater fiscal space in the near term.  \n \n31.  With the discontinuation  of CDLs in 1998, and curtailment of overdraft arrangements \nwith the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the overall budget deficits more recently could only be \nfinanced by building up arrears and utilizing off-budget funds held by the Government in a \nfiduciary capacity, including the General Provident Fund of civil service employees, which has \naccumulated liabilities of about PRs17 billion. There is also a considerable amount of unfunded \nand contingent liabilities that are not adequately provided for, including civil service pensions \nand liabilities of autonomous bodies and PSOs. Pension liabilities in particular are growing at a \nrapid pace and could seriously disrupt provincial finances in a decade or so if no measures are \ntaken now. They increased from PRs1.7 billion in FY1991 to about PRs10.8 billion in FY2003. In \naddition, the provincial government has extended a number of loans and guarantees to PSOs \nthat have become nonperforming. Outstanding nonperforming loans by the province to PSOs \nare estimated at more than PRs35 billion, with an additional PRs6 billion of guarantees to PSOs \nfor borrowing transactions that are not sustainable. To ensure the medium- and long-term \nsustainability of provincial finances, there is an urgent need to devise strategies to deal with the \nunfunded pension liabilities and to rectify the financial positions of the PSOs by writing off debt \nthat is not recoverable. The Government has initiated steps to address this unsustainable \nsituation and created a working group to look into these issues, in particular financing of pension \nliabilities, and these steps need to be taken further. \n   ", "10  \n \n2.  Governance \n \n32.  A crisis of governance encompassing public institutions and functions at all levels of \ngovernment has been identified as a central element of the poor development performance. \nThere  is  ample  evidence  that  improvements  in  public  sector  governance  and  resource \nmanagement  yield  considerable  development  gains.  For  Punjab,  the  key  governance \nchallenges are to manage the transition toward greater decentralization while, at the same time, \nstrengthening policy formulation and implementation by including participatory processes and \nensuring  accountability  in  public  service  delivery,  unrestricted  access  to  information, \ntransparency in financial management, and protection of assets through law and order and \nthrough access to justice. \n \n33.   Decentralization of Authority. The ambitious reforms initiated in 2000 to restructure \nadministrative, functional, financial, and fiscal relations between different levels of government \naim to transfer power to lower government formations through devolution of authority and \ngranting of autonomy. Under the new system, the role of the provincial governments will be \ntransformed from a direct provider of some basic social and community services to financing, \nregulation, and supervision of local governments as primary delivery agents. The shifting of \nresources and  authority to lower levels of government is expected to make the Government \nresponsive to local needs and priorities. The decentralization reforms thus present a unique \nopportunity  to  improve  delivery  of  services  within  the  framework  of  effective,  efficient, \ntransparent, accountable, and participatory governance structures. Yet the overriding challenge \nwill be to manage the transformation to the new system. This will require a shift in attitudes, \nprocesses, and institutional arrangements, including establishment of a few new institutions at \nthe provincial level (such as the local government commission and PFC). Unless new processes \ncan be institutionalized over the next few years, intended benefits may not be realized and \nreforms are at risk of being rolled back. Managing decentralization will thus require both strong \npolitical commitment to redesign existing structures and processes, and considerable training \nand skills development at various levels of government. \n \n34.  Participatory Approaches for Policy Formulation and Investment Planning. A key \naspect in managing decentralization at the provincial level and in improving public service \ndelivery is to establish an effective system that allows the linking of priorities formulated through \nparticipatory  approaches  within  an  overall  planning  and  investment  framework  that  takes \naccount  of  resource  availabilities.  Improved  institutional  arrangements  for  participatory \nmechanisms should enable local communities to better articulate and realize their choices by \ndesigning investment programs and by taking on expenditure commitments based on their own \nneeds and local priorities. This will require a reorientation of the centralized and control-oriented \nsystems and procedures established in the past in provincial agencies, and a shift of key \nprovincial agencies toward more emphasis on policy formulation and oversight rather than \nproject programming and execution. The successful implementation of participatory approaches \nwill require considerable capacity building at both provincial and local levels of government and \nan  effective  coordination  mechanism.  The  provincial  Government  took  a  first  step  in \ninstitutionalizing this process through the creation of the Punjab Development Forum (PDF), \nwhich held its first meeting in September 2003, and which is to become a regular feature of \nstakeholder  consultation  prior  to  annual  budget  formulation.  A  number  of  important  policy \nannouncements were made publicly at the PDF, and next year\u2019s PDF is expected to scrutinize \nprogress in implementation and provide a platform for structured discussion. \n \n ", "      11\n35.  Policy Implementation and Governance. Significant efforts have been made over the \npast few years to modernize the policy environment for economic and social development. \nHowever, shortcomings in policy implementation remain a major concern, with the predictable, \ntransparent, and rule-based application of policies representing the biggest challenge. The \neffectiveness of policies is limited by the existence of outdated regulations, administrative \nsystems, and practices that are inconsistent with declared policies. Despite the presence of \nliberal laws, businesses still face lengthy court proceedings for contractual or other business-\nrelated disputes, increasing the legal costs for the private sector. There are also problems in \ninterpreting new laws in government departments, where normally amendments in their related \nrules lag behind new enacted laws.  \n \n36.  Accountability and Transparency in Financial Management. Lack of accountability \nand transparency in financial management and absence of transparent rules provide rent-\nseeking  opportunities  for  public  officials  at  the  expense  of  society.  Corruption  is  widely \nperceived by the general public to be a major problem. Internal controls and accountability \nsystems have weakened over time and are characterized by inadequate accounting practices. \nPoorly  functioning  financial  reporting  and  management  systems  and  procedures  have \ncompromised the reliability of provincial accounts and the quality of financial management. The \nauditing function has not lived up to its promise because the accounts were not presented on a \ntimely basis and the public accounts committee (PAC) were either not in place or did not \nfunction regularly to review the audit reports promptly, thereby constraining the usefulness of \nthe audit system. In view of the delays with which audit reports have either been produced or \nreviewed,  the  PAC  has  not  been  particularly  effective  in  highlighting  and  correcting  poor \ncompliance with financial policies, systems, and procedures.  \n \n37.  Shift in Incentive Structures. A key element to improve public service delivery is to \nachieve  a  shift  in  incentive  structures  for  performance.  While  a  change  in  government \nprocedures and support systems, including performance-based human resources systems, is \nan  important  factor,  lasting  improvements  may  only  be  achieved  through  private  sector \nparticipation and the competition for excellence this brings. Punjab is in a relatively fortunate \nposition compared to other provinces as it has both a better educated civil service as well as a \ndynamic private sector.  \n \n38.  Reform Momentum and Political Support. Punjab is in a relatively good position vis-\u00e0-\nvis other provinces to carry out and benefit from public sector reforms. The province has a \ndiversified  economy  with  good  growth  and  tax  potential,  an  entrepreneurial  business \ncommunity, and probably better capacity in the civil service. Unlike the other provinces, the \nelections  in  October  2002  resulted  in  a  clear  majority  and  mandate  for  the  provincial \ngovernment to proceed with the reform program initiated under the previous administration. The \nfederal Government is closely associated with the previous administration that initiated these \nreforms and with further advancing the reform agenda. In addition, the devolution program in \nparticular  enjoys  the  strong  support  of  Pakistan\u2019s  president,  and  by  implication  this has \nconsiderable impact on provincial resource management. The continued deterioration of public \nservices has further exacerbated the need for structural reforms. All this presents a timely \nopportunity for a holistic rather than piecemeal approach to create an effective and accountable \ncivil service administration and public service delivery.  \n \n3.  Institutional  \n \n39.  The  deteriorating  quality  of  public  services  is  closely  linked  to  limited  institutional \ncapacity, which is exacerbating the lack of funds and inadequate governance mechanisms. \n   ", "12  \n \n40.   Ineffective  and  Rigid  Administrative  Structures.  Punjab\u2019s  public  sector  employs \nnearly 1 million people (para. 16). The majority are with the provincial government, 80% of \nwhose approximately 862,000 official positions are in education, health, police, irrigation, and \nagriculture. The administrative structures to manage this large pool are highly centralized and \ndo not allow for flexibility in responding to client needs, in particular in those areas where \nservice delivery is performed at a local level. Much of the employment is at lower salary grades, \nincluding 20% at grade 1, which is essentially unskilled staff, and 40% at low-skilled grades 2\u20135. \nDespite the low salaries, staff employed at this el vel have limited options for employment \noutside the government service, while at the same time their motivation to work is limited. This \nresults in a high level of absenteeism as well as rent-seeking opportunities associated with the \nfunctions to be performed. In addition, over the years a number of functions and institutions \nhave been added to the provincial government, without making space and readjusting existing \narrangements. As a result, the bureaucracy has become somewhat unwieldy, with duplication of \nfunctions. There also remain a number of departments with significant employment that have \nlost their original functions. The public sector as a whole is overextended. \n \n41.  Human  Resources  Management  and  Accountability.  The  weak  performance  of \nPunjab\u2019s  public  institutions  is  a  reflection  of  inadequate  human  resources  policy  and \nmanagement, and lack of accountability. The skills base in many instances is unsuited to \nperform the functions it was assigned to. Reasons include frequent rotations of staff\u2014which are \nmade with good intentions to prevent staff from becoming too entrenched in their positions and \nto provide greater exposure to tasks\u2014as well as appointments made under political pressure. \nPromotion and guidelines are not very clear, and rising through the ranks is still based more on \nseniority than on performance, in the absence of clear accountability rules and performance \nmonitoring systems. Together with a pay structure that has not kept pace with market trends, in \nparticular for positions of responsibility, it has become increasingly difficult to attract and retain \nsuitable talent for key institutions. However, Punjab has a large human resources pool to tap, \nand improvement in human resources development, as well as outsourcing of selected services \nand institutions on a contractual basis to the private sector with clearly defined performance \ncriteria, could yield considerable efficiency gains. \n \n42.  Gender  Inequalities.  While  the  number  of  female  employees  in  the  provincial \ngovernment has been increasing recently, employment of women generally used to take place \nat lower salary levels. Only about 2.5% of higher-level staff at grade 17 and above are female, \nindicating a strong gender bias in the past. In addition, physical work environments are outdated \nand generally not geared toward the basic needs of female staff (such as separate toilets). To \nensure more gender-balanced policy formulation and resource distribution at both the provincial \nand district levels, there a need to establish cross-sector and comprehensive gender analysis, \nplanning, budgeting, auditing, and monitoring systems, methodologies, and mechanisms. The \nprovincial government is committed to gender equality and, in consultation with the federal \nGovernment initiated a Gender Reform Action Plan (GRAP),20 which is to be implemented at the \nprovincial level to address key gender issues. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n20 The GRAP spells out gender commitments made by the federal and provincial governments in specific terms \naround four central themes: (i) improving women\u2019s representation and participation in political and administrative \nstructures; (ii) making a policy shift from social welfare to social development and women\u2019s development to gender \nequality; (iii) restructuring provincial and district government arrangements from a gender perspective; and (iv) \nengendering planning and budgetary processes to narrow the gender gap in public expenditure. \n ", "      13\nC.  Lessons Learned \n \n43.  Lessons can be drawn from previous experience in policy-based adjustment lending by \nADB and other funding agencies in Pakistan,21 as well as from ADB support for governance and \nresource management programs elsewhere. There has been considerable experience with \nprogram lending in Pakistan recently, including eight program or sector development program \nloans approved by ADB since 1999. Generally, implementation of these loans so far has been \nprogressing satisfactorily. Key lessons learned include the importance of strong ownership and \na committed executing agency (EA) to drive implementation, need for broad-based political \nsupport and consultation in particular for cross-sector reforms, focused design and realistic \nimplementation time frames, and strong implementation support, including TA loans.  \n \n44.  While there is considerable familiarity at the federal level with adjustment lending, the \nproposed Program is the first program-lending intervention by ADB at the provincial level. Some \nexperience with provincial adjustment lending has been gained by the World Bank in Sindh and \nNorth-West Frontier Province. A key lesson there is the importance of taking into account \nprovincial considerations and capacities, which can be quite different from those at the federal \nlevel.  ADB  has  gained  some  experience  with  resource  management  programs  at  the \nsubnational level elsewhere, in particular in India, which highlight the importance of adequate \nstakeholder consultation during program formulation and implementation, as well as the need \nfor a realistic and medium-term time frame, given the complexities inherent in such programs. \nCluster programs have been introduced following the last review of lending program policies in \n1999 to allow for more realistic and better sequenced program time frames, but so far no cluster \nhas reached its completion date. In addition, ADB supported the Social Action Program (Sector \nProject) in Pakistan during the early and mid-1990s, which aimed to improve social indicators \nthrough boosting social sector spending. Much of this spending, which was incremental in \nnature, has proven to be unsustainable in the absence both of related governance reforms and \nof measures to generate fiscal space needed to finance sustainable incremental spending. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n \n45.  The Government\u2019s recent devolution plan, which assigned the bulk of public service \ndelivery in certain areas to local governments at district and tehsil levels, has, by implication, \nfundamentally affected the role, responsibilities, and powers of provincial governments. To \nsupport improved service delivery, the government of Punjab has initiated important measures \nto realign and reorient its administrative structures and processes. To help the province further \nthese reforms, the Government sought ADB\u2019s support for public resource management reforms \nin Punjab.22 This forms part of ADB\u2019s governance strategy for Pakistan and was included in the \ncountry strategy and program for 2003.  \n \n46.  Program formulation was coordinated with various stakeholders from various levels of \ngovernment, the private sector, nongovernment organizations, and other development partners. \nAn overview of the processing steps, approaches, and background studies undertaken is \nprovided in Appendix 2. Summary information on external assistance to the sector is presented \nin Appendix 3. The program framework is in Appendix 4. The agreements on the PRMP loan \n                                                 \n21 A more general description of lessons learned by ADB from program lending is in ADB. 1999. Review of ADB\u2019s \nProgram Lending Policies. Manila.  \n22 Public resource management reforms are envisaged in all of Pakistan\u2019s four provinces, with ADB assistance \ndirected toward Punjab and Balochistan, and World Bank assistance directed toward Sindh and North-West \nFrontier provinces. This is ADB's first adjustment operation at the provincial level in Pakistan. It is also Punjab's first \nstructural adjustment operation supported by program lending. \n   ", "14  \nare reflected in the Government\u2019s development policy letter and the attached policy matrix in \nAppendix 5.  \n \nA.  Objective, Scope, and Assistance Modality \n \n47.  Reducing Poverty. The goal of the Program is to reverse the increased incidence of \npoverty in Punjab and achieve targeted improvements in socioeconomic indicators through \nefficient delivery of public services that are responsive to the dynamic needs of Punjab\u2019s society \nand sustainable management of public resources. The Program seeks to support Punjab in \nimplementing its reform agenda and achieve the development targets as outlined in the federal \nGovernment's PRSP. At the provincial level, the Program will complement and integrate with \nvarious other governance-related initiatives anchored in the PRSP, including those for fiscal \ndevolution, decentralized social service delivery, financial reporting and auditing, and gender \nreform.  \n \n48.  Realign Governance Structures, Systems, and Procedures. The purpose and policy \nobjectives of the Program are to assist Punjab through reforms in governance structures, \nsystems, and procedures to:  \n(i)  provide  fiscal  space  for  sustainable  development  and  improve  allocation  and \nmonitoring mechanisms for effective and transparent utilization of funds; \n(ii)  adjust and strengthen institutional arrangements for enhanced pro-poor impact of \npublic expenditure and improved service delivery; and  \n(iii)  create a conducive environment for private sector development, growth, and income \ngeneration, with a shift of government away from control and direct involvement in \noperations of an economic or commercial nature toward enabling, promoting, and \nfacilitating. \n \n49.  Application of Program Cluster Modality. Considering the comprehensive nature and \ninterlinkages  inherent  in  reforms  that  seek  to  address  governance  and  public  resource \nmanagement issues and the medium-term nature of the reform process, the PRMP will be \nstructured in sequential subprograms under the program cluster modality. Under this modality, \neach subprogram will have a shorter time horizon of about 1\u20132 years, and formulation and \nfinalization of each subsequent subprogram during the subprogram review (SPR) will take place \non an agreed schedule toward the later stages of implementation of the preceding subprogram. \nThis will allow for flexibility in program adjustment based on progress made and changes in the \nexternal environment and for building up momentum in the reform process as the Government \ngains experience through implementation. In addition, to support institutional development as \nwell as implementation capacity for the reform program, a comprehensive TA loan will be \nprovided together with the PRMP, supplemented by a number of smaller TA grants over the \nprogram cluster period. \n \nB.  Policy Framework  \n \n50.  Guiding Design Principles. Formulation and design of the Program are anchored in the \nfollowing principles, taking account of past program experiences in Pakistan and elsewhere: \n \n(i)  Strong leadership and participation. The Program enjoys full support at the \nhighest levels, including the chief minister of Punjab. Program formulation was \n\u201chome grown\u201d with broad stakeholder participation, including the private sector \n ", "      15\nand nongovernment organizations. The first PDF was held prior to program \nfinalization to allow for wide consultation on the Program\u2019s content. \n \n(ii)  Output-focused  medium-term  approach  with  flexibility  for  target \nadjustment. The Program takes a medium-term view (i.e., it goes beyond the \nshort-term horizon of traditional program loans), and by adopting the cluster \nmodality allows for adjustment of design parameters based on actual progress \nand effectiveness. \n \n(iii)  Emphasis on strong implementation support and monitoring mechanism. A \nPMU was established and staffed early during program formulation, and involved \nin the design of a comprehensive monitoring framework. \n \n(iv)  A holistic approach and coordination and complementarity with other governance \nactivities anchored in the PRSP. \n \n(v)  ADB program financing allocated for financing of measures that create fiscal \nspace within a defined medium-term budget framework rather than financing \nincremental sector spending that may not be sustainable. \n \n51.  Program Structure and Nomenclature. To address the three main policy objectives \nidentified  (para.  48),  the  reforms  under  the  Program  are  structured  in  three  thematic \ncomponents, namely: (i) reforming provincial finances through fiscal restructuring and financial \nmanagement, (ii) reforming processes and institutions for sustainable and pro-poor service \ndelivery, and (iii) creating opportunities for growth and income generation through private sector \ndevelopment. For each component, two or three key result areas (KRAs) have been identified \nwhich articulate key outcomes to be realized over the full Program period. For each KRA, two to \nfour key  outcomes have been prioritized. To bring about the outcomes in a structured and \nphased manner, specific targets for achievements will be agreed upon under each subprogram. \nMeeting the achievement targets will trigger the release of a tranche of the proposed program \nloan under each subprogram.23 To meet the achievement targets and to judge whether sufficient \nprogress has been made for each tranche release, a set of agreed actions is required to be \nimplemented. \n \n52.  Sequencing. Given the long-term nature of the reform process, the intended outcomes \nare  expected  to  be  achieved  fully  over  the  complete  program  period  by  2008.  For  each \nsubprogram, achievement targets will be formulated to keep the reform process on track in a \ncoordinated manner. The emphasis under subprogram 1 will be on revenue, expenditure, and \nfinancial management measures as well as reform of institutional arrangements and processes \nthat link funding allocations to service delivery. Simultaneously, reform of key government \nagencies and related capacity-building  activities  will  be  initiated.  Hence,  in  subprogram  1, \npreparation of fully owned action plans to further detail and implement reforms in key areas is \nan important element, with a focus on process compliance rather than on the meeting of \nnumerical targets. In particular, achievements and actions under component 3 will largely be of \na preparatory nature, as substantive achievements can only be expected during the later phase \nof the PRMP. \n \n                                                 \n23 In line with ADB\u2019s evaluation findings on policy reform design of past program loans and revised policies on \nprogram  lending  (ADB.  1999.  Review  of  ADB\u2019s  Program  Lending  Policies.  Manila),  conditions  have  been \nformulated with increased focus on outcomes to allow for greater flexibility in actions to achieve compliance.  \n   ", "16  \n53.  A  summary  of  the  Program  cluster  structure,  its  components,  KRAs  and  temporal \nemphasis is in Table 1 below. Achievement targets for tranche releases under subprogram 1, \ntogether  with  detailed  actions  taken  and  required,  as  well  as  indicative  targets  under \nsubprogram 2 and 3, are detailed for each outcome in the policy matrix attached to the \nGovernment\u2019s development policy letter (Appendix 5). \n \nTable 1: Program Cluster Structure and Emphasis of Program Components \nThematic Program Components and Key Result Areas  Number of  Achievements \nOutcomes  Subprogram   Subprograms \n1  2 and 31 \nComponent 1: Reforming Provincial Finances through  11      \nFiscal Restructuring and Financial Management  (cid:152)  \u00bb \n  A.

Reforming Provincial Finances through Fiscal Restructuring and Financial \n  Management \n \n54.  Component 1 seeks to provide fiscal space for sustainable investments in pro-poor \ndevelopment, and improve allocation and monitoring mechanisms for effective and transparent \nutilization  of  funds.  To  achieve  adequate  fiscal  space  and  sustainability  of  the  reforms \nenvisaged under the PRMP, the approach is to provide support for a structural shift in the \nprovincial financing pattern, and not to simply achieve temporary space through incremental \nbudget  support.  This  is  to  be  achieved  through  (i) strengthening  provincial  revenues; \n(ii) rationalizing  provincial  expenditures;  and  (iii) improving effectiveness, predictability, and \naccountability in financial management. The key policy result under this component would be a \nstronger revenue base to finance a switch in expenditures toward high-priority social sector \ninterventions, with enhanced accountability and control over utilization of funds. The attainment \nof this objective on a sustainable basis will have to be supplemented by administrative reforms, \nwhich will require the strong commitment of the government. Major shifts in revenues and \nexpenditures as envisaged are presented in the medium term fiscal framework in Appendix 6. \n \n \n \n ", "      17\na.  KRA 1: Strengthen Provincial Revenues  \n \n55.  The  strengthening  of  the  revenue  foundation  of  the  provinces  will  result  from \n(i) rationalized  and  restructured  provincial  taxes  and  duties  with  a  broader  tax  base, \n(ii) enhanced  nontax  revenues  and  user  chargers,  and  (iii) improved  tax  and  revenue \nadministration.  \n \n56.  Outcome 1: Rationalized and Restructured Provincial Taxes and Duties. Measures \nunder the PRMP will consolidate, restructure, and enhance provincial taxes, and shift the \nemphasis to buoyant taxes, such as agricultural income tax (AIT) and general sales tax (GST) \non services. This will also reduce exemptions and harmonize rates with other provinces. Key \nachievements under subprogram 1 include the reduction in the number of provincial taxes from \n36 to nine and reforms in the AIT, GST, and property tax, as well as others. Under subprograms \n2  and  3,  the  tax  structure  and  rates  may  be  rationalized  and  adjusted  further  for  full \nharmonization with other provinces, with the objective of realizing annual tax increases of at \nleast 9%. \n \n57.  Outcome 2: Enhanced Nontax Revenues and User Chargers. Under subprogram 1, \nthe provincial government has rationalized user charges for water supply (with an increase of as \nmuch as 40% in Lahore and 20% in other main cities) and irrigation, and will undertake a \ncomprehensive review of rationalization of charges for tertiary social services. Other important \nmeasures was the offer of the provincial government to (i) write off the debt liabilities and Water \nand Power Development Authority (WAPDA) receivables of tehsil municipal authorities (TMAs) \nwith effect from 1 July 2003, amounting to PRs3.7 billion, in return for an agreed action plan by \nthe TMAs to eliminate their operational deficits for water supply and sanitation; and (ii) fully \ntransfer property tax receipts to TMAs. Under subprograms 2 and 3, further moves toward cost \nrecovery for irrigation, water supply and sanitation, and tertiary education will be undertaken, \ntogether with institutional reforms to improve collection efficiency. \n \n58.  Outcome 3: Improved Tax and Revenue Administration. Tax collection efficiency is \nkey to sustainable revenue increases, and substantial improvement is required. Considering the \nsensitive nature of this matter, subprogram 1 will take the first steps by fostering a consensus \non the need to rationalize the administrative setup for revenue collection and land management, \nand launch a detailed study, with support from TA. This will comprise (i) a review of the \ncollection  system  to  lead  to  an  agreement  on  improvements  in  administrative  structures, \n(ii) implementation  of  those  recommendations  for  improvement  and  reform  in  tax/revenue \ncollection system, (iii) increase in collection efficiency in particular for agricultural income tax, \nand (iv) building capacity for assessment and collection of property tax at the local level.  \n \nb.  KRA 2: Rationalize Provincial Expenditures  \n \n59.  Provincial  expenditures  will  be  rationalized  through  (i) restructuring  and  reducing \nprovincial debt, (ii) containing and reducing contingent liabilities, (iii) phasing out subsidies that \ndo not explicitly target the poor, and (iv) rationalizing and improving public accountability of \nspending for pro-poor public service delivery and high-priority areas.  \n \n60.  Outcome 4: Restructuring and Reducing Provincial Debt.  To limit and lessen the \nsubstantive debt burden, under subprogram 1 Punjab has started a debt reprofiling exercise \ninvolving  swaps  of  high-cost  loans  with  low-cost  loans.  This  will  yield  substantial  and \nsustainable fiscal space. The province also prepared a long-term strategy to gradually reduce \n   ", "18  \ndebt  servicing.  Measures  under  the  subsequent  subprograms  will  further  implement  this \nstrategy to reduce the debt service ratio of the province to below 10% of the total budget. \n \n61.  Outcome 5: Containing and Reducing Contingent Liabilities. Under subprogram 1, \nthe provincial government will need first to establish reliable base data, and then develop a \nstrategy for managing contingent liabilities, including civil service pension liabilities. Reforms of \nfinancing  of  civil  service  pension  obligations  through  actuarial  assessment  of  civil  service \npension liabilities, will be initiated. Likewise, initial work will be undertaken for restructuring debt \nand resolving loans guaranteed by the province but incurred by autonomous bodies and by \nPSOs. Measures under subprograms 2 and 3 will then implement plans for civil service pension \nreforms and financial restructuring and resolution of PSO obligations to reduce contingent \nliabilities. \n \n62.  Outcome  6:  Phasing  Out  Subsidies  that  do  not  Explicitly  Target  the  Poor. \nSubprogram 1 will include an assessment of impacts of subsidies on poverty and gradually \nphase out direct and indirect subsidies (including wheat, interest cost for loans, and other \nservices) not directly targeted at poverty reduction. Findings of the assessment of impacts on \nsubsidies will be implemented under subprograms 2 and 3 to further reduce nonpoor subsidies, \nwhile making other subsidies explicit and transparent. \n \n63.  Outcome 7: Rationalizing and Improving Public Accountability for Pro-Poor Public \nService Delivery and High Priority Areas. Important steps were taken to better monitor public \nexpenditure, rationalize the portfolio of ongoing development projects, and reduce the \u201cthrow \nforward\u201d of ongoing schemes. Expenditures have been redirected toward priority schemes with \ndirect impact for the poorest, and sector reforms have been initiated to improve service delivery \nand accountability.  Further measures under subprogram 1 will develop transparent project \nselection  criteria,  and  ensure  increased  funding  for  O&M.  Under  subprograms  2  and  3, \nallocations, particularly in education and health, will be increased further on a yearly basis (at \nhigher rates than average budget increases) in line with the MTBF projections and increased \naccountability measures; the public expenditure review and budget formulation process will be \nrefined and improved further, taking account of implementation performance. \n \nc.  KRA 3: Improve Effectiveness, Predictability, and Accountability in \n  Financial Management \n \n64.  Effectiveness, predictability, and accountability in financial management will be improved \nthrough  (i) transparent  and  user-friendly  budgets  within  MTBF;  (ii) establishing  and \nimplementing  transparent  and  rule-based  systems  of  intergovernmental  financing; \n(iii) transparent and efficient procurement of goods and services; and (iv) timely, reliable, and \npublicly accessible accounts. \n \n65.  Outcome  8:  Transparent  and  User-Friendly  Budgets  within  MTBF.  Under \nsubprogram 1, MTBF will be finalized and the information content and presentation of budget \ndocuments will be improved.  Measures under the subsequent subprograms will progressively \nfurther improve MTBF, including its integration with the national MTBF developed at the federal \nlevel;  enhance  the  information  content;  and  append  annual  accounts  of  PSOs  to  budget \ndocuments. \n \n66.  Outcome  9:  Transparent  and  Rule-Based  Systems  of  Intergovernmental \nFinancing. An important measure to provide more clarity to districts about their allocations in \nline with their newly enhanced mandate is the finalization of fiscal awards through PFC. For full \n ", "      19\ntransparency, PFC reports on intergovernmental fiscal relations will be published. In addition, a \ndialogue  with  civil  society  has  been  initiated  under  subprogram  1  to  promote  informed \ndiscussion of merits of alternative intergovernmental grant and program financing modalities for \nthe implementation of provincial policy priorities. Measures under the subsequent subprograms \nwill institute an improved performance and incentive-based grants system for local governments \nproviding for (i) equalization across local governments, and (ii) rewards for greater fiscal effort \nby local governments and for good performance with pro-poor targeting of services delivery. \n \n67.  Outcome  10:  Transparent  and  Efficient  Procurement  of  Goods  and  Services. \nTransparent and simplified purchase procedures for goods and services by provincial and local \ngovernments are essential for efficient and accountable utilization of public finances, and will be \ndeveloped under subprogram 1, with support from the Decentralization Support Program.24 \nContinued capacity building of provincial and local government procurement agencies will be \nundertaken during subprograms 2 and 3 to increase public transparency and accountability in \nprocurement processes. \n \n68.  Outcome 11: Timely, Reliable, and Publicly Accessible Accounts. The  provincial \ngovernment is implementing agreements on the Project for Integrated Financial Reporting and \nAuditing,  with  support  from  the  World  Bank.  They  cover  a  wide  range  of  public  sector \naccounting and auditing reforms. Under subprogram 1, the province will further strengthen the \ncapacity of its Finance Department and local governments to implement those reforms. The \npublic sector will also adopt new budgetary classification for accounting of financial transactions. \nMoreover, fiscal data will be reconciled and the PAC strengthened. Subprograms 2 and 3 will \ncontinue  with  capacity  building,  with  extension  of  training  (supported  by  the  Project  for \nIntegrated Financial Reporting and Auditing). Accounts codes under the new accounting model \nwill be adopted, and systems and accountability mechanisms that ensure application of rules \nwill  be  established.  The  financial  rules  to  ensure  consistency  with  the  new  accounting \nframework will be revised. PAC meetings will take place regularly to monitor implementation of \nPAC directives. \n \n2.  Reforming Processes and Institutions for Pro-Poor Service Delivery \n \n69.  Component 2 seeks to adjust institutional arrangements for enhanced pro-poor impact of \npublic expenditure and improved service delivery through (i) improved strategic programming of \ninvestments for poverty reduction; and (ii) restructuring government, administration, and human \nresources development.  \n \na.  KRA 4: Improve Strategic Programming of Investments for Poverty \n  Reduction \n \n70.  Improved strategic programming of investments for poverty reduction  will result from \ndevelopment of (i) a medium-term, poverty-focused, investment strategy; (ii) effective systems \nand procedures to operationalize provincial goals and priorities (with initial focus on health, \neducation, and municipal services); and (iii) improved monitoring, feedback, and evaluation \nsystems. \n \n71.

Measures under the \nsubsequent  subprograms  will  formulate  implementation  of  strategies,  policies,  and  plans; \ncontinue strengthening capacity of the Planning and Development Department (P&DD) for \nstrategic planning; and implement recommendations for improvement in laws and policies. \n \n72.  Outcome 13: Effective Systems and Procedures to Operationalize Provincial Goals \nand Priorities (with initial focus on health, education, and municipal services). Measures under \nsubprogram 1 will develop mechanisms to generate sector-wise reform and outcome-based \ndevelopment  plans  and  implementation  strategies  to  direct  MTBF.  Measures  under  the \nsubsequent subprograms  will  implement  revised  procedures  for  preparation  of  the  annual \ndevelopment program and sector development programs.  \n \n73.  Outcome 14: Improved Monitoring, Feedback, and Evaluation Systems. Measures \nunder subprogram 1 will develop a set of reporting and feedback tools.  Measures under the \nsubsequent  subprograms  will  then  further  improve  and  implement  the  new  performance \nmonitoring and evaluation systems. \n   \nb.  KRA 5: Restructure and Strengthen Government, Administration, \n  and Human Resource Development \n \n74.  Administrative restructuring of government and human resources development will result \nfrom (i) reform, restructuring, and capacity enhancement of provincial agencies responsible for \npolicy, planning, fiscal, and financial management; (ii) rationalization of provincial staffing and \nenhanced skill levels; (iii) a merit-based, transparent, and institutionalized system of recruitment, \npromotions, and transfers; and (iv) mainstreamed commitments on gender.  \n \n75.  Outcome 15: Reform, Restructure, and Enhance Capacity of Provincial Agencies \nResponsible for Policy, Planning and Fiscal and Financial Management. Measures under \nsubprogram 1 will initiate the administrative restructuring and strengthening of P&DD and the \nFinance Department. Institutional development and restructuring plans will be further detailed \nwith TA support. Subprograms 2 and 3 will implement the restructuring plans and undertake \ncapacity building of selected departments. It will also enhance the capacity of line departments \nfor drafting consistent rules, regulations, and laws. \n \n76.  Outcome 16: Rationalization of Provincial  Staffing and Enhanced Skill Levels. \nUnder subprogram 1, a  census of provincial employees will be  carried  out  and  a  human \nresources database will be developed. Plans for staffing adjustment (ensuring social protection) \nand sustainable skills development in the public service will be formulated. Measures under the \nsubsequent subprograms seek a reduction in provincial staff levels, including transfers of staff \nfrom provincial to district governments, while assuring social obligations for protection of labor \nrights.  Upgrading  of  skills  will  take  place  through  implementation  of  continued  education \nprograms. \n \n77.  Outcome  17:  Introduction  of  Merit-based,  Transparent  and  Institutionalized \nSystem of Recruitment, Promotions, and Transfers. Measures under subprogram 1 will \nintroduce a merit-based, transparent, and institutionalized system of recruitment, promotions, \nand transfers; strengthen the Public Service Commission; and improve career planning and \n ", "      21\nmanagement  processes.  Measures  under  the  subsequent  subprograms  will  support \nimplementation of new rules and the monitoring of compliance and effectiveness. \n \n78.  Outcome 18: Mainstreamed Commitments on Gender. Measures under subprogram \n1 comprise approval and initiation of implementation of GRAP through integration in policy (with \nimplementation  support  through  separate  TA  by  ADB  under  the  Decentralization  Support \nProgram). Under subprograms 2 and 3, the comprehensive implementation of GRAP will follow. \n \n3.  Creating Opportunities for Growth and Income Generation through Private Sector \nDevelopment \n \n79.  The  unexploited  strength  of  Punjab\u2019s  economy  lies  in  its  considerable  potential  in \nagriculture and supply of human resources for skill-based industries. Creating employment \nopportunities in the private sector, including rural areas where the majority of Punjab\u2019s poor live, \nis key for accelerating growth and sustained poverty reduction. Component 3 seeks to create a \nconducive environment for private sector development, with a shift of government away from \ndirection,  control,  and  direct  involvement  in  operations  toward  promotion,  facilitation,  and \nsupport for public-private partnerships.  \n \na.  KRA 6: Regulatory and Administrative Reforms for Private Sector \n  Development and Public-Private Partnership \n \n80.  Regulatory and administrative reforms for private sector development and public-private \npartnerships  will  support  (i) streamlined  regulations  and  their  effective  implementation  for \nsustainable private sector development; (ii) transparent security of property rights and improved \nutilization of land assets, through an effective land registration and management system; and \n(iii) an  effective  mechanism  for  facilitation  of  investment,  public-private  partnerships,  and \nemployment generation.  \n \n81.  Outcome  19:  Streamlined  Regulations  and  their  Effective  Implementation  for \nSustainable  Private  Sector  Development.  Measures  under  subprogram  1  will  remove \nregulatory restrictions and business irritants (including irrational inspections) to private sector \ndevelopment  and  modernize  labor  policies,  rules,  and  mechanisms  for  implementation. \nMeasures under the subsequent subprograms will continue the dialogue with stakeholders \n(including  the  private  sector)  for  further  improvements  in  the  regulatory  environment,  and \nmonitor effectiveness and compliance with revised regulations.  This will also  upgrade the \ncapacity of the provincial government to interface effectively with the private sector for contract \nmanagement and public-private partnerships.  \n \n82.  Outcome 20: Transparent Security of Property Rights and Improved Utilization of \nLand  Assets.  Measures  under  subprogram  1  will  undertake  required  studies  for  the \nestablishment of a land and property registry, and will reach agreement on implementation \nplans. Measures under the subsequent subprograms will then implement the plans and put into \noperation an effective land registry. \n \n83.  Outcome 21: Effective Mechanism for Facilitation of Investment, Public-Private \nPartnerships,  and  Employment  Generation.  Subprogram  1  will  redefine  the  provincial \ngovernment\u2019s role in promotion of investment, and provide effective programs and value-added \nservices for investment facilitation. Under subprogram 1, the provincial government will review \nits  role  and  support  administrative  reforms  in  the  Industries,  Commerce  and  Investment \nDepartment,  constitute  the  Punjab  Investment  Board  with  private  sector  participation,  and \n   ", "22  \ninitiate  capacity  building  of  key  departments  for  private  sector  regulation  and  contract \nmanagement.  Measures  under  subprograms  2  and  3  will  further  upgrade  capacity  of  the \nprovincial government to interface effectively with the private sector and contract managements. \n   \nb.  KRA 7: Reduce Direct Public Sector Involvement in Economic and/or \n  Commercial Operations \n \n84.  Outcome  22:  Reform  of  PSOs  Involved  in  Economic/Commercial  Activities:  \nRestructure, Privatize or Close. To reduce direct public sector involvement in economic \nactivities of a commercial nature,  PSOs involved in economic/commercial activities will be \nrestructured, privatized, or closed. The role of PSOs will be reviewed under subprogram 1, and \nbase data on PSOs will be improved. Privatization and divestment of government ownership in \nselected PSOs of a commercial nature will be initiated, together with improvements in corporate \ngovernance in PSOs that will be retained in the public sector to deliver basic social services. \nThe reforms will be deepened under subprograms 2 and 3, to privatize or close PSOs (in case \nof nonviability) and restructure selected PSOs that are to remain in the public domain. \n \nC.  Important Features \n \n85.  An important feature of the Program is the application of the cluster modality with a \nholistic approach to reform over the medium term  and a focus on outcomes. An innovative \nfeature is the flexibility embedded in the program design that allows for adjustment of actions to \nachieve agreed progress performance targets toward final outcomes. Thus, the program cluster \nis not merely a collection of three stand-alone subprograms formulated as blueprints in a \nsequential  manner,  but  aims  to  capture  a  dynamic  process  by  integrating  various  reform \ninitiatives over a medium-term time frame with flexibility for performance-based adjustments. \nSubprogram 1 represents the first step in this process. \n \n86.  Another important feature relates to the allocation of loan proceeds for creating fiscal \nspace in a sustainable manner within a defined medium-term fiscal framework, rather than one-\noff financing of incremental expenditures. \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n \n87.  Loan  Amount  and  Program  Cost.  The  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of \n\u00a521,761,000,000 ($200 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance \nsubprogram 1 of the PRMP, as described in the development policy letter and the attached \npolicy matrix. The loan amount was determined taking into account the cost and strength of the \nstructural reforms as well as medium-term fiscal projections and requirements to implement the \nproposed reforms. The costs of structural adjustment for the PRMP over 5 years (2003\u20132008) \nare estimated to be about PRs69 billion ($1,190 million equivalent), comprising the following \nmain components: \n(i)  revenue loss through rationalization and elimination of nonbuoyant taxes \n($86 million); \n(ii)  restructuring of provincial liabilities: debt write-off and provisioning against \nguarantees ($431 million); \n(iii)  funding of pension liabilities and recapitalization of the General Provident Fund \n($293 million); \n(iv)  reform of provincial public administration and civil service ($172 million); and \n ", "      23\n(v)  restructuring/liquidation of PSOs (including voluntary retirement scheme) \n($207 million). \n \nMedium-term fiscal projections are in Appendix 6. Costing details and underlying assumptions \nare in Appendix 7. \n \n88.  Terms and Conditions. The loan will have a 15-year term including a grace period of 3 \nyears, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s  London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of \n0.5% (the fee will be capitalized in the loan), and such other terms and conditions as set forth in \nthe draft Loan Agreement. The federal Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its \ndecision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n89.  Interest rate and currency conversion options may be exercised in accordance with the \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement, the loan regulations, and ADB\u2019s \nconversion guidelines. \n \n90.  Onlending to the Government of Punjab. The federal Government agreed to make the \nproceeds from the loan available to the government of Punjab in domestic currency, at mutually \nagreed terms and conditions that are similar to those given by ADB. The federal Government \nwill assume the foreign exchange risk, and the government of Punjab will assume the interest \nrate risk.  \n \n91.  Counterpart Funds. The counterpart funds to be generated out of the loan proceeds in \ndomestic currency will be used to finance the cost of structural  adjustment, including the \nestablishment  of  funds  and  facilities  as  well  as  measures  under  the  PRMP  that  create \nsustainable fiscal space for implementation of the agreed MTBF, and financing of high-priority \nsocial and human development programs targeted at  the poor. Specifically, the proceeds of \nsubprogram 1 will be used to restructure provincial debt through retirement of high-interest \nCDLs by at least PRs7 billion, and any other costs directly related to the implementation of the \nprogram, including capitalization of the General Provident Fund. The federal Government and \nthe government of Punjab will certify the utilization of counterpart funds in line with the loan \nagreements through audited statements acceptable to ADB. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Program Management \n \n92.  Execution and Implementation Arrangements. The government of Punjab will be \nresponsible for program implementation and the effective utilization of the counterpart funds \ngenerated from loan proceeds, and will enter into a Program Agreement with ADB. P&DD will \nbe the EA for the PRMP cluster, including the TA loan. The EA has established and adequately \nstaffed a Program Management Unit (PMU) during processing of the Program to strengthen \nownership and understanding of procedures early in the process. The EA will coordinate efforts \nof all implementing agencies (IAs) to ensure that targeted policy achievements are met and \nspecific actions are taken, will liaise with ADB on all program administration matters, and will \n   ", "24  \ninform the public on implementation progress through electronic links to the PRMP under the \nweb site of the government of Punjab.25 \n \n93.  Principal IA responsibilities for subprogram 1 under the PRMP will reside with the \nFinance Department and P&DD for components 1 and 2, respectively. Each IA will have full \nresponsibility for implementation of program components within its mandate. Responsibilities, \ndeliverables, and reporting requirements of the EA, IAs, and other agencies involved, such as \nthe  Service  and  General  Administration  Department;  Management  and  Professional \nDevelopment  Department;  Industries,  Commerce  and  Investment  Department;  Irrigation \nDepartment; Education Department; and Health Department, will be detailed in the program \nadministration memorandum. P&DD will have overall responsibility for implementation of the \nelements outlined in the memorandum.  \n \n94.  Program Steering and Oversight Arrangements. This is the first reform program loan \ndirectly supporting a  provincial  adjustment  program  in  Punjab.  The  policy  outcomes  and \nachievements are comprehensive and require the coordinated action both of core service \ndepartments and of selected line departments as well as liaison with local governments at \ndistrict and tehsil levels. To achieve the necessary levels of policy and program oversight, a \nhigh-level steering committee has been formed, chaired by the chief secretary and comprising, \nas members, the chairperson of P&DD; additional chief of the Secretary Service and General \nAdministration Department; the finance secretary; secretaries of other IAs; and at least three \nrepresentatives of civil society and the private sector. This recognizes both the need to draw on \nthe best available technical expertise in the wider community and to establish in the public \ndomain credibility for the committee. The committee will meet as needed (but at least quarterly) \nto take key decisions during both program formulation and implementation. The PMU will be the \nsecretariat to the committee. \n \n95.  Coordination  with  other  Reforms  Initiatives.  Punjab  has  made  significant \ncommitments to reform programs supported by ADB and other funding agencies, most notably \nthe Access to Justice Program,26 the Decentralization Support Program (footnote 24), and \nGRAP (footnote 20)\u2014concerned in essence with improved governance in service delivery\u2014as \nwell as the Project for Integrated Financial Reporting and Auditing, the Agriculture Program, and \nthe Rural Finance Sector Development Program to support accountability and efficient markets. \nFurther, the  provincial government\u2019s forthcoming engagement in the World Bank-supported \nPunjab Education Sector Reform Program and the proposed Decentralized Social Service \nProgram included in ADB\u2019s country strategy  and program for Pakistan in 2004 are both of \nparticular importance to the reforms supported by the PRMP. In addition, sector development \nprograms are in preparation at a national level that will require provincial commitments to \nsupport  small  and  medium  enterprise  development  and  public-private  infrastructure.  While \nrecognizing the need to clearly delineate the roles, responsibilities, and commitments made \nunder each separate program, the government of Punjab plans to continue to adopt a holistic \napproach to reforms to create synergies between the various segments of reforms. The PMU \nwill closely liaise on the implementation level with all concerned agencies of reform programs to \nensure adequate coordination.  \n \n96.  Role of the Federal Government. The federal Government will be the Borrower of the \nprogram loan and will channel the funds from ADB to the government of Punjab. The federal \n                                                 \n25 http://www.punjab.gov.pk. \n26 ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nIslamic Republic of Pakistan for Access to Justice Program. Manila. \n ", "      25\nGovernment will ensure that adequate information is made available to the government of \nPunjab to facilitate implementation of certain policy measures linked to federal initiatives, such \nas  pension  reform  or  MTBF,  so  as  to  promote  consistency  and,  to  the  extent  possible, \nintegration of approaches. The federal Government will also support the reprofiling of the \ngovernment of Punjab\u2019s debt through early repayment by the latter of expensive domestic loans. \nThe government of Punjab will provide relevant information on implementation progress to \nfacilitate monitoring of the utilization of the loan proceeds by the Borrower.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n97.  The program cluster is expected to be fully implemented by 30 June 2008. At the end of \nthe  implementation  period,  the  agreed  outcomes  are  expected  to  be  achieved  fully.  The \ncompletion date for subprogram 1 is 31 December 2004. Based on progress in implementation \nunder subprogram 1 and the SPR, proposals for funding of subprograms 2 and 3 are expected \nto  be  submitted  for  separate  ADB  board  consideration  in  2005  and  2006,  respectively. \nSubprograms 2 and 3 may be designed as single or multitranche operations, based on progress \nin meeting further performance targets. \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement \n \n98.  The foreign exchange proceeds of the loan will be utilized to finance the full foreign \nexchange costs, excluding local duties and taxes, of eligible imports produced in and procured \nfrom ADB member countries, other than ineligible items.27 A list of ineligible items is in Appendix \n8. All procurement under the Program loan will be undertaken through normal commercial \npractices  for  the  private  sector  or  the  Government\u2019s  prescribed  procurement  procedures \nacceptable to ADB, with due consideration to economy and efficiency.  \n \n99.  Disbursements under the Program loan will be made in line with ADB\u2018s simplified \ndisbursement procedures and audit requirements.28 To withdraw the proceeds of the loan, the \nBorrower will certify that the value of eligible imports exceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected \ndisbursements under the Program loan in a given period. ADB will have the right to audit the \nuse of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification. \n \n4.  Tranching \n \n100.  The  loan  under  subprogram  1  will  be  disbursed  in  two  installments  based  on \nperformance in meeting specified tranche achievement targets. The first tranche, equivalent to \n$100 million, will become available after loan effectiveness. All first tranche achievement targets \nspecified in the policy matrix have been met. The second tranche will be released upon further \nachievement toward the program outcomes as agreed. Release of tranches can be advanced if \nprogress in meeting the achievement criteria is made faster than anticipated. \n \n101.  In order to measure progress and assess compliance with the achievement targets, \nspecific actions agreed between the federal Government and ADB are indicated in the policy \nmatrix  and  detailed  in  the  program  administration  memorandum.  ADB  and  the  federal \nGovernment will maintain a continued dialogue throughout program implementation, and a \ncertain degree of flexibility in adjusting specific actions during program implementation may be \n                                                 \n27 Eligible imports refer to total imports minus imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports specified in the \nlist of ineligible items, and  imports already financed by ADB or other international and bilateral development \nagencies.  \n28 ADB. 1998.

Manila. \n   ", "26  \naccommodated to best achieve the outcomes at the end of the subprogram period, if it can \ncredibly be demonstrated that the agreed achievements can be reached by alternative actions. \n \n5.  Program Monitoring, Reporting, and Consultations \n \n102.  To  monitor  implementation  of  the  PRMP,  the  government  of  Punjab  will  prepare \nquarterly  progress  reports  as  well  as  an  annual  report  on  program  implementation  for \nsubmission to ADB, and regularly update the project web site. ADB will regularly and jointly with \nthe government of Punjab conduct progress reviews, at least on a semiannual basis, to evaluate \ncompliance with the conditions and advise the government of Punjab on actions required to \nkeep program implementation on course. The government of Punjab will also prepare a midyear \nreport on its budget performance not later than 6 months after the start of each fiscal year and \nidentify corrective measures as required, as well as a final report on project completion.  \n \n103.  A key feature of the PRMP cluster is the SPR. The PRMP cluster allows the government \nof Punjab to design proposed subprograms 2 and 3 based on implementation of studies \nundertaken and experience gained under subprogram 1 (including capacity-building TA) and to \nreflect changes that may occur in the external environment over the entire cluster period. Each \nsubsequent  subprogram  will  be  formulated  on  the  basis  of  the  SPR.  The  SPR  will  be \nundertaken at the end of each subprogram by a committee of representatives of the EA, each \nIA, the steering committee, and ADB. The SPR will issue a report that (i) assesses compliance \nwith  tranche  conditions  under  the  current  subprogram,  (ii) assesses  progress  with \nimplementation of complementary activities under the government of Punjab\u2019s overall reform \nprogram and the TA loan, and (iii) defines requirements for adjustments to activities to be \nundertaken under the proposed subsequent subprograms.  \n \n104.  The first SPR will be undertaken prior to release of the second tranche of subprogram 1, \nto identify initial lessons learned and formulate the initial outline for subprogram 2. The final \nSPR of subprogram 1 will be undertaken immediately prior to the conclusion of subprogram 1 to \nreview compliance with the tranche 2 achievements and to examine and finalize the design of \nsubprogram 2. The timing and terms of reference for SPRs under each of subprograms 2 and 3 \nwill be finalized during the SPR for the preceding subprogram. Satisfactory progress in the SPR \nprocess  will  be  a  condition  for  release  of  the  second  tranche  of  subprogram  1,  and  the \nprocessing and release of the loans under each subsequent subprograms.  \n \n105.  The reform process will involve periodic consultation with nongovernment actors, and \npublic access to information (both on the reforms proposed and progress with implementation), \nsystematic consultation with civil society organizations, establishment of special-purpose forums \n(such as the PDF), and arrangements for third-party validation of selected reform outcomes.  \n \n6.  Accounting and Auditing \n \n106.  The federal and provincial governments will maintain separate accounts and records for \nthe loan, including separate budget heads of accounts for each of the items of expenditure \nunder the Program in accordance with sound accounting principles. Relevant accounts will be \naudited annually in accordance with standards acceptable to ADB, and the Government will \nprovide certified copies of the same to ADB promptly after their preparation but not later than 9 \nmonths after the close of the fiscal year to which the accounts refer. \n \n \n ", "      27\nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN \n \n107.  To enhance capacity for implementation and sustainability of the PRMP reform agenda, \na TA loan is proposed for supporting public resource management reforms in Punjab.  \n \n108.  Scope. The TA seeks to (i) support assessments and analytical studies in key policy and \nreform areas addressed under the PRMP; (ii) develop strategies to improve fiscal sustainability \nand public service delivery; and (iii) build capacity to carry out institutional reforms in key public \nsector departments including P&DD; Finance Department; Service and General Administration \nDepartment; and Industries, Commerce and Investment Department. The TA will comprise eight \ncomponents, for (i) revenue and tax administration reform; (ii) public expenditure and financial \nmanagement (including medium-term budgeting, intergovernmental financing, procurement and \nfinancial management); (iii) contingent liability management and pension reform; (iv) strategic \nplanning  systems  and  change  management;  (v)  human  resources  management;  (vi) land \nregistration reform; (vii) PSO reform (including preparation for privatization, liquidation, and \ncorporate restructuring); and (viii) implementation support (including monitoring and evaluation). \n \n109.  Implementation Arrangements. P&DD will be the EA, and the TA will be implemented \nin  close  coordination  with  other  departments  and  agencies,  in  particular  the  Finance \nDepartment. The various IAs will be fully responsible for their respective components under the \nTA. The TA loan will be implemented in a phased manner and linked with implementation \nprogress of the program cluster. The TA is expected to be completed by December 2005, with \nexpenditure commencing in FY2004. Consulting services will be provided through quality and \ncost-based selection by one or more consulting firms or individual consultants recruited in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. It is expected that there will be \nabout eight separate contract packages for the various TA components (para. 108). In case of \nselection of consulting firms, simplified technical proposals will be used. The TA loan will \nemphasize the mobilization of expertise available within Pakistan. Capacity building to be \nsupported under the TA loan will focus on training and skills development services that can be \ndelivered by Pakistani private and/or public sector institutions and, in particular, activities that \ncan be integrated within the normal functioning of the concerned client agencies.  \n \n110.  Amount, Terms, and Conditions. The cost of the TA is estimated to be $5.55 million \nequivalent, comprising foreign exchange costs of about $0.84 million and local currency costs of \n$4.71 million  equivalent.  The  federal  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $4.0 million \nequivalent from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the TA. The loan will have a \nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; and such other terms and conditions as set \nforth in the draft TA Loan Agreement. \n \n111.  Details  of  the  objectives,  scope,  costs,  and  financing  as  well  as  implementation \narrangements are provided in Appendix 9. \n \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits \n \n112.  The  Program  is  expected  to  yield  high  benefits  by  supporting  a  comprehensive \nadjustment in public service delivery, which should positively affect the livelihood of the more \nthan 80 million people who live in Punjab, including the 33% of them who are poor. Sustainable \n   ", "28  \npro-poor public service delivery under the program is derived from (i) measures that improve \nfiscal discipline and generate fiscal space for increased spending in high-priority areas for \npoverty reduction as outlined in the PPRSP; (ii) improved governance mechanisms, institutional \narrangements,  and  accountability  for  expenditure  management  and  service  delivery;  and \n(iii) creation of an environment that offers improved opportunities for growth, employment, and \nincome generation.  \n \n113.  Identifiable benefits will accrue over the medium term in line with the outcomes detailed \nin the program framework and policy matrix. Specific and immediate impacts of subprogram 1 \nwill relate to fiscal restructuring and utilization of loan proceeds for debt restructuring, which will \ncreate about PRs1 billion of additional fiscal space per annum in a sustainable manner. This will \nbe utilized for improved pro-poor service delivery in high-priority social sectors, including O&M \nof existing facilities, in line with the agreed medium-term fiscal framework. In addition, a number \nof specific actions directly targeted to the poor are included and quantified in the policy matrix, \nsuch as enhanced pro-poor expenditures under outcome 7. \n \nB.  Impacts \n \n114.  The Program is expected to have a positive impact on poverty reduction by facilitating a \nshift  toward  increased  and  sustainable  social  sector  spending  based  on  participatory \napproaches. The impact on labor markets, prices, net public transfers, and access to public \ngoods and services is expected to be positive in the long run. There are no significant adverse \nimpacts directly associated with the Program, although some adjustment may take place in the \nprovincial civil service. It is expected that basic labor rights of any affected employees will be \nprotected. The Program will also reduce the gender bias in public sector employment. A \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy and poverty impact assessment of the Program \nis in Appendix 10. Integration of gender reforms under the PRMP is in Appendix 11. \n \n115.  By its very nature, the proposed program loan will not have any direct or immediate \nenvironmental impacts. Any linkages of the policy interventions to any indirect environmental \nimpacts, whether beneficial or adverse, are tenuous. The Program does, however, support the \nestablishment of an Environment Department within the government of Punjab and effective \nimplementation  of  environmental  policies  and  standards  for  sustainable  private  sector \ndevelopment. The proposed program loan will not have any involuntary resettlement component \nor any impact on indigenous people.  \n \nC.  Risks \n \n116.  The  realization  of  program  benefits  and  impacts  will  depend  on  a  number  of \nassumptions that are subject to a variety of risks. Mitigating measures have been integrated in \nthe program design as appropriate, taking account of past experiences in program lending in \nPakistan and elsewhere. \n \n117.  Political and Continuity Risks. There have been many instances in Pakistan where \nprogram agreements faced considerable implementation delays or were not fully implemented \ndue to political pressures, often linked to a change in government (which have occurred \nfrequently over the past decade). Opposition to reform has generally been encountered at both \nthe political and bureaucratic levels, in particular when privatization or downsizing measures or \nreduction of subsidies have been involved. Other than for pure political motives, much of the \nopposition  stems  from  misinformation  and  lack  of  clear  communication  about  program \nimplications to key stakeholders.  \n ", "      29\n \n118.  In Punjab, the risk of opposition to reform at the political level is less than in the other \nprovinces of Pakistan or at the federal level. The elections in October 2002 gave a clear majority \nmandate to the party most closely associated with the administration that initiated Pakistan\u2019s \nreform agenda over the past 3 years. Some opposition to certain aspects of the reforms initiated \nis to be expected as part of a democratic process and is to be taken up through public debate. \nThe Government, for its part, has demonstrated clear commitment to the Program through \nsignificant upfront actions.  \n \n119.  In addition, measures are proposed under the Program to build consensus and strong \nstakeholder  support  for  the  Program,  including  stakeholder  consultation  and  effective \ncommunications to inform the public about the benefits of the Program. An important element in \nthis was the introduction of a PDF in 2003, which is set to become an annual event. This will \nplace external pressure on key policy and decision makers to keep the reform process intact. In \ncase of civil service or PSO reforms, measures will also be designed in the Program to \nencourage those directly affected to understand the benefits of the Program more fully.  \n \n120.  Governance and Bureaucratic Risks. The Program aims to reduce abuse of power \nand  rent-seeking  opportunities,  and  there  is  a  risk  that  reform  efforts  are  going  to  be \nundermined or delayed by those who are going to lose from the greater transparency and \naccountability that the Program will introduce. To mitigate such risks, strong ownership and \nsupport for the Program has been created at the highest political and bureaucratic levels and an \neffective  mechanism  for  program  oversight  established,  including  representatives  of  civil \nsociety.  Moreover,  the  Program  advocates  the  creation  and  strengthening  of  governance-\nrelated institutions, such as the PAC and Public Service Commission.  \n \n121.  Incentive and Design Risks. Despite implementation of agreed measures to adjust the \nfiscal, governance, and institutional framework for improved public service delivery, there is a \nrisk of government failure due to incentive incompatibilities. Government employees may not be \nwilling to be subjected to greater transparency and performance monitoring, and the private \nsector may not respond to the incentives offered to participate in public service delivery. To \nmanage these risks, a detailed and dynamic monitoring system will measure performance and \nfailures in a timely manner to allow for readjustment of design parameters, which can be \naccommodated within the flexible program modality. This will be complemented through active \nstakeholder consultation and public awareness campaigns; funding for such activities has been \nincluded in the TA loan. A key aspect to improve public service delivery will be to create \nalternative means for service delivery through fair competition and increased private sector \nparticipation that offers opportunities to a wider range of service providers with market-based \nrewards. \n \n122.  Institutional and Implementation Risks. The Program is comprehensive in nature and \nwill place considerable demand on institutional capacities, in particular as Punjab so far has only \nlimited experience in implementation of program-type operations. Some progress to enhance \nprovincial government capacity has been made with the appointment of advisors from the \nprivate sector, and there are some respected research and academic institutions in Punjab and \nPakistan that may be called upon on a contractual basis to augment analytical capacities. \nHowever, the authorities will need to intensify their efforts in this respect  to ensure that the \nreforms translate into tangible improvements, and comprehensive TA will be provided to support \nthe institutional strengthening measures required for successful implementation. There is a also \nrisk of slower than expected program implementation due to delays in taking critical decisions \nand adopting required actions on studies and outputs produced under TA. Other institutional \n   ", "30  \nrisks also relate to the failure to ensure adequate coordination with other ongoing or planned \nreform activities, resulting in possible duplication or contradiction of measures; change in key \npersonnel for program implementation; and absence of decision-making powers resulting in \nbureaucratic delays in implementation. To minimize those risks, the PMU will draw, to the extent \npossible, on existing infrastructure, experiences, and lessons learned from other programs. \nAdequate assurances on timely decision making and continuity of key program personnel have \nbeen included in the loan documents. \n \n123.  Macroeconomic and Exogenous Risks. Pakistan\u2019s macroeconomic parameters have \nstrengthened continuously and considerably over the past 3 years but the country remains \nhighly vulnerable to exogenous shocks and is dependent on geopolitical developments. Slower \nthan expected winding down of regional tensions or continued regional conflicts could adversely \naffect growth and fiscal projections. While some of the risks are beyond the control of the \nprovincial and federal governments, the federal Government has put in place a consistent \neconomic management strategy that aims to reduce debt and help ensure fiscal stabilization, \nwith support from IMF, to mitigate macroeconomic vulnerabilities. \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n124.  The federal Government and the government of Punjab have given the following \nassurances, in addition to the standard assurances, which have been incorporated in the loan \ndocuments: \n(i)  Continuity of reforms. The government of Punjab will carry out the policies and \nactions in accordance with the schedule of policy reforms contained in the policy \nmatrix as agreed upon between the government of Punjab and ADB, and ensure \nsustainability of the reforms beyond the program period.  \n(ii)  Contingent liabilities and financial sustainability. The government of Punjab \nwill move toward full funding of pension liabilities and utilize all net flows on the \nGeneral Provident Fund account to recapitalize the fund (until the fund has been \nfully  capitalized)  and  not  on  financing  of  any  other  government  of  Punjab \nexpenditures.  \n(iii)  Effective program management. The government of Punjab will take all steps \nand  actions,  including  provision  of  staff  resources  to  ensure  satisfactory \ncompletion in a timely manner of all program outputs. The government of Punjab \nwill fully finance the establishment of the PMU from its own resources, and make \nsufficient budgetary allocations. The government of Punjab will ensure that (i) the \nchief  secretary  of  the  province  will  oversee  program  implementation  and \nundertake to resolve any difficulties that should arise across departments; (ii) the \nP&DD chairperson will be responsible for coordination and management of the \nProgram and report to the chief secretary of the province on implementation \nprogress; and (iii) critical program staff and decision makers will remain in their \nposition on a full-time basis for a reasonable duration to ensure continuity in the \nimplementation of the Program. The  government of Punjab will implement the \nProgram and monitor and evaluate its performance in line with the program \nadministration memorandum as agreed with ADB. \n ", "      31\n(iv)  Subprogram review. The government of Punjab will undertake the SPR process \nin  consultation  with  ADB  prior  to  release  of  the  second  tranche  under \nsubprogram 1 and formulation of subprograms 2 and 3. Satisfactory progress in \nthe SPR process will be a condition for such release. The review will include \nreview of fiscal performance and updated fiscal estimates, which will be in line \nwith the MTBFs to be developed at both the federal and provincial levels. \n(v)  Technical assistance. The government of Punjab will ensure that in carrying out \nthe policy measures and activities included under the Program and the policy \nmatrix, due consideration will be given to the findings and recommendations of \nthe TA loan. The government of Punjab will allow ADB to provide comments on \nthe findings and recommendations of the TA, for consideration in the policy \nmeasures. The government of Punjab will make adequate funding provision for \nthe timely implementation of the TA project. \n(vi)  Counterpart funds. The federal Government will transfer the counterpart funds \ngenerated under the loan to the government of Punjab in domestic currency on \nmutually agreed terms and conditions. The federal Government will assume the \nforeign exchange risk, and the government of Punjab will bear the interest rate \nfluctuation risk. The government of Punjab will use the counterpart funds to \nfinance the structural adjustment measures agreed under the Program, including \nrepayment of CDLs of at least PRs7 billion and other costs directly related to the \nimplementation of the Program, including capitalization of the General Provident \nFund.  \n(vii)  Coordination of reforms. The  federal Government will ensure that adequate \ninformation  is  made  available  to  the  government  of  Punjab  to  facilitate \nconsistency  of  fiscal  projections  with  the  federal  Government.  The  federal \nGovernment will work to develop a credible MTBF at the national level, including \nNFC projections, and work with the provincial governments toward an integrated \nnational  MTBF.  The  government  of  Punjab  will  coordinate  pension  reform \nmeasures  with  initiatives  at  the  federal  level  to  ensure  consistency  in \napproaches.  \n \nB.  Conditions for Program Loan Effectiveness \n \n125.  The following conditions for loan effectiveness have been incorporated into the Loan \nAgreement: \n \n(i)   the TA Loan Agreement will have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of \nthe Borrower, and all conditions precedent to its effectiveness (other than those \nrequiring  the  effectiveness  of  the  program  Loan  Agreement)  will  have  been \nfulfilled; and \n(ii)  the PMU will have been established and adequately staffed, and assigned proper \nfunctions and powers to the mutual satisfaction of the Borrower and ADB. \n \nC.  Conditions for TA Loan Effectiveness \n \n126.  The following conditions for loan effectiveness have been incorporated into the Loan \nAgreement: \n \n   ", "32  \n(i)   the program Loan Agreement will have been duly executed and delivered on \nbehalf of the Borrower, and all conditions precedent to its effectiveness (other \nthan those requiring the effectiveness of the TA Loan Agreement) will have been \nfulfilled; and \n(ii)  the Planning Commission pro-forma 2 for the TA loan has been duly approved by \nthe competent authority. \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n127.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n(i)  the  program  cluster  concept  of  $500,000,000  for  the  Punjab  Resource \nManagement Program in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan;  \n \n(ii)  the loan of  \u00a521,761,000,000 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Punjab \nResource  Management  subprogram  1  of  the  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital  resources  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility; a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 \nyears; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft Loan and Program Agreements presented to the \nBoard; and \n \n(iii)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 2,794,000 to \nthe  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Supporting  Public  Resource \nManagement Reforms in Punjab Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \nwith an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the \nBoard. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                  Tadao Chino \n                  President \n \n \n13 November 2003 \n \n ", "    Appendix 1  33\nSECTOR ANALYSIS: KEY ISSUES IN PUBLIC RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IN PUNJAB \n \nA.   Punjab\u2019s Socioeconomic Performance \n \n1.  Punjab is Pakistan's largest province, with an estimated population of just over 82 million, \nor 55.6% of the total population. While provincial gross domestic product (GDP) is generally not \nreported in Pakistan, Punjab is estimated to contribute over half of total GDP in the country. An \nestimated 75.9% of the total irrigated area in Pakistan lies in the province. Of the four major \ncrops produced in Pakistan, Punjab produces over 80% of the country's wheat and cotton, 94% \nof the basmati (superior quality) rice, and nearly 65% of its sugarcane. Overall, it contributes \nabout 68% of the annual foodgrain production in the country. Although the province is not as \nurbanized as Sindh, with only 31% of the population residing in urban areas, it houses a \nsignificant proportion of Pakistan's large-scale manufacturing sector, and the bulk of the small-\nscale and cottage industry, much of it in basic textiles and food processing. \n \n2.  Again, as in the case of the other provinces, Punjab faces a crisis of public service \nperformance, with no coherent and focused strategy for poverty reduction and socioeconomic \ndevelopment, poor public sector fiscal and financial management, and extremely poor social \nservice delivery. Given the size of the population in the province, and the extent of economic \nactivity  it  generates,  Punjab's  development  performance  has  a  significant  impact  on  the \neconomy of Pakistan as a whole. As such, the functioning of the Punjab government in terms of \nresources and of fiscal and financial management has important implications for public finance \nmanagement in Pakistan, and the quality of Punjab government's delivery of basic social and \npublic services affects over half of the country's population. The institutional framework and \nsome of the key issues of public resource management in the province are as follows.  \n \nB.  Institutional Framework and Government Responsibilities \n \n3.  Constitutional Provisions. The allocation of responsibilities between the federal and \nprovincial governments1 is specified in the Fourth Schedule (under Article 4) of the Constitution \nof Pakistan of 1973. The Federal Legislative List sets out the functions to be performed by the \nfederal Government, while the Concurrent List mentions the functions that can be performed \neither by the federal or the provincial governments; although in the event of any conflict between \nthe legislation of the two tiers of government that of the federal Government prevails. Residual \nfunctions, not enumerated in either list, are the responsibility of the provinces.  \n \n4.  Federal Government Functions. According to the Federal Legislative List, the federal \nGovernment is responsible for regulatory as well as service functions. The service functions to \nbe performed by the federal Government include: defense; external affairs; currency, coinage, \nand  legal  tender;  foreign  exchange;  foreign  loans  and  foreign  aid;  nuclear  energy;  stock \nexchanges; national planning and economic coordination; national highways and strategic roads; \ngeological and meteorological surveys; census; railways; exploitation of minerals and natural \ngas; and development of industries. In addition, the federal Government is currently performing \nseveral  of  the  functions  specified  in  the  Concurrent  List.2  The  weak  financial  position  of \nprovincial governments and their overwhelming dependence on federal grants and transfers \ngreatly diluted their ability to perform several of the functions in the Concurrent List, compelling \nthem to relinquish some of their responsibilities to the federal Government.  \n                                                 \n1  Pakistan is a federation of four provinces: Punjab, Sindh, North-West Frontier Province, and Balochistan. \n2  This  includes  population  planning  and  social  welfare;  labor  exchanges;  training  establishments;  electricity; \nconservation of ancient and historical monuments and sites; curriculum, syllabus planning, running centers of \nexcellence and standards of education; and tourism.  \n   ", "34 Appendix 1 \n \n5.  Provincial  Government  Functions.  Functions  not  mentioned  in  either  the  Federal \nLegislative List  or  the  Concurrent  List  are  the  responsibility  of  the  provincial  governments. \nProvinces  have  sole  responsibility  for  law  and  order;  justice;  provincial  highways;  urban \ntransport; secondary and university education; agriculture extension and provision of inputs; \nirrigation and land reclamation; industries; and mineral resources. The provinces undertake \nsome of the functions in the Concurrent List, including social welfare, labor exchanges, and \ntraining establishments, and management of ancient and historical monuments and sites. \n \n6.  Local  Government  Functions  and  Decentralization  Reforms.  The  provincial \ngovernments  had  assigned  some  of  their  responsibilities  to  the  local  governments  through \nprovincial Local Government Ordinances (LGOs)3 and, where necessary, executive powers were \ndelegated to them under the rules and through administrative instructions. However, until the \ndevolution related reforms initiated in 2000, the provinces performed functions that should have \nbeen delegated to institutions at the local level. These were taken from the local governments \ndue to their financial and institutional inability to undertake them.  \n \n7.  In 2000, the Government of Pakistan launched a fundamental, and ambitious, program to \nrestructure administrative, functional, financial, and fiscal relations between different levels of \ngovernment. This effort to radically alter the  governance structures aims to transfer power \nthrough devolution of authority and granting of autonomy to lower formations. However, even \nafter these far-reaching reforms, local governments continue to derive their functional and fiscal \npowers from provincial legislation. The Constitution of Pakistan still does not recognize local \ngovernments as a separate tier of government with their own powers and functional domains, \nalthough a constitutional amendment has been proposed.4 Although the federal Government has \npublicly stated on various occasions that the new local government system is to stay, without \nconstitutional  protection,  provinces  will  continue  to  be  empowered  to  dismantle  the  local \ngovernment  system,  although  under  the  LGOs  of  2001  their  powers  to  overthrow  local \ngovernments have been curtailed. \n \n8.  Shifting Responsibilities between Provincial and Local Government. Under the new \nsystem, the role of the provincial governments will be transformed from that of a direct provider \nof some basic social and economic services to financing, regulating, and supervising local \ngovernments as primary delivery agents. The provinces continue to be responsible for the \nmanagement  of  consolidated  provincial  finances  and  fiscal  transfers  to  local  governments; \nexecution  of  provincial  development  programs;  delivery  of  province-wide  services  such  as \nirrigation,  road  networks,  and  tertiary  services;  responsibilities  relating  to  monitoring  and \nevaluation; and the establishment and operations of the regulatory framework that will govern \nprivate  sector  activity.  Basic  social  and  economic  services  including  elementary  education, \ncurative health, farm-to-market roads, rural development, and other municipal services are now \nthe exclusive preserve of local government. \n \n                                                 \n3  The Local Government Ordinances (LGOs) were passed in 1979, but have subsequently been subsumed by the \nLGOs of 2001. The 2001 LGOs define the constitution, functions, management, fiscal powers, and resource \narrangements for elected local governments at the district and lower levels and require the establishment of new \ninstitutions at the provincial level (e.g., Local Government Commission, the Provincial Finance Commission). Plans \nfor the complementary restructuring of the federal and provincial framework and the relations between these two \nlevels of government are being formulated and implemented. \n4  The proposals entail: (a) Article 140-A is to be inserted requiring the provinces to legislate the establishment of a \nlocal government system and devolve political administrative and financial responsibility and authority to the elected \nrepresentatives of local governments; and (b) under Schedule 6, LGOs promulgated by the provincial governments \nin 2001 cannot be repealed without prior sanction by the President.  \n ", "    Appendix 1  35\n9.  The LGOs of 2001 have brought about the introduction of the concept of fiscal transfers \nto the local governments, and changes in local government taxation. Powers to levy taxes on \nimmovable property (including property transfers) and cattle mandies have been conferred on \nthe  appropriate  tehsil/town  level,  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  rates  by  the  provincial \ngovernments and or rules and instructions issued by the provincial governments. The fee for the \nlicensing of professions and vocations has been devolved to the union level and the zila/district \ncouncils  have  been  given  two  new  sources  of  revenue-health  tax  and  education  tax.  The \nmanagement of the assets/service facilities of the provincial governments has also been handed \nover to local governments, enabling them to collect user charges on these facilities. However, \nthe  liabilities  associated  with  these  assets  have  not  been  transferred.  The  provincial \ngovernments will continue to be responsible for the servicing of all the loans raised to finance the \nacquisition of these assets. This is in line with the legislation that prohibits local governments \nfrom incurring any debt. \n \nC.  Fiscal Restructuring and Financial Management \n \n10.  Fiscal restructuring, aimed at creating fiscal space for improved development spending, \nforms  the  basis  for  improved  public  resource  management.  Punjab\u2019s  public  finances  have \ncontinued to suffer from structural rigidities that have steadily eroded its fiscal base, contributing \nto inadequate service delivery. The issues that have particularly impacted public finances and \nfinancial  management  include  inflexibility  of  expenditures,  overstaffing,  overextension  of \ngovernmental  mandate,  vertical  revenue-expenditure  imbalances,  inadequate  fiscal \ntransparency  and  weak  monitoring,  poorly  functioning  internal  controls,  weak  accounting \nmechanisms,  and  delays  in  recording  transactions.  The  weak  monitoring  of  budgets,  in \nparticular, has eroded the usefulness of budgets as instruments for implementing and updating \ngovernment policies. Structural issues of fiscal management confronting the Punjab government \nare as follows.  \n \n11.  Volatility  of  Transfers  from  the  Federal  Divisible  Pool.  The  National  Finance \nCommission  (NFC)  award  of  1997  rendered  provinces  more  vulnerable  to  fluctuations  in \nresource transfers. Previous NFC awards had given provincial governments disproportionate \nshares of the more buoyant federal taxes, including customs and excise. The 1997 award, \nhowever, shifted to a system whereby federal taxes are shared amongst provinces equally \nthrough a single divisible pool. Moreover, federal fiscal reforms reduced collection of key taxes \nsuch as customs tariffs and income tax, reducing the size of the divisible pool. At the same time, \nthe monthly transfers to the provinces were linked to actual tax receipts of federal taxes in the \nprevious  month,  rendering  the  provincial  governments  vulnerable  to  seasonal  fluctuations. \nAdded to this uncertainty is the federal Government\u2019s consistent overestimation of revenues, \nwhich renders the planning process ever more complex.  \n \n12.  The volatility of transfers from the federal divisible pool has also rendered provincial \nrevenue and expenditure estimates unrealistic. The high degree of dependence on federal \ntransfers has left the provincial government little leeway in absorbing the cost of shortfalls in \nsuch transfers, since the potential for mobilization of revenues from own taxes and user charges \nhas tended to be limited, at least in the short term. This has resulted in unplanned cuts in \nexpenditures, resulting in the deferral of expenditures, especially those required to maintain \ninfrastructure. Consequently, there has been a buildup of liabilities, with underfunding by the \nprovincial government for meeting such obligations even when it was holding monies in a \nfiduciary capacity. All these developments have contributed to fiscal stress.  \n \n   ", "36 Appendix 1 \n \n13.  Given that the bulk of the expenditure commitments of the provincial governments are for \nfixed establishment-related costs such as salaries and pensions, the seasonal fluctuations in \nresource transfers have had implications for expenditure management. Punjab government has \nthus had to take overdrafts from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). The overall budgetary deficits \nof the Punjab government could therefore only be financed by building up arrears and by the off-\nbudget funds held in a fiduciary capacity and reflected in the movement on the Public Fund \nAccount. The outcome is the uncovered gap between the amount set by the Punjab government \nto discharge its obligations in respect of the General Provident (GP) Fund and the actual liability \non this account.  \n \n14.  The  seasonal  fluctuations  of  transfers  have  also  had  an  impact  on  procurement  of \nnonsalary components of recurrent expenditures, particularly medicines and school supplies, the \nprocurement of which should be initiated at the start of the fiscal year to ensure regular year-\nround supplies.  \n \n15.  The government of Punjab has responded to the unpredictability of its resource position \nby imposing controls on expenditures through institution of somewhat complicated processes for \napproval  of  expenditures.  Released  funds  cannot  be  utilized  by  departments  without  the \napproval of the finance secretary through a signed audit copy. This system  has obviously \nresulted in further delays in fund utilization, and has further slowed down implementation of \ndevelopment projects, and the pace of nonsalary recurrent expenditure, thus leading to further \ndeterioration in service delivery.  \n \n16.  Resource Mobilization. The Punjab government currently collects only about 17% of the \ntotal receipts it utilizes, with the remainder taking the form of federal transfers and grants. Of the \ntaxes collected by the Punjab government, land revenue contributed 16% of total provincial tax \nrevenue in FY2003. Overall, stamp duties contributed the highest share of provincial taxes, \n32.2% of total provincial tax collection, and 60% of indirect taxes.5 The other important taxes \nwere motor vehicle tax, contributing 15.4% of total tax revenues, and agricultural income tax, \nwhich contributed almost 10%. There is considerable potential for increasing tax revenues by \nrestructuring key taxes. Some of the issues in this regard include the following:  \n \n(i)  Agricultural income tax. The Punjab government has based the agricultural \nincome tax on net area sown, and exempted landowners with less than 12.5 \nacres of land from tax. For landowners with more than 12.5 acres, the entire land \narea is subject to tax at one applicable rate (although the rate differs for irrigated \nand nonirrigated land). In addition, the Punjab government introduced an income \nbased tax for farmers with more than 50 acres of land and an income of more \nthan PRs80,000 per annum. Although income tax rates on agricultural income \nremain low, the imposition of the tax is a step in the right direction. The revenue \nyield from the agricultural income  tax can be further increased, however, by \nlowering  the  exemption  rates.  Efficiency  of  revenue  collection  can  also  be \nenhanced by upgrading the revenue record system and introducing computerized \nland revenue record systems.  \n \n(ii)  Stamp duties. Stamp duties are not rationalized and consolidated. The number \nof stamp duties should be reduced from more than 100 serials currently and the \npresently  less  elastic  and  administratively  inconvenient  structure  should  be \nreplaced with one that is more buoyant, based on ad valorem rates. This can \nconsiderably enhance  receipts from this source. To fully exploit the potential \n                                                 \n5  Indirect taxes constituted 65% of total tax revenues in FY2000. \n ", "    Appendix 1  37\noffered by stamp duties, the Punjab government should negotiate the application \nof  uniform  rates  of  stamp  duties  on  financial  documents.  Through  this \nharmonization, the shifting of tax bases can be checked. Since imposition of \nstamp duties and registration of accompanying property transfer documents are \nclosely linked activities there is a need to strengthen the associated procedures \nand  the  institutional  arrangements  for  improving  compliance  and  collection \nefficiencies, including the incorporation of penalty provisions in the legislation, \nrules, and regulations. \n \n(iii)  Property  tax.  Property  tax  has  been  devolved  to  tehsil  governments,  but \nrevenues from the tax can be considerably enhanced if assessment of property is \ndone on the basis of capital value, which can then be converted into rental value, \nrather than assessing rental value of the property only, a practice that is too \nsubjective. Similarly, the exemptions accorded under the tax need to be reviewed, \nand the discrepancy in tax liability between owner-occupied and rented properties \nneed to be reviewed as it creates a disincentive for development of property.  \n \n(iv)  Professional tax. The existing provincial flat-rate professional tax is structured on \nan  inelastic  base,  which  has  been  punctured  by  anomalies  of  assessee \ncategories and applicable rates. Unsurprisingly, revenues generated from this tax \nare  below  potential.  The  tax  should  be  viewed  as  a  business  licensing  fee \npayable by an enterprise wishing to locate any of its business activities in the \nprovince and should be replaced by an ad valorem tax linked to sales/turnover for \ncollection  through  the  Central  Board  of  Revenue\u2019s  (CBR\u2019s)  Collectorate  for \nGeneral Sales Tax (GST). In the case of commercial establishments like shops, \nretails outlets not currently assessed for GST, the collection, again through the \nCBR\u2019s Collectorate for GST, could be on the basis of turnover accepted in the \nmost  recent  income  tax  assessment  order  of  the  related  enterprise.  For \nenterprises presently exempted from GST, such as banks, schools, and private \nhospitals, the professional tax/businesses licensing fees could be levied on a per \nbranch basis.  \n \n17.  Expenditure Management. Overall, the Punjab government does not have the fiscal \nspace  for  supplementing  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  expenditures  and  undertaking \ncapital investments in high-priority areas. This lack of fiscal space has been instrumental in the \nsharp  reduction  in  real  terms  in  the  creation  and  maintenance  of  key  physical  and  social \ninfrastructure, impairing prospects for growth. There is a huge infrastructure deficit owing to the \nbacklog of rehabilitation-related spending and regular repairs and maintenance expenditures.  \n \n18.  In general, there are significant weaknesses in the auditing and reporting functions of the \nPunjab government that make it extremely difficult to accurately assess costs and expenditures \nin key sectors. The data typically has significant discrepancies between revised estimates, \nestimates from the civil accounts, and estimates from the appropriation accounts. The civil \naccounts, which are records of actual expenditure, are not in fact published by the Punjab \ngovernment, as a result of which it is not possible to assess whether budgetary releases have \nactually been utilized in the field. A comprehensive analysis of expenditures is therefore a \ncumbersome exercise. \n \n19.  To improve the allocations for priority expenditures, the Punjab government needs to \nadopt and implement, as a key reform measure, a medium-term budgetary framework (MTBF), \nbased on well-defined outcome-based sector strategies, covering a 3- to 4-year period, starting \n   ", "38 Appendix 1 \n \nin FY2004. Multiyear budgeting is also a prerequisite for making a proper assessment of the \nrequirement of funds to complete ongoing projects, which are in a sense the nonperforming \nassets of the Punjab government. To achieve this objective, the Punjab government has already \ninitiated some actions to restructure its finances and is considering other measures to achieve \nthe goals associated with the implementation of an MTBF. To improve budgetary practices and \nensure the attainment of goals in the medium to long term, the provincial government has, with \nthe  assistance  of  the  Department  for  International  Development,  United  Kingdom  (DFID), \nalready initiated performance budgeting in, among others, the sectors of education, health, and \nagriculture. \n \nD.  Development Planning and Resource Allocation \n \n20.  The institutionalization of efficient development planning and resource allocation systems \nis key to effective public policy. In Pakistan in general, and Punjab in particular, these systems \nare cumbersome, outdated, and may actually serve to hinder implementation of development \ninitiatives.  \n \n21.  Administrative Budget Preparation Exercise. The government of Punjab\u2019s budgets \nfocus  on  expenditures  in  nominal  terms  and  not  in  terms  of  outputs.  This,  combined  with \ninadequately  maintained  accounts  and  ineffectual  monitoring  have  played  their  part  in \nweakening  the  linkage  between  allocations  and  outcomes,  rendering  budget  preparation  a \nroutine, administrative exercise that is not linked to policy objectives. The traditional lack of \nemphasis on orienting planning and budgeting practices toward the achievement of long-term \ndevelopment  objectives  has  been  exacerbated  by  the  lack  of  public  consultation,  and  the \nabsence of a dialogue between the executive and elected representatives as well as elements of \ncivil society. The problem is exacerbated by the lack of a long-term development strategy or \nvision for the province, which would provide the framework within which all development-related \nactivities would occur. Budget allocations thus continue to be made incrementally, rather than in \nthe  wider  frame  of  medium-term  priorities  and  poverty  goals  and  a  robustly  determined \nestimation of corresponding resource availability. The bulk of budgetary expenditures (about \n75% of the total) are classified as permanent recurrent expenditures, which are rarely reviewed \nto establish consistency with the Punjab government's development priorities or policies.  \n \n22.  Identification  and  Approval  of  Development  Schemes.  The  Planning  and \nDevelopment Department (P&DD), government of Punjab, issues a directive to all departments \nat the end of the second quarter of the fiscal year, asking them to recommend development \nschemes for inclusion in the annual development program (ADP). P&DD also issues a set of \nguidelines according to which the recommendations are to be made, including the proviso that \nschemes be listed in order of priority within sectors and subsectors, project components to be \nfunded  through  foreign  aid  be  listed  separately  in  rupee  terms,  and  ongoing  schemes  at \nadvanced stages of development be adequately funded. The departments are also advised to \nfinalize their programs after thorough in-house discussions and give special attention to projects \nthat are deemed to be significant according to the development priorities of the province as a \nwhole. Each department than sends estimates of development expenditure over the next fiscal \nyear to P&DD in the form of draft demands for funds. \n \n23.  As the third quarter of the fiscal year closes, the draft demands are scrutinized by P&DD. \nPrior to 1998, the bulk of development schemes at the provincial level were funded by the \nfederal Government through cash development loans (CDLs), and the federal Government thus \ndiscussed most draft demands from the provinces in the Priorities Committee, chaired by the \nMinistry of Finance and then in the Annual Plan Coordination Committee (APCC) of the Planning \n ", "    Appendix 1  39\nCommission. For schemes to be funded through CDLs, the recommendations of the APCC and \nthe Priorities Committee were forwarded to the National Economic Council chaired by the Prime \nMinister, which finalized the Public Sector Development Program accordingly. Development \nprojects funded entirely from the provincial resources were deliberated upon at the provincial \nlevel through interdepartmental meetings normally held twice in the fiscal year, normally in the \nthird and fourth quarters of the year.  \n \n24.  The  federal  Government  discontinued  the  facility  of  providing  CDLs  to  provincial \ngovernments  in  1998.  Nevertheless,  the  Planning  Commission  still  accords  approval  to  all \nschemes of over PRs200 million. In addition, the APCC is still convened to approve a Federal \nPublic Sector Development Program (PSDP), a significant proportion of which is implemented in \nthe provinces. In Punjab, all development schemes of over PRs20 million are approved by the \nProvincial Development Working Party (PDWP) chaired by P&DD, although these are now being \nimplemented at the district level, while schemes of less than PRs20 million are approved at the \ndistrict level by district development committees. Similarly, all schemes that have a component \nof foreign funding are approved by the PDWP. Thus in spite of devolution of implementation \nresponsibilities, approval processes have not been entirely devolved. The process as described \nabove has the following flaws.  \n \n25.  Dichotomy Between Approval and Allocation. Once approved, however, development \nschemes are not necessarily funded in the ADP. Also, the ADP does not necessarily include only \napproved schemes, but unapproved ones as well. There is in fact no coherent linkage between \napproval and allocation of funds. While a certain degree of overprogramming is advisable to \nensure that funds are not left unused, the system of according approval to projects without \nensuring availability of funds renders the planning process meaningless. Similarly the inclusion \nof unapproved schemes in the ADP, a practice that the government of Punjab has now decided \nto discontinue, negated the whole planning exercise further. Given that the bulk of the ADP \nresources are taken up by funding of ongoing schemes,6 most of which are subject to cost and \ntime overruns, the effort expended in preparation of new schemes and their approval tends to be \nwasted.  \n \n26.  Dichotomy  Between  Actual  and  Required  Allocation.  The  absence  of  a  linkage \nbetween approval and allocation manifests itself particularly in the discrepancy in actual and \nrequired allocations for projects in the ADP. Annual required allocations as specified in the PC-\n1s of projects are hardly ever accommodated in the ADP, as a result of which schemes are \nrarely completed on time and within the original cost estimates. A cursory analysis of amounts \nallocated to new schemes in the ADP for FY2003 reveals that only 55% of required amounts, as \nspecified in the respective PC-1s, were actually allocated to these schemes.7  \n \n27.  Moreover, the linkages between initial and recurrent costs of new projects have not been \nestablished through well-defined procedures. While the PC-1s give estimates of future recurrent \ncosts,  there  is  no  procedure  for  ensuring  that  these  are  reflected  in  subsequent  recurrent \nexpenditures  funded  by  the  Finance  Department.  There  is  thus  a  disconnect  between \ndevelopment and recurrent budgets, with obvious consequences in the form of mismatches. This \nfundamental disconnect has also led to the existence of \u201cthrow forward\u201d in the ADP, as new \nschemes are added without consideration of the funding requirements of existing ones. The size \n                                                 \n6  Allocations for new schemes constituted only 1% of the total ADP in Punjab in FY2003. \n7  This analysis was based on data provided by P&DD, but all figures could not be verified as the data were \nincomplete. \n   ", "40 Appendix 1 \n \nof  the  throw  forward  was  more  than  twice  the  size  of  the  actual  ADP  in  2000,  but  has \nsubsequently been reduced.8  \n \n28.  The provincial planning process is thus characterized by certain rigidities and structural \ndefects that have led to distortions in the project portfolio. Development budgets or annual \ndevelopment expenditures are considered to be more important than recurrent expenditure, \nprimarily for political reasons, as a result of which the service infrastructure created by the \ngovernment of Punjab has expanded, while resources available for nonwage O&M have shrunk. \nThe  artificial  distinction  between  development  and  nondevelopment  expenditure  has  had \nprofound  implications  for  the  maintenance  of  infrastructure,  and  the  \u201coverextension\u201d  of  the \ngovernment of Punjab has led to an overall deterioration in the quality of existing infrastructure \nfacilities, as well as subsequent deterioration in service delivery.  \n \n29.  Incremental Demands. The problem of incremental budgeting tends to occur in the case \nof development budgets also. P&DD\u2019s instructions to departments specify that the increase in \ndraft demands have to be contained to a certain percentage increase over last year\u2019s allocations \n(the directive for FY2004 specifies this as 20%). There is a tendency for departments to prepare \ndraft demands according to this \u201cformula\u201d, i.e., adding to last year\u2019s allocations to the extent of \nthe ceiling specified without consideration of whether this level of expenditure is what is really \nrequired or whether it can be accommodated. This strategy has paybacks for the departments, \nhowever, in that it is a way of securing access to limited resources given that P&DD tries to \naccommodate the maximum number of schemes in the ADP in any given year, even if this \nmeans allocating resources far below required amounts for each scheme. The departments thus \nuse their draft demands to stake a claim on future resource allocations, without consideration of \nthe status of ongoing programs, which remain underfunded and incomplete. \n                                                 \n8  The throw forward is the excess of the cost of a development scheme over the current financial year\u2019s allocation, \nand is one of the measures to analyze the sustainability of the development budget. \n ", "    Appendix 2  41\n \n2.BACKGROUND STUDIES AND CHRONOLOGY \n \n1.  The Program content is based on intensive consultation and insights gained by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) through ongoing dialogue with public sector stakeholders and civic \nsociety. Background studies were carried out by ADB, including: (i) Punjab: Fiscal and Financial \nManagement and (ii) Reforms of Systems and Institutions in Punjab.  \n \n2.  In addition, numerous reports and dialogue on a variety of governance and resource \nmanagement aspects were generated by ADB under various technical assistances (TAs), as \nwell as by other funding agencies (see the External Assistance Overview in Appendix 3). \n \n3.

Revenue Estimates (Divisible Pool and Straight Transfers).  These estimates have \nbeen increased by approximately the same rate as projected by the World Bank and the IMF \nwith the federal Government. These rates have been obtained from the Punjab Government \nRevenue Projection provided by the World Bank in its estimates. The significant increase in \nthese transfers 2004-2005 is due to the assumption that the 6th NFC Award will be concluded \nand provinces will be getting a higher share of the Divisible Pool i.e., 40% instead of 37.5%. The \nnext two years revenue growth is projected at 11% which has been slightly revised downwards \nas compared to the WB estimates of 12%. \n \n2.  Provincial Revenues. Provincial revenues are expected to grow at 12% annually. The \ndip which we see in the year 2004-2005 in case of nontax revenue is because of the maturity of \ninvestments of around PRs4 billion which is a one time accrual in 2003-2004. \n \n3.  Federal Grants. These are expected to grow at 6%.  \n \n4.  Current Expenditures. Current expenditures are as follows: \n(i)  Wages. The figure for wages given in the table is for the provincial level posts \nonly. The expenditure for posts devolved to the district government are covered in \nthe  line  item  \u201cGrants  to  Local  Governments\u201d  in  the  table.  The  15%  wages \nincreased in 2003-2004 has been estimated PRs4.5 billion. 30% of PRs4.5 billion \nis included in Wages and the remaining 70% has been included in Grants to \nLocal Governments because roughly 70% of the government posts are now \ndevolved to the local governments. Increase of 5% per annum is shown in the \nprojections. \n(ii)  Pensions. An additional PRs1 billion has been included in the pension estimates \nof 2003-2004 due to 15% increase in pensions by the federal Government. \nPension projections are to increase at 10% per annum during the period. \n \n5.  Nonsalary  Expenditures.  15%  per  annum  increase  is  expected  in  nonsalary \nexpenditures (provincial side). Most of these expenditures will be devoted to meeting the deficits \nin key areas like health, education, access to justice and clearance of outstanding liabilities to \nmake government machinery functional.  \n6.  In the old estimates PRs8.8 billion which was straight transfer in lieu of OZT to local \ngovernments was included in nonsalary expenditures. This has now been included in the line \nitem \u201cGrants to Local Governments\u201d. This explains the difference between the old and new \nestimates of nonsalary expenditure. \n \n7.

This is a major current expenditure item and is expected \nto increase at 11% per annum over the period. This will comprise wage increase of 5% per \nannum with the balance going to finance nonsalary expenditures.  \n \n11.  Development Expenditures. Development expenditures are expected to grow at 9% in \nthe first year and at 13.7% in the following years of the programme. These expenditures will be \ndistributed in the same ratio as given in the budget estimates for 2003-2004 between provincial \nand local governments. \n \n12.  Calculation of Fiscal Balance. This is total revenues minus total expenditures. \n \n13.  Financing  of  Fiscal  Balance.  This  is  done  through  our  regular  foreign  project \nassistance which is expected to grow at 6% per annum and net surplus from our Public \nAccounts which is a constant PRs100 million. However, the Public Accounts figure excludes \npayments and receipts on General Provident fund which have been separately added to the \nTable and included in the calculations. Historically there has been a growth of 12% in receipts \nand 22% in payments. Consequently our budget estimates for 2003-2004 has been changed in \nthe table to bring it in line with the trend shown in the revised estimates of the previous year. The \npayments are projected to grow at 22% and the receipts at 12% over the period thus giving us a \nnet negative balance on this account.  \n14.   In  addition,  maturity  of  investment  and  privatization  proceeds  will  finance  the  fiscal \nbalance. Privatization proceeds of PRs4 billion are estimated in 2003-2004. \n \n15.  Additional Proposed Expenditures. Accelerated debt repayment is estimated at PRs15 \nbillion every year. Capitalization of pension/GP fund is estimated at PRs1 billion and PRs2 billion \nin 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 respectively. \n \n16.  Total Financing Gap. This is net of Fiscal Balance + Available Financing + Additional \nExpenditures. This gap is covered by the adjustment financing available from the WB and ADB \nof around PRs11.6 billion during the next four years ($100 million each from ADB and WB).  \n \n ", "    Appendix 7  69\nESTIMATE OF PROGRAM ADJUSTMENT COST  \n \n1.

", "    Appendix 9  71\n1.TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR \n9.SUPPORTING PUBLIC RESOURCE MANAGEMENT REFORMS IN PUNJAB  \n \nA.  Background and Rationale  \n \n1.   The federal Government has demonstrated strong commitment to poverty reduction \nthrough a number of policy statements. A major challenge for the provinces emerged with the \nLocal Governance Ordinance, 2001, which aims for a changed set of powers and functions to \nlead to higher efficiency and better public service delivery by enhancing accountability, equity, \nand public engagement in government affairs. The government of Punjab launched the Punjab \nResource  Management  Program  (PRMP)  as  a  comprehensive  reform  effort  to  restructure \nprovincial finances, institutional arrangements, and incentive mechanisms for public service \ndelivery  and  private  sector  development.  Implementation  of  the  reform  agenda  poses  a \nconsiderable challenges that requires considerable technical assistance for both strengthening \nthe capability to further detail and fine-tune the reforms, as well as capacity-building measures in \nkey provincial agencies. \n \nB.   Objectives and Scope  \n \n2.   The objectives of the technical assistance (TA) are to (i) support assessments and \nanalytical studies in key policy and reform areas addressed under the PRMP; (ii) develop \nstrategies to improve fiscal sustainability and public service delivery; and (iii) build capacity to \ncarry out institutional reforms in key public sector departments including the Planning and \nDevelopment  Department  (P&DD),  Finance  Department  (FD),  Service  and  General \nAdministration  Department  (S&GAD),  and  Industry,  Commerce  and  Investment  Department \n(ICID).  \n \n3.  The TA will comprise eight components, for (i) revenue and tax administration reform; \n(ii) public  expenditure  and  financial  management  (including  medium-term  budgeting, \nintergovernmental financing, procurement, and financial management); (iii) contingent liability \nmanagement and pension reform; (iv) strategic planning systems and change management; \n(v) human resources management; (vi) land registration reform; (vii) public sector organization \n(PSO) reform (including preparation for privatization, liquidation and corporate restructuring); \nand (viii) implementation support (including monitoring and evaluation). \n \n4.  Revenue and Tax Administration Reform. This part of the TA is intended to enable the \ngovernment of Punjab to design and implement administrative reforms in tax administration, with \na view to increase the revenue of the government through broadening the tax base and more \neffective collection systems. In particular, this will examine the feasibility and options making \nrevenue collecting  agencies more efficient, and consider the possibility of amalgamation of \ndifferent  major  revenue  collecting  agencies  where  found  beneficial  and  feasible,  through \nstructural reforms including change in functions, objectives, mission statements, and rules of \nbusiness, etc. It will also include recommendations with regard to organizational setup, staffing \nand incentives, as well as computerization and recording systems. In addition, this component \nwill initiate capacity building measures for assessment and collection of property tax at local \nlevel, and assist in further restructuring of provincial taxes and duties, reforming fees and user \ncharges structure.  \n \n5.  Public Expenditure and Financial Management. This component comprises six  key \nresult areas: (i) public expenditure assessment and recommendations has the objective to find \nways to enhance the usefulness of funds spent on public purposes, to identify items or areas of \n   ", "72 Appendix 9 \n \nexpenditure  where  sustained  enhanced  spending  is  necessary  to  gain  maximum  pro-poor \nimpact  and  to  identify  and  remove  the  structural  rigidities  in  the  public  expenditure; \n(ii) information content of budget documents supports activities which will make the budgeting \nprocess more transparent to reduce chances of arbitrary allocations or reappropriations, which \ndistort budget policy direction; (iii) formula-based fiscal transfers to local governments assists \nstudies and assessments on the current state of intergovernmental finances and helps define \ndifferent models for resource distribution; (iv) procurement supports activities, which will lead to \ntransparent and efficient procurement of goods and services; (v) timely, reliable, and publicly \naccessible  accounts  assists  activities  to  make  such  accounts  possible  by  simultaneously \nassessing and enhancing accounting on the local government level; and (vi) updating relevant \nlaws and rules offers assistance to upgrade fiscal and financial management laws and rules to \nmake the reform process possible. TA will also assess requirements to design and implement \ninformation technology-based support systems in this area. \n \n6.  Pension Reform and Contingent Liabilities. The TA will support the assessment of the \nfinancial status and sustainability of Punjab\u2019s current civil service and its overall impact on the \nprovincial budget. Based on these findings, a strategy will be developed to finance sustainable \npension obligations, taking into account the ongoing analysis and trends toward pension reform \nat the federal level. \n \n7.  Strategic Planning Systems and Change Management. This component comprises \ntwo key result areas. Under the first key result area, the TA will assist the government of Punjab \nin improving its strategic programming of investments for poverty reduction. Therefore, the \nexisting instruments will be assessed and enhanced to establish a coordinated mechanism for \nstrategic planning. The second key result area will focus on restructuring of provincial agencies \nresponsible for policy planning, fiscal, and financial management with a view to enhance their \ncapacity to effectively perform the roles assigned to them. \n \n8.  Human Resources Management. This TA component aims at improving public sector \nhuman resources management through development of operational plans focusing on training, \nskills  development,  strengthening  internal  accountability,  and  institutionalized  system  of \nrecruitment, promotions, and transfers. The TA will also assess requirements to design and \nimplement an information technology-based human resources information system. \n \n9.  Land  Registration  Reform.  The  TA  provides  assistance  and  capacity  building  to \nestablish a land and property registry. This is linked to the findings under component 1 with \nregard to the future direction of the Board of Revenue. Further, necessary amendments in the \nrelevant laws will be recommended as well as improvements of the technical basis and of the \nrecords to enhance revenue collection on land and property. \n \n10.   Public Sector Organization Reform (including preparation for privatization, liquidation, \nand corporate restructuring). This component will assess the financial and operational viability of \nagreed public sector organizations and recommend strategies for their future direction which \ncould including privatization, liquidation, or institutional development. The TA will recommend \nappropriate measures and detailed action plans with activities and timelines to implement the \nrecommendations. \n \n11.  Implementation,  Monitoring,  and  Evaluation.  The  TA  will  assist  the  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) to establish a performance monitoring and evaluation (PM&E) system \nfor the PRMP. The PM&E will be established to (i) ensure and demonstrate efficient and \naccountable  use  of  public  resources,  (ii) support  effective  management  of  institutional \n ", "    Appendix 9  73\narrangements due to PRMP, and (iii) progressively evaluate the impact of reforms as to provide \ntested lessons from experience on which to modify the policies, regulations, and institutional \narrangements of the reforms. The TA will also assist P&DD to further refine its feedback and \nmonitoring systems, including required systems support. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $5,550,000 equivalent, comprising $835,000 in \nforeign  exchange  costs  and  $4,715,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will finance $4,000,000 equivalent, comprising the entire foreign \nexchange cost and $3,165,000 equivalent in local currency (Table A9).  \nTable A9: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($\u2019000) \nItem  Foreign  Local  Total  \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest \nrate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other \n   ", "74 Appendix 9 \n \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft TA Loan \nand Project Agreements.  \n \n14.  ADB will finance 72.1% of the total cost of the TA, including international and domestic \nconsultant services, a part of the cost of computer hardware and systems development, training \nprograms and activities, as well as interest charges during implementation. The Government will \nfinance  27.9%  of  the  total  cost,  mainly  for  the  counterpart  budget  of  the executing and \nimplementing agencies, including counterpart staff and facilities for the consulting team, taxes \nand duties on equipment, and taxes on consultants, as well as part of the computer equipment.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n  1.   The Executing Agency \n \n15.  The executing Agency (EA) for the TA will be P&DD. The TA will be implemented with \nsupport by other line departments as appropriate, in particular FD, which will be implementing \nagencies (IAs). P&DD, through the PRMP PMU, will be responsible for coordination with the IAs \nand timely implementation of the TA.  \n \n16.  P&DD will establish and maintain separate accounts for the TA in accordance with \naccounting procedures acceptable to ADB.  An imprest account will be established after loan \neffectiveness  and  managed,  replenished  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB's  \"Loan \nDisbursement Handbook\". The initial amount to be deposited into the imprest account will not \nexceed the lesser of the equivalent of $400,000 or six months\u2019 estimated expenditures.  The \naccounts, together with record of expenditures under the TA loan and use of the imprest \naccount, will be audited annually by independent auditors in accordance with auditing standards \nacceptable to ADB. Certified copies of the audited accounts and financial statements and the \nreport of the auditors will be submitted to ADB in English within 9 months of the end of each \nfiscal year.  \n \n  2.  Schedule, Reports, and Reviews \n \n17.  The TA is planned to commence as soon as practical following the effective date of the \nTA loan, to be completed over a period of about 18 months after inception and before 31 \nDecember 2005.  \n \n18.  Each component of the TA will be implemented in three phases. During the inception \nphase, the lead consultants of the various components will revalidate the policy objectives and \nassess priorities, key issues, and capacity-building needs on the governance, regulatory, and \noperational level. At the end of this phase, resource inputs may be adjusted as appropriate \nwithin the overall budgetary framework and TA scope, to better align the terms of reference, \nactivities, and time-bound outputs with client expectations and needs. This will also include the \nrefinement  of  performance  parameters  for  the  consultants.  During  the  design  phase,  the \nconsultants will formulate and detail the capacity-building and operational development plans. \nDuring  the  implementation  phase,  the  consultants  will  document  required  regulations, \nprocedures, and systems, as well as arrange for training and skill development activities as \nappropriate. \n  \n19.  The team of consultants will prepare an inception report on the respective components \nwithin 4 weeks of the commencement of their services, which will fine-tune and detail the work \nprogram and establish time-bound outputs. In addition to any full report required at the end of \n ", "    Appendix 9  75\neach individual component, the consultants and the IAs will submit quarterly progress reports. \nThe final report, including complete documentation of all outputs, will be submitted within 3 \nmonths of the end of the assignment, after the comments of ADB and the Government have \nbeen incorporated.  \n \n20.  In addition to regular and ongoing interaction among the IAs, ADB, and its consultants, a \ncomprehensive midterm review will be undertaken jointly by ADB, the IAs, P&DD, and the \nconsultants about 9 months after project inception to review all aspects of implementation. \n \n  3.   Procurement \n \n21.   The  computer  hardware  and  software  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. Each supply contract for equipment or materials estimated to cost \nthe equivalent of more than $500,000 will be awarded on the basis of international competitive \nbidding. Each supply contract for equipment or materials estimated to cost the equivalent of \n$500,000 or less (other than minor items) will be awarded on the basis of international shopping, \nand supply contracts valued at $50,000 or less may be procured following direct purchase \nprocedures. \n \n  4.  Consulting Services \n \n22.  The TA will require about 478 person-months of consulting services, including 18 person-\nmonths  of  international  and  460  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services.  Separate \nsubcontracting  of  services  of  individual  consultants  or  firms  may  be  required  for  selected \naspects. Consulting services will be provided through quality and cost-based selection by one or \nmore consulting firms or individual consultants recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of \ndomestic consultants. It is expected that there will be about eight separate contract packages for \nthe various TA components. Supplementary Appendix C outlines details for various components \nand consulting packages. In case of selection of consulting firms, simplified technical proposals \nwill be used. The TA loan will emphasize the mobilization of expertise available within Pakistan. \nCapacity building to be supported under the TA loan will focus on training and skill development \nservices that can be delivered by Pakistani private and/or public sector institutions and, in \nparticular, activities that can be integrated within the normal functioning of the concerned client \nagencies.  \n \n \n   ", "76 Appendix 10 \n10.SUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \nAND POVERTY IMPACT ASSESSMENT \n \nA.   Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n \n1.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \n1.  Based on an in-depth examination of the quantitative and qualitative analyses of poverty \nin Punjab and an extensive consultative process that has included civil society at the grassroots \nlevel, the government of Punjab has finalized its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PPRSP). \nThe PPRSP identifies governance reform, strengthening of planning capability, improvement of \nservice delivery and fiscal and financial reform, and creation of an investor-friendly environment \nas key issues for effective poverty reduction in Punjab, in addition to mainstreaming of gender \nand environment issues and income and employment generation. Each of these key areas of \nintervention  have  been  covered  in  the  proposed  Punjab  Resource  Management  Program \n(PRMP). The PRMP thus strongly complements the PPRSP and will provide support for the \nimplementation of PPRSP recommendations. \n \n2.  Earlier,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Poverty  Assessment  for  Pakistan  had \nidentified governance as the key cause of poverty in Pakistan, which not only resulted in poor \npublic service delivery and enhanced vulnerability, but is the prime cause of low business \nconfidence, which in turn translates into lower investment levels and growth. The Poverty \nAssessment was the main input for the Country Strategy and Program (CSP) (2002\u20132006), \nwhich  delineates  ADB\u2019s  medium-term  development  strategy  for  Pakistan,  which  has  been \nframed  in  the  context  of  the  national  PRSP  and  the  ongoing  efforts  to  create  a  feasible \nmonitoring  framework  linked  to  the  budget  and  the  International  Monetary  Fund's  Poverty \nReduction and Growth Facility (PRGF).  \n \n2.  Poverty Analysis: Poverty and Public Resource Management in Punjab \n \n3.  Insufficient  provision  and  poor  quality  of  public  services  have  contributed  to  the \nworsening poverty in the province. Inadequate public services in health and education combined \nwith inadequate maintenance of roads, irrigation systems, water supply schemes, and other \ninfrastructure have contributed directly to low economic growth, poor social indicators, and the \nconsequent inability to reduce poverty. Poor service delivery is tied to declining public sector \nexpenditures in the vicious circle of provincial finances and to poor incentives for service \ndelivery. \n \n4.  Low revenues and high debt service and establishment costs cause the fiscal squeeze. \nAlmost 80% of the provincial current expenditures are committed to pensions, interest payments, \nsubsidies, and the wage bill, as well as grants to local governments. The annual development \nprogram  has  been  overloaded  with  ongoing  projects  that  entail  large  \u201cthrow  forward\u201d  of \nexpenditure liabilities. The input focus of the budget process and the inability to prioritize or \nreview the bulk of the expenditure items under the incremental budgeting process, combined \nwith the tendency to enforce damaging short-term expenditure controls to address the fiscal \nsqueeze, have seriously reduced the effectiveness of public expenditures in Punjab. Reforms in \nunderlying systems and processes to manage public resources are therefore crucial to reverse \nthe increased incidence of poverty in Punjab. \n \n \n \n ", "    Appendix 10  77\n \n \n3.  Participation Process \n \n  a.  Stakeholder Analysis  \n \n5.  Results from stakeholder consultations at all three levels of government and civil society \nhave been distilled into the design of the PRMP. Lessons learned through the consultative \nprocess  for  the  Decentralization  Support  Program  (DSP)  preparation  have  also  been \nincorporated into the PRMP design.  \n \n6.  The Reconnaissance Mission in early 2002 as well as the Consultation and Fact-Finding \nmissions for the PRMP in January\u2013May 2003 held meetings with a number of federal and \nprovincial  officials,  and  informal,  though  focused,  consultations  occurred  with  selected \nnongovernment organization (NGO) representatives and labor organizations during this process. \nA wider consultation, including field visits, with local government elected representatives from \ndistrict, tehsil, and union councils, as well as other development partners, took place during the \nAppraisal Mission in September 2003, which also coincided with the Punjab Development Forum \nheld on 16\u201317 September 2003. \n \n  b.  Participation Strategy \n \n7.  Participation is central to the Government\u2019s current efforts at poverty reduction, and the \nPPRSP  has  been  formulated  on  the  basis  of  wide-ranging  consultations  with  major \nstakeholders, as documented in the PRSP. The Government\u2019s commitment to participation is \nreflected  in  the  ongoing  reform  effort,  which  is  being  undertaken  with  an  emphasis  on \nconsultation, most notably through forums such as the recently convened Punjab Development \nForum. The participation strategy defined for the PRMP is designed to specifically support the \noperationalization of citizen\u2014state participatory arrangements through (i) ensuring that both the \nsystems and procedures provide for public sector accessibility, accountability and transparency, \nand (ii) devoting considerable resources to developing the capacities of provincial government \nofficials, elected representatives, and local government administrators to enact their functions \nand responsibilities consistent with the participatory spirit of the reform effort. \n \n8.  In line with the results of key evaluations of policy-based lending, the PRMP will rely on \nthe regular convention of policy forums such as the Punjab Development Forum or similar, which \nare  participatory  processes  engaging  stakeholders  at  federal,  provincial,  and  local  levels, \nincluding  both  political  and  administrative  organs  of  government  and  NGO  representatives. \nFurther, program implementation will be overseen by a high-level steering committee, which will \ninclude  representatives  of  civil  society  and  the  private  sector  to  ensure  dissemination  of \ninformation on program activities. \n \n4.  Social Issues \n \n9.  The PPRSP requires the setting up of a system of monitoring and evaluation of social \nand economic conditions. Key indicators are explicitly specified and the baselines and targets \nclearly identified. The responsibility for the collection of each indicator is also clearly defined. \nThe ADB TAs on Local Government Performance Enhancement,1 and Gender and Governance \nMainstreaming also entail establishment of baselines and targets with respect to gender, access, \nequity, and sustainability. In addition, the TA on Enhancing Capacity for Poverty Reduction and \n                                                 \n1 Technical assistance loan approved under ADB. 2002.

Manila.  \n   ", "78 Appendix 10 \n \nResource  Management  in  Punjab2 also provides for the engagement of a monitoring  and \nevaluation specialist who will work with the Punjab government to develop key performance \nindicators to monitor progress against social sector targets under the PRMP.  \n \n  a.  Gender \n \n10.  Recent data from the Pakistan Integrated Household Survey 2000-01 confirm the wide \ngender disparities in Punjab in access to basic social services and employment opportunities. \nLarge disparities also exist across urban and rural sectors and income (using expenditure as a \nproxy for income) levels. These disparities are higher in rural areas. Reported labor force \nparticipation by females is generally very low. \n \n11.  A preliminary gender review of public sector expenditure and its management at the \nfederal, provincial, and district levels suggests a critical need for the establishment of cross-\nsector  and  comprehensive  gender  analysis,  planning,  budgeting,  auditing,  and  monitoring \nsystems, and a methodology and mechanisms to ensure gender balanced resource distribution \nat the three levels. The PRMP will provide a means toward this end. The fulfillment of the \ncommitments on mainstreaming gender is one of the key proposed outcomes of the PRMP. The \napproval and implementation of the Provincial Gender Reform Action Plan (GRAP) is part of the \npolicy matrix for the PRMP. \n \n  b.  Access \n \n12.  The PRMP will create an enabling environment for positive impact on access in two \nways: (i) improved public access to services, and (ii) access to timely reliable and publicly \navailable information on resource management issues. The first will directly improve the welfare \nof the poor while the second will enhance the pro-poor focus of public expenditures. There will \nbe  positive  direct  impacts  from  access  to  enhanced  pro-poor  service  delivery.  Improved \ngovernance will result in lower transaction costs as rent-seeking behavior and graft, etc., are \neliminated. Improved governance and increased efficiency will result in lower transaction costs \nfor the poor and nonpoor alike thus improving access for all. These impacts will occur in the \nmedium to long run. \n \n13.  The PRMP aims to improve effectiveness, predictability, and accountability in financial \nmanagement through ensuring transparency in (i) the budgeting process, (ii) intergovernmental \nfinancing, and (iii) procurement of goods and services. Ensuring access to this information will \nprovide an effective vehicle for public oversight and monitoring and will help keep expenditures \nfocused in a pro-poor direction. Improvements in the monitoring, feedback, and evaluation \nsystems will enable decisions to be based on analysis of widely legible and available information \nabout prevailing conditions rather than wholly privileged by personal or political expediency. \nBoth aspects of access\u2014to the services and to the information connected to public resource \nmanagement\u2014are central to the PRMP and feature in the policy matrix.  \n \nc.  Equity \n \n14.  The PRMP will ensure greater equity by supporting the phasing out of subsidies that do \nnot explicitly target the poor; by ensuring improved public accountability of increased spending \nfor pro-poor public service delivery; and by making transparent and efficient the process of \n                                                 \n2 ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n ", "    Appendix 10  79\n \npublic resource management. Equity will also be ensured by making the human resources \nmanagement connected to public sector resources more merit based. \n \n15.  The  horizontal  imbalances  across  local  government  units  with  different  resource \nendowments are a significant feature of poverty in Pakistan. The PRMP will help build and \nrationalize human resources capacity for policy planning fiscal and financial management to \nensure greater equity across local governments. \n \nd.  Sustainability \n \n16.  Effective resource management forms the basis for the poverty reduction strategy of \nPunjab  and  is  actively  supported  by  ADB.  The  PRMP  will  effect  significant  reforms  in \ndevelopment planning and resource management systems in Punjab, which are essential for \neffective  governance.  The  Government  has  already  taken  significant  steps  in  this  regard, \ninitiating such important reforms as the preparation of an MTBF, reforms in the planning and \napproval process for development projects and the approval of a new industrial policy that \naddresses many of the concerns of the private sector. The PRMP will be building on, and \nsupporting  the  Government  in  implementation  of  what  is  essentially  a  homegrown  reform \nagenda. Long-term sustainability is not expected to be an issue. \n \ne.   Laborers, and Rural and Urban Poor  \n \n17.  The Program is expected to have significant long-term welfare enhancing impacts on the \npoor, both rural and urban, as well as on laborers, as detailed in the following poverty impact \nassessment matrix. \n \n   ", "80 Appendix 10 \n \nTable A10.1: Summary Poverty Reduction And Social Strategy \n \nA.

Effective  public  resource  management  will  increase  revenues,  improve \nallocation efficiency of public expenditures toward high socioeconomic returns, enhance sustainability of and access \nby the poor to public services, including for basic social services and infrastructure, and promote private sector \ndevelopment and employment generation. Governance reforms, including public resource management, are a central \nelement in the CPA. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  Proposed Classification:   Poverty Intervention \nAnalysis: \nThe PRMP is a central element of the PPRSP to reduce the incidence of poverty in Punjab from 33% in to 28% in \n2006. The PRMP is supporting the three components of ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy: pro-poor sustainable \neconomic growth, good governance, and social development. Pro-poor sustainable economic growth is to be \nachieved through measures that increase the enabling environment for private sector development. This, in turn, will \npromote employment opportunities for Pakistan\u2019s rapidly growing population and raise real wages of the working \npoor. To support governance, the Program will increase transparency and accountability in utilization of funds, and \ndevelop institutional arrangements and processes that allow for greater participation of civil society in investment \nprogramming. Improved fiscal management will provide space for financing high-priority expenditures targeted at the \npoor.  Support  to  social  development  will  come  about  through  enhanced  public sector  allocations  for  health, \neducation, or water supply and sanitation, as well measures that allow greater competition and participation by the \nprivate sector in service provision to improve service quality. Adjustments at the provincial level are particularly \nimportant to bring about as most of social development services that impact on the livelihood off the poor are \ndelivered at provincial and district level.  \n \nC.

The reforms to be carried out under component 1 of the program include \nstrengthening provincial revenues through broad-basing and rationalization of provincial taxes, raising user charges \nand nontax revenues, and improvements in tax/revenue administration; and rationalizing provincial expenditures \nthrough restructuring debt, controlling contingent liabilities, and publicly accessible accounts. It is assumed that these \nmeasures would be implemented in their entirety and would be successful in improving revenues, rationalizing \nexpenditures, and improving effectiveness, which would have salutary effects on growth and pro-poor expenditures. \nThe improved fiscal space would also generate resources for pro-poor public expenditures.  \n \nThe second component of the program proposes to adjust institutional arrangements for enhancing the pro-poor \nimpact of public expenditure and sustainability of service delivery consistent with principles of devolution and \nintergovernmental reforms. The poverty impact of this component would further increase with measures for increased \nrevenue generation and expenditure rationalization in component 1 above. \n \nThe reforms under the third component of the program will attempt to create a more conducive environment for \nprivate sector development, with a shift of government role away from direction, control, and direct involvement in \noperations toward promotion and facilitation. \nGST = general sales tax, PSO = public sector organization, SME = small and medium enterprise. \n \n \n ", "    Appendix 11  83\n1INTEGRATION OF GENDER REFORMS IN \nPUNJAB RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  The Context \n \n1.  Gender inequality in access to services and justice is evident from gender indicators of \nPakistan. This is true for Punjab as well. Violation of women\u2019s rights and violence against \nwomen remains an everyday experience of women across the class, region, and rural-urban \ndivides. Women bear a disproportionately high share of the burden of poverty within the family \nand  society.  Moreover,  the  poorer  the  family,  the  higher  is  the  likelihood  of  significant \ndependence  on  female  labor.  The  patriarchal  bias  in  state  institutions  translates  into \nunderinvestment in their social and economic entitlements and reinforces the higher incidence of \npoverty  and  powerlessness  among  women.  Representation  of  women  in  political  and \nadministrative setups of government has been a successful strategy to promote the gender \nequality agenda in many countries. In Pakistan, there are substantial gender disparities in public \nsector employment including the civil service. Women are concentrated in the lower spectra of \nthe job hierarchy. Political representation of women is ensured through reserved seats but their \nability to negotiate and promote the gender equality agenda are limited by patriarchal structures. \n \nB.  Key Gender Issues in the Public Sector \n \n2.  Implementation of National Commitments on Gender. In addition to international \ncommitments and obligations, the Government has made a number of policy commitments on \ngender  equality  under  National  Plan  of  Action  (NPA)  in  1998  and  National  Policy  on \nDevelopment and Empowerment of Women in 2002, by allocating a 33% reserved quota for \nwomen in local government and 17% representation for women in national and provincial \nassemblies. However, these commitments have not been matched by political, administrative, \nand financial support.  \n \n3.  Public  Expenditure  on  Promoting  Gender  Equality.  There  has  been  an  overall \ndecrease in the capital budget of Punjab from 16.3% in 1991/92 to 7.9% in 2001/02. As a result, \ninvestment in targeted gender and development programs remains low. In addition to social \nsector departments, mainly health and education, the Women Development Department (WDD) \nis responsive to gender inequality issues. However, the allocation for women\u2019s development \n(part of social welfare, as a sector) remained below 1% of the total expenditure. Within the \ndepartment's own domain, the allocations to recurrent budget have consumed most of the \nresources. The current expenditure of the WDD in the last 10 years has hovered between \nPRs230  million  and  PRs300  million;  however,  the  devolution  of  functions  to  the  district \ngovernments  have  resulted  in  a  drop  of  around  50%  in  this  respect.  The  allocations  for \ndevelopment budgets have been extremely low in the last 10 years, averaging a mere PRs3.0 \nmillion. There is a need to develop gender-sensitive budgetary framework for the provincial and \ndistrict governments to increase investment in promoting gender equality.  \n \n4.  Gender Policy Formulation and Matching Institutional Arrangements. The current \nstate  of  policy  formulation  and  program  execution  in  line  departments  of  the  provincial \ngovernment show a clear lack of gender commitments and meaningful effort to address gender \nconcerns in the context of a rights-based approach. The rules of business, job descriptions, and \nstaff capacity of most of the departments are not aligned to promote the gender equality agenda. \nMoreover, the task of ensuring gender mainstreaming across provincial departments is the \nmandate of WDD, which does not have the proper institutional framework, staff, or capacity to \ndeliver on this mandate. The subject of women\u2019s development is dealt with by a deputy director \nwith minimal staff. There is no dedicated setup at the provincial secretariat and district levels.  ", "84 Appendix 11 \n \n \n5.  Representation and Empowerment. Around 22,246 women councillors and 71 women \nparliamentarians have entered into formal politics at the local and provincial government levels. \nHowever, representation of women in cabinet and parliamentary committees is very low. This is \ntrue for local government as well. There is no female minister in the government of Punjab. In \naddition, administrative and political constraints limit the competency of women politicians to \ninfluence the systems and procedures of government from gender perspective (how to serve \ntheir  constituency,  community  mobilization,  agenda  setting,  development  planning  and \nbudgeting, interlocal government relations, etc.). Government and nongovernment organizations \nhave started education and training programs to build their capacity. However, the capacity of \ngovernment to plan and implement these programs is limited.  \n \n6.  Gender  Disparities  in  Public  Sector  Employment.  There  are  substantial  gender \ndisparities in public sector employment including the civil service. Women are concentrated in \nthe lower spectra of the job hierarchy. Only 5% of total public sector employees are women, and \nmost of them are mainly concentrated in education and health sectors. The representation of \nwomen at higher levels of the Punjab government administrative hierarchy is very low. Table \nA11, depicting the gender disparity in secretariat-level gazetted-positions, shows an indication of \nwomen\u2019s access to decision-making positions in the government of Punjab.  \n \nTable A11: Female Share in Punjab Public Sector Employment  \nBasic Pay  Total Posts  Male Employees  Female  Percentage \nScale  Employees  of Females \n22  1  1  0  0.00 \n21  11  11  0  0.00 \n20  86  84  2  2.32 \n19  115  113  2  1.73 \n18  210  204  6  2.85 \n17  390  379  11  2.82 \nSource: Draft Report, An Inquiry into the Status of Women Employment in Public Sector Organizations 2002 (based \non Service and General Administration Department data). \n \nC.  Gender Reforms Required \n \n7.  Engendering the governance processes and structures demands reforms in public policy, \npublic expenditure, and the institutional setup. This will require reforms in both the political and \nadministrative parts of government and at the provincial and district levels. There is also a critical \nneed  for  establishment  of  cross-sector  and  comprehensive  gender  analysis,  planning, \nbudgeting, auditing and monitoring systems, methodology and mechanisms to ensure gender-\nbalanced policy formulation, and resource distribution at the provincial and district levels.  \n \nD.  Ongoing Gender Reform Initiatives \n \n8.  The major reform effort of government of Punjab is articulated under the Gender Reform \nAction Plan (GRAP) to translate national and international commitments into concrete policy, \nadministrative and budgetary actions. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is assisting the \nMinistry of Women Development and Special Education and four provincial WDDs to formulate \nGRAPs  under  the  Gender  Reform  Program.  The  overall  objective  of  this  Program  is  to \nstrengthen the capacity of government to reform policies, institutions, and systems, dealing \ndirectly or indirectly, with the issues of gender and development. \n \n9.  The first draft of GRAPs is under finalization. It is based on analytical studies conducted \nat the national and provincial levels, which has led to the consolidation of proposals for reform \n ", "    Appendix 11  85\nreflected in one national and four provincial GRAPs. Suggestions regarding reforms are included \nin the framework of gender and governance, covering policy, institutional and fiscal aspects \nacross all sectors. After revision and finalization, these proposals will be presented to the \nnational and provincial project steering committees for consideration and thereafter to national \nand provincial cabinets in July 2003 for final approval. \n  \n10.  Implementation of GRAPs will be supported under the ADB-assisted Decentralization \nSupport Program (DSP) of Ministry of Finance, through a dedicated Technical Assistance (TA) \nLoan 1938: Gender and Governance Mainstreaming. Cabinet approval of GRAPs is a policy \ncondition for effectiveness of this loan and implementation of GRAPs is a policy condition for \nrelease of tranche 2 of the DSP policy loan scheduled for mid-2004.  \n \n11.  GRAPs  include  policy  actions  around  four  central  themes:  (i) improving  women\u2019s \nrepresentation and participation in political and administrative structures; (ii) policy shift from \nsocial  welfare  to  social  development  and  women\u2019s  development  to  gender  equality; \n(iii) restructuring of provincial and district government setups from a gender perspective; and \n(iv) engendering planning and budgetary processes to narrow gender gap in public expenditure. \n \nE.  Integration of Gender Reforms in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper \n \n12.  The Punjab Resource Management Program (PRMP) will facilitate the approval and \nimplementation of gender reform agenda articulated under Punjab GRAP. Approval of Punjab \nGRAP  will  be  an  effectiveness  condition  for  subprogram  1  of  PRMP.  Once  approved, \ncommitments made under GRAP will be integrated into various components of PRMP and \nimplemented by relevant departments. The Department of Social Welfare and WDD will be \nmainly responsible for formulation, approval, and implementation of GRAP, with active support \nof the Finance Department and Planning and Development Board.   \n  \n13.  The scope of national and provincial GRAPs include but is not limited to (i) essential \nreforms; (ii) prerequisite reforms, without which a GRAP would not be useful; and (iii) other \nnecessary support to those which are prerequisite reforms: \n \n(i)  cross-departmental  administrative/institutional  reforms  (at  the  provincial  and \ndistrict  levels,  with  focus  on  WDD  covering  mandate,  systems,  procedures, \nstaffing, technical and physical capacity, improving women\u2019s employment and \nworking conditions); \n(ii)  political  reforms  (effective  participation  in  assemblies  and  local  government, \nchanges in electoral processes for the future, political party reforms); \n(iii)  reform  of  governance  processes  (policies,  budgeting  and  intergovernmental \nrelations); \n(iv)  projects and programs (to encompass and/or support the proposed reforms, \nincluding identification of work already being undertaken, capacity building, and \nbudget components in each), for example the ongoing National Program for \nWomen\u2019s Political Participation, and the proposed National Program for Women\u2019s \nEmployment in the Public Sector; \n(v)  implementation  arrangements  (including  change  management,  sources  of \nfunding, responsibilities and timelines);  \n(vi)  support  actions  needed  for  institutionalization  and  implementation  (such  as \ncapacity building and legal changes); and \n(vii)  requisite program and implementation arrangements and capacity-building plans.  \n \n   "], "metadata": {"Creator": "PRMP_RRP&APP_FINAL.doc - Microsoft Word", "CreationDate": "D:20031117104729Z", "Title": "PRMP_RRP&APP_FINAL.doc", "Author": "mp6", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 5.0 for Windows NT", "ModDate": "D:20040210143228+08'00'"}, "author_page": "   \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 30 June.
