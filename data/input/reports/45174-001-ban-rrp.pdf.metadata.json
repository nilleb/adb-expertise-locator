The  Bangladesh \nRoad  Master  Plan  2007  forecast  annual  growth  of  6.4%  in  both  freight  and  passenger  traffic \nduring 2010\u20132015 and 6.0% over the master plan period (2005\u20132025).  \n \n4. \nDhaka  and  Chittagong  are  the  two  major  metropolitan  areas  of  Bangladesh.  Dhaka  is \nthe  main  commercial  and  administrative  center  of  the  country;  Chittagong  is  the  primary \nseaport,  accounting  for  about  90%  of  imports  and  exports.  About  a  quarter  of  Bangladesh\u2019s \npopulation  lives  in  the  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong  corridor.  The  government\u2019s  Sixth  Five-Year  Plan, \n2011\u20132015  assigns  the  highest  priority  to  increasing  the  capacity  of  the  existing  Dhaka\u2013\nChittagong  Highway,  which  is  part  of  the  Asian  Highway  network,  by  widening  it  to  four  lanes \nand building the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong Expressway.  \n \n5. \nRoad traffic between Dhaka and Chittagong is hampered by the lack of capacity of the \nexisting  250-kilometer  highway  and  load  restrictions  on  bridges.  In  general,  a  fully  loaded \ncontainer cannot be transported by road to Dhaka. Road safety on the two-lane highway is poor \nbecause  it  is  overcrowded  with  different  types  of  vehicles,  including  rickshaws,  bicycles, \nmotorcycles, cars, buses, and trucks. The journey between Dhaka and Chittagong can take up \nto 10 hours because of congestion on the road.  \n \n6. \nBased on traffic counts in 2009, 20,000\u201325,000 motorized vehicles\u2014up to 40% of them \ntrucks\u2014use the highway each day. 3 The number of motorized vehicles is expected to grow to at \nleast 35,000 in 2020, 66,000 in 2030, and more than 119,000 in 2040, depending on the section \nand selected scenario for the traffic forecast. 4 The 2009 traffic count indicates that the capacity \nof  the  existing  two-lane  highway  is  already  saturated;  the  capacity  of  the  four-lane  highway \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Asian  Development  Bank.  2008.  Public\u2013Private  Partnership  Handbook.  Manila.  The  term  \u201cpublic\u2013private \npartnership\u201d  describes  a  range  of  possible  relationships  among  public  and  private  entities  in  the  context  of \ninfrastructure and other services.  \n\n3   Data for 2009 from the database of the Roads and Highways Department, Ministry of Communication, Government \n\nof Bangladesh. \n\n4   Traffic  forecast  prepared  as  part  of  the  feasibility  study  and  conceptual  design  for  a  four-lane  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong \naccess-controlled expressway, prepared with funding from an ADB project completed in 2008. ADB. 2000. Report \nand  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nBangladesh for the Road Maintenance and Improvement Project. Manila (Loan 1789-BAN). \n\n\fcurrently under construction will be saturated shortly after 2020 because of the mixed traffic and \nlarge  number  of  intersections,  villages,  and  towns  served  by  the  highway.  This  demonstrates \nthe  need  for  the  additional  road  transport  capacity  that  will  be  provided  by  the  Dhaka\u2013\nChittagong Expressway. \n \n7. \nDhaka  and  Chittagong  are  also  linked  by  air,  inland  waterways,  and  railway,  but  road \nand railway links handle the bulk of passenger and high-value cargo traffic in this corridor. Both \nof these modes of transport are facing serious capacity bottlenecks. About half of the length of \nthe 327-kilometer railway line between Dhaka and Chittagong is only a single-track line, which \nlimits  the  number  of  daily  trains.  Passenger  trains  are  frequently  sold  out  and  because \npassenger  transportation  is  given  preference  over  freight  transportation,  only  four  container \ntrains  operate  between  Dhaka  and  Chittagong  daily,  carrying  about  10%  of  the  containers  to \nand from Chittagong Port. \n \n8. \nTo  address  the  transport  needs  in  this  corridor,  the  government  is  (i)  upgrading  the \nexisting  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong  highway  by  widening  of  the  remaining  two-lane  sections  to  four \nlanes, which is planned for completion by 2013; (ii) improving the capacity of the railway line by \nmaking the remaining single-track sections double-track, which is planned for completion in 3\u20135 \nyears;  and  (iii)  planning  to  build  a  new  access-controlled  expressway.  This  expressway  will \nprovide  enough  additional  capacity  in  this  important  corridor  to  accommodate  future  traffic \ngrowth  and  will  also  meet  the  demand  for  a  safer  and  more  reliable  road  connection.  This \nexpressway is badly needed, particularly with recent high-level intergovernmental consultations \nand  agreements  that  will  allow  better  access  for  Bhutan,  India,  and  Nepal  to  Chittagong  Port. \nThis additional traffic of goods and passengers will use the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong corridor and has \nto be considered when planning the road capacity between Dhaka and Chittagong.  \n \n9. \nThe congestion on the existing highway requires the government to progress rapidly with \nthis  core  transport  project.  Because  funds  available  for  the  follow-on  investment  project  are \nlimited and the financing needs are large, opportunities for private sector participation have to \nbe identified to structure and implement the first PPP project in Bangladesh\u2019s transport sector. \nThis is in line with ADB's long-term strategy to promote infrastructure projects with private sector \nparticipation.  High-quality  international  consultants  should  be  engaged  in  a  timely  manner  to \nsupport  streamlined  and  efficient  preparation  of  the  PPP  project,  which  will  allow  the \ngovernment  to  enter  into  a  fair  agreement  with  the  private  sector  based  on  a  detailed  design \nwith proper allocation of risks between the parties. \n \nThe  TA  loan  benefits  from  the  findings  of  a  study  financed  by  ADB  and  completed  in \n10. \n2008,  which  prepared  a  pre-feasibility  study  and  conceptual  design  for  an  access-controlled \nDhaka\u2013Chittagong  Expressway  (footnote  4).  The  study  concluded  that  the  route  alignment \nselected for the study of the expressway is technically, economical, and financially viable based \non 2008 assumptions, costs, and revenue streams. The selected option was estimated to cost \n$2.75 billion equivalent in 2011 prices and the implementation period was assumed to be 5\u20136 \nyears. However, the government failed to attract private investment for the project studied and is \ndiscussing different route alignment options that were not appraised in the earlier study. Earlier \nattempts to recruit a concessionaire on a PPP basis failed mainly because (i) a detailed route \nalignment  design  had  not  been  agreed  upon,  creating  uncertainty  about  the  required  land \nacquisition;  (ii)  an  attractive  legal  framework  and  risk  allocation  between  the  partners  was \nlacking;  and  (iii)  the  foreign  currency  exchange  risk  allocation  was  unclear.  The  cost  and \nrevenue streams have changed since the 2008 study and an understanding was reached that a \nsuccessful PPP project needs detailed project preparation, especially as this project will be the \nfirst large PPP project implemented in Bangladesh\u2019s transport sector. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fPreparing  the  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong  Expressway  for  financing  under  a  PPP  is  in  line  with \n11. \nthe  government\u2019s  target  in  the  Sixth  Five-Year  Plan  to  triple  investments  in  infrastructure \ndevelopment from 2% to 6% of gross domestic product through substantial private participation. \nThis  TA  loan  will  benefit  from  the  PPP  unit  established  in  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office  with  the \nsupport of capacity development TA from ADB.5 The capacity development TA also supported \nthe  government  in  proposing  an  institutional  and  legal  framework  for  PPP  projects,  and  in \ndrafting a new PPP law and an environmental and social management system for PPP projects. \nProposed  future  assistance  to  Bangladesh  will  support  capacity  development  for  the \nimplementation of PPP projects. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  TA  loan  will  facilitate  project  preparation  for  a  follow-on  project,  resulting  in  the \n12. \nDhaka\u2013Chittagong  Expressway  being  efficiently  constructed,  operated,  and  managed  under  a \nPPP.  The  outcome  of  the  TA  loan  will  be  an  agreed  upon  design  of  the  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong \nExpressway for implementation under a PPP. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n13. \n\nThe project will provide the following: \n(i) \n(ii) \n\na feasibility study with an assessment of different route alignment options;  \nthe  economic  and  financial  analysis  for  the  follow-on  project,  the  structuring  of \nthe PPP, the financial model for the follow-on project, and a recommendation of \nthe PPP structure for the follow-on project;  \ncapacity development in PPP project implementation for the executing agency;  \nthe detailed engineering design for the selected option, including the finalization \nof all safeguard documents;  \ntransaction  advisory  services  for  the  preparation  of  the  prequalification  and \nbidding documents for the concession agreement, preparation of the concession \nagreement,  and  support  for  the  executing  agency  during  the  bidding  process; \nand  \nsupport for safeguard implementation in the follow-on project. \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n \nD. \n \n14. \nduties.

It  will  also  contribute  to \nregional  cooperation  and  integration  by  strengthening  connectivity  of  neighboring  countries  to \nChittagong Port, while increasing Bangladesh\u2019s trade competitiveness. \n \n20. \nPreparing  the  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong  Expressway  for  financing  under  a  PPP  will  help  the \ngovernment achieve its target to triple investment in infrastructure development from 2% to 6% \nof  gross  domestic  product  through  substantial  private  participation.  It  will  also  support  the \ngovernment  in  raising  the  required  funds  from  the  private  sector  by  minimizing  the  risks  to \nprivate investors through thorough project preparation. \n \n21. \nselection  of \n\nThe  proposed  TA  loan  will  support  the  project\u2019s  feasibility  study,  detailed  design, \nthe \n\nthe  concessionaire,  and  safeguard \n\nimplementation,  ensuring \n\nthat  (i) \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nimplementation of the follow-on project will not be delayed, (ii) the positive impacts of the follow-\non project will not be delayed, and (iii) the government will mobilize private sector financing and \nbenefit  from  the  private  sector\u2019s  efficiency  in  project  implementation  to  satisfy  the  huge  needs \nfor infrastructure investment in Bangladesh.  \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n22. \nFinancial management. The MOC has prior and ongoing experience with implementing \nADB-funded  projects  through  the  Bangladesh  Bridge  Authority,  and  the  Roads  and  Highways \nDepartment.  The  MOC  has  knowledge  of  project  financial  accounting  methods  and  ADB \ndisbursement  procedures.  For  the  proposed  TA  loan,  one  accountant  will  be  included  in  the \nproject  implementation  unit  (PIU).  MOC  officials  have  participated  in  workshops  run  by  ADB \nconsultants on good practices in financial management. \n \n23. \nThe PIU will establish and maintain separate project records and accounts to identify the \nfinances received and expenditures made under the TA loan, ensuring an adequate audit trail. \nThe  accounts  will  be  set  up  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles.  Independent \nauditors acceptable to ADB will audit the accounts and related financial statements annually.  \n \n24. \nProcurement and anticorruption measures. Recruitment of consultants will be carried \nout  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended  from \ntime to time), and the procurement of equipment will be in accordance with ADB Procurement \nGuidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  ADB  will  select  the  consultants  and  the \nRoads and Highway Department under the MOC will negotiate contracts with them (para. 18). \nThis  recruitment  process  will  help  to  ensure  that  consulting  services  are  available  in  a  timely \nmanner.  The  procurement  rules  for  selection  of  contractors  required  by  international  financial \ninstitutions  such  as  ADB  are  considered  sufficiently  robust  to  deter  corruption  during  bid \nselection.  National  procurement  regulation  has  also  improved  through  the  Public  Procurement \nAct,  2006,  and  the  related  Public  Procurement  Rules  (2008)  with  subsequent  amendments. \nDuring  implementation  of  the  TA  loan,  reports  will  be  submitted  to  the  executing  agency  and \nADB in line with submission milestones to ensure the quality and timeliness of the consultants' \nwork. \n \n25. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOC.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 6). \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nC. \n\n26. \nThe TA loan will focus on project preparation and will ensure that the follow-on project \nwill be prepared in full compliance with ADB's Handbook for Incorporation of Social Dimensions \nin Projects and Handbook on Social Analysis.7 Gender, labor, HIV/AIDS, and other social risks \nrelated  to  the  follow-on  project  will  be  assessed  as  part  of  the  feasibility  study  under  the  TA \nloan, and a mitigation plan will be prepared to address those issues. \n \n\n                                                 \n7   ADB.  1994.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fD. \n\nSafeguards \n\ninitial  environmental  examinations,  as  applicable, \n\n27. \nThe  TA  loan  will  support  the  development  of  an  environmentally  and  socially  viable \nfollow-on project. The TA loan will support the government in safeguard implementation to avoid \nproject start-up delays. The TA loan project is classified category C for environment, involuntary \nresettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  because  the  alignment  options  for  the  follow-on  project \nwill  be  studied.  The  project  will  be  reexamined  and  reclassified  as  appropriate  after  the \nfeasibility  study.  During  the  detailed  design  stage,  the  consultants  will  prepare  environmental \nincluding \nimpact  assessments  and \nenvironmental  management  plans.  Similarly,  the  resettlement  plans,  small  ethnic  communities \nplans, and gender analysis will be prepared. If the follow-on project is implemented as a PPP, \nsafeguard  documents  will  be  drafted  following  the  environmental  and  social  management \nsystem  that  is  being  prepared  by  the  PPP  unit  in  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office.  Safeguard \ndocumentation will be prepared in accordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009); \ngovernment guidelines, regulations, and policies; and the safeguard policies of other financiers. \nAll  safeguard  documentation  will  follow  the  approval  and  disclosure  process  set  forth  in  the \nSafeguard Policy Statement prior to the implementation of the safeguard by the government. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n28.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in paras. 29\u201332 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.8 The integrated benefits and impacts \nare expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nImplementation delays. Close ADB supervision during implementation will address the \n29. \nrisk of delays. ADB selection of the consultants will expedite the process. This will also help to \nattract  qualified  consultants  for  fast  project  implementation.  Safeguard  specialists  engaged \nunder the TA loan will help to mitigate the risk of slow implementation of safeguards caused by \nlimited interagency coordination. \n \n30.  Weak capacity for review, assessment, and approval of public\u2013private partnership \nprojects. ADB provided capacity development TA to support the government in establishing the \nPPP  unit  in  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office  (footnote  5).  To  further  build  the  capacity  of  the \ngovernment in reviewing and implementing PPP projects, future assistance to Bangladesh will \nbe proposed to support PPP program implementation. \n \n31.  Weak  capacity  for  the  implementation  of  public\u2013private  partnership  projects.  To \nensure  that  sufficient  capacity  for  the  implementation  of  PPP  projects  is  available  in  the  MOC \nand  the  PIU  in  the  Roads  and  Highways  Department,  the  feasibility  study  will  examine  the \nneeds  for  a  capacity  development  program.  Such  a  program  will  be  implemented  during  the \ndetailed design stage. \n \n32. \nDelays  in  government  approvals. Support will be provided to strengthen the capacity \nof  the  MOC  in  preparing  the  necessary  documentation  for  the  approval  of  the  TA  loan.  Staff \nconsultants will support the MOC in preparing the documents and during the approval process. \n \n\n                                                 \n8   Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nThe  government  and  the  MOC  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \n\n33. \nThe  government  and  the  MOC  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services selection, and disbursement as described \nin detail in the PAM and the loan documents. \n \n34. \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement. \n \n35. \nThe appointment of a project director satisfactory to ADB, the establishment of the PIU, \nand the execution of the contracts for consulting services shall be conditions for disbursement \nunder the loan agreement. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n36. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR6,439,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Dhaka\u2013\nChittagong  Expressway  Public\u2013Private  Partnership  Design  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and \n1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such \nother  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft \nloan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n8 March 2012 \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance Targets \nand Indicators \n(Baselines: Zero) \n\n \nDhaka\u2013Chittagong \nExpressway in \noperation under a \nPPP by 2020  \n\n \nReporting mechanism to \nbe drafted under PPP \nconcession agreement \n \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms  \n\nAssumptions  \nand Risks  \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \nDhaka\u2013Chittagong \nExpressway efficiently \nconstructed, \noperated, and \nmanaged under a \nPPP  \n\nOutcome \nAgreed upon design \nof the Dhaka\u2013\nChittagong \nExpressway for \nimplementation under \na PPP \n\nOutputs \n1.
