It will be the first project for the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) comprehensively addressing ECS and services development by public \nand private sector. \n\n \n\nA. \n\nRationale   \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n3. \nThe most significant demographic challenge facing the PRC is the aging of the population, \nand the social and economic impacts that will occur because of the rapid pace and scale of the \ndemographic change. The proportion of people above the age of 60 across the PRC is expected \nto  grow  from  about  12%  in  2010  to  34%  by  2050.  Traditional  family  support  systems  are \nincreasingly  unable  to  meet  elderly  care  needs  because  of  the  combined  impacts  of  fast \nurbanization,  internal  migration  of  youth  away  from  rural  areas,  and  the  one-child  policy.  The \npopulation is aging rapidly while the country\u2019s per capita income is still modest and social security \nsystems are insufficient to meet the needs of senior citizens. The growing demand for quality and \naffordable  ECSS  and  development  of  care  models  for  urban  and  rural  areas  exceeds  supply. \nThese are urgent development issues that must be addressed.2 \n \n4. \nHebei  entered  \u201caging  society\u201d  status  in  1999  when  it  passed  the  10%  threshold  of \npopulation over the age of 60. This is projected to be 17% in 2016, rising to 31% by 2050. The \nprovince  has  great  diversity  in  the  distribution  of  elderly,  their  care  needs,  income  levels,  and \navailability of services. Some rural counties have a high density of elderly who are \u201cleft behind\u201d \nafter their children have moved to urban areas. Few elderly remain in other counties, making it \ndifficult to provide decentralized services. Urban areas are aging at different rates, resulting in a \nvariety of demand for services. The government has identified Hebei as a demonstration province \nfor  elderly  care  development  because  of  its  experience  in  developing  a  rural  care  model,  and \nsince it is representative of the challenges other provinces  face with limited government funds \navailable for elderly care and growing elderly populations.3 A strong desire exists in the province\u2014\nand nationally\u2014to identify models and implementation partnerships that can deliver quality and \naffordable  ECSS.  To  achieve  this,  it  is  necessary  to  identify  and  define  the  optimum  roles  for \ngovernment, private sector, civil society stakeholders, and the public in elderly care. \n \n5. \nThe PRC\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015 supported creating a three-tiered old age \ncare system with home-based care as the base, community care as a support, and residential \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The project is included in ADB. 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2016\u20132018. \n\nManila. \n\n3  In  2008,  a  model  of  mutual  support  communal  homes  for  the  rural  elderly  called  \u201cXingfu  Yards\u201d  (translated  as \n\n\u201cHappiness Yards\u201d) was developed, which the Ministry of Civil Affairs has rolled out nationally since 2011. \n\n\fcare as supplement.4 This is in line with international trends to support \u201caging in place\u201d (supporting \nelderly to live in their communities), de-institutionalization, and active aging. The PRC\u2019s Thirteenth \nFive-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020 seeks to expand coverage, and enhance the quality of services by \ndeveloping  the  private  sector  and  civil  society  organizations  capacity  to  play  a  greater  role  in \nelderly  care.5 The government  is  seeking models for  elderly  care  that  address key  challenges: \nfinancing gaps, developing the market, and improving the unbalanced rural\u2013urban development. \nIn the next 5 years, significant changes are expected to take place: (i) subsidies to the sector will \nincrease and be better targeted, and new programs such as long-term care insurance may play \na greater role in promoting access; and (ii) the next generation of elderly (particularly urban) will \nbe better-off and more able to afford care. Stimulating the role of the private sector and civil society \nis critical for expanding coverage and improving the quality of services. ADB\u2019s recently approved \nproject  in  Yichang  Municipality,  Hubei  will  develop  one  approach\u2014a  model  public\u2013private \npartnerships for ECSS in urban districts.6 A range of other models that can successfully operate \nin  less-developed  areas,  build  new  partnerships for  service  delivery,  and  address  the  multiple \ncare needs of aging populations, also needs to be developed. \n \nTranslating national policies into programs in Hebei is challenging. For residential nursing \n6. \ncare, only 50% of the projected total need for beds (250,000) in the province is available, and \npublic perceptions and the quality of elderly care facilities are low. Human resources, incentives, \nand policies to retain and train staff, are insufficient. Planning for the expansion of ECSS is not \nsystematic, and home and community care services are largely underdeveloped. Critical service \nareas  such  as  dementia  care  and  rehabilitation  are  very  limited,  and  government  financing  of \nelderly care is insufficient. To help address the lack of services, local governments are seeking \nways  to  incentivize  new  care  models  and  private  and  civil  society  organizations  (CSOs) \ninvolvement, neither of which are yet significant. Poor public perceptions of the quality of services, \naffordability, and traditional cultural attitudes are key constraints to the uptake and sustainability \nof services. \n \nTo address these problems, the project will develop five anchor elderly care residential \n7. \nfacilities (run by the public and private sectors) targeting elderly with long-term care needs.7 These \nwill  serve  as  care  hubs,  and  develop  and  operate  home-  and  community-based  care  (HCBC) \nservices and information and communication technology (ICT) networks to serve a broad range \nof elderly. This will support the concept of \u201caging in place\u201d, a lifestyle that consultations with elderly \nfound  that  most  prefer,  and  affordable care  options.  Additional  facilities and  services,  such  as \nrehabilitation  centers,  will  be  constructed  to  help  relieve  pressure  on  hospital  beds  to  improve \nhealth  and  elderly  care  sector  integration\u2014an  emerging  government  policy  focus.  Capacity \nbuilding for implementing agencies, local civil affairs bureaus (CABs), and implementation of pilot \nprojects  to  address  critical  aspects  of  ECS  development  are  integral  to  the  project  design. \nYanshan  University  will  develop  an  elderly  care  training  center  and  short-  and  long-term  new \ncourses in five priority areas: (i) caregiving and nursing, (ii) occupational therapy, (iii) elderly care \nmanagement,  (iv) geriatric  psychology,  and  (v)  ICT  for  elderly  care.  Together,  the  subprojects \n                                                \n4  Government of the PRC, State Council. 2011.

The  project  supports  the  PRC\u2019s  Thirteenth  Five-Year  Plan,  2016\u20132020 \n(footnote  5)  and  the  Hebei  Provincial  Thirteenth  Five-Year  Plan,  2016\u20132020,  which  seek  to \ndevelop the ECS, stimulate investment, and define roles and responsibilities for the government \nand the private and CSOs. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u2013\n2020  pillar  on  inclusive  growth;  the  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020,  which  supports  social \nprotection and health; and the Operational Plan for Health, 2015\u20132020, which has elderly care as \na focus area.8 \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n9. \nThe  impact,  which  is  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  goal,  will  be  an  established \ncomprehensive  three-tiered  ECS  (home,  community,  and  residential).  The  outcome  will  be \nimproved capacity of the ECS and quality of ECSS in Hebei. \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n10. \nThe project will have four outputs. Output 1, improved community and home care services, \nwill  develop  (i)  selected community  centers,  (ii) services and support  networks to improve and \nexpand  service  delivery  and  quality,  (iii)  capacity  of  the  implementing  agencies  to  create \nsustainable HCBC services that meet the needs of the elderly, and (iv) ICT networks that support \nthe elderly and service delivery. Output 2, increased residential elderly care service capacity and \nimproved quality, will (i) provide residential care services for elderly  with various types of need \n(i.e., nursing care, dementia care, rehabilitation); (ii) establish links to existing health care facilities \nand home and community care to support a continuum of care; and (iii) serve as demonstration \nmodels of government and private sector collaboration for other small cities seeking to improve \nelderly care quality and service delivery. Output 3, improved development of human resources \nand industry capacity, will help address the human resources shortages and quality by supporting \nYanshan University to develop (i) training programs and faculty capacity in emerging service areas, \nsuch as caregiving and nursing, rehabilitation, elderly care management, technology to support \nelderly  care,  and  counseling;  (ii)  curriculum  and  training  materials  in  the  priority  areas  with \nselected academic and training institutions across the province; and (iii) an elderly care training \nand  research  center,  and  student  dormitory  on  the  Yanshan  University  campus.  Output  4, \nimproved capacity of elderly care sector organizations, will build the capacity of stakeholders and \nlocal  CABs  in  planning,  elderly  care  management,  assessment,  and  quality  assurance  and \nmonitoring. It  will  also  implement  innovative pilot  projects  in priority  areas, such  as  health  and \nelderly  care  integration,  new  services  development  (rehabilitation  and  dementia  care),  HCBC \nservices,  and  ICT.  Training  and  advisory  support  will  be  provided  to  facilitate  the  efficient \nimplementation and operationalization of the ECSS.  \n \n11. \nInnovative features. The project will have demonstration value for other PRC provinces \nand developing countries in Asia and the Pacific facing similar challenges of aging populations.9 \nInnovative features include the development of (i) an integrated elderly care service model that \nlinks home, community, and residential care and management; (ii) pilot projects to support good \npractice ECS development in  areas such as management, quality assurance, and new services \n                                                \n8  ADB.  2016.

The project design also includes limited start-up \nconsulting  to  assist  with  project-readiness  activities.  The  terms  of  reference  for  consulting \nservices are in the PAM. \n \n\nIII. \n\nATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n18. \nThe  capacity  development TA  to  be financed  by  ADB  is  included  to  provide  support  to \nlocal  government  county  civil  affairs  bureaus  (CABs)  to  help  build  their  sector  management \ncapacity and address key issues, including (i) sector planning and regulation, (ii) social inclusion \nand assessment of care needs, and (iii) use of the CSOs as resource to expand the scope and \nprovision of elderly care services. The TA is estimated to cost $695,150, of which $670,000 will \nbe financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). \nIt has six outputs: (i) a model demand-based elderly care sector plan and supporting planning \nmanual; (ii) a demonstration elderly care assessment system, including user tool kits, computer \nsoftware,  and  implementation  guidance;  (iii)  model  procedures  for  the  effective  regulation  of \nelderly  care  service  providers;  (iv)  the  creation  of  a  model  arrangement  for  the  effective \ninvolvement of the CSOs in elderly care provision; (v) a pilot online support for family caregivers; \nand  (vi)  effective  TA  dissemination.  HPG  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  HPMO  will  be  the \nimplementing  agency  over  the  five-year  implementation  period.  HPG  will  provide  counterpart \nsupport in the form of staff, office accommodation, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE  \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nThe project will finance construction of (i) five elderly care institutions, (ii) 51 community \n19. \ncenters  and/or  offices,  (iii)  a  center  of  excellence  for  human  resource  development;  and \n(iv) procurement and installation of associated equipment. Technical feasibility was found to be \nadequate after careful examination of the project\u2019s compatibility with local conditions and future \ndemand  projections  for  elderly  care  service.  All  buildings,  with  a  total  area  of  about \n172,000 square meters (m2), will be designed and constructed in accordance with relevant design \nstandards  and  codes.  International  and  domestic  best  practices  were  studied  to  optimize  the \nfunctional,  aesthetic,  engineering,  environmental,  and  economic  aspects  of  the  facilities.  The \narchitectural  design  will  follow  community-based,  care-focused,  efficient,  inclusive,  and  non-\ninstitutional principles established during project preparation. The design incorporates infection \ncontrol, fire control, accident prevention, and emergency evacuation to ensure user safety. Low-\n\n \n\n\fcarbon, resource-efficient measures, including solar and photovoltaic panels, water recycling, and \npassive energy-saving designs will be adopted. All five elderly care institutions will be designed \nto meet the two-star national green building standard.11 About 88% of the community centers will \nbe housed in rehabilitated existing buildings. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial   \n\n20. \nEconomic  analysis.  Economic  benefits  will  include  (i)  an  increase  in  the  years  of  life \ngained  and  enhanced  quality  of  life  for  the  elderly  through  improving  care  services,  better \nintegration of elderly care and medical services, and support for \u201caging in place; (ii) labor released \nfrom informal care, such as the return of the adult children who have been caregivers to the  labor \nmarket; (iii) medical cost savings, since formal elderly care is professional and performs better in \nacute  and  chronic  disease  prevention,  reducing  morbidity  and  hospital  admissions;  (iv) fall \nprevention;  (v)  time  savings  for  informal  caregivers,  increased  number  of  employment \nopportunities, and earnings; (vi) benefits generated by ICT, such as administration cost savings \nand  a higher  possibility  of  independent  living;  and (vii) increased  number  of trained  caregivers \nand medical personnel certified by the new university programs, measured by the wage premium. \nHowever, these benefits are difficult to quantify, so only three benefit streams were applied for \nthe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  calculation:  (i)  years  of  life  gained from  residential \ncare; (ii) other benefits (revenues at elderly care centers, community and home care centers, and \nrehabilitation centers); and (iii) the wage premium from students trained at Yanshan University. \nAt a 12% discount rate, the whole project is found to be economically viable with a net present \nvalue of CNY515.0 million and a base case EIRR of 18.5%. The subproject baseline EIRRs are \nas follows: Chengde City 16.7%, Julu County 22.1%, Li County 16.7%, She County 20.6%, Xinji \nCity 17.3%, and Yanshan University 20.3%.12 \n  \n21. \nFinancial  sustainability.  Financial  analysis  has  been  undertaken  to  establish  the \nproject\u2019s financial viability.13 The two main analyses conducted were (i) a financial sustainability \nanalysis,  including  calculation  of  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  for  revenue-generating \nsubprojects; and (ii) due diligence on the veracity of the proposed counterpart financing plans. \nThe financial analysis shows that the estimated project financial internal rate of return  (5.52%) \ncomfortably exceeds the weighted average cost of capital (2.84%) for the overall project. Each \nrevenue-generating  subproject  also  passed  this  test.  The  results  were  robust  against  all  the \nnormal sensitivities, but are most vulnerable to income shortfalls. Financial projections indicate \ncash shortages in the early years of operations, which may require additional financing in adverse \ncircumstances.  Difficulties  were  encountered  in  obtaining  evidence  to  verify  that  the  proposed \nprivate investors have the necessary financial means and commitment to the project. This has \nbeen resolved by the investors agreeing to make an up-front equity contribution of 20% of total \nsubproject  costs.  For  the  Yanshan  University  subproject,  a  fiscal  sustainability  analysis  was \nperformed, which shows that net incremental costs of the proposed subproject will constitute a \nmaximum of 1.0% of gross Yanshan University revenues during project construction, decreasing \nto 0.6% once the facilities are fully operational. This incremental burden is considered sustainable.  \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n22. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB \nguidelines, and identified the main financial management risks as (i) implementation risk: lack of \n                                                \n11 Government  of  the  PRC,  Ministry  of  Housing  and  Urban\u2013Rural  Development.  2015.  Green  Building  Evaluation \n\nStandard (GB.T50378-2014). Beijing. \n\n12 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nfamiliarity  with  ADB  disbursement  procedures  and  requirements,  which  may  delay  project \nimplementation;  (ii)  compliance  risk:  lack  of  familiarity  with  ADB  financial  management \nrequirements, particularly relating to accounting, reporting, and auditing, which may delay project \nreporting and the identification of issues on the use of loan proceeds; (iii) financing risk: delays in \nthe provision of, or inadequate counterpart funding, which may delay project implementation; and \n(iv)  construction  and  operational  risks:  inadequate  experience  in  construction  and  services \noperating  management,  which  will  affect  project  progress  and  the  quality  of  services  to  be \nprovided  after  project  completion.  The  overall  financial  management  risk  rating  of  the  project, \nbefore considering mitigating measures, is substantial. Agreed mitigation measures have been \nbuilt into the project design and will be closely monitored during project implementation.14 \n \n23. \nA  procurement  risk  assessment  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB  project \nadministration  instructions,  using  a  risk-based  approach.  The  assessment  reveals  that,  at \nexecuting agency level, HPMO, which will oversee project procurement, has extensive experience \nand  proven  performance  in  managing  the  forms  of  procurement  required.  However,  at \nimplementing agency level, capacity is lower and the risk is higher, especially for the privately-\nowned implementing agencies. This risk will be mitigated through  HPMO\u2019s oversight, the early \nappointment  of  an  experienced  procurement  agent,  training  of  implementing  agency  staff,  and \nconsulting support (footnote 14), with increased oversight for the private implementing agencies. \nWith these measures in place, the risk of misprocurement is considered moderate. \n \n24. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  HPG,  the  executing  agency.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n\nD. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n25. \nA poverty and social assessment was conducted. Based on the consultations undertaken, \nmost  elderly  prefer  to  be  taken  care  of  by  their  children,  followed  by  a  preference  for  HCBC \nservices to support independent living, and then residential care if necessary because of disability \nor lack of care services from the family or community. The expansion of HCBC services under \nthe project will support this strong aging in place preference and address the need for lower cost \ncare services. Individual elderly care decisions are influenced by a variety of factors, including an \nolder  person\u2019s  health  condition,  economic  status,  age,  level  of  education,  number  of  children, \ntraditional  elderly  care  concepts,  and social  networks.  Given  the  diversity  of  elderly,  their  care \nneeds, and income levels, assessing the affordability of ECSS across the population is difficult. \nResidential  care,  which  provides  services  for  disabled  elderly,  is  expensive  for  most  low-  and \nmiddle-income  elderly.  Financing  of  elderly  care  is  a  major  issue.  This  project  will  take  place \nduring a time of rapid developments in policies on subsidies and other support, such as long-term \ncare insurance and the possible use of medical insurance for elderly care. The construction of \nelderly care facilities and their operation will create about 2,200 new jobs. The project will benefit \nabout  300,000  persons  in  the  six  project  areas  when  services  are  operational,  and  Yanshan \nUniversity will have certified 4,400 students at project completion. The project targets low- and \nmiddle-income elderly, who make up about 40% of the total elderly, and will promote improved \ncare assessment systems to allow care to be directed to those most in need. \n \n26. \nGender.  Among  the  elderly,  women  typically  outnumber,  live  longer,  yet  have  poorer \nhealth and lower incomes than men. Family contributions often play a significant role in access to \ncare  services  for  both  women  and  men,  but  to  what  degree  varies  among  individuals  and \n\n                                                \n14 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fcircumstances.  Development  of  elderly  care  will  help  relieve  family  caregivers  and  give \nunsupported elderly better access to care. Benefits will include reduced time burdens for family \ncaregivers and improved job opportunities in a service industry traditionally dominated by females. \nA social and gender action plan has been prepared and agreed.15 \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\n27. \ncategories are as follows. \n \n28. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE),  including  an \nenvironmental management plan, was prepared and will be disclosed on the ADB website. The \nIEE  complies  with  ADB\u2019s  SPS.  The  project  will  help  establish  safe,  operationally  and  energy-\nefficient  public  buildings,  which  meet  the  two-star  national  green  building  standards.  The  IEE \nconcludes  that  the  project\u2019s  anticipated  environmental  impacts  can  be  mitigated  through \nimplementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan.  Some  environmental  impacts  are \nanticipated, including waste, wastewater, noise, fugitive dust, community and occupational health, \nand  safety.  Overall,  implementation-related  impacts  are  localized,  short-term,  and  can  be \neffectively  mitigated  through  the  application  of  good  construction  and  housekeeping  practices, \nand implementation of construction phase community and occupational health and safety plans. \nDuring  operation,  no  major  environmental  impacts  are  anticipated,  and  minor  impacts  will  be \naddressed \nthrough  conventional  operation  and  maintenance  practices.  Environmental \nmanagement  is  supported  by  loan  covenants,  capacity  development,  and  institutional-\nstrengthening activities under the project. Environmental complaints or disputes will be handled \nin accordance with the grievance redress mechanism established for the project. \n \n29. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  (category  B).  Four  resettlement \nplans  have  been  prepared  for  Xinji  City,  She  County,  Shuangluan  District,  and  Li  County  in \naccordance  with  government  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  SPS.  A  total  of  168.75  mu  of \ncollective  land  will  be  affected,  most  of  which  is  unused  land,  garden  land,  and  collective \nconstruction land not allocated to any households.16 Of these, 32.37 mu are cultivated land. The \nimpacts on 91 households (310 persons) are marginal as their main source of income is mostly \nnonagricultural, with agricultural income accounting for only 2%\u20134% of their total income. Houses \nto be demolished (1,195 m2) will affect two enterprises and 11 workers. Extensive consultations \nwere carried out during resettlement planning, and key information in the resettlement plans was \ndisclosed  in  October  2016  by  distributing  copies  of  resettlement  information  booklets  to  the \naffected villages and households. The resettlement plans have a provision on leasing land and \nproperties for establishing community elderly care centers. The cost of resettlement is estimated \nat CNY28.46 million, including contingencies. Due diligence was carried out for the 39.75 mu of \nproject land previously acquired.17This concluded that resettlement planning and implementation \nwere carried out satisfactorily, in accordance with state and provincial regulations and policies. \nThe executing agency has the capacity to update, implement, and monitor the resettlement plans. \nThe indigenous peoples impact is categorized C. Ethnic minorities make up 4.55% of the total \npopulation in Hebei, of which 71% are Man. Two project sites in Shuangluan District and Chengde \nCity  have  a  larger  ethnic  minority  population,  but  the  social  assessment  determined  that  this \npopulation  is  well-integrated  socially  and  economically  in  the  project  areas,  and  it  will  not  be \nadversely affected by land acquisition and resettlement. \n \n                                                \n15 Social and Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 m2). \n17 Resettlement Plan 4: Xinji City (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nF. \n \n30.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  not  previously  referred  to  in  this  report  are \nsummarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan \n(footnote 14). The overall risk was rated as medium. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nRisks \nAvailability of counterpart financing \ncannot be confirmed \nAffordability and demand \nassumptions for elderly care services \nprove overoptimistic; social \ninclusiveness objectives prove \nunachievable. \nDelay in procurement or \nmisprocurement \n\nImplementing agencies fail to build \nadequate capacity to construct \nsuitable elderly care facilities and \nprovide quality services. \nPrivate implementing agency \nbusiness plans prove unrealistic, \nleading to inadequate revenues and \ncash flow deficiencies. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nMitigation Measures \nEach  private  implementing  agency  has  deposited  a  ring-fenced  equity \ncontribution of at least 20% of the total estimated investment cost.  \nThe proposed pricing schedule is already in use at one public elderly care \ninstitution in Julu County. Capacity building will develop in-depth business \nplans for each implementing agency. The national government is reviewing \nsubsidy  arrangements  with  a  view  to  improving  their  targeting  and \neffectiveness. \nHebei  Project  Management  Office,  which  will  oversee  procurement,  is \nhighly  experienced.  Implementing  agencies  will  be  supported  by  a \nprocurement agency and consulting support from a procurement specialist. \nIncreased  oversight  will  be  applied  to  the  procurement  activities  of  the \nprivate implementing agencies because of the elevated risk they present. \nThe implementing agencies will have support from consultants for design \nreview, procurement, and construction management. Other consultants will \nwork  in  parallel  to  prepare  implementing  agencies  for  the  services  and \noperational phase and will support, as needed, until loan closure. \nPeriodic testing of assumptions and market research to be undertaken to \nassess  the  continued  viability  of  private  implementing  agency  business \nplans. Local governments have given an assurance on service continuity \nin the event of implementing agency financial failure. \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \nThe government and the HPG have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \n31. \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. The government and the HPG have agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n32. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$100,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Hebei Elderly Care Development Project, \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  in  regular  terms,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof  20  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented \nto the Board. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n16 May 2017 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nImpact the Project is Aligned With \nA comprehensive three-tiered elderly care system (home, community, and residential) established \n(Opinions on Promoting the Development of Senior Care Service Industry [Circular No. 35, 2013])a  \n\nPerformance Indicators with \nTargets and Baselines \n\nData Sources and \nReporting  \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \nCapacity of the elderly \ncare system and quality \nof elderly care services \nin Hebei improved \n\n \na\u2013c.
