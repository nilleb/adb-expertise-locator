Ltd.  (BOCFL)  for  the  New \nEnergy Bus Leasing Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \n \n2. \nThe project entails the Asian Development Bank (ADB) providing long-term financing (with  \na tenor of up to 7 years) to BOCFL to fund the lease or purchase of new energy buses (NEBs), \nwhich are needed to reduce the climate impact of urbanization and develop public transport in a \nsustainable manner.1 ADB\u2019s financing will facilitate the company\u2019s provision of long tenor lease \nfinance to NEB operators to enable them to manage the affordability of these large assets. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nEconomic  overview.  The  PRC  has  experienced  strong  economic  growth  since  1980. \nGross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 9.7% and per capita income increased by 8.6% \nper  year  during  1980\u20132014.2 The  PRC  economy  is  transitioning  to  a  more  sustainable  growth \npath, with reforms undertaken in many areas. The real GDP growth rate slowed to 6.8% in 2017 \nand 6.6% in 2018. ADB estimates that GDP growth will be 6.2% in 2019 and 6.0% in 2020.3 The \nInternational Monetary Fund projects a gradual slowdown in growth  from the current level to a \nreal GDP growth rate of 5.6% in 2023.4  \n \n4. \nTransport  sector  overview.  Rapid  economic  growth  has  contributed  significantly  to \nimprovements  in  human  well-being  and  quality  of  life,  but  has  also  created  serious  social  and \nenvironmental  challenges  that  constrain  inclusive  and  sustainable  development.  Massive \nurbanization has led to a substantial increase in the production and use of motor vehicles in the \nPRC,  which  has  become  the  largest  producer  and  consumer  of  automobiles  globally.  Annual \nproduction  capacity  reached  27.81  million  vehicles  in  2018,  with  sales  of  28.08  million  units.5 \nThere were over 310 million motor vehicles in the PRC by the end of 2017, including 170 million \nprivate cars.6 Despite some socioeconomic benefits, the extensive use of private cars in cities is \ncausing  congestion,  air  and  noise  pollution,  and  road  accidents.  Rapid  motorization  and  the \ncountry\u2019s moderate success in controlling emissions from industrial and energy sources has made \nthe PRC\u2019s urban transport sector the fastest growing source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. \nAccording  to  the  China  Vehicle  Environmental  Management  Annual  Report  2018,  transport \nemissions are a major contributor of fine atmospheric particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers \nin  diameter  (PM2.5)  in  some  urban  areas  (45%  in  Beijing,  29%  in  Shanghai,  and  52%  in \n\n \n\n1  New energy buses (NEBs) refer to buses running on \u201cnew energy\u201d as defined by the Government of the PRC. Most \nbuses financed by the project are expected to be electric buses with zero direct emissions. Any plug-in hybrid buses \nfinanced will meet emission standards of at least Euro V equivalent (Euro V is an European emission standard that \ndefines the acceptable limits for exhaust emissions of vehicles). Subject to market demand, buses running on fuel \ncells may also be financed. All NEBs will have inclusive design with priority seating for vulnerable groups. \n\n2  ADB.  2016.

Congestion and air pollution can be alleviated by encouraging urban residents to \nshift  from  using  private cars  to  public  transportation  and  by  using  public  vehicles  with  cleaner \ntechnology.  This  would  reduce  GHG  emissions  that  contribute  to  global  climate  change  while \nimproving inner city air quality. The development of public transport will also benefit directly lower \nincome people; groups with reduced mobility (e.g., the elderly and persons with disabilities); and \nwomen,  who  accounted  for  less than  30%  of  all  car  owners  in the  PRC  in  2018.  In  2016,  the \nMinistry  of  Transport  issued  a  policy  guideline  to  improve  the  quality  of  public  transport  by \nenhancing the speed, convenience, comfort, and security of public transport services.8 In 2015, a \njoint report of the World Bank and Development Research Center of China\u2019s State Council called \nfor a new model of urbanization that would reduce growth in private car use and promote a shift \nto public transport.9 \n \n5. \nLeasing sector overview. Leasing provides a good solution for long-term bus financing, \nas banks usually do not accept buses as collateral. The PRC\u2019s leasing industry has been growing \nrapidly, targeting this financing gap that traditional bank financing typically does not address. New \nleasing  sales  in  the  PRC  expanded  from  $21.88  billion  in  2008  to  $265.68  billion  in  2017, \nrepresenting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 31.97%.10 Despite rapid recent growth, \nthe PRC\u2019s financial leasing industry still needs further development. The lease penetration rate, \nmeasured as a percentage of lease finance to total GDP, was 2.21% in 2017, 12th among 50 \ncountries, indicating ample room for future growth.11 The leasing industry, with total outstanding \nlease receivables of CNY6.55 trillion, is also much smaller than the banking industry, which had \ntotal outstanding loans of CNY108.56 trillion as of September 2018. \n \nRationale.  ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  operations  projects  in  the  PRC\u2019s  finance  sector  have \n6. \nactively supported nonbank financial institutions to target sectors not traditionally a focus of banks.  \nTo date, this includes smaller transactions for microfinance companies and larger debt lines for \nleasing  companies,  targeting  diverse  subsectors  and  focusing  on  underdeveloped  segments, \nincluding  green  buses. ADB  approved  a $275 million  loan  program  for the  Clean Bus  Leasing \nProject and fully disbursed the loans in 2016.12 The Global Environmental Facility funded $2.315 \nmillion in technical assistance (TA) to maximize service performance of the bus fleets.13 In 2017, \nADB approved a loan of $400 million to Minsheng Financial Leasing to support green transport \nfinance.14 Based on the uptake of the previous projects and to continue to support much-needed \ngreen transport alternatives in the PRC, ADB identified BOCFL as a good partner to implement \nthis  project.  BOCFL  has  substantial  experience  in  financing  green  buses  and  has  close \n\nAnnual Report 2018. Beijing. \n\n \n\n7  Government of the PRC, Ministry of Ecology and Environment. 2018.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to Minsheng \nFinancial Leasing Co. Ltd. for the Green Transport Finance Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila. The \nloan comprised an A loan of up to $200 million and a B loan of up to $200 million. The A loan was fully disbursed in \n2018 and the B loan syndication is still in process. \n\n\f3 \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\nrelationships with electric bus manufacturers and bus operators in the PRC. BOCFL has strong \nshareholders, sound corporate governance, an experienced management team, advanced risk \nmanagement  systems,  and  good  financial  performance.  As  a  non-deposit-taking  financial \ninstitution, BOCFL has maturity mismatches between its assets and liabilities and, therefore, has \nan ongoing need to raise longer-tenor financing to expand its green bus leasing business (with \ntypical lease terms of 5\u201310 years). \n \n7. \nThe design of the transaction builds on the lessons of previous ADB support for green bus \nfinance in the PRC. ADB\u2019s ex post evaluation gave a less than satisfactory rating to the earlier \nloan program for the Clean Bus Leasing Project primarily due to the applied definition of a clean \nbus, which was considered to be  overly broad.15 The  proposed project will  only finance  NEBs, \nwhich have zero or very low direct emissions. Unlike earlier projects, it will not finance clean diesel \nbuses  or  compressed  natural  gas  and  liquefied  natural  gas  buses.  The  current  project  also \nincorporates gender elements in the project design. Additionally, the project will benefit from the \nearlier  TA  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  bus  operators  by  providing  knowledge  products  and \ntraining materials to bus operators.16 \n \nB. \n \n8. \nBOCFL was established in December 2007. As of December 2018, it was the third-largest \nfinancial leasing company (FLC) in the PRC with total assets of CNY231.74 billion. In line with \nthe  leasing  sector,  BOCFL  has  experienced  rapid  growth  in total  assets  with  a  CAGR  of  40% \nduring 2008\u20132018. BOCFL expects its lease portfolio growth to moderate to the range of 5%\u2013\n10% per annum over the period 2020\u20132025. BOCFL is rated A2 by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, A \nby Fitch Ratings, and A- by S&P Global Ratings. \n \n9. \nBOCFL\u2019s  operations  cover  three  business  segments  comprising  aviation  (30.9%  of  the \ntotal lease portfolio at 30 June 2019), shipping (28.7%), and infrastructure and other businesses \n(40.4%). The company has significantly increased the share of its leasing operations that focus \non the transport sector (aviation, shipping, and public transport); the lease portfolio in aviation and \nshipping  grew  from  21.9%  in  2014  to  59.6%  as  of  30  June  2019,  driven  by  rapid  growth  of \noperating  lease  assets  in  these  two  segments.17 CONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION  DELETED. \nPublic  transport  leasing  is  within  the  infrastructure  and  other  business  segment,  which  also \nincludes  energy,  water  supply,  gas  supply,  wastewater  treatment,  culture  and  tourism,  and \nmanufacturing. Most of the company\u2019s public transport leasing clients are local public transport \noperators owned by municipalities, and the lease assets include buses as well as rolling stock \nand other equipment of metro and light rail. The company has focused its bus leasing operations \non green buses since 2012. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nC. \n \n10. \nOwnership.

Performance Evaluation Report. PRC: Loan Program for Clean Bus Leasing (Far East Horizon Limited). Manila. \n16 The $2.315 million TA was financed by the Global Environment Facility, with the PRC\u2019s Ministry of Transport as the \nexecuting agency (footnote 13). The knowledge products include (i) an evaluation report to help bus operators select \nthe most appropriate green buses by offering operational, financial, and environmental performance benchmarks for \nvarious  technology;  (ii)  a  guidance  book  on  scheduling  and  dispatching;  and  (iii)  guidelines  on  improving  bus \nmaintenance management, with  a systematic framework and practical procedures to help bus operators improve \ngreen bus operational efficiency. \n\n17 By 30 June 2019, over 90% of the aviation portfolio was operating lease assets and over 70% of the shipping portfolio \n\nwas operating lease assets. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nBOCOM\u2019s  businesses  include  commercial  banking,  securities,  trust,  financial  leasing,  fund \nmanagement,  and  insurance.  As  of  30  June  2019,  BOCOM  had  total  assets  of  CNY9,886.61 \nbillion (fifth among all commercial banks in the PRC), with total net income of CNY42.75 billion in \nthe first half of 2019. BOCOM is rated A2 by Moody\u2019s  Investors Service, A by Fitch Ratings, and \nA- by S&P Global Ratings. It has been listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange since 2015 and \non  the  Shanghai  Stock  Exchange  since  2017.  The  largest  ultimate  beneficial  owner  is  the \nGovernment  of  the  PRC,  with  a  total  shareholding  of  over  40%  through  various  state-owned \nenterprises.  The  Hongkong  and  Shanghai  Banking  Corporation  Limited  (HSBC)  is  the  second \nlargest shareholder with an 18.70% of stake as of 30 June 2019. No other shareholders directly \nor indirectly hold more than a 5% stake in BOCOM. Integrity due diligence was conducted, and \nno  significant  or  potentially  significant  integrity  risks  were  identified. 18  Although  the  ultimate \nbeneficial owners of BOCFL could not be identified, the potential risk is mitigated by the fact that \nthe relevant shares of BOCOM are held by the public and institutional investors, and no indirect \nshareholder other than the government and HSBC, which is also a listed entity, holds more than \na 5% indirect stake in BOCFL. ADB\u2019s review of the entity does not give ADB cause to believe that \nit is being used for money laundering or terrorism financing. Tax integrity due diligence was not \nrequired.19 \n \n11.  Management.  BOCFL  is  led  by  an  experienced  management  team,  comprised  of  the \npresident and three vice presidents, all of whom previously held senior positions at BOCOM. The \npresident,  Zhu  Yequn,  joined  BOCFL  since  its  establishment.  His  prior  positions  included  vice \npresident of BOCFL, director of the credit monitoring department of BOCOM, and director of the \nasset management department of BOCOM.20 \n \nGovernance structure. BOCFL has a well defined corporate governance structure. The \n12. \nboard of directors is responsible for the company\u2019s overall strategy, major decisions, important \ninternal  policies,  key  business  objectives,  and  senior  management  appointments.  Because \nBOCFL  is  a  wholly  owned subsidiary  of  BOCOM,  all  directors  are  appointed  by BOCOM.  The \nboard consists of six members, all of whom have extensive banking and finance experience. The \nchairperson, Zhao Jiong, previously served as the chairperson and chief executive officer of Bank \nof Communications International Trust Co. Ltd. (footnote 20). The board has three committees: a \nrisk  management  and  related-party  transactions  committee,  budget  and  audit  committee,  and \nremuneration and nomination committee. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \nADB will provide an A loan of up to $100 million with a tenor of up to 7 years.

BOCFL will use the proceeds of the proposed loan to fund the lease or \npurchase  of  NEBs  (footnote  1).  All  NEBs  will  have  inclusive  designs,  with  priority  seating  for \nvulnerable and priority needs groups such as pregnant women, the elderly, or the disabled. \n \n15. \nReporting arrangements. Monitoring of the project will be carried out by ADB over the \nlife  of  the  project.  BOCFL  will  provide  ADB  with  financial  and  other  reports  at  predetermined \nregular  intervals  and  as  requested.  These  reports  will  include  unaudited  semiannual  financial \nstatements, audited annual financial statements, compliance certificates for financial covenants, \nperiodic  reports  on  the  underlying  leases  financed  by  BOCFL  through  the  proposed  loan,  and \nannual reporting on selected development indicators agreed by ADB and the borrower. \n \nC. \n \n16. \nProviding  critically  needed  long-term  finance.  The  PRC\u2019s  leasing  sector  is  still \ndeveloping.  Most  funding  is  available  to  companies  on  a  1-year  tenor  basis.  BOCFL  has \nsignificant  maturity mismatch  between  its assets and liabilities  (para 16), although it  has  been \nable to raise some medium-term funding in the markets on a sporadic basis. Long-tenor funding \nof  7  years  from  ADB,  as  the  first  development  finance  institution  lender  to  BOCFL,  will  help \nsupport  the  company  to  provide  longer-tenor  financing  for  NEBs  and  improve  its  asset-liability \nprofile. This will in turn increase the company\u2019s capacity to expand its operations and address its \nfunding gap. \n \nCatalyzing  private  sector  funding  and  support.  ADB  is  expected  to  mobilize  a \n17. \nsubstantial  amount  of  private  sector  funding  for  this  project  under  a  B  loan  structure  and  risk \ntransfers. A mandate letter for the proposed loan facility including the B loan has been signed. \nADB is targeting some banks that do not have an existing relationship with BOCFL. Overall, this \nwill help further diversify BOCFL\u2019s long-term funding base. \n \n18. \nIncorporating  gender  elements.  ADB  has  worked  with  BOCFL  to  incorporate  gender \nelements  in  the  project  design.  At  the  subproject  level,  all  NEBs  financed  by  ADB  will  have \ninclusive  designs,  with  priority  seats  for  pregnant  women  and  vulnerable groups.  BOCFL  also \ncommits  to  promoting  gender  equality  at  the  company  level  by  improving  training  and  career \ndevelopment for female staff. \n \n CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nImpacts. The project is aligned with the following strong development impacts: \n(i) \n\nGreen transport scaled-up in the People\u2019s Republic of China, including the \nexpansion  of  new  energy  bus  services  as  an  environment-friendly  and \ninclusive  transport  mode. 21 By  financing  the  lease  of  NEBs,  the  project  will \nsupport  the  expanded  use  of  low  emission  vehicles  in  public  transport.

The  use  of  high-quality  buses  that  are  quiet,  clean,  and \ncomfortable will also encourage a modal shift from private passenger vehicles to \npublic  transport.  Overall,  the  large-scale  deployment  of  NEBs  will  improve  air \nquality and reduce GHG emissions, leading to significant beneficial environment \nand  climate  impact.  The  expansion  of  environment-friendly  NEB  services  is \nexpected to particularly benefit low-income commuters and other disadvantaged \ngroups with less access to private cars. \n \nFinancial  leasing  industry  developed.22 Despite  rapid  growth  since  2008,  the \nPRC\u2019s financial leasing industry is still underdeveloped, with a lease penetration \nrate that is below other developed markets. Access to finance remains a challenge \nfor most leasing companies, particularly for long-tenor loans, and the project will \ncontribute to the alleviation of this funding bottleneck.  \n\n(ii) \n\nOutputs.  The  outputs  will  be  BOCFL\u2019s  leasing  operations  for  NEBs  expanded  and \n\n \nOutcome. The project will have the following outcome: deployment of NEBs in the urban, \n20. \nsuburban, and intercity public transport markets increased. The project is expected to finance the \nlease  of  about  XX  NEBs  by  2021.  From  2021,  the  project  will  help  avoid  XX  tons  of  GHG \nemissions per year through a shift from the use of private cars to the use of public transport using \nlow-emission buses.23 The project will result in XX million vehicle-kilometers of service operation \nby NEBs per year in the PRC.24 \n \n21. \nBOCFL\u2019s gender inclusiveness for human resources and NEB leasing operations improved. \n \nB. \n \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  project  supports  four \n22. \nStrategy 2030 operational priorities: (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; \n(ii)  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality;  (iii)  tackling  climate  change,  building  climate  and \ndisaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability;  and  (iv)  making  cities  more \nlivable.25 Under Strategy 2030, ADB will increase its emphasis on mitigating GHG emissions in \nline with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. By financing NEBs, the project will help to promote \nsustainable  low-carbon  transport  in  the  PRC  and  reduce  GHG  emissions.  The  project  also \ncontributes to supporting mass public transport, which particularly benefits low-income people; it \nwill help improve mobility of the elderly, persons with disabilities, and women, thereby creating a \nsafe and healthy urban environment that improves the quality of life for all residents.

The  overall  private  vehicle  displacement  rate  is  estimated  to  be  5.2%, \nleading to GHG savings of 574 kilograms carbon dioxide equivalent per NEB per day. Most (90%) of NEBs financed \nunder the project are assumed to be pure electric buses, with 10% plug-in hybrids. Using a well-to-wheel approach, \nwhich  takes  into  account  emissions  from  extractive  and  processing  activities  for  fossil  fuels  as  well  as  electricity \ngeneration, the GHG savings from energy consumption is estimated to be 78 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent \nper electric bus per day. Considering the impacts from the fuel switch and private vehicle displacement, the use of \neach  NEB  is  estimated  to  avoid  0.65  tons  of  GHG  emissions  per  day  on  average.  It  is  assumed  that  each  bus \noperates 325 days per year. \n\n24 Assuming an average speed of 20 kilometers per hour, 14 operating hours per day, and 325 operating days per year. \n25 ADB.  2018.

The  project  fully \nsupports ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative, which focuses on creating transport systems that \nare  accessible,  safe,  affordable,  and environment-friendly.  The  Sustainable Transport Initiative \nOperational Plan states that ADB should help its developing member countries overcome sector \nobstacles through the wider adoption of sustainable transport, and identifies urban transport as \nan  area  in  which  ADB  should  scale  up  support  for  sustainability. 27  The  operational  plan \nemphasizes private sector participation and mobilization of additional finance. The project also \nfully  aligns  with  the  multilateral  development  banks\u2019  Rio+20  (United  Nations  Conference  on \nSustainable  Development)  commitment  to  provide  $175  billion  for  transport  in  developing \ncountries  during  2012\u20132022.  Supporting  finance  sector  development  is  a  key  focus  of \ndevelopment assistance for ADB, and the project aligns with ADB\u2019s Financial Sector Operational \nPlan.28 The project builds on previous ADB support for green transport and the leasing industry \nin the PRC. \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \n\n \nA. \n \n24. \nStatement (2009).29 \n \n25. \nEnvironmental and social safeguards.
