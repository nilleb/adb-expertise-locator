The  Project  will  have  four  components:  (i)  establish \noperational school clusters as a network that covers all schools in \nUzbekistan, and equip 860 cluster leader schools (CLSs) with ICT \nfacilities  and  internet/intranet  connectivity  (the  CLSs  will  provide \nessential pedagogical and technical support for effective ICT use \nin other schools in the clusters, including those in poor, rural, and \nremote areas); (ii) train staff for effective ICT use in schools, and \nimprove the existing in-service teacher training system to make it \nmore  flexible  and  effective  for  training  for  ICT  use  across  the \ncurriculum;  (iii)  develop  learning  materials  for  ICT  use;  and  (iv) \nprovide advisory services on technical, financial, and fiscal issues \nthe \nto \nGovernment\u2019s  ICT  in  basic  education  policy,  and  pilot  test \napproaches designed to enhance project sustainability and future \nICT development with a pro-poor focus. \n \nIn  recognition  of  the  potential  gains offered  by  ICT  to  (i)  improve \nthe quality of education, (ii) strengthen the relevance of education \nto an increasingly information- and knowledge-based society and \nchanging  labor  market  needs,  and  (iii)  improve  access  to \neducation for children from poor families and in remote areas, the \nGovernment prepared a national strategy for ICT development in \n2002.  The  strategy  provides  a  general  framework  and  identifies \nbasic  education  as  a  priority  sector  for  implementation.  In \naccordance  with  this  strategy,  and  within  the  framework  of  the \nNational  Program  for  Basic  Education  Development  approved  in \n2004,  the  Government  has  launched  an  ambitious  program  to \nintegrate  ICT  in  schools  nationwide.  The  Government  considers \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assistance  as  essential  in \nimplementing  its  ICT  in  basic  education  program.  ADB  has \nassisted  the  Government  in  preparing  a  national  strategy  for \nintegrating ICT in schools, to which the Project is anchored.  \n \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nThe impact of the Project is the improved quality and relevance of, \nand equitable access to basic education for all students, including \nstudents in poor and remote areas. The outcome of the Project is \nthe improvement of learning outcomes through ICT use in priority \nsubject  areas  in  grades  5\u20139  in  project  schools  with  a  pro-poor \nfocus.  The  priority  subject  areas  are  mathematics,  sciences, \nhistory, and languages, in addition to informatics. \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $43.0  million \nequivalent,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies,  taxes  and \nduties,  and  interest  and  other  charges.  Of  the  total  cost,  $26.1 \nmillion  (61%)  comprises  the  foreign  exchange  cost,  and  16.9 \nmillion equivalent (39%) the local currency cost.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     ($ million equivalent) \n\n \nSource \nAsian Development Bank \n\nGovernment \n          Total \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n25.1 \n\n1.0 \n26.1 \n\n4.9 \n\n12.0 \n16.9 \n\nTotal \nCost \n30.0 \n\n13.0 \n43.0 \n\n \nPercent \n70\n\n30\n100\n\n Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation  \nArrangements  \n\nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights \n20,408,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will be provided. \nThe  loan  will  have  a  32-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  8 \nyears,  with  an  interest  rate  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter.  \n \nUntil 30 June  2011 \n \n \n31 December 2010  \n \nThe  Project  will  integrate  its  management  with  that  of  ongoing \nprojects  in  basic  education  to  reduce  transaction  costs  and \nmaximize  economic  efficiency \nIn \nparticular, the project steering committee (PSC) will be integrated \nwith the PSCs for the two ongoing ADB projects with the Ministry \nof  Public  Education  (MOPE):  the  Education  Sector  Development \nProgram (ESDP), and the Second Textbook Development Project \n(STDP). Members of the existing PSCs include representatives of \nthe  Cabinet  of  Ministers,  MOPE,  and  Ministry  of  Finance. \nParticipation  may  be  adjusted  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  Project. \nThe PSC will also consider appointing the project director for the \nESDP  and  STDP  as  the  project  director  for  the  Project.  Given \nMOPE\u2019s  experience  with  ADB  project \nimplementation, \naccumulated since 1998, and the recent successful completion of \nthe  Basic  Education  Textbook  Development  Project,  financial \nfor \nmanagement  arrangements  of  MOPE  are  satisfactory \npurposes of implementation of the Project.  \n\nimplementation. \n\nin  project \n\n\f \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \n\nv\n\nto \n\nrelated \n\nThe project implementation unit (PIU) will be responsible for day-\nto-day  management  of  the  Project  including  procurement  and \nrecruitment;  staff  development; \nfinance  and  accounting; \nmonitoring  and  evaluation;  and  preparation  of  detailed  project \nimplementation  plans  and  annual  and  quarterly  progress  reports \nfor submission to the PSC, the project director, and ADB. The PIU \nwill  have  6\u20138  full-time  staff  with  expertise  in  these  areas.  To \nensure  timely  start-up  of  project  implementation,  MOPE  will \nappoint a project manager, who will be responsible for day-to-day \ncoordination  of  project  activities.  The  PIU  will  be  established  in \naccordance  with  a  government  decision \nthe \nestablishment and financing of this PIU, which will be covered by \nretroactive financing (para. 57). The PIU will be established in the \nsame premises as the ESDP and STDP PIUs, and will coordinate \nclosely  with  them  across  PIU  functions,  including  sharing  of  staff \nwhere feasible. Eventual consideration will be given to measures \nto further harmonize project management. \n \nMinistry of Public Education  \n \nThe  Project  will  procure  (i)  standard  packages  of  ICT  hardware \nand peripherals, and related furniture and other equipment for 860 \nCLSs;  (ii)  non-personal-computer-based  learning  materials  and \nequipment  including  audiovisual  sets;  and  (iii)  furniture  and \ncomputers  for  office  and  administrative  use.  ADB  loan-financed \ngoods  and  services  will  be  procured  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines \nfor  Procurement.  Procurement  of  largest  value  will  be  for  ICT \nhardware,  which  may  be  broken  into  several  packages  each \nlarger  than  $1  million  to  allow  proper  sequencing  of  ICT \ninstallation  in  schools.  Goods  and  services  will  be  procured  by \ninternational competitive bidding where the cost is valued at more \nthan $1 million equivalent, or by international shopping where the \ncost  is  valued  from  $100,000  to  $1  million  equivalent.  Direct \npurchase may be applicable for goods and services valued at less \nthan  $100,000  equivalent.  Procurement  of  furniture  and  the \ndevelopment of software and e-materials valued at less than $0.5 \nlocal  competitive  bidding \nfollow \nmillion  per  contract  may \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. The Government will finance and \nundertake  necessary  civil  works,  in  particular  to  rehabilitate  and \nupgrade  computer  classrooms.  Minimum  criteria  to  be  met  by  a \nschool prior to installation of ICT equipment have been agreed.  \n \nThe Project will require 212 person-months of consulting services, \nconsisting  of  52.5  person-months  of  international  and  159.5 \nperson-months  of  domestic  consulting.  Areas  of  expertise \nrequired  include  education  reform  and  decentralization,  software \ndevelopment, \ntraining,  continuous \nin  basic  education, \nprofessional  development  (CPD),  school  networking,  and  pilot \nproject  design  and  evaluation.  International  consultants  will  be \nengaged  through  a  firm  in  association  with  domestic  consultants \nusing quality and cost-based selection with full technical proposals \n\nICT \n\n \n\n\f \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nvi \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\ntraining \n\nteaching \n\nthe  CLSs \n\ninstitutions  and \n\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants. \nPIU  staff  will  be  recruited  separately  using  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB.   \n                  \nThe direct benefit of applying ICT across the curriculum will be a \nfundamental  shift  to  student-centered  learning  and  teaching \nmethodologies. This will lead to improved student performance in \npriority  subject  areas,  and  enhanced  skills  and  competencies  as \nopposed  to  the  accumulation  of  factual  knowledge.  ICT  use  will \nmotivate  students  and  teachers  by  making  education  more \nrelevant.  These  combined  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the \noverall  system  to  produce  graduates  with  the  ability  to  meet \nworking  life  challenges  in  the  21st  century  with  increasingly \nadvanced  skills  in  information  access,  management,  processing, \nand usage. The Project will significantly improve the effectiveness \nof  the  CPD  system  for  teachers.  The  establishment  of  school \nclusters  and  the  close  working  conditions  required  between  the \nexisting \nto  be \nestablished under the Project will make the content of CPD more \nrelevant  and  its  delivery  more  effective.  The  Project  will  also  lay \nthe foundation for the planned second phase of ICT development \nafter 2010.  \n \nThe Project will directly benefit 540,000 students in grades 5\u20139 in \nthe  860  CLSs  through  the  improved  learning  and  teaching \nconditions  resulting  from  the  provision  and  application  of  ICT  in \nclassrooms. Direct beneficiaries will also include 7,740 teachers in \nCLSs,  63,200 \nin  non-CLSs,  1,720  CLS  school \nmanagement  staff,  17,800  management  staff  in  non-CLSs,  220 \nteacher  trainers,  and  600  local  language  e-materials  developers, \nwhose  skills  will  be  improved  by  the  targeted  training  under  the \nProject. Given the proposed central role of the CLSs in the school \nsystem,  all  students  and  teachers  in  the  basic  education  system \nwill  benefit  from  the  Project.  This  will  amount  to  about  6  million \nstudents and 200,000 teachers during 2006\u20132010. Finally, over 1 \nmillion  households  are  estimated  to  be  able  to  benefit  from  ICT \nuse  when  schools  open  their  ICT  facilities  to  access  in  their \ncommunities.  The  Project  will  benefit  the  poor  disproportionately \nas  about  70%  of  CLSs  are  in  poor,  rural,  and  remote  areas;  the \nProject  will  provide  the  disadvantaged  with  equitable  access  to \ninformation  from  the  internet/intranet  as  well  as  pedagogical  and \ntechnical support for effective ICT use.  \n \nThe  Project  faces  three  major  types  of  risks.  The  first  are  risks \nrelated  to  adoption  of  new  technology.  Using  ICT  in  schools  is \nnew;  over  50%  of  schools  have  never  had  access  to  computers. \nThe  risks  of  inadequate  and  inappropriate  use  of  ICT  as  well  as \nmismanagement  of  the facilities will  be  high. These risks  will be \n \n\nteachers \n\n\f \n\nvii\n\ninternet/intranet \n\nconnectivity,  and \n\nmitigated  by  extensive  capacity  building  for  teachers  and  school \nmanagement  to  ensure  intended  use  and  impact  of  ICT  in \nschools.   \n \nThe second are infrastructure and logistical risks. For the effective \nuse  of  ICT  in  schools,  the  Project  will  require  a  number  of  basic \ninfrastructure  and  logistical  conditions  to  be  met,  including \nappropriate classroom facilities with security arrangements, power \nservices  and \nsupply, \nmaintenance. These concerns are addressed through covenanted \nassurances.  \n \nThe  third  are  financial  sustainability  risks.  Throughout  the  design \nof  the  Project,  the  financial  implications  of  the  integration  of  ICT \nhave  been  carefully  reviewed  and  extensive  consultations  held \nwith \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s  plans  for  integrating  ICT  in  basic  education  are \nfinancially  sustainable.  The  Project  addresses  these  concerns \nthrough (i) covenants on adequate and timely budget provision for \noperation and maintenance and replacement costs; (ii) piloting of \nlow  cost  hardware  configurations;  and  (iii)  a  strong  focus  on \nfinancial  sustainability  during  project  reviews, \nthe \nmidterm review.  \n \n \n \n \n\nthe  Project  and \n\nthe  Government \n\nto  ensure \n\nincluding \n\nthat \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f60  00'Eo\n\n69  00'Eo\n\nKAZAKHSTAN\n\nUZBEKISTAN\nINFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY IN\nBASIC EDUCATION PROJECT\n\n45  00'No\n\nAral  Sea\n\n45  00'No\n\nMuynak\n\nKungrad\n\nKARAKALPAKSTAN\n\nKhodzheyli\nNukus\n\nA\n\nm\n\nu\n\nd\n\na\n\nr\n\ny\n\na\n\n \n\nR\n\n.\n \n\nUrgench\nKHOREZM\n\nTurtkul\n\nNAVOI\n\nUchkuduk\n\nZarafshan\n\nN\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nKilometers\n\nKAZAKHSTAN\n\nKYRGYZ\nREPUBLIC\n\nChirchik\nTASHKENT\nAngren\n\nTASHKENT\n\nS\n\ny\n\nr\n\nd\n\na\n\nr\n\ny\n\na\n \nR\n.\n\nNamaganh\n\nNAMAGANH\n\nKokand\n\nAndijan\n\nANDIJAN\n\nFergana\n\nGulistan\n\nSYRDARYA\n\nFERGANA\n\nDJIZAK\n\nSukh\n\nJordan\n\n39  00'No\n\nT U R K M E N I S T A N\n\n39  00'No\n\nBUKHARA\n\nNavoi\n\nGazh\n\nBukhara\n\nSAMARKAND\n\nDjizzak\n\nSamarkand\n\nNational Capital\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nMain Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\nKarshi\n\nOklya\n\nKASHKADARYA\n\nDenau\n\nTAJIKISTAN\n\nSURKHANDARYA\n\nTermez\n\n0\n4\n-\n4\n9\n5\n7\n \nH\nR\n\n60  00'Eo\n\nAFGHANISTAN\n\n69  00'Eo\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  for  the  Information  and  Communications  Technology  in  Basic \nEducation Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nAccording to the Constitution of Uzbekistan, all citizens are entitled to basic education. \nProvided by the public sector, basic education starts at age 6/7 and comprises grades 1\u20139 with \nan  additional  2  years  of  high  school  in  grades  10  and  11.  This  11-year  system  is  due  to  be \nphased out by 2010 when it will be replaced by a 12-year system, which will be compulsory. The \n12-year  system  will  provide  3  years  of  senior  secondary  education  after  grade  9  either  in \nacademic  lyceums  or  in  technically  and  vocationally  oriented  professional  colleges.  The \nrestructuring of basic and senior secondary education has been a focus of sector reforms since \n1997. Higher education consists of a 4-year first degree program followed by a 2-year masters \nprogram and then a doctoral program. Information on the basic education system is in Appendix \n2.  \n \n3. \nIn  2003/04  about  6.1  million  students  were  enrolled  in  basic  education.  With  a  net \nenrolment  rate  estimated  at  over  98%  and  no  significant  gender  differentials  in  primary \neducation,  Uzbekistan  scores  high  on  the  two  Millennium  Development  Goals  relevant  to \neducation.  However,  the  level  of  attendance  is  reported  to  be  a  problem  especially  in  poor \nregions, although reliable data is not available. The primary completion rate is estimated to be \nclose to 100%. Over the next 5 years basic education enrolment is expected to decrease due to \n(i)  the  transfer  of  approximately  600,000  grade  10  and  11  students  to  senior  secondary \neducation  as  the  system  moves  to  a  12-year  system;  and  (ii)  a  decline  in  new  enrolments  in \ngrade 1 of approximately 10,000\u201320,000 students per year resulting from falling birth rates and \nan  aging  population.  Enrolments  are  expected  to  stabilize  in  2010  at  around  5.3  million  in \ngrades  1\u20139.  In  2004,  20.7%  of  the  9,757  general  secondary  schools  were  located  in  urban \nareas. Approximately 40% of basic education enrolments are in grades 1\u20134.  \n \n4. \nPublic  expenditure  for  education  as  a  high  priority  sector  has  increased  in  real  terms \nevery year since 2000, and stood at 9.5% of gross domestic product in 2005. The share of basic \neducation  in  total  education  expenditure  has  gone  up  from  45.5%  to  50.3%  over  the  past  5 \nyears,  and  is  expected  to  rise  further.  Since  2004  the  Government  has  accelerated  efforts  to \nrefocus  on  basic  education  and  to  remedy  many  years  of  underfunding  of  the  subsector.  The \nNational Program for Basic Education Development 2004\u20132009 was launched in 2004 with the \nkey objective to urgently rehabilitate and upgrade the basic education system especially in rural \nareas,  including  physical  plants,  learning  and  teaching  materials,  computers,  laboratory  and \nsports equipment, and curriculum reform.  \n \nAccording  to  the  national  strategy  for  ICT  development  introduced  in  2002,  basic \n5. \neducation is a priority area for the development of information and communications technology \n(ICT).1  In  2004  only  18%  of  general  secondary  schools  had  access  to  modern  personal \ncomputers and just 50% of schools had access to any form of computers including those made \n\n                                                 \n1   Cabinet  of  Ministers,  Uzbekistan.  Resolution  30  May  2002.  On  Further  Development  of  Computerization  and \n\nIntroduction of Information and Communication Technologies.  \n\n\f2 \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nin  the  Soviet  era.  Within  the  framework  of  the  National  Program  for  Basic  Education \nDevelopment, the Government has launched a program to integrate ICT in basic education, with \nthe provision of a 14+1 computer suite2 to every school in the country by 2009 and of internet \nconnectivity to 35% of schools.  \n \nB. \n \n6. \nIntegrating  ICT  in  basic  education  is  an  integral  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  long-term \nstrategic  objective  of  transforming  the  education  system  into  one  consistent  with  a  market-\nbased  economy  in  the  21st  century.  While  ICT  promises  substantial  potential  gains,  a \ndiscussion of a number of key challenges follows.  \n \n\n1. \n\nBenefits of ICT Development in Basic Education   \n\n \n7. \nTo meet the needs of the 21st century, which is increasingly knowledge and information \nbased,  basic  education  must  produce  graduates  who  can  learn  quickly  and  independently  to \nensure  that  the  future  workforce  is  sufficiently  flexible  to  be  able  to  apply  old  skills  in  new \nsituations,  and  to  acquire  new  skills  and  knowledge  quickly  when  needed.  Integrating  ICT  in \nschools will help to achieve this fundamental educational objective in the following five areas.  \n  \nEnsuring Computer Competence as an Essential Basic Skill. ICT capability involves \n8. \ntechnical  and  cognitive  proficiency  to  access,  use,  develop,  create,  and  communicate \ninformation  appropriately  using  ICT  tools.  Improved  computer  skills  with  basic  ICT  tools  (word \nprocessing,  spreadsheets,  databases,  presentation  software,  and  other  applications)  increase \nstudent  productivity;  ICT  skills  are  becoming  a  universal  basic  requirement.  Currently,  such \nskills  are  not  learned  in schools,  as more  than  half  of  students  have  no  excess  to computers, \nand for those who do, computers are used only for theoretical informatics.  \n \nPromoting  Student-Centered  Learning  to  Improve  Learner  Engagement  and \n9. \nMotivation. ICT will support the change to student-centered learning, which is at the center of \nongoing  reforms  in  basic  education.  Despite  years  of  efforts,  didactic  teaching  methodologies \nand  teacher-directed  classrooms  still  dominate.  A  key  advantage  of  ICT  is  to  give  students\u2014\ntraditionally  on  the  passive  receiving  end\u2014access  to  an  effective  means  of  acquiring, \nprocessing,  and  applying  knowledge  and  information.  Students  enjoy  using  ICT  because  it \nprovides  alternative  and  user-friendly  approaches  to  learning  and  the  chance  to  develop  the \nskills  needed  for  the  future.  ICT  facilitates  students  learning  in  groups,  working  with  other \nlearners,  being  creative,  learning  through  challenging  game-like  activities,  and  setting  clear \npersonal  learning  goals.  ICT  use  also  stimulates  increased  teacher-student  interaction.  As \nstudents  develop  skills,  they  become  more  engaged  with  their  own  learning  and  thus  more \nmotivated. With ICT the curriculum can be tailored to a student\u2019s individual learning needs and \ncan be readily adapted to meet the needs of students with learning or physical disabilities.  \n \n10. \nDeveloping  Higher  Order  Thinking  Skills  and  Independent  Learning  Skills.  ICT \nhelps students to discriminate in their use of information and ICT tools, and to be appreciative \nand  understanding  of  the  role  of  ICT  in  learning.  ICT  allows  students  to  investigate  the  real \nworld  more  thoroughly,  using  up-to-date  information  and  tools  to  build  a  broader  and  deeper \nknowledge  base,  and  at  the  same  time  requires  from  learners  higher  levels  of  thinking  and \n\n                                                 \n2   This  will  give  a  computer  student  ratio  of  1:42  on  the  current  enrolment  of  6.1  million.  According  to  a  Cabinet  of \nMinisters\u2019  decree  dated  21  October  2004,  the  Government  plans  to  supply  computers  to  about  8,700  schools \nduring 2005\u20132009, with the total number of computers supplied ranging from 100,000 to 140,000.  \n\n\fproblem  solving.  ICT  tools  can  be  used  to  support  application,  analysis,  synthesis,  and \nassessment  of  progress.  As  students  develop  their  own  independent  learning  styles,  they \nunderstand  how  they  learn  best  and  are  well-prepared  to  become  lifelong  learners.  They  can \nseek  information  quickly  and  efficiently,  and  apply  it  in  ways  that  are  suitable  to  each  new \nlearning and employment context. \n \n11. \nEnhancing  Educational  Attainment.  With  ICT,  learners  demonstrate  improved  skills \nand  understanding  by  applying  technology  purposefully  to  solve  problems,  analyze  and \nexchange information, develop ideas, create models, and control devices. Evidence shows that \nappropriately  used,  ICT  improves  learning  outcomes  through  enhanced  motivation  from \nstudents and teachers. As appropriate software is developed and applied in more subject areas, \nsuch enhanced attainment will become more widespread. Access to the internet offers sources \nof  e-learning  materials  to  improve  students\u2019  background  knowledge  and  understanding  of \ncurriculum  subjects.  The  effective  implementation  of  an  ICT  strategy  will  provide  a  learning \nmanagement system, which can finely discriminate the nature of students\u2019 learning needs and \nprovide effective learning pathways to meet the needs of students of all abilities.   \n \n12. \nContributing  to  the  Development  of  the  Knowledge  Economy.  ICT  capability  is \nmuch broader than acquiring a set of technical competencies in software applications. The most \nimportant feature in students\u2019 use of ICT is their capacity to understand how the technology can \nsolve  problems  and  enable  them  to  explore  new  dimensions  of  understanding.  Successful \nplayers in the global economy are able to use technology to make productivity gains in existing \nindustries and to maximize return on the new knowledge-based sectors. Over the long term, the \nUzbek  economy  will  increasingly  need  a  highly  educated  and  skilled  workforce  that  can  apply \nICT  to  solve  problems;  model  solutions;  and  implement  strategies  that  are  efficient,  cost-\neffective, and flexible. \n  \n\n2. \n\nKey Issues in ICT Development in Basic Education  \n\n13.  While integrating ICT in learning and teaching promises substantial potential benefits, to \nrealize  these  gains  Uzbekistan  must  overcome  considerable  constraints  over  the  medium  and \nlong term. These constraints are summarized here and discussed in detail in Appendix 3.  \n \n14. \nTeachers and ICT Use. Experience shows that teachers are a key to the success of ICT \nuse  in  schools.  To  date,  a  large  majority  of  general  secondary  teachers  in  Uzbekistan  have \nnever  used  a  computer  for  any  purpose.  This  is  partly  because  of  the  policy  of  computer  use \nonly for the  subject of informatics, and partly due to the lack of computers in schools. To turn \nteachers  into  champions  of  ICT  use  and  a  prime  source  of  support  for  students,  they \nthemselves must first be familiar and comfortable with the technology, and become ICT adept in \ntheir  own  subject  areas.  This  would  require  quality  training  of  most  of  the  450,000  teachers \nwithin  a  relatively  short  time.  The  current  in-service  teacher  training  (INSETT)  system  would \nneed  significant  improvement  to  fulfill  this  task  (A  brief  review  of  the  current  teacher  training \nsystem  and  issues  is  in  Appendix  4).  In  particular,  current  in-service  training  is  inflexible  and \nineffective, and is conducted at regional in-service teacher training institutes (RITTIs) located in \noblast  centers.  Training  is  residential  and  infrequent  with  only  24  days  of  training  for  each \nteacher every 5 years. The system is particularly inconvenient for women, who account for over \n70%  of  the  teaching  force  in  basic  education  and  are  often  unable  to  attend  long  residential \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\ncourses.3 To provide effective support for ICT use, the existing INSETT system will need to be \ntransformed  to  one  that  is  closer  to  teachers,  offers  more  frequent  training  (on  a  weekly  or \nmonthly basis), and acts as a center for interacting networks among teachers and schools. On \nthe  incentive  side,  the  Government  introduced  a  performance-based  remuneration  system  in \n2003,  and  teachers\u2019  salaries  have  increased  substantially.  Qualification  for  ICT  use  in  subject \nareas and general management will need to be incorporated in the incentive system.  \n \n15. \nLearning  Materials  and  ICT  Use.  Appropriate  and  adequate  learning  materials  are  a \nkey  condition  for  successful  application  of  ICT  in  schools.  At  present,  such  materials  are  not \navailable,  and  capacity  is  not  adequate  for  developing  such  materials.  The  Government  has \nmade it a priority to develop e-textbooks. However, considerable efforts are needed to build this \ncapacity,  which  is  basically  nonexistent.  In  developing  these  learning  materials,  wide \nparticipation  must  be  encouraged,  since  this  will  require  new  concepts,  skills,  and  talents  that \nare not traditionally found in education circles. ICT will have a significant impact on the provision \nof  learning  and  teaching  materials  in  other  local  languages  of  instruction  (LOI)  because \ndeveloping  alternative  language  versions  of  materials  in  electronic  form  is  much  easier  and \ncheaper  than  in  print  form.  ICT  will  make  the  provision  of  local  language  materials  more  cost \neffective,  make  materials  more  accessible  to  students  with  other  LOIs,  and  have  a  positive \nimpact on the quality of their learning.  \n \nCurriculum  and  Assessment  System  and  ICT  Use.  Introducing  ICT  in  schools  will \n16. \nhelp  to  accelerate  long  overdue  reforms  in  the  national  curriculum,  state  education  standards, \nand  national  student  assessment  system.  Despite  past  efforts,  the  curriculum  content  has \nremained  overloaded.  This  leaves  little  time  for  interactive  and  student-oriented  teaching \napproaches  and  practices.  While  curriculum  reform  is  a  principal  component  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) supported Second Textbook Development Project (STDP)4 currently \nbeing implemented, ICT provision to schools will give impetus to the reform process, especially \nfrom the students, parents, and teachers, to create more space in the curriculum and syllabus \nfor  the  effective  use  of  ICT.  This  will  complement  the  top-down  approach  used  in  curriculum \nreforms. The current student assessment system is time consuming (often using up to 50% of \nclass time) and disliked widely by teachers and students. Widespread ICT provision will require \nimprovements  to  develop  an  assessment  system  that  is  more  practical  and  appropriate  for  a \nnew curriculum, based on methodologies, criteria, and indicators for measuring and promoting \nmodern learning and its outcomes. \n \n17. \nSchool  E-Readiness  and  ICT  Service  and  Maintenance.  E-readiness  is  about \nmeeting  basic  conditions  that  make  effective  use  of  ICT  in  schools  possible.  Aside  from  ICT-\nqualified teachers, protocols and regulations must be developed and put in place for maintaining \nand  properly  using  ICT  facilities.  Introducing  ICT  also  requires  proper  physical  conditions  in \nschools.  These  include  computer  classrooms  with  proper  wiring,  security  enhanced  windows \nand doors, air-conditioning, and dust-reducing measures. School management must be strong \nsupporters and key change agents for ICT use, for which training will be needed as a priority. At \nthe same time, ICT will help to (i) enhance efficiency in using existing resources and reducing \ncosts  (electronic  timetabling  and  electronic  textbook  ordering),  and  (ii)  improve  school \nmanagement  capacity  (devolved  school  financing  and  computerized  information  systems). \nAdequate  and  timely  service  and  maintenance  at  the  school  level  is  essential  for  ensuring \n                                                 \n3   The  fact  that  a  large  number  of  primary  teachers  are  unqualified  (about  50%  by  Ministry  of  Public  Education \nestimates in 2002) and that the utilization rate of RITTIs is low at 60% is a strong indication of the ineffectiveness of \nthe current INSETT system.  \n\n4   ADB.  2004.

Manila. \n\n\fthe  best  support \n\nfor  schools.  The  process  of  upgrading \n\neffective use of ICT facilities. Establishing an effective nationwide network for such services will \nneed  active  and  wide  private  sector  participation.  At  present,  these  services  exist  mostly  in \noblast centers and urban areas, but are lacking in rural and remote areas. Effective demand for \nservice and maintenance from schools is a key condition for establishing a nationwide service \nnetwork.  \n \n18. \nInfrastructure Support and Power Supply. Access to the internet is an important part \nof  ICT  development.  Broadband  internet  connectivity  to  cluster  leader  schools  (CLSs)  will \nthe  country\u2019s \nprovide \ntelecommunications network to achieve widespread broadband access is to be completed in the \nnext  2\u20133  years.  In  the  interim,  high-capacity  connectivity  will  need  to  be  provided  to  CLSs  in \nphases  where  technically  feasible.  Prices  for  internet  connections  for  schools  will  need  to  be \nadjusted  to  encourage  internet  use.  Lack  of  reliable  and  predictable  power  supply  during  the \nschool  day  is  a  major  obstacle  to  computer  use  in  many  rural  and  remote  areas.  Unpaid \nelectricity  bills  are  a  main  reason  for  power  cuts.  Frequent  and  large-scale  power  surges  are \ntypical of all regions and load-shedding in many areas can range from 2\u20133 hours to the whole \nschool  day.  Thus,  ICT  development  in  schools  must  consider  appropriate  policy  and  other \nmeasures to improve power supply especially to rural schools.   \n \n19. \nFinancial Sustainability of ICT. ICT in basic education is costly. At current unit costs, \nwith  network-ready  desktop  personal  computers5  and  a  target  computer-student  ratio  of  1:42, \nequipping every basic education school will cost around $116 million. The annual replacement \ncosts of this investment are around $23 million at current costs based on a 5-year replacement \ncycle.  Operational  costs  (consumables,  maintenance,  and  servicing)  would  add  an  estimated \n$10  million  a  year.  Even  without  internet  connectivity,  the  recurrent  costs  could  amount  to \naround  $35  million  per  year,  which  is  equivalent  to  6.2%  of  the  basic  education  budget.  In \naddition  to  these  direct  recurrent  costs,  indirect  recurrent  costs  include  training  teachers, \ndeveloping  learning  materials,  providing  technical  and  managerial  support,  and  undertaking \nmonitoring and evaluation (M&E) of progress. The total cost of ownership of integrating ICT in \nschools,  even  at  the  current  planned  moderate  level,  will  be  substantial.  In  addition,  under \ncurrent  financing  arrangements,  schools  have  insufficient  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M) \nbudgets. The requirement from ICT use would add substantially to this gap, which, unless fully \nprovided by the Government, would seriously impair ICT development in schools.  \n \n20. \nPro-Poor  ICT  Development.  The  Government  has  a  clear  pro-poor  policy  in  ICT \ndevelopment  in  schools,  with  the  objective  of  reducing  and  bridging  the  internal  digital  divide. \nAlready  funding  to  schools  varies  significantly  by  oblast.  Many  schools  rely  on  parental \ncontributions  to  make  up  for  shortfalls  in  O&M  budgets.  This  represents  a  disproportionate \nburden  on  the  poor.  In  general,  schools  in  relatively  affluent  urban  areas  tend  to  have  better \nteachers  and  conditions,  and  are  better  positioned  to  generate  income  to  support  ICT.  These \nfactors combined pose a serious challenge for the Government to provide the same access to \nschools in poor, rural, and remote areas as in urban areas and affluent centers.  \n  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n5   A typical network-ready desktop personal computer also known as a \u201cfat (thick) client\u201d device does the majority of \nthe application processing as well as storing applications software and data on its own hard disk. A fat client device \ncan  be  used  away  from  the  network  as  a  stand-alone  device.  In  contrast,  a  non-network  ready  desktop  terminal \nalso known as the \u201cthin client\u201d network is one where the user, i.e., a student, can only access data and applications \nthat  are  stored  in  the  central  server.  A  thin  client  device  may  process  only  keyboard  input  and  screen  output, \nleaving all application processing to the server. A thin client terminal generally does not have a hard drive and may \nwell be unusable if disconnected from the network.   \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n3. \n\nGovernment Strategy and Policy  \n\n  \n21. \nIntegrating ICT in schools is a key strategy of the Government to achieve its subsector \nobjective of improving the quality and relevance of basic education, and to ensure equal access \nto all. Full integration of ICT in basic education will require an ICT-based curriculum, abundant \nlearning  materials,  a  majority  of  teachers  adept  at  ICT  use,  adequate  school  conditions  and \nphysical  infrastructure  in  place,  provision  of  financial  resources  to  cover  the  total  cost  of  ICT \nownership, and specifically designed pro-poor interventions from the public sector. At present, \nUzbekistan  has  embarked  on  the  initial  phase  to  providing  full  ICT  integration  in  schools. \nCognizant of the tasks and the need to overcome considerable constraints, the Government has \ndeveloped a draft strategy with ADB assistance to guide medium- and long-term implementation \nof its ICT in basic education program (Supplementary Appendix A).  \n \n22. \nThe draft strategy focuses on long-term ICT development in basic education that will be \nfinancially  sustainable,  educationally  effective,  and  pro-poor.  To  achieve  this,  the  strategy \nproposes a phased approach, with the first phase in 2006\u20132010 and the second in 2011\u20132015. \nThis  approach  prioritizes  the  limited  resources  available  during  the  first  phase  to  build  a  firm \nfoundation  for  the  long-term  integration  of  ICT  in  basic  education.  Key  to  the  first  phase  is  to \ndemonstrate real education benefits from ICT use in all schools. This, along with improvements \nin the broad financial and fiscal environments, will lay the foundation for larger scale and more \nintegrated use of ICT in the second phase.  \n \n23. \nCentral  to  successful  implementation  during  the  first  phase  is  the  establishment  of \nschool  clusters.  Each  cluster  will  contain  an  average  of  11  schools  so  that  860  clusters  will \ncover all schools in Uzbekistan. Each cluster will have a CLS whose role will be to lead all other \nschools in the cluster in activities relating to integrating ICT in teaching and learning. The school \ncluster  concept  is  strategic\u2014instead  of  spreading  the  limited  financial  and  human  resources \nevenly but thinly across all schools, the country will focus its resources on (i) establishing CLSs \nas  champions  and  mentors  for  the use  of ICT  in  the  educational  process,  and  strongholds  for \nfuture  ICT  expansion;  (ii)  fostering  the  school  cluster  network  into  an  effective  decentralized \ndelivery mechanism for, but not be limited to, teacher upgrading and ICT use in schools; and (iii) \nensuring effective use of ICT in poor and remote schools including internet access.  \n \n24. \nIn  addition,  ICT  use  in  learning  and  teaching  will  be  restricted  to  priority  subject  areas \nover a limited number of grades during the first phase. This will give more access time to ICT \nfacilities  per  student  and  teacher,  thus  allowing  real  education  benefits  to  accrue  with  limited \nfinancial  resources.  Further  cost  reduction  solutions  will  be  examined,  in  particular,  the  \u201cthin \nclient\u201d option, which is promising to offer substantial savings in total cost of ownership. These \nmeasures combined will significantly strengthen the financial sustainability of the ICT policy.  \n  \n\n4. \n\nAsian Development Bank Support for the Education Sector  \n\n \n25. \nBasic education is a key area of focus of ADB assistance to Uzbekistan, and ADB is the \nlead  external  development  partner  in  basic  education.  ADB\u2019s  sector  strategy  in  education \nfocuses on (i) supporting efforts to improve quality, relevance, and access to education; and (ii) \nenhancing  national  capacity  to  manage  sector  reforms.  Accordingly,  policy  dialogue  and \nassistance in basic education focus on addressing key issues and challenges of the subsector, \nwith five loans approved by ADB since 1997.  \n \n26. \nincluding  (i)  establishing  a \ncomprehensive  policy  framework  for  the  sector,  which  is  the  focus  of  the  Education  Sector \nDevelopment  Program  (ESDP);  (ii)  improving  governance,  education  financing,  and  sector \n\nis  comprehensive, \n\nADB  assistance \n\nthe  sector \n\nto \n\n\freform management, which is woven into all projects; (iii) continuing curriculum and assessment \nimprovement,  which  is  a  focus  of  the  STDP;  (iv)  strengthening  capacity  of  teachers  and  the \nteacher training system, which is a priority of both the ESDP and the Project; (v) meeting critical \ninvestment needs in learning materials especially textbooks, school libraries, and ICT facilities, \nwhich is a key activity in all projects; and (vi) supporting the poor and disadvantaged, which is a \nfocus  of  all  projects.  Technical  assistance  from  ADB  has  supported  this  effort,  in  particular  in \ninstitution and capacity development. Appendix 5 summarizes the complementarity between the \nProject and ongoing ADB projects in basic education. \n \n27. \nIn close coordination with ongoing ADB projects in the education sector, the Project will \nserve  as  catalyst  for  changes  in  a  number  of  key  issues  in  basic  education.  In  preparing  the \nProject,  ADB  has  worked  closely  with  key  stakeholders  including  the  Ministry  of  Public \nEducation  (MOPE)  and  Ministry  of  Finance  on  a  strategy  to  guide  implementation  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s ICT program in basic education over the next 10 years (para. 21). The strategy \npreparation is based on a comprehensive analysis of key constraints and opportunities including \nfinancial sustainability, educational preparedness, infrastructural support, and equitable access.  \n \n\n5. \n\nOther External Support for the Education Sector \n\n \n28. \nIn  basic  education,  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  and  the  United  Nations \nlearning \nEducational,  Scientific,  and  Cultural  Organization  (UNESCO)  are  monitoring \nachievements with results due by the end of 2005. This will be a useful step in addressing the \ncurrent  lack  of  data  on  learning  outcomes.  The  United  Nations  Development  Programme  has \nassisted  Uzbekistan  in  preparing  a  national  strategy  for  ICT  development,  which  identifies \neducation  as  a  priority  sector  for  strategy  implementation.  The  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational  Development  has  two  ongoing  projects:  one  is  a  pilot  for  strengthening  learning \nand  teaching,  management,  and  participation  in  100  schools;  and  the  other  is  focusing  on \npiloting ICT use in 60 schools. The latter has provided valuable experience in and lessons for \neffective  and  sustainable  ICT  use  in  schools.  The  World  Bank  is  preparing  its  first  education \nproject,  which  will  support  learning  materials  development,  teacher  training,  community \nparticipation,  and  school  management.  Some  bilateral  partners  provide  support  in  vocational \nand  higher  education.  The  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  recently  concluded  an  agreement  to \nprovide a loan of $19 million to Uzbekistan in support of ICT in basic education. The Project was \nprepared  in  close  coordination  with  all  other  external  agencies  active  in  the  education  sector. \nADB has initiated regular aid coordination meetings for the education sector, which will provide \na forum to discuss harmonization measures in the sector. A development coordination matrix is \nin Appendix 6.  \n \n\n6. \n\nLessons Learned  \n\n \nAppendix  7  summarizes  lessons  learned  and  how  they  are  incorporated  in  the  project \n29. \ndesign. A key lesson learned in projects involving ICT development in schools, both from ADB \nand  elsewhere,  is  the  importance  of  development  of  the  broad  supporting  environment.  This \nincludes  capacity  building  for  teachers  and  staff,  e-readiness  of  schools,  e-learning  materials \ndevelopment,  and  appropriate  curriculum  adjustments.  Without,  or  with  insufficient,  essential \nsupport,  the  full  potential  benefits  from  ICT  in  schools  will  not  be  realized.  These  lessons  are \nsupported  by  a  recent  UNESCO  report  on  ICT  experiences  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  which \nstresses the importance of a balanced approach combining hardware provision with appropriate \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nsupport  services.6  These  lessons  are  reflected  in  the  project  design.  Capacity  building  of \nteachers  and  staff  and  the  institutional  development  of  the  in-service  teaching  training  system \nmake up a key component of the Project to impart long-lasting benefits beyond the use of ICT. \nE-readiness  is  a  condition  for  installation  of  ICT  facilities  in  schools;  the  Project  will  provide \ngrants to encourage and stimulate development of e-learning materials especially in the Uzbek \nlanguage.  For  curriculum  support,  the  Project  will  coordinate  closely  with  the  ongoing  STDP, \nwhich has curriculum reform as a major component.  \n \nThe  importance  of  financial  sustainability  is  another  major  lesson  learned  in  most \n30. \nprojects for ICT development in education, and has major implications for equitability of access. \nEarly  projects  tended  to  underestimate  the  costs  of  O&M  for  ICT.  Recent  projects  in  other \ncountries have relied on parental contributions or other income-generating activities at schools \nto cover these costs. While enthusiasm about ICT use is widespread among students, parents, \nand teachers, parental contributions for ICT use would add a great burden especially for those \nwho are less able to afford it. Similarly, using school ICT facilities to generate income tends to \nwork in affluent and urban areas, while schools in poor and remote areas would end up being \ndisadvantaged.  Instead,  built  on  comprehensive  financial  and  economic  analysis,  the  Project \nseeks full funding of the total cost from the Government to ensure sustainability and equitable \naccess and use of ICT by the poor.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \nThe impact of the Project is improved quality, relevance, and equitable access of basic \n31. \neducation  for  all  students,  including  students  in  poor  and  remote  areas.  The  outcome  of  the \nProject  is  the  improvement  of  learning  outcomes  through  ICT  use  in  priority  subject  areas  in \ngrades  5\u20139  in  project  schools  with  a  pro-poor  focus.  These  priority  subject  areas  are \nmathematics,  sciences,  history,  and  languages,  in  addition  to  informatics.  A  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nB. \n \n32. \nThe Project comprises four components: (i) establishment of school clusters for ICT, (ii) \nteacher  and  staff  development  for  ICT,  (iii)  learning  materials  development,  and  (iv)  capacity \nbuilding and management support. \n \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nEstablishment of School Clusters for ICT \n\n33. \nThis  component  will  develop  an  operational  national  network  of  860  school  clusters, \ncovering  all  9,757  schools  in  Uzbekistan;  each  cluster  will  be  led  by  a  CLS.7  The  Project  will \nprovide  appropriate  ICT  facilities/connectivity  to  CLSs.  The  Government  will  provide  ICT \nfacilities to other schools in the clusters as part of its ICT in basic education program.  \n \nAs the strategic focus for investment in ICT hardware, connectivity, and training in ICT \n34. \nteaching  and  learning,  professional  development,  and  management  skills,  the  CLSs  will  (i) \n                                                 \n6   United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific,  and  Cultural  Organization.  2004.  Infoshare  and  Sources  and  Resources \n\nBulletin 6: 2. \n\n7   The identification of school clusters and selection of CLSs has been completed, with easy accessibility to the CLS \nbeing the primary principle in forming clusters and selecting CLSs. About 70% of the CLSs selected are in rural or \npoor areas and 500 of the CLSs selected will have new school libraries to be funded under the STDP. \n\n\fprovide  an  efficient  delivery  system  to  all  schools  for  e-learning  materials  and  information;  (ii) \noperate  as  centers  for  all  education  development  activities  within  the  clusters;  (iii)  provide \npedagogical,  technical,  and  management  support  to  all  schools  in  the  cluster;  (iv)  provide  the \ninstitutional  structure  for  the  rapid  development  of  a  decentralized  and  effective  INSETT;  (v) \ncoordinate  with  learning  resource  centers  (LRCs)  and  the  new  school  libraries,  both  being \ndeveloped  under  other  ADB-supported  projects;  (vi)  undertake  pilot  testing  and  research \ninitiatives related to ICT integration in basic education; and (vii) provide the vehicle for effective \nM&E of school ICT developments. Supplementary Appendix B outlines the role, responsibilities, \nand selection criteria of the CLSs. \n \n35. \nThe CLSs will be equipped with standard \u201cfat client\u201d networks under the Project because \nthey  will  need  greater  technical  capacity  and  flexibility  to  fulfill  their  lead  role  in  the  clusters. \nThese  include  pedagogically  essential  peripherals  including  data  projectors,  digital  cameras, \nprinters, and audiovisual equipment. Proposed specifications for hardware and peripherals are \nin  Supplementary  Appendix  C.  Each  CLS  will  be  supplied  with  one  additional  free-standing \ncomputer  for  school  management/administration  with  a  set  of  basic  software,  including  (i)  the \nUnited  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  school-based  education  management  information  system,  (ii) \ntextbook  ordering  software  (from  the  STDP),  (iii)  school  timetabling  software,  and  (iv)  basic \nschool accounting software. The CLSs will have internet and intranet connectivity to ensure that \nthey receive a wide range of e-learning materials. All the e-learning materials will be distributed \nby the CLSs to all the schools in the cluster. Supplementary Appendix D provides an outline of \nthe phased manner in which connectivity will be extended to all CLSs. \n \n36. \nPower  cuts  inhibit  the  full  use  of  ICT  hardware,  especially  in  rural  areas.  The \nGovernment  will  take  appropriate  and  timely  measures  to  ensure  reliable  power  supply  to  all \nCLSs, and to all schools based on the experience with the CLSs. Reliable power supply will be \na  condition  for  ICT  installation.  Adequate  financing  for  O&M  costs  is  identified  as  the  key  to \nensuring supply of consumables, and adequate servicing and maintenance, and thus to project \nsuccess. The Government will provide adequate and timely O&M allocations for all schools with \nICT  facilities,  including  CLSs,  to  ensure  effective  usage  and  sustainability.  The  Project  is \nexpected  to  create  effective  demand  for  ICT  maintenance  services  through  the  availability  of \nschool-based  budgets,  and  will  improve  service  quality  through  standard  servicing  contracts \nbetween schools and service providers.8  \n \n\n2. \n\nTeacher and Staff Development for ICT  \n\n \nThis component will build the capacity of teachers and staff for improving teaching and \n37. \nlearning  through  ICT  use.  This  will  require  (i)  creation  of  trained  trainers  and  development  of \nspecially  designed  course  modules  in  the  RITTIs  in  high  priority  subject  areas  for  ICT \ndevelopment  in  basic  education  and  across  the  curriculum;  (ii)  immediate  training  in  essential \nskills provided first to CLSs and then to every school with ICT facilities; and (iii) strengthening of \nthe  delivery  of  a  decentralized  system  for  continuous  professional  development  (CPD)  for  all \nschool staff.  \n \nIntegrating  ICT  in  basic  education  will  create  new  demands  on  staff  and  on  the \n38. \ncontinuous  upgrading  of  their  professional  skills.  The  training  will  cover  (i)  ICT  skills  in  school \n\n                                                 \n8   At present the joint-stock company Uzuchavtomatica has a nationwide network for servicing computers in schools. \nAn effective  way is to  include servicing in  equipment suppliers\u2019 contract,  which is  under consideration by MOPE. \nThe CLSs will play the support role for minor servicing and maintenance.   \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nnetwork  management,9  (ii)  subject-based  courses  for  RITTI  lecturers  and  teachers  as  future \ntrainers on the use of ICT across the curriculum, (iii) use of ICT in school administration, and (iv) \nintroduction of performance management and CPD for teachers. The Project will use the cluster \napproach  to  bring  in-service  training  to  local  areas  through  the  introduction  of  CPD,  firstly  in \nICT-related  training  but  thereafter  in  the  full  range  of  professional  training  and  upgrading \nrequirements.  Bringing  the  existing  in-service  training  system  closer  to  schools  and  making  it \nmore  accessible  to  teachers  and  thus  more  effective  will  be  a  key  to  the  success  of  capacity \nbuilding in support of ICT use. This will be accomplished through the CLSs, which will provide \nthe enabling institutional structure for the system. The Project will train 220 staff from the RITTIs \nand 560 staff from the LRCs in ICT-related skills, and will provide priority training to the CLSs \nand LRCs comprising 1,720 school network managers/ICT coordinators, 4,300 subject teachers \nin  the  use  of  ICT  in  priority  subjects,  and  1,720  administrators  and  specialists  in  school \nadministration  management  and  CPD  for  teachers.  During  2006\u20132010,  81,000  teachers, \ntechnicians, administrators, and school network managers from the 8,900 non-CLS schools will \nbe trained in the specialist skills required to integrate ICT into the basic education system.  \n \nThe  Project  will  be  closely  coordinated  with  the  ESDP.  A  focus  of  the  ESDP  is  to \n39. \nstrengthen  the  RITTIs\u2019  capacity  in  distance  education  delivery.  Where  possible,  the  INSETT \ncourse modules developed to support ICT in basic education under the Project will be adapted \nfor  distance  education  delivery.  Enhancing  CPD  for  teachers  using  the  CLSs  will  require  a \nsystem of performance management, which will be developed and made operational during the \nfirst year after loan effectiveness. The system will (i) identify annual staff needs for CPD, and (ii) \nlink training completed to performance targets and the remuneration system.  \n \n\n3. \n\nLearning Materials Development for ICT \n\n \n40. \nThis  component  will  develop  appropriate  learning  materials  in  Uzbek  and  other  local \nLOIs  for  priority  subjects  and  grades,  and  will  focus  on  developing  local  capacity  for  such \npurposes. This will require (i) training in learning materials development, (ii) development of e-\nmaterials  in  Uzbek  and  other  LOIs,  (iii)  competitive  award  of  grants  to  encourage  competition \nand  quality  material  development,  and  (iv)  localization  and  translation  of  already  successful \nsoftware from other countries.  \n \n41. \nICT  use  across  the  curriculum  requires  the  development  of  e-materials,  including  (i) \ngeneric  software  applications  such  as  spreadsheets  and  databases,  (ii)  web/intranet-based \nmaterials,  (iii)  e-books,  and  (iv)  subject-specific  educational  software.  These  materials  will \nsupport  teachers  in  the  use  of  ICT  and  help  students  to  work  independently.  Other  non-\ncomputer  based  ICT  materials  including  DVDs  (digital  video  disks)  and  other  audiovisual \nequipment  are  also  helpful  in  learning  and  teaching.  For  most  schools  without  direct \ninternet/intranet connections during the first phase of ICT development these materials can be \nprovided on CDs (compact disks), or downloaded and cached onto school servers. A portal will \nbe developed at MOPE for the intranet network within 9 months of loan effectiveness.  \n \n42. \nTraining  in  e-materials  development  skills  will  be  provided  through  the  RITTIs. \nSpecifically,  200  staff  will  be  trained  in  licensing,  localizing,  and  translation  techniques  of \nexisting software in other languages and in developing original materials. The RITTIs will offer \ncourses  in  software  development  to  400  teachers  and  to  private  sector  specialists  on  a  cost-\nrecovery  basis.  The  Project  will  award  software  development  grants  competitively,  in  close \n\n                                                 \n9   School  visits  indicate  that  the  lack  of  effective  school  network  management  has  caused  significant  problems  in \n\nmany schools currently equipped with ICT facilities.  \n\n\fcoordination  with  the  STDP  school  library  material  development  grant.  The  grants  will  initially \nconcentrate  on  the  adaptation  and  translation  into  local  languages  of  existing  educational \nsoftware with a proven track record of effectiveness.  \n \n\n4. \n\nCapacity Building and Management Support  \n\n \n43. \nThis  component  will  ensure  project  sustainability  and  effective  implementation  through \nthe development of appropriate policy and support for the introduction of ICT to basic education \nand effective project implementation.  \n \n44. \nFirst, support will be provided for effective financial planning through the development of \nannual  financial  plans  and  budgets,  including  adequate  annual  operational  budgets  to  support \neffective  ICT  use  in  schools  and  the  determination  of  realistic  ICT  replacement  and  O&M \nbudgets  for  wider  financial  planning  purposes.  Second,  support  will  be  provided  for  targeted \nresearch/pilot  testing  activities,  including  (i)  income  generation  opportunities  (e.g.,  rural \ntelecenters  for  use  by  communities),  (ii)  decentralized  school  financing,  (iii)  use  of  ICT  for \nstudents  with  special  education  needs,  (iv)  cost  comparisons  of  \u201cthin\u201d  and  \u201cfat  client\u201d \ntechnologies,  and  (v)  alternative  approaches  to  school  connectivity  particularly  for  schools  in \nrural and remote areas with difficult access. Well-designed pilot testing and research will provide \nimportant  insights  for  future  policy  and  the  development  of  new  approaches  to  existing \nproblems. Third, the component will design and implement a system of M&E, which will provide \nvaluable feedback on project progress against objectives and provide the basis for the design of \nsuccessor projects and the formation of second phase ICT policy. Fourth, support will be given \nfor a national publicity campaign to ensure that all stakeholders and the wider communities are \nfully informed about the Government\u2019s plans for ICT development in basic education in general \nand the Project in particular. Staff development and pilot projects are outlined in Supplementary \nAppendix E. \n  \nC. \n \n45. \nPro-Poor Design. The Project\u2019s poverty focus is reflected in several major aspects of its \ndesign. First, about 70% of project schools will be in poor or rural areas where the majority of \nthe poor of the country reside. Second, through the school clusters, the Project will help ensure \naccess to internet connection, and provide technical and pedagogical support for effective ICT \nuse  to  all  schools  in  the  country  including  those  in  rural  and  remote  areas.  Third,  the \nGovernment  is  committed  to  providing  adequate  and  timely  financing  for  O&M,  replacement, \nand other related costs for supporting ICT use in all schools as well as the initial investment and \nfuture replacement costs. These commitments are reflected in the project assurances and will \nbenefit the poor disproportionately since affordability issues are a greater concern for the poor. \nFourth,  the  Project  will  help  to  improve  power  supply  to  schools.  Schools  in  poor  and  remote \nareas  will  benefit  the  most,  not  only  from  ICT  use,  but  also  for  general  lighting  and  heating \npurposes, as these schools currently experience less reliable power supply. Finally, the Project \nwill pilot test (i) ICT to improve learning and teaching for children with special education needs, \nwhich  is  a  priority  of  the  Government;  and  (ii)  technologies  that  will  improve  connectivity  for \nschools in remote areas.  \n \n46. \nIntegrated  and  Participatory  Approach  to  Project  Design  and  Implementation. \nGiven the complexity of the issues involved, the successful integration of ICT in basic education \nwill  require  a  comprehensive  approach.  The  Project  is  based  on  a  national  strategy  that \naddresses  key \nfinancial  sustainability, \neducational  preparedness,  infrastructure  support,  and  equitable  access  to  ICT.  The  strategy \n\nissues  and  constraints  systematically, \n\nSpecial Features \n\nincluding \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nproposes a phased approach to ensure medium- and long-term success in ICT use in schools. \nThe  Project  emphasizes  institution  and  capacity  development  through  the  establishment  of \nschool clusters and the improvement of CPD for teachers. The school clusters will provide an \neffective  mechanism  for  further  decentralization  and  empowerment  in  basic  education  beyond \nthe use of ICT, and the improvement of INSETT will bring beneficial changes to the system in \naddition to ICT use. The project design has benefited significantly from a participatory approach. \nApart from MOPE and other agencies of the central Government, consultations were held at all \n14 oblast (province) centers, visits were made to over 30 of the 199 raions (districts), and over \n60  schools  and  makhallas  (communities),  where  over  180  focus  group  discussions  with \nteachers,  parents,  and students  were  conducted.  In  addition,  six  consultation  workshops  were \nheld at the central government level besides regular consultations with individual departments of \nkey  ministries.  Participation  will  also  be  a  key  characteristic  of  project  implementation.  In \nparticular,  the  school  clusters  will  enable  and  encourage  more  interactions  among  teachers, \nparents, students, and local communities. Key issues related to integrating ICT in schools, and \nthe special features of the Project are described in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n47. \nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $43.0 million equivalent, including physical \nand price contingencies, taxes and duties, and interest and other charges. Of the total cost, the \nforeign  exchange  cost  is  $26.1  million  (61%),  and  the  local  currency  cost  is  $16.9  million \nequivalent (39%). The indicative project cost estimates by component are summarized in Table \n1 and summary cost estimates by expense category are in Appendix 8.  \n \n\nTable 1: Summary of Project Cost  \n($\u2019000) \n \n\nForeign \nExchange\n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n \n\nComponent \n\nA.

The  loan  will  have  a  32-year  term,  including  a \ngrace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter. ADB will finance 70% of the total cost of the Project, including 96% \nof  the  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $25.1  million  and  29%  of  the  local  cost.  The  Government  will \nfinance $1.0 million of foreign exchange cost and $12.0 million equivalent of local costs (Table \n2).

MOPE  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  Project  management  will  consist  of  (i)  a  project \nsteering  committee  (PSC),  (ii)  a  project  director,  and  (iii)  a  project  implementation  unit  (PIU). \nThe  PSC,  to  be  appointed  by  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers,  will  be  the  decision-making  body \nresponsible  for  overall  project  implementation  and  coordination.  The  project  director,  to  be \nappointed  by  the  PSC,  will  provide  general  guidance  to  the  PIU  in  accordance  with  decisions \nmade by the PSC, arrange the quarterly PSC  meetings, present quarterly reports to the PSC, \nand  ensure  coordination  of  project  implementation  within  MOPE.  Given  MOPE\u2019s  experience \nwith ADB project implementation accumulated since 1998 and the recent successful completion \nof the Basic Education Textbook Development Project,10  financial management arrangements \nof MOPE are satisfactory for purposes of implementation of the Project.  \n \n50. \nAs  a  part  of  its  efforts  to  strengthen  project  implementation  for  more  effective  use  of \npublic resources, MOPE is in the process of rationalizing project management in the education \nsector.  Accordingly,  the  Project  will  integrate  its  management  with  that  of  ongoing  projects  in \nbasic  education  to  reduce  transaction  costs  and  maximize  economic  efficiency  in  project \nimplementation. In particular, the PSC for the Project will be integrated into one common PSC \nfor  the  ESDP  and  STDP.  Members  of  the  existing  PSCs  are  from  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers, \nMOPE,  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  other  agencies;  participation  may  be  adjusted  to  meet  the \nneeds  of  the  Project.  The  PSC  will  also  consider  appointing  the  project  director  for  the  ESDP \nand STDP as the project director for the Project. \n \nThe PIU will be responsible for day-to-day project management, including procurement \n51. \nand recruitment, staff development, finance and accounting, and monitoring and evaluation; as \nwell as preparing detailed project implementation plans, annual reports, and quarterly progress \nreports to submit to the PSC, the project director, and ADB. The PIU will have 6\u20138 full-time staff \nwith  expertise  in  these  areas.  To  ensure  timely  start-up  of  project  implementation,  MOPE  will \n                                                 \n10  ADB.  1997.

The PIU will be established in accordance with a government decision related to the \nestablishment  and  financing  of  this  PIU,  which  will  be  covered  by  retroactive  financing  (para. \n57). The PIU will be established in the same premises as the PIUs of the two ongoing projects, \nand  will  coordinate  closely  with  them  across  PIU  functions,  including  sharing  of  staff  where \nfeasible.  Eventual  consideration  will  be  given  to  measures  to  further  harmonize  project \nmanagement. A project management chart is in Appendix 9. \n \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years,  from  1  January  2006  to  31  December \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n52. \n2010. A project implementation schedule is in Appendix 10. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n53. \nThe  Project  will  procure  (i)  standard  packages  of  ICT  hardware  and  peripherals,  and \nrelated furniture and other equipment for 860 CLSs; (ii) non-computer based learning materials \nand  equipment  including  audiovisual  sets;  and  (iii)  furniture  and  computers  for  office  and \nadministrative  use.  ADB  loan-financed  goods  and  services  will  be  procured  following  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. Procurement of largest value will be for ICT hardware, which may \nbe distributed into several packages each larger than $1 million to allow proper sequencing of \ninstallation of ICT equipment in schools.11 Goods and services will be procured by international \ncompetitive  bidding  where  the  cost  is  valued  at  more  than  $1  million  equivalent,  or  by \ninternational  shopping  where  the  cost  is  valued  from  $100,000  to  $1  million  equivalent.  Direct \npurchase  may  be  applicable  for  goods  and  services  valued  at  less  than  $100,000  equivalent. \nProcurement of furniture and the development of software and e-materials valued at less than \n$0.5  million  per  contract  may  follow  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. \nThe  Government  will  finance  and  undertake  necessary  civil  works,  in  particular  to  rehabilitate \nand upgrade computer classrooms. Minimum criteria to be met by a school prior to installation \nof ICT equipment have been agreed.  \n \n54. \nThe  Government  has  been  advised  that  ADB  policy  requires  the  borrower  (including \nbeneficiaries of ADB loans), bidders, suppliers, and contractors under ADB-financed contracts, \nto  observe  the  highest  standards  of  ethics  during  the  procurement  and  execution  of  such \ncontracts. Indicative procurement packages are in Appendix 11. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n55. \nThe  Project  will  require  212  person-months  of  consulting  services,  consisting  of  52.5 \nperson-months  of  international  and  159.5  person-months  of  domestic  consulting.  Areas  of \nexpertise required include education reform and decentralization, software development, ICT in \nbasic  education,  training,  CPD,  school  networking,  and  pilot  project  design  and  evaluation. \nInternational consultants will be engaged through a firm in association with domestic consultants \nusing  quality  and  cost-based  selection  with  full  technical  proposals  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. PIU staff will be recruited separately using arrangements \n\n                                                 \n11  The  Project  envisages  installation  of  ICT  facilities  and  connectivity  in  CLSs  in  phases.  This  will  allow  necessary \nrehabilitation  work  on  computer  classrooms,  meeting  of  other  e-readiness  conditions,  and  proper  training  of \nteachers  and  staff  for  ICT  use  and  management.  Given  this  and  the  fast-changing  market  conditions  for  ICT \nequipment, sequencing of procurement of ICT equipment is appropriate.  \n\n\fsatisfactory to ADB. Outline terms of reference for international and domestic consultants are in \nAppendix 12.  \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n56. \nThe  proposed  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook.  If  Government  funds  are  first  used  for  eligible  expenditures,  ADB's  reimbursement \nprocedure will be applied. The Government requested the establishment of an imprest account, \nwith a ceiling of $150,000, to expedite loan disbursement. Statement of expenditure procedure \nwill  be  used  to  liquidate/replenish  the  imprest  account  and  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures \nthat do not exceed $20,000 per payment.  \n \n\n6. \n\nRetroactive Financing and Advanced Procurement Action \n\n57. \nThe  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  retroactive  financing  to  cover  the  PIU \noperational expenditures from 26 August 2005 (completion date of loan appraisal) up to the loan \neffectiveness  date.  The  Government  has  also  requested  advance  procurement  action  for  ICT \nequipment for the 860 CLSs and for office equipment and a vehicle for the PIU. The advance \naction  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The  total \namount  under  retroactive  financing  is  estimated  at  not  more  than  $100,000.  The  Government \nwas  advised  that  ADB  approval  of  advance  action  and  retroactive  financing  does  not  commit \nADB to financing the Project. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n58.  MOPE will maintain separate accounts for project components financed by ADB and the \nGovernment,  and  will  prepare  financial  statements  according  to  international  accounting \nstandards.  MOPE  will  have  the  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  audited \nannually  by  independent  auditors  with  adequate  qualification,  knowledge,  and  experience  in \ninternational  accounting  practices  acceptable  to  ADB.  Certified  copies  of  the  audited  project \naccounts  and  financial  statements,  as  well  as  the  auditor\u2019s  reports  including  a  separate  audit \nopinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditure  procedures  will  be \nsubmitted  to  ADB  within  6  months  after  the  end  of  each  financial  year.  The  Government  was \nadvised  of  ADB\u2019s  requirement  for  the  timely  submission  of  audited  project  accounts  and \nfinancial statements, including the suspension of disbursements in case of noncompliance. \n \n59.  MOPE  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  reports  in  English  and  in  a  format \nacceptable  to  ADB  on  progress  made  and  problems  encountered  during  the  period  under \nreview,  the  steps  taken  or  proposed  to  remedy  problems  encountered during  the  quarter,  and \nthe  proposed  activities and  expected  progress during  the  following  period.  Within 3  months  of \nphysical  completion  of  the  Project,  MOPE  will  submit  a  project  completion  report  to  ADB  to \nfacilitate  postevaluation  of  the  Project.  The  project  completion  report  will  provide  details  about \nimplementation, costs, benefits, and other information requested by ADB.  \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n60. \nIn  addition  to  targets  specified  in  the  project  framework,  systematic  monitoring  and \nevaluation will be specifically developed and undertaken during project implementation. For this \npurpose  a  set  of  indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluating  project  performance  in  relation  to  its \nimpact, outcome, and outputs will be agreed upon prior to loan negotiations (Appendix 13). The \nestablishment  of  the  baseline  values  of  the  indicators  will  be  one  of  the  first  activities  after \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nproject  implementation  begins  and  the  PIU  is  established.  Since  the  first  CLSs  are  unlikely  to \ncome  onstream  until  the  third  quarter  of  2006,  this  will  allow  sufficient  time  to  design  and \nconduct  the  baseline  study  and  establish  definitive  indicators.  Monitoring  indicators  will  be \nmeasured and reported on annually during project implementation. Comments and findings on \nthese  indicators  will  be  incorporated  into  quarterly  reports  to  ADB.  In  addition  to  indicators  for \nimplementation  monitoring,  indicators  for  project  evaluation  will  be  measured  at  project \ncompletion  and  3  years  afterward.  Where  feasible  and  appropriate,  these  data  should  be \ndisaggregated  by  poverty \n(oblast/raion  and \nrating,  gender,  LOI,  and \nremote/rural/urban).  At  project  inception,  completion,  and  3  years  after  completion,  MOPE  will \nsubmit  to  ADB  a  report  that  summarizes  the  key  findings  of  monitoring  and  evaluation  of \nchanges  that  occurred  in  the  3  preceding  years.  The  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring \nproject  activities  using  data  and  feedback  from  the  RITTIs,  LRCs,  oblast  and  raion  education \ndepartments, oblast finance departments, CLSs including teachers, students and parents, and \ndomestic and international consultant reports.  \n \n\nlocation \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n61. \nThe  Project  will  be  reviewed  at  least  twice  a  year.  In  addition,  given  that  much  of  the \nresearch  and  pilot  testing  will  be  carried  out  during  the  first  years  of  implementation, \ncomprehensive reviews of project performance will be conducted at the end of the first and third \nyears  of  implementation.  The  first  comprehensive  review  will  focus  on  the  results  and \nimplications  of  research  and  pilot  testing,  as  well  as  the  effectiveness  of  the  implementation \narrangements.  The  second  (midterm)  review  will  (i)  review \nthe  scope,  design,  and \nimplementation arrangements of the Project; (ii) identify any changes required since the time of \nproject appraisal; (iii) assess progress of project implementation against performance indicators; \n(iv) review progress made by the Government in ensuring financial sustainability of introducing \nICT  in  basic  education;  and  (v)  if  necessary,  recommend  changes  in  the  design  or \nimplementation arrangements.  \n \n\n10. \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\n \n62. \nThe  Mission  explained  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  to  Government  officials  and \nhighlighted paras. 1.06 to 1.08 of ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement on issues concerning fraud \nand corruption. The Government agreed to include the relevant sections of ADB\u2019s anticorruption \npolicy in all documents and contracts during bidding for and implementation of the Project. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nProject Benefits and Beneficiaries \n\n \nA.  \n \nDirect Beneficiaries. The Project will directly benefit students in grades 5\u20139 in the 860 \n63. \nCLSs, totaling 540,000 during the life of the Project. The benefits will come from the improved \nlearning  and  teaching  conditions  resulting  from  the  provision  and  application  of  ICT  in \nclassrooms  and  internet  connections.  Direct  beneficiaries  will  also  include  7,740  teachers  in \nCLSs, 63,200 teachers in non-CLSs, 1,720 CLS school management staff, 17,800 management \nstaff in non-CLSs, 220 RITTI lecturers, and 600 local language e-materials developers, whose \nskills will improve by the targeted training to be provided under the Project. Given the proposed \ncentral  role  of  the  CLSs  in  the  school  system,  all  students  and  teachers  will  benefit  from  the \nProject, albeit to a less intensive degree than those identified here. This would amount to about \n6  million  students  and  200,000  teachers  during  2006\u20132010.  Finally,  the  Project  will  seek  to \n\n\fextend  ICT  facilities  in  schools  to  the  wider  community,  from  which  an  estimated  1  million \nhouseholds in mostly poorer rural areas will benefit.  \n \n64. \nPoverty  and  Social  Development  Impact.  The  Project  will  have  a  direct  beneficial \nimpact on about 165,000 poor students in grades 5\u20139 enrolled in the 860 CLSs during 2006\u2013\n2011.12  Specific  pro-poor  measures  of  the  Project  include  (i)  ensuring  about  70%  of  the  860 \nCLSs  from  rural  and  poor  areas;  (ii)  improving  power  supply  to  schools  to  ensure  proper \nworking  of  the  ICT  facilities  installed  as  well  as  for  general  lighting  and  heating  purposes  in \nwinter;13 and (iii) developing stakeholder awareness of the needs of vulnerable children and pilot \ndemonstration  on  the  development  of  e-learning  materials  and  teacher  trainings.  By  providing \nICT  facilities  and  internet  connectivity,  the  Project  will  benefit  the  poor  and  help  to  bridge  the \ninternal digital divide. The Project will address the issue of increasing parental contributions to \nschools,  which  burdens the  poor  disproportionately,  by  ensuring  that  no  parental  contributions \nwill  be  required  for  ICT  use  in  schools.  Finally,  the  Project  will  benefit  an  estimated  1  million \nhouseholds in poor and rural communities through open access to ICT facilities in schools.14  \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  an  assessment  of  gender  stereotyping  through  analysis  of  e-\n65. \nmaterials  content  and  identify  appropriate  strategies  for  improving  the  presentation  of  gender \nroles and issues. The Project will ensure that girls and boys have equal access to all required \nlearning e-materials and ICT. The improved INSETT system that is closer to schools and more \nflexible will benefit at least 28,000 women teachers who account for over 70% of the teaching \nforce in the CLSs, with a far greater number of women teachers in the school system who will \nbenefit  during  the  life  of  the  Project.  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in \nAppendix 14.  \n \n66. \nEducational  Benefits.  The  main  educational  benefits  from  the  introduction  of  ICT  into \nbasic  education  will  be  a  fundamental  shift  to  student  centered  learning  and  teaching \nmethodologies.  This  will  be  reflected  in  (i)  the  link  between  integrated  ICT  use  in  the  school \ncurriculum  and  improved  student  performance  in  the  priority  subjects  for  ICT  use;  (ii)  the \ndevelopment  of  skills  and  competencies  (as  opposed  to  factual  knowledge  accumulation)  and \nthe development of higher order thinking skills; (iii) increased student responsibility for their own \nwork,  enhanced  student  research  capacity,  and  greater  individual  learning;  (iv)  enhanced \nstudents\u2019 motivation; and (v) increased relevance of education due to familiarity with information \nand computers. These combined will have a positive impact on the overall system to produce \ngraduates  with  the  ability  to  meet  working  life  challenges  in  the  21st  century  where  the \nworkforce  will  be  required  to  have  increasingly  advanced  skills  in  information  access, \nmanagement, processing, and usage. \n \n67. \n The  Project  will  significantly  improve  the  effectiveness  of  the  system  for  CPD  for \nteachers. In particular, the establishment of school clusters and the close working relationship \nrequired between the existing RITTIs and CLSs under the Project will make the content of CPD \nmore  relevant  and  its  delivery  more  effective.  The  Project  will  also  lay  the  foundation  for  the \nplanned second phase of ICT development after 2010, which is expected to lead to rapid gains \nin learning outcomes. \n \n\n                                                 \n12  This  assumes  that  27.5%  of  the  students  on  average  are  from  poor  families,  a  poverty  indicator  based  on  the \n\nWorld Bank Living Standard Assessment (2004).  \n\n13  Lack of heating is cited as one reason that some parents do not let their children go to schools in winter.  \n14 Experience  in  other  countries  shows  that  access  to  ICT  facilities  and  the  internet  has  a  particularly  beneficial \n\nimpact on rural communities.   \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nFinancial  and  Economic  Analyses.  The  most  significant  economic  benefit  will  come \n68. \nfrom  (i)  increases  in  future  earnings  of  school  graduates  with  better  education  attainment  and \ninformation  literacy,  and  (ii)  better  utilization  of  the  20%  of  teacher  time  currently  allocated  for \nprofessional  development.  Under  plausible  assumptions,  extra  earnings  of  about  600,000 \ngraduates could reach $30 million a year. The collaboration between cluster schools will utilize \nthe allocated CPD day more fully. This would be equivalent to $16.1 million a year assuming a \n50%  effective  recovery  rate  of  the  teachers\u2019  salaries  for  the  CPD  day  that  is  lost  under  the \ncurrent system.  Quantifiable benefits will also come from each of the four project components \nby  reducing  costs  or  increasing  efficiency  in  existing  expenditures.  The  total  quantifiable \neconomic  benefit  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $54.8  million  per  year.  The  net  present  value \n(NPV) of the project impact under the high case scenario of economic benefit utilization is $69.1 \nmillion with an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 43% from 2006\u20132015. In the medium \ncase  scenario,  the  NPV  is  $29.9  million  with  an  EIRR  of  23%,  while  the  NPV  in  the  low  case \nscenario is minus $17.6 million with an EIRR of 6%. While the low case scenario indicates the \npotential  risk  of  the  Project,  the  medium  and  high  case  scenarios  highlight  the  significant \nbenefits of the Project with accelerated rate of economic benefit utilization. In both the high and \nlow case scenarios, the total Government commitment to externally funded projects in education \nis deemed affordable and sustainable. The economic and financial analysis is in Supplementary \nAppendix G. \n \nEnvironmental  and  Social  Safeguards.  The  Project  will  carry  out  minor  repairs  and \n69. \nrehabilitation of existing school buildings and facilities to be funded by the Government, with no \nland  acquisition  required,  or  negative  environmental  or  resettlement  impact.  The  Project  will \nenhance access and equity for education directly for about 45,000 students using other LOIs in \nthe CLSs through equal access to ICT facilities and the creation of learning materials under the \nProject.  Development  of  e-learning  materials  will  help  reduce  production  costs  of  textbooks  in \nother LOIs thus benefiting the students by increasing the availability of learning materials.  \n \nB.  \n \n70. \n \nRisks  Related  to  the  Adoption  of  New  Technology.  Using  ICT  in  schools  is  new; \n71. \nmore than 50% of schools have never had access to computers. The risks of inadequate and \ninappropriate use of ICT as well as mismanagement of the facilities will be high. These risks will \nbe  mitigated  by  extensive  capacity  building  for  teachers  and  school  management  to  ensure \nintended use and impact of ICT in schools. \n \n72. \nInfrastructure and Logistical Risks. For the effective use of ICT in schools, the Project \nwill  require  a  number  of  basic  infrastructure  and  logistical  conditions  to  be  met,  including \nappropriate  classroom  facilities  with  security  arrangements,  power  supply,  internet/intranet \nconnectivity,  and  services  and  maintenance.  These  concerns  are  addressed \nthrough \ncovenanted assurances. \n \nFinancial  Sustainability  Risks.  Throughout  the  design  of  the  Project,  the  financial \n73. \nimplications of the integration of ICT have been carefully reviewed and extensive consultations \nheld with the Government to ensure the Project and the Government\u2019s plans for integrating ICT \nin basic education are financially sustainable. The Project addresses these concerns through (i) \ncovenants on adequate and timely budget provision for O&M and replacement costs; (ii) piloting \nof low cost \u201cthin-client\u201d solutions; and (iii) a strong focus on financial sustainability during project \nreviews, including the midterm review.  \n\nThe Project faces three major types of risks.  \n\nRisks \n\n\fV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n \nA. \n \n74. \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n75. \nGovernment Counterpart Funding. The Government will allocate annually, in a timely \nmanner,  adequate  funding  in  the  budget  for  the  counterpart  funding  specified  by  the  Project, \nand will provide ADB with information on such allocations annually. \n  \n76. \nFinancing  for  Sustainable  ICT  Use  in  All  Schools.  The  Government  will  make \nadequate  annual  budget  allocations  in  the  medium-term  budgetary  framework  satisfactory  to \nADB  for  ICT  use  in  all  schools  to  cover  hardware  investments,  O&M  costs  including \nconsumables, servicing, maintenance, electricity, cost of equipment replacement, and cost of in-\nservice teacher training, by (i) adopting a regulation describing operational and strategic goals \nfor  all  schools  and  budget  allocations  assigned  to  them;  (ii)    establishing  a  quarterly  reporting \nsystem showing the receipts and use of funds intended for ICT use by all schools; (iii) allocating \nin  the  medium-term  budgetary  framework  an  amount  satisfactory  to  ADB  to  cover  the \nreplacement costs of the equipment; and (iv) providing information on an annual basis to ADB \non items (i), (ii), and (iii) before the state budget is finalized. \n \n77. \nConnectivity  for  CLSs.  The  Government  will  provide  (i)  reliable  connectivity  to  all \nCLSs;  (ii)  technical  specifications  related  to  connectivity  before  each  contract  package  of  ICT \nequipment financed by ADB is finalized; and (iii) adequate financing in a timely manner to cover \nthe  installation  and  operational  costs  of  internet/intranet  connectivity  for  all  CLSs  by  adopting \nthe same mechanism as indicated in para. 76, items (i), (ii), and (iv).  \n \nPricing  Adjustment  to  Encourage  Internet  Connection.  The  Government  through \n78. \nMOPE will initiate discussions with Uzbektelecom with a view to successfully reducing prices for \ninternet connections for project schools within 6 months of loan effectiveness. \n \nIncentives for Professional Development for Teachers in ICT Use. The Government \n79. \nthrough  MOPE  will  integrate  teachers\u2019  professional  development  in  ICT  use  into  the  improved \nincentive  system  for  teachers.  This  incentive  will  recognize  and  reward  teachers  who  have \nreceived  ICT  training  with  certification.  The  Government  through  MOPE  will  propose  such \nincentive  schemes  by  31  December  2006  for  piloting  starting  in  2007,  and  will  inform  and \nupdate ADB on the progress of such piloting.  \n \n80. \nICT Installation in All Schools. The Government through MOPE will ensure that oblast \nand  raion  staff  will  rigorously  apply  the  national  guidelines  for  ICT  installation  prior  to  ICT \ninstallation  to  ensure  that  all  schools  are  ready  to  receive  ICT  installations.  Specifically,  no \nschool should be supplied with an ICT installation unless a suitable ICT classroom is available, \nwith necessary security arrangements and reliable power supply, and at least one staff member \nhas training in the management of hardware and the school network. The Government through \nMOPE will semiannually update ADB on progress of the Government program of ICT provision \nto schools.  \n \n81. \nPriority  for  Rehabilitation  of  CLSs.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  school \nrehabilitation  and  refurbishment  of  computer  rooms,  including  the  safe  rewiring  of  premises, \nprovision of adequate climate control (air-conditioning and dust-control measures), and security \narrangements to CLSs will be completed according to the minimum criteria agreed between the \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nGovernment  and  ADB,  and  Government  regulations,  including  Cabinet  of  Ministers\u2019  resolution \n321 of 9 June 2004. The Government will ensure that the rehabilitation of schools will be carried \nout in a timely manner to ensure expeditious installation of ICT equipment in the CLSs.  \n \nRehabilitation  of  CLSs.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  rehabilitation  of  CLSs  will \n82. \ninvolve  only  minor  civil  works  with  no  negative  environmental  impact.  The  Government  will \nensure that the rehabilitation will not entail any land acquisition or resettlement.  \n \nPower  Supply  to  All  Schools.  The  Government  through  MOPE,  Ministry  of  Finance, \n83. \nand the State Joint-Stock Company UZBEKENERGO will, within 6 months of loan effectiveness, \ntake appropriate measures satisfactory to ADB to ensure reliable power supply to all CLSs. This \nwill  be  treated  as  a  pilot  for  reliable  power  supply  to  all  schools.  The  midterm  review  of  the \nProject will assess the piloting of CLSs. Based on the assessment, the Government will within 6 \nmonths after the midterm review take effective measures satisfactory to ADB for establishing a \nsystem of reliable power supply for ICT use in all schools.  \n \nExtended School Opening Time. MOPE will ensure through the issuance of a MOPE \n84. \nregulation that current school regulations are appropriately adjusted by December 2006 to allow \nextended school opening and operating time for computer rooms for ICT use.  \n \n85. \nDevolved  Financing  Experiments  for  CLSs.  The  Government  will  undertake  to  pilot \ndifferent  methods  of  devolved  funding  to  some  CLSs  to  test  decentralized  resource \nmanagement and will inform ADB on this piloting. \n \n86. \nEffective  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  a  monitoring \nand  evaluation  system  will  be  established  after  loan  effectiveness,  and  be  made  fully \noperational  within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  with  baseline  data  established  within  6 \nmonths of loan effectiveness. \n \nEthnic Minorities.

To realize this national aspiration, the basic education subsector faces key challenges \nto improve its quality, relevance, and equitable access for all. Major constraints are analyzed in \nthis appendix (a problem tree analysis is attached).  \n \nGovernance and Management. Education system governance is characterized by top-\n2. \ndown,  overly  centralized  decision  making.  Until  recently  the  Ministry  of  Public  Education \n(MOPE)  had  no  policy  mandate  but  operated  as  the  implementing  agency  for  policies  and \nstrategies determined by the Cabinet of Ministers. This situation started to change in 2005 with \nprogress in decentralization and the ongoing civil service reform, which aims to provide sector \nministries with greater policy responsibility. However, MOPE remains weak in strategic planning, \npolicy  making,  and  sector  management  capacity.  Coordination  between  and  within  ministries \nand  government  agencies  especially  at  the  policy  level  is  systematically  lacking.  The \nwidespread  practice  of  compartmentalization  of  responsibilities  often  leads  to  policies  and \ndecision making based on insufficient information and with only a restricted understanding of the \nfull implications of critical decisions.  \n \nWithin  this highly  bureaucratic  system,  norms  rule.  For  example,  in  all  subjects  taught, \n3. \nprograms  and  standards  set  by  the  central  Government  strictly  dictate  the  contents  and  time \nallocated  for  the  subjects,  leaving  inadequate  freedom  for  schools  to  adjust  to  student  needs \nand  local  conditions.  State  norms  fix  student-teacher  ratios  countrywide,  and  schools  have \nneither  the  power  nor  budgetary  incentives  to  strive  for  optimal  use  of  existing  resources. \nSchools have little discretionary spending authority over their budgets. As a result, the system \ndoes not encourage nor reward capacity building in planning and management skills.  \n \nWithin  MOPE  many  of  these  problems  and  their  consequences  seem  to  now  be \n4. \nrecognized  and  attempts  are  under  way  for  further  decentralization  of  decision  making  to \nschools and for an upgrading in school management capacity. Of particular concern is the lack \nof effective targeting of the Government\u2019s financial support for the poorest. At present 15% of all \ntextbooks (and 100% of grade 1 textbooks) are provided free of charge to schools; an annual \nfund  allocation  is  provided  to  all  schools  for  winter  clothes  and  shoes.  Unfortunately,  this  pro-\npoor support is based on a fixed and equal level of support for every school, irrespective of the \npoverty status of the school. Thus the fund allocation does not target the poorest.1 \n \n5. \nCurriculum,  Assessment,  and  Structure  of  Education.  Although  attempts  at \ncurriculum  change  have  been  ongoing  since  1991  and  some  progress  has  been  made  in \nreforming  state  education  standards,  the  current  curriculum  continues  to  be  overloaded  in \ncontent, with too many subjects and an emphasis on factual recall and on repetitive exercises \nrather  than  on  the  development  of  key  skills  and  competencies.  Difficulties  in  achieving \nsignificant curriculum reform since independence stem from (i) a continuing belief among many \nsenior  educators  that  the  traditional  education model  should  not  be  significantly  changed,  and \n(ii) a lack of knowledge and appreciation of modern curriculum. This has led to approaches to \ncurriculum reform that are based on minor amendments of the existing curriculum. Because little \n\n                                                 \n1   As an example, two neighboring makhallas (community \u2013 the lowest government-recognized administration unit in \nUzbekistan) in one raion in Ferghana oblast provided poverty data indicating 2% of families living below the poverty \nline  in  one  makhalla  and  97%  of  families  living  below  the  poverty  line  in  the  other.  Both  makhallas  received  the \nsame per capita poverty allocations. \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nis taken out and much is added, the problem of curriculum overload gets worse and the basic \nstructure of the curriculum remains unchanged.  \n \n6. \nThe  overloaded  curriculum  reinforces  didactic  teacher-centered  classroom  approaches \nand  inhibits  any  significant  shift  to  student-centered  learning  because  of  the  time  constraints \nimposed by excessive content and the need to move fast in order to complete the syllabuses in \nthe time available. Thus the current curriculum fails to provide a suitable framework for the more \nrelevant learning outcomes required by the Government as part of its wider education strategy. \nA shift to the development of skills and higher order thinking cannot be delivered if no classroom \ntime is available to practice these learning objectives.  \n \n7. \nThe  current  assessment  and  testing  system  is  based  on  student  grading  by  individual \nteachers  in  the  lower  grades2  and  national  tests,  which  are  also  administered  and  marked  by \nstudents\u2019  own  subject  teachers,  who  are  often  also  providing  them  with  paid  examination \ncoaching.  Apart  from  potential  conflict  of  interest,  this  system  provides  for  no  effective  and \nreliable  assessment.  It  is  impossible  currently  to  compare  student  attainment  on  a  national, \noblast, raion, or school basis, or to compare progress in the national achievement of attainment \ntargets  year-on-year  or  internationally.  Current  language  of instruction  (LOI)  policy  guarantees \nthe rights of ethnic minorities to education, but the policy is expensive, and concerns exist about \ninequity  in  the  educational  opportunities  and  quality  provided  to  different  language  groups. \nEquity in the provision of educational materials is a particular problem because of the relatively \nhigh unit costs of printing textbook titles in low print runs for small language groups. \n \n8. \nThe  transition  from  an  11-  to  a  12-year  system  of  education  is  expensive  and  for  a \nnumber of years between 1997 and 2004 it diverted urgently needed funding away from basic \neducation.  The  transition  to  a  12-year  system  where  students  will  have  to  transfer  from  basic \nschools to specialized professional colleges and academic lyceums after grade 9 will mean that \nmany students will have to travel farther to school and will incur additional costs as a result. This \ncould have an adverse impact on the progression rate from grade 9 to grade 10, particularly in \nrural  areas  and  for  poorer  families.  The  problem  is  aggravated  by  less  reliable  transportation \nsystems in rural areas, which exacerbate the problems of student travel to more distant schools.  \n \nEducation  Financing.  As  a  high  priority,  education  expenditure  in  real  terms  has \n9. \nincreased  every  year  since  2000,  and  stood  at  9.5%  of  gross  domestic  product  in  2005.3 \nHowever,  basic  education  was  relatively  underfunded  versus  other  subsector.4  Aware  of  the \ndeterioration in physical plant and facilities in basic education due to years of underfunding, the \nGovernment  launched  the  National  Program  for  Basic  Education  Development  2004\u20132009  for \nthe urgent rehabilitation and upgrading of the whole system. Within the sector, basic education \nexpenditure  has  risen  from  45.5%  to  50.3%  over  the  past  5  years  and  will  continue  to  rise \naccording to Ministry of Finance.  \n \n10. \nTo help meet growing costs of education reform and maintenance of the basic education \ninfrastructure, education financing has been decentralized since 2000 to oblast and raion levels. \n\n                                                 \n2   The current rating system is universally unpopular with students, parents, and teachers. Teachers can often spend \nup to 50% of lesson time completing student grading sheets, which increases the pressure to complete an already \noverloaded curriculum.  \n\n3  The average for the member countries of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development is 5.1% for \n\nthe same period.  \n\n4   In  2004  preschool  enrolment  was  just  8.0%  of  total  enrolment  in  basic  and  senior  secondary  education  but \nreceived 14.1% of the total education budget4 and per capita expenditure on senior secondary has been more than \ndouble per capita expenditure on basic education for the past few years. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n29 \n\nIn  2005,  65%  of  the  national  education  budget  is  raion  financed,  22%  is  oblast  financed,  and \nonly 13% comes from the state budget. Unfortunately, variations in incomes and tax collection \ncapacity have led to increasing differentials over funding for schools. This in turn is seen as a \nmain reason for perceived variations across oblasts in the quality of education.  \n \n11. \nThe  current  norm-based  budgeting  places  high  priority  on  teachers\u2019  remuneration  and \nutility at the expense of other items. In 2005, these two items represent almost 87% of the total \neducation recurrent budget. Further salary increases agreed in June 2005 might well push the \nsalary/social cost component of the basic education recurrent budget over 90% in 2006. While \nincreasing  teachers\u2019  salary  is  a  good  policy  in  itself,  this  increase  without  an  increase  in  the \ngeneral  recurrent  budget  allocation  will  bring  further  pressure  to  bear  on  already  inadequate \nschool operating budgets. This may well result in increased demands for parental contributions. \nSuch contributions are widely in use and have a disproportionately adverse impact on the poor.  \n \n12. \nThe current financing system, which establishes norms for every aspect of the education \nsystem; removes management flexibility from oblasts, raions, and individual schools; and makes \ndeveloping  genuine  financial  management  skills  at  any  level  of  the  system  difficult.  The \nestablishment of minimum school cost profiles and the provision of devolved, school-based, per \ncapita financing budgets based on these profiles would provide the opportunity for all schools to \ntake  their  own  priority  financing  decisions,  based  on  their  own  (and  their  community) \nperceptions of priority needs within an adequate budgetary framework. This could rapidly lead to \nbetter use of available funds and a more cost-effective school financing system,5 and relieve the \nburden on the poor. \n \nResources  and  Inputs.  Basic  education  suffers  from  insufficient  investment  in \n13. \ninfrastructure, equipment, and facilities. A 2004 nationwide survey revealed that 40% of schools \nare housed in inappropriate and unfit buildings. There are also wide variations in the supportive \ninfrastructure, including power supplies to schools and telecommunications facilities. Resources \ntend  to  be  a  particular  problem  in  rural  areas,  where  80%  of  schools  are  located  and  where \nfacilities tend to be worse. Remote schools with difficult access suffer from particular resource \nprovision problems and require special consideration. \n \nLack of sufficient and appropriate learning materials continues to be a problem. Despite \n14. \nthe  success  of  the  textbook  rental  scheme,  high  costs  of  textbooks  in  those  subjects  not \ncovered  by  the  scheme  prevent  some  parents  from  purchasing  them.  There  is  a  clear  need \neither to reduce the number of required textbooks or to include all prescribed textbooks within \nthe scheme to reduce parental expenditure on textbooks. School libraries have not been funded \nfor  almost  20  years  and  school  library  stock is out-of-date and  largely redundant. This  has  an \nadverse  impact  on  the  development  of  independent  learning  and  the  shift  to  student-centered \nlearning.  Laboratory  equipment  and  necessary  consumables  are  in  short  supply.  In  2004  only \n18% of basic schools had access to modern personal computers and just 50% of schools had \naccess to any form of computers, including those of the Soviet era. Very few basic schools have \ninternet  access  and  many  schools  cannot  afford  the  costs  of  consumables,  maintenance,  and \nservicing associated with information and communications technology (ICT) use. Almost no e-\nresources are available in Uzbek or other local LOI, which limits the impact of the introduction of \nICT. Learning materials in the local LOI are in particular short supply, which has an impact on \nequity between different LOIs. \n \n\n                                                 \n5   A United States Agency for International Development experiment in per capita school financing is currently under \n\nway in Akkurgan raion, Tashkent oblast. \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nA reformed basic education system requires appropriately qualified teachers. At present, \n15. \nthe  large  majority  of  teachers  have  little  previous  experience  or  knowledge  of  alternative \nteaching and learning approaches, and little or no experience of ICT and its potential use across \nthe  curriculum.  MOPE  considers  about  50%  of  primary  school  teachers  to  be  unqualified \n(without  higher  education),  and  many  are  overspecialized  in  narrow  subject  areas.  While  the \nGovernment  has  improved  teachers\u2019  pay  significantly  over  the  past  2  years,  defined  career \nopportunities  are  lacking.  The  current  in-service  teacher  training  system  is  distant  from  the \nschools  (located  in  oblast  centers)  and  infrequent  (once  every  5  years).  Such  an  inflexible \nsystem is particularly inconvenient to women who account for over 70% of all teachers. The in-\nservice teacher training system needs to be urgently improved to retool teachers in a relatively \nshort period of time.  \n \nDemand-Side  Issues.  Preliminary  results  of  focus  group  interviews6  with  parents, \n16. \nstudents,  and  teachers  indicate  general  parental  satisfaction  with  schools  and  teachers  (who \nare considered to be doing their best in difficult circumstances) but a high level of dissatisfaction \nwith  many  specific  aspects  of  the  current  education.  Parents  are  primarily  concerned  with  the \nhigh  costs  of  education,  the  poor  physical  facilities  in  schools,  and  the  risks  to  student  health \nand welfare of unheated schools in winter with outdoor toilet and washing facilities. Students are \nuncertain of the relevance of the curriculum, apprehensive about future job opportunities, dislike \nthe work burden of an overloaded curriculum, and unsatisfied with teachers who are unskilled in \nICT  and  new  technologies.  Increasing  costs  of  higher  education  imply  less  access;  this  is \nbecoming a growing concern of students in schools. Teachers are concerned by poor working \nconditions;  lack  of  teaching  and  learning  resources;  heavy  work  burden  of  the  student  rating \nsystem; and lack of clear career opportunities, particularly for women. All of these issues have \nan  impact  on  attitudes  to  education  in  the  community.  They  do  not  yet  seem  to  add  up  to \nwidespread  disenchantment  with \nthe  system,  although  many  complaints  and  much \ndissatisfaction have been voiced over specific problems.  \n \nStudent attendance problems may be viewed as an indicator of decreasing demand for \n17. \neducation,  although  precisely  assessing  the  exact  level  of  absenteeism  overall  and  in  specific \nregions  is  difficult.7  The  main  causes  of  absenteeism  are  believed  to  be  the  high  costs  of \neducation to poor parents. These costs include (i) parental contributions; (ii) opportunity costs of \nalternatives  to  education  (income-generating  work  outside  schools);  and  (iii)  costs  and  time \ninvolved in student travel to school in some rural areas, and unwelcoming school conditions in \nwinter. Absenteeism is widely seen as a particular problem of poor families in rural areas. \n \nThe  transition  from  an  11-year  to  a  12-year  secondary  education  system  may  also \n18. \ninadvertently affect demand for education. Many students and parents would prefer to maintain \nthe  existing  11-year  system  and  to  complete  their  secondary  education  in  the  same  school, \nrather than transfer to another school after grade 9. Although progression rates from grade 9 to \ngrade 10 are high, schools report that the additional traveling time and costs incurred in shifting \nto specialized senior secondary schools could be a burden for poor students in rural areas. This \ncould  affect  their  decision  to  continue  schooling  past  grade  9,  despite  the  fact  that  a  large \nmajority of students would probably prefer to stay on at school. \n \n\n                                                 \n6   Under  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance,  180  focus  group  interviews  and  discussions  were  conducted \n\nwith teachers, students, and parents separately in over 60 schools in all regions of the country.  \n\n7   According to estimates by the World Bank\u2019s Public Expenditure Review 2004, attendance is at about  70%,  while \nofficial figures from MOPE give a rate of over 99%. Field work under the project preparatory technical assistance \nsuggests a rate in between the two figures.  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n31 \n\nGovernment  Strategy  and  Policy  Framework.  Education  has  been  a  high  priority  in \n19. \nthe Government\u2019s reform agenda and development strategy. Its overall strategic objective has \nbeen  to  make  the  education  system  more  responsive  and  relevant  to  the  requirements  of  a \nmarket economy and democratic society in the 21st century. In pursuit of this objective, a major \nprogram of education reform was launched in 1997 with the passing of a new education law and \nthe  adoption  of  the  National  Program  for  Personnel  Training.8  The  program  identified  basic \neducation  as  one  of  the  principal  areas  of  reform  but  concentrated  on  restructuring  and \nstrengthening  senior  secondary  and  vocational  education  during  the  first  and  second  program \nstages.9  Since  then  numerous  presidential  decrees  and  government  resolutions  have  been \nissued  to  guide  program  implementation.  Budget  allocations  for  education  expenditure  have \nrisen  since  2000,  which  stands  at  8.4%  of  gross  domestic  product  in  2005  and  is  forecast  to \ncontinue to rise.  \n \n20. \nThe unveiling of the National Program for Basic Education Development  2004\u20132009 in \n2004 reaffirms the high priority accorded to basic education and redirects substantial resources \nfor implementing the program including the establishment of the School Development Fund as \nan extrabudgetary fund to finance the National Program for Basic Education Development. The \nprogram aims to overhaul the school system focusing on (i) upgrading poor physical conditions \nand providing key inputs including computer facilities, laboratory equipment, and sport facilities; \n(ii)  improving  all  curricula  and  syllabuses;  (iii)  improving  teaching  methodologies  and  teaching \ntraining system; and (vi) supporting schools in poor and remote areas.  \n \n21. \nThe impetus for ICT development was launched by a presidential speech in Parliament \nin  May  2001.  The  Presidential  Degree  of  30  May  2002,  On  Further  Development  of \nComputerization and Introduction of Information and Communication Technologies, established \nthe strategic framework for national ICT development including creating a national ICT Steering \nCommittee \nthe  Programme  of  Further \nDevelopment  of  Computerization  and \nInformation  and  Communication \nTechnologies for the Period 2002\u2013201011 confirmed the policy directions and basic education as \na priority sector for ICT development. Funding for the initial investment in hardware and systems \nin  basic  education  (estimated  at  around  $120  million  over  the  next  5  years)  will  come  largely \nfrom  the  School  Development  Fund  but  the  Government  is  in  negotiations  with  development \npartners to fund additional hardware provision to the subsector within the next few years. \n \n22. \nStrategy  and  Assistance  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  Other \nDevelopment Agencies. Consistent with ADB country strategy, basic education is a key area \nof  focus  of  ADB  assistance,  and  ADB  is  the  lead  provider  of  financial  assistance  in  basic \neducation  in  Uzbekistan.  ADB\u2019s  sector  strategy  in  education  has  focused  on  (i)  supporting \nefforts  to  improve  quality,  relevance,  and  access  to  education;  and  (ii)  enhancing  national \ncapacity  to  manage  sector  reforms.12  Accordingly,  policy  dialogue  and  assistance  in  basic \neducation  have  focused  on  addressing  key  issues  and  challenges  of  the  subsector.  ADB  has \nprovided five loans since 1997.  \n\nimplementation.10  The  promulgation  of \n\nIntroduction  of \n\nfor \n\nits \n\n                                                 \n8   The Constitution of Uzbekistan guarantees free basic education to all citizens.  \n9   Major areas of reform identified by the National Program for Personnel Training include (i) improve preschools and \nbasic education; (ii) rationalize senior secondary and vocational education; (iii) improve educational management \nand financing; and (iv) establish an effective personnel training system. The three stages of implementation begin \nwith the first stage from 1997\u20132001, second from 2002\u20132005, and third from 2006\u20132010. \n\n10  Uzbek Agency of Communication and Information (UzACI) is the executive for the steering committee. \n11  Cabinet of Ministers Decree 200 of 6 June 2002 plus numerous later attachments. \n12  This  approach  was  commended  in  a  recent  independent  evaluation  of  ADB\u2019s  country  program  and  operations  in \n\nUzbekistan.  \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nimpact \n\nTo date, ADB\u2019s assistance has constituted overall comprehensive support to implement \n23. \nreforms  in  the  education  sector.  This  includes  (i)  establishing  an  overall  coherent  policy \nframework for the sector, which is the focus of the Education Sector Development Program; (ii) \nimproving governance, education financing and sector reform management, which is woven into \nall  ADB  projects;  (iii)  continuing  curriculum  and  assessment  improvement,  which  is  a  focus  of \nthe  Second  Textbook  Development  Project;13  (iv)  strengthening  capacity  of  teachers  and  the \nteacher  training  system,  which  is  a  priority  of  both  the  Education  Sector  Development \nProgram;14 and the Project; (v) meeting critical investment needs in learning materials especially \ntextbooks,  school  libraries,  and  ICT  facilities,  which  is  a  key  activity  in  all  projects;  and  (vi) \nsupporting  the  poor  and  disadvantaged,  which  is  a  focus  of  all  projects.  Technical  assistance \nfrom ADB has complemented and supplemented this effort, in particular in the area of institution \nand capacity development.  \n \nADB  has  maintained  close  coordination  with  other  development  partners  to  strengthen \n24. \ndevelopment \nthrough  complementary  programs  and  activities.  A  development \ncoordination  matrix  is  in  Appendix  6.  German  Development  Assistance  Fund  (GTZ)  provides \nsupport to the development of vocational education and training. Under its technical assistance \nfor  the  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States  program,  the  European  Union  provides \nassistance  to  the  restructuring  of  the  education  system,  which  covers  education  planning, \nfinancing,  and  management  systems,  with  a  particular  focus  on  vocational  and  higher \neducation. The Japanese government focuses its assistance on training of teachers, equipment \nprovision, and printing textbooks for improving vocational education.  \n \n25. \nIn  basic  education,  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  and  the  United  Nations \nEducation,  Science  and  Cultural  Organization  (UNESCO)  are  conducting  a  monitoring  of \nlearning achievements with results due out in August 2005. This will be a timely and useful step \nin  improving  data  on  learning  outcomes  in  basic  education.  The  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme has assisted Uzbekistan in preparing a national strategy for ICT development. The \nUnited  States  Agency  for  International  Development  has  two  ongoing  projects:  one  is \nstrengthening  learning  and  teaching,  management,  and  participation  at  school  levels;  and  the \nother focusing on piloting ICT in schools. The World Bank is preparing its first education project \nfor  supporting  learning materials  development  for  school  libraries,  teacher  training,  community \nparticipation,  and  school  management.  ADB  has  consulted  with  all  of  them  in  preparing  the \nProject.  Some  bilateral  partners  provide  support  in  vocational  and  higher  education.  The \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China recently concluded an agreement to provide a loan of $19 million to \nUzbekistan in support of the ICT in basic education program. Given the continued progress in \neducation  reform  and  increased  presence  of  external  partners,  and  consistent  with  the  Paris \nDeclaration,  ADB  has  resumed  its  proactive  and  lead  role  in  aid  coordination.  This  will  be \nsupported  by  more  staff  and  other  resources  to  ensure  that  effective  coordination  will  benefit \nUzbekistan in the form of reduced transaction costs and increased efficiency.  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n13  ADB.  2004.

Pedagogical  colleges,  previously  responsible  for  the  training  of \nprimary  school  teachers,  are  now  exclusively  responsible  for  training  preschool  teachers  and \nteachers  of  \"special\u201d  subjects  (e.g.,  music,  gymnastics,  and  art).  The  38  pedagogical  colleges \nare planned to be reduced to only 25 by the end of 2005. \n \n2. \nPrimary  and  secondary  preservice  training  is  now  provided  by  five  pedagogical \ninstitutes,  16  faculties  of  pedagogy,  and  the  Tashkent  Pedagogical  University.  Of  these,  the \npedagogical  institutes  and  the  Pedagogical  University  generally  provide  teachers  for  general \nsecondary  education  and  the  faculties  of  pedagogy  provide  teachers  for  the  specialized \nsecondary schools (the academic lyceums and professional colleges). The Government wishes \nto  increase  the  enrolment  capacity  of  the  faculties  of  pedagogy  to  ensure  sufficient  senior \nsecondary teachers for the 12-year educational system, when it becomes compulsory in 2010. \n \nB. \n \nThe National Program for Personnel Training requires all teachers to have at least a first \n3. \ndegree.  Most  secondary  school  teachers  meet  this  requirement  but  many  primary  school \nteachers (66,000 or 54% of the total in 2003) do not. Most of these teachers work in rural areas \nand  a  high  proportion  are  women  who  find  retraining  difficult  to  achieve  given  their  family \ncommitments.  Approximately  15%  of  these  teachers  are  attempting  to  upgrade  their \nqualifications via correspondence courses or distance education \n \n4. \nAlthough teacher supply is considered to be satisfactory, shortages are experienced in \nforeign  languages  and  in  mathematics  and  science  in  minority  language  schools.  Preservice \nteacher training curricula and syllabi need to be revised to provide for new methodological skills \n(student-centered and activity-based learning) and to support the reform shift away from factual \naccumulation to the development of skills and higher order thinking.  \n \nC. \n \n5. \nThe current in-service training (INSETT) system operates at two levels: (i) the provision \nof residential courses at 16 oblast-based regional in-service teacher training institutes (RITTIs). \nOne RITTI specializes in preschools; the A Avloni Institute in Tashkent is responsible for training \nschool directors, oblast and raion management staff, and oblast and raion methodologists. The \ncourses  are  demand  driven  by  requests  from  schools  to  the  raions;  the  requests  are \nconsolidated  and  passed  to  oblasts,  where  they  are  again  consolidated  and  passed  to  the \nMinistry of Public Education (MOPE). MOPE scrutinizes the annual requirement and, based on \nbudget availability, creates an annual INSETT program for each RITTI. The A Avloni Institute in \nTashkent  is  generally  responsible  for  course  development,  and  Avloni  designed  courses  are \nsent  to  each  RITTI,  which  can  amend  or  adapt  the  core  courses  for  their  own  purposes  as \nrequired. All INSETT training in the RITTIs is residential; course duration is generally from 2\u20134 \nweeks. Ordinary teachers are allocated 4 weeks of residential in-service training every 5 years \nin  a  speciality  of  their  choice  (or  one  agreed  with  the  raion  methodologists).  Methodologists, \nschool  directors,  and  oblast/raion  management  staff  are  allocated  4  weeks  of  residential  in-\nservice  training  every  3  years;  (ii)  at  the  school  level,  every  teacher  is  paid  on  the  basis  that \n20%  of  their  working  time  will  be  allocated  to  continuous  professional  development  (CPD) \n\nIn-Service Teacher Training \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n35 \n\nactivities.  In  general,  every  teacher  is  required  to  spend  1  day  a  week  on  CPD  activities.  In \nreality,  this  now  often  takes  the  form  of  lesson  preparation,  marking  students\u2019  work,  or \ncompleting  the  paperwork  required  for  the  current  student  rating  system.  Because  operational \nbudgets  in  schools  and  raions/oblasts  have  deteriorated,  the  majority  of  teachers  probably  no \nlonger  engage  in  meaningful  CPD  activities  on  a  weekly  basis.1  The  teacher  focus  group \ninterviews  in  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  school  survey  suggest  that  many \nteachers  feel  the  need  for  far  more  upgrading  than  they  currently  receive,  particularly  on  ICT, \nstudent-centred and individual learning, higher order thinking skills, etc. \n  \n6. \nThe RITTIs are funded by the MOPE budget. A Avloni will receive an annual budget in \n2004/05 of around $0.5 million. This budget is supposed to cover staff salaries (63 permanent \nstaff), course development and printing costs, utilities and maintenance, other operational costs, \ntransport for trainees, and subsistence and accommodation for trainees. In 2004/05 A Avloni will \nprovide approximately 18,000 person-weeks of training to 4,500 trainees. Thus the approximate \nunit cost of 1 week of residential training at the A Avloni ITTI is approximately $28 per person \nper  week.  A  Avloni  also  houses  the  Distance  Education  Development  Centre  funded  by  the \nEducation  Sector  Development  Program  (ESDP).2  The  RITTIs  are  basically  trainers.  The  A \nAvloni  in-service  teacher  training  institute  is  a  course  developer  and  a  trainer.  None  of  the \nRITTIs  consider  themselves  to  be  inspectors  and  quality  control  over  the  training  is  not \nexercised by the RITTIs but by MOPE.  \n \n7. \nMOPE estimates that 75\u201380% of the RITTIs have modern computer rooms. A Avloni, for \nexample,  has  five  classrooms  each  with  10  Pentium  I  machines.  The  ESDP  will  upgrade \nequipment in the RITTI computer facilities. \n \nD. \n \n8. \nThe current system of INSETT is widely considered to be unsatisfactory for the current \ndemands  from  the  education  system3  for  the  following  reasons:  it  is  (i)  inflexible;  (ii)  too \ncentralized; (iii) poorly targeted; (iv) infrequent; and (v) residential, which is a problem for many \nwomen teachers who also have families to look after, particularly in poor rural areas, and who \nwould prefer to have training closer to home and more flexibly delivered. The INSETT system \nneeds to be adjusted to become more flexible; closer to schools; more responsive to a rapidly \nchanging  education  environment  and  the  new  demands  placed  upon  teachers  by  MOPE \npolicies, in line with the personal and professional skills required by teachers, students, schools, \nand parents; and much more highly prioritized and targeted on the key skills needed to support \nreform.  Ideally,  a  revitalized  and  redirected  INSETT  system  should  also  provide  incentives  for \nteachers by providing salary premiums for the achievement of high priority courses/skills \n \n9. \nSchool-based CPD, while conceptually excellent, is failing because of a lack of allocated \nbudgets  to  provide  a  comprehensive,  high-quality  program;  and  lack  of  school-based  training \nand  development  activities  and  facilities,  which  are  in  line  with  current  teacher  needs.  Most \n\nIssues \n\n                                                 \n1  A few teachers have reported that INSETT costs at raion/oblast level have been deducted from their salaries. \n2   ADB.  2002.

Manila.  \n\n \n\n3  The need to adjust and rethink INSETT via the RITTI system is implicit in the objectives of the ESDP. The rector of \nthe  A  Avloni  ITTI  also  believes  that  current  INSETT  is  too  centralized,  too  irregular,  and  too  inflexible  and  that \nreforms are overdue. He argues however that the basic RITTI system should be retained but should be made more \nresponsive  to  the  needs  of  schools  and  teachers.  The  concept  of  the  school  clusters  restores  the  continuous \nprofessional development capacity of the system at the school level and should not affect the reforms in INSETT \ncurrently under way via the ESDP. \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nraion methodologists themselves require intensive training in many of the new skills, and most \nteachers  are  not  in  a  position  to  develop  appropriate  skills  in  other  teachers.  MOPE  also \nconsiders that suitably qualified, appropriately skilled staff are lacking in many of the RITTIs and \nthat intensive programs of inspection, training, and recruitment are necessary. \n \n10.  Meetings  with  the  Teacher  Education  Department  in  MOPE  confirm  that  MOPE  is \nconcerned  by  current  variations  in  training  quality  between  different  RITTIs.  A  new  MOPE \nresolution  is  in  preparation,  which  will  send  teams  of  inspectors  to  each  RITTI  to  report  on \nquality and performance and to recommend improvements. A recent inspection of the Khorezm \nin-service teacher training institute comprised  two representatives from MOPE, two from other \nRITTIs,  and  one  oblast  deputy  director  of  education.  A  RITTI  rectors  council  meets  every  2 \nmonths, chaired by the first deputy minister of education. It provides a forum for raising issues of \nconcern.  \n \n11.  MOPE  considers  that  variations  in  INSETT  quality  within  the  RITTI  system  have  the \nfollowing  causes:  (i)  lack  of  suitably  trained  staff  (only  10%  of  RITTI  staff  have  higher \nqualifications;  34%  are  basically  qualified  while  56%  are  considered  to  be  underqualified);  (ii) \nRITTI staff are themselves in urgent need of training and upgrading; (iii) a number of the oblast \nRITTIs  have  substandard  facilities;  and  (iv)  inadequate  operational  budgets  tend  to  operate \nagainst the consistent delivery of high quality in-service teacher training. \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nComponents  \nA.

Capacity Building and \nManagement Support \n\n \n\n1. The curriculum and assessment review components of the STDP are fundamental to the long term success of ICTBEP because they \nwill have to achieve changes in the state education standards and in testing, which will enable ICT to be used effectively in learning and \nteaching. These changes include revised learning objectives and attainment targets, a shift away from factual recall toward the \ndevelopment of skills and competencies, a reduction in the number of subjects and the level of content required by the current state \neducation standards, and the introduction of some degree of continuous assessment to support the development of practical skills and \noutputs. \n2. The curriculum and assessment reviews will have a particular impact on the teacher education components of both the Education \nSector Development Program (ESDP) and ICTBEP because they will require different methodological and pedagogic skills from teachers. \nThus the teacher education components of the ESDP and ICTBEP will need to liaise closely with the Second Textbook Development \nProject (STDP) over short- and long-term implications for teacher training. \n3. LOI review could have an impact on teacher education components and on the requirement for learning materials and textbook \ndevelopment and provision strategies. \n \n1.

The textbook evaluation \nsystem specifies what MOPE \nwants to see in textbooks. Thus \nthe teacher training component \nof the ESDP and ICTBEP should \nliaise with the textbook \nevaluation objectives of the \nSTDP. \n2.

Lack of coordination between development partners and \nGOM has led to confusion in the development of ICT for \nbasic education. \n2. Lack of clear strategy has permitted lack of aid \ncoordination and contributed to ineffective implementation.  \n3. ICT development has focused on hardware rather than \neducation; no clear learning objectives are associated with \nthe provision of ICT. \n4. Hardware has been supplied to schools without ensuring \nthat schools are e-ready. This has led to widespread non- or \nunderusage (e.g., supplying hardware to schools without \nelectricity). \n5. ICT provision has not taken into account medium- and \nlong-term financial sustainability; concerns are that current \nhardware cannot be replaced except by further aid support. \n6. Insufficient provision has been made for recurrent costs \nso that many installations are not used because of lack of \nrecurrent budgets \n7. Lack of equity\u2014hardware tends to be supplied to richer, \nurban schools; rural, poor schools are neglected \n8. ICT usage has focused on delivery of a very academic \nand theoretical informatics syllabus, with no concept of the \nuse of ICT as a teaching and learning tool across all \ncurriculum subjects. Thus, the major benefits associated \nwith ICT in basic education are not being delivered.  \n9. Little attention has been given to the development of \nappropriate educational software in local languages. \n10. Teacher training in ICT usage in schools has been \nineffective because the educational objectives of ICT \nprovision have no clear guidelines. \n\n1 and 2. Project preparation involved close coordination \nwith the Government on the development of a national \nICT strategy for basic education, which will provide a \nframework for all aid interventions and will thus avoid the \npitfalls of poor aid coordination. \n3. MOPE policy was originally focused on hardware, but \nthis has changed as a result of preparation and \ndevelopment of a national strategy. Educational objectives \nare now clearly predominant. \n4. All ADB project investment will require evidence of e-\nreadiness prior to installation and a check-list of e-\nreadiness requirements has already been developed. \n5. A major part of the ICT strategy is the development of \nmedium- and long-term financial projections for ICT \nprovision; the Project requires assurances from the \nGovernment and MOF on these issues. \n6. Detailed recurrent budget projections have been made \nand assurances sought from GOU/MOF that all schools \nwith ICT installations will have adequate recurrent budget \nprovision to ensure full usage. \n7. The Project will ensure that 70% of CLSs are from poor \nand rural areas. The cluster school network will be \nnational and fully include poor and rural schools and \nGovernment/MOF assurances on the provision of \nrecurrent budgets will ensure that poor schools will have \nfunding to fully utilize the ICT provided. \n8. The Project is clearly focused on the use of ICT as a \nteaching and learning tool across the curriculum and not \njust on the delivery of informatics.  \n9. Component 3 of the Project is concerned entirely with \nproviding support for appropriate software development in \nlocal languages. \n10. Teacher training inputs are based on a clear definition \nof the role and function of ICT in basic education. \n1. See note 3.  \n2.

Recurrent budget provision is insufficient to ensure full \nand ongoing use of hardware investments and poorer \nschools are more affected by this than richer schools. \n4. Lack of maintenance and servicing in rural areas has an \nimpact on regular usage of the hardware. \n5. Early evidence indicates that school-based telecenters in \nrural areas are popular with local communities. \n6. The RITTIs are currently developing appropriate software \nin Ukrainian but quality is variable. \n\n3. See note 6.  \n \n \n4. The Project requires assurances from \nGovernment/MOF that funding for maintenance and \nservicing is provided within the school recurrent cost \nbudgets. At least one maintenance and servicing \norganization is located in each oblast. \n5. Experimentation with rural and urban telecenters is a \npart of the Project. \n6. The Project will attempt to ensure higher software \nquality by only providing grants on a competitive basis \nand only for software that meets minimum criteria. \nIntensive training will also be provided to software \ndevelopers in adaptation/translation and in origination \n1. The use of school clusters to bring training and \ncooperative working between teachers close to each \nschool is a central part of the Project. \n2. This has yet to be achieved in Uzbekistan but is an \nobjective of the curriculum review, which is part of the \nSTDP. \n3. No parental contributions to hardware or recurrent \ncosts is required as part of the Project. \n\n1. USAID experience has been incorporated into project \ntraining strategies.  \n2. These benefits have been noted. \n3. USAID recurrent cost estimates have been used by the \nProject to calculate minimum recurrent budget \nrequirements for provision by Government/MOPE. \n4. USAID data was taken into account in cost calculations. \n5. USAID strategies for servicing and maintenance were \nconsidered in project design. \n6.

Curriculum reform and the design of new syllabuses have \nbeen undertaken in the context that ICT will play an \nincreasing role in basic education across all subjects. Thus \nsyllabuses actively support ICT usage in schools. \n3. Parental contributions to the costs of hardware provision \nhave not been successful in poor, rural areas because the \ncontribution levels have been set too high. \n1. Sixty-hour basic ICT skills training module for teachers \nhas been demonstrated to be effective. \n2. ICT provision and connectivity has generated enthusiasm \namong teachers and students and has improved student \nattendance. \n3. Effective and regular ICT usage requires adequate \nrecurrent budgets for schools. \n4. Recurrent costs vary substantially between regions and \nbetween rural and urban schools. \n5.

Membership \nwill be drawn from the COM, Ministry of Public Education (MOPE), Ministry of \nHigher and Senior Secondary Education (MOHSSE), Ministry of Finance (MOF) , \nand Ministry of Economy (MOE), Uzbek Agency for Communication and \nInformation, Uzbektelecom, and Uzbekenergo. The chair will be a senior official \nappointed by the COM. The PSC is responsible for overall project coordination. The \nPSC will meet quarterly to review project status, discuss implementation issues, \nensure coordination among different ministries, resolve issues, provide broad \nguidance, and review and advise on the annual implementation plan.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEducation Reform \nImplementation & \nMonitoring Unit \nThis is the education \nreform monitoring \nunit reporting to the \nCOM \n\nProject Director (a joint appointment with the project directors of other \nprojects) \n\nThe project director will be a MOPE top official responsible for supervising the \nMOPE units that will be most involved in project implementation. The project director \nwill provide general guidance to the PIU on policy issues in accordance with \ndecisions made by the SPC; arrange PSC meetings, present quarterly reports to the \nPSC, and ensure coordination of project implementation within MOPE; be \nresponsible for MOPE policy inputs.  \n\n                     Project Manager\n\nThe project manager will be appointed under the project director and will be \nresponsible for coordinating and supervising the work of the PIU.  \n\n    \n\nProject Implementation Unit\n\n \nThe PIU, which consists of the project manager and staff is responsible for day-to-\nday management of the Project (including finance and overall management). The \nPIU prepares the detailed implementation plan for the Project; annual reports, and \nprogress reports to the PSC and project director. The PIU will be responsible for \nproject implementation, procurement and recruitment, staff development, finance \nand accounting, and monitoring and evaluation. It will require 6\u20138 full-time staff \nwho will be recruited based on past project implementation experience. The \nProject PIU will be established in accordance with the Government\u2019s decision \nrelated to the establishment and financing of the PIU, which will be covered by \nretroactive financing. To ensure timely implementation of the Project, MOPE will \nappoint a project manager before measures for rationalizing project management \nare put in place. The PIU will be established in the same premises as the PIUs of \nthe other two ongoing projects, and will coordinate closely with them across PIU \nfunctions, including sharing of staff where feasible.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fIMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE \n\n Project Activities \n\nPrep \n\nYear 1 \n\nYear 2 \n\nYear 3 \n\nYear 4 \n\nYear 5 \n\n3 \n\n4  1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1  2  3  4  1  2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n1 2 \n\n3 4\n\nAppendix 10 \n\n47 \n\nComponent 1: Establishment of Cluster Leader Schools for ICT \n\nIdentify clusters \nIdentify and confirm the CLSs \n\n1.

The Project will contribute to the following social development outcomes: (i) enable \nstudents  and  educators  to  participate  more  effectively  in  the  knowledge-based  economy  by  virtue  of  enhanced \nproblem-solving skills, improved capacity to study independently, ability to work with information, and ability to apply \nkey  skills  in  real  job  settings;  (ii)  support  the  creation  of  new  electronic  materials  that  help  the  teachers  to  shift  to a \nstudent-centered  learning  environment  in  which  teachers  play  a  learning  facilitator  role;  (iii)  ensure  that  all  students \nhave access to quality educational materials through e-learning and support conditions for equal access to      (ICT) \nwith  enhanced  education  services  based  on  ICT;  (iv)  develop  teacher  and  education  management  capacity  to \nincorporate  new  educational  technology  into  teaching  practice,  produce  learning  materials,  and  use  ICT-based \nmanagement system; and (v) improve the existing     (INSETT) system to be closer to users, more flexible, and more \nfrequent, thus more effective. \n \nThe  Project  will  have  a  direct  beneficial  impact  on  about  130,000  poor  students  in  grades  5\u20139  enrolled  in  the  700 \nduring 2006\u20132011.1 Specific pro-poor measures of the Project include (i) having about 70% of the 860 CLSs from poor \nschools; (ii) improved power supply to all schools,  which will ensure proper  working of the ICT facilities installed, as \nwell as meet general lighting and heating needs during the winter;2 (iii) pilot testing connectivity especially for rural and \nremote areas; (iv) facilitating access to rural teachers, students, and local communities; and (v) opening ICT facilities \nin  schools  to  local  communities,  which  will  benefit  an  estimated  1  million  households.  The  Project  will  provide  ICT \nfacilities and internet connections to all schools, rich and poor, urban and rural. This is pro-poor since it will help bridge \nthe  internal  digital  divide.  The  Project  will  address  the  issue  of  increasing  parental  contributions,  which  burdens  the \npoor disproportionately, by ensuring that the full costs of ICT in schools are borne by the public sector with no parental \ncontributions required for ICT use in schools.  \n \nIn  2000  Uzbekistan  signed  the  Dakar  Framework  for  Action  and  in  2003  published  the  National  Action  Plan  for \nEducation  for  All.  The  action  plan  supports  the  basic  principle  of  inclusion  and  integration  of  children  with  special \nneeds  into  the  general  education  system. The  Department  for  Special  Education  of  the  Ministry  of  Public  Education \nsubmitted a draft resolution to the Government at the end of March 2005 aiming to provide a formal policy framework \nand  strategy  for  enhancing  education  quality  and  conditions  for  children  with  special  needs.  The  Project  will  pilot \ninclusive  education  through  (i)  public  education  and  awareness  campaign,  and  policy  dialogue;  (ii)                  (CLSs)  to \ninclude training and e-materials for children with special needs; and (iii) linking the pilot project with other related Asian \nDevelopment Bank projects such as RITTI course development activities under the ESDP and provision of teaching \nmaterials i.e., Braille textbooks to schools under the STDP. \n \nThe incorporation of ICT into the schools can greatly benefit community involvement in school activities. The school \nwill  provide  the  possibility  for  parents  to  gain  access  to  technology  and  training.  Hence,  the  schools  with  ICT  can \nbecome part of larger initiatives to offer technology access to communities, particularly in rural areas. Up to 1 million \nhouseholds are expected to be able to access ICT via community access schemes such as a telecenters or school-\nbased internet cafes.  \n \nB. \n \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe World Bank Living Standard Assessment (2003) shows that an estimated 27.5% of the population or 6.8 million \npeople  live  at  or  below  the  poverty  line.  Of  these,  approximately  one  third  or  2.3  million  people  are  classified  as \nextremely poor.  Poverty is significantly higher in rural than in urban areas  (30.5% versus 22.5%) and 69% of the poor   \n \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention  \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1   This assumes that 27% of the students on average are from poor families, a poverty indicator based on the Living \n\nStandard Assessment of the World Bank 2003.  \n\n2   Lack of heating in winter is cited as one reason that some parents do not let their children go to school in winter.  \n\n \n\nA. \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n \nand  72%  of  the  extreme  poor  are  found  in  rural  Uzbekistan.  Poverty  is  also  associated  with  specific  regions.  Thus \npoverty  is  relatively  low  in  the  Tashkent  region  (9.2%)  and  relatively  very  high  in  Kashkadarya  (62.6%)  and  in \nKarakalpakstan (36.4%). This is partly the  result of environmental factors but also of a bias in public policy that has \nallocated far more public investment, credit, subsidies, and other scarce resources to the urban areas  while broadly \nneglecting rural areas.3 \n \nThe  survey  of  30  makhallas  (communities)  during  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  shows  that  the \nincidence  of  poverty  also  has  remarkable  regional  contrast  within  oblasts. The  incidence  of  economically  vulnerable \nfamilies  varied  from  97%  in  one  makhallas  in  Yosobon  raion,  Fergana  oblast  to  2%  in  Shaykhantokhur  raion  in \nTashkent  City.  Within  Fergana  oblast  two  raions  recorded  the  incidence  of  economically  vulnerable  families  at  7%, \nwhile  the  third  estimated  at  97%.  However,  a  high  proportion  of  the  poor  in  Uzbekistan  tend  to  be  rich  in  human \ncapital. Thus most have at least 9 years of education. The survey indicates that poor households are distinguished by \nthe following features: (i) high unemployment or underemployment, (ii) minimum educational qualifications, (iii) more \nthan  three  children  per  family,  (iv)  reduced  access  to  land  of  good  quality,  and  (v)  less  integrated  into  the  market \neconomy. \n \nPoverty and social assessments were carried out to inform project design. They revealed the following: (i) inequality \nand inequity in access (digital divide) in the regions from geographic perspective: between rural and urban schools \nand between rich and poor schools and households; (ii) access to ICT is very limited both in urban and rural schools, \nwhich hinders future generations of Uzbek students from have the necessary skills to participate fully in the knowledge \neconomy; (iii) demand for parental contribution for ICT could be a severe financial problem for the poor; (iv) \ndecentralization of the education budget\u2014only 5 of 14 oblasts are self sufficient in taxation and the central budget is \nused as a safety net to provide support for oblasts that cannot balance their budgets; (v) lack of infrastructure such as \nreliable power supplies, nonsecure wiring from computer installation, and 82% of schools have never seen or used a \nmodern IBM compatible computer; and (vi) lack of teachers\u2019 knowledge on use of ICT. \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nThe  main  stakeholder  groups  are  students,  teachers,  education  managers  (both  administrators  within  the  education \nsystem and policymakers), teacher educators, developers of learning materials, private sector groups dealing in ICT, \nteacher  educators  both  preservice  and  in-service,  parent-teacher  associations,  and  communities.  During  the  project \ndesign  and  preparation  phase,  stakeholders  participated  as  members  of  working  groups  to  design  various \ncomponents,  and  participated  in  workshops  and  in  preparing  implementation  plans.  Three  national  workshops,  180 \nfocus group discussions in all 14 regions of the country, which involved over 40 makhallas and 60 schools, were held \nduring the preparation phase. The project design also involved consultations  with nongovernment organizations and \nother civil society organizations.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nNational  public  campaign  to  ensure  that  all  stakeholders  especially  teachers,  parents,  students,  educators, \npolicymakers,  private  sector,  and  civil  society  organizations  are  fully  informed  will  be  conducted  during  project \nimplementation.  The  campaign  will  be  launched  to  complement  the  National  Conference  on  ICT  in  Basic  Education \nscheduled  for  November  2005,  with  regular  updates  on  progress  of  implementation  throughout  the  first  2  years  of \nproject implementation.  \n \n \nD.

Universal \naccess to basic primary and secondary school education (grades 1\u20139) has been maintained, and the literacy rate is \nalmost 100% for men and women. According to the Household Baseline Survey (2001/02) data, approximately 92% of \nmen and 93%  of  women in the 25\u201334  year-old  age  group  had some upper secondary  or higher levels  of schooling. \nThe interim Report on Welfare Improvement Strategy of the Republic of Uzbekistan (2005) showed that the enrolment \nrates between  boys and  girls  (90.9%  of boys and  90.5% of girls) are equal. However, the  quality of education  at all \nlevels of education is not being maintained. \n \n\n                                                 \n3   Corniaga. 2003.

The  Project  will  ensure  that \ngirls and boys have equal access to all required learning e-materials and ICT. The improved INSETT system, which is \ncloser to schools and more flexible, will benefit at least 12,600 women teachers who account for 70% of the teaching \nforce in CLSs, with far more women of teachers in the school system to be benefited during the life of the Project. In \naddition  other  issues  with  gender  implications  to  be  monitored  include  analysis  of  education  materials  for  gender \nbiases and stereotyping women. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nE.

The Project will not require any \nland acquisition and relocation.  \n\n \nSchools generally lack resources for effective and \nsustainable ICT use. The problem may be worse for \nsmaller and rural schools. The Government will provide \nbudgets to ensure that the full range of ICT services can \nbe provided for the full period of the Project without the \nrequirement for parental contribution. The Government \nwill ensure provision of adequate operational, recurrent, \nand replacement budgets for all schools with ICT \ninstallations. The clustering concept will also ensure that \nthe necessary support services are made available to \nevery school in the country.  \n \nThe Project has no negative impact on labor market or \nretrenchment. Social safeguards on labor issues are not \napplicable for the Project. \n\n \nSmall print run adaptations and translations for learning \nmaterials for students of other local languages of \ninstruction (LOI)\u2014including Karakalpak,  Kazakh, Korean, \nKyrgyz, Russian, Tajik, and  Turkmen\u2014is relatively \nexpensive. The Project will provide cheaper, faster, and \neasier versions of software and e-leaning materials in \nother LOI. By increasing availability of learning materials \nin other LOI, the Project will enhance access and equity \nfor education directly for about 45,000 students of other \nlocal LOIs in the CLSs through equal access to ICT \nfacilities. The creation of learning materials under the \nProject will have a positive impact on all minority students, \namounting to about 660,000 in the entire school system. \n\n Full \n\n Short \n\n None \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n \n\n Significant \n\n \n\n Not significant \n\n None   \n\n \n\nThe Project addresses the need of vulnerable children for \ninclusive education.
