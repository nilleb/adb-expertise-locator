THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed \nadministration of a grant to be provided by  the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction to the \nRepublic of Vanuatu for the Cyclone Pam School Reconstruction Project.1 \n \n2.  The  project  will  support  the  Government  of  Vanuatu  in  accelerating  recovery  and \nrehabilitation in the wake of the devastating Cyclone Pam in March 2015. The project will \nsupport the rebuilding of junior secondary schools in Tafea Province with \u201cbuild back better\u201d \nconcepts to strengthen resilience to future disasters and climate change risks, and prepare \nschools and communities for climate and disaster risk management.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Disaster risk in Vanuatu. According to the World Risk Report, Vanuatu ranks highest in \nthe World Risk Index because of its exposure to geophysical and hydrometeorological hazards, \nand its limited financial and technical capacities to prepare for and respond to the associated \nrisks. 3 Vanuatu is an archipelago of 83 volcanic islands, and is geographically located in the \nPacific Ring of Fire and at the center of the Pacific cyclone belt. This results in a relatively high \nfrequency of volcanic eruptions, cyclones, earthquakes, tsunamis, storm surges, coastal and \nriver flooding, and landslides. In addition, the country suffers from extreme events associated \nwith climate variability, such as sea-level and temperature extremes and droughts. Climate \nchange will drive changes in intensity and frequency of weather hazards and thereby heighten \ndisaster risks. For Vanuatu, the frequency and intensity of extreme weather rainfall events are \nprojected to increase in the future, and so will the intensity of cyclones.4 \n \n4.  Description of emergency. On 12\u201314 March 2015, category 5 tropical Cyclone Pam \nstruck 22 islands of Vanuatu, leaving behind significant damage. The storm brought down the \ncommunication  systems  linking  the  islands,  which  hampered  initial  efforts  to  obtain  a \ncomprehensive understanding of the full scale of the disaster impacts. Eleven fatalities were \nsubsequently confirmed in Tafea and Shefa provinces. The cyclone also damaged or destroyed \n17,000  buildings,  including  houses,  schools,  clinics,  and  medical  facilities.  It  displaced  an \nestimated  65,000  people  who  needed  temporary  shelter,  and  affected  more  than  34,600 \nschoolchildren. It destroyed crops on a large scale, and compromised the livelihoods of at least \n80% of Vanuatu\u2019s rural population. Severe and widespread damage was worst on the larger \nislands of Tanna, Erromango, and Efate (which is also home to the capital city of Port Vila). \n \n5.  The government, international community, and nongovernment organizations responded \nquickly to provide immediate relief. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a $1 million \ngrant from the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund on 20 March 2015.5 \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Junior secondary schooling covers years 7\u201310. \n3  United  Nations  University,  Institute  for  Environment  and  Human  Security.  2014.

Assessment  of  the  damage  and  needs. The government initiated a post disaster \nneeds assessment (PDNA) supported by multilateral development partners such as ADB and \nthe World Bank, the governments of Australia and New Zealand, the United Nations, and other \ninternational development organizations. The PDNA covered damage and losses in all key \nsectors.6 Preliminary estimates of direct damage and losses caused by the cyclone ran to about \n$441.35  million,  equivalent  to  64.1%  of  Vanuatu\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (footnote  6). \nAccording to the PDNA, Tafea and Shefa provinces suffered the most. By sector, the social \nsector  sustained  the  brunt  of  total  damage\u2014mainly  private  housing  (32%)  and  education \n(13%)\u2014followed by tourism (20%) and transport (10%).7 Many schools suffered substantial \ndamage amounting to $36.30 million.8 Estimated medium- and long-term recovery needs in the \neducation sector (e.g., schools and associated facilities) total $62.30 million (footnote 6). \n \n7.  International experience shows that poverty rises in regions hit by disasters because \nproductive assets are damaged and economic opportunities shrink in the short and medium \nterm. The incidence of poverty may persist in the long run if emergency and recovery efforts do \nnot restore assets and livelihoods quickly. The cyclone harmed an estimated 40,000 households \nby destroying at least 50% of agriculture crops and limiting their ability to generate income, for \nan estimated loss of $14.56 million. This is also relevant for the social sectors. Immediate action \nis necessary to ensure that children can return to a safe school environment. Studies have \nshown that the longer children are out of school after a disaster, the less likely they are to return \nto school. Education plays a key role in bringing back needed normality and routine after a \ndisaster and provides support to children after such a traumatic experience (footnote 6). \n \n8.  In line with the PDNA findings, the government prepared a  National Recovery and \nEconomic Strengthening Program Plan in June 2015 and organized a high-level workshop with \ndevelopment partners to consult on the recovery plan and discuss its financing.9 A second \nworkshop with partners was held in early August 2015 to discuss any financing gaps that would \nhamper recovery activities. Reconstruction efforts are coordinated through sector cluster groups, \nin  which  development  partners  are  also  members,  depending  on  their  priority  sector. \nConsultation between the development partners is strong. Any new reconstruction project has to \nfollow a government-led and -coordinated process. Project proposals are to be presented to the \nrecovery committee (chaired by the director general of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office), which \ncomprises senior civil servants of line ministries. After positive vetting, the Prime Minister\u2019s \nOffice will need to approve the proposal before it goes to the Ministry of Finance and Economic \nManagement  (MFEM)  for  budgetary  allocation.  This  ensures  that  reconstruction  happens \naccording to the government\u2019s recovery priorities. The government has set itself a 24-month \ndeadline for implementing the reconstruction work. Indicative areas of support are outlined in \nthe emergency assistance coordination.10 \n \n9.  On  25  August  2015,  ADB  received  a  request  from  the  government  for  emergency \nassistance. It was to support Vanuatu\u2019s post cyclone recovery and rehabilitation efforts in the \neducation sector, with an emphasis on school infrastructure. The request clearly aligns with \nADB\u2019s area of experience in the infrastructure sector. It was the first request received, and ADB \nsupport  will  have  a  demonstration  effect  for  other  development  partners  to  follow  in  their \nreconstruction support for Vanuatu. One of the more remote provinces with five islands, Tafea \n                                                \n6  Government of Vanuatu. 2015. Post Disaster Needs Assessment. Port Vila (final draft). \n7  According to the PDNA, private housing and education belong to the social sectors, tourism belongs to the \nproductive sector, and transport belongs to the infrastructure sector. \n8  These are early childhood centers, and primary and secondary schools. \n9  Government of Vanuatu. 2015. National Recovery and Economic Strengthening Program Plan. Port Vila. \n10 Emergency Assistance Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "3 \nProvince was prioritized because it suffered the most damage in the education sector, and \nrehabilitation  will  likely  focus  on  one  island  because  this  would  be  the  most  cost-efficient \nsolution. 11 The province has limited economic opportunities, and most of its inhabitants are \nsubsistence farmers and considered poor and vulnerable. Hence, school education is crucial to \nbuild capacity and opportunities for future employment. Based on its own assessment and in \nconsultation with ADB, the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) initially selected five \njunior secondary schools to be potentially supported through the proposed ADB project.12 The \nlevel of damage, strategic location for community shelters, and the potential for rationalization \nwere taken into consideration so that some schools could be expanded if other schools were \nbeyond repair. The province was not prepared for a disaster of that magnitude. The schools will \ntherefore feature an integrated community shelter to provide a safe place in times of emergency. \n \n10.   The project will support a safer school environment for at least 1,200 schoolchildren. \nThe  project  will  incorporate  lessons  from  recent  disasters  in  Indonesia,  Japan,  and  the \nPhilippines,  and  strengthen  climate  and  disaster  resilience  when  rebuilding  schools.  The \nschools will also have a demonstration effect for other schools in Vanuatu in their ability to \nwithstand disasters and provide temporary shelter to communities during emergencies. The \nproject satisfies all six characteristics of an emergency assistance project by (i) supporting the \nrebuilding  of  high-priority  assets,  (ii)  mitigating  immediate  losses,  (iii)  providing  short-term \nassistance, (iv) targeting priority rehabilitation, (v) complementing other relief efforts, and (vi) not \nbeing a policy-based loan. \n \n11.  The government\u2019s capacity for the build-back-better principle will be further strengthened \nby integrating external design and supervision consultants (DSCs) into MOET\u2019s facilities unit. \nThe project will recruit and finance these experts because MOET has limited technical and \nengineering staff. The project also recognizes the importance of community engagement and \nconsultation with the support of a nongovernment organization familiar with the education sector \nin Vanuatu and with expertise in disaster risk preparedness. The DSCs will be recruited under \nadvance action to expedite the implementation of the project. \n \n12.  The project will be implemented in two phases. Phase 1 involves (i) the finalization of \ndesign and costing, (ii) the preparation of bidding documents for the civil works contract, and \n(iii) community consultation to ensure that community feedback is factored into the final design \nand  costing.  Phase  2  consists  of  (i)  physically  rehabilitating  the  project  schools,  and  (ii) \nstrengthening the capacity of MOET and communities for build-back-better execution, safer \nconstruction, disaster risk reduction and preparedness, and maintenance planning. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact will be accelerated social recovery in Vanuatu\u2019s cyclone-affected provinces. \nThe outcome will be critical education services resumed with disaster-resilient infrastructure. \n \nC.  Outputs \n14.  The project has two outputs: (i) schools in Tafea Province are rebuilt and/or upgraded, \nand (ii) the capacity of communities and MOET management for disaster risk reduction and \ndisaster preparedness is strengthened. The recovery work is to be completed within 24 months. \n                                                \n11 Tanna Island in Tafea Province is the most populated island and experienced the most damage. \n12 Other development partners already support the reconstruction of early childhood centers and primary schools. \nThe support for secondary schools is a complementary fit. \n ", "4 \n \n15.  Output 1: Schools in Tafea Province are rebuilt and/or upgraded. At least five junior \nsecondary  schools  are  rebuilt  and/or  upgraded  to  serve  1,200  school  children.13 School \nreconstruction will be planned to disaster-resilient and climate-proof standards. While the level \nof damage in each school is different, all will benefit from water and sanitation facilities as well \nas  dormitories  that  are gender  inclusive  and  responsive.14 In  addition, the  schools  will  be \ndesigned, or redesigned, to offer the surrounding communities temporary and safe shelter \nduring emergencies.15 The buildings will be equipped with water tanks for rainwater collection, \nemergency power backup, and communication facilities, and store essential supplies that may \nbe accessed immediately in the event of a disaster. Communities will be consulted throughout \nthe design process to ensure ownership of and agreement on proposed school rehabilitation. \n \n16.  Output 2: The capacity of communities and MOET management for disaster risk \nreduction and disaster preparedness is strengthened. MOET staff will be trained on build-\nback-better concepts and standards so it can replicate the model in other locations. Other \ngovernment ministries will also be invited to participate in the training. School disaster risk \nmanagement plans will be established, and school curricula will include information on disaster \npreparedness. MOET staff, schools, and communities will all benefit from greater awareness of \nand training in disaster risk management and disaster preparedness.  Training and information \ncampaigns  will  also  be  carried  out  in  schools  and  surrounding  communities  on  safer \nconstruction techniques and standards as well as school maintenance planning. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n  \n17.  The project is estimated to cost $5.72 million (Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.  Base Costb    \n  1.

The project would restore up to 60% of the pre cyclone enrollment rate in Tafea \nProvince. The junior secondary school enrollment rate in Vanuatu was 15,481 in 2013. \n14 80% of students use dormitory facilities. \n15 Tafea Province has 32,500 inhabitants, of which 28,800 live on Tanna Island (census 2009). The four other islands \nare sparsely populated. The community shelters would provide a safe retreat for about 18,000 people. \n ", "5 \n18.  The Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction will provide grant cofinancing equivalent to $5 \nmillion, to be administered by ADB. The grant will finance (i) civil works and equipment, and (ii) \nconsulting services and capacity building (Table 2).16 The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reductiona  5.00  87.0 \nGovernment of Vanuatu  0.72  13.0 \nTotal  5.72  100.0 \na Administered by the Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  An interministerial recovery committee will guide all of Vanuatu\u2019s reconstruction efforts \nand will be kept informed, but will have no direct involvement in the implementation of the \nproject. The MFEM will be the executing agency and the MOET will be the implementing agency. \nA project management unit (PMU) for the final design and implementation of the project will be \nestablished within the facilities unit in MOET to oversee the day-to-day implementation and \nprogress of the project. The PMU will be managed by a MOET counterpart staff member and \ncomprise a project accountant and DSCs.17 The PMU will be established in advance. The PMU \nmanager will report to the MOET director general. The PMU will coordinate activities with other \ndevelopment  partners  through  the  Education  Sector  Working  Group  and  within  MOET  to \npreempt any overlap or duplication of activities. 18 MOET\u2019s facilities unit will be strengthened \nwith DSCs to support the existing technical and managerial capacities, especially in view of \nbuild-back-better concepts with disaster-resilient and climate-proof standards. The PMU will be \nresponsible for the final design and costing; preparation of tender documents; bill of quantities; \ntendering; contract management and supervision; and day-to-day implementation, including \nfinancial management, monitoring, and evaluation. This will cover safeguards as well as climate \nchange monitoring. The PMU will maintain separate project accounts, which will be audited by \nan independent auditor. \n \n20.  The PMU will be responsible for procuring and administering contracts on behalf of \nMOET. To work within established MOET governance systems, it is suggested to use a similar \nsteering  committee  composition  as  in  the  Vanuatu  Education  Support  Program,19 with  an \nadditional representative from the MFEM.20 This will create synergies in the school rehabilitation \nefforts. \n \n21.  The terms of reference for the required consulting positions are outlined in the project \nadministration  manual  (PAM).21 Given  the  need  for  immediate  mobilization  of  consultants \nbecause of the emergency nature of the project, the DSCs will be recruited through single-\n                                                \n16 The grant may finance local transport, vehicle, furniture, equipment, and insurance costs. \n17 The PMU will further include procurement and safeguards specialists, as detailed in the Project Administration \nManual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 MOET is a member of the Education Sector Working Group. \n19 Funded by the governments of Australia and New Zealand. \n20 The composition will be decided by the director general of MOET in consultation with ADB.

The PAM\u2019s procurement section details the processes to be followed.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n24.  After a detailed damage assessment, five junior secondary schools on Tanna Island, \nTafea  Province,  were  initially  selected  in  consultation  with  MOET.  The  selection  took  into \naccount (i) whether the school is in a strategic location, (ii) whether it is still feasible and cost-\neffective to repair the damage, and (iii) the size of the school and the potential for either \nrationalization or expansion. A climate risk screening considered the project to be at medium \nrisk. A climate and disaster risk and vulnerability assessment for the project components will \ninform the detailed design of the school buildings, to ensure that they will be rehabilitated \nfollowing the build-back-better concept and the standards for resilience to climate change and \ndisaster,  but  appropriate  to  the  local  context.  Capacity for  construction  is  limited  in Tafea \nProvince, especially after Cyclone Pam, and material and expertise will need to be brought from \n                                                \n22 The DSCs will also be responsible for the capacity-building component of the project. \n ", "7 \nelsewhere. However, school staff, communities, and the provincial education department will be \ninvolved to ensure ownership and capacity for maintenance. The final engineering designs will \ninclude measures to mitigate climate and disaster risks and provide safe schools with universal \naccess. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n25.  Given the focus on severely affected areas, the project is likely to bring significant \nbenefits to the population. The economic analysis will not be finalized before project approval \nbut before implementation starts, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance \nPolicy (2004). The analysis will be carried out in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic \nAnalysis of Projects and the 1994 Framework and Criteria for the Appraisal and Socioeconomic \nJustification of Education Projects.23 \n \n26.  Project outputs are public service goods with no cost recovery, hence an assessment of \nthe capacity to finance incremental recurrent costs needs to be performed at project start. \nHistorically, the government has spent little on maintenance (in 2014, 75% of MOET\u2019s budget \nwas for salary expenses of government officials and school teachers, 10% for the school grant \nscheme, and the remainder for scholarships and administrative costs). About 6% of the school \ngrant from the government is used for the maintenance of schools but because maintenance is \nprimarily  left  to  the  school  management  committees,  the  provincial  facilities  supervision \nauthority in Tafea Province has limited scope for full oversight of school maintenance. Junior \nsecondary schools are self-funded and use the government grant scheme, receipt of school \nfees,  and  community  support  to  cover  costs  such  as  maintenance.  This  issue  has  been \ndiscussed  with  the  government  and  is  included  as  an  assurance  covenant  in  the  grant \nagreement. Building the schools back with climate-proof and disaster-resilient features will ease \nthe  strain  on  the  operation  and  maintenance  budget  in  the  first  3\u20135  years.  During \nimplementation, an asset management plan will be prepared to ensure that schools can be \nmaintained in good condition for their economic life. Sufficient resources will be allocated to \nundertake the economic and financial due diligence before implementation. \n \nC.  Governance \n27.  The Government of Australia conducted a financial management assessment of the \neducation sector as well as an assessment of national systems in 2013, as part of the design of \nthe Vanuatu Education Sector Program.24 The assessment was used for the purposes of this \nproject.  It  revealed  several  weaknesses,  especially  in  downstream  government  systems \n(treasury, procurement, accounting, reporting, and auditing), and recommended several risk-\nmitigating measures. In particular, it was decided not to use government processes for the \nVanuatu Education Sector Program. A management contractor was appointed to act as the \nproject implementing unit and to support MOET with additional technical assistance to gradually \nimprove the systems. The overall fiduciary risk is rated high but remains manageable since it \nwill be mitigated by the provision of a dedicated qualified accountant to the PMU, additional \nsupport  from  the  DSCs,  and  simplified  fund-flow  and  payment  procedures.  The  project \nprocurement classification is B. MOET is not yet familiar with ADB\u2019s procurement procedures, \nand the procurement risk is considered high based on a Government of Australia assessment \n                                                \n23 ADB. 1997.

To mitigate any risk, ADB will support the government in precontractual recruitment \nactivities. In addition, the DSCs will include a procurement specialist to support the preparation \nof bidding documents for the civil works contract and assist MOET during the bidding process. \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOET.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 21). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n29.  The project will restore classrooms, dormitories, ablution blocks, and toilets for at least \n1,200 students in Tafea Province, with a focus on user safety and in consultation with affected \ncommunities.  Inbuilt  multipurpose  facilities  will  provide  a  safe  temporary  shelter  during \nemergencies and protect people\u2019s livelihoods in times of disasters. \n \n30.  The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming, and a gender action plan \nhas been prepared.26 It specifies the activities and makes sure that gender is considered during \ndesign and implementation, that women will be engaged during community consultation, and \nthat gender-disaggregated data will be collected. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n31.  Environment. The project is classified as category B for environment. Reconstruction of \nbuildings and facilities at five existing school sites is expected to have limited, only site-specific \nand, in most cases, temporary adverse impacts on the environment, which can be readily \nmitigated and managed through a construction-focused environmental management plan. An \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  was  prepared  for  the  project  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  will  be  posted  on  ADB\u2019s \nwebsite.27 The EARF requires screening and assessment of each school (and preparation of an \nenvironmental management plan for it) in line with the Environment Protection and Conservation \nAct (as amended) 2010, supplemented as required to also comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement. Monitoring will follow the monitoring plan included in the EARF. In line with ADB's \nPublic Communications Policy 2011, information on safeguards will be made available in a \ntimely manner and in a form and language understandable to the affected people and other \nstakeholders. ADB will post the monitoring reports on its website. \n \n32.  Involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  as \ncategory C for both involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples following ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. The project is not expected to involve physical displacement or involuntary \nacquisition of land since the schools are to be rebuilt at their existing sites, which are already \nowned by the government and designated for education purposes. Any project activity that \nwould  require  involuntary  resettlement  or  have  an  impact  on  indigenous  peoples  will  be \nexcluded. The project is not expected to impact any distinct and vulnerable group of indigenous \npeoples.  The  beneficiaries  in  the  project  areas  are  mostly  Melanesians,  native  people  of \nVanuatu. The outputs will be culturally appropriate. \n   \n                                                \n25 Government of Australia. Republic of Vanuatu: Assessment of National Systems.

Risks and Mitigating Measures \n33.  The overall risk is medium, and the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to \noutweigh  the  costs.  The  main  risks  are  related  to  the  constrained  local  capacity  and  the \npossibility of future disasters.
