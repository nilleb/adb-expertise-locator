Environmental implications of the proposed Project were \nreviewed at appraisal. The subprojects to be financed by the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  will  be  required  to  satisfy  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental guidelines.  \n \nProject Description  The  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Export  Development  Project \n(SMEEDP) comprises a part of the Government and ADB efforts to \npromote development of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in \nIndonesia  and  is  a  follow  up  to  the  earlier  approved  Industrial \nCompetitiveness and SME Development Program (Loan 1738-INO, \napproved in March 2000), which focuses on regulatory framework \nand policies, and technical assistance (TA) for the development of \nbusiness development services (TA 3829-INO, approved in January \n2002).  The  SMEEDP  focuses  on  the  issue  of  SME  financing, \nspecifically that for small and medium exporters and their network of \nsuppliers,  and  will  consist  of  (i)  a  loan  of  $85  million  to  provide \ninvestment  credit,  and  (ii)  TA  of  $500,000.  To  complement  the \nproposed  TA,  the  Government  of  Japan,  through  the  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA), will finance, on a grant and \nparallel basis, technical assistance to support development of SMEs. \nThe proposed TA and the Japan's SME promotion program will be \nimplemented in close coordination with technical assistance to the \nSME sector being provided by other development partners. \n \nRationale  The 1997-1998 crisis pushed a large number of people below the \npoverty  line.  During  the  process  of  economic  recovery,  SMEs, \nespecially  export-oriented  firms,  offered  particular  resilience; \nbenefited  from  the  depreciation  of  the  rupiah;  and  provided \nsubstantial job opportunities, contributing to poverty reduction. Yet it \nwas  clearly  recognized  that  Indonesia  had  failed  to  fully  take \nadvantage of the SME sector because of a number of impediments. \nRecognizing  the  importance  of  SMEs  for  Indonesia\u2019s  economic \nrecovery  and  future  growth,  and  for  poverty  reduction  through \nemployment  creation,  the  Government  considered  development  of \nSMEs  among  the  country\u2019s  most  important  economic  initiatives, \nespecially  in  its  strategy  for  poverty  reduction.  Accordingly,  the \nPoverty Partnership Agreement between the Government and ADB \nalso  noted  SME  development  as  a  key  area  for  ADB\u2019s  future \nassistance in Indonesia.  \n \nKey impediments to the development of SMEs include (i) regulatory \nframework biased against SMEs; (ii) the lack of sustainable business \ndevelopment services for SMEs; and (iii) difficulty of SMEs to obtain \nfinancing, particularly for meeting investment requirements. Through ", "iv   \nADB\u2019s  earlier  assistance,  the  issues  of  regulatory  framework  and \nbusiness development services are being addressed; however, there \nhave  been  no  effective  initiatives  to  address  the  issue  of  SME \nfinancing. \n \nOne of the major lessons from the crisis is that firms should secure \nfunds to meet their investment needs in the same currency as their \nrevenue stream. Export-oriented SMEs would be naturally hedged \nagainst foreign exchange risks. At the same time, given the current \nmarket conditions, SMEs are having difficulty in obtaining financing. \nIndonesian banks often look only at collateral and offer only short-\nterm funds. The introduction of foreign exchange term financing for \ninvestment  purposes  with  TA  for  improving  the  communication \nbetween banks and SMEs will help to channel needed funds to SMEs \nfor high quality projects. \n \nObjectives  The SMEEDP will support economic growth and assist in reducing \npoverty  through  job  creation  and  promotion  of  labor-intensive \nexports. As part of a larger assistance strategy, the Project aims at \nsupporting the SME export sector directly via investment capital, a \nniche market within the entire SME sector lending. Indirectly, the \nProject will improve the appraisal capacity of banks to undertake \ninvestment lending as well as the exporters' capacity to apply for \nbank  credit  with  sound  financial  advisory  services.  The  Project \npresents  integrated  support  to  export-oriented  SMEs  nationwide, \nwith priority to be given to subprojects from selected provinces with \nexport  potential  such  as  East  and  Central  Java  (part  of  ADB\u2019s \ngeographical  focus),  Sulawesi  (part  of  the  East  ASEAN  Growth \nArea), and Bali. Components are as follows: \n \n(i)  Small and Medium Exporters\u2019 Investment Facility (SEIF) for small \nexporters  to  meet  investment  requirements  for  capacity \nexpansion  and  modernization;  these  investment  funds  will  be \nchanneled  to  public  and  private  banks  through  Bank  Ekspor \nIndonesia (BEI), which will manage the banks' risks, while the \nparticipating  banks  (PBs)  will  manage  the  exporters\u2019  risk \n(exporters  will  assume  the  foreign  exchange  risk  of  the \nsubloans); and \n \n(ii)  TA grant of $500,000 to strengthen credit and project appraisal \ncapacity  for  all  PBs  through  technical  administration  unit, \nincluding training for bankers on SME credit scoring, basic trade \nfinance instruments, as well as financial advisory services for \nSME exporters to have access to the SEIF. \n \nCost Estimates  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $113 million equivalent. \nOf the total cost, $85 million or 75% is the foreign exchange cost and \n$28 million or 25% is the local currency cost. The former will involve \nfunding for $85 million to finance the SEIF. \n \n ", "  v\nFinancing Plan  (1)  SEIF \n \nForeign  Local \nSource  Total Cost\nExchange  Currency \n       \nADB  85.0  0.0  85.0 \nSub-borrowers\u2019 Equity a  0.0  14.0  14.0 \nParticipating Banks b  0.0  14.0  14.0 \nLocal Currency Financing  0.0  0.0  0.0 \nTotal  85.0  28.0  113.0 \na    Includes equity by SMEs. \nb    Includes working capital or short-term lending to SMEs by participating banks. \n \n(2)  $500,000 TA grant for support of a Technical Assistance and \nMonitoring  Unit  (TAMU)  at  BEI.  In  parallel  to  this  TA,  the \nGovernment of Japan will finance an SME promotion program to \ncomplement the proposed TA, totaling $5 million. \n  \nLoan Amount and Terms  The  loan  amount  will  be  $85  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources. The Borrower will be the Republic of Indonesia. The loan \ncurrency, interest modality, and repayment schedule are stated in the \nloan agreement and in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on its London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)  based  loan  product.  The  standard \ncommitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum  applies  on  undisbursed \namounts according to the following estimated disbursement schedule: \n$15 million, first year; $30 million, second year; and $40 million, third \nyear. A front-end fee will be payable in an amount equivalent to 1% of \nthe amount of the loan, and will be capitalized in the loan. \n \nRelending Terms  The Borrower will relend the loan proceeds of $85 million to BEI, the \nsole implementing bank. The relending terms and conditions will be \nidentical to those of the ADB loan to the Borrower except that the \nBorrower will charge banks 50 basis points. BEI will manage the \nparticipating banks\u2019 (PBs) risk and charge an administration fee to all \nPBs.  The  PBs  will  manage  the  commercial  risk  of  exporters  and \ncharge onlending interest rates to the final sub-borrowers (the SMEs) \nat market rates. TAMU will support the bank\u2019s credit assessment of \nSME  subloans  if  necessary.  For  individual  small  and  medium \nexporters,  the  maximum  subloan  size  financed  by  ADB  will  be \n$600,000  with  a  free  limit  of  $450,000.  For  exporters  with \ndemonstrated  business  networks  of  more  than  20  SMEs,  the \nmaximum subloan size financed by ADB will be $1 million with a free \nlimit  of  $750,000.    Under  either  type  of  free  limit,  the  first  three \nsubloans made by each PB will be subject to the approval of ADB. \nSubloans exceeding the free limit will continue requiring prior ADB \napproval. The tenor of subloans will be for a maximum of 8 years, \nincluding a maximum of 3 years of grace period. \n ", "vi   \nPeriod of Utilization  The closing date for submission of subloan applications for approval \nand authorization for withdrawals will be 3 years after the date of \nADB\u2019s loan effectiveness. The closing date for disbursements will be \n5 years after the same date. \n  \nEstimated Completion Date  31 December 2007 \n \nExecuting Agency  The Directorate General of Financial Institutions of the Ministry of \nFinance \n \nImplementing Bank  Bank Ekspor Indonesia \n \nParticipating Banks  Bank Negara Indonesia, Bank Rakyat Indonesia, Bank Mandiri, Bank \nDanamon, Bank Niaga, and Bank Bukopin \n \nProcurement  The provisions of ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement applicable to \ndevelopment finance institutions will be followed. All procurement will \nbe from ADB member countries. Sub-borrowers will be encouraged to \nprocure  goods  through  international  competitive  bidding  and/or \ninternational shopping. Procurement will be conducted transparently \nand in conformity with ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy. \n \nProject Benefits and  The main benefits for the Government and SME exporters will include \nBeneficiaries  (i) investments  in  new  technologies  for  export  growth  during \neconomic recovery, (ii) sustainable direct and indirect employment \ngeneration  through  labor-intensive  exports,  (iii)  increased  direct \nexports from SMEs, (iv) enhanced market-oriented business advisory \nservices to SMEs through existing business networks to complement \ninvestments  and  increased  labor  productivity,  and  (v)  improved \nmechanism  for  delivery  of  credit  to  SMEs  through  adequate  and \ntransparent financial intermediation and project management. \n \nRisks and Assumptions  The Government\u2019s overall commitment to SME development through \ncomprehensive economic and regulatory reforms is likely to continue.  \nUnder the expectations of economic recovery, it is highly likely to \nhave financially viable subprojects to meet the Project\u2019s goals, given \nthe  current  pipeline,  SME  lending  potential  of  banks,  and  the \nprospects of Indonesia\u2019s non-oil and gas exports. \n   \nAdvisory Technical  The TA will help strengthen the SME lending operations of the PBs \nAssistance  selected and will coordinate among SME exporters, PBs, technical \nand business advisory services, and relevant external aid activities for \nSME  exporters  and  government  entities  to  facilitate  successful \nutilization of the credit line. About 18 person-months of international \nand  22  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  will  be \nrequired.

THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Export  Development  Project \n(SMEEDP) (Appendix 1 for project framework). The report also describes proposed technical \nassistance (TA) for Small and Medium Enterprise Export Development, and if the Board approves \nthe proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis: SME Exports \n \n2.  In the recovery of the Indonesian economy after the Asian economic crisis in 1997-1998, \nsmall  and  medium  enterprises  (SMEs)  displayed  particular  resilience.  Because  of  SMEs\u2019 \nemployment-generating capacity, the Government and ADB have recognized the importance of \nsupporting their development as an effective poverty reduction strategy. This is reflected in the \nPoverty Reduction Partnership Agreement signed in 2001. Also, the Government has prepared a \nMid-Term Action Plan (MTAP) for SMEs1 announced by President Megawati in April 2002. The \nplan highlights the role of SMEs to broaden the economic base and to accelerate much-needed \nstructural reforms. \n \n3.  In Indonesia, SMEs weathered the crisis well and grew at a faster pace than the rest of the \neconomy, as a number of them turned to exports due to the favorable exchange rate (Appendix 2). \nSME exports grew by 3.6% in 1998 and 5.8% in 1999. In contrast, exports by large exporters \ndeclined by 0.8% in 1998 and by 7.5% in 1999.2  While the recovery has been faster among SMEs, \nit could have been higher if the constraints inhibiting their development had been addressed. Small \nfirms (those with fewer than 100 workers) had higher export growth than larger firms between 1996 \nand 2000, and their share of total exports doubled. However, their contribution to exports continues \nto be modest  (2.8% in 1996 and up to 4.1% in 2000). For countries in need of higher economic \ngrowth, focus on SME exports could provide the highest returns in terms of growth given the low, \nbut rapidly expanding, market shares of these firms.3 \n \n4.  While direct SME export growth has been achieved substantially by finding niche markets \nand adapting costs and quality to market demand, a significant part of SME exports simply go \nunrecorded because they occur indirectly through subcontracting arrangements with larger firms or \ntraders. In the case of food exports, for instance, smallholders and fishermen who grow food crops \nor collect seafood and fish depend on the processing and exporting capacity of larger firms. This \nexplains in part why the Indonesian data indicate that SMEs export about less than 10% of all non-\noil and gas exports, a percentage below the estimates for Singapore, Japan, and Philippines, its \n                                                 \n1   Mid-Term Action Plan \u2013 Small and Medium Enterprise, 2002-2004.

Constraint Analysis \n \n5.  The large potential of SMEs to generate employment and value added is a highly desirable \ndevelopment goal in a populous and capital-short country such as Indonesia, but presents many \nconstraints. The industrial structure in Indonesia has been dominated by large enterprises in terms \nof  value  added,  while  small  firms  play  a  key  role  as  the  locus  of  most  employment.  In \nmanufacturing  alone,  of  10.2  million  people  employed,  nearly  60%  are  employed  in \nmicroenterprises and SMEs.  \n \n6.  Growth potential depends on enterprise size and the constraints faced. Small firms tend not \nto  grow  into  productive  medium  firms  (what  is  also  known  as  \u201cthe  missing  middle\u201d).  The \nphenomenon illustrates the structural constraints that have characterized Indonesian economy for \ndecades (Appendix 2). \n \n7.  These constraints include (i) a poor policy environment to conduct private business, which \ndisproportionally penalizes SMEs because it is relatively more expensive for SMEs to deal with a \nmyriad of overlapping and sometimes contradicting regulations; (ii) the lack of adequate business \ndevelopment services (BDS) for SMEs in an environment where the Government\uf8e7and external aid \nagencies\uf8e7have provided services at low cost without substantial outreach or sustainability; and \n(iii) the lack of financial and physical infrastructure to support SMEs with access to markets with \nreliable production, and even exports.  Assistance has aimed at reducing and eliminating these \nconstraints  through  a  series  of  step-by-step,  well-integrated  interventions  by  ADB  and  other \nagencies, such as ADB\u2019s Industrial Competitiveness and SME Development (ICSMED) Program \nand the associated technical assistance (TA),5 which supported the Government to prepare the \ncomprehensive MTAP for SMEs. \n \n    a.  Constraints in Policy and Regulatory Frameworks \n \n8.  Reducing or eliminating the regulatory burden on SMEs is one of the greatest spurs to \nentrepreneurship. Problems stem from regulatory systems developed in the image of large firms, \nrewarding economies of scale and stability rather than flexibility, and the cumulative pressure of \nregulatory requirements for SMEs. Small firms have reduced capacity to absorb unproductive \nexpenditures because they have less capital as well as fewer managerial resources. SMEs identify \nhigh  compliance  costs,  extensive  and  complicated  paperwork,  and  economic  regulations  that \nprohibit certain activities as the most onerous constraints they face.  \n \n9.  Under  the  ICSMED  Program,  the  Government  has  created  better  conditions  for \nentrepreneurs, especially small entrepreneurs. In particular, ADB TA supported the Government\u2019s \nreview and revision of several business-related regulations, the set-up of the competition bureau \n                                                 \n4   Harvie, C. and B. Lee. 2002. The Role of SMEs in National Economies of East Asia. Tables 2.7 and 2.8. UK: Elgar \nPublishing.  For Indonesia, estimates range from 5 to 10% of exports; for Singapore and Japan, 15 to 16%; for \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, Republic of Korea, and Taipei,China the estimates are above 40%.  \n5   ADB. 2000.

", "  3\n(the first one of its kind in Indonesia), a less regulatory role for the Board of Investments, and a \ncomprehensive SME policy under the MTAP. Under a new and ongoing TA,6 ADB has continued to \nsupport this policy reform by moving its focus from policy planning at the center to implementation \nof specific pilot projects at the local level. For instance, local one-stop shops in Central Java and \nSouth  Sulawesi  will  allow  SMEs  to  acquire  information  about  regulations  and  carry  out \nadministrative formalities in one office only. Also, local and national regulations that discourage the \ncreation and expansion of smaller enterprises will continue to be reviewed and discussed. The \nexisting requirements to start or expand an enterprise\u2014the time, cost, complexity, and registration \nrequirements\u2014are especially burdensome for SMEs and need to be minimized or eliminated \ncompletely. These developments are part of the ICSMED Program\u2019s spirit of reducing bureaucracy, \nminimizing administrative burdens, streamlining procedures, and reducing compliance costs for all \nenterprises. \n \n    b.  Constraints in Managerial Capacity \n \n10.  Schemes to support managerial capacity of SMEs will be unsuccessful in the absence of a \nvibrant entrepreneurial sector, consisting of those who sense opportunities and take risks in the \nface  of  uncertainty  and  develop  new  goods  and  services  using  available  resources.  The \nentrepreneurial process remains complex and influenced by social, cultural, and political factors. \n \n11.  Lack of markets for BDS\uf8e7defined broadly as short-term services to improve business \nmanagement\uf8e7constrains SME performance in developing countries. In some cases, government \n(and  external)  intervention  has  prevented  the  development  of  sustainable  markets  for  these \nservices through the traditional approach of heavy and direct intervention to subsidize and provide \na direct supply of services to SMEs. The result of the traditional approach was poor quality \nservices, irrelevant to SMEs and with very limited outreach. The market for BDS providers is \ngrowing as the supply of professionals rises and as SMEs acknowledge the usefulness of external \nand timely advice in a number of areas related to their business growth. \n \n12.  BDS comprise a number of short-term services that help small entrepreneurs upgrade their \nproductivity by improving workplace organization, handling inventories, improving product design, \nusing bank credit, etc. Similar to the case of high regulatory costs, it is onerous for SMEs to \nassume the costs of all these productivity-enhancing processes by themselves, because each of \nthem involves some high first-time, entry, or learning cost. For financial management techniques, \nsome  SMEs  do  not  even  apply  for  credit,  because  they  know  they  cannot  fulfill  the  entry \nrequirements into a banking relationship. Proper use of BDS could help SMEs initiate or upgrade \ntheir financial inputs from banks whether through general financial advice on using simple bank \naccounts to high-quality business plans for long-term loans. For advanced production techniques, \nthe cost of learning or transfer of these processes may be lessened through the use of BDS or \nthrough subcontracting for larger firms (vertical learning) or through clustering among other SMEs \n(horizontal learning or learning from peers). In fact, subcontracting7 appears to have made learning \nmore accessible for SMEs in Japan and Republic of Korea, where SMEs have been successfully \nintegrated into their export-oriented manufacturing sectors. \n \n \n                                                 \n6   ADB. 2002.

Benefits of the Existence of Trading Houses to Export-oriented SMEs. In \nSmall Business through the Economic Crisis. The Asia Foundation. ", "4   \n    c.  Constraints in Access to Financial Markets \n \n13.  Most SMEs lack access to formal financial markets, mainly standard bank lending. High \ncollateral requirements, complex and time-consuming credit application procedures, small size of \ncredit, and general distrust towards outsiders are some of the factors that explain why SMEs do \nnot  tend  to  use  bank  loans  and  prefer  other\u2014sometimes  even  more  expensive\u2014sources  of \nfinancing. The Asia Foundation and ADB found that only about one fifth of all Indonesian SMEs \ntend to have loans from banks.8  If the crisis affected some SMEs through increased interest rates \nand reduced profits, they tended to be a minority, according to a recent World Bank report.9 In fact, \nthe low reliance on bank loans by the majority of Indonesian SMEs gave them an additional \nadvantage. However, chronic low exposure to credit constrains the long-run growth potential of \nSMEs, which would have grown faster in an unconstrained credit environment.  \n \n14.  The same World Bank report estimates that the prospects of SME lending by Indonesian \nbanks  appear  to  be  good,  with  growth  rates  of  25%  for  2002-2003.  However,  these  growth \nprospects may pose challenges to banks that look to implement such aggressive growth strategies. \nIndonesian state-owned and private banks have to face the challenge of increasing their lending by \nlooking for new smaller clients (and loans), a departure from the precrisis days of cozy corporate \nrelationships. Today Indonesian banks need to reconsider their product mix, credit and pricing \npolicies, marketing, human resource mix, branch networks, and management information systems \nto reach out to SME clients. Despite the initial signs of recovery in the banking system, a new \nequilibrium in the market of credit suppliers and credit users has yet to be reached, despite the \napparent liquidity from banks and increased credit needs of SMEs. Greater and easier access to \nfinance is vital to the prospects for any export-led economic recovery, but banks may not be able to \nsupport recovery, given their own set of binding constraints. Many banks are still suffering from \nnonperforming loans (NPLs), and restructuring has reduced their capacity to bear the credit risks of \nnew lending, especially SME lending, given the need to maintain prudential norms.  \n \n15.  One of the reasons why growth prospects appear so high is that Indonesian commercial \nbanks had only a small portion of their portfolio in SME lending (Appendix 3, Table 2). Although \nBank Indonesia (BI) estimates by loan size show that almost one quarter of all bank loans are \n\u201cSME\u201d loans, banking analysts estimate that the proportion of actual lending to SMEs must be \nmuch  lower  (perhaps  10-15%)  because  of  multiple  small  loans  by  corporate  borrowers  or  a \nmultitude of small consumer loans. After the crisis, a more balance clientele is emerging, and \nrestructured  banks  are  determined  to  adopt  new  business  plans  to  attract  SME  clients.  For \ninstance, the large state-owned banks such as Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI), Mandiri, and Bank \nRakyat Indonesia (BRI) can reach SMEs across Indonesia through their extensive branch networks \n(almost 2,000 branches among these four banks). Their business strategies note the need to shift \nfrom their traditional customer base to SMEs, whether by scaling up or down their target clientele. \nSo, for instance, on the one hand, BRI has traditionally lent to a large number of microenterprises \nin rural areas, and is currently boosting its retail banking to attract larger SME clients (it has \nopened nine SME centers).  On the other hand, BNI and Mandiri, which have traditionally lent to \nmore corporate clients, now have plans to focus on smaller accounts through better cost-effective \noperational techniques such as credit scoring. Other smaller banks such as Bank Danamon, Bank \n                                                 \n8   GFA-Swisscontact.  2001.  Best  Practice  in  Promoting  Market-based  Lending.

Based on surveys \non the use of bank loans, the report concludes less than 2% of all SMEs may be benefited by the decree on SME debt \nrestructuring approved in July 2002. See van Gelder, F. and Broadfoot. 2002. Small and Medium Enterprise Debt \nRestructuring. Jakarta. World Bank. ", "  5\nNiaga, and Bank Bukopin (a private bank) have better established SME clienteles than the large \nstate-owned banks. With almost 85% of banks\u2019 assets still in the hands of the Government, \nprivatization  (or  reprivatization)  of  banks  in  the  next  few  years  is  expected  to  improve  their \nefficiency and commercial orientation, and, hence their ability and incentives for SME lending. In \nthe meantime, all major banks are making or expected to adopt soon changes in their operations \nby opening more business centers to cater SME clients, streamlining their procedures further to \nreduce the costs of assessing small loans, and adopting risk management guidelines to improve \nportfolio quality, among other operational changes (Appendix 3, Tables 3 and 4). These changes in \nthe banking sector are aimed at meeting the needs of a more sophisticated clientele of SME credit \nusers as they improve their own financial management capacity (paras. 10-12). \n \n2.  Rationale for the Project \n \n16.  The SME sector in Indonesia is probably one of the most heterogeneous in Asia. No \ncomprehensive approach could deal with the constraints faced by all SMEs. A multifaceted and \ngradual approach to Indonesian SMEs will be most effective in a rapidly changing environment. \nThe Project has to be placed in the context of the Government\u2019s efforts to revive and develop the \nSME sector since the crisis, and within ADB support in the area.  \n \n17.  The  MTAP  has  identified  the  key  impediments  to  the  development  of  SMEs: \n(i) inappropriate regulatory framework under which equal conditions did not exist for SMEs vis-\u00e0-vis \nlarger companies, (ii) unavailability of private sector-led and sustainable BDS for SMEs, and \n(iii) difficulty for SMEs to obtain financing. Through ADB\u2019s and other agencies\u2019 earlier assistance, \nthe issues of regulatory framework and BDS are being addressed; however, there have been no \neffective initiatives to address the issue of SME commercial financing, one of the key actions \nproposed in the MTAP. \n \n18.  Access to finance for private enterprises (and SMEs) was drastically reduced during the \ncrisis, and the mobilization of financial funds continues to be challenging until today. In particular, \nlong-term funds in foreign exchange available for investment have decreased within the banking \nsystem after the crisis and have not yet recovered (Appendix 3, Figure 1). Available funds are \npriced at comparatively high rates due to country risk perceptions. The proposed project will \ncomplement  temporarily  a  banking  system  that,  currently,  cannot  provide  sufficient  long-term \nfunding  for  SME  exporters  who  have  expressed  strong  demand  for  the  credit.  Bank  Ekspor \nIndonesia\u2019s (BEI), an apex institution with a clean commercial record, provides an administrative \nand TA focal point for banks\u2019 lending to SMEs, and for SME exporters in the process of improving \ntheir access to formal bank financing (Appendix 3, Table 5). \n \n19.  While a well-defined credit line will improve the supply of funds in the system, it cannot be \nexpected on its own to solve the sluggish intermediation of financial funds in Indonesia. Other \ncomplementary improvements in the financial sector are needed at various levels. First, further \ndeepening in financial sector reforms by the Government will strengthen the banking sector,10 while \naid  agencies  have  continued  to  provide  selective  financial  policy  advice  to  the  Government \n(Ministry  of  Finance  [MOF]  and  BI)  and  state-owned  banks  through  targeted  advisors.  Also, \nspecific policy actions are required to improve intermediation of funds to SMEs. Some of them are \nfound under the assurances of the proposed project such as an adequate implementation of the \nSME debt restructuring decree; further progress in MTAP implementation; and further discussion \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 1998.

A specific policy \ninitiative towards the use of credit information, contemplated as part of the ongoing TA and MTAP, \nwill produce the first blueprint of a credit information bureau11 in Indonesia, which will help improve \nlong-term access to all types of credit, especially for SMEs, as it facilitates borrower assessments \nby banks. Finally, commercial banks themselves need to improve their own financial intermediation \nroles. A change in the strategic goal of further SME lending needs to be matched by a change in \noperational strategies and banking culture. Also, the credit line needs to be complemented with the \nextensive number of externally-funded projects on BDS to be coordinated under this Project, not \nonly to ensure utilization of the credit line for sound SME investments, but to support the need for \nbetter mobilization of investment financing from banks to businesses. In the near future, other \ntypes  of  SME  financing  will  also  be  necessary.  Access  to  domestic  and  international  capital \nmarkets, nonexistent or underutilized by SMEs today, will need to be supported as alternatives to \nbank funding, and as part of a financial graduation policy. \n \na.  Government\u2019s Strategy \n \n20.  The  Medium-Term  Development  Strategy  (PROPENAS)  for  2001-200512  aims  at \nstrengthening the foundations of the economy for sustained economic growth, national cohesion, \nand  social  stability;  achieving  good  governance  and  the  rule  of  law;  strengthening  regional \nautonomy; and developing social programs. These goals represent a change in paradigm from a \ncentralized power under the New Order regime to \u201cthe empowerment of people\u2019s economy.\u201d To \nadvance  this  change,  a  recovery  program  stated  that  the  \u201cgovernment  intervention  is  to  be \nminimized to give wider opportunity and freedom to the cooperative movement and SMEs to \ndevelop autonomous business activities.\u201d13  \n \n21.  The Government has embarked on the reform of its industrial policy to accelerate SME \ndevelopment and increase the competitiveness of Indonesian industry supported by the ICSMED. \nAmong other ongoing economic reforms, the Government has streamlined existing subsidized \nlines of credit for SMEs and announced a competitive investment policy to be reflected in a new \ninvestment law. To develop further industrial and SME reforms, the Government created two \ninterministerial task forces during the Program (the SME Task Force and the Deregulation and \nCompetition  Task  Force).  First,  the  SME  Task  Force  (soon  to  be  institutionalized)  helped  in \naccelerating  SME  policy  reform.  It  assessed  (i)  the  institutional  framework  needed  for  SME \npromotion;  (ii)  the  provision  of  commercially  based  credit  to  SMEs;  and  (iii)  the  provision  of \nsustainable  supporting  business  services  for  SME  trading,  marketing,  and  exports.  The \nassessment provided the Government with recommendations for improvements in SME policy, \nwhich were also reflected in the finalization of the MTAP, announced in April 2002. Also, the \nDeregulation and Competition Task Force reviewed and suggested the modification of policies that \naffect industrial development and investment negatively in the country. The Task Force, with \nsupport from ADB, prepared an Indonesia Regulatory Review Manual for training of officials within \nthe Central Government in identifying, reviewing, and revising business regulations. Under the new \nTA, the practice will soon be extended to local government officials in 2003 and 2004 in several \ndistricts. \n                                                 \n11  The blueprint is part of the ADB. 2002.

Many external agencies have supported credit lines for SMEs to encourage employment \nand to diversify the economy. The strategy for SMEs has generally been to ease the scarcity of \nterm finance by providing funds and improving the banking system\u2019s ability to lend to them. In \n1996, the World Bank undertook for the first time a detailed empirical analysis of its SME support in \nthree countries over a period of more than 20 years.14 The study concludes that the expected \noutcomes of credit lines for term financing were not always achieved, and provides three key \nlessons for future operations: First, support for SMEs can create more jobs, but it could fall below \nexpectations. In the Philippines, support for SMEs was considered to be effective in creating jobs, \nand  less  so  in  reducing  poverty,  boosting  Philippine  exports,  or  shifting  the  location  of \nindustries\uf8e7the originally stated objectives. In Sri Lanka, too, SMEs were a good vehicle for \ncreating jobs, especially important in an economy undergoing restructuring. The results were less \nimpressive for Ecuador. Second, banks needed to learn more about SMEs. Starting with more \nflexible financial products, such as basic short-term credit, one way to start to reduce the risk \nperception of SME clients is by using building blocks toward a more complex banking relationship \nbefore using long-term loans. Direct support to SMEs in Sri Lanka did go a long way toward \nimproving the prudential soundness of the banking system, and NPLs among SMEs were below \nthe market average. Finally, the report concludes that good institutions cannot overcome a weak \npolicy environment. By providing deeply subsidized credit to borrowers (such as in Ecuador), rather \nthan access to credit, the credit lines merely substituted government transfers for borrower finance. \nReforming the financial sector or relying on a sustainable microfinance institution would have been \na better way to provide support for small entrepreneurs unable to get credit.   \n \n23.  ADB\u2019s direct involvement in financial intermediation with similar credit lines to enterprises \nhas been through the two development finance loans (DFLs). Between 1989 and 1993, the first \ndevelopment finance loan (DFL) (Loan 0981-INO) in an amount of $200 million was almost fully \nutilized ($194 million); it was followed by a second DFL (Loan 1223-INO) for $200 million in 1993. \nUnder DFL II, the Government re-lent the ADB loan in dollars to nine banks: directly to two state-\nowned banks and through the central bank to several private banks. Subloans were onlent in \ndollars  to  eligible  subprojects  for  financing  the  foreign  exchange  content  of  their  capital \nexpenditure, but the project faced low utilization, primarily because of high subloan interest rates \nunder the prevalent market conditions. Interest rates on the dollar-denominated subloans were not \ncompetitive with dollar loans available from multiple sources of credit before the crisis. More \nimportantly, the extensive due diligence, documentation, and reporting requirements without any \nmonitoring  support  made  subloans  even  less  attractive  compared  with  cheaper  and  simpler \nrequirements under conventional commercial bank loans. ADB's interest rate under its dollar facility \nwas  generally  higher  than  alternative  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  funding \navailable to banks, and the two state-owned banks (Bank EXIM15 and BNI) decided to cancel their \nallocation shortly after loan effectiveness. With only private intermediaries, the loan agreement was \namended further. It reduced the cost of subloan processing by increasing the free limit amount for \neach subloan to $3 million from the original $1 million, giving banks more room to select, approve, \nand monitor subloans. But it was insufficient to stimulate utilization. Once the 1997 financial crisis \nbroke out, there was a further cancellation of funds of DFL II because the remaining private banks \nwere unable to find eligible sub-borrowers. The loan was closed in March 1999 with final utilization \n                                                 \n14  A summary of the findings was published under World Bank (WB). 1998.

Most of the 52 subprojects were in garments and shrimp \nproduction on the island of Java, with no substantive evidence of employment or export creation.16 \n \n24.  The SMEEDP takes into consideration lessons from international experience (para. 22) and \nspecific  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  Indonesia  operations  (para.  23).  Compared  with  international \nexperience, the SMEEDP can be expected to generate jobs and exports in a period of recovery in \nthe economic cycle. The SMEEDP will also support banks\u2019 current efforts to get into bankable \noperations with creditworthy SMEs, as most exporting clients already have access to short-term \nbank credit. At the same time, the SMEEDP takes a radical departure from past subsidized pricing \nof credit, so no price distortions are found such as those faced by SMEs in Latin America. \nCompared with previous operations in Indonesia, a key lesson for the SMEEDP has been to \nensure  that  the  interest  cost  to  the  participating  bank  and  the  sublending  interest  rate  are \ncompetitive with alternative funding sources. In this respect, the expected availability of ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility  for  investment  by  small  exporters  will  be  a  major  advantage \ncompared with DFL II, since long-term funds in foreign exchange are not readily available to banks \nat competitive cost due to the lingering effects of the crisis and recent bank restructuring. Given \npresent economic and country risk conditions, there is now much reduced availability of credit lines \nto Indonesian banks (Appendix 3, Figure 1). This reduces the likely source of competition from \nalternative funding sources, and underlines the need for a credit facility to address an important \ntemporary constraint to ongoing SME export growth in need of foreign exchange for investment in \nthe upgrading of plants and equipment during the recovery. Finally, administration requirements \nhave also been simplified from the start and centralized under one administrator (BEI) with TA to \nreduce the costs of a transparent and targeted intervention with emphasis on SME exporters, and \nwith a simplified disbursement procedure not available before.  \n \nc.  ADB\u2019s Strategy and Policy Dialogue \n \n25.  Since 1998, ADB has played a lead role in SME policy development. In the formulation of \nthe ICSMED policy framework, ADB launched substantial economic and sector work (Appendix 4) \nand promoted aid coordination meetings to reach agreement on the SME policy agenda. In line \nwith the ADB strategy, substantial work was undertaken in 1998-2002 to develop understanding of \nthe issues and constraints facing the SME sector and to identify requirements for this sector. ADB \nstrategy recognizes that support for SME development is crucial to ensure pro-poor, pro-jobs, \nsustainable recovery and that assistance is needed in access to exports and domestic markets, \nincreased access to financial services, strengthening linkages to the large-scale manufacturing \nsector, and improvement of investment and market advisory services.  Active project assistance \nand  appropriate  development  policies  are  required  to  encourage  growth  of  the  SME  sector, \nespecially in the regions. \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s support for SME development is substantive and has evolved systematically.  In the \nfirst phase, ADB\u2019s SME development strategy for Indonesia through policy dialogue conducted \nunder ICSMED advocated rationalization and streamlining of the industrial policy, regulation, and \ninstitutional framework to improve incentives for trade and industry. Concurrently, ADB\u2019s support \nfor strengthening the financial system and its governance will provide a range of instruments and \nvolume of financing required for sustained industrial and SME development.  As a follow-up to this \nintensive policy dialogue and the progress attained in certain segments of the finance and industry \nsector, ADB\u2019s SME development strategy is to focus, in a second phase, on a comprehensive \nassistance package to SMEs. The proposed project focuses on export-oriented SMEs to provide \n                                                 \n16  ADB. 2002. Project Completion Report on the Second Development Finance Project in Indonesia. Manila. ", "  9\ndirect financial assistance to augment access to investment financing, and to complement financial \nand export business advisory services. \n \n27.  ADB has played a key role since 1997 in coordinating SME policy dialogue with the support \nof the aid community and various Government agencies. This culminated in ADB\u2019s approval of the \nICSMED program. The ongoing ICSMED program aims at changes in regulations to improve the \nprivate business environment in Indonesia. It also aims at rationalizing assistance to SMEs by \n(i) improving policy coordination and implementation, (ii) improving financial intermediation, and (iii) \ndeveloping proposals for BDS support. The program loan includes, for instance, an investment \npolicy  geared  towards  issues  of  industrial  competitiveness  rather  than  introducing  additional \nincentives  for  SMEs.  The  more  liberal  industrial  framework  will  further  SME  development  by \nreducing the excessive costs of operating in a monopolistic environment. The investment policy \nstatement has already been prepared and was announced by the Government in 2001 as one of \nthe core conditions for the disbursement of the incentive tranche of the Program Loan in February \n2002. A key release condition for the final tranche is the actual enactment of the investment law, \nand the Government has requested an extension on the Program Loan until 2003.  \n \n28.  Rationalization of SME credit schemes has been another core condition of the ICSMED \nprogram. The condition has been fully complied with by issuing a decree on SME credit schemes \nwith a gradual phase-out of subsidized credit (June 2001). Throughout the years, many credit \nprograms for small (and large) firms were heavily subsidized, which contributed to credit rationing, \nthat is, subsidized credit created such a large demand for low-priced credit that it had to be \nrationed, excluding viable SMEs. In this respect, subsidization of credit for small firms has become \nunsustainable,  and  the  Government  has  moved  towards  dismantling  the  complex  subsidized \nprograms of the past. Since 1999, BI has not been allowed to provide liquidity credit for subsidized \ncredit schemes. However, as a transitional measure, BI Law 23 requires that the credit schemes \nalready committed prior to the Law should continue, and that the Government should pay the \ninterest subsidy of these outstanding credit schemes until they expired. That is, the credit schemes \nfinanced by BI will eventually be automatically abolished. Today, besides the interest subsidy for \nthe  outstanding  credit  programs  under  BI  liquidity  credit,  the  Government  supports  interest \nsubsidies for two credit programs (consumer and housing credit), as well as Kredit Ketahanan \nProgram (KKP), a consolidated credit line from five previous credit schemes for agriculture and \ncooperatives. \n \nd.  Relevant External Assistance to the SME Sector \n \n29.  As Indonesia recovers from the crisis, bilateral and multilateral agencies have adjusted their \noperations  from  the  short-term  response  to  the  crisis  to  that  of  medium-term  development \n(Appendix 5).  \n \n30.  Japan, the largest bilateral source of development assistance to Indonesia, has provided \nsignificant financial and technical support to the SME sector in the country. In 1998, for instance, \nthe Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) provided a $1 billion facility to Indonesia to \nhelp support the country's export-led economic recovery. Specifically, the facility was provided for \nthe settlement of transactions based on the letters of credit (LCs) issued by Indonesian local banks \nto finance necessary imports for the Indonesian export sector. In December 2000, the facility was \nrevised to provide working capital financing ($300 million) in addition to LC confirmation services \n($700 million). The facility is fully utilized and is to be fully repaid by BEI in June 2003. On the \ntechnical  support  for  SMEs,  the  Government  of  Japan,  through  JICA,  financed  a  detailed \nassessment of the SME sector in response to a November 1999 request from the Government of \nIndonesia. The assessment was completed in July 2000 and was used for the formulation of an \nSME promotion program in Indonesia to be funded by the Government of Japan over the period of ", "10  \n2002-2006, which will be implemented in parallel to the proposed TA. Japan is the leader of the \nSME Donor Committee for the Consultative Group of Indonesia (CGI), in active coordination with \nADB, the World Bank and other bilateral agencies. \n \n31.   The joint SME unit of the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) plans \nto become involved in SME policy advice (currently the World Bank provides advice on SME debt \nrestructuring as part of its financial policy advisory role), improved delivery of BDS, and capacity \nbuilding within provincial banks that lend to SMEs. In 2001, IFC activities (including its SME \nsupport)  were  put  on  hold  but  were  reactivated  in  2002  after  Indonesian  courts  resolved \nsatisfactorily  cases  involving  IFC-funded  investments.  The  IFC  Private  Sector  Strategy  for \nIndonesia plans to support development of a healthy restructured banking sector and lending for \nthe  development  of  a  competitive  private  sector  and  for  corporate  investment.  In  2001,  IFC \ninvested $5 million in equity in Bank NISP, a private small bank with SME clientele. In 2003, IFC \nplans to establish a private sector BDS facility headquartered in Bali. \n \n32.  After the crisis, bilateral agencies expanded their assistance programs for SMEs in a \nnumber  of  specific  areas,  mainly  policy  advice.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment focused on supporting corporate and financial reforms including banking regulations \nmeant to improve SME lending. Australian assistance has been directed to Eastern Indonesia and \nadvisory  support  for  strengthening  of  government  audit,  monitoring  of  state-owned  banks, \nbankruptcy  and  commercial  law,  foreign  investment,  and  trade  policies,  including  support  for \ncapacity  building  for  government  officials  in  preparation  of  compliance  with  World  Trade \nOrganization  (WTO)  procedures.  The  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit \n(GTZ)  has  focused  on  SME  promotion  and  vocational  training,  while  the  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr \nWiederaufbau (KfW) successfully supported two investment credit lines in local currency for SMEs \nuntil 2001 and plans to continue a second phase of its credit line for investments in cleaner \nproduction  in  2003.  Finally,  a  number  of  other  international  and  bilateral  agencies  work  in \nIndonesia on SME policy reform and nonfinancial services for SMEs in different geographical \nareas, such as the Canadian Development Agency (especially in North and South Sulawesi), \nSwissContact (East Java), and the Asia Foundation (Bali and West Java). They work in close \ncooperation and coordination with the SME Donor Committee, led by Japan. \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objectives \n \n33.  The Project will aim at promoting economic growth and sustainable employment generation \nthrough  the  strengthening  of  the  SME  export  sector,  which  will  directly  contribute  to  reduce \npoverty. In pursuit of this goal, the SMEEDP will facilitate the development and promotion of SME \nexports by helping to increase value added, diversifying SME businesses, and fostering backward \nand forward linkages nationwide through term loans to SME exporters. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n34.  The Project will provide comprehensive support for SME export development through term \ncredit for expansion supported by business services to access credit and export markets. The \nSMEEDP  will  provide  the  Small  and  Medium  Exporters\u2019  Investment  Facility  (SEIF).  This  will \ncomprise a credit line, through public and private banks, that will on lend proceeds to directly \nfinance  the  foreign  exchange  components  of  capital  expenditures  for  SME  exporters,  and  to ", "  11\nindirectly finance their supporting industries.17  This will alleviate constraints in the postcrisis period, \nwhere economic activity has gained momentum but banks, despite their restructuring, have not \nbeen able to mobilize long-term foreign exchange funds for financing SME capital expenditures. \n \nC.  Special Features of the SMEEDP \n \n35.  The Project links policy work to project financing. The assurances under the Project aim at \nreinforcing the progress achieved under recent policy dialogue and TA. First, the letter of intent \nissued under review of the Extended Financing Facility of the IMF states that the SME debt \nrestructuring decree write-offs or restructuring measures will be left as commercial decisions rather \nthan provide for mandated haircuts. Second, progress under the recently announced MTAP for \nSMEs will improve SME policy coordination within the Government, improve local government \ncapacity to review and revise regulations, propose discussion of BI regulations affecting SME \nlending  such  as  moveable  collateral  registries,  announce  the  steering  committee  for  a  credit \nbureau, and develop a forum of BDS providers to discuss the new government orientation on \nbusiness services provision. All these policy actions will contribute to support a long-term strategy \nof increasing access of SMEs to financial markets. \n \n36.  The proposed Project acknowledges business networks and clusters, common forms of \nproduction and trading in Indonesia. First, it incorporates an incentive to banks to allocate subloans \nto exporters such as trading houses that may constitute a network of SMEs. This form of lending \nbridges the difficulties of lending to individual and noncreditworthy SMEs with the ability to borrow \nby larger firms, which usually take only short-term loans. The subloan supports the efforts of some \ntrading houses to enter into manufacturing to improve the quality of goods to be exported while \nindirectly supporting their own suppliers or subcontractors.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates  \n \n37.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $113 million equivalent. This comprises a \nforeign exchange cost of $85 million and a local currency cost of $28 million equivalent, financed \nby sub-borrowers\u2019 equity and/or participating banks. The former will involve funding for $85 million \nto finance the SEIF. \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n \n38.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $85 million to the Republic of Indonesia from its \nordinary capital resources. The loan\u2019s foreign currency (dollars), interest modality and repayment \nare  stated  in  the  Loan  Agreement  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  Loan  Product.  A \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum applies. The commitment charge will commence 60 days \nafter signing the loan agreement and will be paid semiannually by the Government against the \nundisbursed portion of standard staggered amounts of the loan (15% for the first year, 45% for the \nsecond year, 85% for the third year, and 100% thereafter). In addition, a front-end fee will be \npayable in an amount equivalent to 1% of the amount of the loan and will be capitalized in the \nloan.18 \n \n39.  For the SEIF, the Government will make proceeds of the loan available to BEI, BNI, and \nBRI through three subsidiary loans of $50 million, $20 million, and $15 million, respectively, that \n                                                 \n17  SME exporters include direct and indirect exporters and their supporting industries that have sufficient revenues in \nforeign exchange to repay subloans. \n18  ADB will have the right to withdraw such amount from the proceeds of the loan and pay itself such amounts as front-\nend fee at loan effectiveness.  ", "12  \nwill have the same terms and conditions as the loan from ADB to the Government, in relation to \ninterest, front-end fee, and commitment charges, in addition to a fee of 50 basis points, according \nto government regulations. BEI will relend the proceeds of its subsidiary loan to eligible PBs based \non onlending agreements between BEI and each of its PBs. BRI and BNI will also act as PBs. The \nPBs will onlend the SEIF funds to eligible sub-borrowers as subloans. The subloans will finance up \nto 100% of the entire direct and indirect foreign exchange cost of a qualified subproject, but in no \ncase more than 75% of the total cost of such project. The subloans will not finance the cost of \nacquisition of land use rights, taxes, duties, and wages. Each sub-borrower will provide equity \nfinancing of not less than 25% of the total cost of its subproject, and PBs may provide counterpart \nfunds to finance the local currency cost requirements. PBs will be encouraged to give priority to \nsubprojects outside Jakarta (provinces in the East ASEAN Growth Area and in ADB\u2019s geographical \nfocus areas, such as Central and East Java), but not excluding sub-borrowers with headquarters in \nJakarta. \n  \n40.  BEI will relend these funds in foreign exchange to PBs, and these PBs will onlend the funds \nto  sub-borrowers  in  foreign  currency.  The  foreign  exchange  risks  will  be  borne  by  the  sub-\nborrowers  who  are  naturally  hedged  against  these  risks  because  their  export  revenues  are \ndenominated in foreign currency. The relending interest rates to be charged by BEI to its PBs will \nbe  LIBOR  plus  125  basis  points,  which  includes  a  loan  administration  fee.  Under  a  loan \nadministration agreement, BEI will also be charging a loan administration fee of 15 basis points to \nBRI and BNI for the Technical Assistance Monitoring Unit (TAMU) services BEI will be providing so \nthat the total cost of funds to BRI and BNI will be LIBOR plus 125 basis points.  BEI may further \ncharge an additional risk premium based on negotiations with PBs, other than BNI and BRI. Since \nBEI will not be undertaking channeling of loan proceeds from and repayment obligations to the \nGovernment on behalf of BNI and BRI, BNI and BRI will not be charged a similar additional risk \npremium. Other than the BEI risk premium charged on Danamon, Bukopin, Niaga, Mandiri, and \nother PBs, the cost of borrowing to sub-borrowers out of loan proceeds as between BRI and BNI \non the one hand and Danamon, Bukopin, Niaga, and Mandiri will be governed by risk perception of \nthe sub-borrower only. Subloan repayment schedules will be based on the cash-flow forecasts for \nthe subprojects. PBs will revolve the repaid subloans to make further advances to SMEs within the \noverall time frame of the Project. The last date for submission of subloan applications to ADB will \nbe 3 years after the date of loan effectiveness. The last date for disbursement under any subloan \nwill be 5 years from the date of effectiveness of the ADB loan to the Republic of Indonesia. Only \nexpenditures  incurred  for  a  subproject  not  earlier  than  180  days  prior  to  receipt  by  ADB  of \nwithdrawal applications will be eligible for financing under the loan after the loan effectiveness \ndate. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n41.  The Directorate General of Financial Institutions MOF will be the Executing Agency. BEI will \nbe  the  implementing  and  loan  administration  agency  for  the  SEIF  to  be  available  through \nIndonesian state-owned and private banks to SME exporters. \n \n42.  The SEIF will provide long-term foreign currency debt funding to SME exporters, and \nindirectly  to  their  supporting  industries,  to  finance  capital  investment  loans,  excluding  land \npurchasing;  and  preinvestment/permanent  working  capital,  including  financing  for  essential \nimported inputs. The proposed loan will make available long-term funds across Indonesia to SME \nexporters who can prudently manage the foreign exchange risk.  \n \n43.  The selection of participating banks for the SEIF is based on the following criteria: (i) past \nand projected financial condition in terms of solvency, liquidity, profitability, portfolio quality, and \nefficiency in financial intermediation; (ii) past and projected track record on lending to SMEs; (iii) ", "  13\ncredit  appraisal  capabilities,  particularly  for  project  finance  to  SMEs;  (iv)  past  experience  in \nservicing credit lines of other aid agencies; and (v) corporate governance practices. During the \ndisbursement period of the proposed Project, to qualify for disbursement under the loan, a PB must \ndemonstrate compliance with the following applicable prudential regulations and guidelines of BI, \nas amended from time to time, and any other requirements of ADB through quarterly financial \nindicators to be monitored by TAMU: \n  \n(i)  capital adequacy ratio not lower than 8%;  \n(ii)  net open position of a maximum 20%;  \n(iii)  a loan to deposit ratio not higher than 100%;  \n(iv)   positive return on assets; \n(v)   NPLs should not exceed 5%;  \n(vi)   loan loss provisions; and  \n(vii)   legal lending limit, reflecting the maximum exposure to a single borrower or group of \nborrowers not exceeding 20% of capital resources.  \n \n44.  According to these criteria, BNI, BRI, Bank Mandiri, Bank Niaga, Bank Danamon, and Bank \nBukopin were pre-selected for this Project as of September 2002 and the continued compliance \nwith these criteria will be monitored through annual audited reports. Based on a thorough market \nassessment, the PBs have proposed a first-year credit line allocation of $13 million as follows: BNI \nwill have a first-year allocation of $3 million; BRI, $2.5 million; Bank Mandiri, $2 million; Bank \nNiaga, $2 million, Bank Danamon, $2 million; and Bank Bukopin, $1.5 million.  Allocations for the \nsubsequent  years  of  the  Project  will  be  based  on  first-come-first-served  basis  according  to \ndisbursement records. \n \n  1.  Project Organization and Management \n \n45.  In addition to a competent credit department, the Executing Agency, in consultation with \nBEI, will establish TAMU as a support unit. TAMU will be staffed with competent personnel, headed \nby  a  senior  BEI  official,  and  consultants.  TAMU  will  oversee  the  preparation,  appraisal,  and \nimplementation of all subprojects to be financed under the Project nationwide through the PBs. \n \n  2.  Selection, Appraisal, and Approval of Subprojects \n \n46.  ADB  will  finance  the  direct  and  indirect  foreign  exchange  costs  of  subprojects  with  a \nmaximum  ADB-funded  subloan  size  of  $600,000  for  individual  small  and  medium  exporters \n(subloan debtor); and/or subprojects with a maximum ADB-funded subloan size of $1,000,000 for \nexporters with a demonstrated business network, defined as follows: (i) a trader/manufacturer (the \nsubloan debtor) and a group of a minimum of 20 micro/SMEs (suppliers and/or subcontractors); (ii) \nboth parties (debtor and micro/SMEs) should have a letter of agreement that will state the benefits \nto micro/SMEs from the ADB subloan and will be reviewed by TAMU. Subloans for business \nnetworks are expected to benefit SME production performance with increased access to the use of \nmore  modern  machinery;  access  to  closer  marketing  and/or  production  services  from \ntraders/manufacturers; and, hence, increased production capacity or revenues from sales. All other \nconditions for the SEIF under $600,000 will apply to subloans for business networks. Subloans \nunder the SEIF will finance fixed investments including capital goods, and technology for new \ninvestment  projects  or  for  modernization  of  existing  enterprises.  Initial  incremental  foreign \nexchange working capital necessary for the operationalization of fixed investments may also be \nfinanced from the ADB loan without exceeding 35% of the total subloan. \n  \n47.  All PBs will follow the subloan approval form and appraisal reports for potential subloans \nprovided by TAMU and approved by ADB. Following internal approval by the PB, a subloan ", "14  \napplication including the subloan approval form and appraisal report will be submitted to TAMU, \nwhich will forward them to ADB. ADB will approve the first three subloans granted by each PB \nbefore establishing (i) a free limit of $450,000 per subloan for single exporters, and (ii) a free limit \nof  $750,000  per  subloan  for  exporters  with  demonstrated  business  networks.  Thereafter,  for \nsubloans above the free limits, ADB will provide approval or requested revisions based on timely \nprior receipt of adequate and complete documentation processed by TAMU. For eligible subloans \nbelow the free limit, PBs will provide direct approval and report to TAMU. For loans below the free \nlimit, TAMU will notify ADB. \n \n48.  The selection of subprojects will be based on sound banking, commercial, and financial \ncriteria reflecting economic and financial viability. In particular, the following criteria for subproject \nselection will be applied: (i) all sub-borrowers are required to be exporters and, hence, to earn \nadequate revenues in foreign exchange to repay their loans on schedule; (ii) at least 25% of the \nsubproject cost should be financed by the sub-borrower as equity; (iii) the subproject should have a \nfinancial internal rate of return not less than 12%; (iv) the sub-borrower should maintain a debt \nservice coverage ratio of no less than 1.2 times within 3 years from the date of disbursement of the \nsubloan or when the subproject's production reaches full capacity, whichever is earlier; (v) the sub-\nborrower should maintain a positive cash flow after repayments of SEIF loan interest and principal \nduring the full subloan repayment period; and (vi) sub-borrowers should have adequate collateral \nin  accordance  with  each  PB  internal  credit  assessment  process  and  BI  regulations.    Also, \nsubprojects will have to meet prevailing labor and social standards and regulations in Indonesia. \nFurther, eligible subprojects will have to comply with ADB's and the Government's procurement, \nenvironment, safety, and other social safeguard requirements, according to TAMU. \n \n49.  The sub-borrowers will manage the foreign currency risks of a subloan, while the PBs will \nmanage the credit risks of the sub-borrowers. BEI will manage bank risks. It is expected that, on \naverage, 150 subloans will result in additional investment and employment in 150 direct individual \nexporters  over  the  life  of  the  Project  and  indirectly  in  up  to  3,000  SMEs  via  subcontracting \narrangements. The PBs have already submitted a potential pipeline that will translate into an actual \npipeline worth $13 million for the first year, while the balance of $72 million will be allocated on a \nfirst-come-first-served-basis in the following 2 years. \n \n  3.  Procurement \n \n50.  ADB's Guidelines for Procurement applicable to subloans to PBs will be followed with the \nassistance of BEI and the TAMU. These guidelines may require sub-borrowers to (i) demonstrate \nthat the procurement procedures adopted are appropriate in the circumstances; (ii) ensure that the \ngoods and services to be financed by subloans are purchased at a reasonable price, account also \nbeing taken of other relevant factors such as time of delivery; efficiency and reliability of the goods; \ntheir suitability for the subproject; availability of maintenance facilities and spare parts; and, in the \ncase of services, the quality and the competence of the parties rendering them; and (iii) ensure that \nall goods and services financed under the subloans are procured from ADB member countries. \nSub-borrowers will be encouraged to adopt international competitive bidding procedures where the \namount is unusually large, and it will be in the interest of economy and efficiency to follow such \nprocedures or international shopping ones. \n \n  4.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n51.  MOF and BEI will jointly request establishment of an imprest account (special account). The \nceiling of the special account will be set at $7.5 million. The initial advance and subsequent \nreplenishments  to  the  special  account  will  be  based  on  planned  disbursements  for  the  six ", "  15\nsuccessive months of the Project. The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (Appendix 6). \n \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n52.  BEI and the PBs will have their accounts and financial statements (balance sheets, income \nstatements, and statements of sources and application of funds) audited annually in accordance \nwith sound and standard auditing standards by independent external auditors acceptable to BI and \nADB.  BEI and the PBs will submit to ADB not later than 6 months after the close of each financial \nyear their audited financial statements and annual reports.19 BEI, through TAMU, will submit to \nADB all reports that ADB may reasonably request concerning the loan and its utilization; the \nsubloans; other matters relating to the purposes of the Project; and the quarterly progress reports, \nin a format to be agreed upon with ADB, within 60 days after the end of the relevant quarter with \nassistance of TAMU; and a project completion report within 3 months of the project closing date. \n \n53.  BEI and the PBs will inform and give ADB an opportunity to comment on any substantial \namendments to the banks\u2019 management, ownership, or legal constitution. If the amendments affect \nimplementation of the proposed Project, BEI and the PBs will conduct consultations with ADB prior \nto making any final changes in their operational policies. \n \n  6.  Monitoring of Subprojects \n \n54.  TAMU at BEI will monitor the financial and economic performance of subprojects, as well as \nevaluate  their  socioeconomic  and  environmental  benefits.  In  addition,  a  random  sample  of \nsubprojects could be selected for ongoing, long-term benefit monitoring and evaluation by TAMU in \ncoordination with ADB staff. Specific data collection and reporting formats will be developed and \nimplemented in a computerized database. Specific areas to covered include (i) financial and \noperational performance of the subprojects; (ii) direct and indirect employment creation attributable \nto the subprojects (e.g., through supply of inputs); and (iii) business linkages with micro and SMEs, \nif applicable. \n \n \nIV.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n55.  The proposed TA for this project is based on the findings and recommendations of TA 3416 \n(Promoting  Deregulation  and  Competition)  and  TA  3417  (SME  Development)20  and  aims  to \ncomplement the implementation of the proposed loan to Indonesia. \n \n56.  The scope of the TA (Appendix 7) will focus on \n \n(i)  strengthening  of  SME  exporters\u2019  capacity  to  meet  eligibility  criteria  and  submit \nbankable proposals;   \n(ii)   strengthening of project and credit appraisal and monitoring capacity for PBs; and  \n(iii)   coordinating external assistance to SME exporters. \n \n57.  The TA is estimated to require $620,000 equivalent, consisting of $300,000 in foreign \nexchange  cost  and  $320,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  cover  $300,000 \n                                                 \n19  In accordance with ADB's new policy, if there is a delay in submission of annual audited accounts beyond 6 months, a \nformal warning will be issued, and if there is a delay beyond 12 months, disbursements will be suspended.  \n20  See  footnote  5.  Both  TAs  accompanied  the  ongoing  Loan  1738-INO:  Industrial  Competitiveness  and  SME \nDevelopment Loan, for $200 million approved in March 2000 and extended until December 2002.  ", "16  \nequivalent, including all of the foreign exchange cost and $200,000 equivalent of the local currency \ncost, to be financed by ADB\u2019s TA funding program on or about approval of the loan until about \nDecember 2004. The Government will finance the balance of the local currency cost in counterpart \nfunds. The TA will support TAMU at BEI in Jakarta, and promote SEIF through BDS outside \nJakarta, with emphasis on Bali. The TA will also  be complemented by ADB's ongoing TA 3829-\nINO in supporting BDS in four local governments in Central Java and South Sulawesi and ongoing \nTA 3837-INO in improving environmental performance of SMEs.21 In parallel, the Government of \nJapan, through JICA, will finance on a grant basis a SME promotion program between 2002-2006 \nfor a total of $5 million equivalent. JICA\u2019s SME program includes institutional support to BEI, \nsupport to provincial export training and promotion centers in East Java, North Sumatra, South \nSulawesi and South Kalimantan, and a study on SME clusters. The TA and JICA\u2019s SME promotion \nprogram will be implemented in close coordination with ongoing TA from other sources such as the \nWorld Bank and IFC (see Appendix 5). \n \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Impact of Export-Oriented SME Development on Poverty \n \n58.  An ADB Poverty Assessment for Indonesia has identified SME growth as one of the main \nengines for pro-poor growth when supported by well-functioning competitive markets.22 In 2001, \nADB also signed a Poverty Partnership Agreement with the Government to reduce the level of \nabsolute poverty by half by 2015, putting poverty reduction at the center of its development \nstrategy in Indonesia. While the largest number of absolute poor live on Java, the percentage of \nthe population below the poverty line is greater in the outer islands. Policy and project lending will \nhave a positive impact on poverty to the extent that it increases the incomes of workers and their \nfamilies. These increases in incomes from paid labor\u2014the main asset of the poor\u2014will help raise \nthem over the poverty line, and, hence, reduce their absolute number, as well as the percentage of \npeople under the poverty line. \n \n59.  The employment impact of the loan is expected to be large (Appendix 8).  SMEEDP-funded \nexpansion will necessitate increased labor inputs both in the form of direct employment and \nthrough increased demand for raw materials or intermediate inputs provided by individuals or \nmicroenterprises. For example, where the availability of kiln-dried wood is a limitation, investment \nin a wood kiln dryer, will allow a furniture manufacturer to accept more orders and create an \nenlarged market for the supply of components and raw materials. While there are also some \nemployment  impacts  related  to  the  physical  implementation  of  the  expansion  such  as  in \nconstruction,  the  employment  impacts  referred  to  here  are  sustainable  for  the  life  of  the \ninvestment.  Moreover additional employment is generated as SMEEDP funds are repaid and re-\nlent. \n \n60.  The first round impact of the investment is estimated to be between 1 million and 2 million \njob-years with relatively low capital-labor ratios and high labor productivity compared with large \nenterprises. Increases in capital expenditures (hence, in exports) will translate into higher gains in \nemployment among SMEs than in larger firms. The initial pipeline of investments proposed for the \nSMEEDP suggests an employment impact of 1.5 million job-years for a total project investment of \n                                                 \n21  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Improving the Environmental Performance of Small \nand Medium Enterprises by Promoting Cleaner Production. Manila. \n22  ADB. 2002. Assessment of Poverty in Indonesia. Vol. 1 and 2.  ", "  17\nabout $110 million.23  One case study of the fish processing with cold storage equipment in South \nSulawesi indicated substantial demand for SMEEDP loan products for upgrading and expansion, \nsuggesting that for each $500,000 invested, 500 new full time jobs-years are created, requiring the \ninputs from 10,000 fisherfolk-years.  A separate review of a KfW credit line for clean technologies \nin SMEs shows that a $50,000 investment in a plastics chipping factory generated 100 additional \njobs years and required 800 person-years to provide sufficient recyclable waste material to meet \nthe needs of the new investment. \n \n61.  Finally,  there  is  a  significant  potential  impact  on  poverty  by  subprojects  in  furniture-\nexporting clusters in Jepara-Semarang (Central Java). Most exporters interviewed indicated that \nthey would invest to double their exports. For example, between 1996 and 1999, average exports \nfrom Jepara increased by almost $50 million and generated 7,518 additional jobs. Extrapolating \nfrom this experience, a doubling of exports  in Jepara with support of the SEIF could generate \naround 7,500 additional direct jobs, and more than 75,000 supporting jobs. All these are indicative \nof the high and low case scenarios for employment impact. \n \nB.  Financial Analysis of Indicative Pipeline \n \n62.  The analysis, based on about 60 potential specific SME subprojects identified by the PBs \nduring June-September 2002, demonstrates the strong demand for the SEIF (Appendix 9). As of \n30 September 2002, the PBs had provided basic information on 62 SME exporters, who are \npotential SEIF borrowers. The subprojects have a range of financial internal rates of return from \n15% to 100%, and adequate average debt service ratios of 1.9. Sixty percent of the subprojects \nare in regions outside Java such as the islands of Sulawesi, Kalimantan, Sumatra, and Bali. Most \nindustries involve wood, fish, or handicraft products, which are consistent with the high presence of \nmicro and SMEs in these industries. The indicative pipeline of $28 million supports the amounts \npre-allocated to the PBs during the first year and the overall loan utilization. \n \nC.  Environment \n \n63.  The  Project  will  have  a  beneficial  environmental  impact  through  the  replacement  of \nobsolete technology by new, cleaner, and more environment-friendly technology as supported by \nan  ongoing  TA  3837-INO  (Appendix  10).  Not  only  will  cleaner  production  practices  reduce \nenvironmental  problems  and  conserve  natural  resources  but  they  can  help  boost  access  to \ninternational markets by small Indonesian exporters who do not always meet international quality \nstandards. Under the proposed project, the Government and BEI will ensure that all subprojects \ncomply with the applicable government environmental standards and requirements and with ADB's \npolicies, and that appropriate safeguards and mechanisms for compliance are built into each \nsubproject, as necessary. While environmental screening of all proposed investments is necessary, \nthe initial environmental examination or environmental impact assessment will be carried out when \nwarranted.  Every  subproject  will  conform  to  the  Environmental  Assessment  Procedures  and \nRequirements of the Government and ADB. \n \nD.  Exchange and Commercial Risks \n \n64.  There are no foreign exchange risks in transactions for BEI or the PBs. In subloans under \nthe SEIF, exporters with the SEIF loans will be naturally protected against foreign exchange risks \nbecause of their foreign exchange earnings. \n                                                 \n23  Estimates are based on a $35 million investment with an additional 47,000 job-years in SME sub-borrowers, plus 15 \nsubcontractor job-years for each of these jobs (i.e., 705,000 job-years).  ", "18  \n \n65.  Under the SEIF, the financial risk of NPLs (due to bad credit decisions) will be mitigated by \nstrict application of the requirements for financial soundness of the sub-borrower and viability of \ntheir investments through business advisory services. TAMU, and associated TA from external \nsources, will support the ability of the PBs to enhance their credit appraisal capacities and apply \ntheir own (and ADB\u2019s) criteria for subloan processing in accordance with ADB's standards. The \nPBs\u2019 branch networks should give them access to local knowledge with respect to the performance \nand character of the applicants reducing default risks.  \n \n66.  Under the SEIF, borrowing SMEs will be sensitive to marketing risks, particularly in export \nmarkets. Any failure in marketing would reduce their financial viability and ability to service debt. \nThis risk is mitigated by the project design, which focuses on products in which Indonesia has a \nclear comparative advantage such as labor-intensive products like furniture and agroprocessing. \nSub-borrowers will be required to demonstrate their marketing strategies. \n \n \nVI.

Indonesian exports have been slow to recover from the crisis. Companies manufacturing \nfor export, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs), have substantial growth potential.2  \nSME exports have grown over time but still represent a small fraction of the total (Figure A2.1). \nOn the supply side, the recent drop or stagnation of Indonesian exports was caused mostly by \n\u201ctraditional\u201d factors, such as (i) strengthening of the rupiah exchange rate, (ii) instability of \nsecurity and law enforcement, (iii) high transaction costs due to corruption, and (iv) frequent \nlabor activities demanding wage increases. On the demand side, the drop of the manufacturing \nsector occurred, among others in footwear, fish and shrimp, chemical products, spices, coffee, \ntea, and jewelry, which involve mostly SME suppliers. These Indonesian products are losing \nagainst similar competitive products from emerging economies such as People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, India, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n \nFigure A2.1: Total and SME Non-oil and Gas Exports \n1993-2001 ($ million)\n60,000.00 \nTotal Non-Oil and Gas Exports  $47,757 \n50,000.00 \n$43,406 \n$41,821 $40,975 \n$38,873\n$38,093 \n40,000.00  $34,954 \n$30,360 \n$27,077 \n30,000.00 \n20,000.00 \nSmall Industry Exports\n10,000.00 \n$1,685  $2,214  $2,160  $2,503 $2,522  $3,646 $2,552  $3,049  $3,659 \n0.00 \n1993  1994  1995  1996 1997 1998 1999 2000  2001\nSource: Ministry of Industry and Trade (Small Industry Exports)  as cited by Urata, Shujiro (2000, Table I-7). \"Policy \nRecommendation for SME Promotion in the Republic of Indonesia,\u201d July, JICA, 1999-2001 are estimates from same \nsource.

Most  of  Indonesia\u2019s  non-oil  and  gas  exports  are  products  with  some  degree  of \nprocessing or manufacturing (almost 88%, see Table A2.1). For those produced on a contract \nbasis for internationally known brand names, such as electronics and footwear, trade promotion \nmay be limited, because these products already have international marketing managed from \noutside Indonesia. Products with a niche market could offer more results for trade promotion. \nMany of these exports are undertaken in sectors that have (or are expected to have) a large \nnumber of SMEs, and even microenterprises. \n \n                                                 \n1   Prepared by Jan ter Wengel, Department of Economics, Free University of Amsterdam. \n2   Most Indonesian exports have some degree of processing or manufacturing.

There is a large body of literature describing SME presence in export markets. However, \ndifferences in the size classification prevent a clear distinction of sectors where SMEs are well \nestablished within a specific subsector or commodity. Table A2.1 summarizes SME presence in \nsome major industrial or manufactured products by indicating whether there is a \u201clow\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d \npotential  presence  of  SMEs,  according  to  many  sources.  For  example,  SME  exports  are \n                                                 \n3   Sixty percent of the sector exports was shrimp (37%), cocoa (9%), coffee (11%), and tuna (5%). \n4   Ninety five percent of the sector exports was cooper ore (53%) and coal (42%). \n ", "  Appendix 2  25\nexpected  to  be  concentrated  in  the  wood  products  and  textile,  garments,  and  footwear \nsubsectors. Together, some authors estimate that these subsectors are responsible for some \n50% of SME exports from Indonesia. In addition, basic machinery contributes another 16% to \nSME exports.  Smallholders are important in growing food and cash crops, and there is potential \nfor further SME involvement, however, much of the processing and exporting takes place \nthrough larger firms. Overall, a closer look at Indonesian SME exports reveals the following \nmain characteristics: \n \n(i)  SME exports are concentrated in labor-intensive subsectors where low wages \nare important to enhance the comparative and competitive position of foreign \nmarkets.  \n(ii)  Indonesian SME exports are concentrated in clusters. It is well known that SME \nfurniture,  garments,  and  basic  machinery  production  is  located  primarily  in \nagglomerations of small firms. These clusters participate in international trade \nnetworks to bring down the transaction costs of international trade. \n(iii)  SME exports have increased throughout the crisis years due to their relatively \nlimited  reliance  on  imported  components  compared  with  those  of  larger \ncompanies.  \n \n4.  Presently, only the Central Bureau of Statistics (Biro Pusat Statistik [BPS]) makes a \nsystematic distinction among household (cottage), small, medium, and large-scale enterprises \non the basis of the number of workers.  Our focus will be on SMEs and large enterprises, not \nmicroenterprises.  According  to  the  1996  CBS  census,  the  microenterprise  sector  employs \nnearly two thirds of the manufacturing workforce. Despite their large contribution to employment, \ndata on microenterprises tend to be unavailable in a comparable format to those of more \nstructured businesses. More importantly, promotion of microenterprises may not necessarily be \na high- return activity, such as export activity, for countries in need of an acceleration in growth. \nLarger increases in productivity occur as firms grow into the small and/or medium categories. \nSee Figure A2.2.  \n  Figure A2.2: Missing a \"Productive Middle\"\nIndonesia's Manufacturing, 1996\n14000\n45% \nng  40%  12000\nanufacturi 3305%%   Employment  10000 worker \nment in M 25%  \"Missing Middle\" 8000 upiah per \nploy 20%  6000 90 R\nEm15%  19\nof  4000\nge  10%  Productivity (GDP per worker) \na\nent 2000\nc 5% \ner\nP\n0%  0\n1-4  5-19 20-99  100+ \nSource: BPS.

If one takes the 5-year \nspan between 1996 and 2000 to examine the impact of the crisis, one allows for some time to \nadjust after the unprecedented contraction of 1998.  The Asian Crisis caused a large turmoil in \nIndonesia\u2019s industrial structure, even though in the aggregate the number of firms appeared to \nbe  almost  unaffected.  This  appendix  uses  the  latest  available  data  for  more  than  20,000 \nindustrial enterprises from the Annual Manufacturing Survey of 1996 and 2000 produced by the \nCentral Bureau of Statistics. Surveys recorded 22,997 firms in operation in 1996 and 22,174 in \n2000, i.e., a modest decline of 3.5% in the number of firms. However, the first impression when \none compares these two snapshots hides the fact that 6,100 firms (26.5% of all firms in 1996) \nclosed down between 1996 and 2000, and 5,277 new firms started operations during the same \nperiod. \n \n6.  Despite of the great upheaval in firm numbers among the smallest firms, the number of \njobs in the very small-scale sector (small enterprises employing 20-49 workers) remained about \nthe same. Due to firm closures, 121 thousand jobs were lost; the expansion of the remaining \nsmallest firms led to 28,000 more jobs; and, the new smallest firms created 91,000 jobs. The net \nresult was an employment loss of less than 1%.  In all other size categories (except the largest \nfirms), firms showed increments in total employment. The largest firms lost nearly 50,000 jobs \nprimarily as a result of employment reduction in the surviving very large industries, which \nshowed a contraction rather than an expansion. The resulting jobs became more productive. \nIncreases in value added with a constant labor force would point to an increase in productivity \nthat might lead to increased exports. The gains in value added proved to be highest for the \nsmallest firms and lower for the remaining sectors. In fact, the increase in productivity registered \nby small firms probably accounts for the lion\u2019s share of the impressive increase in exports by \nthese firms. When one compares the 2000 figures with the 1996 figures, small firms increased \ntheir exports by 83% while exports of the largest enterprises decreased by 10% (Table A2.2).  \n \nTable A2.2: Exports by Firm Dynamics, Indonesia, 1996-2000 \n(billion constant 2000 rupiah) \n \nChanges \nChange in  Changes in  Percentage \nWorker- in  Total Change  Total  % \nExports  Exports  of Total \nbased  Exports  in Exports in  Exports  Export \nbecause of  because of   Exports in \nSize1  because  2000  in 1996  Growth \nFirm Exits  Expansions 2000 \nof New \nEntries \n  (1)  (2)  (3)  (4)=(1)+(2)+(3) (5)  (4)/(5)  (6)=(4)+(5)/\nSmall 1  -354  608 579 833 1001 83.2  1.3%\nSmall 2  -448  571 1287 1409 2531 55.7  2.8%\nMedium 1  -830  2866 3311 5347 7346 72.8  9.1%\nMedium 2  -1832  3204 4279 5652 23958 23.6  21.2%\nLarge 1  -2793  7170 5608 9985 23440 42.6  23.9%\nLarge 2  -5288  -5486 4540 -6233 64336 -9.7  41.6%\nTOTAL  -11546  8934 19604 16992 122613 13.9  100.0%\n1  Small 1 (20-49 workers); Small 2 (50-99 workers); Medium (100-100 workers); Medium 2 (200-499 workers); \nLarge 1 (500-999 workers); and Large 2 (1,000 workers or more). \nSource: 1996 and 2000 Industrial Surveys. BPS. \n \n7.  Financing, equipment, and materials are just some of the key inputs for producing \nexports. First, lack of credit has often been identified as one of the major obstacles to the growth \n ", "  Appendix 2  27\nof SMEs.  Therefore, we introduce the availability of finance, as proxied by the interest paid by \nfirms on loans, to examine the impact of finance on exports. Also, the relative use of machinery \ncould also be considered an explanatory variable for SME exports.  Thus the use of machinery \nwould  indicate  specialization  and  the  capacity  to  produce  according  to  narrowly  defined \ntechnical specifications.  These characteristics should be conducive to export. Finally, the value \nof imported inputs is important in the explanation of exports when specific imports are essential \nto the production of exports, and the exporting activity is related to assembly rather than \nproduction.  \n \n8.  Access to credit proved a significant variable in the explanation of exports in both the \nSME and large sectors. While some of the success by SMEs in overcoming the crisis years has \nbeen related to their lack of bank loans (the Asia Foundation and other surveys indicate that \nless than one fifth of SMEs had access to bank loans), the negative effect of bank loans on \nenterprises  tended  to  be  stronger  for  non-exporting  enterprises  that  took  loans  in  foreign \ncurrency and that were affected by the subsequent devaluation after the crisis. Bank loans or \n\u201cfinancial inputs\u201d are still important determinants to sustain export activity. \n \n9.  The relative use of machinery also proved to be a significant export determinant in both \nthe SME and large sectors.  The significance of the positive coefficient for the SME sector is, \nhowever, much greater than that for the large sector.  Thus, the great importance of labor \nproductivity in the explanation of SME exports may be related to the use of machinery. This fact \nonly reinforces the view that SME sector exports are to a large extent driven by specialization \nand productivity. This view may be further supported by the fact that large sector exports appear \nto be much more dependent on imported inputs. The coefficient for imported inputs is highly \nsignificant for the large sector, while it has no statistical significance in the SME regression. The \nhigh reliance on imported inputs among large conglomerates in Indonesia also affected their \ncapacity to recover from the crisis. Many large sector enterprises may be engaged in assembly \nof imported parts rather than direct production operations. \n \n10.  SMEs  rely  more  on  specialization,  productivity,  and  external  industrial  services  to \naccomplish  export  competitiveness  than  their  large-scale  counterparts.  Based  on  recent \nindustrial statistics and comparing them with those of the precrisis period, Indonesian SMEs \nshow higher growth in productivity and exports than their larger counterparts. Case studies have \nindicated that various mechanisms were already at work in Indonesian manufacturing SMEs \nsuch as technology diffusion through foreign buyers, active subcontracting, and clustering. \nOther factors have also contributed to export growth such as the ability to secure access to \ncredit.  The  crisis  itself  appears  to  have  shed  unproductive  enterprises,  improved  labor \nproductivity and increased exports, especially among the smallest enterprises. Policies that \nfocus on SME-specific success factors or strengths such as specialization may prove to be \nmore effective to overcome the hefty disparity between SMEs and large corporations, and boost \nSME export potential. \n \n \n ", "28  Appendix 3 \n \nOVERALL PERFORMANCE OF BANKING SECTOR AND INTERMEDIARY BANKS1 \n \nA.  Overview of the Banking System \n \n1.  After the crisis, the Government of Indonesia embarked on a liquidation and stabilization \nprogram  to  restore  public  confidence  in  the  banking  sector,  which  has  proven  costly  but \neffective. Despite the fact that government bonds for recapitalization of banks amounted to \nRp645 trillion or $76 billion, the comprehensive bank restructuring has helped remarkably to \nimprove  banking  sector  indicators  (Table  A3.1).  Banks\u2019  capital  and  profits  improved,  and \nnonperforming loans (NPLs) in the system declined. Total banking sector capital, which had \ndropped sharply to negative Rp129.8 trillion after the crisis in 1998, recovered to Rp62.3 trillion \nin 2001. Total profit before tax recovered from negative Rp178.6 trillion to Rp131 trillion, and \nNPLs from 48.6% to 12.1% during the same period. Despite the improved performance of the \nbanking sector in 2001 and 2002, several factors still hinder their intermediation function. Loans \n(in both local currency and foreign exchange) dropped dramatically after the crisis and have yet \nto recover precrisis levels, and so has the use of deposits for loans. Banks prefer high interest \npayments from recapitalization bonds to the risk of lending. Loan-to-deposit ratios (LDRs) are \nmuch higher for foreign exchange than for local currency. In 2001, the banks\u2019 LDR for foreign \ncurrency stood at 63.8%, more than double the LDR for local currency.  \n \nTable A3.1: Banking Indicators, Indonesia, 1998-2001 \n \nIndicator  1998 1999 2000  2001\nDeposits (Rp trillion)  625.4 617.6 699.1  797.4\nCapital (Rp trillion)  (129.8) (41.2) 52.3  62.3\nTotal Assets (Rp trillion)  895.5 1,006.7 1,030.5  1,099.7\nLDR in Local Currency  72.8% 28.5% 27.4%  31.4%\nLDR in Foreign Exchange  121.8% 63.7% 70.8%  63.8%\nLoans in Local Currency (Rp trillion)  313.1 140.5 152.5  202.6\nLoans in Foreign Exchange (Rp trillion)  174.3 84.6 116.5  105.0\nNPL \u2013 gross (%)  48.6 32.8 18.8  12.1\nNPL \u2013 net (%)  34.7 7.3 5.8  3.6\nProfit (Loss) before Tax (Rp trillion)  (178.6) (91.7) 10.5  13.1\nROA (%)  0.38 (9.11) 1.02  1.19\nLDR = loan-to-deposit ratio, NPL = nonperforming loan, ROA = return on assets   \nSource: Bank Indonesia. \n \n2.  Credit from banks requires better intermediation. Credit for investment (long-term) loans \nhas  been  slower  in  recovering,  even  more  so  in  the  case  of  investment  credit  in  foreign \nexchange (Figure A3.1). Progress in credit and corporate restructuring has been slow because \nof (i) prolonged disagreement on terms and conditions of debt restructuring between debtors \nand  creditors;  (ii)  decline  in  collateral  value  under  the  current  economic  conditions; \n(iii) increased country risk,2 which has resulted in higher interest costs for financing abroad for \nexporters and for domestic banks borrowing from overseas, and has made foreign investors risk \naverse concerning the investment in Indonesia; (iv) volatility at the exchange rate; and (v) the \nuncertainty and complexity of legal matters. Banks generally prefer holding government bonds \nfor stable interest income to disposing of them in order to provide new credit, given the limited \n                                                 \n1   Prepared by Eiichi Sasaki, Investment Officer, SEGF, in collaboration with Edgard Rodriguez, Michael Ryan, and \nHari Purnomo. \n2  In September 2002, Standard & Poor\u2019s upgraded the sovereign rating for Indonesia from selective default to \nCCC+ (foreign currency) and C (local currency). \n ", "Appendix 3  29 \nalternatives available for low-risk lending under the current less conducive macroeconomic \nconditions. \n \n Figure A3.1.

Banks are urged to increase credit to all economic sectors, in particular small and \nmedium enterprises (SMEs). However, there is no unique definition of an SME, let alone a \ncommon definition of an SME loan. Lack of data about the ultimate beneficiaries of small loans \nexplains why the working hypothesis has been to use \u201csmall loans\u201d as a synonym for \u201cSME \nloans.\u201d In fact, the trend has been for banks to move to smaller loans as part of their shift away \nfrom large corporations. Banks have slowly started to regard loans to SMEs as profitable \nbecause  of  (i)  the  relatively  low  portion  of  NPLs  in  this  segment,  (ii)  their  need  for  risk \ndiversification, (iii) the higher profit margin in SME lending, (iv) low sensitivity to changes in \ninterest rates, and (v) SMEs\u2019 compliance with their loan repayment obligations. Table A3.2 \nshows the breakdown of loans by size and by type of bank. As of 2001, \u201cmicro and small\u201d loans \n(below  Rp1  billion)  were  equivalent  to  18.7%  of  the  total  credit,  while  \u201cmicro,  small,  and \nmedium\u201d loans (below Rp5 billion), corresponded to 27.4%. Of all loans below Rp5 billion, state \nand private banks (the latter have various degrees of state ownership after their restructuring) \nprovided most (82.7%) vis-\u00e0-vis the share of 11.2% for foreign banks.  Large increases in SME \nlending by Indonesian banks in 2002 and 2003 are expected in these size categories, which \nbanks refer as retail (micro and small) and mid market (small and medium) loans. \n \nTable A3.2.

On the one hand, banks need to consider the \nquality of their portfolios. The overall trend for NPLs has been to decline consistently with the \nsuccess of the restructuring of the banking sector. NPLs for SME loans show that the quality of \nthis portfolio has been high throughout and they pose no immediate risk for banks (Table A3.3). \nOn  the  other  hand,  banks  still  need  to  implement  better  systems  that  will  allow  them  to \nsuccessfully enlarge their SME business, let alone SME investment credit. Most of the banks \nunder consideration are in the midst of launching corporate strategies that will help them to \nimprove their product mix, credit and pricing policies, human resource mix, branch network \nconfiguration, and management information systems (Table A3.3). Most importantly, a change \nin mindset may be needed not just at the head office, but at each and every branch. Without \nsuch fundamental changes, larger SME portfolios could lead to greater losses in the future. \n \n5.  Part of the change in strategy for lending to SMEs includes an increased portion of \nlending for SMEs (Table A3.4). The proposed project aims at increasing the availability of long-\nterm funds in foreign exchange for investment lending among SME exporters. The participating \nbanks (PBs) under the project have (i) good prospects for privatization in the near future; (ii) \ngood developments in terms of SME focus in their operations (as reflected in their annual \nreports and interviews); (iii) very good quality of SME lending, with average NPLs significantly \nbelow 5%; (iv) reasonably high use of foreign exchange in terms of LDRs in foreign exchange; \nand (v) absorptive capacity for the Project\u2019s funds that reflects their current absorption of loans \nin foreign exchange and their clientele of exporters.

Bank Ekspor Indonesia \n \n1.  Ownership, Management, and Organization \n \n6.  Bank  Ekspor  Indonesia  (BEI),  wholly  owned  by  the  Indonesian  Government,  was \nestablished in July 1999 and was granted a business license in August 1999 under Indonesia\u2019s \nbanking act. Subscribed and paid-up capital is Rp3 trillion (approximate $312 million). BEI \noperates through a board consisting of three commissioners appointed by the Government, a \nboard of directors consisting of a president director and two managing directors, nine divisional \nheads,  and  two  regional  marketing  office  heads.  All  board  members  (commissioner  and \ndirectors) have passed the fit and proper test of Bank Indonesia (BI). \n \n2.   Policies, Scope of Operations, and Lending Policies and Procedures \n \n7.  The  board  focuses  on  maintaining  BEI  operations  in  line  with  Government  Decree \nno.37/1999, which states that the objective of BEI is to support the development of Indonesian \nexporters\u2019 competitiveness. BEI is a special bank that does not provide the usual commercial \nbanking services such as deposit facilities. It focuses specifically on every aspect of export \nfinancing. Almost every business cycle in export-import financing activities can be supported by \nBEI, from import LC guarantee up to export bill receivable discounting. Other financing and \nservices provided by BEI are import LC financing, pre-shipment export financing guarantee, \nexport working capital loan financing, and investment financing (under the proposed Small and \nMedium Enterprise Export Development Project). \n \n  3.  Operational Performance \n \n8.  A summary of BEI\u2019s operational performance (actual income for 1999 to 2001 and \nprojected income for 2002) is given below. Compared with 2000, total assets of 2001 decreased \nby 12.79%, due to the repayment of the bank\u2019s borrowing to the Japan Bank for International \nCooperation (JBIC) two-step loan scheme. Although in 2001, BEI started to pay back its funding \nfrom JBIC, the bank\u2019s financing facilities grew significantly from only Rp157 million in 1999 to \nRp5.8  trillion  in  2001.  Therefore  to  maintain  financing  activities,  BEI  should  establish  its \ncredibility in order to find other funding sources. BEI\u2019s overall operating performance for 2001, \nbased on BI-CAMEL criteria for soundness of a bank, was a \u201csound/healthy\u201d rating of 97.13%. \n \n4.  Financial Performance and Portfolio Quality \n \n9.  In its first year of operation in 1999, BEI made a small profit, and its capital base \nremained intact. Moreover, in 2000 and 2001, BEI generated a large amount of profit before \ntax\uf8e7Rp248 billion in 2000 and Rp438 billion in 2001 (Table A3.5). It is thus considered one of \nthe most profitable banks in Indonesia in terms of return on assets (ROA) and return on equity \n(ROE) ratios. In 2001, BEI had an ROA of 3.30% and a ROE of 8.44%, much higher than the \naverage 1.2% ROA of the banking industry in Indonesia as a whole. Its ratio of possible loss-\nincurring assets to total earning assets in 2001 was zero, whereas the ratio of allowance for \npossible losses to total earning assets was 1.4%. It has no nonperforming loan portfolio. \n \n  5.  Future Performance and Conclusion \n \n10.  As a bank with a focus on export activities and exporters, BEI should have a strong \nfunding in foreign exchange to cover the demand of exporters. A major challenge ahead is to \n ", "Appendix 3  35 \n \nfind other funding sources if the JBIC foreign currency loan cannot be extended. BEI should be \nable to find other funding sources with interest rates lower than commercial market (JBIC\u2019s rate \nwas remarkably lower than the commercial rate), so that BEI can relend or refinance other \nbanks at competitive rates. By having reasonably priced wholesale funding, BEI could generate \nan  adequate  profit  margin  to  cover  its  costs  and  to  provide  low  interest  rates  to  support \nexporters. \n \n11.  The management of BEI has composed a blueprint of the BEI Corporate Plan for 2000-\n2004 that is to be implemented for the next five years. The Corporate Plan is essential for BEI \nas a long-term business and growth strategy to fulfill its vision of becoming a world class export \ncredit agency with implementation of good corporate governance and internationally accepted \noperational procedures. With the strong performance BEI has achieved during the past 3 years, \nBEI\u2019s day-to-day operations in 2002 anticipate such future role. \n \n12.  BEI had also achieved a significant improvement in serving SMEs. According to its \nannual report, operations involving SMEs grew by 153.11% in 2001, representing a share of \nmore than half of all loan disbursements (Rp7.33 trillion). \n \n  Table A3.5\nBank Ekspor Indonesia Summary Balance Sheet\n(as of 31 December 2001) \n(Rp million)\nItem  Projected\n1999 2000 2001  2002\nAssets \nCash on Hand  1 22 99  100\nDue from Bank Indonesia  1,365 290,577 810  972\nDue from Other Banks  870,076 9,802,881 5,365,579  765,579\nLoans  Receivable - net  157,196 2,718,357 5,844,027  6,428,430\nOther Assets  1,998,860 69,463 22,849  2,690,280\nTOTAL ASSETS  3,027,498 12,881,300 11,233,364  9,885,360\nLiabilities    \n   Due to Other Banks  0 77,009 16,455  21,392\n   Other Liabilities  8,388 27,669 53,208  3,118,417\n   Fund Borrowing  0 9,595,000 7,800,000  3,200,000\nTotal Liabilities  8,388 9,699,678 7,869,663  6,339,809\nShareholders' Funds     \n     Equity  3,000,000 3,000,000 3,000,000  3,000,000\n     Reserves         1 9,110      181,622         363,701       5  45,552\nTotal Stockholders' Funds   3 ,019,110   3,181,622     3,363,701   3   ,545,552\nTotal Liabilities and Shareholders' Funds 3,027,498 12,881,300 11,233,364  9,885,360\nCapital-Adequacy Ratio     ( % )     8 ,053.18 132.40 135.52  155%\nLoan-Deposits Ratio  (BI Regulation) ( % )  0.00 0.00 0.00  0.00\nBI = Bank Indonesia \nSource: Bank Ekspor Indonesia (BEI). \n \n ", " 36  Appendix 4 \nECONOMIC AND SECTOR WORK, 1998-2002 \n \n \n \n1998  Wieland, Robert et al.

TAMU will be located at BEI during the course of \nthe Project. The consultants are expected to be either international or domestic individual \nconsultants. \n \n2.  TAMU will focus on: \n \n(i)  coordinating  sub-loan  processing  administration  and  monitoring  procedures \nbetween  PBs,  MOF  and  ADB  according  to  the  agreed  implementation \narrangements;  \n(ii)  supporting MOF and BEI to prepare reports or provide documentation in relation \nto loan administration;  \n(iii)  providing  lessons  learned  on  the  on-going  administration  of  the  new  apex \nmodality  to  improve  financial  intermediation  and  on  the  intermediation \nexperiences of other regional export agencies;  \n(iv)  improving skills of credit officers from the PBs related to project identification and \nappraisal of small investment projects; \n(v)  supporting eligible SME exporters to apply for SEIF through the eligible PBs, \nespecially in locations outside Jakarta with export potential; \n(vi)  reviewing letters of agreement for the economic impact on micro and SMEs of \neligible sub-projects,  including the nature of the business network;  \n(vii)  promoting SEIF in coordination with other donor activities in support of SME \nexporters; and \n(viii)  reviewing the initial environment examination of sub-projects by PBs to identify \nenvironmentally sensitive subprojects. \n \n3.  TAMU will only have an advisory and monitoring role. The approval of subloans takes \nplace at the selected PBs, which will assess the credit risk of SME exporters. BEI and ADB \n(Indonesia Resident Mission or IRM) will process subloan applications in accordance with the \nimplementation arrangements.  \n \n4.  Throughout the project\u2019s implementation, ADB will maintain in parallel close coordination \nwith the expert from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) at BEI. JICA is the \nadministrator of Japan\u2019s SME promotion program in Indonesia, which includes activities such as \nthe  export  training  centers.  In  1988,  the  Government  of  Japan  provided  a  grant  of  about \n$16 million equivalent to finance the establishment of the Indonesia Export Training Center \n(IETC). In conjunction with the proposed TA, Japan\u2019s SME promotion program aims at setting \nup four regional export training and promotion centers to provide training for export, trade \ninformation and promotion services for SMEs in East Java (starting in 2002), North Sumatra and \nSouth Sulawesi (2003) and Kalimantan (2004).  \n \n5.  In parallel, other donors will also support TAMU through their actual or planned activities \nbetween 2002 and 2005.

Background \n \n1.  The poverty reduction potential of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Indonesia \nhas been well demonstrated.  The Poverty Assessment (PA) for Indonesia2 notes that policies \nfostering  SMEs  are  key  to  reducing  poverty,  as  the  number  of  SMEs  is  large,  they  are \ndistributed all over the country, they use labor-intensive technology, and they can absorb lower- \nskill labor. The last point is particularly important, as 60% of the prime age labor force3 has had \nonly 6 years of education or less.   \n \n2.  SMEs are a major stepping-stone out of poverty and an engine of growth. Unskilled or \nsemiskilled workers are coupled with technology, thereby increasing their productivity more than \ncould otherwise be done through the application of their labor alone. The Economic Census4 \nshows that the productivity of workers triples as they move from micro to small enterprises and \ntriples again from small to medium enteprises.  The 1995 national input-output (I/O) matrix5 also \nindicates a relatively high value-added multiplier in the sectors where SMEs are concentrated. \nThese sectors include agricultural product processing, basic iron and steel industries, textiles \nand clothing, and wood products. The I/O tables also show high labor productivity in these same \nsectors. The trade sector, another important area of SME concentration, reports high value \nadded, but not necessarily high labor productivity.  \n \n3.  By contrast the agriculture sector, where the poor are concentrated, shows much lower \nvalue added and labor productivity. Higher value added and labor productivity are reflected in \nworker wages. Therefore one would expect SME workers to fare better than informal sector \nworkers.  Monitoring  changes  in  welfare  through  real  wages6  indicates  that  workers  in  the \nmanufacturing sector have fared much better than agricultural laborers and urban informal \nsector workers7 since mid-1999, when the impact of the crisis began to recede.   \n \n4.  SMEs provide employment opportunities for both men and women.  Some industries are \nvery male dominated such as the basic metal industries and furniture.  Other industries such as \nfood processing and garments are very female-oriented. Overall, the trade and manufacturing \nsectors provide employment for a larger proportion of the female workforce, nearly double the \nrate of males for the lower two income quintiles, representing the poor and near poor. SMEs \nprovide  the  main  alternative  to  agriculture  in  rural  areas  where  many  are  located  to  take \nadvantage of the availability of land and water, or the proximity of raw materials. \n \n5.  In addition to providing necessary quality work opportunities for Indonesia\u2019s burgeoning \nlabor force, SMEs promote more employment creation by drawing on goods and services from \nthe sectors where the poor are concentrated.  As with value added and labor productivity, the \nI/O tables show deep backward linkages in the sectors populated by SMEs. \n                                                 \n1   Prepared by Lisa Kulp, Social Sector Development Specialist, SERD. \n2   ADB. 2000.

The relative resilience of SMEs through the crisis, their close ties to sectors where the \npoor provide goods and services, and especially their labor absorption capacity have highlighted \ntheir potential for poverty reduction. The Indonesian labor force must absorb about 2.5 million \nnew entrants each year. As the Indonesian labor market is relatively mobile, the immediate \nresult of the 1997 economic crisis was a shifting of workers across sectors, with agriculture, the \nsafety net of last resort, registering the largest increase. But after nearly 5 years of moribund \ngrowth, unemployment is rising, particularly among the young, fueling existing trends toward \nincreased social tension and instability. \n \n7.  While the 2001 Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement (PRPA) notes the importance \nof pro-poor growth and employment promotion, the First Annual Poverty Reduction Partnership \nReview, which was signed in April 2002, further notes that \u201cgiven the sustained high levels of \npoverty and unemployment and low level of growth, greater emphasis must be placed on a \nshort-term  growth  program  to  accelerate  pro-poor  growth  for  employment  creation  without \ncompromising  macroeconomic  stability.\u201d    Although  the  PRPA  review  did  not  prescribe  the \nmeans to accelerate pro-poor growth for employment creation, support for SME development, \nparticularly SMEs in trade and manufacturing, is clearly one such avenue. \n \n8.  The decline in poverty from the mid-1980s into the 1990s was largely due to a rise in \ntrade and exports.  The PA notes that this rise was due to policies stimulating labor-intensive \nexports, which enabled the shift of workers from agriculture into higher productivity jobs in the \nsectors where the export-based SMEs are clustered. By the mid-1990s, however, Indonesia\u2019s \ncompetitive advantage was weakening. While the first phase of export-oriented industrialization, \nbased on simple technologies and cheap labor, remains important, it can no longer be relied \nupon exclusively as the prime mover of growth and poverty reduction. To this end, the Poverty \nPartnership Agreement notes that Indonesia will have to make the transition to the next phase \nof industrial development based on technology- and skill-intensive industries. \n \n9.  How well Indonesia makes this transition will depend on its ability to access knowledge \nand funding for the necessary retooling. While the government has attempted to provide these \nservices directly, these attempts have not always proved successful. The PA notes the need to \nprovide access for SMEs to technical and managerial skills through private sector providers \nsuch as training institutions and business consultants. It further notes the need to strengthen \nSME access to the financial sector. \n \nB.  The Project \n \n10.  The Small and Medium Enterprise Export Development Project (SMEEDP) will serve the \nneeds of a subgroup of SMEs\uf8e7the export SMEs.  It will do so through two channels.  First, it \nwill provide sustainable long-term financing for upgrading, expansion, and permanent working \ncapital and by promoting access to financial and business services. Subloans may be made to \nSMEs as well as to trading houses with close ties to SMEs. Lending to SMEs through trading \nhouses  will  enable  access  to  SMEs  with  the  potential  for  growth  but  which  have  not  yet \nachieved the design and quality required by the international market, the ability to deal with \nexport  procedures,  or  the  ability  to  communicate  with  foreign  buyers;  still  require  liquidity \nsupport; and may not be able to fully assume the risk associated with expansion.  As trading \nhouses are clustered in sectors with the greatest linkages to the poor such as garments and \nhandicrafts, this further extends the scope of the loan to SMEs with the greatest labor absorbing \npotential. \n \n ", "  Appendix 8  47 \n \n \n11.  The employment impact of the loan is expected to be large. SMEEDP-funded expansion \nwill necessitate increased labor inputs in the form of direct employment and through increased \ndemand for raw or intermediate inputs provided by individuals or microenterprises. For example, \nwhere the availability of kiln-dried wood is a limitation, investment in a kiln dryer will allow a \nfurniture  manufacturer  to  accept  more  orders.  The  manufacturer  would  hire  additional \npermanent workers for finishing, while production of parts, such as chair and table legs, would \nbe done by smaller suppliers using the manufacturer-provided kiln-dried wood. While there are \nalso some employment impacts related to the physical implementation of the expansion such as \nin construction, the employment impacts referred to here are sustainable for the life of the \ninvestment. Moreover additional employment will be generated as SMEEDP funds are repaid \nand re-lent (second-round effects). \n \n12.  The first round impact of investment is estimated to be between 1 million and 2 million \njob years.  One case study of cold storage in the fish processing industry in South Sulawesi \nindicated  substantial  demand  for  SMEEDP  loan  products  for  upgrading  and  expansion \nsuggesting that for each $500,000 invested, 500 new full-time jobs years are created requiring \nthe inputs from 10,000 fisherfolk-years.  A separate review of a Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau \n(KfW) credit line for clean technologies in SMEs shows that a $50,000 investment in a plastics \nchipping factory generated 100 additional jobs-years and required 800 scavengers-years to \nprovide sufficient recyclable waste material to meet the needs of the new investment. These are \nthe high-and low-case scenarios for employment impact. The initial pipeline of investments \nproposed for the SMEEDP suggests an employment impact of 1.5 million job-years.8 \n \n13.  The SMEEDP provides long-term employment prospects for unskilled and semiskilled \nworkers vital to absorb the 2.5 million entrants to the labor market each year and provides \nprospects for more productive work for a large segment of the labor force including the 10% \nseeking work and better opportunities and the 60% of the workers currently engaged in the in \nthe informal sector. It is not possible to calculate the percentage of poor that would benefit from \nthe additional employment or the percentage by which the incidence of poverty would be \nreduced because of the SMEEDP. With respect to the former, a worker is poor if he or she is a \nmember  of  a  poor  household.  The  SMEEDP  will  not  require  a  household  income  and \nexpenditure survey for new employees at entry.  It is likely that the majority of the new jobs and \nnew opportunities will accrue to individuals who would otherwise be vulnerable to poverty by \nvirtue of their low level of education. The incidence of poverty is affected by many factors \nbeyond the scope of the SMEEDP, including changes in the price of major staple foods.  \nNonetheless, the majority of these workers expecting to find productive work in the SME sector \nunder the program will be drawn from among the poor or near poor and would otherwise \ncontinue to compete in the already overcrowded and less well remunerated informal sector.  \n \n \n                                                 \n8   Based on $35 million of total project investment creating additional 47,000 job-years at the borrowing SMEs plus \n705,000 job-years in subcontractors and supplies (i.e., additional job-years for each SME job-year created).  \n ", "48  Appendix 8 \n \n \n14.

This is particularly important, as 60% of \nthe prime age labor force (footnote 3) have had only 6 years of education or less. In addition to providing \nnecessary quality work opportunities for Indonesia\u2019s burgeoning labor force, SMEs promote employment \ncreation by drawing on goods and services from the sectors where the poor are concentrated. \n       \nB.

Overview \n \n1.  The first-round economic benefits of an $85-million investment in new machinery and equipment by exporters could be classified \nas those generating additional employment, exports (sales in foreign currency). Assumptions include: \n(i)  Total project cost to be entirely financed by subloans and sub-borrowers contributions (minimum 25% of subloan). \n(ii)  A 10-year life of capital investment. \n(iii)  Second and third generation subloans through repayments and re-lending (tranched disbursements over the first 3 years of the \nProject; while second- and even third-generation disbursements will occur depending on repayments and maturity profile).  \n(iv)  $1 of annual additional exports for every 20-25 cents increase in capital investment (based on pipeline submitted and interviews \nwith exporters). \n(v)  One direct job-year for every $1,000-1,500 of additional investment expenditures per year (based on pipeline submitted and \ninterviews with exporters). \n(vi)  Fifteen new supporting jobs-year for each direct job created in SME (based on case studies from social analysis). \n(vii)  Other benefits do not factor in improvements in better quality of products to be produced and exported, improvements in \nworkers\u2019 skills to operate cleaner and better machinery, and/or improvements in overall management of enterprises. \n \nTable A9.1: Overview of Additional Jobs and Exports of SMEEDP \n \nEstimated  Average  Additional \n  Additional  Additional Exports  \nInvestment (total project  Subcontractor/Supplier \nTime Frame  Direct jobs-year  (millions in US$) \ncost)  Jobs-year \nAssumptions  (1)  (2)/$1,500 capital  15 related jobs*(2)  (1)/$0.20  \nexpenditure a year \nTotal from 1st to 3rd Year  $110 million  47000  705000  $550 million a year \nTotal from 4th  to 7th Year  $60 million  80571  1208571  $300 million a year \nTotal from 8th  to 15th Year  $120 million  161143  2417143  $600 million a year \nCumulative TOTAL  $290 million  288714  4330714  $1.45 billion a year \n \n2.  Access to credit has proven to have a significant variable in the explanation of exports (Appendix 2 \u2013 Subsector Analysis). Bank \ncredit is one important source of financing investment expenditures in SME (another would be direct equity investments from overseas \nor domestic investors). Within Indonesia, the commercial bank system has outstanding investment credit in US$ of $8 billion as of June \n2002. If 25% of this credit goes to investment in SMEs, ADB assistance through SMEEDP would account for about 6-14% of investment \ncredit.  Higher capital investment has proven to be a significant export determinant in exports. Moreover, its impact is much greater for \nSMEs than for the corporate sector, because of the SME low initial productivity of their labor force.  With proper complementary \nmachinery, greater labor productivity gains (and wages) explain in part the recent success of SMEs in exports. More productive \nemployment stands to be more than 1 million jobs-year, which would absorb part of the new job seekers entering the manufacturing \nlabor market each year in Indonesia (about 250,000 a year).  Finally, in terms of exports, SMEEDP is expected to generate about $1.5 \nbillion over the different stages of the project. The benefit of such as increase is significant compared to the estimated total exports in \nthe subsector ($3.6 billion in 2001). \n ", "50  Appendix 9 \n \n \n \nTable A9.2: Indicative Pipeline of Subprojects \n(as of 30 September 2002) \n \nEstimated Estimated Loan Annual Sales Annual Export Additional  Additional  Networks with Debt Equity Debt Service  Financial Overall\nIndustry Province Project Cost $ Size $ Revenues $ Revenues  $ Exports $ Employment Micro & SMEs Ratio (DER) Ratio (DSR) IRR Prospect\nWood processing industry South Kalimantan 2,368,000 600,000 3,022,000 2,414,000 800,000 29 Subcontractors 0.22 2.33 100.0% High\nPlastic industry Jakarta 383,000 268,000 1,289,000 644,000 100,000 47 n/a 0.51 1.68 27.4% High\nHandicraft producer Bali 16,700 11,000 50,000 16,700 6,000 9 Subcontractors 2.87 1.98 100.0% Medium\nWood processing industry North Sumatra 222,000 189,000 234,500 234,500 60,000 32 Subcontractors 1.60 1.44 72.4% High\nFurniture facory Central Java 1,283,000 600,000 5,000,000 4,995,000 2,400,000 173 Subcontractors 1.62 1.44 16.3% Medium\nFish processing industry North Sumatra 222,222 188,000 1,023,000 324,000 150,000 21 Fishermen 0.21 2.28 56.7% High\nTextile industry West Java 560,000 445,000 605,000 200,000 50,000 34 n/a 0.66 0.17 58.2% Medium\nFurniture producer West Java 275,000 220,000 510,000 25,000 100,000 10 Subcontractors 0.10 1.67 81.1% High\nGarment industry West Java 550,000 440,000 780,000 400,000 80,000 43 n/a 0.08 1.92 46.6% Medium\nFish processing North Sulawesi 296,000 240,000 533,000 110,000 30,000 108 n/a 0.13 2,47 39.2% High\nSub-total Bank Rakyat Indonesia 6,175,922 3,201,000 13,046,500 9,363,200 3,776,000 506\nWood process./furniture ind.

The exporters are all interested to become small and medium exporters\u2019 investment facility (SEIF) sub-\nborrowers in their respective banks. Complete project proposals for SEIF subloans from these and other SME exporters will be \nappraised in accordance with agreed upon subloan regulations for the SEIF by the participating banks and the technical assistnce \nmonitoring unit (TAMU), when the Government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have signed a loan agreement for the SEIF.  \n \n2.  Assumptions in calculating the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) are based on the following assumptions: \n \n(i).  The economic life of each subproject is 6 years due to the fact that most capital investments are for machinery, \nequipment, and vehicles,  \n(ii).  Investments will be completed during the first year; i.e., construction works and installation of machinery and equipment \nincluding trial runs, \n(iii).  Several  SME  investments  are  small  compared  with  the  earning  capacity  of  the  SMEs  that  submitted  the  project \nproposals. This has lead to high FIRR for these project proposals.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Government of Indonesia, through its Ministry of Environment (MOE), is unable to \nmonitor and control   pollution and waste caused by the large number of small and mediun \nenterprises  (SMEs)  in  Indonesia.  MOE  issues  environmental  regulations  and  determines  the \nenvironmental parameter values for various types of pollutants and industrial waste.  Government \nemployees assigned to MOE and the district administration units (Bapedalda) are charged with \nmonitoring all types of business enterprises, including SMEs to see that they comply with the \nenvironmental regulations. Government control of pollution caused by small enterprises is very \nweak. Medium-sized enterprises are more frequently controlled, but there is little real pressure from \nthe Government staff to force SMEs to comply with the environmental regulations and parameters \n(chemical oxygen demand and biochemical oxygen demand limits). The main pressure forcing SMEs to \nreduce pollution and waste comes from neighbors and customers of the SMEs.  Many SME \nexporters  have  undertaken  environmentally  friendly  investments  based  on  demand  and \nrecommendations from their foreign customers. \n \n2.  The development challenge for Indonesia is to help SMEs improve their environmental \nperformance  by  reducing  pollution,  conserving  resources,  and  providing  a  healthy  working \nenvironment to enable SMEs to meet environmental management standards for maintaining and/or \npromoting their exports. Overall, the Project will have a beneficial environmental impact through \nthe  replacement  of  obsolete  technology  by  new,  cleaner,  and  more  environment-friendly \ntechnology. Not only will cleaner production practices reduce environmental problems but they can \nhelp boost access to international markets by small Indonesian exporters who do not always meet \ninternational quality standards.  \n \n3.  Under the proposed Project, the Government and BEI will ensure that all subprojects \ncomply  with  the  applicable  government  environmental  standards,  requirements,  and  ADB's \npolicies, and that appropriate safeguards and mechanisms for compliance are built into each \nsubproject, as necessary. While environmental screening of all proposed investments is necessary, \nthe initial environmental examination or environmental impact assessment will be carried out when \nwarranted. \n \nB.  Description of Project and Environment \n \n4.  Three main types of environmental investments can be undertaken by SMEs under the \nsmall and medium exporters\u2019 investment facility (SEIF): \n \n(i)  investments in production facilities aiming at substantial pollution reduction and/or \nnatural  resource  savings  by  financing  of  more  efficient  and  cleaner  production \nequipment/process technologies;  \n(ii)  investments in machinery and equipment to be used by the SME to recycle, reuse, \nand recover (3 R) waste materials and waste products; and \n(iii)  investment  in  waste  treatment  plants  and  equipment  to  reduce  and  neutralize \nindustrial waste and pollution after the production process (end-of-pipe solutions).     \n \n5.  Bank Ekspor Indonesia (BEI) and the other commercial banks that participate in the SEIF \nwill make use of available technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nKreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (KfW),  and  other  agencies  during  the  subproject  implementation \nperiod to pay attention to the following development issues (paras. 6-9), and potential impacts and \nmitigation strategies (paras. 10-11). \n ", "  Appendix 10  55 \n \n  1.  Environmental Standards: A Long-Term Need of SME Exporters \n \n6.  Export restrictions for environmental protection are not included under the trade provision in \ninternational trading. However, requiring imports to meet the national environment and health \nsafety  is  clearly  permitted  under  the  current  multilateral  trade  rules.  Therefore,  under  these \ncircumstances,  it  is  very  likely  that  emerging  environmental  labeling  programs  will  affect \nIndonesia\u2019s exports to the countries where the public environmental awareness has reflected on \nthe  consumer  environmental  preference.  The  adoption  of  International  Organization  for \nStandardization (ISO) 14001 on Environmental Management System in 1996 can facilitate parity \nand mutual recognition among ISO members including Indonesia. The certification procedure for \neither ISO 14001 or another ecolabeling scheme requires the assessment of the whole life cycle of \nproducts. For example, in wood products (e.g., pulp and paper, furniture), sound management of \nthe sources of the wood has become an important factor for certification. Similarly, for other \nproducts such as garments, sound production processes of raw materials have also turned out to \nbe one of the important factors for granting an ecolabel. Therefore, without improving SMEs\u2019 \nproduction  processes,  SME  exporters  will  have  difficulties  in  expanding  or  maintaining  their \nmarkets. At present, only 35 of 600 furniture exporters that belong to the Association of Furniture \nand Handicraft Producers have received the chain of custody certificate required by buyers of \nfurniture and wood products from European countries and the United States.  \n \n  2.  Adoption of Cleaner Production by SMEs: Need for Government Action \n \n7.  As large industries struggle to survive the economic crisis, SMEs continue to play an \nimportant role in the country's economy. Increasing production of SMEs in manufacturing may \nresult in significant environmental costs. Although the problems have been regularly reported in \nlocal newspapers, there is no systematic monitoring ofn environmental problems, and of the health \nand safety of SME activities. The Ministry of Industry and Trade (MOlT) reports that pollution \nassociated  with  SME  activities,  particularly  in  the  manufacturing  sector,  has  created  serious \nenvironmental problems. In Klaten, Central Java, where SME activities involving electroplating are \nconcentrated, groundwater is no longer fit for domestic consumption due to its high level of \nchemical contamination. In Sidoardjo, East Java, MOlT reports that workers in SMEs and the \npopulation  near  the  SMEs'  areas  of  activities  are  beginning  to  suffer  from  serious  skin  and \nrespiratory problems caused by industrial pollution. \n \n8.  The  Government\u2019s  current  policies  to  address  environmental  management  concerns \nassociated with industrial activity have not been designed in favor of SMEs\u2019 activities. For example, \nin dealing with pollution, the current policy focuses on end-of-pipe treatment based on a set of \neffluent standards. The industries are required to treat their wastes before discharging them into \nthe environment. However, waste treatment should not be the end, but only the beginning of \nanother process outside production. For instance, wastewater treatment to meet effluent standards \nmay generate harmful sludge that needs to be burned or buried and that as a result causes soil \ncontamination or air pollution. In addition, waste treatment through individual or common treatment \nfacilities requires significant financial resources. Therefore, the current end-of-pipe treatment policy \nis not practical for SMEs in reducing pollution. \n \n9.  In finding a win-win solution to deal with environmental problems, including pollution from \nSMEs\u2019  activities,  cleaner  production  (CP)  is  a  more  promising  approach,  supported  by  the \ninvestment  facility  under  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Export  Development  Project \n(SMEEDP). In general, the adoption of CP involves improving housekeeping, substituting harmful \nchemicals used in the process with less harmful or biodegradable substances, and modifying the \nprocess for effective use of raw materials and reducing byproducts including waste. Therefore, the \n ", "56  Appendix 10 \nadoption of CP in SMEs\u2019 activities will help them to increase their productivity, at the same time \nreducing environmental problems associated with their activities and providing a hygienic working \nenvironment. The adoption of CP practices is not new in Indonesia; however, only few SMEs have \nadopted CP practices that have proven compatible with their needs. It can directly identify where \nintervention is necessary to improve SMEs\u2019 productivity and avoid environmental problems.  \n \nC.  Potential Environment Impacts and Mitigation \n \n  1.  Additional External Assistance for SMEs and Environment: CP Financing \n \n10.  The  SEIF  could  cooperate  with  additional  external  financing  for  cleaner  production \ntechnologies. The German Government, through KfW, is considering a second environmental \ncredit program (IEPC) for Indonesian SMEs. KfW may provide a grant to finance a TA unit for this \ncredit program to work closely with the proposed Technical Assistance Monitoring Unit (TAMU). \nThe soft loan will be channeled as rupiah-denominated subloans to SMEs by selected participating \nbanks. It is proposed to KfW that BEI and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) implement this credit \nprogram in line with tasks and responsibilities of each party similar to what is envisaged under the \nproposed SMEEDP.  An eligible SME could apply for subloans from both the SEIF under the \nSMEEDP and KfW\u2019s IEPC.   \n \n  2.  Institutional Monitoring: TAMU and Other External Assistance \n \n11.  ADB has TAs focused on improving SME productivity, such as the ongoing TA for Business \nDevelopment  Services  (TA-3829),  and  which  will  coordinate  with  TAMU  under  the  proposed \nSMEEDP (see terms of reference for TAMU in Appendix 4). It is expected that the implementation \nof the TA on CP by ADB will also assist the Government in addressing environmental problems \nassociated with SME development through CP strategy and practices.1 The latter TA will develop \nmodels on the adoption of CP practices for selected types of SMEs products; disseminate the \ntested models among relevant SME associations, and develop links with other information and \ntraining centers; and improve SMEs' access to environmental certification agencies. Also, it is \nexpected that the environmental TA by ADB will support efforts by other international agencies, \nworking to improve standards of SME production. These include (i) Swisscontact for improving \nelectroplating techniques in SMEs; (ii) Japan International Cooperation Agency, for improving the \ndesign and quality of SME products, particularly wood, rattan, brick, tofu, and fermented soybean; \n(iii) Government of Italy, for improving quality and design of leather, rubber, and plastic products; \n(iv) Government of Norway, for handling wastewater from leather production; and (v) World Bank \nthrough its Western Java and Jakarta Environmental Management Program, for handling wastes \nfrom textile and batik productions, and training to introduce CP.  \n \nD.  Findings and Recommendations  \n \n12.  Part of the negative impact comes from the activity of SMEs in the electroplating and \ncasting industries, which are highly polluting, as their wastes are categorized as hazardous and \ntoxic. The implementation of CP techniques (e.g., improving housekeeping, and recycling and \nreusing chemicals) in electroplating and casting will help to demonstrate waste reduction, and \nbenefits to other SMEs in adopting CP. However, based on the analysis of the sector (Appendix 8), \nexports from industries with extensive use of electroplating and with many SMEs are not the norm. \nMetal exports with high SME presence are copper and tin products, and silver, gold and jewelry. In \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to Indonesia for Improving the Environmental Performance of Small and Medium \nEnterprises by Promoting Cleaner Production. Manila.  \n ", "  Appendix 10  57 \n2000, both activities represented 3.4% of all Indonesian exports, but only a fraction of them came \nfrom SMEs (Table 1, Appendix 8). Therefore, few of these are SME exporters that may be \nprospective applicants to the SEIF under the proposed SMEEDP. Prospective SEIF subprojects \nneed to pay attention to their potential environmental impact and concerns. \n \n1.  Potential Environmental Impact of Subprojects \n \n13.  A closer examination of the potential investments in subprojects in Appendix 7 (Indicative \nPipeline) shows that there are no SMEs exporting metal products (or products with substantial \nelectroplating content). Most subprojects involve investments in newer and cleaner technologies \navailable for fish processing (such as cold storage units) and furniture making (such as wood \ndriers). For example, one SME in the crispy fish chip industry produces about 6 TM/month and \nemploys four workers, the adoption of CP, together with new equipment, as proposed under the \ncredit, would increase a total saving of about $1500 with an additional investment in CP techniques \nof about $1000. This saving would result from improving the cutting and steaming process as well \nas reducing wasted raw materials.  The benefits of using a newer cutter and steamer would be \nmuch larger. Another example comes from export-oriented batik garments. One SME produces \n130,000 pieces per year and employs 30 daily workers; the adoption of CP techniques through \nimproving of its housekeeping, particularly in washing and dyeing processes, would result in \nsavings of about $8,000 per year due to reduced water and chemical consumption as well as fewer \nrejected products. Investment in new washers and driers will reinforce these benefits. \n \n14.  Despite these good examples, there is a whole range of environmental issues that need to \nbe observed and addressed during the operational period after the investments are completed. \nSome  of  the  issues  are  linked  to  cleaner  production,  i.e.  water  and  energy  savings,  better \nhousekeeping, effective use of raw materials with less waste, substitution of harmful chemicals with \nless harmful or biodegradeable substances, etc. Other issues are related to reuse, recycling, and \nrecovery  of  waste  products  and  chemicals  used  in  the  production  process  and  finally  waste \ntreatment in waste treatment plants, incinerators and dumpsites. SME owners need to be trained \nand  informed  on  environmental  management  and  production.  TAMU  will  cooperate  with \nenvironmental experts and environmental agencies to promote environmentally friendly production \nprocesses  and  compliance  by  the  SME  sub-borrowers  with  environmental  regulations  and \nproduction standards.   \n \n2.  Potential Environmental Concerns of Construction and Location \n \n15.  Construction work tend to disturb the environment when the SME sites are in the middle of \nother  types  of  buildings  and  human  activities.  as  is  often  the  case  in  Indonesia.  Planned \nconstruction work is relatively \u201clight\u201d for most of the SMEs that were contacted during the survey. \nThere is very little if no need to use explosives or other dangerous work procedures during site \npreparation and construction work for the planned buildings and infrastructure facilities. Use of \nheavy construction equipment is also very limited for most of the planned investments. \n \n16.  Most SEIF subloans will be granted to existing SMEs, which plan to expand their production \ncapacity.  Such SMEs are located on suitable or less suitable sites, and the enterprises are not \nplanning to relocate their production and business operations.  Poor or insufficient infrastructure \n(road conditions, water and electricity supply) is a common problem faced by SMEs in Indonesia.  \nRapid urban development combined with poor town planning has caused big problems for many \nSMEs, which started their operations several years ago on sites \u201cfar\u201d from other buildings in open \nland. During relative short periods their locations have changed and they become \u201cmiddle of the \ntown locations\u201d close to housing estates, schools, and marketplaces.  Banks and SME owners are \naware of the poor infrastructure and urban development problems, but they can do very little on \n ", "58  Appendix 10 \ntheir own to solve these problems. The SMEs will gradually be forced to undertake environmental \ninvestments forced upon them by the environment with municipal authorities as their partners. \nSeveral of the SMEs surveyed are located in industrial estates equipped with wastewater treatment \nplants. The estate operator has contracted firms that collect the solid waste from each of the \ntenants regularly. \n \nE.  Conclusions \n \n17.  Negative pollution impact of subprojects under the SMEEDP is unlikely, given the size of \nsubprojects and the type of industrial activities. A positive impact of the subprojects should be \nemphasized, since the SMEEDP encourages the adoption of CP technologies. The Project will \nalso benefit from external assistance to foster the use of CP. The proposed SMEEDP would have, \nat  worst,  a  neutral  net  impact  upon  the  environment.  Based  on  this  initial  examination,  it  is \nrecommended to adopt Category B for the above project. \n \n18.  Under  the  SMEEDP,  TAMU  will  ensure  that  all  subprojects  observe  ADB\u2019s  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s  necessary  environmental  safeguards.  It  will  also  require  close  monitoring  of \nsubprojects in high-risk industries (electroplating and tanneries) or areas. The monitoring will be \ndone on a case-by-case basis. TAMU will discuss the environmental issues with management staff \nof BEI and the participating banks (PBs) and issue recommendations regarding environmental \nmatters that need to be observed by the lenders and the sub-borrowers in cooperation with \nenvironmental experts and MoE staff. TAMU, in coordination with other external assistance, will \npromote CP.  \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20021129150832Z", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 4.0 for Windows", "ModDate": "D:20040305100042+08'00'", "Title": "Small and Medium Enterprise Export Development Project - Indonesia", "Author": "ADB"}}
