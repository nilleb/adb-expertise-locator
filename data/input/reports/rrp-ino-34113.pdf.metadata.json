Environmental implications of the proposed Project were \nreviewed  at  appraisal.  The  subprojects  to  be  financed  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  will  be  required \nto  satisfy  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental guidelines.  \n \nThe  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Export  Development  Project \n(SMEEDP)  comprises  a  part  of  the  Government  and  ADB  efforts  to \npromote  development  of  small  and  medium  enterprises  (SMEs)  in \nIndonesia  and  is  a  follow  up  to  the  earlier  approved  Industrial \nCompetitiveness  and  SME  Development  Program  (Loan  1738-INO, \napproved  in  March  2000),  which  focuses  on  regulatory  framework \nand  policies,  and  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  development  of \nbusiness  development  services  (TA  3829-INO,  approved  in  January \n2002).  The  SMEEDP  focuses  on  the  issue  of  SME  financing, \nspecifically that for small and medium exporters and their network of \nsuppliers,  and  will  consist  of  (i)  a  loan  of  $85  million  to  provide \ninvestment  credit,  and  (ii)  TA  of  $500,000.  To  complement  the \nthe  Japan \nproposed  TA, \nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA), will finance, on a grant and \nparallel basis, technical assistance to support development of SMEs. \nThe  proposed  TA  and  the  Japan's  SME  promotion  program  will  be \nimplemented  in  close  coordination  with  technical  assistance  to  the \nSME sector being provided by other development partners. \n \nThe  1997-1998  crisis  pushed  a  large  number  of  people  below  the \npoverty  line.  During  the  process  of  economic  recovery,  SMEs, \nespecially  export-oriented \nresilience; \nbenefited \nthe  rupiah;  and  provided \nfrom \nsubstantial  job  opportunities,  contributing  to  poverty  reduction.  Yet  it \nwas  clearly  recognized  that  Indonesia  had  failed  to  fully  take \nadvantage  of  the  SME  sector  because  of  a  number  of  impediments. \nRecognizing  the  importance  of  SMEs  for  Indonesia\u2019s  economic \nrecovery  and  future  growth,  and  for  poverty  reduction  through \nemployment  creation,  the  Government  considered  development  of \nSMEs  among  the  country\u2019s  most  important  economic  initiatives, \nespecially  in  its  strategy  for  poverty  reduction.  Accordingly,  the \nPoverty  Partnership  Agreement  between  the  Government  and  ADB \nalso  noted  SME  development  as  a  key  area  for  ADB\u2019s  future \nassistance in Indonesia.  \n \nKey  impediments  to  the  development  of  SMEs  include  (i) regulatory \nframework biased against SMEs; (ii) the lack of sustainable business \ndevelopment  services  for  SMEs;  and  (iii)  difficulty  of  SMEs  to  obtain \nfinancing,  particularly  for  meeting  investment  requirements.  Through \n\nfirms,  offered  particular \n\nthe  depreciation  of \n\nRationale \n\nthrough \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nObjectives \n\nCost Estimates \n\nADB\u2019s  earlier  assistance,  the  issues  of  regulatory  framework  and \nbusiness development services are being addressed; however, there \nhave  been  no  effective  initiatives  to  address  the  issue  of  SME \nfinancing. \n \nOne  of  the  major  lessons  from  the  crisis  is  that  firms  should  secure \nfunds  to  meet  their  investment  needs  in  the  same  currency  as  their \nrevenue  stream.  Export-oriented  SMEs  would  be  naturally  hedged \nagainst  foreign  exchange  risks.  At  the  same  time,  given  the  current \nmarket  conditions,  SMEs  are  having  difficulty  in  obtaining  financing. \nIndonesian  banks  often  look  only  at  collateral  and  offer  only  short-\nterm  funds.  The  introduction  of  foreign  exchange  term  financing  for \ninvestment  purposes  with  TA  for  improving  the  communication \nbetween banks and SMEs will help to channel needed funds to SMEs \nfor high quality projects. \n \nThe  SMEEDP  will  support  economic  growth  and  assist  in  reducing \npoverty  through  job  creation  and  promotion  of  labor-intensive \nexports.  As  part  of  a  larger  assistance  strategy,  the  Project  aims  at \nsupporting  the  SME  export  sector  directly  via  investment  capital,  a \nniche  market  within  the  entire  SME  sector  lending.  Indirectly,  the \nProject  will  improve  the  appraisal  capacity  of  banks  to  undertake \ninvestment  lending  as  well  as  the  exporters'  capacity  to  apply  for \nbank  credit  with  sound  financial  advisory  services.  The  Project \npresents  integrated  support  to  export-oriented  SMEs  nationwide, \nwith priority to be given to subprojects from selected provinces with \nexport  potential  such  as  East  and  Central  Java  (part  of  ADB\u2019s \ngeographical  focus),  Sulawesi  (part  of  the  East  ASEAN  Growth \nArea), and Bali. Components are as follows: \n \n(i)  Small and Medium Exporters\u2019 Investment Facility (SEIF) for small \nexporters \nfor  capacity \nexpansion  and  modernization;  these  investment  funds  will  be \nchanneled  to  public  and  private  banks  through  Bank  Ekspor \nIndonesia  (BEI),  which  will  manage  the  banks'  risks,  while  the \nthe  exporters\u2019  risk \nparticipating  banks  (PBs)  will  manage \nthe \n(exporters  will  assume \nsubloans); and \n\nforeign  exchange  risk  of \n\nrequirements \n\ninvestment \n\nto  meet \n\nthe \n\n \n(ii)  TA  grant  of  $500,000  to  strengthen  credit  and  project  appraisal \ncapacity  for  all  PBs  through  technical  administration  unit, \nincluding training for bankers on SME credit scoring, basic trade \nfinance  instruments,  as  well  as  financial  advisory  services  for \nSME exporters to have access to the SEIF. \n\n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $113  million  equivalent. \nOf the total cost, $85 million or 75% is the foreign exchange cost and \n$28 million or 25% is the local currency cost.

In  parallel  to  this  TA,  the \nGovernment of Japan will finance an SME promotion program to \ncomplement the proposed TA, totaling $5 million. \n\n  \nThe  loan  amount  will  be  $85  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources. The Borrower will be the Republic of Indonesia. The loan \ncurrency, interest modality, and repayment schedule are stated in the \nloan  agreement  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  its  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)  based  loan  product.  The  standard \ncommitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum  applies  on  undisbursed \namounts according to the following estimated disbursement schedule: \n$15 million, first year; $30 million, second year; and $40 million, third \nyear. A front-end fee will be payable in an amount equivalent to 1% of \nthe amount of the loan, and will be capitalized in the loan. \n \nThe Borrower will relend the loan proceeds of $85 million to BEI, the \nsole  implementing  bank.  The  relending  terms  and  conditions  will  be \nidentical  to  those  of  the  ADB  loan  to  the  Borrower  except  that  the \nBorrower  will  charge  banks  50  basis  points.  BEI  will  manage  the \nparticipating banks\u2019 (PBs) risk and charge an administration fee to all \nPBs.  The  PBs  will  manage  the  commercial  risk  of  exporters  and \ncharge onlending interest rates to the final sub-borrowers (the SMEs) \nat  market  rates.  TAMU  will  support  the  bank\u2019s  credit  assessment  of \nSME  subloans  if  necessary.  For  individual  small  and  medium \nexporters,  the  maximum  subloan  size  financed  by  ADB  will  be \n$600,000  with  a \nlimit  of  $450,000.  For  exporters  with \ndemonstrated  business  networks  of  more  than  20  SMEs,  the \nmaximum subloan size financed by ADB will be $1 million with a free \nlimit  of  $750,000.    Under  either  type  of  free  limit,  the  first  three \nsubloans  made  by  each  PB  will  be  subject  to  the  approval  of  ADB. \nSubloans  exceeding  the  free  limit  will  continue  requiring  prior  ADB \napproval.

The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical \nassistance (TA) for Small and Medium Enterprise Export Development, and if the Board approves \nthe proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis: SME Exports \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nIn  the  recovery  of  the  Indonesian  economy  after  the  Asian  economic  crisis  in  1997-1998, \nsmall  and  medium  enterprises  (SMEs)  displayed  particular  resilience.  Because  of  SMEs\u2019 \nemployment-generating  capacity,  the  Government  and  ADB  have  recognized  the  importance  of \nsupporting  their  development  as  an  effective  poverty  reduction  strategy.  This  is  reflected  in  the \nPoverty Reduction Partnership Agreement signed in 2001. Also, the Government has prepared a \nMid-Term  Action  Plan  (MTAP)  for  SMEs1  announced  by  President  Megawati  in  April  2002.  The \nplan  highlights  the  role  of  SMEs  to  broaden  the  economic  base  and  to  accelerate  much-needed \nstructural reforms. \n \n3. \nIn Indonesia, SMEs weathered the crisis well and grew at a faster pace than the rest of the \neconomy, as a number of them turned to exports due to the favorable exchange rate (Appendix 2). \nSME  exports  grew  by  3.6%  in  1998  and  5.8%  in  1999.  In  contrast,  exports  by  large  exporters \ndeclined by 0.8% in 1998 and by 7.5% in 1999.2  While the recovery has been faster among SMEs, \nit could have been higher if the constraints inhibiting their development had been addressed. Small \nfirms (those with fewer than 100 workers) had higher export growth than larger firms between 1996 \nand 2000, and their share of total exports doubled. However, their contribution to exports continues \nto be modest  (2.8% in 1996 and up to 4.1% in 2000). For countries in need of higher economic \ngrowth, focus on SME exports could provide the highest returns in terms of growth given the low, \nbut rapidly expanding, market shares of these firms.3 \n \n4. \nWhile direct SME export growth has been achieved substantially by finding niche markets \nand  adapting  costs  and  quality  to  market  demand,  a  significant  part  of  SME  exports  simply  go \nunrecorded because they occur indirectly through subcontracting arrangements with larger firms or \ntraders. In the case of food exports, for instance, smallholders and fishermen who grow food crops \nor collect seafood and fish depend on the processing and exporting capacity of larger firms. This \nexplains in part why the Indonesian data indicate that SMEs export about less than 10% of all non-\noil  and  gas  exports,  a  percentage  below  the  estimates  for  Singapore,  Japan,  and  Philippines,  its \n\n                                                 \n1   Mid-Term Action Plan \u2013 Small and Medium Enterprise, 2002-2004.

The industrial structure in Indonesia has been dominated by large enterprises in terms \nof  value  added,  while  small  firms  play  a  key  role  as  the  locus  of  most  employment.  In \nmanufacturing  alone,  of  10.2  million  people  employed,  nearly  60%  are  employed \nin \nmicroenterprises and SMEs.  \n \n6. \nGrowth potential depends on enterprise size and the constraints faced. Small firms tend not \nto  grow  into  productive  medium  firms  (what  is  also  known  as  \u201cthe  missing  middle\u201d).  The \nphenomenon illustrates the structural constraints that have characterized Indonesian economy for \ndecades (Appendix 2). \n \n7. \nThese constraints include (i) a poor policy environment to conduct private business, which \ndisproportionally penalizes SMEs because it is relatively more expensive for SMEs to deal with a \nmyriad of overlapping and sometimes contradicting regulations; (ii) the lack of adequate business \ndevelopment services (BDS) for SMEs in an environment where the Government\uf8e7and external aid \nagencies\uf8e7have  provided  services  at  low  cost  without  substantial  outreach  or  sustainability;  and \n(iii) the  lack  of  financial  and  physical  infrastructure  to  support  SMEs  with  access  to  markets  with \nreliable  production,  and  even  exports.    Assistance  has  aimed  at  reducing  and  eliminating  these \nconstraints  through  a  series  of  step-by-step,  well-integrated  interventions  by  ADB  and  other \nagencies,  such  as  ADB\u2019s  Industrial  Competitiveness  and  SME  Development  (ICSMED)  Program \nand  the  associated  technical  assistance  (TA),5  which  supported  the  Government  to  prepare  the \ncomprehensive MTAP for SMEs. \n \n \n \n8. \nReducing  or  eliminating  the  regulatory  burden  on  SMEs  is  one  of  the  greatest  spurs  to \nentrepreneurship. Problems stem from regulatory systems developed in the image of large firms, \nrewarding  economies  of  scale  and  stability  rather  than  flexibility,  and  the  cumulative  pressure  of \nregulatory  requirements  for  SMEs.  Small  firms  have  reduced  capacity  to  absorb  unproductive \nexpenditures because they have less capital as well as fewer managerial resources. SMEs identify \nhigh  compliance  costs,  extensive  and  complicated  paperwork,  and  economic  regulations  that \nprohibit certain activities as the most onerous constraints they face.  \n \n9. \nfor \nentrepreneurs, especially small entrepreneurs. In particular, ADB TA supported the Government\u2019s \nreview  and  revision  of  several  business-related  regulations,  the  set-up  of  the  competition  bureau \n\nConstraints in Policy and Regulatory Frameworks \n\nthe  Government  has  created  better  conditions \n\nICSMED  Program, \n\nUnder \n\nthe \n\na. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n4    Harvie, C. and B.

Under a new and ongoing TA,6 ADB has continued to \nsupport this policy reform by moving its focus from policy planning at the center to implementation \nof specific pilot projects at the local level. For instance, local one-stop shops in Central Java and \nSouth  Sulawesi  will  allow  SMEs  to  acquire  information  about  regulations  and  carry  out \nadministrative formalities in one office only. Also, local and national regulations that discourage the \ncreation  and  expansion  of  smaller  enterprises  will  continue  to  be  reviewed  and  discussed.  The \nexisting requirements to start or expand an enterprise\u2014the time, cost, complexity, and registration \nrequirements\u2014are  especially  burdensome  for  SMEs  and  need  to  be  minimized  or  eliminated \ncompletely. These developments are part of the ICSMED Program\u2019s spirit of reducing bureaucracy, \nminimizing administrative burdens, streamlining procedures, and reducing compliance costs for all \nenterprises. \n \n \n \n10. \nSchemes to support managerial capacity of SMEs will be unsuccessful in the absence of a \nvibrant  entrepreneurial  sector,  consisting  of  those  who  sense  opportunities  and  take  risks  in  the \nface  of  uncertainty  and  develop  new  goods  and  services  using  available  resources.  The \nentrepreneurial process remains complex and influenced by social, cultural, and political factors. \n \nLack  of  markets  for  BDS\uf8e7defined  broadly  as  short-term  services  to  improve  business \n11. \nmanagement\uf8e7constrains SME performance in developing countries. In some cases, government \n(and  external)  intervention  has  prevented  the  development  of  sustainable  markets  for  these \nservices through the traditional approach of heavy and direct intervention to subsidize and provide \na  direct  supply  of  services  to  SMEs.  The  result  of  the  traditional  approach  was  poor  quality \nservices,  irrelevant  to  SMEs  and  with  very  limited  outreach.  The  market  for  BDS  providers  is \ngrowing as the supply of professionals rises and as SMEs acknowledge the usefulness of external \nand timely advice in a number of areas related to their business growth. \n \n12. \nBDS comprise a number of short-term services that help small entrepreneurs upgrade their \nproductivity by improving workplace organization, handling inventories, improving product design, \nusing  bank  credit,  etc.  Similar  to  the  case  of  high  regulatory  costs,  it  is  onerous  for  SMEs  to \nassume  the  costs  of  all  these  productivity-enhancing  processes  by  themselves,  because  each  of \nthem involves some high first-time, entry, or learning cost. For financial management techniques, \nsome  SMEs  do  not  even  apply  for  credit,  because  they  know  they  cannot  fulfill  the  entry \nrequirements into a banking relationship. Proper use of BDS could help SMEs initiate or upgrade \ntheir  financial  inputs  from  banks  whether  through  general  financial  advice  on  using  simple  bank \naccounts to high-quality business plans for long-term loans. For advanced production techniques, \nthe  cost  of  learning  or  transfer  of  these  processes  may  be  lessened  through  the  use  of  BDS  or \nthrough subcontracting for larger firms (vertical learning) or through clustering among other SMEs \n(horizontal learning or learning from peers). In fact, subcontracting7 appears to have made learning \nmore accessible for SMEs in Japan and Republic of Korea, where SMEs have been successfully \nintegrated into their export-oriented manufacturing sectors. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n6   ADB. 2002.

The Asia Foundation. \n\n\f 4 \n\n \n\nc. \n\nConstraints in Access to Financial Markets \n\n \n \n13.  Most  SMEs  lack  access  to  formal  financial  markets,  mainly  standard  bank  lending.  High \ncollateral  requirements,  complex  and  time-consuming  credit  application  procedures,  small  size  of \ncredit,  and  general  distrust  towards  outsiders  are  some  of  the  factors  that  explain  why  SMEs  do \nnot  tend  to  use  bank  loans  and  prefer  other\u2014sometimes  even  more  expensive\u2014sources  of \nfinancing.  The  Asia  Foundation  and  ADB  found  that  only  about  one  fifth  of  all  Indonesian  SMEs \ntend to have loans from banks.8  If the crisis affected some SMEs through increased interest rates \nand reduced profits, they tended to be a minority, according to a recent World Bank report.9 In fact, \nthe  low  reliance  on  bank  loans  by  the  majority  of  Indonesian  SMEs  gave  them  an  additional \nadvantage.  However,  chronic  low  exposure  to  credit  constrains  the  long-run  growth  potential  of \nSMEs, which would have grown faster in an unconstrained credit environment.  \n \nThe  same  World  Bank  report  estimates  that  the  prospects  of  SME  lending  by  Indonesian \n14. \nbanks  appear  to  be  good,  with  growth  rates  of  25%  for  2002-2003.  However,  these  growth \nprospects may pose challenges to banks that look to implement such aggressive growth strategies. \nIndonesian state-owned and private banks have to face the challenge of increasing their lending by \nlooking for new smaller clients (and loans), a departure from the precrisis days of cozy corporate \nrelationships.  Today  Indonesian  banks  need  to  reconsider  their  product  mix,  credit  and  pricing \npolicies, marketing, human resource mix, branch networks, and management information systems \nto  reach  out  to  SME  clients.  Despite  the  initial  signs  of  recovery  in  the  banking  system,  a  new \nequilibrium  in  the  market  of  credit  suppliers  and  credit  users  has  yet  to  be  reached,  despite  the \napparent liquidity from banks and increased credit needs of SMEs. Greater and easier access to \nfinance is vital to the prospects for any export-led economic recovery, but banks may not be able to \nsupport  recovery,  given  their  own  set  of  binding  constraints.  Many  banks  are  still  suffering  from \nnonperforming loans (NPLs), and restructuring has reduced their capacity to bear the credit risks of \nnew lending, especially SME lending, given the need to maintain prudential norms.  \n \nOne  of  the  reasons  why  growth  prospects  appear  so  high  is  that  Indonesian  commercial \n15. \nbanks  had  only  a  small  portion  of  their  portfolio  in  SME  lending  (Appendix  3,  Table  2).  Although \nBank  Indonesia  (BI)  estimates  by  loan  size  show  that  almost  one  quarter  of  all  bank  loans  are \n\u201cSME\u201d  loans,  banking  analysts  estimate  that  the  proportion  of  actual  lending  to  SMEs  must  be \nmuch  lower  (perhaps  10-15%)  because  of  multiple  small  loans  by  corporate  borrowers  or  a \nmultitude  of  small  consumer  loans.  After  the  crisis,  a  more  balance  clientele  is  emerging,  and \nrestructured  banks  are  determined  to  adopt  new  business  plans  to  attract  SME  clients.  For \ninstance,  the  large  state-owned  banks  such  as  Bank  Negara  Indonesia  (BNI),  Mandiri,  and  Bank \nRakyat Indonesia (BRI) can reach SMEs across Indonesia through their extensive branch networks \n(almost 2,000 branches among these four banks). Their business strategies note the need to shift \nfrom their traditional customer base to SMEs, whether by scaling up or down their target clientele. \nSo, for instance, on the one hand, BRI has traditionally lent to a large number of microenterprises \nin  rural  areas,  and  is  currently  boosting  its  retail  banking  to  attract  larger  SME  clients  (it  has \nopened nine SME centers).  On the other hand, BNI and Mandiri, which have traditionally lent to \nmore corporate clients, now have plans to focus on smaller accounts through better cost-effective \noperational techniques such as credit scoring. Other smaller banks such as Bank Danamon, Bank \n\n                                                 \n8   GFA-Swisscontact.  2001.  Best  Practice  in  Promoting  Market-based  Lending.

With  almost  85%  of  banks\u2019  assets  still  in  the  hands  of  the  Government, \nprivatization  (or  reprivatization)  of  banks  in  the  next  few  years  is  expected  to  improve  their \nefficiency  and  commercial  orientation,  and,  hence  their  ability  and  incentives  for  SME  lending.  In \nthe meantime, all major banks are making or expected to adopt soon changes in their operations \nby  opening  more  business  centers  to  cater  SME  clients,  streamlining  their  procedures  further  to \nreduce  the  costs  of  assessing  small  loans,  and  adopting  risk  management  guidelines  to  improve \nportfolio quality, among other operational changes (Appendix 3, Tables 3 and 4). These changes in \nthe banking sector are aimed at meeting the needs of a more sophisticated clientele of SME credit \nusers as they improve their own financial management capacity (paras. 10-12). \n \n\n2. \n\nRationale for the Project \n\nto \n\nthe  key \n\nidentified \n\nimpediments \n\nThe  MTAP  has \n\n \nThe  SME  sector  in  Indonesia  is  probably  one  of  the  most  heterogeneous  in  Asia.  No \n16. \ncomprehensive  approach  could  deal  with  the  constraints  faced  by  all  SMEs.  A  multifaceted  and \ngradual  approach  to  Indonesian  SMEs  will  be  most  effective  in  a  rapidly  changing  environment. \nThe Project has to be placed in the context of the Government\u2019s efforts to revive and develop the \nSME sector since the crisis, and within ADB support in the area.  \n \n17. \nthe  development  of  SMEs: \n(i) inappropriate regulatory framework under which equal conditions did not exist for SMEs vis-\u00e0-vis \nlarger  companies,  (ii)  unavailability  of  private  sector-led  and  sustainable  BDS  for  SMEs,  and \n(iii) difficulty for SMEs to obtain financing. Through ADB\u2019s and other agencies\u2019 earlier assistance, \nthe issues of regulatory framework and BDS are being addressed; however, there have been no \neffective  initiatives  to  address  the  issue  of  SME  commercial  financing,  one  of  the  key  actions \nproposed in the MTAP. \n \n18. \nAccess  to  finance  for  private  enterprises  (and  SMEs)  was  drastically  reduced  during  the \ncrisis, and the mobilization of financial funds continues to be challenging until today. In particular, \nlong-term  funds  in  foreign  exchange  available  for  investment  have  decreased  within  the  banking \nsystem  after  the  crisis  and  have  not  yet  recovered  (Appendix  3,  Figure  1).  Available  funds  are \npriced  at  comparatively  high  rates  due  to  country  risk  perceptions.  The  proposed  project  will \ncomplement  temporarily  a  banking  system  that,  currently,  cannot  provide  sufficient  long-term \nfunding  for  SME  exporters  who  have  expressed  strong  demand  for  the  credit.  Bank  Ekspor \nIndonesia\u2019s  (BEI),  an  apex  institution  with  a  clean  commercial  record,  provides  an  administrative \nand TA focal point for banks\u2019 lending to SMEs, and for SME exporters in the process of improving \ntheir access to formal bank financing (Appendix 3, Table 5). \n \n19.  While a well-defined credit line will improve the supply of funds in the system, it cannot be \nexpected  on  its  own  to  solve  the  sluggish  intermediation  of  financial  funds  in  Indonesia.  Other \ncomplementary  improvements  in  the  financial  sector  are  needed  at  various  levels.  First,  further \ndeepening in financial sector reforms by the Government will strengthen the banking sector,10 while \naid  agencies  have  continued  to  provide  selective  financial  policy  advice  to  the  Government \n(Ministry  of  Finance  [MOF]  and  BI)  and  state-owned  banks  through  targeted  advisors.  Also, \nspecific policy actions are required to improve intermediation of funds to SMEs. Some of them are \nfound  under  the  assurances  of  the  proposed  project  such  as  an  adequate  implementation  of  the \nSME  debt  restructuring  decree;  further  progress  in  MTAP  implementation;  and  further  discussion \n\n                                                 \n10  ADB.  1998.

A  specific  policy \ninitiative towards the use of credit information, contemplated as part of the ongoing TA and MTAP, \nwill produce the first blueprint of a credit information bureau11 in Indonesia, which will help improve \nlong-term access to all types of credit, especially for SMEs, as it facilitates borrower assessments \nby banks. Finally, commercial banks themselves need to improve their own financial intermediation \nroles. A change in the strategic goal of further SME lending needs to be matched by a change in \noperational strategies and banking culture. Also, the credit line needs to be complemented with the \nextensive  number  of  externally-funded  projects  on  BDS  to  be  coordinated  under  this  Project,  not \nonly to ensure utilization of the credit line for sound SME investments, but to support the need for \nbetter  mobilization  of  investment  financing  from  banks  to  businesses.  In  the  near  future,  other \ntypes  of  SME  financing  will  also  be  necessary.  Access  to  domestic  and  international  capital \nmarkets, nonexistent or underutilized by SMEs today, will need to be supported as alternatives to \nbank funding, and as part of a financial graduation policy. \n \n\na. \n\nGovernment\u2019s Strategy \n\nThe  Medium-Term  Development  Strategy  (PROPENAS) \n\n \nfor  2001-200512  aims  at \n20. \nstrengthening  the  foundations  of  the  economy  for  sustained  economic  growth,  national  cohesion, \nand  social  stability;  achieving  good  governance  and  the  rule  of  law;  strengthening  regional \nautonomy; and developing social programs. These goals represent a change in paradigm from a \ncentralized  power  under  the  New  Order  regime  to  \u201cthe  empowerment  of  people\u2019s  economy.\u201d  To \nadvance  this  change,  a  recovery  program  stated  that  the  \u201cgovernment  intervention  is  to  be \nminimized  to  give  wider  opportunity  and  freedom  to  the  cooperative  movement  and  SMEs  to \ndevelop autonomous business activities.\u201d13  \n \n21. \nThe  Government  has  embarked  on  the  reform  of  its  industrial  policy  to  accelerate  SME \ndevelopment and increase the competitiveness of Indonesian industry supported by the ICSMED. \nAmong  other  ongoing  economic  reforms,  the  Government  has  streamlined  existing  subsidized \nlines  of  credit  for  SMEs  and  announced  a  competitive  investment  policy  to  be  reflected  in  a  new \ninvestment  law.  To  develop  further  industrial  and  SME  reforms,  the  Government  created  two \ninterministerial  task  forces  during  the  Program  (the  SME  Task  Force  and  the  Deregulation  and \nCompetition  Task  Force).  First,  the  SME  Task  Force  (soon  to  be  institutionalized)  helped  in \naccelerating  SME  policy  reform.  It  assessed  (i)  the  institutional  framework  needed  for  SME \npromotion;  (ii)  the  provision  of  commercially  based  credit  to  SMEs;  and  (iii)  the  provision  of \nsustainable  supporting  business  services  for  SME  trading,  marketing,  and  exports.  The \nassessment  provided  the  Government  with  recommendations  for  improvements  in  SME  policy, \nwhich  were  also  reflected  in  the  finalization  of  the  MTAP,  announced  in  April  2002.  Also,  the \nDeregulation and Competition Task Force reviewed and suggested the modification of policies that \naffect  industrial  development  and  investment  negatively  in  the  country.  The  Task  Force,  with \nsupport from ADB, prepared an Indonesia Regulatory Review Manual for training of officials within \nthe Central Government in identifying, reviewing, and revising business regulations. Under the new \nTA,  the  practice  will  soon  be  extended  to  local  government  officials  in  2003  and  2004  in  several \ndistricts. \n\n                                                 \n11  The blueprint is part of the ADB. 2002.

The  strategy  for  SMEs  has  generally  been  to  ease  the  scarcity  of \nterm  finance  by  providing  funds  and  improving  the  banking  system\u2019s  ability  to  lend  to  them.  In \n1996, the World Bank undertook for the first time a detailed empirical analysis of its SME support in \nthree  countries  over  a  period  of  more  than  20  years.14  The  study  concludes  that  the  expected \noutcomes  of  credit  lines  for  term  financing  were  not  always  achieved,  and  provides  three  key \nlessons for future operations: First, support for SMEs can create more jobs, but it could fall below \nexpectations. In the Philippines, support for SMEs was considered to be effective in creating jobs, \nand  less  so  in  reducing  poverty,  boosting  Philippine  exports,  or  shifting  the  location  of \nindustries\uf8e7the  originally  stated  objectives.  In  Sri  Lanka,  too,  SMEs  were  a  good  vehicle  for \ncreating jobs, especially important in an economy undergoing restructuring. The results were less \nimpressive  for  Ecuador.  Second,  banks  needed  to  learn  more  about  SMEs.  Starting  with  more \nflexible  financial  products,  such  as  basic  short-term  credit,  one  way  to  start  to  reduce  the  risk \nperception of SME clients is by using building blocks toward a more complex banking relationship \nbefore  using  long-term  loans.  Direct  support  to  SMEs  in  Sri  Lanka  did  go  a  long  way  toward \nimproving  the  prudential  soundness  of  the  banking  system,  and  NPLs  among  SMEs  were  below \nthe  market  average.  Finally,  the  report  concludes  that  good  institutions  cannot  overcome  a  weak \npolicy environment. By providing deeply subsidized credit to borrowers (such as in Ecuador), rather \nthan access to credit, the credit lines merely substituted government transfers for borrower finance. \nReforming the financial sector or relying on a sustainable microfinance institution would have been \na better way to provide support for small entrepreneurs unable to get credit.   \n \n23. \nADB\u2019s  direct  involvement  in  financial  intermediation  with  similar  credit  lines  to  enterprises \nhas  been  through  the  two  development  finance  loans  (DFLs).  Between  1989  and  1993,  the  first \ndevelopment  finance  loan  (DFL)  (Loan  0981-INO)  in  an  amount  of  $200  million  was  almost  fully \nutilized ($194 million); it was followed by a second DFL (Loan 1223-INO) for $200 million in 1993. \nUnder DFL II, the Government re-lent the ADB loan in dollars to nine banks: directly to two state-\nowned  banks  and  through  the  central  bank  to  several  private  banks.  Subloans  were  onlent  in \ndollars  to  eligible  subprojects  for  financing  the  foreign  exchange  content  of  their  capital \nexpenditure, but the project faced low utilization, primarily because of high subloan interest rates \nunder the prevalent market conditions. Interest rates on the dollar-denominated subloans were not \ncompetitive  with  dollar  loans  available  from  multiple  sources  of  credit  before  the  crisis.  More \nimportantly,  the  extensive  due  diligence,  documentation,  and  reporting  requirements  without  any \nmonitoring  support  made  subloans  even  less  attractive  compared  with  cheaper  and  simpler \nrequirements under conventional commercial bank loans. ADB's interest rate under its dollar facility \nwas  generally  higher  than  alternative  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  funding \navailable to banks, and the two state-owned banks (Bank EXIM15 and BNI) decided to cancel their \nallocation shortly after loan effectiveness. With only private intermediaries, the loan agreement was \namended further. It reduced the cost of subloan processing by increasing the free limit amount for \neach subloan to $3 million from the original $1 million, giving banks more room to select, approve, \nand monitor subloans. But it was insufficient to stimulate utilization. Once the 1997 financial crisis \nbroke out, there was a further cancellation of funds of DFL II because the remaining private banks \nwere unable to find eligible sub-borrowers. The loan was closed in March 1999 with final utilization \n\n                                                 \n14  A summary of the findings was published under World Bank (WB). 1998.

Compared  with  international \nexperience, the SMEEDP can be expected to generate jobs and exports in a period of recovery in \nthe  economic  cycle.  The  SMEEDP  will  also  support  banks\u2019  current  efforts  to  get  into  bankable \noperations  with  creditworthy  SMEs,  as  most  exporting  clients  already  have  access  to  short-term \nbank credit. At the same time, the SMEEDP takes a radical departure from past subsidized pricing \nof  credit,  so  no  price  distortions  are  found  such  as  those  faced  by  SMEs  in  Latin  America. \nCompared  with  previous  operations  in  Indonesia,  a  key  lesson  for  the  SMEEDP  has  been  to \nensure  that  the  interest  cost  to  the  participating  bank  and  the  sublending  interest  rate  are \ncompetitive  with  alternative  funding  sources.  In  this  respect,  the  expected  availability  of  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility  for  investment  by  small  exporters  will  be  a  major  advantage \ncompared with DFL II, since long-term funds in foreign exchange are not readily available to banks \nat  competitive  cost  due  to  the  lingering  effects  of  the  crisis  and  recent  bank  restructuring.  Given \npresent economic and country risk conditions, there is now much reduced availability of credit lines \nto  Indonesian  banks  (Appendix  3,  Figure  1).  This  reduces  the  likely  source  of  competition  from \nalternative  funding  sources,  and  underlines  the  need  for  a  credit  facility  to  address  an  important \ntemporary constraint to ongoing SME export growth in need of foreign exchange for investment in \nthe  upgrading  of  plants  and  equipment  during  the  recovery.  Finally,  administration  requirements \nhave also been simplified from the start and centralized under one administrator (BEI) with TA to \nreduce the costs of a transparent and targeted intervention with emphasis on SME exporters, and \nwith a simplified disbursement procedure not available before.  \n \n\nc. \n\nADB\u2019s Strategy and Policy Dialogue \n\n \n25. \nSince 1998, ADB has played a lead role in SME policy development. In the formulation of \nthe ICSMED policy framework, ADB launched substantial economic and sector work (Appendix 4) \nand  promoted  aid  coordination  meetings  to  reach  agreement  on  the  SME  policy  agenda.  In  line \nwith the ADB strategy, substantial work was undertaken in 1998-2002 to develop understanding of \nthe issues and constraints facing the SME sector and to identify requirements for this sector. ADB \nstrategy  recognizes  that  support  for  SME  development  is  crucial  to  ensure  pro-poor,  pro-jobs, \nsustainable  recovery  and  that  assistance  is  needed  in  access  to  exports  and  domestic  markets, \nincreased  access  to  financial  services,  strengthening  linkages  to  the  large-scale  manufacturing \nsector,  and  improvement  of  investment  and  market  advisory  services.    Active  project  assistance \nand  appropriate  development  policies  are  required  to  encourage  growth  of  the  SME  sector, \nespecially in the regions. \n \n26. \nADB\u2019s support for SME development is substantive and has evolved systematically.  In the \nfirst  phase,  ADB\u2019s  SME  development  strategy  for  Indonesia  through  policy  dialogue  conducted \nunder  ICSMED  advocated  rationalization  and  streamlining  of  the  industrial  policy,  regulation,  and \ninstitutional  framework  to  improve  incentives  for  trade  and  industry.  Concurrently,  ADB\u2019s  support \nfor strengthening the financial system and its governance will provide a range of instruments and \nvolume of financing required for sustained industrial and SME development.  As a follow-up to this \nintensive policy dialogue and the progress attained in certain segments of the finance and industry \nsector,  ADB\u2019s  SME  development  strategy  is  to  focus,  in  a  second  phase,  on  a  comprehensive \nassistance  package  to  SMEs.  The  proposed  project  focuses  on  export-oriented  SMEs  to  provide \n\n                                                 \n16  ADB. 2002.

It  also  aims  at  rationalizing  assistance  to  SMEs  by \n(i) improving policy coordination and implementation, (ii) improving financial intermediation, and (iii) \ndeveloping  proposals  for  BDS  support.  The  program  loan  includes,  for  instance,  an  investment \npolicy  geared  towards  issues  of  industrial  competitiveness  rather  than  introducing  additional \nincentives  for  SMEs.  The  more  liberal  industrial  framework  will  further  SME  development  by \nreducing  the  excessive  costs  of  operating  in  a  monopolistic  environment.  The  investment  policy \nstatement has already been prepared and was announced by the Government in 2001 as one of \nthe core conditions for the disbursement of the incentive tranche of the Program Loan in February \n2002. A key release condition for the final tranche is the actual enactment of the investment law, \nand the Government has requested an extension on the Program Loan until 2003.  \n \n28. \nRationalization  of  SME  credit  schemes  has  been  another  core  condition  of  the  ICSMED \nprogram. The condition has been fully complied with by issuing a decree on SME credit schemes \nwith  a  gradual  phase-out  of  subsidized  credit  (June  2001).  Throughout  the  years,  many  credit \nprograms for small (and large) firms were heavily subsidized, which contributed to credit rationing, \nthat  is,  subsidized  credit  created  such  a  large  demand  for  low-priced  credit  that  it  had  to  be \nrationed, excluding viable SMEs. In this respect, subsidization of credit for small firms has become \nunsustainable,  and  the  Government  has  moved  towards  dismantling  the  complex  subsidized \nprograms of the past. Since 1999, BI has not been allowed to provide liquidity credit for subsidized \ncredit schemes. However, as a transitional measure, BI Law 23 requires that the credit schemes \nalready  committed  prior  to  the  Law  should  continue,  and  that  the  Government  should  pay  the \ninterest subsidy of these outstanding credit schemes until they expired. That is, the credit schemes \nfinanced  by  BI  will  eventually  be  automatically  abolished.  Today,  besides  the  interest  subsidy  for \nthe  outstanding  credit  programs  under  BI  liquidity  credit,  the  Government  supports  interest \nsubsidies  for  two  credit  programs  (consumer  and  housing  credit),  as  well  as  Kredit  Ketahanan \nProgram  (KKP),  a  consolidated  credit  line  from  five  previous  credit  schemes  for  agriculture  and \ncooperatives. \n \n\nd. \n\nRelevant External Assistance to the SME Sector \n\n \nAs Indonesia recovers from the crisis, bilateral and multilateral agencies have adjusted their \n29. \noperations  from  the  short-term  response  to  the  crisis  to  that  of  medium-term  development \n(Appendix 5).  \n \nJapan,  the  largest  bilateral  source  of  development  assistance  to  Indonesia,  has  provided \n30. \nsignificant financial and technical support to the SME sector in the country. In 1998, for instance, \nthe  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  provided  a  $1  billion  facility  to  Indonesia  to \nhelp support the country's export-led economic recovery. Specifically, the facility was provided for \nthe settlement of transactions based on the letters of credit (LCs) issued by Indonesian local banks \nto finance necessary imports for the Indonesian export sector. In December 2000, the facility was \nrevised  to  provide  working  capital  financing  ($300  million)  in  addition  to  LC  confirmation  services \n($700  million).  The  facility  is  fully  utilized  and  is  to  be  fully  repaid  by  BEI  in  June  2003.  On  the \ntechnical  support  for  SMEs,  the  Government  of  Japan,  through  JICA,  financed  a  detailed \nassessment of the SME sector in response to a November 1999 request from the Government of \nIndonesia.  The  assessment  was  completed  in  July  2000  and  was  used  for  the  formulation  of  an \nSME promotion program in Indonesia to be funded by the Government of Japan over the period of \n\n\f 10 \n\n2002-2006,  which  will  be  implemented  in  parallel  to  the  proposed  TA.  Japan  is  the  leader  of  the \nSME Donor Committee for the Consultative Group of Indonesia (CGI), in active coordination with \nADB, the World Bank and other bilateral agencies. \n \n31.  \nThe joint SME unit of the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) plans \nto become involved in SME policy advice (currently the World Bank provides advice on SME debt \nrestructuring  as  part  of  its  financial  policy  advisory  role),  improved  delivery  of  BDS,  and  capacity \nbuilding  within  provincial  banks  that  lend  to  SMEs.  In  2001,  IFC  activities  (including  its  SME \nsupport)  were  put  on  hold  but  were  reactivated  in  2002  after  Indonesian  courts  resolved \nsatisfactorily  cases  involving  IFC-funded  investments.  The  IFC  Private  Sector  Strategy  for \nIndonesia  plans  to  support  development  of  a  healthy  restructured  banking  sector  and  lending  for \nthe  development  of  a  competitive  private  sector  and  for  corporate  investment.  In  2001,  IFC \ninvested $5 million in equity in Bank NISP, a private small bank with SME clientele. In 2003, IFC \nplans to establish a private sector BDS facility headquartered in Bali. \n \n32. \nAfter  the  crisis,  bilateral  agencies  expanded  their  assistance  programs  for  SMEs  in  a \nnumber  of  specific  areas,  mainly  policy  advice.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment focused on supporting corporate and financial reforms including banking regulations \nmeant to improve SME lending. Australian assistance has been directed to Eastern Indonesia and \nadvisory  support  for  strengthening  of  government  audit,  monitoring  of  state-owned  banks, \nbankruptcy  and  commercial  law,  foreign  investment,  and  trade  policies,  including  support  for \ncapacity  building  for  government  officials  in  preparation  of  compliance  with  World  Trade \nOrganization  (WTO)  procedures.  The  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit \n(GTZ)  has  focused  on  SME  promotion  and  vocational  training,  while  the  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr \nWiederaufbau (KfW) successfully supported two investment credit lines in local currency for SMEs \nuntil  2001  and  plans  to  continue  a  second  phase  of  its  credit  line  for  investments  in  cleaner \nproduction  in  2003.  Finally,  a  number  of  other  international  and  bilateral  agencies  work  in \nIndonesia  on  SME  policy  reform  and  nonfinancial  services  for  SMEs  in  different  geographical \nareas,  such  as  the  Canadian  Development  Agency  (especially  in  North  and  South  Sulawesi), \nSwissContact  (East  Java),  and  the  Asia  Foundation  (Bali  and  West  Java).  They  work  in  close \ncooperation and coordination with the SME Donor Committee, led by Japan. \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nObjectives \n\n \nA. \n \n33. \nThe Project will aim at promoting economic growth and sustainable employment generation \nthrough  the  strengthening  of  the  SME  export  sector,  which  will  directly  contribute  to  reduce \npoverty. In pursuit of this goal, the SMEEDP will facilitate the development and promotion of SME \nexports by helping to increase value added, diversifying SME businesses, and fostering backward \nand forward linkages nationwide through term loans to SME exporters. \n \nB. \n \n34. \nThe Project will provide comprehensive support for SME export development through term \ncredit  for  expansion  supported  by  business  services  to  access  credit  and  export  markets.  The \nSMEEDP  will  provide  the  Small  and  Medium  Exporters\u2019  Investment  Facility  (SEIF).  This  will \ncomprise  a  credit  line,  through  public  and  private  banks,  that  will  on  lend  proceeds  to  directly \nfinance  the  foreign  exchange  components  of  capital  expenditures  for  SME  exporters,  and  to \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nSpecial Features of the SMEEDP \n\nindirectly finance their supporting industries.17  This will alleviate constraints in the postcrisis period, \nwhere  economic  activity  has  gained  momentum  but  banks,  despite  their  restructuring,  have  not \nbeen able to mobilize long-term foreign exchange funds for financing SME capital expenditures. \n \nC. \n \n35. \nThe Project links policy work to project financing. The assurances under the Project aim at \nreinforcing  the  progress  achieved  under  recent  policy  dialogue  and  TA.  First,  the  letter  of  intent \nissued  under  review  of  the  Extended  Financing  Facility  of  the  IMF  states  that  the  SME  debt \nrestructuring decree write-offs or restructuring measures will be left as commercial decisions rather \nthan  provide  for  mandated  haircuts.  Second,  progress  under  the  recently  announced  MTAP  for \nSMEs  will  improve  SME  policy  coordination  within  the  Government,  improve  local  government \ncapacity  to  review  and  revise  regulations,  propose  discussion  of  BI  regulations  affecting  SME \nlending  such  as  moveable  collateral  registries,  announce  the  steering  committee  for  a  credit \nbureau,  and  develop  a  forum  of  BDS  providers  to  discuss  the  new  government  orientation  on \nbusiness services provision. All these policy actions will contribute to support a long-term strategy \nof increasing access of SMEs to financial markets. \n \n36. \nThe  proposed  Project  acknowledges  business  networks  and  clusters,  common  forms  of \nproduction and trading in Indonesia. First, it incorporates an incentive to banks to allocate subloans \nto exporters such as trading houses that may constitute a network of SMEs. This form of lending \nbridges the difficulties of lending to individual and noncreditworthy SMEs with the ability to borrow \nby larger firms, which usually take only short-term loans. The subloan supports the efforts of some \ntrading  houses  to  enter  into  manufacturing  to  improve  the  quality  of  goods  to  be  exported  while \nindirectly supporting their own suppliers or subcontractors.  \n \nD. \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $113  million  equivalent.  This  comprises  a \n37. \nforeign exchange cost of $85 million and a local currency cost of $28 million equivalent, financed \nby sub-borrowers\u2019 equity and/or participating banks. The former will involve funding for $85 million \nto finance the SEIF. \n \nE. \n \n38. \nIt is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $85 million to the Republic of Indonesia from its \nordinary capital resources. The loan\u2019s foreign currency (dollars), interest modality and repayment \nare  stated  in  the  Loan  Agreement  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  Loan  Product.  A \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum applies. The commitment charge will commence 60 days \nafter  signing  the  loan  agreement  and  will  be  paid  semiannually  by  the  Government  against  the \nundisbursed portion of standard staggered amounts of the loan (15% for the first year, 45% for the \nsecond  year,  85%  for  the  third  year,  and  100%  thereafter).  In  addition,  a  front-end  fee  will  be \npayable  in  an  amount  equivalent  to  1%  of  the  amount  of  the  loan  and  will  be  capitalized  in  the \nloan.18 \n \n39. \nFor  the  SEIF,  the  Government  will  make  proceeds  of  the  loan  available  to  BEI,  BNI,  and \nBRI  through  three  subsidiary  loans  of  $50  million,  $20  million,  and  $15  million,  respectively,  that \n                                                 \n17  SME  exporters  include  direct  and  indirect  exporters  and  their  supporting  industries  that  have  sufficient  revenues  in \n\nCost Estimates  \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n18  ADB will have the right to withdraw such amount from the proceeds of the loan and pay itself such amounts as front-\n\nforeign exchange to repay subloans. \n\nend fee at loan effectiveness.  \n\n\f 12 \n\nwill  have  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  the  loan  from  ADB  to  the  Government,  in  relation  to \ninterest, front-end fee, and commitment charges, in addition to a fee of 50 basis points, according \nto government regulations. BEI will relend the proceeds of its subsidiary loan to eligible PBs based \non onlending agreements between BEI and each of its PBs. BRI and BNI will also act as PBs. The \nPBs will onlend the SEIF funds to eligible sub-borrowers as subloans. The subloans will finance up \nto 100% of the entire direct and indirect foreign exchange cost of a qualified subproject, but in no \ncase  more  than  75%  of  the  total  cost  of  such  project.  The  subloans  will  not  finance  the  cost  of \nacquisition  of  land  use  rights,  taxes,  duties,  and  wages.  Each  sub-borrower  will  provide  equity \nfinancing of not less than 25% of the total cost of its subproject, and PBs may provide counterpart \nfunds  to  finance  the  local  currency  cost  requirements.  PBs  will  be  encouraged  to  give  priority  to \nsubprojects outside Jakarta (provinces in the East ASEAN Growth Area and in ADB\u2019s geographical \nfocus areas, such as Central and East Java), but not excluding sub-borrowers with headquarters in \nJakarta. \n  \n40. \nBEI will relend these funds in foreign exchange to PBs, and these PBs will onlend the funds \nto  sub-borrowers  in  foreign  currency.  The  foreign  exchange  risks  will  be  borne  by  the  sub-\nborrowers  who  are  naturally  hedged  against  these  risks  because  their  export  revenues  are \ndenominated in foreign currency. The relending interest rates to be charged by BEI to its PBs will \nbe  LIBOR  plus  125  basis  points,  which  includes  a  loan  administration  fee.  Under  a  loan \nadministration agreement, BEI will also be charging a loan administration fee of 15 basis points to \nBRI and BNI for the Technical Assistance Monitoring Unit (TAMU) services BEI will be providing so \nthat the total cost of funds to BRI and BNI will be LIBOR plus 125 basis points.  BEI may further \ncharge an additional risk premium based on negotiations with PBs, other than BNI and BRI. Since \nBEI  will  not  be  undertaking  channeling  of  loan  proceeds  from  and  repayment  obligations  to  the \nGovernment  on  behalf  of  BNI  and  BRI,  BNI  and  BRI  will  not  be  charged  a  similar  additional  risk \npremium.  Other  than  the  BEI  risk  premium  charged  on  Danamon,  Bukopin,  Niaga,  Mandiri,  and \nother PBs, the cost of borrowing to sub-borrowers out of loan proceeds as between BRI and BNI \non the one hand and Danamon, Bukopin, Niaga, and Mandiri will be governed by risk perception of \nthe sub-borrower only. Subloan repayment schedules will be based on the cash-flow forecasts for \nthe subprojects. PBs will revolve the repaid subloans to make further advances to SMEs within the \noverall time frame of the Project. The last date for submission of subloan applications to ADB will \nbe 3 years after the date of loan effectiveness. The last date for disbursement under any subloan \nwill be 5 years from the date of effectiveness of the ADB loan to the Republic of Indonesia. Only \nexpenditures  incurred  for  a  subproject  not  earlier  than  180  days  prior  to  receipt  by  ADB  of \nwithdrawal  applications  will  be  eligible  for  financing  under  the  loan  after  the  loan  effectiveness \ndate. \n \nF. \n \n41. \nThe Directorate General of Financial Institutions MOF will be the Executing Agency. BEI will \nbe  the  implementing  and  loan  administration  agency  for  the  SEIF  to  be  available  through \nIndonesian state-owned and private banks to SME exporters. \n \n42. \nThe  SEIF  will  provide  long-term  foreign  currency  debt  funding  to  SME  exporters,  and \nindirectly  to  their  supporting  industries,  to  finance  capital  investment  loans,  excluding  land \npurchasing;  and  preinvestment/permanent  working  capital,  including  financing  for  essential \nimported inputs. The proposed loan will make available long-term funds across Indonesia to SME \nexporters who can prudently manage the foreign exchange risk.  \n \n43. \nThe selection of participating banks for the SEIF is based on the following criteria: (i) past \nand  projected  financial  condition  in  terms  of  solvency,  liquidity,  profitability,  portfolio  quality,  and \nefficiency  in  financial  intermediation;  (ii) past  and  projected  track  record  on  lending  to  SMEs;  (iii) \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n\f \n\n13\n\ncredit  appraisal  capabilities,  particularly  for  project  finance  to  SMEs;  (iv)  past  experience  in \nservicing  credit  lines  of  other  aid  agencies;  and  (v)  corporate  governance  practices.  During  the \ndisbursement period of the proposed Project, to qualify for disbursement under the loan, a PB must \ndemonstrate  compliance  with  the  following  applicable  prudential  regulations  and  guidelines  of  BI, \nas  amended  from  time  to  time,  and  any  other  requirements  of  ADB  through  quarterly  financial \nindicators to be monitored by TAMU: \n  \n\ncapital adequacy ratio not lower than 8%;  \n\n(i) \n(ii)  net open position of a maximum 20%;  \n(iii)  a loan to deposit ratio not higher than 100%;  \n(iv)   positive return on assets; \n(v)   NPLs should not exceed 5%;  \n(vi)   loan loss provisions; and  \n(vii)   legal lending limit, reflecting the maximum exposure to a single borrower or group of \n\nborrowers not exceeding 20% of capital resources.  \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\nProject Organization and Management \n\nSelection, Appraisal, and Approval of Subprojects \n\n \nAccording to these criteria, BNI, BRI, Bank Mandiri, Bank Niaga, Bank Danamon, and Bank \n44. \nBukopin  were  pre-selected  for  this  Project  as  of  September  2002  and  the  continued  compliance \nwith these criteria will be monitored through annual audited reports. Based on a thorough market \nassessment, the PBs have proposed a first-year credit line allocation of $13 million as follows: BNI \nwill  have  a  first-year  allocation  of  $3  million;  BRI,  $2.5  million;  Bank  Mandiri,  $2  million;  Bank \nNiaga, $2 million, Bank Danamon, $2 million; and Bank Bukopin, $1.5 million.  Allocations for the \nsubsequent  years  of  the  Project  will  be  based  on  first-come-first-served  basis  according  to \ndisbursement records. \n \n \n \n45. \nIn  addition  to  a  competent  credit  department,  the  Executing  Agency,  in  consultation  with \nBEI, will establish TAMU as a support unit. TAMU will be staffed with competent personnel, headed \nby  a  senior  BEI  official,  and  consultants.  TAMU  will  oversee  the  preparation,  appraisal,  and \nimplementation of all subprojects to be financed under the Project nationwide through the PBs. \n \n \n \n46. \nADB  will  finance  the  direct  and  indirect  foreign  exchange  costs  of  subprojects  with  a \nmaximum  ADB-funded  subloan  size  of  $600,000  for  individual  small  and  medium  exporters \n(subloan debtor); and/or subprojects with a maximum ADB-funded subloan size of $1,000,000 for \nexporters with a demonstrated business network, defined as follows: (i) a trader/manufacturer (the \nsubloan debtor) and a group of a minimum of 20 micro/SMEs (suppliers and/or subcontractors); (ii) \nboth parties (debtor and micro/SMEs) should have a letter of agreement that will state the benefits \nto  micro/SMEs  from  the  ADB  subloan  and  will  be  reviewed  by  TAMU.  Subloans  for  business \nnetworks are expected to benefit SME production performance with increased access to the use of \nmore  modern  machinery;  access \nfrom \ntraders/manufacturers; and, hence, increased production capacity or revenues from sales. All other \nconditions  for  the  SEIF  under  $600,000  will  apply  to  subloans  for  business  networks.  Subloans \nunder  the  SEIF  will  finance  fixed  investments  including  capital  goods,  and  technology  for  new \ninvestment  projects  or  for  modernization  of  existing  enterprises.  Initial  incremental  foreign \nexchange  working  capital  necessary  for  the  operationalization  of  fixed  investments  may  also  be \nfinanced from the ADB loan without exceeding 35% of the total subloan. \n  \n47. \nAll  PBs  will  follow  the  subloan  approval  form  and  appraisal  reports  for  potential  subloans \nprovided  by  TAMU  and  approved  by  ADB.  Following  internal  approval  by  the  PB,  a  subloan \n\nto  closer  marketing  and/or  production  services \n\n\f 14 \n\napplication  including  the  subloan  approval  form  and  appraisal  report  will  be  submitted  to  TAMU, \nwhich  will  forward  them  to  ADB.  ADB  will  approve  the  first  three  subloans  granted  by  each  PB \nbefore establishing (i) a free limit of $450,000 per subloan for single exporters, and (ii) a free limit \nof  $750,000  per  subloan  for  exporters  with  demonstrated  business  networks.  Thereafter,  for \nsubloans above the free limits, ADB will provide approval or requested revisions based on timely \nprior receipt of adequate and complete documentation processed by TAMU. For eligible subloans \nbelow the free limit, PBs will provide direct approval and report to TAMU. For loans below the free \nlimit, TAMU will notify ADB. \n \nThe  selection  of  subprojects  will  be  based  on  sound  banking,  commercial,  and  financial \n48. \ncriteria reflecting economic and financial viability. In particular, the following criteria for subproject \nselection  will  be  applied:  (i)  all  sub-borrowers  are  required  to  be  exporters  and,  hence,  to  earn \nadequate  revenues  in  foreign  exchange  to  repay  their  loans  on  schedule;  (ii)  at  least  25%  of  the \nsubproject cost should be financed by the sub-borrower as equity; (iii) the subproject should have a \nfinancial  internal  rate  of  return  not  less  than  12%;  (iv)  the  sub-borrower  should  maintain  a  debt \nservice coverage ratio of no less than 1.2 times within 3 years from the date of disbursement of the \nsubloan or when the subproject's production reaches full capacity, whichever is earlier; (v) the sub-\nborrower should maintain a positive cash flow after repayments of SEIF loan interest and principal \nduring the full subloan repayment period; and (vi) sub-borrowers should have adequate collateral \nin  accordance  with  each  PB  internal  credit  assessment  process  and  BI  regulations.    Also, \nsubprojects  will  have  to  meet  prevailing  labor  and  social  standards  and  regulations  in  Indonesia. \nFurther,  eligible  subprojects  will  have  to  comply  with  ADB's  and  the  Government's  procurement, \nenvironment, safety, and other social safeguard requirements, according to TAMU. \n \nThe sub-borrowers will manage the foreign currency risks of a subloan, while the PBs will \n49. \nmanage the credit risks of the sub-borrowers. BEI will manage bank risks. It is expected that, on \naverage, 150 subloans will result in additional investment and employment in 150 direct individual \nexporters  over  the  life  of  the  Project  and  indirectly  in  up  to  3,000  SMEs  via  subcontracting \narrangements. The PBs have already submitted a potential pipeline that will translate into an actual \npipeline worth $13 million for the first year, while the balance of $72 million will be allocated on a \nfirst-come-first-served-basis in the following 2 years. \n \n \n \n50. \nADB's Guidelines for Procurement applicable to subloans to PBs will be followed with the \nassistance of BEI and the TAMU. These guidelines may require sub-borrowers to (i) demonstrate \nthat the procurement procedures adopted are appropriate in the circumstances; (ii) ensure that the \ngoods and services to be financed by subloans are purchased at a reasonable price, account also \nbeing taken of other relevant factors such as time of delivery; efficiency and reliability of the goods; \ntheir suitability for the subproject; availability of maintenance facilities and spare parts; and, in the \ncase of services, the quality and the competence of the parties rendering them; and (iii) ensure that \nall  goods  and  services  financed  under  the  subloans  are  procured  from  ADB  member  countries. \nSub-borrowers will be encouraged to adopt international competitive bidding procedures where the \namount  is  unusually  large,  and  it  will  be  in  the  interest  of  economy  and  efficiency  to  follow  such \nprocedures or international shopping ones. \n \n \n \n51.  MOF and BEI will jointly request establishment of an imprest account (special account). The \nceiling  of  the  special  account  will  be  set  at  $7.5  million.  The  initial  advance  and  subsequent \nreplenishments  to  the  special  account  will  be  based  on  planned  disbursements  for  the  six \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nProcurement \n\n4. \n\n3. \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nsuccessive months of the Project. The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (Appendix 6). \n \n\n5. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \nBEI and the PBs will have their accounts and financial statements (balance sheets, income \n52. \nstatements,  and  statements  of  sources  and  application  of  funds)  audited  annually  in  accordance \nwith sound and standard auditing standards by independent external auditors acceptable to BI and \nADB.  BEI and the PBs will submit to ADB not later than 6 months after the close of each financial \nyear  their  audited  financial  statements  and  annual  reports.19  BEI,  through  TAMU,  will  submit  to \nADB  all  reports  that  ADB  may  reasonably  request  concerning  the  loan  and  its  utilization;  the \nsubloans; other matters relating to the purposes of the Project; and the quarterly progress reports, \nin a format to be agreed upon with ADB, within 60 days after the end of the relevant quarter with \nassistance of TAMU; and a project completion report within 3 months of the project closing date. \n \n53. \nBEI  and  the  PBs  will  inform  and  give  ADB  an  opportunity  to  comment  on  any  substantial \namendments to the banks\u2019 management, ownership, or legal constitution. If the amendments affect \nimplementation of the proposed Project, BEI and the PBs will conduct consultations with ADB prior \nto making any final changes in their operational policies. \n \n \n \n54. \nTAMU at BEI will monitor the financial and economic performance of subprojects, as well as \nevaluate  their  socioeconomic  and  environmental  benefits.  In  addition,  a  random  sample  of \nsubprojects could be selected for ongoing, long-term benefit monitoring and evaluation by TAMU in \ncoordination  with  ADB  staff.  Specific  data  collection  and  reporting  formats  will  be  developed  and \nimplemented  in  a  computerized  database.  Specific  areas  to  covered  include  (i)  financial  and \noperational performance of the subprojects; (ii) direct and indirect employment creation attributable \nto the subprojects (e.g., through supply of inputs); and (iii) business linkages with micro and SMEs, \nif applicable. \n \n \n\nMonitoring of Subprojects \n\n6. \n\nIV. \n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n55. \nThe proposed TA for this project is based on the findings and recommendations of TA 3416 \n(Promoting  Deregulation  and  Competition)  and  TA  3417  (SME  Development)20  and  aims  to \ncomplement the implementation of the proposed loan to Indonesia. \n \n56. \n \n\nThe scope of the TA (Appendix 7) will focus on \n\n(i) \n\nstrengthening  of  SME  exporters\u2019  capacity  to  meet  eligibility  criteria  and  submit \nbankable proposals;   \n\n(ii)   strengthening of project and credit appraisal and monitoring capacity for PBs; and  \n(iii)   coordinating external assistance to SME exporters. \n\n \n57. \nThe  TA  is  estimated  to  require  $620,000  equivalent,  consisting  of  $300,000  in  foreign \nexchange  cost  and  $320,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  cover  $300,000 \n                                                 \n19  In accordance with ADB's new policy, if there is a delay in submission of annual audited accounts beyond 6 months, a \n\nformal warning will be issued, and if there is a delay beyond 12 months, disbursements will be suspended.  \n\n20  See  footnote  5.  Both  TAs  accompanied  the  ongoing  Loan  1738-INO:  Industrial  Competitiveness  and  SME \n\nDevelopment Loan, for $200 million approved in March 2000 and extended until December 2002.  \n\n\f 16 \n\nequivalent, including all of the foreign exchange cost and $200,000 equivalent of the local currency \ncost,  to  be  financed  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program  on  or  about  approval  of  the  loan  until  about \nDecember 2004. The Government will finance the balance of the local currency cost in counterpart \nfunds.  The  TA  will  support  TAMU  at  BEI  in  Jakarta,  and  promote  SEIF  through  BDS  outside \nJakarta,  with  emphasis  on  Bali.  The  TA  will  also    be  complemented  by  ADB's  ongoing  TA  3829-\nINO in supporting BDS in four local governments in Central Java and South Sulawesi and ongoing \nTA  3837-INO  in  improving  environmental  performance  of  SMEs.21  In  parallel,  the  Government  of \nJapan, through JICA, will finance on a grant basis a SME promotion program between 2002-2006 \nfor  a  total  of  $5  million  equivalent.  JICA\u2019s  SME  program  includes  institutional  support  to  BEI, \nsupport  to  provincial  export  training  and  promotion  centers  in  East  Java,  North  Sumatra,  South \nSulawesi and South Kalimantan, and a study on SME clusters. The TA and JICA\u2019s SME promotion \nprogram will be implemented in close coordination with ongoing TA from other sources such as the \nWorld Bank and IFC (see Appendix 5). \n \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nImpact of Export-Oriented SME Development on Poverty \n\n \nA. \n \n58. \nAn ADB Poverty Assessment for Indonesia has identified SME growth as one of the main \nengines  for  pro-poor  growth  when  supported  by  well-functioning  competitive  markets.22  In  2001, \nADB  also  signed  a  Poverty  Partnership  Agreement  with  the  Government  to  reduce  the  level  of \nabsolute  poverty  by  half  by  2015,  putting  poverty  reduction  at  the  center  of  its  development \nstrategy  in  Indonesia.  While  the  largest  number  of  absolute  poor  live  on  Java,  the  percentage  of \nthe population below the poverty line is greater in the outer islands. Policy and project lending will \nhave a positive impact on poverty to the extent that it increases the incomes of workers and their \nfamilies. These increases in incomes from paid labor\u2014the main asset of the poor\u2014will help raise \nthem over the poverty line, and, hence, reduce their absolute number, as well as the percentage of \npeople under the poverty line. \n \n59. \nThe employment impact of the loan is expected to be large (Appendix 8).  SMEEDP-funded \nexpansion  will  necessitate  increased  labor  inputs  both  in  the  form  of  direct  employment  and \nthrough  increased  demand  for  raw  materials  or  intermediate  inputs  provided  by  individuals  or \nmicroenterprises. For example, where the availability of kiln-dried wood is a limitation, investment \nin  a  wood  kiln  dryer,  will  allow  a  furniture  manufacturer  to  accept  more  orders  and  create  an \nenlarged  market  for  the  supply  of  components  and  raw  materials.  While  there  are  also  some \nemployment  impacts  related  to  the  physical  implementation  of  the  expansion  such  as  in \nconstruction,  the  employment  impacts  referred  to  here  are  sustainable  for  the  life  of  the \ninvestment.  Moreover additional employment is generated as SMEEDP funds are repaid and re-\nlent. \n \n60. \nThe first round impact of the investment is estimated to be between 1 million and 2 million \njob-years  with  relatively  low  capital-labor  ratios  and  high  labor  productivity  compared  with  large \nenterprises. Increases in capital expenditures (hence, in exports) will translate into higher gains in \nemployment among SMEs than in larger firms. The initial pipeline of investments proposed for the \nSMEEDP suggests an employment impact of 1.5 million job-years for a total project investment of \n\n                                                 \n21  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Improving the Environmental Performance of Small \n\nand Medium Enterprises by Promoting Cleaner Production. Manila. \n\n22  ADB. 2002. Assessment of Poverty in Indonesia. Vol. 1 and 2.  \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nFinancial Analysis of Indicative Pipeline \n\nabout $110 million.23  One case study of the fish processing with cold storage equipment in South \nSulawesi  indicated  substantial  demand  for  SMEEDP  loan  products  for  upgrading  and  expansion, \nsuggesting that for each $500,000 invested, 500 new full time jobs-years are created, requiring the \ninputs from 10,000 fisherfolk-years.  A separate review of a KfW credit line for clean technologies \nin SMEs shows that a $50,000 investment in a plastics chipping factory generated 100 additional \njobs  years  and  required  800  person-years  to  provide  sufficient  recyclable  waste  material  to  meet \nthe needs of the new investment. \n \n61. \nFinally,  there  is  a  significant  potential  impact  on  poverty  by  subprojects  in  furniture-\nexporting  clusters  in  Jepara-Semarang  (Central  Java).  Most  exporters  interviewed  indicated  that \nthey would invest to double their exports. For example, between 1996 and 1999, average exports \nfrom  Jepara  increased  by  almost  $50  million  and  generated  7,518  additional  jobs.  Extrapolating \nfrom  this  experience,  a  doubling  of  exports    in  Jepara  with  support  of  the  SEIF  could  generate \naround 7,500 additional direct jobs, and more than 75,000 supporting jobs. All these are indicative \nof the high and low case scenarios for employment impact. \n \nB. \n \n62. \nThe analysis, based on about 60 potential specific SME subprojects identified by the PBs \nduring June-September 2002, demonstrates the strong demand for the SEIF (Appendix 9). As of \n30 September  2002,  the  PBs  had  provided  basic  information  on  62  SME  exporters,  who  are \npotential  SEIF  borrowers.  The  subprojects  have  a  range  of  financial  internal  rates  of  return  from \n15%  to  100%,  and  adequate  average  debt  service  ratios  of  1.9.  Sixty  percent  of  the  subprojects \nare in regions outside Java such as the islands of Sulawesi, Kalimantan, Sumatra, and Bali. Most \nindustries involve wood, fish, or handicraft products, which are consistent with the high presence of \nmicro  and  SMEs  in  these  industries.  The  indicative  pipeline  of  $28  million  supports  the  amounts \npre-allocated to the PBs during the first year and the overall loan utilization. \n \nC. \n \n63. \nThe  Project  will  have  a  beneficial  environmental  impact  through  the  replacement  of \nobsolete technology by new, cleaner, and more environment-friendly technology as supported by \nan  ongoing  TA  3837-INO  (Appendix  10).  Not  only  will  cleaner  production  practices  reduce \nenvironmental  problems  and  conserve  natural  resources  but  they  can  help  boost  access  to \ninternational markets by small Indonesian exporters who do not always meet international quality \nstandards.  Under  the  proposed  project,  the  Government  and  BEI  will  ensure  that  all  subprojects \ncomply with the applicable government environmental standards and requirements and with ADB's \npolicies,  and  that  appropriate  safeguards  and  mechanisms  for  compliance  are  built  into  each \nsubproject, as necessary. While environmental screening of all proposed investments is necessary, \nthe initial environmental examination or environmental impact assessment will be carried out when \nwarranted.  Every  subproject  will  conform  to  the  Environmental  Assessment  Procedures  and \nRequirements of the Government and ADB. \n \nD. \n \n64. \nThere are no foreign exchange risks in transactions for BEI or the PBs. In subloans under \nthe SEIF, exporters with the SEIF loans will be naturally protected against foreign exchange risks \nbecause of their foreign exchange earnings. \n\nExchange and Commercial Risks \n\nEnvironment \n\n                                                 \n23  Estimates are based on a $35 million investment with an additional 47,000 job-years in SME sub-borrowers, plus 15 \n\nsubcontractor job-years for each of these jobs (i.e., 705,000 job-years).  \n\n\f 18 \n\n \n(ii) \n \n\n \n\n \nUnder the SEIF, the financial risk of NPLs (due to bad credit decisions) will be mitigated by \n65. \nstrict  application  of  the  requirements  for  financial  soundness  of  the  sub-borrower  and  viability  of \ntheir  investments  through  business  advisory  services.  TAMU,  and  associated  TA  from  external \nsources,  will  support  the  ability  of  the  PBs  to  enhance  their  credit  appraisal  capacities  and  apply \ntheir  own  (and  ADB\u2019s)  criteria  for  subloan  processing  in  accordance  with  ADB's  standards.  The \nPBs\u2019 branch networks should give them access to local knowledge with respect to the performance \nand character of the applicants reducing default risks.  \n \nUnder the SEIF, borrowing SMEs will be sensitive to marketing risks, particularly in export \n66. \nmarkets.  Any  failure  in  marketing  would  reduce  their  financial  viability  and  ability  to  service  debt. \nThis  risk  is  mitigated  by  the  project  design,  which  focuses  on  products  in  which  Indonesia  has  a \nclear  comparative  advantage  such  as  labor-intensive  products  like  furniture  and  agroprocessing. \nSub-borrowers will be required to demonstrate their marketing strategies. \n \n \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government, BEI and the PBs have given the \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n67. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.   \n \n(i) \n \n\nMedium Term Action Plan \n\n(1)  \n\nCommencing one year after loan effectiveness, the Government will report annually \nin  writing  to  ADB  progress  on  the  implementation  of  the  April  2002  Medium  Term \nAction  Plan  for  SMEs  through  a  reporting  system  developed  under  ADB  technical \nassistance.  \n\nEligibility of BEI and PBs \n\n(2) \n\nExcept  as  ADB  may  otherwise  agree  in  order  to  ensure  that  BEI  and  the  PB \nconcerned  will  remain  eligible  for  access  to  loan  proceeds,  under  its  respective \nRelending  Agreement  or  Subsidiary  Loan  Agreement,  the  Government  will  cause \nBEI  and  each  such  PB  to  submit  to  ADB  an  opinion  through  their  annual  audited \nreports  in  form  and  substance  satisfactory  to  ADB,  from  an  independent  external \nauditor  whose  qualifications,  experience  and  terms  of  reference  are  acceptable  to \nADB to certify that: \n\na) \n\nb) \n\nthe  PB  concerned  meets,  exceeds  or  is  otherwise  in  compliance  with  all \napplicable  prudential  regulations  and  guidelines  of  Bank  Indonesia,  as \namended from time to time, including but not limited to (i) a net open position \n(NOP)  not  in  excess  of  20  percent;

and (ii) a positive Return to Assets ratio. \n\n(3)  \n\nExcept as ADB may otherwise agree in order to ensure that the PB concerned will \nremain  eligible  for  access  to  loan  proceeds,  under  its  respective  Relending \nAgreement  or  Subsidiary  Loan  Agreement,  the  Government  will  also  cause  each \nsuch  PB  to  submit  through  the  TAMU  an  annual  Letter  of  Representation  to  ADB \nproviding  ongoing  representations  and  warranties  from  the  PB  satisfactory  to  ADB \nthat the PB concerned will have, inter alia, certified to (i) past and projected financial \nconditions in terms  of solvency, liquidity, profitability, portfolio quality and efficiency \nin  financial  intermediation;  (ii)  past  and  projected  lending  to  SMEs;  (iii)  credit \nappraisal  capabilities  for  lending  to  SMEs;  and  (iv)  application  of  corporate \ngovernance standards and practices acceptable to Bank Indonesia.  \n\n \n (iii)  Criteria for Subprojects \n \n\n(4) \n\n \n(5) \n\n \n(6) \n\n \n\nThe  Government  and  BEI  will  cause  the  PBs  to  ensure  that  (i)  subloans  do  not \nexceed  75%  of  the  total  subproject  cost;  (ii)  subloans  do  not  finance  cost  of \nacquisition of land use rights, taxes, duties and wages; (iii) the subloan size from the \nconcerned  PB  to  a  SME  will  not  exceed  $600,000  for  individual  exporters  or \n$1,000,000  for  exporters  with  demonstrated  business  linkages  with  SMEs  as \ndefined  in  the  Loan  Agreement;

Companies manufacturing \nfor export, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs), have substantial growth potential.2  \nSME exports have grown over time but still represent a small fraction of the total (Figure A2.1). \nOn the supply side, the recent drop or stagnation of Indonesian exports was caused mostly by \n\u201ctraditional\u201d  factors,  such  as  (i) strengthening  of  the  rupiah  exchange  rate,  (ii)  instability  of \nsecurity  and  law  enforcement,  (iii) high  transaction  costs  due  to  corruption,  and  (iv)  frequent \nlabor activities demanding wage increases. On the demand side, the drop of the manufacturing \nsector occurred, among others in footwear, fish and shrimp, chemical products, spices, coffee, \ntea,  and  jewelry,  which  involve  mostly  SME  suppliers.  These  Indonesian  products  are  losing \nagainst  similar  competitive  products  from  emerging  economies  such  as  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina, India, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n\nFigure A2.1: Total and SME Non-oil and Gas Exports \n\n1993-2001 ($ million)\n\nTotal Non-Oil and Gas Exports \n\n$47,757 \n\n$41,821\n\n$40,975 \n\n$38,873\n\n$43,406 \n\n$34,954 \n\n$38,093 \n\n \n\n60,000.00 \n\n50,000.00 \n\n40,000.00 \n\n20,000.00 \n\n10,000.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n30,000.00 \n\n$27,077 \n\n$30,360 \n\nSmall Industry Exports\n\n$1,685 \n\n$2,214 \n\n$2,160 \n\n$2,503\n\n$2,522 \n\n$3,646\n\n$2,552 \n\n$3,049 \n\n$3,659 \n\n1993 \n\n1994 \n\n1995 \n\n1996\n\n1997\n\n1998\n\n1999\n\n2000 \n\n2001\n\nSource:  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Trade  (Small  Industry  Exports)    as  cited  by  Urata,  Shujiro  (2000,  Table  I-7).  \"Policy \nRecommendation  for  SME  Promotion  in  the  Republic  of  Indonesia,\u201d  July,  JICA,  1999-2001  are  estimates  from  same \nsource.

However, \ndifferences in the size classification prevent a clear distinction of sectors where SMEs are well \nestablished within a specific subsector or commodity. Table A2.1 summarizes SME presence in \nsome major industrial or manufactured products by indicating whether there is a \u201clow\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d \npotential  presence  of  SMEs,  according  to  many  sources.  For  example,  SME  exports  are \n\n                                                 \n3   Sixty percent of the sector exports was shrimp (37%), cocoa (9%), coffee (11%), and tuna (5%). \n4   Ninety five percent of the sector exports was cooper ore (53%) and coal (42%). \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n25\n\nexpected  to  be  concentrated  in  the  wood  products  and  textile,  garments,  and  footwear \nsubsectors.  Together,  some  authors  estimate  that  these  subsectors  are  responsible  for  some \n50%  of  SME  exports  from  Indonesia.  In  addition,  basic  machinery  contributes  another  16%  to \nSME exports.  Smallholders are important in growing food and cash crops, and there is potential \nfor  further  SME  involvement,  however,  much  of  the  processing  and  exporting  takes  place \nthrough  larger  firms.  Overall,  a  closer  look  at  Indonesian  SME  exports  reveals  the  following \nmain characteristics: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nSME  exports  are  concentrated  in  labor-intensive  subsectors  where  low  wages \nare  important  to  enhance  the  comparative  and  competitive  position  of  foreign \nmarkets.  \nIndonesian SME exports are concentrated in clusters. It is well known that SME \nfurniture,  garments,  and  basic  machinery  production  is  located  primarily  in \nagglomerations  of  small  firms.  These  clusters  participate  in  international  trade \nnetworks to bring down the transaction costs of international trade. \nSME  exports  have  increased  throughout  the  crisis  years  due  to  their  relatively \nlimited  reliance  on  imported  components  compared  with  those  of  larger \ncompanies.  \n\n \n4. \nPresently,  only  the  Central  Bureau  of  Statistics  (Biro  Pusat  Statistik  [BPS])  makes  a \nsystematic  distinction  among  household  (cottage),  small,  medium,  and  large-scale  enterprises \non the basis of the number of workers.  Our focus will be on SMEs and large enterprises, not \nmicroenterprises.  According  to  the  1996  CBS  census,  the  microenterprise  sector  employs \nnearly two thirds of the manufacturing workforce. Despite their large contribution to employment, \ndata  on  microenterprises  tend  to  be  unavailable  in  a  comparable  format  to  those  of  more \nstructured businesses. More importantly, promotion of microenterprises may not necessarily be \na high- return activity, such as export activity, for countries in need of an acceleration in growth. \nLarger  increases  in  productivity  occur  as  firms  grow  into  the  small  and/or  medium  categories. \nSee Figure A2.2.  \n\n \n\nFigure A2.2: Missing a \"Productive Middle\"\n\nIndonesia's Manufacturing, 1996\n\nEmployment \n\n\"Missing Middle\"\n\nProductivity (GDP per worker) \n\n1-4 \n\nSource: BPS. \n\n5-19\n\n20-99 \n\n100+ \n\nEmployment-based Size \n\n14000\n\n12000\n\n10000\n\n8000\n\n6000\n\n4000\n\n2000\n\n0\n\n \n\n \nr\ne\nk\nr\no\nw\n \nr\ne\np\nh\na\ni\np\nu\nR\n \n0\n9\n9\n1\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n45% \n\n40% \n\n35% \n\n30% \n\n25% \n\n20% \n\n15% \n\n10% \n\n5% \n\n0% \n\n \n\ng\nn\ni\nr\nu\n\nf\n\nt\nc\na\nu\nn\na\nM\n \nn\ni\n \nt\nn\ne\nm\ny\no\np\nm\nE\n\nl\n\n \nf\no\n \ne\ng\na\nt\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\nP\n\n\f \n26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nThe crisis occurred towards the end of 1997 and peaked in 1998. If one takes the 5-year \n5. \nspan between 1996 and 2000 to examine the impact of the crisis, one allows for some time to \nadjust after the unprecedented contraction of 1998.  The Asian Crisis caused a large turmoil in \nIndonesia\u2019s industrial structure, even though in the aggregate the number of firms appeared to \nbe  almost  unaffected.  This  appendix  uses  the  latest  available  data  for  more  than  20,000 \nindustrial enterprises from the Annual Manufacturing Survey of 1996 and 2000 produced by the \nCentral Bureau of Statistics. Surveys recorded 22,997 firms in operation in 1996 and 22,174 in \n2000, i.e., a modest decline of 3.5% in the number of firms. However, the first impression when \none compares these two snapshots hides the fact that 6,100 firms (26.5% of all firms in 1996) \nclosed down between 1996 and 2000, and 5,277 new firms started operations during the same \nperiod. \n \nDespite of the great upheaval in firm numbers among the smallest firms, the number of \n6. \njobs in the very small-scale sector (small enterprises employing 20-49 workers) remained about \nthe  same.  Due  to  firm  closures,  121  thousand  jobs  were  lost;  the  expansion  of  the  remaining \nsmallest firms led to 28,000 more jobs; and, the new smallest firms created 91,000 jobs. The net \nresult was an employment loss of less than 1%.  In all other size categories (except the largest \nfirms), firms showed increments in total employment. The largest firms lost nearly 50,000 jobs \nprimarily  as  a  result  of  employment  reduction  in  the  surviving  very  large  industries,  which \nshowed  a  contraction  rather  than  an  expansion.  The  resulting  jobs  became  more  productive. \nIncreases in value added with a constant labor force would point to an increase in productivity \nthat  might  lead  to  increased  exports.  The  gains  in  value  added  proved  to  be  highest  for  the \nsmallest firms and lower for the remaining sectors. In fact, the increase in productivity registered \nby  small  firms  probably  accounts  for  the  lion\u2019s  share  of  the  impressive  increase  in  exports  by \nthese firms. When one compares the 2000 figures with the 1996 figures, small firms increased \ntheir exports by 83% while exports of the largest enterprises decreased by 10% (Table A2.2).  \n \n\nTable A2.2: Exports by Firm Dynamics, Indonesia, 1996-2000 \n(billion constant 2000 rupiah) \n \n\nWorker-\nbased \nSize1 \n\nChange in \nExports \nbecause of \nFirm Exits \n\nChanges in \nExports \nbecause of  \nExpansions\n\nTotal Change \nin Exports in \n2000 \n\nTotal \nExports \nin 1996 \n\n% \nExport \nGrowth \n\nPercentage \nof Total \nExports in \n2000 \n\n \n\n(1) \n\n(2) \n\n(5) \n\n(4)/(5) \n\nSmall 1 \nSmall 2 \nMedium 1 \nMedium 2 \nLarge 1 \nLarge 2 \nTOTAL \n\n-354 \n-448 \n-830 \n-1832 \n-2793 \n-5288 \n-11546 \n\n608\n571\n2866\n3204\n7170\n-5486\n8934\n\n(4)=(1)+(2)+(3)\n833\n1409\n5347\n5652\n9985\n-6233\n16992\n\n579\n1287\n3311\n4279\n5608\n4540\n19604\n\n1001\n2531\n7346\n23958\n23440\n64336\n122613\n\n(6)=(4)+(5)/\n1.3%\n2.8%\n9.1%\n21.2%\n23.9%\n41.6%\n100.0%\n\n83.2 \n55.7 \n72.8 \n23.6 \n42.6 \n-9.7 \n13.9 \n\n1  Small  1  (20-49  workers);  Small  2  (50-99  workers);  Medium  (100-100  workers);  Medium  2  (200-499  workers); \n\nLarge 1 (500-999 workers); and Large 2 (1,000 workers or more). \n\nSource: 1996 and 2000 Industrial Surveys. BPS. \n \n7. \nFinancing,  equipment,  and  materials  are  just  some  of  the  key  inputs  for  producing \nexports. First, lack of credit has often been identified as one of the major obstacles to the growth \n\nChanges \nin \nExports \nbecause \nof New \nEntries \n(3) \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n27\n\nof SMEs.  Therefore, we introduce the availability of finance, as proxied by the interest paid by \nfirms on loans, to examine the impact of finance on exports. Also, the relative use of machinery \ncould also be considered an explanatory variable for SME exports.  Thus the use of machinery \nwould  indicate  specialization  and  the  capacity  to  produce  according  to  narrowly  defined \ntechnical specifications.  These characteristics should be conducive to export. Finally, the value \nof imported inputs is important in the explanation of exports when specific imports are essential \nto  the  production  of  exports,  and  the  exporting  activity  is  related  to  assembly  rather  than \nproduction.  \n \n8. \nAccess  to  credit  proved  a  significant  variable  in  the  explanation  of  exports  in  both  the \nSME and large sectors. While some of the success by SMEs in overcoming the crisis years has \nbeen  related  to  their  lack  of  bank  loans  (the  Asia  Foundation  and  other  surveys  indicate  that \nless  than  one  fifth  of  SMEs  had  access  to  bank  loans),  the  negative  effect  of  bank  loans  on \nenterprises  tended  to  be  stronger  for  non-exporting  enterprises  that  took  loans  in  foreign \ncurrency  and  that  were  affected  by  the  subsequent  devaluation  after  the  crisis.  Bank  loans  or \n\u201cfinancial inputs\u201d are still important determinants to sustain export activity. \n \n9. \nThe relative use of machinery also proved to be a significant export determinant in both \nthe  SME  and  large  sectors.    The  significance  of  the  positive  coefficient  for  the  SME  sector  is, \nhowever,  much  greater  than  that  for  the  large  sector.    Thus,  the  great  importance  of  labor \nproductivity in the explanation of SME exports may be related to the use of machinery. This fact \nonly reinforces the view that SME sector exports are to a large extent driven by specialization \nand productivity. This view may be further supported by the fact that large sector exports appear \nto  be  much  more  dependent  on  imported  inputs.  The  coefficient  for  imported  inputs  is  highly \nsignificant for the large sector, while it has no statistical significance in the SME regression. The \nhigh  reliance  on  imported  inputs  among  large  conglomerates  in  Indonesia  also  affected  their \ncapacity to recover from the crisis. Many large sector enterprises may be engaged in assembly \nof imported parts rather than direct production operations. \n \n10. \nSMEs  rely  more  on  specialization,  productivity,  and  external  industrial  services  to \naccomplish  export  competitiveness  than  their  large-scale  counterparts.  Based  on  recent \nindustrial  statistics  and  comparing  them  with  those  of  the  precrisis  period,  Indonesian  SMEs \nshow higher growth in productivity and exports than their larger counterparts. Case studies have \nindicated  that  various  mechanisms  were  already  at  work  in  Indonesian  manufacturing  SMEs \nsuch  as  technology  diffusion  through  foreign  buyers,  active  subcontracting,  and  clustering. \nOther  factors  have  also  contributed  to  export  growth  such  as  the  ability  to  secure  access  to \ncredit.  The  crisis  itself  appears  to  have  shed  unproductive  enterprises,  improved  labor \nproductivity  and  increased  exports,  especially  among  the  smallest  enterprises.  Policies  that \nfocus  on  SME-specific  success  factors  or  strengths  such  as  specialization  may  prove  to  be \nmore effective to overcome the hefty disparity between SMEs and large corporations, and boost \nSME export potential. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nOVERALL PERFORMANCE OF BANKING SECTOR AND INTERMEDIARY BANKS1 \n\nOverview of the Banking System \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nAfter the crisis, the Government of Indonesia embarked on a liquidation and stabilization \nprogram  to  restore  public  confidence  in  the  banking  sector,  which  has  proven  costly  but \neffective.  Despite  the  fact  that  government  bonds  for  recapitalization  of  banks  amounted  to \nRp645  trillion  or  $76  billion,  the  comprehensive  bank  restructuring  has  helped  remarkably  to \nimprove  banking  sector  indicators  (Table  A3.1).  Banks\u2019  capital  and  profits  improved,  and \nnonperforming  loans  (NPLs)  in  the  system  declined.  Total  banking  sector  capital,  which  had \ndropped sharply to negative Rp129.8 trillion after the crisis in 1998, recovered to Rp62.3 trillion \nin  2001.  Total  profit  before  tax  recovered  from  negative  Rp178.6  trillion  to  Rp131  trillion,  and \nNPLs from 48.6% to 12.1% during the same period. Despite the improved performance of the \nbanking sector in 2001 and 2002, several factors still hinder their intermediation function. Loans \n(in both local currency and foreign exchange) dropped dramatically after the crisis and have yet \nto recover precrisis levels, and so has the use of deposits for loans. Banks prefer high interest \npayments  from  recapitalization  bonds  to  the  risk  of  lending.  Loan-to-deposit  ratios  (LDRs)  are \nmuch higher for foreign exchange than for local currency. In 2001, the banks\u2019 LDR for foreign \ncurrency stood at 63.8%, more than double the LDR for local currency.  \n \n\nTable A3.1: Banking Indicators, Indonesia, 1998-2001 \n\n \n\nIndicator \n\n1998\n\n1999\n\n2000 \n\n2001\n\n797.4\n62.3\n1,099.7\n31.4%\n63.8%\n202.6\n105.0\n12.1\n3.6\n13.1\n1.19\n\n625.4\n(129.8)\n895.5\n72.8%\n121.8%\n313.1\n174.3\n48.6\n34.7\n(178.6)\n0.38\n\n699.1 \n52.3 \n1,030.5 \n27.4% \n70.8% \n152.5 \n116.5 \n18.8 \n5.8 \n10.5 \n1.02 \n\nDeposits (Rp trillion) \n617.6\nCapital (Rp trillion) \n(41.2)\nTotal Assets (Rp trillion) \n1,006.7\nLDR in Local Currency \n28.5%\nLDR in Foreign Exchange \n63.7%\nLoans in Local Currency (Rp trillion) \n140.5\nLoans in Foreign Exchange (Rp trillion) \n84.6\nNPL \u2013 gross (%) \n32.8\nNPL \u2013 net (%) \n7.3\nProfit (Loss) before Tax (Rp trillion) \n(91.7)\nROA (%) \n(9.11)\nLDR = loan-to-deposit ratio, NPL = nonperforming loan, ROA = return on assets   \nSource: Bank Indonesia. \n \n2. \nCredit from banks requires better intermediation. Credit for investment (long-term) loans \nhas  been  slower  in  recovering,  even  more  so  in  the  case  of  investment  credit  in  foreign \nexchange (Figure A3.1). Progress in credit and corporate restructuring has been slow because \nof  (i)  prolonged  disagreement  on  terms  and  conditions  of  debt  restructuring  between  debtors \nand  creditors;  (ii)  decline \nin  collateral  value  under  the  current  economic  conditions; \n(iii) increased country risk,2 which has resulted in higher interest costs for financing abroad for \nexporters and for domestic banks borrowing from overseas, and has made foreign investors risk \naverse  concerning  the  investment  in  Indonesia;  (iv)  volatility  at  the  exchange  rate;  and  (v)  the \nuncertainty and complexity of legal matters.

However,  there  is  no  unique  definition  of  an  SME,  let  alone  a \ncommon definition of an SME loan. Lack of data about the ultimate beneficiaries of small loans \nexplains  why  the  working  hypothesis  has  been  to  use  \u201csmall  loans\u201d  as  a  synonym  for  \u201cSME \nloans.\u201d In fact, the trend has been for banks to move to smaller loans as part of their shift away \nfrom  large  corporations.  Banks  have  slowly  started  to  regard  loans  to  SMEs  as  profitable \nbecause  of  (i)  the  relatively  low  portion  of  NPLs  in  this  segment,  (ii)  their  need  for  risk \ndiversification,  (iii)  the  higher  profit  margin  in  SME  lending,  (iv)  low  sensitivity  to  changes  in \ninterest  rates,  and  (v)  SMEs\u2019  compliance  with  their  loan  repayment  obligations.  Table  A3.2 \nshows the breakdown of loans by size and by type of bank. As of 2001, \u201cmicro and small\u201d loans \n(below  Rp1  billion)  were  equivalent  to  18.7%  of  the  total  credit,  while  \u201cmicro,  small,  and \nmedium\u201d loans (below Rp5 billion), corresponded to 27.4%. Of all loans below Rp5 billion, state \nand private banks (the latter have various degrees of state ownership after their restructuring) \nprovided most (82.7%) vis-\u00e0-vis the share of 11.2% for foreign banks.  Large increases in SME \nlending  by  Indonesian  banks  in  2002  and  2003  are  expected  in  these  size  categories,  which \nbanks refer as retail (micro and small) and mid market (small and medium) loans. \n \n\nTable A3.2.

On the one hand, banks need to consider the \nquality  of  their  portfolios.  The  overall  trend  for  NPLs  has  been  to  decline  consistently  with  the \nsuccess of the restructuring of the banking sector. NPLs for SME loans show that the quality of \nthis portfolio has been high throughout and they pose no immediate risk for banks (Table A3.3). \nOn  the  other  hand,  banks  still  need  to  implement  better  systems  that  will  allow  them  to \nsuccessfully  enlarge  their  SME  business,  let  alone  SME  investment  credit.  Most  of  the  banks \nunder  consideration  are  in  the  midst  of  launching  corporate  strategies  that  will  help  them  to \nimprove  their  product  mix,  credit  and  pricing  policies,  human  resource  mix,  branch  network \nconfiguration, and management information systems (Table A3.3). Most importantly, a change \nin  mindset  may  be  needed  not  just  at  the  head  office,  but  at  each  and  every  branch.  Without \nsuch fundamental changes, larger SME portfolios could lead to greater losses in the future. \n \nPart  of  the  change  in  strategy  for  lending  to  SMEs  includes  an  increased  portion  of \n5. \nlending for SMEs (Table A3.4). The proposed project aims at increasing the availability of long-\nterm funds in foreign exchange for investment lending among SME exporters. The participating \nbanks  (PBs)  under  the  project  have  (i)  good  prospects  for  privatization  in  the  near  future;  (ii) \ngood  developments  in  terms  of  SME  focus  in  their  operations  (as  reflected  in  their  annual \nreports and interviews); (iii) very good quality of SME lending, with average NPLs significantly \nbelow 5%; (iv) reasonably high use of foreign exchange in terms of LDRs in foreign exchange; \nand (v) absorptive capacity for the Project\u2019s funds that reflects their current absorption of loans \nin  foreign  exchange  and  their  clientele  of  exporters.

Subscribed  and  paid-up  capital  is  Rp3  trillion  (approximate  $312  million).  BEI \noperates  through  a  board  consisting  of  three  commissioners  appointed  by  the  Government,  a \nboard of directors consisting of a president director and two managing directors, nine divisional \nheads,  and  two  regional  marketing  office  heads.  All  board  members  (commissioner  and \ndirectors) have passed the fit and proper test of Bank Indonesia (BI). \n \n\n2.  \n\nPolicies, Scope of Operations, and Lending Policies and Procedures \n\n \n7. \nThe  board  focuses  on  maintaining  BEI  operations  in  line  with  Government  Decree \nno.37/1999, which states that the objective of BEI is to support the development of Indonesian \nexporters\u2019  competitiveness.  BEI  is  a  special  bank  that  does  not  provide  the  usual  commercial \nbanking  services  such  as  deposit  facilities.  It  focuses  specifically  on  every  aspect  of  export \nfinancing. Almost every business cycle in export-import financing activities can be supported by \nBEI,  from  import  LC  guarantee  up  to  export  bill  receivable  discounting.  Other  financing  and \nservices  provided  by  BEI  are  import  LC  financing,  pre-shipment  export  financing  guarantee, \nexport working capital loan financing, and investment financing (under the proposed Small and \nMedium Enterprise Export Development Project). \n \n \n \n8. \nA  summary  of  BEI\u2019s  operational  performance  (actual  income  for  1999  to  2001  and \nprojected income for 2002) is given below. Compared with 2000, total assets of 2001 decreased \nby  12.79%,  due  to  the  repayment  of  the  bank\u2019s  borrowing  to  the  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation (JBIC) two-step loan scheme. Although in 2001, BEI started to pay back its funding \nfrom  JBIC,  the  bank\u2019s  financing  facilities  grew  significantly  from  only  Rp157  million  in  1999  to \nRp5.8  trillion  in  2001.  Therefore  to  maintain  financing  activities,  BEI  should  establish  its \ncredibility in order to find other funding sources. BEI\u2019s overall operating performance for 2001, \nbased on BI-CAMEL criteria for soundness of a bank, was a \u201csound/healthy\u201d rating of 97.13%. \n \n\nOperational Performance \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\nFinancial Performance and Portfolio Quality \n\n \n9. \nIn  its  first  year  of  operation  in  1999,  BEI  made  a  small  profit,  and  its  capital  base \nremained  intact.  Moreover,  in  2000  and  2001,  BEI  generated  a  large  amount  of  profit  before \ntax\uf8e7Rp248 billion in 2000 and Rp438 billion in 2001 (Table A3.5). It is thus considered one of \nthe most profitable banks in Indonesia in terms of return on assets (ROA) and return on equity \n(ROE) ratios. In 2001, BEI had an ROA of 3.30% and a ROE of 8.44%, much higher than the \naverage 1.2% ROA of the banking industry in Indonesia as a whole. Its ratio of possible loss-\nincurring  assets  to  total  earning  assets  in  2001  was  zero,  whereas  the  ratio  of  allowance  for \npossible losses to total earning assets was 1.4%. It has no nonperforming loan portfolio. \n \n \n \n10. \nAs  a  bank  with  a  focus  on  export  activities  and  exporters,  BEI  should  have  a  strong \nfunding  in  foreign  exchange  to  cover  the  demand  of  exporters.  A  major  challenge  ahead  is  to \n\nFuture Performance and Conclusion \n\n5. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n35 \n \n\nfind other funding sources if the JBIC foreign currency loan cannot be extended. BEI should be \nable to find other funding sources with interest rates lower than commercial market (JBIC\u2019s rate \nwas  remarkably  lower  than  the  commercial  rate),  so  that  BEI  can  relend  or  refinance  other \nbanks at competitive rates. By having reasonably priced wholesale funding, BEI could generate \nan  adequate  profit  margin  to  cover  its  costs  and  to  provide  low  interest  rates  to  support \nexporters. \n \n11. \nThe management of BEI has composed a blueprint of the BEI Corporate Plan for 2000-\n2004 that is to be implemented for the next five years. The Corporate Plan is essential for BEI \nas a long-term business and growth strategy to fulfill its vision of becoming a world class export \ncredit  agency  with  implementation  of  good  corporate  governance  and  internationally  accepted \noperational procedures. With the strong performance BEI has achieved during the past 3 years, \nBEI\u2019s day-to-day operations in 2002 anticipate such future role. \n \n12. \nBEI  had  also  achieved  a  significant  improvement  in  serving  SMEs.  According  to  its \nannual  report,  operations  involving  SMEs  grew  by  153.11%  in  2001,  representing  a  share  of \nmore than half of all loan disbursements (Rp7.33 trillion). \n \n\nTable A3.5\nBank Ekspor Indonesia Summary Balance Sheet\n\n(as of 31 December 2001) \n\n \n\nItem \n\nAssets \n\nCash on Hand \nDue from Bank Indonesia \nDue from Other Banks \nLoans  Receivable - net \nOther Assets \n\nTOTAL ASSETS \n\nLiabilities    \n\n   Due to Other Banks \n   Other Liabilities \n   Fund Borrowing \nTotal Liabilities \n\nShareholders' Funds     \n     Equity \n     Reserves \n\nTotal Stockholders' Funds \n\n1999\n\n2000\n\n2001 \n\n2002\n\n(Rp million)\nProjected\n\n1\n1,365\n870,076\n157,196\n1,998,860\n\n22\n290,577\n9,802,881\n2,718,357\n69,463\n\n99 \n810 \n5,365,579 \n5,844,027 \n22,849 \n\n100\n972\n765,579\n6,428,430\n2,690,280\n\n3,027,498 12,881,300\n\n11,233,364 \n\n9,885,360\n\n0\n8,388\n0\n8,388\n\n77,009\n27,669\n9,595,000\n9,699,678\n\n16,455 \n53,208 \n7,800,000 \n7,869,663 \n\n21,392\n3,118,417\n3,200,000\n6,339,809\n\n3,000,000\n19,110\n\n        \n\n3,000,000\n181,622\n\n     \n\n3,000,000 \n363,701 \n\n        \n\n3,000,000\n545,552\n       \n\n3,019,110\n  \n\n3,181,622\n  \n\n3,363,701 \n\n    \n\n3,545,552\n    \n\nTotal Liabilities and Shareholders' Funds\n\n3,027,498 12,881,300\n\n11,233,364 \n\n9,885,360\n\nCapital-Adequacy Ratio     ( % ) \n\n8,053.18\n\n    \n\n132.40\n\nLoan-Deposits Ratio  (BI Regulation) ( % ) \n\n0.00\n\n0.00\n\n135.52 \n\n0.00 \n\n155%\n\n0.00\n\nBI = Bank Indonesia \nSource: Bank Ekspor Indonesia (BEI). \n \n\n \n\n\f \n36 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nECONOMIC AND SECTOR WORK, 1998-2002 \n\n \n \n \n1998  Wieland,  Robert  et  al.

The funds will \u201cpass through\u201d from Bank \nEkspor  Indonesia  (BEI)  to  participating  banks  to  small  and  medium  enterprises  (SMEs),  once \nthe SMEs have submitted their actual requirements. \n  \n\n \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\nParticipating banks (PBs) provide BEI estimates of subloan disbursements for the \nfirst 6 months of the Project. The total amount ($7.5 million as of August 2002) will \nrepresent  the  initial  advance.  Note  that  the  initial  advance  may  be  less  than  the \nimprest account ceiling at the initial stages of the Project. \nBEI prepares a draft withdrawal application (WA) for initial advance for submission \nto  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF).  Attached  (as  per  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s \n[ADB]  regulations)  will  be  the  expected  disbursements  on  approved  subloans  as \nprovided in step 1. \n\n3.

This initial advance \nwill act as the imprest ceiling. \nSMEs provide firm cash requirements to PBs on a regular basis. \nPBs submit requirements to BEI. \nBEI transfers cash requirements to each PB. \nPBs transfer funds to SMEs. \n\n5. \n6. \n7. \n8. \n9-12.

When the imprest balance is approximately 50% of initial advance amount, BEI will \nsubmit a draft WA to MOF for replenishment. Supporting documentation will be the \nbank statement and a list of the SME subloans against which a disbursement has \nbeen made. The assumption is that the replenishment will be based on the actual \nexpenses  incurred.  If  the  estimated  requirements  for  the  following  6  months  is \nmore than the initial advance amount then an additional amount will be requested, \nsupported  by  a  justification.  The  maximum  balance  at  any  time  in  the  imprest \naccount cannot exceed the imprest account ceiling established in step 1 unless a \nspecial request is made to ADB.  \n14.  MOF submits signed WA to ADB. \n15.

TAMU will be located at BEI during the course of \nthe  Project.  The  consultants  are  expected  to  be  either  international  or  domestic  individual \nconsultants. \n \n2. \n \n\nTAMU will focus on: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\nto \n\nto \n\nimprove \n\nfinancial \n\nthe  agreed \n\nintermediation  and  on \n\ncoordinating  sub-loan  processing  administration  and  monitoring  procedures \nimplementation \nbetween  PBs,  MOF  and  ADB  according \narrangements;  \nsupporting MOF and BEI to prepare reports or provide documentation in relation \nto loan administration;  \nproviding  lessons  learned  on  the  on-going  administration  of  the  new  apex \nmodality \nintermediation \nexperiences of other regional export agencies;  \nimproving skills of credit officers from the PBs related to project identification and \nappraisal of small investment projects; \nsupporting  eligible  SME  exporters  to  apply  for  SEIF  through  the  eligible  PBs, \nespecially in locations outside Jakarta with export potential; \nreviewing  letters  of  agreement  for  the  economic  impact  on  micro  and  SMEs  of \neligible sub-projects,  including the nature of the business network;  \npromoting  SEIF  in  coordination  with  other  donor  activities  in  support  of  SME \nexporters; and \nreviewing  the  initial  environment  examination  of  sub-projects  by  PBs  to  identify \nenvironmentally sensitive subprojects. \n\nthe \n\n \n3. \nTAMU  will  only  have  an  advisory  and  monitoring  role.  The  approval  of  subloans  takes \nplace  at  the  selected  PBs,  which  will  assess  the  credit  risk  of  SME  exporters.  BEI  and  ADB \n(Indonesia  Resident  Mission  or  IRM)  will  process  subloan  applications  in  accordance  with  the \nimplementation arrangements.  \n \n4. \nThroughout the project\u2019s implementation, ADB will maintain in parallel close coordination \nwith  the  expert  from  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)  at  BEI.  JICA  is  the \nadministrator of Japan\u2019s SME promotion program in Indonesia, which includes activities such as \nthe  export  training  centers.  In  1988,  the  Government  of  Japan  provided  a  grant  of  about \n$16 million  equivalent  to  finance  the  establishment  of  the  Indonesia  Export  Training  Center \n(IETC). In conjunction with the proposed TA, Japan\u2019s SME promotion program aims at setting \nup  four  regional  export  training  and  promotion  centers  to  provide  training  for  export,  trade \ninformation and promotion services for SMEs in East Java (starting in 2002), North Sumatra and \nSouth Sulawesi (2003) and Kalimantan (2004).  \n \n5. \nIn parallel, other donors will also support TAMU through their actual or planned activities \nbetween 2002 and 2005.

The Poverty Assessment (PA) for Indonesia2 notes that policies \nfostering  SMEs  are  key  to  reducing  poverty,  as  the  number  of  SMEs  is  large,  they  are \ndistributed all over the country, they use labor-intensive technology, and they can absorb lower- \nskill labor. The last point is particularly important, as 60% of the prime age labor force3 has had \nonly 6 years of education or less.   \n \n2. \nSMEs are a major stepping-stone out of poverty and an engine of growth. Unskilled or \nsemiskilled workers are coupled with technology, thereby increasing their productivity more than \ncould  otherwise  be  done  through  the  application  of  their  labor  alone.  The  Economic  Census4 \nshows that the productivity of workers triples as they move from micro to small enterprises and \ntriples again from small to medium enteprises.  The 1995 national input-output (I/O) matrix5 also \nindicates a relatively high value-added multiplier in the sectors where SMEs are concentrated. \nThese  sectors  include  agricultural  product  processing,  basic  iron  and  steel  industries,  textiles \nand clothing, and wood products. The I/O tables also show high labor productivity in these same \nsectors.  The  trade  sector,  another  important  area  of  SME  concentration,  reports  high  value \nadded, but not necessarily high labor productivity.  \n \n3. \nBy contrast the agriculture sector, where the poor are concentrated, shows much lower \nvalue  added  and  labor  productivity.  Higher  value  added  and  labor  productivity  are  reflected  in \nworker  wages.  Therefore  one  would  expect  SME  workers  to  fare  better  than  informal  sector \nworkers.  Monitoring  changes  in  welfare  through  real  wages6  indicates  that  workers  in  the \nmanufacturing  sector  have  fared  much  better  than  agricultural  laborers  and  urban  informal \nsector workers7 since mid-1999, when the impact of the crisis began to recede.   \n \n4. \nSMEs provide employment opportunities for both men and women.  Some industries are \nvery male dominated such as the basic metal industries and furniture.  Other industries such as \nfood  processing  and  garments  are  very  female-oriented.  Overall,  the  trade  and  manufacturing \nsectors provide employment for a larger proportion of the female workforce, nearly double the \nrate  of  males  for  the  lower  two  income  quintiles,  representing  the  poor  and  near  poor.  SMEs \nprovide  the  main  alternative  to  agriculture  in  rural  areas  where  many  are  located  to  take \nadvantage of the availability of land and water, or the proximity of raw materials. \n \n5. \nIn addition to providing necessary quality work opportunities for Indonesia\u2019s burgeoning \nlabor force, SMEs promote more employment creation by drawing on goods and services from \nthe sectors where the poor are concentrated.  As with value added and labor productivity, the \nI/O tables show deep backward linkages in the sectors populated by SMEs. \n\n                                                 \n1   Prepared by Lisa Kulp, Social Sector Development Specialist, SERD. \n2   ADB. 2000.

The  Indonesian  labor  force  must  absorb  about  2.5  million \nnew  entrants  each  year.  As  the  Indonesian  labor  market  is  relatively  mobile,  the  immediate \nresult of the 1997 economic crisis was a shifting of workers across sectors, with agriculture, the \nsafety  net  of  last  resort,  registering  the  largest  increase.  But  after  nearly  5  years  of  moribund \ngrowth,  unemployment  is  rising,  particularly  among  the  young,  fueling  existing  trends  toward \nincreased social tension and instability. \n \n7. \nWhile the 2001 Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement (PRPA) notes the importance \nof pro-poor growth and employment promotion, the First Annual Poverty Reduction Partnership \nReview,  which  was  signed  in  April  2002,  further  notes  that  \u201cgiven  the  sustained  high  levels  of \npoverty  and  unemployment  and  low  level  of  growth,  greater  emphasis  must  be  placed  on  a \nshort-term  growth  program  to  accelerate  pro-poor  growth  for  employment  creation  without \ncompromising  macroeconomic  stability.\u201d    Although  the  PRPA  review  did  not  prescribe  the \nmeans  to  accelerate  pro-poor  growth  for  employment  creation,  support  for  SME  development, \nparticularly SMEs in trade and manufacturing, is clearly one such avenue. \n \n8. \nThe  decline  in  poverty  from  the  mid-1980s  into  the  1990s  was  largely  due  to  a  rise  in \ntrade  and  exports.    The  PA  notes  that  this  rise  was  due  to  policies  stimulating  labor-intensive \nexports, which enabled the shift of workers from agriculture into higher productivity jobs in the \nsectors  where  the  export-based  SMEs  are  clustered.  By  the  mid-1990s,  however,  Indonesia\u2019s \ncompetitive advantage was weakening. While the first phase of export-oriented industrialization, \nbased  on  simple  technologies  and  cheap  labor,  remains  important,  it  can  no  longer  be  relied \nupon exclusively as the prime mover of growth and poverty reduction. To this end, the Poverty \nPartnership Agreement notes that Indonesia will have to make the transition to the next phase \nof industrial development based on technology- and skill-intensive industries. \n \n9. \nHow well Indonesia makes this transition will depend on its ability to access knowledge \nand funding for the necessary retooling. While the government has attempted to provide these \nservices directly, these attempts have not always proved successful. The PA notes the need to \nprovide  access  for  SMEs  to  technical  and  managerial  skills  through  private  sector  providers \nsuch  as  training  institutions  and  business  consultants.  It  further  notes  the  need  to  strengthen \nSME access to the financial sector. \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe Small and Medium Enterprise Export Development Project (SMEEDP) will serve the \nneeds of a subgroup of SMEs\uf8e7the export SMEs.  It will do so through two channels.  First, it \nwill  provide  sustainable  long-term  financing  for  upgrading,  expansion,  and  permanent  working \ncapital and by promoting access to financial and business services. Subloans may be made to \nSMEs as well as to trading houses with close ties to SMEs. Lending to SMEs through trading \nhouses  will  enable  access  to  SMEs  with  the  potential  for  growth  but  which  have  not  yet \nachieved  the  design  and  quality  required  by  the  international  market,  the  ability  to  deal  with \nexport  procedures,  or  the  ability  to  communicate  with  foreign  buyers;  still  require  liquidity \nsupport;  and  may  not  be  able  to  fully  assume  the  risk  associated  with  expansion.    As  trading \nhouses  are  clustered  in  sectors  with  the  greatest  linkages  to  the  poor  such  as  garments  and \nhandicrafts, this further extends the scope of the loan to SMEs with the greatest labor absorbing \npotential. \n \n\nThe Project \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n47 \n \n\n \n11. \nThe employment impact of the loan is expected to be large. SMEEDP-funded expansion \nwill necessitate increased labor inputs in the form of direct employment and through increased \ndemand for raw or intermediate inputs provided by individuals or microenterprises. For example, \nwhere  the  availability  of  kiln-dried  wood  is  a  limitation,  investment  in  a  kiln  dryer  will  allow  a \nfurniture  manufacturer  to  accept  more  orders.  The  manufacturer  would  hire  additional \npermanent workers for finishing, while production of parts, such as chair and table legs, would \nbe done by smaller suppliers using the manufacturer-provided kiln-dried wood. While there are \nalso some employment impacts related to the physical implementation of the expansion such as \nin  construction,  the  employment  impacts  referred  to  here  are  sustainable  for  the  life  of  the \ninvestment.  Moreover  additional  employment  will  be  generated  as  SMEEDP  funds  are  repaid \nand re-lent (second-round effects). \n \n12. \nThe first round impact of investment is estimated to be between 1 million and 2 million \njob  years.    One  case  study  of  cold  storage  in  the  fish  processing  industry  in  South  Sulawesi \nindicated  substantial  demand  for  SMEEDP  loan  products  for  upgrading  and  expansion \nsuggesting that for each $500,000 invested, 500 new full-time jobs years are created requiring \nthe inputs from 10,000 fisherfolk-years.  A separate review of a Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau \n(KfW) credit line for clean technologies in SMEs shows that a $50,000 investment in a plastics \nchipping  factory  generated  100  additional  jobs-years  and  required  800  scavengers-years  to \nprovide sufficient recyclable waste material to meet the needs of the new investment. These are \nthe  high-and  low-case  scenarios  for  employment  impact.  The  initial  pipeline  of  investments \nproposed for the SMEEDP suggests an employment impact of 1.5 million job-years.8 \n \nThe  SMEEDP  provides  long-term  employment  prospects  for  unskilled  and  semiskilled \n13. \nworkers  vital  to  absorb  the  2.5  million  entrants  to  the  labor  market  each  year  and  provides \nprospects  for  more  productive  work  for  a  large  segment  of  the  labor  force  including  the  10% \nseeking work and better opportunities and the 60% of the workers currently engaged in the in \nthe informal sector. It is not possible to calculate the percentage of poor that would benefit from \nthe  additional  employment  or  the  percentage  by  which  the  incidence  of  poverty  would  be \nreduced because of the SMEEDP. With respect to the former, a worker is poor if he or she is a \nmember  of  a  poor  household.  The  SMEEDP  will  not  require  a  household  income  and \nexpenditure survey for new employees at entry.  It is likely that the majority of the new jobs and \nnew  opportunities  will  accrue  to  individuals  who  would  otherwise  be  vulnerable  to  poverty  by \nvirtue  of  their  low  level  of  education.  The  incidence  of  poverty  is  affected  by  many  factors \nbeyond  the  scope  of  the  SMEEDP,  including  changes  in  the  price  of  major  staple  foods.  \nNonetheless, the majority of these workers expecting to find productive work in the SME sector \nunder  the  program  will  be  drawn  from  among  the  poor  or  near  poor  and  would  otherwise \ncontinue to compete in the already overcrowded and less well remunerated informal sector.  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n8   Based on $35 million of total project investment creating additional 47,000 job-years at the borrowing SMEs plus \n\n705,000 job-years in subcontractors and supplies (i.e., additional job-years for each SME job-year created).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n48 \n \n \n14. \n \n\nThe summary poverty reduction and social strategy follows. \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \n\nYes \n\nSector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty \npartnership agreement? \n\nSector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty \nanalysis? \nContribution  of  the  sector/subsector  to  reduce  poverty  in  Indonesia:  The  Poverty  Assessment  for \nIndonesia  (footnote  2)  notes  that  policies  fostering  small  and  medium  enterprises  (SMEs)  are  key  to \nreducing  poverty,  as  the  number  of  SMEs  is  large,  they  are  distributed  all  over  the  country,  they  use \nlabor-intensive technology, and they can absorb lower-skill labor. This is particularly important, as 60% of \nthe prime age labor force (footnote 3) have had only 6 years of education or less. In addition to providing \nnecessary quality work opportunities for Indonesia\u2019s burgeoning labor force, SMEs promote employment \ncreation by drawing on goods and services from the sectors where the poor are concentrated. \n \n\nYes \n\n \n\n \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\nB. \nThe  SMEEDP  provides  long-term  employment  prospects  for  unskilled  and  semiskilled  workers  vital  to \nabsorb the 2.5 million entrants to the labor market each year and provides prospects for more productive \nwork for a large segment of the labor force including the 10% seeking work and better opportunities and \nthe  60%  currently  engaged  in  the  informal  sector.

Bank \ncredit is one important source of financing investment expenditures in SME (another would be direct equity investments from overseas \nor domestic investors). Within Indonesia, the commercial bank system has outstanding investment credit in US$ of $8 billion as of June \n2002. If 25% of this credit goes to investment in SMEs, ADB assistance through SMEEDP would account for about 6-14% of investment \ncredit.  Higher capital investment has proven to be a significant export determinant in exports. Moreover, its impact is much greater for \nSMEs  than  for  the  corporate  sector,  because  of  the  SME  low  initial  productivity  of  their  labor  force.    With  proper  complementary \nmachinery,  greater  labor  productivity  gains  (and  wages)  explain  in  part  the  recent  success  of  SMEs  in  exports.  More  productive \nemployment  stands  to  be  more  than  1  million  jobs-year,  which  would  absorb  part  of  the  new  job  seekers  entering  the  manufacturing \nlabor market each year in Indonesia (about 250,000 a year).  Finally, in terms of exports, SMEEDP is expected to generate about $1.5 \nbillion over the different stages of the project.

exporters  taken  from  the \nquestionnaires  submitted  by  the  participating  banks  to  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Export  Development  Project  (SMEEDP) \nReformulation  Mission  team.  The  exporters  are  all  interested  to  become  small  and  medium  exporters\u2019  investment  facility  (SEIF)  sub-\nborrowers  in  their  respective  banks.  Complete  project  proposals  for  SEIF  subloans  from  these  and  other  SME  exporters  will  be \nappraised  in  accordance  with  agreed  upon  subloan  regulations  for  the  SEIF  by  the  participating  banks  and  the  technical  assistnce \nmonitoring unit (TAMU), when the Government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have signed a loan agreement for the SEIF.  \n \n2. \n \n\nAssumptions in calculating the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) are based on the following assumptions: \n\n(i). \n\n(ii). \n\n(iii). \n\n(iv). \n\nThe  economic  life  of  each  subproject  is  6  years  due  to  the  fact  that  most  capital  investments  are  for  machinery, \nequipment, and vehicles,  \nInvestments will be completed during the first year; i.e., construction works and installation of machinery and equipment \nincluding trial runs, \nSeveral  SME  investments  are  small  compared  with  the  earning  capacity  of  the  SMEs  that  submitted  the  project \nproposals. This has lead to high FIRR for these project proposals.

He  has  established  business \nlinkages with around 200 smaller companies, which are subcontracted to supply \nsemi-finished and finished furniture to the company. The demand for its products \nhas been stable and increasing during the last 3 years. The company procures \n30%  of  its  total  sales  volume  from  subcontractors.  It  is  facing  competition  from \nsimilar firms in Indonesia, Viet Nam and People\u2019s Republic of China. The owner \nis  able  to  compete  by  focusing  on  attractive  design  combined  with  artwork \ncarvings. The new investment cost will cover the cost of a combined factory and \nstorage  building  equipped  with  new  production  machinery  and  equipment \nimported from Italy; Taipei,China; and Germany.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENT EXAMINATION  \n\nfriendly \n\nIntroduction \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nThe  Government  of  Indonesia,  through  its  Ministry  of  Environment  (MOE),  is  unable  to \nmonitor  and  control      pollution  and  waste  caused  by  the  large  number  of  small  and  mediun \nenterprises  (SMEs)  in  Indonesia.  MOE  issues  environmental  regulations  and  determines  the \nenvironmental parameter values for various types of pollutants and industrial waste.  Government \nemployees  assigned  to  MOE  and  the  district  administration  units  (Bapedalda)  are  charged  with \nmonitoring  all  types  of  business  enterprises,  including  SMEs  to  see  that  they  comply  with  the \nenvironmental  regulations.  Government  control  of  pollution  caused  by  small  enterprises  is  very \nweak. Medium-sized enterprises are more frequently controlled, but there is little real pressure from \nthe Government staff to force SMEs to comply with the environmental regulations and parameters \n(chemical oxygen demand and biochemical oxygen demand limits). The main pressure forcing SMEs to \nreduce  pollution  and  waste  comes  from  neighbors  and  customers  of  the  SMEs.    Many  SME \nexporters  have  undertaken  environmentally \ninvestments  based  on  demand  and \nrecommendations from their foreign customers. \n \n2. \nThe  development  challenge  for  Indonesia  is  to  help  SMEs  improve  their  environmental \nperformance  by  reducing  pollution,  conserving  resources,  and  providing  a  healthy  working \nenvironment to enable SMEs to meet environmental management standards for maintaining and/or \npromoting  their  exports.  Overall,  the  Project  will  have  a  beneficial  environmental  impact  through \nthe  replacement  of  obsolete  technology  by  new,  cleaner,  and  more  environment-friendly \ntechnology. Not only will cleaner production practices reduce environmental problems but they can \nhelp boost access to international markets by small Indonesian exporters who do not always meet \ninternational quality standards.  \n \n3. \nUnder  the  proposed  Project,  the  Government  and  BEI  will  ensure  that  all  subprojects \ncomply  with  the  applicable  government  environmental  standards,  requirements,  and  ADB's \npolicies,  and  that  appropriate  safeguards  and  mechanisms  for  compliance  are  built  into  each \nsubproject, as necessary. While environmental screening of all proposed investments is necessary, \nthe initial environmental examination or environmental impact assessment will be carried out when \nwarranted. \n \nB. \n \n4. \nsmall and medium exporters\u2019 investment facility (SEIF): \n \n\nThree  main  types  of  environmental  investments  can  be  undertaken  by  SMEs  under  the \n\nDescription of Project and Environment \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\ninvestments  in  production  facilities  aiming  at  substantial  pollution  reduction  and/or \nnatural  resource  savings  by  financing  of  more  efficient  and  cleaner  production \nequipment/process technologies;  \ninvestments in machinery and equipment to be used by the SME to recycle, reuse, \nand recover (3 R) waste materials and waste products; and \ninvestment  in  waste  treatment  plants  and  equipment  to  reduce  and  neutralize \nindustrial waste and pollution after the production process (end-of-pipe solutions).     \n\n \n5. \nBank Ekspor Indonesia (BEI) and the other commercial banks that participate in the SEIF \nwill  make  use  of  available  technical  assistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB), \nKreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (KfW),  and  other  agencies  during  the  subproject  implementation \nperiod to pay attention to the following development issues (paras. 6-9), and potential impacts and \nmitigation strategies (paras. 10-11). \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n55 \n\n2. \n\n1. \n\nInternational  Organization \n\nEnvironmental Standards: A Long-Term Need of SME Exporters \n\nAdoption of Cleaner Production by SMEs: Need for Government Action \n\n \n \n \n6. \nExport restrictions for environmental protection are not included under the trade provision in \ninternational  trading.  However,  requiring  imports  to  meet  the  national  environment  and  health \nsafety  is  clearly  permitted  under  the  current  multilateral  trade  rules.  Therefore,  under  these \ncircumstances,  it  is  very  likely  that  emerging  environmental  labeling  programs  will  affect \nIndonesia\u2019s  exports  to  the  countries  where  the  public  environmental  awareness  has  reflected  on \nthe  consumer  environmental  preference.  The  adoption  of \nfor \nStandardization  (ISO)  14001  on  Environmental  Management  System  in  1996  can  facilitate  parity \nand  mutual  recognition  among  ISO  members  including  Indonesia.  The  certification  procedure  for \neither ISO 14001 or another ecolabeling scheme requires the assessment of the whole life cycle of \nproducts. For example, in wood products (e.g., pulp and paper, furniture), sound management of \nthe  sources  of  the  wood  has  become  an  important  factor  for  certification.  Similarly,  for  other \nproducts such as garments, sound production processes of raw materials have also turned out to \nbe  one  of  the  important  factors  for  granting  an  ecolabel.  Therefore,  without  improving  SMEs\u2019 \nproduction  processes,  SME  exporters  will  have  difficulties  in  expanding  or  maintaining  their \nmarkets. At present, only 35 of 600 furniture exporters that belong to the Association of Furniture \nand  Handicraft  Producers  have  received  the  chain  of  custody  certificate  required  by  buyers  of \nfurniture and wood products from European countries and the United States.  \n \n \n \n7. \nAs  large  industries  struggle  to  survive  the  economic  crisis,  SMEs  continue  to  play  an \nimportant  role  in  the  country's  economy.  Increasing  production  of  SMEs  in  manufacturing  may \nresult  in  significant  environmental  costs.  Although  the  problems  have  been  regularly  reported  in \nlocal newspapers, there is no systematic monitoring ofn environmental problems, and of the health \nand  safety  of  SME  activities.  The  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Trade  (MOlT)  reports  that  pollution \nassociated  with  SME  activities,  particularly  in  the  manufacturing  sector,  has  created  serious \nenvironmental problems. In Klaten, Central Java, where SME activities involving electroplating are \nconcentrated,  groundwater  is  no  longer  fit  for  domestic  consumption  due  to  its  high  level  of \nchemical  contamination.  In  Sidoardjo,  East  Java,  MOlT  reports  that  workers  in  SMEs  and  the \npopulation  near  the  SMEs'  areas  of  activities  are  beginning  to  suffer  from  serious  skin  and \nrespiratory problems caused by industrial pollution. \n \n8. \nThe  Government\u2019s  current  policies  to  address  environmental  management  concerns \nassociated with industrial activity have not been designed in favor of SMEs\u2019 activities. For example, \nin  dealing  with  pollution,  the  current  policy  focuses  on  end-of-pipe  treatment  based  on  a  set  of \neffluent  standards.  The  industries  are  required  to  treat  their  wastes  before  discharging  them  into \nthe  environment.  However,  waste  treatment  should  not  be  the  end,  but  only  the  beginning  of \nanother process outside production. For instance, wastewater treatment to meet effluent standards \nmay  generate  harmful  sludge  that  needs  to  be  burned  or  buried  and  that  as  a  result  causes  soil \ncontamination or air pollution. In addition, waste treatment through individual or common treatment \nfacilities requires significant financial resources. Therefore, the current end-of-pipe treatment policy \nis not practical for SMEs in reducing pollution. \n \n9. \nIn  finding  a  win-win  solution  to  deal  with  environmental  problems,  including  pollution  from \nSMEs\u2019  activities,  cleaner  production  (CP)  is  a  more  promising  approach,  supported  by  the \ninvestment  facility  under  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Export  Development  Project \n(SMEEDP). In general, the adoption of CP involves improving housekeeping, substituting harmful \nchemicals used in the process with less harmful or biodegradable substances, and modifying the \nprocess for effective use of raw materials and reducing byproducts including waste. Therefore, the \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\nPotential Environment Impacts and Mitigation \n\nInstitutional Monitoring: TAMU and Other External Assistance \n\nAdditional External Assistance for SMEs and Environment: CP Financing \n\nadoption  of  CP  in  SMEs\u2019  activities  will  help  them  to  increase  their  productivity,  at  the  same  time \nreducing environmental problems associated with their activities and providing a hygienic working \nenvironment. The adoption of CP practices is not new in Indonesia; however, only few SMEs have \nadopted CP practices that have proven compatible with their needs. It can directly identify where \nintervention is necessary to improve SMEs\u2019 productivity and avoid environmental problems.  \n \nC. \n \n \n \n10. \nThe  SEIF  could  cooperate  with  additional  external  financing  for  cleaner  production \ntechnologies.  The  German  Government,  through  KfW,  is  considering  a  second  environmental \ncredit program (IEPC) for Indonesian SMEs. KfW may provide a grant to finance a TA unit for this \ncredit  program  to  work  closely  with  the  proposed  Technical  Assistance  Monitoring  Unit  (TAMU). \nThe soft loan will be channeled as rupiah-denominated subloans to SMEs by selected participating \nbanks.  It  is  proposed  to  KfW  that  BEI  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  implement  this  credit \nprogram in line with tasks and responsibilities of each party similar to what is envisaged under the \nproposed SMEEDP.  An  eligible  SME  could  apply  for  subloans  from  both  the  SEIF  under  the \nSMEEDP and KfW\u2019s IEPC.   \n \n \n \n11. \nADB has TAs focused on improving SME productivity, such as the ongoing TA for Business \nDevelopment  Services  (TA-3829),  and  which  will  coordinate  with  TAMU  under  the  proposed \nSMEEDP (see terms of reference for TAMU in Appendix 4). It is expected that the implementation \nof  the  TA  on  CP  by  ADB  will  also  assist  the  Government  in  addressing  environmental  problems \nassociated with SME development through CP strategy and practices.1 The latter TA will develop \nmodels  on  the  adoption  of  CP  practices  for  selected  types  of  SMEs  products;  disseminate  the \ntested  models  among  relevant  SME  associations,  and  develop  links  with  other  information  and \ntraining  centers;  and  improve  SMEs'  access  to  environmental  certification  agencies.  Also,  it  is \nexpected  that  the  environmental  TA  by  ADB  will  support  efforts  by  other  international  agencies, \nworking  to  improve  standards  of  SME  production.  These  include  (i)  Swisscontact  for  improving \nelectroplating techniques in SMEs; (ii) Japan International Cooperation Agency, for improving the \ndesign and quality of SME products, particularly wood, rattan, brick, tofu, and fermented soybean; \n(iii) Government of Italy, for improving quality and design of leather, rubber, and plastic products; \n(iv) Government of Norway, for handling wastewater from leather production; and (v) World Bank \nthrough  its  Western  Java  and  Jakarta  Environmental  Management  Program,  for  handling  wastes \nfrom textile and batik productions, and training to introduce CP.  \n \nD. \n \n12. \nPart  of  the  negative  impact  comes  from  the  activity  of  SMEs  in  the  electroplating  and \ncasting  industries,  which  are  highly  polluting,  as  their  wastes  are  categorized  as  hazardous  and \ntoxic.  The  implementation  of  CP  techniques  (e.g.,  improving  housekeeping,  and  recycling  and \nreusing  chemicals)  in  electroplating  and  casting  will  help  to  demonstrate  waste  reduction,  and \nbenefits to other SMEs in adopting CP. However, based on the analysis of the sector (Appendix 8), \nexports from industries with extensive use of electroplating and with many SMEs are not the norm. \nMetal exports with high SME presence are copper and tin products, and silver, gold and jewelry. In \n\nFindings and Recommendations  \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2002.  Technical  Assistance  to  Indonesia  for  Improving  the  Environmental  Performance  of  Small  and  Medium \n\nEnterprises by Promoting Cleaner Production. Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n57 \n\n2000, both activities represented 3.4% of all Indonesian exports, but only a fraction of them came \nfrom  SMEs  (Table  1,  Appendix  8).  Therefore,  few  of  these  are  SME  exporters  that  may  be \nprospective  applicants  to  the  SEIF  under  the  proposed  SMEEDP.  Prospective  SEIF  subprojects \nneed to pay attention to their potential environmental impact and concerns. \n \n\n1. \n\nPotential Environmental Impact of Subprojects \n\n \n13. \nA closer examination of the potential investments in subprojects in Appendix 7 (Indicative \nPipeline)  shows  that  there  are  no  SMEs  exporting  metal  products  (or  products  with  substantial \nelectroplating  content).  Most  subprojects  involve  investments  in  newer  and  cleaner  technologies \navailable  for  fish  processing  (such  as  cold  storage  units)  and  furniture  making  (such  as  wood \ndriers).  For  example,  one  SME  in  the  crispy  fish  chip  industry  produces  about  6  TM/month  and \nemploys  four  workers,  the  adoption  of  CP,  together  with  new  equipment,  as  proposed  under  the \ncredit, would increase a total saving of about $1500 with an additional investment in CP techniques \nof about $1000. This saving would result from improving the cutting and steaming process as well \nas  reducing  wasted  raw  materials.    The  benefits  of  using  a  newer  cutter  and  steamer  would  be \nmuch  larger.  Another  example  comes  from  export-oriented  batik  garments.  One  SME  produces \n130,000  pieces  per  year  and  employs  30  daily  workers;  the  adoption  of  CP  techniques  through \nimproving  of  its  housekeeping,  particularly  in  washing  and  dyeing  processes,  would  result  in \nsavings of about $8,000 per year due to reduced water and chemical consumption as well as fewer \nrejected products. Investment in new washers and driers will reinforce these benefits. \n \n14. \nDespite these good examples, there is a whole range of environmental issues that need to \nbe  observed  and  addressed  during  the  operational  period  after  the  investments  are  completed. \nSome  of  the  issues  are  linked  to  cleaner  production,  i.e.  water  and  energy  savings,  better \nhousekeeping, effective use of raw materials with less waste, substitution of harmful chemicals with \nless harmful or biodegradeable substances, etc. Other issues are related to reuse, recycling, and \nrecovery  of  waste  products  and  chemicals  used  in  the  production  process  and  finally  waste \ntreatment in waste treatment plants, incinerators and dumpsites. SME owners need to be trained \nand  informed  on  environmental  management  and  production.  TAMU  will  cooperate  with \nenvironmental experts and environmental agencies to promote environmentally friendly production \nprocesses  and  compliance  by  the  SME  sub-borrowers  with  environmental  regulations  and \nproduction standards.   \n \n\n2. \n\nPotential Environmental Concerns of Construction and Location \n\n \nConstruction work tend to disturb the environment when the SME sites are in the middle of \n15. \nother  types  of  buildings  and  human  activities.  as  is  often  the  case  in  Indonesia.  Planned \nconstruction work is relatively \u201clight\u201d for most of the SMEs that were contacted during the survey. \nThere  is  very  little  if  no  need  to  use  explosives  or  other  dangerous  work  procedures  during  site \npreparation  and  construction  work  for  the  planned  buildings  and  infrastructure  facilities.  Use  of \nheavy construction equipment is also very limited for most of the planned investments. \n \n16.  Most SEIF subloans will be granted to existing SMEs, which plan to expand their production \ncapacity.    Such  SMEs  are  located  on  suitable  or  less  suitable  sites,  and  the  enterprises  are  not \nplanning  to  relocate  their  production  and  business  operations.    Poor  or  insufficient  infrastructure \n(road conditions, water and electricity supply) is a common problem faced by SMEs in Indonesia.  \nRapid  urban  development  combined  with  poor  town  planning  has  caused  big  problems  for  many \nSMEs, which started their operations several years ago on sites \u201cfar\u201d from other buildings in open \nland.  During  relative  short  periods  their  locations  have  changed  and  they  become  \u201cmiddle  of  the \ntown locations\u201d close to housing estates, schools, and marketplaces.  Banks and SME owners are \naware  of  the  poor  infrastructure  and  urban  development  problems,  but  they  can  do  very  little  on \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\ntheir own to solve these problems. The SMEs will gradually be forced to undertake environmental \ninvestments  forced  upon  them  by  the  environment  with  municipal  authorities  as  their  partners. \nSeveral of the SMEs surveyed are located in industrial estates equipped with wastewater treatment \nplants.  The  estate  operator  has  contracted  firms  that  collect  the  solid  waste  from  each  of  the \ntenants regularly. \n \nE. \n\nConclusions \n\n \n17. \nNegative  pollution  impact  of  subprojects  under  the  SMEEDP  is  unlikely,  given  the  size  of \nsubprojects  and  the  type  of  industrial  activities.  A  positive  impact  of  the  subprojects  should  be \nemphasized,  since  the  SMEEDP  encourages  the  adoption  of  CP  technologies.  The  Project  will \nalso benefit from external assistance to foster the use of CP. The proposed SMEEDP would have, \nat  worst,  a  neutral  net  impact  upon  the  environment.  Based  on  this  initial  examination,  it  is \nrecommended to adopt Category B for the above project. \n \n18. \nUnder  the  SMEEDP,  TAMU  will  ensure  that  all  subprojects  observe  ADB\u2019s  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s  necessary  environmental  safeguards.  It  will  also  require  close  monitoring  of \nsubprojects  in  high-risk  industries  (electroplating  and  tanneries)  or  areas.  The  monitoring  will  be \ndone on a case-by-case basis. TAMU will discuss the environmental issues with management staff \nof  BEI  and  the  participating  banks  (PBs)  and  issue  recommendations  regarding  environmental \nmatters  that  need  to  be  observed  by  the  lenders  and  the  sub-borrowers  in  cooperation  with \nenvironmental  experts  and  MoE  staff.  TAMU,  in  coordination  with  other  external  assistance,  will \npromote CP.  \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of  25 November 2002) \n", "Currency Unit \nRp1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "rupiah (Rp) \n$0.000111 \nRp9,009 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "financial internal rate of return \ninput-output \nIndustrial Competitiveness and Small and Medium Enterprise Development \nIndustrial Efficiency and Pollution Control Project \nIndonesia Export Training Center \nInternational Finance Corporation \nInternational Organization for Standardization \n", "\u2013  Asian Development Bank \n\u2013  business development services \n\u2013  PT Bank Ekspor Indonesia (Persero) \n\u2013  Bank Indonesia \n\u2013  Bank Negara Indonesia \n\u2013  Bank Rakyat Indonesia \n\u2013  capital adequacy ratio \n\u2013  cleaner production \n\u2013  development finance loan \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Japan Bank for International Cooperation \n\u2013  Japan International Cooperation Agency \n\u2013  Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (German Development Corporation) \nletter of credit \n\u2013 \nloan-to-deposit ratio \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nlegal lending limit \n\u2013  Mid-Term Action Plan \n\u2013  Ministry of Finance \n\u2013  Ministry of Industry and Trade \n\u2013  net open position \n\u2013  nonperforming loan \n\u2013  participating bank \n", " \nADB \nBDS \nBEI \nBI \nBNI \nBRI \nCAR \nCP \nDFL \nFIRR \nI/O \nICSMED \nIEPC \nIETC \nIFC \nISO \nJBIC \nJICA \nKfW \nLC \nLDR \nLLL \nMTAP \nMOF \nMOIT \nNOP \nNPL \nPB \nPROPENAS  \u2013  Medium-Term Development Strategy \nROA \nreturn on assets \nSEIF \nSMEs \nSMEEDP \nTA \n \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013  Small and Medium Exporters\u2019 Investment Facility \n\u2013  small and medium enterprises \n\u2013  Small and Medium Enterprise Export Development Project \n\u2013 \n", "technical assistance \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year of the Government ends on 31 December. \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "This report was prepared by a team consisting of E.
