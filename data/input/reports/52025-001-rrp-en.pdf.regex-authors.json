THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Yunnan Sayu River Basin Rural Water Pollution \nManagement  and  Eco-Compensation  Demonstration  Project.1 The  project  will  improve  the \ncondition of water resources and the environment by (i) strengthening wastewater management \nand  pollution  control  with  innovative  technologies  and  arrangements;  (ii)  improving  water \nresources  management  with  innovative  information  technologies;  (iii)  establishing  eco-\ncompensation mechanisms; and (iv) strengthening education, capacity, and public awareness for \nwater pollution management. The project is envisaged to (i) play a demonstrative role for rural \nareas with water pollution; (ii) promote regional public goods by reversing the negative impacts of \npollution;  and  (iii)  reduce  the risk of  future epidemics,  which is  strongly  required  after the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n2.  The  Yangtze  River  Economic  Belt  (YREB)  covers  nine  provinces  and two specially \nadministered cities in the Yangtze River Basin. It accounts for more than 40% of the PRC\u2019s \npopulation and has 40% of the freshwater resources. It also serves as the drinking water source \nfor 400 million people, provides 60% of the total fisheries production, has 20% of the total wetland \narea, and contributes about 45% of the PRC\u2019s economic output. The YREB has been earmarked \nas one of three key growth engines to ensure the PRC\u2019s future economic development.2 \n3.  The YREB has benefited from extensive development since the 1990s. Yet, economic \ngrowth in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River Basin is lagging and below its \npotential capacity. The middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River Basin still face significant \ndevelopment challenges because of (i) slow transformation for green development and economic \ndiversification; (ii) limited integration of waterways, ports, and intermodal logistics; (iii) increasing \npollution and pressure on natural resources; and (iv) weak institutional coordination for strategic \nplanning.3 The YREB faces a growing  imbalance between  economic achievements  and the \nquality of the environment. For example, since 1980, water pollution in the Yangtze River Basin \nhas risen by 73% because of the discharge of waste;4 soil erosion,  which is critical in small \nwatersheds;5 and agriculture-related nonpoint source (NPS) pollution. \n4.  To  address  these  challenges,  the  Government  of  the  PRC  formulated  the  YREB \nDevelopment Plan, 2016\u20132030,6 which stipulates the prioritization of ecological protection and \nthe promotion  of green development  as the guiding principle for the YREB development.7 In \n \n1  Eco-compensation  is a payment and incentive system that supports  sustainable  ecosystems, provides stable \nfinancing for conservation, and\u2014when strategically designed\u2014can address livelihood issues for the rural poor. \n2  The other flagship projects are the Belt and Road Initiative and the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei  Integrated  Regional \nDevelopment Strategy. \n3  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2016. Yangtze River Economic Belt Environmental Protection and Rehabilitation \nProject\u2014A Preliminary Study. Consultant\u2019s report. Manila (TA 9044-PRC). \n4  The upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River Basin account for 80% of the YREB\u2019s wastewater discharge, \nand the tributaries have the worst water quality in the basin. Among the rural villages in the YREB, about 40% do not \nhave garbage collection facilities and about 80% lack basic sewage treatment. \n5  Every year, the Yangtze River Basin loses 2.24 billion tons of soil, damaging 67,000 hectares of farmland because \nof soil erosion. \n6  Government of the PRC. 2016. Outline of the Yangtze River Economic Belt Development Plan, 2016\u20132030. Beijing. \n7  Green development aims to (i) change the traditional development model to a sustainable  development model, \n(ii) address the challenges of rapid urbanization, and (iii) serve as a guide to socioeconomic development. \n ", "2 \nrelation to this, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the government  agreed to adopt a \nframework approach, providing about $2.0 billion of funding in the YREB during 2018\u20132020 to \nstrategically program ADB\u2019s lending support for development initiatives in the YREB, prioritizing \nthe following four areas: (i) ecosystem restoration, environmental protection, and water resources \nmanagement; (ii) green and inclusive industrial transformation; (iii) construction of an integrated \nmultimodal transport corridor; and (iv) institutional strengthening and policy reform. \n5.  Zhaotong City of Yunnan Province has been selected to demonstrate water pollution \nreduction in the Sayu River Basin. Zhaotong has one district, one county-level city, and nine \ncounties, of which the district and all counties are nationally designated poverty areas. Zhaotong \nhas 1,336,700 poor people\u2014the largest poor population in Yunnan (as of 2016). The Sayu River \nis a 186-kilometer long tertiary tributary of the Yangtze River. The Sayu River Basin, covering \n3,558 square kilometers, is an important area for ecological protection in the upper Yangtze River \nBasin. It is the only centralized  drinking water source in Zhaotong.  Urban drinking water is \nprimarily provided  from the Yudong Reservoir. The entire Yudong Reservoir Basin is part of \nLudian County and Zhaoyang District in Zhaotong. Water in the Sayu River Basin, including the \nYudong Reservoir, is polluted because of (i) waste discharging in the Sayu River Basin, (ii) high \nsediment runoff into the Sayu River because of soil erosion, and (iii) agriculture-related  NPS \npollution. In many locations of the Sayu River, the water quality is worse than the Class III national \nstandard, which is unfit for drinking.8 Local people living around the Sayu River Basin, particularly \nwomen and the poor, suffer from water pollution. Poor water quality also increases the time spent \nby women seeking clean water for their families. \n6.  Rural domestic wastewater, solid waste, and human and animal wastes pollute the water \nin the Sayu River Basin because of inadequate waste management. Rural domestic wastewater \nand solid waste contribute 27% of the chemical oxygen demand (COD), 9% of the total nitrogen, \n16% of the total phosphorus, and 22% of the ammoniacal nitrogen (NH -N) in the Sayu River.9 \n3\nHuman and animal wastes contribute 39% of the COD, 25% of the total nitrogen, 52% of the total \nphosphorus, and 48% of the NH -N in the Sayu River (footnote 9). Since forest coverage in the \n3\nSayu River Basin is only 30.2% because of the expansion  of farmland, which is significantly \nsmaller than the 60%\u221270% appropriate for centralized drinking water sources, soil erosion is quite \nserious in this basin. About 57.9% of the Sayu River Basin is prone to soil erosion, providing \n1.1 million tons of soil per year. High sediment runoff caused by soil erosion contributes 34% of \nthe COD, 21% of the total nitrogen, 11% of the total phosphorus, and 18% of the NH -N in the \n3\nSayu River (footnote 9). Water in the Sayu River Basin is further deteriorated by agriculture-\nrelated NPS pollution because of inadequate waste management systems, uncontrolled fertilizer \nrelease, and outdated production systems. Agriculture-related NPS pollution (e.g., farmland solid \nwaste and fertilizer) contributes 45% of the total nitrogen, 21% of the total phosphorus, and 12% \nof the NH -N in the Sayu River (footnote 9). It also contributes to climate change through direct \n3\nand indirect emission of greenhouse gases. This situation may be aggravated by intensified and \nmore frequent rainfall events induced by global climatic changes, which contribute to soil erosion \nand agriculture-related pollution to water systems. \n \n \n \n8  Following the PRC\u2019s Environmental Water Quality Standard (GB 3838-2002). \n9  Zhaotong City Government. 2015. Zhaotong Yudong Reservoir Water Resources Protection Special Remediation \nPlan, 2015\u20132020. Zhaotong. In 2013, the Sayu River had 14,345.51 tons of the COD, 75,655 tons of total nitrogen, \n3,818.98 tons of total phosphorus, and 185.12 tons of the NH3-N.  \n ", "3 \n7.  Capacity is lacking for holistic planning, financing, and implementing of water pollution \nreduction activities.10 Public awareness of water pollution problems,  particularly interlinkages \nbetween household and economic activities and water quality, is also insufficient. As Zhaotong is \nconsidered a poor city, it urgently needs a sustainable financing mechanism for investments to \naddress water pollution sustainably. \n \n8.  In  2006,  the  Zhaotong  City  Government  (ZCG)  established  a  fund  for  ecological \nrestoration and remediation of water source protection areas of the Yudong Reservoir. The ZCG \nprovided CNY3 million to the fund every year from 2006 to 2014. Since 2015, the fund has \nreceived CNY17 million annually.11 Deficiencies of this fund include the small contribution from \nbeneficiaries\u2014only  CNY2  million  out  of  CNY17  million  annually  (footnote  11);  and  lack of \noperational  procedures  of a committee managing the fund, including criteria for screening of \nactivities proposed for financing from the fund. The ZCG would like to upgrade the fund to a new \neco-compensation  fund,  incorporating  international  good  practices  for sustainable  financing \nmechanisms. In 2018, the ZCG established a district- and county-level horizontal (i.e., between \nthe  same  levels  of  local  government)  eco-compensation  mechanism,  which  consists  of \n14 horizontal  eco-compensation  agreements  for  17  river  sections  crossing  the  borders  of \nZhaotong\u2019s one district, one county-level city, and nine counties.12 However, these agreements \nhave not yet been implemented because of lack of water quality monitoring facilities.  \n9.  In February 2018, the State Council of the PRC promulgated a policy on rural vitalization \nas a driver for the PRC\u2019s modernization goals and for building a moderately prosperous society. \nThe policy targets establishing an institutional framework by 2020, modernizing rural areas by \n2035, and beautifying  the countryside  by 2050.  Local  governments  will formulate  and start \nimplementing  their plans,  aimed  at improving  public  services  and promoting  environmental \nprotection, during 2018\u20132022. Yunnan  Province, particularly Zhaotong, will be a government \npriority for this policy implementation.13 \n10.  COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the effects of interlinkages \nbetween biodiversity, public health, and ecosystem-dependent global supply chains. COVID-19 \nis being contained in the PRC, but it remains a risk. With COVID-19 as a trigger, the need for \nmeasures to prevent the spread of future infectious diseases is attracting attention. \n11.  Strategic  fit.  The  project  aims  to  demonstrate  water  pollution  management  in  the \nSayu River Basin. This will contribute to the PRC\u2019s goal of building a harmonious and prosperous \nsociety  through  environmentally  sustainable  growth;  and  is  consistent  with  (i)  the  PRC\u2019s \n \n10 An example is the \u201criver chief\u201d system. The \u201criver chief\u201d system was introduced in the PRC in 2017. It assigns each \npart of a river and lake to a certain official. Currently, river chiefs have difficulties collecting the data and information \nnecessary for river management. \n11 This  comprises  CNY8 million  from the  ZCG, CNY5 million  from the  Zhaoyang  District  Government (ZDG), \nCNY2 million from the Ludian County Government (LCG), and CNY2 million of water resources utilization fees from \na downstream hydropower station every year. Zhaoyang District and Ludian County are in Zhaotong City, and the \nLCG and the ZDG are the project implementing agencies (Table 3). \n12 Each agreement is for one to three river sections crossing the border. Compensation is paid based on the water \nquality at the border. Of the 14 agreements, one is for the Longshu River in the Sayu River Basin and two other rivers \noutside the Sayu River Basin, signed by the LCG and the ZDG. Each of them provides CNY2.0 million per year; \nCNY2.4 million is allocated  to the upstream LCG and CNY1.6 million to the downstream ZDG. At the border of \nZhaoyang District and Ludian County, the water quality of the Longshu River and two other rivers in the Sayu River \nBasin is measured monthly (36 sets of monitoring data/year). Every year, CNY2.4 million multiplied by the ratio of \nmonitoring data number which did not meet the standard agreed between the LCG and the ZDG is deducted from \nthe LCG and added to the ZDG.  \n13 State Council of the PRC. 2018.

The project will have the following \noutcome: condition of water resources and environment in the Sayu River Basin improved.19 \n13.  Output 1: Wastewater management and pollution control in the Sayu River Basin \nstrengthened. This includes (i) the development  of waste management systems, particularly \ndistributed systems, which have advantages over the traditional centralized system (e.g., lower \noperational cost); (ii) the development of solid waste management systems, including garbage \npyrolysis facilities,  with capacity and institutional development  for garbage classification  and \ncollection; (iii) the development of pilot eco-villages to reduce emissions through environmental \nprotection activities, education, and publicity; (iv) wetland construction to reduce NPS pollution, \nintroducing  new  types  of  artificial  wetlands  combined  with  wastewater  treatment  facilities; \n(v) afforestation  and the establishment of a quantifiable soil and water conservation  model to \nestimate afforestation\u2019s effects on soil and water conservation based on tree species, planting \ndensity, age of trees, and slope degrees; and (vi) the promotion of low-emission agriculture with \ninnovative technologies (ecological drainage ditches, gridded surface source pollution monitoring \nplatforms,  and  measures  to  estimate  at  least  necessary  fertilizer  volume)  and  incentives \n(establishing green and organic crop brands). The project will conduct baseline and \u201cendline\u201d \nsurveys to compare the amount of time women spend on waste and solid waste management \nbefore and after the project.20 \n14.  Output 2: Water resources management in the Sayu River improved. This includes \n(i) the establishment of a smart water integrated management platform by constructing monitoring \nfacilities and integrating them with the existing irrigation area information system for real-time \nmonitoring and actions in the event of water quality deterioration; and (ii) the establishment of a \nriver protection model that links the existing river chief system in the PRC, a real-time water quality \nmonitoring  system  (a subsystem  of the  smart water  integrated  management  platform),  and \nfacilities to protect rivers from pollution (e.g., ecological embankments). \n15.

For the implementation of the horizontal eco-compensation agreement and new town- and \ntownship-level  horizontal  eco-compensation  mechanisms,  water  quality  monitoring  will  be \nconducted to judge whether water quality targets set in the agreements were achieved, which will \nbe the basis for compensation. \n17.  While  the  horizontal  eco-compensation  agreements  incentivize  good  upper  basin \nmanagement and cost-sharing between upstream and downstream governments, (i) they lack the \ninvolvement  of ecosystem  services  providers and beneficiaries  and  value flow between  the \necosystem  service  providers  and beneficiaries;  and (ii)  compensation  amounts  to upstream \ngovernments are small and insufficient for interventions needed in the upstream areas. The eco-\ncompensation  fund will make up for these shortcomings of the horizontal eco-compensation \nagreements. It will be established by improving the fund for ecological restoration and remediation \nof water source protection areas of the Yudong Reservoir (para. 8). The eco-compensation fund \nwill provide grants to relevant government agencies and private companies,21 for (i) activities \nunder Output 1, including wastewater management, solid waste management, pilot eco-villages, \noperation and maintenance (O&M) of the constructed wetlands, compensation for the farmland-\nto-forest conversion, and promotion of low-emission agriculture; (ii) the operation of the river \nprotection model established under Output 2; (iii) the implementation of the seven horizontal eco-\ncompensation  agreements  under  Output  3  (para.  15);  and  (iv)  management  of  the  eco-\ncompensation fund, excluding any civil works. The fund will be initially supported by the ZCG, \nLCG, ZDG, ADB, and a beneficiary,22 with the longer-term goal of collecting more funding from \nbeneficiaries,23 to improve the sustainability of the fund and strengthen the direct linkage between \nupstream eco-service providers and downstream beneficiaries, following the principle that those \nwho benefit should compensate. Assurances are included in the project agreement to ensure and \nincrease  contributions  to the fund, particularly from beneficiaries. An eco-compensation  fund \nmanagement committee (EFMC), of which women will comprise at least 35%, will be established \nin the ZCG.24 The EFMC will conduct screening of activities proposed for financing from the eco-\ncompensation fund, following an environmental and social management system (ESMS, paras. \n38\u221240). The Yudong Reservoir Water Resources Protection Committee Office (YWPCO) in the \nZCG will open and manage an account for the eco-compensation fund; and manage the fund, \nfollowing the decisions of the EFMC.25   \n18.  Output  4:  Education,  capacity,  and  public  awareness  for  water  pollution \nmanagement strengthened. This includes (i) capacity development of government staff on rural \n \n21 Private companies will operate a wastewater treatment plant or conduct solid waste management based on contracts \nwith the ZDG or the LCG. \n22 From  2023,  annual  contributions  to  the  eco-compensation  fund  will  be  as  follows:  ZCG,  CNY8  million; \nZDG, CNY5 million;  and LCG, CNY2 million.  Some CNY2 million of water resources utilization  fees from the \ndownstream Baoho hydropower station  will be contributed to the fund every year from 2023. An ADB loan of \n$5 million will be contributed to the fund during the project. \n23 Beneficiaries will include downstream water and hydropower users, irrigation water users, and the business sector. \n24 The chair of the EFMC will be the vice mayor of the ZCG; and the members will be the deputy directors general of \nabout 10 ZCG agencies, including the Zhaotong City Development and Reform Committee, the Zhaotong City \nFinance Bureau, and the Zhaotong City Environment and Ecology Bureau. \n25 About 15 full-time staff of the YWPCO, which manages the fund for ecological restoration and remediation (para. 8), \nwill manage the new eco-compensation fund. \n ", "6 \nwater pollution management and eco-compensation; (ii) the education of students in rural water \npollution  management  and  eco-compensation;  (iii)  public  awareness  raising;  and  (iv) the \ndissemination and replication of project initiatives, with at least 40% participation by women. \n19.  Lessons. The project design has incorporated lessons from international practices and \nprevious ADB-financed projects and studies on the IWRM and environmental and ecosystem \nimprovement,  such  as  the  importance  of  (i)  implementation  arrangements  for  funds,26 (ii) \npromoting the IWRM at river basin scale by prioritizing upstream\u2013downstream  and urban\u2013rural \nlinkages, (iii) promoting nature-based solutions, (iv) strengthening nonstructural measures, (v) \nsupporting  institutional  reforms  that  contribute  to sustainable  IWRM,  (vi) providing  capacity \ndevelopment  for  project  implementation  and  the  O&M,  and  (vii)  establishing  an  effective \nmonitoring and evaluation system for project performance. \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n20.  The  project  has  added  value  through  integrated  water  pollution  management,  with \ninnovations, including (i) distributed wastewater management systems with innovative information \ntechnology for operation and management, operated at low cost; (ii) animal feces collection tanks \nusing a new material; (iii) garbage pyrolysis facilities with a shorter processing cycle, smaller floor \nspace,  and  maximum  volume  reduction;  (iv) pilot  eco-villages  to  demonstrate  integrated \nemissions  management;  (v)  introducing  new types  of  artificial  wetlands;  (vi)  establishing  a \nquantifiable  soil  and  water  conservation  model,  which  will enable  quantitative  estimates  of \nafforestation\u2019s effects on soil and water conservation; (vii) promoting low-emissions agriculture \nwith  innovative  technologies  and  incentives;  (viii) establishing  a  river  protection  model  with \ninnovative  information  technology  and  institutional  development;  and  (ix) establishing  and \nimplementing  horizontal  eco-compensation mechanisms and an eco-compensation  fund as a \nsustainable funding mechanism for water pollution management.  Experience and knowledge \ngained through the project can be replicated in other small tributaries in the upper and middle \nreaches of the Yangtze River, which account for 80% of wastewater, and in other key river basins \nin Asia and the Pacific. Consultants will assist in the replication through workshops, publications, \ndisclosure of project information on websites, submission of papers to academic associations, \nand proposing of the project as a model for eco-civilization and awards. \n21.  Response to COVID-19 pandemic. The project will contribute to the holistic development \nof the YREB by shifting traditional investments toward valuing nature and reducing inequalities in \nrural areas. This is part of the nature-positive stimulus package for recovery from the COVID-19 \npandemic which will promote a greener and healthier growth model. \n22.  Although COVID-19 is being contained in the PRC, measures to prevent the spread of \nfuture infectious diseases are strongly required for the post-COVID-19 world. The project will \nreduce the risk of future epidemics by creating a safe and healthy living environment through \nstrengthened wastewater and solid waste management and pollution control and improved quality \nof source water for water supply. \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n23.  The project is estimated to cost $234.61 million (Table 1).

Implementation Arrangements \n27.  The ZCG will be the executing agency. A project leading group has been established in \nthe  ZCG  under  which  a  project  management  office  (PMO)  has  been  established.  The \nimplementing agencies will be the YWPCO, ZDG, and LCG. In the ZDG and LCG, a local project \nleading group has been established under which a local PMO has also been established. Since \nthe ZCG, including the YWPCO, LCG, and ZDG, do not have experience with the ADB projects, \nadequate training will be provided to relevant staff, particularly for social and safeguard measures. \nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM. \nThese will not be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic (para. 23). \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  November 2020\u2013June 2026 (project completion date)  \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2026 \nEstimated loan closing date  31 December 2026 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Project leading group \nMayor, ZCG (chair) \nVice mayor, ZCG (vice chair) \nDeputy secretary, ZCG; and representatives of relevant ZCG agencies (members) \n(ii)  Executing agency  ZCG \n(iii)  Key implementing  Yudong Reservoir Water Resources Protection Committee Office, Zhaoyang \nagencies  District Government, and Ludian County Government \n(iv) Implementation unit  PMO in the ZCG, 31 staff \nLocal PMO in Zhaoyang District Government, 36 staff \nLocal PMO in Ludian County Government, 32 staff  \nProcurement  Open competitive bidding  30 contracts  $113,071,721 \n(nationally advertised) \nConsulting services  Individual consultant  9.00 person-months, 3 contracts  $84,000 \nselection \nCQS  41.00 person-months, 2 contracts  $314,000 \nQCBS  133.75 person-months, 2 contracts  $1,802,000 \nRetroactive financing and/or  Advance contracting and retroactive financing will apply to consultants.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n28.  The original project design was prepared by licensed domestic design institutes, following \nthe  PRC\u2019s guidelines  and regulations.  Recommendations  by ADB,  including  the  addition  of \ninnovative technologies and arrangements, were incorporated in the project design. The technical \nfeasibility was confirmed to be adequate after detailed examination of the project\u2019s compatibility \nwith local conditions and local capacity for the O&M. The designs of wastewater correction pipes, \nmanure collection tanks, artificial wetlands, afforestation,  irrigation facilities, drainage ditches, \necological  embankments,  the  smart  water  integrated  management  platform,  capacity \n ", "9 \ndevelopment, and education were determined considering risks that may be caused by climate \nchange, such as the increasing frequency and extent of heatwaves, floods, and droughts. \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n29.  The economic analysis for the project comprised least-cost and benefit\u2013cost analyses, an \nevaluation  of  demand,  and  a  poverty  analysis.  The  least-cost  analysis  tested  key  project \ncomponents: wastewater, animal feces, and solid waste management; wetland construction; and \necological  embankment  construction.  The  net  present  value  of  project  benefits  is \nCNY344.74 million. The economic internal rate of return is 12.2% for Output 1, which exceeds \nthe 9% threshold; and 8.1% for Output 2 (focusing on instream water quality), which exceeds the \nlower environmental threshold of 6%. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that the project \neconomic viability is sufficiently robust to several adverse scenarios. A poverty impact ratio of \n0.32 was estimated in the benefit distribution and poverty impact analysis.29 \n30.  The  financial  analysis  focused  on  the  project\u2019s  financial  sustainability.  Incremental \nrecurrent cost analyses for the ZDG and LCG, which are responsible for the O&M of the facilities \nconstructed under the project, were conducted to determine the project\u2019s financial sustainability. \nThe financial analysis confirmed the financial capacities of the two entities to cover the recurrent \ncosts of the project to sustain the facilities. The project is considered financially sustainable. \nC.  Sustainability \n31.  Adequate consulting services will be provided during project implementation for the O&M \nof the facilities constructed under the project and the institutional and capacity development for \nwater  pollution  management  and  eco-compensation.  The  eco-compensation  mechanisms, \nparticularly the eco-compensation fund, were designed to improve the sustainability of the project \nsince the fund will be utilized for the O&M of the facilities constructed under the project, reducing \nthe  fiscal  burden  on governments\u2019  budgets.  Conservative  estimates  of funding  to the eco-\ncompensation fund and planned investments from the fund confirmed the fund\u2019s sustainability.30 \nSince the governments assured that they will provide the necessary counterpart funds to establish \nthe eco-compensation fund, the risk to its financial sustainability is moderate. \nD.  Governance \n32.  The assessed  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk is moderate  because  of key \nfinancial  management  risks,  including  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies\u2019  lack  of \nexperience with the ADB projects; and inadequate coordination between relevant agencies for \neffective financial management, which will be mitigated through the financial management action \nplan described in the PAM.31 \n33.  The project procurement risk assessment confirms that the implementing agencies, which \nwill  conduct  procurement  through  a  procurement  agency  with  the  assistance  of  ADB  and \nconsultants, have adequate capacity to comply fully with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as \namended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time). Overall, the procurement risk is low after mitigation measures are considered. \n \n29 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 Cumulative contribution  to the  eco-compensation  fund until  2030: at least CNY228.0  million; and cumulative \ninvestment from the fund until 2030: CNY153.4 million. Details are in Eco-Compensation Mechanism for the Sayu \nRiver Basin (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nA market analysis confirms that an adequate number of qualified local suppliers and contractors \nhave participated successfully in similar procurements. To achieve better value for money, the \nproject will adopt open competitive bidding (nationally advertised) for all ADB-financed works and \ngoods packages. Quality- and cost-based selection (internationally advertised) will be used only \nfor two large consulting services packages for project management support and for rural water \npollution management and eco-compensation. Procurement under the eco-compensation fund \nwill be conducted based on local procurement procedures acceptable to ADB.32   \n34.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the ZCG. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n35.  Poverty and social. The project is classified general intervention for poverty reduction. A \npoverty and social analysis was undertaken based on intensive stakeholder consultations and \nsocioeconomic surveys. A total of 127,015 residents in the project area, including 59,697 women \n(47.0%) and 25,403 low-income people (20.0%), are expected to benefit directly from the project \nthrough  reduced  solid  waste  and  water  pollution,  improved  river  management,  and  better \necological services. Other residents in Zhaoyang District and Ludian County of Zhaotong will also \nbenefit indirectly from the improved environment. The project will create 1,834 jobs during project \nimplementation and 372 jobs during project operation. A social development action plan prepared \nbased on the poverty and social analysis has specific targets for poor and low-income people. \nConsultations were undertaken with local residents and other stakeholders. A consultation and \nparticipation plan for project implementation is included in the PAM.  \n36.  Gender.  The  project  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming,  following  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Gender Mainstreaming Categories of ADB Projects.33 Gender analysis indicates \nthat women are the primary caretakers of household wastewater and solid waste management, \nand initial estimates suggest that project investments will result in an important reduction in time \n(50%) spent on these tasks through improved systems. Migration is a key livelihood strategy in \nthe area, especially among the young. However, nonmigrant women expressed interested in job \nopportunities to be created by the project, which will include skilled and unskilled positions for the \nconstruction  and  operation  of  facilities.  A gender  action  plan  has  been  prepared  that  will \n(i) measure results toward gender equality, particularly time savings as a result of improved waste \nmanagement  systems for women  through  baseline  and endline  surveys;  (ii)  set targets for \nwomen\u2019s participation in decision-making and in skilled and unskilled employment; (iii) set targets \nto ensure women farmers\u2019 participation in training to facilitate their transition to low-emissions \nagriculture; and (iv) set targets for ensuring  the active  participation  of women in the EFMC \nresponsible for screening and improvement of activities proposed to be financed from the fund. \nF.  Safeguards \n37.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.34 \n38.  Environment  (category A). An environmental impact assessment has been prepared \n \n32 For activities that will be financed from the eco-compensation fund, small amounts of equipment and materials will \nbe purchased for the maintenance of facilities constructed under the project. \n33 ADB. 2012. Guidelines for Gender Mainstreaming Categories of ADB Projects. Manila. \n34 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "11 \nand disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. This includes (i) the environmental management plan (EMP), \ndraft ESMS, and a project-specific grievance redress mechanism. The EMP will be applied to all \nproject  components,  except  the  eco-compensation  fund.  For  the  eco-compensation  fund, \nenvironmental  and social safeguards  will be managed under the ESMS. The  environmental \nimpact assessment, the EMP, and the ESMS are based on the domestic feasibility study and \nenvironmental  assessment reports, site visits, and consultations with  stakeholder. The ZCG, \nthrough the PMO and the EFMC, will be responsible for compliance with the EMP and the ESMS. \nThe implementing agencies do not have experience with ADB\u2019s safeguard procedures; and so, \nthe project design includes  qualified  safeguard  staff and a training program. The project is \nexpected  to  achieve  significant  environmental  benefits,  including  (i)  improved  water  quality \nthrough a reduction of water pollution sources and protection of water resources from pollution; \n(ii) improved designs and operational procedures for garbage pyrolysis plants (environmental and \nsocial assessments and safe management of pyrolysis by-products); (iii) reduced annual silt loads \nto the Sayu River; and (iv) the promotion of environmental management in the Sayu River Basin \nthrough the ESMS. Risks include (i) environmental and/or health impacts via air emissions from \nthe garbage pyrolysis plants; (ii) improper management of leachate, slag, and/or flue ash from \nthe  garbage  pyrolysis  plants;  and  (iii)  odors  and  leachate  from  garbage  transfer  stations. \nMitigation measures and screening procedures to address these risks are included in the EMP \nand the ESMS, including measures for the safe treatment and disposal of flue ash, slag, and \nleachate; and the air and soil monitoring programs for early detection of environmental impacts. \n39.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). The land use of the project (for Outputs 1 and 2) \nwill include (i) permanent acquisition of 743.38 mu of collective land; (ii) land user right transfer of \n416.49 mu of collective land; (iii) land use for ecological farming or forestry of 25,765.59 mu; \n(iv) land use for rural public  infrastructure  of 15.40 mu; (v) state-owned  land occupation  of \n1,973.88 mu; and (vi) temporary land occupation of 4,828.06 mu. The project will not involve any \nhouse  or structure  demolition.  Permanent  land acquisition  will affect  1,257 households  with \n4,386 persons and is mainly related to widening or straightening of ecological embankments in \nsome  river sections.  Households  will  not  be physically  relocated.  A  resettlement  plan  was \nprepared, following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and relevant PRC laws and regulations. \nIt includes adequate measures for compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation. It is based on \nsurveys and consultations with affected people and will be updated through additional surveys \nand consultations  during project  implementation.  A grievance  redress  mechanism  has been \nestablished  and incorporated  into the resettlement plan. The ZCG, LCG, and ZDG have the \ncapacity to implement domestically funded projects; and the consultants  will strengthen their \ncapacity to implement the resettlement plan in compliance with ADB\u2019s requirements. An external \nmonitoring agency will be engaged to monitor the implementation of the resettlement plan and \nsubmit semiannual reports to ADB. Outputs 3 and 4 are not expected to involve involuntary land \nacquisition or resettlement impacts. The ESMS, prepared for the eco-compensation fund under \nOutput 3, includes necessary measures for screening and avoidance of land acquisition and \nresettlement impacts, including any issues from past land acquisition or existing facilities. \n40.  Indigenous peoples or ethnic minorities (category B). The Hui, Miao, and Yi ethnic \nminority groups in the project area will benefit from the project, including (i) improved wastewater \nand solid waste management; (ii) pilot development of eco-villages; (iii) job opportunities during \nconstruction  and  operation;  (iv)  livelihood  support  from  the  eco-compensation  fund;  and \n(v) capacity development. A social assessment revealed that the socioeconomic and livelihood \nsystems of the ethnic minorities are not different from those of the Han majority. However, they \nmaintain distinct cultural characteristics, such as traditional festivals and different religious beliefs. \nProject  activities,  such  as  pilot  eco-village  development  in  the  ethnic  minority  villages,  will \nconsider  such  cultural  characteristics.  An  ethnic  minority  development  plan  was  prepared, \n ", "12 \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and relevant PRC laws and regulations. It includes \nactions related to awareness raising, consultations, and the participation of ethnic minority groups; \nmonitoring and evaluation; and  strengthening  the  capacities of the ZCG,  LCG,  and ZDG to \nimplement and monitor the ethnic minority development plan. The ESMS includes measures for \nscreening and avoiding adverse impacts on ethnic minorities. \n41.  Capacity  for  social  and  safeguard  measures.  The  ZCG,  LCG,  and  ZDG  have \nexperience in implementing domestic projects; but they do not have experience with the ADB \nprojects. To implement the social and safeguard measures following ADB requirements, (i) the \nZCG, LCG, and ZDG will each appoint focal social and safeguard staff; (ii) consultants for project \nmanagement  support will include environment, resettlement, social development, and gender \nspecialists; (iii) staff of the ZCG, LCG, and ZDG will be trained on social and safeguard measures; \nand (iv) external monitoring agencies will be recruited for safeguard monitoring. \nG.
