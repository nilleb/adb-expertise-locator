The loan is to be provided under \nthe Countercyclical Support Facility of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) as a single tranche. \n   \nClassification  Targeting classification: General intervention \nSector (subsector): Public sector management (economic and public \naffairs management) \nTheme (subtheme): Economic growth (promoting macroeconomic \nstability) \nLocation impact: National (high impact) \n   \nEnvironment  Category C \nAssessment \n   \nRationale  The global crisis, which intensified after September 2008, has affected \nthe  Philippine  economy  and  social  sectors  in  four  related  respects: \n(i) the first-round effects of the global financial crisis had repercussions \nfor the domestic financial sector in the second half of 2008; (ii) the \nsecond-round effects of devastated global demand has hurt the real \neconomy, sharply lowering its growth prospects for 2009; (iii) the impact \non fiscal policy has resulted in declining tax revenue collection and a \nlarger government budget deficit than initially projected, at a time of \nlimited access to global credit markets; and (iv) the economic and fiscal \npolicy impacts threaten to undo recent gains in social policy spending, \nunemployment reduction, and poverty reduction programs.  \nGiven the second-round effects on the real economy and emerging \nfiscal  constraint,  the  Government  of  the  Philippines  asked  ADB  to \nprovide a countercyclical support loan of $500 million to support its \npublic expenditure program for 2009. The Government is concerned \nabout its ability to ensure predictability in budget financing as it has \nalready provided a temporary fiscal stimulus within its medium-term \nfiscal program. The Government projects gross financing requirements \nfor 2009 at P451 billion in domestic financing and $4.3 billion in external \nfinancing, including domestic and external debt that matures in 2009. \nThe  Government's  external  debt  amortization  profile  is  projected  to \nremain relatively high in 2010 with as much as $6.0 billion maturing in \n2010. Therefore, the countercyclical support loan will provide additional \nfinancing to the Government for its needed larger fiscal stimulus. This \nwill allow the Government to stimulate an economic recovery, protect its \nsocial spending and poverty reduction programs, and continue with its \nlonger-term development objectives in 2009.   \nThe Government announced its countercyclical expenditure program in \n2009  and  integrated  it  into  the  2009  budget.  Since  the  national \ngovernment budget does not have automatic stabilizers embedded on \n ", " ii \n \nthe expenditure side, the countercyclical program was needed to focus \non advancing infrastructure projects already in the investment pipeline, \nscale  up  social  assistance  and  public  employment  programs,  and \nimplement policy measures to expedite budget disbursements. Overall, \nnoninterest expenditure is programmed to rise by 20% in 2009 over \n2008,  providing  a  much-needed  boost  to  the  economy.  The  2009 \nnational budget substantially increases spending on the social sectors; \nthis will help mitigate adverse impacts of the economic contraction on \nthe poor. The proposed loan will support the Government's ongoing and \nscaled up social assistance programs and infrastructure programs in \nthe social sector and agriculture. \n \nThe  Government  has  scaled  up  its  social  assistance  and  poverty \nreduction programs to protect the most vulnerable from the effects of \nthe  economic  contraction.  These  programs  include  the  hunger \nmitigation  program,  self-employment  assistance  kaunlaran  (SEA-K) \nprogram,  food  for  school  program,  family-based  conditional  cash \ntransfer  program  (CCT),  community-based  development  program \n(KALAHI), and comprehensive livelihood and emergency employment \nprogram (CLEEP). These social assistance programs are implemented \nwithin the framework of the Government's 2007 national social welfare \nprogram.  Under  this  framework,  the  National  Economic  and \nDevelopment  Authority  introduced  a  national  definition  of  social \nprotection  and  identified  types  of  programs  covered.  In  2008  the \nGovernment  established  an  institutional  framework  for  enhanced \ndelivery of social protection programs that specifically assigns operating \nresponsibilities  of  the  National  Social  Welfare  Program  to  the \nDepartment of Social Welfare and Development. \n \nSpending on infrastructure also increased and procurement advanced. \nThe  2009  budgets  for  key  infrastructure  agencies  were  significantly \nincreased. In real terms, the Department of Public Works and Highways \nbudget  increased  by  13%  over  2008  and  the  Department  of \nAgriculture's  budget  rose  by  52%.  To  ensure  the  Government's \ncountercyclical program would be timely and effective by the second \nsemester of 2009, these agencies agreed to obligate at least 60% of \ntheir total 2009 spending program during the first semester of 2009.  \n \nSupport for the countercyclical expenditure program is anchored by \nADB\u2019s  existing  loan  programs  to  the  Philippines,  especially  policy \ndialogue with the Government under the Development Policy Support \nProgram (DPSP) approved in February 2007. The DPSP, structured as \na  program  cluster  comprising  three  single  tranche  operations  (or \nsubprograms) over 2006\u20132009, focuses on a broad policy agenda that \naddresses thematic and cross-cutting issues in four core areas: (i) fiscal \nsustainability  and  macroeconomic  stability,  (ii) governance  in  public \nfinancial management (PFM) and anticorruption in key revenue-raising \nagencies, (iii) the investment climate, and (iv) enhancement of human \ncapital and social inclusion. The third subprogram (scheduled to be \nsubmitted to the ADB Board of Directors for consideration in September \n2009) includes a postprogram monitoring framework for 12 months to \n ", "  iii \ncreate the basis for continuous policy dialogue and engagement during \nthe  critical  period  of  2009/10  prior  to  the  formulation  of  a  new \ngovernment after the Philippine presidential elections in May 2010. \n \nObjective, Scope  The loan is to provide support for the Government's countercyclical \nand Coverage of  expenditure program for 2009 and therefore ensure predictability in its \nLoan  budget financing given the necessity for temporary fiscal expansion. \nThis will allow the Government to stimulate the economic recovery, \nprotect  its  social  spending  and  poverty  reduction  programs  and \nobjectives, and continue with its longer-term development objectives in \n2009.   \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $500,000,000 under the Countercyclical Support Facility from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be provided under ADB's London \ninterbank-offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have \na 5-year term including a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility plus \n200  basis  points  (bps),  a  commitment  charge  of  75  bps  on  the \nundisbursed loan balance, and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan \nagreement.  \n \nPeriod and  The  loan  will  be  used  to  support  the  Government's  countercyclical \nTranching  expenditure program implemented from February 2009 to December \n2010, the end period specified for the countercyclical support facility; \nthe single tranche loan of $500 million is to be disbursed upon loan \neffectiveness.  \n   \nCounterpart Funds  The  Government  will  use  the  local  currency  counterpart  funds \ngenerated  by  the  loan  proceeds  to  help  maintain  current  social \nexpenditure and infrastructure spending. \n   \nExecuting Agency   Department of Finance \n   \nImplementation  The coordinating committee, initiated under the Development Policy \nArrangements  Support  Program  and  chaired  by  the  Department  of  Finance \nundersecretary, will be responsible for coordinating implementation of \nthe  Government's  countercyclical expenditure  program  together  with \nthe  Department  of  Budget  and  Management  (DBM)  and  National \nEconomic and Development Authority. The committee will meet semi-\nannually  to  monitor  progress  and  oversee  program  implementation. \nADB may be invited to participate in the meetings as an observer. \n   \nProcurement and  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \nDisbursement  costs (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured \nin  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The loan proceeds \nwill be disbursed to the Borrower in accordance with the provisions of \nADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans (1998). \n   \n ", " iv \n \nBenefits and  The economy and the poor are beneficiaries:  \nBeneficiaries  (i)  Higher  infrastructure  spending  will  generate  long-term  growth, \nstimulate investment, create jobs, and raise incomes. \n(ii) Improved  social  sector  outcomes  will  result  from  increased \nspending;  better  targeted  social  assistance  programs;  and \nimplementation of the CCT program linked to better outcomes for \nchild  education  and  health,  and  the  comprehensive  livelihood \nemployment  and  emergency  employment  program  (providing \ncrisis-related relief to unemployed workers). \n(iii) The  reduction  of  the  budget  financing  gap  will  support \nmacroeconomic stability within the medium-term fiscal program. \n \nRisks and  The loan supplements financing from other ADB programs such as the \nAssumptions  proposed third subprogram of the DPSP. The DPSP is firmly embedded \nin  the  Medium-Term  Philippine  Development  Plan  2004\u20132010;  the \nPhilippines Development Forum; and the Government\u2019s ongoing sector \nstrategies covering its fiscal program, tax administration reform, PFM, \nprocurement  reform,  investment  competitiveness,  rural  development, \nand social protection. \n \nRisks include the following:  \n(i)  The global financial crisis has hurt the Philippines. A prolonged \nglobal recession and dysfunctional credit markets will place further \nstress on the fiscal situation and the budget financing gap as \nabout $8.4 billion of external public debt matures in 2009 and \n2010.  The  economic  slowdown,  coupled  with  a  decline  in \nremittances, will result in increased poverty incidence in 2009. \nHowever, this will be partially offset through the scaling up of the \nCCT, implementation of the CLEEP and other social assistance \nprograms, and increase of infrastructure development in 2009 and \n2010. \n(ii) The  absorptive  capacity  of  key  spending  agencies  may  be \nstretched  impacting  the  timeliness  and  effectiveness  of  the \ncountercyclical  expenditure  program.  The  Government  has \nintroduced  several  policy  measures  to  expedite  disbursements \nand this will mitigate some of these constraints. \n(iii) Some  social  assistance  programs  and  infrastructure  are \nvulnerable  to  leakages,  poor  targeting,  and  corruption.  The \nGovernment is committed to addressing these problems through \ninstruments  such  as  public  financial  reforms  and  procurement. \nThe Government Procurement Policy Board continues to make \nsubstantial  progress  in  implementing  the  Procurement  Reform \nLaw  of  2003  and  its  3-year  action  plan  to  strengthen  the \ninstitutional  framework;  capacity  development  of  procurement \nofficers; and enforcement of the law, including the expansion of \nthe  electronic  procurement  portal  (PhilGEPS),  which  aims  to \nincrease transparency and enhance competition in procurement. \nThe  Procurement  Transparency  Group,  which  includes \ngovernment  agencies  and  major  civil  society  organizations  as \nmembers, was established to track and monitor the procurement \nof selected infrastructure projects. \n ", "     \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of the Philippines for Countercyclical Support (PHI-CS). The Development \nPolicy Letter confirming the Government's countercyclical expenditure program and its medium-\nterm development program is in Appendix 1. The status of the Government's compliance with \nthe access criteria is in Appendix 2. \n \nII.   REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE FROM THE COUNTERCYCLICAL SUPPORT \nFACILITY  \n2.  The  proposed  loan  under  the  Countercyclical  Support  Facility  (CSF)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) comes at a critical time for the Philippines. It is designed to maintain \nmomentum of the country\u2019s key development efforts at a challenging time of global financial \nmarket  failure  and  the  first  global  recession  since  World  War II.  The  global  crisis,  which \nintensified after September 2008, has affected the Philippine economy and social sectors in four \nrelated respects: (i) the first-round effects of the global financial crisis impacted the domestic \nfinancial sector in the second half of 2008; (ii) the second-round effects of reduced global \ndemand  have  hurt  the  real  economy  and  may  have  put  the  Philippines  in  an  economic \nrecession in the first half of 2009; (iii) the impact on fiscal policy has resulted in declining tax \nrevenue and a larger government budget deficit than initially projected, at a time of limited \naccess to global credit markets; and (iv) the economic and fiscal policy impacts threaten to undo \nrecent  gains  in  social  policy  spending,  unemployment  reduction,  and  poverty  reduction \nprograms.  \n3.  Given the second-round effects on the real economy and the emerging fiscal constraint, \nthe Government of the Philippines asked ADB to provide a countercyclical support loan (PHI-\nCS) of $500 million to support its 2009 public expenditure program, including its ongoing and \nscaled  up  social  assistance  and  emergency  employment  programs,  among  others.  The \nGovernment  is  concerned  about  ensuring  predictability  in  its  budget  financing,  given  the \nnecessity for temporary fiscal stimulus within the medium-term fiscal program. The Government \nprojects gross financing requirements for 2009 at P451.8 billion in domestic financing and $4.3 \nbillion in external financing, including domestic and external debt that matures in 2009. The \nGovernment's external debt amortization profile is projected to remain relatively high in 2010, \nwith  as  much  as  $6.0  billion  maturing  in  2010  (Table 4).  Therefore,  the  loan  will  provide \nadditional financing to the Government for the larger fiscal stimulus now needed. \n4.  The Government has met the access criteria under the CSF (Appendix 2).1 First, the \neconomy has been adversely impacted by the global economic crisis. This impact is manifested \nin  several  ways.  Economic  growth  contracted  by  2.3%  in  the  first  quarter  of  2009  on  a \nseasonally adjusted quarter-on-quarter basis, and the index of leading economic indicators \nsuggests the economy may have continued to contract in the second quarter. The collapse in \nexports and stagnant inflows of remittances were the key factors behind this sharper than \nexpected economic contraction. The Philippines is also experiencing temporary fiscal constraint \nbecause of the economic slowdown. Tax revenue collection declined by 5.2% in the first 6 \nmonths of 2009 compared with 10% growth in 2008. The 2009 national government budget \ndeficit is now projected to widen from the original programmed deficit of 0.5% of GDP to 3.2%, \nstill relatively low by international standards, reflecting the Government's cautious fiscal stance.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2009.

Second, the Government continues to maintain sound macroeconomic management of \nthe increased downside risks to the economy arising from the global financial crisis. This is \nreflected in a strong external balance with gross international reserves equivalent to 6.3 months \nof import cover, a low inflation environment, and a sound and liquid banking system. The \nGovernment  has  operated  primary  budget  surpluses  for  the  past  3  years,  and  reduced \nnonfinancial public sector debt from more than 101.0% of GDP in 2003 to 59.9% in 2008. While \npublic debt is broadly sustainable, it is vulnerable to exchange rate risks as 40% of public debt \nis denominated in foreign currencies (Appendix 3).  \n \n6.  Third,  the  Government  has  announced  a  countercyclical  expenditure  program  and \nincorporated  it  into  the  2009  budget  enacted  in  February  2009.  The  program  focuses  on \nadvancing infrastructure projects already in the Government's investment pipeline, scaling up \nsocial assistance (such as the conditional cash transfer program CCT) and public employment \nprograms, implementing the CLEEP program, and introducing policy measures to expedite \nbudget disbursements. Overall, noninterest expenditure is programmed to rise by 20% in 2009 \nover 2008, providing a much-needed boost to the economy in the second half of 2009.  \n \n7.  The PHI-CS loan is anchored by ADB\u2019s existing loan programs to the Philippines and \nespecially through policy dialogue with the Government under the Development Policy Support \nProgram (DPSP) approved by the ADB Board of Directors in February 2007 (Appendix 4). The \nDPSP is structured as a program cluster comprising three single-tranche operations (three \nsubprograms over 2006\u20132009) with a well-defined, medium-term framework. Policy triggers (or \nexpected prior actions) for subsequent subprograms ensures continuous dialogue between the \nGovernment, ADB, other development partners, and stakeholders. The DPSP aims to help the \nGovernment achieve its medium- to long-term goals of sustained high economic growth, lower \nunemployment, and poverty reduction. It focuses on a broad policy agenda that addresses \nthematic and crosscutting issues in four core areas: (i) fiscal sustainability and macroeconomic \nstability,  (ii)  governance  in  public  financial  management  (PFM)  and  anticorruption  in  key \nrevenue-raising agencies, (iii) investment climate, and (iv) enhancement of human capital and \nsocial inclusion. These are all key outcomes and outputs of the ADB country strategy and \nprogram 2005\u20132007 for the Philippines.2 \n \n8.  Under subprogram 1 of the DPSP, the Government implemented a series of measures \nto address the fiscal imbalance, resulting in a swift and impressive turnaround in the fiscal \nsituation and improved macroeconomic stability in 2006 and 2007. Subprogram 2 for 2008 built \non  reforms  initiated  under  subprogram  1  for  fiscal  consolidation  and  strengthening  of \ngovernance  in  PFM  and  procurement.  These  measures  resulted  in  successful  fiscal \nconsolidation and provided much needed fiscal space for increasing spending on the social \nsectors and infrastructure in 2007 and 2008. The third subprogram, scheduled to be submitted \nto the ADB Board of Directors for consideration in September 2009, increases the focus on  \n(i) institutionalizing governance programs such as the anticorruption revenue programs in the \nBureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and Bureau of Customs (BOC), (ii) the investment climate, \nand (iii) the social sectors. While the third subprogram is the final of the series, it includes a new \npostprogram monitoring framework for 12 months to create the basis for continuous policy \ndialogue and engagement during the critical 2009/10 period prior to the formulation of a new \ngovernment after the Philippine presidential elections in May 2010. The monitoring framework \nfocuses on the Government's short-term plan for advancing its reforms in fiscal policy, PFM, and \nselected areas in investment climate and poverty, supported by ADB, the Government of Japan, \nand other development partners' technical and program assistance (Appendix 5 provides the \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2005.

During formulation of the PHI-CS, the Government \nand ADB agreed to modify the third subprogram of DPSP to strengthen policy measures related \nto poverty monitoring and to include its operationalization as part of the post-program monitoring \nframework. \n   \nIII.  THE GLOBAL CRISIS AND COUNTRY CONTEXT \nA.  The Global Crisis and its Impact on the Philippine Economy, Employment, and \nPoverty \n9.  The global financial turmoil has impacted developed and most developing economies, \nincluding the Philippines. The impact on developing countries has varied, but generally the crisis \nadversely impacted access to global financial markets; and resulted in a sharp downturn in the \nreal  economy  with  ensuing  fiscal  stress,  and  higher  unemployment  and  poverty.  The \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  projects  the  global  economy  will  contract  this  year  and  only \nmoderately recover next year as financial market stabilization will take longer than previously \nenvisaged.  Developing  country  access  to  international  credit  will  remain  curtailed  as  a \nconsequence.3  \n \n10.  Spillovers from the global financial crisis on the Philippine domestic financial sector\u2014\nespecially banking\u2014have been relatively muted because of limited exposure to troubled US \nassets, and low exposure to securitization and off-balance-sheet activities. The banking system \nremains sound with a capital adequacy ratio at 14% and gross nonperforming loans at 3.6% as \nof the end of May 2009. The equity market was impacted with equity prices falling by as much \nas 50% in 2008, in line with the experience of regional neighbors; it has since stabilized.  \n \n11.  However,  the  global  credit  crunch  that  emerged  in  September  2008  did  hurt  the \nPhilippines by making access to international debt markets more expensive, for both the public \nand private sectors. Yields on medium-term domestic bonds increased by nearly 350 basis \npoints (bps) in October 2008 and the Philippines\u2019 international bond spreads surged to 800 bps \non 24 October 2008. The Philippines was among the first of the emerging markets to reenter \nglobal  capital  markets  with  a  dollar  bond  issue  in  January  2009.  It  successfully  raised \n$1.5 billion at an average yield of 8.5%, an increase in the bond spread by 300 bps over \nprecrisis levels. At that time, the Philippines took advantage of a liquid dollar domestic market \ndue to the steady inflow of remittances and a collapse in the demand for trade finance, with \nmore than 40% of bond issuance taken up by domestic banks. In July 2009, the Government \nraised an additional $750.0 million at an average yield of 6.6%. While global credit markets have \nshown  signs  of  recovery  in  recent  months  and  spreads  have  started  to  decrease  toward \nprecrisis levels, global markets remain fragile and at the end of June 2009 spreads on Philippine \ninternational bonds increased again from an average spread of 270 bps in early June 2009 to \n320  bps  (Figure  1).

The  Second  Round  Effects  of  Global  Demand  Destruction.  The  second-round \neffects of the global recession on the Philippine economy are greater than the impacts of the \n1997/98 Asian financial crisis. The economies of its major trading partners and recipients of \noverseas  Filipino  workers  have  entered  severe  recessions.  Consequently,  exports  (mainly \ninfluenced by the sharp contraction in exports of electronics) collapsed by 40% from December \n2008 to April 2009 on a year-on-year basis. As a result, the Philippine economy contracted by \n2.3% in the first quarter of 2009 compared with the fourth quarter of 2008 on a seasonally \nadjusted basis (Figure 1). Remittances have held up much better than trade in goods and other \nservices,  but  their  growth  virtually  stalled  with  2.5%  growth  in  the first  4  months  of  2009 \n ", "                           5\n    \ncompared with 15% for the same period in 2008. As a result, gross national income (which \nincludes remittances) contracted 1.2% for the same period. The index of leading economic \nindicators  produced  by  the  National  Statistical  Coordination  Board  points  to  an  increased \nprobability that the economy contracted in the second quarter of 2009 suggesting the economy \ncould be in recession. \n \nFigure 1: Key Economic and Financial Indicators \n (a) GDP Growth and the Index of Leading Economic        (b) Spreads in Sovereign Dollar Bonds       \n       Indicators (LEI) 2007 to 2009a                 (bps over US treasury bills)     \n3 0.6 1200\n1000\n2\n0.4\n800\n%1\nh  0.2 600\nt\nw\ngro0 LEI 400\nP  Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 0\nD-1 2007 2008 2009 200\nG\n-0.2 0\n-2\n-3 -0.4 1-Jan 1-Feb1-Mar 1-Apr 1-May 1-Jun1-Jul 1-Aug 1-Sep 1-Oct 1-Nov1-Dec 1-Jan 1-Feb1-Mar 1-Apr1-May 1-Jun 1-Jul\nGDP LEI Philippines East Asia Indonesia Malaysia\n \n (c) Growth in the Philippines' Exports and Imports        (d) Unemployment Rate \n      (% change, year-on-year)                 (%, 4 quarter moving average) \n40 8.2\n30 8.0\n20\n7.8\n10\n7.6\n0\nJ A J O J A J O J A J O J A J O J A 7.4\n-10an pr ul ct an pr ul ct an pr ul ct an pr ul ct an pr\n-20-05 -06 -07 -08 -09 7.2\n-30 7.0\n-40\n6.8\n-50 2 q q q 2 q q q 2 q q q 2 q\n0 2 3 4 0 2 3 4 0 2 3 4 0 2\n0 0 0 0\n6 7 8 9\nExports Imports q1 q1 q1 q1\n \nbps = basis points, GDP = gross domestic product, LEI = leading economic indicators. \na The index of leading economic indicators is a composite index of 11 economic indicators that are related to or can \ninfluence the economic cycle.

With this background, the Government revised its macroeconomic framework in June \n2009 and now projects growth of 0.8%\u20131.8% for 2009 (down from 3.1%\u20134.1% projected in \nFebruary 2009), with higher unemployment and poverty rates. Development partners project a \nlower growth rate ranging from \u22121.0% to 1.0% for 2009 because of faltering exports, stalling \nforeign investments, and a projected drop in remittances. However because of its lower trade \nintensity, the Philippines\u2019 vulnerability to export fluctuations is less than its neighbors. These \nprojections translate to a substantial per capita income decline from \u20130.2% to \u20133.0% in 2009, \n ", "6   \nthereby likely increasing poverty (para. 15). The Government projects a very modest recovery in \n2010 with growth estimated at 2.6%\u20133.6%.  \n \nFigure 2: Tax Revenue Behavior Over the Economic Cycle \n(a) Output Gap and Changes in Direct and Indirect               (b) Quarterly BIR Tax Collection and GDP Growth \n     Taxes\u2013GDP Ratioa                      (tax collection growth year-on-year; GDP)b   \n3 25\n2.2\n2 20\n1.7\n1 15 1.2\n0 0.7\n10\n1234567890123456789 0.2\n-1 9999999990000000000\n9999999990000000000\n1111111112222222222 5 -0.3\n-2\n-0.8\n0\n-3\nQ Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q -1.3\n-5 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1\n-4  2  2  2  2 -1.8\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n-5 -10 6 7 8 9 -2.3\nOutput Gap Indirect Tax Direct Income Tax BIR GDP\n          \nBIR = Bureau of Internal Revenue, GDP = gross domestic product. \na  The output gap is a proxy for the economic cycle. It refers to the difference between actual economic growth and \npotential economic growth. A negative gap suggests actual growth below potential and vice versa. The Philippines\u2019 \npotential economic growth rate is estimated using the Hodrick-Prescott filter, which estimates a nonlinear trend in \nthe economic growth data. The tax measures are specified as the percentage point change in the tax\u2013GDP ratio \nbetween 2 years. As is apparent from the figures, tax revenues tend to be moderately pro-cyclical\u2014that is\u2014tax \ncollections grow faster than nominal GDP during higher growth periods (implying an increase in the tax ratio) and \ndrop faster than nominal GDP during economic troughs (implying a fall in the tax ratio).  \nb  BIR tax collection refers to the growth in collection on year-on-year basis. GDP growth refers to quarter-on-quarter \ngrowth, seasonally adjusted.   \nSources: Asian Development Bank, Bureau of Treasury, Department of Finance estimates. \n \n \n14.  The  global  financial  crisis  has  affected  fiscal  policy  in  three  ways.  First,  with  the \ncontraction in the economy, it is necessary for the Government to provide a modest stimulus in \n2009 while maintaining medium-term fiscal discipline. Second, the contraction in the economy in \nthe first quarter of 2009 resulted in a decline in tax collections of about 5.2% in the first 6 \nmonths of 2009 over the same period in 2008, and about 20% below its original 2009 budget \ntarget (Figure 2).5 The decline in tax collection was broad-based across most types of taxes, \nalthough the drop in foreign trade tax collection was larger than others. Customs collection \ndecreased by 8.3% (of which value-added tax on plummeting imported goods fell 12.9%) and \nBIR's collections fell by 5.1% on a year-on-year basis. ADB staff assessments indicate that tax \nrevenues  have  historically  exhibited  a  systematic,  moderate  pro-cyclical  pattern  in  the \nPhilippines, that is, during periods of fast economic growth, direct and indirect taxes grow faster \nthan nominal GDP; and during sharp slowdowns, taxes fall faster than nominal GDP. ADB staff \nestimates based on a low-growth scenario for 2009 and 2010 indicate that the tax\u2013GDP ratio \nwill decline for FY2009; some of the decline will carry over into 2010 as corporate tax losses are \ncarried forward. As a result of the increased spending and projected decline in revenues, the \n                                                 \n5  Precrisis legislative tax measures, such as increasing the tax income threshold for wage earners effective July \n2008 and reducing the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 32% effective January 2009 as mandated in the \n2005 legislation, are estimated to have lowered tax collection by about P36 billion in 2009.  \n ", "                           7\n    \nGovernment  revised  its  fiscal  program  for  2009  and  projects  an  increased  deficit  from \nP68 billion in 2008 to P250 billion in 2009, or 3.2% of GDP (Table 2). Third, tight liquidity in \nglobal credit markets and elevated risks have increased the cost of financing the budget and \nrefinancing public debt.  \n \nB.  The Government's Macroeconomic Management \n15.  Appropriate and Responsive Policy. The Government's macroeconomic policy stance \nto the increased downside risks to the economy from the global crisis has been appropriate and \nresponsive. Several key macroeconomic indicators showed improvement in 2009 over 2008.  \nOn the external side, the current account is in surplus of about 4.9% of GDP for the first quarter \nof 2009. Gross international reserves continue to accumulate and reached $39.5 billion at the \nend of May 2009, equivalent to 6.3 months of import cover and three times higher than external \ndebt maturing this year. Conventionally, at least 3 months of import coverage is considered a \nsufficient buffer against modest shocks to the balance of payments. On the monetary side, the \nCentral Bank of the Philippines (BSP) has operated an appropriate and timely monetary policy \nstance throughout the crisis. In early 2008 it raised interest rates to counter the threat of \nsecond-round inflationary pressures arising from the surge in global commodity prices. It then \nshifted to an expansionary monetary position at the end of 2008 to provide sufficient liquidity to \nthe banking system against the backdrop of rapidly falling inflation. The BSP currently maintains \na neutral monetary stance. Inflation fell to 0.2% (year-on-year) in July 2009, well below BSP's \ninflation target range of 2.5%\u20134.5% for 2009. Inflation is expected to remain benign for the rest \nof this year, indicative of the slump in domestic economic activity.  \n \n16.  The Government's response to mitigating the risk of the global financial crisis on the \nPhilippine financial sector involves a number of preemptive measures aimed at increasing \nliquidity in the domestic banking system, assuring confidence of depositors, and strengthening \nBSP's lender of last resort facility. These measures include (i) BSP strengthened its lender of \nlast resort facility by increasing its budget for the peso rediscounting facility from P20 billion to \nP40 billion on 14 November 2008, and opened a dollar repo facility on 20 October 2008 to \nensure  dollar  liquidity  with  the  banks\u2019  dollar-denominated  Philippine  sovereign  bonds  as \nunderlying collateral; (ii) BSP increased liquidity in the banking system by easing monetary \npolicy including reducing the reserve requirement by 2 percentage points, (iii) BSP allowed \nfinancial institutions to temporarily reclassify their investments in debt and equity securities; and \n(iv) Congress approved an increase in the ceiling on deposit insurance from P250,000 to \nP500,000 per depositor to more closely align with recent adjustments in deposit guarantees in \nthe region; With these preemptive measures in place, indicators show signs of improvement. \nBank liquidity eased at the end of 2008 and bank lending continued robust growth at about 20% \nin the first quarter of 2009 on a year-on-year basis; the stock market and the peso have \nstabilized  since  November;  and  yields  on  short-  and  medium-term  (3 months  to  5  years) \ndomestic  bonds  fell  back  to  precrisis  rates,  although  yields  on  longer-term  bonds  remain \nelevated. \n \n17.  Public Finances. With the sharp contraction in global demand since September 2008, \nand the recognition by the Government and development partners that a larger fiscal expansion \nis necessary, the Government revised its fiscal program for 2009. It now projects a national \ngovernment  budget  deficit  of  3.2%  of  GDP  to  reflect  the  first  quarter  budget  outturn  and \nchanges in the budget's macroeconomic assumptions (Table 2). The revised budget deficit \n ", "8   \ntranslates to an actual fiscal expansion of up to 2.3% of GDP from 2008,6 low by regional \nstandards.7 It covers about 40%\u201350% of the expected negative output gap this year (i.e., the \ngap between potential and actual economic growth), suggesting that the expansion will have a \nmoderate impact on mitigating the economic contraction (Appendix 6). \n \n18.  The Government has announced its revised medium term goal of a balanced budget and \ndecided it should be extended to 2013 instead of 2010 as originally planned, being aware of the \nneed to provide investors with a sign of its commitment to maintaining a credible fiscal program \nwith clear priorities. It targets a national government budget deficit of 2.5% in 2010 (primarily \nachieved by cutting discretionary spending back to its medium-term spending targets), 1.5% in \n2011, and 0.5% in 2012; and a balanced budget by 2013. Recognizing its commitment to fiscal \nprudence and overall sound macroeconomic management, Moody's upgraded the country\u2019s \nsovereign credit rating from Ba3 to Ba1 with a stable outlook. The upgrade was prompted by the \nrelatively high degree of resiliency in the banking system and the external balance-of-payments \nsituation. The other two major rating agencies maintained the 2008 Philippines\u2019 sovereign credit \nratings of BB\u2013 stable (Standard & Poor\u2019s) and BB stable (Fitch).  \n \n19.  The medium-term fiscal targets are realistic and achievable, but will require increased \neffort to increase revenues by about 1 percentage point of GDP from 2010 to 2012. While the \ndecline in tax collection is substantially attributable to the economic contraction in the first \nquarter of 2009, weak tax administration and inefficiencies in tax policy have also resulted in \nBIR being unable to increase value-added tax collections through improvements in tax efficiency \nand enforcement. Increasing tax revenue collection is a long-term challenge for the Government. \nIts  approach  is  threefold:  (i)  implement  tax  administration  reforms;  (ii)  enhance  and \ninstitutionalize anticorruption initiatives in BIR and BOC; and (iii) improve tax policies. Some \nprogress in reforms to tax administration has been made under subprogram 3 of the DPSP, \nalbeit gradual and incremental. BIR has prioritized the institutionalization of its anticorruption \nrevenue  program  (Run  After  Tax  Evaders  or  RATE).  Lessons  from  the  second  DPSP \nsubprogram8 indicate  that  these  initiatives  must  be  institutionalized  within  the  agencies  to \nensure  they  are  sustainable,  permanent,  and  effective  deterrents  to  tax  evasion.  The \nGovernment  submitted  amendments  to  tax  legislation  (excise  tax  and  consolidation  of \ninvestment tax incentives) to enhance tax policy efficiency and broaden the tax base; and \nproposed  simplifying  net  income  taxation  for  individuals  in  business.  Once  approved  by \nCongress, these legislative measures are estimated to increase tax collection by P35 billion in \nthe first full year of operation.  \n \n                                                 \n6  Calculated as the change in the national government overall budget deficit from 2008 (0.9% of GDP) to 2009 (3.2% \nof GDP).   \n7  ADB staff estimates of fiscal expansion in Southeast Asia: Cambodia, 1.8% of GDP; Indonesia, 2.4% of GDP; \nThailand, 5.1% of GDP; and Viet Nam, 3.8% of GDP. \n8  ADB. 2008.

THE GOVERNMENT'S COUNTERCYCLICAL EXPENDITURE PROGRAM \n20.  The  Government  announced  its  countercyclical  expenditure  program  in  2009  and \nintegrated it into the 2009 budget. The national government budget does not have automatic \nstabilizers embedded on the expenditure side of the budget. Therefore it had to announce the \ncountercyclical expenditure program focusing on advancing infrastructure projects already in the \ninvestment  pipeline,  scaling  up  social  assistance  and  public  employment  programs,  and \nintroducing policy measures to expedite budget disbursements. Overall, noninterest expenditure \nis programmed to rise by 20% in 2009 over 2008, providing a much-needed boost to the \neconomy. The 2009 national budget substantially increases spending on social sectors to help \nmitigate adverse impacts of the economic contraction on the poor. In real terms (i.e., inflation-\nadjusted), the Department of Social Welfare and Development's budget for 2009 has doubled \ncompared with the 2008 budget (primarily for funding the conditional cash transfer program); \neducation expenditure has increased by 10% and health spending by 19%. Overall, spending \non social sectors increased from 27% of the budget in 2005 to 31% in 2009. The PHI-CS in \nparticular will support the Government's ongoing and scaled up social assistance programs and \ninfrastructure programs in the social sector and agriculture included in the 2009 budget and \nproposed 2010 budget (Table 3 and Development Policy letter in Appendix 1). \n ", "10  \nTable 3: Philippines: Selected Social Assistance and Infrastructure Programs \nTargeted  Implementation \nBeneficiaries for  Progress \nProgram  Program Description  2009  (as of July 2009) \nSocial Assistance Programs     \n1.

Infrastructure. Spending on infrastructure also increased and procurement advanced. \nThe  2009  budgets  for  the  key  infrastructure  agencies  were  significantly  increased.  The \nDepartment of Public Works and Highways budget increased by 13% in real terms over 2008, \nand the Department of Agriculture's budget rose by 52% in real terms. To ensure that the \nGovernment's countercyclical expenditure program would be timely and effective by the second \nsemester of 2009, these agencies agreed to obligate (or commit) at least 60% of their total \nspending program for 2009 during the first semester of 2009. The PHI-CS will support the labor-\nintensive and quick disbursing infrastructure programs in the social sectors. These include the \nconstruction  and  repairs  of  school  and  library  hubs  program  and  the  health  facilities \nenhancement program in the 2009 budget and proposed 2010 budget. The PHI-CS will also \nsupport the farm to market roads program implemented by the Department of Agriculture and \nthe Department of Public Works and Highways in the 2009 budget and in 2010.  \n \n22.  Social  Programs.  The  social  assistance  programs  are  implemented  within  the \nframework of the Government's national social welfare program. In February 2007, the National \nEconomic and Development Authority passed a national definition of social protection and the \ntypes of programs covered by it. As the next step, the Government established an institutional \nframework  for  enhanced  delivery  of  social  protection  programs  that  specifically  assigns \noperating responsibilities of the National Social Welfare Program to the Department of Social \nWelfare  and  Development.  Within  this  context,  agencies  have  designed  or  refined  and \nimplemented  several  social  assistance  programs  to  help  mitigate  the  worst  effects  of  the \neconomic contraction on the poor. \n \n23.  The Government has scaled up its social assistance and poverty reduction programs to \nprotect the most vulnerable from the effects of the economic contraction. These programs \ninclude the hunger mitigation program, self-employment assistance kaunlaran (SEA-K) program, \nfood for school program, family-based conditional cash transfer (CCT) program, and the new \ncrisis-related comprehensive livelihood and emergency employment program (CLEEP), and the \ncommunity-based  development  program  (Kalahi).  These  are  a  combination  of  short-term \nprograms  to  mitigate  the  worst  effects  of  the  crisis  on  the  most  vulnerable  people  in  the \ncommunity, and longer-term programs aimed at addressing causes of poverty such as limited \naccess to education and health services for children (Table 3). Presidential Executive Order 782, \nissued in 2009, allocates 1.5% of ministries' maintenance expenditure to new hiring of displaced \nworkers accredited with the Department of Labor and Employment on temporary contracts of up \nto 6 months. This could create an additional 40,000 jobs.  \n \n24.  While  scaling  up  these  programs  is  important  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  the  sharp \ndownturn  on  the  poor  and  vulnerable  families,  some  of  the  programs  are  thought  to  be \nfragmented, not well targeted, and have leakages; overall results in terms of net welfare to \nrecipient groups are mixed. An ADB study on social protection coverage shows that such \nprograms only cover one third of the poor compared with an average of one half in Southeast \nAsia and East Asia. In particular, the rice subsidy program is considered costly and not well \ntargeted. The Commission of Audit\u2019s performance audit identifies implementation weaknesses \nin some of these programs.9 The Government is looking at ways to enhance social protection \ncoverage  of  the  poor  in  a  well-targeted  framework.  In  this  effort,  the  Government  is \nimplementing its national social welfare framework (para. 22). With the aim of refining targeted \nprograms under the new definition, the Department of Social Welfare and Development is \nimplementing the CCT program with improved targeting techniques (proxy means test), and the \n                                                 \n9  The Commission on Audit is the Philippines' supreme audit institution. The various audit reports are available at the \nCommission on Audit website (http://www.coa.gov.ph). \n ", "12  \nCLEEP, both supported under the PHI-CS. The CCT program provides income support of \nP1,400  per  month  to  recipient  poor  families  with  attached  conditions  related  to  pre-  and \npostnatal care; children\u2019s attendance at preschool, elementary school, and junior high school; \nand  child  immunization.  Currently  covering  337,345  families,  the  Government  intends  to \nincrease coverage to up to 699,000 families by the end of 2009. It is intended that the CCT will \neventually cover up to 2 million poor and vulnerable families and therefore act as an automatic \nstabilizer on the expenditure side of the budget. The CLEEP was designed to respond to \neconomic slow down and aims to create 373,117 temporary jobs in labor intensive programs \nimplemented by line ministries and attached agencies. The Government is now starting to look \nat ways to reform the rice subsidy program and shift savings to more effective social assistance \nprograms. Appendix 6 provides a poverty impact assessment of these programs. \n \n25.  The National Economic and Development Authority assists in monitoring implementation \nand disbursement of key crisis-related programs, and reports to the President on a monthly \nbasis.  During  the  first semester  of  2009,  238,610  temporary  jobs  were  created  under  the \ncomprehensive livelihood employment and emergency employment program with about 50.0% \nof  the  budget  obligated.  The  Department  of  Education  obligated  102%  of  its  spending \ncommitments for the first semester of 2009, while the performance of the other important \ndepartments is as follows: the Department of Public Works and Highways 100%; Department of \nTransportation and Communication 57%, and Department of Agriculture 55%. \n \n26.  Public Financial Management. The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) \nsupplemented ongoing PFM reforms with additional measures to expedite disbursements to \nassist the Government\u2019s efforts to stimulate the economy through timely, well-targeted, and \ntransparent programs. Many of the key procurement ministries, such as the Department of \nAgriculture,  Department  of  Education,  Department  of  Public  Works  and  Highways,  and \nDepartment of Transportation and Communication, have relatively low absorptive capacity and \nutilization  rates  that  could  undermine  Government  efforts  to  stimulate  the  economy. \nSupplementary measures include (i) shifting from a quarterly cash release basis to a 6-month \ncash  release  basis  that  improves  budget  certainty  and  predictability  for  line  ministries;  \n(ii)  mandating  government  agencies  to  spend  within  the  month  or  lose  the  money;  and  \n(iii)  clarifying  to  ministries  that  they  can  start  the  procurement  process  prior  to  receiving \nallotments from DBM (authority to obligate the budget) but the signing of contracts will require \nreceipt of these allotments (clarification provided by the Government Procurement Policy Board, \nwhich oversees implementation of the procurement reform law). Prior to this circular, agencies \nwould not begin the procurement process until they received budget allotments\u2014causing delays \nin  the  procurement  process.  These  new  actions  have  improved  the  efficiency  of  budget \ndisbursements. \n \n27.  Under its PFM and procurement reforms, the Government introduced measures and \nsystems to address problems with leakages and corruption with programs. This is a long-term \nreform effort. Substantial progress has been made in procurement reform. The Government\u2019s \nProcurement  Policy  Board  continues  to  make  substantial  progress  in  implementing  the \nProcurement Reform Law of 2003 and its 3-year action plan to strengthen the institutional \nframework, capacity building of procurement officers, and enforcement of the law. This includes \nexpanding the electronic procurement portal (PhilGEPS), which aims to increase transparency \nand  enhance  competition  in  procurement.  The  Procurement  Transparency  Group,  with \ngovernment  agencies  and  major  civil  society  organizations  as  members,  is  tracking  and \n ", "                           13\n    \nmonitoring procurement of selected infrastructure projects.10 Regular updates of procurement \nmonitoring are posted on the group\u2019s website.11 If discrepancies are identified in the bid and \nawards process, the group notifies the bids and awards committee and stakeholders with the \nobjective of resolving any transparency concerns. \n \nV.  ECONOMIC AND POVERTY IMPACT OF THE COUNTERCYCLICAL EXPENDITURE \nPROGRAM \n28.  Economic Stimulus Effects. The national government budget deficit is projected at \n3.2% of GDP or an expansion of 2.4% over 2008 (deficit of 0.9% in 2008). An ADB assessment \nindicates that the stimulus effect of the expansion will be less than 2.4% of GDP as it depends \non the type of spending activities in the stimulus package, and their multiplier effects and timing \n(Appendix 6). For example, tax breaks of P36 billion are likely to expand GDP by less than this \namount  as  some  proportion  will  be  saved,  while  the  social  assistance  and  labor-intensive \ninfrastructure spending program of P160 billion are likely to stimulate the economy by up to \nP192 billion (multiplier of 1.2). These programs are likely to have an immediate impact because \nof their short disbursement periods. Some of the larger infrastructure projects, however, will take \nup to 12 months to have an impact due to the longer procurement and disbursements periods. \n \n29.  Poverty Impacts. An economic slowdown or contraction of about \u22120.5% to 1.8% in \n2009 will reduce per capita incomes ranging from \u20130.2% to \u20132.5%. This is expected to increase \npoverty in the short term because of the weak labor market and reduced household earnings. \nOver the medium term, a slow economic recovery will create persistently high unemployment \nand suppressed earnings in the informal sector as new labor market entrants outnumber the \nnew jobs created. Structural poverty may persist as poor families' access to social services is \nreduced. The Government's fiscal stimulus will partially offset the unemployment and poverty \nimpacts of the crisis; however, an economic recovery of about 5%\u20136% in 2011 is necessary to \nensure a sustained reduction in poverty. The CCT and employment programs (Table 3) will \nhave an immediate impact on the welfare of families, and are reaching a significant number of \npeople likely to be affected by the crisis (Appendix 6). However, some of these programs (such \nas the subsidized rice program) are not well targeted; this will undermine their effectiveness.  \n \nVI.  THE OBJECTIVE, SCOPE, AND COVERAGE OF THE LOAN \n \nA.  Objective \n30.  The  objective  of  the  PHI-CS  loan  is  to  provide  support  for  the  Government's \ncountercyclical expenditure program for 2009 and therefore ensure predictability of Government \nbudget  financing  given  the  necessity  for  temporary  fiscal  expansion.  This  will  allow  the \nGovernment to protect its social spending and poverty reduction programs and objectives, and \ncontinue with its longer-term development objectives in 2009.    \n \n                                                 \n10  The  group  established  under  the  DPSP\u2019s  subprogram  2  comprises  representatives  from  the  Government \nProcurement Policy Board, key procurement agencies, and six civil society organizations nominated by the Civil \nSociety Organization Forum\u2014a voluntary gathering of major civil society organizations. The six are the Bishops\u2013\nBusinessmen Conference, Makati Business Club, Transparency and Accountability Network, Ateneo Government \nWatch, Confederation of Filipino Consultants, and Procurement Watch. \n11  Procurement Transparency Group. http://procurementtransparencygroup.wordpress.com. \n ", "14  \nB.  Financing Plan \n31.  The  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $500,000,000  under  the  Countercyclical \nSupport  Facility  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital resources. The  loan  will  have  a 5-year  term, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years; an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB's \nLondon  interbank-offered  rate  (LIBOR)  plus  200  bps;  a commitment  charge  of 75  bps  on \nundisbursed  loan  balance,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. The \nGovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n \nTable 4: Government Financing Requirements \n(Peso billion, unless otherwise indicated) \n2009 Actual \nFinancing Mix  Actual for 2008  Programmed for 2009  (Jan\u2013Apr) \nNet Financing  160.6  270.6  29.5 \nExternal (net)  (9.2)  108.4  34.9 \n    External (gross)  71.3  209.1  95.7 \n    Less amortization  80.5  100.7  60.8 \nDomestic (net)  169.8  161.8  (5.4) \nDomestic (gross)  429.8  451.8  255.6 \nLess Amortization  260.0  290.0  261.0 \nGross Financing Mix (%)  100.0  100.0  100.0 \n   Domestic (%)  86.0  68.0  88.0 \n   External (%)  14.0  32.0  12.0 \n       Project ($ million)  545.0  411.0  63.0 \n       Program ($ million)a  584.0  1,650.0  448.0 \n   Bonds and other \ncommercial debt ($ \nmillion)  500.0  2,250.0  1,500.0 \na  Proposed Asian Development Bank (ADB) program loans for 2009 include the third subprogram of the \nDevelopment Policy Support Program (DPSP) ($250 million), the second tranche of Governance in Justice \nSector Development Program ($150 million), and the second subprogram of the Local Government \nFinancing and Budget Reform Program ($225 million). On a disbursement basis, the first tranche of the \nGovernance in Justice Sector Development Program ($150 million) was disbursed in the first quarter of \n2009 and approved by the ADB Board of Directors in December 2008. The Government of Japan \ncofinanced the second subprogram of the DPSP ($100 million) and is considering cofinancing the third \nDPSP subprogram. Exchange rate $1 = P48.02. \nSource: Government of Philippines, Department of Finance. \n \n32.  The loan size reflects the budget financing needs of the Government arising from the \nglobal financial crisis (Table 4). According to Department of Finance (DOF) budget reports, the \ngross budget financing requirements for 2009 are estimated at P660.9 billion, of which gross \nexternal financing requirements are P209.1 billion (about $4.3 billion). Overall, net financing \nrequirements (net of amortization) amount to P270.6 billion. The Government\u2019s debt strategy for \n2009 is to raise 68% of gross financing requirements from domestic markets and the remaining \n32%  from  international  markets.  However,  the  gross  financing  requirements  and  the \ncomposition of financing sources remains fluid as international credit markets stabilize and the \nimpact on the fiscal situation unfolds. The PHI-CS loan will help close the financing gap for 2009 \nthrough support to ongoing and scaled up social assistance programs and infrastructure in the \nsocial sectors (Table 3). ADB program loans amounting to a combined $775.0 million, other \ndevelopment partner programs, and commercial borrowings will help close the financing gap.  \n \n ", "                           15\n    \nVII.  IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS \n \nA.  Countercyclical Support Management \n \n33.  DOF, as the Executing Agency, will report to ADB, administer and disburse the loan \nproceeds, and maintain accounts. The coordinating committee initiated under the DPSP, and \nchaired by the DOF undersecretary, will be responsible for coordinating implementation of the \nGovernment's  countercyclical  expenditure  program  together  with  DBM  and  the  National \nEconomic  and  Development  Authority.  The  committee  will  meet  semi-annually  to  monitor \nprogress and oversee the Government's countercyclical expenditure program implementation. \nADB may be invited to participate in the meetings as an observer.  \n \nB.  Procurement and Disbursement  \n \n34.  The loan will be released in a single tranche upon loan effectiveness. The loan proceeds \nwill be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding local duties and taxes) of items \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  no  more  than  180  days  before  the \neffectiveness date of the loan. Items specified in the list of ineligible items (Appendix 8) and \nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources are excluded. In accordance with the \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for \nProgram Loans (1998), the loan proceeds will be disbursed to the Republic of the Philippines as \nthe Borrower. No supporting import documentation will be required if during each year that loan \nproceeds are expected to be disbursed the value of Philippines total imports minus imports from \nnonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development \nassistance is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during \nsuch year. The Government will certify its compliance with this formula with each withdrawal \nrequest.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be  required. \nDisbursements will be made under the simplified procedures for program loans. In accordance \nwith the simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for program loans, all \ngoods and services produced and originating in ADB member countries will be procured, with \ndue consideration to economy and efficiency, in accordance with the Government\u2019s standard \npublic procedures and normal private sector commercial practices acceptable to ADB. Goods \ncommonly traded on the international commodity market will be procured in accordance with \nprocedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB.  \n \nC.  Anticorruption and Fiduciary Issues \n \n35.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the PHI-CS. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand the bidding documents for the PHI-CS. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the PHI-CS shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the PHI-CS. \n \n36.  The country\u2019s financial management systems were assessed based on diagnostic work \ndone  in  the  last  12  months  including  the  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability \nassessment led by the World Bank, with ADB participation during the first stage. Based on this \nassessment, the fiduciary arrangements proposed for the PHI-CS loan remain acceptable. The \n ", "16  \nassessment indicates that the Government has made progress in improving systems related to \nPFM, financial accountability, and procurement; although weaknesses remain and continued \nprogress  on  implementing  the  Government\u2019s  program  to  improve  governance  and  reduce \ncorruption is essential. The Government places significant emphasis on making progress in \nimplementing  the  medium-term  expenditure  framework  in  line  ministries  and  the  operating \nperformance  indicators  framework  for  performance-based  management;  improving  the \ncredibility of the budget, its execution, and reporting; rolling out internal control systems and \ninternal audit; and institutionalizing anticorruption initiatives in key revenue-raising agencies of \nBIR and BOC. These measures are being undertaken within the DPSP program cluster and with \ntechnical support from ADB and other development partners (Australian Agency for International \nDevelopment,  JBIC,  European  Commission,  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment, and the World Bank). \n \nD.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n37.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification for withdrawal applications. Before withdrawal, the Government will \nopen a deposit account at BSP to receive all loan proceeds. The account will be managed, \noperated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB.  \n \nE.  Performance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Program Review \n \n38.  ADB, in cooperation with the coordinating committee (para. 33), will conduct reviews of \nmacroeconomic  and  fiscal  conditions,  including  implementation  of  the  Government's \ncountercyclical expenditure program every 6 months.  \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n39.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$500,000,000 to the Republic of the Philippines for Countercyclical Support from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility plus 200 basis points; a term of 5 years, including a \ngrace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board.  \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n12 August 2009 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "                           17\n    \nDEVELOPMENT POLICY LETTER \n \n ", "18   Appendix 1 \n \n ", "                               Appendix 1  19\n      \n \n ", "20   Appendix 1 \n \n ", "                               Appendix 1  21\n      \n \n ", "22   Appendix 1 \n \n ", "                               Appendix 1  23\n      \n ", " \nCOMPLIANCE WITH ACCESS CRITERIA FOR THE COUNTERCYCLICAL SUPPORT FACILITY   2\n4\n   \n \n \nAccess Criteria  Indicators  ADB Staff Assessment    \nA\n1. Adverse impact    The  global  financial crisis  and  the  recession  have  had significant  adverse impacts  on  the  pp\ne\nof the global  Philippine economy. This is manifested in a number of ways: collapse in exports, stagnating  n\nd\neconomic crisis  inflow of remittances, and decreased tourist arrivals, all leading to recessionary conditions by the  ix\nfirst quarter of 2009. Job vacancies have declined and unemployment increased. ADB staff   2 \nestimate  poverty  could  rise  by  1.4  million  people  in  the  absence  of  the  countercyclical \nexpenditure program. \n  Economic growth  First quarter GDP growth on a year-on-year basis was 0.4%. The seasonally adjusted quarter-\non-quarter growth rate was \u20132.3%. The index of leading economic indicators entered negative \nterritory  in  the  first  quarter  of  2009  and  deteriorated  in  the  second  quarter  suggesting \nrecessionary conditions.  \n  Exports  Exports fell by 40% (year-on-year) from December 2008 to April 2009.   \n  Remittances  Remittances slowed to 2.5% growth in the first 4 months of 2009 (year-on-year) compared to \n15% growth in 2008. In per capita growth terms, remittances stagnated. Remittances have been \na major driver of poverty reduction and in the past allowed 4 million Filipinos to escape poverty. \nThe stagnant growth in per capita terms indicates potentially adverse impacts on welfare of \nfamilies.    \n  Fiscal deficit  The economic contraction in the first quarter contributed to a decline in tax collection in the first \nsemester of 2009. Taxes fell by 5.2% over the same period in 2008.   \n  Tax revenue  Declined by 5.2% in the first semester of 2009. \ncollection \n  Impact on  Spreads surged by 800 bps in October 2008 from an average of 220 bps prevailing prior to the \nsovereign bond  global financial crisis. Spreads gradually declined in the last 3 months, and are currently at \nspreads  320 bps.  \n2. Macroeconomic    The Government's response to mitigating the risk of the global financial crisis on the Philippine \nmanagement  financial sector and macroeconomy has been appropriate and responsive. It involves taking \npreemptive measures aimed at increasing liquidity in the domestic banking system, assuring \nconfidence of depositors, and strengthening the central bank's lender of last resort facility.  \n  Monetary policy  The Central Bank of the Philippines (BSP) has operated a prudent and responsive monetary \nand inflation  policy stance throughout the crisis. Earlier in 2008 it tightened monetary policy to counter the \nthreat of second-round inflationary pressures from the surge in global commodity prices. Later in \n2008, it switched to an expansionary stance to ensure sufficient liquidity in the banking system \nagainst a backdrop of rapidly falling inflation. Headline inflation decreased to 0.2% by the end of \nJuly, undershooting BSP's inflation target of 2.5%\u20134.5% for 2009. Core inflation fell to 3.3% in \nJuly on a year-on-year basis.

Current national government public debt is 56% and is \nanalysis  projected to rise to 57% in 2009. Nonfinancial public debt is at 59.9% and is expected to rise in \nline with national government public debt. Public debt is vulnerable to exchange rate depreciation \nas 40% of public debt is external. \n  Public financial  The  Philippines  has  a  public  financial  management  reform  agenda.  Key  reforms  include \nmanagement  introducing  a  medium-term  expenditure  framework  and  performance-based  management \nsystems  framework, and piloting internal control systems, among others supported under ADB TA, the \nDPSP subprogram 3, and other development partner assistance. \n  External balance  The external balance is very strong. Gross international reserves are at $39.5 billion, equivalent \nto 6.3 months import cover and 3 times higher than external debt maturing in 2009. \n3. Countercyclical    The Government's countercyclical expenditure program focuses on advancing infrastructure \nexpenditure  projects already in the investment pipeline, scaling up social assistance and public employment \nprogram  programs,  and  introducing  policy  measures  to  expedite  budget  disbursements.  Overall, \nnoninterest expenditure is programmed to rise by 20% in 2009 over 2008, providing a much-\nneeded boost to the economy. \n  Increased  The 2009 budgets for key infrastructure agencies were significantly increased. The Department \ninfrastructure  of Public Works and Highways budget increased by 13% in real terms over 2008, and the \nspending  Department of Agriculture's budget rose by 52% in real terms. To ensure the Government's \ncountercyclical program would be timely and effective by the second semester of 2009, these \nagencies agreed to obligate at least 60% of their total spending program for 2009 during the first \nsemester of 2009. \n  pSroocgiaral masss istance  Tpinrhcoeltue Gdceto  vttheheren  hmmuenongstet  hrv amusli ntsiegcraaatlbieolden   upfprroo imgtsr  aftlmhaeg,  ssheeiflpffe- escmotscp ialoolf y amtsheseins tte aacnsocsneiso tamannicdc  epc ookvnaeturrnatylca trrioeandn.u  (cSTtiEhoeAns -peKr )o ppgrrrooaggmrraasm mtos,             A\np\nfood for school program, family-based conditional cash transfer (CCT) program, comprehensive  p\ne\nlivelihood  and  emergency  employment  program  (CLEEP)  and  the  community-based  n\nd\ndevelopment program (KALAHI).   ix\n 2\nSource: Asian Development Bank.  2       \n5\n  \n ", "26     Appendix 3 \nSUMMARY OF DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT \n \n1.  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) undertook an Article IV Consultation with the \nPhilippines  in  November  2008.1 As  part  of  its  consultations,  the  IMF  undertook  a  debt \nsustainability assessment (DSA) based on different economic growth, interest rate, primary \nbudget balance, and exchange rate shocks. The IMF updated its DSA for the purposes of the \nPHI-CS. This appendix summarizes the pertinent findings of the DSA as well as the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) assessment of the countercyclical expenditure program support loan \nusing the IMF DSA as input.  \n \n2.  The Philippines' public sector debt is broadly sustainable, but short-term risks have \nincreased due to global financial instability. Public debt as a share of GDP has declined to ratios \nlast seen in the early 1990s, but remains high by regional standards. At the end of 2008, \nnational government public debt amounted to 56% of GDP, down from its peak of 83% in 2003 \n(Figure A3). Nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) debt declined to 59.9% from 101.0% during the \nsame period (Figure A3). A prudent borrowing strategy, including lengthening the average \nmaturity of debt to 7.1 years and moving to domestic financing;2 fiscal discipline (operating \nprimary budget surpluses); and sustained economic growth contributed to the rapid decline. \nDebt servicing costs as a share of national government budget revenues also declined from \n36.7% in 2005 to 22.6% in 2007, thereby freeing up substantial resources for priority spending \nsince 2007. However, at 8% of GDP, the Philippines\u2019 public debt servicing costs (amortization \nand interest payments) are high by regional standards. The debt amortization profile is lumpy \nwith $8.4 billion in external public debt maturing in 2009 and 2010, increasing pressure on the \nGovernment\u2019s gross financing needs (Figure A3).  \n \n3.  The updated IMF DSA indicates that public sector debt is broadly sustainable. In the \nbaseline scenario, no new fiscal measures are introduced over the medium term apart from \nplanned reduction of the corporate income tax rate in 2009. In this scenario, the nonfinancial \nsector public debt initially rises to about 65% in 2009/2010 and then declines back to 60% of \nGDP in 2014. While debt dynamics are favorable overall, they remain vulnerable to shocks, \nespecially exchange rate fluctuations, as 40% of public debt is external. For example, the IMF \nsimulated a one-time permanent real depreciation of 30%, which led to a 20 percentage point \nincrease in the external debt ratio from 2009, which would remain close to 80% in the medium \nterm. The assessment also notes rising resilience to interest rate and growth shocks. Given the \nlengthening of maturities and increasing utilization of domestic financing, external debt is less \naffected by world interest rates and domestic growth shocks. It is only moderately affected by \nnoninterest shocks to the current account. The DSA also simulates the impact of lower primary \nbudget surpluses on debt over the medium term. It assumes a reduction in the average surplus \nfrom 2.7% of GDP to 1.3%. Under this scenario, the NFPS debt would be 64% in 2014. The \nvarious scenarios are summarized in Table A3, with the baseline NFPS debt at 60% of GDP by \n2014. \n \n4.  Implications of the Countercyclical Support Facility Loan.

Two  principal  repayments,  each  of  \n$250 million, will be made in the fourth and fifth year, i.e., 2013 and 2014. The loan is equivalent \nto 0.3% of GDP, suggesting that in general the underlying sustainability scenarios are not \nsignificantly impacted by the loan.  \n \n                                                 \n1  IMF. 2009.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) country strategy and program 2005\u20132007 for the \nPhilippines identifies three key priorities for ADB assistance to ensure a strategically focused \nprogram.1 Program  selectivity  was  guided  by  country-specific  constraints\u2014macroeconomic \ninstability (fiscal consolidation and public financial management [PFM]), investment climate, and \nsocial  sectors.  ADB  operations  were  designed  to  address  these  constraints  under  three \ncorresponding  pillars  in  a  comprehensive  and  integrated  approach  to  development.  The \nDevelopment Policy Support Program (DPSP), approved by the ADB Board of Directors on 8 \nFebruary  2007,  operationalizes  the  strategy  by  providing  an  umbrella  operation  that \ncomplements and reinforces ADB\u2019s sector program loans and projects. The DPSP, structured \nas a program cluster, aims to help the Government achieve its medium- to long-term goals of \nsustained high economic growth of 6%\u20137% per annum, lower unemployment, and poverty \nreduction. \n \n2.  To achieve these objectives, the DPSP undertakes the following strategic reforms: \n \n(i)  Improve  fiscal  sustainability,  maintain  macroeconomic  stability,  and  improve \ncreditworthiness by enhancing the quality of fiscal management by (a) increasing \ntax  revenues  annually  through  tax  policy  reforms;  (b)  strengthening  tax \nadministration  and  enforcement,  and  reducing  revenue  leakages  through \nimproved governance; (c) reducing inefficient spending to permit increased social \nand  poverty-related  spending;  and  (d)  strengthening  the  debt  management \nstrategy  to  manage  government  contingent  liabilities  and  risks  prudently. \nSubprogram 3 of the DPSP aims to maintain macroeconomic stability under the \ncurrent  adverse  global  financial  environment  by  reassuring  depositors' \nconfidence in the domestic banking system. \n(ii)  Enhance governance in PFM by (a) improving PFM from budget preparation \nthrough  to  budget  execution,  accounting,  recording,  and  reporting; \n(b) strengthening  performance  management  and  improving  public  service \ndelivery;  (c)  reforming  procurement;  and  (d)  implementing  anticorruption  and \nenforcement  strategies  for  revenue-collecting  agencies  and  key  procurement \nagencies. Subprogram 3 sustains critical public expenditures while maintaining \nbudget discipline to mitigate the poverty impacts of the deceleration of growth. \n(iii)  Improve the investment climate and promote rural development by (a) clarifying \nand strengthening the legal and regulatory framework for investments and trade, \n(b)  facilitating  infrastructure  development  through  greater  public\u2013private \nparticipation and greater coordination of public infrastructure investments, and \n(c) improving rural\u2013urban connectivity. \n(iv)  Enhance human capital and social inclusion by improving the policy framework \nfor social protection, sustaining real spending on health and education, improving \ntargeting  of  programs,  piloting  the  conditional  cash  transfer  program  tied  to \nperformance outcomes in child education and health, refining public employment \nprograms, and establishing a national poverty monitoring and response system \nto help mitigate the impact of the economic slowdown on poverty. \n \n3.  Key features of the DPSP include (i) three single-tranche operations from 2006 to 2009, \nwith a well-defined, medium-term framework specified at the outset and including completed \nhigh-impact  reforms  prior  to  consideration  by  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors;  (ii)  triggers  for \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

In this way, the DPSP provides a \ncoherent medium-term reform strategy with three discrete but linked subprograms and a strong \nemphasis on performance, as the decision on whether to proceed with the next subprogram is \ncontingent on overall satisfactory performance of the triggers. It recognizes the necessity for \nflexibility in the reform measures, with provisions for incorporating lessons and responding to \nchanges in the external environment in the design of downstream subprograms.  \n \n4.  The DPSP has the following four phases: \n \n(i)  Subprogram  1.  Financed  by  ADB  ($250  million)  in  2007,  it  supported  the \nGovernment\u2019s  fiscal  consolidation  program  creating  the  basis  for  continuous \npolicy dialogue and engagement during 2007\u20132009. \n(ii)  Subprogram 2. Financed by ADB ($250 million) with parallel financing from the \nGovernment  of  Japan  ($100  million),  it  supported  the  Government's  fiscal \nsustainability  program  and  efforts  to  strengthen  governance  in  PFM  and \nprocurement. \n(iii)  Subprogram 3. The present phase, to be financed by ADB ($250 million) with \nparallel  financing  from  the  Government  of  Japan,  increases  the  focus  on \ninstitutionalizing  governance  programs  such  as  the  anticorruption  revenue \nprograms  in  the  Bureau  of  Internal  Revenue  and  Bureau  of  Customs,  the \ninvestment climate, and the social sectors.  \n(iv)  Postprogram  monitoring.  In  response  to  the  global  economic  crisis,  an \ninnovation  added  at  the  subprogram  3  phase  is  a  postprogram  monitoring \nframework  (Table  A4).  The  Government  of  the  Philippines,  ADB,  and  the \nGovernment of Japan have agreed to a post-DPSP framework for 12 months to \ncreate  the  basis  for  continuous  policy  dialogue  and  engagement  during  the \ncritical period of 2009/10 prior to the formulation of a new government after the \nPhilippine presidential elections in May 2010. The monitoring framework focuses \non the Government's short-term plan advancing its reforms in fiscal policy, PFM, \nand selected areas in investment climate and poverty, supported by ADB, the \nGovernment of Japan, and other development partners' technical and program \nassistance.   \n \n ", "30     Appendix 4 \nTable A4: Postprogram Monitoring Framework \nFiscal Policy and  Investment Climate and \nMacroeconomic Stability  Public Financial Management  Poverty Reduction \n1.

Economic Contraction  \n \n1.  The economy slowed in the second semester of 2008 from an average growth of 4.6% in \nthe first semester to 3.8% in the entire year. It then contracted by 2.3% in the first quarter of \n2009 on a quarter-on-quarter basis (seasonally adjusted). The contraction was broad-based \nwith most major components of aggregate demand (exports, consumption, and investment) \ndeclining. Reflecting suppressed aggregate demand in the economy, inflation has fallen sharply \nfrom its peak of 12% in September 2008 to 0.2% in July 2009 on a year-on-year basis. The \ncollapse in exports and stalling household consumption (partly due to stalling remittances) were \nthe primary factors behind the economic contraction in the first quarter.   \n \nFigure A6: Output Gap and Inflation \n      (a) Potential and Actual Economic Growth 1970\u20132009  (b) Headline and Core Inflation Jan 2008 to July 2009 \n                                                                                                          (monthly rates, year-on-year) \n10 14\n8 12\n6\n10\n4\n8\n2\nth %6\nw\no 0\nr\n% g -219 19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19 20 20 20 20 4\n7 7 7 7 8 8 8 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n-40 3 6 9 2 5 8 1 4 7 0 3 6 9 2\n-6 0\nJFMAMJJASONDJFMAMJJ\n-1-08 an-08eb-08ar-08pr-08ay-08un-08ul-08ug-08ep-08ct-08ov-08ec-08an-09eb-09ar-09pr-09ay-09un-09ul-09\nGDP growth Potential growth Core Inflation Headline Inflation\n   \nNotes: The Philippines\u2019 potential economic growth rate is estimated using the Hodrick-Prescott filter, which estimates \na nonlinear trend in the economic growth data. The difference between the potential and actual growth figures is \ndefined as the output gap. Projected growth figures for 2009.  \nSources: Asian Development Bank, Central Bank of Philippines, National Economic Development Authority, National \nStatistical Coordination Board estimates. \n \n2.  Another way of looking at economic performance is the output gap, which measures the \ndifference between potential output and actual output measured in terms of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) growth. A small output gap would suggest that the economy is at its long-run \ntrend or full employment. If growth exceeds the potential growth rate (i.e., a positive output gap) \nthen it would suggest the economy risks overheating associated with above-trend inflation. If \nactual growth is below potential (i.e., a negative output gap) then this suggests an economic \ndownturn  usually  associated  with  below  trend  inflation.  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nestimates indicate potential economic growth in the range of 5%\u20136%. Figure A6 shows the \nemergence of a significant output gap in 2009, projected at 4%\u20135%, similar in magnitude to the \none that emerged in 2008. Inflation is subdued, indicative of suppressed aggregate demand.  \n \n3.  The  suppressed  aggregate  demand  extends  to  affecting  the  labor  market  through \nreduced hiring and increased unemployment. Lower income opportunities and unemployment \n ", "                            Appendix 6  33\n      \nalso lead to increased incidence of poverty. Unemployment increased from 7.3% in 2008 to \n7.6% in 2009. ADB staff estimate that the projected economic slowdown could increase the \nincidence of poverty by 1.4 million people based, on the assumption that the economy contracts \nby 0.5% in 2009 and the poverty economic growth relation is 0.16%.  \n \nB.   Impact of the Government's Countercyclical Public Spending Program   \n \n4.  Economic  Stimulus  Effects. In times of a negative output gap, governments may \nstimulate the economy through a combination of policy instruments such as (i) expansionary \nmonetary policy and therefore lowering interest rates to stimulate investment and consumption, \nand (ii) fiscal expansion through tax cuts and increasing discretionary public spending. An \nappropriate fiscal expansion will depend on its size relative to the output gap and the multiplier \n(or second-round effects) of the different components of the fiscal stimulus. Empirical evidence \nfor  other  countries  indicates  that  infrastructure  spending  has  the  largest  multiplier  effects, \nfollowed by cash transfers to poor families; tax breaks have the lowest multiplier effects as \nsome proportion will be saved. \n \n5.  The Government is using both instruments to stimulate the economy. In aggregate, the \nnational government budget deficit is projected at 3.2% of GDP or an expansion of 2.4% over \n2008 (budget deficit of 0.9% in 2008). This expansion is equivalent to about 40%\u201350% of the \nnegative output gap. The stimulus effect of the expansion will be less than 2.4% of GDP and \ndepends on the stimulus components and their multiplier effects and timing: \n \n(i)  The tax breaks of P36 billion are likely to expand GDP by less than this \namount as some proportion will be saved (multiplier less than 1.0). \n(ii)  The social assistance and labor-intensive infrastructure spending program of \nP160 billion are likely to stimulate the economy in the range of P160 billion\u2013\nP192 billion with a multiplier of 1.2 times of the initial disbursement. These \nprograms  are  likely  to  have  an  immediate  impact  due  their  short \ndisbursement periods. Some of the larger projects, however, will take up to \n12 months to have an impact due to longer procurement and disbursement \nperiods. \n(iii)  The  infrastructure  programs  of  government-owned  and  -controlled \ncorporations amounting to P100 billion could also stimulate the economy by \nup to P120 billion. Some of the projects of the larger corporations will also \ntake longer to have an impact.  \n \n6.  Poverty Impacts. The social assistance programs aim to mitigate the adverse effects of \nthe economy contraction on the poor and most vulnerable to the crisis. The conditional cash \ntransfer program covers 337,345 families, this is expected to be increased to 699,000 families in \n2009. The public employment programs currently cover more than 137,000 workers and are \nexpected to cover 373,000 once fully rolled out this year. The subsidized rice program has \nreached about 1.8 million families. Overall, these programs are reaching a significant proportion \nof those likely to be affected by the crisis (Table A6). However, some of these programs (such \nas the subsidized rice program) are not well targeted; this will undermine its effectiveness in \nthese areas.  \n \n \n ", " \nTable A6: Poverty Impact Assessment  3\n4\n   \nThe global economic crisis is likely to hurt the poor in the short and medium term through three channels. The first is the weak labor market as hiring activity across \nmost sectors has slowed and job destruction in the modern export sector increased unemployment in 2009. The second is through lower household incomes and  A\ntherefore lower consumer spending, affecting earnings of workers in the informal sector. The third is through reduced access of poor families to social services such as  p\np\neducation and health, which in turn may increase poverty incidence in the medium term. The Asian Development Bank estimatesthat poverty could rise by 1.4 million  e\nn\npeople. The Government's countercyclical public expenditure program is designed to mitigate the effects of the crisis on the poor by increasing spending in social  dix\nsectors, scaling up key social assistance programs, and accelerating spending on labor-intensive infrastructure programs.   \n6\n   \nChannel of Effect  Effects on the Poor \nGeneral  Specific  Direct Short Term  Indirect Short Term  Medium Run  Mitigation or Enhancement Measures \nLabor  Formal  The collapse in exports has  Job losses in the export  A slow economic  The fiscal stimulus is expected to partially mitigate the \nmarket   and  led to job losses in the  sector and the slowdown in recovery may create  economic contraction and job losses as follows: \ninformal  export-oriented modern  inflows of remittances has  persistent  (i)   The P160 billion stimulus package (increase spending \nsector  sector.

An economic slowdown or contraction in the order of \u20130.5% to 1.8% in 2009 will reduce per capita incomes ranging from \u20130.7% to \u20133.0%. This is \nexpected to increase poverty in the short term through a weak labor market and reduced household earnings. Over the medium term, a slow economic recovery will \ncreate persistently high unemployment and suppressed earnings in the informal sector as new labor market entrants outnumber new jobs created. This in turn will lead \nto persistently higher poverty. Structural poverty may persist as poor families' access to social services is reduced. A rebound in remittances from overseas Filipino \nworkers in 2010 would help mitigate the medium-term adverse effects. The Government's fiscal stimulus willpartially offset the unemployment and poverty impacts of \nthe crisis; however, an economic recovery of about 5%\u20136% in 2011 is necessary to ensure a sustained reversal of the adverse effects of theeconomic slowdown on \npoverty. \n \nTime dimensions. The increased spending for social assistance programs will have an immediate positive impact on the poor. The labor-intensive public employment \nprograms will have an immediate positive impact on the labor market and incomes of the poor. The larger infrastructure projects will impact the economy and create \njobs once the procurement process is completed and investments made, most likely in the second semester of 2009 and in 2010.  \nCrucial Assumptions \nThe multiplier effects of public spending range from 1.0 to 1.2 of the initial disbursement and tax multipliers from 0.8 to 1.0. The Government advances procurement \nand is able to make substantial progress to front loading public spending to 60% of the annual budget of the major procurement agencies (the Department of Public \nWorks and Highways,  Department of Education, Department of Agriculture, and Department of Transportation and Communication) in the first semester of 2009.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CCT = conditional cash transfer. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n          A\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n 6\n3         \n5\n  \n ", "36   Appendix 7 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \nCountry/Project Title: Countercyclical Support Loan for the Philippines \n \nLending/Financing  Countercyclical Support  Department/  Southeast Asia Department/ \nModality:  Facility  Division:  Financial Sector, Public Management, and Trade Division \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.   Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Philippines. The Countercyclical Support (PHI-CS) loan \nprovides financing support to the Government's countercyclical public expenditure program aimed at stimulating the economy, \nprotecting spending in the social sectors, and scaling up flagship social assistance programs to protect vulnerable groups in \nthe community from adverse impacts of the global financial crisis. The national government budget does not have automatic \nstabilizers embedded on the expenditure side of the budget. Therefore it had to introduce a countercyclical expenditure \nprogram focusing on advancing infrastructure projects already in the investment pipeline, scaling up social assistance and \npublic employment programs, and introducing policy measures to expedite budget disbursements. Overall, noninterest \nexpenditure is programmed to rise by 20% in 2009 over 2008 providing a much-needed boost to the economy. The 2009 \nnational budget substantially increases spending on the social sectors. The Department of Social Welfare and Development's \nbudget has doubled in real terms (i.e., inflation-adjusted) compared with its 2008 budget (primarily for funding the conditional \ncash transfer program); education expenditure has increased by 10% in real terms; and health spending by 19% in real terms. \nOverall, spending on the social sectors has increased from 27% of the budget in 2005 to 31% in 2009.  \n \nThe PHI-CS loan supplements Asian Development Bank (ADB) program loans to the Philippines and in particular the \nDevelopment  Policy  Support  Program  (DPSP)  cluster.  The  DPSP  policy  areas  largely  correspond  with  those  of  the \nGovernment as spelled out in the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan 2004\u20132010, which focuses on five core areas: \n(i) economic growth and job creation, (ii) energy dependency and power reforms, (iii) social justice and basic needs, (iv) \neducation and youth opportunities, and (v) anticorruption measures and governance. The plan\u2018s mission is to \u201cfight poverty by \nbuilding prosperity for the greatest number of Filipino people.\u201d  \n \nThe Government has made substantial progress in addressing fiscal consolidation and in 2008 shifted focus to ensuring \nsustainable fiscal policy by enhancing tax revenues over the longer term. This is necessary to increase social expenditures. \nHowever, the global financial crisis and second-round effect of devastated external demand has hurt the Philippine economy. \nFiscal pressures come from two sources: (i) increased public demand for additional social spending to mitigate poverty \nimpacts, and (ii) a decline in budget revenues in the first quarter of 2009. The challenge faced by the Government is to protect \nrecent gains in social expenditures, plus provide additional assistance through its social programs such as the conditional \ncash transfer program; provide a fiscal stimulus through increased infrastructure spending; and ensure medium-term debt \nsustainability. Consequently, the national government budget deficit will rise to 3.2% of gross domestic product this year and \n2% in 2010. This protects critical public spending and ensures fiscal discipline.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1.  Key Issues. The apparent recessionary conditions in the Philippine economy threaten to reverse recent gains in reducing \nunemployment, which steadily declined during the last 2 years. Most recently, unemployment increased from 7.3% to 7.6%. \nEconomic growth in 2009 is estimated at -0.5%\u20131.8%, this translates to a decline in per capita income of \u20132.5% to \u20130.2%. \nThis would result in an increase in the incidence of poverty. A decrease in remittances would add to poverty. Mitigating the \npoverty impacts, the Government piloted the CCT program with 337,345 families in 2008 and 2009, and is expected broaden \nthe program to 699,000 families in 2009. The experience of Indonesia with its unconditional cash transfer has been positive in \nterms of keeping vulnerable families out of poverty during hard times such as now. \n \n2. Design Features. The PHI-CS loan will provide budget support for the Government's countercyclical public expenditure \nprogram in infrastructure and the social sectors. It aims to ensure predictability in budget financing for 2009 as a larger \nnational government budget deficit is required than initially projected.  \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Lending  \nThe PHI-CS loan supports the Government's countercyclical public expenditure program for 2009. The program includes the \nhunger mitigation program, self-employment assistance kaunlaran (SEA-K) program, food for school program, family-based \nCCT  program,  and  comprehensive  livelihood  and  emergency  employment  program  (CLEEP).  These  programs  are  a \ncombination of short-term programs to mitigate the worst effects of the crisis on the most vulnerable people in the community \nand longer-term programs aimed at addressing causes of poverty such as limited access to education and health services for \nchildren. \n \n ", "                                          Appendix 7  37\n      \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nADB assessments suggest that the possible decline in per capita income this year and increase in unemployment and poverty \nare cyclically aligned to the economic downturn and in this regard will be short term\u2014around 1\u20133 years\u2014assuming the \neconomy begins recovery next year. If the global economy is slow to recover, or the recovery itself is weak then the poverty \nand unemployment effects will be longer. Key will be the magnitude of the recovery and growth of remittances from overseas \nFilipino workers. As of the first quarter of 2009, remittances remain flat and are expected to decline by 4%\u20136% over the next 3 \nquarters. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nFor the PHI-CS loan in parallel with the DPSP process, extensive consultations were held with a wide range of stakeholders, \nincluding private sector, civil society groups, and development partners. The key forum is the Philippines Development Forum, \nwhich meets twice a year, although working groups meet more often. The mission attended various working group meetings. \nUnder the technical assistance for competitiveness (attached to DPSP subprogram 1), in February 2009 the mission engaged \na research institute to carry out a survey of 500 households and 1,300 individuals to solicit information on income, \nexpenditure, and employment experience. A second survey of the same households and an additional 500 individuals will be \ncarried out in July 2009 for the same purpose as well as solicit information about the impact of the crisis on household welfare \nand specific social sector issues related to health and education. \n \n2.
