This  pilot  project \nprovides  a  holistic  solution  for  integrated  urban  mobility,  bearing  a  demonstration  effect  as  no \nmodern mass transit system exists in Bangladesh yet. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nCurrent status. Bangladesh was ranked 146th out of 187 countries in the 2011 Human \nDevelopment Index, and Dhaka is consistently ranked one of the world\u2019s most unlivable cities in \nthe Global Liveability Report.4 Traffic congestion and air pollution play a major role in these poor \nrankings.5 Greater Dhaka is one of the fastest-growing megacities and one of the most densely \npopulated  cities  in  the  world.  Since  2000,  its  population  has  more  than  doubled  and  it  is \nprojected to grow from 17 million in 2012 to 25 million in 2025. Such high density in a city with \nlimited  inhabitable land\u2014owing  to the  city\u2019s  topography,  limited  infrastructure,  and  low  level  of \npublic  services\u2014results  in  tremendous  congestion  and  constrains  the  UTS\u2019  ability  to  provide \nmobility  for  all  people.  Car  ownership  and  usage  are  still  low  because  of  low  disposable \nincomes,  but  these  figures  are  increasing  fast  with  a  growing  middle  class.  With  an  annual \nmotorization growth of 8%, there could be up to half a million cars in 2025, increasing local air \npollutants and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the transport sector. \n \nWithout better planning and strategy, the metropolitan area will keep on sprawling north \n4. \nand south without order along the existing axis. The main issue for Dhaka\u2019s urban development \nlies in its fringes, where most of the urban sprawl and pauperization take place. Concepts like \nsatellite  cities,  city  clusters,  and  transit-oriented  development  have  to  be  implemented  to \norganize  the  urban  growth  and  public  spaces  toward  improved  living  conditions  and  climate \nchange  mitigation.  To  ensure  a  sustainable  future  for  Dhaka,  public  transport  focused  on \npeople\u2019s mobility needs and accessibility has to be improved and given priority over simple road \nprojects. International experience documents well that interventions that promote nonmotorized \ntransport (NMT), a modal shift from private vehicles to public transport, and integration of land-\nuse and transport planning also help lower GHG emissions in the long run. Project preparation \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  TA:  ADB.  2011.  Technical  Assistance  to  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for Preparing the Greater Dhaka Sustainable Urban Transport Project. Manila. \n3  The UTS refers to specific characteristics of people transportation (transport modes, traffic management, level of \norganization) and the resulting major issues (level of congestion, pollution) in Greater Dhaka. A sustainable UTS is \ndefined as in ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative\u2014accessible, safe, environment-friendly, and affordable. \n\n4   United  Nations  Development  Program.  2011.  Human  Development  Report  2011.  New  York;  and  The  Economist \n\nIntelligence Unit. 2012. Global Liveability Report. London.    \n\n5  Air  pollution  is  proven  to  be  a  leading  cause  of  mortality,  especially  in  Dhaka  where  particulate  matter  above \n10 microns  (PM10)  has  been  identified  as  a  primary  pollutant,  with  a  level  significantly  above  World  Health \nOrganization guidelines (50 milligram per cubic meter) for around 100 days per year over a 7-year period. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nfrom \n\nGCC \n\nis  being  created \n\n \nstudies  indicate  that  out  of  six  suburban  corridors  analyzed,  the  corridor  connecting  the \nemerging GCC (over 80% of its length) with DNCC (over 20% of its length), from Gazipur to the \ninternational airport, has the best potential to organize urban development and support a mass \ntransit infrastructure; and that BRT is the most cost-effective mass transit mode for this corridor.  \n \nthe  merger  of  Tongi  and  Gazipur  pourashavas \n5. \n(municipalities)  as  a  satellite  city  on  the  northern  edge  of  Dhaka  with  an  estimated  official \npopulation  of  1  million,  and  a  large  floating  population.  The  area  is  a  garment  hub,  with  272 \nfactories in the immediate vicinity of the corridor employing about 1 million workers. This adds to \nthe  high  levels  of  demand  for  travel.  GCC\u2019s  current  traffic  is  characterized  by  the  following \nmodal split: (i) 22% of trips are made by private modes; (ii) 40% by public transport (buses); and \n(iii)  38%  are  nonmotorized,  made  on  foot  or  by  cycle-rickshaws.  The  high  level  of  congestion \nand  pollution  result  from  (i)  rapid  motorization,  (ii)  a  weak  road  network,  (iii)  weak  traffic \nmanagement  to  organize  many  competing  modes, (iv) lack  of transport demand management, \nand (v) inefficient public transport services. Close to 4,900 large and mini buses run through the \nproject  corridor,  25%  of  which  do  not  have  a  proper  permit;  they  are  shared  between  61 \nlicensed city routes operated by 45 companies, mostly private, and 38 intercity routes. The bus \nfleet is in poor condition; bus stops are rudimentary, without information on schedule or itinerary; \nthe  ticketing  system  is  not  developed;  and  operators  compete  for  passengers,  worsening \ncongestion  and  impairing  safety.  The  situation  in  road-based  traffic  collisions  is  deteriorating, \nmostly  affecting  pedestrians  (the  poorest)  who  represent  more  than  half  of  road  accident \nfatalities in DNCC and GCC streets. This safety issue becomes even more acute when looked \nat from a gender perspective: 80% of garment workers are women, mostly commuting on foot.  \n \n6. \nAlignment with country strategy. The project will support the government\u2019s Sixth Five-\nYear  Plan  2011\u20132015  and  the  country  partnership  strategy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB).  It  addresses  (i)  green  growth,  (ii)  climate  change  mitigation,  and  (iii) inclusive  social \ndevelopment. 6 It  will  contribute  to  national  priorities  to  make  Dhaka  more  livable  and  safe, \ndevelop green urban infrastructures, boost private sector investment, and foster gender equity. \nIt  complies  with  some  of  the  recommendations  of  the  Strategic  Transport  Plan  for  Dhaka, \napproved by the government in 2008.7 The project is also well aligned with ADB\u2019s Sustainable \nTransport  Initiative. 8 Lessons  from  past  assistance  have  been  incorporated  into  the  project \ndesign, notably the need to strengthen good governance and government agencies\u2019 capacities \nfor project implementation, the need for a gradual approach to sector reform and organizational \narrangements, as well as the need to expand support for private sector development. \n \n7. \nDevelopment  partnership. Close coordination will be ensured with other development \npartners in the urban transport sector. The World Bank is currently studying the feasibility of the \ncontinuation of the selected BRT route from the airport into Dhaka city center. Both sections will \nbe integrated and will lead ultimately to a 40 km long mass transit corridor. Japan International \nCooperation  Agency  recently  undertook  the  feasibility  study  of  a  mass  rapid  transit  (or  metro) \nsystem.  Potential  synergy  can  be  found  with  this  project,  notably  in  capacity  building  and \nnecessary organizational developments to improve Dhaka\u2019s UTS management. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n8. \nThe project impact will be to develop a sustainable UTS in DNCC and GCC. The project \noutcome  will  be  to  improve  the  public  transport  system  of  DNCC  and  GCC,  benefiting  a \npopulation of 1 million.  \n                                                \n6  Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission. 2011.

Interest  during  construction  for  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nloans has been computed at 1% for Asian Development  Fund (ADF) (both soft and hard terms), and 0.9% for \nordinary capital resources (OCR) (including a spread of 0.4% for the OCR loan). There is a 0.15%  per annum \ncommitment charge for the ADB OCR loan, and no commitment charges for ADB ADF loans. All charges for the \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement loan are included in the interest rate. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTo help finance the project, the government has requested the following loans from ADB:  \nA $100 million loan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. This loan will have a   \n(i) \n25-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  7  years,  an  annual  interest  rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year (the interest and \nother  charges  during  construction  to  be  capitalized  in  the  loan),  and  such  other \nterms and conditions set forth in the  ordinary capital resources loan agreement. \nThe government has provided ADB with (a) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility based on these terms and conditions, \nand (b) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and \nnot made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \nTwo loans in various currencies, one in an amount equivalent to SDR29,179,000 \nmillion  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  soft  terms, and another  in the \namount equivalent to SDR9,726,000 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \nwith hard terms. The two loans will have a 32-year term including a grace period \nof  8  years,  an  interest  charge  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and \n1.5% per annum thereafter, and other terms and conditions set forth in the Asian \nDevelopment Fund loan agreement. \n\n(ii) \n\n \n14. \nADB loans in the amount of $160 million, or 62.7% of the total project investment cost, \nwill be used to finance (i) large civil works packages for the corridor restructuring, such as those \ndescribed  in  para.  9  and  footnote  9;  (ii)  vehicles  and  equipment;  (iii)  consulting  services, \nincluding  surveys  and  capacity  building;  (iv)  a  compensation  mechanism  and  fleet  scrapping \nprogram for bus operators; (v) SPO\u2019s operating costs during the construction period; (vi) media \nand  community  awareness  campaigns;  (vii)  interest  charge  during  implementation;  and  (viii) \ntransportation and insurance costs. The government\u2019s financing of $45.4 million, or about 17.9% \nof  the  total  project  cost,  will  be  used  to  finance  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  taxes  and \nduties, and a small part of civil works and SPO operating costs. \n \n15. \nThe  government  has  also  sought  a  loan  from  AFD  of  about  $45  million  equivalent  to \nfinance  part  of  the  project.  The  AFD  loan  will  have  the  following  conditions:  (i)  a  20-year \nmaturity,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  (ii)  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  the  European Interbank Offered Rate-based  lending  facility  plus  150  base \npoints  per  annum.  A  front-end  fee  and  a  commitment  charge  are  included  in  the  proposed \ninterest rate. The AFD cofinancing will be partially administered by ADB.11 \n  \nThe  government  has  also  requested  a  $4.6  million  grant  from  the  GEF  to  help finance \n16. \npart  of  the  project.  The  GEF grant  cofinancing  will  be  administered  by  ADB,  and  will  be  used \nmostly to finance energy-efficient street-lighting, and part of the acquisition of the BRT bus fleet. \n \n17. \n \n                                                \n11  AFD will confirm its participation in the financing within 2 month after approval by the ADB Board of Directors. \n\nThe financing plan is in Table 2. \n\n4 \n\n \n13. \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \u2013 ADF (soft terms) \nAsian Development Bank \u2013 ADF (hard terms) \nAsian Development Bank \u2013 OCR \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement \nGlobal Environment Facility \nGovernment \n\n \n\nTotal \n\n \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n45.00 \n15.00 \n100.00 \n45.00 \n4.60 \n45.40 \n255.00 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n17.60 \n5.90 \n39.20 \n17.70 \n1.80 \n17.80 \n100.00 \n\nADF = Asian Development Fund, OCR = ordinary capital resources. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n18. \nthe PAM (footnote 11). The Roads Division, under the Ministry of Communications, will  be the \nexecuting agency and will also be responsible for the overall coordination and supervision of the \nproject. A project management unit (PMU) will be established at the Roads Division, headed by \na  project  coordinator,  and  supported  by  the  project  management,  coordination,  and  capacity \nbuilding (PMCCB) consultants. \n \n19. \nThe  project  will  be  implemented  by  three  government  agencies:  (i)  the  Roads  and \nHighways  Department  (RHD)  will  implement  the  main  corridor  restructuring,  excluding  the \nelevated section, and will prepare the PPP scheme to finance the BRT terminal near the airport; \n(ii) Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA), whose mandate includes all matters related to elevated \nstructures  of  1500m  or  over,  will  implement  the  4.5  km  elevated  section,  integrating  the  new \nTongi  bridge  and  the  Abdullahpur  intersection  overpass;  and  (iii)  the  Local  Government \nEngineering Department (LGED) will implement the BRT depot in Gazipur and small municipal \ninfrastructure  improvements  (local  roads,  drains,  and  markets).  A  project  implementation  unit \n(PIU) will be established in each of these implementing agencies, headed by a full-time project \ndirector.  The  PIUs  will  receive  support  from  the  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction \nmanagement  (EPCM)  consultants,  and  RHD\u2019s  PIU  will  be  assisted  by  a  nongovernment \norganization (NGO) to implement the resettlement plan. \n \nThe  government  is  establishing  an  SPO  as  a  corporation,  100%  owned  by  the \n20. \ngovernment,  in  accordance  with  the  Companies  Act,  1994.  Its  board  will  be  chaired  by  the \nsecretary of the Roads Division, and will include directors from public and private organizations, \nas recommended by ADB. The SPO, tasked as the fourth implementing agency, will implement \nmost  activities  under  output  2  and  will  receive  support  from  the  PMCCB  consultants  and  the \noperational design and business model (ODBM) consultants. During project implementation and \nuntil revenues from BRT operations can finance all SPO operating costs, the project will finance \nSPO staff salaries, the lease, and other recurrent costs for the SPO office. All three PIUs and \nconsultants  will  be  located  in  the  office  leased  by  the  project  for  the  SPO.  After  the  project  is \ncompleted, all BRT assets will be transferred as a grant under the ownership of the SPO, which \nwill manage and monitor the BRT operations and maintenance with the private sector.  \n \nConsultants\u2019 recruitment will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \n21. \nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Four consulting packages (PMCCB, \nEPCM, ODBM, and NGO) will be procured under the project. At the government\u2019s request, the \nconsulting firms will be selected by ADB, and engaged and employed by the executing agency. \nAll  procurement  of  works,  goods,  and  services  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). The consulting services and the \nagreed  procurement  plan,  indicating  contract  packages  and  procurement  procedures,  are \ndescribed in detail in the PAM. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n\n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nJune 2012\u2013June 2017 \n30 June 2017 \n\nInter-Ministerial Project Steering Committee \nCochair: Secretary, Roads Division, and Secretary, Bridges Division, both \nunder the Ministry of Communications \nMembers: Representative of each project stakeholder (to be determined)  \nRoads Division (project management unit, 9 staff) \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)   Key implementing agencies  RHD, BBA, LGED, and Special Project Organization \n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nRHD (19 staff), BBA (13 staff), and LGED (6 staff) \nInternational \ncompetitive bidding \n\n9 contracts \n\nProcurement \n\nAbove $1,000,000 for \nworks, above $500,000 \nfor goods \n$100,000 or less \n\n \n\nShopping \nNo national competitive bidding  \n\nmultiple contracts \n\nConsulting services (4 packages)  QCBS - 90:10, and QBS  1,224 person-months \nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \nDisbursement  \n\nAdvance contracting and retroactive financing is proposed for the recruitment \nof the four consulting packages and recurrent costs. a \nThe  ADB  and  AFD  loan  and  GEF  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom  time  to  time)  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  between  the \ngovernment and ADB.

The \nproposed  capacity  development  TA  will  focus  on  increasing  the  density  and  location  of  public \nfacilities along the BRT corridor, notably around the BRT stations, following the transit-oriented \ndevelopment  concept.  The  second  output  will  be  to  draft  enhanced  traffic  management  and \nparking regulations, and conduct a large capacity building program on enforcement for the traffic \npolice, and awareness campaigns on proper traffic behaviors and road safety.12  \n \n23. \nThe TA is estimated to cost $1 million and will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan \nFund  for  Poverty  Reduction,  and  administered  by  ADB.  The  executing  agency  will  be  LGED, \nand the implementing agencies will be GCC and the traffic police. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nTechnical viability has been confirmed through the project preparatory TA. The feasibility \n24. \nstudy and preliminary design for the BRT corridor were completed in May 2011. Based on the \nconsultants\u2019 recommendations, the government chose a high-capacity scenario to respond to an \nincreasing  transport  demand  (from  100,000  to  300,000  passengers  per  day)  once  the  World \nBank section of the BRT corridor starts to operate. Two segregated lanes per direction for the \n                                                \n12 TA:  Transit-Oriented  Development  and  Improved  Traffic  Management  in  GCC  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\n \nBRT  on  40%  of  the  corridor  length  are  needed,  and  will  require  elevating  a  4.5 km  section  in \nTongi where the right-of-way is too narrow. The structure will integrate the new eight-lane Tongi \nbridge, and an overpass. BBA has been chosen to implement these complex civil works. \n \n25. \nThe  project  has  some  advanced  technical  aspects  relating  to  BRT  operations  and  ITS \n(fare  collection,  and  passenger  information),  with  technology  choices  based  on  efficient  and \nproven designs. The SPO will procure and own all ITS and rolling stock (articulated buses) for \nthe BRT, while their operation and maintenance (O&M) will be outsourced to the private sector, \nand evaluated against criteria included in performance-based contracts. LGED will procure, and \nthe  traffic  police  will  undertake  O&M  of  streetlights  and  all  equipment  related  to  traffic \nmanagement (traffic lights, closed-circuit television cameras, and control center). Local capacity \nfor proper O&M of such systems and facilities will be strengthened under the project. \n \nAlthough the project does not finance directly any PPP component, it demonstrates how \n26. \nvarious  PPP  modalities  can  be  effectively  integrated  into  public  services  delivery  to  yield  high \nquality and high-value facilities operated and maintained to  a good standard. It seeks to apply \nPPP  principles  to  promote  some  of  its  core  aspects:  bus  operations\u2019  performance-based \ncontracting,  fare  collection  system  concession,  and  PPP-based  mixed  use  intermodal  hub \ndevelopment.  The  bus  operating  and  fare  collection  contracts  will  support  sustainable \noperations  of  the  BRT.  The  intermodal  transit  hub  will  represent  the  debut  of  PPP  real  estate \ndevelopment to deliver public infrastructure in Bangladesh. The fare collection concession can \nalso  provide  profit  sharing  between  concessionaire(s)  and  the  government.  The  PPP  plans \nassociated  with  the  project  are  a  timely  integration  with  the  overall  national  implementation  of \nthe  government\u2019s  policy  and  strategy  for  PPP  (August  2010)  as  one  of  the  first  projects \ncontemplated under the program.13 \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n27. \nThe project will contribute to improve public transport and traffic management, resulting \nin  less  congestion,  noise  pollution,  GHG  and  particulate  matters  emissions.  Coupled  with \ncapacity  development  and  awareness  programs  on  traffic  behavior  in  DNCC  and  GCC,  the \npublic  investment  will  have  a  significant  impact  on  environmental  and  public  health.  It  is \nestimated  that  carbon  dioxide  emissions  will  be  reduced  by  40,000  tons  per  year  from  the \nproject.  Opportunities  to  utilize  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism  and  obtain  carbon  credits \nfrom  emission  reductions  for  enhanced  revenue  streams  for  the  BRT  operations  are  available \nand assessed under the project. 14 \n \nThe  economic  analysis  was  conducted  assuming  the  following  benefits:  (i)  savings  in \n28. \nvehicle  operating  costs,  (ii)  journey  time  savings,  and  (iii)  increase  in  land  values.  Economic \ncosts were calculated based over a 30-year projection period, including a construction period of \n5 years. Three alternatives were analyzed: (i) excluding investments costs not directly related to \nBRT operations, (ii) excluding Tongi bridge investment costs, and (iii) comprising all investment \ncosts. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 18.4% for alternative (i), 17.2% for (ii), and \n15.1% for (iii). The corresponding net present values are $69.08 million for alternative (i), $59.94 \nmillion for (ii), and $35.60 million for (iii). The EIRR is higher than the economic opportunity cost \nof  capital  estimated  at  12.0%.  A  sensitivity  analysis  was  also  undertaken  with  the  following \nscenarios:  (i) capital  costs  increased  by  10%,  (ii)  O&M  costs  increased  by  10%,  (iii)  benefits \nreduced  by  10%,  (iv)  1-year  delay,  and  (v)  no  increase  in  land  value.  The  EIRRs  varied  from \n12.2% to 18.4%, the most sensitive risk factors being the lack of increase in land value and a 1-\nyear delay in project completion. However, in all cases, the EIRR remains above 12%.  \n                                                \n13 Public\u2013Private Partnership Opportunities (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 ADB. 2011.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n29. \nThe financial internal rate of return (FIRR) was estimated with the following assumptions: \n(i) a  project  implementation  period  of  5  years  from  2012;  (ii)  an  evaluation  period  of  30  years \nfrom  commission;  (iii)  2011  constant  prices;  (iv)  an  exchange  rate  of  Tk70  =  $1;  and  (v)  a \nweighted average cost of capital (WACC) estimated at 0.52%. Considering the initial investment \nas a subsidy, the FIRR is 16.5% and the corresponding net present value is $60.2 million. The \nFIRR is above the WACC in the base case scenario. An O&M cost increase of 10% decreases \nthe  FIRR  to  4.7%  and  a  revenue  reduction  of  10%  decreases  the  FIRR  to  1%;  both  are  still \nabove the WACC.15 \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nADB \n\nrequirements, \n\nfinancial  management  and  procurement \n\n30. \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines, have been discussed and agreed with all involved agencies. Financial \nmanagement and procurement capacity assessments were carried out in 2010 for LGED, RHD, \nand BBA, indicating that financial management practices in these agencies are generally sound. \nRisks  in  public  procurement,  corruption,  and  financial  management  for  the  implementing \nagencies will be mitigated through financial systems improvement and comprehensive capacity \nbuilding  provided  under  separate  projects  by  ADB  and  development  partners.  The  project  will \ncoordinate closely with those ongoing initiatives, currently in the initial stages, to cover potential \ngaps and avoid overlaps. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n31. \nwith  the  government.  Specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  in  the \nPAM.  Adequate  mitigation  measures  have  been  identified  and  incorporated  in  the  project \ndesign, such as (i) establishing a mechanism for regular voluntary disclosure of project-related \ninformation  to  citizens  through  media  awareness  campaigns;  (ii)  developing  and  updating  the \nproject  website \nimplementation,  procurement  and \nsafeguards; and (iii) establishing a grievance redress mechanism to ensure quick and effective \nrelief  in  corruption,  safeguards,  or  other  project-related  activities.  The  project  intends  to \nmaximize  transparency,  including  procurement  and  financing,  to  reduce  central  level  risks, \nincluding via a project website. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\ntransparency \n\nto  enhance \n\nin  project \n\n32. \nThe project will provide a high level of accessibility, mobility, safety and service reliability \nin  DNCC  and  GCC.  Direct  poverty  benefits  include  (i)  supporting  an  employer-based  cross-\nsubsidy  program  to  reduce  costs  of  transit  fares  for  low-income  workers,  particularly  garment \nemployees  within  the  corridor;  and  (ii)  employment  opportunities  during  construction  and \noperation of the BRT system. Indirect benefits include reduced health costs associated with less \nvehicular pollution and road accidents, as well as reduced travel times. The project is classified \neffective gender mainstreaming and a gender action plan has been prepared to address specific \ngender-related concerns, including dedicated bus seating for women and reserved commercial \nspaces at BRT stations for women-operated vendors. A community awareness and participation \nplan  has  been  prepared  to  encourage  awareness  building  and  public  participation  among  key \nstakeholders to ensure widespread, ongoing, and meaningful participation with an emphasis on \npoor  and  vulnerable households.16 The gender  action  plan  and  the  community  awareness and \nparticipation plan will be implemented with the assistance of an NGO and PMCCB consultants. \nMonitoring and reporting of progress will be ensured on a quarterly basis. \n  \n\n                                                \n15  Economic Analysis and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Summary  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Strategy,  Gender  Action  Plan,  and  Community  Awareness  and \n\nParticipation Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n\n33. \nEnvironmental  safeguards.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  environment.  An \ninitial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  including  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP) \nwas  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  government \nlaws. 17 The  IEE  concludes  that  no  significant  adverse  impacts  are  anticipated  and  that  net \nenvironmental benefits will be positive and large, including (i) improved air quality and health co-\nbenefits from clean fuel buses and reduced traffic and congestion, and (ii) improved community \nand pedestrian safety from better storm water drainage and energy-efficient street-lighting. The \nEMP  emphasizes  good  traffic  management  during  the  construction  period  to  ensure  limited \ndisruption  to  existing  traffic  flows  and  local  businesses.  Implementation  arrangements  ensure \nthat  the  PMU  and  PIUs  have  adequate  capacity  to  manage  environmental  impacts  through \nconsultant  support  and  capacity  building.  The  IEE  and  EMP  will  be  updated  during  detailed \ndesign and incorporated into bidding and contract documents to be implemented by contractors \nand monitored  by  EPCM  consultants  and  the  PMU.  An  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework was also prepared to address small improvements on municipal infrastructure to be \ndefined through detailed design after approval by the ADB Board of Directors.18 \n \n34. \nSocial safeguards. The project is classified category A for involuntary resettlement and \ncategory C for indigenous peoples. A resettlement plan was prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement and government laws, and disclosed.19 A total of 2,482 households \n(10,474  affected  persons)  will  be  impacted  by  the  project.  These  impacts  consist  primarily  of \nrelocating  informal  vendors  within  the  right-of-way;  only  a  small  portion  (2%)  of  the  overall \nimpacts  will  include  physical  relocation  from  housing.  The  resettlement  impacts  include  (i) \nrelocation  of  1,704  informal  vendors  conducting  businesses  within  the  right-of-way;  (ii) \nrelocation  of  46  non-titled  residential  settlers  along  the  northern  banks  of  the  Turag  River;  (iii) \npartial  physical  impacts  to  498 commercial  establishments  operating  within  the  corridor;  (iv) \npartial  loss  to  225  commercial  structures  situated  on  feeder  roads  near  junctions;  (v)  partial \nimpacts  to  6  industrial  establishments  along  the  corridor;  and  (vi)  strip  land  taking  of  private \nto  966  workers  during \nland. \npreconstruction activities. The two terminals and the depot are proposed on government-owned \nlands. Alternative locations for informal vendors and non-titled residential settlers were identified \nand  agreed  with  local  government  officials.  The  resettlement  plan  will  be  implemented  by  the \nPIUs, with the support of an NGO, and EPCM consultants who will provide a capacity building \nprogram to ensure the PIUs have adequate capacity to manage social impacts. Considering the \nurban  locations  of  these  subprojects,  no  impacts  to  indigenous  peoples  are  expected. \nMeaningful,  widespread  consultations  will  continue  with  all  communities  in  the  project  area.  A \nresettlement \ninfrastructure \nimprovements to be defined through detailed design after Board approval.20 \n \nF. \n\nframework  was  also  prepared \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nto  address  small  municipal \n\ntemporary  disruption \n\nincome  will  occur \n\nIn  addition, \n\nto \n\n35.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk  management  plan.21 As  major  risks  could  be  mitigated  to  a  manageable  level,  intended \nbenefits  and  impacts  of  the  project  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs.
