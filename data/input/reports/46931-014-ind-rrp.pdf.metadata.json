Most  live  in  rural  areas \noutside the reach of conventional electricity grid networks. Solar photovoltaic technology offers \na  clean  alternative  to  address  off-grid  access  to  electricity.  Effective  decentralized  energy \nsolutions  using  solar  photovoltaic  technology,  such  as  solar  home  systems  (SHSs)  and \ncommunity-scale  solar  micro  grids,  involve  significant  upfront  costs  for  rural  consumers  and \nhave limited market penetration.1 \n \n3. \nFrom  initial  discussions  with  Simpa,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  believes  that \nthe company offers a simple, affordable, and commercially sustainable clean energy solution to \naddress lack of electricity access in off-grid, largely rural areas. Moreover the successful initial \nrollout  of  SHSs  in  Karnataka  demonstrates  strong  market  demand  for  the  product.  ADB\u2019s \ninvestment will enable Simpa to scale up its operations, and ADB\u2019s knowledge and experience \nwill be valuable to the company as it expands its operations. The decentralized energy solution \ndeveloped  by  Simpa  has  strong  potential  for  replication  across  other  developing  member \ncountries (DMCs). With its strong focus on the underserved rural poor, the ADB investment will \nbe a market leading initiative that would build on ADB\u2019s strong presence in solar energy in India. \n \nB. \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n4. \nSimpa  offers  a  secure,  prepaid  payment  platform  to  make  simple,  affordable,  and \ninvestible clean energy solutions for underserved consumers in India. The \u201ctechnology + service \n+ finance\u201d platform leverages mobile phones to unlock demand from consumers, while providing \nrisk  mitigation  for  the  company  that  finances  the  solar  equipment.  The  technology  platform \ncomprises a very low-cost prepaid meter supported by sophisticated cloud-based software. The \ntechnology  can  be  embedded  in  standalone  products  such  as  an  SHS  and  is  also  offered  to \nsolar  micro  grid  developers  as  an  extremely  flexible  metering,  customer,  and  revenue \nmanagement solution.2 \n \n5. \nAn  SHS  consists  of  a  module,  a  battery,  a  charge  regulator,  and  compact  fluorescent \nand/or  light-emitting  diode  lamps.  Sometimes  other  appliances,  like  an  electric  fan,  can  be \nincluded in the SHS. Simpa has developed a metering solution comprising a device\u2014the Simpa \ncontroller\u2014that locks up the energy flowing out of the battery connected to the SHS, which the \nconsumer can unlock to the extent needed by purchasing energy credits from Simpa through a \nsimple  and  quick  recharge  process  based  on  the  mobile  telephony  platform.  The  Simpa \ncontroller is a small electronic device with a keypad for inputting data, such as recharge codes, \nand has a simple liquid crystal display showing the energy credit balance available for use. The \n                                                 \n1   Centre for Development Finance; World Resources Institute. 2010. Power to the People: Investing in Clean Energy \n\nfor the Base of the Pyramid in India. Chennai. \n\n2   A  micro  grid  is  a  localized  grouping  of  electricity  generation,  energy  storage,  and  electricity  demand  centers  that \n\noperates in isolation without connection to a traditional centralized transmission grid. \n\n\f2  \n \n\n \n\nSimpa  controller  is  integrated  into  a  metal  box  along  with  the  battery  and  the  solar  charge \nregulator; both are standard equipment in an SHS. \n \n6. \nA  customer  who  chooses  a  Simpa  metering  system-enabled  SHS  is  given  a  choice  of \npaying 10%, 20%, or 30% of the total cost of the SHS as a down payment, after which the SHS \nis installed on the customer\u2019s premises, typically on the roof of the house. After installation, the \ncustomer has a choice of how much energy credit to purchase from as low as Rs50 to as high \nas  Rs500.  A  portion  of  this  payment  goes  toward  repayment  of  the  capital  cost  of  the  SHS, \nwhile  the  rest  goes  to  Simpa  to  cover  the  costs  of  operation  plus  a  profit.  The  higher  the \nrecharge amount, the higher the proportion of the amount allocated for repayment of the capital \ncost  of  the  SHS.  Once  the  capital  cost  of  the  SHS  is  recovered  (typically  after  2\u20133  years), \ncustomers receive a code through a text message to unlock the SHS, after which they are not \nrequired to purchase any further energy credits and own the SHS outright. The pricing plan is \ncompletely flexible and can be customized to suit the customer\u2019s needs and ability to pay. Thus \nongoing energy expenditure is transformed into an asset purchase through Simpa\u2019s innovative \nsolution. \n \n7. \n \n8. \nSimpa has entered into partnership agreements with SHS vendors wherein vendors offer \nSimpa  controller-enabled  SHSs  under  the  pay-as-you-go  scheme  to  customers  who  would \notherwise not have considered buying an SHS due to the high upfront cost.  \n \n9. \nIn  addition  to  SHSs,  Simpa  offers  its  metering  solution  to  micro  grid  developers  as  an \nextremely  flexible  metering,  customer,  and  revenue  management  solution.  In  this  case,  the \nmicro  grid  developers  install  the  Simpa  metering  units  at  each  household  connected  to  the \nmicro grid and pay Simpa for ongoing revenue management services.. \n \n10. \n \nC. \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\n1. \n\nOwnership \n\n11. \nSimpa  was  established  in  November  2010  by  Paul  Needham,  Jacob  Winiecki,  and \nMichael  Macharg\u2014three  accomplished  and  highly  regarded  entrepreneurs  with  proven  track \nrecords.

Simpa\u2019s ability to develop partnerships with SHS vendors and micro grid \ndevelopers  is  critical  to  the  successful  execution  of  its  business  plan.  Simpa  will  need  more \nbusiness-to-consumer partners, many of whom are still small and emerging. In the business-to-\nbusiness segment, Simpa\u2019s potential partners are relatively new micro grid developers that are \nalso expanding their operations and are reliant on grants and subsidies.  \n \n25. \nSystem  tampering  risk.  Given  that  the  system  is  installed  at  the  customer\u2019s  house  in \nremote  rural  areas,  Simpa  will  have  difficulty  conducting  regular  physical  checks  to  prevent \ntampering.  Tampering  has  the  potential  to  allow  the  customer  to  access  electricity  without \npaying Simpa for the same, resulting in a revenue loss for Simpa.  \n \n26. \n \nAfter-sales  service. The SHS vendor and the micro grid developer are responsible for \n27. \nafter-sales  service  and  maintenance.  Typically  two  site  visits  per  year  are  included  under  the \npricing  package.  However  lack  of  proper  follow-up  by  the  SHS  vendors  could  generate  a  bad \nreputation for the reliability of SHSs, impacting their market penetration. \n \n28. \n \n29. \nGovernment subsidies for kerosene. India\u2019s total annual kerosene subsidy for lighting \nis  estimated  to  be  $2  billion.  Despite  high  levels  of  kerosene  subsidization,  SHSs  are  cost \neffective  options  for  consumers  in  the  long-term  as  evidenced  by  the  successful  pilot  in \nKarnataka.  However,  further  increases  in  subsidies  or  more  effective  policies  for  subsidized \nkerosene may promote continued usage of kerosene for lighting purposes. Kerosene subsidy is \na highly political subject as a majority of the consumers of kerosene are rural and low income \nhouseholds, a critical voter base for any political party. \n \n30. \n \n31. \nExpansion of conventional transmission grids. Demand for off-grid energy solutions \nmight  decrease  if  rural  consumers  are  connected  to  the  conventional  transmission  grid. \n\nConfidential information deleted.  \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\n\f5 \n\nHowever,  state  utilities  would  have  difficulty  raising  the  capital  for  expansion  of  transmission \ngrids  given  their  poor  finances  and  heavy  reliance  on  subsidies  to  maintain  existing \ntransmission  networks.  Moreover,  given  the  electricity  demand\u2013supply  mismatch,  rural  areas \nwould likely experience intermittent electricity supply even if connected to the grid. \n \n32. \nReach  of  mobile  networks.  The  reliability  and  reach  of  mobile  telecommunication \nnetworks in rural areas is crucial for successful implementation of the short messaging service \n(SMS)-enabled  metering  and  payment  system.  Any  disruption  in  the  mobile  network  could \ncause loss in revenue for Simpa. India has a well-developed mobile telecommunication network \nwith  more  than  930  million  mobile  phone  users  and  14  mobile  network  operators  as  of  June \n2012. \n \nCompetition.  Currently,  Simpa  is  the  sole  provider  of  an  SMS-enabled  payment  and \n33. \nmetering  system  for  SHS  and  micro  grids  in  India.  Future  entrants  could  take  market  share \naway from Simpa. As the first entrant in the market, Simpa has a strategic advantage through \nestablished relationships with SHS vendors and micro grid developers. Moreover the market for \noff-grid  energy  access  solutions  is  significant  enough  to  support  the  profitable  operations  of \nmultiple players. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nA. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n34. \nImpact.  The  project  will  contribute  to  increased  access  to  electricity  in  rural  India. \nAlthough not being measured, increased access to electricity will result in improved education, \nhealth,  and  productivity  outcomes.  Access  to  electricity  enables  children  to  study  beyond \nsunset.  Replacement  of  smoky  fuels,  such  as  kerosene,  with  clean  solar  energy  improves  air \nquality,  thereby  improving  respiratory  health  of  household  members.  Access  to  electricity  also \nimproves  productivity  and  contributes  to  increasing  rural  household  incomes.  Successful \nimplementation  of  the  project  across  India  will offer  opportunities  for  replication  across  DMCs. \nThe  investment  is  also  expected  to  have  a  positive  demonstration  effect  leading  to  increased \nprivate equity and venture capital funding for off-grid energy services in India. \n \n35. \nhouseholds by 2015, while delivering adequate returns for the private investors. \n \n36. \nof 29,000 new SHSs and 34,125 metering units for solar-powered micro grids by 2014. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs. Successful implementation of the project will result in the sale and installation \n\nOutcome.  The  project  will  result  in  increased  access  to  clean  energy  for  63,125  new \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n37. \nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and country strategy. The investment relates to two \ncore  focus  areas\u2014infrastructure  and  environment\u2014under  Strategy  2020,  wherein  ADB  is \ncommitted  to  expand  the  supply  of  energy  in  an  environmentally  sustainable  way. 4  The \ninvestment will directly contribute to the outcome of increasing the number of households with \naccess  to  electricity.  The  investment  is  aligned  with  the  India  country  partnership  strategy, \n2009\u20132012, one of the key outcomes of which is increased rural electrification.5 \n \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6  \n \n\n \n\nConsistency  with  the  energy  policy  and  Asia  solar  energy  initiative.  Access  to \n38. \nenergy  for  all  is  an  important  pillar  of  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy.  Maximizing  access  to  energy  for \neconomic  and  social  development  under  its  Energy  for  All  Initiative  is  part  of  ADB\u2019s  inclusive \ngrowth strategy. The initiative aims to share knowledge and to identify and scale up successful \nmodels  that  will  bring  energy  to  the  poor  across  Asia.  Within  the  region,  the  initiative  is \nsupporting  the  Energy  for  All  Partnership,  which  aims  to  extend  access  to  energy  to  an \nadditional 100 million people in Asia and the Pacific by 2015. The project is directly aligned with \nADB\u2019s Asia Solar Energy Initiative, which aims to help develop, finance, and commission 3,000 \nmegawatts of solar power generation capacity including off-grid projects in DMCs by May 2013. \n \n39. \nConsistency  with  ADB  operations.  The  project  strongly  complements  ADB\u2019s  current \nprivate  sector  initiatives  in  solar  energy  in  India.  In  April  2011,  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors \napproved  the  Solar  Power  Generation  Guarantee  Facility, 6  which  will  catalyze  commercial \nlending and private investment for smaller solar generation projects (less than 25 megawatts), \nwhile  the  Dahanu  Solar  Power  Project 7  (approved  in  November  2011)  and  the  Rajasthan \nConcentrating  Solar  Power  Project 8  (approved  in  March  2012)  aim  to  catalyze  private \ninvestment  in  larger  solar  generation  projects  with  a  capacity  greater  than  25 megawatts.  The \nproposed  equity  investment  extends  ADB  assistance  to  off-grid  solar  energy  solutions  making \nADB one of the leading financiers of solar power in India. This investment also highlights ADB\u2019s \nmultiproduct  approach  to  promoting  private  investment  in  solar  energy  and  its  ability  to \ncustomize based on market needs and associated risks. \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \n\n40. \nThe  investment  is  classified  under  category  C  for  impacts  on  the  environment, \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  Simpa\u2019s  business  activities  have  minimal  or \nno  adverse  environmental  impacts,  and  are  unlikely  to  entail  impacts  on  involuntary \nresettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  Simpa  will  apply  ADB's  prohibited  investment  activities \nlist, exclude all projects that will have adverse environment and social safeguards impacts, and \nensure that investments using ADB funds abide by applicable national laws and regulations and \ncomply  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  investment  documentation  will \ninclude  appropriate  provisions  requiring  Simpa  to  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and  take \nspecific  measures  in  relation  to  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standards,  in \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy.9 \n \n41. \nThe  investment  has  some  potential  gender  benefits.  Women  typically  bear  the  main \nresponsibility  for  caring  for  the  sick,  collecting  firewood  or  traveling  to  buy  fuel,  maintaining  a \nhygienic domestic environment, and bringing up children. The investment is expected to benefit \nwomen as access to clean energy within their homes will enable women to spend more time on \nother  productive  work.  However  as  the  purchase  of  an  SHS  is  voluntary,  the  investment  is \nclassified as having no gender elements.  \n \n\n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2011.
