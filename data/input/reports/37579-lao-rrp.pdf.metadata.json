However,  the  capacity  to \napply  sound  management  principles  and  practices  are  still \nincreasing  devolution  of \ndeficient,  particularly \nmanagement responsibilities to the provinces. \n \nThe  Project  will  address  institutional  and  capacity  building \nrequirements  (including  governance  improvements)  to  enable \nimproved management of the sector on a sustainable basis while \ncontributing  to  the  Government\u2019s  overall  objectives  of  enhancing \nagricultural \nof \nagriculture, and protecting the country\u2019s natural resources. Project \noutputs  comprise  (i)  capacity  built \nin  sector  management, \n(ii) investment \nresource  management  and  productivity \nenhancement, and (iii) an effective project management structure. \n \nThe  Lao  PDR  has  abundant  natural  resources  and  a  small \npopulation, of which over 80% is dependent on agriculture for their \nlivelihood. Significant numbers of indigenous peoples from a wide \nrange of linguistic groups live in upland areas to the north and in \nthe southern part of the Lao PDR along the border with Viet Nam. \nThey  forge  their  predominantly  subsistence  livelihoods  from \nrotational  cropping,  which  incorporates  a  heavy  dependence  on \nthe natural forest and water resources. The incidence of poverty in \nthese areas is over 60%, and is highest among ethnic groups. \n \nThe institutional and legal framework for sustainable and equitable \nmanagement of agriculture and natural resources (ANR) is weak. \nThis is evident in the ambiguity of policies and legislation, as well \nas  inadequate  professional  and  technically  trained  staff  and \n\ncommercialization \n\nin \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\nto \n\nis  actually \n\nthe  country\u2019s \n\nirrigation  areas \n\nrich  and  diverse \n\n(directly  contributing \n\nincreasing).  Adverse \n\nfacilities.  The  situation \n\nfacilities.  At  the  provincial  and  district  levels  where  most  ANR \nmanagement  decisions  are  taken,  there  is  a  deficit  of  expertise \nis  exacerbated  by  budgetary \nand \nconstraints  (generally  sufficient \nto  meet  staff  salaries,  but \ninsufficient for operational and development activities). \n \nThe capacity of the ANR sector to support traditional livelihoods is \ncoming  under  unprecedented  pressure  from  the  recent  influx  of \nforeign  direct  investment  (FDI)  and  consequent  granting  of  land \nconcessions. Allowing large-scale commercial development where \nthere  is  a  weak  regulatory  and  enforcement  framework\u2014without \nadequate  analysis  of  land  capability  and  economic  impact,  and \nencouraged  by  land  speculation\u2014is  increasingly  resulting  in \nadverse  social  and  environmental  impacts  on  local  people\u2019s \nlivelihoods.  It  also  compromises  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to \npreserve \nforest  environs \nimpacts  on \n(deforestation \necological  function  and  integrity  include  reduced  recharge  of \naquifers  and  storage  capacity  of  reservoirs  and  reduction  in  dry \nseason \nreduced \nagricultural  production).  Furthermore,  the  loss  of  forest,  coupled \nwith  the  expansion  of  economic  activities,  is  likely  to  result  in  a \npositive net emission of greenhouse gases with global impact. \n \nWhile trying to protect the natural resource base, the Government \nis  conscious  of  the  need  to  maximize  productivity  on  existing \narable  land\u2014an  area  limited  by  topography,  undeveloped  water \nresources,  and  limited  market  access.  Agricultural  productivity  is \nlow  by  the  standards  of  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian \nNations  (ASEAN),  and  the  recent  achievement  of  broad  national \nself-sufficiency  in  rice  can  only  be  maintained  if  the  Government \ncontinues  to  improve  agricultural  productivity.  Food  insecurity \nremains  common,  especially  in  areas  where  the  road  network  is \nunderdeveloped. \n \nSupport for proven interventions within an existing implementation \nframework,  which  will  contribute  to  the  Government\u2019s  overall \nsector development objectives and provide practical examples for \nthe  enhanced  capacity  of  agency  staff \nthe \ndevelopment process, is therefore justified. \n \nThe  project  impact  will  be  more  efficient  and  sustainable  natural \nresource  management  and  improved  sector  productivity.  The \nexpected  outcome  will  be  an  enhanced  institutional  capacity  at \nto  manage  natural  resource \nnational  and  provincial \nutilization  in  a  sustainable  manner,  resulting  in  poverty  reduction \nand  enhanced  market  linkages.  This  will  be  facilitated  by \ndeveloping a land capability database that describes land use and \nsuitability, making information regarding concession awards more \nwidely  available,  and  addressing  the  policy  for  protection  of \nfood  security).  Successful \ntraditional  user  rights  (including \n\nto  manage \n\nlevels \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nlinkage  with \n\ninitiatives.  All \n\ndevelopment initiatives from earlier projects will be consolidated in \nthe  form  of  subprojects.  National  and  provincial  staff  will  apply \ntheir  newly  acquired  skills  by  implementing  subprojects  to  make \ninvestments more sustainable. \n \nThe  implementation  of  subprojects  will  have  a  direct  impact  on \nagricultural  productivity,  as  well  as  improving  access  to  (and \nintegration with) regional markets and overall protection of the Lao \nPDR  biodiversity  and  environment.

This will ensure interagency \ncoordination  and  provide  direction  to  the  project  coordination \noffice  (PCO).  At  the  provincial  level,  provincial  coordination \ncommittees  with  equivalent  representation  (including  district \ngovernors)  will  perform  similar  functions,  chaired  by  the  vice \ngovernor of the province. \n \nA PCO will be established within MAF\u2019s Department of Planning to \nattend to day-to-day management of the Project. In the provinces, \nit  will  be  supported  by  a  provincial  project  office  (PPO)  to  be \nestablished  in  one  of  the  existing  line  agencies  to  achieve  the \nnecessary coordination of the contributing line agencies. \n \nThe  PPO  staff  will  work  with  district  and  kumban  (village  cluster) \nstaff  to  support  their  identification  and  prioritization  of  proposed \nsubproject  investments,  based  on  selection  criteria  specified. \ninitiated  by  government  agencies, \nProposals \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), or other entities working in \nrural  development  in  the  provinces.  Proposals  will  be  screened \nand  prioritized  by  the  provinces,  then  submitted  to  the  national \ntechnical  review \nlevel \ncommittee. Implementation of subprojects will be the responsibility \nof  the  proposing  entity,  which  will  be  contracted  to  the  PCO  and \nsupervised by the PPO. \n \nGoods and services to be financed from the proceeds of the ADB \ngrant  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nConsulting services will be required at the national level to ensure \neffective  implementation  and  at  the  provincial  level  to  assume \nresponsibility  for  identification  of  potential  subprojects  and  their \nin \nimplementation.  Staff  will  also  be  needed \nsafeguards,  appraisal  techniques,  and  geographic  information \nsystems/information management. The Project will finance a total \nof  722  person-months  of  consulting  services  (84  person-months \ninternational  and  638  person-months  national).  The  level  of \nconsulting  services  identified  under  the  Project  is  considered \ncritical  in  view  of  the  crucial  gaps  in  capacity  in  the  areas  of \nappropriate \nresource  management, \nnatural \ntechnology, \nand \nand \ncommunity  mobilization, \nimplementation.  In  addition,  national  consultants  will  be  recruited \nto assist in feasibility studies and detailed design (including initial \nenvironmental  assessments,  resettlement  plan  preparation  and \nother  safeguard  requirements).  The  consultants  will  be  selected \nand engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n\nsubproject \n\ntraining \n\nfocus \n\nfor \n\n\f \n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nto  make \n\nCapacity  building  activities  will  lead  to  improved  national  and \nprovincial  capabilities \ninformed  decisions  about \ninvestment  in  the  sector  (public,  private,  and  foreign  direct \ninvestment);  and  will  enable  maximum  financial  and  economic \nbenefits  to  be  derived  from  this  external  source  of  development \ncapital.  As  the  scale  of  land  concessions  is  large  in  relation  to \nexisting  crop  areas  and  will  only  increase  during  the  life  of  the \nProject,  project  benefits  can  be  expected  to  be  large  in  scale, \ngeographically dispersed, and affect all the rural population. \n \nBenefits  from  the  subproject  investments  will  include  increased \nagricultural  productivity  from  irrigation  and  support  of  technical \nextension  services.  Increased  commercialization  will  result  from \nrural  road  rehabilitation  and  strengthening  the  linkages  between \nproducers and domestic/subregional markets. Economically viable \nsubprojects  will  contribute  to  local  and  national  food  security, \naddress \nissues  of  climate  change,  and  promote  regional \nintegration. Overall, the integrity of the natural resource base will \nbe  maintained  and  the  process  of  managing  competing  interests \nin their use will be rationalized. \n \nThe  number  of  beneficiaries  will  be  substantial,  as  concession \nland areas affected comprise about half the total cropped area of \nthe provinces. The geographical dispersion of the subprojects and \ntargeting  of  investments  in  border  areas  mean  that  beneficiaries \nwill include the ethnic groups residing in upland areas. Women will \nalso be targeted beneficiaries. \n \nThe  main  institutional  risk  to  the  Project  lies  in  potential  conflict \nbetween  relatively  autonomous  provinces  (that  have  enjoyed \nconsiderable latitude in the award of land concessions) and state \nagencies trying to standardize and rationalize the issuance of land \nconcessions  (and  prevent  illegal  issuance).  This  risk  has  been \nmitigated  by  involving  high-level  political  authority  from  the \nprovinces in the project design process, and obtaining widespread \ncommitment  to  reforming  the  land  concessions\u2019  award  system. \nGreater  clarity \nincreased \npublication  of  land  concessions  awards  reduce  the  governance \nrisks associated with large-scale land allocations. \n \nA  second  risk  concerns  the  allocation  of  funds  for  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) of  rural infrastructure rehabilitated under the \nProject.  This  is  a  systemic  and  ongoing  issue,  as  cash-limited \nprovincial  authorities  are  responsible  for  maintenance  of  state \nassets but receive few resources from the national budget to carry \nout  routine  and  periodic  maintenance.  This  issue  has  been \nmitigated  by  (i)  requiring  provinces  in  which  subprojects  are \nlocated  to  sign  formal  commitments  to  meet  O&M  expenses, \n(ii) the  Government  providing  a  specific  assurance  that  it  will \n\nland  allocation  processes  and \n\nin \n\n \n\nv\n\n \n\n\f \nTechnical Assistance \n\nvi \n\n \n\n \n\ntaken \n\nallocate  sufficient  funds  for  the  same  purpose,  and  (iii)  ensuring \nthat subproject evaluations include norm-based estimates of O&M \nexpenses for different types of rural infrastructure.  \n \nIn  addition  to  governance  and  sustainability  issues,  other  risks \ninclude  the  following:  (i)  capacity  development  and  training  are \ninsufficient  to  improve  capacity,  resulting  in  weak  subproject \ndesign; and (ii) staff leave the Project or the ministry after capacity \ndevelopment.  These  will  be  mitigated  by  providing  adequate \ntechnical  support  and  by  supporting  performance-based \nincentives.  Measures  will  also  be \nto  ensure \ninstitutionalization  of  development  planning  and  administration \nthrough appropriate skills and partnerships. \n \nTechnical asisstance (TA) is required in view of the complexity of \nintroducing social and environmental safeguards into the process \nfor screening and approving investments in the sector. TA is also \nneeded  because  of  the  limited  experience  of  provincial  agencies \nto  manage  sector  development  as  implementing  agencies  of  an \ntechnical \ninternational  development  grant,  and \nthat \nexpertise \nsocial/environmental  safeguards  and  other  social/gender  and \ndevelopment aspects are incorporated into sector management at \nall  levels  of  government.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  a \nperiod  of  24  months  from  April  2009  to  March  2011.  A  total  of \n42 person-months  of  consulting  services  (18  person-months \ninternational  and  24  person-months  national)  will  be  required.  All \nconsultants will be engaged directly by ADB in accordance with its \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  A  Japan  Special  Fund \ngrant  in  the  amount  of  $0.7  million  is  proposed  to  ensure  such \nsupport is provided. \n\ngovernment \n\namongst \n\nensure \n\nlimited \n\nstaff \n\nthe \n\nto \n\n\f \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nAsian  Development  Fund  grant  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  for  the \nSustainable Natural Resource Management and Productivity Enhancement Project, and (ii) the \nproposed administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a grant to be provided by the \nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The report also describes the proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  Sustainable  Natural  Resource  Management  and  Productivity \nEnhancement and if the Board approves the proposed grant and administration of the grant, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nThe Lao PDR is a sparsely populated, mostly mountainous country, with limited arable \nland (estimated at about 10% of its total area). The population depends primarily on agriculture \n(estimated  80%  of  the  labor  force),  contributing  42%  of  the  gross  domestic  product,  with  rice \nfarming  alone  accounting  for  39%  of  the  agricultural  gross  domestic  product.1 Sector  growth \nrates  were  maintained  at  about  5%  per  year  from  1996  to  2000,  but  slowed  to  about  3%  per \nyear thereafter as restrictions on logging were introduced. Rice accounts for about 80% of the \ncultivated  area\u2014comprising  about  68,000  hectares  (ha)  of  irrigated  production,  620,000  ha  of \nrain-fed  paddies,  and  108,000  ha  of  upland  rice;  collectively,  these  account  for  the  bulk  of \ndomestic food production. 2 \n \n3. \nAt  the  household  level,  food  security  is  mainly  women\u2019s  responsibility.  Livestock  is  a \nsignificant  contributor  to  sector  output  as  well  as  household  incomes  and  nutrition.  Growth  in \nagricultural  production  has  been  impressive  since  the  mid-1990s,  partly  stimulated  by  reforms \nsupported by ADB through two program loans and by a rapid expansion of the irrigated area3. \nFrom 1995 to 2005, rice production increased from 1.4 million tons to 2.4 million tons, enabling \nthe country to achieve broad national self-sufficiency in 2000. From 1992 to 2003, the incidence \nof  poverty  declined  from  46%  to  33%.4 Agriculture  is  central  to  both  individual  livelihoods  and \nprovincial  economies  in  the  proposed  project  area\u2014covering  40 districts  that  constitute  the \nprovinces  of  Attapeu,  Champassak,  Salavane,  Savannakhet,  and  Sekong,  and  located  in  the \nsouth  of  the  country.5 Of  the  total  population  of  1.96  million,  rural  poverty  is  high  in  half  the \ndistricts.6 Within  the  \u201cpoor\u201d  districts,  60%  of  the  villages  are  considered  poor  (Supplementary \nAppendix A). The incidence of poverty is highest among upland ethnic groups. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n4. \nThe  agriculture  and  natural  resources  (ANR)  sector  is  characterized  by  low  levels  of \nproductivity,  poor  agricultural  and  marketing  skills,  limited  market  access,  low  use  of  water \n\n                                                 \n1   National Statistics Center. 2007.

Weak  governance  and  deficiencies  in  the  state\u2019s  ability  to  achieve  planned \nobjectives are notable. The institutional framework for sustainable and equitable management of \nANR  is  weak,  manifest  in  ambiguous  policies  and  legislation,  and  inadequate  strengths  in \nprofessional and technically trained staff and facilities. At the provincial and district levels, where \nmost of the ANR management decisions are taken, there is a deficit of expertise and facilities. \nThe situation is exacerbated because of budgetary constraints (sufficient to meet staff salaries \nbut insufficient for operational and development activities). There is only limited formal credit for \nANR,  forcing  most  farmers  to  depend  on  more  expensive  informal  credit.  While  a  few  farmer \norganizations exist, farmer and water users associations are generally new, institutionally weak, \nunrepresentative  of  the  poorest  and  of  women,  and  generally  inexperienced  to  undertake  the \nfunctions  they  are  intended  to  perform.  Overall,  the  development  opportunity  is  to  address \ninstitutional  weakness  in  natural  resources  management  and  (simultaneously)  to  invest  in \nincreasing sector productivity. \n \n5. \nThe  most  obvious  manifestation  of  this  institutional  weakness  is  in  relation  to  natural \nresources  management\u2014especially  land-use  management.  In  the  past  4\u20135  years,  growing \ndemand  from  neighboring  countries  for  agricultural  commodities  has  attracted  investors  to  the \nLao PDR either through contract farming to source agricultural commodities for processing, or \nthrough externally financed direct investment in plantations (e.g., concessions for rubber, sugar, \ncassava,  and  trees  for  pulp)  usually  with  foreign  expertise.  The  country  has  seen  a  major \nincrease  in  foreign  direct  investment,  which  has  resulted  in  unprecedented  demand  for  large \nareas  of  agricultural  and  forest  land.  Concessions  were  being  granted  on  long  leases  at  very \nlow  annual  rentals  ($5\u2013$10  per  ha  per  year  for  50  years  was  not  uncommon),  with  no  proper \nfinancial  or  economic  appraisal  and  no  social  and  environmental  safeguards  in  place.  In  an \nattempt to contain this situation, the Government imposed a 1-year moratorium in May 2007 on \nthe  granting  of  concessions  in  excess  of  100  ha  by  provinces.  However,  the  lack  of \ntransparency of land transactions and inconsistencies in practice across provinces and between \nagencies has continued (despite the establishment of the National Land Management Authority \nunder  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office).  Overall,  the  land  issue  has  exposed  confusion  in \nadministrative  and  technical  processes,  and  conflicts  between  the  interests  of  the  state  in \nensuring sustainable patterns of land use to maximize growth and ensure its sustainability, and \n(relatively autonomous) provincial administrations. While FDI should have positive impacts\u2014in \nterms  of  capital,  technology,  and  skills  flows\u2014it  is  likely  that  many  such  investments  will  be \nenvironmentally  damaging  (through  short-term  exploitation  or  longer-term  neglect),  non-\ntransparent  (mainly  benefiting  foreign  and  non-poor  domestic  interests  and  excluding  women \nand ethnic groups), and economically sub-optimal (in terms of adding to domestic employment \nand incomes). \n \n6. \nThe security of smallholder tenure to and use of land and forest resources has an impact \non the type and variety of crops that households are willing to plant. Consequently, it affects the \npoverty  status  of  communities  and  social  equity  (including  gender  and  ethnic  dimensions). \nThere is a need to define more clearly and formalize rights of land access and use. While most \nof the forest area is classified as production forest, conservation forests (or national biodiversity \nconservation areas) and protection forests are delineated on maps, but actual demarcation has \nyet  to  take  place  on  the  ground.  This  lack  of  physical  demarcation  compromises  protection \npolicy  and  makes  these  areas  vulnerable  to  encroachment,  leading  to  deforestation  and \ndenudation.  Over  the  past  few  decades,  deforestation  has  been  severe  because  of  illegal \nlogging, shifting cultivation, and encroachment. This destruction not only represents the loss of \npotentially productive assets, but also results in increased emission of substantial quantities of \ncarbon dioxide. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n7. \nThe other systemic ANR sector problem is low productivity. Factor productivity in the Lao \nPDR is low by the standards of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the \nrecent achievement of broad national self-sufficiency in rice can only be maintained if gains in \nagricultural  productivity  can  be  ensured.  Poverty  is  highest  in  the  more  rugged  upland  areas \nwhere  traditional  shifting  cultivation  provides  subsistence  existence,  complemented  with  the \nextraction  of  non-timber  forest  products.  There  is  a  need  to  address  food  insecurity  and \nmalnutrition, especially where the road network is underdeveloped. A move to more sustainable \nforms of agriculture in the upland environment (away from rice-based \u201cslash and burn\u201d systems) \nneeds  to  be  complemented  through  potential  development  initiatives  that  can  contribute  to \nimproving the incomes of communities and households (mainly populated by ethnic groups). In \naddition, enhanced focus on improving productivity in the lowland environment (where the larger \nnumber of poor households is found) needs to ensure sustainable use of natural resources. In \nthe  lowlands,  there  is  also  a  fundamental  need  to  promote  ANR  sector  transition.  This  would \n(i) encourage  diversification  (into  new  crops  and  products,  e.g.,  niche  products,  livestock, \ncoffee); (ii) promote value addition (through improved on- and off-farm processing, better post-\nharvest  technology,  etc.);  and  (iii)  support  intensification  (e.g.,  through  new  crop  varieties)  to \nraise yields. The challenge exists to integrate more remote and hitherto neglected communities \ninto the market economy with more commercial yet sustainable agricultural production systems. \n \n\n1. \n\nLessons \n\n8. \nIn 2005, a sector assistance program evaluation concluded that the contribution of ADB-\nfinanced  investment  projects  to  the  performance  of  the  ANR  sector  had  been  limited.  It \nrecommended  that  ADB  activities  in  the  ANR  sector  should  be  more  selective  and  focused  in \nterms  of  composition  and  spread,  and  should  take  into  account  government  priorities,  the \ndivision  of  roles  and  responsibilities  among  development  partners,  past  performance  of  ADB \noperations, identified lessons, and ADB\u2019s comparative advantage and skills mix requirements. It \nalso  recommended  that  the  future  approach  should  include  using  existing  aid  coordination \nchannels  more  effectively  to  (i)  share  experience  and  knowledge,  (ii)  find  solutions  to  binding \nconstraints  facing  the  ANR  sector,  and  (iii)  develop  replicable  approaches  that  can  provide \ngreater benefits countrywide.7 These features are embedded in the project design. In addition, \nthe  experience  of  designing  the  Forest  Plantation  Development  Project  demonstrated  the \nimportance  of  working  within  existing  structures,  of  including  measures  to  improve  sector \ngovernance acceptable to policy makers, and of establishing a project scope that would prove \nfeasible to implement within the country context, to move the governance agenda forward.8 \n \n9. \nExperience  gained  by  IFAD  has  demonstrated  that  rural  development  requires \ncoordinated  investment  in  several  sectors  to  have  a  significant  and  sustainable  poverty \nreduction  impact.  Among  the  main  lessons  from  past  IFAD  investments  are  (i)  focus  on \nstrengthening  coordination  of  multisector  interventions  at  the  provincial  level  while  developing \nthe  implementation  capacity  of  existing  line  agencies;  (ii)  promotion  of  decentralized  decision-\nmaking  processes  of  the  government  system  to  ensure  institutional  sustainability;  (iii)  building \ncapacity  at  the  grassroots  level  (villages  and  producer  associations)  as  it  represents  the \nfoundation  of  successful  rural  poverty  reduction  initiatives;  (iv)  prioritizing  public  investment  in \nrural infrastructure targeted at upland and disadvantaged areas to reduce marginalization; and \n(v)  establishing  arrangements  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  and  developing  policy  on \nbeneficiary contribution to rural infrastructure investments. \n                                                 \n7   ADB.  2005.

The  four  strategic  objectives  for  the  sector  are \n(i) increased  food  production  and  security 10 \u2014annual  food  production  equivalent  to  3.3 \nmillion tons of rice increasing national average consumption to 350 kilograms (kg) per head per \nyear (including poor districts) together with other targets for protein; (ii) increased  production \nof  materials  for  agro-processing\u2014directed  at  domestic  processing  to  allow  agriculture  and \nforestry exports to increase to 30% of the value of exports ($1 billion by 2010); (iii) stabilization \nof shifting cultivation\u2014the main strategy of poverty reduction in the 47 poorest districts, while \nproviding for environmental protection; and (iv) sustainable  forest  management\u2014to increase \nforest  cover  from  42%  to  53%  (12 million  hectares  by  2010)  with  commercial  plantations.  The \n13 measures  have  been  developed  to  give  effect  to  these  overall  objectives,  using  the \nGovernment\u2019s budget and donor support (Appendix 4).11 \n \n\n3. \n\nADB Strategy for the Lao PDR \n\n11. \nADB\u2019s country strategy and program 2007\u20132011 aims to promote pro-poor, sustainable \ngrowth led by the private sector by improving policies and institutional capacity to support broad-\nbased,  private  sector-led  growth. 12  It  proposes  to  support  building  a  legal  and  regulatory \nframework and developing capacity in sectors and subsectors specifically identifying agriculture. \nThe strategy supports greater involvement of civil society and mass organizations in the delivery \nof  agriculture  and  basic  social  services.  Support  will  be  provided  to  private  business \nassociations to improve their ability to network, develop business skills, and advocate on behalf \nof  their  membership\u2014expanding  livelihood  opportunities  for  rural  women  as  well  as  men  in \ncommercial  agriculture  and  small  and  medium-sized  enterprise  development.  Previous  ADB \nsupport  in  the  ANR  sector  has  been  catalytic  in  facilitating  private  sector  development, \ne.g., through  the  Northern  Region  Development  Strategy. 13  ADB  supports  increased  donor \nharmonization  within  the  framework  of  the  Paris  Declaration  (and  the  Vientiane  Declaration  of \n2006)  and  participates  in  the  Joint  Working  Group  on  Agriculture  and  Natural  Resources,  co-\nchaired by MAF. \n \n12. \nIFAD  was  chosen  as  a  co-financier,  given  the  similarity  of  its  goals  and  objectives  to \nthose  of  ADB  in  agriculture  and  rural  development  and  the  complementarity  of  approaches  in \nthe proposed southern provinces. IFAD\u2019s mandate is rural poverty reduction, and it has a record \nin  community  empowerment,  improving  the  livelihoods  of  the  poor,  and  investment  in  small-\nscale infrastructure. As donor assistance has tended to be scattered, diverse, and limited in the \nsouthern Lao PDR, the Government proposed that ADB collaborate with IFAD in a harmonized \nmanner.  The  Government  will  actively  manage  and  coordinate  activities,  and  ADB  and  IFAD \nunder  this  partnership  will  facilitate  further  harmonization  and  alignment  of  development \nplanning in the provinces to be covered under the Project. \n \n\n                                                 \n9   Committee  for  Planning  and  Investment.  2006.

Manila. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\n4. \n\nProject Rationale \n\n13. \nAs FDI is likely to be the main source of investment in the sector in the immediate future \n(domestic  capital  formation  is  low,  and  ANR  sector  enterprises  are  predominantly  small  and \nmedium-sized  enterprises),  the  Government  has  an  interest  in  managing  FDI  to  ensure  that \npotentially beneficial aspects are realized and that harmful elements are avoided. In pursuit of \nfood security and developing smallholders\u2019 incomes, there is a need to strengthen the capacity \nof the respective line agencies to assess investment proposals, monitor and enforce approved \ninvestments\u2019  compliance  with  law  and  their  contractual  and  license  conditions,  and  not \ncompromise  the  integrity  of  natural  resources.  This  can  be  accomplished  through  appropriate \nland suitability assessment, classification, zoning, and ground demarcation of various categories \nof  forests  and  agricultural  land.  This  is  best  facilitated  by  building  capacities  of  the  institutions \nconcerned  at  the  provincial  level,  supported  by  enhanced  capacity  at  the  national  level,  in \nscreening  and  appraisal  techniques  that  include  economic  feasibility,  social  acceptability,  and \nenvironmental  stability  as  formal  approval  requirements.  Supporting  associated investments  in \nland-based public projects, upon which such processes can be applied, constructs a framework \nof  \u201clearning  by  doing\u201d.  It  also  ensures  a  direct  impact  on  sector  productivity  as  subproject \ninvestments  will  address  a  range  of  sector  objectives  (including  agriculture  commercialization, \nnatural resource protection, and food security). \n \nThe Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy \n14. \n2020) for Lao PDR in promoting environmentally sustainable growth based on natural resources \nprotection. 14  Economic  growth  will  be  inclusive,  as  resource  protection  disproportionately \nbenefits  the  poorest,  and  subproject  investment  selection  criteria  will  ensure  targeting  of \nbenefits.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  focuses  on  two  key  drivers  of  change:  (i)  good  governance,  and  (ii) \ncapacity development and formation of partnerships (e.g., with IFAD). Rural infrastructure also \nfigures significantly in project design, in accordance with one of ADB\u2019s core specializations. In \naddition,  the  Project  exploits  regional  integration  possibilities,  e.g.,  by  linking  with  Greater \nMekong Subregion (GMS) based initiatives, including the East\u2013West Economic Corridor. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n15. \nThe project impact will be more efficient and sustainable natural resource management \nand  higher  sector  productivity.  The  project  outcome  will  be  enhanced  institutional  capacity  at \nnational  and  provincial  levels  to  manage  natural  resource  utilization  in  a  sustainable  manner. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n16. \nThe  Project  will  generate  three  main  outputs:  (i)  capacity  building  for  agriculture  and \nnatural resource sector management, (ii) investment in resource management and productivity \nenhancement, and (iii) efficient project management. \n \n\n1. \n\nCapacity Building for ANR Sector Management \n\nCapacity  building  initiatives  will  target  (i)  land  suitability  assessment  and  participatory \n17. \nland use mapping, (ii) compliance with ADB\u2019s social and environmental safeguards and ADB\u2019s \nother  social  and  gender  development  aspects,  (iii)  investment  appraisal,  (iv)  producer \nassociation  sustainability,  and  (v)  policy  development.  An  institutional  needs  assessment  has \nbeen  completed  (Supplementary  Appendix  B).  Prior  to  initiating  capacity  building  activities,  a \n                                                 \n14 ADB.  2008.

This  will  form  the  basis  upon  which  capacity  building  efforts  will \nperiodically  be  measured.  Subcomponent  1(i)  will  build  land  suitability  assessment,  land-use \nclassification  and  zoning,  and  digital  mapping  skills  in  participating  provincial  agriculture  and \nforestry offices (PAFOs) (where responsibility for ANR management and technical assessment \nof  proposals  for  FDI  and  concessions  has  been  delegated).  This  will  require  (i)  provision  of \ngeographic information system (GIS) equipment (hardware and software); (ii) training PAFO and \ndistrict  staff  in  land  suitability  and  participatory  land-use  mapping  and  social  analysis  of  land \nrights and GIS and information management techniques; (iii) procurement of digital data sets to \nfacilitate \nlevel\u2014and \nsubsequently  at  subproject  level,  i.e.,  kumbans    and  villages;  and  (iv)  funds  to  operate  a \nresource  mapping  facility  including  \u201cground  truthing\u201d  of  interpreted  data  sets.  This  will  provide \ntechnically  based \nthe  basic \nrecommendations  prior  to  the  award  of  land  concessions  in  the  provinces,  thereby  improving \nland-use planning and natural resource management. \n \nSubcomponent  1(ii)  will  be  directed  at  associated  provincial  government  line  agencies \n18. \ninvolved in approving both public and private investment proposals; developing their capacities \nto \ninvestments;  and \nincorporating  social  and  environmental  safeguards  and  other  social  and  gender  development \naspects  in  their  appraisal  process.15 The  subcomponent  will  provide  international  and  national \nspecialists to train agency staff at provincial and district levels in safeguards requirements and \nimpact  monitoring  of  approved  subprojects.  A  project  environment  and  social  impact  analysis \nmanual and other training material will be developed to help staff address social risks, related to \nensuring equity and maximizing benefits to poor households, women, and ethnic minorities; and \nenvironmental risks related to minimizing damage to the natural resources base. \n \n19. \nSubcomponent  1(iii)  will  develop  investment  appraisal  techniques  (financial  and \neconomic analyses, including risk assessment) being undertaken at national level within MAF\u2019s \nDepartment  of  Planning  (DOP).  This  national  focus  reflects  the  fact  that  investment  proposals \ninvolving the allocation of more than 100 ha must be referred to national level agencies for their \ntechnical  assessment.  Additional  capacity  building  will  also  be  undertaken  within  provincial \nagencies  to  strengthen  their  appreciation  of  economic  impact.  This  can  be  used  in  screening \ninvestment proposals involving allocation up to 100 ha and in prioritizing selected subprojects.  \n \n20. \nSubcomponent 1(iv) will strengthen the capacity of producer associations to make them \nfinancially  independent  and  sustainable  in  the  longer  term,  and  attractive  partners  to  private \nsector investors to strengthen their capacity to negotiate mutually beneficial arrangements. The \nsubcomponent  will  provide  support for  development,  operations,  management,  and  monitoring \nof  producer  groups.  This  subcomponent  recognizes  the  importance  of  supporting  successful \ninitiatives, particularly where existing implementation management structures can be extended \nprior  to  project  completion,  e.g.,  in  the  case  of  support  for  existing  WUAs  under  the \nDecentralized Irrigation Development and Management Sector Project.16 Resources will also be \nprovided to common agricultural interest groups seeking benefits from association, to assist in \nsustaining  their  operations.  A  training-needs  assessment  will  be  carried  out  and  training \ninstitutions  and  other  potential  service  providers  identified  in  the  first  year.  These  training \n\n                                                 \n15 Existing  institutional  structures  include  the  provincial  governors\u2019  office;  PAFOs;  department  of  communications, \ntransport,  post  and  construction;  departments  of  planning  and  investment;  water  resources  and  environmental \nadministration; social affairs; etc. \n\n16 ADB.  2000.

Training  will  be  provided  for  a  minimum  of  3 \nyears  on  a  demand  basis,  and  will  include  both  technical  areas  and  management  functions \n(such  as \nfinancial  management,  accounting,  bookkeeping,  and  estimating  beneficiary \ncontributions  by  group  members).  To  qualify  for  assistance,  each  producer  association  will  be \nrequired to demonstrate that at least 40% of its members represent poor households.  \n \n21. \nSubcomponent 1(v) will enhance the capacity of MAF\u2019s policy development agencies to \nprepare policy alternatives for consideration by higher echelons of government, recognizing that \npolicy  decisions  are  based  on  technical  and  political  considerations.  Assistance  will  allow  the \nGovernment  to  address  (i)  modernization  of  agriculture  in  response  to  global  consumption \ntrends  that  favor  adopting  bio-safety  standards  and  clean-agriculture  technologies  based  on \ngood agricultural practices; (ii) the development of mechanisms for internal control systems and \ntraceability  to  conform  with  sanitary  and  phyto-sanitary  measures  of  the  World  Trade \nOrganization; and (iii) overcoming technical barriers to trade, rules of origin, market access, and \ntrade  and  environment  regulations,  among  others.  This  subcomponent  will  also  assist  the \nGovernment  to  develop  policy  in  areas  related  to  land  concessions  (e.g.,  establishing  a  long-\nterm  land  valuation  framework,  and  convening  meetings  with  provinces  to  codify  and  confirm \nthe  process  of  land  concession  awards),  as  it  is  currently  reviewing  those  allocated  within  the \nsector.  Under  this  component,  assistance  will  be  provided  to  support  the  development  of \nlegislation  to  establish  existing  agricultural  and  WUAs  as  legal  entities.  The  Government  will \nsystematically  obtain  feedback  on  policies  that  reflect  the  critical  constraints  and  key \nopportunities available to local livelihood systems. The technical expertise proposed under the \nsubcomponent will respond to such challenges during implementation as required. \n \n\n2. \n\nInvestment in Resource Management and Productivity Enhancement \n\n22. \nThe  capacity  building  activities  in  component  1  will  have  equipped  decision-making \nagencies  with  the  skills  to  identify,  prioritize,  and  appraise  investments.  Applying  the \nstrengthened capacities, an associated program of subproject investments will be implemented. \nThese investments (beginning in year 2 of the Project, and once capacity building has begun) \nwill contribute to meeting the Government\u2019s overall objectives of the ANR sector\u2014food security \nand poverty reduction; sector transition (intensification, diversification, value addition) and rural \ncommercialization; and sustainability of natural resource utilization.17 \n \n23. \nSmall-  and  medium-sized  subprojects  identified  for  project  financing  will  replicate  or \nexpand  previously  implemented  development  initiatives  in  similar  agro-ecological  zones  to \nextend  or  widen  the  benefit  to  local  communities.  The  process  will  comprise  district \nidentification, provincial technical ratification and prioritization, and national review and approval, \nfollowed  by  provincial  implementation  and  management.  Evaluation  of  these  publicly  funded \ninvestments  will  require  an  appraisal  process  that  facilitates  incorporation  of  social  and \nenvironmental safeguards, in addition to technical and economic feasibility analyses. While food \nsecurity  and  poverty  reduction  will  be  the  focus  in  the  upland  areas,  to  enhance  overall  food \nsecurity,  the  strategy  in  the  lowlands  will  be  to  promote  integration  with  regional  markets  and \nenhance smallholder participation in them.  \n \n24. \nSubproject design will be carried out incorporating social and environmental safeguards \nand other social and gender development considerations. Subprojects will be formulated at the \ndistrict  level,  using  demand-based  procedures  including  a  comprehensive  needs  assessment \nwith  guidance  from  the  provinces,  specified  by  the  Project.  The  target  group  for  subproject \n\n                                                 \n17 This  conforms  with  the  four  goals  and  13  measures  and  the  Government\u2019s  11  national  programs  and  111  focus \n\nprojects, included in its Sixth Five-Year National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006\u20132010). \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\ndesign  includes  (i)  poor  farming  households  in  lowland  areas  that  lack  market  opportunities, \nhave limited marketable surpluses, and lack secure land tenure; and (ii) poor farmers in upland \nareas  whose  livelihoods  are  threatened  by  insecure  land  tenure,  limited  agricultural  land  and \nawareness of their rights to forest products, lack of access to markets, and low levels of literacy. \nSpecific attention will ensure that design considerations cater to the priorities of ethnic groups \nand women. \n \n25. \nTo  be  eligible  for  funding  under  the  Project,  subprojects  must  be  able  to  demonstrate \ntheir  contribution  to  the  Government\u2019s  sector  development  plans,  to  improving  agricultural \nproductivity, and to contribute to poverty reduction. They must also be technically sustainable, \nparticularly in respect of O&M for infrastructure; compliant with environmental regulations; and \nconform  to  regulatory  requirements  for  agriculture  and  commerce.  They  must  have  no \nsignificant  resettlement  or  land  compensation  implications  that  cannot  be  mitigated,  and \npotential beneficiaries must confirm the subproject as a priority investment following community \nconsultation. Subprojects that can exploit GMS features (including the East\u2013West Corridor and \nthe  Biodiversity  Conservation  Initiative)  and  those  that  deal  with  climate  change  issues  (and \ncould  access  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism  and  the  Climate  Change  Fund)  will  be \nencouraged.  Eligible  subprojects  will  include  rural  infrastructure  (rehabilitation  of  feeder  roads, \naccess  tracks,  and  construction/rehabilitation  of  small-  and  medium-scale  irrigation);  specific \npurpose  extension  initiatives;  piloting  grain  storage;  and  handling  equipment  using  advanced \npost-harvest handling technologies.18 Three categories of subprojects are anticipated: (i) those \ncontributing  primarily  to  commercialization  of  agriculture,  (ii)  those  contributing  to  poverty \nreduction,  and  (iii)  those  contributing  primarily  to  natural  resource  management.  To  assure  a \nbalance  between  these  categories,  a  prioritized  ranking  mechanism  is  proposed  (Appendix  5 \nand Supplementary Appendix C) to allow subproject proposals from each category to compete \nfor  funding  approval.  Subproject  proposals  to  be  implemented  in  priority  poor  districts \n(Supplementary Appendix D) will receive an additional  weighting to elevate their priority in the \nselection process. \n \n\n3. \n\nProject Management \n\n26. \nThe Project has a strong capacity building focus, which must be effectively managed at \nthe  national  level  to  ensure  consistency  of  application.  Similarly,  the  implementation  of  6\u201313 \nsubprojects  in  each  province,  all  identified  using  bottom-up  procedures  with  possible \nmultiagency  implementation,  will  demand  a  high  level  of  project  management  skills.  The \ncomponent will provide technical support for this process while providing resources to establish \nand operate a management structure at both national and provincial levels. At national level, the \ncomponent will establish a small project coordination office (PCO) within MAF\u2019s DOP, providing \nresources to operate the facility with vehicles, equipment, and an operating budget as well as \ninternational  and  national  training  expertise.  Provincial  project  offices  (PPOs)  will  be  provided \noffice equipment and vehicles, together with operating budgets and incremental national staff, to \nsupport project management and selection and screening of subprojects. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nOne significant special feature of the Project is support to devolution of responsibility for \n27. \nmanagement of the country\u2019s natural resources to provincial and district levels. With devolution \nof land management to lower echelons of government, there is a need to enable local levels to \nmake decisions regarding land allocation. The incorporation of safeguard considerations in this \ndecision-making process is critical to the protection of livelihood sources for rural communities \nand maintaining the environmental integrity of the area. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n18 Potential subprojects might also include those contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\nThe  Project  is  unique  as  it  will  develop  provincial  capacity  to  determine  land  suitability \n28. \nand  assess  the  impact  from  potential  investments,  as  well  as  initiate  public  disclosure  of \nconcessions  awards.  As  part  of  this  initiative,  an  assessment  of  existing  concessions  will  be \ncarried out to prepare a detailed database of these concessions and post non-commercial terms \nof  such  information  on  a  public  website.  In  addition,  commercial  terms  and  conditions  of  such \nconcessions  will  be  recorded  in  a  confidential  database  for  monitoring  compliance  of  the \nconcessionaire  with  such  terms  and  conditions,  and  to  facilitate  administration  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s commitments in the concessions. \n \n29. \nAn  important  aspect  in  the  selection  of  subprojects  will  be  their  key  strategic  impact, \nmaximized  through  rigorous  local  contextual  selection  and  design  processes.  As  multiple \nsubproject  proposals  are  anticipated,  a  ranking  mechanism  is  proposed  to  be  applied  in  the \nprovinces prior to their submission for final approval at the central level. The process will enable \nsubprojects  with  different  technical  foci  and  cost  structures  to  be  compared,  allowing  for \nprioritization  of  investments.  Strategic  impact  on  subregional  integration  will  be  achieved \nthrough rural roads opening up border areas, and opportunities to access agriculture skills and \ntechnology from neighboring provinces in Viet Nam will be explored. \n \n30. \nIn  facilitating  effective  implementation,  the  expertise  of  the  Core  Environment  Program \nand  Biodiversity  Conservation  Corridors  Initiative  will  be  utilized  for  (i)  transfer  of  skills  and \ncapacity  building  activities  related  to  land-use  planning  approaches  and  related  spatial \nsurveying and analysis techniques; (ii) distillation of lessons and packaging of scalable impacts \nfrom  pilot  sites  to  other  provinces  targeted  under  this  Project;  (iii)  provision  of  hands-on  skills \ntraining  in  natural  resource  management  and  forest  and  ecosystem  restoration;  and  (iv) \nprovision of  planning and technical input for greening of the East\u2013West Economic Corridor.19 \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n31. \nThe project investment cost is estimated at $36.775 million, including taxes and duties of \n$1.023  million  (Table  1).

IFAD will \nprovide  a  grant  of  $15  million  to  finance  40.8%  of  the  project  cost.  The  Government  will \ncontribute $1.775 million, accounting for 4.8%, to finance the total project cost, covering taxes \nand duties and salaries of seconded government staff (Table 2). The IFAD grant will be untied \nand  will  be  administered  by  ADB  following  the  Partial  Administration  Modality.  Conditions  and \narrangements for IFAD cofinancing, to be confirmed through a written endorsement from IFAD, \nwill be through a bilateral financing agreement to be negotiated between the Government and \nIFAD.

The  implementing  agencies  will  be  the  five  provincial  governors\u2019 \noffices in participating provinces, with responsibility for coordinating implementation. \n \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n34. \nThe Project will be managed by a PCO to be established within MAF\u2019s DOP. This office \nwill  be  headed  by  a  full-time  national  project  director  assisted  by  a  full-time  national  project \nmanager,  implementation  officer,  procurement  officer,  monitoring  and  evaluation  officer, \nadministration  manager,  administration  assistant,  accountant,  and  secretarial  staff.  The  PCO \nwill be responsible for day-to-day management of the Project under the direction of the national \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\nto \n\ntraining \n\nimplement  subprojects; \n\nproject steering committee (NPSC). It will be responsible for (i) consolidating provincial annual \nworkplans and budgets into the project workplans and procurement plan for submission to the \nGovernment,  ADB,  and  IFAD  on  an  annual  basis;  (ii)  overall  reporting  of  implementation \nprogress to the Government and ADB and IFAD; (iii) financial management of the five advance \nproject  accounts  and  the  PCO  project  advance  account  as  well  as  the  two  project  imprest \naccounts; (iv) preparing and submitting withdrawal applications through the EA to the Ministry of \nFinance  (MOF)  in  a  timely  manner;  (v)  developing  the  training  program  and  recruiting  local \ninstitutes  accordingly;  (vi)  procurement  and  management  of \nconsultants  and \n(vii)  oversight  of  subproject \nperformance-based  contracts \nimplementation;  (viii)  maintaining  an  efficient  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS); \nand (ix) providing secretariat services to the NPSC. The PCO will be guided by a NPSC chaired \nby a deputy minister of MAF; the vice chair will be elected from among the five participating vice \ngovernors  appointed  to  the  NPSC  and  rotated  annually.  It  will  comprise  representatives  from \nrelevant national agencies including MAF, National Agriculture and Forestry Research Institute, \nNational Agriculture and Forestry Extension Service, MOF, Ministry of Planning and Investment, \nNational  Land  Management  Authority  (NLMA)  of  the  PCO,  and  WREA.  The  NPSC  will  meet \nbiannually  or  as  required  to  achieve  interagency  coordination  and  overall  implementation \nefficiency. \n \n35. \nAt  the  provincial  level,  PPOs  will  be  established  and  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementation.20 The project office is to be established in one of the existing line agencies to \navoid incurring overhead costs for establishment of new offices. Staff appointments to PPOs will \ninclude a part full-time provincial project director assisted by a full-time implementation officer, \nadministration manager, accountant, and a secretary-cum-administration assistant. The staff will \nbe nominated from MAF, Ministry of Planning and Investment, and MOF in consultation with the \nprovincial  governor.  For  day-to-day  management,  PPOs  will  respond  to  the  PCO  for  reporting \nand  other  implementation  matters  and  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  awareness  raising  and \ndissemination  of  information  about  the  Project;  (ii)  supervising  subproject  identification;  (iii) \nsupporting  preparation  of  subproject  proposals;  (iv)  reviewing  and  approving  proposals  to \nproceed to feasibility study; (v) supporting preparation of feasibility studies, including safeguards \ncompliance analysis;  (vi)  reviewing  feasibility  studies,  then prioritizing  them  for  presentation  to \nnational  level;  (vii)  subproject  implementation  management;  (viii)  monitoring  the  impact  from \nsubprojects; (ix) attending to progress and financial reporting requirements of the Project; and \n(x) secretarial services to the provincial coordination committees (PCCs). PPOs will be guided \nby  PCCs  to  be  established  in  participating  provinces,  chaired  by  the  provincial  vice  governor \n(the provincial representative on NPSC). The composition of PCCs will mirror that of the NPSC, \nwith  multisector  representation.  PCCs  will  meet  on  a  quarterly  basis  or  as  required  to  provide \nguidance  on  overall  implementation  and  approve  the  prioritized  list  of  subprojects  for \nconsideration at national level. \n \n\n2. \n\nSubproject Formulation, Identification, Prioritization, and Approval \n\n36. \nThe process of formulation, identification, prioritization, and approval of subprojects will \nensure  that  (i)  subprojects  reflect  genuine  stakeholder  demand;  (ii)  access  to  grant  funds  is \nrigorously  screened;  and  (iii)  subprojects  have  sound  technical,  commercial,  social,  and \nenvironmental  prospects.  All  processes  will  be  carried  out  by  existing  institutional  structures, \nsupported by project staff and TA provided under the Project. As a first step, campaigns will be \nconducted  in  all  districts  to  create  awareness  of  (i)  the  rules  and  guidelines  for  subproject \nformulation, (ii) the application process, (iii) screening criteria and the prioritization process, and \n\n                                                 \n20 In  Attapeu,  the  provincial  project  office  established  for  the  IFAD-funded  Rural  Livelihoods  Improvement  Program \n\nwill be used as the PPO to reduce duplication of management structures.  \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\nimplementation  arrangements  (either  within \n\n(iv)  the  implementation  process.  Support  for  the  preparation  of  potential  subproject  proposals \nwill be encouraged from a range of stakeholders\u2014including districts, community organizations, \nnongovernment  organizations,  line  agencies,  existing  rural  development  projects,  or  rural \nbusiness  and  or  community  partnerships  involved  in  agricultural  development  initiatives.  The \nsupport  for  development  of  subprojects  will  be more  intense  in  priority  poor  districts,  including \nupland  areas.  Special  awareness  processes  will  be  designed  to  ensure  participation  by  all \ncommunities, including ethnic groups. \n \nGuidelines to assist identification of candidate subprojects will be prepared by the PCO \n37. \nand  disseminated  widely  throughout  participating  provinces.  District  authorities  will  screen \ncandidate  subprojects  to  ensure  that  each  conforms  to  subproject  eligibility  criteria.  PPO  staff \nwill  assist  the  district  offices  in  this process.  To  become  eligible  for  grant  funding,  subprojects \nmust (i) be consistent with national agricultural development strategies; (ii) be based on proven \ntechnical  parameters  and \nthe  participating \nprovinces  or  other  areas  of  similar  agro-ecological  environs);  (iii)  have  a  significant  potential \nimpact  on  poverty  reduction  (targeting  poor  households,  ethnic  groups,  and  women);  (iv)  be \nbased on a demonstrated demand; and (v) have the potential to be financially and institutionally \nsustainable. 21  Non-eligibility  criteria  would  include  (i)  an  overlap  with  BCI  or  other  donor \nactivities aimed at ANR management, (ii) having adverse impacts on the environment that could \nnot  easily  be  mitigated,  and  (iii)  having  significant  resettlement  implications.  All  subprojects \nwould be compliant with the safeguard policies of ADB, IFAD, and the Government.  \n \n38. \nCandidate  subprojects  will  be  submitted  to  PPOs,  where  their  conformity  with  project \ncriteria will be confirmed. Following this screening, subproject proposals will become eligible to \nreceive support for the preparation of a more detailed feasibility study. A full feasibility study for \neach  candidate  subproject  will  be  carried  out  under  the  supervision  of  the  PPO  and  by  the \nrelevant line agencies, in close consultation with the sponsors, and assisted by project-funded \nTA as required. As subproject proposals will be diverse, a prioritizing mechanism is proposed to \nenable  comparison.  To  ensure  that  disadvantaged  (priority  poor)  districts  receive  due \nconsideration, a weighting will be applied in the case of poverty reduction category subprojects. \nPCOs  will  apply  these  criteria  to  candidate  subprojects  and  prepare  a  prioritized  list  of \nsubprojects  for  consideration  by  PCCs.  After  priority  rankings  have  been  confirmed  by  PCCs, \neligible subprojects will be submitted to the PCO for consideration. The prioritizing mechanism \nis in Appendix 5 and Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n39. \nThe  PCO  will  confirm  the  prioritization  of  eligible  subprojects,  and  publish  these \nproposals  for  public  comments.  Following  this  disclosure,  the  proposals  will  be  referred  to  a \nTechnical  Review  Committee  that  will  (i)  review  and  evaluate  subproject  feasibility  studies, \n(ii) reject  or  seek  amendments  to  subprojects  as  appropriate,  and  (iii)  prepare  summary \ninvestment  reports  for  consideration  by  the  NPSC.  Based  on  the  provincial  allocation  of  grant \nfunds to participating provinces, the NPSC will approve subprojects to be implemented and the \nPCO will advise the provinces accordingly. Grant funds will be allocated in accordance with the \ncosts  detailed  in  approved  subproject  feasibility  studies,  and  will  be  registered  as  committed \nfunds in the financial management information system. \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation \n\n40. \nThe proposed Project will be implemented over a period of 6 years from 1 June 2009 to \n30 June 2015 (Appendix 7). About 45 medium-to-large subprojects (each valued at $100,000\u2013\n\n                                                 \n21 There  must  be  an  identifiable  and  sufficient  degree  of  \u201corganizational  readiness\u201d  to  undertake  the  subproject  in \n\nfinancial and institutional terms at least in a start-up phase. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n\n$500,000). An additional 25 smaller subprojects (from $20,000 - $100,000) will also be financed. \nProvinces have little experience in identifying and designing subprojects, and responsibility for \nimplementation  will  be  spread  among  the  five  provinces.  Therefore,  capacity  building  and \nsubproject  identification  and  design  will  take  place  within  the  first  year.  The  detailed  training \nprogram  will  be  developed  to  meet  the  needs  expressed  in  the  approved  subprojects.  As \ntraining  institutions  are  scarce,  particularly  at  the  province  level,  training  will  be  bulked  and \ncontracted  at  the  national  level.  The  subprojects  are  scheduled  to  be  launched  in  the  second \nyear of implementation. Where subprojects require extension services and agricultural research \ninputs,  local  extension  and  agricultural  research  agencies  will  be  contracted  to  the  extent \npossible. Where availability of services is limited, national service providers (public and private) \nwill  be  contracted  to  work  with  the  local  line  agency  to  deliver  services.  Performance-based \ncontracts  will  be  used  to  ensure  that  payments  are  made  based  on  services  rendered  and \nincentives are in place for effective delivery. The final year of the Project will be spent ensuring \nthat arrangements are in place to sustain subproject initiatives after completion. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\nA  procurement  plan  is  outlined  in  Appendix  8,  with  indicative  contracts  to  be  awarded \n41. \nbased  on  requirements  of  the  Project.  Prior  and  post  review  thresholds  were  discussed  and \nagreed with the EA, and are included in the plan. Procurement will mainly be undertaken by the \nPCO. Goods and works financed by ADB and IFAD will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines  (2007, as amended from time to time). Packages for works valued at \nless than $1 million or equivalent but more than $100,000 or equivalent, shall be procured using \nnational  competitive  bidding  using  single-stage,  two-envelope  procedures.  For  works  below \n$100,000  equivalent,  shopping  procedures  may  be  used.  Goods  costing  less  than  $500,000 \nequivalent but more than $100,000 shall be procured through national competitive bidding using \nsingle-stage,  one-envelope  procedures.  Smaller  packages  for  goods  valued  at  less  than \n$100,000  may  be  procured  through  shopping  procedures.  To  ensure  sustainability  and  to \nachieve the social objectives of the Project, procurement, specifications, and contract packaging \nof  selected  components  may  be  adapted  to  involve  local  communities  and  nongovernment \norganizations, to use more local knowledge and materials, and to use labor-intensive and other \ntechnologies. \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n42. \nThe  Project  will  require  three  kinds  of  consulting  services:  (i)  to  assist  the  PCO  with \nproject  and  financial  management,  subproject  identification,  and  implementation;  (ii)  to  assist \nthe  PCO  and  PPOs  in  technical  areas,  including  GIS,  information  management,  financial  and \neconomic appraisal techniques; and (iii) to provide policy development support. Consultants will \nbe  recruited  through  a  firm  using  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  (QCBS)  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) and the Project\u2019s \nprocurement plan (Appendix 8). Implementation management and technical consulting services \nwill be recruited through a consulting firm using QCBS (80:20) with full technical proposals. The \nPCO  will  recruit  national  consultants  to  assist  in  the  preparation  of  feasibility  studies  for \nsubprojects  from  national  firms  using  consultant\u2019s  qualification  selection  (CQS)  with  the \nsimplified  technical  proposal.  This  method  will  be  used  since  (i)  few  of  the  existing  national \nconsultants  are  qualified,  (ii)  the  quality  of  the  firms\u2019  output  will  be  critical  to  assessment  and \nmitigation of the subproject\u2019s environmental and social impact, and (iii) recruitment time will be \ncritical.  The  PCO  will  also  be  responsible  for  recruiting  national  consultants  to  provide \nsupervision services for the implementation of approved subprojects. These consultants will be \nrecruited  using  CQS  and  the  biodata  technical  proposal  since  they  will  be  hired  under  small \npackages of $200,000 or less, recruitment time is critical, and the small size of contracts does \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\nnot justify the preparation and evaluation of competitive proposals. To support implementation \nand capacity building initiatives, the Project will fund a total of 722 person-months of consulting \nservices  (84  person-months  international  and  638  person-months  national).  Outline  terms  of \nreference for consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n43. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  EA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n44. \nTo  expedite  disbursement,  the  Government  will  establish  two  first-generation  imprest \naccounts22 at  the  Bank  of  the  Lao  PDR\u2014one  for  the  ADB  grant  and  the  other  for  the  IFAD \ngrant\u2014immediately  after  loan  effectiveness.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  managed  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time) \nand detailed arrangements agreed by the Government, ADB and IFAD. These accounts will be \nmanaged by MOF. The maximum amount to be deposited in each of the imprest accounts will \nbe  based  on  an  estimated  6  months  of  project  expenditure  to  be  funded  from  the  imprest \naccounts or a maximum of 10% of the ADB and IFAD grants, whichever is lower. Advance  of \noperational  costs  to  the  PCO  and  PPOs  will  be  based  on  approved  work  plans  and  budget \nschedules, and transferred to project advance accounts to be established at a commercial bank \nacceptable to the Government and ADB. Separate project advance accounts will be established \nfor the ADB grant proceeds and the IFAD grant proceeds. The advance accounts shall have an \ninitial  advance,  and  the  maximum  ceiling  is  equivalent  to  6  months  of  operating  expenditures. \nThe advance accounts shall be opened with the equivalent of $50,000 for the PCO and $20,000 \nfor  each  of  the  five  provincial  advance  accounts,  and  will  be  reimbursed  using  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. Liquidation and replenishment of the project advance accounts for the PCO \nwill be based on prior submission of full documentation to MOF through the EA (MAF). For the \nproject  advance  accounts  of  PPOs,  liquidation  and  replenishment  will  be  based  on  prior \nsubmission of full documentation to the PCO for endorsement before submitting to MOF through \nthe EA. The project advance accounts for IFAD grant proceeds will only be used for expenses \nrelated to supporting smallholder groups, including (i) training support to producer groups other \nthan  the  Decentralized  Irrigation  Development  and  Management  Sector  Project  WUAs  (see \nAppendix  6,  Table  5.2);  and  (ii)  support  for  the  Decentralized  Irrigation  Development  and \nManagement Sector Project WUAs. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure procedures shall be used \nto  reimburse  expenditures  and  liquidate  the  imprest  accounts  for  all  individual  payments  not \nexceeding the equivalent of $100,000. The grants will be disbursed by ADB in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  by  the  Government, \nADB and IFAD.  The funds flow chart is in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n\n                                                 \n22 Bank charges related to operations of the imprest accounts and project advance accounts will be financed from the \n\ngrants. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15\n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n45. \nThe  PCO  and  each  PPO  will  maintain  records  and  accounts  by  financing  source,  and \nidentify expenditures incurred for the Project using grant proceeds and local financing sources. \nAccounts  will  be  established  and  maintained  in  accordance  with  internationally  accepted \naccounting  standards.  Annual  project  accounts  of  the  PCO  and  PPOs  will  be  audited  by \nauditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Audit  coverage  will  include  a  special  audit  of  project  accounts, \nincluding separate opinions on (i) utilization of the imprest and project advance accounts; (ii) the \nstatement of expenditures, including whether the amount claimed is duly supported and verified; \n(iii) whether the PCO and PPOs are operating the imprest and advance accounts in accordance \nwith  ADB  procedures;  and  (iv)  compliance  with  financial  covenants  specified  in  the  grant  and \nproject  agreements.  Audit  reports, management  letter,  and  related  financial  statements  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate, or \nthe project closing date if earlier. ADB informed the Government of its policy on submission of \naudited  accounts  (covering  failure  of  submitting  audited  accounts  and  financial  statements  by \nthe due date). Formal warning will be issued, and disbursements suspended, for accounts more \nthan 6 months overdue. \n \n46. \nEach PPO will provide quarterly progress reports to the PCO. These will be consolidated \ninto quarterly reports and submitted to MAF, the NPSC, ADB, IFAD, and PCCs. These reports \nwill  record  progress  made,  problems  encountered  during  the  review  period,  steps  taken  or \nproposed  to  remedy  the  problems,  the  proposed  program  of  activities,  and  progress  expected \nfor the following quarter. The PCO will ensure that these reports are submitted to ADB and IFAD \nin a timely manner. Within 6 months of physical completion of the Project, the PCO will submit \nto ADB and IFAD a project completion report that describes the physical progress of the Project, \nactual costs incurred in relation to cost estimates, the results of capacity building activities, the \noutcome of safeguard efforts, a preliminary assessment of achieved benefits, and other relevant \nproject implementation matters requested by ADB. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring System \n\n47. \nThe  PPMS  will  in  part  be  based  on  individual  subprojects  in  accordance  with  a  pre-\ndesigned framework for implementation and impact monitoring.23 Baseline data (disaggregated \nby gender and ethnicity) will be obtained during subproject preparation, and presented as part of \nthe  subproject  design  and  monitoring  framework.  A  set  of  qualitative  indicators  to  monitor \ncapacity development for the Project as a whole will also be developed.24 Capacity building will \nbe initially assessed through a baseline needs assessment, which will involve both an objective \nassessment  of  capacity  and  subjective  perceptions  of  staff  measures  through  periodically \nconducted  knowledge,  attitude  and  practice  surveys.  Implementation  monitoring  will  be \nundertaken  by \ntheir  normal  project  management \nresponsibilitiesand  in  line  with  their  overall  capacity.  Benefit  monitoring  will  be  undertaken \nperiodically (annually after year 2) through an independent contracted organization or institution. \nThe outline terms of reference for consultants in Supplementary Appendix F (PCO adviser and \nnational  M&E  specialist)  reflect  this.  Social  and  environmental  compliance  monitoring  will  be \nundertaken  by  an  independent  institution.  In  addition,  semiannual  project  reviews  will  be \nundertaken  and  a  project  completion  report  will  be  submitted  within  3  months  of  project \ncompletion. \n\nthe  PPOs  and  PCO  as  part  of \n\n                                                 \n23 The  PPMS  may  be  based  on  a  three-level  framework  in  which  the  first  level  refers  to  the  regular  and  continuous \nmonitoring of activities and their immediate results (output reporting), the second level relates to the monitoring and \nassessment of project performance in achieving expected outcomes (outcome monitoring), and the third level refers \nto the assessment of project contribution toward the achievement of its overall goal (impact evaluation). \n\n24 Based on training evaluation techniques measuring understanding and application of techniques, practices, etc. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n48. \nApart  from  regular  reviews,  ADB,  IFAD  and  the  Government  will  undertake  a \ncomprehensive review within 12 months and annually following loan effectiveness when the first \nbatch of subprojects has been identified and is under implementation. A midterm review will also \nbe  undertaken  within  36  months  of  loan  effectiveness.  These  reviews  will  include  a \ncomprehensive  assessment  of  project  implementation  arrangements,  detailed  analysis  of  the \nscope  and  implementation  process  and  progress  of  subprojects,  feedback  from  the  PPMS, \nperformance  of  consultants,  capacity  building  progress,  and  possible  reallocation  of  loan \nproceeds. Remedial action will be instituted as required. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n49. \nGiven  the  current  high  levels  of  investment  in  the  agriculture  sector  (private  domestic, \nFDI,  and  donor-funded  initiatives),  the  proposed  Project  will  develop  national  and  provincial \ncapacities to manage this recent surge of investment. It is proposed that capacity development \nTA financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan, \nwill provide resources for international and national specialists to develop training material and \nprovide  on-the-job  training  as  subprojects  are  screened,  prioritized,  and  evaluated.  Under  the \nTA, staff from line agencies will be trained to ensure that social and environmental safeguards \ncompliance  is  incorporated  into  investment  proposals,  and  to  monitor  adherence  of  approved \ninvestments with specified covenants. Details of the proposed TA are in Appendix 9. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nInstitutional Impact \n\n50. \nThe  overall  value  of  capacity  building  activities  to  the  economy  was  not  quantified,  but \nimproved  national  and  provincial  capabilities  to  make  informed  decisions  about  investment  in \nthe  sector  (public,  private,  and  from  FDI)  will  contribute  significantly  to  the  Government  being \nable to take control of the land allocation process on a more rigorous basis. This will enable it to \nprotect the interests of smallholders whose livelihoods depend on the natural resources under \ntheir  area  of  control.  The  increase  in  technical  capacity  will  lead  to  considerable  efficiencies \nwithin the future land allocation process by clearly identifying areas suitable for different forms of \nagricultural  and  forestry  production,  and  demarcating  areas  set  aside  for  protection\u2014while \nmaximizing economic rents for the state from land concessions. \n \nB. \n\nSocial Impact \n\n51. \nAn  analysis  of  the  project  benefits  indicates  that  the  more  significant  social  impacts \ncaused  by  the  subprojects  will  be  improved  livelihoods  and  reduced  levels  of  poverty  for  the \npopulation of the project area. Land suitability assessments and land use planning will enhance \nfarmers\u2019  awareness  of  suitability  for  various  crops  to  maximize  benefits,  and  facilitate  land \nallocation  and  titling\u2014providing  security  of  tenure  and  associated  benefits.  The  provision  of \nimproved  road  access  to  ethnic  minorities  and  farmers  living  in  isolated  and  inaccessible \nmountain areas is likely to have a positive impact, providing them with an outlet for their produce \nand  access  to  lower  priced  household  commodities,  agricultural  inputs,  as  well  as  health  and \neducation  facilities.  The Project  is  classified category  A  for  indigenous peoples,  and  an  ethnic \ngroup  development  framework  agreed  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  applicable  laws \nand  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998).  The  framework  will  help \nextend  subproject  positive  impacts  to  ethnic  groups  and  mitigate  negative  impacts,  if  any.  A \nsummary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in  Appendix  10.  A  summary  ethnic  group \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\ndevelopment framework is in Appendix 11 and a detailed ethnic group development framework \nis in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \n52. \nImprovement of rural access roads, irrigation facilities, and other rural infrastructure will \nbe within existing road alignments as much as possible. It is envisaged that irrigation facilities \nand  other  items  of  infrastructure  will  be  rehabilitated  in  their  current  locations.  Priority  will  be \ngiven to those subprojects that can avoid or minimize resettlement impacts. If any exist, they are \nexpected  to  be  insignificant  (category  B).  A  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared \n(Appendix 12 and Supplementary  Appendix I) and sets out the resettlement policy, screening, \nand  planning  procedures  that  the  Project  will  follow  when  preparing  a  resettlement  plan  if \nrequired. \n \nGender impacts will be facilitated through consultation with local women in the design of \n53. \nsubprojects and by their inclusion in project activities (including extension services and training). \nInfrastructure  management  bodies  will  include  women.  Gender  training  will  be  provided  and \nlinked to this concrete action in subproject preparation. Gender focal points may be established \nin  villages  to  promote  improved  agricultural  practices,  taking  account  of  women\u2019s  traditional \nrights in land reallocation and land titling (Appendix 13 and Supplementary Appendix J). More \ngenerally,  improved  road  access  will  open  up  new  opportunities  for  women  who  lived  in \npreviously  isolated,  rural  communities\u2014giving  better  access  to  education  and  health  services, \ninvestment  opportunities  (Appendix  13  and \nas  well  as \nSupplementary Appendix J). \n \nC. \n\nfacilitating  employment  and \n\nEnvironmental Impact \n\nThe  Project\u2019s  primary  focus  is  on  capacity  building  for  sustainable  ANR  management, \n54. \nwhich  entails  nonintrusive  initiatives  with  institutions.  The  developed  capacity  will  enhance \nenvironmental  benefits  and  promote  the  environmental  stability  of  subprojects.  In  examining \nland concessions, MAF and PAFOs will ensure that encroachment does not occur into protected \nareas and that any commercial ventures already allocated concessions in such areas will have \ntheir  lease  revised  accordingly.  Protection  forest  will  also  be  clearly  demarcated  on  land  use \nand suitability maps to be prepared under the proposed Project. Based on the likely investments \nenvisaged,  the  Project  has  been  classified  environmental  category  B.  An  initial  environmental \ntwo  sample  subprojects  was  undertaken \nthe \nexamination  (IEE) \n(Supplementary  Appendix  K)  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002).  The  IEEs \nshow that most of the potential impacts will be positive, that no significant adverse impacts are \nanticipated, and an environmental impact assessment is not required. However, to ensure that \nall potentially adverse impacts are mitigated, careful screening of subprojects will be carried out \nand  an  environmental  management  plan  specifying  mitigation  measures  and \nfunding \nrequirements will be a prerequisite for approval. In addition, an environmental assessment and \nreview  framework  has  been  prepared  (Supplementary  Appendix  K)  to  guide  the  EA  in \nundertaking environmental assessments of subprojects to be selected during implementation. \n \nD. \n\nEconomic Impact \n\nthe  Project  and \n\nfor \n\nBenefits  from  rural  road  rehabilitation  include  reduced  travel  costs  and  times.  Indirect \n55. \nbenefits include the diversification of sources of income, higher levels of agricultural productivity, \ngreater  diversification  of  market-oriented  agriculture  crops,  improved  access  to  health  and \neducation  services,  and  reduced  costs  of  inputs  and  household  commodities\u2014all  leading  to \nreduced  levels  of  poverty  among  communities  served  by  the  roads.  This  is  confirmed  by \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  estimates  of  23.5%  for  a  sample  rural  road  rehabilitation \nsubproject,  based  on  quantifiable  benefits.  The  benefit  of  irrigation  rehabilitation  includes \nincreased  agriculture  production  and  diversification  to  higher  value  crops.  The  sample \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\nsubproject analyzed shows the intensification from a single rain-fed rice crop to two irrigated rice \ncrops,  although  other  higher  valued  options  are  available  with  the  more  secure  dry  season \nwater  supplies  leading  to  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  19.3%.  All  the  benefits \nanticipated are incremental in relation to the without-project scenario, where it may be expected \nthat  the  incidence  of  land-use  conflicts  increase,  social  and  environmental  consequences \nintensify,  and  suboptimal  economic  returns  (to  the  state  and  public  lands  and  to  Lao  labor) \nworsen. Detailed economic analysis is in Appendix 14. \n \nE. \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\n56. \nThe design logic of the Project assumes that inflows of FDI into the Lao PDR continue, \nthere is ongoing availability of appropriate improved agriculture technology upon which to base \nproductivity improvements, processes of increasing regional integration and market participation \nunderpin improving producer incentives, and the broad mix of government policies in the ANR \nsector remain consistent. \n \n57. \nThe  main  institutional  risk  to  the  Project  lies  in  potential  conflict  between  certain \nprovinces which have recently enjoyed considerable latitude in the award of land concessions \nand state agencies (such as NLMA) which are trying to standardize and rationalize the situation \nfrom  a  national  perspective.  This  risk  has  been  mitigated  by  involving  high-level  political \nauthority  from  the  provinces  in  the  design  process.  A  second  risk  concerns  the  allocation  of \nfunds  for  O&M  of  rural  infrastructure  rehabilitated  under  the  Project.  This  is  a  systemic  and \nongoing  issue,  as  cash-limited  provincial  authorities  are  responsible  for  maintenance  of  state \nassets  but  receive  few  resources  from  the  national  budget  to  carry  out  routine  and  periodic \nmaintenance. This will be mitigated by requiring provinces in which subprojects are located to \nsign formal commitments to provide financing to meet O&M expenses, and by the Government \nproviding a specific assurance that it will allocate sufficient funds for the same purpose. \n \n58. \nA third risk is that capacity building initiatives are insufficient to achieve the competence \nneeded for improved natural resource management, particularly in land suitability identification. \nThis is mitigated by the continual input of technical specialists in the provinces throughout the \nfirst 3 years of implementation to provide the necessary support. The governance issue raised \nabove will determine if the technical recommendations are seriously considered in making land \nallocation decisions. \n \n59. \nA  final  risk  is  that  trained  staff  will  leave  their  posts  after  receiving  training  under  the \nProject.  This  remains  a  constant  threat  in  economies  where  skilled  individuals  are  few  in \nnumber  and  opportunities  for  advancement  are  plenty.  The  broader  project  benefit  can  be \nserved  as  long  as  the  trained  individual  continues  to  serve  economic  development  within  the \nLao PDR and performance-based incentives are instituted. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government and MAF (the EA) have given \n\n60. \nthe following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\nCounterpart funding. The Government will ensure that (a) counterpart funds in \nrespect  of  staff  salaries  within  project  management  structures  that  are  filled  by \npermanent government employees will be made available in a timely manner to \nassure efficient implementation of the project activities, (b) additional counterpart \nfinancing  will  be  provided  for  any  shortfall  of  funds  or  cost  overruns,  (c) \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n\nexemption  from  taxes  and  duties  on  imported  goods  and  equipment  will  be \nprovided in a timely manner, and (d) counterpart financing for compensation and \nentitlements  under  any  resettlement  plan  required  under  any  subproject  will  be \ndisbursed in a timely manner. \nOperation and maintenance. Provinces in which subprojects are to be located \nwill  be  required  to  sign  commitments  that  they  are  prepared  to  meet  the \nidentified O&M expenditures. Failure of provinces to sign such commitments or \nto provide the O&M funds once subprojects are implemented will disqualify them \nfrom submitting future proposals.  \nEnvironmental  safeguards.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  its  laws  and \nregulations  governing  environmental  impact  assessments,  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  are  followed.  If  there  is  any  discrepancy  between  the \nrecipient's  laws  and  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy,  then  ADB\u2019s \npolicy  requirements  will  apply.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  MAF,  following \nthe  relevant  government  internal  processes,  will  carry  out  environmental \nassessments for all subprojects prior to commencement of civil works. MAF will \nensure that the assessment will (a) meet the requirements of the environmental \nassessment  and  review \nframework,  (b)  meet  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy \nrequirements,  and  (c)  include  details  of  local  consultation  carried  out.  MAF  will \nensure that the IEE in a local language will be available on request at each of the \nPPOs  for  the  public  and  other  interested  parties  before  the  relevant  subproject \nstarts.  MAF  will  ensure  that  specific  environmental  provisions  as  a  result  of \nin  civil  works  contracts  and \nenvironmental  assessment  are \nincluded \nenvironmental  mitigation  measures  are  adequately \nthe \ncontractors. \nResettlement.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  land  and  right-of-way \nrequired  for  the  Project  will  be  made  available  in  a  timely  manner  and  that \ncompensation at replacement cost and other entitlements will be provided prior to \nthe  award  of  civil  works  contracts  and  prior  to  affected  people  being  displaced \nfrom their houses, land, and assets. Any involuntary resettlement will be carried \nout  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement  framework  agreed  between  MAF  and \nADB,  the  Government\u2019s  laws  and  regulations  on  resettlement,  and  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).  Resettlement  plans  will  be  prepared \nwhere necessary following detailed design, and publicly disclosed, in places and \nusing language accessible to all affected people, prior to submission to ADB for \nits review and approval. They will be disclosed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Public \nCommunications Policy (2005). MAF will also submit quarterly internal monitoring \nreports  to  ADB  for  uploading  on  ADB\u2019s  website,  in  a  manner  and  language \naccessible  to  all  affected  people.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  counterpart \nfunds  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  are  made  available  in  a \ntimely manner in accordance with the resettlement plans. \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  Government  through  each  provincial  authority,  will \nensure  that  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  specific \nmeasures  on  indigenous  peoples  set  forth  in  (a)  the  agreed  ethnic  group \ndevelopment  plan  and  ethnic  group  development  framework  and  resettlement \nframework,  (b)  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples,  and  (c)  the  laws  and \nregulations of the Lao PDR on indigenous peoples. In the case of any difference \nbetween  the  Lao  PDR  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous \nPeoples, ADB\u2019s policy will prevail. \nGrievance  redress  mechanisms.

\n\nThe economy of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is largely dependent \n1. \non  an  undeveloped  and  low-productivity  agriculture  and  natural  resources  (ANR)  sector  to \nsupport  the  majority  of  its  population.  The  proportion  of  households  that  can  be  described  as \nagricultural remains high (at around 80%) and over 90% of these produce rice, mainly for their \nown  consumption.  Sector  growth  rates  averaged  almost  5%  in  the  5  years  to  2000,  but  have \ndeclined since to about 2%\u20133% per year. This growth came mainly from yield increases in rice, \nbut  also  from  modest  moves  toward  higher  value  cropping  in  lowland  areas.  Agriculture  has \nremained a relatively extensive activity compared with other countries in the region, but national \nrice  yields  are  still  low  by  regional  standards.  Input  use  is  still  about  one-tenth  that  of  most \ncountries in the region. National agricultural value added remains low, as is the openness of the \nsector (the lowest in the Greater Mekong Subregion). \n \n2. \nThe  Lao  PDR  achieved  national  food  self-sufficiency  at  the  turn  of  the  century.  It  is \nwidely agreed that aggregate annual production of rice, other grains and staples (roots, tubers, \netc.) on average meet national calorific requirements. However, the entire population does not \nenjoy secure food supplies. Seasonal and local deficits, especially in upland and remote areas, \nstill occur with some frequency. \n \n3. \nAs  well  as  geographic  (mountainous  topography)  conditions  and  particular  subsector \nissues  (such  as  the  irrigated  area  as  a  proportion  of  total  cropped  area  being  low),  the  rural \neconomy  remains  broadly  affected  by  specific  deficiencies  including  (i)  the  availability  of  rural \nfinance,  (ii)  a  generally  underdeveloped  private  sector,  and  (iii)  the  poor  state  of  the  transport \nnetwork (especially roads\u2014both rural roads and links connecting the Lao PDR to other Greater \nMekong  Subregion  countries).  Geographical  isolation  is  a major  cause  of  poverty,  as  much  of \nthe rural population has limited access to markets, employment opportunities, or social services. \n \n4. \nOverall, the economy is primarily agrarian and natural resource-based, despite abundant \nnatural  resources  and  an  apparently  favorable  policy  climate  that  has  facilitated  economic \ngrowth at the national level. ANR sector transition (i.e., agricultural intensification, diversification, \nand agro-industrialization) has not yet occurred, and the sector\u2019s contribution to national poverty \nreduction has so far been modest. \n \n5. \nIn response to the Sixth National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006\u20132010) and \nNational  Growth  and  Poverty  Eradication  Strategy  objectives,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and \nForestry (MAF) has formulated four goals and 13 measures for the sector to guide development. \nHowever,  the  current  planning  system  does  not  embody  economic  prioritization  or  choice \nbetween alternatives (i.e., more robust policy making is required, especially at local levels). In \naddition,  whatever  objectives  may  exist  in  state  plans,  inadequate  operational  resources  and \nsignificant  control  over  expenditures  by  provincial  authorities  (because  of  their  tax-raising \npowers) can frustrate and/or undermine state objectives. The Asian Development  Bank (ADB) \nand  the  World  Bank  are  working  to  put  in  place  a  medium-term  expenditure  framework  at \nsectoral  and  national  levels.  It  is  questionable  whether  the  structure  of  MAF  operations \n(historically developed as an input and service provider across a range of activities) can meet \nthe  needs  of  increasingly  export-oriented,  sophisticated,  and  service-demanding  production \nsystems. \n \n6. \nAlthough  problems  in  governance  conditions  have  been  identified  and  described  for \nmany years, the relatively poor sector governance is now an obvious constraint to the promotion \nof sustainable and equitable resource-based development. Agricultural growth has the potential \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nto  benefit  the  majority  of  the  poor  directly.  However,  this  growth  (including  in  foreign  direct \ninvestment  [FDI])  depends  on  the\u2014currently  absent\u2014transparency  and  predictability  in  the \nimplementation of investment laws, the enforcement of contracts, and management of the trade \nregime  and  taxation  procedures.  Similarly,  farmers,  agribusiness  enterprises,  and  investors \nmust  have  confidence  in  relation  to  their  land  tenure  and  usufruct  rights  to  ensure  security  of \ntheir  property  and  investment.  Such  rights  are  largely  unenforceable  at  present.  Aggregate \nagricultural growth also depends on protecting national water, soil, and forest resources, e.g., by \ncontrolling the commercial and population-driven loss of forest, by managing the award of large-\nscale land concession, and other significant resource alienation. However, government capacity \nto monitor and regulate and to impose penalties for illegal acts is extremely modest. Changes \nrequired  to  increase  the  long-term  sustainable  sector  growth  rate  will  depend  largely  on  the \noverall governance function, and how well domestic organizations and institutions perform. \n \nB. \n\nRecent Developments and Current Issues \n\ntraders  and  processors);  and \n\n7. \nThe  most  notable  feature  of  the  ANR  sector  is  the  unprecedented  pace  at  which  the \nsector  (and  thereby  the  country  itself)  is  being  integrated  with  neighboring  economies, \nparticularly through flows of FDI. This inward investment is manifest in (i) cross-border contract \nfarming  arrangements  (typically  between  Lao  smallholders  and  Thai,  Chinese,  or  Vietnamese \npurchasers, \n(ii)  plantation-style  commodity  production \nconcessions.  Many  of  these  involve  Chinese  (for  rubber,  mainly  in  the  north),  Vietnamese \n(mainly rubber and coffee in the south), Korean (Jotropha for bio-diesel fuel), and Indian (pulp \nand paper based on fast-growing wood fiber) companies. Many of the Chinese and Vietnamese \nagencies  are  State  Owned  Enterprises,  often  exploiting  historical  political  and  patronage \nlinkages  with  particular  provinces.  The  scale  of  these  developments  is  significant  (153,000 \nhectares  have  been  allocated  in  Savannakhet  alone  and  total  national  land  concessions  may \nnumber  900  separate  agreements).  Concession  areas  in  the  southern  provinces  already \nrepresent 35% of the paddy area (Table A3). \n\n \nTable A3: Summary Statistics of Participating Provinces (ha) \n\nChampassak \n\nLand Use \nProvince area \nForest Area \nUn-stocked \nPaddy + Crops \nPerennial Crops \nNon Agriculturea \nLand for Grazing \nTotal Current Area \nConcession Area \nMineral Exploration \na Urban, water, barren rocky land, swamps, and grassland. \nSource: Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Ministry of Mines and Energy \n\nSalavan \n1,541,500  1,069,100 \n914,540 \n1,126,081 \n328,592 \n293,239 \n130,377 \n317,657 \n58,373 \n125,016 \n24,183 \n97,454 \n106,450 \n117,625 \n1,695,722  1,154,693 \n2,000 \n22,360 \n\nAttapeu \n1,032,000 \n965,343 \n457,145 \n34,386 \n350 \n36,419 \n30,150 \n1,044,134 \n0 \n2,400 \n\nSavannakhet \n2,177,400 \n1,896,123 \n665,326 \n199,341 \n0 \n81,761 \n347,225 \n2,265,648 \n153,445 \n196,128 \n\n38,500 \n160,133 \n\nSekong \n766,500 \n733,793 \n327,188 \n22,029 \n19,017 \n10,677 \n27,475 \n792,659 \n14,385 \n137,440 \n\nTotal \n6,586,500 \n5,635,881 \n2,071,600 \n703,790 \n202,755 \n294,148 \n628,925 \n6,996,510 \n208,3301 \n518,461 \n\n \n8. \nSuch concession investments have the potential to create large numbers of jobs for the \nlocal  population;  and  can  bring  skills,  technology,  intellectual  property,  etc.  to  the  Lao  PDR. \nHowever,  major  concerns  remain.  Land  is  given  to  applicants  for  long  lease  periods.  This  is \noften done under provincial authority, the status of which is unclear, and whose administrative \nand  financial  processes  are  opaque.  Lease  periods  of  20,  30,  or  50  years  are  common. \nConcessions  are  frequently  given  on  a  first-come,  first-served  basis  without  any  proper \nfeasibility or safeguards-based analysis. There is little consideration as to the economic impact \n                                                 \n1   Source: data provided by PAFOs. The Investment Division of the Planning Department in MAF estimate is 201,888 \n\nha.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n27\n\non food security, local livelihoods, natural resources status, or the possibility that opportunities \nfor  a  more  rewarding  investment  are  excluded  once  land  has  been  committed.  In  addition, \nannual  land  rentals  (typically  a  few  dollars  per  hectare)  are  extremely  low  in  light  of  the \nopportunity costs. \n \n9. \nThe Government\u2019s response to such arrangements is ambiguous. It involves confusion \nvis-\u00e0-vis legislation, and the mandates and authority of institutions; and outright conflict between \nthe  state  and  certain  provinces.  The  public  sector  response  can  best  be  described  as \nadministratively  and  technically  underdeveloped\u2014it  simply  does  not  have  the  capacity  to \nappraise and monitor such arrangements. The limited capacity of ANR institutions in this regard \nis  the  core  sector  problem  and  desired  outcome  to  remedy  this  situation.  Without  the  Project, \nthe  nature  of  many  such  investments  could  be  (i)  environmentally  damaging,  either  through \nrelatively  short-term  exploitation  or  longer-term  neglect;  (ii)  non-transparent,  thus  benefiting \nforeign and nonpoor interests; and (iii) economically suboptimal, in terms of adding to domestic \nemployment, income-generation, and wealth-creation. \n \nThere  are  also  concerns  from  the  impact  of  major  international  price  changes  (rice  - \n10. \ndoubling  between  early  2007  and  early  2008)  and  to  fuel-based  inputs  (inorganic  fertilizers, \npesticides, herbicides, etc.). These changes have affected the dynamics of rice production and \nconsumption  in  ways  that  remain  unclear,  as the  rice  economy  is  characterized  by  a  complex \ninterplay of production and consumption factors. At the policy level, a proper understanding is \nrequired  of  (i)  the  extent  to  which  rice  production  should  be  promoted  (in  aggregate  and  at \nspecific locations), and (ii) the opportunity costs of any particular level of national food security. \nPerhaps  even  more  urgently,  at  the  investment  level,  specific  interventions  are  needed  to \nincrease the productivity of rice and other staples. This may be achieved through replication of \nsuccessful irrigation  rehabilitation  schemes;  and  promotion  and  formation  of  farmer  groups  (to \nimprove post-harvest handling, undertake marketing, devolve scheme management, etc.). \n \n11. \nRecent  FDI  and  land-based  investments  from  neighboring  countries  in  the  ANR  sector \nmay be seen as a gold rush. However, as the economy becomes more formally integrated into \nworldwide  relationships  in  the  longer  term,  it  will  be  more  affected  by  global  (as  opposed  to \nmerely  local  and  regional)  factors.  These  will  include  the  effects  of  engaging  new  and  higher \nvalue  products,  intensifying  and  extending  supply  chains,  more  rigorous  quality  standards, \nbetter information, etc. There is an urgent need to strengthen Lao PDR value chains, add value \nto  existing  products,  and  encourage  product  diversification  through  specific  investments  to \naddress  and  exploit  such  possibilities.  At  a  policy  level,  another  need  is  to  improve  the  Lao \nPDR\u2019s ability to engage in global (World Trade Organization) and regional (e.g., Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations [ASEAN], ASEAN Free Trade Area, and ANR trade based on proper \nsanitary and phyto-sanitary measures. \n \n12. \nOverall, securing the natural resource base is a necessary but insufficient condition for \nANR  sector  development.  Complementary  investments  must  raise  sector  productivity  on  a \nsustainable and equitable basis. \n \n13. \nThe  project  design  is  based  on  identified  sector  problems.  It  has  incorporated  lessons \nfrom previous interventions by taking a strategic approach, focusing on binding constraints, and \nmaximizing  donor  coordination.  It  integrates  with  other  ADB  interventions,  e.g.,  in  public \nexpenditure management and national and sector trade facilitation. A sector lending modality is \nrequired  because  it  is  necessary  to  (i)  address  sector  capacity  needs  centered  on  the  land \nissues;  and  (ii)  promote  increased  ANR  productivity  and  natural  resource  management  at  a \nrange of specific locations, with a variety of sector objectives (poverty reduction, food security, \ntrade  promotion,  etc.).  The  subproject  identification  and  selection  processes  will  ensure  that \ninclusive economic growth is fostered. \n\n \n\n\fONGOING EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE SECTOR \n\nDuration \n\nFunded by \n\nObjectives \n\nArea \n\nNam Ha Watershed Poverty \nReduction Project \n\nJul 2005\u2013\nJul 2009 \n\nCommunity development and \nsustainable land use management \n\nNine villages of Viengphoukha \ndistrict, Luang Namtha \n\nLong Alternative Development \nProject \n\nNCA (Norwegian \nChurch Aid) \n\n2004\u2013\n2009 \n\n40 villages in Long district, \nLuang Namtha \n\nExecuting \nAgency \n\nMinistry of \nAgriculture and \nForestry (MAF) \n\nAsian \nDevelopment Bank \n(ADB) \n$1.5 million \n\nNorwegian \nMinistry of Foreign \nAffairs (MFA)  \n \n\n2\n8\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n4\n \n\ni\n\nNam Chouam and Meung \nRural Development Project \n\nBokeo Provincial \nAgriculture and \nForestry Office \n\n2004\u2013\n2009 \n\nNCA \n \n\nLao-America Cooperation \nProject for Opium Free Areas \n\nMAF \n\nDec \n2004\u2013Dec \n2009 \n\nUSAID \n$4 million \n\nNorthern Community Managed \nIrrigation Project \n\nDepartment of \nIrrigation, MAF \n\n2005\u2013 \n2011 \n\nADB \n$10 million \n\nTo reduce opium plantation and \ndrugs by improving education, \nPublic health, agriculture, crop \nproduction, livestock, rice cattle and \nvaccine banks, community training \n\nDevelop education;

Provincial  project  offices  (PPOs)  will  conduct  public  awareness  campaigns  to  elicit \nsubproject proposals. These public awareness campaigns include meetings, workshops, radio, \nflyers,  and  other  types  of  media  to  reach  the  broader  rural  community.  They  will  disseminate \ninformation  such  as  a  general  description  of  potential  subprojects,  with  details  of  eligibility \ncriteria  and  subproject  value  limits  ($100,000\u2013$500,000),  and  a  subset  of  smaller  subprojects \nvalue  limits  ($20,000\u2013$100,000)  and  criteria  to  be  used  in  prioritizing  proposals,  as  well  as \napplication  and  processing  procedures.  PPOs  will  ensure  that  awareness  campaigns  are \nconducted  in  a  form,  manner,  and  language  that  enables  them  to  be  understood  by  ethnic \ngroups,  women,  and  other  vulnerable  groups  within  rural  communities\u2014particularly  in  priority \npoor districts and upland areas. \n \nB. \n\nCandidate Subproject Proposals \n\n2. \nThe  first  step  will  be  to  identify  subproject  proposals  that  can  be  developed  into \ncandidate subprojects by the district authorities. This will enable initial screening of proposals at \nthe  district  level  so  that  certain  subproject  proposals  can  be  developed  further  into  feasibility \nstudies.  Each  year,  the  provincial  vice  governor  will  issue  a  call  for  proposals  from  interested \ncandidates  working  in  rural  development.  The  PCO  will  specify  a  format  in  which  subproject \nproposals should be submitted, and candidate proposals will need to be submitted to the district \ngovernor\u2019s office in that format. This format would include at least (i) proponent contact details \nwith summary credentials; (ii) an outline of scope and coverage of the subproject; (iii) an outline \nof summary costs; (iv) identification of main benefits and beneficiaries; and (v) an indication of \nwhether  there  was  any  particular  social  (e.g.,  particularly  benefiting  disadvantaged  or  remote \nethnic communities) or environmental issues associated with the subproject.  \n \n3. \nCandidate  proposals  that  also  demonstrate  the  following  will  be  prioritized:  (i)  links  to \nongoing  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  initiatives  or  proposals  (e.g.,  the  subproject \nproduces  outputs  that  are  traded  across  borders,  access  the  East\u2013West  Economic  Corridor, \nand benefit from GMS customs harmonization procedures; or involve technology transfer and/or \nskills  enhancement  from  a  neighboring  GMS  country);  or  (ii)  the  potential  for  positive  climate \nchange  impacts  (ideally  being  eligible  for  support  under  schemes  such  as  the  Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism or the Asian Development Bank [ADB] Climate Change Fund). There \nare \nto \ncommercialization  of  agriculture,  (ii)  those  contributing  to  poverty  reduction,  and  (iii)  those \ncontributing  primarily  to  resource  management.  To  ensure  that  the  Project  supports  balanced \nrepresentation  among  these  categories,  a  ranking  mechanism  that  relies  on  weighting  various \ncriteria to prioritize subprojects among these categories will be developed. This will be based on \nthe  proposed  ranking  mechanism  below  (paras.  13\u201316),  to  allow  subproject  proposals  from \neach  category  to  compete  for  funding  approval.  Subproject  proposals  to  be  implemented  in \npriority  poor  districts  will  receive  additional  weighting  to  elevate  their  priority  in  the  selection \nprocess. \n \n4. \nCandidate  proposals  received  at  district  level  will  be  referred  to  PPOs.  Assisted  by \ntechnical  assistance  consultants  recruited  to  support  provincial  management  of  the  Project, \nPPOs will screen subprojects for eligibility in accordance with the following criteria:  \n \n\nthree  expected  categories  of  subprojects: \n\nthose  contributing  primarily \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\n(xiii) \n\n(xiv) \n\nThe  subproject  has  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  greater \nthan 10%\u201312%. \nThe subproject conforms to the recipient\u2019s Sixth National Socio Economic \nDevelopment Plan (2006\u20132010)1 and provincial agricultural development \nstrategies acceptable to the recipient and ADB. \nThe  subproject  will  be  an  agriculture  project  based  on  proven  technical \nparameters and implementation arrangements within the province or in a \nlocation  with  a  similar  agricultural  and  ecological  environment  for  the \nbenefit of smallholders.  \nThe  subproject  will  be  identified  and  prioritized  based  on  the  needs \nassessment  and  any  updates  thereto,  and  will  be  further  selected  and \ndesigned  taking  beneficiary  and  affected  person  consultations  into \naccount.  \nThe  subproject  reflects  the  requirement  for  a  reasonable  balance  of \nactivities among communities and districts. \nThe  subproject  will  have  a  significant  potential  impact  on  poverty \nreduction; and target poor districts, poor households, ethnic groups, and \nwomen. \nThe subproject plans have been published in a form, manner, and place \nthat  makes  them  available  to  affected  people;  public  comments  have \nbeen invited; and comments, including objections, have been published. \nThe subproject must be technically feasible and represent the least-cost \nalternative,  taking  into  account  the  need  to  provide  for  a  reasonable \nincrease in demand in the future.  \nThe  subproject  is  to  be  conducted  within  an  institutional  framework  that \ndemonstrates  the  likelihood  that  it  will  be  financially  and  institutionally \nsustainable, including operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. \nThe  equipment,  materials,  and  other  resources  can  be  acquired  in,  or \ntransported  to,  the  subproject  location  without  unreasonable  obstruction \nor delay.  \nThe  subproject  can  be  completed  within  the  project  implementation \nperiod.  \nThe  subproject  is  in  compliance  with  the  laws  of  the  recipient,  including \nits environmental requirements, ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), ADB\u2019s \nforest  policy, 2  and  the  environmental  requirements  set  forth  in  the \nenvironment  assessment  and \n(Supplementary \nAppendix K). For subprojects that require an environmental assessment, \nit  is  included  in  the  subproject  proposal,  and  the  Government\u2019s \nenvironmental clearance is obtained prior to the award of the subproject \ncontract.  \nThe  subproject  will  involve  minimal  land  acquisition  or  involuntary \nresettlement.  If  either  of  these  is  required  for  a  subproject,  it  will  be \nconducted  in  conformity  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy \n(1995) and the resettlement framework (Supplementary Appendix I) \nThe subproject complies with ADB's Policy on Idigenous Peoples (1998) \nand  the  conditions  set  forth  in  the  ethnic  group  development  framework \n(Supplementary Appendix H). \n\nframework \n\nreview \n\n                                                 \n1  Committee  for  Planning  and  Investment.  2006.

PPOs  will  report  the \noutcome  to  proponents,  with  a  copy  to  the  district  governor\u2019s  office,  and  if  a  subproject  is \nrejected,  they  will  state  the  reasons  for  rejection,  to  provide  a  learning  process  and  enhance \ntransparency.  Initial  screening  by  PPOs  should  be  completed  within  1  month  of  receipt  of \nproposals. \n \n6. \nA  full  feasibility  study  for  each  candidate  subproject  will  be  carried  out  under  the \nsupervision of the PPO and by relevant line agencies, in close consultation with sponsors and \nproposers, assisted by project\u2013funded technical assistance as required. The PCO will develop \nstandard  requirements  for  the  detailed  feasibility  study  that  are  acceptable  to  ADB  and  will \ninform PPOs of these requirements. The PCO should also address all compulsory and scored \ncriteria  outlined  below  (paras.13\u201316)  to  facilitate  comparison  between  projects  of  a  different \ncategory.  They  will  include  clear  identification  of  the  O&M  expenditures  necessary  to  sustain \neconomic  benefits.  Completed  feasibility  studies  will  be  submitted  to  the  relevant  PPO  for \nprioritizing, using the prescribed criteria and ranking system. \n \nC. \n\nEligible Subproject Proposals \n\nThe prioritization of candidate subprojects into eligible subprojects for submission to the \n\n7. \nnational level will be undertaken in accordance with the ranking mechanism below.  \n \n8. \nAll technical and financial estimates used in  the feasibility studies should be ratified by \nqualified personnel available within the province. Based on the adjusted weightings assigned to \neach  candidate  subproject  feasibility  study  (paras.13\u201316  below),  a  summary  report  will  be \nsubmitted  to  the  provincial  coordination  committee  for  consideration.  Those  recommended  by \nthe provincial coordination committee shall be forwarded to the PCO while those rejected will be \nreturned to the proponent with an explanation of the reasons behind the decision. \n \nThe PCO shall refer the feasibility studies to a technical review committee to confirm the \n9. \ntechnical basis for the subprojects. The technical review committee will comprise experts from \nrelevant ministries and departments, including but not limited to Agriculture and Forestry and its \nvarious departments, Water Resources and Environment Administration, Commerce and Trade, \nCommunication,  Transport  Post  and  Construction,  etc.  Others  may  be  co-opted  from  the \nGovernment or private sector as required. After receiving technical confirmation, the PCO shall \nrefer  eligible  subprojects  to  the  national  project  steering  committee  (NPSC)  for  approval  and \nfunding commitment.  \n \n10. \nBecause  of  the  importance  of  adequately  maintaining  rural  infrastructure  to  sustain \nbenefit  flows,  provinces  in  which  subprojects  are  to  be  located  will  be  required  to  sign \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\ncommitments  that  they  are  prepared  to  meet  the  identified  O&M  expenditures  with  matching \ngrants  from  the  Project  under  a  well-defined  institutional  and  financial  recovery  arrangement. \nFailure of provinces to sign such commitments or to provide the O&M  funds once subprojects \nare implemented will disqualify them from submitting future proposals.   \n \n11. \nA works and service contract will then be developed by the PCO in cooperation with the \nrelevant national agency, depending on the nature of the approved subproject. This contract will \nspecify  the  time  frame,  financing,  benchmarks,  disbursement  schedule,  and  reporting \nrequirements for each subproject. Failure by the contractor or service provider to adhere to the \nagreement will lead to suspension of financing. In the first 2 years, subprojects will be required \nto  obtain  no  objections  from  ADB  and  the  International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development \n(IFAD). \n \nD. \n\nPrioritization Mechanism \n\n12. \nApart from the criteria used in the screening process, additional criteria will be used to \nfacilitate the prioritization of subprojects given their different objectives and outcomes. A score- \nbased system will be adopted for the three categories of subprojects: (i) rural poverty-focused \nsubprojects, \nresource \nmanagement-based  projects.  Different  weightings  will  be  applied  to  the  different  types  of \nsubprojects to facilitate this prioritization process.  \n \n\nrural  commercialization-based  subprojects,  and \n\n(iii)  natural \n\n(ii) \n\n1. \n\nRural Poverty Reduction Subprojects \n\nFor rural poverty reduction subprojects, the indicators shall have the following weights: \n13. \n(i)  A  =  the  EIRR  (10%);  (ii)  B  =  the  number  of  individuals  below  the  established  poverty  line \nassisted per $1,000 invested (40%); (iii) C = the equity contribution of beneficiaries (10%); and \n(iv)  D  =  the  district  is  considered  poor  (40%).  The  first  criterion  is  an  indication  of  economic \nviability,  the  second  an  indicator  of  project  impact  and  efficiency  of  impact  (particularly  on \npoverty  reduction),  the  third  is  an  indicator  of  ownership  by  subproject  proponents  or \nbeneficiaries,  and  the  fourth  is  to  ensure  prioritization  of  proposals  from  priority  poor/upland \ndistricts.  \n \n14. \nThe highest data for each of the evaluation criteria from the subprojects being evaluated \nwill be given a rating of 1.00 point. The scores for evaluation criteria of the other proposals will \nbe computed accordingly as a ratio to the highest score. Proposals will be ranked according to \ntheir combined scores using the formula below: \n \n\nI = (0.10\u00d7A) + (0.40\u00d7B) + (0.10\u00d7C) + (0.40\u00d7D) \n \n\n2. \n\nRural Commercialization Subprojects \n\n15. \nFor  rural  commercialization  subprojects,  the  criteria  indicators  shall  have  the  following \nweights: (i) A = the EIRR (60%); (ii) B = the number of individuals below the established poverty \nline assisted per $1,000 invested, excluding labor in kind (15%); (iii) C = the equity contribution \nof  beneficiaries  (25%). Proposals  will  be  ranked  according  to  their  combined  scores  using  the \nfollowing formula: \n \n\nI = (0.60\u00d7A) + (0.15\u00d7B) + (0.25\u00d7C) \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n35\n\n3. \n\nNatural Resources Management Subprojects \n\n16. \nFor  natural  resources  management  subprojects,  an  additional  indicator  is  needed  to \nquantify  the  degree  of  threat  to  the  resource.  This  will  be  calculated  on  a  score  of  1\u20135,  with \n1 being a low level of threat, and 5 being an extreme and immediate threat to the resource. The \ndegree of threat will be confirmed by an environmental specialist during the feasibility study, and \nconfirmed at later stages of assessment. An extreme and immediate threat would mean that the \nproposal  is  more  deserving  of  an  investment  to  mitigate  the  threat.  For  natural  resource \nmanagement  subprojects,  the  criteria  indicators  shall  have  the  following  weights:  (i)  A  =  the \nEIRR (25%); (ii) B = the number of individuals below the established poverty line assisted per \n$1,000 invested (25%); (iii) C = the equity contribution of beneficiaries (25%); and (iv) D = the \ndegree of threat (25%). Proposals will be ranked according to their combined scores using the \nfollowing formula: \n \n\nI = (0.25\u00d7A) + (0.25\u00d7B) + (0.25\u00d7C) + (0.25\u00d7D) \n\n \nE. \n\nProvincial Grant Allocations \n\n17. \nThe allocation of grant funds between provinces for the implementation of subprojects is \nproposed to be made through an initial equal allocation of $2 million to each of the provinces, \nand can be supplemented by a proportional allocation based on the number of poor households \nwithin the project area. This will ensure that the upland and resource poor provinces have the \nopportunity  to  receive  an  allocation  based  on  the  incidence  of  poverty.  This  constitutes  a \nde facto measure for poverty targeting, but also provides a fair means for allocation among the \nprovinces with their diverse capital base. Allocation of grant funds among potential subprojects \nin  accordance  with  their  orientation  (poverty  reduction,  commercialization,  or  natural  resource \nmanagement)  will  be  addressed  through  the  assignment  of  weightings  in  the  prioritization \nprocess  mentioned  above  (paras.  13\u201316).  Progress  will  be  evaluated  after  1  year,  and \nsubsequent allocation will be made based on performance vis-\u00e0-vis predetermined indicators. \n \n\nTable A5: A possible Proposed Allocation of Subproject Funds between Provinces \n\n \nProvince \n\nAttapeu \nChampassak \nSalavane \nSavannakhet \nSekong \n\nTotal \n\nPopulation \n(000) \n \n100.7 \n552.0 \n287.9 \n755.8 \n72.0 \n1,768.4 \n\n# of Poor \n(000) \n\n% Poor \n\n45.6 \n196.7 \n113.9 \n280.0 \n32.9 \n669.1 \n\n6.8 \n29.4 \n17.0 \n41.8 \n4.9 \n100 \n\nInitial \nAllocation \n($ '000) \n2,000 \n2,000 \n2,000 \n2,000 \n2,000 \n10,000 \n\nSupplementary \nAllocation \n($ \u2019000) \n554.1 \n2,390.3 \n1,3841.1 \n3,402.6 \n399.8 \n8,131.0 \n\nTotala \n \n($ \u2019000) \n2,554.1 \n4,390.3 \n3,384.1 \n5,402.6 \n2,399.8 \n18,131.0 \n\na  Only the budget for subprojects is used for allocation purpose. \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fSUMMARY COST ESTIMATES \n \nTable A.6.1: Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \n\n(Kip million) \n \n\nKip Million \nLocal \n\nTotal \n\nForeign \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n% Total Base \nCosts \n\n3\n6\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n6\n \n\ni\n\nItem \n\n A.

There  is  increased  recognition  of  the  need  to \nincorporate  social  and  environmental  safeguards  and  other  social  and  gender  compliance \nmeasures when preparing and implementing rural development projects. While this has been a \nrequirement  by  donors  for  some  time,  appreciation  of  the  benefits  from  their inclusion  has  not \nbeen  recognized  within  the  government  implementing  agencies.  Experience  from  recently \ncompleted projects demonstrates that staff in the line agencies (especially at the provincial level \nand  below)  do  not  appreciate  the  benefits  obtainable  from  compliance  (e.g.,  increasing \nownership,  making  designs  more  appropriate,  and  making  investments  sustainable).  Current \nlaws  and  decrees  devolve  responsibility  for  rural  development  to  local  administrations;  and \nassign  responsibilities  to  them  for  safeguards  in  respect  of  land  acquisition,  resettlement, \nenvironmental  impact  assessment,  and  mitigation  and  community  participation  in  decision \nmaking.  Similarly, \nthe  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will need to be addressed in the preparation of subprojects. \n \n3. \nThe  TA  (proposed  to  be  financed  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund)  will  fund  international \nand  national  specialists  to  develop  training  material  and  provide  on-the-job  training  as \nsubprojects are screened, prioritized, and evaluated. Under the TA, national and provincial staff \nwill  be  trained  to  ensure  that  social  and  environmental  safeguards  compliance  is  incorporated \ninto  investment  proposals,  and  to  monitor  adherence  of  approved  investments  with  specified \ncovenants. In addition, the TA will provide resources for equipment, materials, and training for \nthe  development  of  a  database  at  the  national  and  provincial  levels,  recording  information  on \n(i) social,  economic,  and  environmental  evaluations  of  feasibility  studies  for  investment \nproposals; and (ii) records for monitoring compliance with safeguards.  \n \nC. \n\nthe  policies  and  safeguard  compliance  requirements  of \n\nCosts and Financing \n\n4. \nIt  is  estimated  that  the  TA  will  cost  $800,000.  Of  this,  $700,000  will  be  financed  on  a \ngrant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government \nof the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) will provide $100,000 to cover incremental \nadministrative expenses, office space, local travel, and per diem for counterpart staff.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nThe  Sixth  National  Socio  Economic  Development  Plan  (2006\u20132010)  proposes  prioritized  investment  in  the \n47 poorest  districts  (12  of  which  are  in  the  project  area),  comprising  rural  infrastructure  to  improve  livelihoods  and \naccess.a  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry  (MAF)  has  used  this  plan  to  formulate  its  strategic  vision,  which \ncomprises four goals and 13 measures to achieve these goals. The four goals are (i) increased food production and \nsecurity;  (ii) increased  production  of  materials  for  agro-processing;  (iii)  stabilization  of  shifting  cultivation  (the  main \nstrategy  of  poverty  reduction  in  the  47  poorest  districts  while  providing  for  environmental  protection);  and \n(iv) sustainable  forest  management.  As  the  Project  will  develop  sector  management  capacities  and  finance \nsubprojects,  contributing  to  investment  in  resource  management  and  productivity  enhancement  management,  the \ndesign is supportive of sector objectives. \n \nThe  country  strategy  and  program  2007\u20132011  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  aims  to  promote  pro-poor, \nsustainable growth led by the private sector, by improving policies and institutional capacity to support broad-based, \nprivate  sector-led  growth.b  It  proposes  to  support  the  building  of  a  legal  and  regulatory  framework  and  developing \ncapacity  in  sectors  and  subsectors\u2014specifically  identifying  agriculture  as  a  target.  The  strategy  supports  greater \ninvolvement of civil society and mass organizations in the delivery of agriculture and basic social services. Support \nwill  be  provided  to  private  business  associations  to  improve  their  ability  to  network,  develop  business  skills,  and \nadvocate  on  behalf  of  their  membership\u2014expanding  livelihood  opportunities  for  rural  women  as  well  as  men  in \ncommercial agriculture and small and medium-sized enterprise development. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis \n1. Key Issues \nA key poverty issue is the impact from foreign direct investment (FDI) that limits smallholder access to land and forest \nresources from which smallholders obtain their traditional subsistence existence. There is poor coordination between \ncentral and provincial/district levels in the application of policies for FDI. The Government has the right to determine \nand change land categories, allowing local authorities to reclassify village land from \u201cproductive\u201d to \u201cunproductive\u201d to \nmeet concessionaires\u2019 demands. Procedures for awarding concessions are not clear and awards take place in an ad \nhoc fashion. This institutional weakness and poor governance is compounded by a lack of awareness of safeguard \nissues.  The  demand  for  land  by  plantation-style  FDI  has  been  directed  at  areas  previously  used  in  swidden \nproduction systems, where ethnic groups predominate and poverty is most apparent. Some 75% of poor households \ncountrywide are made up of members of  ethnic groups living in remote and upland areas on marginally productive \nland. \n \n2.  Design Features \nTo  address  these  issues,  the  Project  will  develop  the  capacities  of  the  provincial  agriculture  and  forestry  offices  to \nidentify land suitability for a range of potential crops so that informed decisions can be made  when allocating land. \nThe  capacity  building  will  extend  to  strengthening  agency  staff\u2019s  understanding  of  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards  to  protect  the  interests  of  traditional  users  of  the  resources  under  consideration.  The  Project  will  also \nprovide  funding  for  demand-based  rural  infrastructure  and  other  successful  subprojects  to  increase  agricultural \nproductivity  to  facilitate  smallholder  participation  in  commercialization  in  the  market  economy.  While  many  of  the \nsubprojects  are  expected  to  be  small-scale  rural  infrastructure  investments,  subproject  design  will  incorporate  land \ntenure  activities  to  protect  the  interests  of  traditional  land-users  in  subproject  areas.  The  skills  developed  in  land \nsuitability  mapping  using  geographic  information  systems  can  readily  be  applied  to  subproject  design  to  demark \nprotected  and  production  forest  areas  to  be  managed  by  villagers.  These  subprojects  will  be  selected  through  a \nscreening  process,  using  established  criteria  and  safeguards  outlined  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C,  which  ensure \nidentification  of  appropriate  beneficiaries  with  attention  to  gender  issues  and  indigenous  people\u2019s  concerns.  The \nProject  will  train  implementing  staff  in  developing  and  applying  mechanisms  for  the  participation  of  all  vulnerable \ngroups, women, and ethnic minorities; and ensuring community demand is articulated. \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n47\n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\n \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nIn the year 2000\u201301, 304,100 households were classified \u201cpoor\u201d throughout the country. This decreased to 166,600 \nby  2005.  The  population  of  the  five  target  provinces  is  1.8  million,  ranging  from  0.8  million  in  Savannakhet  to \n0.11 million  in  Sekong.  While  the  poor  represent  38%  of  the  project  area\u2019s  population,  the  incidence  of  poverty  in \nparticipating provinces varies from 42% in Savannakhet to only 5% in Sekong and 7% in Attapeu. The provinces with \nthe greatest number and highest percentage of poor are Savannakhet and Champassak. At the village and  district \nlevel,  other  factors  are  brought  into  consideration  in  assessing  poverty,  including  access  to  education,  health \nservices, road access, as well as access to clean drinking water. These criteria significantly alter the perspective of \npoverty from the income-based assessment with individual households. \n \nThere  are  40  districts  in  the  five  provinces,  of  which  19  are  considered  priority  poor  (7  in  Savannakhet,  4  in \nChampassak, 3 in Salavan and Attapeu each, and 2 in Sekong). Within these poor districts, household poverty levels \naverage over 50% although Champassak has a figure closer to 20%. Assessed on a village basis, about 70% of the \nvillages are poor; this ranges from 50% in Champassak to over 80% in Attapeu and Sekong. Proportional figures are \nmisleading,  though,  and  the  actual  numbers  of  poor  households  are  by  far  the  greatest  in  Savannakhet  and \nChampassak, accounting for over 70% of the poor households in the participating provinces. A further dimension of \npoverty  relates  to  the  predominance  of  ethnic  groups  within  the  target  area.  About  half  of  the  population  in  the \nfive provinces  is  comprised  of  indigenous  peoples  known  in  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  as \nethnic  groups,  mostly  from  the  Mon-Khmer  language  family.  The  proportion  of  ethnic  groups  is  highest  in  Sekong \n(88%) and Attapeu (63%) but actual numbers are greatest in Savannakhet and Champassak. Poverty is significantly \nhigher among minority groups than in lowland Lao communities. \n \nBecause  of  this  isolation,  villagers  are  heavily  dependent  on  forest  access  for  daily  edibles  and  non-timber  forest \nproducts, some of which are sold to earn cash for food purchase. In the five provinces, there are serious economic \nconsequences  for  poor  villagers  that  lose  access  to  forest  resources  through  unrestrained  concession  award  and \nunplanned  relocation.  Some  concessionaires  are  clearing  and  converting  forestland  contrary  to  government  policy. \nFDI has increased the risk of staple food shortages. Ethnic minority villages are required to cease shifting cultivation \nand resettle at lower elevations, forming larger communities where government services can be provided.c  \n \nAnother  difficulty  with  merged  administrations  from  resettlement  is  that  several  different  ethnic  groups  are  often \ngrouped together in one village or location, requiring longer preparation time for consultation with each set of elders. \nThose villages that have been resettled within walking distance of their old land continue to grow upland rice in these \nlocations. However, because of the distance to these fields, they are not able to clear, plant, and maintain as large an \narea  as  before.  In  addition,  some  villagers  complain  of  declining  production  caused  by  a  combination  of  increased \npopulation  (as  a  result  of  merging  of  villages)  and  land  degradation.  Government  policy  on  reducing  shifting \ncultivation may also have limited village access to sufficient productive land. \n \n \nB. \n1. During the implementation of the TA, workshops and a number of meetings in provincial, district offices and \nvillages were organized to seek views of stakeholders. During fact-finding mission (August 2008) a number of \nprovincial and district government officials were consulted together with villages that had experience with FDI. \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring? \n  \n\nConsultation and Participation \n\n  Information sharing   \n\n  Consultation   \n\n  Collaborative decision making   \n\n  Empowerment \n\n No \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3. Was a consultation and participation (C&P) plan prepared?   \n \nA C&P plan has been prepared and this is mainstreamed into the gender, disadvantaged persons and ethnic group \naction  plan.  Subproject  identification  is  based  on  community  demand.  Mechanisms  have  been  designed  to  ensure \ncommunity participation and consultation in subproject survey, design and implementation. Government officers will \nbe  trained  in  subproject  preparation  and  implementation  that  require  high  local  participation.  The  C&P  recognizes \nthat ethnic groups and subgroups in communities require specific measures in order that their development priorities \nare  articulated.  Government  staff  will  receive  training  in  C&P  and  participatory  methods  including  gender  and \ndisadvantaged  group  strategies.  The  Project  will  engage  local  community  assistance  in  the  implementation  of \nsubprojects particularly in ethnic group communities utilizing skilled local people as community organizers assisting \nproject staff. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n48 \n \n\nC. Gender and Development \n \n1. Key Issues \nRural  Lao  women  are  primarily  responsible  for  maintaining  family  food  security,  a  role  often  underestimated. \nPrevailing cultural values tend to disadvantage women in terms of their participation in politics and decision-making \nprocesses,  and  they  are  underrepresented  in  village  committees.  Similarly,  ethnic  group  women  are  not  well \npresented  in  government,  particularly  extension  workers,  health  care  workers,  and  teachers.  By  virtue  of  their \ngeographic  location,  they  are  isolated  from  resources  and  services.  They  are  also  the  least  able  to  participate  in \ndecision  making,  partly  because  of  illiteracy  and  cultural  traditions.  Linguistic  barriers  and  cultural  attitudes  toward \neducation  perpetuate  low  human  development  and  the  vicious  cycle  of  poverty  in  which  many  ethnic  groups  find \nthemselves. \n \nThe  Government  has  asked  all  ministries  to  develop  strategies  and  action  plans  to  promote  gender  equality  at \nnational, provincial, district, and village levels. Line agencies have begun to mainstream gender concerns. However, \nMAF has not started integrating gender into its planning cycle; its main efforts are in donor-funded projects. MAF has \na  gender  focal  point  and  women  advancement  committee  but  its  role  and  responsibilities  are  not  clear\u2014nor  is  it \nstrong  enough  to  integrate  gender  policies  into  practice.  Constraints  on  gender  mainstreaming  in  MAF  are  a  poor \nunderstanding of gender concept and strategies, lack of resource persons with gender professional knowledge, and \nno statistical information related to gender issues. \n \nLand rights of women show a difference in the names and or titles that appear on the land documents and the origin \nof  the  land.  Only  16%  of  land  was  registered  in  the  wife\u2019s  name,  although  40%  of  the  land  came  from  the  wife\u2019s \nparents. Fifty-eight percent of land was registered in the husband\u2019s name, although only 18% of the land came from \nthe husband\u2019s parents. Part of this situation can be attributed to the lack of knowledge on and difficulty in accessing \ninformation on women\u2019s land rights. In addition, except for selected Mon-Khmer groups such as Brao, it is a generally \nheld view that men are the head of household, so their names appear on administrative documents. \n \n2.  Key Actions \nMeasures  included  in  the  design  to  promote  gender  equality  and  women\u2019s  empowerment\u2014access  to  and  use  of \nrelevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n \n\n  Gender plan       \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\nA gender and disadvantaged group strategy has been formulated to ensure women\u2019s participation in the articulaton \nof  needs,  and  priorities  in  decision  making  are  facilitated.  Criteria  for  subproject  identification,  preparation,  and \nimplementation include attention to gender issues. Subprojects should be sensitive to women\u2019s time constraints that \nare determined by seasonal agricultural requirements and cultural differences. The gender action plan (Appendix 13 \nand  Supplementary  Appendix  J)  ensures  consultation  with  local  women  in  the  design  of  new  subprojects \n(productivity,  commercialization,  and  natural  resource  management)  and  assures  that  they  participate  in  project \nactivities, including extension services and training. \n \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nStrategy to Address Issue \n\nOther Measures \n\nIssue \nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nImpact \n\nLimited \n\n \n\n Full Plan \n Short Plan \n Resettlement \nFramework \n No Action \n\nSubproject eligibility is confined to \ncategory B subprojects.

The Project will generate three main outputs covering: (i) \ncapacity  building  in  sector  management,  (ii)  agricultural  productivity  and  commercialization \nsubprojects,  and  (iii) project  management.  Table  A11  summarizes  the  Project\u2019s  anticipated \nbenefits and adverse impacts on ethnic groups.  \n \n\nTable A11: Anticipated Benefits and Impacts \n\n \n\n \n\nComponent \nA.

Identified ethnic groups in the provinces \nbelong to seven different Austro-Asiatic language groups and subgroups, including 13 Bahnaric \n(6 Bahnaric, 6 Bahnaric West, 1 Bahnaric North); 2 Palaungic; 9 Katuic; and 1 Vietic.  \n \n3. \nThe main impact of the Project on ethnic groups will be through subproject implementation \nunder  component  2.2 The  process  of  identification  of  subprojects  will  be  driven  by  community \ndemand.  Requests  will  be  forwarded  from  the  community  to  the  line  agency  technically \nresponsible  for  the  proposed  subproject.  Most  requests  will  probably  be  for  the  rehabilitation  of \nrural infrastructure such as feeder roads, irrigation, or post-harvest improvements. However, the \nrange  of  subprojects  will  include  others  that  contribute  to  increasing  agriculture  productivity. \nThese  proposals  are  supposed  to  be  the  result  of  a  community\u2019s  internal  consultation  and \nconsensus\u2014leading to an official request signed and stamped by the village head (and kumban \n(village  cluster)  head  if  applicable),  and  being  submitted  to  the  district.  Specific  ethnic  group \ndevelopment  plans  will  be  formulated  on  a  case-by-case  basis  as  subprojects  funded  under \n\n                                                 \n1   Attapeu 63%, Champassack 15%, Salavane 42%, Savannakhet 38%, and Sekong 87%.  \n2   Ethnic  groups  will  benefit  rather  indirectly  from  component  1  activities  (other  than  capacity  building  on  farmer, \n\nproducer, and water user associations). \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n51\n\ncomponent  2  are  identified  and  approved  for  full  feasibility and  then  implementation.  Therefore, \nthe main purpose of this framework is to assist in the preparation of an ethnic group development \nplan (EGDP), which will be attached to the subproject feasibility studies under component 2. \n \n4. \nand evaluating an EGDP. \n \n\nThe  Project  adopts  the  following  procedure  for  preparing,  implementing,  and  monitoring \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nSubproject  selection  screening.  The  Project  has  established  eligibility  and \nselection  criteria  for  component  2  subprojects.  These  provide  a  pro-poor  scoring \nmechanism that would facilitate higher scores in ethnic group communities if these \ncommunities suffer a higher incidence of poverty. \nMobilization of ethnic group local resource person. At the subproject feasibility \nstudy  stage,  it  is  important  that  ethnic  group  communication  is  facilitated  by  the \nuse  of  local  ethnic  group  resource  persons.  The  Project  will  provide  a  daily \nallowance ($200 per subproject) for assistance provided from key local people who \nwill  assist  in  conducting  meetings,  disseminating  information,  and  facilitating \nparticipatory consultations. \nFeasibility  study.  Ethnic  group  focal  groups  are  formed  at  the  feasibility  study \nphase to ensure that all groups and subgroups have been given the opportunity to \nenter  the  discussion;  and  that  decisions  taken  are  transparent,  equitable,  and \nsupported by the community. It would help the Project to ensure that subprojects \ndo  not  threaten  traditional  and  practiced  ethnic  group  livelihood  systems,  and  do \nnot  require  the  adoption  of  totally  new  livelihood  systems  They  will  participate  in \ndeciding road alignment or irrigation canal alignments, or the location and design \nof  other  infrastructure  to  ensure  they  are  not  disadvantaged  and  have  equal \naccess to the investment\u2019s benefits. \nEstablishment of committees. For rural infrastructure projects such as road and \nirrigation  development,  the  Project  will  establish  (a)  a  construction  committee  (at \nthe  survey,  design,  and  project  planning  stage);  and  (b)  an  infrastructure \nmanagement  committee  for  ongoing  management  and  operations.  Any  such \nbodies established at community level to provide these functions will include ethnic \ngroup  representation  at  a  level  appropriate  to  the  proportionate  number  of  ethnic \ngroup households in the community. \nImpact  monitoring  and  evaluation. \nthe  ethnic  group \ndevelopment  framework  or  plan  will  be  integrated  in  the  Project\u2019s  project \nperformance monitoring system. Implementation monitoring will be undertaken by \nthe Government (project coordination office and provincial project offices) as part \nof its normal project management responsibilities, while benefit monitoring will be \nundertaken  periodically \nindependent \n(annually  after  year  2) \norganization or institution. \n\nImplementation  of \n\nthrough  an \n\n \n5. \nSafeguards relating to ethnic groups and implementation of the ethnic group development \nframework/EGDP will be built into the subproject feasibility study process. Actual implementation \nwill  be  assisted  by  the  project  consultants,  both  the  long-term  advisers  in  the  provinces  (324 \nperson-months) and also at the central level by the project coordination office adviser (24 person-\nmonths).  The  Project  will  also  mobilize  short-term  specialist  input  on  ethnic  groups  and  gender \nand the environment (28 person-months). These short-term specialists will also be involved in the \nsubproject  identification,  screening,  and  approval  process  to  ensure  that  safeguards  are  being \napplied in accordance with policy and project design. In line with their terms of reference, they will \nprovide  written  assessments  to  project  management  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank. \nPreparation of the EGDP is included in the budget for preparation of subproject feasibility studies \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n\n \n1. \nProject  Background.  The  Sustainable  Natural  Resources  Management  and \nProductivity  Enhancement  Project  (the  Project)  comprises  (i)  capacity  building  of  central  and \nprovincial  agencies  in  natural  resource  management  techniques  and  procedures;  (ii)  the \nimplementation  of  a  number  of  subprojects  of  value  from  $100,000  and  $500,000  to  facilitate \nrural  development  within  the  target  provinces  of  Attapeu,  Champassak  Saravane,  Savannakhet, \nand  Sekong;  and  (iii)  project  management  and  implementation  support.  The  subprojects  to  be \nincluded  in  the  Project  will  be  selected  during  implementation  on  the  basis  of  agreed  criteria, \nincluding  the  number  of  people  expected  to  benefit,  poverty  level  of  beneficiaries,  minimal \namount  of \nimpact,  and  environmental  sustainability. \nImplementation of the subprojects will enable rural communities in the project area to maximize \ntheir  benefits  from  the  proposed  intervention.  Eligible  subprojects  involving  rural  infrastructure \nprojects  will  include  rehabilitation  of  rural  roads,  access  tracks,  and  the  construction  and/or \nrehabilitation  of  small-  and  medium-scale  irrigation.  Other  eligible  subprojects  might  include \ninitiatives  that  are  not  related  to  infrastructure,  such  as  the  extension  of  technical  support \nservices to common interest farmer groups, or improving the linkages between producer groups \nand processors. Detailed design of subprojects, regardless of their nature, will explore all viable \noptions to reduce the requirements for land acquisition and resettlement to the extent feasible. \n\nresettlement  and  environmental \n\nPreparation  of  Resettlement  Plans.  Improvement  of  rural  access  roads,  irrigation \n2. \nfacilities, and other rural infrastructure will be within existing road alignments, irrigation facilities, \netc. as much as possible. In addition, priority will be given to avoiding or minimizing resettlement \nimpacts.  Therefore,  the  need  for  resettlement  plans  will  be  relatively  small.  Resettlement \nimpacts, if any, are expected not to be significant (category B), so short resettlement plans will \nbe prepared. \n\n3. \nLegal and Policy Framework. The resettlement framework is developed from the laws \nand  decrees  of  the  Government  of  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  and  the \nrelevant  policies  and  guidelines  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  Provisions  and \nprinciples  adopted  in  the  resettlement  framework  will  supplement  the  provisions  of  relevant \ndecrees currently in force in the Lao PDR wherever a gap exists. \n\nObjectives  and  Entitlements.  The  overall  policy  objective  is  to  ensure  that  all  people \n4. \naffected  by  the  Project  will  be  able  to  restore  their  pre-project  conditions,  while  the  poor  and \nvulnerable households will be able to improve their pre-project living standards. Compensation \nwill be based on the principle of replacement cost while additional assistance in cash and kind \nwill also be provided, depending on the severity of impacts. Relocation and income restoration \nmeasures for severely affected and vulnerable households will be designed and implemented in \nconsultation with affected persons during resettlement plan preparation. Voluntary donation will \nnot  be  applied  for  any  assets,  except  very  minor  losses  of  residential  land.  The  Project  will \nidentify  any  specific  needs  or  concerns  to  be  considered  for  indigenous  peoples  groups  and \nother  vulnerable  groups  such  as  the  landless,  poor,  and  households  headed  by  women, \ndisabled,  elderly,  or  children  without  means  of  support.  A  gender  strategy  and  ethnic  group \nspecific actions, as required, will be included in the subproject resettlement plan. \n \n5. \nConsultation  and  Disclosure.  Consultation  will  be  undertaken  prior  to  finalization  of \ndetailed  design  so  that  affected  persons\u2019  requests  and  suggestions  to  minimize  resettlement \nimpacts  can  be  incorporated  into  the  design  as  far  as  is  practicable.  Consultation  and \nparticipation activities will continue throughout project implementation to ensure that information \nabout  the  overall  Project  and  resettlement-related  information  is  properly  understood  and \naccepted by the affected persons. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n53\n\n \n6. \nImplementation Arrangements. The Project will be managed by a project coordination \noffice (PCO) to be established within the Department of Planning of the Ministry of Agriculture \nand Forestry (MAF). The PCO will be responsible for day-to-day management of the Project. At \nthe provincial level, the Provincial Governors\u2019 Office with its provincial project offices (PPOs) will \nbe  responsible  for  overall  coordination  of  organizations  involved  in  resettlement  and  for \nresettlement plan preparation and updating, supervision, and management of resettlement plan \nimplementation. A resettlement committee will be established in each province to prepare and \nimplement resettlement plans, and will be supported by safeguards consultants. In accordance \nwith  Decree  192/PM,  the  Water  Resources  and  Environment  Administration  (WREA)  and  its \nrespective provincial representative offices will review and approve the resettlement plan prior to \nsubmission  to  ADB.  WREA  is  also  responsible  for  monitoring  of  resettlement  activities.  It  will \nreview all internal and external monitoring reports and undertake periodic inspections. \n\n7. \nGrievance  Redress. At the central level, within MAF\u2019s Department of Planning, a task \nforce will be established to receive and resolve complaints and grievances or act upon reports \nfrom  stakeholders  on  projects  in  general,  including  grievances  caused  by  resettlement  and \nenvironmental issues. At the project level, the grievance procedure uses a five-step approach, \ni.e., affected persons can lodge their complaint with the village officials first and the case will be \nforwarded to the district, provincial and central level if the case is unresolved or not satisfactory \nto the affected persons. The last resort will be lodged with the Court of Law, whose decision will \nbe  final.  Affected  persons  will  be  made  fully  aware  of  the  grievance  process  and  their  rights \nverbally and in writing during consultation, survey, and time of compensation. \n \n8. \nMonitoring and Budget. Primary responsibility for internal monitoring will lie with PPOs \nas  implementing  agencies  responsible  for  overseeing  the  formation,  function,  and  activities  of \neach  of  the  implementing  agencies  for  subprojects;  and  through  quarterly  monitoring  reports. \nThe Ministry of Finance will be responsible for the disbursement of funds to each of the relevant \nProvincial Governor\u2019s Offices. These funds will be managed by the resettlement committee. The \nGovernment  will  ensure  timely  provision  of  counterpart  funds  for  resettlement  to  meet  any \nunforeseen  obligations  in  excess  of  the  resettlement  budget  estimates  to  satisfy  resettlement \nrequirements  and  objectives.  ADB  and  International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development  grant \nfunds will be utilized for compensation for non-land assets, provision of necessary allowances, \nspecial  assistance  to  be  provided  to  vulnerable  affected  persons,  development  of  individual \nreplacement  plots,  administration  costs,  and  external  monitoring.  The  resettlement  plans  will \nidentify  key  activities  for  which  funds  will  be  used,  any  disbursal  milestones,  and  auditing \nrequirements that will facilitate appropriate and timely delivery. \n \n9. \nImplementation  Schedule. Land acquisition, compensation, and relocation of affected \npersons cannot commence until the resettlement plan, when required for individual subprojects, \nhas been reviewed and approved by ADB. Civil works may commence in sections where there \nare  no  resettlement  impacts.  All  resettlement  activities  will  be  coordinated  with  the  civil  works \nschedule.  The  PPO  will  not  allow  construction  activities  in  specific  sites  until  all  resettlement \nactivities  have  been  satisfactorily  completed,  agreed  rehabilitation  assistance  is  in  place,  and \nthe site is free of all encumbrances. \n\n10. \nDisclosure  of  Resettlement  Planning  Documents.  This  resettlement  framework  will \nbe uploaded on the ADB website before appraisal. The PPO and resettlement committees will \nbe responsible for disclosure of the resettlement plan to affected persons prior to submission to \nADB. ADB will upload the final resettlement plan on ADB\u2019s resettlement webpage. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nComponent \n\nA. Capacity \nBuilding in \nSector \nManagement \n\nB.

However,  because  of  the  significant  number  and  location  of \npotential  subprojects  within  the  target  provinces,  it  was  not  possible  to  identify  all  subprojects \nduring design\u2014nor was it appropriate, as the Government  has already demonstrated capacity \nto implement a sector modality project. The Project also seeks to influence policy development \nand thereby qualifies as a sector loan. More detailed analysis of two representative subprojects \n(to  confirm  they  are  economically  viable  and  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction)  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix L. Further material on the sector (including its planning context) is in \nAppendix 3. \n \nB. \n\nRationale for Government and ADB Involvement \n\nland  has \n\nincidence  of  conflict  over \n\n2. \nThe  Government  is  ultimately  responsible  for  management  of  the  country\u2019s  natural \nresources  to  ensure  their  current  and  continuing  productivity.  With  the  recent  and  largely \nunmanaged  surge  in  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI),  negative  impacts  are  already  becoming \nobvious.  The \nincreased  dramatically,  with  both \nconcessionaires and traditional landowners uncertain of their rights. FDI has effectively denied \naccess  by  traditional  users  of  forest  areas,  and  their  livelihoods  have  been  threatened.  The \nshort-term response was to introduce a moratorium on the issue of new land concessions until \nMay  2008.  A  longer-term  solution  is  needed  to  rationalize  this  potentially  valuable  source  of \ninvestment, and manage it to minimize negative externalities. \n \nAnother  part  of  the  rationale  for  government  involvement  is  that  rural  infrastructure  is \n3. \nlargely a public good (benefits are largely non-excludable and non-subtractable).2 Infrastructure \ninvestments  tend  to  require  large  capital  resources,  which  preclude  private  investment,  since \nthe  means  for  recovering  rents  or  user  charges  are  not  well  developed  in  the  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR),  in  spite  of  some  unachieved  policies  regarding  irrigation \nmanagement and transfer.3 With the exception of irrigation facilities and water supplies, where \ntarget  beneficiaries  can  be  clearly  identified,  benefits  from  investment  are  distributed  over  a \nlarge  and  unidentifiable  number  of  users.  This  reinforces  the  public  nature  of  the  investment. \nSimilarly,  the  proposed  support  to  producer  associations  and  farmer  groups  is  not  likely  to  be \ncarried out by the private sector. \n \n4.  \nADB\u2019s  comparative  advantage  as  a  participant  in  the  Project  arises  from  three  main \nsources.  Firstly,  previous  long-term  agriculture  and  natural  resources  and  multi-sector \nexperience  (both  policy  and  project-based)  is  unmatched  by  any  other  donor  in  the  Lao  PDR. \nThis  has  contributed  to  robust  project  design  and  will  continue  to  underlie  and  inform  project \nimplementation, especially as a mixture of policy and technical support is envisaged. A history \nof  long-term  cooperation  with  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry  (MAF)  (particularly  the \nDepartment of Planning) will provide a solid foundation for long-term implementation.  \n \n                                                 \n1   Economics Research Division. 2004.

Manila:  ADB. \n2   Subtractability refers to the degree to which one person\u2019s use of a resource diminishes others\u2019 use. \n3   For  example  the  failure  to  achieve  the  stated  policy  of  full  irrigation  management  and  transfer  while  maintaining \n\nefficient operations of the irrigation scheme. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n57\n\nSecondly, ADB value added in the proposed investment is enhanced by its ability to both \n5.  \nleverage International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) funding and integrate with the \nongoing  work  of  other  donors.  The  World  Bank,  Agence  Francaise  Developpement,  and \nEuropean Community are investigating major funding for initiatives in the north of the Lao PDR. \nTherefore, it makes sense in terms of donor harmonization for more attention to be paid\u2014in the \nform  of  a  number  of  subproject  investments\u2014to  the  relatively  neglected  southern  provinces \n(several of which are particularly remote in geographic and administrative/historical terms). \n \nThirdly,  the  Project\u2019s  location  and  its  constituent  activities  exploit  linkages  with  existing \n6.  \nADB-supported subregional initiatives. Insofar as they relate to the proposed Project, the three \nmain  subregional  features  are  (i)  the  East\u2013West  Economic  Corridor,  which  runs  across \nSavannakhet  and  whose  facilities  subprojects  will  be  able  to  exploit;  (ii)  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion  (GMS)  Core  Agriculture  Support  Program,  several  of  whose  key  strategic  thrusts \ndirectly support objectives and activities of the proposed Project (e.g., facilitation of cross-border \ntrade  and  investment  in  agriculture,  policy  support  for  cross-border  contract  farming);  and \n(iii) the  GMS  Core  Environment  Program  and  Biodiversity  Conservation  Corridors  Initiative, 4 \nwhere both skills and experiences of GMS countries will be solicited in project implementation \n(e.g., for land use planning and geographic information system training). \n \nC. \n\nGoals of the Plan \n\n7. \nThe Government\u2019s guiding document is the Sixth National Socio Economic Development \nPlan (2006\u20132010).5 MAF has translated its content into specific targets and objectives through \nits  own  strategic  document,  which  outlines  four  overall  objectives  to  be  achieved  through  the \nimplementation of 13 measures. The four strategic objectives are (i) increased food production \nand security\u2014annual food production equivalent of 3.3 million tons of rice, increasing national \naverage consumption to 350 kilograms per head per year (including poor districts), together with \nother targets for protein; (ii) increased production of materials for agro-processing\u2014directed at \ndomestic processing to allow agriculture and forestry exports to increase to 30% of the value of \nexports ($1 billion by 2010); (iii) stabilization of shifting cultivation\u2014the main strategy of poverty \nreduction  in  the  47  poorest  districts  while  providing  for  environmental  protection;  and  (iv) \nsustainable forest management\u2014to increase forest cover from 42% to 53% (12 million hectares \nby 2010) with commercial plantations. The 13 measures have been developed to give effect to \nthese  overall  objectives with  the  use  of  government  budget  and  donor  support,  and  are  being \nfunded in part by donor and budget funds. One of the main items identified in the 13 measures \nis the need to improve market access through rehabilitation of rural infrastructure. \n \nD. \n\nAssociated Economic Policies \n\n9. \nTwo recent policy initiatives likely to affect the agriculture and natural resources sector, \nother  than  the  sector  development  policy  itself,  are  (i)  the  policy  on  decentralization\u2014for  the \nmanagement of land resources and technical support services, and (ii) the policy for maintaining \nirrigation infrastructure. As for the first, the Government has attached significant importance to \nthe ability of kumbans (village clusters) and districts to identify investments. However, to date, \nthe  funds  for  such  investments  are  essentially  limited  to  initiatives  funded  by  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources. Items identified at this level tend to be smaller-scale public investments of \nimmediate  relevance  to  the  concerned  communities.  They  tend  not  to  have  the  broader \n                                                 \n4  ADB.  2005.

This  has  created  an \nopportunity  for  coordination  with  these  smaller  scale  investments  to  increase  their  impact. \nLinking  a  number  of  village  or  kumban  roads  with  a  district  road  has  the  potential  for  a  far \ngreater impact than the road alignment in its own right. \n \n10. \nThe  second  policy  is  related  to  irrigation  management  and  transfer.  The  Government \nwishes  to  recover  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  from  the  immediate  beneficiaries. \nWater users associations have been charged with responsibility for setting water service fees to \nrecover  O&M  costs.  For  the  larger  schemes,  the  pricing  policy  does  not  provide  for  full  cost \nrecovery.  In  many  cases,  recovered  user  charges  are  insufficient  to  meet  immediate  O&M \nneeds and a significant public need remains to maintain the operations of pumping equipment \nthat rely on expensive electricity. Local authorities cannot afford to finance comprehensive O&M \nas  provincial  budgetary  allocations  are  limited  and  assets  inevitably  deteriorate.  With  limited \nresources  available  in  districts  and  provinces  to  maintain  O&M  support  of  irrigation  facilities, \nparticularly for more expensive periodic maintenance, facilities are seldom maintained in sound \nworking order. The Project has addressed this issue by supporting further development of O&M \npolicy by providing technical and policy specialists under the Project. \n \nE. \n\nGovernment and Local Consultant Capacity \n\n11. \nThe Government has demonstrated capacity to implement ADB-funded sector modality \nprojects  such  as  the  Community  Managed  Irrigation  Sector  Project,  the  Northern  Community \nManaged  Sector  Project,  and  the  Decentralized  Irrigation  Sector  Management  Project,  two  of \nwhich  are  due  to  be  completed  in  2009. 6  The  Government  has  demonstrated  capacity  to \nidentify, prioritize, and prepare detailed designs for the implementation of these sector modality \nprojects.  The  ADB-funded  Decentralized  Irrigation  Sector  Management  Project  is  being \nimplemented through provincial project management units, where there was significant capacity \nbuilding  in  the  identification,  design,  works  supervision,  and  project  management  in  general. \nWhile a recent review mission assessed that more capacity building was needed in safeguards \nand  economic  evaluation,  the  project  has  demonstrated  that  capacity  to  implement  the \nproposed Project has been established.  \n \nF. \n\nFiscal Impacts \n\n12. \nThe majority of the subprojects will comprise a mix of rural infrastructure, together with \n\u201csoft\u201d  initiatives  for  farmer  group  support  or  technical  extension  services.  Most  of  the  rural \ninfrastructure  rehabilitated  under  the  Project  will  be  of  sufficient  size  that  it  is  unlikely  that \ncommunities  will  assume  responsibility  for  its  maintenance.  In  the  case  of  irrigation \nrehabilitation, the Government is committed to charging water user charges to provide for O&M \nrequirements. Where it is possible to identify and charge local beneficiaries for contributions to \nO&M, the immediate beneficiaries will be able to contribute to routine maintenance. For roads \nand other public infrastructure, the funding of periodic and routine maintenance will become the \nresponsibility  of  the  provinces.  This  places  a  significant  demand  on  provincial  and  district \nresources.  While  the  revenue-raising  capacity  of  rural-based  provinces  is  limited,  the  issue  of \nis  very  much  dependent  on  central  government  budgetary  allocations. \nsustainability \n\n                                                 \n6   ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loans to the Lao \nPeople\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  for  the  Community  Managed  Irrigation  Sector  Project,  the  Northern  Community \nManaged Sector Project, and the Decentralized Irrigation Sector Management Project. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n59\n\nSustainability  is  only  partly  a  financial  management  issue;  it  is  more  an  issue  of  limited \nresources. \n \n13. \nA review of the financial positions of the five target provinces shows significant growth in \nthe  level  of  financial  activity,  sources  of  funding,  and  allocation  of  these  funds  to  both  capital \nand  recurrent  expenditure.  In  the  12  months  ended  September  2007,  annual  budget  receipts \nper capita (from all sources) in the target provinces varied considerably. The highest was almost \nexclusively comprised of transfers from the central Government. Provinces maintain their focus \non funding capital investment, accounting for about 20% of provincial expenditure on average. \nThe heavy dependence on the central government for budget resources averages over 80% for \ntarget  provinces.  It  is  lower  in  Champassak,  where  there  is  a  rapidly  developing  trading \neconomy  with  neighboring  countries.  In  Attapeu,  economic  development  opportunities  are \nlimited and there is greater dependence on the central Government. The provincial allocation of \nmaintenance budgets continues to be a challenge for resource-poor provinces. Furthermore, as \ntheir  economies  develop,  greater  allocations  will  be  needed  for  recurrent  expenditure  on \nmaintenance rather than keeping their focus on new infrastructure investment. \n \n14. \nADB  funds  are  not  fully  fungible  as  the  two  financing  sources\u2014ADB  and  IFAD\u2014have \nbeen specified in the design for subprojects. The allocation of counterpart funds has not been \nproposed in view of the limitations described. \n \nG. \n\nEconomic Risks \n\n15. \nThe  major  economic  risk  to  the  successful  outcome  of  the  Project  is  the  need  for \nperiodic and routine maintenance to sustain benefits. The economic analysis in Supplementary \nAppendix L draws attention to the sensitivity of the economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) for \nthe  representative  subprojects  to  maintenance  for  road  subprojects  in  particular.  If  the  benefit \nstream stops 5 years after rehabilitation, the estimated EIRR becomes negative; if this happens \nafter  10  years,  the  EIRR  falls  below  the  cost  of  capital.  Sensitivity  analysis  of  the  Kaenghet \nRoad  Rehabilitation  Subproject  suggests  that  the  EIRR  will  be  about  13.3%  if  maintenance \nstops after 5 years, and 20.7% if maintenance stops after 10 years. The situation is similar for \nthe  Hatxaysoung  Irrigation  Rehabilitation  Subproject,  with  an  EIRR  of  14.6%  if  maintenance \nstops after 5 years and an EIRR of 18.5% if it ceases after 10 years. \n \n16. \nThe  importance  of  attending  to  maintenance  of  rehabilitated  rural  infrastructure  cannot \nbe  overstated,  as  it  has  such  a  dramatic  impact  on  the  benefits  achieved.  The  economic  risk \nidentified is partly related to policy\u2014tariffs do not reflect the real operational cost of rehabilitated \ninfrastructure\u2014but  is  equally  a  function  of  limited  resources  to  maintain  structures.  The \nsubproject  identification  process  will  partly  ensure  that  resources  are  allocated  to  the \nrehabilitated  infrastructure,  but  there  will  be  a  period  of  time  between  the  commitment  to  a \nmaintenance  program  and  the  commitment  of  budgetary  resources  during  which  such \nundertakings  could  be  forgotten.  It  is  therefore  important  to  formalize  commitments  for \nmaintenance  by  the  provinces  and  set  minimum  financing  quantities  for  specific  items  of \ninfrastructure where possible. \n \nH. \n\nGovernment Commitment \n\n17. \nThe commitment of both central and provincial government was strong during the ADB-\nfunded preparation of the Project.7 This was manifest, among other things, by the presence of \n\n                                                 \n7   ADB. 2006.

The province administrations see \nconsiderable  merit  in  the  scope  and  objectives  of  the  Project,  as  it  has  been  developed  in  a \nparticipatory  manner  with  numerous  workshops  and \nis \nappreciated is the expectation that there will be greater management over what is currently out \nof hand\u2014FDI and its consequences for land resources management. Government commitment \nis  clear,  as  it  has  welcomed  the  overall  objectives  and  it  will  build  local  capacities  where  the \ndecision making is taken. The provision of substantial funds will allow the provinces to prioritize \ntheir development investments in a participatory manner that has not been available to them in \nthe past. \n \nI. \n\nindividual  consultations.  What \n\nCoordination of Foreign Aid \n\nThere  are  a  number  of  international  agencies  and  bilateral  donors  working  in  rural \n18. \ndevelopment  (Appendix  4)  as  well  as  limited  state-funded  initiatives.  The  Government  has \npromoted  a  broad-based,  sector-wide  approach  to  coordinate  rural  development  for  improving \nthe impact from donor support, improving communication between donors, and adopting a more \nunified approach under the Government\u2019s guidance. The formation of the upland working group \nin the north of the country appears to be an effective means for coordinating donor support. The \nADB and IFAD-funded project has worked closely with this group during project preparation, as \na  number  of  policy-related  topics  are  common  to  both  areas,  particularly  in  respect  of  land \ntenure, concessions, and preserving the rights of traditional land users to the forest resource. \n \nJ. \n\nConditions Attached to the Loan \n\n19.  Most  conditions  for  the  Project  relate  to  subproject  identification  and  have  been \nincorporated  in  the  selection  criteria.  The  Project  is  intended  to  have  national  impact  through \npolicy  development  in  respect  of  land  tenure,  issuance  of  land  concessions,  incorporation  of \nsafeguards, and more rigor in investment appraisal. It will also influence the protection of user \nrights on traditional upland farming areas. In addition, it will develop awareness of the need for \nsafeguards  (through \ntechnical  assistance)  when \nconsidering  proposed  investments.  The  criteria  for  subprojects  will  ensure  that  these  aspects \nare considered in the selection process (Appendix 5 and Supplementary Appendix C) and are \nconfirmed in the loan conditions. \n \nK. \n\nEconomic Analysis of Representative Subprojects \n\nthe  associated  capacity  development \n\n20. \nTwo representative subprojects were analyzed to determine their suitability for funding. \nEach subproject demonstrated EIRRs in excess of 12%, ranging from 19.3% to 23.5% based on \nthe identified net benefit flows. In each case, additional benefits from the investment could not \nbe readily quantified and estimates were considered conservative. Sensitivity tests were carried \nout  to  the  main  potential  variables  that  might  affect  the  findings,  including  price  declines, \nincreases  in  capital  costs,  and  a  reduction  in  utilization.  Sensitivity  to  routine  and  periodic \nmaintenance  was  also  analyzed,  with  utilization  declining  to  pre-rehabilitation  levels  after  the \nmaintenance ceased. In most cases, the benefits were not sensitive to changes in price levels \nor  to  increases  in  unit  investment  costs.  The  area  of  greatest  sensitivity  was  identified  from \nmaintenance  practices.  Where  the  maintenance  ceased  after  5  years  of  operation,  the  EIRRs \nfell  dramatically  below  the  cost  of  capital.  In  cases  where  the  maintenance  ceased  10  years \nafter  completion,  the  EIRRs  were  significantly  reduced  but  not  below  zero,  as  most  of  the \nbenefits  would  have  been  received  before  deterioration  of  the  infrastructure.  The  economic \nbenefit from subproject investments will, because of the selection criteria used, be higher than \nthe  opportunity  cost  of  capital  and  constitute  sound  economic  investments  without  negative \nsocial and environmental impacts. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 26 January 2009) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "kip (KN) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "KN1.00\n$1.00\n", "$0.0001178689 \nKN8,484 \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", "ADB \nANR \nASEAN \nCDTA \nCQS \nDOP \nEA \nEAF \nEGDP \nEIRR \nFDI \nFIPD \nGIS \nGMS \nIEE \nIFAD \nLao PDR \nLWU \nMAF \nMOF \nNAFRI \nNCB \nNLMA \nNPSC \nO&M \nPAFO \nPCC \nPCO \nPPMS \nPPO \nQCBS \nTA \nWREA \nWUA \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \nAsian Development Bank \nagriculture and natural resources \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations \ncapacity development technical assistance \nconsultant\u2019s qualification selection \nDepartment of Planning (Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry) \nexecuting agency \nenvironmental assessment framework \nethnic group development plan \neconomic internal rate of return \nforeign direct investment \nForest Inventory and Planning Division \ngeographic information system \nGreater Mekong Subregion \ninitial environmental examination \nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \nLao Women\u2019s Union \nMinistry of Agriculture and Forestry \nMinistry of Finance \nNational Agriculture and Forestry Research Institute \nnational competitive bidding \nNational Land Management Authority \nnational project steering committee \noperation and maintenance \nprovincial agriculture and forestry office \nprovincial coordination committee \nproject coordination office \nproject performance monitoring system \nprovincial project office \nquality- and cost-based selection \ntechnical assistance \nWater Resources and Environmental Administration \nwater users association \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \nand its agencies ends on September 30.
