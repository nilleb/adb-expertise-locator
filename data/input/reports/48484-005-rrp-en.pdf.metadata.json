The additional financing is consistent with the project rationale; will extend \nsocioeconomic  benefits  to  the  outer  island  of  Nui;  and  is  included  in  the  country  operations \nbusiness plan, 2020\u20132022 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the 11 small Pacific island \ncountries.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nRegional context. Tuvalu is categorized as a fragile and conflict-affected situation and is \n3. \none  of  the  smallest  and  most  remote  ADB  member  countries.  The  country  is  home  to  11,646 \npeople.  Tuvalu  is  more  than  1,100  kilometers  from  Fiji  and  more  than  3,000  kilometers  from \nAustralia or New Zealand. About 60% of the population is based in Funafuti (the capital), with the \nremaining people spread among eight outer islands. Given its archipelagic nature, the country\u2019s \neconomy and people primarily rely on maritime transport to access goods and essential social \nservices. The outer islands, from north to south, are Nanumea, Niutao, Nanumaga, Nui, Vaitupu, \nNukufetau, Nukulaelae, and Nuilakita. \n \n4. \nNeed  for  harbors  in  the  outer  islands.  The  government  runs  a  shipping  service  to \nfacilitate the movement of people and cargo between the islands. However, no outer island has \na harbor for the government ships, and small workboats need to ferry people and cargo between \nthe ship and the shore. This is dangerous when the sea is rough, and workboats need to pass \nthrough channels that can be too shallow during low tide. Except for Nanumea, Nukufetau, and \nVaitupu, no other outer island has a harbor for the workboats. Serious accidents have occurred \nduring passenger transfers and navigation through channels, resulting in fatalities and economic \nlosses. \n \n5. \nCOVID-19. Tuvalu has no confirmed case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) due to an \nearly  response  and  national  lockdown,  pandemic  but  Tuvalu\u2019s  remoteness  and  limited  natural \nresources expose the country to global economic and health disruptions. Despite the economic \nimpacts of COVID-19, basic infrastructure needs of the country in terms of domestic connectivity \nremain to be addressed. In addition, the country will require additional investments to consolidate \nthe post-COVID-19 economic recovery. \n \n6. \nOriginal  project.  On  16  November  2016,  ADB  approved  a  grant  for  $11.8  million  to \nfinance  the  Outer  Island  Maritime  Infrastructure  Project  (the  original  project),  which  is \n\n1  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2016.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors: \nProposed Grants and Administration of Grant to Tuvalu for the Outer Island Maritime Infrastructure Project. Manila. \n\n2  ADB. 2019. Country Operations Business Plan: 11 Small Pacific Island Countries, 2020\u20132022. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f(i) constructing a workboat harbor in Nukulaelae and rehabilitating boat ramps at Nanumaga and \nNiutao, (ii) improving the capacity to operate and maintain harbors, and (iii) creating a transport \nsector  master  plan  for  future  harbor  development  in  the  outer  islands  (footnote  1).  Previously, \nADB provided a project design advance grant for the detailed engineering design, procurement \nassistance,  and  project  management.3 The  project  progressed  satisfactorily  but  incurred  cost \noverruns  because of  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  fluctuation  and  contract  variations for the \nworks contract under the project. In parallel, the government requested ADB continued scaling \nup of the project outputs and construction of additional workboat harbors. \n \n7. \nFirst additional financing. The government requested ADB and the World Bank to assist \nin  the  construction  of  further  workboat  harbors  in  additional  outer  islands  of  Tuvalu. \nOn 13 September 2018, ADB approved additional financing to the original project for $15.4 million \nto cover cost overruns of the original project and scale up the project outputs with the construction \nof  a  workboat  harbor  in  Niutao.4 The  World  Bank  provided  parallel  cofinancing  assistance  to \nconstruct  a  workboat  harbor  in  Nanumaga  under  the  Maritime  Investment  in  Climate-Resilient \nOperations Project.5 \n \n8. \nSummary of Project Performance. The ongoing project is performing well with contract \nawards  of  $16.5  million  (56.5  %  of  total  project  amount)  and  disbursements  of  $12.4  million \n(42.5% of total project amount) as of 7 October 2020. The ongoing project is complying with the \nfinancial management covenants and safeguard policy requirements. Project implementation is \non  track  to  deliver  all  expected  outputs.6 Output  1  included  the  construction  of  a  small-scale \nharbor  in  Nukulaelae  and  Niutao  and  rehabilitation  of  boat  ramps  in  Nanumaga  and  Niutao. \nDespite the construction delays caused by the country\u2019s remoteness and an environment highly \nexposed to weather and natural hazards, progress on the civil works under the original project \nreached 80% in July 2020 with expected completion by the end of 2020. The civil works contract \nunder the first additional financing was awarded in October 2020. \n \nThe remaining two outputs of the project have been completed satisfactorily. For output 2, \n9. \nan  operation  and  maintenance  plan  for  the  maritime  infrastructure  has  been  prepared,  and \ntraining for outer island communities will be delivered after the completion of the small workboat \nharbor in Nukulaelae. For output 3, a transport sector master plan for future harbor development \nin the outer islands has been prepared and delivered. \n \n10. \nProject risks are being successfully managed. The ongoing project incorporated actions \nto mitigate risks,  which  the  government  is  implementing  satisfactorily,  such  as maintaining  the \nestablished project management unit (PMU) to support procurement, financial management, and \nconstruction  supervision,  and  incorporating  climate  change  adaptation  and  disaster  reduction \nmeasures into the design. \n \nThe second additional financing is justified, given that the overall project (original project, \n11. \nfirst additional financing, and proposed second additional financing) is (i) technically feasible, cost-\neffective,  and  financially  sound;  (ii)  consistent  with  the  project\u2019s  impact  of  safe  and  efficient \n\n \n\n3  ADB. 2016.

Manila. \n\n5  World Bank. 2018. Maritime Investment in Climate Resilient Operations Project. Washington, DC. \n6   The boat ramps in Nanumaga and Niutao to be rehabilitated with ADB assistance are in different locations to the \nworkboat harbor in Nanumaga to be constructed with the World Bank assistance and the workboat harbor in Niutao \nto be constructed with ADB assistance. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fmaritime  infrastructure  in  the  outer  islands;  (iii)  a  high  priority  of  the  government;  and \n(iv) consistent with the country operations business plan. \n \n12. \nSecond  additional  financing.  The  government  has  requested  from  ADB  a  second \nadditional  financing  to  continue  scaling  up  output  1  of  the  ongoing  project  by  constructing  a \nworkboat harbor in the remaining island of Nui, with a population of 610 people (2017). This is \nhighly relevant as, with ADB and World Bank assistance, all of Tuvalu\u2019s outer islands except for \nNuilakita (with a population of about 30 people) will have a workboat harbor. \n \n13. \nFeasibility of second additional financing. The second additional financing is feasible \ngiven that (i) the project management capacity of the government is strengthened with the PMU \nestablished under the project design advance facility, which continues to operate for the ongoing \nproject  (footnote  3);  (ii)  the  government  has  demonstrated  sufficient  financial  management \ncapacity  with  financial  statements  duly  submitted  and  approved;  and  (iii)  the  institutional \nstrengthening plan ensures the asset sustainability. These measures contribute to the feasibility \nof the project and will allow its timely implementation and sustainability. \n \n14. \nSuitability  of  second  additional  financing.  The  proposed  project  is  suitable  for \nadditional financing since the impact remains unchanged. It (i) scales up the original outputs and \noutcome, extending them to an additional island; (ii) builds upon the due diligence of the ongoing \nproject, with similar environmental and social safeguards impacts; and (iii) brings efficiency gains \nusing the same PMU and implementation arrangements. \n \n15. \nAlignment with strategic priorities. The National Strategy for Sustainable Development, \n2016\u20132020 (Te Kakeega III) sets out the government\u2019s vision to make maritime transport more \nefficient  and  safe.7 Te  Kakeega  III  identifies  that  the  outer  islands  that  are  in  most  need  of \nworkboat  harbors  are  Niutao,  Nanumaga,  Nui,  and  Nukulaelae.  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  expands \nthe focus on small island developing states to strengthen connectivity, access, and institutional \ncapacity  while  tackling  climate  change  impacts  and  disaster  risks. 8  The  second  additional \nfinancing is aligned with the strategic priorities of (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing \ninequalities; (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality; (iii) building resilience to disasters and \nclimate change; (iv) promoting rural development via improving connectivity and accessibility of \nisolated populations; and (v) strengthening governance and institutional capacity.  \n \nB. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  overall  project  remains  unchanged  and  will  be  to  secure  safe  and \n16. \nefficient maritime infrastructure in the outer islands, with climate change resilience incorporated \nin  infrastructure  design,  protocols,  and  operation.  The  original  outcome  of  improving  maritime \ntransfer operations in Nanumaga, Niutao, and Nukulaelae, anchored on a transport sector master \nplan, with a view to promoting fisheries and tourism, will be extended to the outer island of Nui.9 \n \n17. \nOutput  1  of  the  overall  project  will  be  scaled  up  to  include  the  construction  of  a  small \nworkboat  harbor  in  Nui  to  higher  standards  of climate  and  disaster resilience.  The small-scale \nharbor  in  Nui  will  include  a  wharf,  a  navigation  channel,  a  boat  ramp,  a  passenger  terminal \n(including a canteen), a transit shed, shoreline reclamation and a crane truck. These facilities will \n\nProject Description \n\n \n\n7  Government of Tuvalu. 2016. Te Kakeega III: National Strategy for Sustainable Development, 2016\u20132020. Funafuti. \n8  ADB.  2018.

Outputs  2  and  3  of  the  ongoing \nproject remain unchanged, with a minor change in the name of the line ministry, which is changed \nfrom Ministry of Communications and Transport to Ministry of Transport, Energy and Tourism. \n \nDisaster  risk  context.  Nui  faces  significant  risk  of  disasters,  including  severe  tropical \n18. \ncyclones,  which  occur frequently  within  the  project  area.  The  impacts  of extreme  weather  and \nsea-level  rise  are  projected  to  increase  in  the  coming  decades  because  of  climate  change. \nMaritime infrastructure plays an essential role in supporting outer island resilience by ensuring \nthe  delivery  of  critical  relief  following  disasters.  However,  the  existing  infrastructure  is  highly \nvulnerable to disaster impacts. The project will address disaster and climate risk by enhancing \nthe resilience of port infrastructure and improving its functionality during extreme weather events. \n \nCOVID-19 in project implementation. COVID-19 has imposed challenges on the project \n19. \ndesign, preparation, and implementation. To address the COVID-19 situation, specific provisions \nin the environmental assessment and environmental management plan (EMP) will be included in \nthe bidding documents and contracts for works under the project, requiring that the contractors \nimplement  additional  health  and  safety  measures  and  a  training  program  for  prevention  of \ncommunicable diseases including COVID-19 in coordination with the local health authorities. In \naddition, procurement will be done electronically so bidders do not need to travel to the country.  \n \nC. \n \n20. \nADB has extensive experience in addressing the needs of, and reducing the challenges \nfaced by, Pacific developing member countries in the maritime transport sector, with ongoing and \npast support provided to improve maritime infrastructure and services in Fiji, Papua New Guinea, \nSamoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu. This project will benefit from the lessons in these projects, such as \nthe  need to  allocate  sufficient  contingencies  given  the  nature of  civil  works  in  complex marine \nenvironments, ensure a high level of readiness, and ensure the appropriate scheduling of civil \nworks to avoid cyclone seasons. \n \n21. \nADB  has  also  gained  valuable  experience  during  the  implementation  of  the  ongoing \nproject. Lessons in project management and procurement will be applied for the implementation \nof the second additional financing, such as the need to mitigate against delays in mobilization with \nthe provision of advanced payment upon mobilization to site; the convenience of using electronic \nprocurement; and the need to achieve early involvement of the contractor to improve the design, \nfacilitate construction, and increase market interest. \n \nD. \n \n22. \nThe second additional financing is estimated to cost $22.2 million and the overall project \n(original  project,  first  additional  financing,  and  the  proposed  second  additional  financing)  is \nestimated to cost $52.4 million (Table 1). \n \n \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nCurrent \nAmounta \n\nAdditional \nFinancingb \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \nB. \n \na  Refers to the original financing and first additional financing.

Climate  change  adaptation  activities  include \ncoastal protection measures and allowances in the maritime structures and foundations  for the \nfuture rise of sea levels in the harbor. Raising the harbor levels to accommodate high sea-level \nrise projections would reduce the harbor\u2019s usability as the wharf will be too high for the transfer of \npeople  and  goods  according  to  the  current  tidal conditions.  The cost  of disaster risk  reduction \nmeasures to enhance the disaster resilience of the harbor is $2.0 million and includes land-side \n\n9.8 \n100.0 \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fImplementation Arrangements \n\ninfrastructure  improvements  and  coastal  protection  measures  to  withstand  the  impacts  of \ndisasters, mainly cyclones.10 \n \n25. \nDetailed  cost  estimates  by  expenditure  category  and  by  financier  are  included  in  the \nproject  administration  manual  (PAM). 11  The  civil  works  for  the  harbor  represent  the  major \nexpenditure under the project. \n \nE. \n \n26. \nProject  management  arrangements.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the \nexecuting  agency  and  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works,  Infrastructure,  Environment,  Labor, \nMeteorology  and  Disaster  (MPWIELMD)  will  be  the  implementing  agency  for  the  second \nadditional  financing.  At  the  request  of  the  government,  the  Ministry  of  Communications  and \nTransport, acting as the executing agency and implementing agency for the ongoing project, will \nbe replaced by the MOF as the executing agency and by the MPWIELMD as the implementing \nagency. The National Infrastructure Steering Committee, jointly chaired by the  ministers of the \nMOF  and  MPWIELMD,  will  provide  oversight  to  the  overall  project.  The  established  PMU  will \ncontinue supporting the government and will be transferred to the MPWIELMD. \n \n27. \nConsulting services and procurement. Procurement and recruitment of all consultants \nwill follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time), the Procurement \nRegulations  for  ADB  Borrowers  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  associated  staff \ninstructions.  Retroactive  financing  and  advance  contracting  will  be  used  to  accelerate  the \nrecruitment  of  consultants.  The  government  has  been  advised  that  approval  of  advance \ncontracting does not commit ADB to finance the project. \n \n28. \nThe  project  will  achieve  the  best  value  for  money  through  optimal  procurement \narrangements  by (i)  using  e-procurement  to  lower  the  transaction  cost  and  enhance  efficiency \nand transparency, (ii) attracting international contracting firms to deliver high-quality civil works \nunder  a  single  package  ($14  million)  following  open  competitive  bidding  with  international \nadvertisement, and (iii) recruiting an international consulting firm using quality- and cost-based \nselection to ensure high-quality construction supervision services. \n \n29. \nThe government requested ADB\u2019s procurement implementation support for recruitment of \nconsultants for the  project.  A  delegation  matrix  outlining  the  responsibilities  of the  government \nand ADB for consultant selection has been signed by the MOF, MPWIELMD, and ADB. ADB will \nsupport the recruitment process, including the advertisement, tender, and evaluation stages. The \ngovernment will remain responsible for selecting, negotiating, and signing the consulting contracts. \n \n30. \nthe PAM (footnote 11). \n \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n\nDecember 2020\u2013December 2025 \n31 December 2025 \n30 June 2026 \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nEstimated grant closing date \nManagement \n\n \n\n10 Details are in the Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fAspects \n\n(i)  Oversight body \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing \n\nagencies \n\n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nAdvance contracting \n\nRetroactive financing \n\nDisbursement \n\nArrangements \nNational Infrastructure Steering Committee \nMOF and MPWIELMD (co-chairs) \nMinistry of Transport, Energy and Tourism; Ministry of Local \nGovernment; Department of Public Works; Department of Marine \nServices; Department of Environment (members) \nMOF \nMPWIELMD \n\n1 contract \n\n$14,000,000 \n\n3 contracts \n2 contracts \n\n$500,000 \n$2,250,000 \n\nProject management unit, 3 staff \nOpen competitive bidding \n(internationally advertised) \nDirect contracting \nQuality- and cost-based \nselection \nMain civil works and construction supervision consulting services \npackages \nConsulting services packages for project management of ship \nreplacement.

The project \nfollows  a  similar  and  consistent  approach  to  the  original  project  and  is  technically  feasible. \nAll facilities are designed following Australian and New Zealand technical standards with a design \nlife of 50 years. Climate change and potential disaster risk impacts, such as a predicted sea-level \nrise,  an  increase  in  wave  height,  and  an  increase  in  the  intensity  and  frequency  of  tropical \ncyclones and other risks from extreme weather events, have been analyzed under the climate \nrisk vulnerability assessment and are reflected in the preliminary and detailed design to address \nthe  climate  change  and  disaster  risks.  The  adaptation  and  disaster  risk  reduction  measures \nrecommended for incorporation in the designs concern the marine structures, boat ramp, channel, \nand onshore facilities. The facilities also include features to minimize and/or reduce erosion and \nsiltation. Concrete structures do not require significant maintenance. \n \nB. \n \n32. \nThe project will provide faster and safer navigation for passengers and cargo to Nui island, \nallowing for time savings by passengers and savings in vessel waiting times with reduced cargo \ntransfer times. The savings are valued at $181,000 annually. In addition to these direct benefits, \nthere are several unquantified benefits, such as improved safety of passengers while travelling \nthrough the channel and at embarkation and disembarkation points, reduced damage to cargo, \nand overall saving in the time the ship takes to go around, thus benefiting all outer islands and \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nSustainability \n\nproviding  the  people  with  positive  benefits  associated  with  improved  access.  The  assessment \ndetermined that the proposed boat harbor at Nui is the least-cost option in reducing travel times \nand vessel operating costs. \n \nC. \n \n33. \nADB assessed the government\u2019s capacity to sustain project outputs and shipping services \nas adequate. This is not a revenue-generating project, and passenger and cargo revenues will \nnot cover the maintenance of the shipping service, including the project facilities. However, the \ngovernment  has  been  satisfactorily maintaining the  ships,  which  to  date have  operated  safely. \nThe major  incremental  maintenance  cost  associated  with  the  project  will  be  maintenance \ndredging of a new channel after every major tropical cyclone, which have been occurring about \nevery 10 years. The analysis showed that the government has sufficient revenues and budgetary \nallocations  for  such  major  maintenance  activity,  estimated  at  A$100,000  per  year,  and  other \nmaintenance requirements. \n \nThe  government  created  the  Deferred  Maintenance  Fund  in  2015  to  transfer  funds \n34. \nannually  to  the  Tuvalu  Development  Fund  for  long-term  maintenance  of  government  assets, \nguided  by  an  approved maintenance  policy.  The  deferred maintenance fund  is  an  expenditure \nitem used by a ministry to request budget allocation for repair and maintenance. Coupled with \nplanned institutional strengthening activities and the training in basic and routine maintenance for \nthe outer island communities after the completion of the harbors, the second additional financing \nis financially sustainable. \n \nD. \n \n35. \nFinancial management. A financial management assessment following ADB\u2019s financial \nmanagement  guidelines  was  conducted  for  the  MOF  as  the  executing  agency  and  the \nMPWIELMD as the implementing agency of the project. The financial management capacity of \nthe MOF and MPWIELMD were considered adequate. The MOF is also the executing agency of \ntwo other ADB-funded ongoing projects that are performing well, and the PMU for the ongoing \nproject,  established  in  2015,  will  be  transferred to  the MPWIELMD.  The overall  assessed  pre-\nmitigation financial management risk is moderate with weakness highlighted under the internal \naudit function that needs to be extended to other government offices. \n \n36. \nProcurement risk assessment. ADB completed a project procurement risk assessment \nfor  the  executing  agency  and  implementing  agency  proposed  for  the  project.  Overall,  the \nprocurement risk is moderate. The government and ADB have learned several lessons from the \nprocurement  activities  undertaken  under  the  ongoing  project.  Procurement  risk  will  remain \nmoderate  only  with  continued  support  of  international  consultants.  ADB  staff  will  oversee \nprocurement activities under the project to ensure good governance. \n \n37. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  the  MOF,  and  the  MPWIELMD.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 11). \n \nE. \n \n38. \nPoverty and social. The improvement in maritime infrastructure and operations in Nui will \nenhance access to essential services and economic opportunities for this outer island community. \nThe workboat harbor will facilitate improved and safer access to interisland transport, including \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nsafer access for people with limited mobility, such as pregnant women, the elderly, young children, \nand  the  disabled,  as  well  as  increase  the  range  of  services  available  and  accessible  to  Nui \nresidents  because  of  the  upgraded  docking  capabilities.  The  project  will  create  jobs  during \nconstruction  and  the  contractor  will  be  required  to  employ  and  train  local  men  and  women. \nThe workboat harbor will improve access to basic services and emergency support during times \nof disasters triggered by natural hazards and climate events. \n \n39. \nGender  equality.  The  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming  and \nadditional  gender  measures  will  be  added  to  the  overall  project  gender  action  plan.  Proactive \ngender  measures  include  targets  for  women  working  in  construction  (in  both  technical  and \nnontechnical roles); support to women to work in nontraditional jobs; gender and gender-based \nviolence training and awareness raising for contractors and communities; ensuring infrastructure \nis safe and accessible for women and vulnerable groups; and income-generating opportunities \nfor women, e.g., areas for women to sell food and/or handicrafts in the terminal. \n \nF. \n \n40. \ncategories12 are as follows. \n \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  categorization  of  the  second  additional  financing  is \n41. \naligned  with  the  ongoing  project.  A  number  of  alternative  locations  for  the  harbor,  land-side \nfacilities,  and  reclamation  have  been  considered  and  the  proposed  option  provides  the  most \nsuitable  from  an  environmental  perspective  (coastal  processes,  i.e.,  littoral  drift,  sand \ntransportation, wave climate, and marine ecology) and social perspective (access, minimization \nof  land  requirements).  The  impacts  of  the  Nui  workboat  harbor  are  site-specific,  limited  to  the \nfootprint of the small-scale harbor (including extending and widening the existing channel) and \nassociated land-side facilities on Nui, and can be mitigated and managed to acceptable levels \nprovided  the  measures  identified  in  the  initial  environmental  examination  and  EMP  are \nimplemented and subsequently monitored and reported on. The Department of Environment has \nadequate capacity to monitor the project with the PMU\u2019s support. The PAM sets out the detailed \nprocedures for implementation in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and country \nsafeguards system, including developing the construction EMP based on the project EMP and \ndetailing  and  reflecting  the  contractor\u2019s  methodology  and  approach  to  the  main  construction \nelements, risk assessment, and mitigation measures.13 \n \nInvoluntary resettlement (category C). The construction of a small workboat harbor in \n42. \nNui will not result in involuntary land acquisition or physical or economic displacement. The Nui \nproject\u2019s main components will be located on reclaimed and foreshore land recognized as crown \nland within Tuvalu laws. An estimated 1.96 hectares will be leased for about 3 years for access \nroads and a construction-related area, and there will be impacts on privately owned trees within \nthese leased areas. Alternatives to the designs will be developed if the landowners do not provide \ntheir  consent  and  agree  to  compensation  for  affected  trees.  There  may  be  long-term  leases \narranged for some minor associated facilities, and the government may transfer leases for the \naccess  road  to  long-term  leases  if  the  landowners  consent.  A  due  diligence  report  has  been \nprepared and outlines the requirement for a third-party verifier to monitor the lease agreement \n\n \n\n12 ADB.

The  due  diligence  report  and  initial  environmental  examination  include  a  grievance \nredress  mechanism  for  the  Nui  project,  which  incorporates  local  processes  for  resolving \ngrievances regarding land matters. \n \nIndigenous peoples (category C). The additional financing project will not impact on any \n43. \ndistinct  and  vulnerable  group  of  indigenous  peoples  as  defined  under  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement. The majority (94%) of the population of Tuvalu (11,646) is Polynesian, with the island \natoll of Nui having a population of 610 (2017). Group identification is based on a person's island \nof origin and family circle, which is deemed according to one\u2019s kinship affiliations. There are three \nfamily circles in Nui. None are considered distinct and vulnerable indigenous peoples (as defined \nin ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement). Activities under the second additional financing project will \nbe implemented in a culturally appropriate and participatory manner. \n  \nG. \n \n44. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.14 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nRisks \nThe limited number of \ngovernment staff have \ninsufficient experience in \nimplementing large investment \nprojects. \nAll bids on the works contract \nare substantially higher than \nthe cost estimate. \n\nClimate risk screening shows a \nhigh climate change risk for the \nproject. \n\nProcurement capacity of the \nimplementing agency is \ninsufficient. \n\nLack of internal audit function \nduring project implementation \n\nThe outbreak of coronavirus \ndisease may delay project \nimplementation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nThe project management and construction supervision consultant and \nthe project management unit will continue assisting the government in \nimplementing the project, which, despite inherent difficulties (complex \nmarine works in remote locations), has been performing well. \n\nElectronic procurement will be used. The use of a drone to film the \nproject site will be used to provide better information and attract more \nbidders. Geotechnical information will reduce construction uncertainties \nand bidding prices. \nA climate risk vulnerability assessment has been undertaken, and \nclimate risks were factored into the preliminary design and also inform \nthe detailed design of the harbor and related facilities, construction \nstandards, and the harbor operation and maintenance arrangements. \nProcurement under the ongoing project has been successful, but the \nconstruction supervision consultant and the Asian Development Bank \nwill need to continue providing procurement support to the implementing \nagency. \nThe Internal Audit Department of the Ministry of Finance will provide \nsupport during project implementation. Department staff will also receive \ntraining on Asian Development Bank disbursements and financial \nmanagement. \nSuch risk is uncertain and outside the project\u2019s control. When possible, \nvideoconference meetings will be arranged to support project \nprocurement and implementation. \n\n \n45. \nThe  government  and  MOF  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall \nconform to all applicable ADB requirements, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n14 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, financial management, and disbursement, \nas described in detail in the PAM (footnote 11) and grant documents. \n \n46. \nwhich are set forth in the draft grant agreement. \n \n\nThe government and MOF have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n47. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the grant not exceeding \n$20,000,000 to Tuvalu from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund) for the \nsecond  additional  financing  of  the  Outer  Island  Maritime  Infrastructure  Project,  on  terms  and \nconditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n \n\nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n\n \n9 November 2020 \n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\fREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nSafe and efficient domestic maritime transportation that helps increase climate resilience of community infrastructurea \n\n \n\n12 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \nMaritime transfer \noperations in \nNanumaga, Nui, Niutao, \nand Nukulaelae \nimproved, anchored on \na transport master plan, \nwith a view to promoting \nfisheries and tourism \n\nOutputs \nOutput 1 \n1.
