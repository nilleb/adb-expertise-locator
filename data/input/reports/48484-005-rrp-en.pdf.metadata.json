THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto Tuvalu for the second additional financing of the Outer Island Maritime Infrastructure Project. \n \n2.  The ongoing project (original project and first additional financing) is helping Tuvalu \novercome domestic maritime connectivity constraints with the construction of small workboat \nharbors in the outer islands of Nukulaelae and Niutao, rehabilitation of boat ramps in Niutao and \nNanumaga, as well as strengthening the government\u2019s capacity in operation and maintenance of \nharbors, and developing a transport sector master plan.1 The second additional financing will \nscale up and extend the socioeconomic benefits of the ongoing project by constructing a small \nworkboat harbor in Nui. The additional financing is consistent with the project rationale; will extend \nsocioeconomic benefits to the outer island of Nui; and is included in the country operations \nbusiness plan, 2020\u20132022 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the 11 small Pacific island \ncountries.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Regional context. Tuvalu is categorized as a fragile and conflict-affected situation and is \none of the smallest and most remote ADB member countries. The country is home to 11,646 \npeople. Tuvalu is more than 1,100 kilometers from Fiji and more than 3,000 kilometers from \nAustralia or New Zealand. About 60% of the population is based in Funafuti (the capital), with the \nremaining people spread among eight outer islands. Given its archipelagic nature, the country\u2019s \neconomy and people primarily rely on maritime transport to access goods and essential social \nservices. The outer islands, from north to south, are Nanumea, Niutao, Nanumaga, Nui, Vaitupu, \nNukufetau, Nukulaelae, and Nuilakita. \n \n4.  Need for harbors in the outer islands. The government runs a shipping service to \nfacilitate the movement of people and cargo between the islands. However, no outer island has \na harbor for the government ships, and small workboats need to ferry people and cargo between \nthe ship and the shore. This is dangerous when the sea is rough, and workboats need to pass \nthrough channels that can be too shallow during low tide. Except for Nanumea, Nukufetau, and \nVaitupu, no other outer island has a harbor for the workboats. Serious accidents have occurred \nduring passenger transfers and navigation through channels, resulting in fatalities and economic \nlosses. \n \n5.  COVID-19. Tuvalu has no confirmed case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) due to an \nearly response and national lockdown, pandemic but Tuvalu\u2019s remoteness and limited natural \nresources expose the country to global economic and health disruptions. Despite the economic \nimpacts of COVID-19, basic infrastructure needs of the country in terms of domestic connectivity \nremain to be addressed. In addition, the country will require additional investments to consolidate \nthe post-COVID-19 economic recovery. \n \n6.  Original project. On 16 November 2016, ADB approved a grant for $11.8 million to \nfinance  the  Outer  Island  Maritime  Infrastructure  Project  (the  original  project),  which  is \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2016. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed Grants and Administration of Grant to Tuvalu for the Outer Island Maritime Infrastructure Project. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2019. Country Operations Business Plan: 11 Small Pacific Island Countries, 2020\u20132022. Manila. \n ", "2 \n(i) constructing a workboat harbor in Nukulaelae and rehabilitating boat ramps at Nanumaga and \nNiutao, (ii) improving the capacity to operate and maintain harbors, and (iii) creating a transport \nsector master plan for future harbor development in the outer islands (footnote 1). Previously, \nADB provided a project design advance grant for the detailed engineering design, procurement \nassistance, and project management.3 The project progressed satisfactorily but incurred cost \noverruns because of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation and contract variations for the \nworks contract under the project. In parallel, the government requested ADB continued scaling \nup of the project outputs and construction of additional workboat harbors. \n \n7.  First additional financing. The government requested ADB and the World Bank to assist \nin  the  construction  of  further  workboat  harbors  in  additional  outer  islands  of  Tuvalu. \nOn 13 September 2018, ADB approved additional financing to the original project for $15.4 million \nto cover cost overruns of the original project and scale up the project outputs with the construction \nof a workboat harbor in Niutao.4 The World Bank provided parallel cofinancing assistance to \nconstruct a workboat harbor in Nanumaga under the Maritime Investment in Climate-Resilient \nOperations Project.5 \n \n8.  Summary of Project Performance. The ongoing project is performing well with contract \nawards of $16.5 million (56.5 % of total project amount) and disbursements of $12.4 million \n(42.5% of total project amount) as of 7 October 2020. The ongoing project is complying with the \nfinancial management covenants and safeguard policy requirements. Project implementation is \non track to deliver all expected outputs.6 Output 1 included the construction of a small-scale \nharbor in Nukulaelae and Niutao and rehabilitation of boat ramps in Nanumaga and Niutao. \nDespite the construction delays caused by the country\u2019s remoteness and an environment highly \nexposed to weather and natural hazards, progress on the civil works under the original project \nreached 80% in July 2020 with expected completion by the end of 2020. The civil works contract \nunder the first additional financing was awarded in October 2020. \n \n9.  The remaining two outputs of the project have been completed satisfactorily. For output 2, \nan operation and maintenance plan for the maritime infrastructure has been prepared, and \ntraining for outer island communities will be delivered after the completion of the small workboat \nharbor in Nukulaelae. For output 3, a transport sector master plan for future harbor development \nin the outer islands has been prepared and delivered. \n \n10.  Project risks are being successfully managed. The ongoing project incorporated actions \nto mitigate risks, which the government is implementing satisfactorily, such as maintaining the \nestablished project management unit (PMU) to support procurement, financial management, and \nconstruction supervision, and incorporating climate change adaptation and disaster reduction \nmeasures into the design. \n \n11.  The second additional financing is justified, given that the overall project (original project, \nfirst additional financing, and proposed second additional financing) is (i) technically feasible, cost-\neffective, and financially sound; (ii) consistent with the project\u2019s impact of safe and efficient \n \n3  ADB. 2016. Project Design Advance: Outer Island Maritime Infrastructure Project in Tuvalu. Manila. \n4  ADB. 2018. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant for Additional \nFinancing to Tuvalu for the Outer Island Maritime Infrastructure Project. Manila. \n5  World Bank. 2018. Maritime Investment in Climate Resilient Operations Project. Washington, DC. \n6  The boat ramps in Nanumaga and Niutao to be rehabilitated with ADB assistance are in different locations to the \nworkboat harbor in Nanumaga to be constructed with the World Bank assistance and the workboat harbor in Niutao \nto be constructed with ADB assistance. \n ", "3 \nmaritime  infrastructure  in  the  outer  islands;  (iii)  a  high  priority  of  the  government;  and \n(iv) consistent with the country operations business plan. \n \n12.  Second additional financing. The government has requested from ADB a second \nadditional financing to continue scaling up output 1 of the ongoing project by constructing a \nworkboat harbor in the remaining island of Nui, with a population of 610 people (2017). This is \nhighly relevant as, with ADB and World Bank assistance, all of Tuvalu\u2019s outer islands except for \nNuilakita (with a population of about 30 people) will have a workboat harbor. \n \n13.  Feasibility of second additional financing. The second additional financing is feasible \ngiven that (i) the project management capacity of the government is strengthened with the PMU \nestablished under the project design advance facility, which continues to operate for the ongoing \nproject  (footnote  3);  (ii)  the  government  has  demonstrated  sufficient financial  management \ncapacity  with  financial  statements  duly  submitted  and  approved;  and  (iii)  the  institutional \nstrengthening plan ensures the asset sustainability. These measures contribute to the feasibility \nof the project and will allow its timely implementation and sustainability. \n \n14.  Suitability  of  second  additional  financing.  The  proposed  project  is  suitable  for \nadditional financing since the impact remains unchanged. It (i) scales up the original outputs and \noutcome, extending them to an additional island; (ii) builds upon the due diligence of the ongoing \nproject, with similar environmental and social safeguards impacts; and (iii) brings efficiency gains \nusing the same PMU and implementation arrangements. \n \n15.  Alignment with strategic priorities. The National Strategy for Sustainable Development, \n2016\u20132020 (Te Kakeega III) sets out the government\u2019s vision to make maritime transport more \nefficient and safe.7 Te Kakeega III identifies that the outer islands that are in most need of \nworkboat harbors are Niutao, Nanumaga, Nui, and Nukulaelae. ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 expands \nthe focus on small island developing states to strengthen connectivity, access, and institutional \ncapacity  while  tackling  climate  change  impacts  and  disaster  risks.8 The  second  additional \nfinancing is aligned with the strategic priorities of (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing \ninequalities; (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality; (iii) building resilience to disasters and \nclimate change; (iv) promoting rural development via improving connectivity and accessibility of \nisolated populations; and (v) strengthening governance and institutional capacity.  \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n16.  The impact of the overall project remains unchanged and will be to secure safe and \nefficient maritime infrastructure in the outer islands, with climate change resilience incorporated \nin infrastructure design, protocols, and operation. The original outcome of improving maritime \ntransfer operations in Nanumaga, Niutao, and Nukulaelae, anchored on a transport sector master \nplan, with a view to promoting fisheries and tourism, will be extended to the outer island of Nui.9 \n \n17.  Output 1 of the overall project will be scaled up to include the construction of a small \nworkboat harbor in Nui to higher standards of climate and disaster resilience. The small-scale \nharbor in Nui will include a wharf, a navigation channel, a boat ramp, a passenger terminal \n(including a canteen), a transit shed, shoreline reclamation and a crane truck. These facilities will \n \n7  Government of Tuvalu. 2016. Te Kakeega III: National Strategy for Sustainable Development, 2016\u20132020. Funafuti. \n8  ADB. 2018.

Outputs 2 and 3 of the ongoing \nproject remain unchanged, with a minor change in the name of the line ministry, which is changed \nfrom Ministry of Communications and Transport to Ministry of Transport, Energy and Tourism. \n \n18.  Disaster risk context. Nui faces significant risk of disasters, including severe tropical \ncyclones, which occur frequently within the project area. The impacts of extreme weather and \nsea-level rise are projected to increase in the coming decades because of climate change. \nMaritime infrastructure plays an essential role in supporting outer island resilience by ensuring \nthe delivery of critical relief following disasters. However, the existing infrastructure is highly \nvulnerable to disaster impacts. The project will address disaster and climate risk by enhancing \nthe resilience of port infrastructure and improving its functionality during extreme weather events. \n \n19.  COVID-19 in project implementation. COVID-19 has imposed challenges on the project \ndesign, preparation, and implementation. To address the COVID-19 situation, specific provisions \nin the environmental assessment and environmental management plan (EMP) will be included in \nthe bidding documents and contracts for works under the project, requiring that the contractors \nimplement additional health and safety measures and a training program for prevention of \ncommunicable diseases including COVID-19 in coordination with the local health authorities. In \naddition, procurement will be done electronically so bidders do not need to travel to the country.  \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n20.  ADB has extensive experience in addressing the needs of, and reducing the challenges \nfaced by, Pacific developing member countries in the maritime transport sector, with ongoing and \npast support provided to improve maritime infrastructure and services in Fiji, Papua New Guinea, \nSamoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu. This project will benefit from the lessons in these projects, such as \nthe need to allocate sufficient contingencies given the nature of civil works in complex marine \nenvironments, ensure a high level of readiness, and ensure the appropriate scheduling of civil \nworks to avoid cyclone seasons. \n \n21.  ADB has also gained valuable experience during the implementation of the ongoing \nproject. Lessons in project management and procurement will be applied for the implementation \nof the second additional financing, such as the need to mitigate against delays in mobilization with \nthe provision of advanced payment upon mobilization to site; the convenience of using electronic \nprocurement; and the need to achieve early involvement of the contractor to improve the design, \nfacilitate construction, and increase market interest. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n22.  The second additional financing is estimated to cost $22.2 million and the overall project \n(original project, first additional financing, and the proposed second additional financing) is \nestimated to cost $52.4 million (Table 1). \n \n   \n ", "5 \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nCurrent  Additional \nItem  Amounta  Financingb  Total \nA.

The government has requested a grant not exceeding $20 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the project. This amount includes \n$1.48 million in grant resources from the disaster risk reduction financing mechanism under the \n12th replenishment of the Asian Development Fund. The summary financing plan is in Table 2. \nADB will finance the expenditures in relation to civil works, consulting services for construction \nsupervision, and individual consultants of the PMU, in parallel with ongoing project activities under \nthe original project and the first additional financing. \n \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \nAdditional \n  Currenta    Financing    Total \nAmount  Share  Amount  Share  Amount  Share of \n($  of Total  ($  of Total  ($  Total \nSource  million)  (%)    million)  (%)    million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank                 \n  Special Funds  26.7  88.4    20.0  90.3    46.7  89.2 \nresources (Asian \nDevelopment Fund \ngrant) \nGlobal Environment Facility  0.5  1.7    0.0  0.0    0.5  1.0 \n(grant)b \nGovernment of Tuvalu  3.0  9.9    2.2  9.7    5.2  9.8 \n  Total  30.2  100.0    22.2  100.0    52.4  100.0 \na  Refers to the original financing and first additional financing. \nb  Administered by the Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n24.  For the second additional financing, climate adaptation is estimated to cost $3.1 million. \nADB will finance 100% of the adaptation costs. Climate change adaptation activities include \ncoastal protection measures and allowances in the maritime structures and foundations for the \nfuture rise of sea levels in the harbor. Raising the harbor levels to accommodate high sea-level \nrise projections would reduce the harbor\u2019s usability as the wharf will be too high for the transfer of \npeople and goods according to the current tidal conditions. The cost of disaster risk reduction \nmeasures to enhance the disaster resilience of the harbor is $2.0 million and includes land-side \n ", "6 \ninfrastructure  improvements  and  coastal  protection  measures  to  withstand  the  impacts  of \ndisasters, mainly cyclones.10 \n \n25.  Detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and by financier are included in the \nproject  administration manual  (PAM).11 The  civil  works  for  the  harbor  represent the major \nexpenditure under the project. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n26.  Project  management  arrangements.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the \nexecuting  agency  and  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works,  Infrastructure,  Environment,  Labor, \nMeteorology  and  Disaster  (MPWIELMD)  will  be  the  implementing  agency  for  the  second \nadditional financing. At the request of the government, the Ministry of Communications and \nTransport, acting as the executing agency and implementing agency for the ongoing project, will \nbe replaced by the MOF as the executing agency and by the MPWIELMD as the implementing \nagency. The National Infrastructure Steering Committee, jointly chaired by the ministers of the \nMOF and MPWIELMD, will provide oversight to the overall project. The established PMU will \ncontinue supporting the government and will be transferred to the MPWIELMD. \n \n27.  Consulting services and procurement. Procurement and recruitment of all consultants \nwill follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time), the Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time), and associated staff \ninstructions.  Retroactive  financing  and  advance  contracting  will  be  used  to  accelerate  the \nrecruitment  of  consultants.  The  government  has  been  advised  that  approval  of  advance \ncontracting does not commit ADB to finance the project. \n \n28.  The  project  will  achieve  the  best  value  for  money  through  optimal  procurement \narrangements by (i) using e-procurement to lower the transaction cost and enhance efficiency \nand transparency, (ii) attracting international contracting firms to deliver high-quality civil works \nunder  a  single  package  ($14  million)  following  open  competitive  bidding  with  international \nadvertisement, and (iii) recruiting an international consulting firm using quality- and cost-based \nselection to ensure high-quality construction supervision services. \n \n29.  The government requested ADB\u2019s procurement implementation support for recruitment of \nconsultants for the project. A delegation matrix outlining the responsibilities of the government \nand ADB for consultant selection has been signed by the MOF, MPWIELMD, and ADB. ADB will \nsupport the recruitment process, including the advertisement, tender, and evaluation stages. The \ngovernment will remain responsible for selecting, negotiating, and signing the consulting contracts. \n \n30.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n31.  The project includes the construction of a workboat harbor in Nui, including a navigation \nchannel, a boat ramp, a passenger terminal, a cargo shed, and shoreline reclamation. The project \nfollows a similar and consistent approach to the original project and is technically feasible. \nAll facilities are designed following Australian and New Zealand technical standards with a design \nlife of 50 years. Climate change and potential disaster risk impacts, such as a predicted sea-level \nrise, an increase in wave height, and an increase in the intensity and frequency of tropical \ncyclones and other risks from extreme weather events, have been analyzed under the climate \nrisk vulnerability assessment and are reflected in the preliminary and detailed design to address \nthe climate change and disaster risks. The adaptation and disaster risk reduction measures \nrecommended for incorporation in the designs concern the marine structures, boat ramp, channel, \nand onshore facilities. The facilities also include features to minimize and/or reduce erosion and \nsiltation. Concrete structures do not require significant maintenance. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n32.  The project will provide faster and safer navigation for passengers and cargo to Nui island, \nallowing for time savings by passengers and savings in vessel waiting times with reduced cargo \ntransfer times. The savings are valued at $181,000 annually. In addition to these direct benefits, \nthere are several unquantified benefits, such as improved safety of passengers while travelling \nthrough the channel and at embarkation and disembarkation points, reduced damage to cargo, \nand overall saving in the time the ship takes to go around, thus benefiting all outer islands and \n ", "8 \nproviding the people with positive benefits associated with improved access. The assessment \ndetermined that the proposed boat harbor at Nui is the least-cost option in reducing travel times \nand vessel operating costs. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n33.  ADB assessed the government\u2019s capacity to sustain project outputs and shipping services \nas adequate. This is not a revenue-generating project, and passenger and cargo revenues will \nnot cover the maintenance of the shipping service, including the project facilities. However, the \ngovernment has been satisfactorily maintaining the ships, which to date have operated safely. \nThe major  incremental  maintenance  cost  associated  with  the  project  will  be  maintenance \ndredging of a new channel after every major tropical cyclone, which have been occurring about \nevery 10 years. The analysis showed that the government has sufficient revenues and budgetary \nallocations for such major maintenance activity, estimated at A$100,000 per year, and other \nmaintenance requirements. \n \n34.  The government created the Deferred Maintenance Fund in 2015 to transfer funds \nannually to the Tuvalu Development Fund for long-term maintenance of government assets, \nguided by an approved maintenance policy. The deferred maintenance fund is an expenditure \nitem used by a ministry to request budget allocation for repair and maintenance. Coupled with \nplanned institutional strengthening activities and the training in basic and routine maintenance for \nthe outer island communities after the completion of the harbors, the second additional financing \nis financially sustainable. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n35.  Financial management. A financial management assessment following ADB\u2019s financial \nmanagement  guidelines  was  conducted  for  the  MOF  as  the  executing  agency  and  the \nMPWIELMD as the implementing agency of the project. The financial management capacity of \nthe MOF and MPWIELMD were considered adequate. The MOF is also the executing agency of \ntwo other ADB-funded ongoing projects that are performing well, and the PMU for the ongoing \nproject, established in 2015, will be transferred to the MPWIELMD. The overall assessed pre-\nmitigation financial management risk is moderate with weakness highlighted under the internal \naudit function that needs to be extended to other government offices. \n \n36.  Procurement risk assessment. ADB completed a project procurement risk assessment \nfor  the  executing  agency  and  implementing  agency  proposed  for  the  project.  Overall,  the \nprocurement risk is moderate. The government and ADB have learned several lessons from the \nprocurement  activities  undertaken  under  the  ongoing  project.  Procurement  risk  will  remain \nmoderate  only  with  continued  support  of  international  consultants.  ADB  staff  will  oversee \nprocurement activities under the project to ensure good governance. \n \n37.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, the MOF, and the MPWIELMD. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 11). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n38.  Poverty and social. The improvement in maritime infrastructure and operations in Nui will \nenhance access to essential services and economic opportunities for this outer island community. \nThe workboat harbor will facilitate improved and safer access to interisland transport, including \n ", "9 \nsafer access for people with limited mobility, such as pregnant women, the elderly, young children, \nand the disabled, as well as increase the range of services available and accessible to Nui \nresidents because of the upgraded docking capabilities. The project will create jobs during \nconstruction and the contractor will be required to employ and train local men and women. \nThe workboat harbor will improve access to basic services and emergency support during times \nof disasters triggered by natural hazards and climate events. \n \n39.  Gender  equality.  The  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming  and \nadditional gender measures will be added to the overall project gender action plan. Proactive \ngender measures include targets for women working in construction (in both technical and \nnontechnical roles); support to women to work in nontraditional jobs; gender and gender-based \nviolence training and awareness raising for contractors and communities; ensuring infrastructure \nis safe and accessible for women and vulnerable groups; and income-generating opportunities \nfor women, e.g., areas for women to sell food and/or handicrafts in the terminal. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n40.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories12 are as follows. \n \n41.  Environment (category B). The categorization of the second additional financing is \naligned with the ongoing project. A number of alternative locations for the harbor, land-side \nfacilities, and reclamation have been considered and the proposed option provides the most \nsuitable  from  an  environmental  perspective  (coastal  processes,  i.e.,  littoral  drift,  sand \ntransportation, wave climate, and marine ecology) and social perspective (access, minimization \nof land requirements). The impacts of the Nui workboat harbor are site-specific, limited to the \nfootprint of the small-scale harbor (including extending and widening the existing channel) and \nassociated land-side facilities on Nui, and can be mitigated and managed to acceptable levels \nprovided  the  measures  identified  in  the  initial  environmental  examination  and  EMP  are \nimplemented and subsequently monitored and reported on. The Department of Environment has \nadequate capacity to monitor the project with the PMU\u2019s support. The PAM sets out the detailed \nprocedures for implementation in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and country \nsafeguards system, including developing the construction EMP based on the project EMP and \ndetailing and reflecting the contractor\u2019s methodology and approach to the main construction \nelements, risk assessment, and mitigation measures.13 \n \n42.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The construction of a small workboat harbor in \nNui will not result in involuntary land acquisition or physical or economic displacement. The Nui \nproject\u2019s main components will be located on reclaimed and foreshore land recognized as crown \nland within Tuvalu laws. An estimated 1.96 hectares will be leased for about 3 years for access \nroads and a construction-related area, and there will be impacts on privately owned trees within \nthese leased areas. Alternatives to the designs will be developed if the landowners do not provide \ntheir consent and agree to compensation for affected trees. There may be long-term leases \narranged for some minor associated facilities, and the government may transfer leases for the \naccess road to long-term leases if the landowners consent. A due diligence report has been \nprepared and outlines the requirement for a third-party verifier to monitor the lease agreement \n \n12 ADB. Safeguard Categories.  \n13 This will include a health and safety plan aligned with World Health Organization. 2020. Considerations for public \nhealth  and  social measures  in  the  workplace in  the context  of  COVID-19.  https://www.who.int/publications-\ndetail/considerations-for-public-health-and-social-measures-in-the-workplace-in-the-context-of-covid-19. \n ", "10 \nprocess. The due diligence report and initial environmental examination include a grievance \nredress  mechanism  for  the  Nui  project,  which  incorporates  local  processes  for  resolving \ngrievances regarding land matters. \n \n43.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The additional financing project will not impact on any \ndistinct and vulnerable group of indigenous peoples as defined under ADB's Safeguard Policy \nStatement. The majority (94%) of the population of Tuvalu (11,646) is Polynesian, with the island \natoll of Nui having a population of 610 (2017). Group identification is based on a person's island \nof origin and family circle, which is deemed according to one\u2019s kinship affiliations. There are three \nfamily circles in Nui. None are considered distinct and vulnerable indigenous peoples (as defined \nin ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement). Activities under the second additional financing project will \nbe implemented in a culturally appropriate and participatory manner. \n  \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n44.
