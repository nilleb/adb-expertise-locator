Years  of  weak  sector  and  corporate \ngovernance, corporate mismanagement, unnecessary staff recruitment, and interference by line \nministries  in  operational  affairs  have  contributed  to  PSEs\u2019  poor  service  delivery  and  crippling \nfinancial  problems. 3  Over  the  past  few  decades,  the  government  has  not  had  sufficient \ncapabilities\u2014institutional,  technical,  and  legal\u2014to  instill  sustained  improvements  in  PSE \nmanagement.  Political  objectives  have  often  conflicted  with  commercial  realities,  undermining \nPSE performance and limiting commercial prospects.4 \n \n4. \nTaxpayers  ultimately  bear  the  costs  of  these  inefficiencies.  Many  PSEs  have  been \nimposing  significant  fiscal  costs,  requiring  discretionary  fiscal  transfers  and  sovereign  credit \nguarantees  to  continue  operating.  Without  strict  performance  conditions  and  credible  sunset \nclauses,  the  government  has  inadvertently  enabled  a  corporate  culture  of  soft  budget \nconstraints  that  removes  incentives  for  PSEs  to  improve.  The  fiscal  transfers  to  PSEs  are \nestimated  at  several  hundred  billion  Pakistan  rupees  per  year.5 In  addition  to  these  transfers, \nPSEs had accumulated domestic debt of PRs366.5 billion and external debt of PRs205.7 billion \nequivalent by the end of December 2013.6 \n \n5. \nMost  PSEs  suffer  from  low  labor  productivity  and  poor  management.  For  key  PSEs  in \ninfrastructure services, such as power distribution, tariff collection is deficient and revenues are \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  J.  Speakman.  2012.  SOE  Reform:  Time  for  Serious  Corporate  Governance.  World  Bank Policy  Paper  Series  on \n\nPakistan. PK04/12. Washington, DC: World Bank. \n\n3  Noteworthy  for  their  recent  poor  performance  are  major  PSEs  including  Pakistan  International  Airlines,  Pakistan \nRailways, and Pakistan Steel Mills, along with regional power distribution companies and thermal power generation \ncompanies, which were under the control of the Pakistan Electric Power Company. \n\n4  J.

Washington, DC: World Bank. \n\n5  The  government  has  not  been  able  to  systematically  track  the  PSE-related  fiscal  losses.  They  can  be  hidden \nthrough  subsidies  to  end  users,  sovereign  credit  guarantees,  asset  depreciation,  and  other  noncash  measures. \nFiscal  transfers  to  PSEs  were  PRs512  billion  in  FY2012,  of  which  PRs464  billion  were  for  PSEs  in  the  energy \nsector.

Karachi. \n\n\fbelow  cost-recovery  levels.7 Investments  are  thus  insufficient  to  ensure  competitiveness,  and \noverall  private  sector  growth  is  hampered  by  distorted  product  and  infrastructure  services \nmarkets. PSE service delivery is substandard. The government\u2019s footprint in the energy sector \nhas  produced  inefficiencies  that  impose  fiscal  costs  and  create  a  circular  debt  problem.8 This \nresults  from  inefficiencies  in  state-owned  power  sector  companies,  such  as  workforces  that \nexceed  requirements  and  an  inability  to  collect  revenues.  The  direct  involvement  of  the \ngovernment  in  energy  production  and  distribution  has  also  reduced  its  ability  to  perform  its \nregulatory role. Economically disadvantaged groups are not able to substitute inefficient public \nservices  with  private  sector  alternatives.  The  sector  needs  to  be  revamped  to  sustainably \nremove this binding constraint on Pakistan\u2019s growth. \n \n6. \nThe  Finance  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Revenue,  Economic  Affairs,  Statistics \nand Privatization (MOF) is the ultimate shareholder in PSEs where the government has equity \nparticipation or full ownership.9 Within the Finance Division, the Corporate Finance Wing (CFW) \nis  responsible  for  all  financial  and  corporate  matters  related  to  PSEs,  but  its  role  has  been \nlimited  to  representation  on  the  boards  of  PSEs  and  administration  of  PSE  subsidies  and \nguarantees.  Line  ministries  are  influential  in  PSE  operations  through  (i)  sector  policies,  (ii) \nappointment of the board (through the Prime Minister) and of the chief executing officer (before \nthe Securities Exchange Commission of Pakistan [SECP] rules were issued), (iii) representation \non PSE boards, and (iv) other indirect channels (managerial capture). The approval of subsidy \nrequests for PSEs involves the board of directors and the respective line ministry, but the CFW \nprocesses  the  request  for  the  finance  minister\u2019s  approval.  This  provides  the  CFW  with \nopportunities to exercise different levels of stringency. However, the CFW has limited technical \ncapacity  and  information  to  properly  analyze  and  scrutinize  the  justification  for  requests,  and \nthus to implement its legal mandate. The CFW recently started an assessment of the financial \nperformance of PSEs. The first report is expected to be published by December 2014. \n \n7. \nthe  poor \nperformance of PSEs and vowed to revamp these entities. However, repeated efforts to improve \ntheir  performance  have  been  unsuccessful.  A  rising  number  of  stakeholders  now  favor \ngovernment  divestiture  of  most  PSEs  through  a  comprehensive  reform  program.  Encouraging \ncommitments have been made since September 2013 under a new International Monetary Fund \n(IMF) $6.7 billion extended facility:10 the government has identified 68 PSEs for privatization, of \nwhich  31  PSEs  are  expected  to  be  partially  privatized. 11 For  profitable  PSEs,  divestiture  is \nexpected through capital market transactions. For the more problematic PSEs, partial ownership \nand management control is likely to be transferred to strategic private investors.12 However, key \n                                                \n7  For example, despite a 160% increase in power tariffs since 2008, fiscal subsidies to power distribution companies \n\nin  Pakistan  have  expressed  concerns  over \n\nSuccessive  governments \n\nremain high at 1.8% of GDP, or $3.8 billion equivalent. \n\n8  Circular  debt  is  the  amount  of  payments  held  back  by  an  entity  from  creditors,  so  that  it  can  push  its  cash  flow \nproblems down to other segments of the supply chain. In the Pakistan power sector, circular debt is the cash flow \nshortfall incurred by the sector with the Central Power Purchasing Agency at its center. \n\n9  Some PSEs are departmental or divisional undertakings that fall directly under the line ministry or even constitute a \ndepartment, as in the case of Pakistan Railways. These undertakings are similar to PSEs, but since they are not \ndistinguishable  entities,  they  are  here not  considered  as  PSEs.  They  are  part  of  the  national  budget  and  cannot \naccumulate debt independently, but can be costly to the budget. \n\n10 International Monetary Fund. 2014. IMF Country Report No. 14/90. IMF: Washington DC. \n11 Government  of  Pakistan,  Privatisation  Commission.  Broad-Based  Privatisation  Programme  of  the  Government. \n\nhttp://www.privatisation.gov.pk/Policy%20and%20Objectives/Privatisation%20Programme.htm \n\n12 Actions  on  these  31  PSEs  are  listed  as  IMF  program  conditions.  Eleven  of  them\u2014in  the  oil  and  gas,  banking, \ninsurance,  and  power  sectors\u2014have  been  identified  for  privatization  by  block  sales  in  the  capital  markets.  In  17 \ncompanies\u2014mainly in the energy sector\u2014increased private sector participation is expected to improve the value of \nthe  government\u2019s  residual  shareholding.  Three  PSEs  in  the  oil  and  gas  sectors  are  marked  for  restructuring, \nfollowed by privatization in segments. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fconstraints  to  these  PSE  reforms  need  to  be  addressed  to  lower  fiscal  pressures  from  PSEs \nand to improve service provision and sector management. \n \n8. \nThe  results  of  privatization  and  restructuring  programs  have  been  mixed,  both \ninternationally and in Pakistan. Past privatization efforts in Pakistan\u2019s finance sector have been \nmore  successful  than  those  in  the  main  infrastructure  sectors.  Without  a  strategically  planned \nand  paced  restructuring  and  privatization  program,  it  is  difficult  to  ensure  consistency  and \ntransparency,  and  vested  interests  and  lawsuits  can  stifle  reforms. 13  Recent  political \ncommitments  are  yet  to  be  framed  into  a  comprehensive  and  time-bound  strategy  for \nrestructuring,  privatization,  and  governance  improvements  in  the  PSEs  and  in  the  sectors \ndominated by PSEs. An effective communications plan is also crucial to inform the public about \nthe  PSE  reform  program  and  its  benefits  and  costs.  This  can  generate  widespread  public \nsupport  for  the  changes,  and  prevent  political  economy  issues  from  derailing  reform \nimplementation.  Technical  capacity  at  key  agencies  and  coordination  mechanisms  between \nthem need to be strengthened. \n \nTA  and expert  advice will  also  be  crucial for the strategic  restructuring  work  that many \n9. \nPSEs  require  before  any  further  divestiture  can  take  place.  However,  almost  a  decade  of \nreduced privatization activity has drained the technical capacity of the Privatisation Commission, \nwhich has seen most of its senior transaction managers and legal counsels depart. Much of the \nsenior-level institutional memory of the challenges that past privatization drives faced and how \nthose  were  overcome  has  been  lost.14 The  Privatisation  Commission  Fund  does  not  have  the \nresources  needed  to  manage  and  pay  for  the  significant  pre-transaction  work  at  key  PSEs.15 \nThe  current  rules  and  practices  on  the  use  of  these  resources,  which  mix  funding  for \nprivatization  transaction  advisers  with  funding  for  the  commission\u2019s  general  operational \nexpenditures, can be improved. These shortfalls prevent the fund from becoming a transparent \nand  effective  tool  to  support  privatization.  The  current  regulatory  regimes  in  the  infrastructure \nsectors  also  lack  appropriate  institutions  and  rules  for  effective  regulation  if  the  PSEs  are \nprivatized. \n \n10. \nFunding  will  also  be  required  to  meet  the  substantial  adjustment  costs  needed  to \nimplement PSE restructuring and privatization. The costs include voluntary separation schemes \nfor  workers,  debt  legacy  retirement,  and  potential  write-off  of  uncollectible  receivables  by  the \npower  distribution  companies  (total  receivables  of  more  than  PRs480  billion  as  of  30  June \n2013). As privatization proceeds will not accrue immediately, these revenues may not be able to \nfinance  a  substantial  part  of  the  adjustment  costs.  The  government  has  asked  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  and  other  development  partners  to  support  the  strategic  policy  and \n\n                                                \n13 An impact assessment of the last Pakistan privatization program concluded that it was a success. Of the 95 PSEs \nprivatized from 1991 to 1996, 32% performed better after privatization, 39% performed at the same level, and 29% \nperformed  worse.  Privatization  proceeds  (totaling  4.3%  of  GDP)  had  some  macroeconomic  significance.  Key \nrecommendations to the government included (i) develop a comprehensive public awareness program, and (ii) gain \naccess to a constant source of advice on utility sector reform and regulatory matters.

An ADB independent evaluation \nconcluded  that  developing  member  countries\u2019  privatization  experience  was  positive,  but  privatization  had \nproceeded  largely  without  attention  to  the  sequencing  of  reforms  and  appropriateness  of  the  approach  for \nmaximizing  its  effectiveness.

Manila: ADB. \n\n14 The government established the Privatisation Commission in 1991 to implement the privatization program. In 2000, \n\nthe Privatisation Commission was converted into a sovereign corporate body. \n\n15 All privatization proceeds are deposited in a distinct and  separate account called the Privatisation Fund. The fund \nis currently resourced with about $10 million equivalent. It is a revolving fund that is replenished with proceeds from \nthe privatization of PSEs. The retention levels have not yet been set with the Finance Division of the MOF. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nfinancial requirements of the PSE reform and privatization agenda. \n \n11. \nThe project will finance TA for PSE reforms, primarily in the form of consulting services. \nThis  assistance  is  aligned  with  the  interim  country  partnership  strategy  for  Pakistan  and  is \nincluded  in  the  country  operations  business  plan,  2014\u20132016. 16  The  country  operations \nbusiness  plan  also  includes  two  programmatic  assistance  loans  (budget  support)  to  help \naddress the adjustment costs of PSE reforms (para. 10), one of which\u2014the Sustainable Energy \nSector Reform Program (SESRP)\u2014has already been approved.17 The project will contribute to \nthe  implementation  of  these  two  programmatic  assistance  loans  by  providing  the  government \nwith  technical  inputs  and  capacity  to  monitor  the  reforms.  The  ADB  processing  team  is \ncoordinating  its  proposed  intervention  with  other  development  partners  active  in  this  area, \nparticularly the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom, the IMF, the \nUnited States Agency for International Development, and the World Bank. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  impact  will  be  reduced  fiscal  and  economic  costs  associated  with  Pakistan  PSEs. \n\n12. \nThe outcome will be successful privatization and restructuring of selected PSEs. \n \nC. \n \n13. \nThe  project\u2019s  outputs  will  help  the  government  address  the  technical  and  policy \nrequirements  of  its  PSE  reform  agenda,  enabling  it  to  (i)  define  a  strategy  that  coordinates \ndifferent  government  agencies,  sets  guiding  principles  (such  as  transparency  and  consistency \non  labor-related  issues),  and  incorporates  sequencing  concerns (including  important trade-offs \nbetween fiscal space and the timing of transactions); (ii) communicate effectively from the onset; \nand (iii)  initiate  and  implement  the key  preparation  work for  PSE  restructuring (pre-transaction \ntechnical  advice)  to  help  minimize  the  necessary  adjustment  costs  during  and  after \nprivatizations, and maximize any residual shareholding value after partial divestment. \n \n14. \nCommission will be the implementing agency for this output, which includes two sub-outputs: \n \n\nOutput  1:  Strengthened  privatization  program  (footnote  11).

The  SESRP  focuses  on  the  technical,  commercial,  and \nregulatory  issues  in  the  energy  sector,  which  complements  and  supports  outputs  1\u20133  of  this  project,  where  the \nMinistry  of  Water  and  Power  (MOWP)  and  the  Ministry  of  Petroleum  and  Natural  Resources  are  implementing \nagencies.

The Privatisation Commission, the Finance Division of the \nMOF  (the  Economic  Reforms  Unit  and  the  CFW),  and  the  SECP  will  be  the  implementing \nagencies for this output, which includes two sub-outputs:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nlegal  experts,  and \n\nOutput  2.1:  Public  sector  enterprise  restructuring. TA and expert advice will \nbe crucial for the strategic restructuring work that many PSEs require before any \nfurther  divestiture  can  take  place.  The  business  advisory,  pre-transaction  work \nthat is necessary to prepare corporate restructuring proposals for key PSEs (e.g., \nbalance-sheet  bifurcation  proposals,18 improvement  of  internal  financial  controls \nand  financial  reporting,  and  reorientation  of  markets  and  operations)  will  be \nundertaken  under  this  sub-output.  This  work  may  involve  the  services  of \nmanagement  consultants,  accounting  and \nfinancial \nrestructuring experts. The government  will  propose the  PSEs  to  be restructured \nunder  the  project,  which  should  meet  the  following  criteria:  (a)  the  PSE  is \nimposing  significant  direct  and  indirect  costs  to  the  federal  government  budget; \n(b) the government has in place a long-term vision for the sector where the PSE \noperates; and (c) the government clearly demonstrates its will to lead, guide, and \ncomplete the restructuring process within the project implementation period. \nOutput  2.2:  Public  sector  enterprise  performance  monitoring.  The  project \nwill  fund  accounting,  management,  and  financial  consulting  services  to  develop \nthe  capacity  of  the  CFW  and  the  Economic  Reforms  Unit  to  monitor  the  PSE \nportfolio,  assess  fiscal  liabilities,  identify  and  track  potential  PSE  issues,  and \noversee  corporate  restructuring  of  selected  PSEs.  The  project  will  also  help \ndevelop  the  analytical  capacity  of  the  CFW  and  the  Economic  Reforms  Unit  to \ncarry  out  sector  benchmarking  and compare  performance  of  PSEs.  The  project \nwill  support  SECP  enforcement  of  PSE  compliance  with  the  new  corporate \ngovernance  rules  and  guidelines  by  establishing  interagency  coordination \nmechanisms and an online reporting and monitoring system at the SECP.19 \n\n \n16. \nOutput  3:  Enhanced  governance  and  regulatory  regimes  of  selected  sectors \ncurrently  dominated  by  public  sector  enterprises.  For  effective  privatization  of  PSEs  in \n\n                                                \n18 Corporate restructuring solutions may include separation of assets and liabilities of PSEs into several legal entities. \n19 SECP.  2013.

To  ensure  that \nefficiency  gains  in  PSEs  providing  infrastructure  services  do  not  come  at  the  expense  of  the \nconsumer,  effective  regulatory  regimes  also  need  to  be  established,  particularly  for  ongoing \nmedium-term  reforms  in  the  energy  sector  (footnote  17).  The  Economic  Reforms  Unit  and \nspecific regulatory agencies will oversee the work under this output, which has two sub-outputs: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nOutput 3.1: Energy sector reform monitoring. Monitoring units for the SESRP \nwill  be  established  in  the  Ministry  of  Water  and  Power  (MOWP)  and  in  the \nMinistry  of  Petroleum  and  Natural  Resources  (MPNR).  These  units  will  support \nthe ministries in preparing quarterly reform monitoring reports to be submitted to \nthe  Economic  Coordination  Committee  (ECC).  TA  in  the  regulatory,  technical, \nlegal,  and  communications  areas  will  be  provided  through  the  project  to  assist \nwith  the  implementation  of  the  SESRP.  Technical  experts  will  also  be  hired  to \nmonitor reform progress. Support through analytic studies will also be considered \nin coordination with other development partners. \nOutput  3.2:  Key  sector  reforms. Assistance to other regulatory authorities can \nbe  selectively  provided  under  this  sub-output,  particularly  in  sectors  related  to \nOutput 2.1. The project will finance the recruitment of technical experts to support \nsector  efficiency  assessments  and  the  preparation  of  sector  restructuring  road \nmaps,  which  will  be  prepared  in  coordination  with  the  respective  line  ministries \nand  the  Ministry  of  Planning,  Development  and  Reform.  The  project  will  also \nfinance the recruitment of experts to conduct competition assessments in sectors \naffected  by  the  privatization  and  restructuring  of  PSEs,  and  where  market \nconcentration  is  high.  These  assessments  will  be  prepared  in  coordination  with \nthe Competition Commission. \n\n \n17. \nOutput 4: Efficiently and effectively managed project.

Workers in PSEs are expected to benefit from a consistent and fair approach to \nlabor  retrenchment,  which  will  be  provided  through  the  mitigation  framework  for  labor-related \nmatters to be developed under the project. \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe  PSE  reform  agenda  supported  by  the  project  is  economically  viable  since  the \n24. \nefficiency gains are expected to exceed the adjustment costs. The conclusions are supported by \nthe financial analysis. Successful privatization that reduces the fiscal drain of PSEs will benefit \ntaxpayers  and  the  beneficiaries  of  public  goods.  The  availability  of  higher-quality  goods  and \nservices provided by privatized companies are expected to compensate for tariff adjustments.22 \n\n                                                \n22 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nB. \n \n25. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  showed  that  the  Finance  Division  of  the  MOF \nand the Privatisation Commission have higher-quality internal control systems than most of the \nsystems in the government. However, these agencies do not fully meet international standards \nof governance. The Finance Division of the MOF has experienced control breaches, and many \ndocuments  are  maintained  only  on  paper.  The  Privatisation  Commission  does  not  have  a \nfinancial  and  accounting  manual  for  implementation  of  the  accounting  procedure  rules.  These \nrules  do  not  have  a  strong  link  with  the  Commission\u2019s  internal  control  system.  The  Finance \nDivision  of the  MOF and the  Privatisation  Commission  have  a  limited  number  of  staff  with  the \nrequired financial management skills. However, with the proposed mitigating measures in place \n(para. 31), the financial management arrangements are adequate to implement the project. \n \n26. \nThe  Finance  Division  of  the  MOF  lacks  procurement  specialists  who  have  experience \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time) and the Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The Privatisation Commission \npossesses  adequate  skills,  experience,  and  capacity  to  procure  consulting  services  in \naccordance  with ADB\u2019s Guidelines  on  the  Use of  Consultants.  Basic  concepts  of  procurement \nand  practices  being  followed  in  the  Privatisation  Commission  are  largely  consistent  with  ADB \nguidelines.23  \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  including  the  Finance  Division  of  the  MOF.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \n \nC. \n \n28. \nThe  project  will  help  the  government  reduce  the  economic  and  fiscal  costs  that \nPakistan\u2019s  PSEs  are  imposing  on  consumers,  taxpayers,  and  beneficiaries  of  social  services. \nThe  project  will  maximize  the  benefits  that  private  management  and  improved  corporate  and \nsector  governance  can  bring  to  PSE  economic  efficiency  and  financial  feasibility.  These \nchanges are expected to improve access to basic services such as electricity. The PSEs to be \nrestructured  and  privatized  may  decrease  their  demand  for  low-skilled  labor.  The  project  will \ndevelop  a  framework  for  labor  issues,  under  which  the  government  is  expected  to  regularly \nconsult  labor  unions  to  ensure  that  workers\u2019  rights  are  respected  during  restructuring  and \nprivatization. The poor are not expected to be affected by potential increases in tariffs to cost-\nrecovery  levels  (e.g.,  electricity  tariffs)  if,  as  planned,  existing  government  subsidies  are \nretargeted  at  low-income households. The  customer  surveys  to be financed by  the  project  will \nmonitor  service  delivery  and  tariff  structures  of  PSEs  throughout  project  implementation,  with \nspecific consideration of poor consumers. The government, with ADB support, is strengthening \nits national social protection program, which already includes a targeting framework. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nSafeguards \n\nD. \n \nThe project will have no impact on the environment or on indigenous peoples, and does \n29. \nnot entail any involuntary resettlement. It is classified as category C for environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \n\n                                                \n23 An  assessment  of  the  procurement  capacity  of  the  Finance  Division  of  the  MOF  and  of  the  Privatisation \n\nCommission is available upon request. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nE. \n \n30. \nThe major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment \nand risk management plan.24 Deterioration of the political and security situation in Pakistan may \naffect  investor  confidence,  and  vested  interests  and  legal  obstacles  may  disrupt  the  reform \nagenda. The government\u2019s PSE reform and privatization program may focus only on profitable \nPSEs, reducing potential efficiency gains. To mitigate these concerns, the project will develop (i) \na public  communications  plan  to  ensure  transparency,  raise public  awareness and support for \nthe reforms, and manage expectations about the accessibility and services provided by PSEs; \nand (ii)  a mitigation framework  for  labor  issues. The  ECC  will  oversee project  implementation. \nBy helping the government lead the policy dialogue, the project will reduce the scope for vested \ninterests to disrupt the reform agenda. Policy-based lending (programmatic assistance) is being \nprepared (footnote 17) to provide incentives to restructure fiscally costly PSEs. \n \n31. \nTo ensure compliance with ADB policies and guidelines, assistance and oversight will be \nrequired  at  the  project  level  to  address  the  small  number  of  staff  and  weak  financial  skills, \ninternal  controls,  cash  management,  and  forecasting  systems  in  the  MOF\u2019s  Finance  Division \nand  the  Privatisation  Commission.  The  PMU  will  engage  full-time,  qualified  accountant  and \nprocurement  specialists.  ADB  will  provide  the  Finance  Division  with  updated  disbursement \nprojections  during  review  missions  to  help  plan  cash  requirements.  The  project  financial \nstatements  will  be  audited  by  the  Office  of  the  Auditor  General  of  Pakistan.  The  project\u2019s \nintegrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nThe  government  and \n\nthe  Privatisation  Commission  have  assured  ADB \n\n \n32. \nthat \nimplementation  of  the  project  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those \nconcerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n33. \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \n \n\nThe government and the Finance Division of the MOF have agreed with ADB on certain \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n34. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR13,459,000  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Public \nSector  Enterprise  Reforms  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with  an  interest \ncharge at the rate of 2.0% per annum during the grace period and thereafter; for a term of 25 \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n                                                \n24 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n11 November 2014 \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n \nFinance Division of the \nMOF, annual federal \nbudget reports \n\nAssumptions and \nRisks \n\nAssumption \nGovernment does not \ninvest in new fiscally \ncostly PSEs \n\n \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \nReduced fiscal and \neconomic costs \nassociated with \nPakistan\u2019s PSEs  \n\nOutcome \nSuccessful \nprivatization and \nrestructuring of \nselected PSEs \n\nOutputs \n1.
