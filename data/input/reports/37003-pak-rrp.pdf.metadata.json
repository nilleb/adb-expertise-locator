An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was \nundertaken  and  the  main  findings  were  summarized  in  the \nsummary  environmental  impact  assessment  (SEIA),  which  was \ncirculated  to  the  Board  and  posted  on  the  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB) website on 19 July 2005. \n \nThe  Project\u2014developed  under  the  overall  framework  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  outlined  in  its  10-Year \nPerspective  Development  Plan  2001\u20132011\u2014will  improve  living \nconditions  in  Rawalpindi,  a  city  of  about  2.2 million  people \nadjoining Islamabad in Punjab province. It comprises three parts: \n(i)  environmental  sanitation \n(including  sewerage,  sewage \ntreatment,  stormwater  drainage,  solid  waste  management, \nslaughterhouse  replacement,  and  public  toilets);  (ii) water  supply \nimprovement  (including  replacement  of  tubewells,  rehabilitation \nand  construction  of  distribution  networks,  water  meter \nfor \ninstallations,  and  water  supply  and  sanitation \nschools); \n(including \ndevelopment  of  municipal  management,  an  urban  environmental \ndevelopment plan, asset management, and urban planning). \n \nIn Rawalpindi, high urban growth (4% per year), slow urban sector \ndevelopment,  lack  of  resources,  and  inadequate  institutional \ncapacity have resulted in uncontrolled urban sprawl, deteriorating \nurban environments, and deficiencies in urban services (including \nwater  supply,  sewerage  systems,  drainage,  solid  waste \nmanagement, and community facilities). The resulting deficiencies \nparticularly  affected  the  urban  poor  and  led  to  a  considerably \nreduced  quality  of  life,  including  poor  health.  In  1993,  ADB \napproved  a  loan  of  $72  million  for  the  Rawalpindi  Urban  Water \nSupply  and  Sanitation  Project,  as  the  first  phase  of  a  proposed \nthree-phase project for improving water and sanitation services in \nRawalpindi.  When  the  first  phase  was  completed  in  2003, \nRawalpindi \nfrom \n192,000 cubic meters  per  day  (m3/day)  to  256,000  m3/day,  with \nconsiderable  rehabilitation  and  extension  of  its  water  supply \ndistribution  network.  In  addition,  major  institutional  and  financial \nreforms  were  executed \nImplementation  Agency\u2014\nRawalpindi  Water  and  Sanitation  Agency\u2014and  engineering \n\ndevelopment \n\ninstitutional \n\nincreased \n\nsupplies \n\nfacilities \n\nwater \n\nand \n\nhad \n\nthe \n\n(iii) \n\nfor \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nin  accordance  with \n\nstudies  for  future  development  of  sewerage  and  drainage,  and  a \nsolid waste management plan were prepared. The second phase \n(the  Project)  is  intended  to  implement  these  plans,  focusing  on \nimprovements  to  sewerage  and  drainage,  provision  of  sewage \ntreatment  plant  (STP),  and  solid  waste  management.  The  third \nphase  will  complete  the  overall  requirements  of  Rawalpindi's \nwater  and  sanitation  sector,  including  further  expansion  of  water \nsupply  sources, \nthe  master  plan,  and \nextension of water and sanitation in unserved areas of the city.  \n \nThe  Government  is  implementing  comprehensive  governance \nreforms, with particular emphasis on enhancing the effectiveness \nof  basic  social  services  through  its  program  for  devolution  of \npowers.  The  Project  is  formulated  to  support  the  Government\u2019s \npoverty  reduction  initiatives,  as  well  as  devolution  of  power  and \nresponsibility to local governments for the provision and financing \nof urban infrastructure and municipal services. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  impacts  are  expected  to  be  improvements  in  living \nconditions,  quality  of  life,  and  health  of  the  people  of  Rawalpindi \nby  improving  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities,  solid  waste \nmanagement,  wastewater  treatment,  and  slaughterhouse.  The \noutcome  is  sustainable  reduction  of  environmental  degradation \nand sustainable operation of basic urban services.  \n \nThe  total  estimated  project  cost  is  $85.7  million  equivalent, \ncomprising  foreign  exchange  costs  of  $12.5  million  (14.6%)  and \nlocal currency costs equivalent to $73.2 million (85.4%). \n \n\n \n\nSource \n\n \n\nADB \nPG \nRT/WASA \n \nTotal \n\nFinancing \n($ million) \nLocal \nCurrency \n47.5 \n21.4 \n4.3 \n73.2 \n\nForeign \nExchange \n12.5 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n12.5 \n\nTotal \n\n60.0 \n21.4 \n4.3 \n85.7 \n\n \n\n% \n\n70 \n25 \n5 \n100 \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  PG  =  government  of  Punjab,  RT  =  Rawal \nTown, WASA = Water and Sanitation Agency. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n\nfrom  ADB\u2019s  special \n\nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  two  loans.  A  loan  of  $40  million \nfunds \nequivalent  in  various  currencies \nresources (Asian Development Fund [ADF]). The loan will have a \n32-year term including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate \nof  1%  per  year  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  year \nthereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the \ndraft  loan  agreement.  A  second  loan  of  $20  million  equivalent \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  will  be  provided \nunder  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term  including  a \ngrace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency  \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\nwith ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of \n0.75%  per  annum,  no  front-end  fee,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \nADB  will  provide  the  loan  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan, \nwhich will relend it to the government of Punjab (PG) on the same \nterms and conditions. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by \nthe  PG,  which  will  make  the  loan  proceeds  available  to  City \nDistrict Rawalpindi (CDR) as a grant. \n \nUntil 30 September 2011 \n \n31 March 2011 \n\n \nCity District Rawalpindi \n \nThe  Executing  Agency  (EA)  will  establish  a  project  management \nunit (PMU) headed by the project director located at the Water and \nSanitation  Agency  (WASA).  The  PMU,  comprising  professional \nstaff  supported  by  a  team  of  consultants,  will  assist  CDR,  Rawal \nTown (RT), Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA), and WASA \nin providing policy guidance and implementing project components. \nFor internal  coordination, two committees will be set  up. A project \nimplementation  review  committee\u2014comprising  officials  of  CDR, \nPothar  Town,  RT,  RDA,  WASA,  union  administrations,  and \ncommunity-based  organizations\u2014will  monitor  the  progress  of  all \nproject  components  on  a  quarterly  basis.  A  project  steering \ncommittee  will  be  set  up  in  the  PG  in  Lahore  to  ensure  smooth \nimplementation,  resolve  interagency  problems,  and  provide  policy \nguidance. It will be headed by the chairman of PG\u2019s Planning and \nDevelopment  Board  (P&D),  with  members  comprising  senior \nofficers  from  the  P&D;  Housing,  Urban  Development,  and  Public \nHealth  Engineering  Department  (HUD&PHED);  and \nfinance \ndepartment  of  PG;  as  well  as  RDA,  WASA,  and  CDR  and  RT \nheads (nazims). It will meet at least once every 6 months. \n \nAll  procurement  services  for  the  Project  will  follow  ADB's \nGuidelines  for  Procurement  and  the  Government\u2019s  rules  and \nregulations. Contracts for civil works estimated to cost more than \n$5 million equivalent will be issued using international competitive \nbidding  (ICB)  procedures.  Contracts  estimated  to  cost  $5  million \nequivalent  or  less  will  be  carried  out  through  local  competitive \nbidding  (LCB)  procedures.  Minor  development  and  maintenance \nmay  be  carried  out  on  a  force  account  basis.  Procurement  of \ngoods  will  preferably  be  grouped  into  packages  larger  than \n$500,000 to be suitable for ICB procedures. Miscellaneous minor \ngoods  that  cannot  be  grouped  into  larger  contracts,  and  are \nestimated  to  cost  less  than  $500,000  per  contract,  will  be \nprocured  through  international  shopping  (IS)  procedures.  Minor \nitems  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $100,000  equivalent  per \n\n\f \n\nv\n\ncontract  may  be  purchased  directly,  following  proper  procedures \nto ensure economy, efficiency, and quality. \n \nAn  input  of  1,334  person-months  of  consulting  services  is \nplanned,  consisting  of  18  international  and  1,316  domestic \nperson-months,  all  under  two  packages.  Package  A  will  be  for \nproject  management  and  implementation  support  to  the  PMU, \nincluding  subproject  detailed  design,  construction  supervision, \nand monitoring and evaluation. Package B will be for institutional \ndevelopment.  In  addition,  local  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs) and social mobilizing teams (Package C) will be engaged \nfor  community  development  and  participation  (144  person-\nmonths). \n \nPackages  A  and  B  will  be  procured  from  domestic  consulting \nfirms.  Package  C  will  be  procured  on  an  individual  basis  and  by \ncontracting local NGOs. Consultants for Package A and B will be \nselected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  the  quality-  and  cost-\nbased  selection  method  of  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  or  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  Whereas,  consultants  for \nPackage C will be selected either as individual consultants or as \nfirm.  In  the  case  of  a  firm,  it  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in \naccordance with the quality-based selection method.  \n \n\nimproving \n\nThe  Project  will  improve  the  living  conditions  of  about  1.4  million \nresidents  of  Rawalpindi  city  by  enhancing  the  quality  of  life  and \nhealth, \nthe  environment,  and  creating  conditions \nconducive to sustained urban development and economic growth. \nIt  will  contribute  to  reduction  of  mortality,  morbidity,  and  poverty, \nand  mitigate \nloss  of  amenity  caused  by  environmental \ndegradation  in  the  city,  especially  among  slum  inhabitants  and \npoor  groups  (particularly  women  and  children).  The  Project  will \nsupport  improvements  to  RT  and  WASA  capacity  by  improving \ntheir \nfinancial  and  operational  management  and  planning, \nincluding local resource generation. The financial internal rates of \nreturn (FIRRs) for the components are estimated as follows: solid \nwaste  (7.3%),  sewerage  and  stormwater  drainage  (2.7%),  and \nwater supply (6.2%). The overall project economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) is estimated at 15.8%. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nAcquisition  of  required  land  may  be  delayed  or  not  be \nforthcoming, which could delay or impede implementation \nof some subprojects. \nFrequent  turnover  of  trained  staff  and  delayed  decision \nmaking  on  critical  issues  by  CDR,  WASA,  and  RDA  may \njeopardize project benefits. \nthe \nFuture \ncomprehensiveness  and  consistency  of  the  Punjab  Local \n(PLGO),  2001,  which  could \nGovernment  Ordinance \n\nlegislation \n\ngradually \n\nerode \n\ncould \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions  Major risks associated with the Project include the following. \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nseriously impede the CDR\u2019s effectiveness as a main actor \nin project implementation. \n\n \n(iv) \n\nImplementation  of \nthe  agreed  Government  Policy \n(Appendix 2) may be delayed and efforts for enhancement \nof  the  revenue  base  and  institutional  strengthening  of  RT \nand  WASA  may  not  give  sufficient  sustainable  results. \nThis  could  affect  project  implementation  or  the  long-term \nsustainability of improvements, or both. \n\n \nCDR will initiate the land acquisition process before loan approval \nto  avoid  implementation  delays.  Close  monitoring  and  early \nflagging  for  action  by  the  project  implementation  review  and \nsteering  committees  will  minimize  the  risk  of  delayed  decision \nmaking.  Considering  lessons  learned  from  phase  1,  the  PG  has \nprovided a firm commitment to minimize staff turnover and recruit \nqualified  staff  for  PMU,  WASA,  and  RT.  Strict  attention  to  timely \nproject  progress  reporting,  including  staffing  and  accounting,  will \nalso  help.  Devolution  is  one  of  the  Government's  particular \ncommitments  to  reform,  particularly  capacity  building  of  RT  and \nWASA.  The  Project  is  a  timely  contribution  to  the  devolution \nprocess.  The  risk  of  delays  in  implementing  the  Government \nPolicy will be minimized by a water audit that will lead to updating \nthe  Government  Policy,  and  its  monitoring  by  a  civil  society  task \nforce.  \n\n \n\n\f35 00'No\n\nAFGHANISTAN\n\nto\n\nP\n\nesh\na\n\nw\n\nar\n\nRawal Lake\n\n64 00'Eo\n\n73 00'Eo\n\nN O R T H - W E S T\nF R O N T I E R\n\nTarbela\nISLAMABAD\n\n35 00'No\n\nPeshawar\n\nMangla\n\nRawalpindi\ne l u m\nJ\nSargodha\n\nR .\n\nR.\ns\nu\nd\nIn\n\nh\n\nJhelum\n\nC hen a b R.\na vi R .\n\nLahore\n\nP U N J A B\n\nD.I.

About 40% of its 2.2 million inhabitants are in \nthe  low-income  group.  Like  other  urban  areas  in  Pakistan,  high  urban  growth  (4%  per  year)  has \nresulted in uncontrolled urban sprawl, deteriorated urban environments, and deficiencies in the city\u2019s \nurban services. Lack of sanitation facilities (mainly sewerage, sewage treatment, drainage, and solid \nwaste  collection  and  disposal)  has  caused  serious  environmental  problems,  particularly  to  drinking \nwater quality, due to pollution of surface and groundwater sources. Water quality analyses performed \nin  20021  show  that  over  85%  of  water  samples  analyzed  for  physical,  chemical,  and  bacteriological \nparameters  were  unsafe  for  human  consumption  due  to  bacterial  contamination.  A  2003  study2 \nindicates  that  typhoid,  hepatitis,  and  other  gastrointestinal  water-related  diseases  have  reached  an \nalarming level and hospitals are continuously registering more patients. This situation has particularly \naffected  the  urban  poor  and  caused  a  considerably  lower  quality  of  life,  including  poor  health  and \nincreased poverty. The incidence of poverty in Pakistan has increased from 20.0% to 32.1% over the \npast 15 years. Unemployment was 9.7% in urban areas and 7.7% nationwide during FY2004.3 \n \nThe poverty reduction strategy of the Government of Pakistan4 (the Government) envisages a \n3. \nmultipronged strategy of reviving growth, improving governance, reorienting public expenditure toward \npoverty-reducing programs, and revamping the social security system. The Government is committed \nto  increasing  pro-poor budgetary  expenditure  by  0.2%  of gross  domestic product  (GDP)  per  year  to \n4% of GDP in FY2004.5 The Government is implementing comprehensive governance reforms, with \nparticular emphasis on enhancing the effectiveness of basic social services through its Punjab Local \nGovernment  Ordinance  (PLGO),  2001.  The  government  of  Punjab\u2019s  (PG\u2019s)  poverty  reduction \nstrategy6  also  emphasizes  the  need  to  implement  broad-based  governance  reforms  and  improve \nsocial services to address poverty.  \n \n4. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a loan of $72 million in 1993 for the Rawalpindi \nUrban Water Supply and Sanitation Project,7 as the first phase of a proposed three-phase project for \nimproving  water  and  sanitation  services  in  Rawalpindi.  Upon  completion  of  the  first  phase  in  2003, \nRawalpindi  had  increased  water  supplies  from  192,000  cubic  meters  per  day  (m3/day)  to \n256,000 m3/day, with considerable rehabilitation and extension of its water supply distribution network. \nIn  addition,  major  institutional  and  financial  reforms  were  executed  for  the  Implementing  Agency\u2014\nRawalpindi Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA)\u2014and engineering studies for future development of \nsewerage and drainage and a solid waste management plan were prepared. The second phase (the \nProject) is intended to implement these plans, focusing on improvements to sewerage and drainage, \nprovision  of  a  sewage  treatment  plant  (STP),  and  solid  waste  management.  The  third  phase  will \ncomplete  the  overall  requirements  of  Rawalpindi's  water  and  sanitation  sector,  including  further \naugmentation of water supply sources in accordance with the master plan and extension of water and \nsanitation in unserved areas of the city.  \n\n                                                 \n1   Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources. 2002. \n2   Institute of Public Health and National Institute of Health. 2003.

Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the  Islamic \n\nRepublic of Pakistan for the Rawalpindi Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Project. Manila. \n\n\f 2 \n\nThis  document  is  based  on  consultants\u2019  feasibility  reports  prepared  during  an  ADB-financed \n5. \ntechnical assistance (TA) project,8\n and \nboth federal and provincial governments, and extensive consultations with elected town officials and \nbeneficiaries  representing  all  community  groups,  including  women.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nA. \n\n understandings reached between the Loan Appraisal Mission9\n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n6. \nIn  accordance  with  PLGO  2001,  responsibility  for  delivery  of  municipal  urban  services  and \nenvironmental improvement rests mainly with tehsil10 municipal administrations (TMAs)/towns. Union \nAdministrations (UAs), the lowest level of local government, are in charge of community development \nand  related  tasks.  The  district  government,  a  level  above  TMAs/towns,  handles  affairs  related  to \ngovernment  land  as  well  as  the  health  and  education  sectors.  Implementation  of  PLGO  2001  has \nconsiderably  reduced  the  previously  dominating  roles  of  provincial  agencies.  Special  development \nauthorities  have  been  set  up  for  major  cities  in  Punjab,  including  Rawalpindi,  through  the \nDevelopment of Cities Act, 1976, and district governments have been designated city governments.11 \nTMAs/towns are supervised by the provincial Local Government and Rural Development Department \n(LG)  which  supports  and  monitors  progress  in  the  implementation  of  PLGO  2001,  including  all \nrequired adjustments and improvements in institutional and organizational setups as well as financial \nmanagement.  Within  LG,  the  Directorate  General  of  Katchi  Abadi  and  Urban  Improvement  has \nresponsibility for resolving problems related to katchi abadis.12 Rawalpindi has a mixed and conflicting \nland use pattern, with residential, commercial,  and industrial uses. Urbanization has caused several \nslum  areas to  emerge  in  the  city.  At  present,  there  are  about  24  identified  slums,  including  6 katchi \nabadis, of which 3 have been regularized. \n \n7. \nPiped water supply coverage in the city increased from 35% to 46% of the population following \nimplementation  of  the  phase  1  project,  which  addressed  urgent  needs  by  expanding  water  supply \nsources and extending and rehabilitating distribution networks. There are about 76,000 registered and \nan  estimated  15,000  unregistered  water  supply  connections.  Commercial  consumers  account  for \nanother 5,500 connections. Total water production (including groundwater and surface water) is about \n163 million  liters  per  day  (mld).  The  city  relies  to  a  large  extent  on  groundwater.  The  number  of \ntubewells  increased  from  33  in  1980  to  209  in  2005.  Persistent  drought  during  2001\u20132004  and \nexcessive  withdrawal  of  groundwater  have  caused  the  water  table  to  drop  to  an  alarming  level  with \nconsequent reduction in the quantity and quality of water. Unserved households that can afford tanker \nwater  have  to  pay  about  PRs1,800  ($31)  per  month  whereas  those  on  piped  WASA  water  pay  on \naverage  only  PRs40  ($0.7)  per  month.  All  other  unserved  settlements  have  to  rely  on  unsafe  water \nsources.  The  City  District  Rawalpindi  (CDR)  needs  to  urgently  strengthen  water  management  with \nsound water and sanitation policy and objectives, including: (i) long-term planning and development of \nwater resources for water supply purposes; (ii) piped water supply services and adequate sanitation \nfor all Rawalpindi inhabitants, maintained in a sustainable manner through sound financial and human \nresources  management;  (iii) water  conservation  aimed  at  metered  water  supply  services  for  all \nconsumers and consumption-based billing; (iv) sustainable use of groundwater; and (v) safeguarding \nwater quality. \n \n8. \nThe  existing  sewerage  system  only  covers  about  30%  of  the  city  area  but  has  no  sewage \ntreatment.  In  the  remaining  70%  of  the  city,  raw  sewage  is  discharged  to  street-side  drains  which \nultimately  discharge  into  the  Lai  Nullah,  the  main  drain  passing  through  the  city.  Lack  of  a  proper \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Rawalpindi Environmental Improvement Project. \n\nManila. \n\n9  The Loan Appraisal Mission was fielded 6\u201316 September 2005. \n10 A tehsil is a local government unit under a corporate municipal administration.  \n11 On  24  June  2005,  PG  declared  eight  tehsils  of  Rawalpindi  district  as  a  city  district  to  be  called  City  District  Rawalpindi \n\n(CDR). Rawal Town is one of the towns of CDR, which includes Rawalpindi City.   \n\n12 A  katchi  abadi  is  an  unauthorized  settlement  on  state-owned  land  of  more  than  40  dwellings,  without  land  rights  or \n\nphysical and social infrastructure services and facilities.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\nsewerage  network,  sewage  disposal,  and  treatment  have  worsened  conditions,  especially  for  poor \npeople  living  in  low-lying  areas.  Heavy  rains  cause  extensive  local  flooding  and  storm  water  mixes \nwith raw sewage, spreading contamination throughout the neighborhood while low-lying areas remain \nflooded for a long time. Most of the existing drains in the city have been encroached upon, which has \nfurther  deteriorated  the  situation.  The  storm  water  channels  carrying  the  untreated  sewage  of \nIslamabad  and  Rawalpindi  are  virtually  sludge  carriers  that  ultimately  discharge  into  nearby  Soan \nRiver,  affecting  aquatic  life  and  agriculture.  All  these  factors  have  seriously  affected  drinking  water \nquality:  (i)  open  water  storage  reservoirs  are  being  contaminated  with  the  discharge  of  uncontrolled \nand  untreated  sewage;  (ii)  defective,  old,  leaking  water  pipelines  that  run  alongside  the  sewerage \nsystem  receive  sewage  at  leaking  points;  (iii)  groundwater  sources  become  contaminated  by \npercolation of sewage because of the inadequate sewerage system; and (iv) discharge of untreated \nsewage from Islamabad in Lai Nullah has contaminated all the tubewells located along this drain. \n \nSolid  waste  is  managed  by  Rawal  Town  (RT),  which  is  suffering  from  numerous  operational \n9. \nand  financial  problems.  Only  60%  of  the  waste  generated  is  collected  and  disposed  of,  and  the \nexisting landfill site has ended its useful life. The sanitary tax paid to the TMA for solid waste disposal \nis about PRs20 ($0.33) per month and its collection efficiency is low. There are two slaughterhouses \nin  Rawalpindi  where  up  to  2,000  cattle  are  slaughtered  daily.  However,  there  is  no  adequate \narrangement for the disposal of animal waste, which causes serious environmental hazards.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities  \n\nPLGO  became  effective  in  2001  but  much  remains  to  be  done  in  terms of  strengthening  the \n10. \ncapacity of LG agencies, clarifying roles and responsibilities, realigning the relationship between the \nprovincial government and LG, and ensuring increased and predictable funding to LG to meet social \nservices needs. While LG is now responsible for the delivery and management of social services, its \nadministrative and financial authorities are not capable of the assigned responsibility. The PG has a \ncritical role in providing an enabling environment for the LGs to improve their functional, financial, and \nmanagerial  autonomy,  in  line  with  the  PLGO,  to  empower  LGs  to  improve  social  services.  The \nproposed  Project  will  (i)  collaborate  with  the  Decentralization  Support  Program,13  Punjab  Resource \nManagement Program,14 and the Punjab Devolved Social Services Project;15 and (ii) enhance CDR\u2019s \nskills  in  rationalization  and  planning  of  social  services.  It  is  essential  to  institutionalize  the  overall \nworking of CDR to make its monitoring system more effective, transparent, and accountable. \n \nSome  major  financial  and  institutional  reforms  to  enhance  institutional  efficiencies  were \n11. \nimplemented  in  WASA  under  the  phase  I  project.  As  a  result,  financial  management  improved \nsubstantially  and  WASA  started  generating  more  revenues  than  expenditures  in  1999.  However, \nprogress  towards  WASA\u2019s  self-sustainability  could  not  be  maintained  because  the  top  management \nwas changed frequently; turnover of trained staff was high; inexperienced and less qualified staff were \nappointed;  and,  above  all,  the  Government  failed  to  follow  up  on  WASA\u2019s  sustained  operations. \nConsidering  the  potential  for  improvement,  important  policy  actions  (Appendix  2)  have  been  agreed \nwith  the  PG  to  address  the  problems  outlined  above  and  pursue  sustainable  urban  services  from  a \nstrengthened WASA and RT.  \n \n12. \nThe  Government\u2019s  policy  of  decentralization  and  devolution  is  critical  to  developing  greater \nlocal  responsibility.  Efficient  and  cost-effective  community  services  cannot  be  provided  until: \n(i) communities are involved in all phases of project design, execution, and post-implementation; and \n(ii)  accountability  and  management  are  improved  at  each  level  of  local  government  operations.  The \nmobilization of local resources and improved management of existing infrastructure and services are \n                                                 \n13 ADB.  2002.

Manila (Loans 2144 and 2145-PAK). \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\nnecessary  to  achieve  these  objectives.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  support  these  objectives \nthrough the Project by: (i) strengthening the managerial, financial, and technical capacity of the CDR \nby  delegating  more  responsibility  and  upgrading  staff  capacities;  (ii)  providing  adequate  staff, \nequipment, and procedures to enable RT and WASA to increase resource mobilization and improve \nmanagement  and  delivery  of  existing  urban  infrastructure  and  services;  and  (iii)  providing  a  training \nprogram to increase the managerial proficiency of their staff. The Government has committed itself to \ngreater  continuity  in  the  appointment  of  key  professional  and  administrative  staff  in  these \norganizations.  \n \nAt the start of the proposed Project, a comprehensive water audit will be undertaken which will \n13. \nexamine the consumption and cost of water from the perspective of various water suppliers (WASA, \nsmall-scale  water  providers,  water  vendors,  and  bottled  water  suppliers)  and  water  users.  This  is \nexpected  to  provide  new  information  on  service  coverage,  the  main  source  of  water  revenues,  and \nuse  of  non-revenue  water  (NRW).  The  results  of  the  audit  will  be  analyzed  and  discussed  in \nconsultation  with  stakeholders,  and  will  form  the  basis  of  new  government  policy  on  water  supply \nservices,  which  is  expected  to  deal  with  the  following:  (i)  rate  of  increase  in  new  connections, \n(ii) targeting of services for the urban poor, (iii) tariffs and the elimination of flat rate tariffs, (iv) billing \ncollection, (v) metering of all services, (vi) groundwater management, (vii) organization development, \n(viii)  NRW  measurement  and  reduction,  (ix)  water  conservation,  and  (x)  community  awareness  and \ncommunity development. Appendix 2 summarizes the policy actions agreed with the PG.  \n \nThe Government is concerned about the low levels of social services and believes that greater \n14. \ninvestment  will  accelerate  productivity  gains,  reduce  poverty,  and  promote  smaller,  healthier,  and \nbetter-educated  families.  Pakistan\u2019s  national  urban  and  housing  policy  is  reflected  in  the  10-Year \nPerspective  Development  Plan  (PDP),  2001\u20132011,  which  describes  the  main  urban  problems  as: \n(i) environmental degradation and breakdown of infrastructure and municipal services; and (ii) lack of \nvision,  inadequate  institutional  setups,  and  weak  financial  base.  Improvements  will  start  with  the \nfollowing: (i) strengthening CDR\u2019s role in planning, determining actual needs, preparing action plans, \nand enhancing capabilities for water supply and sanitation services; (ii) preparing or updating master \nplans;  and  (iii) for  water  supply  and  sanitation,  PDP  envisages  that  an  additional  55 million  people \n(28 million rural and 27 million urban) will be provided with water supply services, increasing national \nservice  coverage  from  63%  to  84%,  and  another  54 million  people  (26 million  rural  and  28 million \nurban)  will  benefit  from  sanitation  facilities,  increasing  national  service  coverage  from  39%  to  63%. \nPrivate sector participation in environmental sanitation and water supply will be encouraged and the \ninstitutional  capacity  of  service  providers  will  be  upgraded.  In  line  with  the  goals  of  the  national \npoverty  reduction  strategy  (PRS),  the  Punjab  PRS  emphasizes  restoration  of  good  governance, \nenhancement  of  public  expenditure,  improvement  in  service  delivery  for  social  sectors,  and \naddressing environmental concerns, among key factors to reduce poverty in Punjab. An urban sector \nanalysis for Pakistan is in Appendix 3. \n \n15. \nThe proposed Project is formulated to support the Government\u2019s poverty reduction initiatives, \nas  well  as  devolution  of  power  and  responsibility  to  local  governments  for  providing  and  financing \nenvironmental  sanitation,  water  supply  services,  and  environmental  support  services.  The  Project \nincorporates  several  strategic  features  and  incentives  for  participation,  including:  (i)  promotion  of \npolicy reforms in accordance with PLGO 2001; (ii) financial management and resource generation at \nthe levels of the TMA, UA, and WASA; (iii) priority for investments that meet the basic needs of urban \ncommunities;  (iv)  community  participation  and  ownership;  and  (v)  equity  participation  by  UAs  in \ninvestment packages. \n \nADB  Strategy.  The  focus  of  ADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  (2006\u20132008)  for \n16. \nPakistan  is  on  reducing  poverty  by  providing  help  in  the  key  strategic  areas  of  good  governance, \nsustainable  pro-poor  economic  growth,  and  inclusive  social  development.  ADB  lending  to  devolved \nsectors will aim to strengthen devolution by ensuring that future ADB projects are consistent with the \nnew  governance  structure  under  PLGO  2001.  Where  appropriate,  efforts  will  be  made  to  realign \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\nrecently  approved  ADB  projects  for  devolved  sectors.  ADB\u2019s  emphasis  will  remain  on  improving \ndelivery  of  social  services,  which  support  increased  public  sector  allocations  and  improved \ngovernance through devolution, sector administration, and financial management. ADB\u2019s water policy \nalso  supports  ADB\u2019s  strategy  for  poverty  reduction  by  addressing  each  of  the  three  framework \nelements  of  poverty  reduction:  pro-poor  sustainable  growth,  social  development,  and  good \ngovernance. The main focus of ADB assistance to the urban sector will be on environmental aspects \nand needs of the poor, and will broadly cover: (i) institutional restructuring and devolution of service \ndelivery; (ii) private sector involvement in the delivery of selected services; (iii) budgeting and finance, \nand  increased  cost  recovery  and  municipal  revenue;  (iv)  increased  community  participation;  and \n(v) attainment  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  The  Project  will  develop  linkages  with \nstrategies by forums such as the Global Water Partnership, World Water Council, and Water Supply \nand Sanitation Collaborative Council, to facilitate achievement of the vision, goals, and targets set in \nthe MDGs. \n \n17. \nExternal  Assistance  to  the  Sector.  ADB  has  provided  eight  loans,  totaling  about \n$450 million,  since  beginning  assistance  to  Pakistan\u2019s  urban  sector  in  1976  (including  loans  for  the \nwater supply, sanitation, and urban development sectors). Another $7.1 million was provided for TA \nprojects in water supply, sanitation, and urban development. So far, ADB projects in Pakistan\u2019s urban \nsector  have  focused  on  Sindh,  North-West  Frontier,  and  Punjab  provinces.  Japan  has  provided  the \nlargest  external  support  to  the  urban  sector,  and  the  World  Bank  has  given  the  second  largest \namount.  Both  donors  mainly  focused  on  Sindh  and  Punjab  provinces.  Other  bilateral  assistance  is \nprovided  by  the  governments  of  Germany,  Kuwait,  Netherlands,  Switzerland,  and  United  Kingdom. \nThe  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  along  with  United  Nations  International \nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), and World Health Organization (WHO), have provided assistance, mostly \nin community water supply and low-cost sanitation projects. Further details are in Appendix 4. \n \n18. \n\nLessons Learned. The key lessons learned from the phase 1 project are as follows: \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nProject  administration.  Implementation  delays  can  be  avoided  by:  (a)  streamlining \nlengthy administrative procedures for approval of selection of consultants; (b) avoiding \nfrequent turnover of the project director and qualified project management unit (PMU) \nstaff;  (c)  strengthening  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  and  holding  regular \nsteering committee meetings to take timely action on issues hindering implementation \nprogress; (d) improving consultants\u2019 performance to efficiently process and implement \nthe  subprojects;  (e)  making  timely  payments  to  contractors  and  consultants;  and \n(f) devolving decision making of noncritical issues to the appropriate lowest level.  \nInstitutional  aspects.  Efficient  municipal  urban  services  require  the  following: \n(a) continuity of policy\u2014management and senior operating staff are critical to maintain \ndirection  and  achieve  required  goals;  (b)  qualified  PMU  management  and  staff; \n(c) appointment  of  regular  EA  staff  in  PMU  instead  of  contract  staff  to  achieve \nsustainable  institutional  reforms;  (d)  autonomy  of  WASA\u2014for  setting  water  tariffs  to \nmeet  its  financial  needs,  engaging  staff  as  necessary  to  operate  and  maintain  the \nit \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  system \nindependent  of  budgetary  support  from  the  PG;  and  (e)  consistent  monitoring  of \ndevelopment impacts by the Government to achieve sustainability of the implemented \nreforms. \n\nto  acceptable  standards,  and  making \n\n \n19. \nKey  lessons  learned  from  other  ADB-financed  projects  for  water  supply  and  sanitation  and \nurban  development  in  Pakistan,  as well  as  a  review  of  multilateral  and  bilateral  projects  in  Pakistan \nand the region, are summarized below. \n\n(i) \n\nProject  accountability  and  transparency  are  undermined  by  failure  to  comply  with \nspecific  covenants,  delays \nin  recruitment  of  consultants,  minimal  beneficiary \nparticipation,  poor  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  completed  facilities,  low \nfinancial and economic rates of return, and frequent changes in senior management. \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe  quality  of  governance  is  critical  to  a  project\u2019s  success.  Highly  centralized  project \nmanagement  adversely  affects  project  performance  and  ownership  by  major \nstakeholders. \nAll  stakeholders  should  be  fully  involved  in  project  identification  and  design  from  an \nearly  stage,  and  sufficient  information  should  be  gathered  regarding  the  active \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  community-based  organizations  (CBOs)  in \nthe project area to facilitate their involvement.16 \nCommunity  participation  requires  intensive  interaction  among  the  project  team, \nparticipating community, and local authorities, and project must be relevant to service \nneeds. \n\n(v)  Women  should  be  empowered  to  participate  in  decision  making  at  the  micro  level  to \n\nbring about constructive changes in the living conditions of the urban poor. \nInstitutional  strengthening  should  be  given  the  greatest  emphasis  and  carried  out \nsystematically. \n\n(vii)  Delays  in  start-up  implementation  should  be  avoided  by  taking  advance  procurement \n\nactions.  \n\n \nA  main  lesson  learned  from  the  Karachi  Sewerage  Project17  is  that  the  sustainability  of \n20. \nsewerage  projects  can  only  be  assured  if  the  utility  is  in  good  financial  health.  Important  lessons \nlearned  from  the  District  Towns  Water  Supply18  in  Bangladesh  and  Second  Water  Supply  and \nSanitation  Project19  in  Bangladesh  emphasized:  (i)  a  need  for  greater  involvement  of  pourashava \n(municipality)  and  community  in  implementing  environmental  sanitation  programs,  (ii)  training  for \npourashava  personnel,  and  (iii)  monitoring  of  the  implementation  performance  of  the  EA  and \npourashava.  An  important  lesson  learned  from  the  Karnataka  Urban  Development  and  Coastal \nEnvironmental  Management  Project20  in  India,  which  ADB  started  financing  in  early  1996,  is  that \nwomen  should  be  empowered  to  participate  in  decision  making  at  the  micro  level  to  bring  about \nconstructive changes in the living conditions of the urban poor. Furthermore, people\u2019s perceptions of, \nand  attitudes  toward,  sanitation  must  be  changed  because  public  awareness  and  community \nparticipation are critical in any sanitation improvement program. Appendix 5 summarizes the lessons \nlearned and measures taken to incorporate these lessons into the proposed Project. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n21. \nThe expected impacts of the Project are improvements in living conditions, quality of life, and \nhealth  of  the  people  of  Rawalpindi  by  improving  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities,  solid  waste \nmanagement,  wastewater  treatment,  and  slaughterhouse.  The  Project  will  result  in  sustainable \nreduction of environmental degradation and ensure sustainable operation of basic urban services. \n \n22. \nThe  operational  area  of  RT  and  WASA  covers  the  inner  city  area,  over  50  newly  developed \ncolonies,  and  low-income  slums.  During  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA),  low-\nincome  areas  were  identified  by  undertaking  the  following:  (i)  extensive  socioeconomic  surveys  to \nassess  the  status  of  urban  service  coverage,  the  need  and  demand  for  services,  assessment  of \nhousehold  incomes,  and  willingness  to  pay  for  services;  (ii)  participatory  analysis  and  planning  with \nhouseholds  (especially  women\u2019s  groups)  which  produced  knowledge  on  the  impact  of  poverty  and \n\n                                                 \n16  ADB. 2003.

The proposals for \nimproving  the  urban  environment  and  extending  coverage  of  urban  services  were  developed  based \non  the  above,  using  lessons  learned  in  the  phase  1  project  and  other  externally  funded  projects \n(Appendix 5).  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n23. \nThe Project will comprise the following main components: (i) part A\u2014environmental sanitation; \n(ii)  part  B\u2014water  supply  services;  and  (iii)  part  C\u2014institutional  development,  including  municipal \nmanagement  system  development,  environmental  support  services,  asset  management,  urban \ndevelopment, project implementation assistance, and incremental administration support. The project \ncomponents are described below. \n \n\n1. \n\nPart A. Environmental Sanitation \n\na. \n\nSewerage System \n\n24. \nOnly 30% of Rawalpindi City is covered by the  sewerage system, which was laid in Satellite \nTown  in  the  1950s  and  Khayaban-e-Sirsyed  in  1969.  Inappropriate  subdivision  of  urban  lots, \nincreasing  population  density,  and  corrosion  and  deterioration  of  pipes  and  seals  have  caused  the \nnetwork  pipes  to  leak  continuously.  The  Project  will  install  major  sewerage  networks  which  include:  \n(i)  laying  about  (a)  160  kilometers  (km)  of  sewerage  network  (trunk  and  area  sewers)  within  the \nboundary  limits  of  RT over  384  hectares  (ha)  to  benefit  a population  of  190,000,  and  (b)  secondary \nand  lateral  sewers  in  the  catchment  of  existing  trunk  sewers  in  sewerage  (SW)  02  and  SW03;  \n(ii)  construction  of  a  transfer/outfall  sewer  to  the  STP;  (iii)  replacement  of  undersized  sewers  in \nidentified  areas;  (iv) environmental  mitigation  works  upstream  of  Rawal  Lake  filtration  plant;  and \n(v) procurement of sewer cleaning equipment and machinery. \n \n\nb. \n\nSewage Treatment Plant \n\nThe  STP  will  treat  sewage  from  Rawalpindi  and  suburban  areas,  which  will  be  received \n25. \nthrough  a  24.5  km  box  conduit  along  the  Lai  Nullah  and  Soan  River.  Waste  will  be  treated  in \nstabilization  ponds.  The  quantity  of  sewage  from  the  city  and  suburban  areas  (with  about \n1.4 million inhabitants)  is  141,000  cubic  meters  per  day  (m3/day)  and  is  expected  to  increase  to \n272,000  m3/day  by  2025.  The  STP  will  be  designed  for  projected  demand  in  2025  but  plant \nconstruction in this phase will be for 2015, with a projected flow of 199,000 m3/day. Treated effluent \nwill  be  disposed  of  in  the  Soan  River.  The  effluent  must  comply  with  Pakistan\u2019s  National \nEnvironmental Quality Standards. About 250 ha will be required for the plant. Components will include \ninlet  and  outlet  structures,  forestation,  laboratory,  administration  buildings,  and  protection  bunds \nagainst the Soan River. The conceptual design and layout have been prepared for 4 meter (m) deep \nanaerobic ponds, 2.5 m deep facultative ponds, and 1.5 m deep maturation ponds.  \n \n\nc. \n\nStormwater Drainage  \n\n26. \nThe stormwater draining component includes: (i) remodeling existing drains and construction \nof  new  drains  at  selected  areas  such  as  Asghar  Mall  Road,  Jamia  Masjid  Road,  the  general  bus \nstand,  Nia  Mohallah,  and  Eidgah  Road;  and  (ii)  carrying  out  (a)  bank  protection  works  at  critical \nlocations of Lai Nullah to mitigate negative impacts from floods, and (b) the necessary works for the \nprotection of the rights-of-way of Lai Nullah. \n \n\nd. \n\nSolid Waste Management \n\n27. \nA public\u2013private partnership program has been proposed to: (i) improve solid waste collection, \ntransportation,  and  disposal;  and  (ii)  augment  RT\u2019s  capacity.  This  is  an  innovative  approach  that \nmeets  the  Government\u2019s  decentralization  and  devolution  goals.  UAs,  with  the  help  of  experienced \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\nNGOs  and  private  partners,  will  collect  solid  waste  in  their  constituencies  and  dispose  of  it  at \ndesignated transfer stations. RT, with the assistance of private agencies, will be responsible for final \ndisposal of solid waste at the landfill. This component will consist of: (i) institutional strengthening of \nRT; (ii) procurement of vehicles and equipment; (iii) construction of solid waste transfer stations and \nprovision  of  garbage  bins  throughout  the  city;  (iv)  development  of  a  new  lined  uncovered  sanitary \nlandfill  site  with  a  leachate  collection  system  in  Mouza  Losar,  30  km  east  of  Rawalpindi; \n(v) preparation and implementation of a community participation program; (vi) establishment of a solid \nwaste  recycling  and  composting  program;  (vii)  development  of  licensing  and  institutionalizing  of \nscavengers;  and  (viii)  privatization  of  solid  waste  management  systems.  The  30  ha  landfill  site  will \nreplace  the  temporary  landfill  site  near  central  Rawalpindi.  The  new  landfill  site  is  expected  to  fulfill \nsolid waste management requirements until 2010\u20132011. Solid waste segregation is to be carried out \nat the community level. Bins and other adequate facilities will be provided for this purpose.  \n \n\ne. \n\nSlaughterhouse and Public Toilets \n\n28. \nTwo slaughterhouses currently exist in Rawalpindi. The goat slaughterhouse in the city center \nis old, and its sewerage and drainage facilities are inadequate. Waste from this slaughterhouse poses \na  health  hazard  and  disturbs  adjoining  areas.  The  other  slaughterhouse  at  Sihala,  in  an  industrial \nestate  outside  Rawalpindi,  is  jointly  operated  by  Rawalpindi  Cantonment  Board  (RCB),  Capital \nDevelopment  Authority,  and  RT.  The  Project  proposes  to  build  additional  hygienic,  environmentally \nacceptable slaughterhouse facilities on the premises of the existing Sihala slaughterhouse. This would \nprovide a cost-effective solution with no land acquisition costs. \n \n29. \nRawalpindi  has  very  few  public  toilets,  which  are  in  poor  conditions  because  of  inadequate \nO&M. The Project will construct about 15 properly designed, suitably located public toilets connected \nto  the  nearby  sewer  network\u2014near  shopping  centers,  bus  stops,  and  densely  populated  areas. \nRegular water supply will be enhanced through overhead tanks. O&M of the toilets will be undertaken \nby  the  private  sector  and  revenues  collected  through  user  fees,  following  the  example  of  similar \nsuccessful programs in the region.21 \n \n\n2. \n\nPart B. Improving Water Supply \n\n30. \nThis  component  will  improve  the  service  and  quality  of  existing  water  distribution  systems.  \nIt will increase revenues by updating consumer databases, converting illegal connections to registered \naccounts,  detecting  and  repairing  leaks,  and  monitoring  water  quality.  Distribution  systems  will  be \nextended  or  rehabilitated  for  poorly  served  low-income  communities  with  scarce  or  brackish \ngroundwater. This component will include: (i) replacement of about 29 contaminated and/or inefficient \ntubewells  and  rehabilitation  of  32  existing  tubewells;  and  (ii)  construction  or  rehabilitation  of \ndistribution systems, including the rehabilitation of storage reservoirs and the supply and installation of \n50,000 water meters. It will also include a water quality and monitoring program to be conducted by \nWASA and the private sector, review and finalization of Rawalpindi master plan for water supply, and \nfeasibility studies of additional water supply sources as part of the respective master plan. Under this \ncomponent,  the  agreed  PG  policy  for  water  supply  (Appendix  2)  will  be  implemented  and  updated \nfollowing the water audit to be undertaken within a year of loan effectiveness. A comprehensive water \naudit will verify coverage, service level, status of actual payment of water dues and use of NRW, and \nexamine people\u2019s access to water. \n \n31. \nAs  a  priority,  all  schools  in  the  project  area  will  be  provided  latrines  and  safe  drinking  water \nconnections.  Health  and  hygiene  education  will  be  promoted.  The  Project  will  monitor  the  effects  of \nimprovements  in  water  quality  on  health,  especially  child  stunting,  by  organizing  a  representative \nsample study and project performance management system (PPMS). \n \n                                                 \n21  Good  examples  are  the  Sulabh  (privately  financed)  and  Pune  (publicly  financed)  public  pay  toilets  in  India;  the  ongoing \nsuccessful experience in Karachi through the Citizen Police Liaison Committee; TMA toilets (public\u2013private partnership); \nand a similar program that was initiated in Lahore in 2003 by the Lahore Horticulture Department. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\n3. \n\nPart C. Institutional Development \n\na. \n\nMunicipal Management System Development \n\nthe \n\nPlanned \n\ninterventions  under \n\ninstitutional  development  subcomponent  will \n\n32. \ninclude  \n(i)  training  in  technical  and  financial  management  for  RT  and  WASA  staff,  including  mapping  and \nasset  management;  (ii)  increasing  public  awareness  on  urban  issues, water  quality,  sustainability  of \nfacilities,  and  options  for  improving  delivery  of  urban  services;  (iii)  improving  municipal  financial \nmanagement by introducing improved accounting procedures and management information systems \nthat  include  budgeting,  resource  mobilization,  enhanced  O&M  of  assets,  and  improved  billing, \nrevenue  collection,  and  reporting  systems;  and  (iv)  establishing  regulatory  systems  to  ensure  that \nlaws, standards, rules, and regulations are equitably and consistently applied. These interventions are \ncritical  to  the  long-term  sustainability  of  urban  centers.  Wherever  possible,  technical  training  will  be \nlinked to measurable outputs to help determine whether skill levels have been achieved and technical \ntraining is applied. The design and implementation of measures for institutional strengthening will be \ncoordinated with training programs provided under other ongoing programs.  \n \n\nb. \n\nEnvironmental Support Services  \n\n33. \nAn  environmentally  sound  urban  development  plan  will  be  elaborated  to  ensure  a  well-\nmanaged  urban  expansion  in  a  fast-growing  city  with  high  demand  for  housing.  This  will  include \npreparation  of  base  as  well  as  geographic  information  systems  (GIS)  mapping  of  RT/WASA \nadministered areas. \n \n34. \nLand  use,  zoning,  and  building  laws  will  also  be  revised  and  legislated  to  control  urban \nexpansion and monitor water and sanitation connections and charges. A comprehensive database will \nbe available through this subcomponent to enable the asset management and billing departments of \nRawalpindi  Development  Authority  (RDA),  RT,  and  WASA  to  increase  and  maintain  revenue,  in \naddition to controlling and guiding urban development, and improving urban transport. \n \n\nc. \n\nAsset Management \n\n35. \nThe  assets  of  WASA  and  RT  are  scattered  and  no  records  are  readily  available.  This \nsubcomponent will also set up a separate asset management section to maintain, update, and record \nassets, resulting in greater transparency and sustainability. \n \n\nd. \n\nUrban Development  \n\n36. \nA  baseline  survey  and  GIS  mapping  of  additional  specified  areas  are  proposed  under  this \nsubcomponent,  as  are  detailed  land  use,  housing,  and  consumer  surveys.  This  will  lead  to \ndevelopment  of  land  use  and  urban  housing  databases  to  identify  areas  available  for  development. \nThese  actions  are  vital  for  both  urban  development  and  consumer  records  of  water  supply  and \nsanitation. \n \n\ne. \n\nProject Implementation Assistance \n\n37. \nThe  project  implementation  assistance  component  will  comprise  various  types  of  consulting \nservices, including project implementation support to the PMU for infrastructure design, construction \nsupervision, community development, and institutional strengthening. \n \n\nf. \n\nIncremental Administration Support \n\n38. \nIncremental administrative support for project implementation is required for the PMU, which, \nheaded  by  a  project  director,  will  be  responsible  for  coordination  among  RT,  RDA,  and  WASA  for \nplanning  and  management  of  project  activities.  The  PMU  will  include  eight  professional  staff, \nrepresenting different disciplines, and administrative support staff.  \n \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nFollowing  the  Southern  Punjab  Basic  Urban  Services  Project,  this  is  the  second  ADB-\n39. \nsupported investment project in urban development to make concerted efforts to align its scope and \nfocus,  and  institutional  and  financing  modalities,  with  the  new  governance  structure  under \nPLGO 2001.  The  Project  supports  the  PG  and  CDR  authorities  for  adoption  of  arrangements \nenvisaged under PLGO 2001. The Project has a number of special features with respect to devolution \nand collateral policy actions. The project design seeks to ensure that execution arrangements do not \ncompromise  the  devolved  authorities  of  the  CDR.  Project  implementation  follows the  spirit  of PLGO \n2001, shifting from vertical to horizontal programming. It offers particular assistance to the transition \nfrom  programs  that  are  vertical  and  province-driven  to  programs  that  the  CDR  (through  WASA  and \nRT) should carry out autonomously. \n \n40. \nIn  the  past,  a  top-down  approach  was  used  in  project  preparation  but  the  Project  was \ndesigned  in  close  collaboration  with  the  CDR,  beneficiaries,  and  NGOs  at  the  grassroots  level.  In \naddition  to  extensive  meetings  in  the  field  with  these  groups,  three  consultative  workshops  were \norganized  at  the  inception,  interim,  and  final  stages  of  the  PPTA.  In  the  final  workshop,  all \nstakeholders  endorsed  the  proposed  scope  and  implementation  arrangements  of  the  Project,  which \nconfirms that the project scope is strictly in line with the urgent need for improved environmental and \nbasic urban services. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n41. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $85.7  million  equivalent  (including  taxes  and \nduties), comprising $12.5 million equivalent (14.6%) in foreign exchange costs (including $1.1 million \nin interest charges during construction) and $73.2 million equivalent (85.4%) in local currency costs. \nTable 1 summarizes the estimated costs and detailed costs are in Appendix 6. \n \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates by Component \n($ million) \n\na.

The Government has provided ADB with: \n(i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of \nthese  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own  independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n45. \nThe  ADB  loans  will  cover  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  ($12.5  million),  including  interest \nand other charges amounting to $1.1 million, and will finance $47.5 million equivalent (64.9%) of the \nlocal  currency  costs.  The  local  currency  cost  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  cover  portions  of  the  civil \nworks,  vehicles,  consulting  services,  project  management  support,  and  land\u2014excluding  duties  and \ntaxes. ADB\u2019s financing of local currency expenditure is justified by the nature of the Project, which will \naddress  poverty,  gender,  and  environment  issues  within  the  project  area.  The  financing  of  land \nacquisition  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  R193-05  Cost  Sharing  and \nEligibility of Expenditures for Asian Development Bank Financing: A New Approach, and the detailed \nstaff instructions to be promulgated thereto. \n \n46. \nADB will provide the loan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, which will relend it to the PG on \nthe same terms and conditions. The foreign exchange risk will, however, be borne by the PG, which \nwill make the loan proceeds available to CDR as a grant.

WASA will be the Implementing \nAgency  (IA)  for  the  sewerage  system  and  STP  subcomponents,  and  improving  water  supply \ncomponent. RT will be the IA for the storm water drainage, solid waste management, slaughterhouse, \nand  public  toilets  subcomponents.  RDA  will  be  the  IA  for  the  environmental  support  services  and \n\n \n\n\f 12 \n\nurban  development  subcomponents.  WASA  and  RT  will  be  the  joint  IAs  for  the  municipal \nmanagement system development and asset management subcomponents.  \n \n48. \nThe EA will establish a PMU headed by the project director and located at WASA. The PMU, \ncomprising  professional  staff  (Appendix  7)  supported  by  a  team  of  consultants,  will:  (i)  assist  CDR, \nRT,  RDA,  and  WASA  in  providing  policy  guidance  and  implementing  the  project  components;  and \n(ii) support monitoring and evaluation of project implementation. The implementation framework is in \nAppendix 7. \n \n49. \n\nFor internal coordination, two committees will be set up within 3 months of loan effectiveness: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nA  project  implementation  review  committee:  headed  by  the  CDR  nazim  (head); \ncomprising  director  general  of  RDA,  managing  director  of  WASA,  the  RT  and  Pothar \ntown nazims, a city district officer of CDR, and one elected female representative from \nthe  district  council.  This  committee  will  review  the  implementation  progress  of  all \nproject components at least once every 3 months. \nA  project  steering  committee:  headed  by  the  Chairman,  Planning  and  Development \nBoard,  PG;  comprising  senior  officials  from  P&D;  Housing,  Urban  Development,  and \nPublic  Health  Engineering  Department  (HUD&PHED);  the  PG  finance  department; \nRDA; WASA; and CDR and RT nazims. This committee will be set up at P&D, PG in \nLahore  to  ensure  smooth  and  orderly  implementation,  provide  policy  guidance  on \nongoing  and  new  government  initiatives,  and  resolve  interagency  problems.  The \ncommittee will meet at least once every 6 months and decisions of the meetings will be \nreported to ADB.  \n\n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years  and  will  be  completed  in  March  2011.  The \n\n50. \nimplementation schedule for all project components is in Appendix 8. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n51. \nAll procurement services for the Project will follow ADB's Guidelines for Procurement and the \nrules  and  regulations  of  the  Government.  Contracts  for  civil  works  that  are  estimated  to  cost  more \nthan  $5  million  equivalent  will  be  issued  using  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures. \nContracts estimated to cost $5 million equivalent or less will be carried out through local competitive \nbidding  (LCB)  procedures.  Minor  development  and  maintenance  may  be  carried  out  on  a  force \naccount  basis.  The  procurement  of  goods  will  preferably  be  grouped  into  packages  larger  than \n$500,000 to be suitable for ICB procedures. Miscellaneous minor goods that cannot be grouped into \nlarger contracts, and are estimated to cost less than $500,000 per contract, will be procured through \ninternational shopping (IS) procedures. Minor items estimated to cost less than $100,000 equivalent \nper  contract  may  be  purchased  directly,  following  proper  procedures  to  ensure  economy,  efficiency, \nand quality. Proposed contract packages are in Appendix 9. \n \n52. \nTo  expedite  implementation,  the  PMU  will  take  advance  action  on  recruiting  all  consultants \nand  prequalifying  the  contractors.  The  PG  has  been  informed  that  the  approval  of  advance  actions \ndoes not commit ADB to finance project expenditures. \n \n53. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government  and  PG. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and transparency, ADB reserves \nthe  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive  or \ncoercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy are included in the Loan Regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. \nIn  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n\nspecifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency \nand all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n54. \nTo support project implementation  and build the long-term  capacity of RT and WASA, which \nare  responsible  for  the  planning  and  delivery  of  urban  services,  1,478  person-months  of  consulting \nservices (18 international and 1,460 domestic person-months) will be provided, covering: (i) Package \nA: project management and implementation support to the PMU, including subproject detailed design, \nconstruction supervision, and monitoring and evaluation (13 international and 1,152 domestic person-\nmonths); (ii) Package B: institutional development (5 international and 164 domestic person-months); \nand (iii) Package C: community development and participation (144 domestic person-months), which \nwill  be  contracted  to  local  NGOs  and  individual  social  mobilizers.  Supplementary  Appendix  B  gives \nmore details. \n \n55. \nThe consultants for the domestic person-months under Package A and B will be selected as \nfirms.  The  selection  and  engagement  of  the  firms    will  be  in  accordance  with  the  quality-and-cost-\nbased  selection  method  under  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  or  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The consultants for the international \nperson-months under the same packages will be selected as individual consultants. The Package C \nconsulting services will be contracted to individual social mobilizers or local NGOs for facilitating the \nimplementation  of  the  solid  waste  component  and  community  mobilization  for  the  water  supply  and \nsewerage  components.  The  individual  social  mobilizer  will  be  selected  as  individual  consultant  and \nthe local NGOs will be selected as firms using the quality-based selection (QBS) method under ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants or other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement \nof  domestic  consultants.  The  use  of  QBS  under  Package  C  is  due  to  the  specialized  nature  of  the \nassignment. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nTo  facilitate  financial  control,  disbursement  categories  will  be  established  by  component  and \n56. \nby expenditure type (work, goods, and services). The PMU will prepare disbursement projections and \nrequest budget allocations for counterpart funds. CDR will establish an imprest account in the name of \nthe  PMU  at  the  National  Bank  of  Pakistan  (immediately  after  loan  effectiveness)  to  expedite \ndisbursement of loan proceeds, in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook and detailed \narrangements between the Government and ADB. Except as ADB may otherwise agree, the account \nwill consist of advances based on estimates of anticipated expenditure to be incurred for a 6-month \nperiod  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  The  ADB  statement  of  expenditures  (SOE) \nprocedure  may  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  and  to  liquidate  and  replenish  advances \nmade into the imprest account for individual payment transactions not exceeding $100,000. The CDR \nwill coordinate the timely release of funds and maintain acceptable levels of financial control.  \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n57. \nThe  CDR,  acting  through  the  PMU,  will  maintain  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify \nworks,  goods,  and  services  financed  by  the  loan  proceeds.  Specifically,  the  CDR  will:  (i)  maintain \nseparate  accounts  for  the  Project;  (ii)  ensure  that  project  accounts  and  financial  statements  are \naudited annually in accordance with sound accounting principles by independent auditors acceptable \nto ADB; and (iii) submit to ADB, not later than 6 months after the close of each fiscal year, certified \ncopies  of  audited  accounts  and  financial  statements  and  the  auditor\u2019s  report  on  them.  Furthermore, \nunaudited financial statements will be provided to ADB no later than 6 months following the end of the \nfiscal year. Audit of the project accounts will include an audit of the use of the imprest account and \nSOE procedures, and the annual audit report will have a separate audit opinion on the use of these \nprocedures. \n \n\n \n\n\f 14 \n\n58. \nThe  PMU  will  prepare  monthly  progress  reports,  in  a  format  acceptable  to  ADB,  with \ninformation  on:  (i)  progress  made  against  established  targets,  including  pre-identified  monitoring \nindicators; (ii) delays and problems encountered, and actions taken to resolve them; (iii) work carried \nout by the consultants; (iv) updated results of water quality monitoring and action taken on problems \nencountered;  (v)  progress  made  on  PPMS;  (vi)  compliance  with  loan  covenants;  (vii)  proposed \nprogram of activities for the next month; and (viii) progress expected during the next 3 months. The \nmonthly  report  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  by  the  end  of  the  first  week  of  the  following  month.  Within \n3 months  of  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  the  CDR  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  a  project \ncompletion  report  on  the  execution  of  the  Project,  including  costs  and  compliance  with  the  loan \ncovenants. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n59. \nA short list of verifiable performance indicators for monitoring and evaluation was prepared in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Project  Performance  Management  System  (Supplementary  Appendix  C) \nduring the PPTA. The PG, CDR, and PMU will ensure that comprehensive PPMS is established within \n9 months of loan effectiveness and maintained to monitor and evaluate the technical performance and \nsocial and economic benefits of the Project, especially for the poor and for women. The performance \nmonitoring  indicators  and  procedures  will  be  tested  with  respect  to  data  availability  and  other \nconstraints, revised if necessary, and institutionalized as part of the Project\u2019s MIS. The PMU  will be \nresponsible  for  establishing  the  PPMS,  and  monitoring  and  assessment  of  the  performance  of \nsubprojects  at  6-month  intervals.  To  measure  the  Project\u2019s  impact  on  beneficiaries,  particularly  low-\nincome groups, baseline information established during the PPTA will be updated at the beginning of \nimplementation  of  each  project  component.  This  information  will  be  the  basis  for  determining  the \nresulting  impacts.  Indicators  that  can  be  monitored  will  comprise:  (i)  institutional  development \n(ii)  subproject \nindicators,  covering \nimplementation indicators for the various categories and types of urban infrastructure, including levels \nof coverage and service delivery; and (iii) sectoral impact indicators, covering economic growth, public \nhealth, and community participation. The CDR will continue to update and forward to ADB the PPMS \nand  MIS  at  6  month  intervals  for  at  least  3  years  after  project  completion.  In  addition,  following  the \nwater audit, a civil society task force will be established to monitor implementation of the Government \nPolicy (Appendix 2). \n \n\nfinancial  management,  and  O&M; \n\nrevenue  generation, \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n60. \nThe Project will be reviewed jointly by the EA and ADB semiannually to assess progress and \nwill  undergo  a  more  comprehensive  review  at  midterm.  Taking  into  account  the  PPMS  results,  the \nmidterm  review  will:  (i)  evaluate  the  Project\u2019s  scope,  design,  and  implementation  arrangements; \n(ii) evaluate  the  progress  of  the  institutional  reform  and  infrastructure  development  components; \n(iii) identify  changes  needed  in  any  or  all  of  the  above  areas;  (iv)  assess  the  implementation \nperformance  against  agreed  targets  in  the  project  framework;  (v)  identify  critical  issues  and \nconstraints,  if  any;  and  (vi)  recommend  adjustments  to  the  project  design  and/or  implementation \narrangements, if necessary. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Beneficiaries \n\nThe Project will improve the living conditions of about 1.4 million residents of Rawalpindi city,22 \n61. \nby  enhancing  the  quality  of  life  and  health,  improving  the  environment,  and  creating  conditions \nconducive  to  sustained  urban  development  and  economic  growth.  The  Project  will  contribute  to \nreduce  mortality,  morbidity,  and  poverty;  and  help  mitigate  the  loss  of  amenity  associated  with \nenvironmental degradation in the city, especially among slum inhabitants and poor groups (particularly \n\n                                                 \n22  The city population is 1.4 million, excluding the cantonment area, out of the total population of Rawalpindi (2.2 million). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15\n\nwomen  and  children).  The  Project  will  support  improvements  to  the  capacity  of  RT  and  WASA  by \nimproving  their  financial  and  operational  management  and  planning,  including  local  resource \ngeneration. A summary of project benefits and beneficiaries is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n62. \nThe effectiveness and sustainability of these improvements will be reinforced by efforts aimed \nat  community  development  and  revenue  improvement.  These  efforts  will  also  lead  to:  (i)  a  stronger \nsense of belonging at local level; and (ii) increased capacities of the RT and WASA to carry out their \nduties  more  effectively\u2014especially  to  provide  better  O&M  for  existing,  rehabilitated,  and  new \ninfrastructure facilities, and meet people\u2019s needs. \n \nCommunity  Involvement.  Three  consultative  workshops  attended  by  NGOs,  CBOs,  private \n63. \nand  public  sector  representatives,  and  other  stakeholders  were  held  during  the  preparation  of  this \nProject to undertake brainstorming for each project component and its investment. \n \nThe  Project  will  encourage  and  strengthen  collective  action  within  low-income  and  under-\n64. \nserviced  localities.  A  main  objective  of  this  work  will  be  to  make  RT  infrastructure  investment  more \nresponsive to the demands of low-income groups\u2014more inclusive, more sustainable, and more cost-\neffective  than  supply-driven  approaches.  A secondary  objective  will  be  to  empower  low-income \ngroups by making them capable of collective action through CBOs and UAs, and by forming functional \nlinks  among  communities,  CBOs,  and  UAs  (e.g.,  location,  planning,  construction,  and  long-term \nmaintenance of the public toilets proposed under the Project).  \n \nThe concept of community mobilization and participation in developing urban infrastructure is \n65. \nnot  new  in Pakistan.  The  Orangi  Pilot  Project  in  Karachi simplified  sanitation  designs  to  make them \naffordable  and  technically  viable  for  local  implementation.  It  also  involved  training  in  community \norganization and technical details as well as supervision and organized work through local residents \nat the zone (ward) level. \n \n66. \nTo strengthen community participation in local level governance in Rawalpindi, the Project will \nundertake the following measures: (i) ward level committees (including beneficiary groups and elected \nUA  councilors)  will  be  formed  to  manage  solid  waste  collection;  (ii)  various  lanes  will  gather  solid \nwaste at a convenient place for onward transport to a transfer station, and a committee will be given a \ntransfer trolley to be maintained by the community or NGO; (iii) a local committee, NGO, or CBO will \nconduct training for planning of sanitation and other activities in its area; (iv) public service committees \nwill  be  formed  to  monitor  public  toilets  and  drinking  fountains;  and  (v)  local  finance  management \ncommittees and a civil society task force will be formed to monitor the outcomes and impact of budget \nand policy decisions.  \n \nPoverty  Reduction.  Socioeconomic  surveys  in  Rawalpindi  show  that  35%  of  sample \n67. \nhouseholds,  with  an  average  family  size  of  6.5  persons,  have  a  monthly  income  of  less  than \nPRs6,000  ($100),  which  reflects  per  capita  income  far  below  the  poverty  line  of  $1  per  day.  Urban \npoverty in Rawalpindi is multifaceted, ranging from lack of employment to deficiencies in basic urban \nservices such as water and sewerage and solid waste disposal, to substandard housing. The surveys \nshow that 53% of households are receiving piped water for 2\u20134 hours per day, while 35% receive it for \nless  than  2  hours  per  day.  Among  households  sampled,  only  35%  had  access  to  sewerage.  The \ncombination  of  shortage  of  good  quality  water  with  inadequate  sewerage  systems  has  adversely \naffected public health and the urban environment. Solid waste collection and disposal among poorer \nhouseholds is almost nonexistent. Solid waste is thrown into drains or open lots, attracting flies and \nrodents.  Households  suffer  from  various  degrees  of  environmental  pollution  through  disposal  of \nwastewater in open drains and flooding of such wastewater in residential neighborhoods.  \n \n68. \nThe  Project  will  provide  water  to  poor  communities  through  piped  distribution  systems,  while \nthe  environmental  sanitation  component  will  provide  for  expanded  sewerage  pipe  networks  to  low-\nincome areas and an STP for the entire Rawalpindi city. Systems will be designed to give the urban \n\n \n\n\f 16 \n\npoor  adequate  access  to  improved  sanitation.  The  expected  benefits  are  public  hygiene  and  health \nimprovement  as  well  as  direct  economic  benefits  from  lower  water  costs  in  low-income  areas  and \nreduced  pollution  of  groundwater.  Improved  solid  waste  management  and  recycling  with  the \ninvolvement  of  communities,  NGOs,  and  UAs  will  also  generate  employment  for  the  urban  poor \n(especially women) who work as sanitary workers. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is \nin Appendix 11. \n \n69. \nGender.  A  large  portion  of  project  benefits  will accrue  to  women.  Women\u2019s  time  and  energy \nwill  be  saved  by  provision  of  water  supply  to  households  through  pipes  or  communal  water  points. \nWomen  will  also  benefit  from  improved  sewerage:  (i)  women  spend  more  time  in  residential \nneighborhoods than men and will benefit more from improved hygiene; and (ii) women are traditionally \ncharged  with  the  care  of  sick  family  members  and  will  thus  benefit  more  from  reduced  illness.  The \nProject  will  address  gender  issues  by  (i)  strengthening  the  role  of  women  councilors  in  municipal \ngovernance; (ii) involving women\u2019s groups in community-level project activities; (iii) including women \nof  local  government  institutions  in  training  activities;  and  (iv)  conducting  community  training  and \nmobilization campaigns for project beneficiaries in wards at the UA level to ensure active participation \nof women. Appendix 11 includes a gender strategy approved by the PG. \n \n70. \nEconomic  and  Financial  Benefits.  Economic  and  financial  analyses  were  undertaken  in \naccordance with ADB's Framework for the Economic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development \nSector  Projects  (Appendixes  12  and  13).  The  economic  benefits  identified  were  based  on  each \ncomponent in Rawalpindi. Economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) were prepared for the sewerage \nnetwork  and  STP,  water  supply,  and  solid  waste  management.  Benefits  include  significant  poverty \nreduction and improvements in living conditions, particularly in the health and hygiene of the largely \npoor  urban  population\u2014mainly  through  sewer  connections  and  improved  collection  and  disposal  of \nsolid  waste.  Sewage  treatment  is  expected  to  provide  additional  water  for  agricultural  production, \nreduce environmental hazards, and provide additional income. \n \n71. \nThe refurbishment and replacement of the old water supply network will entail health and non-\nincremental  benefits,  including:  (i)  savings  in  productive  time  due  to  reduction  in  sickness  from \ncontaminated water, (ii) greater availability of saleable water due to reduction in water wastage from \nleaks,  and  (iii)  increased  water  revenue  and  better  sustainability  due  to  increased  sales  to  new \ncustomers.  In  the  old  areas  of  Rawalpindi  that  have  aging  water  supply  networks,  larger  size  plots \nhave  been  subdivided  into  multiple  units.  However,  the  number  of  water  connections  has  remained \nthe same, resulting in a sizeable revenue loss. With improvement in the network, revenue is expected \nto increase significantly. These benefits are based on consumers\u2019 willingness to pay. \n \n72. \nThe  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  for  the  solid  waste  subproject  is  7.3%,  2.7%  for \nsewerage  and  storm  water  drainage  subproject,  and  6.2%  for  water  supply.  For  the  purpose  of \ncalculating FIRRs, a conservative estimate is based on the assumption that the collection efficiency of \nuser  fees  is  80%  (compared  with  the  95%  target),  the  project  implementation  period  takes  8  years \n(instead  of  5 years  as  planned),  and  in  the  case  of  WASA,  non-revenue  water  remains  50% \n(compared  with  the  20%  target).  Since  WASA  has  initiated  a  consumer  survey  to  update  the \nconsumer  database,  several  thousand  illegal  connections  will  be  legalized.  Furthermore,  concrete \nmeasures  such  as  organizational  development  are  being  taken  to  enhance  revenue  collection \nefficiency  and  comply  with  the  agreed  tariff  plan.  Government  policy  (Appendix  2)  demonstrates \nagreed  action  to  ensure  financial  sustainability.  All  these  factors  will  contribute  to  considerable \nincrease in revenue. The FIRRs (except sewerage and the storm water drainage subproject) exceed \nthe weighted average cost of capital (about 5%), demonstrating that the Project is financially viable at \nproposed tariff levels. Low FIRRs, in the case of sewerage and drainage, reflect nonpayment of user \nfees  for  the  storm  water  drainage  subproject  and  the  conservative  assumption  that  only  60%  of \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\ntargeted connections would be made, considering lessons learned in earlier projects in Pakistan such \nas the Second Urban Development Project23 in North-West Frontier Province (Appendix 12).  \n \n73. \nThe  EIRR  calculation  was  undertaken  in  constant  2004  prices  using  the  domestic  price \nnumeraire,  since  the  outputs  are  non-tradeable  in  nature.  Economic  costs  (excluding  taxes  and \nmarket distortions) are converted using a standard conversion factor of 0.9. The EIRRs of the project \ncomponents are 21.6% for water supply, 12.4% for sewerage, 15.8% for sewage treatment, 16.8% for \ndrainage, and 21.1% for solid waste management. The overall project EIRR is estimated to be 15.8%. \nSwitching  values  and  sensitivity  indicators  were  tested  and  standard  and  project-specific  sensitivity \nanalysis was conducted. All project components were found to be economically viable under adverse \ncost-benefit scenarios. \n \nB. \n\nSocial and Environmental Safeguards \n\nSocial. The EA has prepared a draft resettlement plan (RP) for the Project following national \n74. \nlaws  and  policies:  (i)  Land  Acquisition  Act,  1894  (amended  up  to  2003);  (ii)  National  Resettlement \nPolicy,  2002;  (iii)  Project  Implementation  and  Resettlement  of  Affected  Persons  Ordinance,  2001; \n(iii) Punjab  Development  of  Cities  Ordinance,  1981;  and  (iv)  Pakistan  Environmental  Protection  Act, \n1997. The RP also follows ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, 1995. The RP is summarized in \nAppendix  10  and  the  entire  document  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  D.  The  Project  is  designed  to \nminimize land acquisition and resettlement impacts. The resettlement and land acquisition under the \nProject was carried out in accordance with the requirements of R193-05 Cost Sharing and Eligibility of \nExpenditures  for  Asian  Development  Bank  Financing:  A  New  Approach  and  the  related  draft  OM \nSection  H3/BP.    The  Cost  Sharing  and  Eligibility  of  Expenditures  for  Asian  Development  Bank \nFinancing:  A  New  Approach  paper  is  broadly  consistent  with  that  of  the  World  Bank  and  follows \nclosely the rationale and presentation in its Eligibility of Expenditures in World Bank Lending: A New \nPolicy  Framework.  Therefore,  as  instructed  by  ADB\u2019s  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development \nDepartment, the formulation of the resettlement plan, including land acquisition, was also guided by \nthe  detailed  staff  instructions  issued  by  World  Bank\u2019s  Operations  Policy  and  Country  Services,  in \nBank  Financing:  Guidelines  to  Staff,  April  16  2004.  A  total  of  284  ha  is  required  for  the  STP,  solid \nwaste transfer stations and landfill site, and service corridors (right-of-way) for laying trunk sewers and \nmaintaining  storm  drains.  The  proposed  STP  site  was  chosen  because  it  minimizes  resettlement \nimpacts, although it is not the most technically feasible option.  \n \nLand  acquisition  for  the  250  ha  proposed  STP  site  will  affect  197  landowners  and \n75. \n36 tenants/agricultural workers. The proposed solid waste transfer station and landfill site (32 ha) will \nbe constructed in government-owned land. There are two brick structures occupied by transient brick \nworkers  in  the  proposed  landfill  site.  To  the  extent  possible,  the  sewerage  network  and  storm  drain \ncomponents  prioritize  rehabilitation  of  existing  infrastructure  to  avoid  resettlement  impacts.  The \nacquisition of 2 ha is required for 7 m service corridors for the sewerage system and 8\u201310 m service \ncorridors  for  storm  drains.  The  sewerage  network  will  partially  affect  370  houses.  Approximately \n28 houses will be partially affected by the storm drain subcomponent. The Project is not expected to \ncause  large-scale  movement  of  people  to  distant  locations.  The  overall  impacts  are  to  be  further \nminimized  through  careful  component  siting  and  alignment  during  detailed  design.  The  EA  has \nassured  ADB  the  implementation  of  the  RP  (finalized  during  detailed  design  in  accordance  with \ngovernment laws and policies and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement).  \n \n76. \nThe  Project  provides  direct  social  benefits  through  improvement  and  increased  access  to \nenvironmental sanitation and water supply\u2014enhancing quality of life and health, the environment, and \nthe potential for sustained urban development and economic growth. Social assessments undertaken \nduring the PPTA reviewed the cultural and ethnic diversity of people in Rawalpindi. Analysis showed \n\n                                                 \n23  ADB. 1989.

[Loan 1004-PAK(SF)]. \n\n \n\n\f 18 \n\nno evidence of the existence of indigenous people or negative impacts on minorities. The RP ensures \nthat  vulnerable  groups  including  indigenous  people  affected  by  land  acquisition  and  involuntary \nresettlement will be given additional assistance. \n \n77. \nEnvironment.  The  EA  has  prepared  an  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  following \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines.  The  main  findings  were \nsummarized in a summary environmental impact assessment (SEIA) circulated to the ADB Board and \nposted  on  ADB\u2019s  website  in  July  2005.  The  salient  points  of  the  approved  SEIA  (Supplementary \nAppendix F) are summarized in Appendix 14. \n \n78. \nThe SEIA shows that the Project will result in net environmental benefits, including improved \nground  and  surface  water  quality,  and  improved  solid  waste  and  sewage  collection  and  treatment. \nThis will significantly improve health and quality of life in Rawalpindi, as well as agriculture and fishing \nin  the  Soan  River  downstream.  Potential  adverse  impacts  during  construction  and  operation  have \nbeen identified. Some impacts are minor and easily mitigated while others are potentially significant, \nlong-term,  and  irreversible  if  suggested  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  plans are  not  enforced. \nDraft  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs)  and  associated  monitoring  plans  have  been \ndeveloped  for  this  purpose.  The  EA  has  assured  the  implementation  of  EMPs  and  associated \nmonitoring  plans  (finalized  during  detailed  design  in  accordance  with  government  environmental \nregulations  and  policies,  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy),  and  incorporation  of  mitigation  measures \nidentified in the SEIA and EIA in design and bidding documents. \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\n79.  Major risks associated with the Project include the following. \n\n(i)  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nAcquisition of required land may be delayed or not forthcoming, which could delay or \nimpede implementation of certain subprojects. \nFrequent turnover of trained staff and delayed decision making on critical issues by the \nCDR, WASA, and RDA could jeopardize project benefits. \nFuture  legislation  could  gradually  erode  the  comprehensiveness  and  consistency  of \nPLGO  2001,  which  could  seriously  impede  CDR\u2019s  effectiveness  as  a  main  actor  in \nproject implementation. \nImplementation  of  the  agreed  Government  Policy  (Appendix  2)  could  be  delayed  and \nefforts for enhancement of the revenue base and institutional strengthening of the RT \nand the WASA may not give sufficient and sustainable results. This could affect project \nimplementation or the long-term sustainability of improvements, or both. \n\n \n CDR  will  initiate  the  land  acquisition  process  before  loan  approval  to  avoid  implementation \n80. \ndelays.  Close  monitoring  and  early  flagging  for  action  by  the  project  implementation  review  and \nsteering  committees  will  minimize  the  risk  of  delayed  decision  making.  Considering  lessons  learned \nfrom  the  phase  1  project,  the  PG  has  provided  a  firm  commitment  to  minimize  staff  turnover  and \nrecruit  qualified  staff  for  PMU,  WASA,  and  RT.  Strict  attention  to  timely  project  progress  reporting, \nincluding  staffing  and  accounting,  will  also  help.  The  Government  is  particularly  committed  to \ndevolution reform, especially capacity building of RT and WASA. The Project is a timely contribution \nto the devolution process. The risk of delays in implementing the Government Policy will be minimized \nby a water audit that will lead to updating the Government Policy, and its monitoring by a civil society \ntask force.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nThe  Government,  the  PG  and  the  CDR  have  given  the  following  specific  assurances,  in \n\n81. \naddition to the standard assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nPG  policy  for  water  supply  and  sanitation,  solid  waste  management,  and  urban \ndevelopment  (Appendix  2)  will  be  implemented  and  updated  within  one  year  of  loan \neffectiveness  following  the  water  services  survey  to  be  undertaken  within  six  months \nafter loan effectiveness. \nPG  and  CDR  will  ensure  the  implementation  of  a  tariff  revision  in  accordance  with  the \ntariff plan, agreed during phase-1 project.  \nPG  and  CDR  will  privatize  the  operation  of  the  water  tankers  (bouzers)  to  the  private \nsector  through  a  fair  and  transparent  mechanism  to  ensure  that  such  operation  will  be \nundertaken by the most qualified and efficient private operator. \nPG and CDR will ensure that the solid waste collection presently managed by the RT will \nbe  devolved  to  UAs  within  6  months  after  loan  effectiveness.  Such  devolution  will  be \nfollowed by the proper allocation of resources to the UAs. \nThe Government and PG acknowledge that ADB, consistent with its commitment to good \ngovernance,  accountability  and  transparency,  reserves  the  right  to  conduct  audits \n(including  nonfinancial  procurement  audits)  of  any  possible  financial  or  management \nimpropriety in the conduct of the Project. The Government, PG and CDR will cooperate \nfully  with  any  such  audit  and  will  extend  all  necessary  assistance,  including  access  to \nrelevant books, records and personnel.  \nThe Government will update the environmental impact assessment (EIA), the summary \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  (SEIA),  and  environmental  management  plans \n(EMPs) based on detailed engineering design. The EA will submit the revised EIA, SEIA, \nand EMPs to ADB for review and approval prior to award of any civil works contracts. \nThe  PG  will  ensure  that  the  design,  construction,  operation  and  implementation  of  all \nproject  facilities  is  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  EIA  agreed  upon  between  the \nGovernment  and  ADB,  and  complies  with  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  laws  and \nregulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy,  2002  and  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines,  2003.  Any  adverse  environmental  impacts  arising  from  the  construction, \noperation and implementation of the project facilities will be minimized by implementing \nthe  EMPs  and  associated  monitoring  plans,  and  PG  will  implement  all  mitigation  and \nmonitoring measures specified in the EIA and SEIA. Project implementation will include \nconsultation  with  local  communities  on  environmental  issues  and  all  necessary \nenvironmental  clearances  will  be  obtained  from  the  Punjab  Environmental  Protection \nDepartment for all applicable components prior to starting any construction activities. The \nGovernment  will  ensure  environmental  requirements  will  be  incorporated  in  bidding \ndocuments and civil works contracts. \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  The  Government  will  update  the  draft  resettlement  plan  (RP)  based  on  final  detailed \ndesign. The Government will submit the revised RP to ADB for review and approval prior \nto award of any related civil works contracts. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  all  land  and  right-of-way  required  for  the  Project  are \nmade  available  in  a  timely  manner,  adequate  compensations  are  provided  prior  to  the \nsigning  of  relevant  civil  works  contracts,  and  involuntary  resettlement  is  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  the  updated  resettlement  plan  agreed  upon  between  the  Government \nand ADB, the Government\u2019s land acquisition and resettlement laws and regulations, and \nADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement 1995. \nPG  and  CDR  will  ensure  that  no  civil  contracts  will  be  awarded  over  the  Mouza  Losar \nlandfill site until outstanding complaints regarding compensation for the purchase of the \nsite have been redressed in accordance with (a) the updated resettlement plan agreed \nupon between the PG and ADB, (b) the Government\u2019s land acquisition and resettlement \nlaws and regulations, and (c) ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, 1995.  \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Project  will  not  negatively  impact  on  vulnerable \ngroups and be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples, 1998 \nand Policy on Gender and Development, 2003. \n\n(xi) \n\n(x) \n\n \n\n\f 20 \n\n \nB. \n\n \nC. \n\n(xii) \n\nPG and CDR will carry out a comprehensive organization development program for RT \nand WASA commencing within 6 months after loan effectiveness. \n\n(xiii)  The PG will ensure that adequate budgetary allocations of required counterpart funds are \n\nmade and released in a timely manner to CDR. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\n82. \n\nThe following are conditions for the effectiveness of the loan: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe Planning Commission Proforma-I (PC-I) of the Project will have been approved by \nthe duly competent authority of the Government, and \nThe PMU will have been provided with core staff to the satisfaction of ADB.  \n\nCondition for Disbursement \n\n83. \nNo withdrawals will be made from the loan account for the execution of the outfall sewer and \nSTP  until  all  land  and  right-of-way  required  for  these  subcomponents  are  acquired  and  involuntary \nresettlement  is  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  updated  resettlement  plan  agreed  upon  between \nthe Government and ADB, the Government\u2019s land acquisition and resettlement laws and regulations, \nand ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, 1995.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian \n84. \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the President, under the provisions of Article \n35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board approve  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 27,727,000 to the \nIslamic Republic of Pakistan for the Rawalpindi Environmental Improvement Project from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a \ngrace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to \nthe Board; and \nThe  loan  of  $20,000,000  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Rawalpindi \nEnvironmental Improvement Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest \nto  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such \nother terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the Board, provided that $4,500,000 \nof the said loan allocated for land acquisition and compensation shall not be disbursed \nuntil  the  R.

purposes \n\n(iii) Conservation of water \n \n\n(iv) Equitable access to and use of water \n \n\nAppendix 2  25\n\nGOVERNMENT POLICY \n\n \n\nWater Supply and Sanitation Policy \nRawalpindi  Water  and  Sanitation  Agency  (WASA)  will  be  staffed  with \ncompetent trained management and employees committed on a long-\nterm basis to providing services to the public. WASA management will \nbe  given  autonomy  to  manage  and  operate  the  water  supply  and \nsanitation  services  without  outside  interference.  WASA  shall  publish \nfor the public an annual report on its operations and development each \nyear.  A  structured  and  systematic  program  of  organization \ndevelopment will be implemented for WASA. \n\u2022  The  long-term  goal  is  that  tariffs  will  cover  the  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) costs plus capital costs plus debt servicing for all \nwater  supply,  and  the  O&M  costs  of  all  sewerage.  WASA  will  meet \nO&M  costs  for  water  supply  and  sanitation  through  enhancement  of \ncollection efficiency and increase in tariffs as per already agreed tariff \nplan,  which require not to impose the tariff beyond the affordability of \nthe  consumers  and  increase  it  gradually  with  increase  in  the  level  of \nservice. WASA will become a self-sustainable organization. Collection \nefficiency of tariffs must exceed 80% by March 2006 and non-revenue \nwater  should  decrease  from  the  existing  estimated  40%  to  less  than \n15%  by  September  2006.  Disconnections  for  nonpayment,  presently \nenforced,  will  be  further  strengthened.  WASA  has  computerized  its \nrevenue  and  accounting  system  and  computerized  bills  are  being \nissued  to  the  consumers.  Privatization  of  billing  and  collection  will  be \nintroduced  to  improve  the  revenues  and  the  billing  will  be  conducted \non a monthly basis. All complaint offices will be functional and WASA \nwill  maintain  a  management  information  system  (MIS)  to  record  and \nmonitor the status of registered complaints. \n\u2022  Operation  of  delivering  and  selling  water  through  the  tankers \n(bouzers),  currently  facing  financial  loss  shall  be  privatized  by  June \n2006.  Standposts  shall  be  provided  at  identified  locations  and  the \nO&M of these posts shall be handed over to the union administrations \n(UAs). \n\u2022  Rawalpindi  Development  Authority  (RDA)  on  15  March  2004 \nreduced  the  water  connection  fee  from  PRs1,500  to  PRs500  for \ndomestic consumers and from PRs3,500 to PRs1,500 for commercial \nconsumers, effective 20 March 2004. This step helped to  expand the \nconsumer network and reduce the illegal connections. \n\u2022  All  water  supply  services  will  be  metered  and  payment  for  water \nuse  will  be  made  on  the  basis  of  the  volume  consumed.  No  flat  rate \ntariffs  will  be  allowed.  The  tariff  structure  will  reflect  government \npolicies  on  water  conservation  and  lifeline  rates  for  the  urban  poor. \nThese reforms will be fully implemented by end of 2007. \n\u2022  Installation  of  water  meters  is  in  progress  and  out  of  19,000 \ndomestic  and  commercial  meters  procured  under  phase-I  project, \n10,000  water  meters  have  already  been  installed.  WASA  has  started \nbilling  on  meter  reading  for  metered  supply.  However,  all  the \nconnections  will  be  completed  on  procurement  and  installation  of \nanother 50,000 meters under the proposed project.  \n\u2022  Non-revenue  water,  which  includes  both  physical  and  commercial \nlosses, shall be measured and reduced progressively each year.  \n\u2022  WASA is making all efforts to minimize non-revenue  water and this \nwill be reduced to less than 15% by September 2006. \n\u2022  Service levels shall, wherever possible, be a household connection. \nIf  this  is  not  possible,  it  shall  be  no  less  than  a  standpipe  within \n100 meters  of  any  dwelling.  Increase  in  service  connections  will  be \nclosely monitored and reported to the public each year. \n\u2022  Every school in Rawalpindi shall be provided adequate piped water \nsupplies  and  toilets  (latrines).  Public  toilets  maintained  by  user \ncharges shall be constructed in all high density public locations.  \n\n\f \n26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n(v) Awareness of the public and \ngovernment about the facts of water supply \nservices in Rawalpindi. \n \n\n(vi) Sustainable use of groundwater \n \n\n(vii) Optimum utilization of sewerage \nnetwork \n\nSolid Waste Management \nObjectives are 100% collection and \ndisposal of solid waste in Rawalpindi; and \nthe cost of solid waste collection and \ndisposal be borne by the creator of the \nwaste \n \nLong-term objective is to maintain efficient \nsolid waste management in a sustainable \nmanner through sound financial and human \nresources management \n\nUrban Development Objectives \nPreparation, approval, and implementation \nof land use plans, including adequate open \nareas, parks, playgrounds, and graveyards \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank staff. \n\n\u2022  A  comprehensive  water  audit  will  be  undertaken  in  2005  to  verify \ncoverage, examine the  way all people get water, how much they get, \nand how much they pay; and to explore the use of non-revenue water. \nAfter  analysis,  the  findings  of  this  audit  will  be  discussed  at  a \nstakeholder  consultation  and  this  will  be  the  basis  for  formulation  of \nnew  government  policy.  This  will  be  conducted  under  the  proposed \nProject. \n\u2022  Community  awareness  and  community  development  will  be \npromoted  through  WASA.  It  is  already  holding  regular  meetings  with \nUA\u2019s heads (nazims) and naib nazims. However, in the future, NGOs \nwill be involved to promote community awareness. Print and electronic \nmedia are also being used for this purpose.  \nAll  groundwater  use  other  than  that  for  one  household  shall  be \nregistered as to owner, type of installation, location, volume extracted, \nand use of water. \n\u2022  The  sewerage  connection  fee  will  be  reduced  from  the  existing \nPRs500 to PRs250 as an incentive to encourage consumers.  \n\u2022  Prior to laying any new sewer in any UA, the communities will sign a \nmemorandum  of  understanding  with  the  project  management  unit \n(PMU),  where  a  50%  connection  fee  will  be  collected  by  the  UAs  in \nadvance  and  PMU  will  commence  the  work  in  those  UAs  where  at \nleast 80% of people have deposited the connection fee to their UAs. \n\u2022  Payment  of  recurrent  sewerage  charges  will  be  added  to  the  water \nsupply bill. Failure to pay the water and sewerage bill may then result \nin disconnection of the water supply.  \n\u2022  Those connecting to the sewerage network will no longer pay for the \ncost of periodic desludging of their septic tank or latrine.  \n\u2022  Civil  society  and  community-based  organizations  (CBOs)  would  be \ninvolved in the monitoring and reporting regarding the O&M of sewers. \nSolid Waste Management Policy Center \n\u2022  Introduce  public-private  partnerships  for  collection.

Much  of  the  urban  growth  has  been \nuncontrolled  and  unplanned,  because  of  the  absence  of  effective  planning  and  enforcement \ntools,  and  insufficient  development  of  human  resources.  Most  towns  and  cities  lack  plans  for \ncontrolled  urban  development,  and  for  linkage  between  the  development  of  new  housing  and \ncommercial  or  industrial  areas.  Most  urban  areas  have  not  developed  the  infrastructure  and \nurban services needed to support such urban growth and expansion. \n \nUrban  areas  suffer  from  various  deficiencies  in  infrastructure.  Town  centers  generally \n2. \nhave  most  required  elements  of  physical  infrastructure  (including  roads,  markets,  bus  stands, \nand water supply systems) without community involvement, sewerage systems, and solid waste \ncollection systems. Some systems (especially roads, markets, and bus stands) suffer capacity \nproblems because urban populations and commercial activities in the town centers have grown \nto  a  level  beyond  their  original  design.  As  a  result,  commercial  activities  spill  over  into  the \nstreets, which are already overburdened by a vehicle traffic volume far higher than their design \ncapacity. \n \n3. \nSystems for water supply, sewerage, and solid waste collection suffer greatly from poor \noperations  and  maintenance  (O&M).  The  Government  of  Punjab  (PG)  often  designed  and \nconstructed  water  supply  systems  and  turned  them  over  for  O&M  to  the  local  government, \nwhich  has  to  handle  gaps  between  system  design  and  real  consumer  demand.  The  gaps  are \noften  considerable  and  have  led  to  poor  utilization  of  systems,  resulting  in  poor  cost  recovery \nand  the  need  for  permanent  subsidies  from  local  government  budgets.  The  collection  and \ndisposal of municipal solid waste is mostly poor, without the participation of local communities, \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), or the private sector. Uncollected waste causes adverse \nenvironmental effects, such as bad odors and breeding of flies. Poor collection and removal of \nsolid  waste  also  leads  to  the  clogging  of  sewer  lines,  which  is  a  major  problem  of  urban \ninfrastructure systems. Blocked sewer lines make household sewage collection ineffective and \ncause  ponding  of  sewage  in  lanes  and  streets.  This  leads  to  damage  to  private  and  public \nproperty, disruption of traffic, breeding of mosquitoes and other pests, and infiltration of sewage \ninto shallow groundwater. This leads to serious health problems because most households use \nshallow  groundwater,  through  hand  or  motor  pumps,  as  their  main  water  source.  Some  basic \nservices are totally missing in peripheral and under-serviced areas of most towns, where people \nuse  shallow,  brackish  water  or  take  water  from  public  standposts,  where  available.  Sewerage \nsystems are nonexistent and sewage often flows uncontrolled into depressions where it ponds. \nThere is often no organized collection of municipal solid waste. \n \nB. \n\nUrban Sector Institutions \n\n4. \nThe  Punjab  Local  Government  Ordinance  2001  (PLGO  2001)  transferred  responsibility \nfor  delivery  of  municipal  urban  services  and  environmental  improvement  mainly  to  the  tehsil \n(subdistrict)  municipal  administration  (TMAs)  or  district  towns  in  large  cities  (where  district \ngovernments have been renamed City District Governments). Some responsibility rests with (i) \nthe lowest level of local government, union administrations, which are charged with community \ndevelopment  and  related  tasks;  and  (ii)  district  governments,  which  handle  affairs  related  to \ngovernment land as well as the health and education sectors.  \n\n\f \n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n29\n\nImplementation of the PLGO 2001 has considerably reduced the previously dominating \n5. \nroles  of  provincial  agencies,  especially  the  Housing,  Urban  Development,  and  Public  Health \nEngineering  Department  (HUD&PHED),  whose  staff  has  been  transferred  to  local government \nagencies.  \n \n6. \nFor  major  Punjab  cities,  including  Rawalpindi,  special  development  authorities  (DAs) \nwere  set  up  through  the  Development  of  Cities  Act, 1976.  These  authorities,  which  previously \nworked under HUD&PHED, are now fully devolved to the City Districts (CD) to undertake urban \ndevelopment  functions.  A  director  general  heads  DA  and  the  head  of  CD,  the  nazim,  is  the \nchairperson.  In  this  capacity,  the  nazim  provides  general  oversight  of  the  effective  delivery  of \nDA  functions,  including  water  supply  and  sanitation,  which  is  undertaken  through  DA\u2019s  water \nand sanitation agency (WASA).    \n \n7. \nTMAs/towns  and  CDs  are  supervised  by  the  provincial  Local  Development  and  Rural \nDevelopment Departments (LGs), which support and monitor progress in the implementation of \nPLGO  2001,  including  all  required  adjustments  and  improvements  in  institutional  and \norganizational setups, as well as financial management. This department is now the provincial \nagency best suited to steer TMAs in delivery of basic urban services. \n \n8. \nWithin  the  LG,  the  Directorate  General  of  Katchi  Abadi  and  Urban  Improvement  has \nspecific responsibility for resolving problems related to katchi abadis (unauthorized settlements \nor slums on state-owned lands, with little or no infrastructure).  \n \nC. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans \n\n9. \nPakistan\u2019s  national  urban  and  housing  policy  is  reflected  in  the  10-Year  Perspective \nDevelopment Plan 2001\u20132011, which describes the main urban problems as: (i) environmental \ndegradation,  mushrooming  of  katchi  abadis,  and  breakdown  of  infrastructure  and  municipal \nservices; (ii) lack of vision, inadequate institutional setup, and weak financial bases, (iii) backlog \nof  2 million  housing  units,  in  addition  to  2.3  million  units  that  are  structurally  obsolete;  and \n(iv) absence of a housing finance institution to provide affordable loans for house construction. \n \nThe plan envisages the following strategies for urban development: (i) strengthening the \n10. \nrole  of  local  organizations  in  planning,  determining  needs,  preparing  action  plans,  and \naugmenting  capacities  for  water  supply  and  sanitation  services;  (ii)  developing  satellite, \nintermediate or  secondary,  and  industrial  towns  as  employment  centers;  (iii) preparing or \nupdating master plans; (iv) implementing the national policy on katchi abadis; and (v) upgrading \nkatchi abadis and slums through integrated packages for area improvement. \n \n11. \nFor water supply and sanitation, the plan envisages providing (i) water supply services to \nan additional 55 million people (28 million rural and 27 million urban), thus increasing national \nservice  coverage  from  63%  to  84%;  and  (ii)  sanitation  facilities  for  an  additional  54 million \npeople (26 million rural and 28 million urban), thus increasing national sanitation coverage from \n39% to 63%. Private sector participation in water supply for major cities will be encouraged, and \nthe institutional capacity of water supply and sanitation agencies will be upgraded.  \n \n12. \nPakistan\u2019s  National  Housing  Policy,  2001,  acknowledges  the  need  for  development  of \nhousing for the poor and needy. It envisages a strategy that combines community participation, \ninstitutional strengthening, and the development of a commercially oriented system of housing \nfinance. It also emphasizes addressing the problem of katchi abadis, squatter settlements, and \nslums through regulation where appropriate, relocation where required, and urban improvement. \n\n\f  Appendix 3 \n\n30 \n \n\ninfrastructure  projects,  mainly \n\nThe  Government  is  committed  to  increasing  annual  pro-poor  budgetary  expenditures  by \n13. \nthe  current  0.2%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  to  4.0%  of  GDP  in  FY2004.  The  Pakistan \nPoverty  Alleviation  Fund\u2014established  in  1997  to  finance  community  income-generating \nprojects,  microenterprises,  and \nthrough  nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs)  and  the  private  sector\u2014has  begun  lending  activities.  In  April  2000,  the \nGovernment  launched  the  National  Poverty  Alleviation  Programme,  with  the  objectives  of \nstimulating employment and providing basic infrastructure and services to rural and low-income \nurban  areas.  A  new  program  was  initiated  to  rehabilitate  the  poor  by  giving  one-time \nrehabilitation  grants  ranging  from  PRs5,000  to  PRs50,000  from  the  Zakat  Fund.  The \nGovernment  increased  funding  for  a  small  public  works  program,  the  Khushal  Pakistan \nProgram,  which  aims  to  provide  gainful  employment  for  the  poor  and  develop  essential \ninfrastructure  such  as  farm-to-market  roads,  water  supply  schemes,  and  school  repair  in  rural \nand  low-income  urban  areas.  The  Government  also  set  up  the  Khushali  Bank,  Pakistan\u2019s  first \nmicrofinance  bank,  with  financial  support  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)1  in  August \n2001.  The  Government  has  initiated  a  mechanism  for  the  quarterly  tracking  of  antipoverty \nexpenditures on the Finance Division\u2019s website. Most intermediate human development indicators \nare now reported annually.  \n \n14. \nIn  line  with  goals  of  the  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  (PRS),  the  Punjab \nPRS also emphasizes, among key factors to reduce poverty in Punjab, restoration of good \ngovernance, enhancement of public expenditures, improvement in service delivery for social \nsectors, and addressing environmental concerns. \n \nD. \n\nRelevant ADB Strategies \n\n15. \nADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  (2006\u20132008)  for  Pakistan  focuses  on \nsupporting poverty reduction by assisting in the strategic areas of good governance, sustainable \npro-poor  economic  growth,  and  inclusive  social  development.  This  strategy  continues  to  be \nrelevant, and in line with priorities of the new government. ADB lending to devolved sectors will \naim to strengthen devolution by ensuring that future ADB projects are designed to be consistent \nwith the new governance structure under local government ordinances of August 2001. Where \nappropriate, efforts will be made to realign recently approved ADB projects for devolved sectors. \nADB  will  continue  to  emphasize  the  delivery  of  social  services  to  support  (i)  increased  public \nsector  allocations  made  possible  by  enhanced  fiscal  space,  and  (ii)  improved  governance \nthrough  devolution  and  better  sector  administration  and  financial  management.  ADB\u2019s  water \npolicy also supports its poverty reduction strategy by addressing each of the three elements of \nits framework for poverty reduction (pro-poor sustainable growth, social development, and good \ngovernance).  The  main  focus  of  ADB  assistance  to  the  urban  sector  will  be  on  environmental \naspects and the needs of the poor. Assistance will cover, broadly, institutional restructuring and \ndevolution  of  service  delivery,  private  sector  involvement  in  the  delivery  of  selected  services, \nbudgeting  and  finance,  increased  cost  recovery  and  municipal  revenue,  increased  community \nparticipation,  and  attainment  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  To  facilitate \nachievement  of  the  vision,  goals,  and  targets  set  through  the  MDGs,  the  Project  will  develop \nlinkages with strategies being developed by fora like the Global Water Partnership, World Water \nCouncil, and Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council. \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  1999.

A  comprehensive \napproach  should  be  designed  from  a  plan  that \nintegrates  all  aspects  of  urban  infrastructure  and \ninvolves beneficiary participation. \n \n\nWASA  and  TMA  will  be  staffed  with  competent \ntrained  management  and  employees  committed  on \na long-term basis to public service provision. WASA \nmanagement  will  be  given  management  autonomy \nwithout  outside \ninterference.  A  structured  and \nsystematic  program  of  organizational  development \nwill  be  implemented  for  WASA.  Policy  on  tariffs, \nmetering,  non-revenue  water,  and  continuity  of \nmanagement  in  WASA  have  been  clearly  spelled \nout.  Strengthening  of  the  PMU  with  qualified  and \nregular staff has been agreed and made a condition \nfor loan effectiveness.  \n\nfor \n\nloan  negotiation.  To \n\nAdvance  actions  were  agreed  upon  with  regard  to \nthe  establishment  and  staffing  of \nthe  PMU, \nconsultant  recruitment,  and  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  in  the  earliest  stage.  The  Government \nhas  assured  the  appointment  of  a  permanent \nqualified project  director and  this  has  been  made a \ncondition \nfacilitate \nmonitoring  and  timely  resolution  of  project-specific \nissues,  two  committees  will  be  set  up:  (i)  a  project \nat \nimplementation \ntehsil \n(subdistrict) \nto  review \nlevel  will  meet  monthly \nprogress,  and  (ii)  a  project  steering  committee  at \nprovincial level will meet quarterly to provide overall \ncoordination.

Its  main  components  are:  \n(i) environmental sanitation, which includes sewerage, sewage treatment, storm water drainage, \nsolid  waste  management,  slaughterhouse  replacement,  and  public  toilets;  (ii)  water  supply \nimprovement,  which  includes  replacement  of  tubewells,  rehabilitation  and  construction  of \ndistribution systems, water meter installation, and urban infrastructure facilities for schools; and \n(iii)  institutional  development,  including  development  of  municipal  management,  an  urban \nenvironmental development plan, asset management, and urban planning. \n\nThe Project is designed to minimize land acquisition and resettlement impacts. A total of \n2. \n284 hectares (ha) of land is required for the sewage treatment plant (STP), solid waste transfer \nstations, landfill site, and service corridors (right-of-way) for laying trunk sewers and maintaining \nstorm drains. The proposed STP site was chosen because it has less resettlement impacts than \nthe most technically feasible location. Some 197 landowners own 442 plots of land, which will \nbe acquired for the proposed 250 ha STP site. The acquisition will also affect the livelihood of \nan  estimated  36  tenants/agricultural  workers.  The  proposed  solid  waste  transfer  station  and \nlandfill site (32 ha) will be constructed in unencumbered government land. There are two brick \nstructures  occupied  by  transient  brick  workers  in  the  proposed  landfill  site.  To  the  extent \npossible, the sewerage network and storm drain components prioritize rehabilitation of existing \ninfrastructure,  which  avoids  resettlement  impacts.  The  acquisition  of  2  ha  is  required  for  a \n7 meter (m)  service  corridor  for  the sewerage  system  and  an  8\u201310  m service  corridors  for  the \nstorm drains. The sewerage network will partially affect 370 houses and about 28 houses will be \npartially affected by the storm drain subcomponent.  \n\n3. \nThe Project is not expected to cause large-scale relocation of affected people. There are \nno residential structures at the STP site, so no relocation is involved. Of the households affected \nby the sewerage network and storm drain works, impacts for many will be temporary and most \nwill  retain  a  substantial  portion  of  their  landholding,  so  they  will  not  require  relocation.1  The \noverall  resettlement  impacts  will  be  further  minimized  through  careful  component  siting  and \nalignment during detailed design.  \n\nfor \n\nPolicy Framework and Entitlements \n\nA  resettlement  plan  (RP)  has  been  prepared \n\n4. \nthe  Project  (Supplementary \nAppendix D).  A  summary  of  resettlement  impacts  and  key  socioeconomic  information  is  in \nTable A10.1. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nThe  policy  framework  and  entitlements  for  the  Project  are  based  on  national  laws  and \npolicies: (i) Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (amended up to 2003); (ii) National Resettlement Policy, \n2002;  (iii)  Project  Implementation  and  Resettlement  of  Affected  Persons  Ordinance,  2001; \n(iii) Punjab Development of Cities Ordinance, 1981; (iv) Pakistan Environmental Protection Act, \n1997; as well as ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, 1995. The entitlement matrix for the \nProject, based on the above policies, is in Table A10.2. \n\n                                                   \n1  For the storm drain component, it is estimated that more than 70% will not require relocation. \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n39\n\nSewerage \nNetwork \n370 \n2,960 \n10  \n26 \n11 \n370 \n\n2 \n10 \n2 \n0 \n0 \n2 \n\n28 \n225 \n8 \n4 \n13 \n28 \n\nItem \n\nTable A10.1: Summary of Resettlement Impacts \n \nSTPa \n\nLandfill Site \n\nStorm Drain \n\nAffected Households \nAffected Persons  \nNontitled Affected Persons\u2019 Households \nFemale-Headed Households \nVulnerable Affected Persons \nAffected Structures \n\n197 \n1,379 \n36 \n28 \n34 \n8 \ncattle sheds/ \nstorage,  \n27 wells, and \n73 tubewell \nbores \n32 \n137,800 \nAgriculture \n\n7 \n\nAffected Common Property Resources \nAverage Household Annual Income (PRs) \nPrimary Source of Income \nAverage Household Size \n\n0 \n79,000 \nBrick Making \n\n5 \n\n6 \n96,000 \nAgriculture \n\n8 \n\nNil  \n144,000 \nAgriculture \n\n8 \n\nPR = Pakistan rupee/s, STP = sewage treatment plant. \na  Figures for the STP were derived from a socioeconomic survey of 129 households at the STP site conducted by \n\nthe Water and Sanitation Agency (Rawalpindi) in 2005. \n\nSources:  Rawalpindi  Development  Authority  and  Water  and  Sanitation  Agency  (Rawalpindi),  2005.

Focus group discussions \nand meetings were held involving affected households, elected local representatives, councilors \nof concerned union administrations (UAs), and residents living close to the proposed component \nsites.  A  socioeconomic  survey  was  conducted  to  determine  the  potential  impacts  of  land \nacquisition.  Information  has  been  disseminated  to  affected  persons  (APs).  A  local  language \nversion of the summary RP, including the entitlement matrix, has been made available in UAs \nand  posted  on  the  Executing  Agency\u2019s  (EA\u2019s)  website.2  The  RP  will  be  posted  on  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  website,  and  information  dissemination  and  consultation  will \ncontinue throughout project implementation. \n \n7. \nGrievances  of  APs  will  first  be  brought  to  the  attention  of  Musalehat  Anjumans \n(reconciliation  associations  at  the  UA  level  established  to  resolve  disputes)  or  Jirgas \n(noninstitutionalized  systems  comprising  a  UA  head  (nazim)  and  local  elders  who  are \ncollectively  accepted  as  mediators  in  most  disputes),  where  established.  Grievances  not \nredressed by the Musalehat Anjuman or Jirga will be brought by the AP to the grievance redress \ncommittee  (GRC)  through  the  assigned  project  management  unit  (PMU)  social  development \nspecialist.

The incidence of poverty in \nPakistan has risen slowly but steadily from 20.0% to 32.1% over the past 15 years. At present, only 63% of the \ncountry\u2019s  population  has  access  to  safe  drinking  water  (83%  in  urban  areas  and  53%  in  rural  areas).  Proper \nsanitation  facilities  are  available  to  only  39%  of  the  total  population  (59%  in  urban  areas  and  27%  in  rural \nareas).  Poor  access  to  water  supply  and  sanitation  is  often  associated  with  poor  health  conditions. \nConsolidated (federal and provincial) expenditures on water supply and sanitation have actually decreased over \nthe last 5 years, both in nominal terms and as percent of gross domestic product (GDP). As a result, extension \nin  public  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities  have  failed  to  keep  pace  with  the  growing  needs  of  the  rising \npopulation. \n \nThe Government of Pakistan considers poverty alleviation to be a high priority. In 1999, it launched stabilization \nand  a  broad-based  structural  adjustment  program  to  address  severe  macroeconomic  imbalance,  leading  to \nincreased  incomes,  thereby  reducing  poverty.  The  proposed  strategy  focuses  on  poverty  alleviation.  In \nparticular,  it  includes  upgrading  family  welfare  and  improvement  in  drinking  water  supply  and  sanitation \nconditions to increase sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation in rural and urban areas. \nThe  Government  is  encouraging  local  communities  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  to  actively \nparticipate  in  planning,  designing,  implementing,  operating,  and  maintaining  water  supply  and  sanitation \nschemes.  The  function  has  already  been  devolved  to  the  tehsil  (subdistrict)  municipal  administration  (TMA) \nlevel under the Punjab Local Government Ordinance, 2001.  \n \nThe Poverty Partnership Agreement between the Government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) reflects \nGovernment\u2019s  vision  for  poverty  reduction  and  key  priorities  of  ADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update \n2006-2008. ADB\u2019s country strategy for Pakistan emphasizes water supply, sanitation and urban development, \nand the need to target the poor to reduce both poverty and inequality. The Government has agreed that long-\nterm poverty reduction requires sharper focus on good governance, considerable allocation for social sectors, \nand improving basic social services to enhance human development. The Poverty Partnership Agreement also \nfocuses on attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). ADB aims to assist the Government in \nmaking  devolution  a  success  and  improving  service  delivery  and  municipal  services,  with  particular  focus  on \nservices for the poor.   \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  water  to  poor  communities  through  piped  distribution  systems  or  standposts.  The \nenvironmental  sanitation  component  will  provide  for  expanded  sewerage  pipe  networks  to  low-income  areas. \nThe  system  will  be  designed  to  give  the  urban  poor  adequate  access  to  improved  sanitation.  The  expected \nbenefits  are  improvement  in  public  health  situation  and  reduction  of  pollution  of  groundwater.  Improved  solid \nwaste management and recycling, preferably with the involvement of community-based organizations, NGOs, \nand union councils (UCs) will also generate employment for the urban poor (especially women) who work as \nsanitary  workers.  Downstream  of  the  Soan  River,  recycling  of  treated  effluent  for  irrigation  will  help  improve \nagriculture production and enhance poor farmers\u2019 income. \n \nThe  availability  of  safe  drinking  water  and  improved  sewerage  system  will  improve  quality  of  life  and  the \nenvironment in urban areas. Improved public health will increase the productive capacity of the people, many of \nwhom are poor. \n \n\nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTargeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nUntil  recently,  Punjab\u2019s  economy  had  been  based  largely  on  agriculture.  However,  as  growth  prospects  for \nagriculture are limited\u2014largely due to the restricted availability of water suitable for irrigation\u2014the province is \ndeveloping toward a more urban economy and faces high-income inequalities and entrenched poverty with the \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11  47\n\nformation of slums and squatter settlements, and urban environmental degradation. The main factors that have \ncontributed to the rapid rise in overall urban populations are migration from rural to urban areas and extension \nof municipal boundaries.  \n \nUrban  poverty  in  Rawalpindi  is  multifaceted,  ranging  from  underemployment  to  limited  or  inadequate  poor \nquality  water  supply,  lack  of  sanitation  facilities  (with  no  sewerage  system),  limited  solid  waste  disposal,  and \nrundown housing. A socioeconomic survey in five selected localities of Rawalpindi indicates that about 35% of \nhouseholds, with an average family size of 6.5 persons, have a monthly income less than PRs6,000 ($100) per \nmonth,  which  indicates  per  capita  income  far  below  the  poverty  line  of  $1.00  a  day.  The  percentage  of  poor \nhouseholds  among  sample  households  is  almost  50%  in  two  localities  (Dhok  Ratta  Amral  and  Dhok  Illahi \nBaksh), where a significant number of households are engaged in casual labor.  \n \nThe survey also indicates that about 53% of households sampled receive piped water supply for 2\u20134 hours, and \nabout  35%  for  even  less  than  2  hours.  In  Dhok  Ratta  and  Pirwadhai,  water  supply  pipes  are  leaking  and \ncommunity taps are located far from households. In the sample area, about 55% of water carriers are women, \nwhile the rest are young boys or men. About 49% of households make two trips per day to bring water, while \n28% make more than two trips. The supply of water is intermittent and the amount of water available is lower \nthan  requirements.  In  addition,  water  quality  for  drinking  water  in  all  the  surveyed  localities  is  below  World \nHealth  Organization  (WHO)  standards,  mainly  due  to  bacteriological  contamination  as  a  result  of  poor \nsanitation facilities, or the location of tubewells close to main sewage and storm water channels.  \n \nThe  coverage  of  sewerage  system  and  storm  water  drainage  system  in  Rawalpindi  is  limited.  About  64%  of \nsample  households  do  not  have  sewerage  facilities  and  domestic  wastewater  is  carried  in  open  drains  to \nnearby storm water channels. These drains are often clogged with plastic bags and solid waste and streets are \noften flooded with sewerage water. In Rawalpindi, only 36% of sampled households have access to adequate \nsewerage systems.  \n \nIn almost all the surveyed localities, with the exception of Satellite Town, there is no solid waste collection or \ndisposal  system.  Due  to  the  absence  of  an  institutionalized  disposal  system,  entire  solid  waste  is  thrown  in \ndrains and/or open lots, attracting flies and rodents. Households suffer from various degrees of environmental \npollution, through disposal of wastewater in open drains and flooding from drains in residential neighborhoods. \nThere is no wastewater treatment plant in Rawalpindi and raw sewage is disposed in storm water channels that \nultimately fall into Soan River, adversely affecting the population downstream and their source of livelihood\u2014\nagriculture and fisheries. \n \nThe shortage of good quality water and inadequate sewerage systems has an adverse effect on public health \nand  the  urban  environment.  The  survey  in  selected  project  areas  on  the  occurrence  of  cases  of  diarrhea, \nhepatitis, and typhoid suggests that almost 40% of all reported diseases and 30% of all deaths in Rawalpindi \nare attributed to Ecoli\u2014bacteriological and contamination of drinking water. The incidence of these illnesses is \nmuch higher for  poor  people.  Consistent  press reports  about  the  incidence  of  cholera,  typhoid,  hepatitis,  and \ndysentery cases support these figures. \n \nCommunity  Benefit  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Report  on  the  ADB-assisted  Punjab  Rural  Water  Supply  and \nSanitation  Project  shows  that  provision  of  safe  water  and  adequate  sanitation  have  considerably  reduced \nwater-borne diseases from 20% to 3% and expenditure on medicines is reported to have fallen from PRs339 \nper household to PRs180. In addition, the number of children attending school has increased due to increased \nwater  services  to  households.  It  is  expected  that  the  public  health  situation  will  improve  under  the  proposed \nProject,  which  would  contribute  to  reduction  of  water-borne  diseases.  Household  medical  expenses  could  be \nminimized and the savings would improve family welfare. A direct positive contribution of the Project towards \npoverty reduction will be through employment generation in civil works. The Project will also ensure that poor \nhouseholds in low-income areas have access to basic urban services and resources under the Project. \n\nThe Project will address peoples\u2019 needs through: (i) provision of piped water supply; (ii) provision of sewerage \nsystems; (iii) improved access to service providers through sub-offices or complaint offices; (iv) better sanitation \nthrough  provision  of  public  toilets;  and  (v)  good  quality  food  through  better  agricultural  production  in \ndownstream areas and improved quality of meat from the centralized modern slaughterhouse. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\nFor the planning of the proposed components and subcomponents of the Project, a participatory approach was \nadopted  through  consultation  with  the  relevant  stakeholders.  The  NGOs,  community-based  organizations \n(CBOs),  private  and  public  sector  representatives,  and  citizens  attended  three  consultative  workshops  held \nduring project preparation. During project implementation, lessons learned from other successful locally-funded \nprojects (Orangi Pilot Project, Khuda Ki Basti Hyderabad) regarding community mobilization and participation of \nlocal communities in developing urban infrastructure and provision of urban basic services, will be used to plan \nand implement community-level services.  \n \nTo  strengthen  community  participation  in  implementing  project  activities,  the  Project  will  adopt  the  following \nmeasures:  (i)  specific  zone  (ward)-level  committees  composed  of  representatives  from  union  administrations \n(UAs) and CBOs will be formed to manage solid waste collection, (ii) NGOs/CBOs will be selected to conduct \ntraining for planning of sanitation and other activities in their areas, (iii) public service committees will be formed \nto monitor the privately operated toilets constructed under the Project, and (iv) finance management committee \nwill  monitor  outcomes  and  the  impact  of  budget  and  policy  decisions.  Community-level  committees  will  be \nformed to conduct an awareness campaign for solid waste management in their wards and neighborhoods.  \n\nD. \n\nGender and Development \n\nStrategies to maximize impacts on women: \nOver  the  last  three  decades,  some  headway  has  been  made  in  improving  women\u2019s  situation  in  Pakistan. \nHowever, Pakistan ranked 127 out of 162 countries in the 1999 gender-related development index and 100 out \nof  102  countries  in  the  gender  empowerment  measurement.  Women,  especially  poor  women,  are  generally \nvulnerable to gender equality. Specifically, poor women suffer low social status and limited access to economic \noptions  and  social  services.  In  recent  years,  there  has  been  a  significant  attempt  in  promotion  and  use  of \ngender-sensitive approaches in water and sanitation programs at the international level. Given that women are \nmainly  responsible  for  the  collection  of  water,  family  health  maintenance,  and  taking  care  of  sick  household \nmembers,  the  lack  of  adequate  water  supply  facilities  and  sewerage  systems  is  a  great  burden  on  them. \nRecognizing  this  situation  in  the  project  areas,  women\u2019s  active  participation  is  encouraged  in  planning \ncommunity-level water sanitation and sewerage services, local level governance, and project implementation.  \n \nGender  Plan.  The  Project  proposes  to  enhance  the  participation  of  women  from  the  community  and  women \ncouncilors in municipal activities. The Project will facilitate strengthening the role of women councilors in Rawal \nTown (RT) and UAs to work with the project management unit (PMU) and plan water and sanitation services at \nthe ward level. The design features of the Project include the following activities. \n \nCommunity Level. Women groups will be formed at the ward/neighborhood level by participant NGOs/CBOs \nfor social mobilization activities: (i) women councilors from wards/communities will be involved with the PMU in \nplanning infrastructure for water and sanitation services, (ii) women from poor households will be encouraged to \nintroduce recycling and composting, (iii) local sanitation groups will be formed with women from the community, \n(iv) employment opportunities will be created in civil works for interested poor women; (v) women\u2019s groups will \nbe represented in managing new facilities, (vi) women will be the primary beneficiaries of the public health and \nhygiene campaign, (vii) women community volunteers will be developed for the health and hygiene campaign, \n(viii)  employment  will  be  created  for  poor  women  (at  least  20%)  in  the  community-based  solid  waste \nmanagement program. \n \nLocal  Governance.  To  ensure  local  governance  at  RT  and  UA,  following  steps  will  be  taken:  (i)  capacity \nbuilding training  will  be  provided  to  the  elected  women  representatives  of  RT  and  UAs  on  their  role  and \nresponsibilities (if they have not yet received training)  and planning community water and sanitation facilities; \n(ii) a gender sensitization training workshop will be provided for men and women councilors from UAs for better \ncollaboration in preparing the plan of activities for their ward, UA, and RT; (iii) community women leaders and \nwomen councilors in their ward/community-level planning committee will be involved in ward level planning; (iv) \nwomen  councilors  will  be  included  in  various  users  groups,  such  as  lane-level  sewerage  management \ncommittees, solid waste management groups, and public health awareness groups.  \n  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11  49\n\nIn  the  PMU,  women  officials  will  be  recruited  as  professional  staff.  A  national  consultant  on  gender  and \ndevelopment will be included in consulting services to develop a detailed gender action plan to operationalize \nthe gender plan. The detailed gender action plan will include budget, implementation schedule, and resource \nrequirement.  Gender  disaggregated  monitoring  indicators  and  a  database  will  be  developed  (i)  for  the \nmanagement  information  system  (MIS)  and;  (ii)  at  the  UA  and  RT  level  (a)  to  monitor  men  and  women \nbeneficiaries of the Project and, (b) participation of men and women councilors of local bodies in planning and \nimplementation of the Project.   \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\nE. \n\nPotential Issues \n\nItem \n\nSignificant/  \nNot Significant/ \nNone \n\nResettlement  \n\n Significant \n\nAffordability \n\n Significant \n\nEnsure by financial analysis. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n \n\nLand  acquisition  for  the  proposed  sewage  treatment \nplant  (STP)  site  will  affect  197  landowners  and \n36 tenants/agricultural  workers.

To  assess  the \nProject\u2019s sustainability, the overall performance of the operating enterprise\u2014Rawalpindi Water and \nSanitation  Agency  (WASA)  and  Rawal  Town  (RT)\u2014were  also  reviewed.1  Projected  income  and \nexpenditure  statements  and  cash  flows  were  prepared  for  \u201cwithout  Project\u201d  and  \u201cwith  Project\u201d \nscenarios.  FIRRs  were  calculated  over  25  years.  Residual  value  has  been  assumed  in  the  last \nyear and FIRRs have been computed on an after-tax basis. \n \nB. \n\nFinancial Internal Rates of Return  \n\n3. \nFIRRs  were  calculated  for  water  supply,  solid  waste  management,  and  sewerage  and \ndrainage  subcomponents.  These  were  compared  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital \n(WACC)  of  5%.2  The  financial  viability  of  the  proposed  subcomponents  were  assessed  from  the \nperspective of operating entities (WASA and RT), rather than the economy as a whole.  \n \n4. \nAll subcomponents revenues and costs are in constant 2004 prices and on an incremental \nbasis.  Investment  costs  are  derived  from  estimated  costs  less  interest  during  construction. \nRevenue estimates are based on current consumer user charges and their willingness to pay for \nimproved  services,  based  on  socioeconomic  surveys  and  community  consultations  undertaken \nduring  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA).  Survey  results  indicated  a  low \nwillingness  to  pay,  relative  to  affordability  levels,  which  reflects  beneficiaries\u2019  perception  of  RT\u2019s \nand WASA\u2019s lack of capability for effective service delivery. It has been assumed that user charges \nwill  not  be  increased  during  the  construction  period.  After  completion  of  project  works,  user \ncharges will increase by 10% after every 5th year with the exception of the water tariff, which has \nbeen  proposed  to  increase  by  2%  per  year  so  that  clean  water  availability  will  remain  within  the \naffordable level for the large poor segment of society.  \n \n5. \nFIRRs have been calculated conservatively, assuming that the collection efficiency of user \nfees is only 80%, project implementation takes 8 years instead of the planned 5 years, and, in the \ncase of WASA, non-revenue water remains at 50%. Standard sensitivity tests were undertaken to \nassess the robustness of the FIRR calculation. \n\n                                                 \n1   On 24 June 2005, the Governor of Punjab declared eight tehsils (subdistrict) of district Rawalpindi as a city district to \nbe named as City District Rawalpindi (CDR). Rawal Town (RT) is one of the towns of CDR, which covers Rawalpindi \ncity.  According  to  the  Punjab  Local  Governance  Ordinance  (PLGO),  2001,  CDR  has  overall  responsibility  for  urban \nmunicipal services, including WASA and RT. WASA is responsible for water supply and sanitation, and RT is in charge \nof solid waster management. For financial analysis purposes, WASA and RT have been analyzed independently, and \nRT terminology has been used for the former tehsil municipal administration (TMA).   \n\n2   The WACC is 5%, based on funding arrangements and respective weights. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12  51\n\n1. \n\nSolid Waste Management  \n\n6. \nEstimates  of  capital  costs  for  the  solid  waste  management  component  are  based  on \nplanned  investments  for  equipment,  transport  vehicles,  land  for  landfills,  and  civil  works.  Capital \ncost, operations and maintenance (O&M), and replacement costs are based on 2004 prices. Other \nassumptions  are:  (i)  salaries  of  incremental  staff  were  included;3  (ii)  incremental  O&M  expenses \nare 5% of the component cost (excluding land), while diesel and O&M of vehicles are assumed to \nbe  15%  of  the  vehicle  cost;  (iii)  additional  vehicles  will  be  procured  during  the  second  and  fifth \nyears  of  the  implementation  period;  (iv)  vehicles  will  be  replaced  every  10  years;  and  (v)  the \nresidual value of vehicles, based on remaining life at the end of the implementation period, will be \ntreated as cash inflow.  \n \n7. \nAverage  monthly  user  charges  per  household  (based  on  actual  survey  results  for \nwillingness  to  pay)  were  estimated  at  PRs25  (low-income  groups),  PRs35  (middle-income),  and \nPRs50 (high-income). The rates are within the affordability and willingness to pay of households, \nwhich is about PRs25 to PRs50 per household monthly. Population projections are based on the \n1998 census. Household size is seven persons.  \n \n8. \nFinancial  projections  using  cost  and  revenue  assumptions  indicate  that  operation  of  the \nsolid waste management subcomponent is financially viable. Specifically, cash flows generated by \nthe  Project  are  sufficient  to  meet  all  operating  cost  requirements.  Full  cost  recovery  is  achieved \nand  resulting  FIRRs  are  higher  than  the  WACC  (5%  rate of  return).  The  FIRR  of the  solid  waste \nmanagement subcomponent has been calculated as 7.33%  \n \n\n2. \n\nWater Supply \n\n9. \nThe  water  supply  subcomponent  comprises  water  source  development  (tubewells  and \npumps),  water  transportation  and  communal  water  points,  transmission  mains  and  distribution \nsystems, and storage. Currently, WASA is charging flat tariff rates for residential and commercial \nconsumers.  The  existing  tariff  for  house  connections  ranges  between  PRs55  per  month  for  a  \n5-Marla  (21  square  meters)  plot  to  PRs500  per  month  for  a  2-Kenal  (840  square  meters)  plot. \nWhile commercial connections are charged at PRs100 per month for social welfare institutions, up \nto PRs5,000 per month is being charged for gas stations.  \n \n10. \nIt  has  been assumed,  as  planned  under  the  Project,  that  all  water  supply  services  will  be \nmetered  and  payment  for  water  use  will  be  made  on  the  basis  of  the  volume  consumed.  No  flat \nrate tariffs will be allowed. The tariff structure will reflect government policies on water conservation \nand lifeline rates for the urban poor. Therefore, the water tariff has been calculated to ensure the \nsustainability of the proposed Project and affordability for low-income groups. An affordable water \ntariff rate has been estimated based on a demand management study, whereby the average tariff \nmust  be  equal  to  the  average  incremental  financial  cost  (AIFC),  which  has  been  calculated  at \nPRs8.34  per  cubic  meter  (m3).  Tariff  rates  for  low-,  middle-,  and  high-income  groups  have  been \ncalculated  for  cross  subsidization.4  These  tariff  rates  have  been  applied  to  estimate  incremental \nrevenue generated. \n \nThe government of Punjab (PG) has decided that the water connection fee will be reduced \n11. \nfrom  PRs1,500  to  PRs500  for  domestic  consumers  and  from  PRs3,500  to  PRs1,500  for \ncommercial consumers in order to expand the consumer network and reduce illegal connections. \n                                                 \n3   Staff include those working on collection and disposal of solid wastes, such as those working with tractors with bucket \nloaders at landfills, or with tractors for container carriers and transfer trailers. Staff include drivers and sanitary workers \nat sites such as landfills, transfer stations, and container carriers. \n\n4   Low-income  group:  PRs4.38<AIFC=8.34;  middle-income  group:  PRs6.87<AIFC=8.34;  high-income  group:  \n\nPRs13.75>AIFC=8.34. \n\n\f52 \n\n  Appendix 12 \n\nThe water supply tariff is assumed to increase by 2% per annum. O&M costs include expenditures \nfor  salaries,  power,  chemicals,  spare  parts,  and  miscellaneous  expenses.  Only  incremental \nrevenues and O&M expenditures were included in calculating the FIRR.  Since  WASA \nrecently \ncompleted  a  consumer  survey  and  updated  the  consumer  database,  several  thousands  of  illegal \nconnections  have  been  legalized.  Furthermore,  concrete  measures  (such  as  organization \ndevelopment)  have  to  be  taken  to  enhance  revenue  collection  efficiency  and  comply  with  the \nagreed tariff plan. Based on these developments and assumptions, the FIRR for the water supply \nproject was calculated at 6.21%, which is greater than the WACC. \n \n\n3. \n\nSewerage Component \n\n12. \nAverage  monthly  user  charges  per  household  (based  on  actual  survey  results  for \nwillingness to pay) have been estimated at PRs35 (low-income groups), PRs100 (middle-income), \nand PRs200 (high\u2013income). These have been increased by 10% after every fifth year in order to \ncover O&M of sewerage. The rates are within households\u2019 affordability and willingness to pay. The \nFIRR  has  been  estimated  at  2.72%  based  on  the  conservative  assumption  that  only  60%  of \ntargeted  connections  would  be  made,  considering  lessons  learned  in  earlier  projects  in  Pakistan \nsuch as Second Urban Development Project in the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP).   \n \n\n4. \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\nAll  subcomponents  are  considered  financially  viable,  based  on  cost  and  revenue \n13. \nassumptions. Computed net revenues and the FIRR for the base case compare favorably with the \nWACC,  with  the  exception  of  the  sewerage  project.  The  FIRR  base  case  ranges  from  2.72%  for \nsewerage and storm water drainage to 7.33% for the solid waste management subcomponent. The \nFIRR  for  the  water  supply  subcomponent  was  6.21%.

RT  budgets,  actual  revenues,  expenditure  accounts,  and  taxation  schedules  were \nreviewed. \n \n\n1. \n\nRevenues \n\n15. \nRevenues  include  both  current  and  capital  revenues  under  various  revenues  headings. \nTaxes include the urban immovable property tax (UIPT), tax on transfer of immovable properties, \nand tax on television and/or cable. Property and enterprise includes rent from municipal properties, \nand  activities  such  as  transport  stands,  slaughterhouses,  and  cattle  markets.  The  octroi \n(abandoned  local  import  taxes)  compensatory  grant,  which  forms  a  major  part  of  municipal \nrevenues, has been shown separately. \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12  53\n\n2. \n\nRawal Town Current Revenues  \n\n16. \nThe major revenue of the newly devolved RT is from building fees, which contributes about \n13.28% of total revenue, followed by rent of land/property in the city area (about 4.65%), and cattle \nmandi  and  the  general  bus  stand  (5.32%).  The  share  of  current  grants  in  lieu  of  octroi  tax  is \n33.57%  of  total  income  generated  and  UIPT  was  21.25%.  At  present,  RT  is  dependent  on \nsubsidies and grants from PG to meet its expenditure. Different items regarding source of income \nand  expenditure  are  analyzed  to  identify  problem  areas  responsible  for  the  organization\u2019s  weak \nfinancial  position.  Under  the  devolution  plan,  City  District  Rawalpindi  (CDR),  through  WASA  and \nRT, will play a vital role in providing urban services in Tehsil Rawalpindi. The financial profile of RT \nand  WASA  has  been  formulated  to  ensure  their  sustainability,  enabling  them  to  provide  urban \nservices without facing financial constraints.  \n \nA  review  of  income  and  expenditure  accounts,  as  in  the  RT\u2019s  Annual  Budget  2003\u201304, \n17. \nindicates  that  income  generated  from  RT  operations  comprises  building  fees  of  PRs50.0  Million \n(13.28%), tax on transfer of immovable property of PRs23.5 million (6.24%), rent of land/property \nof  city  area  PRs17.50  million  (4.65%),  and  cattle  mandi  and  general  bus  stand  fee  at  PRs20.0 \nmillion  (5.32%).  It  has  been  observed  that  the  low  level  of  RT  income  may  be  attributed  to  the \nfollowing factors: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nTaxes, rates, and fees for various categories have not been revised since 1998. \nUntrained and inefficient staff has negatively affected revenue collection efficiency. \nAccording to the socioeconomic survey, about 90% of people are not satisfied with \nRT operations so they are reluctant to pay user charges \nFurther recovery from rented shops and property is quite low and most shopkeepers \nhave not paid rent since the inception of RT. \n\n \n18. \nA  review  of  the  RT\u2019s  development  budget  shows  that  out  of  the  total  budget  of \nPRs177.52 million,  about  PRs81.60  million  (46.02%)  has  been  allocated  for  payment  regarding \ndevelopment works arrears. A sizeable amount, PRs60.00 million (33.80%), has been allocated for \nthe salary and expenditure of education, health, and library staff, although PLGO 2001 states that \nthis  is  the  responsibility  of  the  district  government.  The  salary  of  RT  staff  is  PRs260.00  million \n(72.23%) of non-development budget allocations. \n \n\n3. \n\nImprovement of Rawal Town Financial performance \n\n19. \n\nPG has agreed to comply with the following recommendation. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nIn order to enhance RT\u2019s income, a comprehensive survey must be undertaken to \ncollect census data regarding rented shops and property. \nAll taxes, rents, and fees must be adjusted based on the escalation of energy and \ngasoline charges, which are subject to frequent increases. \n\n(iii)  Capacity building of institutional and financial management staff is required to \n\nenhance the working efficiency of RT. \n\n(iv)  Arrears in development works may be deferred until RT become sustainable. \n(v) \n\nExpenditure of education, health, and library staff may be excluded from the RT \nbudget and transferred to CDR, in accordance with PLGO 2001. \n\n \n20. \nThe projected income statement and fund flow statement for RT have been prepared. The \nmain  assumptions  for  construction  of  the  income  statement  and  fund  flow  statement  are  stated \nbelow. \n \n21. \nUrban  Immovable  Property  Tax.  Information  has  been  obtained  from  the:  (i)  PG  excise \nand taxation staff at CDR, and (ii) Provincial Finance Department. The higher figure for 2003\u201304 \n\n\f54 \n\n  Appendix 12 \n\nhas been taken as the base for the UIPT. This has been increased by considering increases in the \nnumber of properties in future. A departmental survey by the Excise and Taxation Department is \nconducted every 5 years, which results in a major increase in the assessment/collection of UIPT. In \nline with the usual results of these surveys, UIPT projections have been increased by 25% every \nfifth year, although some cities have increased from 50% to 100%. \n \n22. \nTax  on  Transfer  of  Immovable  Properties.  The  actual  revenue  collection  contract  has \nbeen  taken  as  the  base  for  tax  on  transfer  of  immovable  properties  (TOTP),  which  has  been \nincreased by 25% per year. The rates for levy of stamp fees and registration fees is fixed/revised \nby district revenue authorities every 3 years, which results in an increase in TOTP. Projections of \nTOTP have been increased by 25% in the fifth year to give the effect of this increase in property \nvalue, although the actual increase is usually much higher. \n \nUser  Charges.  Budgeted  user charges  of  2003\u20132004  have  been  considered  as  the  base \n23. \nline.  User  charges  have  been  increased  at  10%  per  year  until  2015,  after  which  they  have  been \nincreased by 3% per year.  \n \nInter  Government  Transfers.  Following  considerations  have  been  made  regarding  the \n24. \ninter government transfer: (i) The entire amount of grant for salary and non-salary expenditure of \nstaff of the decentralized departments has been considered to be utilized for RT operations and not \nfor the RT area; (ii) development grants received by RT have been allocated on a per capita basis \nto  the  population  of  the  RT  area,  the  actual  development  grant  received  by  RT  for  2003\u201304  has \nbeen  taken  as  the  base,  and  this  has  been  increased  by  10%  per  year;  (iii)  the  actual  amount \nreceived by RT as octroi compensatory grant during FY2004 has been considered as the baseline \nand has been increased by 10% per annum\u2014this compensates a revenue source of the defunct \nRawalpindi Municipal Corporation (RMC), so it has been shown separately in these projections. \n \n25. \nIn  the  \u201cwith  project  cash  flow  projections\u201d,  incremental  salaries  and  O&M  expenditure \n(including  repairs  and  utilities)  for  the  proposed  interventions  have  been  included  in  the \nexpenditures. The cash flows show that RT will have sufficient cash to meet all its expenditures as \nwell  as  a  surplus.  Actual  results  would  be  better  because  of  the  institutional  development  and \ncapacity building component of the Project. A number of recommendations with action plans have \nbeen  made  for  revenue  enhancement,  expenditure  control,  transparency,  and  good  governance: \n(i) including display of unit costs to improve transparency, (ii) improvement in budgeting, records, \nand (iii) monitoring of O&M expenditures to reduce costs and wastage. \n \nD. \n\nFinancial Position of WASA \n\n26. \nFollowing  the  creation  of  WASA  in  1992,  assets  relating  to  water  and  sewerage  of  the \ndefunct RMC were transferred to WASA, its staff was trained, a management information system \n(MIS)  was  established  and  made  functional,  and  other  major  actions  were  taken  satisfactorily.  It \nhas  been  observed  that  actual  income  generated  through  WASA\u2019s  sources  was  in  excess  of \nestimated income for FY2001 and FY2002 due to WASA\u2019s increased efforts in initiating quarterly \nbilling  and  establishing  a  well-organized  bill  distribution  system.  In  addition,  in  order  to  improve \narrears recovery, an enforcement section was created in WASA with the assistance of the senior \nspecial  magistrate  and  police  contingent.  However,  during  2003-2005,  most  WASA  performance \nindicators  have  worsened,  including  financial  management,  resulting  in  reduced  efficiency  in  all \nareas.  This  is  mainly  due  to:  (i)  frequent  changes  in  upper  management,  (ii)  high  turnover  of \ntrained  staff,  (iii) appointment  of  inexperienced  and  less  qualified  staff  in  designated  disciplines, \nand (iv) above all, lack of follow-up by the PG for sustained WASA operations.  \n \n27. \nDuring the phase 1 project, the collection efficiency of water and sanitation bills increased \nfrom  51%  in  FY1999  to  61%  in  FY2001  but  decreased  to  44%  in  FY2004.  Arrears  of  PRs28.4 \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12  55\n\nmillion in FY1999 increased to PRs77.4 million in FY2003. WASA has recently launched a serious \ncampaign to collect and reduce these arrears. Recovery staff has been increased, inefficient staff \nremoved, and complaint cells are now fully functional. Agreement has been reached that WASA\u2019s \ncollection efficiency will be improved to 80% by March 2006 and non-revenue water will decrease \nfrom the current estimated 40% to less than 15% by September 2006. To achieve these targets, \nactions  related  to  recruitment  of  qualified  staff,  establishment  of  three  additional  complaint  cells, \nand a more aggressive disconnection policy will be implemented. It has been agreed that WASA \nwill outsource collection of water bills during FY2007. \n \nE. \n\nPolicy Guidelines for Sustainability of WASA \n\n28. \nBased  on  WASA  budget  analysis  and  interviews  conducted  with  relevant  authorities,  the \nfollowing  policy  has  been  approved  by  the  PG  for  the  improvement  of  WASA\u2019s  financial \nperformance. WASA will be staffed with competent trained management and employees committed \non  a  long-term  basis  to  public  service  provision.  WASA  management  will  be  given  autonomy  to \nmanage  without  outside  interference.  WASA  shall  publish  for  the  public  an  annual  report  on  its \noperations  and  development  each  year.  A  structured  and  systematic  program  of  organization \ndevelopment will be implemented for WASA. \n \n\n1. \n\nWater Supply and Sanitation Policy \n\nThe long-term goal is that tariffs will cover O&M costs, capital costs, and debt servicing for \n29. \nall water supply and the O&M costs of all sewerage. WASA will meet O&M costs for water supply \nand  sanitation  through  enhancement  of  collection  efficiency  and  increase  in  tariffs  by  the  end  of \n2006.  \n \n30. \nTariffs will not be imposed beyond the affordability of consumers and they will be gradually \nincreased  with  increase  in  the  level  of  service.  WASA  will  try  to  become  a  self-sustainable \norganization. WASA is making all efforts to improve collection efficiency and revenue collection has \nincreased substantially in 9 months, from January to September 2005. \n \n31. \nCollection  efficiency  of  tariffs  must  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of  3  months  of  billings. \nDisconnections for nonpayment will be enforced. Privatization and user-friendly computerization of \nbilling and collection will be introduced. Billing and collection will be conducted on a monthly basis. \nWASA  has  already  computerized  its  revenue  and  accounting  system  and  computerized  bills  are \nbeing issued to consumers. However, monthly billing requires more resources. \n \nAll water supply services will be metered and payment for  water use will be made  on the \n32. \nbasis  of  volume  consumed.  No  flat  rate  tariffs  will  be  allowed.  The  tariff  structure  will  reflect \ngovernment policy on water conservation and lifeline rates for the urban poor. These reforms will \nbe fully implemented by the end of 2006. \n \n33. \nInstallation of  water  meters  is in  progress  out of  19,000  domestic  and  commercial  meters \nprocured under the phase I project and 10,000 water meters have already been installed. WASA \nhas recently started billing based on meter reading for metered supply. However, all connections \nwill be completed upon procurement and installation of another 50,000 meters under the Project. \n\n\f  Appendix 13 \n\n56 \n \n\n \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\n1. \nThe proposed Rawalpindi Environmental Improvement Project is aimed at increasing urban \nservices such as water supply, sewerage, drainage, and solid waste disposal in the project area. \nEconomic analysis has been developed to provide a framework to evaluate all aspects of project \nactivity  in  a  coordinated  and  systematic  way.  The  purpose  of  the  economic  analysis  is  to  foster \nbetter  allocation  of  scarce  resources.  Analysis  has  been  undertaken  separately  for  each  of  the \nfollowing five project components: water supply, sewerage facilities, sewage treatment plant, storm \nwater  drainage,  and  solid  waste  management.  Standard  methodology  has  been  used.  Under  the \nProject, all water supply services will be metered and payment for water use will be made on the \nbasis of the volume consumed\u2014a major innovation in managing urban water supplies in Pakistan. \nThis will involve a significant change in tariffs, which could significantly reduce water use. During \nproject  implementation,  an  international  consultant  with  expertise  in  public  economics  will  be \nappointed to reassess the tariff policy, recommend improvements based on that assessment, and \nupdate demand forecasts based on projected tariffs. The updated demand forecasts may identify \npotential  cost  savings,  increasing  the  actual  net  benefits  of  the  Project  relative  to  estimates \nreported in this appendix. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\nSavings  in  health  expenditure  due  to  improvement  of  public  health  and  reduction  in  the \n\nCurrent  and  future  water  demand  for  domestic  and  nondomestic  consumers  of  the \n2. \nRawalpindi  Water  and  Sanitation  Authority  (WASA)  areas  has  been  assessed  on  the  basis  of \n28 gallons  (gal)  per  capita  per  day;  demand  for  adjacent  rural  localities  is  estimated  at  31  gal. \nFuture  water  supply  and  sewerage  connections  for  domestic  and  nondomestic  categories  have \nbeen estimated based on the population of the above areas. \n \n3. \nincidence of water- and sewerage-borne diseases has been assessed for the Project. \n \n4. \nThe total billing of receipts against urban services has been computed on the basis of the \nprojected  number  of  connections  under  \u201cwith  Project\u201d  and  \u201cwithout  Project\u201d  conditions.  Collection \nefficiency was used to establish a summary of total water receipts under \u201cwith Project\u201d and \u201cwithout \nProject\u201d conditions. The difference is taken as a measure of the incremental project benefits. \n \nThe sewage treatment plant will produce 199,000 m3/day of treated wastewater (2015) per \n5. \nyear, which needs to be adjusted for an estimated 15% conveyance loss in bringing it to the fields. \nA value of PRs4,850 per 123 m3 of water has been used to calculate the economic benefits of the \nsewage  treatment  plant.  The  benefits  foregone  to  the  economy  due  to  the  construction  of  the \nsewage  treatment  plant  have  been  added  to  the  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  cost  for  the \neconomic analysis. \n \n6. \nThe improvement of drainage, solid waste management facilities, and other urban services \nwould result in enhanced property value in the city area. The incremental share of the property tax \nfor WASA and tehsil municipal administration (TMA) has been computed on the basis of property \ntax assessment for various categories in the area. Sanitation tax received by TMA has also been \ntabulated. \n \nC. \n\nEconomic Cost \n\n7. \nThe  analysis  uses  the  domestic  price  numeraire,  excludes  taxes  and  other  market \ndistortions,  includes  standard  conversion  factor,  and  is  undertaken  in  constant  May  2005  prices, \nand  benefits  are  non-tradable  in  nature.  The  capital  costs  for  all  components  are  estimated  at \nPRs4,587 million. The total investment cost in economic terms is PRs4,209 million. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n57\n\nResults of Economic Evaluation \n\nD. \n \nTo  judge  the  economic  viability  of  the  Project,  economic  indicators  such  as  net  present \n8. \nvalue (NPV), benefit cost ratio, and economic internal rate of return (EIRR) have been calculated. \nThe economic analysis will guide the Executing Agency on implementation of similar projects in the \nfuture.  The  results  assume  a  12%  discount  rate  as  indicated  in  Table  A13.1.  The  results  of  the \nurban  services  projects  are  economically  viable  as  the  EIRRs  for  the  subprojects  fall  within  an \nacceptable range for social sector projects. \n\n \nTable A13.1: Results of Economic Analysis \n\nEconomic \nIndicators \n\nWater \nSupply \n\nSewerage \n\nDrainage \n\nSWM \n\nOverall \nProject \n\nNet Present Value \n(PRs million) \nBenefit/Cost Ratio \n\nEIRR (Base Case) \n\n498.9 \n\n50.5 \n\n63.1 \n\n194.7 \n\n1142.4 \n\n1.99:1 \n\n21.6% \n\n1.03:1 \n\n12.4% \n\n1.3:1 \n\n1.45:1 \n\n1.8:1 \n\n1.3:1 \n\n15.8% \n\n16.8% \n\n21.1% \n\n15.8% \n\nSewage \nTreatment \nPlant \n329.6 \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, SWM = solid waste management. \nSource:  ADB.  2003.

Nevertheless, implementation decisions regarding public utility projects, such as provision of \nsolid waste management, cannot be based purely on EIRR results. \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nSUMMARY ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT \n\nKey Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n \n1. \nAn  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was  prepared  for  the  proposed  Rawalpindi \nEnvironmental  Improvement  Project  (the  Project).  This  summary  focuses  on  the  Project\u2019s  key \nenvironmental impacts and mitigation measures, and environmental management plans.  \n \nA. \n \nWater Quality. The groundwater table in Rawalpindi has sharply depleted over the past \n2. \n20  years.  Provision  and  rehabilitation  of  new  tubewells  will  consider  the  overall  impact  that \nfurther  water  extraction  would  have  on  the  local  water  table  and  existing  tubewells.  Detailed \nengineering  design  will  undertake  modeling  and  provide  calculations  to  establish  an  optimal \nextraction  rate.  Selected  aquifers  should  be  suitable  for  water  consumption  and  contain \nsufficient  resources.  Water  testing  will  be  undertaken  in  all  cases  by  the  Public  Engineering \nHealth Department. At the proposed sewage treatment plant (STP) site, lining and sealing of the \nbase and sides of the ponds with high-quality, impermeable material will be ensured during the \ndetailed  design.  Protection  embankments  will  be  provided  to  prevent  flooding  of  the  STP  and \nsewage  overflow  from  the  stabilization  ponds.  Effluent  from  the  proposed  STP  is  designed  to \nmeet national standards. The Project includes a comprehensive water quality monitoring plan, \nand  onsite  laboratory  facilities.1  Construction  and  operation  of  a  larger  slaughterhouse  will \ngenerate  additional  biological  waste,  which,  if  improperly  managed,  could  contaminate \nwatercourses and spread communicable diseases. Collection, treatment, and disposal systems \nfor different types of slaughterhouse wastes are an integral part of the design.2  \n \nAir  Quality.  Unmanaged  air  pollution  from  construction  may  create  nuisance  and,  in \n3. \nextreme cases, adverse health impacts and property damage. Mitigation measures will include \n(i)  operating  construction  vehicles  within  agreed  time  periods,  (ii)  covering  wagons  and  skips, \n(iii)  enclosing  demolition  sites,  (iv)  spraying  dusty  roads,  (v)  maintaining  moisture  on \nconstruction materials, (vi) covering transportation and garbage vehicles, (vii) controlling vehicle \nspeed,  (viii)  selecting  transportation  routes  to  minimize  impact  on  sensitive  receptors,  (ix) \ncovering exposed soil or storage areas, (x) limiting excavation and land leveling works to rainy \nseason,  and  (xi)  minimizing  the  onsite  storage  time  of  construction  material.  All  vehicles  and \nconstruction  machinery  will  be  operated  in  compliance  with  prescribed  vehicle  emission \nstandards and engines will be properly maintained to reduce air pollution from exhausts and oil \nspills.  \n \nThe proposed landfill is expected to produce certain amounts of toxic gases3 that could \n4. \ncreate  nuisance  and  health  hazards  for  nearby  communities  if  they  are  not  appropriately \ncontrolled.  Mitigation  measures  proposed  include  provision  of  proper  soil  cover,  buffer  zone, \nplantation and an adequate gas control system. Methane monitoring will be essential, especially \nconsidering  the  close  proximity  of  brick  kilns.  Odor  from  open  stabilizations  ponds  will  disturb \n\n                                                 \n1  The STP is designed to treat municipal sewage from the city. Its operational efficiency and life could be seriously \naffected by the ingress  of any industrial/hazardous  waste. Although Pakistan\u2019s environmental legislation prohibits \nsuch  practices,  implementation  and  monitoring  are  weak.  Municipal  authorities  have  committed  to  address  this \nissue  by  preventing  the  issuance  of  sewage  discharge  permits,  exerting  tight  control,  and  issuing  heavy  fines  to \nviolators. \n\n2  Environmental  monitoring  and  compliance  mechanisms  will  be  built  into  the  structure  of  the  slaughterhouse \nmanagement and a waste management plan developed during detailed design will be endorsed and implemented \nprior to slaughterhouse operation. \n\n3  Primarily methane and carbon dioxide; and small quantities of hydrogen sulfide, carbon monoxide, and ammonia \n\nas a result of solid waste decomposition.  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14   59\n\nneighboring  areas  when  the  STP  is  operating.  Odor  control  measures  will  be  based  on  an \nimpact assessment during detailed design. Proper operation and maintenance of the plant\u2014and \nmitigation measures such as tree planting and development of a greenbelt as a buffer zone\u2014\nwill be required to minimize odor. \n \n5. \nGeology and Soils. Project design will ensure against soil erosion and damage to water \nquality  resulting  from  construction  works  by  immediate  resurfacing  and  stabilizing  newly \nexposed surfaces and cuts. Wherever possible, surplus earth and spoil material from excavation \nwill be used to produce bricks, to mix with cement, or to build embankments for the STP site. \nSurplus material will be appropriately disposed of in designated areas. Engineering design and \nconstruction  will  include  a  detailed  geological  study  that  will  carefully  consider  topography, \nfaults,  and  any  other  soil  characteristics  to  ensure  safe  practices.  The  contractor  will  provide \nsatisfactory  treatment  and  disposal  of  solid  and  liquid  wastes  at  the  work  site  and  workers\u2019 \ncamps  to  prevent  soil  degradation,  pollution,  and  abuse  of  natural  resources.  Adequate \nmonitoring and mitigation of complaints from the community will also be undertaken.  \n \nA drainage system for upper areas of the STP will be developed during detailed design. \n6. \nSludge will be sampled and tested to ensure compliance with agricultural standards and if toxic \nmaterials  are  found  in  the  dry  sludge,  municipal  authorities  will  consider  safe  underground \ndisposal and the significant cost increases associated with treatment. \n \n \n7. \nChange  in  Land  Use.  The  proposed  site  for  the  STP  is  currently  used  to  grow  food \ncrops  and  vegetables.  The  proposed  STP  requires  a  large  surface  area  and  will  significantly \nchange  the  present  land  use,  degrade  aesthetics  of  the  area,  and  depress  property  value. \nThese  impacts  will  be  permanent,  but  intensity  will  be  minimized  with  suitable  landscaping, \nplanting, and vegetation.4  \n \n8. \nEcosystems.  Mitigation  measures  are  required  to  limit  sediment  concentration  during \nconstruction  which  can  affect  aquatic  habitat,  minimize  construction  noise  which  can  disturb \nwildlife  and  birds,  minimize  impacts  on  human  settlements,  and  minimize  effects  on \necosystems.  The  Project  will  significantly  improve  aquatic  environments  by  treating  sewage. \nTree  plantation  at  the  proposed  landfill  and  STP  sites  will  be  undertaken  to  enhance  the \nappearance  of  the  sites  and  provide  a  natural  buffer.  This  will  enhance  soil  retention  and \nerosion control, providing an aesthetic and visual screen against sound, dust, toxic emissions, \nnight glare, and pollution of watercourses. Preference will be accorded to indigenous species to \nensure their adaptability to the natural ecosystem.  \n \nB. \n \n9. \nEnvironmental  management  plans  (EMP)  have  been  formulated  for  the  proposed  STP \nand landfill site. They will serve as guidelines for municipal authorities, selected contractors, and \nother  parties  involved  in  mitigating  potential  environmental  impacts.  Regular  environmental \nmonitoring  will  be  carried  out  and  results  will  be  used  to  evaluate  the  actual  extent  of  the \nenvironmental impacts, performance of the environmental protection, prevention and mitigation \nmeasures,  compliance  with  rules  and  regulations,  and  overall  EMP  effectiveness.  A \ncomprehensive  EMP  will  be  prepared  for  every  component  during  detailed  design.  During \nreview  missions,  ADB  will  assess  environmental  compliance  by  the  Project  Management  Unit \n(PMU),  authorities,  and  communities.  To  ensure  that  contractors  comply  with  the  EMPs,  the \nfollowing specifications should be incorporated in all construction bidding procedures: (i) a set of \n                                                 \n4  Land acquisition and resettlement impacts are discussed in Appendix 10. \n\nEnvironmental Management Plans \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nenvironmental prequalification conditions for potential bidders, (ii) a list of environmental items \nto  be  budgeted  by  the  bidders  in  their  proposal,  (iii)  environmental  evaluation  factors  for  bid \nreviewers, (iv) environmental clauses for contract conditions and specifications, (v) full EIA for \ncompliance, and (vi) ADB\u2019s environmental procurement guidelines.  \n \n10. \nThe executing agency for the Project will be the Rawalpindi Development Authority. The \nPMU will be responsible for overall coordination, planning, implementation, and management of \nall  project  activities.  Private  contractors  will  execute  subprojects  and  be  responsible  for \nimplementing  environmental  mitigation  measures.  The  PMU,  with  the  assistance  of  the \nenvironmental consultant, will supervise and monitor compliance.5 During the operation phase, \nthe  TMA  will  be  responsible  for  compliance  and  monitoring  of  environmental  mitigation \nmeasures  for  the  proposed  landfill  site  and  slaughterhouse,  while  the  Rawalpindi  Water  and \nSanitation  Agency  will  ensure  compliance  and  monitoring  of  mitigation  measures  for  the \nremaining  subprojects.  The  Punjab  Environmental  Protection  Department  may  check  at  any \npoint whether activities comply with national environmental legislation and monitor enforcement \nof recommendations for environmental mitigation measures as prescribed in the EIA.6  \n \nC. \n \n11. \nThe  Project  will  result  in  substantial  environmental  benefits  including  improved  ground \nand surface water quality, as well as improved solid waste and sewage collection and treatment. \nThis will significantly improve health and quality of life in Rawalpindi, as well as agriculture and \nfishing in the Soan River downstream. \n \nPredicted adverse significant impacts have been identified. Some impacts are minor and \n12. \neasily  mitigated,  while  others  could  potentially  be  significant,  long  term,  and  irreversible  if \nmitigation  measures  and  monitoring  plans  are  not  enforced.  In  this  regard,  draft  EMPs  and \nmonitoring  plans  have  been  developed  for  finalization  during  detailed  design  based  on \nrecommendations  documented  in  the  summary  EIA  (Supplementary  Appendix  F).  ADB  will \nreview the finalized EMPs. Since all project components are still at the preliminary design stage, \nthe EIA and EMP need to be updated based on the final engineering design. The revised EIA \nand EMP will be submitted to ADB for concurrence. \n\nConclusions \n\n                                                 \n5  As  part  of  the  consulting  services  provided  to  the  PMU  under  this  Project,  an  environmental  engineer  with  good \nknowledge of water treatment, disposal, and solid waste management will be engaged on a full-time basis for the \nduration of the Project. In addition, environmental monitoring and occupational health and safety services training \nwill be provided as part of the training requirements provided in the EMPs. \n\n6  The government of Punjab is committed to providing at least one environmental engineer and one environmental \nscientist  for  the  STP  every  shift  of  operation.  The  engineer  will  undertake  environmental  compliance  and  day-to-\nday  running  of  the  wastewater  treatment  plant  and  effluent,  the  scientist  will  conduct  discharge  analysis  and \ngeneral environmental onsite monitoring. \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 29 October 2005) \n", "Currency Unit \nPRe1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Pakistan rupee/s (PRe/PRs) \n$0.0167 \nPRs60 \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", "ADB \nADF \nAIFC \nAP \nCBO \nCCB \nCD \nCDR \nCO \nDA \nDPAC \nEA \nEMP \nEIA \nEIRR \nFIRR \nGDP \nGIS \nGRC \nHUD&PHED \n", "IA \nICB \nIEE \nIS \nLAC \nLCB \nLG \nLIBOR \nm3/day \nMDG \nmld \nNGO \nNRW \nO&M \nOCR \nP&D \nPDP \n", " \nABBREVIATIONS \nAsian Development Bank \nAsian Development Fund \naverage incremental financial cost \naffected person \ncommunity-based organization \ncitizen community board \ncity district \nCity District Rawalpindi  \nchief officer \ndevelopment authority \ndistrict price assessment committee \nexecuting agency \nenvironmental management plan \nenvironmental impact assessment \neconomic internal rate of return \nfinancial internal rate of return \ngross domestic product \ngeographic information system \ngrievance redress committee \nHousing,  Urban  Development,  and  Public  Health  Engineering \nDepartment \nimplementing agency \ninternational competitive bidding \ninitial environmental examination \ninternational shopping \nland acquisition collector \nlocal competitive bidding \nLocal Government and Rural Development Department \nLondon interbank offered rate \ncubic meters per day \nMillennium Development Goal \nmillion liters per day \nnongovernment organization \nnon-revenue water \noperation and maintenance \nordinary capital resources \nplanning and development \n10-Year Perspective Development Plan \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "PG \nPHED \nPLGO \nPMU \nPPMS \nPPTA \nPRS \nRAC \nRCB \nRDA \nRMC \nRP \nRT \nSDR \nSDS \nSEIA \nSOE \nSTP \nTA \nTMA \nTOTP \nUA \nUC \nUNDP \nUNICEF \nWACC \nWASA \nWHO \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", " \n", "government of Punjab \nPublic Health Engineering Department \nPunjab Local Government Ordinance \nproject management unit \nproject performance management system \nproject preparatory technical assistance \npoverty reduction strategy \nresettlement advisory committee \nRawalpindi Cantonment Board \nRawalpindi Development Authority \nRawalpindi Municipal Corporation \nresettlement plan \nRawal Town \nspecial drawing rights \nsocial development specialist \nsummary environmental impact assessment \nstatement of expenditures \nsewage treatment plant \ntechnical assistance \ntehsil municipal administration \ntax on transfer of immovable property \nunion administration \nunion council \nUnited Nations Development Programme \nUnited Nations International Children\u2019s Fund \nweighted average cost of capital \nWater and Sanitation Agency \nWorld Health Organization \n \nGLOSSARY \n", "katchi abadi  \u2013 \n", " \ndistrict   \n", "nazim   \ntehsil \n", "\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n  \n", "A district as notified under the Punjab Land Revenue Act, 1967.  \nPunjab province consists of 34 districts. \nAn  unauthorized  settlement  on  state-owned  land  of  more  than  40 \ndwellings, without land rights or physical and social infrastructure services \nand facilities \nHead of city district or a town, or tehsil, or union administration. \nA tehsil as notified under the Punjab Land Revenue Act, 1967. \nPunjab has 122 tehsils. \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", "(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 30 June.  \n", "In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n"]}
