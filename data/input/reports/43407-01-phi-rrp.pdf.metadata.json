The  report  also \ndescribes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  grants  for  Capacity  Development  for  Social \nProtection, and  Strengthened  Gender  Impacts  of  Social  Protection,  and  if  the  Board  approves \nthe proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the \nTA grants. \n \n2. \nThe  project  will  support  the  Government  of  the  Philippines  in  implementing  and \nexpanding  its  social  protection  agenda,  especially  the  conditional  cash  transfer  (CCT) \nprogram\u2014Pantawid  Pamilyang  Pilipino  Program1 (4Ps)  and  the  national  household  targeting \nsystem  for  poverty  reduction  (NHTS-PR).  The  associated  capacity  development  TAs  will \nsupport  capacity  development  and  institutional  strengthening  of  the  government  for  efficient \nimplementation  of  the  social  protection  agenda. 2  The  project  is  included  in  the  Philippines \ncountry operations business plan, 2010\u20132012.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nDespite high economic growth over the past 6 years, poverty incidence in the Philippines \nincreased from 30% in 2003 to 33% in 2006. Key causes of poverty include high inequality and \nchronic  underinvestment  in  physical  and  human  capital,  especially  health  and  education.  As  a \nresult, the Philippines is lagging on progress in meeting the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) \ntargets  for  universal  primary  education,  maternal  mortality,  and  access  to  reproductive  health \nservices.  Net  enrollment  in  elementary  school  declined  from  99.1%  in  1990  to  83.2%  in  2007. \nOnly 70% of students who enter grade 1 stay until grade 6, and one in five children 6\u201311 years old \nare  not  in  school.  Universal  immunization  against  measles  has  not  yet  been  achieved  and \nmalnutrition  remains  a  major  concern,  with  only  64%  of  children  meeting  normal  weight-for-age \nstandards. Maternal mortality rates remain high at 162 per 100,000 live births in 2006.  \n \nGovernment estimates indicate that about 45% of Filipinos are vulnerable to falling into \n4. \npoverty  if  confronted  by  external  shocks  such  as  family  health  problems  and  deaths,  loss  of \nemployment,  natural  disasters,  and  price  increases. 4  In  2007\u20132008,  escalating  food  prices \ncontributed to a 9.45% reduction in the average standard of living and an increase of more than \n50%  in  the  severity  of  poverty.5 In  the  absence  of  appropriate  safety  nets,  households  have \ndeveloped  coping  mechanisms  to  external  shocks  that  tend  to  erode  human  capital  and \nperpetuate  poverty,  such  as  increasing  working  hours,  changing  eating  patterns,  withdrawing \nchildren from school, or foregoing critical health care.   \n \nDemand-side  constraints,  such  as  financial  barriers  and  lack  of  awareness  of  the \n5. \nimportance  of  human  capital  investment,  are  key  constraints  to  utilization  of  health  and \neducation services by the poor. Although many public health services are free, health facilities \n\n                                                 \n1   Building Bridges for the Filipino Family Program. \n2   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  to  the  Philippines  for \n\nSupport for Conditional Cash Transfers (approved 21 December 2009).  \n\n3   ADB. 2009.

Manila: ADB.  \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nlack  of  policy  and \n\nare often located in areas not easily accessible to poor families, leading to high transport costs. \nThe  average  cost  for  travel  to  health  facilities  is  P109  per  visit,  while  outpatient  treatment  is \nP1,872 per person.6 Nearly half of the health care costs are paid out-of-pocket, and 79% of poor \nhouseholds have no insurance coverage. The poor are often unable to afford basic health care \nsince out-of-pocket payments are required at the point of services. For education, demand-side \nfactors are the main determinants of enrollment. Among girls 7\u201312 years old, the main reasons \nfor being out of school are high associated costs and lack of interest. From 2002 to 2007, the \nnumber of out-of-school youth rose markedly for children 13\u201316 years old, reaching more than \n20%  in  many  regions.7 The  leading  causes  were  high  cost  of  education  (particularly  for  girls), \nlack of personal interest (particularly for boys), and working or looking for work. \n \n6. \nGovernment efforts to address poverty and improve human development outcomes have \nbeen compromised by low spending on social sectors, particularly social assistance programs. \nIn  2009,  national  government  spending  on  social  services  was  only  5.9%  of  gross  domestic \nproduct. Spending on social protection was even lower at only 1.2%, although it has increased \nfrom an average of 0.8% in 2005\u20132007. The social protection sector has been characterized by \ninstitutional  coordination,  with  several  departments  undertaking \na \nuncoordinated, and sometimes ineffective, programs. Benefits have been further compromised \nby weak targeting systems to identify beneficiaries and high leakages to the non-poor. \n \nTo  respond  to  these  challenges,  the  government  recently  increased  its  focus  on \n7. \nreforming  and  strengthening  its  social  protection  system.  The  reform  agenda  led  by  the \nDepartment  of  Social  Welfare  and  Development  (DSWD)  includes  (i)  accelerating  social \nprotection  policy  reform;  (ii)  improving  targeting  of  programs;  (iii)  expanding  the  CCT  program \nand  strengthening  delivery  mechanisms,  including  governance  systems  and  monitoring  and \nevaluation;  and  (iv)  securing  adequate  and  predictable  financing  for  social  protection  by \nconsolidating programs and gradually expanding overall budget allocation. The reform agenda \nis well under way and significant government ownership is demonstrated through a doubling of \nthe  social  protection  budget  since  2007.  The  budget  of  DSWD,  which  has  the  primary  role  in \ndelivering  social  protection  services,  has  more  than  tripled  since  2007;  these  increases  are \nsustained through the medium-term expenditure plan, 2010\u20132014.  \n \nThe cornerstone of the social protection reform effort is the CCT program (4Ps). The 4Ps \n8. \nprovides  cash  grants  to  poor  households  based  on  their  fulfillment  of  health-  and  education-\nrelated  conditionalities.  The  program  pilot  was  launched  in  2007  with  6,000  beneficiary \nhouseholds in four municipalities and two cities. Results from the pilot showed that from 2007 to \n2009,  school  enrollment  and  attendance  rates  increased  significantly,  elementary  school \ncompletion  rates  increased  from  67.5%  to  73%,  the  number  of  children  who  received \ndeworming  pills  increased  by  21.4%,  the  number  of  fully  immunized  children  increased  by \n26.2% and the number of women who completed prenatal visits increased by 45.4%.8 The 4Ps \ngradually expanded to 341,000 households in 2008 (set 1), 666,000 households in 2009 (set 2), \nand aims to reach 1 million households in 2010 (set 3).9  \n \n9. \nThe  4Ps  directly  addresses  poverty  through  the  provision  of  cash  grants,  while \nsimultaneously  reducing  long-term  poverty  through  increased  investments  in  human  capital,  a \n                                                 \n6   National Statistics Office. 2008.

Set  1:  341,000  households,  set  2:  325,000  households,  set  3:  currently  at  257,995 \nhouseholds.  Sets  are  defined  by  poverty  ranking  (poorest  municipalities  phased  in  first).  The  program  is \nnationwide, and covers the poorest households in 733 municipalities in 80 provinces. \n\n\fkey  factor  in  addressing  intergenerational  poverty.  Cash  transfers  help  meet  the  direct  and \nindirect costs of health care and schooling, as well as reduce the incentive to remove children \nfrom school to work. The program also promotes utilization of education and health services and \nother positive behavior changes through family development sessions focusing on responsible \nparenthood, health and nutrition, and education.  \n   \n10. \nSeveral  development  partners  have  helped  develop  and  are  supporting  the  evolving \nsocial  protection  reform  agenda.  The  World  Bank  is  providing  a  $405  million  loan.  The \nAustralian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID)  provided  grant  support  for  the \ndevelopment  of  the  good  governance  and  anticorruption  aspects  of  the  4Ps,  monitoring  and \nevaluation,  and  improved  auditing. 10  The  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  provided \nsupport for the CCT program through the Development Policy Support Program (DPSP) 311 and \nfiscal stimulus support in 2010. In addition, Japan and the Republic of Korea provided TA for the \n4Ps through the World Bank; the United Nations Development Programme supports the policy \nagenda; and the United Nations Children's Fund is in current discussions with DSWD to support \nthe 4Ps.  \n \n11. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  a  key  partner  in  the  social  protection  reform \nagenda.  The  three  DPSPs  in  2007,  2008,  and  2009  supported  policy  dialogue  on  social \nprotection  reform,  including  improved  targeting  and  poverty  orientation  of  public  spending. \nDPSP  2  and  DPSP  3  provided  support  for  piloting  and  scaling  up  the  4Ps.  In  addition,  fiscal \nstimulus  support  under  the  Countercyclical  Support  Facility 12 (2009)  included  increasing  the \ncoverage of the program.13 ADB and the government have had continuous dialogue through the \nPhilippines  Development  Forum  subgroup  on  social  protection  and  ADB-organized  large \nregional conferences on social protection in 2009 and 2010.  \n \n12. \nThe  proposed  project  will  assist  the  government  in  implementing  its  development \nstrategy  and  social  protection  reform  by  supporting  the  NHTS-PR  and  the  4Ps.  This  is \nconsistent  with  ADB's  support  for  the  Medium-Term  Philippines  Development  Plan  and  the \nmutual objectives of higher pro-poor sustainable growth and MDG attainment. The support has \nsignificant  potential  for  leveraging  key  improvements  in  the  Philippines'  social  protection \nportfolio, including improved targeting, reduced leakage, and rationalization and consolidation of \nexisting programs. The ADB assistance will provide additional support to strengthen the gender \nand indigenous peoples aspects of the 4Ps. \n \nB. \n \n13. \nThe impact of the project will be reduced income poverty and non income poverty. The \noutcome will be increased consumption and utilization of education and health services among \npoor households and women beneficiaries of the 4Ps.  \n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n                                                 \n10  These include support for the NHTS-PR, grievance redress, compliance verification; monitoring and spot checks; \nimproved  audits;  and  institutional  strengthening.  AusAID  is  currently  developing  a  TA  facility  for  DSWD  and \ndevelopment partners to provide technical and analytical support for the CCT program. \n\n11  ADB. 2009.

This  output  will  support  implementation  of  the  NHTS-PR  as  a  standardized \ntargeting mechanism for identifying poor households. The NHTS-PR targets poor households in \ntwo  steps:  (i)  selection  of  poor  provinces  and  municipalities  based  on  poverty  incidence \naccording to the family income and expenditure survey and small area estimates; (ii) use of a \nproxy  means  test  methodology  to  predict  household  income  on  the  basis  of  education, \nsocioeconomic  characteristics,  housing  conditions,  access  to  basic  services,  assets,  tenure \nstatus,  and  regional  variables.  The  information  to  calculate  the  proxy  means  test  is  collected \nthrough  household  assessments,  encoded  online  regionally  and  transmitted  to  DSWD \nnationally. The lists of poor households are validated in community assemblies and through spot \nchecks and cross-checking with the family income and expenditure survey data.  \n \n16. \nDSWD  is  implementing  the  NHTS-PR  nationwide  and  is  planning  to  assess  about \n8.3 million  households.  Experience  from  the  4Ps  pilot  shows  that  the  targeting  system  has \nperformed  well,  with  an  inclusion  error  of  less  than  10%.15 When  finalized,  it  will  constitute  a \nhomogenous  and  transparent  mechanism  to  identify  poor  households  and  a  nationwide \ndatabase that can be used by various national and local social protection and poverty reduction \nprograms.  An  executive  order  issued  in  March  2010  requires  all  government  agencies  to  use \nthe system for household targeting of poor households in their programs. \n \n17. \nOutput  2:  Conditional  health  and  education  cash  grants  provided  to  poor \nhouseholds.  This  output  will  partially  finance  conditional  health  and  education  grants  in \nselected  poor  provinces,  municipalities,  and  cities.  Beneficiary  households  are  selected  using \nthe  NHTS-PR  and  validated  for  eligibility. 16  DSWD  pays  the  transfers  to  mothers  and/or \npregnant  women  of  eligible  households,  who  will  receive  the  cash  grants  for  up  to  5  years \nsubject  to  the  eligibility  criteria  and  compliance. 17 Transfers  are  paid  quarterly,  directly  into \nwomen  beneficiaries'  accounts  established  in  the  Land  Bank  of  the  Philippines. 18 The  4Ps \nincludes  two  types  of  transfers:  one  related  to  health  and  one  to  education.  A  computerized \ncompliance verification system will verify compliance with conditionalities.19  \n \n18. \nPoor households with children 0\u201314 years old and/or pregnant women are eligible for a \nhealth grant currently set at P500 ($11) per household per month (for 12 months per year). The \nconditionalities  are:  (i) all  children  0\u20135  years  old  attend  the  health  center  to  obtain  services \nestablished by the Department of Health (DOH) according to their age, including immunizations; \n(ii) pregnant  women  attend  the  health  center  according  to  DOH  protocol,  including  delivery  by \n\n                                                 \n14  The World Bank loan is financing the 4Ps in set 1 areas, covering around 341,000 households.  \n15  The percentage of non-poor  households  included in the  program. In comparison, programs in Latin America and \nSouth Asia have inclusion errors of around 30%. These errors tend to increase as programs scale up due to higher \ndensity of poverty in pilot areas.  \n\n16  Eligible households are those included in the NHTS-PR database with children 0\u201314 years old and/or a pregnant \n\nmother. \n\n17  In households with no mother, the grant is paid to another responsible adult in the family (father, grandparent).  \n18 In some cases, over the counter payments are done if there is a long distance to the nearest bank branch or when \n\nissuance of cash cards is delayed.  \n\n19  This entails associating beneficiaries with schools and clinics, recording attendance, encoding attendance through \na computerized system, and linking such data to the payment system. Beneficiaries who repeatedly do not comply \nwith the conditions will be suspended from the program following an established sanctions procedure.   \n\n\fskilled  personnel  and  postnatal  care;  (iii)  children  6\u201314  years  old  comply  with  deworming \nprotocol  at  schools;  and  (iv)  the  household  grantee  (mother)  and/or  spouse  attend  family \ndevelopment sessions at least once a month.  \n \nPoor households with children 6\u201314 years old are eligible for the education grant.20 The \n19. \neducation  transfer  is  P300  ($7)  per  child  per  month  (for  10  months  per  year),  for  up  to  a \nmaximum of three children. Beneficiary households will receive the education transfer for each \nchild from 6 to 14 years of age as long as they are enrolled in primary or secondary school and \nmaintain a class attendance rate of at least 85% every month.  \n \nEligible  households  can  receive  both  the  health  and  education  grants.21 The  average \n20. \ntransfer  per  household  is  estimated  at  23%  of  the  average  annual  household  income.  This \nproportion  is  in  the  range  of  those  used  in  successful  CCT  programs  in  Latin  America,  where \ngrants  provided  a  sufficient  incentive  for  families  to  utilize  health  services  and  send  their \nchildren to school, while being low enough to avoid distorting labor market decisions.22  \n \n21.  Meeting the supply-side requirements and monitoring compliance are the responsibilities \nof  DOH,  the  Department  of  Education,  and  local  government  units  (LGUs). 23 A  supply-side \nassessment is done  to assess health and education systems, identify gaps and needs, if any, \nand  corresponding  solutions  and  recommendations  to  enable  4Ps  beneficiaries  to  meet  the \nconditionalities of the program.24 Anecdotal evidence suggests that several LGUs are increasing \ntheir investments in health and education services as a result of these supply-side pressures.  \n \n22. \nOutput 3: Strengthened capacity for conditional cash transfer program operations. \nThis  output  will  provide  capacity  development  and  support  for  all  key  national  and  local \nmanagement  activities  in  the  4Ps,  including  household  registration,  compliance  verification, \npayment  management,  organization  of  assemblies  of  grantees,  and  strengthening  of  gender \nand indigenous peoples aspects.  \n \nOutput  4:  Improved  systems  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  social  protection \n23. \nprograms.  This  output  will  support  the  implementation  of  a  management  information  system \nthat will cover all steps in the operation of the 4Ps. It will also support monitoring and evaluation, \nincluding (i) spot checks to monitor 4Ps implementation; (ii) monitoring and evaluation studies;25 \nand  (iii)  regular  monitoring  and  reporting,  including  quarterly  and  annual  reviews,  and  internal \naudits.  It  will  also  support  the  operation  of  a  grievance  redress  system,  featuring  a  publicly \naccessible  grievance  database  to  track  and  resolve  complaints,  including  targeting  errors, \npayment irregularities, fraud, and corruption.   \n \n\n                                                 \n20  DSWD is also implementing cash grants to households with children 3\u20135 years old that regularly attend day care or \n\npreschool. Based on further study, ADB will consider including support for these grants at project midterm. \n\n21  The maximum transfer a household can receive is P15,000 per year for 5 years.  \n22  In  Mexico  (Oportunidades),  the  transfer  is  about  21%  of  total  annual  household  expenditures;  in  Colombia \n(Familias en Accion), about 15% of the minimum wage; and in Nicaragua (Red de Proteccion Social) about 17% of \nthe total annual household expenditure. Impact evaluations of these programs show significant positive impacts on \nfamily  investments  in  children\u2019s  human  capital.  A  very  low  transfer,  such  as  in  the  Honduras  CCT  program \nrepresenting less than 5% of average per capita consumption, showed less impact on families\u2019 human capital. \n\n23  Responsibilities  of  each  department  are  described  in  a  joint  memorandum  circular.  Coordination  is  governed  by \nnational, regional, and municipal advisory committees, and by a memorandum of agreement that clarifies lines of \nauthority and responsibility between DSWD and participating LGUs. \n\n24 In the event that a barangay is not prepared to meet the supply-side requirements, the LGU will be given 6 months \n\nto address the problem(s) before program implementation may start. \n\n25  This  will  include  qualitative  evaluation  studies  and  impact  evaluation.  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  are  exploring \n\ncollaboration on a rigorous impact evaluation using regression continuity methodology.  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\nD. \n \nThe overall government program has a total estimated cost of $1.29 billion26 from 2009\u2013\n24. \n2014.  The  World  Bank  is  financing  one-third  of  the  program  with  a  loan  of  $405  million \n(approved  in  2009),  the  proposed  ADB  loan  will  finance  one-third,  and  the  government  will \nfinance one-third.  \n \n25. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $884.2  million.  The  government  requested  a  loan  of \n$400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR) to finance the project.27 The loan will \nhave a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  and  a \ncommitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  annum.  The  government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the \nreasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  based  on  these \nterms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own  independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. ADB will finance \n45.2%  of  the  project  cost  and  the  government  will  provide  counterpart  financing  of  54.8% \nincluding taxes and duties, and financing changes. The government will allocate the counterpart \nfunds of $484.2 million mainly to cover a share of the household grants, capacity building, and \nadministrative  costs.28 The  financing  plan  is  in  Table  1  and  the  project  investment  plan  is  in \nTable 2. \n\nTable 1: Financing Plan \n\nTotal \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment of the Philippines \n  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \nTable 2: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \n\n  \n\nTotal \n  400.0 \n  484.2 \n884.2 \n\n  % \n  45.2 \n  54.8 \n100.0 \n  \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nB. \n\n \nBase Costb \n1.

The  project  will  support  the  national  project \nmanagement offices of the NHTS and 4Ps, both of which are established and operating. DSWD \nand  the  regional  project  management  offices  have  overall  responsibility  for  implementing  the \nprogram.  Municipal  links  are  hired  to  work  with  beneficiary  households,  and  the  LGUs  are \ndesignating at least one full-time staff for the 4Ps.  \n \nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n27. \nthe project administration manual. To ensure efficient project implementation, joint supervision \nmissions will be undertaken by the government, ADB, and the World Bank.  \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\n \nAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated project completion date  30 September 2015 (loan closing date: 31 March 2016) \nProject management \n(i)   Oversight body \n\nArrangements \nOctober 2010\u2013September 2015 \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies \n(iv)  Project implementation unit \nProcurement \nConsulting services \n\nRetroactive financing  \n\nDisbursements  \n\nDSWD executive committee; secretary of DSWD (chair); all undersecretaries \nand assistant secretaries, DSWD (members) \nDSWD \nDSWD, DSWD regional offices (16)  \nNPMO (NHTS): 20 staff; NPMO (4Ps): 109 staff \n6 contracts \nShopping \n$578,000 \n1 contract \nQuality- and cost-based selection  \n$500,000 \n4 contracts \nFixed budget selection \n$400,000 \n$500,000 \n5 contracts \nSingle-source selection \n$1,961,095 a \n2,931 person-months \nIndividual consultant system \nNHTS, 4Ps cash grants for education.

The outcome will be strengthened capacity of DSWD to implement the \nsocial protection reform agenda. The TA will have four outputs: (i) strengthened and accelerated \nimplementation  of  the  computerized  verification  system;  (ii)  improved  capacity  for  monitoring \nand evaluation, including civil society monitoring, and implementation of the grievance redress \nsystem;  (iii)  review  of  the  NHTS-PR  aimed  at  facilitating  the  rollout  of  the  system  to  other \ngovernment agencies; and (iv) a study on integration of early childhood care and development \ninto  the  4Ps.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1  million,  of  which  $800,000  will  be  financed  on  a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  The \ngovernment will provide $200,000 equivalent (in-kind) as counterpart support.  \n \n29. \nADB  will  also  administer  TA  to  (i)  undertake  participatory  gender  audits  of  the \nimplementation  processes  and  impact  of  the  4Ps;  (ii)  design  community-driven  and  municipal \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\ngender  action  plans  based  on  the  specific  needs  of  beneficiaries;  (iii)  provide  grants  to \nmunicipalities  to  operationalize  the  gender  action  plans;  and  (iv)  prepare  knowledge  products \nrelated to management of gender in the CCT program. The TA is estimated to cost $425,000, of \nwhich $300,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Gender and Development Cooperation  \nFund.29 The government will provide $125,000 equivalent (in-kind) as counterpart support. \n \n30. \nPolicy  advisory  TA  to  support  the  policy  agenda  for  rationalization  and convergence  of \nsocial  protection  programs  will  also  be  prepared.30 The  TA will  (i) formulate  and implement  an \naction plan for rationalization and coordination of social protection programs; (ii) build national \nand local institutional capacity to support the social protection reform agenda; and (iii) support \nDSWD  in  establishing  a  referral  system  for  the  poorest  population,  linked  to  the  national \nhousehold targeting system.31  \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \nInclusive  growth  in  the  Philippines  has  been  constrained  by  gaps  in  human  capital \n31. \ninvestment,  which  are  largely  driven  by  demand-side  factors.  Evidence  of  CCTs  globally \nsuggests  the  4Ps  can  effectively  (i)  address  short-term  poverty  and  vulnerability;  and \n(ii) improve  education  and  health  outcomes,  leading  to  longer-term  gains  in  productivity  and \nbreak  down  of  intergenerational  poverty  traps.  Accurate  targeting  will  maximize  the  direct \nbenefits of the 4Ps grants. The project is also expected to significantly increase the efficiency of \ngovernment  investments  in  poverty  reduction  and  social  protection.  Simulations  suggest  that \nmainstreaming the NHTS-PR could decrease leakage under three other programs by enough to \noffset the annual cost of 4Ps grants to at least 780,000 households. Even without such savings, \ngiven the government's strong commitment to the 4Ps and NHTS-PR, and the relatively modest \nsize  of  the  programs  (with  annual  costs  estimated  at  0.7%  of  the  budget  and  0.17%  of  gross \ndomestic product), project benefits are considered to be financially viable and sustainable.   \n\n \nGovernance \n\nB. \n \n32. \nAt the country level, lack of effective sanctions coupled with limited public accountability \nand political interference requires robust systems for corruption prevention and redress. At the \nproject  level,  DSWD  is  considered  an  anticorruption  champion  in  the  government.  A  2009 \nintegrity  development  review  of  DSWD  via  technical  assistance  from  AusAID  and  the  World \nBank found that DSWD has several control mechanisms in place to minimize corruption risks. \nSignificant  progress  has  been  made  in  addressing  gaps  in  accounting  and  auditing.  The \nintegrity development review also identified gaps that need attention to improve governance and         \nmitigate corruption risks, including (i) adherence to budgeting, accounting, and auditing rules; (ii) \nimproved  risk  assessment  and  mitigation;  and  (iii)  corruption  risk  management  through \npartnership with anticorruption nongovernment organizations (NGOs). \n \n33. \nLike most CCT programs, the 4Ps presents particular implementation challenges from a \ngovernance perspective, including its large scope and high volume of financial transactions; its \nengagement  of  multiple  government  agencies;  and  many  project  locations  in  remote  areas. \nHowever, these challenges are paired with some key advantages, including being implemented \nby a champion department with regard to anticorruption; a very small amount of procurement, \nreducing  the  prospects  of  corruption;  direct  payment  to  beneficiary  bank  accounts,  reducing \n                                                 \n29  Contributors: the governments of Canada, the Netherlands, and Norway. \n30  This TA will be processed separately from the loan.  \n31  The system will involve tracking 4Ps beneficiaries to facilitate referral to complementary services. \n\n\fopportunities of local intervention; and inclusion of strong anticorruption mitigation measures in \nthe  project  design.  These  include  (i) interagency  governance  structures  from  national  down  to \nmunicipal levels; (ii) beneficiary targeting based on objective, poverty-based criteria; (iii) robust \nmonitoring  and  audit  systems,  including  spot  checks,  and  civil  society  oversight;  and                \n(iv)  transparency  and  accountability  through  public  information  campaigns  and  a  grievance \nredress  system.  To  ensure  that  these  measures  are  well  implemented,  DSWD  is  hiring \nadditional 4Ps staff and intensifying its training activities. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with DSWD. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \n\n \nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nC. \n \nPoverty  and  social  impacts. Improved survival, health, and education of children and \n34. \nwomen  are  direct  benefits  of  the  project.  Better  health  and  education  utilization  will  promote \nemployability  and  productivity  of  the  next  generation  of  workers.  Regular  and  reliable  cash \ntransfers over 5 years will help promote savings and enable households to invest in livelihood-\nenhancing  activities  and  facilitate  their  movement  out  of  poverty.  The  project's  support  for  the \nNHTS-PR will ensure that a standardized and transparent mechanism and database is in place, \nand  facilitate  identification  and  targeting  of  poor  families.  The  project  will  strengthen  DSWD's \ninstitutional  management  and  administrative  capacity  to  scale  up  the  4Ps,  contributing  to \nDSWD's effectiveness in delivering social welfare programs. \n \n35. \nGender  impacts.  Women  are  a  main  target  group  of  the  4Ps.  Key  gender  issues  that \nthe project will address include (i) low utilization of health care by women, especially obstetric \nand  maternal  care;  (ii)  high  infant  morbidity  and  mortality,  and  their  effects  on  women's  work \nburdens; (iii) insufficient allocation of resources for the health and education of female children; \n(iv)  intrahousehold  gender  roles  and  control  over  resources;  and  (v)  poor  women's  limited \naccess  to  income  and  economic  resources.  The  gender  action  plan  (i)  ensures  that  bank \naccounts  are  opened  in  women's  names;  (ii)  supports  training  of  women  on  citizenship  and \nrights,  domestic  violence,  leadership,  child  care,  and  nutrition;  (iii)  targets  70%  attendance  of \nfathers  in  specially  designed  modules  on  gender-responsive  family  practices  and  the  role  of \nfathers  as  caregivers;  (iv)  encourages  linkages  with  NGOs  and  other  service  providers  to \nsupport  access  to  complementary  services;  (v)  develops  staff  capacity  on  gender  issues;  and \n(vi) ensures integration of gender equality indicators in the monitoring and evaluation system. \n \nD. \n \nThe project includes about 9,000 indigenous peoples household beneficiaries, who are \n36. \namong  the  poorest  and  most  marginalized  households  in  the  Philippines.  The  project  will \nsignificantly  improve  the  health,  education,  and  income  status  of  these  households.  Key \nmeasures  include  (i) information  and  training  provided  to  indigenous  peoples  in  a  form \nappropriate to their language and cultures; (ii) working with indigenous leaders and local NGOs \nto  mobilize  indigenous  households  to  participate  in  the  program;  (iii)  seeking  transport \nassistance for indigenous peoples through coordination with LGUs or NGOs; (iv) targets of 10% \nindigenous women and 12% indigenous peoples total for municipal link positions in indigenous \nareas;  and  (v)  sensitivity  training  and  coaching  to  all  4Ps  staff.  The  project  is  classified  as \ncategory  B  for  indigenous  peoples,  and  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  and \nenvironment, in accordance with the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \n \nE. \n \n37.
