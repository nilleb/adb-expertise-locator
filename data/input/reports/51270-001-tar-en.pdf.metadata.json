Responding to these urgent needs \nand demands for urban services, and the urgency to address ongoing densification in ger areas, \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  a  multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  totaling \n$163.70  million  on  12  December  2013  for  the  Ulaanbaatar  Urban  Services  and  Ger  Areas \nDevelopment  Investment  Program. 1  The  9-year  implementation  period  (December  2013\u2013\nDecember  2022)  comprises three tranches  of multisector  interventions that  support  delivery  of \nthe  Ulaanbaatar  City  master  plan  in  upgrading  priority  infrastructure  services  and  developing \neconomic hubs (subcenters) in ger areas. Tranche 1 of the MFF2 is supported by this technical \nassistance (TA) and focuses specifically on two priority subcenters of Bayankhoshuu and Selbe. \nThe  expected  outcome  is  a  network  of  livable,  competitive,  and  inclusive  subcenters  in \nUlaanbaatar\u2019s ger areas; and the outputs include (i) roads and urban services are expanded within \nthe  targeted  subcenters,  and  connectivity  between  them  is  improved;  (ii)  economic  and  public \nservices in targeted subcenters are improved; (iii) service providers become more efficient; and \n(iv) institutions and capacity for urban development, program management, and service delivery \nare strengthened.    \n \n2. \nThe design of the MFF, and specifically of Tranche 1, took into account international best \npractices in the upgrading and redevelopment of urban areas. The investments were identified \nthrough mapping initiatives and were prioritized to improve access to basic infrastructure services \nfor ger area residents. The interventions make significant efforts to engage and involve local ger \nresidents  on  an  ongoing  basis  (from  design  to  implementation).  Consultations  and  public \nmeetings  have  been  conducted  to  solicit  the  views  and  concerns  of  beneficiaries,  including \nwomen  and  vulnerable  groups,  and  integrate  these  into  the  detailed  design.  In  addition,  the \nMFF helps  build  social  fabric  and  improves  livelihood  potential  in  these  communities  through \ncommunity-based organizations such as community development councils (CDCs) and small and \nmedium-sized  enterprise  (SME)  development  councils  (SDCs).  These  efforts  help  enhance \ntransparency  and  build  trust  among  relevant  stakeholders\u2014the  community,  municipality,  and \nprivate sector\u2014in support of the common goal of ger area redevelopment. \n \n3. \nTranche 1 was approved on 17 December 2013 and became effective on 24 September \n2014. Procurement activities are well underway and all civil works are expected to be substantially \ncompleted by the loan closing date in December 2019. The program management office (PMO) \nis capable and performing well. The government\u2019s commitment to, ownership of, and support for \nthe program and its roadmap are high. \n \n\n                                                \n1   ADB.  2013.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Multitranche \nFinancing Facility to Mongolia for the Ulaanbaatar Urban Services and Ger Areas Development Investment Program. \nManila.  \n\n2   ADB.  2013.  Ulaanbaatar  Urban  Services  and  Ger  Areas  Development  Investment  Program:  Periodic  Financing \nRequest 1. Manila. Tranche 1 includes a $27.5 million ordinary capital resources loan, a $22.5 million concessional \nordinary capital resources loan, and a $3.7 million grant from the Urban Environmental Infrastructure Fund under the \nUrban  Financing  Partnership  Facility.  The  total  counterpart  funding  is  $96  million,  and  is  complemented  by  \n$60.3 million in equivalent cofinancing from the European Investment Bank. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nA. \n\nJustification \n\nII. \n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nto  apply \n\nInternational  experience  has  demonstrated  potential \n\ninformation  and \n4. \ncommunication technology (ICT) to urban upgrading and redevelopment efforts. In these projects, \nICT solutions can offer support to (i) better collect and present data on physical infrastructure and \nsocioeconomic  characteristics  of  urban  areas;  (ii)  facilitate  communication  and  trust-building \namong  the  government,  communities,  and  investors;  (iii)  enhance  and  expedite  information \nsharing  to  larger  audiences;  and  (iv)  better  monitor  and  present  development  results. \nUnderstanding  these  advantages,  the  Municipality  of  Ulaanbaatar  (MUB)  is  seeking  to  pilot \nappropriate ICT innovations  in  promoting redevelopment  of  Ulaanbaatar\u2019s  ger  areas  at  a  small \nscale, before replicating success to all ger areas.  \n \n5. \nTranche 1 provides an ideal environment to pilot ICT applications for urban redevelopment \nin ger areas, thanks to the extensive preparation work carried out in urban planning, community \nengagement,  as  well  as  economic  and  infrastructure  development.  Under  Tranche  1, \ncomprehensive data on the ger areas of Bayankhoshuu and Selbe subcenters has been collected \nthrough poverty analysis and mapping, community profile survey, community needs assessment, \nand business profile survey. Based on these data, block development methodology and land use \nplans have been formulated, subcenter infrastructure and spatial plans revised, and subcenter \nurban development and business plans developed. Community-based CDCs and SDCs in each \nsubcenter  have  actively  engaged  the  local  ger  area  residents  to  formulate  community  and \nbusiness action plans. The PMO has developed extensive experience in designing, implementing, \nand  monitoring  infrastructure  development  in  ger  areas  with  a  set  of  detailed  baseline  data. \nTogether these achievements are a foundation of reliable data, rich content, and strong capacity \nto facilitate ICT applications. \n\n \nICT  applications  will  not  only  benefit  from  the  readiness  under  Tranche  1  but  will  also \n6. \ncontribute  to  enhance  the  development  objectives  of  Tranche  1.  The  TA  will  pilot  a  set  of \ncustomized ICT tools in the targeted ger areas, such as (i) an interactive mapping application for \nland  use  and  development  planning;  (ii)  ICT-supported  community  outreach  and  information \ndisclosure;  (iii)  e-guidelines  and  support  for  SME  development;  (iv)  a  transparent  and  efficient \nplatform to enhance awareness and visibility for ger areas infrastructure development, promote \ninvestment opportunities in ger areas, and enhance synergies among stakeholders in the public \nsector,  the  private  sector,  and  the  communities;  and  (v)  a  computerized  project  performance \nmanagement system. These ICT tools will introduce innovative ways to carry out existing tasks \nand hopefully enhance efficiency and effectiveness of the Tranche 1 interventions. The linkages \nbetween TA outputs and development objectives of Tranche 1 are detailed below. \n\n \nIn  April  2017,  the  MUB  submitted  a  request  for  support  from  ADB  and  the  Republic  of \n7. \nKorea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund  to  pilot  ICT  applications  for  ger  area \nredevelopment  activities  under  Tranche  1.  Since  this  request  came  after  the  approval  of  the \ncountry operations business plan (COBP) for Mongolia, 2017\u20132019,3 the TA was not included in \nthe COBP. The funding from the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund for \nthis TA was approved on 1 June 2017. \n \n\n                                                \n3  ADB. 2017.  Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2017\u20132019. Manila. The COBP was published in April \n\n2017. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 October 2017.  \n\n \n\n\fB. \n\nOutputs and Activities  \n\n8. \nThe TA will pilot ICT tools for ger area redevelopment in (i) enhancing municipality-level \nurban  and  redevelopment  planning  with  mapping  and  monitoring  indicators  (output  1); \n(ii) supporting  inclusive  community  engagement  and  access  to  economic  opportunities  in  ger \nareas,  (outputs  2  and  3);  and  (iii)  strengthening  redevelopment  monitoring  and  coordination \ncapacity (output 4).  \n \nOutput 1: Ger area urban and redevelopment planning enhanced. Building on the rich \n9. \ndata  collected  through  mapping  exercises  under  Tranche  1,  this  TA  will  apply  easy-to-use \nICT tools to map physical and socioeconomic characteristics of selected ger areas to enhance \ndata quality and presentation. The information collected will be integrated with the existing urban \ndatabase  in  Ulaanbaatar.  In  addition,  expert  recommendations  will  be  provided  to  MUB  to  \n(i) enhance the urban database with key indicators to support evidence-based planning, (ii) create \na monitoring mechanism for eco-district development for green housing and infrastructure, and \n(iii) integrate appropriate ICT outputs into future infrastructure investments.  \n \n10. \nOutput 2: Community engagement process supported. Effective communication and \ninformation sharing have been recognized as being key in enhancing transparency and building \ntrust between government and residents. The MFF has made significant efforts in this regard by \nworking with CDCs, which are well-positioned to act as community conveners. This output will \nsupport efforts under the Tranche 1 by providing customized community outreach activities\u2014both \nphysical and virtual\u2014to engage the community with the project. These activities will take place at \nbusiness  incubator  centers  (BICs)  to  be  constructed  for  the  Bayankhoshuu  and  Selbe \nsubcenters.4  This output will also develop a virtual platform to facilitate community action planning \n(e.g., for urban upgrading, feedback, and grievance redress mechanisms), and place ICT kiosks \nin  BICs  for  access  by  and  use  of  ger  area  residents.  The  platform  and activities  will  take  into \nconsideration the specific characteristics of the ger area community in order to reach the widest \npossible audience and help them mobilize and learn together as a community. This will leverage \nthe thriving community of nongovernment organizations in Ulaanbaatar, especially women\u2019s and \nyouth groups.  \n  \nOutput  3:  Business  and  investment  development  support  services  in  ger  areas \n11. \nenhanced. Tranche 1 has a provision to help create economic opportunities in ger areas, focusing \non demand (by raising investment interest among investors), and supply (by building the relevant \nskills, both vocational and entrepreneurial, of ger residents). This output will build on Tranche 1 \nactivities  to  provide  (i)  prioritized  ICT-based  support  under  BICs,  including  e-guidelines  for \nselected government services; (ii) integrated support for SMEs, including ICT and business skills \ntraining, hands-on coaching, and networking; (iii) a virtual platform to connect independent skilled \nlabor in ger areas with prospective employers; and (iv) a clearinghouse to promote investment \nopportunities  in  ger  areas.  ICT  solutions  can  help  provide  up-to-date  information  to  potential \ninvestors or those looking for goods and services from  ger areas, or any other opportunities to \nsupport the redevelopment process. Improved information availability will help build trust among \ninvestors and ger residents to take part in economic development activities and contribute to the \nredevelopment plan initiated under the MFF. ICT solutions will allow the centers to reach a larger \naudience, in particular younger entrepreneurs and start-ups with innovative and bankable ideas. \nIt  will  adopt  and  learn  from  the  Asia  Foundation\u2019s  Women  Business  Incubator  Center  model, \n\n                                                \n4  The plan is to turn the BICs into multipurpose community centers that will provide community engagement activities, \n\nbusiness incubator services, and subcenter redevelopment information services. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fwhich  has  been  transferred  to  and  is  operated  by  MUB,  to  especially  support  female \nentrepreneurs. \n \n12. \nOutput  4:  Ger  area  redevelopment  monitoring  and  coordination  strengthened. \nICT can support MUB to strengthen monitoring of redevelopment efforts through the application \nof  a  modern  computerized  project  performance  management  system,  as  well  as  e-tools  to \nstreamline  coordination  among  stakeholders  involved  in  the  Tranche  1  targeted  areas  (e.g., \ngovernment agencies, donors, and nongovernment and community-based organizations) so that \nthey can coordinate, build synergies, and pool resources for better development outcomes. Finally, \nthe TA will help the PMO collect video footage to document the redevelopment progress in ger \nareas, for use in decision making and public relations. \n\n \nDesign and monitoring framework. The TA will enhance the quality of outputs  under \n13. \nTranche  1  without  any  change  to  its  targeted  results  indicators.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework of Tranche 1 thus remains unchanged. \n \nC. \n\nCost and Financing \n\n14. \nThe TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and administered by ADB. The \nkey expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1.  \n \n15. \nIneligible expenditure.
