THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto Tuvalu for the additional financing of the Outer Island Maritime Infrastructure Project. \n \n2.  The proposed additional financing will scale up and extend the socioeconomic benefits of \nthe current project by (i) constructing a small workboat harbor in Niutao and (ii) financing cost \noverruns caused by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation and contract variations for the \nworks contract under the project.1 The additional financing is consistent with the project rationale, \nwill extend socioeconomic benefits to the outer island of Niutao, and is included in the country \noperations business plan, 2018\u20132020 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the 11 small \nPacific island countries.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Regional context. Tuvalu is one of the smallest and most remote ADB member countries. \nIts challenges in transport and economic development come from its dispersed geography: (i) \nnine atoll islands, stretching across more than 680 kilometers (km) in the southwest Pacific; (ii) a \nsmall and dispersed population of 10,100 as of June 2016, with more than 6,000 people in \nFunafuti, the capital, and the rest on the outer islands;3 and (iii) a decreasing population on the \nouter islands because of limited economic opportunities. Tuvalu is more than 1,100 km away from \nFiji and more than 3,000 km away from Australia and New Zealand. \n \n4.  Maritime transport challenges. The Government of Tuvalu runs a shipping service to \nfacilitate passenger and cargo mobility between the islands, which faces numerous challenges. \nFirst, the two ships operating continuously can only reach each the islands once every 2\u20133 \nweeks.4 Second, no outer island has a docking facility for the government ships, and small \nworkboats ferry passengers and cargo between the ship and the shore. This is dangerous when \nthe sea is rough. Third, workboats need to pass through channels, some of which are dangerous \nwhen the sea is rough or too shallow to use during low tide. Finally, except for Nanumea, \nNukufetau, and Vaitupu, the outer islands also lack docking facilities for the workboats. In the \npast, serious accidents have occurred during both passenger transfers and navigation through \nthe channels, resulting in loss of lives and economic values. Transfer operations cannot be carried \nout when the sea is rough or after dark, reducing the efficiency of ship operations. In addition, \nTuvalu faces constant and increasing threats of natural hazards such as tropical cyclones. \n \n5.  Government priority. The government places very high priority on improving access for \nthe outer islands. The National Strategy for Sustainable Development, 2016\u20132020 sets out the \ngovernment\u2019s vision to make maritime transportation more efficient and safer.5 The original project \nincluded the construction of a small work-boat harbour in the island of Nukulaelae and some minor \nmaritime infrastructure improvements (construction of boat ramps) in the islands of Nui and \n                                                \n1  The construction of a small workboat harbor is a new activity under output 1. \n2  ADB. 2017.

Te Kakeega III: National Strategy for Sustainable Development, 2016 to 2020. Funafuti. \nAs of May 2016, the government is updating the Tuvalu Infrastructure Strategy and Investment Plan 2016 based on \nTe Kakeega III to replace the Infrastructure Strategic Investment Plan, 2011\u20132015. \n ", "2 \nNiutao. In parallel, the government also requested the World Bank to improve the Funafuti and \nNanumaga maritime infrastructure under the Maritime Investment in Climate Resilient Operations \nproject. \n \n6.  Project financing and scope. On 16 November 2016, ADB approved grant financing of \n$8.3 million from the Asian Development Fund and $3.0 million from the Disaster Response \nFacility as well as grant administration of $500,000 from the Global Environmental Facility to \nfinance the project.6 ADB provided a project design advance (PDA) grant for the detailed \nengineering design, procurement assistance, and project management of the current project.7 \n \n7.  The project scope includes the (i) construction of a workboat harbor in Nukulaelae and \nboat ramps in Nanumaga and Niutao; (ii) provision of technical assistance to improve capacity for \nthe operation and maintenance (O&M) of harbors as part of the institutional strengthening plan; \nand (iii) preparation of a master plan for maritime transport in Tuvalu, including a harbor pre-\nfeasibility study and conceptual funding strategy for the two highest-ranked transport options. \n \n8.  Project progress. During implementation, the government established a task force to \noversee the current project and a project management unit (PMU) to implement it. The current \nproject included project management, construction supervision, and institutional strengthening \nsupport as a core component. It was fully ready at approval, with the detailed design and \nprocurement strategy prepared through the PDA. The government set up a deferred maintenance \nfund in 2015 to secure O&M resources. These activities led to the satisfactory implementation of \nthe current project and strengthened readiness for the additional financing project.8 \n \n9.  The current project is performing well and has met all five standards stipulated in the \nOperations Manual on Additional Financing.9 \n(i)  Delivery of expected outputs. The current project is on track to meet the intended \noutputs. \n(a)  The  construction  of  the  workboat  harbor  in  Nukulaelae  and  the \nrehabilitation of the boat ramps in Nanumaga and Niutao started in January \n2018 and is expected to be completed within the original contract period. \n(b)  The government is preparing an O&M manual to keep project deliverables \nin good condition and to ensure that the islands\u2019 harbors will be fully \nmaintained in the future. The government will conduct training on O&M \nwhen construction work ends. \n(c)  The government is preparing a master plan for future harbor development \nin the outer islands in 2018 and has completed pre-feasibility (high-level \nconcept designs and cost estimates) and feasibility studies for small-scale \nharbors. \n(ii)  Implementation progress. Implementation is progressing as scheduled. \n(a)  The government signed the civil works contract for the construction of the \nworkboat  harbor  at  Nukulaelae  with  the  China  Civil  Engineering \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2016.

Project Design Advance: Outer Island Maritime Infrastructure Project in Tuvalu. Manila. ADB extended \nthe PDA\u2019s closing date to 30 June 2019. \n8 As of 17 August 2018, actual contract awards are $11.41 million (97.06%) and disbursements are $4.51 million (100%) \n9  Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The project team will \nseek the President\u2019s waiver in respect of the 12-month well-performing period under para. 4 of the Operations Manual \non Additional Financing (ADB. 2011. Additional Financing. Operations Manual. OM H5/OP. Manila). \n ", "3 \nConstruction Corporation on 22 August 2017. Works are scheduled for \ncompletion within the contract period ending by March 2019. \n(b)  The  government  signed  the  project  support  and  master  planning \nconsultancy (PSMPC) contract with Cardno Emerging Markets of Australia \non  13 September  2017.  The  government  is  reviewing  and  approving \nconstruction documents and plans in a timely fashion. \n(c)  The  PSMPC  is  carrying  out  institutional  strengthening  to  establish \nsustainable  asset  management  arrangements  that  are  focused  on \nmaintaining project deliverables, which is scheduled for completion by \n31 December 2018. \n(d)  The PSMPC is also preparing a transport master plan, which is scheduled \nfor completion by 31 December 2018. \n(iii)  Satisfactory compliance with safeguard policy requirements. The current \nproject has met social and environmental safeguard requirements satisfactorily so \nfar. \n(iv)  Successful management of risks. The current project incorporated actions to \nmitigate risks, which the government is implementing satisfactorily. Nonetheless, \nthe risk rating for the overall project remains moderate. \n(v)  On track rating. ADB\u2019s project performance monitoring system has rated the \ncurrent project on track since grant effectiveness on 30 August 2017. \n \n10.  Additional financing. The government has requested additional grant financing from \nADB to the project for a major infrastructure improvement (small work-boat harbour) in Niutao, an \nisland of about 600 people. The additional financing will (i) scale up and extend benefits by \nconstructing  a  workboat  harbor  in  Niutao,  and  (ii)  finance  cost  overruns  caused  by  the \nappreciation of the Australian dollar by about 10% against the United States dollar and contract \nvariations of about $1 million for the works contract under the project because of the higher cost \nof dredging the channel and the lack of geotechnical data. \n \n11.  The additional financing is justified given that the overall project (i) remains technically \nfeasible,  cost-effective,  and  financially  sound;  (ii)  is  consistent  with  the  current  project\u2019s \ndevelopment  objective  to  improve  maritime  transfer  operations  in  Nanumaga,  Niutao,  and \nNukulaelae; (iii) is accorded high priority by the government; and (iv) is consistent with the country \noperations business plan. ADB applied a simplified business process for the additional financing \nbecause the current project has been performing well for a reasonable amount of time. \n \n12.  The additional financing to scale up project outputs is feasible given that (i) project \nmanagement capacity of the Ministry of Communication and Transport (MCT) is strengthened \nwith a Joint World Bank and ADB\u2019s Project Management Unit, which will implement all maritime \ninfrastructure projects in Tuvalu; (ii) the MCT has undertaken geotechnical investigations in \nNiutao, which will reduce the procurement risk of receiving bids for the civil works contract \nsubstantially higher than the cost estimate (geotechnical information was not available during the \nprocurement of the civil works under the original project); the PMU has demonstrated sufficient \nfinancial management capacity with duly submitted and approved financial statements; and the \ninstitutional strengthening, and O&M plan that the MCT are implementing guarantee the asset \nsustainability. These measures contribute to the feasibility of the proposed project and will allow \nits timely implementation and sustainability. \n \n13.  The proposed project is suitable for additional financing since it has the same outcome, \nsimilar small outputs, and the same executing and implementing agencies as the current project; \nand builds upon the due diligence of the current project. \n ", "4 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcomes \n \n14.  The impact of the overall project remains unchanged and will be to secure safe and \nefficient maritime infrastructure in the outer islands, with climate change resilience incorporated \nin infrastructure design, protocols, and operation. The outcomes also remain unchanged and will \nbe to improve maritime transfer operations in Nanumaga, Niutao, and Nukulaelae; and establish \nclear directions for developing transport, fishery, and tourism in the country.10 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n15.  Output 1 of the overall project will include the construction of a small workboat harbor in \nNiutao  to  higher  standards  of  climate  and  disaster  resilience.  Outputs  2  and  3  remain \nunchanged.11 \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plan \n \n16.  The project is estimated to cost $16.9 million (Table 1).

The government has requested a grant not exceeding $15.4 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the project. This amount includes \n$1.25 million in grant resources from the disaster risk reduction financing mechanism under the \n11th replenishment of the Asian Development Fund. Tuvalu will finance about $1.5 million in \nremaining project costs, consisting of land lease, compensation for economic losses from the \nremoval of trees, counterpart government staff, customs clearance costs, and exemption of taxes \nand duties. The financing plan is in Table 2. \n \n                                                \n10 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n11 Output 2: capacity to operate and maintain harbors improved, involving the outer island communities, the MCT, and \nother national government agencies.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The  government  established  a  project  task  force  in  February  2015  to  oversee  the \npreparation and implementation of the current project, with the permanent secretaries of five \nministries as members. The Ministry of Communication and Transport (MCT) will continue to be \nthe executing agency for the overall project. The MCT appointed the director of its Marine and \nPort Services Department as project director in July 2015 on a part-time basis and as the focal \nperson for project management. The project director is assisted by the PMU, which has been \noperating since March 2016. The project director and the PMU supervise and provide counterpart \nsupport to a consulting firm that will be engaged under the overall project to provide project \nmanagement, construction supervision, and capacity building support. \n \n19.  The World Bank will provide support to the government for the development of maritime \ninfrastructure in Funafuti and the outer islands through a project scheduled for approval during \nthe first half of 2019. Given the synergies between ADB and World Bank assistance programs, \nthe PMU will be expanded into a Joint ADB\u2013World Bank PMU. The World Bank will recruit new \nstaff for the PMU and will expand the roles and responsibilities of the existing staff. The ADB \nproject will finance the project manager and project account positions, and the World Bank project \nwill finance the deputy project manager and the part-time safeguard and procurement specialist \npositions. \n \n20.  The  government  will  select  the  project  management  and  construction  supervision \nconsultant (PMCSC) through quality- and cost-based selection following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). All procurement of works will follow \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). \n \n21.  To expedite project implementation, the government requested advance contracting for \nthe procurement of geotechnical investigation work at the Niutao harbor site. It engaged a service \ncontractor to carry out the investigation. This will ensure that detailed information on ground \nconditions are known, which will allow civil works bidders to price elements of the works more \naccurately, including dredging of the channel, driving of piles, and crushing of materials.12 \n \n22.  ADB and the World Bank agreed to jointly finance the geotechnical investigation, which \nthe government endorsed in May 2018. The World Bank will finance domestic transportation costs \nestimated at A$175,000, while ADB will finance drilling works estimated at A$350,000 and the \n                                                \n12 Since the overall project is financed with ADB-administered cofinancing resources, universal procurement will apply. \nADB. 2013.

The government contracted the drilling \nworks in advance of grant approval (under retroactive financing) and using direct contracting, \napproved by ADB in February 2018, while the laboratory tests and reporting are financed by the \nPDA. \n \n23.  The government also requested advance contracting to recruit the PMCSC and procure \nthe works. ADB informed the government that approval of advance contracting does not commit \nADB to finance the project. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and \ndescribed in detail in the PAM.13 \n \n24.  To increase the readiness of the additional financing project, the government will carry out \nthe following activities during preconstruction using the PDA: (i) producing the final feasibility and \ndue diligence report (by updating initial documents prepared during the project preparation of the \nproposed additional financing) for approval by ADB and providing necessary support to the \ngovernment in facilitating site possession; (ii) updating the detailed design after the completion of \nthe  geotechnical  surveys;  (iii)  updating  the  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  and \nenvironmental management plan (EMP), including these in the bid documents, and summarizing \nthe quality and completeness of bidders\u2019 responses to the EMP requirements; and (iv) supporting \nthe government during the advance actions of the bidding for the civil works, including support for \nthe tender stage. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  November 2018\u2013December 2021 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2021  \nEstimated grant closing date  30 June 2022 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Task force chair \n(ii) Executing agency  Ministry of Communication and Transport  \n(iii) Implementing agency  Ministry of Communication and Transport \n(iv) Implementation unit  Project management unit \nProcurement  International competitive bidding  1 contract  $11,400,000 \nDirect contracting  1 contract  $300,000 \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based selection  1 contract  $1,000,000 \nSingle source selection  2 national consultants  $300,000 \nRetroactive financing and/or  ADB has approved retroactive financing to finance a portion of the geotechnical \nadvance contracting  investigation contract.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n25.  ADB has assessed as technically viable the construction of (i) a small-scale workboat \nharbor in Niutao, including channel dredging; and (ii) trestle, breakwaters, a boat ramp, and a \n                                                \n13 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \npassenger terminal. Project preparatory consultants are designing all facilities following Australian \nand New Zealand technical standards with a design life of 50 years. Climate change and potential \ndisaster risk impacts such as a predicted sea level rise, an increase in wave height, and an \nincrease in the intensity and frequency of tropical cyclones and other risks from extreme weather \nevents have been analyzed under the climate risk vulnerability assessment and are reflected in \nthe preliminary and detailed design to address the climate change and disaster risks. The \nadaptation and disaster risk reduction measures recommended for incorporation concern the \nfixed breakwater structures, boat ramp, channel, and onshore facilities.14 The facilities are also \nbeing designed to minimize and/or reduce erosion and siltation. While structures made of \nconcrete and steel do not require significant maintenance, the new channel dredged in Niutao is \nanticipated  to  require  maintenance  dredging.  The  overall  project  includes  institutional \nstrengthening for effective O&M of project assets to ensure the sustainability of the project \nfacilities. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n26.  Following the same methodology and approach as that of the current project, the overall \nproject applied a cost-effectiveness analysis to evaluate the economic viability and determined \nthat the without-project scenario would negatively impact livelihoods because it would continue to \nmake it difficult and under precarious conditions for the population to import basic goods.15 \n \n27.  The cost-effectiveness analysis considered two options: (i) a wharf on the northeastern \nside of the island for small landing crafts and/or workboats; and (ii) a wharf at the same site but \nfor large vessels, which is the most socially acceptable solution. The assessment compared the \nnet present value of capital investment costs and travel cost improvements of both options. Not \nall benefits were incorporated, but the options can also be weighed by comparing the travel cost \nimprovement. The assessment determined that the first option is more cost-effective in reducing \ntravel times and vessel-operating costs. \n \n28.  ADB assessed the government\u2019s capacity to sustain project outputs and shipping services \nas adequate. This is not a revenue-generating project, and passenger and cargo revenues will \nnot cover the O&M of the shipping service, including the project facilities. However, the MCT has \nbeen satisfactorily maintaining the ships and to date has avoided any major troubles during \noperation. The major incremental O&M costs associated with the project will be the maintenance \ndredging of a new channel after every major tropical cyclone, which has been occurring about \nevery 10 years. Notwithstanding this, the government will allocate an annual budget for major \nmaintenance to ensure that sufficient funds are available when a cyclone occurs. The financial \nanalysis showed that the MCT will have sufficient revenues and budgetary allocations for such \nincremental major maintenance dredging, estimated at A$100,000 per dredging, and other O&M \nrequirements. Coupled with planned institutional strengthening activities, the overall project will \nestablish satisfactory O&M arrangements covering financial, technical, and institutional aspects. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n29.  Financial management. The financial management arrangements under the current \nproject will continue under the overall project. A project financial management assessment \nprepared for the MCT and the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development indicated that the \n                                                \n14 Climate Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 The project also has unquantifiable benefits such as avoidance of a potential large maritime accident (e.g., sinking \nof a passenger ferry, oil tanker, or fishing boats) with major economic, human, and environmental losses. \n ", "8 \noverall financial management risk is moderate. The financial management assessment of the \ncurrent project identified the following key risks: (i) inadequate accounting and claiming of project \nfunds, (ii) incomplete audits, (iii) delayed release of the government counterpart funds, and (iv) \nno internal audit function. The PMU has procured suitable accounting software and makes sure \nthat separate bank accounts are maintained for the receipt of ADB funds. The remaining financial \narrangements under the current project, including support from the Technical Assistance for the \nInstitutional Strengthening of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, will continue.16 \n \n30.  Procurement capacity. ADB completed a project procurement risk assessment for the \nMCT, the Central Procurement Unit, and other offices involved. Overall, the procurement risk is \nmoderate.  The  establishment  of  the  Central  Procurement  Unit  in  2015  helped  reduce  the \nprocurement risks under the project, and the ADB-financed technical assistance supported \nlegislation  and  institutional  strengthening.  Procurement risk  will  remain  moderate  only  with \ncontinued support of the PDA consultants and the construction supervision consultant. ADB staff \nwill oversee procurement activities under the project to ensure good governance. The MCT and \nthe PMU agreed to continue joint consultant recruitment with ADB, as officially requested by the \nPMU to ADB in May 2018, using ADB\u2019s Consultant Management System. \n \n31.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n32.  Improving and upgrading maritime infrastructure will give the outer island communities \nbetter access to essential services and economic opportunities. The safe and efficient movement \nof people and goods is expected to increase economic activities, particularly among small \nbusiness owners, and reduce migration from the outer islands to Funafuti. Women and poor and \nvulnerable groups, such as people with disabilities and elderly people requiring medical attention, \nare expected to benefit the most because they are particularly vulnerable to accident risks \nassociated with the lack of harbor facilities in the outer islands. \n \nE.  Gender \n \n33.  The overall project is classified effective gender mainstreaming, and a gender action plan \n(GAP) was prepared.17 Project design elements that ensure women\u2019s participation and access to \nproject  benefits  include  (i)  women-friendly  design  of  the  maritime  facilities;  (ii) women\u2019s \nparticipation in the capacity building and training activities; (iii) equal employment opportunities \nfor women during construction; (iv) gender awareness activities to target groups (women, elderly, \ndisabled persons); and (v) business opportunities associated with the new harbor (canteen and \ncraft items). The MCT and the PMU will implement and monitor GAP implementation, and will \nengage intermittent international and national social development and gender specialists to assist \nin implementing the GAP.  MCT and the PMU will prepare and implement awareness activities on \nHIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases during construction. \n \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2012.

In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  overall  project\u2019s \nsafeguard categories are as follows.18 \n \n35.  Environment (category B). Impacts are site-specific, few if any are irreversible, and \nmitigation and management measures can be readily designed and implemented for most \nimpacts. In compliance with the Safeguard Policy Statement, the Government prepared an IEE \nfor the components to be supported by additional financing. The impacts are limited to the footprint \nof the small-scale workboat harbor, including channel, and associated land-side facilities at \nNiutao. These can be mitigated and managed to acceptable levels, provided that the measures \nidentified  in  the  IEE\u2019s  EMP  are  implemented.  ADB  anticipates  short-term  impacts  during \nconstruction\u2014e.g., dust, noise, and waste generated during dredging and civil works\u2014as well as \nminor community and occupational health and safety risks. The Department of Environment within \nthe Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Trade, Tourism, Environment, and Labor has adequate capacity \nto manage environmental issues with consultant support. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Public \nCommunications Policy, ADB will disclose the IEE and subsequent monitoring reports on ADB\u2019s \nwebsite. As in the current project, the contractor will prepare its construction environmental \nmanagement plan (CEMP) based on the EMP and sediment plume modeling. The PMU will \nreview and clear the CEMP, and the PMU (assisted by the PMCSC) and the Department of \nEnvironment will monitor compliance with, and effectiveness of, the CEMP. \n \n36.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The construction of a small-scale harbor at \nNiutao  will  be  on  government  or  community  lands.  The  associated  facilities\u2014such  as  the \npassenger terminal, water tanks, and a warehouse\u2014will be built on private lands where, as in the \ncurrent project, the landowners have expressed willingness to enter into lease agreements with \nthe government. The government will comply with the negotiated settlement requirements under \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and the country\u2019s established lease procedures. Failure to \nnegotiate the lease will not result in compulsory acquisition. Consultations were held with the \naffected communities and other stakeholders, and will continue during implementation by the \ngovernment. \n \n37.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project will not have an impact on any distinct \nand vulnerable group of indigenous peoples. The MCT will implement the project in a culturally \nappropriate and participatory manner. All residents will equally benefit from the improved marine \ntransportation facilities. \n \nG.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n38.  The project risk is moderate. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in \nTable 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.19 The integrated \nbenefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the risk and costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nThe limited number of government staff have  The project management and construction supervision consultant, \ninsufficient experience in implementing large  the Joint World Bank\u2013ADB PMU, and a consulting firm for project \ninvestment projects.  implementation support will assist the MCT. \n                                                \n18 ADB.
