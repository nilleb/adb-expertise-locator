About half the country\u2019s population lives \non  the  outer  islands5. The  Maldives  has  about  141  megawatts  (MW)  of  installed  diesel-based \ngeneration capacity on the inhabited islands and another 105 MW on the resort islands. While \nthe  Maldives  has  the  unique  distinction  of  being  the  first  and  only  country  in  South  Asia  with \n100% access to electricity, this achievement has come at a cost. Given the geographic spread, \neach island is electrified with its own diesel-powered grid system, resulting in expensive and not \nvery reliable supply. The cost of diesel power is unaffordable at 30 cents\u201370 cents per kilowatt-\nhour  (depending  on  the  island)  and  requires  government  subsidies  in  excess  of  $40  million \nannually.  Electricity-related  subsidies  are  also  a  focus  area  for  more  robust  management  of \ngovernment expenditures. In 2012, the Maldives spent over $470 million on oil imports, a large \nshare  of  it  being  fuel  for  electricity  generation.6 The  100%  diesel  dependence  of  the  Maldives \nalso  makes  its  carbon  emissions  per  unit  of  electricity  among  the  highest  in  the  region.  The \nState Electricity Company (STELCO) and FENAKA Corporation Limited (FENAKA) are the main \nelectricity  utilities  responsible  for  supplying  electricity  to  the  communities  of  inhabited  islands, \nexcept a few where island councils are still responsible for electricity supply. \n \n4. \nThe Maldives has significant renewable energy resources, i.e., the potential to generate \nsolar  power  and,  in  some  pockets,  wind  power.  Energy  sector  studies  show  that  the  cost  of \nenergy generation from hybrid (renewable energy and fossil fuel) systems would be significantly \nlower  than  the  existing  options.  The  transition  to  renewable  energy  has  a  sound  economic \nrationale.  The  government\u2019s  effort  to  increase  electricity  production  from  indigenous  sources, \nincluding solar and wind, to enhance energy security will reduce the pressure on the balance of \npayments  and  improve  the  fiscal  position.  The  government  has  initiated  two  programs\u2014 \nPreparing  Outer  Islands  for  Sustainable  Energy  Development  (POISED)  and  Accelerating \nSustainable  Private  Investments  in  Renewable  Energy  (ASPIRE)  to  support  energy  efficiency \nand renewable energy investments. \n\n                                                \n1  Under  the  Scaling  Up  Renewable  Energy  Program  in  Low-Income  Countries  financed  by  the  Strategic  Climate \n\nFund. \n\n2  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for Preparing the Outer Islands for Sustainable Energy \n\nDevelopment Project (TA 8268-MLD). \n\n3  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n4  The Maldives has 1,192 islands, of which about 194 islands are inhabited. \n5   Outer lslands are the islands in the atolls outside the greater Male region. \n6  The Maldives is considered one of the country\u2019s most vulnerable to oil price fluctuations, with oil imports close to \n\n35% of gross domestic product in 2012. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nislands  (initially  planned \n\n \n5. \nThe  proposed  project  on  the  outer  islands  would  transform  the  existing  grids  through \nphysical  investments  in  renewable  energy,  energy  management  and  control  systems,  energy \nstorage, and improvements in distribution networks, and significantly reduce the need for diesel \nto generate electricity. Private sector investments to support solar photovoltaic interventions on \nlarger \nfor  STELCO)  are  under  consideration  outside,  and \ncomplementary to, the project. In addition, the government is expected to support a low carbon \nenergy  pathway  in  the  private  tourist  islands  over  the  medium  term  through  policy  measures \nand  investment  interventions  supported  by  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  and \nthe  SCF.  ADB  will  also  support  the  utilities\u2019  demand-side  management  interventions  through \nfuture technical assistance (TA). \n \nThe government has a national energy policy to support the development of the energy \n6. \nsector.  ADB  policy  dialogue  has  been  supporting  development  of  the  energy  sector  including \nthe development of a medium term road map and investment plan. The capacity of institutions \nsuch as the Maldives Energy Authority (MEA), the Ministry of Environment and Energy (MEE), \nand  the  utilities  is  also  progressively  being  strengthened 7  to  enable  implementation.  This \nincludes  MEA  developing  and  issuing  regulations  to  approve  investment  plans,  operator \nlicensing and consumer tariffs and implementing them by June 2015. Also MEA will approve  a \ngrid  code  to  ensure  successful  operation  of  the  facilities  installed  under  the  project.  The \ngovernance  of  STELCO  and  FENAKA  will  also  be  improved  with  measures  including  the \nappointment of independent directors with technical, legal and financial expertise.  The project is \naligned with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 of supporting sustainable energy growth, \nits  Energy  Policy,  and  its  country  operations  business  plan  for  the  Maldives  for  2013\u20132015.8 \nBased on the government\u2019s investment plan for the outer islands and the characteristics of the \nelectricity systems, a sector project approach is considered best suited to support the transition \nof those islands that meet the eligibility criteria, as defined in the project administration manual \n(PAM).9 \n \n7. \nLessons learned from ongoing projects. ADB\u2019s operations in the energy sector since \n1985  were  instrumental  in  meeting  electricity  demand  in  the  capital  of  Mal\u00e9  and  for  building \ncapacity in STELCO. From 2002, ADB supported the outer islands electrification project, which \nprovided diesel  generators  and grid  investments  on 19  islands.10   Several  lessons from  earlier \noperations  suggest  the  need  for  (i)  ADB\u2019s  collaboration  with  other  development  partners  to \nleverage existing resources; (ii) detailed technical, economic, and financial appraisal of projects \nprior  to  approval;  (iii)  technical  support  to  strengthen  institutions  such  as  MEA.  The  project \ndesign  incorporates  these  lessons.  Since  the  project  uses  a  sector  approach,  detailed  design \nhas  been  carried  out  for  a  sample  of  five  islands  representing  all  the  inhabited  islands.  This \nsample  will  be the first to  be  implemented.  Parallel  cofinancing has  been  sought from multiple \npartners,  and  the  integration  of  outer  islands  into  the  jurisdiction  of  one  agency  will  facilitate \nprocurement  as  well  as  standard  practices  for  financial  management.  Since  2012,  ADB  has \nbeen supporting the MEA in preparing technical codes and standards as well as regulations for \nthe electricity sector, including renewable energy investments. A consulting firm will support the \nproject  management  unit  (PMU)  in  screening,  doing  surveys,  preparing  bidding  documents, \n\n                                                \n7   ADB.  2011.

The \ndisbursement  schedules  are  realistic  and  take  into  account  difficulties  met  in  previous  project \nimplementation in the Maldives. \n \nCoordination  with  other  donors.  The  project  has  evolved  from  a  smaller  project \n8. \nplanned under  a  medium-term  investment  plan prepared  by  the  Maldives  in 2012.  Since then, \nseveral  donors  such  as  the  Islamic  Development  Bank  (IDB),  the  European  Investment  Bank \n(EIB), and other bilateral agencies have expressed interest in cofinancing the project alongside \nADB.  The  project  components  are  complementary  to  operations  of  the  World  Bank  Group11 \nplanned for 2014 and 2015, and a proposed pilot project planned in Addu City through the new \nfund  for  Joint  Crediting  Mechanism  of  the  Government  of  Japan. 12 The  investments  in  the \ndistribution grid, control systems, diesel generators, and energy storage devices financed under \nthe  project  by  ADB  and  its  partners  would  facilitate  more  efficient  operation  and  enable  the \nutilities to achieve the proposed fuel-saving targets. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n9. \nThe impact of the project will be a more sustainable energy sector based on renewable \nresources, to be achieved by 2022. The outcome will be a shift towards clean and cost-effective \nenergy sources by 2019.13 \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n10. \nThe  project  has  two  outputs:  (i)  renewable-energy-ready  grid  systems  developed  for \nouter  islands  and  greater  Male  region;  and  (ii) enhanced  capacity  of  MEE,  STELCO,  and \nFENAKA to implement renewable energy grid interventions. \n \n11. \nOutput 1 includes the design and installation of equipment for solar\u2013diesel hybrid grids \non  about  160  islands.  It  will  begin  in  the  second  half  of  2014  with  investments  in  five  sample \nsubprojects and a control center, to be scaled up to other islands according to eligibility criteria. \nCapacity building under output 2 covers roadmap implementation including procurement, project \nmanagement, technical and financial management, gender and safeguard support, and training; \nthis will start in 2014 and last for the duration of the project. \n \nD. \n \n12. \nexpenditure category and by financier are in the PAM (footnote 9). \n \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $124  million  (Table  1).

The ADB SCF15 will provide grant cofinancing equivalent to $12 \nmillion,  to be  administered  by  ADB.  The government  will  provide  these funds  to STELCO  and \nFENAKA on terms and conditions acceptable to ADB. IDB16 and EIB17 have expressed interest \nin cofinancing the project on a parallel basis.18 IDB is expected to provide a loan in the amount \nof $10 million, for a period of 20 years with an administrative charge not exceeding 2% during \nproject  implementation.  EIB  is  expected  to  provide  a  loan  in  the  amount  of  $50  million  for  15 \nyears at an interest rate of 61 basis points over the London interbank offered rate. IDB and EIB \nloans  will  be  onlent  by  the  government  to  STELCO  and  FENAKA  on  terms  and  conditions \nacceptable to these  agencies  for  investments  in the  islands.  The  government  will  provide  $14 \nmillion  of  counterpart  financing  to  procure  and  install  efficient  diesel  generation  sets  and \ndistribution networks as well as cover applicable taxes and duties. \n \n\n                                                \n14 A country's eligibility for Asian Development Fund (ADF) grants under the revised grant framework is determined \nby its risk of debt distress. The latest debt sustainability analysis determined that  the Maldives has a high risk of \ndebt distress and is therefore eligible to receive 100% of its ADF allocation as grants. \n\n15 Under  the  Scaling  Up  Renewable  Energy  Program  in  Low-Income  Countries  financed  by  the  Strategic  Climate \nFund. Administered by ADB. In 2012, the SCF endorsed the investment plan submitted by the Government of the \nMaldives  requesting  a  $12.0 million  grant  to  be  administered  by  ADB  for  the project.  The  project preparatory  TA \nreceived  $0.7  million  of  grant  financing  in  2012  from  the  SCF  to  develop  the  components.  In  accordance  with \nestablished  Climate  Investment  Fund  procedures,  SCF  approval  for  the  project  was  received  in  July  2014  after \nADB\u2019s staff review meeting on the project.  \n\n16 In 2012, IDB and ADB signed minutes of meetings to work together to support a renewable energy sector project in \n\nthe Maldives. This was further discussed in 2014 during the IDB country programming mission to Maldives. \n\n17 In 2013, EIB indicated interest in cofinancing the project and channeling the funds through the Bank of Maldives. A \n\ncommunication in this regard was sent from EIB to the Ministry of Finance and Treasury in the Maldives.  \n\n18 On  7  May  2014,  the  Cabinet of  the  Republic  of  the  Maldives expressed  interest in  receiving  loans  from  EIB and \nIDB for the project. This will enable processing of these loans. The Parliament of the Maldives will need to give final \napproval to any borrowings. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5 \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) \nADB Strategic Climate Funda \nIslamic Development Bankb \nEuropean Investment Bankc \nGovernment of the Maldives \n\nTotal \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nAmount ($ million) \n\n38.00 \n12.00 \n10.00 \n50.00 \n14.00 \n124.00 \n\nShare of Total (%) \n31.0 \n10.0 \n8.0 \n40.0 \n11.0 \n100.0 \n\na  Under  the  Scaling  Up  Renewable  Energy  Program  for  Low-Income  Countries  financed  by  the  Strategic  Climate \n\nFund.

A  PMU \ncomprising  officials  from  MEE,  FENAKA,  and  STELCO  has  been  set  up  to  coordinate  project \nactivities.  MEE,  FENAKA,  and  STELCO  will  be  the  key  implementing  agencies.  Project \nagreements will be entered into with FENAKA and STELCO. The PMU will be strengthened with \nexternal  experts  in the areas  of finance,  technology,  and contract  management. The  PMU  will \nbe  responsible  for  organizing  training  programs  to  build  the  institutional  capacity  of  FENAKA \nand  STELCO  and  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  the  implementation.  The  project \ndepartments  of  FENAKA  and  STELCO,  headed  by  project  directors,  will  act  as  the  project \nimplementation  units  (PIUs)  with  adequate  staff  to  assist  in  preparing  and  implementing  the \noverall implementation plan, bid management, and budgeting. The project implementation units \nwill  also  be  responsible  for  overall  intra-agency  coordination.  PIUs  will  provide  project \nimplementation  support  to  contractors  and  will  liaise  with  the  islands  where  the  project  will  be \nimplemented.  \n \n15. \nThe  project  will  be  implemented  in  four  phases.  Feasibility  studies  of  five  sample \nsubprojects for the islands of S. Addu, B. Goidhoo, Th. Buruni, Ga. Vilingili, and Lh. Khurendhoo \nhave  been  completed.  These  will  be  the  first  subprojects  for  which  procurement  and \nimplementation will start in late 2014 (under phase 1). The PMU team has been established in \n2014  and  functional  experts  in  technical,  financial  management,  procurement,  social  and \nenvironmental safeguards will also be identified to support the PMU for the review of the design \nand  the  implementation  of  the  solar\u2013diesel  hybrid  grids  on  the  five  islands.  Implementation  of \nsubprojects  under  subsequent  phases  will  involve  replacement  of  diesel  generator  sets  and \ngrids, as well as installation of solar photovoltaic and energy storage equipment, and would be \ndone  atoll  by  atoll  based  on  the  proposed  eligibility  and  selection  criteria.  Bid  document \npreparation for phase 2 will start in 2015, for phase 3 in 2016, and for phase 4 in 2017. An atoll-\nby-atoll  approach  is  preferred  for  future  subprojects  as  it  allows  better  planning  and \nimplementation  efficiencies  (footnote  10).  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as  amended \nfrom  time  to  time)  would  be  followed  for  procurement  of  ADB-financed  and  ADB-administered \nsubprojects.19 The  implementation  arrangements  are  summarized  in  Table  3  and  described  in \ndetail in the PAM (footnote 9). \n \n16. \nThe  World  Bank  supported  ASPIRE  program  will  provide  partial  risk  guarantees  to \nprivate  sector  investors  in  solar  photovoltaic  systems  in  the  Maldives  and  is  expected  to  be \nrolled out in 2015 starting with the area serviced by STELCO. In addition, the World Bank is also \n                                                \n19 On  18  March  2013,  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors  approved  a  blanket  waiver  of  member  country  procurement \n\neligibility restrictions in cofinanced ADF operations. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\ndesigning  a  project  to  support  solar  photovoltaic  installations  in  the  Greater  Mal\u00e9  region \nserviced  by  STELCO.

Further, \nongoing  capacity  development  TA  to MEE  and MEA  (footnote 7)  to  support the formulation of \nkey regulations, facilitate private sector investment, and meet key sector objectives will continue \nwith support from the SCF.20 \n \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\n(i)  Oversight body \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nJune 2014\u2013December 2019 \n31 December 2019 \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  MEE, FENAKA, and STELCO \n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nProject steering committee comprising state ministers (finance and \ntreasury, environment and energy, economic development) of the \nGovernment of the Maldives, Head of Maldives Energy Authority; \nand Managing Directors of FENAKA and STELCO \nMinistry of Finance and Treasury, Government of the Maldives \n\nProject  management  unit  located  at  MEE,  seven  staff  proposed; \nproject implementation units at STELCO and FENAKA \nInternational \ncompetitive bidding \n\n$44 million \n\nSix contracts (under ADB) \nEIB and IDB to follow own \nprocurement guidelines \nnone \n\n \n\n \n$3 million \n\n \nFirm-based contract \n\nNational competitive \nbidding \n \nQCBS \nRetroactive financing to be requested for eligible expenditure on \nequipment, civil works, and implementation services, not exceeding \nthe amount of 20% of the estimates, incurred before grant \neffectiveness but not earlier than 12 months before the signing of \nthe grant agreement. \nAdvance contracting was approved in July 2014 \nThe grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to \ntime) and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the \ngovernment and ADB. \n\nConsulting services \nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \n\nDisbursement \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, EIB = European Investment Bank, FENAKA = FENAKA Corporation Limited, IDB = \nIslamic Development Bank, MEE = Ministry of Environment and Energy, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection, \nSTELCO = State Electricity Company. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n17. \nThe PMU staff will be responsible for screening and due diligence on whether proposed \nsubprojects  meet  the  eligibility  criteria  for  the  project  and  will  report  to  ADB.  The  government \nhas  been  advised  that  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  in \nprinciple does not commit ADB to finance the project. \n \n\n                                                \n20 The SCF approved about $0.4 million in 2014 to support MEE and MEA in periodic updates of the sector road map \nand  investment  plan,  environmental  management  guidelines,  private  sector  investment  support,  and  productive \nenergy end use. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7 \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n18. \nThe project is considered viable based on due diligence and an assessment of the costs, \nbenefits, and impacts. It will benefit the islands of the Maldives with the availability of cheaper, \ncleaner, and more reliable power. It also will reduce the subsidy burden on the government and \nallow more financing of key social priorities. The main benefit to the country\u2019s economy will be \naccrued in  the form  of  reduced diesel  imports, which will  have  a  significant  positive impact  on \nthe country\u2019s balance of payments. \n \nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n19. \nThe government has a national energy policy and a sector road map to convert islands\u2019 \nelectricity  grids  to  hybrid  (renewable  energy  and  diesel)  systems.  Islands  are  classified  based \non the existing cost of electricity and economic level of renewable energy penetration. Detailed \nstudies were conducted for a representative sample of islands using an energy planning model \nthat optimizes the use of different energy sources for electricity generation, including renewable \nenergy  such  as  wind  and solar  power.21 Also,  the analysis  has  been  extrapolated to  cover the \nentire  group  of  inhabited  islands  in  the  Maldives.  An  investment  plan  has  been  developed  for \nislands  covered  by  FENAKA  and  for  some  of  those  covered  by  STELCO  that  could  have \ninterventions  under  the  project.  The  road  map  is  viable,  and  technologies  have  been  selected \nfor  operation  and \nbased  on  operational  requirements, \nmaintenance  on  remote  islands.  The  procurement  and  implementation  experience  from  the \nproject\u2019s  first  set  of  islands  in  2015  will  provide  useful  information  for  the  structuring  of  future \nprocurement. \n \nB. \n\nlocal  conditions,  and  capacity \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n20. \nThe  project  has  been  analyzed  for  economic  viability  using  a  with-  and  without-project \napproach  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.22 The \nproject is economically viable with benefits outweighing the costs. The economic internal rates \nof  return  (EIRRs)  of  the  five  sample  subprojects  range  from  14.00%  to  40.17%,  while  the \nbenefit\u2013cost  ratios  range  from  1.06  to  1.40.  The  combined  sample  has  an  EIRR  of  31.32%. \nSensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  project  returns  are  robust  against  changes  in  critical \nvariables,  with  a  minimum  EIRR  of  11.5%  in  the  worst-case  scenario  of  20%  escalation  in \ncapital  costs.23 The  project  components  will  support  reduced  diesel  consumption  per  unit  of \nelectricity  sold  by  replacing  diesel  generation  sets  and  grids  on  nearly  160  islands  and \ngenerating 21 MW of solar power. The project will support a reduction of 40,000 tons of carbon \ndioxide by 2019 against the baseline emissions in the energy sector. \n \n21. \nFinancial  analysis  of  the  project  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Financial \nManagement  and  Analysis  of  Projects. 24  All  financial  costs  and  benefits  are  expressed  in \nconstant 2014 prices. The weighted average cost of capital was estimated at 1.2% (in after-tax \nreal terms). Based on conservative assumptions adopted for the base-case analysis\u2014a 1.39% \n\n                                                \n21 HOMER,  originally  designed  at  the  National  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory  in  the  United  States,  is  a  computer \nmodel  that  simplifies  the  task  of  designing  microgrids  that  combine  traditionally  generated  power,  renewable \npower,  energy  storage  and  load  management.  Its  optimization  algorithm  allows  evaluation  of  the  economic  and \ntechnical feasibility of a large number of technology options and to account for variations in technology costs and \nenergy resource availability. \n\n22 ADB. 1997.

Sensitivity \nanalysis  shows  that  the  project  returns  are  robust  against  changes  in  critical  variables  and \nexceed the WACC. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nFinancial  management,  procurement,  anticorruption,  policy  and  legal,  capacity,  and \n22. \nother  institutional  issues  and  mechanisms  were  assessed  during  the  project  preparatory  TA. \nThe  PMU  will  report  to  an  interministerial  technical  steering  committee  comprising  the  state \nministers  of  finance  and  treasury,  environment  and  energy,  and  economic  development.  The \nfinancial management risk is rated high, and a road map for the rollout of the project\u2014including \ninvestment  planning,  institutional  development,  governance,  and  financial  management\u2014has \nbeen agreed with the government. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government,  STELCO,  and  FENAKA.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 9). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nPoverty  reduction  and  social  issues  were  reviewed  for  subprojects  during  the  project \n23. \npreparatory  TA.  The  project  will  ensure  several  direct  benefits  to  communities:  (i)  use  of \nrenewable  energy  sources  available  on  islands,  (ii)  sustainable  energy  and  economic \ndevelopment,  (iii)  energy  supply  to  homes  and  for  productive  energy  use,  (iv)  livelihood \ndevelopment through poverty reduction and improvement in the quality of life, and (v) capacity \ndevelopment opportunities for women groups. \n \nE. \n\nGender Development \n\nimprove  energy  efficiency, \n\n24. \nGender  issues  and  opportunities  for  mainstreaming  were  also  considered  in  the \npreparation of the project based on the due diligence carried out for the five sample islands. The \nproject  is  designed  to  be  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  A  gender  action \nframework  (GAF),  which  integrates  indicators  and targets  in  the  project design  and  monitoring \nframework, has been prepared. The GAF has the following key outputs: (i) household demand-\nside  management  program  to \ntargeting  women  household \nconsumers  who  will  link  up  with and further  develop  FENAKA\u2019s  community  outreach program; \n(ii) creation of an enabling environment for developing women\u2019s microenterprises; (iii) promotion \nof  women\u2019s  employment  and  training  during  subproject  construction,  and  operation  and \nmaintenance of the electricity assets on the islands; (iv) training for FENAKA and STELCO staff \nin  gender-inclusive  community  outreach  approaches;  and  (v)  a  gender-mainstreamed \nmanagement  system  to  be  designed  and  implemented.  The  island  women\u2019s  development \ncommittees  will  be  mobilized  for  community  outreach  and  awareness-raising  activities.  Social \ndevelopment  specialist  services  in  gender  and  development  will  be  recruited  to  support  the \nutilities  in  implementing  the  GAF.  The  project  will  promote  and  advocate  a  socially  inclusive, \ngender  equitable,  and  nondiscriminatory  work  environment  and  practices.  Practices  will  be \nconsistent  with  core  labor  standards.  The  project  will  minimize  the  risk  of  HIV/AIDS  through \ninformation dissemination campaigns in project areas. MEE, though the PMU, will determine a \ngender focal point to coordinate all gender-related activities. \n \n\n                                                \n25 World Energy Outlook current scenario. \n\n\f \n\nF. \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n\n9 \n\n25. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  as  environment  category  B.  An  environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework,  and  an  initial  environmental  examination  with  an \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) for the sample subprojects were prepared according to \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  in  line  with  OM/F1, 26  the  government\u2019s \nenvironmental impact assessment guidelines, and related national policies and legislation. The \nactivities  proposed  under  the  project  will  result  in  limited  environmental  impacts,  restricted \nmostly  to  construction  and  operation.  Adequate  mitigation  measures  have  been  incorporated \ninto  the  EMP.  Public  consultation  and  information  disclosure  requirements  have  been  met. \nMeasures for the executing agency\u2019s and the implementing agencies\u2019 capacity enhancement for \nimplementation of the EMP are also included in the initial environmental examination. The solar \nphotovoltaic systems financed by the project will be mounted on structures of 3 meter\u20134 meter \nheight,  and  other  project  facilities  are  expected  to  be  resilient  to  climate  change  through \ncompact and preassembled systems resistant to extreme weather conditions. \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  as \n26. \ncategory B for involuntary resettlement and C for indigenous peoples. Due diligence conducted \non sample subprojects showed no resettlement impacts and no adverse impacts on indigenous \ngroups.  A  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  for  the  project.  If  any  changes  or \nadditional land requirements or involuntary resettlement impacts emerge during implementation \nof  a  subproject,  a  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  or  modified  according  to  the  applicable \nlaws  referred  to  in  the  resettlement  framework.  ADB\u2019s  approval  will  be  obtained  before \nimplementation  of  the  subproject  continues.  The  social  and  environmental  safeguards  will  be \nconducted by FENAKA and STELCO, assisted by the PMU. \n \nG. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n27. \nThe overall benefits of the project and its positive impact on the country\u2019s development \nefforts  including  the  contribution  to  climate  change  mitigation  are  expected  to  outweigh  the \ninvestment costs. The project has incorporated measures to overcome all the major risks during \nproject  implementation.
