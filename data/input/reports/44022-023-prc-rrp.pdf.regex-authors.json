I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Guangxi  Baise  Integrated  Urban  Environment \nImprovement Project.1 The project will improve urban infrastructure and services, as well as the \nenvironment of Dongsun subdistrict of Baise, a city in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region \n(GZAR). By providing roads, bridges, and associated infrastructure including water supply and \nwastewater and storm water collection systems; river rehabilitation and flood control; upgraded \ncommunity  facilities;  and  capacity  building,  the  project  will  contribute  to  urban  renewal  and \nsustainable development in Dongsun. 2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n2.  Baise is in western GZAR and has an urban population of 260,000. Baise is one of the 14 \nkey national poverty areas in the PRC. Dongsun subdistrict is a peri-urban area 4 kilometers (km) \nwest of Baise\u2019s urban center.3 The Dongsun subdistrict industrial area was developed during \n1950\u20131960, when a number of state-owned enterprises built factories and housing for its workers \nin  the  southwest  of  Baise  along  the  Youjiang  River.4 During  1980\u20131990,  these  plants\u2019  low \nproduction efficiency became increasingly apparent as subsidies to state-owned enterprises were \nremoved  and  production  costs  were  brought  closer  to  market  norms.  Consequently,  facilities \nclosed, and others were sold or leased to private enterprises. Today, only the coal mine, fertilizer \nfactory, and motor plant continue to operate in Dongsun.  \n \n3.  After  more  than  50  years  of  state-led  industrialization,  Dongsun  shoulders  heavy \nsocioeconomic  and  environmental  burdens.  Since  2008,  employment has  shrunk  as factories \nclosed and workers were laid  off or took early retirement options. Local residents are highly \ndissatisfied with inadequate social services and infrastructure.5 First, current flood control capacity \nin the project area is unable to protect against a flood that occurs once in 50 years, which is the \nstandard requirement. Second, without a wastewater collection system, factories and residential \nareas discharge untreated wastewater directly into the Dongsun stream, which flows into the \nYoujiang river and thus pollutes Baise\u2019s main source of drinking water. Third, the existing urban \nroad network in Dongsun is inadequate for planned population growth, the resulting increased \nactivity in residential and commercial areas, and proper links with other subdistricts.6 Fourth, solid \nwaste transportation capacity must urgently be increased to mitigate the environmental pollution \ncurrently  caused  by  uncontrolled  solid  waste  dumping.  Further,  former  and  current  industrial \nfacilities have left Dongsun with localized moderate soil contamination. The detailed environmental \nsite assessment7undertaken under phase 1 of project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) \ndescribed the contamination and appropriate measures to clean it up.8   \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA): ADB. 2011. Technical \nAssistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing the Guangxi Baise Integrated Urban Environment \nRehabilitation  Project. Manila. \n3  Dongsun subdistrict covers 2.8 square kilometers. \n4  The industrial area included a coal mine, nitrogen fertilizer factory, motor plant, electrical power plant, and paper mill. \nFor more than 50 years, these industries constituted, along with government administration, much of the urban \neconomy of Baise.  \n5  A detailed social development assessment undertaken by the China Center for Urban Development highlighted the \nchallenge to consolidate and improve fragmented social services in the project area through urban redevelopment.  \n6  Damaged pavement and poor alignment undermine road safety and push up road maintenance and vehicle operating \ncosts. \n7  Y.Y. Gong., L. Jiang, and W. H. Zhang. 2011. Guangxi Baise Integrated Urban Environment Improvement\u2013Baise \nIndustrial Park Redevelopment Demo Project. Manila (final report submitted to ADB to assess the extent and location ", "2 \n \n4.   The Baise Municipal Government (BMG) is modernizing its industry and developing three \nnew industrial parks with higher environmental management standards. It decided to close down \nthe remaining industrial operations in Dongsun, relocate some factories to the new industrial parks, \nand prioritize urban and economic regeneration in Dongsun. The Baise City Urban Master Plan, \n2010\u20132030  has  designated  Dongsun  as  a  residential  district  with  green  and  environmentally \nfriendly facilities. In 2011\u20132012, the BMG contracted Tongji University to prepare the Urban Design \nPlan and the Control Plan to establish the legal basis for improving Dongsun from 2013 to 2030.9 \nThe plans called for creating a mixed-use community with residential, commercial, tourism, and \nrecreational  areas.  The  population  at  completion  in  2030  is  projected  to  be  34,000.10 The \nidentification of polluted sites and the land-use plan recommended under phase 1 of the PPTA are \naccurately mapped in the Control Plan prepared by Tongji University. Sensitive land uses, such as \nfor schools and housing, were restricted to uncontaminated land. \n \n5.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will play a vital role in redeveloping Dongsun by \nfinancing  trunk  infrastructure  improvements  and  rehabilitating  waterfronts  along  the  Dongsun \nstream and Youjiang river. With all major arterial roads and associated water and wastewater \npiped networks financed under the project, the urban infrastructure built through the ADB project \nwill catalyze private investment in residential, commercial, and mixed-used development. The \nproject fits well with recent objectives of the Government of the PRC to balance future urbanization \nwith greater attention to developing small and medium-sized cities. ADB\u2019s current and future \noperations focus on small and medium-sized cities in the central and western PRC.  \n \n6.  The  project  will  support  private  sector  participation  by  creating  additional  demand  for \nprivatized wastewater treatment services. The existing build-operate-transfer wastewater treatment \nplant in Baise will soon enter the second phase of capital investment. The 12,000 new customers \nin  Dongsun  that  the  project  will  connect  to  the  wastewater  treatment  plant  will  enhance  the \ncommercial viability of that investment.11  \n \n7.  The project is envisaged playing a demonstration role for other cities on how to regenerate \nstrategically located urban land now burdened with outdated and uneconomic industries. Many \nsimilar industrial areas developed under the state-run enterprise industrial model during 1950\u2013\n1960 still exist in cities across the PRC. These areas are characterized by production inefficiency, \nenvironmental degradation, unhealthy living conditions, and inadequate urban infrastructure. The \nmultisector integrated approach to urban redevelopment adopted by the project can be adopted by \nother local governments to transform environmentally degraded neighborhoods into livable mixed-\nuse residential areas. \n                                                \nof contamination at industrial sites, which called for further site investigation and the dismantling of factories and \ncleaning up of the sites). \n8  The PPTA was implemented in two phases. Phase 1 assessed industrial pollution to facilitate project scoping and \ndeveloped environmental management guidelines for the dismantling and cleaning up of the industrial sites in \nDongsun. Phase 2 was conventional PPTA to prepare the proposed project. \n9  The ADB-assisted Urban Knowledge Hub at Tongji University was launched in March 2010 and extended to November \n2017. Outputs include (i) innovative municipal and environmental infrastructure, especially solid waste and wastewater \nmanagement; (ii) regional planning, city cluster development, and economic corridors; (iii) climate change adaptation, \nenergy efficiency, and clean development mechanism; (iv) urban expansion and renewal; (v) urban transport; and (vi) \nlocal government and municipal infrastructure finance. \n10 The population figure is based on functional zoning assumptions about the intensity of development (the ratio of built \nspace to open space), plot coverage and building heights, the total built area, and average occupancy rates. \n11 Currently, there is no wastewater collection system in Dongsun. The project will construct a wastewater collection trunk \nline to take wastewater to the existing build-operate-transfer wastewater treatment plant in Baise  and this will sustain \nwater quality in the local river at Class III, in the PRC water quality standards (Class I to V , Class III is the minimum \nwater quality required for municipal water supply). \n ", "3 \n \n8.  Fit with ADB strategy. The project supports environmentally sustainable and inclusive \neconomic growth, which is a priority of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020.12 It aligns with ADB\u2019s PRC country \npartnership strategy, 2011\u20132015, which supports the government\u2019s strategic goal of building an \neconomically developed society by helping to foster inclusive growth and promoting environmental \nsustainability.13 The project will remove infrastructure constraints, address environmental concerns, \npromote sustainable economic growth, and support community development in Dongsun and more \nbroadly in Baise. It conforms with ADB\u2019s Urban Operational Plan, which fosters competitive, green, \nand inclusive cities,14 and is consistent with the PRC\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015, which \npromotes  environment-friendly  and  resource-efficient  urban  development  and  supports  the \ndevelopment of the western region. At the local level, the project is consistent with Baise\u2019s National \nEconomic  and  Social  Development  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015,  which  emphasizes \neconomic restructuring and urban development and upgrading. \n \n9.  Continuity of development initiatives and incorporated lessons from GZAR. Project \ndesign incorporates lessons from previous ADB-financed urban development projects in GZAR and \nthe  PRC,  as  well  as  relevant  ADB  evaluation  reports.15 In  particular,  the  project  will  support \ncapacity development with a special focus on improving awareness of ADB policy and procedural \nrequirements  to  facilitate  a  smooth  start  to  implementation  and  compliance  with  safeguards \nrequirements, and on strengthening the long-term sustainability of facilities built under the project. \nFurther,  the  project  will  build  institutional  capacity  in  the  agencies  involved  in  project \nimplementation and enable future operation and maintenance (O&M) units. \n \n10.  Innovative  features.  The  special  features  of  the  proposed  project  include  (i)  linkage \nbetween ADB\u2019s knowledge work and sovereign operations as the ADB-supported Tongji University \nKnowledge Hub was engaged by the BMG to prepare the Urban Design Plan and the Control Plan, \n(ii) a focus on redeveloping one geographical area of a city with a broad range of infrastructure and \nenvironmental interventions, and (iii) community upgrading and development to enhance social \nimpacts. Basic social infrastructure will be provided to meet the needs of local residents. At the \nsame time, building the capacity of an existing rural community group and of the BMG will enable \neffective interaction between local residents and municipal authorities during resettlement, housing \ndelivery, and economic development. This feature will include (i) investment in social infrastructure \nsuch  as  a  community  center,  farmer\u2019s  market,  and  waste  transfer  station;  (ii)  community \ndevelopment to strengthen the ability of the Dongsun Subdistrict Neighborhood Committee to \nrepresent the existing population, a mix of rural residents and state workers, while dealing with the \nBMG during redevelopment on issues related to resettlement housing delivery, local economic \ndevelopment planning, and workforce training; and (iii) policy and regulatory development to help \nthe BMG develop processes and institutional mechanisms that integrate public participation into \ncommunity development planning. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  project  impact  will  be  the  development  of  Dongsun  subdistrict  of  Baise  into  an \nenvironment-friendly, inclusive, and livable  urban area. The project outcome will be improved \nurban infrastructure and services in Dongsun. \n \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2008.

The  Dongsun  Urban  Design  Plan  and  the  Control  Plan  emphasize  the  integrated \nconstruction of urban infrastructure. Accordingly, the project includes integrated components or \noutputs in the form of urban infrastructure and associated \u201csoft-side\u201d interventions. The design of \neach component supports the overarching objectives of improving the environment in Dongsun \nand enabling the development of a safe, inclusive, and livable residential community. The project \nhas four outputs, which are summarized below and further detailed in the project administration \nmanual (PAM).16   \n \n(i)  Urban river rehabilitation and flood control. The provision of 4.2 km of new \nembankment along the left bank of the Youjiang River will protect Dongsun from \nonce-in-50-years flooding, and the improvement of 4.0 km of the Dongsun stream \nwill protect Dongsun from once-in-20-year flooding and  improve its flow capacity to \nprotect against urban waterlogging.  \n(ii)  Urban transport and associated infrastructure. The construction of 11.3 km of \nroads, including four bridges across the Dongsun stream, 10.2 km of integrated \nroadside water supply pipeline, 9.85 km of storm water pipeline, and 7.95 km of \nwastewater collection pipelines, and of two bus terminals, will improve Dongsun\u2019s \nurban infrastructure. \n(iii)  Community  upgrading  and  development.  Integrated  community  development \nplanning will include (a) the construction of a 850 square meter (m2) community \nservice center, a 3,000 m2 market for agricultural trade, and a solid waste transfer \nstation with a handling capacity of 50 tons/day; (b) the strengthening of the Dongsun \nNeighborhood Committee;17 and (c) policy and regulatory development.  \n(iv)  Capacity  building  and  project  management.  Institutional  development  and \ncapacity  building  in  integrated  urban  development, 18  ecological  restoration, \ncommunity  development,  the  dismantling  of  obsolete  industrial  facilities,  the \nassessment and remediation of contaminated sites, and project management will \ncontribute to the effective implementation of the project and the sustainable O&M of \nproject facilities. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n13.  The project is estimated to cost $169.5 million (Table 1). \n \n   \n                                                \n16 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Activities in this component will ensure community representation in further urban and economic development planning \nregarding  issues  such  as  the  location  and  provision  of  basic  services,  access  to  training  and  employment \nopportunities, and community maintenance. \n18 An integrated feature is the laying of water supply pipelines and wastewater collection trunk lines along urban road \nalignments.

All project components are designed taking into account local circumstances, topography, \nseismology, and climate, in accordance with the PRC design guidelines and local regulations. The \ndesigns for all project works are based on tested and proven principles, suitable for the local \nclimate, and executable using local construction expertise. River rehabilitation will greatly improve \nthe city\u2019s resilience under climate change,23 while significantly enhancing the urban environment. \nCapacity building to ensure the sustainability of O&M will be financed under the loan.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n20.  Economic analysis. The economic analysis examined the economic viability of each type \nof project intervention and the viability of the project as a whole. Project interventions are expected \nto generate the following economic benefits: (i) savings in vehicle operating costs; (ii) passenger \ntime savings; (iii) road safety benefits; (iv) road maintenance savings; (v) an improved environment \nbrought about by the restoration of the Youjiang river and Dongsun stream, as well as better flood \nprotection for households in the project area; (vi) higher land values brought about by riverbank \nstabilization, soil protection, and solid waste removal; and (vii) higher income brought about by (a) \nthe increase in well-spaced stalls and display areas in the new market, (b) better lighting and \nventilation, (c) more efficient sewerage and solid waste disposal systems, (d) greater shopping \nconvenience, (e) wider consumer choice, and (f) more sanitary market conditions. The project \neconomic internal rate of return is estimated at 16.49% and is generally robust when subjected to \nstandard sensitivity analysis.  \n \n21.  Financial sustainability analysis. Financial sustainability was analyzed to assess fiscal \nsustainability and the capacity of the BMG to repay the debt. The trends of economic growth and \ntotal revenues and expenditures were analyzed.  Annual funding to be made available during \nimplementation  ranges from  CNY51.19  million  in  2018  to  CNY172.21  million  in  2015, for  an \naverage of CNY111.70 million over 5 years. Average annual counterpart funding equals 0.41% of \nprojected revenues during implementation. Annual forecast O&M and debt service is 0.21% of \nprojected annual revenues in 2019, the first year of ADB loan repayment. The analysis concludes \nthat the financial burden imposed by the project is relatively small and that counterpart financing \nand  loan  repayments  can  be  covered  under  the  government  budget.  These  results  indicate \nacceptable fiscal risk, as it is expected that BMG financial revenues will grow in line with economic \ndevelopment. Financial analysis of the water and wastewater pipeline installation portion of the \nurban roadwork indicates that these revenue-generating subcomponents are financially viable. The \noverall financial internal rate of return is estimated at 5.70%, higher than the weighted average cost \nof capital estimated at 1.78% for wastewater handling and 1.82% for water supply. \n \n                                                \n22 Includes about 8,700 current residents and 25,300 new residents.  \n23 Water level calculations required for the design of river embankments and the revision of the flood emergency \npreparedness and response mechanism will consider the impacts of future climate change. \n ", "8 \nC.  Governance \n22.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained with the GZARG \nand the municipal governments. Financial management assessment concluded that the BDIG and \nthe BPMO have general experience in managing foreign-financed projects, including ADB-financed \nprojects, but still require significant training and support on ADB policies and procedures, including \nprocurement, disbursement, and project management. The GZAR Provincial Finance Department, \nwhich will operate and administer the imprest account, has extensive experience administering \nprojects financed by ADB and other foreign sources. It was agreed that the implementing agency \nwould strengthen its financial management capability to manage the project by (i) establishing \ninternal audit arrangements, (ii) undertaking training on ADB policy and procedural requirements, \nand (iii) seeking external financial management assistance as needed. The project\u2019s financial \nmanagement risk rating is low to medium after considering mitigation. The identified financial \nmanagement risks will be closely monitored during project implementation. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n23.  The project is expected to create positive social benefits through improvements to the \nurban environment, infrastructure, and living conditions in Dongsun, which has a rural poverty \nincidence of 9.8% and an urban poverty incidence of 3.8%. The existing resident population is \n8,694, and the future resident population is expected to be 34,000.24 The projected 75,000 indirect \nbeneficiaries include residents of other subdistricts of Baise who will use the space and facilities \ndeveloped  in  Dongsun.  The  project  will  directly  create  1,455  jobs,  1,000  of  them  during \nconstruction and 455 during operation; 15,400 jobs through the development of local real estate; \nand  16,490  long-term  opportunities  in  commercial  services,  business  offices,  hotels,  and \ncommunity  employment.  To  reinforce  the  positive  benefits  of  improved  transport,  solid  waste \ncollection, and river rehabilitation, the BMG and Youjiang District Government will conduct public \nprograms  on  road  safety,  public  sanitation,  and  environmental  awareness  during  project \nimplementation. The component on community upgrading and development will (i) provide social \ninfrastructure to residents, (ii) foster the development of a community organization to represent \nresidents during the transition to a new community and help define future economic development \nand public participation, and (iii) support the BMG in creating best practice policies to address \nsocial risks in new area development. The social action plan will be supervised and monitored by a \nsocial development specialist under project management consulting services.   \n \n24.  Gender  benefits.  The  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The \ngender analysis found that women support the project and anticipate benefits in mobility, access, \nsafety  and  security,  employment,  an  improved  living  environment,  and  more  effective  public \nparticipation and representation in local development planning. A gender action plan has been \nprepared to (i) enhance women\u2019s participation in project activities; (ii) provide gender-sensitivity \ntraining to BDIG and BPMO staff; (iii) ensure that project decision-making bodies and capacity-\nbuilding  activities  are  gender  balanced;  and  (iv)  include  gender  targets,  indicators,  and  sex-\ndisaggregated data for project monitoring and evaluation. The project will (i) protect public health \nthrough solid waste management; (ii) improve access, safety, and mobility for women by ensuring \npedestrian access and public transport within the new area and connecting to Baise city center; (iii) \nimprove traffic safety; (iv) increase job opportunities for women; and (v) encourage women to \nparticipate in community development institutions. \n \n                                                \n24  Based  on  the  estimate  of  Baise\u2019s  future  population  in  Guangxi  Baise  Dongsun  Subdistrict  Integrated  Urban \nEnvironment Improvement Project Planning Study. ", "9 \nE.  Safeguards \n25.  The project is classified category B for environment. An initial environmental examination, \nincluding  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  complying  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009), was prepared and disclosed on the ADB website in June 2013. The project will \nnot result in significant environment impacts. Environmental management measures defined in the \nEMP will contain the impacts to acceptable levels. While the project will not intrude on industrial \nsites, the BMG will be provided with capacity building in brownfield management to ensure that \nfuture site clean-up and redevelopment follow international best practice25 and comply with national \nlegislation.  The  BMG  disclosed  environment  information  to  potentially  affected  people.  Any \nenvironmental complaints or disputes will be handled in accordance with the grievance-redress \nmechanism developed for the project.  \n \n26.  The project is classified category A for resettlement and category B for indigenous peoples. \nThe BMG has prepared a resettlement and ethnic minority development plan (REMDP) to cover \nland acquisition, resettlement, and indigenous peoples issues. The preliminary impact survey found \nthat the project will adversely affect residents, enterprises, and stores.26 A total of 759.01 mu27 of \nland will be occupied permanently, including 547.34 mu of village collective land in Dongsun and \n211.67 mu of state-owned land. The acquisition of village collective land will adversely affect 246 \nfarm households with 854 members; 151 rural households with 511 members and 214 urban \nhouseholds with 673 members will lose their homes. Also, 8 enterprises with 174 operators and \nemployees and 15 stores with 45 operators and employees will be affected. The project will \npermanently affect 570 households with 2,035 members, and 65 households with 258 members \nwill suffer temporary impacts, for a total of 635 households with 2,293 members.28 The REMDP \nwas endorsed by the BMG and disclosed to affected people through the distribution of REMDP \ninformation booklets published in Mandarin. Copies of the REMDP were provided to relevant local \noffices, made accessible to the affected people, and uploaded to the ADB website in June 2013.29 \nThe implementation of the REMDP will be monitored by the BMG internally through semiannual \nprogress reports. The BPMO will engage an external monitor, who will also provide monitoring and \nevaluation reports semiannually.  \n \n27.  The REMDP defines the measures to mitigate the negative impacts of resettlement on the \nlocal ethnic minority population. The Zhuang ethnic minority is the majority in GZAR and Baise. In \nthe total population of Dongsun, 39% are Zhuang. The proportion of ethnic minorities among urban \nresidents of Dongsun is, at 29%, lower than among rural residents (83%) because many former \nenterprise employees are Han from other parts of the PRC. In the Baise urban area, the Zhuang \npeople live harmoniously with the Han, and most are bilingual in Zhuang and Mandarin. The \nZhuang in Dongsun are distinct from mainstream society with respect to their customary cultural \nand  social  institutions.  Consultation  with  Zhuang  people  in  communities  in  the  project  area \nrevealed that the negative impacts on ethnic minorities are resettlement and the future loss of their \nfarmland to urbanization. The monitoring of the REMDP and of social and gender dimensions will \ninclude analysis by ethnicity.  \n \n                                                \n25 ASTM International. 2005.

West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. \n26 A census and detailed measurement survey can be conducted only upon the finalization of detailed project design. \n27 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 m2). \n28 There are households affected by both land acquisition and house demolition, and by temporary acquisition. They are \nonly counted once.  \n29 ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) adjusted the terminology for involuntary resettlement, changing \"affected \npersons\" to \"displaced persons,\" who were defined as persons physically and/or economically displaced by involuntary \nacquisition of land or involuntary restrictions on land use or on access to legally designated parks and protected areas. \nAlthough resettlement plans for ADB projects in the PRC maintain the original terminology of \u201caffected persons,\u201d this is \nequivalent to the new Safeguard Policy Statement definition of \u201cdisplaced persons.\u201d \n ", "10 \nF.

ASSURANCES  \n29.  The government, the GZARG, and the BMG have assured ADB that the implementation of \nthe project will conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described \nin the PAM and loan documents. The government, the GZARG and the BMG have agreed with \nADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan and project agreements.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n30.
