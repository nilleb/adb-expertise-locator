This  is  an  eligible  transaction  under  the  Faster  Approach  to  Small  Nonsovereign \nTransactions (FAST) framework.1  The transaction involves an equity investment of the Indian \nrupee  equivalent  of  up  to  $1,500,000  to  Micro-Credit  Ratings  International  Limited  for \nStrengthening the Microfinance Ecosystem Project.  \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n2.  Microfinance institutions (MFIs) are a critical means of expanding financial inclusion and \nreducing poverty. They play an indispensable role in helping lower-income people obtain access \nto finance and mitigate the adversities stemming from the unreliability of their income. MFIs \nhave become vital in delivering credit and financial services to the smallest and remotest \nsegments of the lower-income population, i.e., those deemed least creditworthy, who do not \nhave direct access to credit from commercial banking systems in developing member countries \n(DMCs). This microfinance ecosystem comprises (i) consumers or end-borrowers who rightfully \nexpect sustained access to financial services on fair and transparent terms; (ii) MFIs with vastly \nvarying business and operating models which deliver these services; (iii) a divergent set of MFI \nfinanciers, ranging from commercial lenders and for-profit investors to multilateral and bilateral \ndevelopment banks, and aid and donor agencies with some overlapping interests; and (iv) \nregulators,  which  bear  the  overwhelming  responsibility  of  setting  the  standards  and  crisis \nprevention rules, while allowing generally unhindered entry to players in the sector. \n \n3.  While the prominence and outreach of MFIs has increased, this has also resulted in an \nexcess  lending  capacity  within  certain  countries  and  sub-locations,  increasing  competition, \nfocus on short-term profitability and growth, and inadequate attention to internal processes \nrelating  to  client  evaluation,  arrears  and  recovery  practices,  and  risk  management.  These \nfactors have, in some instances, resulted in over-indebtedness, heightened systemic risks of \ncontagion, and strict regulatory actions in some DMCs.2  \n \n4.  MFIs are also required to perform several critical functions and adhere to standards that \ncan extend substantially beyond the requirements stipulated by local regulators to sustain their \nlending  operations.  The  challenges  faced  by  MFIs  and  the  spill  over  effect  of  these  into \naccessing  institutional finance  are  well  captured  in  the  annual  Microfinance  Banana  Skins \nsurveys.3 These reports have consistently found unregulated operations, weak credit control, \ninadequate quality of management and governance, and mismanagement of market competition \nto be key industry risks. At the other end in this ecosystem, financiers can also face significant \nchallenges  in  dealing  with  MFIs.  The  increasing  variability  in  MFI  operating  models, \nunsophisticated  accounting  and  disclosure  practices  in  certain  instances,  and  portfolio \nmanagement and data quality issues can pose unanticipated credit and reputational risks. This \n                                                 \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2015.  Faster Approach to Small Nonsovereign Transactions.  Manila. \n2  For example, the measures introduced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in August 2012 and July 2014, which \nplaced caps on interest rates and loan processing fees, loan amounts, tenors, and maximum allowable loans per \nborrower, were undertaken to limit over-indebtedness and ensure fair practices.  \n3  The survey is conducted by the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation. Microfinance Banana Skins 2014 \ndescribes the risks facing the microfinance industry as seen by an international sample of practitioners, investors, \nregulators,  and  observers.  This  survey  was  conducted  in  January  and  February  2014  and  is  based  on \n306 responses from 70 countries. It updates previous surveys carried out in 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2012. ", "2   \n     \nwidening  gap  between  the  financier\u2019s  understanding  of  MFI  operations;  and  the  latter\u2019s \nsometimes limited abilities to enhance their operating and disclosure standards, creates the \nbusiness opportunity for specialized unbiased third-party advisory and rating service providers \nlike M-CRIL.  \n \n5.  The investment identification process for the project attempted to bridge these separate \nbut  intertwined  issues  and  strengthen  the  ecosystem  of  microfinance  thereby  increasing   \nprivate sector investment in this sector.4 The investment opportunity was selected after detailed \ncomparative assessments. Micro-Credit Ratings International Limited (M-CRIL) was selected \nbecause of its relative advantages and competitive strengths as compared with other micro-\ncredit  ratings  agencies  serving  the  Asia-Pacific  region.  M-CRIL  is  a  specialized  advisory, \nratings, policy-research, and training company of global repute. There are 3 global specialized \nmicrofinance rating agencies and M-CRIL together with Microfinanza, actively covers Asia. It \nfocuses on the financial, social, and developmental aspects of the microfinance ecosystem.5 \nInvesting in M-CRIL will help strengthen the microfinance system in countries in which it is \ncurrently operational (India and Myanmar, where M-CRIL has established offices) and assist it \nto expand elsewhere in emerging Asia (Cambodia, Indonesia, Nepal, and the People's Republic \nof China [PRC] markets which are presently being covered from the existing offices). In India, \nADB\u2019s investment is critical for M-CRIL to obtain registration with the Securities and Exchange \nBoard of India (SEBI) and accreditation from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as a credit rating \nagency (CRA).6 M-CRIL\u2019s rating activities are currently limited to select MFIs and their specific \nloan portfolios, as permitted by applicable regulations. While commercial banks which lend to \nMFIs (or purchase securities) in India can still benefit from M-CRIL\u2019s ratings, the ratings cannot \nbe utilized for banks\u2019 capital-allocation decisions, posing a severe limitation on their application \nand on the overall business model of M-CRIL.   \n \n6.  The proposed investment builds on ADB\u2019s ongoing and previous engagement with MFIs. \nOver the past 3 decades, the involvement of ADB's Private Sector Operations Department with \nMFIs  has  largely  been  a  subset  of  its  work  on  enabling  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized \nenterprise financing, which primarily involves extending long-term credit lines for on-lending to \nspecified  borrowers  such  as  MFIs;  a  pillar  in  this  initiative  was  the  Microfinance  Risk \nParticipation and Guarantee Program.7 The investment in M-CRIL will strengthen institutional \ncapacities  within  the  sector,  which  will  substantially  supplement  ongoing  funding  and  will \nultimately broaden access to finance for lower-income borrowers. \n \n                                                 \n4  The critical consideration for lenders and financiers here is not limited to commercial and credit risk-related \naspects, but on the fairness and transparency with which MFIs handle their borrowing clients. The incidence of \nMFIs exploiting the vulnerability of borrowers can be severely detrimental to their lenders or financiers from a \nreputational aspect.   \n5  In several countries, private and state-owned banks that are unable or ill-positioned to cover this underserved \ncategory now use MFIs as agents or independent channel to deliver credit, savings, insurance, and other financial \nproducts and services.   \n6  Applicable SEBI regulations require that a CRA have a minimum net worth of Rs50 million, in addition to which the \nCRA must have a promoter shareholder (holding at least 10% of the CRA) meeting certain eligibility criteria, one of \nwhich is a minimum net worth of Rs1 billion. In the absence of CRA accreditation, M-CRIL is unable to rate public \nsecurities, and its ratings cannot be used by banks for capital adequacy purposes. It is expected that M-CRIL will \nmeet these and other applicable requirements once ADB\u2019s investment enables M-CRIL to serve these markets. \n7  ADB. 2010. The Microfinance Risk Participating and Guarantee Program. Manila. The $190 million program \nprovides guarantees and risk participations for loans made by commercial banks for MFIs in South Asia. An \nadditional amount of $50 million was approved under this program in October 2015. As of 2016, the program has \nsupported 19 MFIs, and approximately $370 million of loans were facilitated, supporting over 2 million borrowers, \n97% of whom are women.  \n ", "3 \n \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n7.  Given the long-dated track record, client-profile consisting of eminent commercial and \ndevelopmental institutions, and its prominent coverage in Asia; M-CRIL is considered to be one \nof the most reputable and established independent agencies for microfinance related advisory, \nratings,  policy-research,  and  publication-focused  services  in  the  region.  It  offers  a  well-\ndiversified  range  of  products  while  simultaneously  maintaining  its  focus  on  its  core \ncompetencies of MFI assessments and ratings, which cover financial performance, governance \nand transparency, operations and portfolio quality, and social performance. As a pioneer in \ndeveloping rating frameworks and related assessment services, M-CRIL has completed over \n1,500 microfinance ratings, assessments, portfolio audits, evaluations, business planning review \nexercises, risk-diagnostic assessments, and microfinance-related sector reviews and financial \nadvisory assignments across 32 countries. ADB also has a long-standing relationship with M-\nCRIL,  utilizing  the  company\u2019s  research,  training,  and  rating  expertise  in  supporting  ADB\u2019s \nmicrofinance lending operations.  \n \n8.  M-CRIL has a three-pronged strategy that will be facilitated by ADB\u2019s investment. This \nentails  (i)  the  merger  with  its  parent,  EDA  Rural  Systems  Private  Limited  (EDA); \n(ii) strengthening the company\u2019s staff, resources, and internal processes to expand outreach \nand  market  share  in  India  once  it  obtains  CRA  accreditation;  and  (iii)  utilizing  its  current \nexperience, skills, competence, and client relationships to widen its geographic coverage by \nestablishing more permanent operations in the identified key markets of Cambodia, Indonesia, \nMyanmar, Nepal, and the PRC. It is expected that M-CRIL will complete its overseas expansion \nbetween fiscal year (FY) 2017 and FY2020, and will prioritize Myanmar, Indonesia, and the \nPRC8 in the first phase.  \n \n9.  After the investment and subsequent to CRA accreditation, it is estimated that M-CRIL \nwill regain market share in its domestic MFI ratings business\u2014from its current level of 7% to \nabout 20%.9 Growth is forecast to be more pronounced in 2017\u20132018, after which it would \nnormalize to more moderate levels of 12%-15% per annum. Similarly, revenue growth in the key \nnon-rating segments, chiefly the Client Protection Principles (CPP)10 and the social impact \nratings  or  assessment,  which  constitute  50%  of  the  total  revenue  base,  is  expected  to \naccelerate after the investment.11 The proportion of its domestic and overseas revenues is \nexpected to become equal (now 80% of revenues come from overseas operations).  \n                                                 \n8  M-CRIL has some experience in these markets, with a joint venture initiated in the PRC, which later had to be \ndissolved because of an internal decision of its partner. M-CRIL is now in discussion with the Fangzhun Credit \nAnalysis Company of Shanghai for a new partnership. The timing for executing the expansion plans also depends \non obtaining necessary regulatory approvals.   \n9 This is a conservative estimate.  Prior to the changes in the RBI\u2019s accreditation policies for CRAs (announced in \n2013), M-CRIL held a nearly 60% share of the MFI credit ratings business in India, which migrated to other CRAs \nafter this regulatory change. M-CRIL is expected to re-attract its previous clients, which are still dealing with the \ncompany for its non-rating services (such as implementing the Client Protection Principles (CPP) and assessing \nsocial impacts), and are very familiar with M-CRIL\u2019s ratings approach, expertise and reputation, and understand the \nvalue that M-CRIL\u2019s work adds to their operations.  \n10 The CPP are defined in the Smart Campaign for Microfinance, which supports full transparency in pricing, terms, \nand conditions of all financial products offered by MFIs to their lower-income client base. Smart Microfinance is \nworking with clients to prevent over-indebtedness or purchase of products they do not need or understand. CPP \nalso involves employing respectful collection practices and adopting high ethical standards in the treatment of \nclients.  \n11 This business segment is forecast to grow at a faster pace in 2017\u20132018, responding to new staff hiring and \nopening of permanent offices in other DMC markets. This will increase M-CRIL\u2019s capacity and broad-base its \n   ", "4   \n     \n10.  EDA is engaged in the nonfinancial ratings-related businesses of microfinance and rural \ndevelopment, such as social performance ratings, assessment of financial inclusiveness, social \nimpact studies, and adoption of and training in CPP. With the merger of EDA and M-CRIL, the \nbusiness, product, and client portfolio of the combined entity will benefit from both revenue and \ngeographic diversification, lower operating costs, and reduced organizational redundancies, \nwhile still retaining overall focus and specialization. \n \nC.   Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n11.  Ownership. M-CRIL was established in 1999 in response to the need for performance \nassessments of small microfinance service providers. M-CRIL was developed through EDA, \nwhich was established in 1983 and holds about 91% of M-CRIL; the balance is owned by M-\nCRIL  employees.  M-CRIL  and  EDA  are  about  to merge under  a  process  expected  to  be \ncompleted  by  July  2016.  M-CRIL  will  be  the  surviving  entity  carrying  on  the  combined \nbusinesses of M-CRIL and EDA. The founders of M-CRIL, Sanjay Sinha and Frances Sinha, are \nthe predominant owners of EDA, together holding almost 100% (with a small minority share held \nby  a  key  employee).  M-CRIL  has  one  wholly  owned  subsidiary  incorporated  in  Myanmar, \nestablished to carry on its operations there.12 Due diligence was conducted in accordance with \nthe  Integrity  Due  Diligence  Guidelines  for  Nonsovereign  Operations,  and  no  significant  or \npotentially significant integrity issues were identified.13 \n \n12.   Completion of the merger between M-CRIL and EDA will be a condition precedent to \nADB\u2019s investment and will result in the creation of a full-service entity covering both the financial \nand the social aspects of microfinance. The merged entity will have a wider revenue, product, \nand client base with unaudited combined revenues of about Rs90 million and a combined net \nworth of about Rs85 million as of FY2016. The founders have also initiated measures to transfer \nownership of part of the company to key staff pursuant to an employee stock option plan. By \nFY2020, after the merger and after full deployment of ADB\u2019s investment, ownership of M-CRIL \nis expected to be shared by the founders (60%), ADB (25%), and employees (15%). \n \n13.  Management and governance structure. M-CRIL is professionally managed, with a \nstrong team of experienced and well-qualified staff in various positions across its business \ndevelopment,  analytical  and  financial  analysis  functions,  operations,  and  research  and \npublications.  M-CRIL  understands  the  need  to  further  strengthen  the  management  team, \nstreamline its internal processes, and bring greater specialization and decentralization to its \noperations as a critical part of its post-investment activities.    \n \n14.  Despite  its  historically  closely  held  ownership,  M-CRIL  follows  high  standards  of \ntransparency  and  governance  and  has  established  a  board  with  strong  backgrounds  and \nexperiences  in  finance  sector  regulation,  MFI  industry  operations,  rural  and  commercial \nbanking,  and  academia,  to  oversee  its  operations.  Five  of  the  seven  board members  are \n                                                                                                                                                             \npresence for such assignments. As these services are also often bundled with financial ratings, these will likely \nincrease in tandem. \n12  Sanjay Sinha directly owns 0.004% (1 share) of M-CRIL Myanmar Limited.  \n13 In March 2016, the United States Treasury issued an advisory that Myanmar had made progress in substantially \naddressing the FATF action plan at a technical level. Consequently, FATF removed Myanmar from the FATF \nPublic Statement and now includes the jurisdiction in its Improving Global Anti Money Laundering (AML) and \nCountering Financing of Terrorism (CFT) Compliance ongoing process. Myanmar is not a member of the Global \nForum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes and has thus not been rated. Due \ndiligence in relation to M-CRIL's relatively minor Myanmar operations has been undertaken and no material \nintegrity risks were identified.  \n ", "5 \n \nindependent; the chairman (Malcolm Harper) is a globally renowned expert in microfinance and \nsocial development. The board meets at least four times a year to oversee the company\u2019s \noperations; assesses and helps direct key businesses, reviews the human resource strategy \nand policies, and decisions related to investment or expansion; and provides independent \noversight of the analytical rigor and consistency of M-CRIL\u2019s products and services.  \n \n15.  M-CRIL follows a well-established protocol in the conduct of its social and financial \nratings and assessments. The rating process starts with desk analysis of information and a \nsubsequent field visit to the head office and operational branches, and the borrowers of the MFI. \nUnlike mainstream rating agencies, intensive field visits and interaction with clients are at the \ncore of the M-CRIL approach. The M-CRIL ratings team prepares a detailed assessment report, \ncross-checks the data with the specific MFI (without discussing or disclosing the rating), and \nsubsequently ensures an adequate quality review by its senior management. As M-CRIL has \nperformed reviews, assessments, and diagnostics on MFIs in the same geographic region, it is \nwell placed for a comparative analysis and performance benchmarking. The final report, along \nwith additional factual details and data provided by the rated institution, is submitted to the rating \ncommittee, composed entirely of independent microfinance experts. \n \nD.   Financial Performance \n \n16.  M-CRIL\u2019s  financial  performance  is  characterized  by  stable  revenue  growth,  which \nbenefits substantially from the wide range of services and a diverse client profile. As discussed, \nthe effect of the rapid tapering in its ratings-related business was offset by rising contributions \nfrom CPP assessments, client certifications, and social performance ratings of MFIs (Table 1). \nThe technical assistance and advisory work, which is usually linked to larger-scale projects with \nlonger completion cycles, also mitigated this impact. Notwithstanding this variability, M-CRIL\u2019s \nrevenues grew by an average of 15% in 2008\u20132015, with a tapering effect in the latter years. \n \nTable 1: Revenue Share by Segment \nRevenue Share by Segment 2010-11 2011-12 2012-13 2013-14 2014-15\nCredit Rating 41.9% 60.6% 22.2% 12.6% 10.4%\nResearch/Assessment/Social Performance 20.0% 17.1% 18.9% 39.1% 43.4%\nTechnical Assistance, Advisory  8.5% 5.9% 33.7% 28.6% 21.0%\nOthers 5.9% 0.2% 3.1% 0.4% 2.4%\nTraining 7.1% 0.0% 1.3% 12.1% 4.0%\nLivelihoods Programs 16.6% 16.2% 21.0% 7.2% 18.9%\nConsolidated revenue 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0%  \n \n17.  M-CRIL has maintained relatively steady operating and earnings before interest, taxes, \ndepreciation,  and  amortization  margins  since  FY2010,  after  bringing  in  the  requisite \nadjustments. M-CRIL\u2019s cost base primarily consists of salaries for staff and fixed operating \nexpenses (about 80% of costs), making the number and client-profile of completed assignments \na key driver of operating profitability. The overseas assignments tend to have better payment \nterms and make a dominant contribution to profits, although they typically block staff resources \nfor  longer  periods.  The  domestic  assignments,  specifically  ratings,  are  on  more  price-\ncompetitive terms, but tend to be shorter engagements and allow for higher staff rotation. Given \nthat the share of these two markets will remain roughly equal, the earnings before interest, \ntaxes, depreciation, and amortization margin is expected to improve to  18%\u201320% (from a \ncurrent average of about 15%), with a build-up in domestic ratings. M-CRIL\u2019s move to its own \npremises in the second quarter of 2015 removed the drag of rental payments. M-CRIL has \nconsistently ploughed back all earnings, declaring no dividends, which reflects the founders\u2019 \napproach to building the organization.  \n   ", "6   \n     \n \n18.  Given its relatively simple business model and conservative accounting treatment, M-\nCRIL\u2019s balance sheet position reflects (i) substantial liquidity (current ratio in excess of 5x); \n(ii) consistent debt-free position; (iii) deployment of profits into liquid investments (cash and \nbank balances average 20% of assets); (iv) M-CRIL\u2019s office premises (book value of about \nRs30 million, current market value higher); and (v) a reasonably managed working capital cycle.  \nThe deposits and investments are a source of interest or dividend income to the company. \n \n19.  M-CRIL\u2019s  historical  focus  has  been  on  delivering  outstanding  work  quality  and \npositioning itself as a practice leader in microfinance activities in the region, rather than pursuing \nmarket share and higher volumes of assignments. M-CRIL\u2019s founders and staff actively pursue \nseveral  publication  and  representation  activities,  which  showcase  the  firm\u2019s  technical \ncompetence and build its brand equity even if these may not be directly revenue-accretive. \nDespite its focus on setting eminent standards through its work, M-CRIL\u2019s 5-year average return \non assets is at 9%, and return on equity is at 13%. Given the sustained profitability and \nreinvestment of all earnings, the book value of M-CRIL\u2019s shares increased by 1.7x over a 5-year \nperiod. In the context of the company\u2019s business, a liability-free status and clear capital structure \nare good indicators of the shareholder value created by the company.  \n \nIII.

The ADB assistance consists of an equity investment of the Indian rupee equivalent of \nup to $1.5 million in the form of new shares to be issued by M-CRIL after its merger with EDA. \nThis is expected to constitute 25% of the share capital of the company.14 ADB will have the right \nto  nominate  a  board  member,  and  minority  protection  rights  consistent  with  those  usually \nobtained by ADB for such investments.  \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s investment  will (i) bolster M-CRIL\u2019s balance sheet to enable it to pursue its \nexpansion in the DMCs outlined above; (ii) assist with institutional strengthening to enhance its \ndomestic  operations;  and  (iii)  facilitate  M-CRIL\u2019s  transition  to  an  accredited  CRA.  ADB\u2019s \ninvestment  plan  will  follow  a  phased  approach  matched  to  achieving  CRA  accreditation, \nimplementing the employee stock option plan, and ensuring compliance with ADB\u2019s investment \nlimits. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n14 ADB\u2019s investment will not exceed 25% of M-CRIL\u2019s issued share capital nor result in ADB being the single largest \nshareholder of M-CRIL. \n ", "7 \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  will  monitor  the  project.  M-CRIL  will \nprovide  ADB  with  financial  reports  at  predetermined  regular  intervals.  These  will  include \n(i) quarterly reporting of key financial parameters, (ii) audited financial statements on an annual \nbasis, and (iii) annual reporting on selected development indicators agreed by ADB and M-\nCRIL.  Monitoring  reports  will  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  ADB  regularly  and  at  least \nannually.15 The first report will be submitted no later than 12 months after the first disbursement. \nAs a condition precedent to ADB\u2019s investment, M-CRIL will be required to provide a business \nplan that outlines the next steps toward (i) regulatory approvals for  accreditation in India; \n(ii) regional expansion in the pre-specified markets by opening regional or in-country offices; \nand (iii) strengthening the organizational resources and skills base by hiring staff, providing \ntraining, and upgrading its information technology.  \n \nC.   Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n23.  ADB is expected to provide the following value additions: \n(i)  Support financial inclusion. ADB\u2019s funding will help M-CRIL further expand in \nIndia and across Asia, creating opportunities to service a much wider client base \nof MFIs that lend to lower-income borrowers.   \n(ii)  Strengthen microfinance industry and catalyze private sector funding for \nmicrofinance  institutions.  Providing  uniform  and  transparent  credit  ratings \nagainst industry benchmarks and across multiple countries is expected to provide \ncomfort to private sector financiers, thereby directing incremental capital to this \nindustry.  \n(iii)  Create value as a strategic shareholder. The proceeds of ADB\u2019s investment \nwill help support  M-CRIL\u2019s capital requirements until FY2019. As a strategic \npartner, ADB will provide value through a nominee director to the board and \npotentially attract future funding. Importantly, ADB\u2019s investment will enable M-\nCRIL to qualify as an accredited CRA in India.   \n(iv)  Support  women  borrowers.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  will  help  improve  access  to \nfinance for women, who are the predominant borrowers from MFIs. The project \nhas been classified as effective gender mainstreaming and will further boost \nsupport to women. \n \nD.    Risks \n \n24.  Key risks of the proposed project are:   \n(i)  Capacity risks. The founders\u2019 and management\u2019s ability to scale up M-CRIL\u2019s \noperations and execute them under the proposed business plan is a key risk. \nHowever, M-CRIL\u2019s track record in these markets, its ability to attract and retain \nstaff, the employee stock option plan, and the institutional links with ADB will help \nminimize this risk. \n(ii)  Regulatory  risks.  The  microfinance  sector  remains  exposed  to  regulatory \nchanges, particularly as various regulators seek to strengthen their supervisory \noversight of MFIs. Historically, however, the alignment between the regulators\u2019 \npriorities and M-CRIL\u2019s role in strengthening the microfinance ecosystem has \nbeen high.  \n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2013. Nonsovereign Operations. Operations Manual. OM D10/BP. Manila. \n   ", "8   \n     \n(iii)  Sector  concentration  risk.  M-CRIL  has  acquired  noteworthy  competencies, \nreputation, and a position of expertise in the microfinance ecosystem,  but it \nremains focused on this segment. Historically, however, M-CRIL has shown its \nability to grow its relevance in line with the evolving priorities of stakeholders in \nthe MFI sector.  \n(iv)  Key  person  and  transition  risks.  Given  the  long  history  of  the  founders\u2019 \n \ninvolvement and the strong brand association, a key person risk exists. However, \nthis risk should decline over time as the founders are transitioning M-CRIL to an \neven  more  professionally  managed  and  employee-owned  company.  The \nfounders are also implementing decentralization initiatives. The founders have \ncommitted to retaining the majority ownership of M-CRIL while ADB remains a \nshareholder. \n(v)  Reputational  risk.    ADB\u2019s  investment  will  allow  M-CRIL  to  graduate  to  an \neligible CRA status in India. Various funders or other stakeholders supporting \nfinancial inclusion initiatives may associate ADB\u2019s name with the company and \nits products.  Should the company be unsuccessful in its business plan, there \nmay be an implied expectation of additional support from ADB, given its visibility \nas a large institution.  The most important safeguard against reputational risk is \nthe long-run track record of M-CRIL\u2019s and EDA\u2019s operations. \n(vi)  Exit  risk.  The  entry  valuation  assumes  an  adequately  conservative  growth \nprojection, which lowers the risk of ADB overpaying on its investment. However, \ninvesting in a small organization in a specialized field limits the exit options. ADB \nhas sought to minimize this risk by negotiating a broad range of exit rights, \nincluding buyback arrangements for its stake.  \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.   Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n25.  Project output and outcome. The core outputs of ADB\u2019s investment of growth capital \ninto M-CRIL are the (i) establishment of M-CRIL as a regional, professionally managed entity, \noffering a diverse suite of MFI assessment, advisory, and social and financial rating services; \nand (ii) establishment of M-CRIL as an accredited CRA in India.   \n \n26.  The core outcome will be sustained poverty reduction in the region through MFI lending \nthat is pro-poor, protects client interests, and is undertaken in a socially responsible manner. A \nwider application of services by M-CRIL and associated improvements made by the MFIs will \nlead to sustained access to funding from financiers, resulting in an expansion of the coverage \nareas and client base of these entities. The proposed investment sets a good example of the \nFinance++ approach, a step in fostering transfer of knowledge and skills within the Asian region. \nM-CRIL will also have an opportunity to extensively capitalize on ADB\u2019s internal knowledge \nbase and long-established support and involvement in developing rating agencies in Asia.16 \n \n \n \n                                                 \n16 This investment will utilize the expertise developed through the Office of Regional Integration and its work with the \nAssociation of Asian Credit Rating Agencies, along with ADB\u2019s balance-sheet-based investing capacity, to foster \nregional expansion of locally developed institutions like M-CRIL. \n ", "9 \n \n \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n27.  Finance sector development is listed as one of five core specializations for operational \nfocus under Strategy 2020, and re-emphasized in the midterm review of April 2014.17 This, \nalong  with  the  related  midterm  review  objectives\u2014consumer  protection,  financial  literacy, \ndevelopment  of  regulatory  and  supervisory  frameworks,  as  well  as  investment  in  risk \nmanagement  policies,  for  covering  the  unserved  and  underserved  populations\u2014fits  very \nstrongly with the core objectives of the proposed equity investment in M-CRIL.   \n \n28.  According to the country partnership strategy for India, 2013\u20132017, ADB\u2019s nonsovereign \noperations  will  continue  to  support  the  infrastructure  and  finance  sectors  by  undertaking \nselective  projects  for  physical  and  social  infrastructure  and  financial  infrastructure.18  The \nproposed transaction will support the development of microfinance in India, one of the financial \ninfrastructures  identified  in  the  country  partnership  strategy,  and  a  high  priority  for  the \ngovernment with growing emphasis on including private sector financing. Within this domain, the \ngovernment  and  regulators  have  strongly  emphasized  better  standards  of  transparency, \ngovernance, risk management and reporting for MFIs, which is the key thematic focus of the \nproposed  investment.19  This  investment  also  supports  various  other  country  partnership \nstrategies related to the project.20 \n \n29.  In 2000, recognizing that the financial landscape had changed, ADB formulated and \napproved  the  Microfinance  Development  Strategy,  which  identifies  inadequate  financial \ninfrastructure, more specifically regulatory and supervisory systems, as a constraint to further \ngrowth of MFIs. The Microfinance Development Strategy also names investing and \u201cdeveloping \nfinancial infrastructure\u201d as a key component of ADB\u2019s sector strategy. Investing in  M-CRIL \naligns very well with these recommendations, by delivering a very high multiplier impact from \nthe investment. This positive attribute was also very well established in the previous three \ninvestments by ADB\u2014in CRISIL India, Rating Agency Malaysia, and Thailand Rating Services \nLimited,  which  became  pillar  institutions  in  their  local  markets  and  yielded  very  positive \ndevelopmental results for ADB. Since the microfinance client base consists predominantly of \nwomen and the investment\u2019s objective is sustained and fair access to credit and financial \nservices for MFI borrowers, M-CRIL also links well with the priorities identified in ADB\u2019s Gender \nEquality and Women's Empowerment Operational Plan, 2013\u20132020.21  \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n30.  The  proposed  investment  is  classified  as  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).

Information disclosure and consultation with affected people \nwill be conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s requirements. \n \n31.  The investment in M-CRIL is expected to result in greater access to finance for low-\nincome borrowers, comprising 90% women in mostly rural and semiurban areas, and has been \ncategorized as effective gender mainstreaming. M-CRIL has prepared and is committed to \nimplementing  a  gender  action  plan  outlining  the  activities  and  targets  to  achieve  greater \nfinancial access for low-income borrowers, predominantly women.  \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n32.  M-CRIL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.

Microfinance institutions (MFIs) are a critical means of expanding financial inclusion in \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) because micro-\ncredit is their key product. MFIs play an indispensable role in helping the poor obtain access to \nfinance and mitigating the adversities stemming from the unreliability of their income. MFIs have \nbecome  essential  in  delivering  credit  and  financial  services  to  the  smallest  and  remotest \nsegments of lower-income populations, i.e., those deemed least creditworthy, who do not have \ndirect access to credit from the commercial banking systems in DMCs.1 \n \n2.  MFIs rely on wholesale sources of debt or subordinated funding\u2014principally through \ncommercial banks, DFIs, foundations, trusts, and private equity or capital asset managers\u2014to \nfund their onlending operations. Most DMCs and their banking sector regulators do not allow \nMFIs to access retail deposits, which arguably is the correct approach since MFIs\u2019 capitalization \nlevels, access to liquidity, and overall risk management and governance standards are still \nevolving, making them financially susceptible and less creditworthy for directly accessing public \nsavings.2 Further, while regulatory oversight of MFIs is steadily improving, it is often as a sharp \nresponse to MFI credit-risk and governance crises,3 usually constraining liquidity and access to \nfunding for even the better-managed and better-governed MFIs. Figure 1 shows the capital-\nstructure profile of a regionally diverse sample of MFIs, which underscores the point about \ndependence on institutional debt, and the diminishing contribution of public or client savings. \nThe immediate future is likely to reflect further reliance on external debt since access to equity \nand contributions of earnings have been constricted, and MFI earnings have generally come \nunder pressure from greater competition and more credit losses. This trend highlights the role \nand  contribution  of  the  kind  of  risk  assessment  work  undertaken  by  Micro-Credit  Ratings \nInternational Limited (MCRIL) for the debt providers. \n \n                                                 \n1  In several countries, where private and state-owned banks are ill-positioned to cover the vast market, they now use \nMFIs as a strategic choice\u2014as agents or an independent channel to deliver credit, savings, insurance, and other \nfinancial products and services to the underserved client category. This model of \u201ccorrespondent banking\u201d is using \nthe more nimble and widely present MFIs to widen coverage and source clients (borrowers and depositors) for the \nlarger commercial banks.  \n2  A recent example of this transition is the case of Bandhan Financial Services Private Limited in India, which was \ngranted an approval to start commercial banking operations and access to public deposits, although it will need to \nmaintain stringent capital, liquidity, and governance standards. Bandhan has a 15-year track record and relatively \nstrong governance and reporting standards; such qualities are not seen often in MFIs. \n3  The MFI crisis in Andhra Pradesh, India, which impacted access to funding for all institutions across India, was \noften cited as an outcome of changes in the external operating environment. Similar MFI crises of individual \ninstitutions, and their sector-wide impact, were seen in the PRC, Indonesia, and the Philippines.

Universally, both across emerging and well-established DMC markets, concerns persist \nregarding  disclosure,  governance,  and  accounting  standards  and  risk  management  in  the \ndevelopment of MFIs.4 While the very few larger and developed institutions have progressed to \nbetter standards, the gap in the requirements of the risk takers (i.e., the commercial lenders) \nand the borrowing MFIs remains vast. This information gap is most significant for portfolio \nquality assessment, which is often not adequately and transparently evident from published \naccounts, and has generally been weakening, which only adds to the lenders\u2019 concern. Figure 2 \nprofiles the key countries or markets that are likely to be vulnerable to loan portfolio quality \nconcerns,5 as reflected in high growth (y-axis) and penetration (x-axis) rates. For a majority of \nthe DMCs, it is forecast that loan portfolios will weaken from current levels while penetration \nrates increase, which directly signifies the importance and value addition of specialized MFI risk-\nassessment services.  \n                                                 \n4 Several independent assessments have consistently highlighted these concerns as the foremost DMC microfinance \nrisk factor\u2014among others, (i) the Microfinance Banana Skins reports of 2012, 2013, and 2015, which are global \nsurveys of microfinance risks as seen by an international sample of practitioners, investors, regulators, and \nobservers; (ii) MicroRate 2013, a survey of microfinance investment vehicles; (iii) ResponsAbility \u2013 Microfinance \nMarket Outlook 2014; (iv) The Impact Investor\u2019s Handbook \u2013 Lessons from the World of Microfinance (2011, 2014); \nand (v) Microfinance in South Asia \u2013 Towards Financial Inclusion for the Poor (World Bank). \n5 A PAR30 (which implies the value of all loans outstanding that have one or more installments of principal past due \nfor more than 30 days) is a standard indicator of portfolio quality, and levels above 5%\u20137% (of total portfolio) are \ngenerally considered risky.  ", " \n \nFigure 2: Countries with Substantial Deterioration in the Quality of Microfinance \nInstitution Portfolios  \n \n \n4.  This anticipation further distorts risk assessment, increases risk aversion and transaction \ncosts for lenders, and negatively impacts the MFIs\u2019 access to a sustained flow of long-term \nfunding to their onlending operations. The ability of a specialized agency such as MCRIL to offer \nthese risk advisory, assessment, and measurement services; reduce the transaction costs; and \nprovide a wider reference base for lenders is the key economic rationale for MCRIL's business \nand a core rationale for this investment.  \n \n5.  Regulations. The regulations governing microfinance activities have generally focused \non reporting requirements and on setting minimum standards, which typically would allow a vast \narray of MFIs to continue their operations. Among the South Asian countries, Bangladesh, India, \nNepal, and Sri Lanka regulate MFIs by law. India, as the largest country in South Asia, has the \nmost  diversified  microfinance  service  providers\u2014banks,  nonbanking  financial  companies \n(NBFCs), societies, trusts, and cooperatives. The Microfinance Institutions (Development and \nRegulation) Bill, 2012 was tabled in Parliament in May 2012 and was examined by the Standing \nCommittee on Finance, but is still to be enacted. However, considering the importance of the \nsector and the lessons from the Andhra Pradesh crisis, the Reserve Bank of India created a \nseparate category of NBFCs, NBFC-MFIs, for extending loans to the microfinance sector. Since \nNBFC-MFIs contribute more than 80% of the outreach and microfinance portfolio, are directly \nsupervised by the Reserve Bank, and operate under its directives, it can be said that the Indian \nmicrofinance sector is well regulated.  \n \n ", "OWNERSHIP, MANAGEMENT, AND GOVERNANCE \n \nA.  The Company, Sponsors, and Management \n \n1.  Company ownership and history. Micro-Credit Ratings International Limited (MCRIL) \nis engaged in the financial and social ratings of microfinance institutions (MFIs). It was one of \nfour agencies globally that first specialized in microfinance ratings. MCRIL was established in \n1998, in response to the need for performance assessments of small microfinance service \nproviders. It provides standard comparisons of the financial, management, and mission-oriented \nperformances of MFIs to facilitate the decision-making process of investors and lenders. The \nfoundation for MCRIL\u2019s activities was laid by its parent company, EDA Rural Systems Private \nLimited (EDA), which was set up in 1983 and has undertaken livelihood assessments, and \nmonitoring and evaluation of microfinance programs for over 25 years across Asia. MCRIL was \namong the first agencies to be accredited by the IDB\u2013CGAP Rating Fund1 and The Rating \nInitiative of ADA, Luxembourg.2 \n \n2.  As a pioneer in developing rating frameworks and related assessment services, MCRIL \nhas  completed  over  1,500  microfinance ratings,  assessments,  portfolio  audits,  evaluations, \nbusiness  planning  review  exercises,  risk-diagnostic  assessments,  and  microfinance-related \nsector reviews and financial advisory assignments across 32 countries, and has undertaken \naround 420 school assessments. Since MCRIL has completed assignments and assessed MFIs \nin various regional markets over the past 8\u201310 years (specifically in DMCs such as Cambodia, \nIndonesia, and Nepal, and more recently in markets such as the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) and Myanmar), it is now well placed to implement its strategic plan to establish a \npermanent presence and local operating base  in PRC. MCRIL\u2019s major  clients include : Asian \nDevelopment Bank; Department for International Development of the United Kingdom; Food \nand Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations; Ford Foundation; International Finance \nCorporation; Mekong Private Sector Development Facility; National Bank for Agriculture and \nRural Development in India; Pakistan Microfinance Network; Rural Microfinance Development \nCentre , Nepal; Swiss  Agency for Development and Cooperation;  United Nations Capital \nDevelopment Fund; World Bank, among others.  \n \n \nKey Services \n \nMCRIL  EDA \nMicrofinance institutional ratings  Value chain assessments \nLoan portfolio audits  Ratings of producer organizations \nClient protection assessments (SMART  Evaluations of microfinance program \nCampaign)  support \nSocial ratings, Truelift assessment  Social performance management  \n                                                 \n1   The Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and the Consultative Group to Assist the Poorest (CGAP) have \nlaunched a joint initiative\u2014the Microfinance Rating and Assessment Fund (the Rating Fund)\u2014aimed at improving \nthe quality, reliability, and availability of information on the risk and performance of MFIs. The Rating Fund \nprovides partial financing of rating and assessment services for MFIs. It finances both financial and social impact \nratings or assessments of MFIs. \n2   The Rating Initiative was launched by the Luxembourg microfinance agency ADA (Appui au D\u00e9veloppement \nAutonome), in collaboration with the Government of Luxembourg, Microfinance Initiative Liechtenstein (MIL), \nSwiss Development Cooperation (SDC), Oxfam Novib, \u00d6sterreichische Entwicklungsbank (OeEB), the Principality \nof Monaco, responsAbility, BlueOrchard, and the Social Performance Task Force (SPTF).

Sponsors and founders. EDA owns about 91% of MCRIL, the balance is owned by \nMCRIL employees. MCRIL and EDA are merging under a process expected to be completed by \nJuly 2016. MCRIL will be the surviving entity carrying on the combined businesses of MCRIL \nand EDA. The founders of MCRIL, Sanjay Sinha and Francis Sinha, are the predominant \nowners of EDA, together holding almost 100% (with a small minority held by a key employee). \nMCRIL has one wholly owned subsidiary incorporated in Myanmar, established to carry on its \noperations there. EDA is an operating\u2013holding entity and has been engaged in nonfinancial \nrating activities for the microfinance industry, such as social performance ratings, assessment of \ninclusiveness, social impact studies, adoption of the Client Protection Principles of the Smart \nCampaign, and training.  \n \n4.  The  ownership  structure  of  MCRIL  is  expected  to  evolve,  resulting  in  a  greater \nproportion of employee shares and a reduction in the founders\u2019 ownership, which will help \nfurther align the stakeholder interests in this very skills- and people-intensive business, and will \nstrengthen the long-term commitment of key staff to the organization. This approach has also \nworked very effectively for most global and domestic Asia-based credit rating agencies (CRAs). \n \n5.  Management. MCRIL is professionally managed, with a strong team of experienced and \nwell-qualified staff in the areas of business development, rating services, financial analysis, \nbusiness and organizational process analysis, operations, and research and publications. A \nsummary profile of MCRIL\u2019s senior management is given below. MCRIL understands the need \nto comprehensively strengthen the management team, streamline its internal processes further, \nand bring in greater specialization and decentralization to its operations as a critical part of their \npost-ADB investment activities. ADB draws comfort from the management\u2019s and the founders\u2019 \nreceptivity  to  these  needs,  and  the  willingness  to  structure  this  formally  in  the  proposed \nbusiness and investment plan. \n \n6.

He has \nmore  than  15  years  of  professional  experience  across  nine  countries  in  South  Asia  and \nSoutheast Asia. He leads the research initiatives at MCRIL and EDA. His key areas of expertise \ninclude  designing  large-scale  research  projects;  conducting  monitoring  and  evaluation  of \nprograms; promoting micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs); and developing \nBDS markets. He also has significant experience in capacity and risk assessment of MFIs. \n \n7.  Gunjan  Grover,  senior  vice  president.

Board profile. Despite its shareholding profile and accumulation of ownership by the \nfounders, MCRIL follows high standards of transparency and governance, and has established ", "a board of directors with strong backgrounds and experiences in finance sector regulation, MFI \noperations, rural and commercial banking, and academia, to oversee its operations. Five of the \nseven  board  members  are  independent;  the  chairman  is  a  globally  renowned  expert  in \nmicrofinance  and  social  development.  These  are  strong  indicators  of  the  governance  and \ntransparency standards that form the backbone of MCRIL\u2019s operations. MCRIL\u2019s expertise and \nauthority give it a competitive edge over other its peers. \n \n9.  The board oversees the company\u2019s operations; helps assess and direct its key business; \nguides  decisions  on  human  resources,  investments,  and  expansion;  and  provides  an \noverarching  and  independent  oversight  of  the analytical  rigor  and  consistency  of  MCRIL\u2019s \nproducts and services. \n \n10.  Both founders are members of the board, with equal voting rights to the independent \nmembers, but do not have a formal veto, control or blocking right on any matter,3 which ensures \ncollective decision-making and alignment of interests between the founders, the management, \nand the board.

After his retirement, he was appointed a full-time member of the National \nCommission  of  Farmers  by  the  Government  of  India.    During  integrity  due  diligence  in \npreparation of the proposed project, Nanda was identified as politically exposed person in \nMCRIL\u2019s structure. However, Nada is a career bureaucrat and has been selected to these \npositions by independent selection panels that do not have political affiliations.

He is an internationally acclaimed authority on inclusive finance; in \nrecognition of his contribution he served as a Member of the UN Advisors Group on Inclusive \nFinancial Sectors during the Advisor Group\u2019s tenure, 2006\u20132008. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n16.  MCRIL is arguably the most reputed and established regional agency specialized in \nadvisory and rating services. It offers a well-diversified range of products and services to its \nclients  while  simultaneously  maintaining  its  focus  on  its  core  competencies\u2014MFI  risk \nassessments, governance and transparency, operations and portfolio quality analyses, social \nperformance  assessments  and  ratings,  sector  and  policy  reviews  centered  on  financial \ninclusion, and MFI-related regulations and policy reforms. After the integration of EDA into \nMCRIL, the business, product, and client portfolio of the combined entity will benefit from both \nrevenue and geographic diversification while still retaining overall focus and specialization.  \n \n17.  Operations. MCRIL follows a well-established protocol in the conduct of its ratings and \nassessments. The rating process starts with a desk analysis of information and subsequent field \nvisits to the head office, operational branches, and the borrowers of the MFI. Unlike mainstream \nrating agencies, intensive field visits and interaction with clients are at the core of the MCRIL \napproach. Its rating team prepares a detailed assessment report, cross-checks the data with the \nspecific MFI (without discussing or disclosing the rating), and subsequently ensures adequate \nquality review by its senior management. As MCRIL has performed reviews, assessments, and \ndiagnostics of MFIs within the same geographic region, it is well placed for a comparative \nanalysis and benchmarking performance. \n \n18.  The final report, along with additional factual details and data provided by the rated \ninstitution, is placed before the rating committee for a decision. Uniquely among all specialized ", "advisory  and  rating  service  companies,  MCRIL\u2019s  rating  committee  consists  entirely  of \nmicrofinance experts who are independent of MCRIL\u2019s management and its founders. It is made \nup of senior bankers, commercial lenders, regulators, and chartered accountants, each with \nindependent sources of income and none significantly dependent on earnings from MCRIL. The \nfounders participate in but are not voting members of the committee. Each report is referred to a \nsubcommittee consisting of two members of the rating committee; recusal is applied whenever a \nmember of the rating committee has any existing business relationship with the MFI to be rated. \nIt  is  only  after  discussion  with  the  rating  team  (and,  if  necessary,  after  seeking  further \nclarification  from  the  MFI)  that  the  committee  decides  the  final  rating  for  the  MFI.  These \npractices are born out of the significance attached by MCRIL to analytical rigor, objectivity, \nindependence of judgment, transparency, and avoidance of conflicts of interest. MCRIL also has \nadequate procedures to handle conflict-of-interest situations with those MFIs that are its clients \nfor  risk  advisory,  risk-assessment,  and  process-review  engagements.  These  make  up  a \nsignificant proportion of its client base, but MCRIL observes a cooling period of 3 years before \nsuch entities are considered as clients for ratings. This arrangement also works well from a \nbusiness perspective because most MFI prefer an initial diagnostic input, followed by a plan to \nimprove  their  governance  and  disclosure  and  operating  procedures,  which  enhances  their \nprospects for a better risk assessment or rating.  \n \n19.  Future strategy. MCRIL intends to follow a medium-term three-pronged strategy to \ncapitalize on emerging opportunities and realize the proposed investment objectives. This will \ninvolve (i) consolidating the activities of EDA and MCRIL into a single entity, as a precondition of \n(ii) strengthening the organization\u2019s staff, resources, and internal processes to expand outreach \nand market share in India once MCRIL is accredited as a CRA by RBI; and (iii) utilizing its \ncurrent experience, skills, competence, and client relations to widen its geographic coverage by \nestablishing more permanent operations in the identified key markets. MCRIL has already \nshown its commitment to the regional expansion strategy by setting up a subsidiary in Myanmar \nand looking at a possible joint venture in the PRC.  \n \n20.  The overall strategic plan\u2014which was discussed extensively with ADB and aligned with \ncommon  objectives\u2014benefits  from  a  phased  investment  approach  and  an  ability  to  track \nprogress, outcomes, and capital requirements against a plan and to time ADB\u2019s proposed equity \ninfusion accordingly. The approach also helps diversify risks since MCRIL is well placed to \ncapitalize on the market opportunities after being accredited by the RBI, when the incremental \ncash flows and earnings from its India operations can help partly bear the initial investments and \nthe start-up expenses of the overseas operations, as well as deliver interim financial returns to \nshareholders. MCRIL will also deploy its existing cash flows and cash reserves to part-fund the \nproposed strategy. \n \n21.  The existing MFI borrowing base in India (globally the largest microfinance market) \noffers MCRIL an opportunity to scale up its business, which will yield more predictable cash \nflows for supporting the early market expansion into key countries such as Cambodia, the PRC, \nIndonesia, and Nepal, where microfinance penetration is expected to increase with greater \naccess to long-term funding. India leads the Asian market in terms of active MFI borrowers with \n49 million; Bangladesh, 19 million; Viet Nam, 8 million; Philippines, 5 million; Pakistan, 3.7 \nmillion; China, 2.7 million; Cambodia, 2.3 million; Indonesia, 1.3 million; Nepal, 1.2 million; and \nSri Lanka, 0.6 million.4  \n                                                 \n4 Source: Microfinance Information Exchange Market (MIX Market), gathered on 4 April 2016  \n ", "DETAILS OF IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS \n \n1.  Given the strong track record of Micro-Credit Ratings International Limited (MCRIL) with \nregard to its operations, rigor in internal procedures, good governance and disclosure practices, \nand the oversight by an independent board, the project team is of the opinion that the operating \narrangements for this investment, in its post-approval (holding period) stage, will not require \nsubstantial amendments and changes to MCRIL\u2019s current practices. The business plan for the \nproposed  investment  captures  the  next  steps  in  (i)  seeking  regulatory  approvals  for \naccreditation in India, (ii) pursuing regional expansion in the pre-specified markets by opening \nregional or in-country offices, and (c) strengthening the organizational resources and skills base \nby hiring new staff, providing training, and upgrading the information technology.   \n \n2.  The milestones to be tracked in the post-approval stage involve \n(i)  compliance with all terms and the specific conditions precedent; \n(ii) the progress of approvals from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) \nand the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for MCRIL\u2019s accreditation as a credit rating \nagency (CRA). \n(iii) the company\u2019s regional expansion activities, capital spending, and staff hiring plan. \n \n3.  Because some of the milestones require a longer execution period and are sensitive to \nchanging business conditions and market opportunities, the availability period for ADB\u2019s equity \ninvestment was kept at 3 years from the date of first disbursement. Some milestones relating to \nthe  hiring  of  new  staff,  staff  training,  realignment  of  the  organizational  structure,  and \nestablishment of overseas offices cannot be pegged to rigid timelines. An extended availability \nperiod  will  give  MCRIL  an  opportunity  to  pace  its  activities  and  progress  around  specific \nopportunities, and will also allow the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to review progress and to \ntime the disbursement of the second tranche accordingly.   \n \nMerger. The merger of MCRIL with its parent company, EDA Rural Systems Private Limited \n(EDA), is a condition precedent to ADB\u2019s investment. Given the merits of this restructuring, the \nsponsors had already planned the merger, and the inclusion of ADB as an institutional investor \naccelerated its execution. \n \n4.  The merger is at an advance stage and awaiting the issuance of the final approval \ndocuments by the courts in India. Since MCRIL and EDA have functioned collectively as one \norganization, often servicing a common set of clients and frequently rotating or interchanging \ntheir staff, the operational issues in managing this merger are minimal. The expected benefits \nrelate to greater client focus and synergies in the new markets; streamlining of some costs of \nsupport functions (e.g., audit, finance, information technology); reduction in statutory obligations \n(audits, separate board meetings); and overall efficiency gains for the merged entity (MCRIL).   \n \n5.  Accreditation. ADB will invest its first tranche of investment in the merged entity to \nallow MCRIL to be considered eligible for CRA accreditation by RBI and SEBI. ADB will qualify \nas an eligible promoter-investor for these purposes, and additionally MCRIL will meet minimum \nnet worth requirements (applicable SEBI regulations require that a CRA have a minimum net \nworth  of  Rs50  million,  and  have  a  promoter-shareholder  holding  at  least  10%  of  it).  It  is \nexpected that it will take at least 8\u201310 months between ADB\u2019s first-tranche investment and the ", "completion  of  the  SEBI  and  RBI  approval  process,  i.e.,  the  accreditation  of  MCRIL.1  The \ninvestment of the second tranche is expected to be made after the accreditation process, within \nthe limits of 25% of the merged company\u2019s total equity, or a $1.5 million investment limit. The \ninvestment outlays in the interim would be partly deployed toward funding the India-focused \noperations. \n \n6.  Overseas expansion and staff hiring. MCRIL will be utilizing a substantial part of \nADB\u2019s proceeds for its overseas expansion, largely to fund initial set-up expenses, payments for \noffice premises and physical infrastructure, and for hiring on-site staff. These expenses will be \noutlined in MCRIL\u2019s annual budget plans and part-funded by ADB\u2019s equity infusion. \n \n7.  Operating arrangements relating to staffing will include hiring for the new positions; \nwidening the analytical staff pool and increasing specialization in new markets and products; \nand centralizing certain administrative and support functions around new staff roles (such as \ncompany secretary and chief financial officer). It is anticipated that ADB\u2019s equity investment will \nfurther elevate MCRIL\u2019s stature as an employer, and will help attract a wider and better talent \npool.2 This will also be reinforced by the employee share option plan arrangements, which ADB \nhas structured into the terms of investment. \n \n \n                                                 \n1 The process laid out by SEBI is transparent and the guidelines and requirements are well defined. MCRIL, which \nhas been in the business of microfinance institution (MFI) ratings for several years, has already adapted and \npracticed the internal processes and control arrangements that are recommended for CRAs.  \n2 MCRIL still is seen in high regard amongst fresh graduates from specialized premiere schools like the Institute of \nRural Management at Anand, where MCRIL is a preferred employer; largely drawn in by the profile and reputation \nof the Sponsors.

Background. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) proposes to invest the lesser of the \nIndian rupee equivalent of $1.5 million or 25% of the net worth in the merged entity of Micro-\nCredit Ratings International Limited (MCRIL) and EDA Rural Systems Private Limited (EDA); \nMCRIL will be the post-merger entity. The proposed pre-money valuation of the investment is \nbased on the reported book value of the merged entity, to be calculated with the latest available \naudited results, prior to the investment. The following factors are considered in ADB\u2019s proposed \nvaluation:  \n(i)  The book-value approach is considered more appropriate for this investment, given \n(a) MCRIL\u2019s simple business model and cash-flow pattern; (b) its consistently \nconservative accounting policies; (c) the absence of any third-party or external \nliabilities; (d) its asset base consisting almost entirely of the company\u2019s own office \npremises (fixed assets), and cash and good-quality receivables as current assets; \nand  (e)  assets  funded  entirely  through  the  sponsors  contribution  (initial \ncapitalization) and accrued profits or retained earnings of the company over the \npast 20 years. In summation, given the absence of any financing complexity and \nthe company\u2019s conservative accounting, the reported book value is a very good \nindicator of the fair value of MCRIL. \n(ii)  ADB\u2019s valuation proposal factors in (a) the strong reputation of the Sponsors and \nthe highly regarded stature of MCRIL globally\u2014as a specialized advisory, rating, \ntraining,  and  research-focused  entity\u2014built  over  20  years  of  operations; \n(b) MCRIL\u2019s track record in India, and its focus and alignment with ADB\u2019s DMC \nmarkets; (c) minimal start-up risk for ADB, since MCRIL has staff resources and \nproven management competence to expand its client and product coverage to \nthese  markets;  (d)  a  well-established  trend  of  operating  profitability  (since \ninception) and reinvestment of all its earnings in its core business; (e) willingness \nto work with ADB, demonstrated by the sponsors agreement to some onerous \nconditions  specified  by  ADB;  and  (f)  the  expected  rate  of  return  from  the \ninvestment,  even  after  assuming  moderate  growth  and  a  tempered  impact  of \nADB\u2019s investment, and the reasonably visible prospects of both annual dividends \nand capital gains from an exit. \n(iii)  The investment plan structured by ADB is substantially de-risked, since the equity \ninfusion  will  be  in  at  least  two  tranches,  with  high  visibility  of  the  improving \nbusiness and earnings prospects of the investee. The valuation factors in the exit \narrangements structured by ADB, which allow for a clear path to divestment within \na reasonable holding period, if other options like a third-party trade sale do not \nmaterialize.  \n(iv)  The proposed valuation is in the lower range of the fair value estimated in the \nindependent valuation exercise.  \n(v)  This exercise should also be viewed in the context of materiality, e.g., in view of the \ninvestment size ($1.5 million equivalent) as well as the business-plan and funding \nrequirements  of  the  company.  Any  excessive  reengineering  of  assumptions, \nvaluation approaches, and multiples will not translate into any meaningful reduction \nin ADB\u2019s exposure. On the other hand, it may leave MCRIL in the suboptimal \nsituation of a partially funded business plan.  \n \n2.  With ADB having a 25% stake, estimated to be acquired by fiscal year (FY) 2018, the \nsponsors\u2019 holdings will be reduced to 60%. The employees\u2019 stock options, a critical element of \nADB\u2019s investment terms, will increase to nearly 15% within 2 years of ADB\u2019s entry as an \ninvestor.

POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nTargeting classification: general intervention \n \nA. Links to the National Poverty Reduction and Inclusive Growth Strategy, and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nSupporting finance sector development is a key focus of development assistance for the Asian Development \nBank (ADB), in line with the tenets detailed in ADB\u2019s Private Sector Development Strategy and in its enhanced \npoverty reduction strategy.a ADB\u2019s Private Sector Development Strategy refers specifically to ADB\u2019s role in \nstrengthening the finance sectors in its developing member countries (DMCs). The investment also aligns with \nthe country partnership strategies for India, where Micro-Credit Ratings International Limited (MCRIL) will \npotentially expand its operations, and for other regional DMCs (Cambodia, People's Republic of China, \nIndonesia, Myanmar, and Nepal) that are targeted in MCRIL\u2019s phased expansion approach. Improving access \nto finance, especially for low-income borrowers in rural and semiurban areas, facilitated through microfinance \ninstitutions (MFIs), is an integral part of the national poverty reduction and growth strategies in the regional \nDMCs where MCRIL plans to expand its operations.  \n \n \nB. Results from the Poverty and Social Analysis during Project Preparation or Due Diligence  \n \n1.  Key poverty and social issues. The microfinance sector targets borrowers at the bottom of the pyramid \nwho often rely on informal channels (friends, family, and informal moneylenders) for credit. Access to \nfinance, and assistance in mitigating the adversities from the unreliability of their incomes, is a key issue for \nlower-income households. As private and state-owned banks are unable or ill-positioned to deliver credit \nand financial services to the smallest and remotest segments of low-income populations (those deemed \nleast creditworthy), direct access to credit is a major challenge. MFIs generally lack established procedures \nfor consumer protection, transparency, and fairness, which has resulted in some of them exploiting the \nvulnerability of borrowers. The financing constraints are more severe in less-developed countries, where \nfinancial  markets  are  not  well  developed,  regulatory  and  legal  frameworks  are  weak,  informational \nasymmetries are persistent, and risk management systems are not as robust. A developed finance sector \nhelps mobilize and allocate resources, and manage risks, contributing to private sector development. \n2.  Beneficiaries. ADB\u2019s investment in MCRIL will strengthen the institutional capacities of the microfinance \nsector and will improve access to microfinance in ADB DMCs. It will allow MCRIL to widen its market \ncoverage for risk advisory, assessment, and rating services to MFIs, create opportunities for MFIs to \nservice a much wider client base, and provide commercial and institutional lenders with a more transparent \nand consistent basis for MFI evaluation. \n \n3.  Impact channels. A wider application of services by MCRIL and associated improvements made by the \nMFIs will lead to sustained access to funding from financiers, resulting in an expansion of the coverage \nareas and client base of these entities.  \n \n4.  Other social and poverty issues. \u2013 None. \n \n5.  Design features. The investment will impact MFI activities nationally and regionally through (i) better \naccess to MFI advisory, assessment, and rating services in ADB DMCs, which will help MFIs access long-\nterm funds from institutional and commercial lenders; (ii) greater ability for responsible MFIs to expand their \ncoverage and loan portfolio; and (iii) greater access to finance for low-income borrowers.  \n \nC.

Summarize the participatory approaches and the proposed project activities that strengthen inclusiveness and \nempowerment of the poor and vulnerable in project implementation. \u2013 While MCRIL\u2019s operations do not directly target \nthe poor and vulnerable, MCRIL will assess the MFIs for their social practices with their borrowers, including fairness, \ninclusiveness, and client protection. Any gaps with the standard social practices will have to be bridged by the MFIs, \nand will be monitored.  \n2.

Key issues.  \nOpportunities for business expansion, employment growth, and innovation of micro, small, and medium-sized \nenterprises (MSMEs) are severely limited because of substantial unmet financing needs in most DMCs, including \nthose where MCRIL proposes to expand: Azerbaijan, Cambodia, People\u2019s Republic of China, Indonesia, Myanmar, \nand Nepal. Across these developing countries, women entrepreneurs have less access to finance than male \nentrepreneurs.b This not only impedes women\u2019s ability to grow their businesses, it can also restrict the types of \nbusinesses they can start and thus their future potential. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) estimates that \nas many as 70% of women-owned small enterprises in the formal sector in developing countries are not served or \nunderserved by financial institutions\u2014a financing gap of $260 to $320 billion.c  \n \nB. Key actions.  \n        Gender action plan        Other actions or measures        No action or measure \n   \nMCRIL commits to implement the following activities to promote gender-inclusive access to finance to low-income \nborrowers, as part of its expansion into new markets: (i) provide broader access to institutional credit for 60 MFIs that \naim to improve gender inclusion, based on ratings by MCRIL; (ii) support 75 MFIs in expanding their coverage and \nloan portfolio to improve access for women-owned MSMEs in rural and semiurban areas; (iii) provide better access to \nfinance from MFIs, and benefit 1.5 million lower- or marginal-income borrowers, which includes 200,000 first-time \nborrowers, of whom at least 90% will be women; (iv) support institutional strengthening and capacity building of \n50 MFIs on nonfinancial aspects, targeting fairness and protection of interests of end-borrowers (90% of whom are \nwomen), apart from training of 650 women staff in dealing with end-borrowers, mostly women MSMEs; and (v) carry \nout research and evaluation studies that contribute to sector awareness of gender issues and barriers to women\u2019s \naccess to finance.

The equity investment of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Micro-Credit Ratings \nInternational Limited (MCRIL) will allow the company to widen its market coverage for risk \nadvisory,  assessment,  and  rating  services  to  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs),  create \nopportunities  for  MFIs  to  service  a  much  wider  client  base,  and  provide  commercial  and \ninstitutional lenders with a more transparent and consistent basis for evaluating MFIs. This in \nturn will improve overall access to finance in ADB developing member countries. The activities \nassociated with MCRIL\u2019s operations are expected to have negligible environmental impacts, and \nare unlikely to trigger impacts related to involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The \ninvestment  is  categorized  as  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous \npeoples under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \n   \nB.  Other Social Dimensions \n \n2.  MCRIL will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy  (2001),  take  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor \nstandards.1 MCRIL  will report regularly to ADB on its compliance with such laws and the \nmeasures taken. The investment in MCRIL is expected to result in greater access to finance for \nlow-income borrowers, 90% of which are typically women, in mostly rural and semiurban areas, \nand has been categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. The gender action plan proposes \nthe implementation of the following actions to give women in rural and semiurban areas greater \naccess to credit: (i) expand access to MCRIL\u2019s advisory, assessment, and rating services in \nnew markets; (ii) Increase and improve access to institutional credit for MFIs, so they can \nexpand their coverage and loan portfolio; (iii) provide broader access to finance for low-income \nborrowers; (iv) strengthen the institutional capacities of MFIs, consistent with industry best \n \npractices; and (v) document and disseminate good practices from MCRIL operations.\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2003.Social Protection Strategy.
