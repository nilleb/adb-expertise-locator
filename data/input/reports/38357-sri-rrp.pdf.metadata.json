The  proposed \nProject will be the second in the series of interventions, and will \n(i)  support  the  second  stage  of  the  reform  program  and  (ii) \nfinance the upgrading of national highways (NHs). \n \nThe  Project  will  continue  to  support  the  Government  in  policy \nand  institutional  aspects,  particularly  in  improving  the  transport \nsector regulatory framework, supporting the reorganization of the \nstructure  of  the  Road  Development  Authority  (RDA),  improving \nRDA\u2019s human resources development policy and strategies, and \nintegrating project management.  \n \nThe  Project  will  upgrade  about  270  kilometers  (km)  of  NHs, \nconsisting  of  Puttalam-Anuradhapura,  hilly  roads,  and  south \nhighway  links.  Bridges,  drainage,  and  culverts  will  be  improved \nand replaced, and weigh stations will be provided as necessary. \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement  of  the  Colombo  links  (about \n80  km)  will  also  be  supported.  A  pilot  performance-based \nmaintenance program in 4\u20136 executive engineer divisions will be \ndeveloped and contracted out to local private contractors. \n \nA  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  also  be  provided  to  build  the \ncapacity  of  the  newly  established  Environmental  and  Social \nDivision within RDA. \n \nAlthough  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  road  density  is  higher  than  that  of  many \ndeveloping countries, the road network standards and conditions \nare  inadequate  to  meet  rapidly  growing  freight  and  passenger \ntraffic. Most of the NH network is still single- and two-lane, more \nthan  50%  of  the  network  has  poor  and  bad  surface  condition, \nand many portions are seriously congested. \n\n\fthe \n\nlimits \n\nroads\u2019  contribution \n\nto  national \nThis  situation \ndevelopment  and  economic  growth.  To  cope  with \nthe \nconstraints,  the  existing  road  infrastructure  must  be  improved \nand upgraded. \n \nThe  overall  contribution  of  road  infrastructure  also  requires \ninstitutional  arrangements  and  capacity  that  support  strategic \nmanagement  of  the  sector,  and  planning  and  management  of \ninvestments.  The  proposed  Project  has  been  designed  to \naddress both institutional and investment aspects in the sector. \n \nThe  Project  impact  is  expansion  of  economic  opportunities \nleading  to  higher  income.  The  outcome  is  improvement  of \nnational  transport  efficiency  resulting  from  (i)  improved  road \nsector  institution  and  policy;  and  (ii)  upgraded  and  maintained \nNH  network  that  lowers  transport  cost,  reduces  journey  time, \nand improves accessibility.  \n \nThe estimated total cost is $208.0 million equivalent, inclusive of \ntaxes,  duties,  commitment  charges,  and \ninterest  during \nimplementation. Foreign exchange costs are estimated at $72.3 \nmillion  (34.8%).  Local  currency  costs  are  estimated  at  $135.7 \nmillion equivalent (65.2%). \n \n\n($ million) \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nAsian Development \n\n \n\nSource \n\nBank \n\nGovernment \nTotal \n\nForeign \nExchange \n \n72.3 \n0.0 \n72.3 \n\n77.7 \n58.0 \n135.7 \n\n \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n150.0 \n58.0 \n208.0 \n\n% \n\n \n\n72.1 \n27.9 \n100.0 \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  $150.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources \nwill  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; an interest rate determined \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility;  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum; and such other terms \nand conditions as set forth in the loan and project agreements. \n \nUntil 31 December 2010 \n \n31 December 2009 \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nRoad Development Authority \n\nii \n\n \n\n \n\n\fImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\nfor \n\nto  ADB \n\nThe  existing  project  management  unit,  which  is  responsible  for \npreconstruction  activities  and \nimplementing  RDA\u2019s \nreengineering  under  the  ongoing  Road  Sector  Development \nProject, will be responsible for overall coordination of the Project. \nFor  civil  works  implementation,  four  existing  RDAs\u2019  provincial \ndirectors  of  Central,  Northwestern,  Southern,  and  Uva \nProvinces,  assisted  by  the  relevant  chief  engineer\u2019s  offices  will \nbe responsible for day-to-day implementation. \n \nProcurement  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement  and  the  Government\u2019s  tender \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. International competitive bidding \n(ICB) procedures will be followed for procurement of civil works \nwith  contract  values  of  above  $6  million,  and  local  competitive \nbidding procedures for contract values of $6.0 million and below. \nSupply  contracts  over  $1,000,000  will  be  procured  under  ICB; \n$100,000\u20131,000,000,  international  shopping;  and  less  than \n$100,000, direct purchase arrangement. \n \nAll  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory \nfor  engaging  domestic  consultants. \nConsulting services will be required for (i) policy and institutional \nsupport,  (ii)  construction  supervision,  and  (iii)  preparing  and \nthe  performance-based  maintenance  contracts. \nsupervising \nOverall, about 237 person-months international and 945 person-\nmonths domestic consultant inputs will be required. \n \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  the  improvement  of  the  overall \nperformance of the road sector by improving transport efficiency \nand  widening  access \nto  economic  opportunities.  The \nbeneficiaries  will  be  people,  companies,  and  government  and \nnongovernment  agencies  in  Sri  Lanka  that  use  road  transport \nservices  directly  and  indirectly.  Communities  served  by  the \nproject  roads  will  benefit  from  improved,  lower  cost,  and  faster \ntransport  services,  and  thereby  obtain  improved  access  to \neconomic opportunities and social services. Transport operators \ncarrying  both  passengers  and  freight  will  benefit  from  improved \nroads  in  terms  of  lower  vehicle  operating  cost,  time  savings, \nimproved  road  safety,  and \nincrease  productivity. \nGovernment and nongovernment agencies served by the project \nroads  will  improve  their  service  delivery  due  to  improved \ntransport efficiency. \n \nThe main quantifiable benefits of the highways improvement will \nbe  savings  in  transport  operating  costs.  The  overall  economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  is  18.2%.  The  poverty  impact  ratio  of  the \nproject roads is 0.39, above the poor\u2019s share of national income. \n \n\nthereby, \n\niii \n\n \n\n\fRisks and Assumptions \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\ninstitutional  strengthening  program, \n\nThe benefits and positive impacts of the Project will materialize, \nassuming  that  complementary  external  assistance  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s  commitment  in  developing  the  national  road \nnetwork and economic infrastructure will continue.  \n \nThe  major  risks  for  the  Project  are  (i)  partial  implementation  of \nthe  institutional  strengthening  program,  leading  to  less-than-\nintended  improvements  in  sector  performance;  (ii)  inadequate \npostproject road maintenance; and (iii) delays in land acquisition \nand  resettlement  due  to  inadequate  counterpart  funding.  The \nrisks  have  been  mitigated  in  (i)  the  revised  realistic  and \nachievable \nthe \nestablishment  of  a  dedicated  road  maintenance  trust  fund,  and \n(iii)  government  commitment  to  include  the  Project  in  its  core \nprojects starting in FY2006 to ensure that budget allocations for \nit  will  be  provided  and  sustained.  The  Project  will  also  finance \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  expenditures  of  the  Colombo \nlinks. \n \nIn conjunction with the Project, a TA is proposed for building the \ncapacity  of  the  Environmental  and  Social  Division  of  RDA.  The \nTA  is  estimated  to  cost  $500,000,  of  which  ADB  will  finance \n$400,000 on a grant basis from the technical assistance special \nfund. The TA consultants will be recruited on an individual basis \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging \ndomestic consultants. \n\n(ii) \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  Sri  Lanka  for  the  National  Highways  Sector  Project.  The  report  also  describes  a  proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for Capacity Building of the Environmental and Social Division of the \nRoad  Development  Authority  (RDA),  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n2. \nRoad  density  in  Sri  Lanka  is  higher  than  that  in  many  developing  countries;  however, \nroad network standards and conditions are inadequate to meet the rapidly growing freight and \npassenger  traffic.  This  situation  limits  the  contribution  of  roads  to  national  development, \neconomic  growth,  and  poverty  reduction.  To  cope  with  the  constraints,  the  existing  road \ninfrastructure  must  be  improved  and  upgraded.  The  overall  contribution  of  road  infrastructure \nalso requires institutional arrangements and capacity that support strategic management of the \nsector,  and  planning  and  management  of  investments.  Since  2002,  the  Asian  Development \nBank  (ADB)  has  supported  the  establishment  and  implementation  of  a  policy  and  institutional \nframework to improve overall road sector performance. The proposed Project will be the second \nin  the  series  of  interventions,  and  will  support  the  second  stage  of  the  reform  program  and \nfinance the upgrading of national highways (NHs). The proposed Project, which was envisaged \nin  the  country  strategy  and  program  2004\u20132008,1 is  designed  to  address  both  investment  and \ninstitutional aspects in the sector.2 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n3. \nSri  Lanka  has  a  road  network  of  about  108,000  kilometers  (km),  comprising  about \n11,700  km  of  NHs,  15,500  km  of  provincial  roads,  64,700  km  of  local  authority  roads,  and \n16,300 km of roads owned or controlled by irrigation, wildlife and land development authorities. \nThe road sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n4. \nThe  Ministry  of  Highways  (MOH)  has  overall  responsibility  for  policies  and  programs \nconcerning  the  NH  network.  RDA,3 a  statutory  institution  assigned  to  MOH,  is  responsible  for \nplanning  and  managing  the  development  and  maintenance  of  NHs.  Although  RDA  has  the \nstructure  of  a  commercial  organization\u2014with  a  chairman,  a  general  manager,  and  a  board  of \ndirectors\u2014in  practice  it  operates  as  a  government  department  under  MOH,  with  relatively \nlimited  autonomy.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT)  has  responsibility  for  overall  policy  and \nregulation  in  land  transport,  covering  road  and  rail  transport.    Among  its  functions,  MOT  is \nresponsible  for  vehicle,  driver,  and  operator  licensing;  on-road  regulatory  enforcement  in \ncooperation with the police; and passenger transport services and price regulation.  \n \n5. \nSri  Lanka\u2019s  real  gross  domestic  product  over  10  years  period  grew  at  the  average  of \n4.5% per annum, and the rate of traffic growth was over 6% annually in the last 5 years. Road \ntransport is a dominant mode, accounting for 98% of freight movement and 93% of passenger \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2003.

The  total  number  of  registered  vehicles  has  risen  sharply  over  the  last  3  years. \nMotorcycle registrations in particular have increased by a factor of four. Motor tricycles, which \nare  now  used  throughout  the  country  as  taxi  services,  have  grown  strongly,  and  also  car  to  a \nlesser extent. Traffic levels now exceed the design capacity of many roads. \n \nRoad density is 1.5 km/km2, however, the standards and condition of the road network \n6. \nare inadequate to meet the rapidly growing freight and passenger traffic. About 64.3% of the NH \nnetwork is still single- and two-lane standard, 34.0% two-lane, and only 1.7% four-lane or more. \nMany roads, particularly those originating from Colombo, are seriously congested. \n \n7. \nThe  road  network  has  a  wide  range  of  width  and  geometric  standards.  Potholes  and \nbreakup  of  bitumen  surfacing  are  the  most  common  signs  of  deterioration,  and  in  most  cases \nreconstruction  or  overlay  is  needed.  It  is  evident  that  relatively  little  maintenance  has  been \ncarried out in the previous 10 years. Only 18.4% of the network is in good condition and will not \nneed  rehabilitation  for  some  years;  29.8%  is  in  fair  condition  and  likely  to  need  resurfacing \nwithin the next 5 years; 35.4% is in poor condition and needs major rehabilitation to return the \nroads  to  a  maintainable  condition  and  provide  all-weather  serviceability;  and  16.4%  is  in  bad \ncondition,  requiring  reconstruction. 4 Poor  road  conditions  raise  road-user  costs,  impair  road \nsafety, and diminish the quality and frequency of transport services.  \n\nthe  proposed  Project  may \n\nOverloading  contributes  substantially  to  the  deterioration  of  the  road  network  in  Sri \n8. \nLanka.  Surveys  of  axle  loads  undertaken  by  RDA  indicate  a  high  degree  of  overloading  by  a \nproportion of heavy commercial vehicles.  Most freight transport is undertaken by two axle dual \nrear-tired  vehicles,  and  these  show  the  greatest  overloading.  The  loads  they  carry  should  be \nspread  over  multiple  axles  to  avoid  excessive  damage  to  the  road  pavement.  As  a  protective \nmeasure,  the  Motor  Traffic  Act  stipulates  maximum  gross  and  tare  weights,  axle  loads,  and \ndimensions. These limits are meant to ensure that roads last for the full design life with proper \nroutine and periodic maintenance. The Act, however, does not provide for a rational axle load \nfor effective enforcement and has no provisions to control and punish for excessive axle loads. \nThe  road  user  charges  do  not  demonstrate  the  economic  cost  of  each  vehicle  in  terms  of  the \nroad  damage  due  to  axle  overloading.  A  study  of  axle  load  is  under  way  under  Sweden \nassistance,  and \nthe \nrecommendations of the study. \n \n9. \nAlthough road accidents have increased at a rate lower than the growth in vehicle fleet \nor  the  estimated  operated  vehicle-km,  the  number  of  death  has  increased  during  the  last  two \ndecades from 1,180 in 1982 to 2,185 in 2002. In 2002, there were more than 10 fatal accidents \nper 100,000 population. The highest fatality rate per 10,000 vehicles was with private operated \nbuses.  Efforts  to  improve  road  safety  have  been  under  way  under  the  assistance  of  ADB, \nSweden,  and  Nordic  Development  Fund,  through  implementation  of  a  strategic  action  plan,5 \naimed at reducing accidents by 25% for Sri Lanka. In-depth evaluation will be conducted upon \ncompletion, and further assistance if required will be considered under the Project. \n  \n10. \nRoad freight services are provided entirely by the private sector and are not subject to \nprice  control  or  any  form  of  route  or  area  licensing.  The  situation  has  allowed  a  competitive \nindustry  to  develop.    At  its  present  state  of  development,  the  road  freight  industry  is  still \ndominated by small to medium-size operators, often family businesses, employing a few people \n                                                 \n4   Following the tsunami in December 2004. assistance from the international community, including ADB, has flowed, \n\ninclude  assistance \n\nimplementing \n\nin \n\nand about 1,150 km of national highways and 800 km of provincial roads will be rehabilitated. \n\n5   ADB.  1999.

Aggregation into larger freight companies and involvement \nof  overseas  interests  in  the  freight  industry  has  not  been  significant  so  far.  However,  if  the \ndevelopment  of  the  industry  follows  trends  in  other  countries,  some  aggregation  into  larger \ncompanies  can  be  expected  in  the  future.  The  change  will  have  some  beneficial  effects  that \nwould allow specialization, lower costs, and development of more advanced freight logistics. \n\n11. \nBus  transport  services  are  the  leading  form  of  public  transport  in  Sri  Lanka,  providing \napproximately 80% of passenger transport; railways and private vehicle owners contribute 7% \nand 13%, respectively. The publicly owned cluster bus companies (CBCs) have a 22% share of \nthe total bus transport market, implying a high reliance on the private sector for provision of the \nservices. CBCs pose a substantial financial burden due to the high operating cost per km and \npoor targeting of subsidies for unprofitable school and rural bus routes. Currently, CBCs employ \n12 persons per operated bus, and own 4,200 buses. The total cost of operating CBCs including \ncorporate cost, depreciation, and all fees payable to the Government amounted to SLRs21.91 \nbillion in 2004. The main reason for the significant cost can be a combination of excess staff and \nsalary structures. In addition, the sector has suffered from lack of a sound policy and regulatory \nframework,  including  infrequent  fare  increases,  which  have  not  allowed  service  delivery  at \nfinancially viable levels and have led to lack of investment in the sector. The fare structure has \nalso  caused  overcrowding  on  more  profitable  routes  and  underprovision  on  others,  and  low \nservice quality and increasing safety issues. \n\n12. \nThe  Government  has  outlined  a  detailed  reform  program  to  address  these  substantial \nissues.  Recognizing  that  a  mere  change  from  public  to  private  ownership  will  not  solve  the \nunderlying issues impeding improved sector performance, the Cabinet approved in April 2005 a \nstrategic  action  plan  whose  main  thrust  is  to  depoliticize  transport  regulation  and  introduce \nthe  management  of  CBCs,  ensuring  objective  management \ncommercial  principles \nappointment  procedures,  and \nfranchising  schemes \nformulated  on  the  basis  of  a  principle  of  competition  for  the  market  and  improved  methods  of \nprocuring and managing the services of private buses, and aims to reduce the total number of \npublic sector employees through a voluntary retirement scheme.6 \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nintroducing  efficiency. \n\nintroduces \n\nin \n\nIt \n\n1. \n\nRoad Sector Strategy \n\ninstitutional  arrangements  and  capacity  are  necessary \n\n13. \nImprovement  of  the  overall  performance  of  the  road  sector  is  key  to  improving  the \nsustainability  of  investments  in  the  sector.  It  will  contribute  to  growth  of  a  wide  range  of  other \neconomic activities that make use of road transport service. The Government and ADB realized \nthat  the  investment  demand  cannot  be  met  through  a  project-by-project  basis.  Furthermore, \neffective \nto  support  strategic \nmanagement of the sector, and to execute road development programs efficiently. Therefore, in \n2002,  ADB  and  the  Government  agreed  to  adopt  a  holistic-programmatic  approach  that  will \nenable  the  Government  to  meet  critical  needs.  Under  this  approach,  a  comprehensive  road \ndevelopment  program  would  be  implemented  in  parallel  with  comprehensive  sector  reform.  A \nroad sector policy matrix and a medium-term framework for road sector lending were developed \nunder the previous Road Sector Development Project (RSDP, footnote 2) as guidance on how \nreform  in  the  sector  will  proceed.  The  reform  program  was  based  on  three  pillars:  (i) \nstrengthening RDA and provincial road agencies, (ii) developing a domestic private sector in the \n\n                                                 \n6   In  line  with  the  recommendations  provided  under  TA  4075  (ADB.  2002.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Democratic \n\nSocialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Passenger Transport Services Improvement. Manila) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\froad  industry,  and  (iii)  establishing  a  mechanism  for  sustainable  road  maintenance  financing. \nThe progress of each reform pillar is summarized as follows. \n \n\na. \n\nRDA Institutional Strengthening \n\n14. \nRDA strengthening activities are under way through implementation of the reengineering \naction  plans  aiming  to  strengthen  RDA\u2019s  capacity  in  (i)  planning  and  programming,  (ii) \npreconstruction  process,  (iii)  construction  management,  (iv)  maintenance  management,  (v)  \ntechnical  audit,  and  (vi)  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR).  The  program  is  progressing \nafter  initial  delays  due  to  a  lengthy  consultant  selection  process.  A  comprehensive  data \ncollection system is now in place. Road and bridge databases and road maintenance budgeting \nand expenditure control are being improved. A traffic forecasting model and an audit system are \nbeing developed. Construction management manuals were drafted and training is provided.  \n \n15. \nThe  progress,  achievement,  and  lessons  of  the  RDA  institutional  reform  program  were \nassessed. The delay of the program has somehow resulted in less ownership of the reform. The \nconsultant approach was also too fragmented and compartmentalized. Specialists do not have \nsufficient time to build relationships with counterparts within RDA due to relatively short spans of \ntime on the program. The situation is now being resolved through more brainstorming sessions, \nhigh-level  participation,  improved  communication  channel,  and  fewer  but  longer  and  broader \nbased expert consulting services. \n \n\nb. \n\nPrivate Sector Development \n\nDuring  processing  of  the  RSDP,  it  was  observed  that  the  underlying  cause  of  the \n16. \ninefficiency  in  the  sector  was  RDA\u2019s  reliance  on  its  Road  Construction  and  Development \nCompany  (RCDC).  The  automatic  use  of  RCDC  to  execute  most  domestically  funded  road \nworks  meant  there  was  no  pipeline  of  domestic  work  to  support  the  development  of  domestic \nprivate  sector  capacity  in  road  contracting  and  engineering  services.  The  RSDP,  therefore, \nprovided an arrangement to gradually transfer RCDC\u2019s role to the private sector. In processing \nthe  gradual  reduction  of  RCDC  role,  in  early  2004  the  Government  decided  to  close  RCDC \ndown  and  establish  a  smaller  Mega  Neguma  Group  consisting  of  (i)  a  road  construction \nequipment  company,  (ii)  an  emulsion  producer  company,  and  (iii)  a  consulting  firm.  This \ncompany  has  undertaken  emergency  works,  especially  after  the  tsunami.  The  Government \nassured that it would not allow Mega Neguma to distort the market for road construction works. \n\nFollowing  the  closure  of  RCDC,  almost  all  domestic  funded  road  rehabilitation  works \n17. \nhave  been  contracted  out  to  the  private  sector.  Several  foreign-funded  projects,  particularly \nthose financed by ADB and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), also provide \njob  opportunity  for  local  contractors,  resulting  in  the  growing  capacity  of  the  domestic \ncontracting  industry.  However,  some  weaknesses  still  exist,  including  limitations  in  financial \ncapacity,  engineering  plant,  and  management  skill.  There  were  also  cases  of  lack  of \ncompetition, resulting in unreasonably high bid prices. Since Sri Lanka is now embarking on an \nextensive road network improvement program, local capacity to execute larger contracts needs \nto be improved. One way is to encourage joint ventures with foreign contractors. \n\nc. \n\nSustainable Road Maintenance \n\nUnder  the  RSDP,  a  road  maintenance  management  system  on  the  basis  of  road \n18. \nconditions and economic returns has been introduced. A full round of data collection is ongoing \nand  the  current  road  maintenance  budgeting  and  expenditure  control  (RMBEC)  is  being \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\nimproved.  RMBEC was used for preparing the road maintenance program and budgeting, but \nRDA has never received the required financing due to budgetary constraints. A mechanism for \nroad maintenance financing with sufficient and sustainable funds is therefore critical. \n \nIn 2003 the Government approved the establishment of a road fund to be financed from \n19. \nfuel levy and managed by a Road Fund Board. Since the Cabinet decision was made, however, \nthere has been no action on the establishment of the operation and management mechanism of \nthe  fund.  Instead,  the  Government  has  decided  to  establish  a  trust  fund  dedicated  to  road \nmaintenance (paras. 38\u201340).  \n \n \nd. \n\nComprehensive Investment Program \n\n \n\n \nIn line with the comprehensive sector approach, ADB has provided a TA for preparing a \n20. \nnationwide  road  sector  master  plan  covering  national  and  provincial  roads,  as  an  integrated \nnetwork.7 The  plan  defines  the  most  efficient  core  network  and  assesses  the  need  for  road \ninvestment, including new construction, improvement, rehabilitation, and maintenance. The plan \nis  based  on  the  main  functions  of  the  road  network  in  promoting  integration  of  the  country, \nsustainable economic growth, poverty reduction, and trade and investment. The plan will serve \nas a sector development strategy that will guide the Government and its development partners \nin improving the road network in the country.  \n \n21. \nThe plan needs to be fine-tuned and adopted by the Government. The legal framework \nhas  been  assessed,  and  some  revisions  have  been  proposed  for  the  draft  National \nThoroughfares  Bill  and  the  Motor  Traffic  Act.  Road  classification  has  been  reviewed  and \nreclassification has been proposed based on the functional class. \n\n \n\ne. \n\nMedium-Term Sector Framework Update and Processing Milestones \n\nADB has also provided a TA loan8 to be used for a road project preparatory facility. The \n22. \nfacility will ensure that the investment plan developed under the road sector master plan could \nbe  further  developed  through  preparation  of  feasibility  studies  and  detailed  designs  for \nimplementation by the Government, ADB, and other development partners. \n \n \n \n23. \nOther development partners, particularly the World Bank and JBIC, are very supportive \nof ADB\u2019s approach. In November 2004, ADB, World Bank and JBIC officials held a retreat, and \na detailed approach to road sector intervention in Sri Lanka was agreed. It was agreed that ADB \nwould continue assisting RDA\u2019s institutional strengthening program, and together with the World \nBank  would  continue  pursuing  policy  dialogue  on  the  road  maintenance  financing  issues. \nPrivate  sector  development  has  been  addressed  by  all  partners,  with  assessment  of  the  local \ncontractor capacity being carried out by JBIC. In addition, the World Bank took over the lead in \nassisting the bus transport services industry. \n \n24. \nSeven  areas  of  reform  were  agreed  upon:  (i)  private  sector  participation,  (ii)  reform  of \nroad  sector  institutions,  (iii)  governance,  (iv)  road  maintenance,  (v)  policy  and  regulatory \nframework,  (vi)  transport  services,  and  (vii)  road  safety.  Appendixes  3  and  4  present  the \nupdated  policy  matrix  and  medium-term  sector  framework.  Overall,  institutional  and  policy \n\n                                                 \n7   RDA\u2019s  Investment  Plan  for  NHs  (2005\u20132010)  has  been  incorporated  and  updated  under  the  road  sector  master \n\nplan taking into account the complementarily of the provincial road network. \n\n8   ADB.  2004.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the  Democratic  Socialist \n\nRepublic of Sri Lanka for the Road Project Preparatory Facility Project. Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\freform  has  been  progressing  well.  The  reengineering  road  sector  institutions  and  the  original \nsector road map are intact in general, with some adjustment. \n \n25. \nThe Project will be the second in the series of interventions, and will support the second \nstage  of  the  institutional  reform  program  and  finance  the  upgrading  of  NHs.  The  agreed  upon \nmilestones for processing the Project have been generally met; some areas are in an advanced \nstage,  including  the  closure  of  RCDC  and  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to  establish  a  road \nmaintenance  trust  fund.  Besides,  RDA  has  produced  a  5-year  National  Highway  Investment \nPlan  (2005\u20132010).  The  remaining  milestones  related  to  the  institutional  strengthening  of  RDA \nare also being met, although with some delays.  \n \n26. \nIt  is  further  agreed  that  during  processing  of  the  next  project,  the  following  milestones \nwill  have  been  achieved:  (i)  adoption  of  an  annual  road  maintenance  plan,  (ii)  increases  in \nmaintenance funding as targeted, (iii) implementation of the RDA reorganization plan, and (iv) \nimprovement of the LAR management information system. \n \n\n2. \n\nKey Challenges \n\na. \n\nInstitutional and Organizational Aspects \n\nOne  of  the  objectives  of  the  sector  reform  program  is  to  enhance  RDA's  efficiency  in \n27. \ndelivering its mandate and in addressing current and future challenges. Building capacity must \ngo  in  tandem  with  an  effective  organizational  structure.  During  project  processing,  the  roles, \nmandates,  and  challenges  of  RDA  were  assessed,  and  the  appropriateness  of  the  current \norganizational structures against this background was reviewed. \n \n28. \nRDA  was  established  in  1981  through  the  RDA  Act  (No.  73).  In  line  with  the  Act, \ncurrently  there  are  five  appointed  members  and  five  other  members  representing  different \nministries.  Of  the  appointed  members,  one  holds  a  full  time  appointment  and  serves  as \nchairman. In addition, there is a general manager (GM) who is in charge of the overall business \nof RDA, including administrative control of RDA\u2019s employees.  \n \nAt present, RDA\u2019s operations are being carried out through 15 divisions and 9 provincial \n29. \noffices,  each  headed  by  a  director  (Appendix  5).  This  arrangement  results  in  the  GM\u2019s  very \nlarge span of control, which adversely affects the efficient function and coordination of RDA. It \ngives  the  GM  insufficient  time  to  establish  close  top  management  relationship  with  his \nimmediate subordinates which is needed for effective control and direction of the organization. \nIn addition, 10 project management units (PMUs), each headed by a project director in charge \nof externally funded and special projects and programs, report directly to the secretary of MOH. \n \nAn alternative structure (the RDA reorganization plan) to ensure manageability of RDA\u2019s \n30. \nworks,  particularly  the  core  businesses  as  mandated  by  the  RDA  Act,  has  been  approved  by \nRDA\u2019s  Board.  It  is  structured  along  four  functional  areas:  (i)  planning  and  programming,  (ii) \nasset  development,  (iii)  asset  management,  and  (iv)  finance  and  administration.  Each  will  be \nheaded  by  an  additional  GM.  In  addition,  a  central  support  service  office  will  be  established, \nconsisting of the (i) procurement and contract division, and (ii) environmental and social division \n(ESD)  with  responsibilities  for  environmental  impact  studies  and  clearance,  and  LAR.  The \ndivisions will report directly to the GM. The proposed RDA organizational chart (Appendix 6) will \nenable  RDA  to  have  sound  public management  in  the  road  sector.  The  ultimate  structure,  job \ndescription  of  each  function,  staff  and  budget  implication,  and  implementation  time  frame  are \nbeing worked out by RDA\u2019s task force.  \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\nThe  current  human  resources  policy  and  strategy  may  not  be  suitable  for  the  new \n31. \norganizational structure. Following the adoption and implementation of the RDA reorganization \nplan, the RDA human resources aspects will need to be assessed\u2014including the current human \nresources  policy  and  strategy,  the  current  and  future  workload\u2014  and  the  staff  resources  and \nskills  mix  required  by  RDA  to  fulfill  its  mandate  must  be  estimated.  A  new  human  resources \ndevelopment strategy will then be developed.  \n\nb. \n\nProject Implementation Aspects \n\n32. \nUnder  the  current  arrangements  (Appendix  5),  there  are  10  different  PMUs,  creating \nconfusion,  inconsistency,  and  duplication  of  efforts.  Furthermore,  the  arrangements  have \ndistanced  the  project  implementation  aspect  from  the  line  divisions  of  RDA.  Capacity  building \nthrough  foreign-funded  projects  has  benefited  only  PMU\u2019s  personnel,  but  not  RDA  as  an \ninstitution.  The  use  of  these  parallel  systems  should  be  reduced,  and  the  capacity  building \ngained by the PMUs should be internalized in the RDA organization. \n \nThat  could be  achieved  by  simplifying  arrangements,  utilizing  RDA\u2019s  main  organization \n33. \nstructure  to  the  extent  possible  by  gradually  integrating  PMUs  in  the  RDA  organization.  ADB \nhas  assisted  RDA  in  reorganizing  its  structure.  To  be  able  to  fully  phase  out  the  PMUs,  RDA \nhas to be equipped with solid and consistent systems and procedures in its business processes, \nincluding  consultant  selection,  procurement,  contract  management,  disbursement,  and \naccounting systems acceptable to all major development partners. The new business processes, \nimproved  under  the  RSDP,  will  need  to  be  harmonized  with  requirements  and  procedures  of \nother major development partners in the sector. \n \n34. \nIn view of the above issues, interim measures have been discussed and agreed upon by \nADB  and  the  Government  in  consultation  with  the  World  Bank.  No  new  PMU  will  be  created, \nand  the  RDA\u2019s  PMU  staff  will  be  absorbed  in  the  RDA  structure  after  completion  of  their \nrespective  projects  so  that  skill  and  experience  will  remain  within  RDA.  In  addition,  by \nDecember 2008, (i) the number of PMUs will be limited to four (one each for ADB, World Bank, \nand  JBIC,  and  one  for  others);  and  (ii)  harmonized  procedures  and  systems  will  have  been \ndeveloped and agreed upon. By December 2010, the PMUs will be fully absorbed into the RDA \norganizational system and under the direct supervision of the respective additional GM.9  \n \n35. \nCurrently,  RDA\u2019s  headquarters  are  located  in  a  building  that  is  also  occupied  by  other \nministries.  Its  divisions  are  spread  in  several  floors  and  locations,  and  some  units  are  located \noutside  the  compound.  This  has  constrained  coordination  among  the  divisions.  Furthermore, \nmany studies and project preparatory works have been done outside RDA\u2019s building, making it \ndifficult  for  the  consultants  to  provide  on-the-job  training  and  transfer  knowledge  to  RDA  staff. \nThe Government is considering establishing new RDA headquarters, where all RDA operations \ncould  be  handled  from  the  same  location.  Land  for  this  purpose  has  been  acquired,  and  the \ndesign  has  been  prepared.  The  Government  requested  ADB  to  finance  the  first-phase \nconstruction of the building under the proposed Project. \n \n\nc. \n\nRoad Upgrading and Rehabilitation \n\n36. \nThe surface of over 50% of NHs,  or about 5,800 km, is in poor and bad condition and \nneeds urgent rehabilitation and upgrading. The road sector master plan proposes targets under \n\n                                                 \n9 The  approach  is  in  line  with  the  Paris  Declaration  on  Aid  Effectiveness:  Ownership,  Harmonisation,  Alignment, \n\nResults and Mutual Accountability, March 2005, where Sri Lanka and ADB were among the signatories. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fwhich the whole NH network will be gradually improved to maintainable condition within the next \n12 years. Currently, about 1,500 km of NHs are being improved in conflict- and tsunami-affected \nareas. Starting in 2006, about 900 km will be improved with ADB and World Bank financing for \ncompletion in 2010. \n \n37. \nUnder the ongoing loan (footnote 7), preparatory work for about 1,500 km of NHs will be \ncarried out in the next 2 years, and will be continued for a similar magnitude, so road network \nrehabilitation continuity and project readiness will be improved. \n \n\nd. \n\nRoad Maintenance \n\n38. \nUnder the current budget administrative arrangement, a road maintenance trust fund is \nbeing set up, and a special account for it will be established with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. \nA  board  of  trustees  and  a  technical  advisory  committee  are  being  established.  Starting  in \nFY2006, the Government will allocate at the rate of SLRe1 per liter on petrol and SLRe0.5 per \nliter on diesel from all sales except for diesel used for power generation, for which all receipts \nwill  be  directly  deposited  to  the  fund.  Additional  budgetary  allocations  for  road  maintenance \ncurrently given directly to implementing agencies will also be channeled through the fund. The \narrangements  for  the  trust  fund,  prepared  in  close  consultation  with  the  World  Bank,  are  in \nAppendix 7. The conditions agreed are reflected in the deed of trust establishing the trust fund \nin accordance with the laws of Sri Lanka.  \n \n39. \nThe working of the trust fund will be reviewed after 3 years from the start, to determine \nits effectiveness in providing sustainable road maintenance financing, to seek ways of improving \nits operations, and, when appropriate, to bring forward legislation to establish a dedicated road \nmaintenance fund managed by an independent board. \n \n40. \nFor maintaining NH, it is estimated that the requirement for 2006 is about SLRs5.4 billion, \nwhich will steadily increase to SLRs5.9 billion in 2010. The total earmarked revenue from fuel is \nestimated  at  SLRs1.9  billion  in  2006  and  SLRs2.4  billion  in  2010.  For  2006,  the  Government \nagreed to increase the budget allocation for maintenance to SLRs3 billion (from SLRs1.9 billion \nin  2005)  for  NHs.  The  resources  of  the  fund  will  be  gradually  increased  by  increasing  budget \nallocation, increasing the fuel levy, or imposing vehicle registration fee to finance 100% of the \nrequirements for the NH maintenance by 2010.  \n \n41. \nCurrently  RDA  executes  road  maintenance  through  its  force  account.  Since  2000, \nexcept in 2004, RDA had not recruited additional casual labor. The casual labor arrangements \nfor  maintenance  show  lack  of  cost-effectiveness.  RDA  will  need  to  rationalize  the  labor  force \nand ensure effective utilization of the same for force account works. RDA will continue natural \nreduction of casual labor by not recruiting new labor and set up retirement age at 57 years. RDA \nhas also proposed to transform casual laborers into road maintenance groups to execute long-\nterm performance-based maintenance contracts. The Project supports this approach and a pilot \nscheme will be implemented. \n \n\n3. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n42. \nThe  development  of  the  road  network  in  Sri  Lanka  relies  heavily  on  international  and \nbilateral loan and grant funding (Appendix 8). Local funding is reserved mainly for counterpart \ncontributions  to  the  foreign-funded  projects,  particularly  for  land  acquisition  and  property \ncompensation, and a small amount is available for expenditure on capital road works. \n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\nSince 1980, ADB has provided 11 loans totaling about $535 million for the road sector, 2 \n43. \nof  them  through  multisector  emergency  loans.  Among  the  multilaterals,  ADB  is  the  largest \nprovider.  The  principal  bilateral  sources  of  external  assistance  have  been  Japan,  Republic  of \nKorea, Sweden, European Commission, Saudi Arabia, France, and Kuwait. To ensure efficiency \nin road development, a coordinated strategy for road sector development has been agreed upon \nbetween ADB, JBIC, and World Bank.  \n \n\n4. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n44. \nSince the 1990s, ADB has helped the Government open up road provision to the private \nsector,  through  the  use  of  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB),  training  and  capacity  building  to \nsupport private contractors, and studies to address key constraints to private sector participation. \nDomestic-funded  road  works  have  also  been  executed  by  private  contractors.  As  a  result, \ndomestic building contractors have successfully ventured into road construction.  \n \n45. \nLAR  processes  have  led  to  project  implementation  problems  and  delays  in  previous \nloans.  There  is  a  need  to  start  LAR  well  in  advance  before  project  approval.  The  financing  of \nLAR, which in many cases is quite high and exceeds the Government capability to provide it on \ntime, will need to be resolved. The Project will finance LAR expenditures along Colombo links. \n \nThe  previous  Southern  Transport  Development  Project  has  given  valuable  lessons  to \n46. \nboth the Government and ADB, particularly on safeguard related issues. The lessons are and \nwill be taken into account in designing, processing, and implementing the Project.  \n \nInadequate  postproject  maintenance  experienced  in  ADB  projects  is  part  of  a  broader \n47. \nlack of maintenance issue for the sector overall. This sector issue is being addressed both by \nimproving  road  maintenance  budgeting  and  expenditure  control  and  by  creating  a  sustainable \nroad maintenance financing mechanism. \n \n48. \nThe practice of establishing a separate PMU for each project has resulted in redundancy \nof  efforts  and  in  distancing  project  implementation  from  RDA  operation.  Capacity  building \nreceived under the projects has not been internalized in the RDA institution. ADB conducted a \nstudy of the matter and suggested phasing out the PMU arrangement. The Project is addressing \nthis  issue  by  utilizing  to  the  extent  possible  the  existing  organization  mechanism  for  project \nimplementation and the available multi-development bank standard documents for procurement \nand consultant selection. \n \n49. \nInstitutional  reform  initiated  under  the  RSDP  needs  to  be  sustained  if  it  is  to  produce \nlasting  improvements.  The  proposed  Project  will  continue  to  assist  the  implementation  of  the \nagreed-upon  medium-term  reform  agenda.  An  RDA  medium-term  institutional  strengthening \nframework (Appendix 9) has been agreed upon as an effective vehicle for detailing the agreed \nupon measures and actions. \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe main impact of the Project is expansion of economic opportunities leading to higher \n\n50. \nincome. The outcome is improved efficiency of the NH network. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n51. \nThe  project  outputs  are  (i)  strengthened  road  sector  institutions,  and  (ii)  improved  NH \nnetwork.  They  will  promote  sustainable  economic  growth  leading  to  poverty  reduction  by \nlowering the cost of road transport, relieving traffic congestion, and improving access. \n \n\n1. \n\nPolicy and Institutional Support Component \n\nThe Project will further assist in the sector reform complementing the ongoing assistance \n52. \nunder  the  RSDP  and  will  help  RDA  to  achieve  objectives  detailed  in  its  institutional \nstrengthening  framework  (Appendix  9).  In  addition,  the  Project  will  assist  MOH  and  RDA  in \npolicy  and  institutional  aspects,  e.g.,  reviewing  and  implementing  road  sector  master  plan, \ntransport  sector  policy,  regulatory  framework,  road  classification.  Other  required  policy-related \nassistance,  including  road  safety  and  heavy  vehicle  control,  found  at  a  later  stage  will  be \nconsidered during project implementation. \n \nThe  Project  will  also  review  and  improve  RDA\u2019s  human  resources  development  policy \n53. \nand strategies based on the new organizational structure and business processes so that RDA \ncan perform its mandate effectively. The component will assess the current and future workload, \nqualification  and  skills  requirement,  staff  shortages/excess,  and  training  needs.  Recruitment \nstrategies,  a  performance  evaluation  system,  and  a  career  development  program  will  also  be \ndeveloped.  This  new  human  resources  strategy  will  be  completed  by  June  2007,  and  the \nGovernment will apply the recommendations as appropriate by December 2007. \n \nTo  assist  MOH  and  RDA  in  keeping  track  of  the  progress  of  all  projects,  especially \n54. \nforeign-funded projects, the Project will provide a project management adviser. The adviser will \nhelp the Government manage RDA portfolio, implement integration of the PMUs, and facilitate \nharmonization of project preparation and implementation activities. The Project will also finance \nconstruction  of  the  RDA  headquarters  to  support  RDA\u2019s  institutional  strengthening  program \n(para. 35) and facilitate the effort to improve RDA\u2019s efficiency. \n \n\n2. \n\nNational Highways Upgrading and Maintenance Component \n\n55. \nAbout  500  km  of  NHs  have  been  selected  from  the  Investment  Plan  (2005\u20132010), \nthrough  multicriteria  analysis  of  (i)  economic  benefit,  (ii)  social  benefit,  and  (iii)  the  role  of  the \nhighway  in  network  development  and  economic  growth.  The  selected  roads  could  be \ncategorized as  (i)  northern  east-west  corridor,  (ii)  hilly  roads,  (iii)  south  highway  links,  and  (iv) \nColombo  links.  The  south  highway  links  are  very  important  to  ensure  that  the  development \nimpact of the new highway will be optimized. The remaining roads are part of the core arterial \nnetwork, as defined in the road sector master plan, which need major rehabilitation.10 Appendix \n10 lists the candidate roads. \n \n56. \nRoad  Upgrading.  Considering  the  limited  funds  available  under  the  Project,  a \ncombination  of  roads,  totaling  about  270  km,  has  been  selected.  The  roads  are  (i)  A012: \nPuttalam-Anuradhapura (70 km), (ii) A005: Nuwara Eliya-Badulla (54.9 km), (iii) A007: Hatton-\nNuwara Eliya (44.8 km), (iv) A026: Udatenna-Mahiyangana (40.8 km), (v) B409: Thalgodapitiya-\nDombawela  (26.4  km),  (vi)  B157:  south  highway-Alutgama  (10.5  km),  (vii)  B153:  Hikkaduwa-\nsouth  highway  (13.3  km),  (viii)  A024:  Matara-south  highway  (4.0  km),  and  (ix)  B207: \nKatukurunda-Nagoda (2.7 km).  \n\n                                                 \n10 The World Bank is concurrently preparing a loan for rehabilitation of the other parts of the core arterial network. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n\nThe  Project  will  promote  economic  activities  outside  Colombo.  The  roads  will  be \n57. \nwidened,  upgraded,  and  realigned  as  necessary,  to  meet  the  projected  traffic  demand  for  the \nnext 20 years. The pavement is designed for a life of up to 10 years that could be extended to \n15\u201320 years with proper maintenance and axle load control. Bridges, drainage structures, and \nculverts will be improved and replaced as necessary. Along the project highways, the need for \naxle load measurement will be identified and weigh stations will be provided accordingly as part \nof  the  civil  works  contracts.  Road  safety  audit  will  be  built  into  the  engineering  designs  and \nfollowed through during construction. The design standards and features are in Appendix 11.   \n \n58. \nLAR  of  Colombo  Links.  The  Colombo  links,  totaling  80.5  km,  have  very  high  traffic \nvolumes  and  therefore  a  very  high  economic  rate  of  return.  However  the  proposed  upgrading \nwill require substantial and expensive LAR and will take an implementation period too long for \nthe  Project.  The  links  are  (i)  A001:  KiribathgodaNitambuwa  (25.5  km),  (ii)  A004:  Kirulapone\u2013\nGodagama  (19.7  km),  (iii)  B084:  Pamankanda  Bridge\u2013Horana  (27.6  km),  and  (iv)  B435: \nOrugodawatta\u2013Ambatale (7.7 km). Therefore, the Project will finance the LAR expenditures, and \nexecute  civil  works  only  when  LAR  has  been  completed  possibly  under  the  next  project.  The \nfinancing  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the \nrequirements  of  DOC.R193-05:  Cost  Sharing  and  Eligibility  of  Expenditures  for  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  Financing:  A  New  Approach,  and  the  detailed  staff  instructions  to  be \npromulgated thereto. \n \n59. \nDue  diligence  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  DOC.R193-05: \nCost  Sharing  and  Eligibility  of  Expenditures  for  Asian  Development  Bank  Financing:  A  New \nApproach and the related draft OM Section H3/BP, which are broadly consistent with that of the \nWorld Bank and follows closely the rationale and presentation in its Eligibility of Expenditures in \nWorld Bank Lending: A New Policy Framework. Therefore, the formulation and due diligence of \nthe  LAR  subcomponent  was  also  guided  by  the  detailed  staff  instructions  issued  by  World \nBank\u2019s Operations Policy and Country Services, in Bank Financing: Guidelines to Staff, April 16 \n2004. An assessment (Appendix 12) was made of the (i) productivity of land purchase under the \nproject,  (ii)  land  market  conditions,  (iii)  channeling  of  money,  (iv)  risks  related  to  transactions, \nand (v) monitoring and evaluation arrangements. The economic benefit of the Project exceeds \nthe opportunity cost of the current use of the land. Land purchases for roads reflect the market \nmechanism,  and  no  distortion  is  foreseen.  Compensation  will  be  paid  at  replacement  value. \nValuation of losses will be determined by the chief valuer of the Valuation Department, who is \nan independent professional valuation expert, following the international valuation best practice. \nRDA  will  recruit  2  additional  valuers  and  20  valuation  inspectors  for  3  years  and  provide \nrequired facilities to carry out valuation following the agreed methodology and principles and in \naccordance  with  the  approved  entitlement  matrix.  The  Chief  Valuer\u2019s  Office  will  then \nindependently verify the accuracy of each entitlement.  \n \nThe  administrative  arrangement  for  channeling  funds  has  been  in  place.  The  risk  of \n60. \ndelayed  payment  will  be  minimized  by  providing  an  imprest  account,  and  by  requiring  the \nrespective  divisional  secretaries,  who  are  responsible  for  paying  the  compensation  to  affected \npersons  (APs),  to  provide  one-time  payment  of  the  replacement  value  of  the  land  purchase \nexpeditiously  within  the  statutory  framework,  but  in  any  event  not  later  than  3  months  after \nvaluation has been established. All payments will be made in Government checks. To expedite \nthe payment process, every divisional secretary will be assisted by 2\u20133 acquiring officers. \n\nPerformance-Based  Maintenance  Program.  As  detailed  in  Appendix  13,  the  Project \n61. \nwill  develop  a  pilot  4-year  road  maintenance  program  of  the  NH  network  in  4\u20136  executive \nengineer divisions, to be implemented through 4\u20136 contracts with private sector contractors and \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fwith  the  small  contractors  formed  from  the  current  casual  labor  available  in  the  respective \ndivisions.  The  contract  packages  will  be  selected  to  obtain  a  broad  base  of  lessons  from \ndifferent  locations,  different  road  conditions,  different  contractors,  and  different  circumstances. \nThe contracts could be extended subject to the contractors\u2019 satisfactory performance.  \n\n62. \nThe  Project  will  finance  LAR  expenditures  of  the  Colombo  links.  Together  with  the \nestablishment of ESD and the associated TA, the Project will strengthen RDA in dealing with the \nLAR  aspect,  develop  LAR  management  information  system,  ensure  that  payment  is  made  on \ntime, and ensure the readiness of the Colombo links when the funds become available.  \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n63. \nThe  estimated  total  cost  is  $208.0  million  equivalent,  inclusive  of  taxes,  duties, \ncommitment charges, and interest during implementation (Table 1). The foreign exchange cost \nis  estimated  at  $72.3  million  (34.8%),  and  the  local  currency  cost  at  $135.7  million  equivalent \n(65.2%).

The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  5  years;  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum;  and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  The \ncommitment  charge  and  the  interest  during  construction  will  be  capitalized  in  the  loan.  The \nGovernment  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  upon  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n \n65. \nADB  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  all  consulting  services  and  LAR  of  the \nColombo links expenditures, incremental expenditures of the project management, and part of \nthe equipment and civil works expenditures. The Government will finance local currency costs of \n$50.0 million equivalent to cover all taxes, duties, in-kind contributions for project management, \nLAR of non-Colombo links, and part of the equipment and civil works expenditures (Table 2).  \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment  \n\nTotal \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nForeign Exchange\n72.3 \n0.0 \n72.3 \n\nLocal Currency \n\n77.7 \n58.0 \n135.7 \n\nTotal \n150.0 \n58.0 \n208.0 \n\n% \n72.1 \n27.9 \n100.0 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n66. \nAlthough no cofinancing is envisioned at this time, cofinancing from commercial sources \nmay  be  mobilized  in  the  future  to  complement  ADB  financing  for  the  sector.  Such  cofinancing \nmay  benefit  from  ADB  credit  enhancement,  including  ADB  guarantee  instruments,  and  will  be \npresented separately for Board consideration as and when it materializes.11 \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nThe Executing Agency of the Project will be MOH, and the Implementing Agency will be \n67. \nRDA  through  the  already  established  PMU,  headed  by  a  project  director,  who  is  currently \nresponsible  for  implementing  the  preconstruction  activities.  This  PMU  will  coordinate  overall \nproject implementation. RDA has adequate financial systems and human resources to manage \nthe Project even while the reorganization is ongoing. \n \n68. \nFor  executing  civil  works,  four  existing  RDA  provincial  directors  (PDs)  will  act  as  the \nRDA representatives. Assisted by the relevant chief engineer\u2019s offices, PDs will be responsible \nfor day-to-day implementation. PD of the Central Province will be responsible for the A025 and \nB409  contracts,  that  of  the  Northwestern  Province  for  the  A012  contract,  that  of  Southern \nProvince for the south highway links, and that of Uva Province for the (A005 + A007). RDA will \n\n                                                 \n11  The  Government  is  exploring  cofinancing  from  other  donors,  including  the  OPEC  Fund  for  International \nDevelopment,  to  finance  additional  roads  from  the  list  in  Appendix  10,  for  which  financing  and  administrative \narrangements will be developed when and as required. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fensure  that  the  PDs  will  be  provided  with  sufficient  support  staff  and  resources.  The \nimplementation organization chart is in Appendix 15. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n69. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  4  years  (Appendix  16).  RDA  ensures  that  most \npreconstruction  activities  will be  completed  by  May  2006.  Procurement  will  be  carried  out in 2 \nphases,  one  for  the  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures,  and  the  other  for  LCB \nprocedures. Civil works are expected to be completed by 31 December 2009. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nAll  procurement  under  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n70. \nGuidelines  for  Procurement  and  the  Government\u2019s  tender  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. \nSupply  contracts  valued  over  $1,000,000  will  be  procured  under  ICB;  $100,000\u20131,000,000, \nunder international shopping; and less than $100,000, under direct purchase arrangement.  \n \n71. \nThe  indicative  contract  packages  are  in  Appendix  17.  Three  civil  works  contract \npackages  with  estimated  values  of  $11.7  million\u2013$24.5  million  will  be  procured  in  accordance \nwith  ICB  procedures.  Five  civil  works  contract  packages,  with  estimated  values  mostly  at  or \nbelow  $4  million,  except  one  valued  at  $6  million,  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  LCB \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. All contracts have been packaged based on road sections, with \nno  split  on  any  section  for  efficiency  of  implementation.  As  requested  by  the  Government,  for \nsmall value and sparsely located packages, the contracts will be under LCB. The ongoing and \nprevious  ADB-  and  other  externally  financed  projects  in  Sri  Lanka  have  demonstrated  that \ndomestic contractors are capable of performing road works successfully.  \n \n72. \nPrequalification  will  be  exercised  for  the  civil  works  ICB  contracts,  with  45  days  for \nsubmission  of  prequalification  applications,  and  bidding  period  of  60  days.  For  LCB  contracts, \nbidders will be postqualified by applying a single-stage bidding procedure, with a bid period of \n30 days. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy will be included in all documents \nand contracts relating to the bidding and implementation of the Project. \n \n73. \nAs  requested  by  the  Government,  ADB  supports  the  Government\u2019s  initiative  to  take \nadvance  procurement  action  and  to  provide  necessary  resources  for  the  advance  action.  The \nGovernment has been advised, however, that support for advance action does not commit ADB \nto finance the Project.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nAll  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \n74. \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. For \nthe  policy  and  institutional  support  component,  consultants  with  expertise  in  transport  policy, \norganizational  development,  and  human  resources  management,  will  be  recruited  on  an \nindividual  basis.  The  inputs  will  be  25  and  50  person-months  each  from  international  and \ndomestic consultants. The terms of reference (TOR) are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n75. \nFor construction supervision, an international firm associated with a domestic firm will be \nrecruited,  using  the  full  technical  proposal  requirement.  Supplementary  Appendix  B  gives  the \nTOR. Evaluation will follow the quality- and cost-based selection method. The package will have \na total of about 200 person-months international and 880 person-months domestic inputs. The \n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n\nconsultant will provide on-the-job training for RDA regional staff who will be involved in day-to-\nday construction supervision.  \n \n76. \nFor the performance-based maintenance program, 12 and 15 person-months input from \nan  international  and  a  domestic  consultant,  respectively,  will  be  provided  intermittently.  The \nconsultants will be recruited on an individual basis. \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n77. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government. \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and  transparency,  ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the Loan Regulations and the bidding \ndocuments  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  will  include  provisions \nspecifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  RDA  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nLoan  disbursements  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n78. \nand  Disbursement  Guidelines  for  Disbursement  Operations,  LIBOR-Based  Loan  Products,  as \namended from time to time. For consulting services, loan funds will be disbursed using ADB\u2019s \ndirect payment procedures. Two imprest accounts will be established at the Central Bank, one \nfor LAR of Colombo links expenditures and another for other expenditures. The initial advances \nto be deposited to the accounts will be equivalent to the estimated eligible expenditures for the \nnext  6  months,  and  will  not  exceed  $4.5  million  and  $6.5  million,  respectively.  The  imprest \naccounts  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook,  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  to  by  the  Government  and  ADB. \nStatement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedures  will  be  used  to  reimburse,  liquidate,  or  replenish \nthe imprest account for any individual payments not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting and Auditing \n\n79. \nRDA  and  its  PMU  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts.  The  statements  will  be \naudited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing  standards  by  an  independent  auditor \nacceptable to ADB. The audited reports and financial statements will be submitted to ADB not \nlater than 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. To reach the target, RDA will submit the \nunaudited  reports  and  financial  statements  to  the  Auditor  General  within  two  months  after  the \nend  of  each  fiscal  year.  The  imprest  accounts  and  SOE  will  be  audited  as  part  of  the  regular \nannual audit. The auditor\u2019s opinion of the examination of the imprest account and SOE will be \nset  out  in  the  auditor\u2019s  report.  RDA  has  been  made  aware  of  ADB's  policy  on  delayed \nsubmission and also of the importance of satisfactory and acceptable quality of audited reports. \n \nUnder  the  ongoing  RDA\u2019s  institutional  strengthening  program,  a  project  performance \n80. \naudit manual is being prepared to assess the performance of project participants at any stage of \nthe  project  activities.  The  main  objectives  of  instituting  a  performance  assessment  of  road \ninfrastructure projects are to (i) assess the performance of each of the selected participants in \nthe identified activities, (ii) identify whether there had been any departure from the norms and \nstandards  of  ADB  or  the  Government,  (iii)  assess  the  quality  of  works,  (iv)  assess  the \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\feffectiveness of the system, and (v) identify issues need to be improved and/or modified. As a \npilot, the Project will be subject to that performance audit. \n \n81. \nFor  the  LAR  of  Colombo  links,  the  Project  will  engage  an  independent  financial  and \ntechnical expert or agency who will undertake an audit every 6 months. Such audit will include a \nreview  of  LAR  compensation  (both  methodology  and  payments),  procedures  and  processes. \nThe expert will submit its audit report to both RDA and ADB. Should any irregularity be found by \nthe auditor on any particular road section, ADB will suspend disbursement for LAR expenditures \non that particular road section until matters have been settled by the relevant authority. Any cost \nimplication due to such suspension will be borne by the Government. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n82. \nThe  achievement  of  the  project  performance  targets  will  be  assessed  following  the \ndesign  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  1).  RDA,  assisted  by  the  supervision  consultant, \nwill establish a project performance management system. Indicators to be monitored include (i) \nnumber of businesses, (ii) household income, (iii) vehicle ownership, (iv) unemployment rate, (v) \nland  value,  (vi)  traffic  volume,  (vii)  bus  and  freight  transport  fares,  (viii)  travel  time,  (ix)  road \naccidents,  (x)  overloading  vehicles,  (xi)  vehicle  operating  cost,  and  (xii)  surface  roughness. \nThese indicators will be monitored before and after construction, on the project highways and on \nsome control highways. In addition, every year during the project period RDA will also monitor (i) \nthe  road  maintenance  budget,  (ii)  ratio  of  RDA  staff/km  of  NH,  and  (iii)  road  maintenance \ncost/km. Achievement of the medium institutional strengthening program (Appendix 9) will also \nbe  monitored.  For  civil  works,  progress  will  be  monitored  and  reported  monthly  by  the \nsupervision  consultant.  For  performance  based  maintenance  contracts,  the  indicators  to  be \nmonitored will be developed during implementation in line with specifications in Appendix 13. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n83. \nA project inception mission will be fielded soon after the project loan effectiveness date \nwhen substantial preconstruction activities are completed; thereafter, regular reviews will follow \nannually or more frequent initially to keep the reform moving. In 2008, a midterm review by the \nGovernment and ADB will consider the Project\u2019s progress and agree on any changes in scope \nor implementation to achieve the project objectives. RDA will monitor project implementation in \naccordance  with  the  schedule  and  time-bound  milestones,  and  keep  ADB  informed  of  any \nsignificant deviations that may result in the milestones not being met.  \n \n84. \nFor  monitoring  progress  in  implementing  the  Project,  RDA  will  prepare  and  submit  to \nADB monthly progress reports in a brief form, based on which, more detailed quarterly reports \nwill  be  submitted,  containing  basic  data,  utilization  of  funds,  achievement  of  immediate \ndevelopment  objectives,  compliance  with  covenants,  implementation  progress,  LAR  progress, \nand major issues and problems. The monthly reports should be received by ADB within 15 days \nof  the  end  of  the  month.  The  format  and  content  will  follow  the  project  administration \nmemorandum to be agreed upon at the inception mission.  \n \n85.  Within  3  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  the  Government  will  submit  to \nADB  a  project  completion  report  with  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  project  design,  costs, \ncontractors and consultants\u2019 performance, social and economic impact, economic rate of return, \nand  other  details  as  may  be  requested  by  ADB.  The  project  performance  indicators  will  be \ncompared with those of the control roads. In addition, the report will include (i) a concise history \n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n\nof LAR aspects of the project to completion, (ii) an evaluation of the implementation of the LAR- \nrelated loan covenants, and (iii) a summary of the external monitoring and evaluation reports. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n86. \nA TA for $400,000 to be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program, titled \nCapacity Building of the Environmental and Social Division, will be provided to strengthen RDA \nin dealing with the environmental, social, and LAR aspects of highway development.  \n \n87. \nA  team  of  consultants, consisting  of  one  international  and one  domestic  environmental \nspecialist,  one  international/regional  and  one  domestic  resettlement  specialist,  and  one \ndomestic management information system specialist, will be recruited. The five will be recruited \non an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  The  consultants  will \nprepare an operations manual for the division and provide hands-on training using the Project \nas a case, from preparation to implementation. The TA will be implemented in 18 months, and \neach  consultant  will  serve  8  person-months  intermittently,  totaling  16  international  and  24 \ndomestic consultant inputs. The TOR is in Appendix 18. \n \n88. \nThe  Government  will  provide  office  space  and  accommodation  as  required.  By  31 \nJanuary  2006,  additional  staff  consisting  of  (i)  one  environmental  officer,  (ii)  one  resettlement \nofficer,  (iii)  one  database  management  officer,  and  (ii)  one  public  communication  officer  will \nhave been recruited for ESD. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n89. \nThe Project will improve the overall performance of the sector, contributing to transport \nefficiency,  and  widening  access  to  economic  opportunities.  The  project  beneficiaries  will  be \npeople,  companies,  and  government  and  nongovernment  agencies in Sri  Lanka  that  use  road \ntransport  services  directly  and  indirectly.  Communities  served  by  the  project  roads  will  benefit \nfrom improved, lower cost, and faster transport services, and thereby obtain improved access to \neconomic opportunities and social services. Operators of both passenger and freight transport \nservices will benefit from improved roads in terms of lower vehicle operating cost (VOC), time \nsavings,  and  improved  road  safety,  and  thereby  increase  productivity.  Government  and \nnongovernment agencies served by the project roads will be able to improve its service delivery. \n \nThose  benefits  and  positive  impacts  will  occur,  assuming  that  complementary  external \n90. \nassistance  and  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  in  developing  the  national  road  network  and \neconomic  infrastructure  will  continue.  The  major  project  risks,  which  have  been  minimized \nthrough  mitigating  measures,  are  that  (i)  the  institutional  strengthening  program  will  not  be \nimplemented in full, leading to less-than-intended improvements in sector performance; (ii) post \nproject road maintenance will be inadequate; and (iii) counterpart funding will be inadequate. \n \nA. \n \n91. \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  geometric  design,  widen  the  carriageway,  strengthen  the \npavement,  improve  surface  condition,  improve  drainage  system  and  bridges,  and  provide \nsignage and marking of the project highways. The risk of road accidents due to smoother travel \nwill  be  mitigated  by  providing  proper  safety  features.  The  improvements  will  raise  the  level  of \nservice of the project highways, shorten travel time, and improve road safety and riding comfort. \n \n\nTechnical Aspect \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\nPolicy and Institutional Aspects \n\nThe benefits will last throughout the design life of the project roads, assuming provision \n92. \nof timely routine and periodic maintenance. The road maintenance issue has been addressed in \na  broader  term  through  the  establishment  of  a  dedicated  road  maintenance  special  account. \nThe risk of delayed implementation has been mitigated by adopting advance action, utilizing the \nexisting  PMU  and  RDA\u2019s  CEOs  located  in  the  project  sites  for  close  supervision  of  project \nimplementation, and strengthening RDA\u2019s project management functions. \n \nB. \n \n93. \nThe  Project  will  facilitate  RDA\u2019s  institutional  strengthening  program  that  in  turn  will \ncontribute  to  overall  transport  efficiency,  thus  promoting  a  wide  range  of  economic  activities \nusing the NH network. Overall, the country\u2019s economic growth will be boosted.  \n \n94. \nRDA reorganization and improvement of its human resources development strategy are \ntimely. Phasing out PMUs in parallel with streamlining and harmonizing procedures will lead to \none  agency  and  one  system  within  RDA,  eliminating  duplication  of  efforts.  Moving  gradually \nfrom  force  account  to  a  long-term  performance-based  maintenance  contract  will  gradually \nimprove  road  network  performance  in  a  cost-effective  manner.  RDA  will  evolve  into  a  lean, \nfunction focused, and effective organization.  \n \nRDA\u2019s  institutional  strengthening  program,  however,  might  not  be  completed  on  time. \n95. \nContinued Government commitment to reengineering RDA is therefore critical. To minimize this \nrisk,  ADB  and  RDA  have  agreed  on  a  framework  with  milestones  to  be  achieved  through  the \nmedium-term  institutional  strengthening  program  (Appendix  9),  and  policy  and  institutional \nsupport will be provided to assist RDA in implementing the program.  \n \nC. \n \n96.  Supplementary Appendix C provides summary economic evaluation for the project roads, \nprepared  in  accordance with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.  The  project \nroads  are  expected  to  have  an  average  economic  life  of  20  years,  with  periodic  maintenance \nand strengthening applied part-way through the evaluation period.  The upgraded highway will \nallow improved traffic flow, higher vehicle speeds, and shorter travel time, all resulting in lower \nroad user costs. The main economic benefits estimated for the Project are (i) VOC savings for \nnormal traffic,12 and (ii) time savings for passengers and cargo transport. \n \nThe overall economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated at 18.2%. Economic \n97. \nviability under various sensitivity tests show that the Project remains economically viable as the \nEIRR  remains  above  the  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12%  except  for  the  cases  of  a  20% \nreduction in benefits and for the combined increase in the capital cost of the project by 20% and \na reduction of benefits by 20% combined. The probability of this occurring is low (0.8%). \n \nD. \n \nBased on information in the initial environmental examination (IEEs) report, the following  \n98. \nsubprojects  potentially  need  further  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA):  (i)  B153: \nHikkaduwa-south  highway  (13.3  km),  involves  raising  the  elevation  of  road  embankment    by \nfilling wetland;  (ii) A026: Udatenna-Mahiyangana (40.8 km), 24 km of its stretch passes through \n\nEnvironmental Aspect \n\nEconomic Aspect \n\n                                                 \n12  Generated traffic has not been included in the analysis as it is difficult to estimate, the expected additional benefits \n\nwill be relatively small (in the order of 5%), and omitting them will enable more conservative evaluation.   \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n\n \n\nVictoria  Randanigala  Sanctuary;  (iii)  A005:  Nuwara  Eliya-Badulla  (54.9  km),  passes  Hakgala \nBotanical  Garden;  and  (iv)  A012:  Puttalam-Anuradhapura  (70  km),  2  km  of  its  stretch  passes \nthrough Karuwalagaswewa Wildlife Sanctuary. Therefore, the Project is classified as category A \nin accordance with the ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). \n \n99. \nUnder the sector loan modality, RDA and ADB selected A012: Puttalam-Anuradaphura \n(70 km) as a sample category A subproject; while (i) A024: Matara-south highway (4 km) and (ii) \nB157: south highway-Alutgama (10.5 km) are selected as sample category B subprojects. The \nEIA  and  IEEs,  including  the  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs),  of  these  sample \nsubprojects  were  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines \n(2003).  The  summary  EIA  (SEIA)  was  circulated  to  ADB\u2019s  Board  on  5  August  2005 \n(Supplementary  Appendix  D).  The  Central  Environmental  Agency  (CEA)  of  Sri  Lanka  decided \nthat all sample subprojects fall under category B, which requires only IEEs (CEA\u2019s letter dated \n22 July 2005 and subsequent meetings). Nevertheless, CEA required environmental clearance \nhas to be obtained before commencement of civil works. \n \n100.  Most of the predicted project impacts will occur during the construction phase, and are \ntemporary in nature. Consultation with some residents around the sanctuary showed that some \ngroups  of  elephants  often  pass  through  the  sanctuary,  crossing  the  A012  section.  Mitigating \nmeasures will be provided to minimize the impacts of the Project on the sanctuary. There will be \nno widening and construction work will be at a minimum on the road in the sanctuary area. The \nProject will also provide proper traffic signs informing road users that they are passing through a \nnational park, and enforce speed control measures in the sanctuary area. The remaining stretch \n(68 km) of A012 passes through a flat area, and the expected impacts will not be significant. \n \n101.  For  the  nonsample  roads,  the  IEEs/EIAs  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (Supplementary  Appendix  E),  developed  to \nensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Policy (2002) and the Government environmental \nregulation.  The  classification  of  the  subprojects  will  follow  both  Government  and  ADB \nprocedures, but in any conflict, the stricter classification will apply. The IEEs will be submitted to \nand  approved  by  ADB  before  award  of  the  respective  civil  works  contracts;  the  EIAs  will  be \nsubmitted  for  ADB  review,  and  the  SEIAs  will  be  available  to  the  general  public  at  least  120 \ndays before approval of the respective subprojects.  \n \n102. \nIf  change  in  alignment  is  required  after  the  IEE  or  EIA  report  is  completed,  ADB  in \nconsultation  with  CEA  will  determine  whether  additional  environmental  study  must  be  carried \nout. The report of the additional study will be submitted to and approved by ADB. If the change \nin alignment leads to the need for an EIA report, the SEIA will be posted on ADB\u2019s website 120 \ndays before award of the respective civil works contract. \n \n103.  RDA  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  overall  EMP.  CEOs  will  implement  all \nmitigating measures during construction and operation of the project roads in line with the EMPs. \nESD will support CEOs and ensure regular consultation with APs during project implementation. \nPuttalam-Anuradhapura  will  be  used  as  a  pilot  model  for  involving  community-based \norganizations and local communities in monitoring implementation of the EMP and  will update \nthe EMP, as necessary, through intensive consultations.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\nSocial Aspect \n\n \nE. \n \n104.  The  Project  will  have  no  negative  gender-related  impacts.  No  record  of  HIV/AIDS13 is \nfound in the project area. According to a World Health Organization report (2004), Sri Lanka is \nclassified as a low-level epidemic country with below 5% HIV prevalence rates among high-risk \npopulation.  HIV  prevalence  was  0.2%  among  female  sex  workers.  Among  603  truck  drivers \ntested,  no  sample  was  found  positive  for  HIV.  However,  considering  the  possible  presence  of \nforeign laborers for road construction under the Project, the Government will ensure that the civil \nworks  contracts  require  contractors  to  (i)  provide  construction  workers  with  HIV/AIDS \nawareness  and  prevention  programs;  (ii)  disseminate  at  work  sites  information  on  risks  of \nsexually  transmitted  diseases  and  HIV/AIDS;  and  (iii)  follow  and  implement  legally  mandated \nprovisions on labor (including equal pay for equal work), health, safety, sanitation, and working \nconditions. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 19. \n \n105.  Most  improvement  works  will  be  carried  out  within  the  existing  right-of-way.  However, \nthe  overall  LAR  impact  for  the  Project  will  still  be  significant.  In  accordance  with  ADB's \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995), the resettlement plans (RPs) for two subprojects (A005: \nNuwara  Eliya-Badulla  and  B435:  Orugodawatta-Ambatale,  representing  a  hilly  road  and  an \nurbanized road, respectively) have  been submitted to ADB  as samples, which will be updated \nduring the detailed design period. The summary RP of these sample roads and the entitlement \nmatrix have been endorsed by the Government (Supplementary Appendices F and G). \n \n106.  To ensure that RPs for the subsequent subprojects will be prepared satisfactorily and in \ntime  for  effective  distribution,  a  resettlement  framework  (RF)  has  been  prepared,  outlining \npolicies  and  procedures  (Supplementary  Appendix  H).  The  risk  of  delayed  LAR  is  being \naddressed through the establishment of ESD with its capacity building under the proposed TA, \nand the proper budgeting of LAR costs under the Project. \n \n107.  The  summary  RP  of  the  sample  roads  and  the  RF  have  been  translated  into  the  local \nlanguages and disclosed to the APs and posted on the ADB website. A press notice about the \nProject announcing that the summary RP and RF are available in the district offices was put out. \nThe sample RP and the RF were submitted to the Ministry of Land Development and CEA for \nnecessary clearances.  \n \n108.  The  project impact  on  indigenous  people  will  be  insignificant.  Communities  affected  by \nthe Project will be Sinhalese, Muslims, and Tamil. There is no indication of differential impacts \nof the Project, either positive or negative, on the three groups. Therefore, no indigenous people \ndevelopment plan or indigenous people development framework has been prepared; however, a \nsection on special actions is included in the RF and the sample RPs, and will be included in the \nsubsequent RPs as necessary. The Project will support equal treatment of all groups. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nA. \n \n109. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  RDA  have  given  the \n\n                                                 \n13 Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n21\n\n \n\n(i) \n\nRestructuring RDA\u2019s organization.

While the road network is extensive, 1.5 km/km2, most roads were \nbuilt more than 50 years ago. Road maintenance, rehabilitation, and new construction have not \nkept abreast of the rapid growth in demand for transport (Table A2.1). \n\nTable A2.1: Roads Categorized by General Condition  \n(%) \n\nRoad Class \nNational Highways \nProvincial Roads \nLocal Authority Roads \nTotal \nSource: Road Sector Master Plan, Draft Final Report, August 2005. \n\nGood \n18.4 \n8.0 \n5.0 \n7.2 \n\nPoor \n35.4 \n36.0 \n40.0 \n38.7 \n\nFair \n29.8 \n40.0 \n30.0 \n31.7 \n\nBad \n16.4 \n16.0 \n25.0 \n22.4 \n\nTotal \n100 \n100 \n100 \n100 \n \n\n2. \nThe  Ministry  of  Highways  (MOH)  has  overall  responsibility  for  policies  and  programs \nconcerning  NH  network.  The  Road  Development  Authority  (RDA), 1  a  statutory  institution \nassigned to MOH, is responsible for planning and managing the development and maintenance \nof NHs. Although RDA has the structure of a commercial organization, with a chairman, general \nmanager,  and  a  board  of  directors,  in  practice  it  operates  as  a  government  department  under \nMOH,  with  relatively  limited  autonomy.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT)  has  responsibility  for \noverall policy and regulation in the land transport sector, covering road and rail transport.   \n\n3. \n\nThe national highway investment program for 2006\u20132010 is shown in Table A2.2.   \n \nTable A2.2:  2006\u20132010 National Highway Investment Program \n(SLRs million) \n2007 \n2006 \n10,910 \n11,013 \n6,215 \n3,972 \n5,536 \n5,427 \n22,661 \n20,412 \n\nProgram \nDevelopment  \nRehabilitation and Upgrading \nPeriodic and Routine Maintenance\nTotal \n\n2009 \n9,185 \n8,701 \n5,760 \n23,646 \n\n2008 \n10,185 \n7,458 \n5,647 \n23,290 \n\n9,268 \n9,944 \n5,875 \n25,087 \n\n2010 \n\nSource: Road Sector Master Plan, Draft Final Report, August 2005. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. \nFinancing  of  road  improvements  and  rehabilitation  relies  heavily  on  international  and \nbilateral loan and grant funding. Local funding is reserved mainly for counterpart contributions to \nforeign-funded  projects,  particularly  for  land  acquisition  and  property  compensation.  A  small \namount of Government road funding is available for expenditure on capital road works. \n\n5. \nThe  number  of  new  registrations  rose  sharply  in  the  last  3  years.    Motorcycle \nregistrations  in  particular  increased  by  a  factor  of  four  over  that  period.  There  has  also  been \nstrong growth in three-wheel motor tricycles, which are now used throughout the country as taxi \nservices.  Car  registrations  also  increased  rapidly,  but  to  a  lesser  extent.  Traffic  levels  exceed \nthe  design  capacity  of  many  roads.  The  percentage  of  household  expenditure  on  transport \nincreased  by  70%  between  1996  and  2003,  indicating  a  growing  level  of  discretionary \n\n                                                 \n1   Established by the Road Development Authority Act, (No. 73) of 1981. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nexpenditure  among  a  small  but  increasing  proportion  of  the  population.  Private  passenger \ntransport includes bicycles, motor cycles, a small proportion of three- wheelers, cars, vans and \nfour-wheel drive or sports utility vehicles. Public transport at present has the largest share of the \npassenger  market,  and  buses  are  the  cheapest  mode  used  by  the  bulk  of  the  population  for \nlonger  distances.  Three  wheelers  provide  relatively  low  cost  taxi  services,  but  are  more \nexpensive than bus transport.   \n\n6. \nGoods  carriage  is  by  small  tractors  and  trailers,  larger  agricultural  tractors  and  trailers, \nand  conventional  goods  vehicles,  predominantly  two-axle,  either  single-  or  dual  rear-tire  axle.  \nThe  predominance  of  two-axle  vehicles  makes  for  easier  maneuverability  and  passing  on \nnarrow  winding  roads,  but  concentrates  the  load  on  a  single  rear  axle,  which  is  a  factor  in \noverloading.  Surveys  of  axle  loads  indicate  a  high  degree  of  overloading  by  a  proportion  of \nheavy  commercial  vehicles.    Most  freight  transport  is  undertaken  by  two-axle  dual  rear-tired \nvehicles,  and  these  show  the  greatest  overloading,  particularly  in  the  Colombo  area.  For  the \nmost prevalent overweight group (over 8.5 tons carrying capacity), the gross vehicle weight and \nequivalent standard axle load are shown in Table A2.3. \n\nPercentile Loading (%)  Max. \n35.10 \nGross Weight \n96.76 \nESAL \n\nTable A2.3: Distribution of Axle Loads, Six-Wheel Medium Trucks \n90.00 \n19.38 \n8.32 \n\n75.00  50.00 \n16.60  12.89 \n1.47 \n\n10.00  Min. \n6.00  2.29 \n0.06  0.00 \n\n99.00 \n24.80 \n22.94 \n\n25.00 \n8.07 \n0.20 \n\n99.90 \n28.26 \n37.59 \n\n4.45 \n\nMean \n12.73 \n3.24 \n\nESAL = equivalent standard axle load. \nSource: Road Development Authority. \n\nThe structure of taxes, duties, and subsidies shows that road users face costs that differ \n7. \nfrom  the  economic  cost  of  the  components  of  the  transport  services  provided.    High  rates  of \nduty on private passenger vehicle imports are reflected in ownership costs (Table A2.4).  On the \nother hand, fuel price is controlled so the importing companies are not able to pass on their full \ncosts,  although  there  have  been  a number  of  upward  price  revisions  over  the  past  year.    Bus \nfares  are  also  controlled  and  partly  subsidized and  so,  the  price  to  users  is  lower  in  the  short \nrun, than if the price were deregulated.  In the longer run, if operators had more flexibility in fleet \npurchases and management of operating costs, prices would tend to fall. \n \n\nTable A2.4: 2004 Taxes and Duties on Motor Vehicles \n(%) \nCar \n\n4x4 \n\n \n\nItem \n \n Import Duty \n Surcharge  \n Excise \n Port and Airport Levy \nValue Added Tax \n Other \nSource: Ministry of Finance and Planning. \n\nMotorcycle  3-Wheel \nPetrol \n12.00 \n1.20 \n5.44 \n1.00 \n15.00 \n1.00 \n\nPetrol \n12.00 \n1.20 \n6.81 \n1.00 \n15.00 \n1.00 \n\n27.50 \n2.75 \n\nPickup  Truck  Bus \n\nVan \nPetrol  Diesel Diesel  Diesel Diesel  Diesel Diesel \n3.00 \n27.50 \n27.50 \n0.30 \n2.75 \n2.75 \n0.00 \n80.06 \n40.20 \n1.00 \n1.00 \n1.00 \n15.00 \n15.00 \n15.00 \n1.00 \n1.00 \n1.00 \n\n27.50 \n2.75 \n111.48  111.48 \n1.00 \n15.00 \n1.00 \n\n6.00 \n0.60 \n0.00 \n1.00 \n15.00 \n1.00 \n\n27.50 \n2.75 \n80.06 \n1.00 \n15.00 \n1.00 \n\n1.00 \n15.00 \n1.00 \n\nAll  fuel  used  in  Sri  Lanka  is  imported.  Retail  prices  are  controlled  by  the  Government \n8. \nand  vary  only  slightly  as  a  result  of  local  distribution  costs.  In  response  to  international  price \ntrends, prices are currently subject to revision using an agreed upon formula. If the Government \ndoes  not  implement  the  price  changes,  it  is  required  to  pay  a  subsidy  to  the  fuel  suppliers. \nCurrent prices per liter are SLRs80 for 90 octane petrol and SLRs50 for diesel fuel.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nBus  transport  services  are  the  leading  form  of  public  transport  in  Sri  Lanka,  providing \n9. \napproximately  80%  of  road  passenger  transport;  railways  contribute  7%;  and  private  vehicle \nowners account for the remaining 13%. The publicly-owned cluster bus companies (CBCs) have \na 22% share of the total bus transport market, implying high reliance on the private sector for \nprovision  of  bus  transport  services,  i.e.,  78%  private  sector  market  share.  The  CBCs  have  a \nsubstantial financial burden due to the high operating cost per km (SLRs45.63 per operated bus \nkm  by  the  CBCs  compared  with  SLRs36.21  per  km  for  buses  operated  by  the  private  sector) \nand poor targeting of subsidies to CBCs for unprofitable school and rural bus routes. The CBCs \ncurrently  employ  12  persons  per  operated  bus.  They  own  8,400  buses,  of  which  only  4,200 \nremain operational. The total cost of operating a public bus amounted to SLRs80.55 per km or a \ntotal  of  SLRs21.97  billion  in  2004.  The  main  reason  for  the  significant  operating  cost  of  the \nCBCs  can  be  a  combination  of  excess  staff  and  salary  structures.  In  addition,  the  passenger \ntransport sector previously suffered from the lack of a sound policy and regulatory framework, \nincluding infrequent fare increases, which have not allowed service delivery at financially viable \nlevels and led to lack of investment in the sector. The fare structure also led to overcrowding on \nmore  profitable  routes  and  underprovision  on  others,  and  a  general  public  perception  of  low \nservice quality in combination with increasing safety issues and accidents. \n\n10. \nThe  Government  has  outlined  a  detailed  reform  program  to  address  these  substantial \nissues.  Recognizing  that  a  mere  change  from  public  to  private  ownership  will  not  solve  the \nunderlying  issues  impeding  improved  sector  performance,  the  Cabinet  approved  a  strategic \naction  plan  in  April  2005.  The  main thrust  of  the  strategy  is to  depoliticize  transport  regulation \nand  introduce  commercial  principles  in  the  management  of  the  CBCs  by  reestablishing  the \nCentral Transport Board, ensuring objective management appointment procedures, introducing \nefficiency and thus reduce the burden on public finances. One of the main tools applied is the \nintroduction  of  franchising  schemes  formulated  on  the  principle  of  competition  for  the  market \nand  improved  methods  of  procuring  and  managing  the  services  of  private  buses.2 The  action \nplan also aims at reducing the number of persons per operated bus to 4.25 by reducing the total \nemployees from more than 40,000 to 16,000 through a voluntary retirement scheme. \n\n11. \nAnnual  road  fatalities  have  been  increasing  over  the  last  5  years,  both  in  total  and  in \nrelation to population. The number of fatalities increased from 2,023 in 1998 to 2,185 in 2002. \nThe fatalities per 100,000 population slightly increased from 11.28 in 1998 to 11.5 in 2002. MOT \npublished  a  strategic  plan  for  road  safety,  covering  (i)  involvement  and  coordination  of \nstakeholders,  (ii)  constructive  participation  of  media,  (iii)  development  of  leadership  and \nsecuring funding for the safety plan, and (iv) establishing a monitoring and evaluation process. \nThis  overall  strategy  will  be  directed  to  four  target  areas:  (i)  road  infrastructure  safety \nimprovements\u2014removal of hazardous encroachments and obstructions, black spot remediation \non the major arterials in Western Province, and development of safety-related standards within \nRDA;  (ii)  road  users\u2014driver  licensing  and  testing  improvements,  public  awareness  programs, \nvehicle roadworthiness testing, random roadside vehicle checks, and nighttime visibility aids for \npedestrians and cyclists; (iii) traffic law and enforcement\u2014improved enforcement resources and \ntechniques,  a  demerit  point  system,  implementing  existing  provisions  of  the  Motor  Traffic  Act, \nencouraging  seat  belt  wearing;  and  (iv)  road  safety  management\u2014road  safety  committees, \nactivate and staff the National Road Safety Secretariat, implement a pilot project on prehospital \ncare of accident victims, and partnership arrangements with the private sector. \n\n                                                 \n2   In  line  with  the  recommendations  provided  under  ADB  TA  4075  (ADB.  2002.

Revenues accrue from import duties, surcharges, \nlevies  and  value-added  tax  on  inputs  to  road  transport,  on  inputs  to  road  construction  and \nmaintenance, and licensing and registration fees on drivers and vehicles (Table A2.6).

For  maintaining  the  NH  system,  it  is  estimated \nthat  the  annual  requirement  for  2006  is  about  SLRs5.4  billion,  which  will  steadily  increase  to \nSLRs5.9 billion in 2010. The equivalent amounts for provincial roads are about SLRs1.7 billion \nfor 2006 and SLRs3.2 billion for 2010. \n\n17. \nRoad Maintenance Trust Fund. Under the current budget administrative arrangement, \na road maintenance trust fund is being set up, and a special account for it will be established \nwith the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. A board of trustees and a technical advisory committee are \nbeing  established.  Starting  in  FY2006,  the  Government  will  allocate  at  the  rate  of  SLRe1  per \nliter  on  petrol  and  SLRe0.5  per  liter  on  diesel  from  all  sales  except  for  diesel  used  for  power \ngeneration,  for  which  all  receipts  will  be  directly  deposited  to  the  fund.  Additional  budgetary \nallocations for road maintenance currently given directly to implementing agencies will also be \nchanneled through the fund.  \n\n18. \nFor  2006,  the  budget  allocation  for  maintaining  NHs  will  be  increased  to  SLRs3  billion \n(from  SLRs1.9  billion  in  2005).  The  Government  will  gradually  increase  the  resources  of  the \ntrust fund by either increasing the budget allocation or increasing fuel levy or imposing a vehicle \nregistration  fee  or  doing  all  to  ensure  that  100%  of  the  requirements  for  maintaining  the  NH \nnetwork will be met by 2010. The increase will continue thereafter, to ensure that the fund will \ncover  the  increase  in  financing  for  NHs  and  gradually  cover  financing  of  provincial  road \nmaintenance. \n\n19. \nDomestic  Contracting  Industry.  As  registered  through  the  Institute  for  Construction \nTraining and Development and the National Construction Association of Sri Lanka, the domestic \ncontracting  industry  numbers  36  companies  with  the  capacity  to  undertake  contracts  of  more \nthan  $1  million,  with  an  annual  capacity  of  over  $100  million.  The  total  annual  capacity  of  the \nindustry  is  estimated  at  about  $200  million.  Compared  with  the  projected  2005\u20132010 \nexpenditure on roads of around $100 million per annum, the domestic contracting industry, on a \nfinancial  basis,  has  the  capacity  to  undertake  a  substantial  proportion  of  the  proposed  future \nexpenditure. Recognized weaknesses in the industry are (i) a lack of financial capacity and bank \nsupport  to  be  able  to  provide  financial  guarantees  and  insurances  for  contracts,  and  (ii) \nlimitations in the specialist engineering plant.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMain Areas of Reform \n\nReform Interventions \n\nStatus \n\nComment/Further Action To Be Taken \n\nROAD SECTOR POLICY MATRIX UPDATE \n\nA.

The Cabinet approval was granted on 26 October 2005 (as a condition for loan negotiations \nof  the  Project).  A  board  of  trustees  (the  Board)  is  being  appointed  by  the  Secretary  of  the \nTreasury  to  facilitate  the  initial  arrangements  on  the  setting  up  of  the  Fund.  The  Board  will \nconsist  of  the  deputy  secretary  to  the  Treasury  as  Chairman,  secretary  of  the  Ministry  of \nHighways (MOH) or his successor, and the chairman of the Finance Commission. \n\nfreight \n\n \n2. \nThe  Government,  Asian  Development  Bank,  and  the  World  Bank  will  jointly  review  the \nworking of the Fund 3 years after its commencement to evaluate its effectiveness in providing \nsustainable  road  maintenance  financing,  to  examine  ways  of  improving  its  operations,  and, \nwhen  appropriate,  to  bring  forward  legislation  to  establish  a  dedicated  Fund  managed  by  an \nindependent board.  \n \n3. \nPurpose. The purpose of the Fund is to finance routine and periodic road maintenance \nprograms to avoid deterioration of the road network as a well-maintained road network is very \ncrucial in facilitating economic development of Sri Lanka. Initially, the Fund will be allocated for \nthe national road network. Progressively, more resources will be allocated for the Fund so that \nthe full cost of maintaining national and provincial roads will be financed.  \n \n4. \nAdministrative Mechanism. The Fund account will be maintained in the Central Bank, \nand  will  be  managed  by  the  Board.  In  addition  to  the  Board,  a  technical  advisory  committee \n(TAC) will be appointed by the secretary of the Treasury and will consist of representatives from \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Planning  (MOFP),  MOH,  Ministry  of  Provincial  Council  and  Local \nGovernment,  National  Contractor  Association, \nforwarders,  National  Transport \nCommission,  and  academia  and  other  stakeholders  specializing  in  fields  relevant  to  road \ntransport.  The chairman of the TAC will be the secretary of MOH. One officer from MOFP will \nfunction  as  the  Secretary  to  the  Board,  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  administration  of  the \naccount. The Board will recruit additional staff for the secretariat as and when necessary. \n \n5. \nDisbursement.  At  the  start  of  the  year,  eligible  road  agencies  will  submit  to  the \nChairman  of  the  TAC,  through  their  relevant  ministries,  their  proposed  3-year  rollover  and  the \nrelevant annual road maintenance programs. The TAC will scrutinize the proposals and forward \nsuitable  recommendations  to  the  relevant  secretaries  who  had  submitted  these  proposals. \nThereafter, the secretaries will submit to the Fund their requests and their proposals along with \nthe recommendations of the TAC. The Board, after taking into account the recommendations of \nthe TAC, its selection criteria, and the funds available in the account, will approve and announce \nthe  recommended  packages  and/or  programs  selected  for  financing  within  the  first  quarter  of \nthe  year.  This  arrangement  will  enable  all  stakeholders  and  the  public  to  be  informed  of  the \nprogram  and  to  demand  action  if  no  or  poor  progress  is  made.  After  approval,  the  Board  will \nauthorize the disbursement of the funds to the concerned agency, which will supervise and/or \nimplement the maintenance program. The Board will use its powers on financial and technical \naudits to check, on a sample basis, that programs funded are actually implemented. \n \n6. \nSelection  Criteria. The selection will be largely based on highway development model \n(HDM-4) prioritization or similar accepted international criteria in preparing annual maintenance \nplans.  Packages  proposed  should  fit  in  with  the  need-based  prioritization  of  the  entity\u2019s  entire \nannual maintenance program. \n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nFinancing Arrangements \n\nAccountability  Mechanism. All operations of the Fund will be made public in the form \n7. \nof  annual  reports  and  the  accounts  audited  by  the  auditor  general.  Technical  audits  will  be \ncarried  out  every  6  months  by  an  independent  technical  auditing  team  under  TAC  on  sample \ncontracts/programs financed by the account to verify that the disbursements have been used for \nthe  purposes  approved  and  the  works  are  of  the  required  standards  as  specified  in  the \ncontracts/programs. The technical audit reports will be submitted directly to the Board. \n \nB. \n \n8. \nStarting  in  FY2006,  all  budgetary  allocations  earmarked  for  road  maintenance  will  be \ndeposited to the Fund, including budgetary allocations currently given directly to implementing \nagencies. \n \n9. \nFinancing  Requirement.  A  continuing  flow  of  funding  for  road  maintenance  at  a  level \nthat  optimizes  total  road  system  costs  is  paramount  for  efficient  management  of  the  road \nnetwork.  Assuming  that  all  road  networks  will  be  in  maintainable  condition  within  the  next  12 \nyears, it is estimated that for national roads the annual requirement for 2006 is about SLRs5.4 \nbillion, which will steadily increase to SLRs5.9 billion in 2010.  \n \n10. \nRevenues.  For  2006,  the  Government  agreed  to  increase  the  budget  allocation  for \nmaintaining national highways to SLRs3 billion (from SLRs1.9 billion in 2005). In addition to the \nannual  allocation,  the  Government  will  earmark  at  the  rate  of  SLR1  for  each  liter  petrol  and \nSLRe0.5 for each liter of diesel (excluding diesel used for power generation) from the petroleum \nrevenues  in  2006  to  the  Fund  for  this  purpose.  The  estimated  petrol  consumption  for  road \ntransport  vehicles  is  750  million  liters  in  2006  and  1,100  million  liters  in  2010.  The  equivalent \namounts  for  diesel  are  2.36  billion  and  2.68  billion,  respectively.  The  Government  agreed  to \ngradually increase the resources by increasing budget allocation and/or increasing the fuel levy \nor  imposing  an  additional  vehicle  registration  fee  to  ensure  that  100%  of  the  requirements  for \nmaintaining the national road network will be met by 2010. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n41 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ROAD SUBSECTOR, 1995\u20132004 \n\nSource of \nFunds \n\n \n\nProject \n\nLoan/Grant \n(Currency)  \n\nAmount \n(million) \n\nExpected \nCompletion \n\nADB \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nJapan \n \n \n \n\n \n\nSouthern Provincial Roads Improvement \nRoad Network Improvement \nSouthern Transport Development \nRoad Sector Development Project \nConflict Affected Areas Rehabilitation Project \u2013 Road \n\nFlood Damage Repairs \nTsunami Affected Areas Rehabilitation Project \u2013 Road \n\nComponent \n\nComponent \n\nBaseline Roads III \nRoad Network Improvement \nSouthern Transport Development \nOuter Circular Highway Project \nPost Tsunami Rehabilitation Project \n\nWorld Bank \n \nKorea \n \nKuwait \nSaudi \n\nPost Tsunami Rehabilitation Project \n \nRehabilitation of Balangoda - Beragala \u2013 Bandarawela \nRoad  \nBridges Reconstruction and Rehabilitation \nKinniya Bridge & Batticoloa \u2013 Trincomalee \nPost Tsunami Rehabilitation Project \n\nNDF  \nSweden \nFrench \nEurope \nUSAID \nSpain \n\nSouthern Transport Development \nSouthern Transport Development \nPost Tsunami Rehabilitation Project \nPost Tsunami Rehabilitation Project \nPost Tsunami Rehabilitation Project \nPost Tsunami Rehabilitation Project \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n\nADB \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSouthern Provincial Roads Improvement \nContract Award Procedures \nSouthern Transport Corridor \nSecond Provincial Roads Improvement \nRe-engineering of Road Sector Institution \nPreparation of STDP \nRoad Maintenance Budgeting and Expenditure Control \nTransport Sector Capacity Building \nPreparing the National Highway Development Project \nRoad Sector Master Plan \nRoad Project Preparatory Facility \n\nLoan ($) \nLoan ($) \nLoan ($) \nLoan ($) \nLoan ($) \n \nLoan ($) \nLoan ($) \nGrant ($) \n\nLoan ($) \nLoan ($) \nLoan ($) \nLoan ($) \nLoan ($) \nGrant ($) \n\nLoan ($) \nGrant ($) \nLoan ($) \n\n \n\nLoan (KWD) \nLoan (riyal) \nGrant ($) \nLoan ($) \nGrant ($) \nLoan ($) \nGrant ($) \nGrant ($) \nLoan ($) \n\nGrant ($) \nGrant ($) \nGrant ($) \nGrant ($) \nGrant ($) \nGrant ($) \nGrant ($) \nGrant ($) \nGrant ($) \nGrant ($) \nLoan ($) \n\nLoan (yen) \nGrant ($) \nGrant ($) \nGrant ($) \nLoan ($) \n\n30.0 \n80.0 \n90.0 \n56.5 \n70.0 \n \n11.0 \n11.6 \n73.1 \n\n46.0 \n35.5 \n103.1 \n170.0 \n57.3 \n14.0 \n\n34.3 \n8.0 \n17.6 \n \n1.8 \n40.0 \n12.6 \n6.7 \n1.0 \n41.0 \n52.1 \n6.1 \n8.5 \n\n0.600 \n0.100 \n1.000 \n1.000 \n0.640 \n0.150 \n0.150 \n0.056 \n0.80 \n1.0 \n15.0 \n\n381 \n0.300 \n0.540 \n0.547 \n0.570 \n\nLoan/Grant \n(Currency)  \n\nAmount \n(million) \n\nCompleted \n2005 \n2010 \n2008 \n2007 \n \n2005 \n2008 \n \n\n2005 \n2006 \n2010 \n2007 \n2006 \n \n\n2007 \n \n2008 \n \n2007 \n2008 \n2007 \n2007 \n2007 \n2008 \n2008 \n2008 \n2007 \n\nPeriod \n\n1995/96 \n1995/96 \n1997/98 \n1997/98 \n1999/00 \n1999/00 \n2001/02 \n2001 \n2002/05 \n2004/05 \n2004/07 \n\n1999/00 \n2000/01 \n1995/96 \n2000/01 \n1995/96 \n\n \n\nJapan \nSweden \nUNDP \n\nEngineering Services for the Southern Highway \nColombo \u2013 Kandy Expressway \nTransport Sector Strategy Study \nMid Country Rural Roads Network \nTransport Sector Strategy Study \n\nWorld Bank \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  KWD  =  Kuwait  dollar,  NDF  =  Nordic  Development  Funds,  STDP  =  Southern  Transport \nDevelopment  Project,  UNDP  =  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  USAID  =  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment, $ = United States dollar. \nSource: Road Development Authority, Government of Sri Lanka. \n\n\fSubject\n\nActivity\n\nSchedule\n\nRDA: MEDIUM-TERM INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING FRAMEWORK\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\nOrganizational\nStructure\n\na.

The design criteria adopted are generally in accordance \n1. \nwith  the  standards  in  use  by  the  Road  Development  Authority  (RDA),  and  include  the  Geometric \nDesign  Standards  of  Roads  1998,  and  Guide  to  the  Structural  Design  of  Roads  under  Sri  Lankan \nConditions 1999. RDA has generally based its geometric, pavement, and traffic design standards on \nAustralian (AustRoads/NAASRA) practice and standards which, in turn, use standards derived from \nthe  Federal  Highway  Administration\u2019s  Highway  Capacity  Manual.  The  pavement  design  standards \nused  by  RDA  are  based  partly  on  Transport  Research  Laboratory\u2019s  Overseas  Road  Note  31, \nincluding the design chart approach to specifying pavement layer design in relation to design of axle \nloads.  RDA  uses  United  Kingdom  design  standards  in  bridge  design.  Road  safety  audits  are  built \ninto the engineering designs and followed through during the construction period in accordance with \nthe Asian Development Bank\u2019s Road Safety Toolkit. In densely populated areas, the roads and their \nassociated  sidewalks  are  made  accessible  to  all  including  the  disabled  people  in  accordance  with \nthe Department for International Development\u2019s Overseas Road Note No. 21 Enhancing the Mobility \nof Disabled People: Guidelines for practitioners. \n\n2. \nPavement  Treatment.  The  existing  pavement  is  generally old  penetration  macadam,  often \nover an earlier hand-laid stone base, with some later surface treatment applications, typically sand \nseals.  Existing  carriageway  width  is  typically  4.5  m  to  6.0  meters  (m)  with  up  to  1.0  m  of  earth \nshoulder.  There are some narrower sections, where steep mountainous and rocky terrain constrains \nthe alignment, and some wider sections, typically at the approach to larger villages and towns. The \nexisting pavement thickness varies and has been found to be generally thicker and more intact over \nthe central part of the road and thinner and more broken at the edges. On some hill sections, poor \nside  drainage  has  led  to  scour  along  the  pavement  edge.  While  there  are  extensive  areas  of \npavement that require reconstruction, there are also sections where the existing pavement can form \na base to the improved road. \n\n3. \nThe pavement design for reconstructed and widened sections is by way of RDA\u2019s pavement \nstructural  catalogue,  which  provides  layered  designs  for  combinations  of  subgrade  strength  and \ndesign axle load. A 10-year design period has been used which could be extended to 15\u201320 years \nwith proper maintenance and axle load control. The pavement type will be asphalt concrete (AC) for \nhigher  loads  or  double  bituminous  surface  treatment  (DBST)  for  lower  design  axle  loads.  For \npavements constructed over existing surfaces, the TRL method for overlay design has been used, \ngenerally without any expectation of residual pavement life from the old pavement. Where existing \npavement  is  to  be  overlaid  but  AC  is  not  warranted,  then  a  regulating  and  strengthening  layer  of \nbitumen-bound base and DBST is proposed. \n\nCross  Section.  All  roads  are  to  be  designed  as  two-lane.  In  one  case,  for  the  termination \n4. \npoint  of  the  South  Highway,  provision  for  future  widening  to  four  lanes  will  be  made  in  land \nacquisition.  Traffic  lane  widths  are  3.5  m  except  for  roads  in  mountainous  terrain  with  low  traffic \nflows, where width is reduced to a minimum of 3.0 m.  Shoulder widths vary from 3.0 m in flat terrain \nto a minimum of 1.0 m in mountainous terrain. Where there is significant cycle traffic and the road \nhas a rural cross section, 2.0 m of the shoulder is proposed to be bituminous seal to act as a cycle \nlane,  of  the  same  construction  as  the  main  carriageway,  and  the  remaining  width  of  shoulder \nconstructed  as  earth  over  a  pervious  drainage  layer.    Additional  widening  of  the  earth  shoulder  is \nproposed for rural sections where there is significant pedestrian and cycle traffic. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n45 \n\nThrough  urban  areas,  the  roads  will  be  curbed  and  2.0  m  wide  paved  footpaths  provided.  \n5. \nWhere  cycle  traffic  is  significant,  2.0  m  cycle  lanes  will  be  provided.  Also,  in  busy  commercial \ncenters, additional 2.4 m width curbside parking and bus stopping lanes will be provided over short \nsections to reduce side friction.  Most roads carry a substantial proportion of bus traffic and indented \nbus bays will be provided at intervals, at locations to be determined in both urban and rural  areas \nduring detailed design. \n\n6. \nAlignment  and  Traffic  Facilities.  Generally,  roads  will  follow  the  existing  horizontal  and \nvertical alignment except where improvements are most required for safety reasons, such as at low-\nspeed horizontal curves and vertical crests with inadequate stopping sight distance, and where the \ncurve geometry is inconsistent with the speed environment of the road section. Curve widening and \nappropriate super elevation will be provided. Over some low-lying sections, the roads will be raised \non embankment to avoid flooding and to improve drainage of the pavement. Specific realignments \nare proposed, or will be considered as alternatives as necessary.  \n\n7. \nWhile widening outside of the existing right-of-way (ROW) has been kept to a minimum, the \nnarrowness of the existing road alignments is such that some land acquisition will be required on all \nroads  if  a  safe  and  efficient  design  solution  is  to  be  achieved.  This  requirement  will  involve \ndemolishing walls and fences, some buildings and, in worst cases, resettlement of businesses and \nresidences fronting the road. Structures established within the ROW will be subject to removal. \n\n8. \nRoad signs and markings will be provided throughout, including edge lines, centerlines and \nreflective  studs,  pedestrian  crossings,  and  advisory  and  warning  traffic  signs.  Guard  railing  will  be \nprovided along the edges of drop-offs. \n\n9. \nDrainage.  As  the  roads  are  to  be  widened,  existing  side  drains  will  be  reformed.  Covered \nand  uncovered  concrete  channel  drains  will  be  used  in  urban  areas,  cut  earth  ditches  through  flat \nrural  terrain,  and  masonry-lined  drains  on  mountainous  sections.  Existing  pipe  and  concrete  slabs \nand  wall  box  culverts  will  either  be  lengthened,  with  reinstatement  of  head  walls  and  inlets,  or \nreconstructed depending on their condition. The Project includes repair, redecking, widening, and in \nsome cases, replacement of highway bridges. \n\nB. \n\nRoad-Specific Improvement Design \n\n10. \nA005: Nuwara Eliya-Badulla (54.8 kilometer [km]). The existing carriageway is 5.5\u20136.0 m \noverall except the central low traffic section between Welimada and Hali Ella, where it is only 3.5\u2013\n4.5 m wide. The proposed widening is 6.0\u20136.5 m, depending on traffic level and terrain, with 1.0\u20131.5 \nm  shoulders.  The  ROW  will  need  to  be  widened  between  1.0  and  2.0  m  on  each  side  with  some \nresettlement impacts. There are 12 bridges requiring repair and widening: 4 are expected to require \nreplacement, and the remainder widening, together with repair and in one case replacement of the \nexisting deck. \n\n11. \nA007:  Hatton-Nuwara  Eliya  (44.8  km).  Realignment  of  short  sections  of  the  road  is \nproposed at Radella to reduce the road gradient, and thus allowing heavy traffic to use the shorter \nroute  taken  by  all  light  traffic  and  reduce  the  route  length  from  44.8  to  37.9  km.  Widening  is \nproposed  from  the  existing  5.5  m  to  6.8  m  traffic  lanes,  with  1.5  m  shoulders  of  which  0.5  m  are \nsealed.  The  pavement  proposed  for  widened  and  reconstructed  sections  is  DBST  over  granular \nbase,  and  DBST  over  a  bituminous  bound  regulating  course  over  sound  sections  of  the  existing \npavement.  There  are  nine  bridges  on  the  shorter  route  via  Radella,  most  short  masonry  arch \nstructures, which would require repair and widening or replacement.   \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nA026:  Udatenna\u2013Mahiyangana  (40.8  km).  A realignment over a 7 km section to avoid 17 \n12. \nhairpin bends is considered and will be subject to more detailed site investigation and survey during \ndetailed design. The existing carriageway, generally between 4.0 and 4.5 m wide, will be widened to \n6.5  m  with  1.25  m  shoulders  as  far  as  the  town  of  Hasalaka  at  the  base  of  the  hill  country.  No \nwidening  is  proposed  over  the  final  5  km  to  Mahaweli  Bridge  at  Mahiyangana.    About  30%  of  the \nroad  is  estimated  to  require  complete  reconstruction.  As  necessary,  the  existing  road  will  be \ncorrected, realigned and reconstructed sections constructed in granular base with DBST surfacing. \nThere are 10 bridges, 8 of which require reconstruction, and the 2 others repair and widening. \n\n13. \nB153:  Hikkaduwa\u2013Southern  Highway  (13.3  km).  The  road  will  be  widened  to  2  x  3.5  m \ntraffic  lanes,  2.0  m  cycle  lanes  and  1.5  m  earth  shoulders  for  pedestrians.  Curbside  parking lanes \n2.4  m  wide  will  be  provided  through  Hikkaduwa.  An  800  m  section  of  realignment  across  flat \nagricultural  land  is  proposed  to  connect  B153  to  an  existing  high-level  bridge  over  the  Gin  Ganga \nconnecting to a second 1.75 km section of partly realigned and partly  widened local road south of \nBaddegama town to avoid the existing section of B153 which lies within a flood zone. Considerable \nwidening of the ROW, 4 to 5 m each side, will be required. \n\n14. \nB157:  Southern  Highway\u2013Alutgama  (10.5  km).  The  existing  4\u20135  m  wide  road  will  be \nwidened  to  2  x  3.5  m  traffic  lanes  with  2.0  m  cycle  lanes,  and  2.4  m  parking  and  stopping  lanes \nthrough the urban centers of Dharga Town and Alutgama. At the design stage a possible alternative \nroute  for  the  last  1.0  km  through  local  streets  within  Alutgama  will  be  explored  as  a  more  direct \nalternative to the existing road through the commercial center. There will be 1\u20132 m each side ROW \nwidening in rural areas and up to 6 m in urban areas. \n\nB207: Katukurunda\u2013Nagoda (2.7 km). The existing width of 5 to 6 m will be increased to 2 \n15. \nx 3.5 m traffic lanes and 2 m cycle lanes. Widening of the ROW of 2 m per side is required through \nurban to semi-urban development. \n\nA024: Matara\u2013Southern Highway (4.0 km). The existing 5\u20137 m wide road will be widened \n16. \nto an urban cross section of 2 x 3.5 m traffic lanes, 2.0 m cycle lanes, 2.4 m curbside parking lanes \nwithin the commercial center and 2.0 m paved sidewalks. ROW widening between 5 and 8 m each \nside is required and provision for future four lanes will require a further 4 m each side for traffic lanes \nand median. The existing pavement will be overlaid with 125 millimeter AC and the widened sections \nconstructed to AC standard over granular base. \n\n17. \nB409:  Thalgodapitiya-Dombawela  (26.4  km).  The  road  is  4  to  5  m  wide  and  narrows \noccasionally  to  3.5  m  over  difficult  mountainous  sections.  Widening  will  be  to  6  m  with  0.5  m \nshoulders.  The pavement will be partly reconstructed and partly overlaid. \n\n18. \nA012: Puttalam-Anuradhapura (70.0 km). The proposed improvement is to 2 x 3.5 m traffic \nlanes with 1.5 m shoulders, or 2.0 m sealed shoulders where there is significant cycle traffic. Only \nvery  limited  widening  to  the  ROW  will  be  required.  The  proposed  pavement  design  is  DBST  over \ngranular  base  for  reconstructed  and  widened  sections  and,  where  the  existing  pavement  is \nsufficiently sound, a bituminous bound regulating/strengthening course and DBST. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n47 \n\nLAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT SUBCOMPONENT \n \n\n1. \nPart  of  the  loan,  a  maximum  of  $47.5  million  equivalent,  will  be  utilized  to  finance  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR)  expenditures  required  for  upgrading  (i)  A001:  Kiribathgoda\u2013\nNittambuwa  (25.5  kilometers  [km]),  (ii)  A004:  Kirulapone\u2013Godagama  (19.7  km),  (iii)  B084: \nPamankanda Bridge\u2013Horana (27.6 km), and B435: Orugadawatta\u2013Ambatale (7.7 km). The scope of \nLAR will vary from road to road depending on the need to widen beyond the existing right-of-way or \navailable  government  land.  The  eligible  expenditures  include  (i)  costs  of  land,  structure,  and  other \nassets affected by the Project at replacement cost; (ii) land required for relocation and rehabilitation \nof  affected  households;  (iii)  land  required  for  provision  of  resettlement  sites;  and  (iii)  resettlement \nbenefits  and  income  restoration  assistance  for  affected  households.  An  assessment  has  been \ncarried out on (i) the productivity of land purchase under the Project; (ii) land market conditions, (iii) \nchanneling  of  money,  (iv)  risks  related  to  transactions,  and  (v)  monitoring  and  evaluation \narrangements. \n \nA. \n\nProductivity of Land Purchase \n\n \n\n2. \nThe Project requires land strips along the roads to improve the level of service of the roads \nthrough, which will ease the traffic congestion. The benefits include reduced travel time, increased \nroad  capacity  to  accommodate  more  traffic,  vehicle  operating  cost  savings,  and  improved  access. \nAs  demonstrated  in  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  road  upgrading,  the  economic  benefit \nexceeds the opportunity cost of the current use of the land.  \n\nB. \n\nLand Market Conditions  \n\n3. \nIn  Sri  Lanka,  there  is  no  constraint  on  people  to  sell  and  buy  land  or  property,  as  price  is \ndetermined purely by the market. Land purchases for public purposes, such as for roads, reflect the \nmarket mechanism. No distortion is foreseen. \n\n4. \nUnder  the  Project,  compensation  will  be  paid  at  replacement  value.  Since  the  Project  has \nbeen  announced  to  the  public  and  the  affected  people  have  been  informed,  the  land  value  is \nexpected to increase slightly. In addition, since the Project will also provide relevant payment to non-\ntitled landholders and encroachers, some speculators may take the opportunity by encroaching on \nthe roads.  \n\n5. \nTechnical assistance is attached to the Project to establish a LAR management information \nsystem  (MIS).  Starting  from  the  detailed  measurement  surveys,  all  current  information,  including \npictures,  about  the  assets  and  the  affected  people  will  be  carefully  documented  to  avoid  any \nspeculation  in  the  land  market.  Valuation  of  losses  will  be  determined  by  the  chief  valuer  of  the \nValuation  Department  in  an  objective  and  transparent  manner,  adopting  an  established  procedure \nfor  acquiring  and  compensating  for  land\u2014acceptable  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\u2014that \nwill be disseminated to the affected people through workshops. Only bona fide values will be taken \ninto account. \n\nC. \n\nAdministrative Arrangement for Channeling Fund \n \n6. \nThe Road Development Authority (RDA) will prepare and submit an annual budget for LAR. \nAfter  the  determination  of  compensation  by  the  Valuation  Department,  divisional  secretaries, \nassisted by acquiring officers, will submit a list of affected people in their respective areas and the \nrequired compensation payment. RDA will release a check for every list to the respective divisional \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nsecretary,  who  will  issue  individual  payments  through  government  checks  in  the  name  of  every \naffected person.  \n\n7. \nLoan  disbursement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and \nDisbursement Guidelines for Disbursement Operations, LIBOR-Based Loan Products, as amended \nfrom time to time. An imprest account will be established at the Central Bank under the Ministry of \nHighways,  with  an  initial  advance  equivalent  to  the  estimated  LAR  expenditures  for  the  next  6 \nmonths, or 10% of the loan amount allocated for the LAR component (about $4.5 million), whichever \nis  lower.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook  (2001). Statement of expenditure procedures will be used to \nreimburse, liquidate, or replenish the imprest account for any individual payments not exceeding the \nequivalent of $300,000. \n\nD. \n\nRisks \n\n8. \nThe risk of delayed payment will be minimized by providing the imprest account, and by the \nrequirement that the divisional secretaries make one-time payment of the replacement value of the \nland purchase expeditiously within the statutory framework, but in any event no later than 3 months \nafter  valuation  has  been  established.  Each  divisional  secretary  will  be  assisted  by  2\u20133  acquiring \nofficers. \n \n9. \nThe  risk  of  fraud  and  corruption  will  be  minimized  by  establishing  an  objective  and \ntransparent  valuation,  well-documented  detailed  measurement  surveys,  and  proper  MIS.  LAR  and \nfinancial  audits  will  be  conducted  twice  a  year.  Should  the  auditor  find  any  irregularity  on  any \nparticular road section, ADB will suspend the payment of LAR expenditures on that particular section \nuntil  the  matter  has  been  settled  by  the  relevant  authority.  Any  cost  implication  due  to  such \nsuspension will be borne by the Government.  \n\nE. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n10. \nThe implementation of LAR including the payments will be monitored internally and externally. \nInternally,  RDA  through  its  Environmental  and  Social  Division  (ESD)  and  the  Project  management \nteam will coordinate and monitor the implementation of LAR. Nongovernment organizations will be \nrecruited under the project team to assist in site monitoring. Information on the transaction of each \naffected  person  (titleholder  and  nontitleholders)  will  be  recorded  through  the  MIS.  The  MIS  will \nrecord  information  related  to  (i)  detailed  measurement  of  lost  assets  conducted  by  the  survey \ndepartment;  (ii)  compensation  valuation  for  lost  assets  by  the  valuation  department;  (iii) \ncompensation/assistance amounts for other entitlements as described in the entitlement matrix; and \n(iv)  check  numbers,  date  and  amount  of  disbursement,  payment  receipt  number  and  detailed \nbreakdown of payments for each and every type of loss or entitlement. ESD will maintain and update \nthe records throughout the project implementation period and prepare quarterly progress reports to \nbe submitted to ADB.  \n\n11. \nFor  external  monitoring,  RDA  will  engage  an  external  agency  or  expert  who  will  be \nresponsible for conducting a monitoring of the LAR implementation under the Project, who will report \nto ADB and RDA on a quarterly basis and will also carry out midterm and end of term evaluation.  \n\n12. \nIn addition, the Project will engage an independent financial and technical expert or agency \nwho will undertake an audit every 6 months. Such audit will include a review of LAR compensation, \nprocedures and processes. The audit report will be submitted to both RDA and ADB.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n49 \n\nPERFORMANCE-BASED MAINTENANCE SUBCOMPONENT \n \n\nA. \n\nConcept \n\n \n\nPerformance-based  maintenance  (PBM)  will  be  carried  out  through  4\u20136  contracts  between \n1. \nRoad Development Authority (RDA) and private contractors and/or road maintenance groups formed \nfrom the casual labor in the relevant executive engineer divisions. The contractors will maintain the \nroad to achieve specified condition standards for 4 years in return for a fixed payment stream, with \npossible contract extension subject to the contractors\u2019 satisfactory performance. The contractors will \nbe  responsible  for  maintaining  the  road  at  performance  standards  agreed  upon  in  their  respective \ncontracts.  These  standards  will  be  defined  with  the  aim  of  minimizing  the  long-term  cost  of \npreserving the road, as well as the cost to the road user. For pilot purposes, 50% of the contracts \nwill  be  procured  in  a  competitive  manner,  and  the  rest  will  be  directly  negotiated  with  small \ncontractors (road maintenance group) transformed by the Project from the existing casual labor.  \n \n2. \n \n\nExamples of performance standards are in Table A13. \n\nTable A13: Performance Standards \n\nAsset Class \n\nComponent \n\nPerformance Standard \n\nPavement \n\nPotholes \nRoughness (asphalt) \nRoughness (bituminous treatment) \nRutting \nCracks \n\nNo potholes \nIRI<2.0 (Argentina), IRI<2.8 (Uruguay) \nIRI<2.9 (Argentina), IRI<3.4 (Uruguay) \n<12 mm (Argentina), <10 mm (Uruguay) \nSealed \n\nShoulder \n\nPotholes \nCracks \nJoints with Pavement \n\nNo potholes \nSealed \nVertical alignment<1 cm (Chile, Uruguay), sealed (Peru) \n\nDrainage \nSystem \n\nObstruction \nStructure \n\nRoad Signs \nand Markings \n\nRoad Signs and Markings \nVisibility \n\nNo obstructions.

The 21st World Road Congress, Kuala Lumpur, 3\u20139 October 1999. \n \nfor \n3. \nnoncompliance, will be developed. Inspectors may be hired to inspect the road and regularly make \nrandom  checks  to  verify  compliance.  A  well-documented  inventory  of  the  road,  as  well  as  daily \nrecords of activities undertaken by the contractor, will help understand the specific characteristics of \nthe roads and contribute to better preventive  maintenance. Road users will be encouraged to play \nan  important  role  in  monitoring  performance  by  reporting  road  deficiencies  to  the  road  agency.  A \npercentage of noncompliance will be calculated based on a formula incorporated in the contract, by \nwhich penalties are applied. Detailed development will be set out clearly in the contract documents, \nspecifying the responsibilities of the contractor and RDA. The contracts will cover road maintenance \nvalued at about $8.0 million value in aggregate.  \n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\n \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nTerms of Reference \n\nThe proposed works will be limited to preventive works, catch-up routine maintenance, and \n4. \nperformance  maintenance.  Preventive  maintenance  is  designed  to  improve  the  roads'  structural \ncondition.  Catch-up  routine  maintenance  is  designed  to  reduce  the  present  maintenance  backlog, \nparticularly  for  shoulders  and  drainage.  Some  minor  improvements  may  be  included  such  as \nadditional drainage structures, slope protection, guardrails, road signs, markings, and reconstruction \nof  short  sections.  After  preventive  and  catch-up  routine  maintenance  are  completed,  performance \nmaintenance  (routine  and  recurrent)1 will  begin.  The  proposed  works  will  not  adversely  affect  the \nenvironment and will include mitigating measures where environmental impacts are anticipated. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nOne international and one domestic consultant will be engaged to develop the program, train \nRDA officials, assist with contract award, and supervise the works in the first year of implementation. \nFor the subsequent years, RDA will supervise and monitor the works and the consultant will monitor \nand  evaluate  implementation  annually,  including  lessons  learned  and  recommendations  for \nreplication. A midterm review will be conducted, and necessary improvement of the arrangement will \nbe made. The consultant will then assist RDA in preparing a longer and larger PBM to be proposed \nto the Sri Lankan Road Maintenance Trust Fund for financing. \n \n6. \nConsultant inputs will consist of 12 person-months (8 + 2 + 2) international and 15 person-\nmonths (9 + 3 + 3) domestic. The assignment will be for 4 years. The consultants, with expertise in \nPBM, will be recruited on an individual basis. Their tasks will be, but are not limited to, the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n\nTogether  with  RDA\u2019s  Maintenance  Division,  select  districts  and  road  sections \nwithin the districts to be maintained. \nSurvey  the  selected  roads  and  propose  preventive  maintenance  to  improve  the \nroads'  structural  condition,  and  catch-up  routine  maintenance  to  reduce  the \npresent maintenance backlog. \nEstablish a performance indicator standard for the selected roads. \nPrepare a basic design indicating the minimum standard to apply. \nQuantify  the  volume  of  required  preventive  and  catch-up  routine  maintenance \nworks for the whole contract period (4 years). \nPropose contract packages and produce works cost estimates for each contract. \nAssist the subject district casual labor to transform itself into a small contractor with \nsimple but proper administration to execute the PBM contract. \n\n(viii)  Produce  two  contract  documentations  suitable  for  PBM  to  be  implemented:  one \nthrough  local  competitive  bidding,  and  the  other  through  direct  negotiations  with \nthe newly transformed small contractors. \nAssist RDA in procurement. \nPrepare  a  contract  management  system,  supervise  its  implementation,  and  train \nRDA staff to supervise the works.  \nSubmit  reports,  including  (a)  an  inception  report,  (b)  a  monthly  progress  report \nduring the first year, (c) annual reports, and (d) a project completion report. \n\n(ix) \n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n                                                 \n1  Routine  maintenance,  such  as  cleaning  drainage  and  cutting  grass,  is  required  continuously  on  every  road  to  prevent \nroad condition degradation. Recurrent maintenance, such as repairing potholes, grading, patching, trimming, filling, and \nresealing cracks, is required at intervals within a fiscal year depending on the volume of traffic using the road, to keep the \npavement in good condition. Emergency maintenance is required to deal with emergency situations such as landslides, \nerosions, floods, etc. Periodic maintenance, such as regraveling and surfacing, is required at intervals of several years to \nrejuvenate the pavement. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n51 \n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n\n($ million)\n\nForeign\n\nLocal\n\nTotal\n\nADB \n\nFX\n\nGovernment\n\nLC\n\nFX\n\nLC\n\nItem\n\nA.

An  efficient  road  network  linking  villages, \ntowns,  and  cities  will  provide  stronger  linkages  between  remote  and  poor  regions  and  more  developed  markets. \nRoad  development  encourages  other  development  initiatives,  which  together  considerably  stimulate  economic \ngrowth. It is expected to significantly improve the socioeconomic situation and enhance poverty reduction.  \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                Poverty Classification:  General intervention \n \nThe Project covers widening and improvement of approximately 270 kilometers (km) of the road network comprising \nnine  road  sections  traversing  both  rural  and  urban  districts  in  seven  provinces,  namely,  Central,  North  Central, \nSouthern, Uva, Western, Sabaragamuwa, and Northwestern.  Central Province, where a large number of tea estates \nand small tea producers are located, has the largest number of towns and villages covered under the Project. The \npoverty  levels  in  these  districts  vary  considerably.  Colombo  in  Western  Province  has  the  lowest  at  5%  and \nMonaragala  and  Badulla  in  Uva  Province  the  highest  at  32%.  The  poverty  levels  in  Kegalle  district  of \nSabaragamuwa  is  nearly  30%  with  Hambantota  district  of  Southern  Province  at  27%.  Similarly,  poverty  levels  are \nhigh in Matara district of Southern province and Matale district of Central Province at 24%. The estimated monthly \nincome of those living below the poverty level (BPL) is SLRs1,423 (less than $15) in each district. The project areas \nare  predominantly  rural  and  pass  through  approximately  300  villages  and  97  towns  including  3  urban  centers. \nLimited access of the rural and urban poor to socioeconomic services is one of the major causes of poverty in the \nproject area. In terms of health indicators, Nuwara Eliya district of Central Province, which has a high proportion of \nworkers  living  on  tea  plantations,  has  high  rates  of  maternal  deaths  (0.7  per  1,000  live  births)  and  infant  mortality \nrates  (20.7),  followed  by  Anuradhapura  (North  Central)  at  22.5  and  Badulla  district  (Uva)  at  20.9,  with  its  rural \npopulation depending on subsistence agriculture. In terms of educational facilities, the project districts had fair share \nof primary schools, however, secondary schools were understaffed due to transport limitations or difficult to access.  \n \nSocial assessment carried out in the sample roads passing through Central and Uva provinces revealed that nearly \n49% of the sample households lived BPL1 while for Western Province, the figure was 29%. With regard to education \nlevels,  about  62%  of  the  sample  households  in  Central,  Uva,  and  Western  provinces  had  attended  only  primary \nschools. In the sample households in Central Province and Uva, male household heads were better educated than \nfemale  household  heads.  No  difference  in  educational  attainment  of  male  and  female  household  heads  was \nobserved in Western Province. Nearly 75% of sample households in Central and Uva and 59% in Western provinces \nwere salaried or earned daily wages. Among these households, heads of households were 69\u201380% male and only \none third were female. The survey also identified 20\u201327% households where women were the main income earner. \nMen were predominantly engaged in agriculture, trade, government service, and private jobs. Women were mostly \ninto agriculture and trade and worked in the garment industries. It was observed that most people living BPL were \nengaged in agriculture, where wage laborers were in small trade or businesses. \n \nThe poverty impact ratio was 0.39, which was estimated by determining how much of the benefits to each class of \nuser  in  the  distribution  analysis  are  passed  on  to  the  poor.  Community  participation  through  key  respondent \ninterviews and focus group discussions in the project areas highlighted several major perceived project benefits: \n(i)  Reduction  of  travel  time:  Better  roads  will  improve  the  economic  productivity  of  people  in  public  and  private \nenterprises, including teachers, medical staff, and government employees.  \n(ii) Increased access to quality health service:  Better roads will facilitate faster and convenient travel by women, \nespecially pregnant mothers, and children and the elderly to access quality health services.  Communities may also \nbenefit from increased availability of medical and educational staff in more remote villages due to ease of travel. \n(iii)  Improved  access  to  educational  facilities:    A  number  of  villages  are  without  local  schools;  hence  children \nattending school in nearby villages or in the closest town center rely mostly on public bus for transport. The Project \nwill increase the regularity of the bus trips to the villages and help children reach school on time.  \n\n                                                 \n\n1  This  includes  households  living  below  the  food  poverty  line  (SLRs1,041/person/month)  and  those  between  the  food \npoverty line and the upper limit of the nonfood poverty line (i.e., SLRs1,042 to 1,690/person/month). The food poverty line \nrepresents the threshold for the very poor, i.e., those who can only afford to buy food. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 19 \n\n61 \n\n(iv) Improved access to markets.  Better roads facilitate reliable, faster, and cheaper transportation of agricultural \nproduce  for  better  prices  in  town  and  urban  markets.    This  benefit  will  accrue  to  farmers  who  rely  primarily  on \nagriculture for income.  Road widening is expected to provide income opportunities for local communities to set up \nroadside stalls to sell their produce, minimizing the need to travel to town centers and thus saving on transport cost.  \n(v)  Improved  access  to  labor  markets.    Increase  in  mobility  enables  the  movement  of  people  in  search  of \nseasonal occupations in- between harvests or during harvest season outside their village.   \n(vi) Road  construction  employment  opportunities.    The communities will have income opportunities during the \nroad construction period.  Enabling employed laborers to purchase additional consumer goods will reduce income. \n(vii)  Improved  quality  of  life.  Road  improvements  will  improve  access  to  basic  services  such  as  health  and \neducation, as well as increased income.   \n(viii)  Improved  safety  for  working  women.    Road  improvements  will  bring  in  safety  components  such  as  road \nlights and footpaths to make roads safer for women, particularly factory workers, coming home at night.  \n(ix)  Reduction  of  vehicle  operating  costs.  Some  traffic  on  the  road  is  freight  traffic,  carrying  mostly  agricultural \nproduce.    Savings  to  the  vehicle  operator  through  operating  cost  reduction  and  fuel  savings  will  be  passed  on  to \nindividual farmers in the form of lower transport charges.    \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n  No \n  No \n\n  Yes \n  Yes \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nIs there a participation strategy? \nConsultations and discussions with project communities were organized to determine people\u2019s views on the Project \nincluding  their  needs,  concerns,  and  priorities  as  well  as  estimates  of  losses  that  they  would  suffer  and  steps  to \nmitigate those losses. A total of 293 key community respondents were interviewed and 81 focus group discussions \nin 27 sample villages were conducted. Discussions were held with men, women, youth, farmers, religious leaders, \nrepresentatives of different ethnic groups, local business people as well as local government officials.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nDuring the social study, gender participation was ensured through gender analysis to determine the possible impact \nof the Project on women. The Project will benefit both men and women  and offer some additional benefits to women \nby increasing their safety, opportunity to find work outside the village due to ease of travel, and access by women, \nespecially pregnant mothers  and girls,  to quality health and educational services in town or urban centers. Focus \ngroup  discussions  indicated  that  women  of  all  economic  levels  in  the  community  support  the  Project.  Concerns, \nhowever, were raised on road widening resulting in loss of homes and livelihood for families living along the road, \nparticularly those without a title to the land, and loss of access to community taps located along the roads during and \nafter construction.  The concerns raised by the women have been integrated into the project design. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone \n\n   No \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n \n\nPlan Required \n\n    Yes \n\nItem \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nResettlement \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n \nAffordability \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\nMost of the improvement works will be carried out within the \nexisting right-of-way, however a large number of households \nwould lose residential and commercial structures, agricultural \nand tea estate land. A considerable number of business activities \nincluding informal and nonregistered businesses will also be \naffected. A range of community property resources, including \npublic land (school land, recreation land, cemetery land, and \ntemple land), bus stops, irrigation channels, temples at several \nlocations will also be affected. \n\nResettlement plans of sample roads were prepared. For non-\nsample roads, resettlement plans will be prepared in accordance \nwith the agreed resettlement framework and entitlement matrix. \n \nRoad improvement will provide improved access to communities \nwithout any cost to them. The Project expects to increase the \nnumber of public transport, and reduce travel cost.   \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n Full \n Short \n None \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 19 \n\n \n \nLabor \n\n \n \nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerability \n \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nRoad improvement will give short-term employment opportunities \nduring the construction phase, which will be implemented in \ncompliance with applicable labor laws. \n \nThe majority of project communities are Singhalese; however, \nthere were communities where the majority was Muslims or \nIndian Tamils.  Tamils live in settlements inside the tea estates, \nwhile the Muslims are found in urban or town areas. The study \nundertaken for project preparation did not indicate differential \nimpacts, either positive or negative, on ethnic minorities and the \ngeneral population. The Project will support equal treatment of all \ngroups, particularly when land acquisition is required for road \nwidening.  \n \nSpecific actions for the minorities are included in the \nResettlement Framework (Supplementary Appendix H). \n \nRoad safety design including safer intersections, street lighting, \nfootpaths, and service roads for local traffic and local business, \nparticularly in densely populated areas, has been integrated into \nthe project design. Roads in densely populated areas and their \nassociated sidewalks will be made available to all, including \ndisabled persons. \n \nNecessary information on HIV/AIDSa and other sexually \ntransmitted diseases will be provided to the construction \nworkers. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\na  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", "  \n", " \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 14 November 2005) \n", "Currency Unit  \nSLRe1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Sri Lanka rupee/s (SLRe/SLRs) \n$0.0098 \nSLRs101.83 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", " \nADB \n \nAP \n \nCBC \n \nCEA \nDBST   \n \nEIA \nEIRR \n \n \nEMP \nESAL   \n \nESC \n \nESD \n \nGM \nHIV/AIDS \n", " \nICB \n \nIEE \n \nJBIC \nLAR \n \nLARC   \nLARSC \nLCB \n \nLIBOR  \nMIS \n \nMOFP   \n \nMOH \n \nMOT \nNH \n \nOPEC   \n \nPBM \n \nPD \nPMU \n \nRCDC   \n \nRDA \nRF \n \nROW   \nRMBEC \nRRP \n \nRSDP   \n \nSEIA \n \nSOE \n \nTA \n \nTAC \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \naffected people \ncluster bus companies \nCentral Environmental Agency \ndouble bituminous surface treatment \nenvironmental impact assessment \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management plan \nequivalent standard axle load \nenvironmental steering committee \nEnvironmental and Social Division \ngeneral manager \nhuman immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency \nsyndrome \ninternational competitive bidding \ninitial environmental examination \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation \nland acquisition and resettlement \nland acquisition and resettlement committee \nland acquisition and resettlement steering committee \nlocal competitive bidding \nLondon interbank offered rate \nmanagement information system \nMinistry of Finance & Planning \nMinistry of Highways \nMinistry of Transport \nnational highway \nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries \nperformance based maintenance \nprovincial director \nproject management unit \nRoad Construction and Development Company \nRoad Development Authority \nresettlement framework \nright of way \nroad maintenance budgeting and expenditure control \nreport and recommendation of the President \nRoad Sector Development Project \nsummary environmental impact assessment \nstatement of expenditures \ntechnical assistance \ntechnical advisory committee \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "terms of reference \nvehicle operating cost \n", "NOTES \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December. \nIn this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \n", " \n \n", "TOR \nVOC \n \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n \n \n \n", " \nVice President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n", " \n", " \nL.
