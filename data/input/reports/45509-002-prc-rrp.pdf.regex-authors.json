I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Chongqing  Urban\u2013Rural  Infrastructure \nDevelopment Demonstration II Project.1 \n \n2.  The  project  aims  to  attain  socially  inclusive  and  economically  balanced  growth  by \nintegrating urban and rural development in Chongqing. The project will selectively enhance the \ndevelopment potential of medium-sized cities, small towns, and villages through (i) an inclusive \nurban water supply system, (ii) urban flood risk management for various-sized rivers, and  \n(iii)  improved  urban\u2013rural  road  connections.  Building  on  the  2010  project  experience,2 the \nproject  will  demonstrate  new  approaches  for  integrated  urban\u2013rural  development  including \nclimate change adaptation, ecologically sound flood protection design, effective management of \ndrinking water quality, and enhanced road safety in seven districts and counties in Chongqing.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Chongqing is one of four centrally administered municipalities in the PRC. It is a part of \nthe less-developed western inland region targeted by the National Strategy for Development of \nthe West, which has contributed significantly to accelerating Chongqing\u2019s economic growth \nsince  2001.  However,  the  economic  benefits  have  been  unevenly  distributed  due  to \nChongqing\u2019s  topographical  characteristics  of  vast  hinterlands,  and  predominantly  hilly  and \nmountainous terrain.4 In Chongqing, a few rapidly developing western central districts coexist \nwith  high-poverty  peripheral  counties  in  the  northeast  and  southeast,  reflecting  wide \ndevelopment gaps.5 Imbalanced socioeconomic development is also evident within districts and \ncounties with urban expansion into rural areas.6 In 2011, the ratio of per capita gross domestic \nproduct of the wealthiest district to the poorest county was 9:1; the ratio of the urban\u2013rural \naverage  income  of  Chongqing  was  3.3:1.  Two  million  rural  residents  still  lived  below  the \ndesignated poverty line of CNY2,300 per annum. \n \n4.  Chongqing is the first PRC provincial demonstration area to pilot urban\u2013rural reforms. \nSince 2008 Chongqing has made continuous efforts to achieve more sustainable and socially \ninclusive development by reversing the trend of widening urban\u2013rural development disparity. \nDuring 2008\u20132011, Chongqing invested CNY48.1 billion in public infrastructure and services to \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for the Chongqing Urban\u2013Rural Infrastructure Development Demonstration Project. \nManila. \n3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided a project preparatory technical assistance, two small grants for \nactivities under two regional technical assistance projects, and a pilot and demonstration activities under the Water \nFinancing Partnership Facility: ADB. 2011.

Manila. \n4  Chongqing\u2019s gross domestic product per capita in 2011 was CNY34,500 (approximately $5,308). \n5  There are 38 districts and counties under the jurisdiction of Chongqing municipality. In 2011, 66% of districts and \ncounties had lower per capita gross national product than the PRC average of $5,433. \n6  Sector Assessment (Summary): Multisector (water supply and sanitation, irrigation, drainage, and flood protection, \nroad transport) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "2 \naddress inequalities. The 2010 project is further strengthening basic infrastructure of small \ntownships and villages in poor northeastern and southeastern regions.7 However, the progress \nof  closing  urban\u2013rural  development  gaps  has  been  very  slow.  Chongqing  still  follows  a \ntraditional centralized urban development pattern with the western central region producing 78% \nof its total gross domestic product and continuing as a major destination for rural migrant \nworkers.8 In Chongqing, no other regional urban center exists along the Yangtze river economic \ncorridor to rebalance its development. Many second- and third-tier cities remain less attractive \nfor investment to support economic activities due to risks of frequent floods and lack of basic \nurban infrastructure. Many of the Chongqing\u2019s remote rural towns and villages are left behind \nfrom its overall development because of the insufficient transport network and access roads. To \nrebalance development, Chongqing must support different levels of cities, towns, and villages to \nenhance its physical connectivity and economic competitiveness. The project will (i) strengthen \nthe  development  potential  of Wanzhou to  become Chongqing\u2019s second  regional center  by \nimproving water supply service and drinking water quality; (ii) enhance flood resilience of county \ncapitals and cities to meet their need to become local economic centers in Rongchang, Wulong, \nand Youyang counties; and (iii) provide better social and economic development opportunities \nby connecting isolated townships and poor villages in Chengkou and Shizhu counties, and \nFuling district.  \n \n5.  Demonstration  features.  The  project  incorporates  lessons  from  the  ongoing  2010 \nproject. The initial selection criteria for project components strongly emphasized supporting key \nregional cities, towns, and  villages.  Accordingly,  to  foster  urban\u2013rural  integration, selection \ncriteria  under  the  current  project  include  (i)  strong  demonstration  impact,  (ii)  geographic \nbalance, and (iii) local project management and financial capacity.  The project will demonstrate \nthe following special features of inclusive and environment\u2013friendly urban\u2013rural development in \nChongqing: (i) climate-proofing design based on a detailed climate change impact assessment \n(for the first time in an ADB project in the PRC); (ii) application of the water safety plan (WSP) \ndeveloped  by  the World  Health  Organization  to  systematically  address  the  risk  of  unsafe \ndrinking water; (iii) adoption of an ecologically sound flood protection design that minimizes soil \nexcavation and retains natural river flows; and (iv) implementation of enhanced road safety and \nengineering designs based on the needs of local residents. The project will directly benefit 25 \ntownships and 173 villages, while indirectly benefiting all districts and counties in Chongqing by \ndemonstrating effective financial support to balance urban\u2013rural development. \n \n6.  Strategic fit and lessons. The project aligns with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, \n2011\u20132015 for the PRC9 and ADB\u2019s water and urban operational plans,10 which emphasize the \nvalue of ensuring inclusive growth, environmentally sustainable growth, flood mitigation, and \ninclusive  water  policy  reforms;  and  enhancing  cities\u2019  competitiveness  through  urban \ndevelopment.  The  project  supports  the  PRC\u2019s  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015,  which \ntargets  rising  income  inequality,  livelihood  improvement,  and  regionally  balanced  and \nenvironmentally sustainable growth to attain the long-term goal of building a harmonious and \nmoderately  prosperous  society.  It  contributes  to  the  PRC\u2019s  achievement  of  Millennium \nDevelopment Goal 7.11 The project design incorporates lessons from the 2010 project and \n                                                \n7  The 2010 project is financing key infrastructure to (i) improve small-scale water supply systems of 72,500 cubic \nmeters per day capacity in selected small cities and townships, and (ii) construct and upgrade 362 kilometers of \nrural roads in eight poor districts and counties. Project implementation is in its second year.  \n8  In 2011, about 5.0 million rural workers (55.2% of total migrant workers) migrated within Chongqing municipality. \nMost relocated from poor counties to the western central districts. \n9  ADB. 2012.

The government has requested a loan of $150.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term including a grace period \nof 6 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate-based lending facility,14 a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The ADB loan will also \nfinance  taxes  and  duties  for  eligible  ADB-financed  expenditures,  and  transportation  and \ninsurance costs included in the base cost for ensuring smooth project implementation. The loan \nwill  finance  49%  of  the  project  cost,  including  civil  works,  equipment  and  materials,  and \ninstitutional strengthening. The government will finance the remaining $157.4 million through \ncounterpart funds from seven project district and county governments (Table 2). \n \n11.  The PRC is the borrower of the loan and will make the loan available through the \nChongqing municipal government (CMG) to the project district and county governments on the \nsame  terms  and  conditions  as  those  of  the  ADB  loan.  The  project  district  and  county \ngovernments will assume the foreign exchange and interest variation risks of the ADB loan. The \nPRC, CMG, and project district and county governments have assured ADB that counterpart \nfunding  will  be  provided  in  a  timely  manner,  including  any  additional  counterpart  funding \nrequired  for  any  shortfall  of  funds  or  cost  overruns.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n13.  The project technical designs are based on locally proven reliable designs, as well as  \nrelevant PRC engineering guidelines and local regulations. Technical feasibility was assessed \nto be adequate after detailed examination of the project\u2019s compatibility with local conditions \nincluding projections of water demand, required level of flood discharge, and function of roads. \nAlternative technical options identified the best alignment of tunnels, roads, and dikes; WTP \nlocation;  water  treatment  systems;  and  sludge  management  in  terms  of  economic  and \nsafeguard aspects. The project will provide training under its capacity development component \nto ensure sustainable O&M of project facilities. Learning from the 2010 project, the project \nmanagement consulting service includes six specialists with total inputs of 122 person-months \nfor rigorous review of technical designs. The demonstration features of the project engineering \ndesign include (i) climate-proofing through a combination of engineering and nonengineering \nmeasures in Youyang and Wulong counties; (ii) ecologically sound river enhancement design by \nretaining natural hydrological features and habitat diversity, minimizing water pollution, and \nimproving public access in Rongchang county; (iii) enhanced monitoring capacity and laboratory \nfacilities to ensure sustainable delivery of safe drinking water based on the WSP in Wanzhou \ndistrict; (iv) enhanced road safety in Fuling district, and Shizhu and Chengkou counties; and  \n(v) upgraded web-based project management and information system to enhance institutional \ncoordination.16  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n14.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was estimated by comparing with- and \nwithout-project  scenarios.  The  analysis  evaluated  technical  options  and  confirmed  that  all \nsubprojects are the least-cost options to support Chongqing\u2019s long-term development plans and \neach district and county master plan. The EIRRs are 15.3% for the overall project, 19.6% for the \nflood management component, 12.3% for the road component, and 13.9% for the water supply \ncomponent; all exceed the economic opportunity cost capital of 12%.17 Quantifiable economic \nbenefits  to  be  generated  by  project  interventions  include  (i)  increased  land  value  and \ndevelopment potential by minimizing flood risks, (ii) savings of vehicle operating costs and time, \n(iii)  income  gained from  year-round  road  access,  and (iv)  improved  water supply services \nmeasured through willingness to pay. Economic costs include capital costs including physical \ncontingencies, and O&M costs. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the overall project EIRR will \ndrop to 13.3% if benefits are reduced by 10%. However, qualitative benefits of improved access \nto  social  services,  and  reduced  economic  activities  from  flood  damage  are  not  included, \nsuggesting that the project\u2019s economic benefits would be higher than the projections. \n \n15.  The financial viability analysis of the revenue-generating Wanzhou Yangliu water supply \nsubproject indicates that the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is 6.1%, which exceeds the \nweighted average cost of capital of 3.7%. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the project is most \nsensitive to decreases in revenue, but the FIRR remains higher than the weighted average cost \nof capital at 4.4%. Water tariffs are expected to increase by 10.0% every 5 years, which is \nconsidered conservative compared with historical tariff revisions in Wanzhou.18 The analysis \nconcluded  that  low-income  urban  households  will  be  able  to  afford  the  projected  tariff \n                                                \n16 The 2010 project (footnote 2) developed a web-based project information management system to strengthen ADB \nproject management and coordination in Chongqing. The system will be upgraded in the current project. \n17 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 The past tariff increases were 31% (1999\u20132001), 50% (2001\u20132004), and 21% (2004\u20132010). \n ", "7 \nincreases\u2014the share of income expended on water and wastewater will be about 2.6% of a \npoor household\u2019s monthly income. The FIRR drops to 3.1% in the combined cases of (i) a \n10.0% increase in capital costs, (ii) a 10.0% decrease in revenue, and (iii) a 10.0% increase in \noperating costs. The tariff will be closely monitored and policy dialogue will be conducted during \nproject implementation to ensure the subproject\u2019s financial sustainability. \n \n16.  Financial analysis of nonrevenue-generating flood management and road components \nwas carried out to ensure fiscal sustainability during implementation and operation. The fiscal \nimpact on the project district and county governments was assessed by comparing annual \nrevenues from identified financing sources with annual counterpart funds required for (i) capital \nexpenditures during project implementation, and (ii) recurrent costs for subproject O&M and \ndebt  service  during  operation.  The  analysis  indicates  that  all  subprojects  have  sufficient \ncounterpart funds during project implementation and funds for O&M and debt service during \noperation. Annual counterpart funds and interest during construction will range from 0.3% to \n2.0% of projected fiscal revenues during implementation. O&M and debt service will range from \n0.1% to 0.7% of projected revenues in 2019 when principal repayment of the ADB loan will start. \nThis indicates acceptable fiscal risk for the governments for counterpart funds. Training will be \nconducted to strengthen their capacity for public financial management.19  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n17.  CMG and its Project Management Office have successfully managed complex urban \nsector projects funded by ADB and the World Bank. All project districts and counties have \nexperience with projects financed by international financial institutes. Procurement capacity and \nfinancial management assessments conclude that the project district and county governments \nand the project implementing units (PIUs) have adequate capacity for procurement and financial \nmanagement  in  accordance  with  ADB  policies  and  procedures,  and  national  laws  and \nregulations.  The  project  district  and  county  governments  follow  the  domestic  procurement \nprocesses  of the  PRC Tendering  Law  and Chongqing Municipality  Tendering  Regulations. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date), and Accountability Mechanism Policy \n(2012) were explained to and discussed with CMG, the project district and county governments, \nand the PIUs. The project district and county governments and the PIUs are receiving practical \nknowledge support for procurement, financial management, and governance issues from the \ndistricts and counties participating in the 2010 project. Training will be provided to enhance PIU \nfinancial management and internal audit system. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n18.  An estimated 259,903 people will benefit directly from the project. Six of the seven \nproject districts and counties are designated poverty counties with poverty incidence of 14%\u2013\n30%. The average rural poverty rate in villages in project areas is about 10%, with one reaching \n24% (Chengkou). The project\u2019s improvement of resilience to flood events, urban\u2013rural road \nnetworks,  and  access  to  safe  drinking  water  will  contribute  to  more  balanced  social  and \neconomic development by (i) supporting development of key cities and towns in poor counties, \nand (ii) reducing constraints on socioeconomic development in more isolated, poor rural areas. \nThe improved water supply services will provide better public health. The flood management \ncomponent will reduce economic loss for poor urban families from crop damage and attract \nmore investment in county urban centers. Road improvements will increase the incomes of poor \nrural farmers by (i) providing them with better options for marketing their goods, (ii) reducing \n                                                \n19  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \ntransport costs and travel time, and (iii) enabling them to grow cash crops. In addition, the \nproject will have more indirect benefit to overall Chongqing by its demonstration impact and \nreplication potential. A social action plan to ensure inclusive benefits will be monitored by a \nresettlement and social development specialist.20 \n \n19.  Gender benefits. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. Results \nfrom the household survey and focus group discussions indicate that the primary responsibilities \nof  women  involve  all  housekeeping  activities,  care  of  family  members,  and  crop  farming. \nWomen in isolated villages are particularly affected by poor mobility and lack of job opportunity. \nThe project will significantly improve their mobility and access to social services, employment, \nand income opportunities. The project includes a gender action plan (GAP) to help ensure \ntargets and activities such as (i) increased women\u2019s participation in the project, including a \ntarget of at least 30% employment opportunities for women, the poor, and/or ethnic minorities \nduring construction; (ii) women\u2019s participation in gender-sensitive training on public road safety \nand water conservation programs; (iii) sex disaggregated baseline and survey data collection; \nand  (iv)  implementation  and  monitoring  of  the  GAP  indicators.  The  district  and  county \ngovernments with the assistance of the resettlement and social development specialist are \nresponsible for GAP implementation, and reporting on project progress and achievements.21 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n20.  Environment. The project is classified category A for environment. The categorization \nwas  mainly  triggered  by  (i)  earthwork  and  soil  erosion  related  to  road  construction  in \nmountainous terrain; (ii) potential impacts on physical cultural resources in Youyang and Shizhu \ncounties, and municipal nature reserves in Fuling district and Shizhu county; (iii) the safety of \nthe Yangliu WTP operations in Wanzhou district; and (iv) impacts of the river enhancement and \nflood management components in Rongchang, Wulong, and Youyang counties on river ecology \nand downstream areas. The subprojects\u2019 scope, project sites, road alignments, and the design \nof flood control works were adjusted at the feasibility study stage to minimize land acquisition \nand earthwork, and avoid impacts on sensitive areas. An environmental impact assessment \n(EIA) was prepared and posted on the ADB website on 15 August 2012.22 The EIA complies \nwith  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  EIA  concludes  that  anticipated \nenvironmental impacts and risks can be mitigated through implementation of the environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP),  which  defines  mitigation  measures,  monitoring  requirements, \ninstitutional responsibilities, and training and institutional strengthening plans to ensure proper \nenvironmental management throughout project construction and operation. The EMP includes \nspecific safeguard plans addressing the major anticipated impacts, including (i) soil erosion \nprotection plans for each subproject, (ii) a physical cultural resources risk management plan, \nand  (iii)  a  WSP  for  the  Wanzhou  Yangliu  water  supply  plant  subproject.  Environmental \nmanagement  is  supported  by  loan  covenants  and  capacity  development  and  institutional \nstrengthening activities under the project. The project district and county governments disclosed \nrelevant environment information to potentially affected people, and the results and findings of \nthe consultation process were used to modify project design and the EIA. Consultation and \npublic  participation  will  continue  throughout  project  implementation  and  any  environmental \ncomplaints or disputes will be handled in accordance with the grievance redress mechanism \ndefined for the project. \n                                                \n20 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The  \nsocial action plan is included in the PAM. \n21 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n21.  Involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  category  A  for  involuntary \nresettlement.23 Seven  resettlement  plans  prepared  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) were approved by ADB and the project district and county governments, \ndisclosed to the affected persons, and uploaded to the ADB website by 10 April 2013. Overall, \nthe project will affect 3,221 persons, of which 321 will be relocated. The project will permanently \nacquire 2,117 mu of collective and state-owned land, temporary acquire 370 mu of land, and \ndemolish 14,520 square meters (m2) of residential and nonresidential buildings.24 The project \ndistrict and county governments have stated that the funds for involuntary resettlement will be \nmade available on time. Capacity development and institutional strengthening activities will \nsupport  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plans,  which  will  be  monitored  and  evaluated \ninternally and externally. The project district and county governments, and PIUs, which have at \nleast  two  full-time  staff  responsible  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  will  report \nimplementation progress regularly to CMG, which will summarize the progress in the quarterly \nprogress report to ADB. The external monitor will review the progress and general welfare of \naffected persons to assess whether they have fully regained their standard of living. Monitoring \nand evaluation reports will be prepared semiannually during implementation and annually for 2 \nyears  after  resettlement  completion,  and submitted  and  published  on the  ADB  website.  A \ntransparent grievance channel will provide a meaningful consultation mechanism, and trigger \nremedial action defined for the project. \n \n22.  Indigenous peoples. The project is classified category B for the indigenous peoples \nsafeguard. Shizhu and Youyang counties are autonomous ethnic minority counties and are also \ndesignated poverty counties. Two ethnic minority development plans were prepared, approved \nby ADB and the project district and county governments, and disclosed to the affected persons \nby 9 April 2013 to facilitate their participation and inclusion in the project benefits. Both Tujia and \nMiao people in Chongqing are fully integrated, both socially and economically, with the Han \npopulation. Ethnic minority lands to be affected by the project have formal legal titles, and will \nreceive  full  compensation.  The  poverty  and  social  assessment  survey  and  consultations \nconcluded that all beneficiaries, including ethnic minorities, will equally benefit from the project. \nThere will be no adverse impacts other than resettlement impacts on 1,001 ethnic minority \npersons and construction of their new houses. The overall project design includes prioritization \nof ethnic minorities for construction jobs and O&M activities and the use of the local language, \nwhere necessary, in communication and outreach for consultations. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n23.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.25 Risks identified from implementation of the \n2010 project and appropriate mitigation measures are included.  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nHigh debt of some project districts and  (i)  CMG and the PMC will conduct training on financial management to \ncounties may threaten the financial  strengthen creditworthiness of project districts and counties and identify \nsustainability of the project  alternative financing options. \ncomponents causing late provision of  (ii) The PMC will provide training for implementing agency and PIU staff to \ncounterpart funding  avoid delays in disbursement. \nThe PIUs lack an effective  (i)  The PMC will organize seminars on ethical values and provide \nanticorruption strategy or action plan  assistance to establish a public complaint system.  \n                                                \n23  Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24  A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.667 square meters). \n25   Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nand relevant local institutions, hence  (ii)  CMG and the implementing agencies will check performance and \ntransparency and accountability is  remind relevant agencies of the loan covenant for day-to-day operation \nreduced  and communication. \nComplex institutional coordination  (i) The PMC will establish a systematic information collection system, \nchallenges result in lack of information  including upgrade of CMG\u2019s web-based project management and \nsharing and work synchronization, and  information system to regularly track project implementation.  \ndelays in project implementation  (ii) The PMC will monitor project implementation by frequent site inspections \nand regular coordination meetings with CMG, project districts and \ncounties, PIUs, and other related agencies. \nChange in key personnel within CMG  (i) ADB will conduct regular consultations and dialogue with officials from \nand project district and county  the PRC government, CMG, project district and county governments, \ngovernments affect project progress  and local beneficiaries to ensure continuous project support. \nand continuity  (ii)  CMG and project district and county governments keep detailed project \nrecords to maintain good institutional documentation. \nDelay in land acquisition and  (i) Project districts and counties will make compensation funds for affected \nresettlement approvals and  persons available early.  \nimplementation  (ii) CMG will transfer experience and knowledge from the 2010 project \ndistricts and counties to ongoing ADB-financed projects. \nTownship O&M units of Youyang  (i)  The PMC will support the Youyang county government to establish \ncounty lack knowledge to ensure  township O&M units for flood dikes and associated facilities. \nsustainable operation of the flood  (ii) The PMC will conduct capacity building to ensure assigned government \ndikes and associated facilities  bureaus and newly established PIU acquire up-to-date knowledge on \nlong-term dike O&M skills. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CMG = Chongqing municipal government, O&M = operations and maintenance, \nPIU = project implementing unit, PMC = project management consultant, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES  \n \n24.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the project \nadministration manual and loan documents. The government has agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan and project agreements. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n25.
