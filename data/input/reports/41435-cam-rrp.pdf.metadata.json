An initial environmental examination was undertaken \nand  an  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  was \nprepared. \n \nThe Tonle Sap Poverty Reduction and Smallholder Development \nProject  will \nthrough \ninvestments  in  productivity  improvement,  rural  infrastructure,  and \ncapacity  development  in  196  communes  in  the  provinces  of \nBanteay Meanchey, Kampong Cham, Kampong Thom, and Siem \nReap.  The  Project  will assist  the  Government  in  creating  (i)  rural \ninfrastructure  to  improve  agricultural  production,  market  access, \nand quality of life in rural communities; (ii) stronger rural financial \nservices  extended  to  resource-poor  smallholder  farmers;  (iii) \nbetter agricultural support services, including research, extension, \nand information delivery services to support increased agricultural \nproductivity  by  smallholder  farmers;  (iv)  appropriate  policies  and \nregulations that support smallholder farming communities; and (v) \neffective  project  management  that  enables  timely  completion  of \nthe project and achievement of project objectives. \n \nCambodia  has  achieved  gross  domestic  product  growth  of  8%\u2013\n10%  a  year  since  2001,  driven  largely  by  an  expansion  of  the \nconstruction,  garment,  and  tourism  sectors.  Agricultural  growth \nhas  fluctuated  because  of  variations  in  the  performance  of  the \ncrop  sector,  especially  rice.  However, \nthe  Government  of \nCambodia  and  its  development  partners  are  deeply  concerned \nthe  narrow  base  of  economic  growth,  currently \nabout  (i) \nthreatened by the global economic crisis; and (ii) the persistence \nof  high  levels  of  rural  poverty,  coupled  with  the  growing  income \ndisparity between rural and urban areas. \n \nThe  headcount  poverty  index  of  52.40%  for  Kampong  Thom, \n51.84%  for  Siem  Reap,  37.15%  for  Banteay  Meanchey,  and \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n37.04%  for  Kampong  Cham  can  be  compared  with  the  national \nrural  poverty  level  of  39.7%.  A  recent  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) study of 20 communes, in six representative agroecological \nregions  in  four  provinces,  found  that  15  communes  had  poverty \nlevels exceeding 60%, two were between 50% and 60%, and two \nwere between 30% and 50%. Only one had poverty a level below \n30%.  \n \nOpportunities  for  sustainable  rural  economic  growth  based  on \nincreasing  the  productivity  of  resource-poor  smallholders  were \nexamined.  These  studies  confirmed  the  need  for  investment  in \nagricultural  productivity  improvement,  rural  infrastructure,  and \ncapacity building. The focus should be on commune-led activities \nto support smallholder production, and key institutional reforms to \nenable  faster  agricultural  growth.  The  proposed  investments \nwould  be  in  line  with  ADB's  Strategy  2020,  the  country  strategy \nand program for Cambodia, and the road map for agriculture and \nnatural  resources  for  Cambodia.  The  investments  would  also \nsupport  the  International  Fund  for  Agriculture  and  Development \n(IFAD)  country  strategy  for  Cambodia,  and  the  Government\u2019s \nRectangular Strategy II. \n \nADB\u2019s  assistance  to  Cambodia,  especially  for  agricultural  policy \ndevelopment and finance sector reform, has established the base \nfor  faster  economic  growth.  Rural  roads  have  strengthened \nmarket  links  and  improved  mobility;  irrigation  schemes  have \ncreated  access \nincrease  agricultural \nproduction;  and  water  supply  and  sanitation  works  have \ncontributed  to  better  health.  With  three  ongoing  projects  and \nsupporting  technical  assistance  (TA),  the  Tonle  Sap  Initiative  is \ncreating  assets,  infrastructure,  and  institutional  capacity  locally, \nwhile  protecting  the  environment  and  natural  resources  of  the \nTonle  Sap  basin.  The  recently  completed  commune  council \nbuildings  are  centers  for  local  authorities  to  better  organize  and \nimplement service deliveries to communities. \n \nTo  accelerate  development  and  deepen  the  impact  of  the  past \ninvestment  and  TA  projects,  additional  support  to  strengthen \ncommunity-driven  development  and \nto  enhance  household \nproduction, income, and access to technology, markets, and credit \nwill be essential. The provision of rural finance will be essential to \nremove barriers that restrict supply and constrain access to credit \nby  poor  households.  The  segmented  nature  of  the  rural  credit \nmarket,  and  the  absence  of  properly  functioning  markets  in  the \nsegments  where  the  targeted  beneficiaries  are  expected  to \noperate,  justifies  improving  access  to  rural  finance.  The  Project \nwill  support  (i)  productivity  improvement  and  household  income \ndiversification  with  better  risk  management;  (ii)  easier  market \naccess  with  biosecurity  and  information  and  communication \ntechnology; (iii) institutional strengthening to improve governance \nand  effective  service  delivery;  and  (iv)  greater  access \nto \naffordable finance. \n\nto  water  sources \n\nto \n\n\fImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \n\n \n\niii\n\n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  to  improve  the  livelihoods  of \napproximately 630,000 households in four provinces in the Tonle \nSap basin by 2020. The Project's outcome will be an increase in \nagricultural  productivity  and  improve  access  to  markets  in  156 \ncommunes in four provinces in the Tonle Sap basin. \n \nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $55.30  million,  including  taxes \nand duties of $4.75 million. \n \nADB  will  provide  $30.70  million,  comprising  a  loan  in  special \ndrawing  rights  equivalent  to  $3.40  million  and  a  grant  not \nexceeding  the  equivalent  of  $27.30  million,  both  from  its  Special \nFunds  resources.  ADB  support  will  finance  55.5%  of  the  project \ncosts.  IFAD  will  provide  $13.38  million,  comprising  a  loan  in \nspecial  drawing  rights  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $6.69 \nmillion  and  a  grant  in  special  drawing  rights  not  exceeding  the \nequivalent  of  $6.69  million  on  a  joint  cofinancing  basis.  IFAD \nsupport  will  finance  24.2%  of  the  project  costs.  The  Government \nof  Finland  will  provide  a  grant  in  euros  not  exceeding  the \nequivalent  of  $5.75  million  to  finance  10.4%  of  the  project  costs, \non  a  cofinancing  basis.  ADB  will  administer  the  cofinancing  from \nthe  IFAD  and  the  Government  of  Finland.  The  Government  of \nCambodia  will  contribute  $5.47  million  to  finance  recurrent  and \ninvestment  costs,  and  taxes  and  duties,  accounting  for  9.9%  of \nthe project costs. The ADB loan portion will have a maturity of 32 \nyears with a grace period of 8 years, and an annual interest rate \nof  1%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  thereafter.  The \nGovernment  of  Cambodia  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  risk. \nInterest charges on the loan are to be capitalized. \n \n\nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development \n\n \nItem \nAsian Development Bank  \n\nLoan \nGrant \n\nLoan \nGrant \nGovernment of Finland  \nGovernment of Cambodia  \n\nTotal \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n1 March 2010 to 28 February 2017 \n \n31 August 2017 \n\nTotal\n\n($ million) \n\n \n(%) \n55.5 \n6.1 \n49.4 \n24.2 \n12.1 \n12.1 \n10.4 \n9.9 \n100.0 \n\n30.70 \n3.40 \n27.30 \n13.38 \n6.69 \n6.69 \n5.75 \n5.47 \n55.30 \n\n \nMinistry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) \n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n \n\nthe \n\nIFAD, \n\nto  ADB  and \n\nto  MEF,  and  onward \n\nimplementing  agencies  and \n\nThe  MAFF  will  execute  the  Project  and  will  be  an  implementing \nagency.  The  Project  will  be  managed  by  the  MAFF  development \ncoordination  unit  (DCU)  housed  in  the  secretary  general\u2019s  office. \nThe  DCU  will  have  the  following  roles  and  responsibilities:  (i) \nreporting \nundertake  consolidated  planning,  budgeting  and \nfunctions; (ii) open and maintain project accounts; (iii) prepare, in \na  timely  fashion,  the  necessary  withdrawal  applications  for \nsubmission \nfor \nreimbursement,  based  on  the  financial  statements  and  requests \nfrom  the  implementing  agencies,  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time); \n(iv) procure goods and consulting services in cooperation with the \nimplementing  agencies  following  procedures  acceptable  to  the \nADB;  (v)  appoint  independent  auditors,  acceptable  to  the  ADB; \n(vi)  establish,  within  6  months  of  the  effective  date,  a  monitoring \nand  evaluation  system  (including  conducting  the  base  line, \nmidterm  and  project  completion  reviews);  (vii)  review  and \nconsolidate the project annual work plan and budget prepared by \nthe  implementing  agencies;  (viii)  consolidate  the  progress  and \nfinancial  reports  prepared  by  the  implementing  agencies;  (ix) \ndisseminate project reports to ADB, IFAD and other stakeholders; \n(x)  assist  and  advise \nthe \nparticipating provinces on project implementation; and (xi) provide \nsecretariat support to the project steering committee.  \n \nThe  Council  for  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (CARD)  will \nundertake  the  functions  of  the  project  steering  committee  and  as \npart  of  its  regular  functions.  CARD  will  consider  project  matters \nquarterly  to  (i)  provide  policy  guidance;  (ii)  review  project \nprogress;  and  (iii)  resolve  policy  issues  related  to  the  Project. \nCARD  may  receive  inputs  from  the  Supreme  National  Economic \nCouncil  on  policies  and  regulations  that  support  smallholder \nfarming communities. \n \nThe  Project  will  have  three  implementing  agencies:  (i)  MAFF  for \nagricultural  policy  development;  (ii)  the  National  Committee  for \nSub-National  Democratic  Development  Secretariat  (NCDDS)  for \ncommune  development  activities, \nincluding  small-scale  rural \ninfrastructure  development;  and  (iii)  the  National  Information \nCommunications  Technology  Development  Authority  for  rural \ninformation and communication technology investment activities. \n \nIn  the  four  provinces,  commune  councils  and  the  provincial  and \ndistrict administrations will participate in the implementation of the \nProject. The Organic Law, 2009 has been enacted, the provincial \nand  district  councils  have  been  elected,  and  the  associated \nadministrative arrangements related to the provinces and districts \nare being developed. Consequently, the Project\u2019s implementation \narrangements will require adjustment from time to time to facilitate \nharmonization  with  the  Government's  regulatory  framework  for \nproject \ndecentralization \n\ndeconcentration. \n\nInitially, \n\nand \n\n\fProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\nv\n\nfrom  national  consultants, \n\nimplementation at the subnational level, including at the commune \nlevel,  will  follow  NCDDS  systems  and  operating  procedures, \nincluding  the  provisions  of  the  NCDDS  decentralization  and \ndeconcentration  finance  and  administration  manual  (2009,  as \namended from time to time). \n \nPrior-  and  post-review  thresholds  were  discussed  and  agreed \nupon  with  the  MAFF  and  are  included  in  the  procurement  plan. \nInternational  procurement  is  not  envisaged  under  the  Project. \nCommune-level procurement will follow procedures in the NCDDS \nCommune/Sangkat  Fund  project \nimplementation  manual \nacceptable  to  the  project  financiers.  All  other  goods,  works,  and \nservices  financed  by  the  Project  will  be  procured  in  accordance \nwith ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time \nto time).  \n \nThe Project will require 592 person-months of consulting services, \nincluding  76  person-months  from  international  consultants  and \n516  person-months \nfor  project \nmanagement  and  expert  services.  A  summary  of  the  consulting \nservice  schedule  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  I.  The  outline \nterms  of  reference  for  consultants  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix \nJ.  Recruitment  of  the  majority  of  consulting  services  will  be \nthrough  a  firm  following  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nprocess, using an 70:30 quality\u2013cost ratio. Four person-months of \ninternational consulting services and 84 person-months of national \nconsulting  services  are  envisaged  independent  consultants  for \nspecial  studies.  The  Project  will  finance  the  appointment  of  432 \nperson-months  of  national  advisors  for  implementation  of  the \nproject  at  provincial  and  district  administrations.  The  recruitment \nof  international  and  national  advisors  will  follow  government \nprocedures,  acceptable  to  ADB  (main  text,  footnote  37),  to \npromote  maximum  alignment  of  project  staffing  and  procedures \nwith  government  structures  and  procedures.  Except  for  the \nnational  advisors,  recruitment  of  all  consulting  services  will  be  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nThe  Project  will  cover  four  provinces  in  the  Tonle  Sap  basin: \nBanteay  Meanchey  Kampong  Cham,  Kampong  Thom,  and  Siem \nReap.  It  is  expected  to  benefit  about  630,000  households  (or \nabout  2.5  million  people)  in  196  communes  in  these  four \nprovinces through investments, training and capacity building, and \nlivelihood  field  demonstrations  and  follow-ups.  The  majority  of \nhouseholds  in  the  project  communes  involved  in  agricultural \nproduction have less than 3.0 hectares of usable agricultural land. \nThose  with  1.0  hectares  or  less  are  considered  resource-poor \nsmallholders, and they are the focus of the Project.   \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nDirect project benefits will include  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nincremental gains from higher yields and productivity of \ncrops  and  other  agricultural  products  through  the \nadoption  of  appropriate  inputs,  such  as  high-quality \nseeds,  appropriately  managed  land,  fertilizers,  water, \nbetter  crop  management,  and  improved  extension \nservices;  \nhigher  gross  margins  from  improved  market  access \nand crop diversification; and higher market prices with \nreduced  risk  of  food  poisoning,  particularly  in  the \nproduction  of  livestock,  aquaculture,  and  vegetables \nresulting \nfrom  better  post-harvest  phyto-sanitary \nmanagement;  \ngreater  access  to  formal  rural  financial  services  for \nsmallholders \nimprovement \nin \ngroups,  which  will  gain  knowledge  and  graduate  to \nbeing rated creditworthy; and \nbetter  incremental  asset  accumulation  through  more \nalternative \nrisk \ndiversification,  higher  gross  margins  from  increased \nto  markets  and \nproductivity,  and  greater  access \naffordable finance.  \n\nopportunities \n\nlivelihood \n\nlivelihood \n\ninvolved \n\nand \n\n \nIn the long run, smallholders will benefit from improved knowledge \nof household economics, and stronger market consciousness and \nentrepreneurial mindsets. \n \nAdditional benefits from better infrastructure, such as rural roads, \nmarkets, village-level storage, on-farm irrigation, and water supply \nand  sanitation,  will  accrue  to  the  communities.  The  infrastructure \nwill help improve productivity, strengthen market links, reduce the \nrisk  of  waterborne  diseases,  and  improve  product  quality  after \nharvest.  Costs  and  time  savings  from  an  improvement  in  rural \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  will  be  significant  as  the  majority  of \nthe  selected  communes  do  not  have  adequate  access  to  safe \nwater and appropriate sanitation.  \n \nImproved  knowledge  through  capacity  building,  practical  training, \ndemonstration activities, and production practices will provide the \nfoundation  for  smallholders  to  raise  their  living  standards.  The \nProject  will  make  substantial  contributions  to  reducing  rural \npoverty in the selected provinces. This will help ease pressures to \nmigrate  from  rural  areas  to  urban  centers  such  as  Phnom  Penh \nand Siem Reap.  \n \nThe  Project  will  also  contribute  significantly  to  ensuring  food \nsecurity  and  to  easing  poverty  of  wage  labor  by  increasing  the \navailability  of  rural  jobs.  This  will  reduce  the  social  and  financial \ncosts of migration to other provinces in search of work.   \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\nvii\n\nIn  addition,  the  Project  will  assist  the  Government  in  policy  and \ninstitutional  reform,  including  drafting  key  laws  and  regulations. \nThe  Project  will  also  strengthen  the  capacity  of  stakeholders  in \nimplementing  decentralization  and  deconcentration  policies  in \nagriculture and rural development.  \n \nThe  economic  internal  rates  of  return  were  calculated  for  four \nsample  subprojects  considered  representative  of  the  whole \nProject. The results indicate an economic internal rate of return of \n44%\u201355%  and  benefit\u2013cost  ratios  of  1.5\u20131.6.  The  robustness  of \nthese results was established by sensitivity analyses with respect \nto  an  increase  in  capital  and  recurrent  costs,  an  implementation \ndelay,  and  potential  input-  and  output-related  risks  that  would \nreduce the project benefits.   \n \nThe  Government's  commitment  to  faster  agricultural  growth  may \ndiminish  in  the  face  of  other  development  priorities  over  the \nproject  implementation  period.  ADB  will  monitor  the  enabling \nenvironment  during  project \nthe \nGovernment in addressing priority policy and institutional reforms \nto support smallholder farming systems. \n \nThe  Project's  alignment  with  the  Government's  decentralization \nand deconcentration reforms will improve governance and reduce \ncorruption.

The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nMacroeconomic trend. For the decade up to 2008, Cambodia's economy grew steadily \nand  significantly,  driven  largely  by  the  construction,  garment,  and  tourism  sectors.  Gross \ndomestic product (GDP) grew at annual rates between 8.0% (2001) and 10.2% (2007). Annual \ngrowth rates for agriculture fluctuated between \u20132.5% and 15.0%. Such fluctuations, especially \nin  paddy  production,  affect  household  food  security.  The  slowdown  in  garment  exports  and \ntourist  arrivals  because  of  weaker  external  demand,  the  appreciation  of  the  riel  against  the \ndollar,  and  a  high  rate  of  inflation  led  the  International  Monetary  Fund  to  reduce  GDP  growth \nprojections  to  6.50%  in 2008  and  \u20132.75%  for  2009.1 Rapid  inflation  caused  by  rising  food  and \nenergy  prices  in  early  2008  eased  in  2009.  The  annual  inflation  rate  dropped  from  a  high  of \nmore  than  25%  in  mid-2008  to  13%  in  early  2009.  In  January  2009,  Cambodian  garment \nexports were about 60% lower than in January 2008.  More than 50,000 garment  workers had \nlost their jobs by January 2009, with similar losses in supporting services.2  \n \n3. \nRural burden of poverty and food insecurity. Despite economic growth that had been \nrobust  until  recently,  the  Government  and  its  development  partners  are  concerned  about  the \npersistent high levels of rural poverty and the growing income disparity between rural and urban \nareas. About 80% of the estimated population of 13.4 million in 2008 lived in rural areas. The \n2004 data indicated that the poverty rate in rural areas (39.7%) was almost double that in urban \nareas  (20.9%).  Data  gathered  during  project  preparation  showed  that  30%\u201340%  of  rural \nhouseholds  are  poor  and  the  rate  for  remote  communities  living  around  Tonle  Sap  is  much \nhigher. 3  Reducing  rural  poverty  and  enhancing  food  security  are  core  policy  goals  of  the \nGovernment of Cambodia. The Tonle Sap Initiative (TSI) is designed to assist the Government \nin  managing  the  natural  resources  of  the  Tonle  Sap  to  reduce  poverty  in  the  area  while \nconserving resources. Key actions to achieve these goals are (i) accelerating and spreading the \nbenefits  of  growth  in  the  agriculture  and  rural  sectors,  (ii)  strengthening  weak  institutions,  (iii) \nresolving  irrigation  problems,  (iv)  reducing  farmers'  vulnerability  to  risks,  (v)  linking  national \nhighways to the hinterland, (vi) improving public and private sector efficiency, and (vii) ensuring \nthe preservation of the country's natural resource base. \n \n4. \nVolatility  in  global  food  prices.  Almost  a  third  of  rural  households  suffer  from  some \nform  of  food  insecurity  each  year  during  the  wet  season  (July  to  November)  when  alternative \n\n                                                 \n1   International  Monetary  Fund.  2009.  Press  statement  at  the  conclusion  of  the  2009  Article  IV  discussions  with \n\nCambodia. Washington, D.C. (23 September).  \n\n2   NGO  Forum  on  Cambodia.  2009  Statement  on  the  monitoring  of  Cambodia  Development  Cooperation  Forum \n\n(CDCF) indicators. Phnom Penh (April). \n\n3   A  study  of  20  communes  representing  six  agroecological  regions  in  the  four  project  provinces  found  that  the \npoverty level exceeded 60% in 15 communes, was between 50% and 60% in two communes, and exceeded 33% \nin two communes. More details are in Supplementary Appendix A .  \n\n\f2  \n \n\njobs  are  limited.4 The  surge  in  global  food  prices  in  early  2008  combined  with  energy  price \nincreases  and  an  economic  slowdown  worsened  poverty.  More  than  50%  of  households \nreportedly suffered from food insecurity in 2008.5 Even communes producing a surplus of paddy \nhave large pockets of hunger. This situation reflects inadequate production by smallholders, low \nemployment  and  income  of  households,  the  sale  of  crops  at  low  prices  immediately  after \nharvest to repay debts, limited access to affordable credit, and a lack of storage and processing \nfacilities. This undermines the country's ability to capture the value of the rice along the market \nchain. \n \n5. \nNarrow  base  of  growth  and  pressure  on  natural  resources.  The  narrow  economic \nbase,  the  uncertainty  surrounding  agriculture  sector  performance,  and  the  global  economic \nenvironment  have  put  the  country's  recent  impressive  growth  at  risk.  The  financial  crisis  may \nexacerbate an already high rural poverty rate, putting additional pressure on natural resources.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nAbout 85% of Cambodians depend on agriculture and non-timber forest extraction for a \n6. \nmajor part of their livelihoods, although these activities account for only about one-third of GDP. \nOpportunities  in  other  sectors,  while  promising,  are  inadequate  to  absorb  the  250,000  new \nentrants  to  the  job  market  each  year.  The  opportunities  to  improve  the  productivity  and \nsustainability  of  activities  in  the  rural  sector  are  significant.  With  Cambodia  at  a  crossroads,  a \nmajor  effort is  needed  to  focus  on agriculture as  the  main  driver  of  broad-based and  pro-poor \ngrowth. While food security and better nutrition continue to be core sector development goals, a \nmove  toward  commercialization  is  required  to  create  economic  opportunities  and  enable  the \nsector\u2014especially small-scale farmers\u2014to become a bigger part of the economy. Value chain \nanalyses indicate that large gains in agricultural productivity can be made through post-harvest \nstorage,  processing,  and  marketing.  Numerous  obstacles  make  the  transition  from  low-level \nsubsistence agriculture difficult. During extensive consultations with stakeholders\u2014government \nministries  and  agencies,  other  external  development  agencies,  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs),  and  community-based  organizations6\u2014a  consensus  emerged  on  the  main  problems \nand opportunities. \n \n\n1. \n\nConstraints to Poverty Reduction and Smallholder Development \n\n7. \nLow  factor  productivity.  One of the main causes of poverty in the Tonle Sap basin is \nthe  inefficient  use  of  land,  water,  labor,  and  capital,  which  results  in  low  factor  productivity. \nCambodia's  paddy  yield  per  hectare  is  one  of  the  lowest  in  Asia  (Appendix  2).  Total  crop \nproduction  has  grown,  and  average  paddy  yields  for  Cambodia,  Lao  People's  Democratic \nRepublic, Thailand, and Viet Nam have increased from 1.4 tons per hectare (t/ha) in 1961 to 3.4 \nt/ha  in  2007.  However,  Cambodia  has  continued  to  fall  behind  the  regional  average,  with  the \ngap  increasing  from  0.3  t/ha  in  1961  to  about  1.0  t/ha  in  2007.7 Factor  productivity  is  low  in \nterms  of  labor  (about  $170  per  worker)  and  in  terms  of  land  ($518  per  ha).  Five  issues  are \nlinked  to  low  factor  productivity:  (i)  poor  management  of  land  (particularly  soil  fertility),  water \n\n                                                 \n4   Murshid,  K.A.S.  2005.

The  following  activities  present  an  immediate  opportunity  to  boost \nproductivity:  increase  the  availability  of  seed  of  high-quality  rice  varieties,  rehabilitate  small \nwater  control  schemes,  improve  crop  storage  facilities,  and  provide  training  in  the  safe  use  of \ninputs.  \n \n8. \nLack  of  access  to  markets  and  information.  Despite  receiving  substantial  external \nassistance (Appendix 3), the rural road network is still poor, resulting in high transport costs and \nrestricted  access  to  markets. Improving  access  to  production  factors  and  inputs,  as  well  as  to \nmarkets and market information (especially for smallholders), is a key to turning agriculture into \nthe  driving  force  of  pro-poor  growth.  Weak  links  between  producers  and  markets  undermine \ngovernment  efforts  to  encourage  more  commercialized  and  diversified  smallholder  agriculture. \nFarmers  lack  information  on  the  opportunities  available  and  the  associated  technologies, \nmarkets,  and  prices.  The  Agriculture  Sector  Development  Project 9  assisted  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture,  Forestry  and  Fisheries  (MAFF)  in  improving  traditional  extension  delivery  services \nto about 56,000 farmers in selected provinces, in addition to promoting nontraditional outreach \nthrough  broadcast  media.  Information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  offers  new \nopportunities to improve access to information for farmers and the rural population. Investment \nin  ICT  infrastructure  and  training  through  a  public\u2013private\u2013community  partnership  in  rural  e-\nthe  diversification  and \ndevelopment  will  help  strengthen  market \ncommercialization  of  Cambodian  agriculture,  building  on  a  pilot  application  of \nthese \ntechnologies.10 The  Project  will  promote  more  private  sector  participation  in  the  provision  of \ntechnical services, infrastructure building, application of ICT for rural development, training and \nskill development, marketing, and rural finance. \n \n9. \nInadequate  storage  and  processing  capacities  for  producers  and  traders,  poor  quality \npackaging and labeling, and inadequate transport and market infrastructure constrain access of \nsmallholder  products  to  domestic  and  international  markets.  Post-harvest  losses  in  Cambodia \nare typically 15%\u201320% in weight and 10%\u201330% in value in the market.11 The International Rice \nResearch Institute has demonstrated that losses can be significantly reduced and income from \nrice  harvests  increased  if  farmers  and  processors  use  better  post-harvest  management \ntechnologies,  such  as  mechanized  harvesters,  crop  dryers,  hermetic  storage  systems,  and \nimproved milling practices. Up-to-date market information will enable farmers to gain more from \ntheir production.  \n\nlinks  and  promote \n\n                                                 \n8   Agrifood  Consulting  International  and  CamConsult.  2006.

Weak  rural  financial  services.  Capacity  building  and  training  can  prepare  individuals \nand  groups  to  adopt  new  on-farm  and  off-farm  enterprises.  However,  without  access  to \nappropriate financial services, the rural poor are unable to act on opportunities that can increase \nhousehold income. With numerous microfinance institutions (MFIs) operating in the Tonle Sap \narea,  it  is  unnecessary  to  set  up  a  new  financial  organization12 to  provide  financial  services \n(including  savings;  credits  for  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  borrowers;  remittances;  and \nmoney  transfers).  Many  MFIs  tend  to  specialize  in  restricted  areas  in  a  few  provinces,  so \noutreach  is  limited  in  more  remote  rural  regions.  This  results  in  poor  delivery  of  financial \nservices, and unrealized potential in agriculture and the rural economy. An agro-socioeconomic \nstudy (Supplementary Appendix A) financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) found that \nthe  main  sources  of  credit  are  moneylenders  (14.2%),  relatives  and/or  friends  (11.0%),  and \nMFIs (7.5%). While lending by MFIs has expanded rapidly in recent years, access to and use of \nthese formal financial services remains limited in rural areas. Difficulty in accessing formal credit \nproviders  and  high  interest  rates 13 charged  by  informal  lenders  constrain  the  use  of  more \nadvanced  farming  techniques,  new  markets,  and  business  opportunities  (Supplementary \nAppendix B). These constraints need to be addressed by (i) supporting community-based credit \ninstitutions, (ii) delivering services to community-based institutions, (iii) increasing the outreach \ncapacity of lending institutions, and (iv) improving borrower training and capacity. \n \n11. \nNeed  to  deepen  policy  reforms  and  strengthening  institutions.  Since  the  1990s, \nADB has supported policy and institutional reforms in agriculture (footnote 9), water resources,14 \nand  finance. 15  The  Government  has  strengthened  significantly  the  policy  environment  for \nagriculture  with  the  approval  of  legislation  and  institutional  reforms  necessary  to  accelerate \nagricultural  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  The  immediate  priorities  are  to  further  the  policy \ninitiatives initiated in relation to Agriculture Sector Development Program (footnote 9) including \n(i)  the  adoption  of  sub-decrees  and  supporting  regulations  for  the  Seed  Law, 16  (ii)  the \ndevelopment of policies to promote good agricultural practices, and (iii) the development of sub-\ndecrees for farmer associations based on the Royal Decree. \n \n12. \nUnexploded  ordnance.  Although  the  regime  of  Pol  Pot  ended  in  1979,  armed  conflict \nand  the  placing  of  mines  continued  in  parts  of  Cambodia  until  1997.  According  to  the \nMine/Unexploded  Ordnance  (UXO)  Victim  Information  System,  the  four  project  provinces  are \namong the 10 provinces most affected by land mines and explosive remnants of war. Therefore, \nall development projects must be cognizant of the threats, and provide mechanisms to deal with \nUXO in affected communities. The number of casualties nationally and in the four provinces has \ndeclined  significantly  in  recent  years.  However,  appropriate  management  and  mitigation \nmeasures must be included in projects.   \n \n\n                                                 \n12 Commercial  banks  and  licensed  MFIs  are  expanding  their  branch  networks  in  provincial  and  district  centers, \n\nmaking access less difficult for rural communities. \n\n13  Interest  rates  of  5.10  to  7.33%  per  month  are  charged  by  money  lenders  and  traders  \u2013  source:  Agri-business \n\nInstitute of Cambodia. 2008.

The  first  growth  priority  of  the  Rectangular  Strategy  was  agriculture \nproductivity,  diversification,  and  competitiveness  with  the  complementary  priority  of  the \nrehabilitation  and  construction  of  physical  infrastructure  (including  rural  roads  and  water \nresources  infrastructure).  The  Rectangular  Strategy  II  (2008)  highlights  the  Government\u2019s \nresolve to strengthen the management of natural resources as the base for food security and to \npromote poverty reduction.17 The National Strategic Development Plan, 2006\u20132010 emphasizes \nimprovements in agriculture as the key to poverty reduction. The main elements of the approach \nare  intensifying  crop  production  to  increase  yields  and  rural  incomes,  diversifying  crop \nproduction, improving fisheries management, ensuring the sustainable management of forestry \nand  conservation  of  the  natural  environment,  and  providing  secure  land  tenure  for  the  poor. \nSince  2002,  the  commune  councils  have  had  an  important  role  in  building  small-scale  rural \ninfrastructure,  such  as  rural  roads,  small  market  places,  village  drinking  water  and  sanitation \nfacilities,  minor  irrigation  structures,  schools,  and  health  buildings.  Under  the  ongoing \ndecentralization and deconcentration reforms, commune councils are using Government funds \nand  development  partners  earmarked  funds  for  investment  in  activities  that  will  improve  the \nlivelihoods of the local population. The Government continues to emphasize the need to expand \nthe availability of rural credit, enhance access to rural credit, and reduce interest rates. \n \n\n3. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Objectives and Strategies \n\nADB\u2019s  sector  strategy,18 which  is  consistent  with  national  strategies  and  other  external \n14. \nassistance, focuses on (i) improving farmers\u2019 ability to raise productivity, diversify toward higher-\nvalue  products,  and  connect  to  markets;  (ii)  improving  the  market  environment  for  private \nagriculture-based enterprise growth; and (iii) strengthening institutional capacity for competitive \nagricultural commercialization.  The TSI  and  the  associated Tonle  Sap  Basin  Strategy19 form  a \ncore element of ADB's sector strategy. The TSI is an integrated program of technical assistance \n(TA)  and  investments  to  overcome  binding  constraints  on  poverty  reduction,  while  protecting \nvital  ecosystem  services  in  the  basin.  It  also  gives  a  geographical  focus  to  ADB\u2019s  country \noperations  and  business  plan  for  Cambodia,  2008\u20132010.20 The  TSI  is  a  15-year  program  that \nsupports (i) capacity development for environmental protection and development management; \n(ii) strengthening  of  environmental  protection  by  the  Government,  line  agencies,  and  people \nliving  in  the  basin;  and  (iii)  investments  in  infrastructure  to  open  new  opportunities  that  bring \nsustainable  and  inclusive  growth  to  some  of  the  poorest  communities  of  one  of  the  poorest \ncountries in the region.21 \n \n15. \non  agricultural  and  rural  development,  private-sector-led  growth,  and \n\nThe country strategy and program midterm review identified the need for a sharper focus \nintensified  risk \n\n                                                 \n17 Royal Government of Cambodia. 25 September, 2008.

Agriculture  remains  a  source  of  productivity  improvement, \nseasonal employment, and income growth, especially when connected to urban, industrial, and \nexport  markets.  Therefore,  support  for  agriculture  and  rural  development  is  an  underlying \ncomponent  of  the  inclusive  growth  strategy.  ADB's  Strategy  2020 23  directs  its  support  for \nagriculture  and  rural  development  to  be  provided  mainly  through  infrastructure  for  rural \ntransport, irrigation and water systems, and microfinance.  \n \n\n4. \n\nOther Development Partner Assistance   \n\n16. \nSeveral  development  agencies  are  providing  external  assistance  to  the  agriculture \nsector  (Appendix  3).  The  World  Bank\u2019s  involvement  in  agriculture  and  rural  development  has \nbeen  closely  linked  to  building  the  capacity  of  MAFF  through  its  agricultural  productivity \nimprovement  project  (in  cooperation  with  the  IFAD).  The  World  Bank,  with  additional  funding \nfrom  German  development  cooperation  through  GTZ  and  the  Government  of  Finland,  is  also \nhelping  Cambodia  to  improve  land  management  and  land  tenure  security  through  land  titling. \nThe  European  Union  has  facilitated  rural  development  in  six  provinces  around  Phnom  Penh \nthrough  rice  seed  improvement,  irrigation  development,  microfinance,  and  rural  infrastructure \ndevelopment.  In  cooperation  with  local  NGOs,  it  is  engaged  in  small-scale  food  security \nprojects.  In  2005,  the  European  Union  began  a  multi-component  program  in  northwestern \nCambodia  and  provided  a  grant  to  the  livestock  subsector.  The  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational Development supports building the capacity at MAFF\u2019s Department of Agricultural \nExtension  and  the  Cambodia  Agricultural  Research  and  Development  Institute,  and  is  also \nengaged in improving rice seed quality and post-harvest handling of rice through its agricultural \nquality improvement project.  \n \n17. \nSince 1996, the IFAD has provided $48.59 million in grants and loans for five projects in \npartnership with other development agencies.24 The IFAD country strategy for Cambodia, 2008\u2013\n2012 has two strategic objectives: (i) sustainable livelihood opportunities for poor rural men and \nwomen in the project areas through better access to assets and productive rural services, rural \ninfrastructure, and markets; and (ii) the promotion of pro-poor decentralization, deconcentration, \nand  local  governance  for  agricultural  and  rural  development  through  institutional  support  and \nevidenced-based  policy  making.  IFAD  has  assisted  the  rural  poor  to  improve  agricultural \nproductivity,  increase  off-farm  incomes,  and  provide  small-scale  rural  infrastructure  using  a \ncommon interest group approach. The IFAD has followed systems, structures, and procedures \nfor project planning, financing, and implementation that are in line with those of the Government \nand  other  development  agencies  in  nine  provinces,  including  Banteay  Meanchey,  Kampong \nThom,  and  Siem  Reap.

The institutional arrangements to manage the provision of services to the \npeople by each level of government are evolving as new regulations, systems, and procedures \nare introduced. To ensure alignment and harmonization, the Project will support strengthening \nthese evolving structures, including their administrative and financial management systems and \nprocedures in provinces, districts, and communes consistent with the Organic Law, 2009. The \nProject  draws  on  lessons  from  the  ADB  TSI25 and  IFAD  projects  in  Cambodia,  including  the \nfollowing: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nService  delivery.  Better  delivery  of  rural  services,  including  agricultural  and  social \nservices,  is  needed  to  reduce  rural  poverty.  This  will  include  decentralizing  the \nprovision  of  services  by  public  and  private  providers,  and \ntheir \nresponsiveness  to  the  priorities  of  farmers  based  on  market  demands.  The  private \nsector  providers  of  agricultural  extension  services,  including  village  animal  health \nworkers  and  village  extension  workers,  can  be  effective  in  transferring  technology, \ndisseminating  information,  and  linking  villagers  and  their  products  with  markets.  In \ngeneral,  the  formal  banking  sector  in  Cambodia  has  not  provided  the  financial \nservices that the poor need (para. 10), but group revolving funds26 have been able to \ndo  so.  Therefore,  mechanisms  need  to  be  developed  to  expand  group  revolving \nfunds and link participants to the formal rural financial services sector.  \n\nimproving \n\nto \n\nIdentification of service providers. The Tonle Sap Sustainable Livelihoods Project  \n(footnote 25) has piloted the mobilization of service providers, including NGOs and \nthe  private  sector,  to  accelerate  community-based  development.  Some  commune \ncouncils have had difficulty finding enough service providers to provide technical and \nfinancial proposals for commune-led activities because of inadequate dissemination \nof information about project activities. Use of the media and workshops to publicize \nthe projects service requirements and future opportunities is being tested. \n \nSocial mobilization and empowerment. Social mobilization and empowerment are \nkeys \nin  economic  development. \nEmpowerment  of  the  poor,  through  village-based  organizations  and  farmers\u2019 \nassociations, is the basis for ensuring the impact and sustainability of rural poverty-\nreduction initiatives.  \n \nCapacity  of  subnational  implementation  teams.  The  level  of  understanding  of \ncommune  livelihood  fund  procedures  for  the  Tonle  Sap  Sustainable  Livelihoods \nProject  varies  between  commune  teams.  The  understanding  of  the  guidelines, \nrequired  technical  expertise,  and  performance  also  vary.  Effective  subnational \nimplementation  requires  (i)  developing  clear  terms  of  reference  to  define  the  roles \nand responsibilities of project staff, (ii) matching technical expertise with the project \n\nthe  effective  participation  of \n\nthe  poor \n\n                                                 \n25 ADB.  2002.

Community-based  development  projects \nneed to be flexible and able to adapt to changes during project implementation, as \nthe  policy  and  institutional  framework  for  decentralization  and  deconcentration \nevolves under the new Organic Law.   \n\nInvestments  in  rural  infrastructure.  Including  irrigation schemes  and  rural  roads, \nrural infrastructure projects in Cambodia carry a high risk of poor performance and \npremature  failure.  This  risk  arises  largely  from  weak  capacities  in  the  Ministry  of \nWater  Resources  and  Meteorology,  Ministry  of  Rural  Development,  and  the \ncommune councils to develop and manage these productive assets. Effective quality \ncontrol at all stages is essential. \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n19. \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  to  improve  the  livelihoods  of  approximately  630,000 \nhouseholds in four provinces (Banteay Meanchey, Kampong Cham, Kampong Thom, and Siem \nReap)27  in the Tonle Sap basin by 2020.  \n \n20. \nThe  outcome  of  the  Project  will  be  increased  agricultural  productivity  and  improved \naccess  to  markets  in  196  communes  in  28  districts  of  four  provinces  in  the  Tonle  Sap  basin. \nThis  will  be  the  result  of  better  rural  infrastructure,  improved  agricultural  support  and  rural \nfinancial  services,  greater  diversification  of  household  economic  activities,  and  the  creation  of \non- and off-farm livelihood opportunities. The Project communes, identified in accordance with \nthe  selection  criteria  (Supplementary  Appendix  C),  are  less  developed,  but  have  potential  for \ngrowth and diversification.  \n \n21. \nThe Project will assist communities in establishing livelihood improvement strategies for \nresource-poor28 farming  households  with  assets  that  give  them  the  potential  to  increase  their \nfarm-based  income  by  scaling  up  interventions  developed  and  tested  through  earlier  TSI \ninvestments  (footnote  25).  The  Project  benefits  will  be  founded  on  higher  productivity  and \ndiversified  crop  production  by  helping  communities  to  adopt  integrated  rice-based  farming \nsystems. The Project is designed to trigger broad-based development with direct participation of \nbeneficiaries  in  planning  and  executing  growth  and  poverty-reduction  initiatives  and  by \nstrengthening  agricultural  support  services  for  use  by  the  beneficiaries  at  the  commune  and \ndistrict  levels.  The  Project  will  finance  eligible  investments  in  physical  assets  and  capacity \ndevelopment activities that the commune councils have included in their development plans and \nrelated annual investment plans.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n22. \n\nThe  Project  will  assist  the  Government  in  (i)  developing  rural  infrastructure  to  support \n\n                                                 \n27  The Government requested the project preparatory TA to focus on the four provinces north of the Tonle Sap Lake \n\nas these have generally received less assistance than the provinces south of the lake \n\n28  Households  in  the  project  communes  involved  in  agricultural  production  with  less  than  1.0  hectare  of  usable \nagricultural  land  are  considered  resource-poor  smallholders.

Investments  are  likely  in  small-scale  farmer-managed  water  works,  including \ntertiary irrigation distribution systems and flood control and drainage works; structures to protect \nand  conserve  natural  resources  in  and  around  the  project  communities;  construction  and \nrehabilitation of farm-to-market roads; commune markets; rice storage and drying facilities.29 \n \nto  normal \nfor  commune \n24. \nCommune/Sangkat  Fund.  The  communes  can  use  project \nin  conjunction  with \nCommune/Sangkat  funds  or  other  sources  of  funds  to  finance  rural  infrastructure  investment \nconsistent with the subproject selection criteria (Supplementary Appendix C). Over the 5 years \nof  project  support,  the  commune  councils  can  allocate  50% 30 of  their  project  allocation  for \ninvestment in rural infrastructure. A minimum of 10% of infrastructure investment costs must be \nallocated  for  maintenance  of  infrastructure,  including  that  financed  by  the  Project.  ADB  and \nGovernment will assess how the local authorities will provide adequate finance for maintenance \nof \nFund, including the role of community-based organizations in road maintenance. \n \n\ninvestments  will  be \n\nfinanced  by \n\ninfrastructure \n\nincremental \n\nfunds \n\nb. \n\nImproving Access to Rural Financial Services \n\nThe Project will increase the availability of rural financial services through four activities: \n\n25. \n \n\n(i) \n\nprovision of technical assistance to the Livelihood Improvement Groups31  (LIGs) \nto  establish  and  manage  the  group  revolving  funds.  The  Project  will  assist \nlivelihood  improvement  groups  (LIGs)  to  establish  group  revolving  funds \nmanaged  by  a  committee  of  members.  At  the  end  of  the  first  production  cycle, \nLIG members will repay the value of the inputs to the group to establish a group \nrevolving  fund  from  which  group  members  can  subsequently  borrow  to  finance \nfuture activities. Members will also contribute savings to the fund. The principles \nof  community  participation  and  transparency  will  be  followed  to  decide  matters \nsuch  as  interest  rates  paid  by  the  members  borrowing  from  the  funds.  The  LIG \napproach has been shown to be a viable mechanism to enable the poor to build \n\n                                                 \n29  Prior approval by ADB is required for any investment: (i) for irrigation pumps and engines; (ii) already started but \nwhich remains unfinished due to design or construction defects; and (ii) supported by ADB through other projects.  \n30  The  allocation  from  year  to  year  may  vary  depending  on  priorities  and  capacity  of  commune.  Over  the  period  of \n\nsupport to the commune, the allocation for infrastructure should aggregate to no more than 50%. \n\n31  IFAD and UNDP Cambodia. December 2006.

The district agricultural office will assess the potential \nfor  productivity  improvements  in  the  target  communes.  Project  staff  will  provide \nsupport using agro-ecosystems analysis and technology improvement packages \ndeveloped by the Department of Agricultural Extension;  \nfinancing  of  agricultural  and  livelihood  development  activities  identified  in  the \nCIPs.  The  Project  will  support  investments  to  improve  agricultural  productivity, \nincluding  land  management  and  development  (with  UXO  clearance  where \nrequired); client-oriented farm-based adaptive research, including climate change \nadaptation  measures;  improved  quality  and  supply  of  agricultural  inputs,  tools, \nand equipment; access to demand-driven extension services; better post-harvest \nmanagement; and market information;  \nestablishment and operation of the LIGs; and  \npromotion  of  the  participation  of  LIG  members  in  the  agricultural  value  chain. \nUpgrading post-harvest management to reduce losses and improve processing, \nparticularly  in  village  rice  mills,  and  marketing  will  involve  funding  new  support \nservices, capacity development, and equipment.32   \n\nd. \n\nIncreasing Access to Agricultural Information and Market Data \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n \n\nThe Project will provide support to increase access to agricultural information and data \n\n28. \nthrough four activities: \n \n\n(i) \n\ndevelopment  of \nfor \ndissemination through improved rural ICT services.

The e-kiosks will provide \nrural  communes  with  access  to  agriculture-related  information  and  resources,  facilitate \ncommunications  with  potential  suppliers  or  buyers,  and  enhance  other  communication  and \ninformation  identification  options.33 The  Project  will  promote  a  range  of  ICT-based  activities  to \nincrease the value of and demand for ICT-based resources in the participating communes.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImproving Agricultural Policy Environment Component  \n\nThe  Project  will  continue  the  assistance  ADB,  IFAD,  and  other  external  agencies  have \n30. \nprovided  to  support  the  development  of  key  policies  and  associated  regulations  that  can \nincrease  agricultural  productivity  by  smallholder  farmers  through  several  activities.  The  first  is \nthe  development  of  policies  related  to  good  agricultural  practices  (GAP),  including  the \ndevelopment  of  national  production  guidelines  for  smallholders,  development  of  appropriate \nregulations for contract farming by smallholders, and their testing on a pilot basis. The second is \nthe  preparation  of  the  sub-decree  on  formation  and  operation  of  farmer  associations  and  the \nrelated guidelines. The third area involves carrying out policy-related studies on the selection of \ncrop  seeds  and  the  use  of  hybrid  seeds  as  well  as  policy-related  studies  on  the  use  and \nregulation of genetically modified organisms.  \n \n\n3. \n\nEffective Project Management Component \n\n31. \nSupport  for  project  management  will  include  (i)  strengthening  the  capacity  of  the \nexecuting and implementing agencies, and local government councils and their administrations, \nby  supporting  a  limited  number  of  incremental  technical  staff  at  selected  offices;  (ii) providing \nnational and international consulting services; (iii) providing office equipment; and (iv) providing \nvehicles  for  supervision  (four-wheel  drive  vehicles  and  motorcycles).  Project  support  will  also \ninclude  capacity  building  at  the  commune,  district,  province,  and  national  levels,  including \nspecific  actions  on  capacity  building  on  gender  issues  and  special  studies.34 The  Project  will \n\n                                                 \n33  For example, the MAFF website (www.maff.gov.kh) provides information on laws, regulations, agriculture statistics, \nand other news. The Department of Planning and Statistics' Agricultural Marketing Office hosts www.camis-kh.org \nto disseminate market price and agriculture-related information for farmers, and instructions on accessing market-\nrelated information via short message service on mobile phones. \n\n34  Special  studies  will  be  contracted,  in  agreement  with  ADB,  to  advise  the  project  agencies  on  solutions  to    \nimplementation  problems,  e.g.,  problems  in  agricultural  production,  water  resources  management,  infrastructure, \nand accessing new supply-chain opportunities. \n\n \n\n\f12  \n \n\nfinance intensive training of project staff in financial management, cash flow management, and \ndisbursement  procedures.35 The  Project  will  also  assist  in  establishing  a poverty  targeting  and \nproject  performance  monitoring  system.  This  system  will \ninclude  report  preparation, \ndissemination  of  project  information,  and  the  establishment  and  maintenance  of  a  project \nwebsite.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nThe Project supports ADB\u2019s emphasis on inclusive growth, as laid out in Strategy 2020; \n32. \nIFAD\u2019s  mandate  for  poverty  reduction;  and  the  Government  of  Finland's  development  policy. \nFaster  agricultural  growth  with  an  emphasis  on  increasing  productivity,  diversification,  and \ncommercialization of smallholder farmer livelihood strategies is expected to reduce poverty. The \nProject  will  mobilize  ADB's  expertise  in  the  development  of  rural  infrastructure  and  financial \nservices  in  cooperation  with  IFAD's  expertise  in  agricultural  development  to  transform  the \nagricultural  production  of  project  communes.  Financing  from  the  Government  of  Finland  will \nallow knowledge and market information to be provided to rural communities more effectively. \n \n33. \nThe Project has taken many of the features of ADB\u2019s TSI and has drawn lessons from \nthe projects financed under the TSI and by other development partners. The Project is aligned \nwith  the  Government's  decentralization  and  deconcentration  reforms.  The  communes  are \nresponsible  for  planning  and  execution  decisions,  while  district  and  provincial  administrations \nare  responsible  for  service  delivery.  The  Project  works  within  the  commune,  district,  and \nprovincial  planning  systems  to  identify  priority  investments.  The  integration  of  project  support \nwith  commune  planning  enables  the  Project  to  recognize  the  diversity  of  commune  situations \nand  provides  access  to  a  menu  for  change  that  responds  to  demand-driven  approaches.  The \nProject  will  promote  competitive  service  delivery,  particularly  for  agricultural  extension  and \nsupport  services.  Technical  ministries  and  departments,  as  well  as  private  sector  service \nproviders, will compete in the marketplace to provide project-financed support services.  \n \n34. \nSpecific measures set out in the project gender action plan (Supplementary Appendix E) \nwill ensure that women benefit from the Project.36 These measures include (i) the engagement \nof at least one female facilitator per commune; (ii) extensive consultation with women to identify \ntheir needs and preferences; (iii) at least 35% of unskilled labor created under the project to be \nfor women; (iv) at least 30% women\u2019s participation in committees, such as water users groups \nand  market  committees;  (iv)  at  least  50%  of  the  new  loans  leveraged  by  the  Project  to  be  for \nwomen; and (v) at least 30% women\u2019s participation in livelihood training programs and 50% in \nborrower training to manage credit and income. \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $55.30  million,  including  taxes  and  duties  of  $4.75 \n35. \nmillion  (Table  1).

The  MAFF  will  establish  a \ndevelopment coordination unit (DCU) to be located in the MAFF secretary general\u2019s office. The \nDCU  will  have  the  following  roles  and  responsibilities:  (i)  undertake  consolidated  planning, \nbudgeting  and  reporting  functions;  (ii)  open  and  maintain  Project  accounts;  (iii)  prepare,  in  a \ntimely  fashion,  the  necessary  withdrawal  applications  for  submission  to  MEF,  and  onward  to \nADB, for reimbursement, based on the financial statements and requests from the implementing \nagencies;  (iv)  procure  goods  and  consulting  services  in  cooperation  with  the  implementing \nagencies  following  procedures  acceptable  to  the  ADB;  (v)  appoint  independent  auditors, \nacceptable  to  the  ADB;  (vi)  establish  within  6  months  of  the  effective  date,  a  monitoring  and \nevaluation system (including conducting the base line, midterm and project completion reviews); \n(vii)  review  and  consolidate  the  project  annual  work  plan  and  budget  prepared  by  the \nimplementing  agencies;  (viii)  consolidate  the  progress  and  financial  reports  prepared  by  the \nimplementing agencies; (ix) disseminate project reports to ADB, IFAD and other stakeholders in \na  timely  manner;  (x)  assist  and  advice  the  implementing  agencies  and  the  participating \nprovinces on project implementation; and (xi) provide secretariat support to the project steering \ncommittee. The DCU will be chaired by a project director, a deputy secretary general of MAFF, \nwith  two  deputy  project  directors  and  staff.  One  deputy  project  director  will  be  responsible  for \nproject  coordination,  planning,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  reporting;  the  other  will  be \nresponsible  for  financial  and  administrative-related  matters.    The  terms  of  reference  for  DCU \nstaff  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  G.  Project  implementation  arrangements  and  fund  flows \nare in Appendix 5. \n \nThe Council for Agriculture and Rural Development (CARD) will undertake the functions \n38. \nof the project steering committee and as part of its regular functions. CARD will consider project \nmatters  quarterly  to  (i)  provide  policy  guidance;  (ii)  review  project  progress;  and  (iii)  resolve \npolicy  issues  related  to  the  Project.  CARD  may  receive  inputs  from  the  Supreme  National \nEconomic Council on policies and regulations that support smallholder farming communities. \n  \n39. \nThe  Project  will  have  three  implementing  agencies.  The  National  Committee  for  Sub-\nNational  Democratic  Development  Secretariat  (NCDDS)  will  be  responsible  for  delivery  of  the \nfirst  three  subcomponents  under  the  commune  development  component  and  the  NIDA  will  be \nresponsible for the fourth subcomponent (paras. 23\u201329). The MAFF will be responsible for the \nimproved  agricultural  policy  environment  component  (para.  30)  and  the  effective  project \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nmanagement component (para. 31). Each implementing agency will appoint a project manager \nand qualified staff to be responsible for carrying out its activities, in coordination with the project \ndirector in the DCU.  \n  \nAt the subnational level, the Project will provide funding, through the NCDDS, to the four \n40. \nprovincial, 28 district, and 196 commune councils and their administrations to plan and manage \ntheir  assigned  functions  consistent  with  the  Organic  Law,  project  implementation  guidelines37 \nand  the  project  administration  memorandum.  The  communes  will  be  selected  taking  into \naccount the commune database poverty score with the priority given to the poorer communes \nand those that have the potential to increase agricultural production and productivity with urban \nor  urbanizing  communes  excluded.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  eligible  project \nactivities  at  the  subnational  level  are:  (i)  included  in  the  CIP;  (ii)  endorsed  by  NCDDS'  project \nmanager; and (iii) submitted by the NCDDS' project manager to DCU for incorporation into the \nPAWPB.  The  project  resources  allocated  to  the  commune  councils  will  be  block  grants \ncomputed  using  the  same  formula  as  for  the  Commune/Sangkat  Fund  and  as  additional \nresources  to  those  provided  by  the  Government.  The  project  resources  will  be  used  only  for \nworks, goods and technical services as agreed with NCDDS. The provincial units of NCDDS will \nensure the provision of administrative and technical support for preparation and implementation \nof  project  activities  at  the  subnational  level.  Terms  of  reference  of  provincial,  district,  and \ncommune support staff are in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n41. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  7  years,  from  1  March  2010  to  31  August  2017. \nEach  participating  commune  will  receive  project  support  for  5  years.  The  phasing  of \ndisbursement  will  reflect  the  demand-driven  character  of  the  Project,  the  capacity  of  the \ncommune councils and the associated groups, and the nature of their infrastructure investment \nproposals as reflected in their CIPs and consolidated into the annual work plan and budget. The \ncommune phasing plan is in Supplementary Appendix C; the project implementation schedule is \nin Appendix 6. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nThe project procurement plan is in Appendix 7. Prior- and  post-review  thresholds have \n42. \nbeen  discussed  and  agreed  upon  with  the  MAFF,  and  are  included  in  the  procurement  plan. \nProcurements  at  the  commune  level  will  be  through  shopping  or  community  participation  in \nprocurement  procedures  acceptable  to  the  ADB,  using  the  NCDDS  Commune/Sangkat  Fund \nImplementation Manual (footnote 37).  Procurement of goods, works, and services not procured \nby  the  commune  council  will  be  by  national  competitive  bidding  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nIndividual  works  contracts  under  component  1  will  not  exceed  $30,000  and  may  be \n43. \nawarded  to  contractors  selected  using  procurement  and  contract  management  procedures \ndeveloped under NCDDS (footnote 37). Contracts for simple civil works may also be awarded to \ncommunity  groups  following  procedures  for  community  participation  in  procurement  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The first civil works contract in each province \nwill  be  subject  to  ADB  approval.  Subsequently,  the  provincial  local  administration  unit  will \nmaintain  documents38\n for  review  by  ADB.  The  Project  will  engage  contract  staff  and  service \nproviders following procedures developed under the NCDDS (footnote 37). \n                                                 \n37 NCDDS.  2009.

A summary consulting service schedule \nis  in  Supplementary  Appendix  I.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix J. Recruitment of the majority of consulting services will be through a \nfirm  following  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  process,  using  an  70:30  quality\u2013cost  ratio. \nFour  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  84  person-months  of  national \nconsulting services are envisaged as individual specialists. The Project will recruit international \nand  national  consultants  for  special  studies  as  individual  consultants.  The  recruitment  of \ninternational  and  national  advisors  will  follow  Government  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB \n(footnote  37)  to  achieve  maximum  alignment  of  project  staffing  and  procedures  with  existing \nGovernment  structures  and  procedures.  Except  for  the  national  advisors,  recruitment  of \nconsulting  services  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n45. \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  and  grant \nregulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by \nADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the executing agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. The Government will also \nensure that the Good Governance Framework (Supplementary Appendix O) is implemented in a \ntimely  manner.  The  Project  incorporates  several  specific  anticorruption measures,  including  (i) \nstrict \nfinancial  management  with  strengthened  Government  accounting,  auditing,  and \nmonitoring;  and  independent  monitoring  and  review  by  TA  consultants;  (ii)  supervision  of  all \nprocurement  financed  under  the  Project    with  appropriate  consultancy  input;  (iii)  delegation  of \nproject administration to the Cambodia Resident Mission, enabling frequent interaction with the \nstaffs  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies;  and  (iv)  random  and  independent  spot-\nchecks by ADB officials and the project consultants.  \n \n46. \nThe NCDD has established accountability working groups in all provinces, and they are \nresponsible  for  receiving  and  following  up  on  complaints  related  to  financial  and  procedural \nissues. The working groups' membership includes  senior provincial officials, commune council \nrepresentatives  from  different  political  parties,  private  sector  contractors,  and  NGOs.  This \nmechanism  was  developed  through  cooperation  between  the  World  Bank  and  the  United \nNations  Development  Programme  Project  Support  for  Decentralisation  and  Deconcentration, \nand  the  mandate  covers  all  funds  channelled  through  the  NCDD  systems.  The  Project  will \nactively  engage  the  group  to  allow  potential  project  beneficiaries  and  other  stakeholders  to \nchannel  and  address  any  complaints  they  may  have  on  the  implementation  of  the  Project.  If \nthere are complaints, the group will be required to conduct necessary investigation and report \nimmediately to ADB any malfeasance or maladministration occurred under the Project. \n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n47. \nThe Government will establish individual pass-through accounts at the National Bank of \nCambodia  to  receive  ADB,  IFAD,  and  Government  of  Finland  loans  and  grants.  To  support \neffective  project  implementation  and  timely  loan  disbursement,  the  Government  will  establish \nthree  first  generation  imprest  accounts  (FGIAs)  at  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB \nimmediately after ADB has confirmed the EA has assigned accounting staff and established the \nagreed accounting procedures. The DCU located in the MAFF will administer the FGIAs.39 The \nFGIAs  will  be  established  for  pooled  resources  of  the  project  financiers:  ADB,  IFAD,  and  the \nGovernment  of  Finland  (Appendix  5).  All  withdrawal  applications  will  be  sent  to  ADB  for \nprocessing. The MAFF will prepare separate withdrawal applications for each financing source. \nThe ceilings for the FGIAs will be set at the lower of the 6 months of estimated expenditures to \nbe funded through each account from each fund source, or 10% of the resource allocations. The \nceilings will be monitored and updated every 6 month based on the estimated expenditures over \nthe  next  6  months  of  project  implementation.  Funds  will  flow  to  the  implementing  agencies  to \nfinance  the  activities  they  are  responsible  for.  ADB  will  make  direct  payments  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Fund grant resources for agreed consulting services. \n \n48. \n For  transparency  of  operations,  and  to  simplify  the  MAFF's  task  of  reconciliation  of \nexpenditures with fund sources, three second generation imprest accounts (SGIAs) with pooled \nfunds will be established at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB immediately after ADB has \nconfirmed  the  IA  has  assigned  accounting  staff  and  established  the  agreed  accounting \nprocedures.  The  project  implementing  agencies\u2014the  MAFF,  NCDDS,  and  NiDA\u2014will  operate \nthe  accounts.  The  ceiling  of  each  SGIA  will  be  set  at  the  lower  of  the  6  months  of  estimated \nexpenditures  to  be  funded  through  the  SGIA  from  each  fund  source,  or  10%  of  the  resource \nallocations.  For  commune  development  activities,  each  commune  will  open  an  account  at  a \ncommercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  commune  activity  plan  will  be  the  basis  for  a  grant \ncontract between a commune council and the NCDDS. After the contract is signed, block grants \n(maximum  of  $150,000  per  commune  over  the  project  period  and  a  maximum  of  $30,000  per \nsubproject) can be released to the commune council from the NCDDS (Appendix 5).  \n \n49. \nFGIAs  and  SGIAs  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time) \nand  the  financial  regulations  of  the  Government.  The  accounts  will  be  liquidated  and \nreplenished  according  to  ADB's  statement  of  expenditures  procedures,  based  on  withdrawal \napplications  submitted  to  ADB  from  time  to  time.  Each  individual  payment  reimbursed  or \nliquidated  using  the  statement  of  expenditures  procedures  will  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of \n$50,000.  \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nThe MAFF will maintain records and accounts adequate to identify the goods, works, and \n50. \nservices financed by the loan and grant proceeds by source of financing. All project accounts will \nbe set up, operated, and reported on using sound accounting standards acceptable to ADB. The \nMAFF will ensure that the consolidated project accounts and related financial statements will be \naudited annually by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB and IFAD. The audited reports and \nrelated  financial  statements  in  English  will  be  submitted  to  ADB,  IFAD,  and  the  Government  of \nFinland not later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. In addition to \nthe  Government  of  Cambodia  audit  of  the  procurement  of  goods,  works,  and  services  financed \n\n                                                 \n39  The  MAFF  and  the  implementing  agencies  have  implementation  experience  with  projects  financed  by  ADB  and \nother development partners. Additional training will be provided to the DCU and implementing agency accounting \nstaff to promote full compliance with project procedures related to operation of pooled imprest accounts. \n\n \n\n\f18  \n \n\nfrom  the loans and grants, ADB,  IFAD, and the Government of  Finland  will undertake a special \naudit.  This  could  involve  independent  financial  and  performance  auditing  and  review  to  support \ntransparency, financial integrity, and objective performance assessment of the goods, works, and \nservices  procured  and  distributed  from  the  loans  and  grants.  A  separate  audit  opinion  is  to  be \nissued  on  (i)  the  use  of  the  imprest  accounts,  special  accounts,  and  grant  bank  accounts, \nincluding the SGIA and project accounts; (ii) government counterpart fund accounts; and (iii) the \nuse  of  the  statement  of  expenditure  procedures.  The  financial  and  performance  monitoring  and \nreview,  including  spot-checks,  will  be  conducted  from  time  to  time  during  and  after  the  Project. \nThey will be carried out by external private auditors or by ADB.  \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nA  project  performance  management  system  will  be  developed  based  on  the  project \n51. \ndesign  and  monitoring  framework  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the  Project\u2019s  performance  and \nimpacts.  The  MAFF,  through  the  DCU,  will  be  responsible  for  developing  and  operating  the \nsystem with information provided by the implementing agencies. It will report monthly to ADB, \nIFAD, and the Government of Finland on progress during implementation. Baseline data will be \ncollected  and  processed  before  the  initial  investment  in  each  commune,  covering  target  and \ncontrol  groups.  Periodic  surveys  will  be  carried  out  by  subcontracting  competent  local  NGOs, \nwhich  will  collect  sex-disaggregated  data  by  income  group,  types  of  vulnerability,  and  other \ncharacteristics  as  appropriate.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  collaborate  with  the  Ministry  of \nPlanning to use the IDPoor database40 to identify households that qualify for project assistance \nand  to  evaluate  project  impacts  on  poverty  in  project  communes.  The  MAFF  will  maintain  a \nproject-specific  web  page,  in  English  and  Khmer,  on  its  website  for  wider  dissemination  of \nprocurement and project performance information, and to provide a feedback mechanism.  \n \n52. \nADB, IFAD, the Government of Finland, and the Government of Cambodia will conduct \njoint  semiannual  reviews  throughout  project  implementation  to  assess  the  implementation \nperformance  and  achievement  of  Project  outputs,  examine  financial  progress,  identify  issues \nand constraints affecting the Project, and work out a time-bound action plan for their resolution. \nThe reviews will (i) assess implementation performance and achievement of Project outputs; (ii) \nexamine  financial  progress;  (iii)  identify  issues  and  constraints  affecting  the  Project;  and  (iv) \nwork out time-bound action plan for their resolution. The Government of Cambodia, ADB, IFAD, \nand the Government of Finland will jointly undertake a comprehensive midterm review within 36 \nmonths  of  project  effectiveness  to  assess  implementation  progress  and  to  determine \nappropriate  revisions  to  the  project  implementation  arrangements  and  resource  allocations  in \norder  to  ensure  successful  project  completion.  The  Government  of  Cambodia,  through  the \nMAFF, will provide ADB, IFAD, and the Government of Finland with (i) quarterly progress reports \nduring implementation; and (ii) a project completion report within 3 months of project completion \nto  evaluate  the  project  design,  costs,  performance,  social  and  economic  impact,  and  other \ndetails as agreed upon with ADB, IFAD, and the Government of Finland. Post-evaluation will be \ncarried out 3 years after project completion.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n53. \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  benefit  about  630,000  households  (or  about  2.5  million \npeople) in 196 communes of four provinces through investments, training and capacity building, \n\n                                                 \n40  Government of Cambodia, Ministry of Planning.

Most  households  in  the  project \ncommunes involved in agricultural production have less than 1.0 hectare of usable agricultural \nland  and  are  considered  resource-poor  smallholders.  The  Project  is  expected  to  yield  major \nbenefits, including the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nIncremental  benefits  from  higher  yields  and  productivity  of  crops  and  livestock \nresulting  from  use  of  appropriate  inputs,  such  as  seed  of  high-quality  varieties \nadapted  to  the  local  conditions,  appropriately  managed  land,  fertilizers,  better \ncrop  husbandry,  water  management  techniques,  access  to  information,  and \nextension services. \nSocial  and  economic  empowerment  of  the  men  and  women  in  the  farmers\u2019 \norganizations,  and  local  communities  through  capacity  building  and  self-help \ngroups. \nReduction  in  incidence  of  poverty  resulting  from  formation  of  LIGs,  whose \nmembership  will  comprise  members  of  resource-poor  households.  Project \nassistance will improve these households' food security, enable them to produce \nfor  the  market,  and  move  out  of  poverty.  Project  targeting  will  develop \nmechanisms \nfrom \nto  ensure \nparticipation as members of the LIGs.  \nIncreased  access \nincrease  productivity.  The \ncreditworthiness  of  LIG  members  and  other  smallholders  will  improve,  enabling \nthem eventually to access credit from formal financial institutions at lower costs. \nImproved  asset  accumulation  by  adopting  alternative  livelihood  opportunities, \ndiversifying  risk,  and  realizing  higher  gross  margins  from  increased  factor \nproductivity,  access  to  markets,  and  affordable  finance.  In  the  long  run, \nsmallholders  will  benefit  from  greater  knowledge  of  household  economics  and \nentrepreneurial attitudes. \nGender actions, including development of the LIGs (Supplementary Appendix E), \nwill  increase  access  to  assets  and  capacity  building  for  women,  and  improve \nawareness of project and agency staff regarding gender issues.  \nBetter governance at the provincial, district, commune, and village levels through \nthe involvement of the local communities in the preparation of the CIPs and in the \nselection of group members.  \n\nthe  poor  do  not  exclude \n\nto  affordable  capital \n\nthemselves \n\nthat \n\nto \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  Better  rural  infrastructure,  including  rural  roads,  small-scale  irrigation  systems, \nmarkets, and post-harvest structures will improve productivity, market links, and \nproduct quality after harvest. \nInternal  economic  rates  of  returns  calculated  for  four  subprojects,  chosen  as \nrepresentative of the whole project are 44%\u201350% with benefit\u2013cost ratios of 1.5\u2013\n1.6:1. Sensitivity analyses show that these results are robust with respect to an \nincrease in capital and recurrent costs, implementation delay, and potential input- \nand  output-related  risks that  would  reduce  project  benefits. Summary  economic \nanalyses are in Appendix 8; and details are in Supplementary Appendix K. \n\nB. \n\nSocial Aspects \n\nThe major social impacts of the Project are expected to be positive. Women, especially \n54. \nthose  who  are  heads  of  households,  will  benefit  through  improved  entitlement  to  food  and \nenhanced  income-earning  opportunities  supported  by  credit,  skills  development,  and  market \naccess.  A  gender  action  plan  has  been  formulated  to  address  concerns  of  female  clients \n(Supplementary  Appendix  E).  Ethnic  minorities  will  benefit  side  by  side  with  majority \ncommunities, but efforts will be made to ensure participation of the ethnic minorities. The MAFF \nwill  ensure  that  (i)  all  ethnic  minority  groups  in  and  around  proposed  subproject  locations  are \n\n \n\n\f20  \n \n\nconsulted  on  their  willingness  to  participate  and  the  suitability  of  the  sites  and  subproject \nactivities,  and  (ii)  they  are  given  equal  opportunities  to  participate  in  subproject  activities \nincluding  training.  No  involuntary  resettlement  is  expected.  Small-scale  infrastructure  will  only \nbe  upgraded  or  built  on  public  land  or  where  communities  agree  to  donate  their  land  in \nexchange for benefits, in accordance with the procedural guidelines for confirming resettlement \nimpact  developed  for  the  Project  (Supplementary  Appendix  L).  A  summary  poverty  reduction \nand social strategy is in Appendix 9. \n \nC. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\n55. \nAn initial environment examination was conducted for the Project as a whole and for 20 \npilot communes in the four project provinces to identify potential impacts, mitigation measures, \nand  monitoring  mechanisms  (Supplementary  Appendix  M).  The  Project's  proposed  small \ninfrastructure  interventions  will  involve  the  rehabilitation  or  construction  of  commune  market \ncenters; rehabilitation and upgrading of minor roads and drainage structures; and rehabilitation \nand  upgrading  of  small  embankments,  reservoirs,  and  canals.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines (2003), the Project is in category B.41 Subprojects will be \nundertaken  only  after  it  has  been  ascertained  that  widespread  negative  environmental  impact \nwould not result, based on the environmental assessment and review framework developed for \nthe Project (Supplementary Appendix N). Subprojects close to environmentally sensitive areas \nwill be avoided. Mitigation measures are suggested and adequate funding provided to address \nminor  local  impacts  of  identified  projects.  Subprojects  will  follow  environmental  assessment \nprocedures  stipulated \nframework.

The \nquality  of  construction  of  small-scale  infrastructure  is  frequently  poor  and  subsequently  poorly \nmaintained. These concerns will be mitigated by close supervision and monitoring by a strong \nproject  implementation  team;  the  establishment  and  training  of  beneficiary  groups,  including \nwater  user  committees;  and  the  use  of  appropriate  types  of  construction  (i.e.,  requiring  little \nmaintenance). \n \n \n\nframework \n\nis \n\n                                                 \n41  Projects  in  this  category  are  judged  to  have  some  adverse  environmental  impacts,  but  the  impacts  are  not \n\nsignificant. \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nThe Government has given the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal \n\n58. \ndocuments: \n \nA. \n\nProject Management  \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe Government will ensure that each of the implementing agencies will appoint, \nwithin 1 month of the effectiveness date, the project manager and all the required \nstaff  to  manage  their  relevant  activities,  including  financial  and  disbursement \nmanagement staff. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  the  establishment  of  sound  administrative  and \naccounting systems to manage pooled imprest accounts funded by multiple fund \nsources at EA and IAs prior to the establishment of imprest accounts for pooled \nfunds. \nThe Government will ensure that NCDDS and NIDA coordinate closely with other \nagencies  and  institutions,  including transferring project  resources  as  required  to \nthese agencies and institutions, to ensure successful implementation of assigned \ntasks.   \n\n \n\nB. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n(i) \n\nC. \n\nGood Governance \n(i) \n\nThe Government will ensure that (a) adequate counterpart funds required during \nthe  Project  implementation  period  are  provided  on  timely  basis  to  the  relevant \ngovernment agencies;

The country consists of 20 \n1. \nprovinces and 4 municipalities, and is divided into 184 districts, 1,621 communes, and 13,707 \nvillages. Forests cover 12.1 million hectares (ha), or 67% of the total land area. Cultivated area \nis  21%  of  the  total  (3.78  million  ha)  with  paddy  cultivation  occupying  91.2%  of  the  total.  The \nmain  crops  are  paddy  (wet  season,  dry  season,  receding,  and  floating),  corn,  soybean,  mung \nbean,  cassava,  sugarcane,  peanut,  sesame,  sweet  potatoes,  Chinese  cabbage,  cauliflower, \nlettuce, water melon, and tobacco. \n \nPaddy rice production increased from 3.5 million tons in 1996 to about 6.7 million tons in \n2. \n2007.  Milled  rice  surplus  was  estimated  at  1.6  million  tons  in  2007.1 Plantation  and  industrial \ncrops  include  rubber,  cashew  nut,  pepper,  palm  sugar,  palm  oil,  and  fruit  trees  (mango, \npineapple,  jackfruit,  durian,  rambutan,  and  banana).  Forest  products  include  teak  wood  and \nacacia  (timber),  and  nontimber  forest  products  such  as  bamboo,  grass,  fodder,  honey, \nmushrooms,  and  firewood.  Fish  production  (freshwater,  community  and  rice  field  production, \naquaculture,  and  marine)  in  2004  was  321,000  tons.  The  share  of  agriculture,  fisheries,  and \nforestry in the national economy declined from 46% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1993 to \n30% in 2006. Within agriculture, the share of the crop sector increased from about 40% of GDP \nto about 50%. Correspondingly, the share of noncrop sectors declined from about 60% of GDP \nto 50. The share of agriculture, fisheries, and forestry in total employment declined from 70% in \n2001 to 57% in 2006.2 \n \nB. \n\nSector Constraints \n\n3. \nThe  development  problem  is  the  slow  and  variable  growth  of  agriculture  and  the  low \nlevel  of  rural  sector  development,  reducing  the  capacity  of  agriculture  to  support  the  growing \npopulation  and  absorb  additional  workers.  Food  insecurity  affects  about  a  20%\u201330%  of  rural \nhouseholds  during  cropping  seasons.  The  main  problem  in  the  agriculture  sector  is  low  factor \nproductivity  in  terms  of  labor  (about  $170  per  worker)  and  land  ($518  per  ha). 3 Poor  land \nproductivity  is  linked  to  one  of  the  lowest  paddy  yields  in  Southeast  Asia  at  2.50  tons  per \nhectare (t/ha)\u2014and in some areas less than 1.00 t/ha\u2014compared with Viet Nam\u2019s 4.95 t/ha and \na world average of 4.00 t/ha. In addition, Cambodia suffers from a significant yield gap,4 as do \nseveral  other  countries  such  as  India,  the  Philippines,  and  Viet  Nam.  This  affects  household \nwell-being  in  rural  areas  dominated  by  rice  production.  Labor  productivity,  as  measured  by \nagricultural value added per worker, is also low compared with other countries. A farmer with 1 \nha and 2 tons of paddy rice will make about $200 per year (more now with higher rice prices), a \nlow income for an average family of five. This combines with the following other factors to make \nrural households extremely vulnerable to market and nonmarket shocks: lack of biosecurity; lack \nof  access  to  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT);  lack  of  market  access  for \n                                                 \n1  Government of Cambodia, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. 2006.

Low productivity \nis caused by poor resource quality and management, lack of or inadequate access to resources, \nlack of education and skills, poor health and nutrition, weak extension and research, and lack of \nsocial  and  physical  infrastructure.  The  lack  of  biosecurity  is  caused  by  the  loss  biodiversity, \nthreats to food safety, and a loss of environmental sustainability. \n \nMajor  issues  in  land  are  poor  soil quality,  small  and  declining  size  of  landholding, land \n4. \nfragmentation, lack of formal title compounded by slow registration, land grabbing especially in \nthe uplands and city suburbs, land degradation and unstable yield due to erosion, water logging, \nflooding,  salinity  intrusion,  loss  of  top  soil  and  limited  gains  made  so  far  from  economic  and \nsocial  land  concessions.  Besides,  in  some  areas  fertilizer  application  is  apparently  causing \ndegradation  of  the  soil  (hardening  and  acidity).  The  soils  of  Cambodia  are  diverse  across  its \nprovinces  and  municipalities.  Poor  soils  occur  alongside  highly  reproductive  soils.  This  soil \ndiversity  is  not  always  known  to  farmers  with  the  result  they  are  unable  to  dovetail  fertilizer \napplication to avoid soil degradation. Lack of land leveling is a serious problem for application of \nirrigation  and  improved  technology.  National  capacity  to  implement  the  2001  Land  Law  is \nlimited. The land registration progress is slow due to capacity constraint. Rural households lack \nknowledge to utilize land and natural resources optimally. \n \n5. \nWater  sector  is  constrained  by  inadequate  hydrological  data  systems,  low  levels  of \ninvestment in the sector and poor watershed conditions Land productivity is low also because of \nthe lack of water and low productivity of water. Water availability is variable in time and spatial \ndistribution.  Irrigation  efficiency  is  low  in  many  cases  because  of  poor  system  design, \nconstruction  and  operation  and  maintenance.  Farmers  lack  knowledge  of  optimal  water  use. \nFarmer  water  user  communities  are  weak.  In  the  Tonle  Sap  area,  much  water  is  lost  through \nrapid surface runoff into the lake. The Tonle Sap Lake ecosystem is under constant threat from \npopulation growth and pollution. According to available data, about 19% of the total area under \nfood  crop  production  in  Cambodia  is  irrigated.  The  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  (FAO) \nestimates that irrigation covers 274,172 ha. The Government has promulgated a comprehensive \nLaw on Water Resources Management. \n \n6. \nThe main issues in the livestock sector are disease, mortality, and morbidity, as well as \npoor nutrition, small animal size of local breeds, weak veterinary service, and lack of vaccines \nand  medicines.  Cambodia  lacks  the  capacity  to  ensure  the  biosecurity  of  animals,  feed,  and \nanimal  products.  Animals  carry  diseases  that  are  unchecked,  and  chemical  residues  or \ninadmissible substances may enter feed and meat. Cambodia is vulnerable to diseases that can \ncross  borders,  a  threat  exacerbated  by  the  lack  of  border  control  and  quarantine  facilities.  A \nfeed shortage is a binding constraint. Transport to market is costly and unsafe as large animals \nare  moved  by  trucks  and  small  livestock  by  motorbike  and  taxi  without  control.  The  village \nlivestock agent placed in each village has extended help to farmers.  \n \n7. \nOut of the total land area of 18 million hectares, over 11 million ha is under forest cover. \nSatellite survey in 2002 showed 61% forest coverage. It is now down to 59%, a loss of 2% in 6 \nyears.  The  vast  forest  resources  of  Cambodia  are  being  depleted  due  to  illegal  logging, \nencroachment, slash and burn agriculture and forest cutting for fuel wood. Flooded forests were \nreduced  by  one  half  between  1973  and  1997.  Almost  a  third  of  the  forest  area  is  degraded. \nIllegal settlement on forest land is creating conflict with forest conservation on the one hand and \nlocal population who has use right to ancestral domain. Loss of vegetative cover is increasing \nsoil erosion threatening agricultural land and water and thereby production.  \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n29\n\nfor  establishment  of  communities,  and  adequate  capacity  of \n\nFishery  resources  are  under  threat  from  over-fishing,  the  growing  number  of  fishers, \n8. \nillegal  fishing,  environmental  pollution,  loss  of  mangrove  and  flooded  forests,  and  the \ndestruction of forested wetland for firewood. The fishing industry lacks infrastructure and credit. \nConsequently,  the  contribution  of  fisheries  to  GDP  declined  from  13.0%  in  1994  to  7.2%  in \n2006. Fishers do not have access to modern technology or technical fishing skills. They mainly \nuse  traditional  methods,  which  constrains  increase  in  productivity.  Fishing  is  carried  out  on  a \nsmall  scale  by  families  in  rice  field  fisheries,  as well  as  on  a  medium  commercial  scale  under \nlicense, and on a large commercial scale under concession lots auctioned for 2 years. In 2000, \na  major  part  of  the  concession  areas  were  transferred  to  330  designated  community  fisheries \nwith a view to benefiting those communities, improving fish habitats, and ensuring sustainable \nmanagement of natural resources. By 2005, 440 fishing communities were established involving \n117,000 households. The reform process was rushed through without demarcated boundaries, \nthe  Fishery \nlegislation \nAdministration to take on the additional responsibility. Aquaculture is widespread in Cambodia. \nInland aquaculture systems include cage, fish pond, and rice-fish5 culture. \n \nResearch  and  extension  are  weak.  Both  depend  heavily  on  public  sector  participation. \n9. \nMarket-based  technology  generation  and  dissemination  is  poorly  developed.  Farmers  are \nsubsistence-oriented;  their  limited  market  orientation  comes  mainly  from  the  need  to  generate \ncash  to  pay  off  debts.  The  level  of  technology  applied  in  all  sectors  and  subsectors  is \nrudimentary.  Farmers  have  little  education  and  skills;  most  have  not  received  any  training. \nThere is no incentive to raise the level of technology and be linked to the market. Farmers lack \ninterest  and  confidence  in  the  gains  to  be  made  from  switching  technology  switch  or \ntechnological  advances.  Returns  are  uncertain  and  the  risk  of  failure  is  great,  which  becomes \nintolerable when a loan is taken out to adopt new technology. The price of better technology is \noften too high for farmers and it is often not available at a manageable distance.  \n \n10. \nFarmers  use  only  a  modest  amount  of  modern  higher-quality  seeds  and  other  inputs. \nThe use of farmer-grown traditional seeds in wet season predominates. The germination rate is \nlow (40%\u201360%). Natural selection can increase yield by 10%\u201315%, but this is no substitute for \nmodern improved seed varieties, which are used in dry season. Farmers can buy modern seed \nfrom  rice  seed  associations  or  commercial  seed  companies  established  under  the  Agricultural \nQuality  Improvement  Project.  Both  buy  elite  seed  from  the  Cambodian  Agricultural  Research \nDevelopment  Institute  and  multiply  the  seed  material  through  contract  farmers  according  to \nagreed husbandry protocols. Seed is dried and packaged for sale to farmers. High seed prices \ncompared with traditional varieties and farmers\u2019 perception of insignificant yield gains constrain \ndemand.  Seed  quality  is  often  poor  and  prices  are  high.  Seed  selection  is  also  poor,  and  the \ntesting  and  certification  system  is  weak.  Private  sector  participation  in  seed  production  and \nmultiplication is limited.  \n \nAlthough fertilizer can be a remedy for nutrient deficiency of soil (Table 2.1), Cambodia \n11. \napplies  the  least  compared  to  its  neighbors,  Thailand  and  Viet  Nam.  Fertilizer  consumption \nincreased significantly from a low base in the 1980s and early 1990s when only about 31,000 \ntons of fertilizers were imported annually.6 Fertilizer demand is currently estimated at estimated \nat 130,000 tons. Imports from Viet Nam and Thailand account for 70% of the supply. However, \nfarmers do not use fertilizer at the appropriate time or in the right amounts. Fertilizer is overused \n                                                 \n5   Practical Action. 2009. Rice Fish Culture.

In some areas, extension agents are encouraging farmers to shift to \norganic fertilizer. This is environmentally sound, but chemical fertilizer is still the preferred way \nto address the nutritional deficiency of soil and increase yield. Some farmers complain about the \ndeterioration  of  soil  quality  from  fertilizer  use,  i.e.,  soil  becoming  hard  and  acidic  after  the \nincreased  use  of  fertilizer  in  rain-fed  rice  fields.  This  may  be  caused  by  inappropriate  use  of \nfertilizer and dilution and/or adulteration of fertilizer by traders, which is common, or it may be \nlinked  to  the  availability  of  water.  The  Bureau  of  Agricultural  Materials  Standards  within  the \nMinistry of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries was established in October 1998. It was to provide \na  regulatory  framework  to  protect  farmers  and  other  users  of  seeds,  fertilizers,  pesticides, \nveterinary medicines, feeds, and feed additives from adulteration, commercial exploitation, and \ndangers to health as a result of low-quality products and inappropriate packaging. Nevertheless, \nunmarked  and  concentrated  chemicals  are  in  the  market,  and  adulteration  of  products \ncontinues.  \n \n12. \nSeveral  issues  need  to  be  considered  with  respect  to  chemical  use  in  agriculture  in \nCambodia. Farmers do not use much pesticide, insecticide, and herbicide. Chemical use, which \ndepends  on  the  cropping  system,  is  heavily  concentrated  in  commercial  vegetable  and  dry-\nseason  rice  production.  A  minority  of  farmers  apply  insecticide  to  their  fields  in  the  monsoon \nseason. In commercial vegetable growing, all farmers use pesticides. Most pesticides available \nand commonly used are hazardous to human health and harmful to aquatic life, and they pose a \nrisk  of  pesticide  residue  remaining  in  food  because  the  period  between  harvesting  and  use  is \nshort.  In  general,  the  price  of  pesticides  and  other  chemicals  is  high,  while  quality  is  poor. \nInadequate  repacking  and  sale  of  expired  pesticides,  as  well  as  adulteration,  are  common. \nQuality control, safety regulations, and the environmental protection systems are weak. Farmers \nare also handicapped by a lack of Khmer labeling on imported insecticide packages.  \n \n13. \nAgricultural research continues to be constrained by a lack of funds, skills, facilities, and \ninformation  management  systems.  Without  continued  and  longer-term  development  partner \nsupport,  ineffective  service  delivery  will  undermine  both  research  and  extension  programs. \nAgricultural  research  lacks  an  integrated  information  management  system.  The  Cambodian \nAgricultural Research Development Institute has some capacity for rice research, but resources \nare  lacking  to  retain  its  qualified  staff  and  carry  out  the  mandated  research  program.  Its \nresearch  capacity  is  weak  for  non-rice  crops,  fishery,  livestock,  and  forestry  subsectors.  The \nRubber  Research  Institute  fills  the  gap  for  rubber.  Current  research  programs  in  fishery, \nlivestock,  and  forestry  subsectors  are  quantitatively  and  qualitatively  weak.  Farming  systems \nresearch is lagging. Coordination among research institutes, universities, government agencies, \nand the private sector is poor.  \n \n14. \nAgricultural  extension  services  and  the  research\u2013extension\u2013farmer\u2013market  link  are \nweak, which restricts the flow of technologies developed through research to farmers. Extension \nworkers are far removed from research and farmers from up-to-date market information. A link \nto  the  market  is  important  since  investment  in  new  technology  has  to  be  justified  by  financial \nreturns.  Agricultural  extension  is  not  driven  by  demand.  Farmers  do  not  have  a  built-in \nmechanism  to  communicate  problems  to  extension  staff.  Extension  mechanisms  and  systems \nare  inadequate  to  respond  to  the  demands  of  a  rapidly  changing  physical,  social,  and  market \nenvironment.  Product  competition  from  neighboring  countries  is  increasing  as  the  free  flow  of \nagricultural products continues with minimal border control and weak enforcement or application \nof rules, regulations, and procedures. This makes extension for enhanced market participation \ndifficult or impossible. Extension facilities and transport at the district and field levels are lacking, \nbasically  rendering  extension  services  immobile  and  ineffective.  The  lack  of  telephone  service \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n31\n\ncreates communication problems. Extension workers have limited knowledge, and no system is \nin place to give them basic training and/or to upgrade their skills periodically. Each district has \n4\u20135  staff  covering  as  much  as  10  communes,  close  to  100  villages,  and  more  than  10,000 \nhouseholds. Communes do not have any extension presence. Women account for less than a \nthird of extension staff. The Department of Agriculture Extension\u2019s approach is to facilitate and \ncoordinate  the  network  of  agents  in  the  field.  However,  this  seemingly  useful  approach  is \nundermined by a lack of coordination among field agents, departments, and NGOs carrying out \nextension work.  \n \nC. \n\nGovernment Strategy \n\n15. \nThe  Rectangular  Strategy  stressed  that  the  approach  to  agriculture  is  \u201cto  improve \nagricultural  productivity  and  diversification,  thereby  enabling  the  agriculture  sector  to  serve  as \nthe dynamic driving force for economic growth and poverty reduction.\u201d7 In addition, the technical \nworking group on agriculture and water of the ministries of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, \nand Water Resources and Meteorology formulated the Strategy for Agriculture and Water 2006\u2013\n2010 as required by the Second Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDPII). In addition, the \nworking group developed subsector action programs, including (i) institutional capacity building \nand  management  support  for  agriculture  and  water  resources,  food  security,  water  resources, \nirrigation  and  land  management;  (ii)  agricultural  and  water  resources  research,  education  and \nextension  program;  and  (iii)  agriculture  and  agri-business  (value  chain)  support  program.  The \nworking  group  on  food  security  prepared  the  National  Strategic  Framework  for  Food  Security \nand  Nutrition  covering  2008\u20132012.  The  stated  goal  of  the  strategic  framework  is  that  by  2012 \npoor  and  food-insecure  Cambodians  will  have  substantially  improved  physical  and  economic \naccess to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food at all times to meet their dietary needs and food \npreferences for an active and healthy life. This is to be achieved through higher food production \nand  employment  creation,  better  natural  resource  management,  improved  food  use  and \nutilization, enhanced capacity to cope with food shocks, and policy and institutional reform.  \n \nD. \n\nADB Strategy \n\n16. \nOne  of  the  pillars  of  ADB  operations  in  Cambodia  has  been  natural  resource \nmanagement. ADB has also made significant contributions to policy and institutional reforms in \nthe agriculture sector. ADB-financed rural roads have strengthened market links and improved \nmobility. Irrigation schemes are increasing agricultural production and reducing poverty. Water \nsupply  and  sanitation  works  have  contributed  to  better  health,  while  the  recently  completed \ncommune  council  buildings  will  improve  the  operational  efficiency  of  local  authorities.  ADB \ndesigned  the  Tonle  Sap  Initiative  (TSI)  as  a  long-term  investment  framework  for  the \nGovernment  to  coordinate  development  assistance  in  the  Tonle  Sap  basin.  Launched  in \nOctober 2002, the TSI focuses on the management of the natural resources of the Tonle Sap to \nreduce  poverty  in  the  area  while  conserving  resources.  The  Tonle  Sap  Basin  Strategy, \npublished  in  2005,  gave  the  ADB's  country  strategy  and  program,  2005\u20132009  a  geographic \nfocus8 and  introduced  basin-level  strategic  planning  in  Cambodia.  The  strategy  is  designed  to \nfoster,  promote,  and  facilitate  pro-poor,  sustainable  economic  growth;  improved  access  to \nassets; and better management of natural resources and the environment. Recognizing that the \nthreats to the lake cannot all be tackled at the same time, the strategy promotes a geographic \n                                                 \n7   Royal Government of Cambodia. 2004.

The cycle may be repeated, building and embedding lessons \nfrom the previous iterations.       \n \nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program,  2005\u20132009  had  three  components:  (i)  to  foster \n17. \nbroad-based  private-sector-led  economic  growth,  (ii)  to  pursue  inclusive  social  development, \nand  (iii)  to  strengthen  governance  for  development.  The  country  operations  business  plan, \n2008\u20132010  seeks  to  realign  the  focus  on  agriculture  and  rural  development,  private  sector \ndevelopment,  and  risk  management  through  governance  reform.  In  agriculture,  the  focus  will \nshift  to  rural  transport,  rural  credit,  skills  development,  other  infrastructure,  rural  electrification, \nand  service  delivery.  In  terms  of  country  programming,  major  elements  of  sequential \ninterventions are being conceived in (i) emergency assistance in response to the rise in global \nfood prices, (ii) rural development, (iii) rural energy, (iv) non-farm activities, (v) rural credit, (vi) \nprivate sector development, and (vii) governance and capacity building. The sector outcomes in \nthe  current  country  strategy  and  program  are  (i)  higher  agricultural  production  through \nincreasing agricultural land under irrigation and rice yield; (ii) improved market environment for \nprivate agriculture-based enterprise growth; (iii) effective decentralized rural service delivery; (iv) \nsustainable  management  and  conservation  of  natural  resources;  (v)  reduced  economic  losses \nfrom  floods  and  droughts;  (vi)  deepening  of  the  TSI  as  a  pilot  of  a  multisector  rural  poverty \nreduction strategy; (vi)  expansion of the public financial management reform program for rural \ndevelopment to ensure effective delivery of agriculture and rural development, and to catalyze \nadditional  development  partner  support;  and  (v)  subregional  initiatives  on  new  agriculture \nsolutions. \n \nE. \n\nIFAD\u2019s Strategic Objectives and Assistance  \n\n18. \nIFAD's  country  strategy,  2008\u20132012  has  two  strategic  objectives:  (i)  sustainable \nlivelihood  opportunities  for  poor  rural  men  and  women  in  the  project  areas  through  improved \naccess  to  assets  and  productive  rural  services,  rural  infrastructure,  and  markets;  and  (ii) \npromotion  of  pro-poor  decentralization,  deconcentration,  and  local  governance  for  agricultural \nand rural development through institutional support and evidenced-based policy making. In the \nproject  provinces,  IFAD-assisted  projects  have  targeted  the  rural  poor  and  used  group \napproaches  to  improve  agricultural  productivity,  increase  off-farm  incomes,  provide  much \nneeded small-scale rural infrastructure, and thereby reduce the incidence of rural poverty. \n \nF. \n\nProject Strategy \n\nfarmers;  (ii)  stronger  rural \n\n19. \nThe project will assist the Government in creating (i) better agricultural support services, \nincluding  research,  extension,  and  information  delivery  services  to  support  higher  agricultural \nproductivity  by  smallholder \nto \nresource-poor  smallholder  farmers;  (iii)  rural  infrastructure  to  increase  agricultural  production, \nmarket  access,  and  the  quality  of  life  in  rural  communities;  (iv)  appropriate  policies  and \nregulations that support smallholder farming communities; and (v) effective project management \nthat enables completion on time and within an agreed budget.  \n \n

The  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry  and  Fisheries  (MAFF)  will \nexecute  the  Tonle  Sap  Poverty  Reduction  and  Smallholder  Development  Project  and  will  also \nbe  an  implementing  agency.  The  Project  will  be  managed  by  a  development  coordination  unit \n(DCU)  housed  in  the  MAFF  secretary  general\u2019s  office.  The  DCU  will  be  responsible  for  (i) \nmanaging  the  Project\u2019s  planning,  budgeting,  and  reporting  in  line  with  the  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB) and IFAD financing agreements; (ii) opening and maintaining project accounts in a \ncommercial bank following Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) approved procedures; (iii) \npreparing timely withdrawal applications for submission to MEF, and onward to ADB and IFAD, \nfor reimbursement, based on the financial statements and requests for reimbursement from the \nimplementing  agencies;  (iv)  processing  the  procurement  of  goods  and services  in cooperation \nwith  the  implementing  agencies  following  procedures  acceptable  to  the  cofinanciers  (ADB, \nIFAD, and others); (v) appointing an independent auditor acceptable to the cofinanciers (within \n90  days  of  loan  or  grant  effectiveness)  and  with  terms  of  reference  acceptable  to  the \ncofinanciers; (vi) establishing within 6 months of loan effectiveness a monitoring and evaluation \n(M&E) system (including the baseline, midterm, and project completion reviews), satisfactory to \nthe cofinanciers, including reviewing and consolidating provincial annual work plan and budgets  \nand  the  implementing  agencies\u2019  progress  and  financial  reports;  (vii)  disseminating  project \nreports to ADB, IFAD, and other stakeholders; (viii) assisting and advising, as required, the four \nprovinces  in  implementing  project  activities,  including  channeling  the  Project\u2019s  funds  following \nthe  agreed  upon  project  procedures  and  in  line  with  Government  policies;  and  (ix)  providing \nsecretariat support to the project steering committee. The terms of reference of DCU staff are in \nSupplementary Appendix G.  \n \n2. \nProject  steering  committee. To enable effective Government oversight of the project, \nan  innovative  steering  committee  arrangement  is  proposed,  which  is  expected  to  provide \nguidance  to  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  without  creating  excessive  additional \ninstitutional burden. The Council for Agriculture and Rural Development (CARD) will handle the \nsteering committee functions as part of its regular meetings. CARD will consider project matters \nquarterly to (i) ensure project implementation is consistent with relevant Government policies, as \nwell as decentralization and deconcentration action plans; (ii) endorse the Project\u2019s consolidated \nannual  work  plan  and  budget;  (iii)  coordinate  and  monitor  project  implementation,  including \napproval  of  periodic  project  performance  evaluations;  and  (iv)  provide  policy  guidance  in \naccordance  with  the  Government's  Rectangular  Strategy1 the  agriculture  and  water  strategy \nframework, and the decentralization and deconcentration reform and action plan.

The Project will contribute to faster income growth and improved food security of rural \nhouseholds through higher agricultural productivity, more diversification of household economic \nactivities, higher access to domestic and international markets, and the creation of on- and off-\nfarm  livelihood  opportunities.  It  was  also  promote  affordable  access  to  financial  services. \nThrough the implementation of the integrated commune development module, the Project will (i) \nimprove factor productivity; (ii) improve market links; (iii) enhance livelihoods; (iv) develop and \nstrengthen the financial market for increasing access to financial services in rural areas; and (v) \nimprove social development and community natural resources management. The policy reform \nand capacity development component will help the Government to put laws and regulations in \nplace, and create an enabling and facilitative environment for rural development. If implemented \nsuccessfully, the Project will become a model for integrated rural livelihood development.   \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  Project  will  cover  four  provinces  in  the  Tonle  Sap  basin:  Banteay  Meanchey, \nKampong  Cham,  Kampong  Thom,  and  Siem  Riep.  It  is  expected  to  benefit  about  630,000 \nhouseholds  (or  about  2.5  million  people)  in  196  communes1 in  these  four  provinces  through \ninvestments, training and capacity building, and livelihood field demonstrations and follow-ups. \nA majority of households in the project communes are involved in agricultural production, have \nless than 1.0 hectare of usable agricultural land, and are considered smallholders.   \n \n3. \n \n\nThe Project is expected to yield major benefits, including the following: \n\nBeneficiaries and Overall Project Benefits \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nIncremental  benefits  from  higher  yields  and  productivity  of  crops  and  livestock \nresulting  from  use  of  appropriate  inputs,  such  as  seed  of  high-quality  varieties \nadapted  to  the  local  conditions,  appropriately  managed  land,  fertilizers,  better \ncrop  husbandry,  water  management  techniques,  access  to  information,  and \nextension services. \nSocial  and  economic  empowerment  of  the  men  and  women  in  the  farmers\u2019 \norganizations,  and  local  communities  through  capacity  building  and  self-help \ngroups. \nReduction  in  incidence  of  poverty  resulting  from  formation  of  LIGs,  whose \nmembership  will  comprise  members  of  resource-poor  households.  Project \nassistance will improve these households' food security, enable them to produce \nfor  the  market,  and  move  out  of  poverty.  Project  targeting  will  develop \nmechanisms \nfrom \nto  ensure \nparticipation as members of the LIGs.  \n\nthe  poor  do  not  exclude \n\nthemselves \n\nthat \n\n                                                 \n1 The project communes were selected through a combination of objective criteria and participatory consultation. The \ninitial selection of communes was based on five criteria: (i) relative poverty; (ii) development partner interventions; \n(iii)  synergy  and  complementarities;  (iv)  growth  potential  by  agroecological  region;  and  (v)  geographical  (district \nterritory) focus. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n53\n\n \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nto \n\nto  affordable  capital \n\nincrease  productivity.  The \nIncreased  access \ncreditworthiness  of  LIG  members  and  other  smallholders  will  improve,  enabling \nthem eventually to access credit from formal financial institutions at lower costs. \nImproved  asset  accumulation  by  adopting  alternative  livelihood  opportunities, \ndiversifying  risk,  and  realizing  higher  gross  margins  from  increased  factor \nproductivity,  access  to  markets,  and  affordable  finance.  In  the  long  run, \nsmallholders  will  benefit  from  greater  knowledge  of  household  economics  and \nentrepreneurial attitudes. \nGender actions, including development of the LIGs (Supplementary Appendix E), \nwill  increase  access  to  assets  and  capacity  building  for  women,  and  improve \nawareness of project and agency staff regarding gender issues.  \nBetter governance at the provincial, district, commune, and village levels through \nthe involvement of the local communities in the preparation of the CIPs and in the \nselection of group members.  \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  Better  rural  infrastructure,  including  rural  roads,  small-scale  irrigation  systems, \nmarkets, and post-harvest structures will improve productivity, market links, and \nproduct quality after harvest. \nInternal  economic  rates  of  returns  calculated  for  four  subprojects,  chosen  as \nrepresentative of the whole project are 44%\u201350% with benefit\u2013cost ratios of 1.5\u2013\n1.6:1. Sensitivity analyses show that these results are robust with respect to an \nincrease in capital and recurrent costs, implementation delay, and potential input- \nand output-related risks that would reduce project benefits.  \n\n \nC. \n \n\nEconomic Analyses of Sample Subprojects \n\n1.  \n\nMethodology and Assumptions \n\n \n4. \nSince  the  Project  will  adopt  the  sector  financing  modality,  the  entire  scope  of  project \nactivities  is  unknown  at  the  design  stage.  Therefore,  the  economic  analysis  is  conducted  to \nevaluate  the  viability  of  the  four  sample  subprojects  selected  for  socioeconomic  assessments \nduring  project  design.  The  four  sample  subprojects  are  (i)  Achar  Lak  commune,  Kampong \nThom; (ii) Veal Mlu commune, Kampong Cham; (iii) Anlong Samnar commune, Siem Reap; and \n(iv) Bos Sbov commune, Banteay Meanchey.  \n \n5. \nThe primary objective of the economic analysis of the sample subprojects is to serve a \nrepresentative evaluation of the economic viability of the whole Project given that interventions \nin the communes are homogeneous. Equally important, the economic (and associated financial) \nindicators  will  be  used  as  a  set  of  benchmarks  for  the  selection  of  subproject  investments \neligible for Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing. The analysis placed greater emphasis on \nselecting  appropriate  subprojects  because  that  is  the  key  to  making  the  whole  Project \neconomically viable. \n \n6. \nThe economic analyses were prepared in accordance with ADB guidelines, handbooks, \nand  technical  notes.2 The  Project  has  an  implementation  period  of  7  years  (2010\u20132016),  and \nthe economic life of the project interventions has been assumed to be 20 years.

The  analysis  only  includes  readily  quantifiable  benefits  attributable  to  these \ninterventions. Financial revenue and costs were estimated using constant January 2009 prices. \nFinancial farm gate prices were based on findings and collated information collected during the \nsocioeconomic surveys by the project preparatory technical assistance consultant team and the \nADB  fact  finding  mission  in  February  2009,  together  with  information  made  available  by \nCambodia Rice Millers' Association. The analyses use a world price numeraire where economic \nprices for traded crop inputs and outputs have been based on the World Bank commodity price \nprojections. Labor costs have been shadow-priced at 0.85 of the wage rates, while other inputs \nhave been adjusted by the standard conversion factor of 0.90 as applicable to Cambodia. The \neconomic viability of the Project is evaluated against standard benchmarks, i.e., EIRR less than \n12%, benefit\u2013cost ratio below 1.0, and economic net present value less than zero. \n \nThe economic analyses of the four sample subprojects are presented together. Detailed \n8. \nassumptions,  financial  and  economic  production  budgets,  derived  economic  prices,  project \ncapital  and  recurrent  cost  profiles,  and  benefit\u2013cost  and  sensitivity  analyses  are  presented  in \nSupplementary Appendix K and associated Excel models. \n \n\n2.  \n\nFour Sample Subprojects \n\na.  \n\nSubprojects Description \n\n \n9. \nThe  four  sample  subprojects  aim  to  improve  production  by  (i)  helping  smallholders  to \ngradually replace traditional cultivation methods with more efficient ones, and (ii) introducing a \nmix  of  livelihood  alternatives  for  supplement  on-farm  income  and  to  provide  risk  diversity. \nBeneficiaries are farmer households that depend on agricultural production for their livelihoods. \nWhile  most  household  heads  have  had  significant  experience  with  existing  production  types, \ntheir  awareness  of  and  experience  with  agricultural  best  practices  and  market  access  are \nlimited. These factors defeated their efforts to increase productivity and increase market value \nof  the  outputs.

The  benefit  streams  of  the  four  subprojects  incorporate  only \nincremental  benefits  from  increased  crop  yields  and  productivity  through  factor  productivity \nenhancement  and  capacity  development  interventions.  The  production  types  selected  for \nbenefit\u2013cost  analyses  include  recession  rice,  lowland  rain-fed  rice,  lowland  irrigated  rice, \ncucumber, water melon, mung beans, napia grass, fish ponds, pig fattening, maize, soybeans, \nand cassava. These models were selected since these are the mainstays of smallholders in the \nproject  provinces,  although  the  scale  and  scope  of  practices  vary  from  one  commune  to \nanother. Detailed estimations of costs and benefits of the four subprojects are in Supplementary \nAppendix K and in associated Excel models (provided upon request).  \n \nUnquantified benefits. A variety of benefits cannot be readily quantified. First, although \n12. \nCambodia has been progressing on poverty reduction in recent years, poverty remains a critical \nproblem in the project provinces. With the recent food crisis and financial crisis, the problem has \nbecome  more  acute.  The  Project  will  contribute  significantly  to  ensuring  food  security  and \neasing  poverty  of  labor  wage  earners  by  increasing  the  availability  of  jobs  in  these  localities. \nThis  will  reduce  the  social  and  financial  costs  incurred  by  family  members  who  are  forced  to \nmigrate  to  other  provinces  to  seek  jobs.  While  the  benefits  from  poverty  reduction  can  be \nquantified,  these  may  be  overestimated  because  they  may  also  accrue  to  factors  other  than \nthose of the project interventions.  \n \n13. \nSecond, although not readily quantifiable, health benefits are expected to be significant \nsince  the  project  interventions  to  improve  rural  water  and  sanitation,  together  with  social \nawareness  activities,  will  help  reduce  the  number  of  cases  of  waterborne  diseases.  These \nbenefits  can  be  divided  into  two  categories:  resource  cost  savings  (i.e.,  a  reduction  in  out-of-\npocket expenses for health care), and productivity gains (i.e., a reduction in time lost to illness \nthat would have otherwise been used to generate income \n \n14. \nThird, the Project will assist the Government in policy and institutional reform including \ndrafting  key  laws  and  regulations.  At  the  same  time,  it  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  national \nand  subnational  stakeholders  to  implement  decentralization  and  deconcentration  policies  in \nagriculture  and  rural  development.  In  districts  and  communes,  a  comprehensive  program  of \ncapacity  development  will  help  train  and  retrain  most  key  personnel  working  in  the  fields \nsupporting  the  development  of  agriculture,  livestock,  and  aquaculture.  Though  difficult  to \nquantify, the benefits from an improved legal and regulatory framework, strong and transparent \ngovernance,  and  comprehensive  planning  and  management  will  be  significant  in  the  medium \nand long term. These will help to ensure that an enabling and facilitative environment will be in \nplace for sustainable development. \n \n\nSummary Economic Indicators \n\nc.  \n \n\n15. \nThe EIRRs were calculated for the four sample subprojects to determine their economic \nviability  and  serve  as  benchmarks  for  subproject  selection  during  project  implementation.  The \nresults of the economic analysis for the four sample subprojects are summarized in Table A8.3. \nBase-case  EIRRs  range  between  43.7%  and  50.3%,  while  economic  net  present  values  are \nbetween $185,000 and $225,000, and benefit\u2013cost ratios are estimated to be 1.51\u20131.63. These \nindicators  suggest  that  the  four  sample  subprojects  examined  are  economically  viable,  with \nbase-case EIRRs well above the 12% cutoff rate. As indicated in para. 4, the economic analysis \nof  the  four  sample  subprojects  will  serve  as  a  representative  evaluation  of  the  whole  Project. \nTherefore,  the  Project  is  considered  economically  viable,  because  the  EIRRs  exceed  the \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n57\n\n \n\neconomic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  for  the  quantified  benefits.  In  addition,  other  social, \nenvironmental,  and  capacity  building  benefits  have  not  been  quantified  because  of \nmeasurement  difficulties  and/or  lack  of  data.  Therefore,  the  analyses  can  be  regarded  as  a \nconservative estimate of the overall benefits. \n \n16. \nSensitivity  tests  were  undertaken  to  evaluate  the  robustness  of  the  analyses  and \nexamine  the  consequences  of  changes  in  variables,  including  an  increase  in  capital  and \nrecurrent  costs,  implementation  delay,  and  potential  input-  and  output-related  risks  that  would \nreduce project benefits. The tests were undertaken with the following variables: (i) an increase \nof 10% in the capital costs, (ii) an increase of 10% in recurrent costs, (iii) a decrease of 10% in \nbenefits,  (iv)  a  decrease  of  20%  in  benefits,  and  (vi)  1-year  delay  in  benefits.  The  sensitivity \nanalysis results for the four sample subprojects are outlined in Table A8.3. The sensitivity tests \nindicate that the subprojects are highly sensitive to a 20% reduction in benefits and 1-year delay \nin  project  implementation  (and  hence  the  realization  of  benefits).  The  analysis  implies  that \ncapacity  development  activities  for  project  management  and  implementation  must  be  front-\nloaded to ensure that delays are minimized. \n \n\nTable A8.3: Summary Economic Indicators for Four Sample Subprojects \n\nEIRR (%)\n\nSI \n\nSV(ENPV) [%]\n\nAchar Lak Commune, Kampong Thom\nENPV ($)\n\nCases\n\n0.

Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nDespite robust growth since 2000, the incidence of poverty has declined only modestly\u2014from 39% in 1994 to 36% in 2004, \naccording to official figures. Cambodia\u2019s recent growth has been concentrated in urban areas and driven by the garment and \ntourism sectors. Poverty in Cambodia still remains predominantly rural, and most poor people live in rural areas and rely on \nagriculture  for  their  livelihoods.  The  poverty  rate  ranges  from  a  low  of  2.4%  in  Phnom  Penh  to  an  average  of  40%  in  rural \nareas, reaching 70%\u201380% in some areas around the Tonle Sap basin. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) country strategy \nand  program,  2005\u20132009  focuses  support  on  the  Tonle  Sap  Basin,  which  it  describes  as  \"one  of  the  poorest  and \nenvironmentally most sensitive regions of Cambodia.\"a  \nThe  need  for  accelerating  rural  development  to  reduce  poverty  is  well  recognized  in  Cambodia  and  prioritized  in  the  (i) \nSecond  Socio-economic  Development  Plan  (SEDP  II),  2001\u20132005,  which  is  the  basis  for  the  2005  Poverty  Reduction \nPartnership  Agreement  between  the  Government  and  ADB;  (ii)  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  (NPRS),  2003;  (iii) \nNational Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity, and Efficiency, 2004; and (iv) National Strategic Development \nPlan  (NSDP),  2006,  which  replaced  SEDP  II  and  NPRS  and  incorporates  long-term  targets  of  the  Cambodian  Millennium \nDevelopment  Goalsb  (MDGs),  The  NSDP  emphasized  agriculture,  rural  development,  and  infrastructure.  The  Rectangular \nStrategy  II,  2008  highlighted  the  role  of  the  Government  to  \u201cfurther  develop  agriculture  to  make  it  the  leading  sector  of  the \nnational  economy  and  the  vital  factor  of  sustainable  economic  growth,  to  expand  the  base  of  food  security  and  to  promote \npoverty reduction.\u201dc   \nAn  underlining  theme  of  these  strategies  and  policies  is  the  Government's  commitment  to  decentralization.  The  national \ndecentralization and deconcentration framework, 2005 calls for a substantial amount of domestic resources and external aid \nto  \"be  channeled  directly  to  support  newly  empowered  sub-national  units  of  planning  and  budgeting.\"  The  decentralization \nand  deconcentration  program  is  a  5-year  national  program  to  establish  institutional  capacity  at  the  provincial  level  by \nestablishing  provincial,  municipal,  and  district  councils,  and  channeling  development  spending  and  capacity  building  to  all \nlevels of the subnational governance system. The Tonle Sap Poverty Reduction and Smallholder Development Project seeks \nto  implement  the  Rectangular  Strategy  II  and  decentralization  and  deconcentration  framework.  The  Government's  plan  to \nempower  communes  to  plan  and  implement  subprojects  will  be  consistent  with  the  decentralization  and  deconcentration \nframework. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                             Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention (Geographic) \n1.  Key Issues \nThe  Project  will  target  156  communes  in  the  four  Tonle  Sap  lakeside  provinces  of  Bantay  Meanchay,  Kampong  Thom, \nKampong  Cham,  and  Siem  Reap,  where  about  40%  of  the  population  live  in  poverty.  All  four  provinces  have  poverty  rates \nexceeding  the  national  level  of  35%:  Siem  Reap  (52%),  Kampong  Thom  (52%),  Banteay  Meanchey  (37%),  and  Kampong \nCham  (37%).  In  half  the  villages  in  these  provinces,  40%\u201360%  of  households  live  below  the  poverty  line,  although  with \nvariations.  The  600-household  survey  undertaken  as  part  of  the  agro-socioeconomic  analysis  conducted  during  project \npreparation  indicates  that,  while  poverty  rates  for  the  20  communes  surveyed  averaged  51%,  Tang  Krasang  commune  of \nKampong Cham had the highest poverty incidence at 93% and Poipet commune in Banteay Meanchey had the lowest at 8%. \nThe same study indicated that 30%\u201340% of rural households are poor; the rate is 60%\u201370% for fisheries communities in the \nTonle  Sap  basin  and  in  coastal  areas.  On  average,  more  than  50%  of  rural  people  do  not  grow  enough  rice  to  meet  their \nneeds.  Of  these,  half  have  to  make  up  shortfalls  of  3\u20134  months  supply.  However,  in  many  communes  illness,  lack  of  safe \ndrinking water and livestock epidemics are identified as more major cause(s) of vulnerability than food shortages. In addition, \nthe  sense  of  insecurity  is  increased  when  the  poor,  who  do  not  have  access  to  microfinance  institutions,  need  to  borrow \nmoney from local money lenders at unregulated high interest rates.  \nPoverty,  as  measured  in  terms  of  food  security  and  lack  of  income,  is  related  to  a  lack  of  infrastructure  for  increasing \nagricultural production and diversification, and market access; poor access to technology, extension, training, and credit; and \nlow  level  of  education  and  skills.  The  Project  will  support  community-driven  formulation  of  development  plans  and \nimplementation  of  village-level  small-scale  infrastructure  (waterworks,  roads,  village-level  crop  processing  and  packaging \nfacilities,  and  markets)  to  ensure  food  security  and  increase  market  access.  Good  connectivity  would  enable  government \nservices  to  be  delivered  to  rural  communities;  farmers  to  buy  agricultural  inputs  and  to  market  surplus  produce;  and  rural \npeople  to  more  easily  access  health  services,  education,  and  other  amenities.  Other  demand-driven  small-scale \ninfrastructure, such as schools, safe drinking water facilities, and toilets, will contribute to improvements in other MDG-related \nindicators. The Project will also assist the poor in developing skills that complement small-scale infrastructure to add value to \ntheir agricultural produce and diversify agriculture. Providing the poor with the access to financial resources will lessen their \nsense of insecurity and enable them to pursue new livelihood activities. Stronger farmer organizations and easier access to \ncredit will empower the poor.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n59\n\n \n\n2. Design Features.  \n(i) Poverty indicator will be included as one of the selection criteria for project communes. \n(ii) When selecting beneficiaries to participate in project activities, members of poorer households will be given preference. \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nLand issues. Poverty is linked to lack of access to and ownership of productive land. The situation is worsening because of \nincreasing landlessness, land grabbing, land conflict, slow processing of land titling, and degradation of forestry and fishery \nresources.  The  average  size  of  landholdings  in  the  four  project  provinces  is  1.66  hectares,  but  the  agro-socioeconomic \nassessment found that more than 40% of households have less than 1 hectare of usable agricultural land. One of Project's \ncomponent\u2014factor productivity development\u2014aims to increase rice yields by as much as 30%. For landless poor, other than \nproviding project-related jobs, the Project will aim to provide access to off-farm income-generation activities to enable them to \nearn a steady monthly income.   \nHouseholds  headed  by  women. Cambodia has a high percentage of households headed by women. Recent census data \nshows that 28.6% of rural households are headed by women. The agro-socioeconomic analysis also confirmed that in 25% of \ncommunes  the  incidence  of  households  headed  by  women  exceeds  20%.  Not  all  households  headed  by  women  are \nconsidered as poor if they own sufficient productive agricultural land, derive income from off-farm or non-farm-based activities, \nor adult members are working in waged employment outside the commune. However, as households headed by women get \nolder  and  have  fewer  economically  active  members,  their  poverty  becomes  more  deeply  entrenched  than  for  households \nheaded by men.  \nEthnic  minority  groups. Ethnic minorities account for 2%\u20133% of the population of the project area. The Cham is the major \nnon-Khmer group living in the project area. Cham live in all-Cham and mixed Cham\u2013Khmer villages. Although the Cham are \nMuslim  and  form  communities  based  on  religious,  social,  and  cultural  practices,  their  livelihoods  are  similar  to  the  majority \nKhmer population. They practice wet-rice cultivation, and are also engaged in other agricultural (livestock, fishing) and non-\nagricultural (business, micro-enterprise) activities. They are not usually represented in commune councils. However, poverty \nrates  among  the  ethnic  Cham  and  Vietnamese,  the  majority  of  whom  are  fishers  living  in  peri-urban  areas),  are  generally \nlower  than  among  the  ethnic  Khmer.  The  ethnic  Kuoy  have  derived  their  livelihoods  from  upland  farming,  hunting,  and \ngathering. Moreover, they also rely more than the lowland ethnic Khmer on the sustainable management of natural resources. \nThe ethnic Kuoy are well represented at the commune level.  \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nThe  project  preparation  process  was  geared  towards  developing  a  consensus  on  the  proposed  project  design,  and  on \nnecessary  policy  and  institutional  measures  for  effective  project  implementation,  by  involving  a  wide  range  of  key \nstakeholders, including many ministries and agencies, development partners, nongovernment organizations, and community-\nbased  organizations  at  critical  milestones.  During  this  process,  55  project  participatory  consultations  and  workshops  were \nheld  at  the  central  (3),  provincial  (12),  district  (8),  and  commune  (32)  levels.  This  consultative  process,  together  with  the \nresults of the agro-socioeconomic study of 20 communes, formed the foundation of detailed project design.  \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (CandP) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n Yes    \n\n3.  Was a C P plan prepared? \nRural  infrastructure  needs  in  communes  and  villages  will  be  identified  and  prioritized  through  the  decentralized  11-step \ncommune/sangkat planning process currently used to prepare commune investment plans. This is a participatory process that \ninvolves  communities  in  identifying  their  needs,  and  provides  for  their  direct  involvement  in  resource  allocation,  decision \nmaking, implementation, and monitoring at the local level. The Project will mobilize three commune livelihood facilitators for \neach commune to help commune councils design and manage interventions funded through the Project.  \n\n No  \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues \nWomen in the project area are engaged in rice planting and rice harvesting, cultivation of cash crops, raising of livestock, and \ncollection of feed. Women and girls collect most of the fuelwood, prepare and cook food, and are the primary caregivers for \nyoung  children,  the  infirmed,  and  the  aged.  Women  on  average  have  longer  work  days  than  men,  and  have  less  time  to \npursue village and commune public affairs.  \nThe  social  and  poverty  assessment  conducted  during  project  preparation  found  that  up  to  60%  of  cash  income  in  many \nhouseholds is derived from market-based activities. Further, it found that women play a more important role in market-based \nactivities, especially local market-based activities, than rural men. Most women interviewed are seeking to develop alternative \nlivelihood  opportunities.  Typical  activities  engaged  in  by  women  include  krama  weaving  and  mat  making,  food  processing, \nsmall  grocery  shops,  village-based  \u201cfast  food\u201d  restaurants,  dressmaking,  and  beauty  services.  However,  they  are  also \ninvolved  in  some  nontraditional  activities  for  women  such  as  appliance  and  vehicle  repair,  masonry  and  plumbing  work \nassociated with the construction of latrines.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n60 \n \n\n2.  Key  Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n\n \n\n  Gender plan      \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\nThe  Project's  gender  development  plan  provides  for  full  participation  of  women  in  all  project  activities  and  to  benefit  from \nthese equitably. Women shall also be involved in subproject design and implementation. Women will benefit from land titling \nsupport, better access to water and inputs, training and skills development, improved market links, greater food safety, access \nto information and communication technology, establishment of value chain links, access to credit, skills development for on-\nfarm  and  off-farm  income-generating  activities,  processing,  livestock  support  services,  pond  fishery,  health  and  nutrition \nservices,  and  safe  drinking  water  and  sanitation.  The  implementation  arrangement  and  estimated  costs  of  the  gender  plan \nhave been incorporated into the overall project design and costing. The implementation schedule of the gender plan will be in \nline with overall implementation of the Project.  \n\nIssue \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \n\nStrategy to Address Issue \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\n \nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nNo impact \n \n \n \n\n \nIndigenous Peoples \n\nBeneficial impact \n \nRural connectivity \nand improved quality \nof their agricultural \nproducts will improve \nethnic minority \npopulations\u2019 access \nto markets. \n\nLabor \n\nNo adverse impact  \n\n Employment  \nopportunities \n Labor retrenchment \n Core labor standards \n\n \nAffordability \n\nNot adverse impact \n\nand/or \n\nNo impact \n\nOther  Risks \nVulnerabilities \nHIV/AIDS \nHuman trafficking \nOthers \n\nSubprojects with potential resettlement impact \nwill be screened out.

However, such \ninfrastructure is determined through community \nconsultation, facilitated by the project commune \nfacilitation team, and not location specific.   \nSpecial attention will be given during planning \nand implementation of commune development \nmodel and training programs to ensure (i) ethnic \nminority people are accorded the same \nopportunity to participate in planning and training \nprograms; (ii) ethnic minority people receive \nequitable access to inputs and credit, livelihood \nopportunities, and social services; and (iii) \nindigenous knowledge and practice is utilized in \ndesigning training programs. The Project will \nengage a sociologist to ensure the process and \noutcome. \nAdditional employment will be generated from \ninfrastructure construction. Job will increase as a \nresult of the Project's technical training regarding \nlivelihood improvement, and on- and off-farm \nactivities.  \nBeneficiaries will be expected to contribute, in \nkind contribution of labor and materials about \n10% of the cost of facilities, such as rice banks, \nrural road maintenance, fish pond construction \nand/or rehabilitation, livestock improvement. \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nPlan or Other \nMeasures \nIncluded in \nDesign \n\n   Full Plan \n   Short Plan \n   Resettlement   \n Framework \n    No Action \n    Other Action \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action \n   Indigenous \nPeoples \nFramework \n   No Action \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action \n   No Action \n\n   Action \n   No Action \n\n  Plan \n  Other Action \n  No Action \n\nV. \n\nMONITORING AND EVALUATION \n\nAre social indicators included in the design and monitoring framework to facilitate monitoring of social development activities \nand/or social impacts during project implementation?  \na  ADB. 2005.
