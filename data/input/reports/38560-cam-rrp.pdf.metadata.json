It will contribute to \nthe  Government  of  Cambodia\u2019s  efforts  to  achieve  its  Cambodia \nMillennium  Development  Goal  targets  of  improved  rural  water  supply \ncoverage  by  50%  and  improved  rural  sanitation  coverage  by  30%  by \n2015,  and  its  long-term  sector  targets  of  100%  improved  water  supply \nand  sanitation  coverage  by  2025.  The  Project  will  support  current \ninstitutional reform for improved service delivery in the sector, including \nproject  management, \n(i)  a  subnational-level  capacity \ndevelopment  program,  and  (ii)  an  enhanced  partnership  between  the \n(PDRDs)  and \nprovincial  departments  of \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs). It will also link to public financial \nmanagement activities for rural development.  \n \nThe Project will support the provision of improved RWSS services for \nabout  377,000  residents,  of  which  290,000  will  benefit  from  improved \nsanitation facilities in 400 villages in 40 communes. The 40 communes \nare  located  in  16  districts  in  the  six  provinces  of  Banteay  Meanchey, \nBattambang,  Kampong  Chhnang,  Kampong  Thom,  Pursat,  and  Siem \nReap. The Project will cover 100% of all villages in each commune and \nwill  aim  to  achieve  100%  water  supply  and  75%  physical  sanitation \ncoverage in each commune. The Project is a sector investment project \nwith the following outputs (i) improved community health and hygiene \npractices through community mobilization and action; (ii) rehabilitated, \nupgraded, and developed water supply facilities in 40 communes; (iii) \nimproved public and household sanitation facilities; (iv) a stronger and \nmore  sustainable  RWSS  sector  through  support  to  private  sector \ndevelopment  and  improved  monitoring  of  RWSS  coverage;  and  (v) \nimproved capacity for project implementation. \n \nCambodia  is  almost  entirely  rural,  with  more  than  80%  of  the  total \npopulation  living  in  rural  areas.  A  focus  on  rural  development, \ninfrastructure,  and  delivery  of  basic  services  is  the  first  step  in \naccelerating  poverty  reduction,  reducing  regional  inequalities,  and \nsupporting inclusive growth. In 2007, about 55.4% of the rural population \nhad access to improved sources of water, while only 19.6% had access \nto  improved  sanitation  facilities.  Rural  residents  spend  considerable \ntime,  energy,  and  financial  resources  acquiring  their  daily  drinking \nwater  from  distant  water  sources,  rainwater  collection,  or  having  it \ndelivered  to  their  homes.

Diarrhea is a major \ncause  of child  morbidity  and  mortality,  which  can  be  reduced  through \nsafe and clean water and proper hygienic and sanitation practices. An \nintensified  focus  on  RWSS  will  help  improve  health  and  accelerate \npoverty reduction, especially around the Tonle Sap Basin, where most \nof Cambodia's poorest live. An integrated approach to RWSS will also \ncontribute to gender equity and livelihood improvements.  \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  is  to  expand  access  to  improved  RWSS \nnationwide, and to better the health of rural households in the project \nprovinces. It will contribute to the Government\u2019s efforts to achieve the \nCambodia  Millennium  Development  Goal  targets  for  RWSS  in  2015 \nand sector goals in 2025 by increasing access to improved rural water \nsupply  from  55.4%  in  2007  to  75.0%  in  2020  and  by  providing \nimproved sanitation from 19.6% of rural households in 2007 to 50.0% \nin 2020. It will also contribute to reducing under-5 child mortality by an \naverage  of  20  deaths  per  1,000  live  births  in  each  province  by  2020. \nThe  outcome  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  access  to  water  supply  for \nabout  377,000  rural  residents  and  sanitation  for  about  290,000  rural \nresidents in an estimated 400 villages in 40 communes.  \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $25.8  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of about $1.7 million.  \n \nA grant of $21 million will be provided from the Asian Development Fund.  \n \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n21.0 \n1.8 \n3.0 \n25.8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n81.4 \n7.0 \n11.6 \n100.0 \n\n \n\n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \nBeneficiaries \nTotal \n\n \n \nUntil 31 December 2015 \n \n30 June 2015 \n\n \nMinistry of Rural Development (MRD) \n \nMRD  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project.

Equipment and material packages valued at $100,000 equivalent \nor  more  may  be  procured  under  national  competitive  bidding,  and \nthose  below  $100,000  through  shopping.  Works  contracts  will  be \nawarded  under  national  competitive  bidding  procedures,  due  to  the \nsmall size of contracts. Works contracts for household sanitation with a \ntotal  value  of  $5,000  equivalent  or  less  can  be  procured  at  the \ncommune level and will follow community participation in procurement \nin accordance with ADB procedure in implementing small projects with \ncommunity participation. \n \nAll consultants financed from the proceeds of the grant will be recruited \nin  line  with  ADB  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). Consulting services will include recruitment \nof  (i)  a  consulting  firm  for  project  implementation  assistance,  (ii)  an \nfor \ninternational  or  national  NGO \ncommunity  development  and  project  implementation  assistance,  (iii) \nservice  contracts \nin  RWSS  and  community \ndevelopment (as needed), and (iv) an international NGO for monitoring \nand evaluation. The firm will include consulting services for 338 person-\nmonths, of which 56 person-months (4 international specialists) and 282 \nperson-months (14 national specialists) to assist in project management, \ndesign  and  construction  supervision  of  water  supply  and  sanitation \ninfrastructure, social development, community driven development, and \nresettlement  and  environment  safeguards.  The  firm  will  be  hired  using \nquality- and cost-based selection and following the standard quality\u2013ratio \nof 80:20. The PCU will also recruit an international or national NGO for \n756 person-months to supply 18 national facilitators, and an international \nNGO for monitoring and evaluation for 24 person-months. \n \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  benefit  rural  residents  in  40  communes  by \nproviding  access  to  improved  water  supply,  increasing  health  and \nhygiene  awareness,  and  improving  public  and  household  sanitation. \nAbout 50% of all beneficiaries are expected to be poor. The Project will \nhave  direct  impact  on  the  health  and  livelihoods  of  the  communities  in \nthese villages. Residents will benefit from improved health and reduced \nmedical  expenditures,  as  the  water  will  be  potable.  Water-  and \nsanitation-related  diseases  contribute  significantly  to  the  poor  health \nstatus of many women and children, including high infant mortality rates \nin these areas. Provision of sanitation facilities in schools, for instance, \nwill improve the public health of students and help reinforce community \nhygiene messages. Clean water and sanitation is particularly important \nfor  women,  who  are  primarily  responsible  for  water  collection  and \nstorage to meet daily household needs and family health. Women spend \nup to 3 hours per day collecting and storing water. Improved access to \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  also  increases  the  rate  of  child  survival, \nwhich is a precursor to the demographic transition to lower fertility rates. \nFewer  children  help  to  reduce  women's  household  responsibilities  and \nincrease their opportunities for personal development.  \n \nInstitutional and Governance Risks. Potential risks include (i) changes \nto  the  decentralization  and  deconcentration  processes  following  the \napproval of the Organic Law in April 2008, (ii) challenges at the national \n\nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\nand subnational level in moving away from project implementation units \nto  project  teams  in  the  PDRD,  and  (iii)  ensuring  proper  provincial-level \nfinancial  management  controls.  To  mitigate  these  risks,  actions  are \nincluded in the Project to (i) inform key stakeholders at the national and \nsubnational  levels  about  the  Project  and  its  alignment  with  the \ndecentralization  and  deconcentration  processes  to  date;  (ii)  coordinate \nclosely  with  other  ADB-supported  projects  that  aim  to  strengthen \nsubnational-level  capacity;  (iii)  coordinate  regularly  with  the  Ministry  of \nInterior  about  the  decentralization  and  deconcentration  process;  (iv) \nensure that existing implementation and fund-flow arrangements remain \nunchanged from the time of project processing; (v) allow for a review of \nthe  existing  implementation  arrangements  within  30  months  of  grant \neffectiveness;  (vi)  recruit  NGO  staff  members  to  work  with  the  PDRD \nproject  team  rather  than  contract  out  activities;  and  (vii)  recruit  local \naccountants and financial management specialists to support the PDRD \nproject  teams  during  project  implementation,  and  to  link  to  ongoing \nactivities  under  public  financial  management  for  rural  development \n(which includes MRD). A good governance framework is also prepared \nand has been agreed to with MRD. \n \nTechnical  Risks.  For  some  villages\u2014especially  those  where  surface \nand  shallow  groundwater  is  of  poor  quality  due  to  high  content  of \narsenic, iron, or other pollutants, or where the water table is low\u2014finding \nan  appropriate  and  affordable  technical  solution  may  be  difficult.  To \nmitigate  this  risk,  mechanisms  have  been  incorporated  in  the  project \ndesign to include (i) requiring an initial environmental screening in each \nvillage  before  the  communities  can  finalize  a  village  water  supply  and \nsanitation  plan;  (ii)  completing  groundwater  testing  as  part  of  the \ncontractor's bid (up to 100 meters); (iii) providing a provisional budget for \ngroundwater testing in certain areas (between 100 and 200 meters); (iv) \nincluding  a  range  of  water  supply  technologies  (e.g.,  protected  ponds \nwith  filtration)  in  the  project  design  to  allow  for  alternative  options  to  a \ngroundwater source; and (v) training at least two persons (50% women) \nfrom  each  water  and  sanitation  user  group \nin  operation  and \nmaintenance of water supply facilities. \n \nSector Risks. There are several sector initiatives planned that will help \nsupport a sector-wide approach in RWSS. A national rural water supply, \nsanitation,  and  hygiene  strategy  for  2010\u20132025  and  implementation \nguidelines will be prepared after the Project is approved. ADB is one of \nthree  development  partners \nthe  strategy  and \nguidelines  development.  To  mitigate  this  risk  and  ensure  that  the \nproposed  sector  strategy  and  Project  are  consistent,  the  Project  (i) \nsupports  continued  dialogue  and  coordination  with  development \npartners  during  project  implementation  through  the  Technical  Working \nGroup for Rural Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene; and (ii) includes \nan assurance for the approval of the strategy and guidelines. \n\njointly  supporting \n\n\f \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Second Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project \n(the Project). \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nMore than 80% of Cambodia\u2019s total population (estimated at 13.4 million people) lives in \n2. \nrural areas.1 Thus, rural development, infrastructure creation, and delivery of basic services are \nthe  first  steps  in  accelerating  poverty  reduction,  reducing  regional  inequalities,  and  supporting \ninclusive growth. In 2007, about 55.4% of the rural population had access to improved sources of \nwater,  and  only  19.6%  had  access  to  sanitation  facilities. 2  The  type  of  water  supply  and \nsanitation facilities available to households are important determinants of the health status of its \nmembers.  Exposure  to  major  childhood  diseases,  such  as  diarrhea,  can  be  reduced  through \nproper  hygiene  and  sanitation  practices,  as  such  illnesses  are  often  related  to  the  use  of \ncontaminated  water  and  to  unhygienic  practices.  Dehydration,  caused  by  severe  diarrhea  but \neasily treated, is a major cause of child morbidity and mortality. According to the 2005 Cambodia \nDemographic and Health Survey,3 infant mortality in rural areas decreased from 92 deaths to 76 \ndeaths per 1,000 live births from 2000 to 2005, respectively. Under-5 child mortality in rural areas \ndecreased from 126 deaths to 111 deaths per 1,000 live births from 2000 to 2005, respectively. \nThe decrease is attributed to a number of reasons, including improved access to health facilities, \nand increased access to improved water supply and sanitation for rural households. \n \nRural residents spend considerable time, energy, and financial resources acquiring their \n3. \ndaily drinking water from distant water sources, rainwater collection, or having it delivered to their \nhomes.  The  percent  of  rural  residents  that  have  access  to  improved  water  sources  increases \nfrom the dry to the rainy season, as rural households rely more on rainwater collection (footnote \n3). About 57% of rural households boil water before drinking, while 36% do nothing due to lack of \nawareness,  and  the  remaining  use  a  household  water  filter  (ceramic,  sand,  or  other).  The \neffectiveness  of  household  water  filtration  by  rural  households  varies,  as  some  do  not  use  or \nmaintain the filter regularly. Women and girls spend an average of 3 hours per day collecting and \nstoring water for drinking and other domestic purposes, as the average distance to the nearest \nwater source is about 300 meters in the dry season.  \n \n4. \nThe Project will focus on rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) to help improve health \nand  accelerate  poverty  reduction\u2014especially  around  the  Tonle  Sap  Basin  where  most  of \nCambodia's poorest live.4 Here, the majority of households rely on self-provision of drinking and \ndomestic  water  through  groundwater  extraction,  use  of  surface  water,  or  rainwater  collection \nduring  the  rainy  season.  Sanitation  is  limited  to  simple  on-site  facilities,  with  the  majority  of  the \npopulation defecating in the open (about 9 million people). An integrated RWSS approach will also \ncontribute  to  gender  equity  due  to  increased  time-savings  and  livelihood  improvements  in  the \nvillages around the Tonle Sap Basin. A design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   National Institute of Statistics, Ministry of Planning. 2008.

According to the 2008 \ncensus (footnote 1), the six provinces around the Tonle Sap Basin had a combined population of \n4.10 million people, of which 84.4% (or 3.46 million people) lived in rural areas. The poverty rate \n(headcount) ranged from 33.7% in Battambang Province to a high of 52.4% in Kampong Thom \nProvince.5 Although  Cambodia  recorded  a  significant  annual  average  economic  growth  rate  of \n11.1% from 2004 to 2007, this growth was narrowly focused on the garment, construction, and \ntourism sectors. Since 2005, Cambodia has been ranked 131 out of 177 countries in terms of \nquality  of  life. 6  The  impact  of  the  current  global  economic  crisis  will  no  doubt  be  felt  by \nCambodia\u2019s rural population, as the Asian Development Bank (ADB) predicts a 2.1% economic \ngrowth rate for 2009.7 Provincial profiles are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n6. \nIn 2007, the overall access rate to improved water supply was 60.4% and to sanitation \nwas  27.6%,  while  in  rural  areas,  it  was  55.4%  and  19.6%,  respectively.  Although  access \nincreased  from  24.0%  and  8.6%,  respectively,  from  1998,  the  current  coverage  figures  are \nsubject  to  discussion  due  to  changing  definitions  used  in  monitoring  achievement  toward  the \nCambodia Millennium Development Goal (CMDG). Further, it appears that the CMDG target for \nrural  water  supply  has  been  achieved;  however,  disparities  in  RWSS  coverage  in  the  six \nprovinces  around  the  Tonle  Sap  Basin  indicate  that  the  Government  of  Cambodia  is  far  from \nachieving the CMDG targets at the provincial levels. In 2007, access to improved water was the \nlowest  in  Banteay  Meanchey  Province  at  just  17.2%  and  highest  in  Siem  Reap  Province  at \n33.2% (Table 1).  \n\nTable 1: Provincial Profiles of Six Project Provinces \n\n \n \nAccess \nto \nImproved \nWater (%) \n(2007) \n60.4 \n\n \n \nAccess to \nSanitation \nFacilities \n(%) \n(2007) \n27.6 \n\nUnder-5 \nYear \nMortality \nRate per \n1,000 Live \nBirths \n(2005) \n83 \n\n \n\nUnder-5 yr \nwith \nDiarrhea in \n2 Weeks \nPreceding \nthe Surveya \n(%) (2005)  \n20.0 \n\nInfant \nMortality \nRate per \n1,000 \nLive \nBirths \n(2005) \n66 \n\n \n \n \n \nPoverty \nRateb \n(2004) \n35.13 \n\n \n \n \n \nPoverty \nScoreb \n(2007) \n \n\n \n \n \n \nPoverty \nRankingc \n(2007) \n \n\n55.4 \n\n29.8 \n\n24.5 \n\n23.3 \n27.0 \n33.2 \n17.2 \n\n19.6 \n\n12.4 \n\n3.5 \n\n8.7 \n30.0 \n9.7 \n16.5 \n\n111 \n\n106 \n\n101 \n\n106 \n116 \n94 \n96 \n\n20.1 \n\n25.0 \n\n16.9 \n\n24.8 \n18.3 \n14.3 \n22.3 \n\n92 \n\n87 \n\n87 \n\n86 \n97 \n67 \n76 \n\n \n\n \n\n52.40 \n\n100.75 \n\n39.57 \n\n99.40 \n\n39.57 \n33.69 \n51.84 \n37.15 \n\n100.94 \n100.22 \n100.68 \n100.65 \n\n \n\n15 \n\n8 \n\n16 \n10 \n14 \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nProvince \nNationwide \n(Total) \nNationwide \n(Rural) \nKampong \nThom \nKampong \nChhnang  \nPursat \nBattambang  \nSiem Reap  \nBanteay \nMeanchey  \n\na Provincial diarrhea figures is not differentiated by type of residence (i.e., rural or urban). \nb high score = high poverty. \nc Provinces ranked out of a total of 24 provinces, with the 24th ranked province being the poorest. \nNote: All figures quoted in this table are for rural areas unless stated.  \nSources: Nationwide figures: Ministry of Planning (MOP). 2008.

Cambodia has the lowest sanitation coverage and the highest per capita \nlosses  in  Southeast  Asia.  The  annual  economic  impact  of  poor  sanitation  in  Cambodia  is \napproximately $450  million, which amounts to about $33  per capita per  year in economic loss.8 \nMany  rural  areas  show  high  rates  of  waterborne  and  water-related  diseases.  In  Kbal  Trach \n(Pursat)  and  Bos  Sbov  (Banteay  Meanchey),  common  waterborne  illnesses  include  cholera, \ndiarrhea, dysentery, and typhoid.9 In 2008, annual expenditure incurred by households for related \nmedical  care  was  KR242,206  ($60.55)  in  Kbal  Trach  (approximately  5.95%  of  the  total  annual \nexpenditure or 5.87% of the average annual household income) and KR320,000 ($80.00) in Bos \nSbov (about 8% of the total annual expenditure or 7% of the average annual household income).  \n \nWhile  infrastructure  investment  is  essential  for  increasing  the  coverage  of  sanitation \n8. \nfacilities,  education  on  hygiene  practices  is  a  precondition  for  the  improvement  of  public  health. \nThe poor\u2014and particularly women, children, and the elderly\u2014are more vulnerable to illness from \nconsuming  poor-quality  water  and  from  repeating  poor  water  use  and  sanitation  practices. \nWomen's  health  is  also  impacted,  as  access  to  unclean  water  and  unsafe  hygiene  practices \nincreases their workload, raises their risk of reproductive infections, and limits their ability to care \nfor  their  family.  Changing  health  and  hygiene  behavior  takes  time  and  cannot  be  limited  to \nsporadic  awareness  programs.  Community  ownership  is  also  essential  in  sustaining  behavior \nchange and improving health and hygiene.  \n \n9. \nGovernment's  Sector  Policy  and  Investment  Plan.  ADB  RWSS  investment  in \nCambodia  is  based  on  the  2003  national  policy  on  water  supply  and  sanitation10 and  the  2009 \nupdated RWSS sector investment plan for 2010\u20132025.11 The 2003 national policy envisions that \nevery person in rural communities will have sustained access to safe water supply and sanitation \nservices  and  will  live  in  a  hygienic  environment  by  2025.  To  help  monitor  this  progress,  the \nMinistry  of  Rural  Development  (MRD)  estimates  informal  monitoring  targets  for  improved  rural \nwater supply access at 75% and for improved sanitation access at 50% by 2020. A national rural \nwater  supply,  sanitation,  and  hygiene  strategy  is  under  preparation  and  is  due  for  approval  by \nearly 2010. It is supported by ADB, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), and World Bank's \nWater  and  Sanitation  Program  through  the  Technical  Working  Group  for  Rural  Water  Supply, \nSanitation,  and  Hygiene  (TWG-RWSSH).  A  set  of  national  implementation  guidelines  will  follow \nonce the strategy is finalized. \n \n10. \nThe TWG-RWSSH, established in November 2007, is an interministerial working group \ncomprising senior representatives from government agencies and development partners active \nin  the  sector.  It  has  coordinating  and  advisory  roles  for  policy  guidance,  strategy  and  budget, \ncapacity development, and aid effectiveness. It meets quarterly and is chaired by the minister of \n\n                                                 \n8   Water  and  Sanitation  Program.  2008.

Phnom Penh. \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\nrural  development,  with  ADB  as  the  first  co-facilitator.  A  water  and  sanitation  (WATSAN) \nsectoral working group, chaired by director of the Department of Rural Water Supply (DRWS), \nalso meets monthly to discuss initiatives in the RWSS sector.  \n \nThe Government considers RWSS to be an integral part of its overarching strategy  for \n11. \nrural  development  and  poverty  reduction.  It  regards  access  to  improved  water  supply  in  rural \nareas  to  be  a  key  prerequisite  for  poverty  reduction.  The  national  strategic  development  plan \n(2006\u20132010), 12  extended  to  2013  in  2008,  is  the  Government\u2019s  overarching  framework  for \nreducing poverty through economic growth. The plan reinforces the CMDGs, specifically Target \n7.10  to  increase  the  proportion  of  the  rural  population  with  access  to  safe  water  from  24%  in \n1998 to 50% in 2015, and Target 7.12 to increase the proportion of rural population with access \nto improved sanitation from 8.6% in 1996 to 30.0% in 2015.  \n \n12. \nAccording  to  the  updated  RWSS  sector  investment  plan,  about  $53.5  million  in  capital \ninvestment and $4.8 million in recurrent costs is required to reach these CMDGs. An estimated \n$50.0 million in capital investment has been committed to the sector from 2008 to 2015, leaving \na funding gap of $3.5 million.13 Of the $50.0 million, ADB will have provided more than 50% of \nthe  overall  financing  needs  from  2008  to  2015.  Total  capital  investment  to  attain  the \nGovernment\u2019s 100% coverage goal by 2025 is about $528 million, or $246 million from 2016 to \n2020 and $282 million from 2021 to 2025.14 External and government financing is also needed \nfor  capacity  development  of  RWSS  staff,  community  hygiene  education  and  awareness,  and \nsanitation materials and equipment. A sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n13. \nSector  Definitions  and  Service  Levels. Targets in the CMDGs are originally presented \nin  terms  of  access  to  \u201csafe\u201d  water,  but  this  changed  in  interpretation  in  2003  to  access  to \n\u201cimproved\u201d  water.  National  surveys  and  RWSS  databases  in  Cambodia  do  not  identify  \u201csafe\u201d \nsources  in  terms  of  water  quality;  instead,  they  distinguish  between  improved  and  unimproved \nsupplies  or \nthe \nrecommendations  of  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  and  UNICEF  Joint  Monitoring \nProgramme  on  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  (JMP)15 that  an  improved  drinking  water  source  is \ndefined as a drinking water source or delivery point that, by nature of its construction and design, \nis  likely  to  protect  the  water  source  from  outside  contamination,  particularly  from  fecal  matter. \nAccess to water is enhanced if water is available from an improved source within 150 meters from \nthe user's dwelling. Adequate service levels are 20 liters per capita per day, all year, within 150 \nmeters of the source or to 25 households. Additionally, a household needs to store about 3,000 \nliters of rainwater to meet drinking and cooking water needs through the dry season. An improved \ndrinking  water  source  includes  (i)  piped  water  to  a  dwelling,  plot,  or  yard;  (ii)  a  public  tap  or \nstandpipe; (iii) a drilled well; (iv) a protected (lined and covered) dug well; (v) a protected spring; \nand (vi) rainwater collection. Additionally, MRD and MOP consider protected ponds with filtration \nto be an improved drinking water source. \n \n14. \nAn improved sanitation facility is defined as one that hygienically separates human feces \nfrom  human  contact.  MRD  and  MOP  use  the  classifications  suggested  by  JMP  to  differentiate \nimproved sanitation facilities. Sanitation facilities are not considered improved when shared with \nother  households  or  when  open  for  public  use.  Improved  sanitation  facilities  include  (i)  flush  or \n\nthe  Ministry  of  Planning  (MOP)  have  adopted \n\nfacilities.

MRD notes that a dry-pit latrine is \nconsidered improved if it has a concrete ring-lined pit. \n \n15.  MRD  tests  the  water  quality  of  all  water  supply  points  constructed  in  accordance  with \nWHO  and  Cambodian  guidelines,  including  initial  site  testing  for  six  physical  and  chemical \nparameters16 and one test for the presence of fecal coliforms. Water samples are tested at the \ntime  of  drilling,  and  then  water  quality  tests  are  completed  against  the  full  16  parameters  (as \napproved  by  Cambodian  national  water  quality  standards)  at  the  handover  of  the  wells  to \ncommunities. Findings are recorded in the MRD RWSS database, previously established under \nthe Tonle Sap Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project (TSRWSSP).17  \n \nKey  Sector  Institutions.  MRD  is  responsible  for  RWSS.  Within  MRD,  DRWS  is \n16. \nresponsible  for  rural  water  supply,  and  the  Department  of  Rural  Health  Care  (DRHC)  is \nresponsible  for  rural  sanitation  and  hygiene.  Water  and  sanitation  user  groups  (WSUGs)  are \nvillage  groups,  comprising  about  20\u201325  households,  which  are  formed  for  each  water  supply \nfacility  or  water  point.  Each  WSUG  elects  a  five-person  board  (of  which  40%  are  women)  to \noperate  and  maintain  each  water  supply  facility.  District  technical  officers  support  WSUGs  in \noperation and maintenance (O&M), including water quality testing and monitoring. The Ministry of \nIndustry, Mines and Energy is responsible for urban water supply and for regulating the private \nsector in piped water supply systems. In 2005, a memorandum of understanding between MRD \nand  the  Ministry  of  Industry,  Mines  and  Energy  helped  clarify  the  overlap  between  the  two \nministries  regarding  piped  water  systems;  MRD  is  thus  responsible  for  community  systems  of \n250 households or less. The Council for Agriculture and Rural Development also coordinates with \nMRD  and  other  ministries  involved  in  the  Government's  priority  sectors  of  agriculture  and  rural \ndevelopment.  The  Department  of  Preventive  Medicine  in  the  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH)  is \ndeveloping  a  national  environmental  health  action  plan  in  cooperation  with  other  line  ministries \nand  the  DHRC  director  is  the  co-chair  of  the  subtechnical  working  group  in  MOH.  MOP  is \nresponsible  for  (i)  guiding  and  managing  national  socioeconomic  development  planning,  (ii)  the \nGovernment\u2019s  statistical  functions,  and  (iii)  monitoring  and  implementing  plans  and  national \nprograms in all sectors, including the achievement toward the CMDGs targets for RWSS. \n \nADB  Country  Strategy  and  Program. ADB's long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 \n17. \n(Strategy 2020) recognizes that a lack of effective infrastructure undermines the well being of rural \ncommunities  and  notes  the  need  to  continue  to  invest  in  rural  infrastructure. 18  The  country \noperations business plan for Cambodia 2008\u2013201019 focuses on enhancing rural development to \nfoster more pro-poor growth and to accelerate poverty reduction, especially around the Tonle Sap \nBasin.  It  includes  interventions  for  increasing  the  poor's  access  to  RWSS,  while  strengthening \nlocal community capacity in the management of facilities. The ongoing TSRWSSP is one of the \nbest-performing  projects  in  ADB's  Cambodia  portfolio  based  on  the  project  performance  report. \nADB support to the RWSS sector is (i) embedded into its overarching commitment to support the \nGovernment achieve its CMDGs; (ii) justified, as more than 80% of the total population lives in the \nrural area; and (iii) complementary to the delivery of  water supply and sanitation services along \nthe  economic  corridors  and  in  the  border  towns.  The  Project  (i)  complements  existing  ADB \ncapacity  development  activities  under  the  Tonle  Sap  initiative  and  the  public  financial \n\n                                                 \n16 Includes total dissolved solids, turbidity, pH, iron, and arsenic with either fluoride or manganese additional options. \n17 ADB.  2005.

The  Project  is  in  the  country \noperations business plan as a grant project for 2009. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n18. \nTransfer of Functions from MRD to Subnational Levels Remains Unclear. The roles \nand  responsibilities  of  line  agencies  in  relation  to  service  delivery,  the  Ministry  of  Interior,  and \ncommune councils remain unclear.  MRD is  responsible for  rural  development, including  RWSS, \nthrough its line agencies; however, MRD is not represented at the commune level and relies on \nthe district officer of rural development for outreach activities. Moreover, the Ministry of Interior is \nresponsible  for  the  administration  of  subnational  organizations  through  its  network  of  selected \nheads of provinces and districts and elected heads of communes and  villages.  Once commune \ninvestment  plans  are  submitted  to  the  provinces,  the  district  organizes  a  district  integration \nworkshop  to  review  and  discuss  the  submitted  plans.21 While  the  Organic  Law  (2008)  requires \ngreater  participation  of  the  subnational  structure,  including  commune  councils,  implementation \nprakas  (subdecrees)  are  not  yet  in  place  to  support  implementation.  The  Project  aims  to  work \nwithin the broad decentralization and deconcentration framework, with a comprehensive review of \nthe  implementation  arrangements  completed  during  midterm  review.  It  will  also  support \ninstitutional reform for improved RWSS service delivery.  \n \n19. \nLimited  Focus  on  Rehabilitation.  A  limited  focus  on  rehabilitation  of  water  supply \nfacilities  contributed  to  the  TSRWSSP  inability  to  reach  its  initial  coverage  targets.  Failure  to \nrehabilitate  facilities  may  be  attributed  to  a  lack  of  (i)  clarity  over  the  legal  ownership  of  water \nfacilities, and (ii) government  financing for  O&M (or recurrent costs). During project preparation, \nabout  5%  of  the  300,000  water  facilities  found  in  eight  northwest  provinces  of  Cambodia  (six \nProject provinces, Oddar Meanchey, and Preah Vihear) are inoperative. If half of the facilities are \nrehabilitated, close to 300,000 households (or 1.5 million people) could be provided with access to \nan  improved  water  source. 22    Total  Government  allocation  for  rehabilitation  of  water  supply \nfacilities in 2009 is about $0.439 million\u2014about $4.4 million short of the amount estimated in the \nupdated  sector  investment  plan.  The  Project  prioritizes  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  existing \nwater  facilities  prior  to  grant  disbursement  for  construction  of  any  new  water  facility.  MRD  has \nprioritized  rehabilitation  and  issued  a  letter  to  the  provincial  governors  to  help  clarify  the  legal \nownership and responsibility of water facility O&M in rural areas.  \n \n20. \nLimited  Government  Budget  for  the  Sector.  The  limited  Government  budget  will \nprevent  it  from  achieving  the  CMDG  targets  for  RWSS  by  2015  and  its  sector  goals  by  2025. \nAlthough  current  budget  allocation  levels  are  increasing,  the  levels  are  insufficient  to  cover  the \ntotal investment required. The national budget allocation from 2008 to 2009 increased by 77% for \nrural  water  supply  from  about  $0.443  million  to  $0.784  million,  and  increased  by  52%  for  rural \nsanitation from about $0.174 million to $0.265 million. The level of actual expenditure for RWSS \nranges  from  97%  to  100%  of  the  total  budget  allocated  to  MRD.  The  Government  recently \nincreased its commitment to the sector by allocating $18.6 million from the International Monetary \n\n                                                 \n20 ADB.  2007.

Manila (Grants 0132 and 0133-CAM, $41,000,000, approved on 8 December).   \n\n21  The  Ministry  of  Interior  is  taking  steps  to  clarify  these  budget  and  planning  documents,  and  is  coordinating  this \n\nthrough the National Committee for Subnational Democratic Development. \n\n22  15,000 water facilities are rehabilitated and each facility supplies water to 20 households (or 100 persons).  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\nFund Debt Relief Fund for RWSS development in 13 provinces. The Project will complement the \nGovernment's current investment levels, support MRD to improve its overall planning and budget \nin the sector, and emphasize rehabilitation of existing water facilities.  \n \nLimited  Private  Sector  Participation.  Increased  access  to  improved  RWSS  facilities, \n21. \nparticularly household latrines, relies heavily on the private sector. District- and commune-level \nentrepreneurs are keen to manufacture sanitation parts and to construct water supply facilities, \nbut they usually lack the basic knowledge and equipment. Further, more established contracting \nfirms, with their own well drilling rigs, lack competent rig supervisors, and some rigs have limited \nperformance. Although DRWS has established a licensing system for drilling companies, which \nprequalifies  them  to  bid  on  TSRWSSP  contracts,  there  is  room  for  improvement  in  terms  of \nindependent  qualification  of  rig  supervisors  and  certification  of  equipment.  The  Project  will \nin  construction  and \nsupport  private  sector  participation,  especially  small  businesses, \nmanagement of RWSS facilities through training and capacity development activities. \n \n22. \nHigh  Percentage  of  Negative  Wells.  A  high  percentage  of  negative  wells  are  possible \nwhen groundwater conditions are unpredictable in many locations, and drilling contractors are not \npaid for low or nonyielding wells. As a result, contractors place a supplementary price on all wells \nto  cover  the  cost  of  wells  drilled  for  which  they  may  not  get  paid\u2014increasing  the  unit  cost  of \nsuccessful wells and clouding the data on unsuccessful wells. Out of the 3,441 constructed drilled \nwells  under  the  TSRWSSP,  2,899  wells  were  successful  and  542  wells  were  abandoned.  This \nassumed high failure rate of 15.75% is comparable to the rate of 12.50% in the Essarn region of \nThailand.23 The Project will support improved well-drilling technology by encouraging suppliers of \nwell-drilling  consumables  (drilling  fluids,  lubricants,  well  screens  and  drill  bits)  to  promote  their \nproducts in Cambodia through \u201con-the-drilling-rig\u201d training to rig operators. It will also encourage \ngroundwater  testing  (to  100  meters)  be  completed  as  part  of  the  contractor's  bid.  The  Project \nincludes  a  provisional  budget  for  groundwater  testing  in  difficult  areas  (ranging  from  100  to  200 \nmeters deep), where contractors do not have the expertise or equipment. Data will be recorded in \nthe existing groundwater database previously established under the TSRWSSP. \n \n23. \nNeed  for  Improved  Coordination  between  DRWS  and  DHRC. DRWS and DRHC are \nboth  engaged  in  sanitation  and  hygiene  promotion,  which  has  led  to  different  approaches  in \nhousehold  sanitation.  In  part,  these  divisions  have  been  exasperated  by  the  alignment  of \ndevelopment partners toward either rural water supply or rural sanitation. An integrated approach \nto water supply, sanitation and hygiene, and community health is essential to the success of each. \nThe TSRWSSP is attempting to bring the two departments together,24 but the recent geographical \nseparation  of  DRWS  and  DRHC  has  added  to  the  problem.  While  the  DRWS  compound  is  an \nideal site for the storage of materials and equipment, it is out of the mainstream of MRD activity \nand  limits  coordination  between  the  two  departments.  To  improve  coordination,  MRD  has \nappointed  one  deputy  director  of  DRHC  and  two  staff  members  to  work  full-time  in  the  project \ncoordination unit (PCU) at DRWS. The director of DRHC will continue to serve as a member of \nthe project steering committee and advisor on sanitation activities. \n \n24. \nUnclear  Parameters  in  Selecting  Water  Supply  Options.  The  menu  of  water  supply \ntechnical  options  under  the  TSRWSSP  has  been  reviewed  to  determine  whether  communities \nselected  options  based  on  affordability  or  preference.  The  menu  contained  seven  options, \n                                                 \n23  Well-drillers in the Essarn region report a negative well rate of 12.5% using sophisticated equipment, groundwater \n\ndata, and expertise. The region shares the same complex hydrogeological regime as the Tonle Sap Basin. \n\n24  Actions  included  (i)  seconding  two  staff  members  from  DRHC  as  members  of  the  project  management  unit, \nincluding the DHRC director as the sanitation advisor to the project management unit; and (ii) promoting the role of \nthe DRHC director as a member of the project steering committee.  \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\nalthough  the  most  common  selected  was  drilled  wells.  The  parameters  for  selecting  one  option \nover  another  were  unclear.  The  Project  clarifies  these  parameters25 and  emphasizes  improved \nwater management at the source, during transport, and in the home.  \n \nNeed  to  Refine  the  Sanitation  Approach.  Sanitation  coverage  in  some  TSRWSSP \n25. \nvillages averaged only about 20%. The pour-flush latrine was the most common type of latrine \nselected, but it also required the highest level of household contribution (60% of the total cost). \nOut of the 37,172 latrines contracted, about 73% was either a water-sealed or pour-flush latrine. \nIn fact, many villagers opted to remain without a latrine until they could afford to contribute their \nshare  of  the  cost.  The  sanitation  cost-sharing  ladder  that  was  developed  for  the  TSRWSSP \nincluded  10  design  options  of  four  basic  toilet  types\u2014dry-pit,  ventilation  improved  pit,  water-\nsealed,  and  pour-flush.  A  review  found  that  this  sanitation  ladder  may  have  been  a  barrier  to \nhousehold sanitation improvements, as the cost of the superstructure was calculated as part of \nthe total latrine cost. The Project will support MRD's vision of informed choice for sanitation, and \nprovide a sanitation grant to each household covering the cost of an improved and hygienic dry-\npit latrine with a concrete ring-lined pit (subground structure only). The sanitation grant may be \napplied  to  the  construction  of  a  water-sealed  or  a  pour-flush  latrine  based  on  household \npreference and affordability levels.  \n \n26. \nThe  Project  will  also  draw  elements  from  the  community-led  total  sanitation  (CLTS) \napproach  followed  by  project  support  for  latrine  construction.26 Key  findings  from  an  evaluation \nshowed that CLTS (i) is effective but generally in the dry season, (ii) promotes behavior change, \nand (iii) contributes to institutional capacity building.27 It also found that CLTS is not sustainable in \nsome areas, as the commonly-built latrine (unlined dry-pit) is not durable and is prone to failure \nfrom flooding, loose soil conditions, termites and ants, and constant use. While CLTS advocates \nno subsidies for latrine construction, DRHC believes that (i) support is required to help sustain the \nbehavior-change  aspects  and  to  overcome  the  social,  economic,  technical,  and  institutional \nbarriers  to  the  construction  of  sanitation  facilities;  (ii)  support  for  latrine  construction  may  start \nbefore  a  village  achieves  100%  open  defecation-free  status,  as  there  is  a  \"learning  by  seeing\" \neffect; and (iii) the total cost of the latrine should not include the cost of the superstructure. The \nTSRWSSP  incorporated  sanitation  and  hygiene  messages  into  its  community  mobilization \nactivities. The Project will continue this effort and has opted to employ a CLTS\u2013hybrid approach. \nDetails are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n27. \nLimited Role of Women in the Sector. Under the TSRWSSP, structural changes\u2014which \ncould influence sanitation behavior and support men to accept women\u2019s stronger roles in decision \nmaking and planning\u2014have had limited success to date. While women officially comprise at least \ntwo  positions  in  the  five-person  WSUG  boards,  real  decision  making  is  limited  to  the  socially \naccepted  domain  of  village  leaders  (who  are  mostly  older,  literate  men).  Further,  female \nilliteracy\u2014about  43%  of  women  in  Cambodia  are  illiterate\u2014remains  a  core  constraint  to \ntechnical  aspects  of  community-managed  procurement.  The  TSRWSSP \nparticipation \ndeveloped  several  visual  materials  for  education  and  instruction.  The  Project  will  continue  to \npromote  and  encourage  women's  role  in  the  sector  through  peer-to-peer  communications  and \nprovide support to commune council committees for women and children (which will support the \nProject's sanitation and behavior-change initiatives). \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n25 For instance, household filters are provided when a protected pond with filtration is selected. Two jumbo jars with lids \n\nand taps are provided when rainwater collection systems are selected. \n\n26  In Cambodia, the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom, UNICEF, and World Bank's WSP \n\nare partners that support CLTS and nonsubsidy approaches.  \n\n27  Sok,  K.  and  Catalla,  R.N.F. 2009.Community-Led  Total  Sanitation  in  Cambodia:  Final  Evaluation  Report.

Limited  coordination  between  MRD  and \nMOH  in  monitoring  health  impacts  of  RWSS  is  largely  due  to  health  districts  (or  operational \ndistricts) not coinciding geographically with the administrative districts of the province. MOH, at the \nsubhealth district level, also does not follow commune boundaries with the subdistrict subdivision. \nThe  monitoring  of RWSS coverage  and community  health  improvements, specifically water  and \nsanitation-related diseases, will be an important aspect of the project performance management \nsystem (PPMS). The TSRWSSP supported the development  of  the PPMS, but the collection  of \nhealth  data  has  been  limited.  The  Project,  therefore,  will  support  mechanisms  for  improving  the \nmonitoring  of  health  impacts,  including  early  coordination  with  the  MOH;  identification  of \nappropriate health centers nearest to the selected communes; and recruitment of an international \nnongovernment organization (NGO) to collect baseline, midterm, and final project data. \n \n29. \nKey  Lessons  in  the  Sector.  Lessons are drawn from RWSS and other projects in rural \ndevelopment,  including  the  TSRWSSP  and  the  Northwest  Rural  Development  Project. 28 The \nProject,  building  on  the  TSRWSSP  design,  increases  support  to  strengthen  project  staff  in \ncommunity outreach activities focused on effective behavior change linked to water management \nand sanitation practices. It emphasizes consolidating village water supply and sanitation plans into \nsubproject  commune  feasibility  studies  for  better  design,  selection  of  technical  options,  and \nimplementation.  It  also  strengthens  the  capacity  of  district  officers  of  rural  development  in \ncoordinating  activities  at  the  commune  and  village  levels.  It  supports  the  decentralization  and \ndeconcentration process by strengthening NGO\u2013provincial department of rural development (i.e., \nPDRD)  partnerships  to  support  activities  at  the  commune,  village,  and  household  levels.  It  also \nencourages  private  sector  participation  in  construction  of  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities. \nThe  Project  focuses  on  rehabilitation  of  failed  or  inefficient  water  facilities  as  a  cost-effective \nmeans of achieving greater service coverage. It promotes improved water safety and use in three \nstages\u2014at  the  water  source,  during  transport,  and  in  the  home\u2014and  better  sanitation  and \nhygiene  practices  in  the  home,  schools,  and  health  facilities.  Additional  lessons  are  listed  in \nSupplementary Appendix C.  \n \n30. \nKey  Development  Partners  in  the  Sector.  ADB  is  a  key  player  in  investing  in  RWSS \ninfrastructure  development  with  the  ongoing  TSRWSSP  and  other  rural  development  and \nagricultural  projects. ADB served  as first lead  facilitator  of the TWG-RWSSH. Together with the \nDepartment  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom,  UNICEF,  and  World  Bank's \nWater  and  Sanitation  Program,  ADB  is  supporting  the  development  of  a  national  RWSS  and \nhygiene  strategy.  The  Government  has  allocated  $18.6  million\u2014about  23%  of  the  total \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  debt  relief  initiative  ($82  million)  to  support  a  RWSS  project  in  13 \nprovinces  following  the  original  TSRWSSP  project  design.  The  World  Bank-supported  RWSS \nactivities under its Northeast Village Development Project and its Water and Sanitation Program \nsupports sector studies, showcases best practices, provides small-scale technical assistance, and \nsupports  preparation of a water supply and sanitation sector investment plan for urban and rural \nareas. UNICEF supports RWSS improvements and CLTS. Other partners include the WHO and \nseveral international and national NGOs. External assistance to the sector is in Appendix 3. \n \n\n                                                 \n28 ADB.  2001.

Manila  (Loan  1862-CAM,  $34,630,000, \napproved on 27 November). \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  of  the  Project  is  to  expand  access  to  improved  RWSS  nationwide,  and  to \n31. \nbetter  the  health  of  rural  households  in  the  project  provinces.  It  will  contribute  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts in achieving the CMDG targets for RWSS in 2015 and sector goals in 2025 \nby increasing access to improved rural water supply from 55.4% in 2007 to 75.0% in 2020 and \nimproved sanitation from 19.6% in 2007 to 50.0% in 2020. It will reduce under-5 child mortality by \nan  average  of  20  deaths  per  1,000  live  births  in  each  project  province.  The  outcome  of  the \nProject is to improve access to water supply for about 377,000 rural residents and sanitation for \nabout 290,000 rural residents in an estimated 400 villages in 40 communes.  \n \n32. \nThe Project will continue ADB's assistance in increasing access to improved RWSS in the \nfive original provinces under the TSRWSSP (Battambang, Kampong Chhnang, Kampong Thom, \nPursat,  and  Siem  Reap).  With  the  additional  financing  available,  the  Project  will  expand  into  an \nadditional province, Banteay Meanchey. The 40 communes are located in 16 districts, six of which \noverlap with the TSRWSSP. The Project will cover 100% of all villages in each commune and will \naim to achieve 100% water supply and 75% physical sanitation coverage in each commune. In \ncomparison,  the  TSRWSSP  adopted  a  village-level  approach,  which  is  implemented  in  919 \nvillages  in  113  communes.  It  aims  to  achieve  about  70%  water  supply  and  30%  sanitation \ncoverage in each village. \n  \n33. \nThe Project will be designed as a sector investment project, whereby a subproject is a \ncommune.29 It meets the criteria for sector lending as (i) the Government\u2019s 2003 national policy \nremains valid and relevant; (ii) an update of the 2005 sector investment plan is in place; and (iii) \nMRD,  the  Executing  Agency,  has  sufficient  capacity  to  implement  RWSS  projects.  A  financial \nmanagement assessment has been completed for MRD and participating PDRDs. The project \ndesign  is  based  on  detailed  preparation  of  two  sample  subproject  communes  (Kbal  Trach  in \nPursat  and  Bos  Sbov  in  Banteay  Meanchey),  which  are  representative  of  other  communes \nregarding type of interventions and impacts.30 Description of physical works for the two sample \nsubprojects is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n34. \nA  total  of  459  communes  in  six  provinces  were  ranked  according  to  criteria  including \npoverty, coverage of household water supply and sanitation, basic access to RWSS, and RWSS \nactivities of development partners in the commune. A list of 65 communes in six provinces was \nthen prepared; however, financing is available only for 40 first-ranked communes (Appendix 2 and \nSupplementary  Appendix  E).  The  order  in  which  subprojects  will  be  executed  during  project \nimplementation will be determined by agreement between the Government and ADB, depending \non  (i)  their  ranking  according  to  the  above  selection  criteria;  (ii)  readiness  of  the  respective \nprovincial  and  district  line  agencies  and  governments,  commune  councils,  and  villages  to \nimplement the subprojects, and compliance with the agreed eligibility criteria (Appendix 4); (iii) at \nleast 90% of households in each rural village are prepared to participate in subproject activities; \nand (iv) geographical grouping of the subprojects to minimize costs and maximize implementation \nefficiency.  Subprojects  may  be  implemented  as  soon  as  communes  are  ready;  however,  for \nreasons  of  cost,  efficiency,  and  expediency,  it  is  expected  that  they  will  be  prepared  and \nimplemented in six batches. \n                                                 \n29 A  subproject  is  defined  as  a  rural  commune,  which  may  include  an  average  of  10  villages  each  and  about  9,000 \n\npersons (ranging from 3,000 to 19,000 persons). The size of each subproject is about $470,000. \n\n30  The  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  also  prepared  a  sample  subproject  for  Pal  Hal  commune  in  Preah \nVihear, but the province was subsequently removed due to the need to focus the geographical area of the Project. \n\n\f \n\nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n\nis \n\nindicative  community  mobilization  plan \n\n35. \nThe  Project  has  five  outputs  (i)  improved  community  health  and  hygiene  practices;  (ii) \nrehabilitated,  upgraded,  and  developed  water  facilities;  (iii)  improved  public  and  household \nsanitation;  (iv)  strengthened  sector  planning  and  development;  and  (v)  improved  capacity  for \nproject implementation. The sequencing of outputs and activities is in Appendix 5.  \n \n36. \nOutput  1:  Improved  community  health  and  hygiene  practices  will  be  delivered \nthrough (i) increased community mobilization and action, (ii) preparation of village water supply \nand sanitation plans, (iii) formation and training of WSUGs, (iv) strengthened community groups \nand  individuals  for  effective  delivery  of  health  and  hygiene  messages,  and  (v)  improved \nhousehold  management  of  RWSS.  An \nin \nSupplementary Appendix F \n \n37. \nThe  Project  will  promote  community  participation  and  ownership  in  technology  choice, \nplanning, and implementation of improved village RWSS facilities and in better household water \nmanagement and hygiene education. It will focus on improving a community's understanding of \nthe  importance  of  improved  health  outcomes  brought  about  by  water  supply,  sanitation,  and \nhygiene  through  the  CLTS-hybrid  approach.  Rural  residents  will  be  equipped  with  the  tools \nnecessary  to  change  their  own  behavior.  Individuals  considered  champions  or  natural  leaders \nby their peers will be identified and trained as lead facilitators for peer-to-peer behavior-change \nefforts  in  safe  water  use,  improved  sanitation,  and  proper  hygiene.  The  Project  will  support \nwomen's participation and their role as the main users and managers of water in households. At \nleast 50% of all lead facilitators will be women. \n \n38. \nThe  Project  will  help  WSUGs  plan  and  develop  RWSS  facilities.  Group  members  will \nreceive training in O&M and repair. At least 40% of all board members, and 50% of those trained \nin O&M, will be women. A user-friendly approach will be used, which takes into account gender \nissues  and  cultures  and  languages  of  ethnic  groups.  PDRD  project  teams  in  each  participating \nprovince will partner with an NGO team in implementing this output. Existing hygiene education \nmaterials will be used, and links to the activities of other organizations will be established.  \n \nThe Project will integrate elements of CLTS in the overall village engagement process to \n39. \nfocus on RWSS and hygiene. Although the TSRWSSP followed a village engagement process, \nit  seemed  to  introduce  project  support  for  latrines  too  quickly  without  allowing  communities  to \ndemonstrate their commitment to improved hygiene behavior and sanitation practices. Further, \nthe  CLTS  approach  in  Cambodia  tends  to  focus  solely  on  sanitation  and  misses  out  on  the \nimportance  of  safe  water  use  and  its  complementary  benefits.  The  Project  will  work  with \nWSUGs,  villages, communes, schools, and other social groups to communicate information on \nRWSS.  Behavior-change  efforts  will  focus  on  (i)  safe  water  management  at  the  source,  during \ntransport, and in the household; and (ii) stopping open defecation, encouraging proper use and \nmaintenance  of  household  latrines,  and  promoting  personal  hygiene  practices  (e.g.,  hand \nwashing  and  clean  bodies).  The  Project  will  support  latrine  construction  in  stages  through  the \ncommunity procurement model that was piloted under the TSRWSSP. It builds on the \"learning \nby  seeing\"  effect  and  allows  households  to  build  latrines  in  stages.  The  CLTS\u2013hybrid  for \nachieving health outcomes is detailed in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \n40. \nOutput  2:  Rehabilitated,  upgraded,  and  developed  water  facilities  will  be  delivered \nthrough  (i)  existing  water  supply  points  rehabilitated  or  upgraded  to  improved  water  supply \nfacilities;  (ii)  new,  improved  water  supply  points  are  developed;  and  (iii)  improved  monitoring  of \nwater  quality  for  all  water  facilities.  Beneficiary  contributions  will  not  be  collected  from  those \n\n \n\n\f 12 \n\nhouseholds opting to rehabilitate or upgrade existing wells. New construction will be based on the \ncost-sharing principles adopted by the TSRWSSP.31 \n \n41. \nThe  Project  will  support  the  (i)  rehabilitation  and  construction  of  deep  drilled  wells;  (ii) \nupgrading,  rehabilitation,  and  construction  of  hand-dug  wells;  (iii)  construction  of  combined \nwells, where a drilled well is constructed inside a hand-dug well to improve access of the well to \naquifers; (iv) rehabilitation (desilting), upgrading, and construction of existing ponds where water \nwill  be  filtered  prior  to  human  consumption  (together  with  household  filters);  and  (v)  rainwater \ncollection  through  two  jumbo  jars  in  households  and  schools.  Small  community-based  piped \nwater supply systems for less than 250 households will be considered on a case-by-case basis.  \n \n42. \nNew  drilled  wells  will  be  based  on  communities'  knowledge  of  sufficient  quantity  and \nquality  of  water  sources,  but  actual  site  selection  for  deep  well  construction  will  be  based  on \nhydrogeological testing. The costs of groundwater testing will be included in the drilling contract, \nas all contractors have the equipment and ability to drill up to 100 meters. In more difficult areas, \nthe  Project  will  support  initial  groundwater  testing  for  wells  100\u2013200  meters  deep;  this  will  be \nlimited  to  one  site  per  commune.  A  least-cost  analysis  will  be  part  of  the  subproject  feasibility \nreport, which will help determine the most appropriate water supply technology to be supported by \nthe Project and will help reduce the number of negative wells. \n \nAbandoned, existing drilled wells will be considered for rehabilitation by repairing the well \n43. \nor replacing the pump (or parts of it). When shallow groundwater of acceptable quality is available, \nnew  hand-dug  wells  with  manual  suction  pumps  may  be  constructed.  To  qualify  as  improved \nwater sources, these dug wells must be lined and covered to avoid contamination. Existing dug \nwells may be rehabilitated by lining the well, covering the well, fitting a hand pump, draining the \narea  around  the  well,  or  a  combination  of  these  measures.  Rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of \nexisting facilities will be limited to 30% of the cost of a new facility. \n \nThe Project will support one 16 parameter water quality test and three annual six parameter \n44. \nwater quality tests for all water facilities. It also will support improvements in well-drilling technology \nas  a  means  of  improving  drilling  efficiency,  well  quality,  and  the  incidence  of  successful  wells. \nDuring the construction of deep drilled wells, the six parameter test will be conducted. If the water \nis found to be unsuitable, the well will not be developed further. Technical options for rural water \nsupply facilities are in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n45. \nOutput  3:  Improved  public  and  household  sanitation  will  be  delivered  through  (i) \nconstruction of public latrines at schools and health facilities (five per commune), and (ii) provision \nof household latrines. Public latrines will follow the following cost-sharing principles: 80% project, \n10% beneficiary contribution in kind, and 10% government contribution in cash.  \n \nThe Project will support the construction and improvement of latrines in public areas to \n46. \nhelp  strengthen  hygiene  awareness  and  behavioral  change.  Each  commune  will  be  able  to \nprioritize public latrine facilities (four latrines at each facility) in five locations (schools or health \nfacilities). Public latrines will be constructed in separate areas for men and women to respond to \nthe  privacy  needs  of  women  (i.e.,  two-latrine  block  for  men  and  two-latrine  block  for  women). \nPrior  to  construction,  the  PDRD  will  sign  an  O&M  agreement  with  the  WSUG  board  (or  the \nrelevant school or health committee). The agreement will outline the terms and conditions of the \n\n                                                 \n31  The Project will provide financing for 90% of the total cost of the water facility, and beneficiaries will contribute the \n\nremaining 10%, of which 3% will be in cash and 7% in kind. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\narrangement,  cost-sharing  principles,  agreement  to  carry  out  hygiene  and  awareness \ncampaigns, and detailed plans for continuous O&M. \n \n47. \nThe  Project  will  promote  informed  choice  of  sanitation  facilities  based  on  a  range  of \noptions. It will provide each household with a sanitation grant of $75 (equivalent to the current cost \nof  providing  the  substructure  of  an  improved  dry-pit  latrine  with  a  concrete  ring-lined  pit).  The \nProject  will  support  this  minimum  standard  latrine,  as  it  is  the  most  cost-effective,  hygienic, \ndurable,  and  upgradable  to  a  water-sealed  or  pour-flush  latrine  at  minimum  cost.  The  average \ncost of an improved dry-pit latrine is $115,32 and the Project will cover the cost of materials and \nconstruction  of  four  rings  and  cement  slabs,  including  supervision  fees.  Beneficiaries  will  be \nresponsible for the remaining cost in kind for digging the pit and construction of the superstructure. \nHouseholds  that  prefer  water-sealed  or  pour-flush  latrines  will  be  required  to  contribute  the \ndifference  in  cost  of  the  substructure  in  cash.  Technical  options  for  rural  sanitation  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix G.  \n \n48. \nOutput 4: Strengthened sector planning and development will be delivered through \n(i)  improved  monitoring  and  supervision  of  RWSS  facilities  by  maintaining  and  upgrading  the \nRWSS  database  that  was  established  by  the  TSRWSSP  in  five  provinces,  and  establishing  the \ndatabase in the new province, (ii) support to the water and sanitation (WATSAN) sectoral working \ngroup  coordination  meetings,  (iii)  strengthened  private  sector \nin  RWSS \ndevelopment  through  training  in  technical  and  management  fields,  and  (iv)  improved  RWSS \nmonitoring and evaluation (M&E) for health outcomes.  \n \n49. \nThe Project will support small entrepreneurs for local manufacturing of precast concrete \ncomponents,  particularly  pit  and  well  rings,  toilet  slabs,  and  jumbo  jars.  It  will  assist  in \nestablishing a small contractor base at the commune level for the construction of protected dug \nwells and rainwater storage tanks, extending the knowledge of polyvinyl chloride suction-pump \ntechnology,  and  developing  capacity  with  commune-based  mechanics  to  support  WSUGs  in \ntheir responsibility for the repair and maintenance of hand pumps. It will also support well-drilling \ncontractors  in  the  form  of  on-the-job  training  for  improved  well-drilling  technology  to  increase \noverall success rates and efficiency. Although registered contractors with MRD (a total of 50) will \nhave  priority  to  participate  in  this  training,  PDRD  technical  staff  and  new  contractors  that  are \nwilling to register will be encouraged to attend. \n \n50. \nThe  Project  will  recruit  an  international  NGO  to  undertake  a  baseline  survey,  midterm \nevaluation, and final evaluation to help measure the project outcome and outputs. The NGO will \nbe required to adapt and expand the PPMS for the new project, and provide a training package to \nM&E officers within MRD, PDRDs, and commune councils for effective collection of data. This will \nresult in reduced overall costs of M&E activities, as data for the midterm and final evaluations will \nbe readily available. The NGO will employ a randomized sample survey in the project communes, \nand will include control groups to help determine the impact of RWSS on health outcomes.  \n \n51. \nOutput  5:  Improved  capacity  for  project  implementation will  be delivered  through (i) \nproject  orientation  workshops  at  the  national  and  subnational  levels;  and  (ii)  a  capacity \ndevelopment program for MRD, PDRDs, district offices of rural development, commune councils, \nRWSS committees,33 and WSUGs. National and subnational project orientation workshops will be \n\ninvolvement \n\n                                                 \n32  Includes the cost of labor for excavating the pit ($15), materials for the four rings ($44), materials for a cement slab \n\n($12), construction costs ($13), supervision costs ($5), and materials for construction of the building ($26).  \n\n33 A RWSS committee will be established at the village level, comprising of one representative for rural water supply and \n\none person for sanitation from each WSUG. It builds on the sanitation committees under the TSRWSSP. \n\n \n\n\f 14 \n\nconducted  to  inform  key  stakeholders  about  the  project  design  and  eligibility  of  communes  to \nparticipate  in  the  Project.  Capacity  development  will  focus  on  improving  project  implementation \npractices,  including  social  and  gender  awareness  training,  planning  and  budgeting,  and \naccounting and bookkeeping. The Project will involve WSUGs and RWSS committee members to \nhelp  strengthen  their  capacity  in  water  and  sanitation  service  management  and  delivery.  An \ninstitutional  capacity  assessment  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  H  and  an  indicative  capacity \ndevelopment plan in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n52. \nAn Integrated Approach to RWSS and Hygiene Awareness. The Project emphasizes \nan  integrated  approach  to  rural  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  hygiene  awareness.  It  applies  a \ncommune-based  approach  to  Project  implementation.  Full  benefits  of  household  access  to \nimproved  water  cannot be  realized unless  the water  is  managed  properly  between  the  source \nand the home and within the home. Sanitation cannot be achieved without access to water for \nhand and body washing and latrine flushing. Hygiene awareness is the activity that effectively \nlinks water and sanitation and maximizes project benefits. \n \n53. \nStrong  Links  with  Other  ADB  Projects.  The Project has a synergistic relationship with \nADB operations in Cambodia, especially those under the Tonle Sap Initiative. Building Community \nCapacity for Poverty Reduction Initiatives in the Tonle Sap Basin aims to increase the awareness \nof  communities  and  local  governments  on  community-driven  planning  and  implementation  of \nvarious  projects  under  this  Initiative. 34  The  Project  is  also  working  in  communes  that  have \nreceived  support  from  the  Commune  Council  Development  Projects  I  and  II.35 Existing  training \nmodules  developed  within  Cambodia  will  be  reviewed  and  modified  as  required  and  used  as  a \nbasis  for  training  of  trainers  for  focal  persons  groups.  Management  capacity  and  community \nawareness will be enhanced, as the Project will overlap with several communes under the Tonle \nSap Poverty Reduction and Smallholder Development Project (ADB project under preparation).  \n \n54. \nCommunity-Driven Development for RWSS Improvements. Rural infrastructure is one \nof the core  community-driven development sectors.  The Project supports three hallmarks of the \ncommunity-driven development approach (i) local capacity development; (ii) participatory decision \nmaking  (in  site  selection,  technology  choices,  and  O&M  of  community  infrastructure);  and  (iii) \ncommunity control of resources through an innovative community-managed procurement system \nfor  sanitation.  Support  to  community-driven  development  also  includes  developing  community \ngroup  capacity;  supporting  an  enabling  environment  through  policy  and  institutional  reform;  and \nstrengthening local governance relationships, such as by strengthening links between community \norganizations  and  local  government.  By  promoting  community  participation  and  ownership  and \nengaging  commune  councils,  the  Project  will  strengthen  the  institutional  arrangements  for \nplanning, financing, and managing RWSS investments, and will make services more responsive \nand accountable to the poor in the Tonle Sap Basin.  \n \n\n                                                 \n34  ADB.  2007.

MRD will be the Executing Agency for the Project. The current project management unit \nfor  the  TSRWSSP  will  be  expanded,  with  additional  staff  and  resources,  into  a  PCU  within \nDRWS.  The  PCU  will  operate  in  the  same  way  as  the  project  management  unit  for  the \nTSRWSSP.  It  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  policy  and  implementation  coordination  between  MRD \nand  other  national  agencies,  provincial  agencies,  international  development  agencies,  the \nprivate sector, and ADB; (ii) overall project planning and coordination; (iii) setting standards for \ntechnical  design,  construction,  and  quality  of  services;  (iv)  review  and  implementation  of  the \n\n \n\n\f 16 \n\nPPMS;  (v)  participation  in  procurement  committees  in  the  provinces  for  contract  packages  in \nexcess  of  $50,000;  (vi)  supporting  the  awareness  campaign  on  water  use,  sanitation,  and \nhygiene  education;  (vii)  standardization  and  collation  of  project  reports;  and  (viii)  advertising, \nand providing information to the private sector on project business opportunities.  \n\n58. \nThe project steering committee that was established for the TSRWSSP will continue to be \nchaired  by  MRD  secretary  of  state  and  will  provide  oversight  to  the  Project.36 It  will  meet  every \nthree months and handle specific project-related issues, while the TWG-RWSSH handles broader \nsector  issues  at  the  national  level.  MRD  also  participates  on  the  National  Committee  for \nSubnational Democratic Development, which is coordinated by the Ministry of Interior. MRD will \nensure  that  its  representative  who  attends  the  National  Committee  for  Subnational  Democratic \nDevelopment meetings will also attend the project steering committee meetings. The Project will \nuse  the  provincial  rural  development  committees  (or  their  appointed  equivalents)  to  coordinate \nproject activities across line ministries at the provincial level.  \n\n59. \nThe PDRD in each of the six project provinces will establish a team of experienced staff \nmembers  under  the  direction  of  the  PDRD  director  (or  PDRD  deputy  director,  as  delegated). \nThis  team  will  be  known  as  the  PDRD  project  team. The  current  project  implementation  units, \nestablished  in  the  five  TSRWSSP  provinces,  will  be  expanded  with  additional  staff  and \nresources  from  the  PDRDs.  While  each  PDRD  project  team  will  have  the  same  roles  and \nresponsibilities as the project implementation units, it is expected such an arrangement will help \nstrengthen  the  PDRD  as  a  whole.  Each  will  be  responsible  for  the  daily  coordination  and \nimplementation of subproject communes in its respective province.   \n\nThe PDRD project teams will be responsible for (i) liaising with commune councils and \n60. \nWSUGs;  (ii)  selecting  subproject  communes;  (iii)  preparing  provincial  project  implementation \nplans; (iv) carrying out subproject feasibility studies and preparing subproject feasibility reports \n(including  commune  gender  action  plans)  that  will  include  technical  design,  appraisal,  bidding \ndocuments  for  works  (if  required),  and  safeguards  reports  including  land  acquisition, \nenvironmental  screening,  and  initial  environmental  examinations  (if  necessary);  (v)  procuring \nworks; (vi) establishing a procurement committee, chaired by the PDRD director with members \ndrawn from PDRD staff; 37 (vii) implementing land acquisition, resettlement, environmental, and \ngender activities; (viii) providing technical advice to communities for selection and rehabilitation, \nimprovement,  or  development  of  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities  and  their  subsequent \nO&M;  (ix)  implementing  the  awareness  campaign  on  water  use,  sanitation,  and  hygiene \neducation;  (x)  collecting  M&E  data,  and  entering  them  into  the  database;  and  (xi)  preparing \nreports.  Each  PDRD  project  team  will  also  submit  an  annual  training  plan  to  the  PCU  for \nconsolidation  and  submission  to  ADB,  with  an  estimated  budget,  number  of  participants,  and \ntype  of  trainings  within  the  first  quarter  of  each  year.  Prior  to  undertaking  subsequent  training \nactivities,  a  short  report  on  the  training,  number  of  participants  disaggregated  by  sex,  and \noutcomes  of  the  training  will  be  submitted  with  the  new  annual  training  plan.  Implementation \narrangements are in Appendix 7, and detailed arrangements in Supplementary Appendix I.  \n \n\n                                                 \n36  Includes  members  from  MRD  departments  (Rural  Water  Supply,  Rural  Health  Care,  Community  Development, \nTraining, Planning, and Administration and Staff [responsible for gender]), and six PDRD directors). Representatives \nfrom  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  (MEF),  MOH,  Ministry  of  Education,  Youth  and  Sport,  and  the  Council  for \nAgriculture and Rural Development will be invited, as needed. \n\n37  Includes  the  PDRD  procurement  officer,  administration  officer,  and  other  PDRD  staff  members  (as  needed).  The \nproject  consultant  team  leader  or  other  member  may  attend  the  meeting  as  an  observer.  These  practices  operate \nwithin MEF's standard operating procedures, which are in line with ADB and World Bank procurement requirements.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period of  5  years  between  2010  and  2015.  An \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n61. \nimplementation schedule is presented in Appendix 5.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n62. \nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  under  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance \nwith  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  national \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  and  those  described  in  the  agreed \nprocurement plan (Appendix 8). Equipment and material packages valued at $100,000 equivalent \nor more may be procured under national competitive bidding, and those below $100,000 through \nshopping. Works contracts will be awarded under national competitive bidding procedures, due to \nthe small size of contracts. Works contracts for household sanitation with a total value of $5,000 \nequivalent or less can be procured at the commune level and will follow community participation in \nprocurement in accordance with ADB's procedure in implementing small projects with community \nparticipation. A review of the procurement procedures under the TSRWSSP, including the use of \ncommunity  participation  in  procurement,  found  these  to  be  consistent  with  the  requirements  of \nADB.  The  first  works  and  goods  contracts  under  national  competitive  bidding  will  be  subject  to \nprior  review  by  ADB.  All  other  contracts  will  be  subject  to  post-review  by  ADB.  PDRD  project \nteams will also maintain specified documents,38 and will be responsible for preparing the bidding \ndocuments  and  contracts,  chairing  the  procurement  committees,  and  awarding  contracts  for  all \nworks. All work contracts with a total value of $50,000 equivalent or more will require the presence \nof a PCU member on the procurement committee and ADB approval.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n63. \nConsultants  will  be  recruited  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Consulting  services  will  include  recruitment  of  (i)  a \nconsulting  firm,  (ii)  an  international  or  national  NGO  comprising  of  18  national  facilitators  (3 \nfacilitators per PDRD), (iii) service contracts for 12 specialists, and (iv) an international NGO for \nM&E.  The  firm  will  include  consulting  services  at  a  total  of  338  person-months,  of  which  56 \nperson-months  will  be  for  four  international  specialists  and  282  person-months  will  be  for  14 \nnational specialists, including seven national accountant and financial management specialists at \nthe PCU and PDRDs. Consulting services will help support the PCU and PDRD project teams in \nproject management, feasibility studies, design construction, and supervision of water supply and \nsanitation  infrastructure,  accounting,  preparation  of  social  assessments  with  information  on \npoverty,  gender  and  ethnic  groups,  financial  management,  institutional  and  human  resources \ndevelopment,  social  and  community  development,  health  and  hygiene,  involuntary  resettlement \nand  environmental  safeguards,  and  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The \nconsulting  team  will  be  engaged  through  a  firm  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod (80:20). Shortlisted firms will be required to submit a full technical proposal. NGOs will be \nengaged  through quality- and cost-based selection (80:20) or a  quality-based selection  method. \nThe six RWSS engineers (240 person-months) and six community development facilitators (288 \nperson-months) will be engaged as needed, as individual consultants under time-based contracts.  \n \n64. \nIn  addition  to  the  firm,  the  PCU  will  also  recruit  an  international  or  a  national  NGO  to \nsupply 18 national facilitators (a team comprising of 3 facilitators per each PDRD) to assist with \n\n                                                 \n38 Including the village water supply and sanitation plan, bid invitation letters, bid opening statements, bid evaluation \n\nreports or approval documents, and signed contracts between the PDRD project teams and contractors. \n\n \n\n\f 18 \n\nproject  management,  technical  issues,  community  development,  and  training.  The  NGO  will  be \nrecruited for a total of 756 person-months. Each PDRD will receive a team of three facilitators\u2014\none  for  project  implementation  and  two  community  development  facilitators.  The  team  will  work \nwith  the  PDRD  project  teams  and  at  the  commune  and  village  levels  as  an  extension  of  the \nconsulting  firm.  The  NGO  will  report  to  the  PDRD  director  for  daily  implementation,  and  to  the \nPCU  director  and  the  consultant  team  leader  to  ensure  a  unified  approach  to  project \nimplementation is adopted in the six project provinces. An international NGO also will be recruited \nfor monitoring and evaluation on an output-based lump sum contract. The international NGO will \nbe responsible for undertaking a (i) baseline survey, (ii) midterm survey and evaluation, (iii) final \nsurvey  and  evaluation,  and  (iv)  developing  a  training-of-trainers  module  for  improved  RWSS \nmonitoring at the PDRD, commune council, and village levels. An outline terms of reference is in \nAppendix 9, and detailed terms of reference is in Supplementary Appendix J.  \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Recruitment of Consulting Services \n\n65.  MRD requested advance recruitment of all consulting services, with the exception of the 12 \nindividual consultants. MRD has the capacity to do so, as demonstrated under the TSRWSSP.  \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n66. \nwith  the  Government  and  MRD.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  are  included  in  the  grant \nregulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by \nADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  will  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n \n67. \nTo  encourage  greater  stakeholder  participation,  transparency,  and  accountability,  the \nProject  will  (i)  strengthen  the  capacity  within  MRD  to  comply  with  the  project  administration \nmanual;  (ii)  establish  a  project  website  to  disclose  information  about  project-related  issues, \nincluding procurement (e.g., contracts, bidding procedures, contract awards, and list of goods and \nservices procured), and grievance redressal procedures; (iii) establish or use the existing system \non information disclosure at commune council offices (e.g., notice board that displays information \non  contracts,  list  of  participating  bidders,  name  of  the  winning  bidder,  basic  details  on  bidding \nprocedures, contract awards, and list of goods and services procured); (iv) notify communities of \nthe  date  and  location  of  selected  events  in  the  procurement  process  (e.g.,  public  bid  openings, \nprogress reviews, and handover ceremonies); and (v) establish a grievance redress mechanism \nat  the  PCU  and  PDRD  project  team  levels  in  each  project  province  to  receive  complaints  from \ncommunities or contractors. The PCU or PDRD project team will provide a formal reply within 20 \nworking days, and report all grievances in their progress reports to the Government and ADB.  \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n68. \nPayment  of  eligible  expenditures  from  the  proceeds  of  the  grant  will  be  made  either \nthrough  direct  payment  or  imprest  account  procedures  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). To ensure the timely release of \ngrant  proceeds  and  to  expedite  project  implementation,  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance \nwill\u2014immediately  upon  grant  effectiveness\u2014open  a  deposit  account  at  the  National  Bank  of \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n\n \n\nCambodia  and  the  PCU  will  open  a  first-generation  imprest  account  at  a  commercial  bank \nacceptable to the Government and ADB. The PDRD project team director will set up a second-\ngeneration  imprest  account  at  the  provincial  level  with  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  the \nGovernment  and  ADB  for  disbursement  of  eligible  funds  for  small  contracts. 39 The  PCU  and \nPDRD project teams may use the statement of expenditure procedure for replenishing the imprest \naccounts, provided that each individual payment does not exceed $50,000.  \n \n69. \nThe imprest accounts will be used, managed, replenished, and liquidated by the PCU in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The deposit to each imprest account will \nbe  based  on  estimated  expenditure  to  be  financed  through  the  imprest  account  for  the  next  6 \nmonths of project implementation, to be prepared by the PCU and PDRD project teams, but will \nnot exceed the combined ceiling equivalent of $2.1 million, with a ceiling of $300,000 for each \nimprest  account \nsecond-generation \nreplenishment requests, will be prepared by the PDRD project teams and sent through the PCU \nto the Ministry of Economy and Finance for approval. Each imprest account will be managed by \nthe PCU or PDRD project team with the validation of the consultant team leader, in accordance \nwith  detailed  arrangements  agreed  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  No  disbursement  of  grant \nproceeds will be made to the PCU or a participating PDRD project team if misprocurement has \nbeen found by ADB or if procurement has been identified as irregular, until the misprocurement \nor  other  irregularity  has  been  corrected  by  the  province  concerned  to  the  satisfaction  of  the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  Each  WSUG  will  provide  a  contribution  of  10%  of  the  total  cost  for  a \nwater  supply  system,  of  which  3%  will  be  in  cash  and  7%  in  kind.  The  cash  contribution  from \nthese groups will be kept at the provincial level, which is managed by the PDRD project team.  \n \n\nimprest  account.  Withdrawal  applications, \n\nincluding \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n70. \nThe Project will be administered in accordance with the Government's Financial Manual for \nInvestment  Projects, 40  which  describes  the  Government's  financial  management  policies  and \nprocedures  for  efficient  and  effective  implementation  of  ADB  and  World  Bank  projects,  and \nachievement  of  objectives.  A  separate  accounting  system  for  project  expenditures  will  be \nestablished and maintained in accordance with sound accounting principles. The consultant team \nwill provide training on the use of the imprest accounts and operating support to PCU and PDRD \nproject team accounting staff members. All project accounts will be audited annually as part of the \nregular  audit  by  an  independent  auditing  firm  acceptable  to  ADB,  using  international  accounting \nand auditing standards. The consolidated audit reports will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of \nthe close of the Government's fiscal year. The audit opinion will include (i) an assessment of the \nadequacy  of  accounting  and  internal  control  systems  regarding  project  expenditures  and \ntransactions to ensure safe custody of project-financed assets; (ii) a determination as to whether \nthe Government, MRD, and participating provinces have maintained adequate documentation for \nall  financial  transactions,  specifically  including  the  statement  of  expenditure  and  imprest  account \nprocedures  for  both  first-  and  second-generation  imprest  accounts;  and  (iii)  confirmation  of \ncompliance  with  the  project  financial  management  system  and  ADB  requirements  for  project \nmanagement.  A  separate  audit  opinion  will  be  issued  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and \nstatement of expenditure procedures.   \n \n71. \nThe PDRD project teams will submit quarterly reports and data to the PCU within 15 days \nof the end of each quarter. The PCU will (i) collect and consolidate all project progress reports, \nsite reports, and technical and financial reports and submit them to ADB; and (ii) prepare quarterly \n\n                                                 \n39  A total of six second-generation imprest accounts will be opened (one per PDRD project team). \n40  MEF. 2005.

The quarterly report will include (i) a narrative description \nof  progress  made  during  the  reporting  period;  (ii)  modifications,  if  any,  to  the  implementation \nschedule; (iii) details of land use, resettlement, and environmental screening; (iv) information on \npoverty  and  social  development  activities,  including  gender;  (v)  major  project  activities  by  PCU, \nPDRD project teams, and NGOs; (vi) financial and procurement-related information; (vii) problems \nexperienced and remedial actions proposed; (viii) the work to be carried out during the upcoming \nreporting  period;  and  (ix)  a  summary  of  expenditures  during  the  quarter,  year-to-date \nexpenditures, and total expenditures to date.  \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nThe PPMS was developed under the TSRWSSP in 2007, and provides for the collection of \n72. \ndata from subprojects with computer entry done at the provincial level. Data is then aggregated at \nthe national level, and information is available for subprojects (villages in the case of TSRWSSP), \ncommunes,  districts,  provinces,  and  the  project.  The  Project,  within  12  months  of  grant \neffectiveness, will make adjustments to the existing PPMS to ensure that it meets its performance \nand safeguard reporting needs. A baseline survey will be conducted, as part of each village water \nsupply and sanitation plan and by the international NGO (output 4). Each PDRD will provide the \nPCU with quarterly reports on its activities, compliance with safeguard requirements, and progress \ntoward output targets. The PCU will consolidate these reports into a quarterly progress report that \nwill be finalized and circulated to ADB, MRD, and the project steering committee within 1 month of \nthe end of the reporting quarter. Baseline data for each commune subproject will be drawn from \nthe  information  contained  in  the  subproject  feasibility  report,  which  will  be  prepared  prior  to  the \nfinal selection of the commune as a participating subproject. Select data will be disaggregated by \nsex, household income, and ethnic group where applicable.  \n \n73. \nDuring  project  implementation,  the  PDRD  project  teams  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring \nthat  the  PPMS  is  implemented  and  updated,  in  consultation  with  the  local  communities,  to  (i) \nexamine the project\u2019s technical performance, (ii) evaluate the delivery of the planned facilities, (iii) \nassess the achievement of the Project\u2019s objectives, (iv) ensure compliance with social safeguards, \nand  (v)  measure  the  Project\u2019s  benefits.  Annual  PPMS  reports  will  be  prepared  by  each  PDRD \nproject team, then consolidated by the PCU and submitted to ADB. The integrated system for the \nmanagement, monitoring, and evaluation of project impacts, outcomes, and outputs accords with \nADB\u2019s Project Performance Monitoring System Handbook (2007). \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n74.  MRD  and  ADB  will  conduct  joint  project  reviews  at  least  twice  a  year  and  a \ncomprehensive  project  review  about  30  months  after  grant  effectiveness.  The  comprehensive \nproject  review  will  evaluate  (i)  the  actual  progress  of  each  project  output  in  each  province;  (ii) \nimplementation  arrangements  and  procedures  within  the  Government's  decentralization  and \ndeconcentration  process;  (iii)  role  of  village  development  committees  (VDCs)  in  furthering \nproject  implementation  (i.e.,  coordinating  village-level  activities)  following  the  approval  of  the \nRoyal Decree and Subdecree; (iv) activity schedules with focus on targets, type of technologies \npromoted,  rehabilitation  of  nonfunctioning  water  facilities,  and  upgrading  of  existing  water \nfacilities; (v) procurement procedures; (vi) progress and effectiveness of capacity development \nprograms;  (vii)  feedback  from  NGO  surveys  and  PPMS  activities;  (viii)  functioning  and \nperformance of the PCU and PDRD project teams; (ix) performance of consultants and NGOs; \n(x)  financial  performance  and  cost  recovery  of  WSUGs;  and  (xi)  effectiveness  of  safeguard \nprocedures.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n21\n\n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits and Impacts  \n\nPoverty and Social Impacts. The Project will directly benefit an estimated 377,000 rural \n75. \nresidents  with  access  to  improved  water,  of  which  about  290,000  people  will  also  benefit  from \nimproved  sanitation  facilities  in  the  40  communes.  About  50%  of  the  project  beneficiaries  are \nexpected to be poor given (i) the higher-than-average rural population share, (ii) rural poverty is \nhigher than urban poverty, (iii) the higher-than-average poverty incidence in project provinces, and \n(iv) the Project's targeting methodology that will reach the poorest communes in the project area. \nAccess  to  improved  RWSS  is  expected  to  improve  the  health  status  of  households  (especially \nchildren and the elderly) and reduce medical expenditure, as the water is expected to be potable. \nIt also increases the rate of child survival,  which is a precursor to the demographic  transition to \nlower  fertility  rates.  The  Project  is  not  expected  to  have  any  significant  adverse  impacts,  as \npotential adverse impacts identified during project preparation have been eliminated by a change \nin design or mitigated as part of the Project. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in \nAppendix 10, and a full poverty and social assessment is in Supplementary Appendix K.  \n\nEthnic  Minority  Impacts. Only a very small proportion of the population (an estimated \n76. \n1.4%) belongs to ethnic minority groups that are not native speakers of the Khmer language. As \nwith the TSRWSSP, the Project is classified as category B, as very few ethnic minorities have \nbeen identified in the subproject communes. The Project will ensure these ethnic and religious \nminorities  are  informed,  consulted,  and  mobilized  to  participate  in  subproject  preparation. \nAdditionally, the socioeconomic information collected during the preparation of each subproject \nfeasibility  report  will  include  information  on  ethnic  and  religious  minorities.  The  ensuing \nsubproject feasibility report will ensure that minorities receive equal access to project benefits, \nand their representation adequately reflected in the establishment of WSUGs.  \n\nGender  Impacts.  RWSS  programs  provide  an  opportunity  to  deliver  direct  benefits  to \n77. \nwomen  through  time-savings  and  improved  health,  while  improving  the  sustainability  of  the \nservices.  Promoting  women's  participation  in  WSUGs  and  as  peer-to-peer  facilitators  will  also \ncontribute  to  women's  empowerment  through  by  strengthening  their  decision-making  abilities  in \nthe  communities.  Time-savings  from  collecting  water  from  distant  or  low-yielding  sources  and \nimproved  personal  and  family  health  will  also  lead  to  the  increasing  economic  productivity  of \nwomen.  Further,  convenient  access  to  water  and  sanitation  facilities  increases  privacy  and \nreduces the risk of women and girls to sexual harassment or assault. A project gender action plan \nhas  been  prepared  that  builds  on  the  implementation  experiences  of  that  developed  for  the \nTSRWSSP. It ensures broad understanding of\u2014and attention to\u2014the different needs of women \nand  men  in  the  RWSS  sector,  and  provides  equal  opportunities  for  women  and  men  to  access \nproject  benefits  and  participate  in  capacity  development  activities.  Specific  targets  include  (i)  at \nleast  50%  of  the  selected  commune-  and  village-level  focal  persons,  including  peer  leaders,  be \nwomen; (ii) at least 40% of each RWSS committee and WSUG board be women; and (iii) village-\nlevel project activities are implemented in cooperation with the commune council committees on \nwomen  and  children's  affairs.  The  plan  is  in  accordance  with  the  Ministry  of  Women\u2019s  Affairs \nnational strategy for gender mainstreaming, MRD gender working group action plan, and ADB\u2019s \nPolicy  on  Gender  and  Development  (1998).  A  summary  gender  analysis  and  action  plan  is  in \nAppendix 11, with details in Supplementary Appendix L.  \n\nLand  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  Impacts. The Project is designed to minimize land \n78. \nacquisition and resettlement impacts. Project interventions will require small parcels of land for the \nconstruction  of  RWSS  facilities  in  rural  areas,  but  the  TSRWSSP  experience  confirms  that \n\n \n\n\f 22 \n\nsubprojects can be designed without severely affecting people and households. Each subproject \ncommune will require that a village water supply and sanitation plan be prepared. This will include \nassessment of the scope of land acquisition and resettlement for the selected works in that village. \nA  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  (LARF),  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  Government  laws  and  regulations,  will  guide  the \npreparation  of resettlement  action  plans (RAPs)  for  the subproject communes.  A commune-level \nRAP  will  consolidate  any  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  of  all  RWSS  interventions  in \nthe commune. Permanent land acquisition for RWSS facilities will be minimal, but the scope can \nonly be determined once the mix of interventions is decided by the communities. The LARF has \nbeen prepared to ensure that there will be no displacement and relocation of houses or structures. \nLand  is  either  voluntarily  contributed  or  compensated  at  full  replacement  cost  at  current  market \nvalue. Land acquisition and resettlement impacts for the Project have been classified as category \nB. The summary LARF is in Appendix 12, and the full LARF is in Supplementary Appendix M.  \n\n79. \nEnvironmental  Impacts.  The  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B  (non-\nsensitive).  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  prepared  for  the  project  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines \n(2003),  and  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  requirements.  It  covers  a  range  of  interventions, \nwhich are similar and small in scale, and found that most environmental impacts of the Project \nare positive. Potential negative impacts would arise from (i) detonation of unexploded ordnance, \n(ii)  risks  associated  with  inadequate  operation  and  management  of  treatment  facilities,  (iii) \nponding  and  provision  of  habitats  for  mosquitoes  around  water  facilities,  (iv)  bacteriological \npollution  of  shallow  groundwater,  (v)  presence  of  arsenic  or  iron  in  groundwater, 41 and  (vi) \nconstruction  impacts.  These  potential  negative  environmental  impacts  can  be  temporary  and \ncan  be  mitigated  to  an  acceptable  level  with  the  proposed  mitigation  and  water  quality \nmonitoring  measures.  An  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  was \nprepared  to  guide  the  preparation  and  approval  procedures  of  environmental  assessments  of \nthe  subprojects.  The  EARF  describes \nfor  environmental \nmanagement,  and  will  include  the  screening  checklists  to  determine  a  categorization  for  each \nintervention. Those interventions with category B will require further analysis. The summary and \nfull IEE, and EARF are in Supplementary Appendix N.  \n\nresponsibilities \n\ninstitutional \n\nIncreased  Government  Capacity  and  Coordination. MRD and subnational institutions \n80. \nin the six project provinces will improve their performance to plan, budget, regulate, and facilitate \nthe  development  of the  RWSS sector.  Provinces, districts,  communes,  and  villages will develop \nthe capacity to take new responsibilities. The Project will promote greater transparency regarding \nthe  provision  of  information  and  decision-making  processes  at  all  administrative  levels.  The \ncapacity of government officials working in RWSS and of WSUGs members will be improved in \nsuch  areas  as  project  management  planning  and  administration,  financial  management  and \naccounting,  community  participation  techniques  and  gender  awareness,  data  collection  and \nmanagement,  public\u2013private  partnerships,  environmental  and  resettlement  issues,  and  such \ntechnical aspects as monitoring water quality and supervising drilling operations.  \n\n81. \nEconomic  Impact.  Two  sample  subproject  communes  were  selected  for  feasibility.  The \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  for  Kbal  Trach  in  Pursat  is  19.7%  and  18.2%  for  Bos  Sbov  in \nBanteay Meanchey. The economic internal rate of return takes into account the capital investment \nfor  water  supply  and  the  sanitation  facilities,  including  the  cost  of  the  consultants  (project \nmanagement  and  capacity  building)  and  incremental  administration  cost.  The  subprojects  are \n                                                 \n41  In  the  TSRWSSP,  out  of  2,235  drilled  wells,  only  one  case  of  arsenic  was  found  out  in  Pursat  at  levels  more  than \n0.005 milligrams per liter (mg/l), 446 cases of iron at levels more than 4 mg/l, and a few cases where levels were more \nthan 0.3mg/l. Iron reduction plants have successfully reduced iron levels from 10 mg/l to 0.3 mg/l and 0.16 mg/l.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n23\n\n \n\nassessed  as  being  economically  viable.  During  project  preparation,  several  options  for  water \nsupply  and  sanitation  had  been  evaluated.  Two  alternatives  for  water  supply  were  identified  for \neach  commune,  and  each  option  was  further  refined  and  developed  using  the  results  of  the \nsocioeconomic  surveys.  For  each  sample  subproject  commune,  a  least-cost  analysis  was \ncompleted,  and  the  benefit-cost  analysis  is  based  on  the  least-cost  alternative.  A  least-cost \nanalysis for the sanitation output was not done, since each subproject will support development of \nan  improved  pit  latrine,  which  households  can  upgrade  based  on  individual  preference  and \naffordability levels. An economic and financial analysis is in Appendix 13.  \n\nB. \n\nRisks \n\n82. \nInstitutional  and  Governance  Risks.  Potential  risks  include  (i)  changes  to  the \ndecentralization  and  deconcentration  processes  following  the  approval  of  the  Organic  Law  in \n2008,  (ii)  challenges  at  the  national  and  subnational  level  in  moving  away  from  project \nimplementation  units  to  project  teams  in  the  PDRDs,  and  (iii)  ensuring  proper  financial \nmanagement controls at the provincial level. To mitigate these risks, actions are included in the \nProject  to  (i)  inform  key  stakeholders  at  the  national  and  subnational  levels  about  the  Project \nand its alignment with the decentralization and deconcentration processes to date; (ii) coordinate \nclosely with other ADB-supported projects that aim to strengthen subnational-level capacity; (iii) \ncoordinate regularly with the Ministry of Interior about the decentralization and deconcentration \nfund-flow  arrangements  remain \nprocess;  (iv)  ensure \nunchanged  from  the  time  of  project  processing;  (v)  allow  for  a  review  of  the  existing \nimplementation  arrangements  within  30  months  of  grant  effectiveness  (i.e.,  project  midterm \nreview); (vi) recruit NGO staff members to work with the PDRD project team rather than contract \nout activities; and (vii) recruit local accountants and financial management specialists to support \nthe  PDRD  project  teams  during  project  implementation,  and  to  link  to  the  ongoing  activities \nunder the public financial management for rural development (which includes MRD). An agreed \ngood governance framework is in Supplementary Appendix O.  \n\nimplementation  and \n\nthat  existing \n\n83. \nTechnical  Risks.  For  particular  villages,  especially  those  where  surface  and  shallow \ngroundwater is of poor quality due to high content of arsenic, iron, or other pollutants, or where \nthe water table is low, finding an appropriate and affordable technical solution may be difficult. \nTo  mitigate  this  risk,  mechanisms  have  been  incorporated  in  the  project  design  to  include  (i) \nrequirement  of  an  initial  environmental  screening  in  each  village  before  the  communities  can \nfinalize a village water supply and sanitation plan; (ii) groundwater testing completed as part of \nthe contractor's bid (up to 100 meters); (iii) provisional budget for groundwater testing in difficult \nareas  (between  100  and  200  meters);  (iv)  inclusion  of  a  range  of  water-supply  technologies \n(e.g.,  protected  ponds  with  filtration)  in  the  project  design  to  allow  for  alternative  options  to \ngroundwater source; and (v) at least two persons (50% women) from each WSUG to be trained \nin O&M of water supply facilities.  \n\n84. \nSector  Risks.  Since  there  are  several  initiatives  planned  to  help  support  a  sector-wide \napproach in RWSS, there is risk of inconsistency and duplication between various institutions. A \nnational  rural  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  hygiene  strategy  for  2010\u20132025  and  implementation \nguidelines  will  be  prepared  after  the  Project  is  approved.  ADB  is  one  of  three  development \npartners  jointly  supporting  the  strategy  and  implementation  guidelines  development.  To  mitigate \nthis risk and ensure that the proposed sector strategy and Project are consistent with one another, \nthe  Project  will  support  continued  dialogue  and  coordination  with  development  partners  during \nproject  implementation  through  the  TWG-RWSSH.  An  assurance  has  been  included  for  the \napproval of the strategy within 30 months of grant effectiveness, which coincides with the planned \nmidterm review of the Project.  \n\n \n\n\f 24 \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances  on  counterpart  financing,  audit,  governance  and \n85. \nanticorruption,  labor  standards,  and  health  risks,  the  Government  and  MRD  have  given  the \nfollowing project-specific assurances, which are incorporated in legal documents: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe  MRD  and  PDRDs  will  ensure  that  (a)  the  contribution  of  WSUGs,  to  the \nProject  cost,  at  least  covers  the  cost  of  O&M  of  the  water  facilities;  and  (b) \ntechnical  support  is  provided  to  the  village  communities  in  the  Project  areas  to \nensure continued O&M of the water facilities beyond project period. \nThe MRD and PDRD will ensure that prior to the construction of public latrines in \neach  village,  PDRD  signs  an  agreement  with  the  WSUG,  for  each  public  facility \noutlining  (a)  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  arrangement,  (b)  cost  sharing \nprinciples, (c) WSUG's responsibility to carry out hygiene awareness campaigns in \nthe village communities, and (d) detailed plan for continued O&M of the sanitation \nfacilities beyond Project period. \nThe  MRD  will  ensure  that  its  3-year  budget  strategy  plan  for  submission  to  the \nGovernment for annual budget allocations is (a) based on provincial assessments, \n(b)  lists  rural  water  and  sanitation  sector  as  a  priority  sector,  and  (c)  prioritizes \nrehabilitation and upgrading of existing water facilities. \nThe  Government  will  approve,  within  12  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  a  Royal \nDecree and Subdecree on the establishment of VDCs. \nThe MRD has approved the rural water supply, sanitation and hygiene strategy for \n2010-2025 within 30 months of grant effectiveness, and implementation guideline \nwithin 36 months of grant effectiveness. \n\n(vi)  Within 24 months of grant effectiveness, MRD shall have revised and approved the \nguidelines  on  the  establishment  of  WSUGs  including,  but  not  limited  to,  the \norganization and registration, legal statutes, rights and responsibilities of a WSUG \nand  its  members,  and  the  election  and  composition  of  WSUGs  board,  to  the \nsatisfaction  of  ADB.  The  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  RWSS  committee,  its \nmembership, key functions and its relation to VDCs, shall also be included in the \nrevised WSUG guideline. \nThe Government and MRD will ensure that the implementation arrangements and \nfunds  flow  mechanisms,  agreed  between  the  Government  and  ADB  remains  the \nsame  throughout  the  Project  implementation  period  and  are  not  affected  by  the \nGovernment's decentralization and deconcentration processes. \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii)  The  Government  and  MRD  will  ensure  the  implementation  of  the  gender  action \nplan  agreed  by  the  Government  and  ADB  including,  but  not  limited  to,  ensuring \nthat (a) at least 40% of each WSUG board and RWSS committee is female, and \n(b) 50% of WSUG board members trained in water supply O&M are women. The \nGovernment  shall  and  shall  cause  MRD  to  ensure  that  community  mobilization \ncontracts  with  NGOs  require  that  (a)  at  least  1  of  each  3-person  NGO  team  is \nfemale;  (b)  the  training  carried  out  by  NGOs  and  the  PDRD  Project  Teams,  is \ndirected towards the poor and vulnerable, including at least 40% of women; and (c) \nat least 40% of all hygiene and sanitation education participants are male. \nThe  Government  and  MRD  will  ensure  that  its  laws  and  regulations  governing \nenvironmental impact assessments, as well as ADB's Environment Policy (2002), \nare  followed.  If  there  are  any  discrepancies  between  the  Government  laws  and \nregulations  and  ADB's  Environment  Policy,  the  latter  shall  apply.  Each  PDRD \nProject  Team  will  conduct  an  environmental  assessment  for  each  subproject \n\n(ix) \n\n\f \n\n \n\n25\n\n \n\nbased on the EARF. The Government shall and shall cause MRD to further ensure \nthat  environmental  assessment  (a)  is  based  on  the  procedures  set  forth  in  the \nEARF,  (b)  conforms  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  requirements,  (c)  include \ndetails  of  local  consultation  carried  out,  and  (d)  is  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval \nprior  to  civil  works  contracts  being  awarded  for  the  subproject  if  any  critical \nenvironmental  issues  are  recognized.  The  Government  must  provide  certification \nthat unexploded ordnance has been cleared before commencement of civil works. \nThe  Government  and  MRD  will  ensure  that  all  Project  RAPs  are  approved  by  ADB \nprior  to  the  award  of  civil  works  contracts  for  clusters  of  subprojects,  in  accordance \nwith the Project LARF agreed upon by the Government and ADB, Government\u2019s laws, \nregulations, and procedures, and ADB\u2019s requirements as defined in ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy  (1995).  In  case  of  discrepancies  between  Government\u2019s  laws, \nregulations, and procedures and ADB\u2019s requirements, the latter will apply. \nThe  Government  and  MRD  will  ensure  that  (a)  full  participation  of  ethnic  and \nreligious minorities is promoted in Project activities, including, among other things, \nthe  capacity  development  and  training  activities,  (b)  the  needs  of  the  ethnic  and \nreligious  minorities  are  appropriately  met  especially  in  the  areas  with  a  high \nproportion  of  ethnic  minority  people,  (c)  the  WSUG  board  has  reasonable \nrepresentation  from  the  ethnic  and  religious  minority  groups,  and  (d)  all  activities \nare consistent with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples. \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nB.  \n\nConditions for Grant Disbursement \n\nThe MRD 3-year budget strategy plan for 2010 (i) lists RWSS sector as a priority sector, \n\n86. \nand (ii) prioritizes rehabilitation and upgrading of existing water facilities. \n\n87. \nThe  PCU  has  recruited  an  international  monitoring  and  evaluation  NGO  to  (i)  conduct \nbaseline,  midterm,  and  final  surveys;  (ii)  develop  and  implement  an  M&E  capacity  development \nprogram for the Project based on the PPMS; and (iii) conduct a final project evaluation.  \n\n88. \nPDRD  directors  in  each  participating  province  has  completed  a  review  of  the \nrehabilitation  needs  in  their  respective  province  for  existing  water  supply  facilities  and  public \nsanitation facilities, and have submitted a copy of this review to the PCU and ADB. \n\nC. \n\nConditions for Contract Awards for Each Subproject \n\n89. \nThe relevant IEE and RAP, if any, have been approved by the Government and ADB, and \nobjections (if any) raised by the affected people, if any, have been addressed and compensation, \nas per the project LARF, has been given to the affected people. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n90. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the grant not exceeding \n$21,000,000 to the Kingdom of Cambodia from ADB's Special Funds Resources for the Second \nRural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project, on terms and conditions that are substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in the draft Grant Agreement presented to the Board.  \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n24 August 2009\n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n\n26 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \nExpanded access to \nimproved RWSS \nnationwide, and \nbetter health of rural \nhouseholds in project \nprovinces \n\nOutcome \nIncreased access to \nimproved RWSS in \nselected communes \nof six provinces in \nthe Tonle Sap Basin \n\n \n\nPerformance Targets/Indicators \n\n \nPercent of rural people with access \nto improved water supply increases \nfrom 55.4% in 2007 to 60.0% in \n2015 to 75.0% by 2020 (MDG target \n7.10). \n\nPercent of rural people with access \nto improved sanitation increases \nfrom 19.6% in 2007 to 30.0% in \n2015 to 50.0% by 2020 (MDG target \n7.12). \n\nUnder-5 child mortality in rural areas \ndecreases by an average of 20 \ndeaths per 1,000 live births in each \nprovince by 2020 (baseline: 2005 \nCHDS for each province.

The \nGovernment has committed to providing the population with clean and safe water, protecting them \nfrom  water-related  diseases,  and  providing  adequate  water  supply  to  ensure  food  security \neconomic  activities  and  appropriate  living  standards. The  Government  also  considers  improved \naccess to water supply facilities in rural areas to be a key prerequisite for poverty reduction. The \nnational strategic development plan3 reinforces Cambodia Millennium Development Goal (CMDG) \ntarget 7.10,  increasing the  proportion of  rural  population with access to safe water  from 24% to \n50%  by  2015,  and  target  7.12,  increasing  the  proportion  of  rural  population  with  access  to \nimproved sanitation from 8.6% to 30.0% by 2015. \n\nA. \n\nThe Government Policy, Strategy, and Reform Initiatives \n\n2. \nNational  Policy  on  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation.  The  national  policy  on  water  and \nsanitation, ratified by the Council of Ministers on 7 February 2003, is comprised of three parts (i) \nurban water supply policy, (ii) urban sanitation policy, and (iii) RWSS policy. It (i) sets the role of \nGovernment  as  sector  facilitator,  enabling  other  organizations  to  deliver  the  actual  services;  (ii) \nprioritizes services for the poor; (iii) defines the role of the private sector in service delivery and \nthe  role  of  the  Government  to  enable  the  private  sector  to  achieve  this,  including  promoting \ntransparency  and  competition  in  sector  service  provision;  and  (iv)  establishes  the  role  of \ncommunities  in  management  of  their  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities  and  services. \nCommunities are to choose the type and level of service, based on information about the technical \nand financial aspects of the service options. \n\n3. \n\nThe policy framework had several shortcomings, which have since been clarified: \n(i) \n\nTerms\u2014such  as  \u201csafe\u201d,  \u201cimproved\u201d,  \u201caccess\u201d,  \u201csustained\u201d,  \u201csanitation\u201d,  and \n\u201chygienic  environment\u201d\u2014were  unclear, \nimpeding  effective  monitoring  and \ncomparisons  between  geographic  areas.  The  Ministry  of  Rural  Development \n(MRD) and Ministry of Planning have since clarified the definitions, based on the \nWorld  Health  Organization  and  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF)  Joint \nMonitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation. \nThe  minimum  level  of  service  for  water  supply  and  sanitation  was  undefined, \nmaking  it  difficult  to  assess  coverage  and  to  make  effective  comparisons.  MRD \nhas clarified that the minimum level of service is 20 liters per capita per day. \nResponsibilities between the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy (MIME) and \nMRD  regarding  urban  and  rural  water  supply  systems  were  unclear.  This  was \nresolved in 2005 by a memorandum of understanding between MIME and MRD, \nwhich still remains valid. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n4. \nIn  addition,  an  RWSS  sector  investment  plan  for  2005\u20132015  was  prepared  by  MRD  in \nJanuary 2005, describing overall sector financing requirements and expected levels of coverage \nbased on CMDGs. MRD updated and approved the sector investment plan for 2010-2025 on 24 \nJune  2009  (footnote  2).

Updated Sector Investment Plan 2010\u20132025. Phnom Penh. \n \n5. \nIn  2007,  the  estimated  rural  population  with  access  to  safe,  improved  water  was  55.4% \n(5.97  million),  while  19.6%  (2.11  million)  had  access  to  improved  sanitation.  To  attain  the \nnationwide 2015 CMDG targets, an additional 0.012 million rural people should be provided with \nimproved drinking water, and about 1.48 million rural people with improved sanitation. At a cost \nper capita of $16 and $31 for water supply and sanitation, respectively, these additional coverage \nnumbers  translate  to  an  estimated  $53.5  million  in  investments  from  2008  to  2015.  The  total \ninvestment  includes  the  cost  of  the  physical  infrastructure  ($37.1  million),  institutional  capacity \nimprovement ($9.7 million), and incremental administration ($6.7 million). Of the total $53.5 million \nof  capital  investment  required,  an  estimated  $50.0  million  in  capital  investment  has  been \ncommitted  or  is  planned  in  the  sector  from  2008  to  2015.4 The  funding  gap  for  investments \nnecessary  to  meet  the  2015  CMDG  targets  for  RWSS  is  estimated  at  $3.5  million  in  capital \ninvestment (excluding recurrent costs). \n \n6. \nMRD has projected estimated coverage rates for RWSS by 2020, which are necessary \nto  remain  on  track  to  meet  the  stated  2025  targets.  These  estimates  are  75%  for  rural  water \nsupply and 50% for rural sanitation. The capital investment estimate is based on the assumption \nthat the 2015 target coverage is attained. The projected rural populations in 2020 and 2025 are \n12.58 million and 13.42 million, respectively. Using an average cost per capita of $16 and $25 \nfor water supply and sanitation services, respectively, this translates to a capital investment of \n$245.79  million  for  2016\u20132020  and $281.72  million  for  2021\u20132025.  Total  capital  investment  to \nattain the 100% RWSS coverage by 2025 is about $527.51 million. \n \n7. \nSector  Definitions  and  Service  Levels.  The  CMDGs  originally  presented  its  targets  in \nterms  of  access  to  safe  water,  but  changed  this  term  in  2003  to  access  to  improved  water. \nNational  surveys  and  RWSS  databases  in  Cambodia  do  not  identify  safe  sources  in  terms  of \nwater  quality;  instead,  they  distinguish  between  improved  and  unimproved  supplies  or  facilities. \nMRD  proposes  20  liters  per  capita  per  day  as  the  minimum  quantity  to  be  supplied  by  an \nimproved source.5 The global definition of less than a 1-kilometer walking distance to an improved \nsource is not accepted in Cambodia, as it is said that people will not walk that far to collect water. \nTherefore, distance to source has not been officially accepted in Cambodia as part of the access \ndefinition.  MRD  set  the  maximum  walking  distance  to  a  water  facility  at  150  meters,  based  on \nobservations that people continue to use traditional sources if distances to improved sources are \ngreater than this.  \n \n\n                                                 \n4 Includes  (i)  $25.8  million  from  the  Project,  (ii)  $6  million  from  the  ongoing  ADB-supported  Tonle  Sap  Rural  Water \n\nSupply and Sanitation Sector Project, and (iii) $18 million from the Government's RWSS Project.  \n\n5 MRD. 2001.

In  2007,  the  Technical  Working  Group  on  Rural  Water  Supply, \n8. \nSanitation, and Hygiene was established to coordinate and harmonize policy in Cambodia\u2019s water \nresources, water supply, and sanitation sector. It is comprised of ADB, MIME, Ministry of Water \nResources  and  Meteorology  (MOWRAM),  MRD,  UNICEF,  World  Bank\u2019s  Water  Sanitation \nProgram,  and  other  partners.  ADB,  UNICEF,  and  the  Water  Sanitation  Program  are  supporting \nMRD  to  prepare  a  national  rural  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  hygiene  strategy  (2010\u20132025), \nwhich  is  due  for  approval  in  December  2009.  National  technical  guidelines  will  follow  its \npreparation,  with  inputs  from  the  Tonle  Sap  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project \n(TSRWSSP) 6  technical  guidelines  in  seven  sector  themes.  In  addition,  the  Water  Sanitation \nProgram is supporting MRD and MIME to prepare a detailed sector investment strategy for urban \nand RWSS, including hygiene and hygiene education due for completion in 2009. The water and \nsanitation  sectoral  working  group,  chaired  by  the  Department  of  Rural  Water  Supply  (DRWS) \ndirector,  meets  monthly  to  discuss  technical  issues,  and  the  Water  Use  and  Health  Education \nForum is a yearly national event organized by the Department of Rural Health Care (DRHC). \n \nDecentralization and Deconcentration. In 2008, the Organic Law7 was passed, giving \n9. \nlegal  responsibility  to  provinces,  districts,  and  commune  councils  to  administer  their  affairs, \nincluding  development  plans.  This  strengthens  their  role  in  the  oversight  and  evaluation  of \nprojects,  especially  the  functions  of  three  commune-level  committees 8  in  project  planning, \nmanagement,  and  implementation.  Every  year,  commune  councils  plan  and  formulate  their \nneeds  and  (i)  submit  them  to  development  partners  through  the  annual  district  integration \nworkshop in November, or (ii) implement them with commune funds through the national Seila \nProgram.  Discussions  with  subnational  officials  have  revealed  that  although  RWSS  may  be \nprioritized  in  commune  plans,  the  sector  may  not  necessarily  be  prioritized  in  district  or \nprovincial plans. All commune councils maintain a database of RWSS facilities in the villages. \n \n10. \nADB  Strategy  for  the  Sector.  The  water  supply  and  sanitation  sector  road  map  is  an \nappendix  to  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  for  Cambodia  (2005), 9 describes  the  ADB \ncommitment and targets for the sector, including (i) effective risk management through a proposed \npublic  financial  management  program  involving  MRD;  (ii)  operational  commitments  in  RWSS \nsector  infrastructure;  (iii)  assistance  to  develop  a  rural  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  hygiene \nstrategy;  and  (iv)  community  mobilization  for  improved  RWSS  monitoring  and  stronger  links \namong  water,  sanitation,  and  health.  ADB  targets  support  the  Government's  policy  and \ncommitments in the sector.  \n\nSector Responsibilities of Government Agencies: National Level \n\nB. \n \n11. \nAmong  the  various  government  ministries  and  agencies  with  water  sector-related \nresponsibilities,  those  concerned  with  RWSS  are  MIME,  MOWRAM,  and  MRD.  MIME  is \nresponsible  for  water  supply  to  provincial,  small  towns  and  the  regulation  of  private  sector \ninvolvement  in  piped  water  systems;  MOWRAM  has  overall  responsibility  for  water  resources \nplanning  and  management;  and  MRD  is  specifically  responsible  for  RWSS.  Although  each \nministry has a mandate, responsibilities that overlap are clarified through ad hoc agreements.  \n \n\n                                                 \n6 ADB.  2005.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Grant  to  the \nKingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Tonle  Sap  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project.  Manila  (Grant  0018-\nCAM, $18,000,000, approved on 20 October). \n\n7 Royal Kram No. NS/RKM/0508/017. \n8 Under the Organic Law, committees are procurement, women and children\u2019s affairs, and technical facilitation. \n9 ADB. 2005. Cambodia: Country Strategy and Program 2005\u20132009. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nInterministerial coordination is limited. Exchange of data or information is slow. Datasets \n12. \nin the RWSS sector are inadequate and incompatible because of short periods of observation, \ninsufficient  monitoring  sites,  lost  records,  or  variable  baseline  information.  The  quality  of  the \ndata  is  often  questionable,  due  to  the  lack  of  clear  definitions  and  service  indicators.  This \nweakness has been recognized by the Government, and steps are being taken to reestablish a \nnational  capacity  to  acquire  and  manage  data  and  information  related  to  RWSS  and  the \nenvironment. MOWRAM and MRD have shared a groundwater database since 1994, and MRD \nhas kept a record of wells installed, with the support of development partners.  \n \n13.  MRD, as with other government agencies, has traditionally been an \u201cimplementer\u201d, with \noperational  drilling  teams  and  equipment.  Following  the  2003  policy  framework  (footnote  1), \nMRD  has  taken  on  policy,  planning,  and  regulatory  functions,  while  construction,  supervision, \nand  service  provision  is  gradually  being  done  by  private  enterprises.  Further,  RWSS \nresponsibilities  are  coordinated  between  two  departments  within  MRD\u2014the  DRWS,  which  is \nresponsible  for  rural  water  supply,  and  the  DRHC,  which  is  responsible  for  sanitation,  health, \nand  hygiene  awareness.  Continued  coordination  is  required  between  the  departments  to \nimplement an integrated RWSS approach.  \n\nSector Responsibilities of Government Agencies: Subnational Level \n\nC. \n \nProvincial  Department  of  Rural  Development.  RWSS  responsibilities  are  planned, \n14. \nimplemented,  and  monitored  by  provincial  departments  of  rural  development  (PDRDs)  with \ncommune councils and village development councils (if established). PDRDs are comprised of \nsix  sections:  rural  water  supply,  rural  health  care,  rural  credit,  rural  roads,  rural  community \ndevelopment, and administration and finance. On average, PDRDs have 40\u201380 staff members, \nmany of which are assigned to projects or work for nongovernment organizations (NGOs).  \n \n15. \nProvincial  rural  development  committees  are  chaired  by  the  provincial  governor  and \ncomprise  the  directors  of  seven  provincial  line  agencies:  health,  women\u2019s  affairs,  rural \ndevelopment,  agriculture,  water  resources,  planning,  and  interior.  These  committees  are \nresponsible  for  coordinating  development  initiatives  through  the  formulation  of  provincial \nstrategic  development  plans  and  provincial  investment  plans.  All  relevant  investments  are \nreferred  to  them  for  compliance  with  provincial  plans.  PDRD  directors  are  the  vice  chairs  of \nthese committees, and executive committees are responsible for their operational activities.  \n \n16. \nDistrict  Office  of  Rural  Development.  The  district  office  of  rural  development,  a  line \nagency of MRD, performs PDRD functions at the district level. In some cases, this office exists \nin name only. The district officer is located in the PDRD office and performs district-based duties \nfrom  that  location.  However,  projects  often  deal  directly  with  commune  councils  under  the \nprocedures  set  out  in  the  Organic  Law.  The  role  of  the  district  offices  can  be  strengthened  to \nhelp coordinate the rural development activities at the local levels. \n \n17. \nCommune  Councils.  Commune  councils  have  had  their  roles  and  responsibilities \nsignificantly strengthened by the process of election of members, which was introduced in 2002, \nthe  planning, \nand \nimplementation, and financing of rural infrastructure. They prepare, prioritize, and formulate their \nneeds and prepare annual plans for submission to provincial rural development committees (or \nits equivalent) and development partners. \n \n18. \nVillages.  The  village  institutional  framework  remains  generally  weak.  A  village  chief, \nappointed  by  the  Ministry  of  Interior,  is  nominally  in  charge  of  village  affairs.  Village \n\nthe  2008  Organic  Law.  Commune  councils  are  responsible \n\nfor \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n35\n\nthe  United  Nations  Development \ndevelopment  committees  (VDCs),  established  under \nProgramme's Seila Program and Cambodia Area Rehabilitation and Regeneration Project, are \nresponsible  for  a  range  of  rural  development  affairs.  Although  a  subdecree  has  been  issued \nsupporting the establishment and operation of VDCs, a Royal Decree is in the process of being \ndrafted to make the roles of the VDCs clear and effective within the current decentralization and \ndeconcentration framework. VDC members are elected by eligible voters within the village. The \nvillage chief is not automatically a member, but may stand for office at the time of elections and \ncan  attend  VDC  meetings  as  a  nonvoting  advisor.  The  chairperson  of  the  VDC  is  elected  by \nmembers and reports to the commune council, through the village chief.  \n \n19. \nIn  the  absence  of  the  VDC,  ad  hoc  committees  are  formed  to  manage  village  affairs. \nVillage  sanitation  committees  are  an  example,  which  have  been  used  under  the  TSRWSSP  to \nimplement  community  procurement  for  latrine  construction.  These  committees\u2014now  RWSS \ncommittees\u2014will function as proposed  VDC subcommittees, once  VDCs are established  by the \nnew  Royal  Decree  and  Subdecree.  In  the  commune  planning  process,  the  identification  and \nplanning of projects is now the responsibility of planning and budgeting committees, which include \ncommune council members and two village representatives\u2014one male and one female. \n \n20.  Water and sanitation user groups (WSUGs) are responsible for managing, operating, and \nmaintaining communal RWSS facilities following MRD guidelines. Their responsibilities include the \ncollection  of  contributions  from  users  and  management  of  operation  and  maintenance \narrangements.  Ownership  of  facilities,  agreements  with  the  private  sector,  and  legal  aspects \nregarding  user  service  remains  a  commune  responsibility.  WSUGs  are  organized  around  each \ncommunal  water  facility,  but  the  merits  of  a  village-level  management  committee,  such  as  the \nRWSS committee, are being discussed. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation \n\nD. \n \nThe private sector plays an important role in RWSS development, but it remains weak and \n21. \nneeds  support  in  Cambodia.  The  2003  RWSS  sector  policy  recognizes  the  need  for  MRD  to \n\u201ccreate a competitive environment that motivates the private sector to supply cost-effective RWSS \nservices that respond to community demand, especially in underserved areas.\u201d The private sector \nlocally-based  artisans,  mechanics,  markets  and  stores,  manufacturers,  drilling \nincludes \ncompanies,  and  consultants  (i.e.,  individuals,  NGOs,  and  firms).  Private-sector  services  can  be \nengaged  for  the  provision  of  supply  of  materials  and  equipment;  construction  of  RWSS \ninfrastructure;  technical  advice;  facility  management;  maintenance  and  repair;  and  training  for \nmanagement, maintenance, or hygiene issues.  \n \n22. \nNGOs and entrepreneurs are becoming more actively involved in the provision of RWSS \nservices,  but  their  capacity  in  this  area  remains  limited.  The  business  environment  essential  for \ntheir successful large-scale involvement in RWSS is hampered by a lack of (i) business services, \n(ii)  clarity  of  private-sector  regulation,  (iii)  financial  services,  (iv)  technical  specifications,  and  (v) \nexpected service levels. Despite these constraints, the private sector is evolving. There are many \nprivate  suppliers  of  jars,  pipes,  hand  pumps,  latrine  slabs,  and  concrete  rings  for  lining  wells  or \npits. Contractors have drilling rigs and small entrepreneurs have water carts.  \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nTable A2.2: Shortlist of Sixty-Five Communes in Six Provinces\n\nDistrict\nA.

Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) sector plays an integral part in the Government of Cambodia\u2019s overall strategy for \nrural development and poverty reduction. The national strategic development plan for 2006\u20132010 and the Rectangular Strategya \nprovide  the  overarching  national  development  framework.  The  second  phase  of  the  Rectangular  Strategy  was  launched  in \nSeptember 2008, and a midterm review of the national development plan was conducted in 2008. These key policy documents, \nalong with Cambodia Millennium Development Goals (CMDGs),b place a high priority on RWSS, recognizing that limited access \nto improved water and sanitation results in poor health, lost productive time due to sickness or caring for sick family members, \nmissed schooling opportunities for children, and increased medical expenditure. Women (especially female heads of household) \nand children, who bear the primary responsibility for collecting water, are the most affected. \n \nThe  overarching  goal  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  Cambodia,  as  defined  in  its  country  strategy  and  program \n(2005\u20132009), is sustainable poverty reduction.c To achieve this, the country strategy and program results framework (2006\u2013\n2010) rests on three strategic pillars (i) sustainable pro-poor economic growth, (ii) inclusive social development, and (iii) good \ngovernance and improved public service delivery. The results framework identifies improved health and quality of life for the \nrural  population  as  a  strategic  goal  of  inclusive  social  development.  Key  constraints  to  achieving  this  goal  are  the  lack  of \ninvestment in and maintenance of drinking water and sanitation facilities; and insufficient community awareness of the links \namong improved  water, sanitation, and health, resulting in poor hygiene practices. The RWSS sector is identified as one in \nwhich  ADB  will  play  a  catalytic  role.  ADB  served  as  the  first  lead  facilitator  of  the  joint  Government\u2013development  partner \nTechnical Working Group for Rural Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene from July 2007 to June 2009. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                             Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention (TI\u2013M)  \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  is  embedded  in  the  national  strategic  development  plan,  and  the  2008  midterm \nreview reiterates that the Government \"attaches high priority to boosting the rural and agricultural sectors in pursuance of its pro-\npoor focus\" and that \"with poverty reduction as the major goal, special focus will be on increasing opportunities and benefits in \nthe rural areas where poverty incidence is high.\" Better rural infrastructure\u2014including increased access to improved water supply \nand  sanitation  facilities\u2014is  an  issue  to  be  addressed  urgently,  and  the  Project  directly  responds  to  this  need.  Data  from  the \nMinistry of Planning show that in 2007, only 55.4% of the rural population had access to improved water,d and only 19.6% had \naccess to improved sanitation facilities. This implies that about 80% of the rural population currently practices open defecation.  \n \nThe  benefits  of  the  Project  to  the  rural  poor  will  include  (i)  access  to  appropriate  and  improved  RWSS  facilities;  (ii)  skills \ndevelopment  in  the  operation  and  management  of  these  facilities;  and  (iii)  greater  awareness  of  the  link  among  sanitation, \nhygiene,  and  health.  The  primary  beneficiaries  are  the  rural  poor  in  six  provinces\u2014Banteay  Meanchey,  Battambang, \nKampong Chhnang, Kampong Thom, Pursat, and Siem Reap\u2014where improved RWSS facilities will become more accessible \nto the poor and socially excluded. The many benefits of access to improved water and sanitation will include a reduction of the \nincidence of water and sanitation-related illness, improved health, and more time for productive activities. Problems of poverty \nare inextricably linked with those of water\u2014its availability, proximity, quantity, and quality. Improving the access of the poor to \nwater has the potential to make a major contribution toward poverty eradication in Cambodia. Furthermore, achieving water \nand sanitation targets is at the core of achieving all CMDGs, given the many interlinks.  \n \n2.  Design Features \nTo ensure that benefits of improved RWSS reach the poorest, the Project will be implemented in 40 communes. The commune \nselection process applied an index to rank 459 communes in six project provinces. The index was devised to consider poverty, \nincidence  of  illness,  household  water  supply  and  sanitation  coverage,  and  other  factors.  A  long  list  of  65  highest-ranked \ncommunes in six provinces was developed where the needs are greatest. The short list of 40 communes considers the presence \nof  other  development  partner-funded  RWSS  interventions  (to  avoid  overlap)  and  the  need  for  geographical  focus  (to  ensure \nefficiency  and  to  reduce  transaction  costs).  The  Project  will  work  in  a  manageable  16  districts  in  six  provinces.  Other  poverty \nreduction  design  features  include  (i)  its  highly  participatory  nature  (see  consultation  and  participation  plan);  (ii)  minimizing  the \nrequirement for household cash contributions to avoid additional cash burdens; and (iii) providing opportunities for private sector \nparticipation in RWSS, which will generate local jobs in construction, operation, and maintenance.  \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.   Findings of Social Analysis \nEmpirical evidence from the social analysis demonstrates clear links between poverty and inadequate RWSS. In rural Cambodia, \nthe lack of improved water and sanitary latrines heightens exposure to disease, with women and children the most vulnerable.  \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nResulting illnesses can reduce life expectancy and add financial burden to already very limited household resources. Results of a \nhousehold  survey  undertaken  in  the  six  project  provinces  support  this  finding.  Access  to  improved  water  and  latrines  in  the \nsurveyed communes is very limited, as only 12% reported access to sanitation. The incidence of waterborne diseases within the \nlast 2  weeks of the survey  was reported to be high. Households reported allocating a significant proportion (6%\u201311%) of their \nannual average household income to medical expenditure for water-related illnesses. \n \nA vast majority of households in the six project provinces reside in rural areas and are predominantly dependent on agriculture. \nThe average distance of villages to the nearest health facility ranges from 4 to 14 kilometers and from 8 to 42 kilometers to the \nnearest market. The provincial poverty headcount index in 2004 ranged from 33.7% in Battambang to 52.4% in Kampong Thom.e \nOnly Battambang had a provincial poverty rate lower than the national average of 35.1%. The proportion of rural households with \naccess  to  improved  water  supply  is  low,  ranging  from  17.2%  to  33.2%.    Access  to  sanitation  ranges  from  a  very  low  3.5%  to \n30.0%.f  In  2005,  the  infant  mortality  rate  (per  1,000  live  births)  for  the  six  provinces  ranged  from  67  in  Siem  Reap  to  97  in \nBattambang  (national  average:  66)  while  the  under-5  child  mortality  rate  for  children  ranged  from  94  in  Siem  Reap  to  116  in \nBattambang (national average: 83).    \n \nA  demographic  profile  of  sample  households  reveals  that  22%  are  female-headed,  the  average  household  has  5.3  members, \nand 98.4% are Khmer (1.4% are members of the Cham minority). Buddhism is the religion of 98%. Household heads generally \nhad  attained  elementary  education  (62.5%),  though  5.6%  had  some  secondary  schooling.  Nearly  one  third  of  households \nsurveyed  (31.3%)  had  no  schooling.  In  general,  female  heads  of  household  have  very  much  lower  levels  of  than  their  male \ncounterparts\u2014only 11.5% had some elementary and 1.0% some secondary education. Illiteracy is common.  \n \nThe  favored  sources  of  water  during  the  dry  season  include  ring  wells  (41.9%)  and  community  ponds  or  lakes  (19.6%)  for \ndrinking  and  cooking,  and  ring  wells  (85.7%)  and  community  ponds  or  lakes  (21.8%)  for  washing  and  bathing.  During  the \nrainy  season,  rainwater  is  preferred  by  48.4%  and  ring  wells  by  38.1%  for  drinking  and  cooking.  For  washing  and  bathing \nduring  the  rainy  season,  44%  prefer  lined  dug  wells  and  18.5%  prefer  community  ponds  or  lakes.  On  average,  households \nhave two storage jars with a capacity of 200 liters. During the dry season, nearly one in five respondents reported having to \npurchase water. Only about 6.3% of households reported using a filter for household water treatment. The female members of \nhouseholds  are  usually  responsible  for  water  collection  daily.  Cleanliness  of  water  containers  and  sources  is  normally  the \nresponsibility of women and girls, while men look after rainwater harvesting units. \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Summary of the Consultation and Participation Process during Project Preparation \nThe  consultation  and  participation  process  involved  a  detailed  stakeholder  analysis  and  subsequent  consultation  with \nidentified groups ranging from national-level government officials, development partners, and nongovernment organizations, \nto provincial-, commune-, and village-level officials and beneficiaries. A series of focus group discussions was undertaken as \npart  of  the  poverty  and  social  analysis  in  two  communes  to  identify  concerns  of  various  groups  (e.g.,  local  authorities  and  \nwomen's groups). The proposed village level participatory process was field tested under the two subproject feasibility studies \n(where a subproject is all interventions in one commune). A multidisciplinary team conducted  a participatory and interactive \nrural  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  hygiene  assessment  in  all  villages  of  the  commune,  including  planning  with  community \nmembers  and  village  officials.  Village  water  supply  and  sanitation  plans  were  formulated  on  the  basis  of  the  actual  village \nsituation, needs, and preferences of participating households. \n \n2.  What Level of Consultation and Participation Is Envisaged during Project Implementation and Monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3.  Was a Consultation and Participation Plan Prepared? \nA Project community mobilization and capacity building plan was prepared to incorporate the functions of community mobilization \nand participation, information dissemination, information and training on household water use, personal and domestic hygiene, \nwater point and latrine maintenance, village participatory planning, and community group strengthening. It includes institutional \nstrengthening for project management, water facility management, and sustainability of public sanitation facilities. \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues \nAs in most cultures, women and girls in Cambodia have primary responsibility for water, sanitation, and hygiene at the household \nlevel and play a crucial role in influencing the hygiene behaviors of young children. Yet they often do not have the accompanying \npower in decision-making. Traditional gendered attitudes and behaviors continue to reflect privileges in favor of men and boys at \nhome and at work. An extremely low level of access to sanitation facilities in rural areas not only poses health risks to all but also \npsychological and safety risks to women and girls. Since it is viewed as women's work, men and boys are often not targeted or \nprioritized for participation  in  activities aimed at promoting hygiene behavior at home and in the village. Women\u2019s  involvement \nwithout  the  accompanying  power  to  make  decisions  for  the  home  and  the  community  has  led  to  persistently  limited \nimprovements. Structural changes that could influence sanitation behavior and support men to accept women\u2019s stronger role in \ndecision making and planning have not been successful to date. For example, women are included among the core water and \nsanitation user group members, but their decision making is limited to the socially accepted domain of village leaders, who are \nmostly  older  literate  men.  At  the  national  government  level,  gender  beliefs  and  inequalities  at  work  mean  that  the  Ministry  of \nRural Development, as well as the provincial and district offices of rural development, lacks female staff members.  \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n53\n\n2.  Key Actions  \n\n \n\n  Gender plan       \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\nThe  gender  action  plan  includes  measures  to  (i)  increase  understanding  of  gender  issues  in  RWSS  at  all  levels,  and  (ii) \npromote women's meaningful participation in all project-supported activities (e.g., as peer-to-peer facilitators). Implementation \narrangements \nfor  women  and  children,  collecting \nsex-disaggregated data, and ensuring that a measurable proportion of women participate as both project staff members and \nbeneficiaries.  With a narrower geographical focus  and a  new structure  of village-level  facilitation that allows more time  with \neach community, facilitators will reinforce women's participation at all levels. Resources for gender action plan implementation \nare integrated into the overall project budget through the community and participation plan and budget.  \n\nthrough  each  commune  council's  committee \n\ninclude  working \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nIssue \n\nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nSignificant/ \nLimited/No Impact\nLimited to no \nimpact  \n\nIndigenous Peoples \n\nLimited to no \nimpact  \n\nLimited to no \nimpact \n\nLabor \n\n  Employment \nOpportunities \n\n  Labor \n\nRetrenchment \n\n  Core Labor \nStandards \nAffordability \n\nOther Risks and/or \nVulnerabilities \n  HIV/AIDS \n  Human Trafficking \n  Others \n\nStrategy to Address Issue \n\nThe scope of land acquisition for the Project \nis insignificant, and resettlement will be \navoided.

The Project is expected to provide improved \nwater to 377,000 people and access to sanitation for 290,000.  A gender action plan (GAP)  has \nbeen prepared to ensure broad understanding of, and attention to, the different needs of men and \nwomen in the rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) sector. It will ensure equal opportunities \nfor women and men in terms of access to project benefits and participation in training. This GAP is \nbased on gender analysis undertaken as part of the poverty and social analysis, and is designed \naccording to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Policy on Gender and Development (1998).  \n \nBackground \nA. \n \n \nThe total population of Cambodia is 13.4 million, of which about 6.9 million (51.5%) are \n2. \nwomen. 1  About  10.8  million  people  (80%)  live  in  rural  areas.  Out  of  the  2.3  million  rural \nhouseholds, nearly one third (29%) are headed by women. Most female heads of household are \naged  40  and  above  (64%),  and  a majority  (87%)  participate  in  the  labor  force.  The  Cambodia \nMillennium Development Goal targets in the RWSS sector include access to an improved water \nsource  for  50%  of  the  rural  population  and  access  to  improved  sanitation  for  30%  of  the  rural \npopulation  by  2015.  Progress  in  water  and  sanitation  is  essential  to  achieving  the  related \nCambodia Millennium Development Goal of empowering women: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nreduced time, health, and care-giving burdens from improved water services give \nwomen  more  time  for  productive  endeavors,  adult  education,  empowerment \nactivities, and leisure;  \nconvenient  access  to  water  and  sanitation  facilities  increases  privacy  and \nreduces risk to women and girls of sexual harassment and assault; \nhigher  rates  of  child  survival  brought  about  by  access  to  safe  water  are  a \nprecursor  to  the  demographic  transition  to  lower  fertility  rates,  as  having  fewer \nchildren  reduces  women\u2019s  household  responsibilities  and \ntheir \nopportunities for personal development; and  \ncommunity-based  organizations  for  water  management,  such  as  water  and \nsanitation  user  groups  (WSUGs),  can  improve  social  capital  by  giving  women \nleadership and networking opportunities and building solidarity among them. \n\nincreases \n\n \n3. \nCambodia has made progress in improving gender equity and equality. The importance \nof gender equity is reflected in the national strategic development plan.2 In 1999, the Ministry of \nWomen\u2019s  Affairs  launched  its  first  5-year  strategy,  Neary  Rattanak  (Women  are  Precious \nGems).  This  was  followed  by  Neary  Rattanak  II  (2004\u20132008),  and  Neary  Rattanak  III  will  be \nfinalized  in  2009.  Since  2004,  gender  mainstreaming  action  groups  have  been  established  in \nmost technical ministries, including the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD), and are chaired \nby a secretary or undersecretary of state. On 2 October 2006, the MRD gender mainstreaming \naction  group  approved  the  gender  mainstreaming  action  plan  for  2006\u20132010,3 and  the  group \nhas continued to increase MRD activities on gender issues and to collaborate with the Ministry \nof  Women's  Affairs.  Greater  involvement  of  and  coordination  with  this  group  is  planned  under \nthe Project, as well as alignment with the policy for gender mainstreaming in MRD. \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   National  Institute  of  Statistics,  Ministry  of  Planning.  2008.

Yet  they  often  do  not  have  the  accompanying  power  in  decision \nmaking.  Traditional  gendered  attitudes  and  behaviors  continue  to  reflect  privileges  in  favor  of \nmen and boys at home and at work. Issues include the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nGender norms dictate that women and girls must maintain privacy of their body and \nbodily  functions  to  retain  a  good  reputation.  The  very  low  access  to  sanitation \nfacilities in rural areas not only poses health risks to all, but also psychological and \nsafety risks to women and girls. \nGender norms also mean that men and boys are often not targeted or prioritized for \nparticipation  in  activities  aimed  at  promoting  hygiene  behavior  at  home  and  in  the \nvillage. This tends to be viewed as \"female work.\" Women\u2019s involvement without the \naccompanying power to make decisions for the home and the community has led to \npersistently limited improvement. \nChanges  in  structures  that  could  influence  sanitation  behaviors  and  support  men  to \naccept  women\u2019s  stronger  role  in  decision-making  and  planning  have  not  been \nsuccessful. For example, women are included among the core members of WSUGs, \nbut in most cases, decision making is limited to the socially accepted domain of village \nleaders who are mostly (older, literate) men. \nGender inequalities at work mean that MRD lacks female staff members. Out of MRD's \n2005 staff complement of 1,432 officials, just 220 (15%) were women (footnote 3). This \nis particularly the case within the Department of Rural Water Supply and at subnational \nlevels (e.g., provincial departments of rural development [PDRD] and district offices of \nrural  development).  Only  1  out  of  24  PDRD  directors,  1  out  of  70  PDRD  deputy \ndirectors, 4 out of 57 chiefs of office, and 4 of 50 deputy chiefs of office were women.  \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \nC. \n \n5. \nImplementation arrangements and estimated costs of the GAP have been integrated into \nthe overall arrangements and total project budget. The PDRD project teams (with the support of \nnongovernment  organization  consultants  and  the  project  coordination  unit  [PCU])  will  be \nresponsible  for  implementing  and  monitoring  GAP.  The  national  gender  specialist  and  other \nsocial  consultants  will  (i)  conduct  gender  awareness  training  for  project  units,  (ii)  support  the \nestablishment  of  sex-disaggregated \nfor  project  performance  monitoring  and \nevaluation,  and  (iii)  coordinate  with  other  specialists  during  subproject  preparation  and \nimplementation. The PDRD project teams will incorporate GAP monitoring in quarterly progress \nreports to the PCU, and the PCU will do the same in their reports to ADB and the Government.  \n \nD. \n \n6. \nThe summary GAP (Table A11) has been prepared to show how the project will benefit \nboth  men  and  women,  and  how  it  will  address  gender  disparities  in  the  RWSS  sector.  With  a \nnarrower geographical focus and a new structure of commune- and village-level focal persons \nthat allows more time with each community, facilitators will reinforce women's participation at all \nlevels, ultimately leading to a greater role of women in decision making. \n \n\nSummary Gender Action Plan  \n\nindicators \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nTable A11: Summary Gender Action Plan \n \n\nActions Proposed \n\nProject Output \nOutput 1: Improved Community Health and Hygiene Practices \nActivities: \n(i) \n\nIncrease community \nmobilization and action.  \n(ii)  Prepare village water supply \n\nand sanitation plans. \n(iii)  Form and train WSUGs. \n(iv)  Strengthen community groups \nand individuals for effective \ndeliver of health and hygiene \nmessages. \n\n(v)  Improve household \n\nmanagement of water supply \nand sanitation. \n\nSelect at least 50% women to serve as commune- and village-level focal persons. \nTrain  commune-  and  village-level  focal  persons  on  gender  issues,  the  GAP  and  its \nimplementation.  \nDevelop  awareness  among  women,  men,  and  children  on  health  and  hygiene  issues \nrelated to water use and sanitation.  \nWork with the commune council women and children\u2019s affairs committee.  \nEstablish WSUG boards with at least 40% women representation (at least two out of a \nfive-person board), and reinforce messages of women's decision-making power.  \nTrain all WSUG members on issues of women\u2019s participation.  \nProvide training for women in the care and maintenance of water facilities.  \nInclude at least one woman on any team for awareness and behavioral change.  \n\nOutput 2: Rehabilitated, Upgraded, and Developed Water Facilities \nActivities:  \n(i)  Rehabilitate or upgrade water \nsupply facilities to improve \nwater supply facilities.  \n(ii)  Develop new improved water \n\nReview, update, and adapt manuals and procedures to include gender perspectives.  \nEnsure that technologies are gender-friendly (e.g., easy to operate)  \nInclude at least one woman on all teams for subproject feasibility studies.  \nConduct  separate  focus  group  discussions  with  women  and  men  on  subproject \nfeasibility studies.  \nProvide  gender-disaggregated  information  in  subproject  feasibility  reports,  including \ndata on female-headed households.  \nInclude at least 40% women and 40% men in of awareness and  \nbehavioral-change training. \n\nsupply facilities.  \n\n(iii)  Improve monitoring of water \nquality for all water facilities \nrehabilitated, improved, or \ndeveloped. \n\nOutput 3: Improved Public and Household Sanitation \nActivities: \n(i)  Construct  public  latrines  at \nschools  and  health  facilities \n(five per commune).  \n(ii)  Provide household latrines. \nOutput 4: Strengthened Sector Planning and Development \nActivities:  \n(i) \n\nImprove monitoring and \nsupervision of RWSS facilities. \n\nConstruct separate public toilet facility blocks for females and males.  \nEnsure that public toilets are maintained and kept unlocked during school hours.  \nEnsure that women participate in the selection of household latrine technology.  \nEnsure latrines are gender-sensitive, with space and ventilation in female latrines. \n\nIncorporate  health  indicators  and  ensure  appropriate  information  collected  for  the \nRWSS database is disaggregated by sex.  \nGive  priority \nto  small  groups  with  at \nprivate-sector capacity development.  \nEnsure appropriate M&E indicators are disaggregated by sex.  \nTrack and report on project benefits for women.  \nEnsure that at least 40% of those that attend training on M&E from the commune and \nvillage levels are female. \n\nfemale  representation \n\nleast  60% \n\nfor \n\n(ii)  Support to WATSAN sectoral \n\nworking group.  \n\n(iii)  Strengthen private sector \ninvolvement in RWSS \ndevelopment. \n\n(iv)  Improve RWSS M&E for \n\nhealth outcomes. \n\nworkshops at the national and \nsubnational levels.  \n\n(ii)  Create capacity development \nprogram for MRD, PDRDs, \ndistrict offices of rural \ndevelopment, commune \ncouncils, and WSUGs. \n\nOutput 5: Improved Capacity for Project Implementation \nActivities:  \n(i)  Conduct project orientation \n\nInclude  gender  awareness  components  in  all  provincial  orientation  workshops  and \nMRD capacity development programs.  \nTrain  commune  council  on  gender  issues  in  RWSS.

A  commune-level  resettlement  action \nplan  (RAP)  will  consolidate  any  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  of  any  rural  water \nsupply and sanitation (RWSS) intervention. A full LARF is in Supplementary Appendix M. \n\nScope  of  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is \n2. \nexpected to be insignificant for the Project. Project interventions will require only small parcels \nof  land  for  the  construction  of  RWSS  facilities  in  rural  areas.  Past  experience  with  RWSS \nprojects  in  Cambodia  confirms  that  subprojects  can  be  designed  without  severely  affecting \npeople. Each subproject commune will require that village water supply and sanitation plans be \nprepared,  which  will  include  assessment  of  scope  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  for  the \nselected  civil  works  in  that  village.  As  with  the  Tonle  Sap  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation \nSector  Project  (TSRWSSP), 1  water  facilities  (such  as  wells)  will  be  built  on  private  land. \nProtected ponds, small piped water systems, and public latrines will be built on public lands. In \ncase where the community or individual elects to make voluntary land contributions, the process \nwill  be  transparent  and  will  not  have  undue  socioeconomic  impact  on  the  affected  landowner. \nThe  cost  of  any  contribution  will  be  estimated  and  included  as  part  of  a  water  and  sanitation \nuser  group's  (WSUG)  contribution  in  kind.  The  Project  will  not  relocate  households  for  the \nrehabilitation  or  construction  of  RWSS  facilities.  The  location  of  RWSS  facilities  will  be \ndetermined using a participatory, community-based approach. In a majority of cases, permanent \nland acquisition for RWSS facilities will be minimal. However, the scope can only be determined \nonce the mix of interventions is decided by the communities.   \n\n3. \nLegal and  Policy  Framework. There is no national policy for resettlement in Cambodia. \nThe  current  legislation  governing  land  ownership  is  the  Land  Law  (30  August  2001).  This  law \nsupersedes previous legislation and gives people access to land through the right of ownership, \nrecognized by Article 44 of the 1993 Constitution (24 September 1993), and states that no person \ncan be deprived of his or her ownership, unless it is in the public interest. The Constitution states \nthat  the  right  to  acquire  land  from  any  person  will  be  exercised  only  in  the  public  interest  as \nprovided for under law and will require fair and just compensation. A draft expropriation law and a \ndraft resettlement subdecree are being reviewed by the Council of Ministers.  \n\n4. \nAsian Development Bank's (ADB) Policy on Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) aims \nto  avoid  involuntary  resettlement  whenever  possible,  to  minimize  resettlement  where  population \ndisplacement is unavoidable, and to ensure that displaced persons receive assistance so they are \nat least as well off as they would have been in the absence of the Project. The policy stipulates \nthree important elements in involuntary resettlement (i) compensation for lost assets and loss of \nlivelihood  and  income,  (ii)  assistance  in  relocation  including  provision  of  relocation  sites  with \nappropriate facilities and services, and (iii) assistance with rehabilitation so as to achieve at least \nthe same level of well-being as before. The policy specifies that the absence of legal title to land \ncannot  be  considered  an  obstacle  to  compensation  and  rehabilitation  privileges.  All  affected \npersons\u2014especially  poor,  landless,  vulnerable,  ethnic  and  religious  minorities  households\u2014are \neligible  for  compensation,  transition  allowance,  and  rehabilitation  package.  The  principles  and \nentitlements described in the LARF are based on national laws and regulations, ADB policy, and \npreviously approved resettlement plans for other ADB projects. Principles and provisions adopted \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2005.

Wherever  a  gap  exists  between \nCambodian and ADB policy, the latter will supersede.  \n\nAffected  Persons.  Affected  persons  will  be \n\n5. \nidentified  during  subproject  social \nassessments during the preparation of village water supply and sanitation plans. A list of affected \npersons will be finalized after sites are selected and detailed designs are completed. The cut-off \ndate that sets the eligibility for entitlement will be determined accordingly. Lack of legal rights will \nnot affect the eligibility to compensation for land use, structure, and income losses. The types of \nproject-induced impacts are (i) loss of land, land use, and other assets (i.e., structures); (ii) loss of \nlivelihoods;  and  (iii)  loss  of  community  assets.  Compensation  and  entitlements  on  the  type  of \nloss/impact  and  categories  of  affected  persons  are  presented  in  the  LARF's  entitlement  matrix. \nCompensation will be based on replacement cost surveys. Specific losses will be determined by \nsocioeconomic  surveys,  existing  local  conditions,  market  prices  for  goods,  and  other  indicators. \nLand will, wherever possible, be replaced by land of equivalent quality and productivity.  \n\n6. \nImplementation  Arrangements.  During  subproject  appraisal,  at  least  two  public \nmeetings involving affected persons will be held in subproject communes and, where applicable, \na preliminary assessment of scope of resettlement impacts will be prepared. If the village social \nassessment  and  census  for  each  subproject  commune  identifies  new  categories  of  affected \npersons and types of loss that are not represented in the entitlement matrix, the commune RAP \nwill  be  revised  by  the  provincial  department  of  rural  development  (PDRD)  before  submission. \nThe  PDRD  will  prepare  the  commune  RAP  and  submit  it  to  the  project  coordination  unit  for \nforwarding to the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) for endorsement. MRD will then submit \nit  to  the  Interministerial  Resettlement  Committee  of  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  (or \nany  successor  agency)  for  review  and  approval.  MRD  will  then  submit  the  approved  plan  to \nADB  for  concurrence.  Approval  must  be  given  before  resettlement  activities  can  commence, \nand all RAP preparation activities must be completed before the award of work contracts.  \n\nEach  subproject  RAP  will  contain  the  compensation  budget  for  land,  structures,  other \n7. \nassets,  crops  and  trees.  Special  assistance  will  be  calculated  using  market  rates  to  arrive  at \nreplacement costs, and any associated costs will be based on rates stipulated in the LARF. The \nRAP  budget  will  also  include  other  costs  involving  disclosure,  public  consultations  and  focus \ngroup discussions, surveys, training and livelihood enhancement, and monitoring and evaluation. \nRAP  costs  are  expected  to  be  minimal  and  will  be  funded  by  the  Government.  A  grievance \nredress  mechanism  must  be  in  place,  and  a  RAP  independent  external  monitor  (or  individual \nconsultant) acceptable to ADB must be identified. Internal monitoring of commune RAPs will also \nbe  conducted  by  the  project  coordination  unit  through  PDRD  teams.  A  system  of  notifying, \ncompensating, and documenting payment to affected persons will also be established.  \n\n8. \nConsultation  with  affected  persons  must  start  early  during  the  subproject  preparation. \nPDRDs  and  local  authorities  are  responsible  for  ensuring  that  all  potential  beneficiaries  and \naffected  persons  are  properly  and  timely  informed  of  subproject  activities  to  be  carried  out. \nInformation  to  be  disseminated  should  include  the  type  of  work  to  be  implemented,  potential \nimpacts, and schedules. A record  of all consultations should be kept. All affected  persons have \nthe right of appeal against any aspect of (i) decisions made that are not in accordance with the \nRAP;  (ii)  commitments  given  to  them  on  which  they  disagree;  or  (iii)  the  level  or  manner  of \ncompensation,  including  land,  house,  or  shop  or  stall  relocation  and  compensation.  The  main \nobjectives  of  the  grievance  procedure  are  to  provide  a  mechanism  to  (i)  ensure  that  the \ncompensation and resettlement program has been implemented accurately and fairly, (ii) alleviate \nany adverse effects on affected persons, and (iii) mediate conflict and avoid lengthy litigation. It \nalso provides people who have objections or concerns about their assistance with an accessible \nand known procedure through which to raise and resolve objections.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n59\n\nA. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES \n \n\nThe economic analysis includes assessment of rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) \n1.  \ninvestments using two sample subproject communes, Bos Sbov in Banteay Meanchey and Kbal \nTrach  in  Pursat.1 During  implementation,  the  Second  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector \nProject  (the  Project)  will  include  similar  small-scale  investments  in  other  communes,  but  the \ntechnical  options  will  be  determined  under  a  participatory  approach  in  the  course  of  project \nimplementation. Therefore, a complete economic analysis of the entire Project is not yet possible. \nThis  economic  analysis  demonstrates  the  economic  justification  of  the  subproject  investments, \nand serves as a guide for the economic evaluation of succeeding subproject investments. \n\n2.  \nRationale for Government Involvement in the RWSS Sector. The economic rationale \nfor the Government of Cambodia's involvement in RWSS is based largely on poverty reduction. \nThe  Government's  RWSS  policy  framework  adopts  the  Cambodia  Millennium  Development \nGoal targets for RWSS; by year 2015, 50% of the rural population will have access to improved \nwater2 and 30% will have access to improved sanitation.3 The Government, as part of its RWSS \npolicy,  will  provide  most  of  the  initial  capital  investment  for  the  Project.  The  water  supply  and \nsanitation  user  group  (WSUG)  will  manage  the  facilities  after  their  completion  and  will  be \nresponsible  for  all  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs.  Based  on  the  Tonle  Sap  Rural \nWater  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project  (TSRWSSP), 4  about  85%  of  the  WSUGs \nestablished  are  still  active,  and  collection  of  O&M  fees  has  not  been  problematic.  Household \ncontribution will help to sustain the facility and to cover O&M costs.  \n\n3.  \nMain Assumptions. All monetary values are expressed in constant terms at June 2009 \nprices. The project life for the investment is assumed at 20 years, with no residual value at the \nend  of  the  project  life.  The  market  exchange  rate  is  KR4,106  per  $1.00.  All  taxes  and  duties \nwere excluded from the costs, and the economic cost of unskilled labor was taken as 70% of the \nmarket wage rate. O&M cost is assumed at 5% of capital investment costs.  \n\n4.  \nProject  Costs.  The  estimated  economic  project  cost,  in  constant  June  2009  prices,  is \nabout  KR2,585  million  (or  $532,043)  for  Bos  Sbov,  and  KR798  million  (or  $382,332)  for  Kbal \nTrach. The investment cost includes water supply and sanitation outputs.  \n\n5.  \nSince the Project will serve hundreds of villages in various hydrologic and socioeconomic \nconditions,  the  Project  does  not  propose  a  single,  specific  technology  for  either  water  supply  or \nsanitation. Instead, the Project offers a set of recommended options, from which the communities \nwill choose their preferred option. The Project had evaluated several options for both water supply \nand sanitation. Water supply alternatives include deep-tube wells with hand pumps, shallow-tube \nwells with hand pumps, covered dug wells with hand pumps, combined wells with hand pumps, \nponds  with  either  communal  or  household  filtration,  rainwater  collection  and  storage,  and \n\n                                                 \n1   The  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  also  prepared  a  sample  subproject  of  Pal  Hal  in  Preah  Vihear.  The \n\nprovince was subsequently removed from the geographical focus of the Project. \n\n2  Includes (i) percent of families using drinking water from an improved source; (ii) percent of families with piped water, \nwells with pumps, or ring wells at their houses; and (iii) percent of families with access to communal taps, wells with \npumps, or ring wells. Water is available for the whole year and distance to the water facility is 150 meters or less. \n\n3  Includes  flush  or  pour-flush  latrines  connected  to  a  sewage  system,  flush  or  pour-flush  latrines  connected  to  a \n\nseptic tank or pit, pit latrines with slabs, or ventilated improved pit latrines. \n\n4   ADB.  2005.

Sanitation  alternatives  include  dug-pit  latrines  with \npits lined with concrete rings, water-sealed latrines, and pour-flush latrines.  \n\n6. \nTwo alternatives for water supply were identified for the two communes, and each option \nwas further refined and developed using the results of the socioeconomic surveys.

The  main  benefits  quantified  for  the  water  supply  facilities  are  time \nsavings in the collection of water and reduced costs for water storage and for water treatment \n(i.e.,  water  filters  and  boiling).  For  the  sanitation  facilities,  benefits  quantified  include  avoided \nhealth  care  costs  and  productivity  loss  from  reduced  morbidity  and  mortality  rates  due  to \nwaterborne diseases. Waterborne diseases are mainly due to the poor sanitation and hygiene \npractices in the three communes (Table A13.2).  \n\nTable A13.2: Water-Borne Diseases \n\n% HH Members Who Experienced Waterborne Disease Over the Year \nTotal \n< 5 Years Old  > 5 Years Old \n\nAdults \n\nNever \n\n \nType of Illness \nKbal Trach \u2013 Pursat \nDiarrhea \nDysentery \nCholera \nTyphoid \nMalaria \nDengue Fever \nBos Sbov \u2013 Banteay Meanchey \nDiarrhea \nDysentery \nCholera \nTyphoid \nMalaria \nDengue Fever \n\n6.3 \n6.3 \n3.2 \n12.5 \n0 \n0 \n\n13.9 \n7.8 \n0 \n8.7 \n0 \n6.1 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n9.4 \n6.3 \n0 \n15.6 \n6.3 \n6.3 \n\n21.7 \n10.4 \n0 \n11.3 \n0 \n8.7 \n\n15.6 \n9.4 \n0 \n18.8 \n6.3 \n0 \n\n18.3 \n27.0 \n11.3 \n53.9 \n11.3 \n4.4 \n\n68.7 \n78.1 \n96.9 \n53.1 \n87.5 \n93.7 \n\n46.1 \n54.8 \n88.7 \n26.1 \n88.7 \n80.9 \n\n100 \n100 \n100 \n100 \n100 \n100 \n\n100 \n100 \n100 \n100 \n100 \n100 \n\n8. \nIn Bos Sbov (17 villages and 2,534 households), only 2.8% of households has latrines, \nand  in  Kbal  Trach  (4  villages  and  628  households),  only  1.3%  has  latrines.  Those  without \nlatrines  travel  30\u2013600  meters  to  defecate  in  fields,  forests,  or  yards.  The  Project,  therefore,  in \nthese three communes will also include provision of household latrines. Benefits can be realized \nby  developing  permanent  water  sources  closer  to  homes,  providing  improved  latrines,  and \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n61\n\nimparting  proper  hygiene  education  and  behavioral  change.  Since  population  density  in  rural \nareas  is  quite  low,  developing  rural  water  supply  systems  requires  several  very  small \ninvestments, with a water supply facility serving a relatively small number of households.5  \n\nThe Project\u2019s water supply facilities will reduce the total economic cost of obtaining water \n9.  \nfor  each  household.  Water  supplied  by  the  Project  will  replace  some  water  used  in  each \nhousehold  (nonincremental  demand).  During  the  dry  season,  the  Project  is  projected  to  replace \nmost water sources currently used by households, estimated at 8\u201315 liters6 per capita per day in \nthe two subprojects. During the rainy season, households will obtain some water from their current \nsources,  especially  rainwater.  No  incremental  water  demand  is  expected  to  be  generated  since \nthe design capacity of the proposed water facilities are 20 liters per capita per day on average.  \n\nThe  total  economic  cost  of  nonincremental  water  is  based  on  time  spent  on  collection, \n10.  \nstorage,  and  boiling  or  filtering  before  use.  Time  spent  in  collection  was  determined  from  the \nsocioeconomic surveys, and varies from 38 to 48 hours per household per month. The value of \ntime was measured at 70% of the official average rural wage of KR7,4207 per day. The existing \nstorage  cost  was  estimated  as  KR205,000  for  a  two  cubic  meter  storage  capacity  container, \nwith an average lifespan of 10 years. Households will continue to use storage facilities under the \nProject.

Private  benefits  were  quantified  using \nthe  per  capita  health  care  cost  and  productivity  cost  avoided.  Due  to  poor  sanitation,  the \naverage  per  capita  health  care  cost  is  $1.00  while  the  per  capita  productivity  loss  is  $0.40.8 \n                                                 \n5   For non-piped system, number of households served per system varies from 10 to 20 for wells and from 150 to 200 \n\nhouseholds for community ponds. \n\n6   Average water consumption for drinking and cooking is 20 liters per capita per day and for washing and bathing is 26 \n\nto 28 liters per capita per day.

The  time \nspent  by  the  beneficiary  to  defecate  in  fields,  forests,  or  yards  was  also  quantified  as  cost \nsavings  once  the  household  toilets  are  utilized.  On  the  average,  a  person  in  Bos  Sbov  would \ntravel 140 meters (one way) to defecate, while in Kbal Trach, a person would travel 60 meters \n(one way) to defecate. The Project has many other benefits that, due to constraints in time and \nresources, were not quantified. Other social benefits may follow from the reduced expenditure \nand time spent in collecting water, to the extent that the time and money saved is allocated to \nsocially beneficial activities like education. The sanitation output may also reduce latrine access \ntime and improved aesthetics (visual effects and smell).  \n\n12.   Benefit-Cost  Analysis.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  Bos  Sbov  and \nKbal Trach subproject communes is 18.2 and 19.7, respectively. The EIRR takes into account the \ncapital investment for water supply and sanitation  facilities, including the cost of the consultants \n(project management and capacity development) and incremental administration costs.9  \n\n13. \nSensitivity  Analysis.  Table  A13.4  shows,  for  each  commune,  the  percentage  change \n(switching values) in capital costs and gross benefits that would drive the EIRR below the hurdle \nrate of 12% (assumed economic opportunity cost of capital). The economic benefits are generally \nless  sensitive  to  changes  in  the  capital  and  O&M  costs  than  to  changes  in  gross  benefits.  The \nsustainability of the Project will depend heavily on adequate O&M of the facilities to keep the cost \nof supply below the current water sources and to maintain the expected lifespan of the facilities.  \n\nTable A13.4:  Switching Values for Capital Costs, Operation and Maintenance Costs, \nand Gross Benefits (%) \n\nCommune \n\nBos Sbov \nKbal Trach \n\nIncrease in \nCapital Costs \n35 \n41 \n\nIncrease in Operation \nand Maintenance \n112 \n143 \n\nDecrease in \nGross Benefits \n23 \n27 \n\n1 Year Delay in \nBenefits \n20 \n23 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n14. \nBenefit  Distribution  and  Poverty  Impact.  The  Project  will  benefit  various  groups.  The \nmost direct beneficiaries are the households that use the Project's water and those that choose to \nacquire private latrines. Among these beneficiaries, the benefit will increase with the decreasing \ndistance  from  the  home  to  the  water  source.  Households  that  choose  not  to  acquire  private \nlatrines  may  benefit  from  the  latrines  acquired  by  other  households,  if  environmental  quality \nimproves  from  the  increased  use  of  private  latrines.  Other  beneficiaries  include  the  owners  and \nemployees of firms engaged in construction of the water supply facilities and private latrines. The \npoor will also benefit as consumers and through the supply of manual labor. They will also supply \nlabor and cash to the Project (Table A13.5).  \n\nTable A13.5: Distribution of Net Benefits and Poverty Impact Ratios  \n(KR million) \n\nCommune \nBos Sbov \nKbal Trach \n\nConsumers \n1375 \n475 \n\nGovernment\n(1027) \n(311) \n\nLabor\n15 \n5 \n\nPoverty Impact Ratio\n0.44 \n0.52 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n15. \nA  few  groups  will  suffer  adverse  effects  from  the  Project,  such  as  owners,  employees, \nand  individuals  involved  in  selling  water  whose  supply  will  be  displaced  by  the  Project.

The \nProject is unlikely to generate significant new tax revenues, so the government and taxpayers in \ngeneral will not recover much of the cost of the Project. \n\nB. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nThe  financial  analysis  includes  the  review  of  the  TSRWSSP,  assessment  of  the \n\n16.  \nwillingness to pay, and affordability of the two sample subprojects.  \n\nTSRWSSP Experience. A review of the implementation and O&M of the non-piped water \n17. \nsystems in Battambang and Pursat provinces was done based on TSRWSSP records. Household \ncapital  contribution  (water  supply)  for  the  construction  cost  for  TSRWSSP  is  10%,  which  was \nprovided  in  cash  (3%)  and  in  kind  (7%),  in  the  form  of  labor  during  project  construction.  The \namount of contribution is based on the contract amount. Households can provide labor through (i) \nfencing  water  supply  facilities,  (ii)  digging  wells,  (iii)  filling  up  and  compacting  the  earth  around \nwells  or  ponds  built,  and/or  (iv)  constructing  the  platforms  for  water  supply  facilities.  In  cases \nwhere a household cannot provide the 3% cash contribution, they can provide labor equivalent \nto 10% of the project cost, provided there is another household that is willing to pay a total of \n10%  in  cash.  An  estimate  of  the  O&M  costs  for  completed  facilities  is  done  to  determine  the \nmonthly  contribution  of  the  households  served  by  the  water  facility.  Money  is  collected  by  the \nWSUG head, and receipts are provided to households as proof of payment.  \n\n18.   Willingness-to-Pay  for  O&M.  The  socioeconomic  survey  conducted  in  the  two  sample \nsubprojects  revealed  that  households  are  willing  to  contribute  for  the  maintenance  of  the \ncompleted water facilities. Table A13.6 shows the amount the households are willing to pay every \nmonth. In Bos Sbov, 98.3% of the households are willing to pay KR500\u2013KR2,500 ($0.12\u2013$0.61) \nper  month,  while  97.4%  of  the  households  are  willing  to  pay  KR1,000\u20132,500  ($0.24\u2013$0.61)  per \nmonth.  In  Kbal  Trach,  93.8%  of  the  households  are  willing  to  pay  between  KR500\u2013KR2,500 \n($0.12\u2013$0.61)  per  month.  However,  only  21.9%  are  willing  to  pay  KR1,000\u2013KR2,500  ($0.24\u2013\n$0.61) per month and 71.9% of the households are only willing to pay KR500 ($0.12) per month.  \n\nTable A13.6: Willingness-to-Pay for Operation and Maintenance \n\n \n \nCommune \nBos Sbov \nKbal Trach \n\nHouseholds willing to \npay KR500\u2013KR2,500 \n(%) \n\n98.3 \n93.8 \n\nHouseholds willing to \npay KR1,000\u2013KR2,500 \n(%) \n97.4 \n21.9 \n\nHousehold \nAverage  \n(KR per month) \n1,829 \n1,142 \n\nHousehold \nAverage  \n($ per month) \n$0.45 \n$0.28 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n19.   A  comparison  of  the  projected  monthly  O&M  fees  and  household  income  in  the  two \nsample subprojects was prepared (Table A13.7). Based on a capital investment of KR8 million \n(or $1,948.37) for a deep well with an Afridev hand pump, the estimated monthly O&M is about \nKR30,000  (or  $7.31).  Assuming  20  households  are  served  by  the  water  facility,  the  monthly \ncontribution for O&M is about KR1,500 (or $0.37) per household.  \n\nTable A13.7: Affordability of Operation and Maintenance Fees \n\n \n \nCommune \nBos Sbov \nKbal Trach \n\nAverage Monthly \n\nLowest Monthly \n\nIncome      \n(KR\u2019000 and $) \n439 ($106.92) \n271 ($66.00) \n\nIncome      \n(KR\u2019000 and $) \n83 ($20.21) \n44 ($10.72) \n\nContribution \nper month  \n(KR '000 and $) \n1.5 ($0.37) \n1.5 ($0.37) \n\nContribution/ \nLowest Monthly \nIncome (%) \n1.8 \n3.4 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 August 2009)  \n", "Currency Unit\nKR1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "riel/s (KR) \n$0.0002417795 \nKR4,136 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nCLTS \nCMDG \nDRHC \nDRWS \nEARF \nGAP \nIEE \nJMP \nLARF \nM&E \nMIME \nMOH \nMOP \nMOWRAM \nMRD \nNGO \nO&M \nPCU \nPDRD \nPPMS \nRAP \nRWSS \nTSRWSSP \nTWG-\nRWSSH \nUNICEF \nVDC \nWHO \nWSUG \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \ncommunity-led total sanitation \nCambodia Millennium Development Goal \nDepartment of Rural Health Care \nDepartment of Rural Water Supply \nenvironmental assessment and review framework \ngender action plan \ninitial environmental examination \nJoint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation \nland acquisition and resettlement framework \nmonitoring and evaluation \nMinistry of Industry, Mines and Energy \nMinistry of Health \nMinistry of Planning \nMinistry of Water Resources and Meteorology \nMinistry of Rural Development \nnongovernment organization \noperation and maintenance \nproject coordination unit \nprovincial department of rural development \nproject performance management system \nresettlement action plan \nrural water supply and sanitation \nTonle Sap Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project \nTechnical Working Group for Rural Water Supply, Sanitation, \nand Hygiene \nUnited Nations Children's Fund \nvillage development committee \nWorld Health Organization \nwater and sanitation user group \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "NOTE \n \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \n", "Vice-President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n", "C.
