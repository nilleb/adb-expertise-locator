Because of its mountainous terrain \nand lack of connectivity, ETMAP\u2019s per capita income in 2012 was only CNY10,327, which was \nabout  half  of  the  provincial  level;  the  poverty  incidence  is  40%  in  rural  areas.  The  ETMAP \nincludes  two  cities  at  district  level\u2014Enshi  and  Lichuan\u2014and  six  counties,  which  are  all \ndesignated  as  national  poverty  areas.  In  addition  to  poverty,  water  quality  deterioration, \nriverbank  erosion,  and  recurrent  flooding  are  key  factors  undermining  living  standards  and \nsustainable economic development in the ETMAP. \n \nThe Qing River is the primary water supply for Enshi and Lichuan and their surrounding \n4. \nrural  populations.  Since  the  1990s,  the  water  quality  of  the  Qing  River  and  its  tributaries  has \ndeteriorated. Monitoring data show that water quality in 45% of all cross sections is class IV, V, \nor  below, meaning  it  is unfit for  human  consumption.3 Water  pollution is most  serious  in  Enshi \nand Lichuan, resulting in odor and eutrophication. Continuing deterioration of the water quality \nposes  a  public  health  threat  for  local  residents,  who  rely  on  the  river  for  their  water  use.  In \naddition, \nthreatens  Qing  River  riparian  and  aquatic \necosystems, and limits opportunities for ecological diversity and tourism-related recreation. \n \n5. \nThe  major  sources  of  pollution  are  untreated  domestic  wastewater,  unregulated  runoff, \nand  inadequately  treated  industrial  effluent.  As  a  result  of  prolonged  underinvestment, \nwastewater collection and treatment facilities in Enshi and Lichuan are seriously deficient. Less \nthan 60% of wastewater from Enshi and Lichuan is collected and treated because of the lack of \ntreatment capacity, aging pipelines, and incomplete coverage of wastewater collection systems. \nThis  problem  will  become  increasingly  serious  with  economic  development  and  rapid \nurbanization,  as  projected  in  the  master  plans  for  Enshi  and  Lichuan.  Further,  there  are  no \nfacilities  for  collection  and  treatment  of  domestic  wastewater  and  solid  waste  in  rural  areas \nalong the Qing River and its tributaries. \n \n6. \nUpstream  of  Enshi  and  Lichuan,  the  Qing  River  watershed  is  mountainous  with  high \nseasonal rainfall and rapid runoff. This, combined with inadequate flood management facilities, \n\nthe  degraded  water  environment \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  preparing  the  Hubei \n\nEnshi Qing River Upstream Environment Rehabilitation Project. (TA 8424-PRC). \n\n3  Class  IV  is  suitable  for  general  industrial  water  supply  and  recreational  use  involving  no  direct  human  contact. \nClass V is suitable for agricultural water supply and general landscaping use. Below class V is unsuitable for any \nuse (PRC Environmental Water Quality Standard GB3838-2002). \n\n\f2 \n\nresults in regular flooding.  Following national flood management standards, flood management \nfacilities in Enshi and Lichuan should provide protection against 20-year floods in the short term \nand  50-year  floods  in  the  long  term.  The  existing  facilities  only  provide  protection  against  a \nmaximum of 4-year floods. There are some revetments along the banks within Enshi and a mid-\nsized  multipurpose  reservoir  on  the  upper  Qing  River.  However,  there  are  virtually  no \nrevetments  or  other  flood  control  measures  along  the  Qing  River  and  its  tributaries  flowing \nthrough  Lichuan.  Since  the  1950s,  at  least  nine  major  floods  have  occurred,  resulting  in \nsignificant loss of lives and property. There has also been severe riverbank erosion as a result \nof high-intensity rainfall, loss of vegetation, and lack of revetment works. This has caused heavy \nsiltation of the river and blockage in urban sections of the Qing River and its tributaries, which \nfurther exacerbates flood risk and water pollution. \n \nLack  of  integrated  water  resource  management  in  the  Qing  River  basin  hinders  a \n7. \ncoordinated  and  effective  response  by  planning,  pollution  control,  and  flood  management \nauthorities  to  improve  water  quality  and  reduce  flooding.  Weak  interagency  coordination  and \nlack  of  monitoring  and  enforcement  capacity  have  resulted  in  ineffective  management  of \nnonpoint  source  pollution  from  rural  and  urban  sources.  Important  rural  sources  include \ndischarges  of  domestic  waste  from  unsewered  rural  households,  agricultural  runoff,  animal \nwaste  discharges,  and  erosion  of  riverbanks  during  high-flow  conditions.  In  urban  areas, \nunregulated runoff along the riverbanks also contributes to nonpoint pollution, including garbage \ndumped along the riverbanks and inflow of wastewater due to leaks, clogging, and misalignment \nof wastewater pipes. While the river embankment is a critical flood management facility, proper \nmaintenance of the banks would also help reduce nonpoint pollution. \n \nGuided  by  both  the  national  western  region  development  strategy  and  the  Hubei \n8. \nprovincial 12th Five-Year Plan (2011\u20132015), the Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture \nGovernment  (ETMAPG)  is  committed  to  reducing  poverty,  improving  the  water  quality  of  Qing \nRiver, and advancing the ecological rehabilitation of the river and lakes. The ETMAP is covered \nunder  the  Water  Pollution  Control  Plan  for  the  Three  Gorges  Reservoir  Area  and  the  Upper \nReaches,  which  is  one  of  the  national  priorities  for  water  pollution  control.  The  provincial \ngovernment  has  formulated  and  approved  the  Qing  River  Basin  Pollution  Prevention  and \nControl  Master  Plan  (2010\u20132020)  and  the  ETMAPG  has  prepared  the  Qing  River  Near-Term \nFlood Control Master Plan (2013\u20132015),4 which was approved in 2012 by the Ministry of Water \nResources. To implement and complement components of these plans, the ETMAPG requested \nthat the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide financial and technical support for water quality \nimprovement and flood management in Enshi and Lichuan. \n \n9. \nWith support from  the  central  and provincial  governments,  the  ETMAPG  has  taken the \nfollowing steps to implement the master plans: (i) incorporate water quality improvement goals \nin performance evaluation of local governments; and (ii) implement more than 30 projects with a \ntotal  investment  of  CNY8  billion  for  sewage  network  improvement,  solid-waste  management, \nnonpoint source pollution reduction, river rehabilitation, and soil erosion control in 2014. \n \n10. \nThe project is consistent with the priorities of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u2013\n2015 for the PRC;5 the comprehensive reform agenda announced at the Third Plenary Session \nof  the  18th  Communist  Party  of  China  Central  Committee;6 the  strategic  priorities  of  ADB\u2019s \n                                                \n4  The  plan  includes  construction  of  the  Yao  Jia  Ping  Reservoir,  which  together  with  the  existing  Da  Long  Tan \n\nReservoir will provide greater flood regulation capacity for the upper Qing River basin. \n5  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2011\u20132015. Manila. \n6  Passed  at  the  Third  Plenum  of  the  18th  Central  Committee  of  the  Chinese  Communist  Party  on  12  November \n\n2013. \n\n \n\n\finfrastructure  and \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nthe  strengthening  of \n\nMidterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020,  7  and  the  Water  Operational  Plan. 8  Environmental \nsustainability  is  one  of  the  three  strategic  pillars  of  the  country  partnership  strategy.  The \ncomprehensive reform agenda announced at the  third plenum emphasized the need for better \nenvironmental \ninstitutional  development  and \nenvironmental services at the local level. \n \n11. \nPast  ADB  interventions  in  water  resources  management  in  the  PRC  and  other \ndeveloping  member  countries  include  investment  projects  and  technical  assistance  in  flood \nmanagement, water supply, and wastewater collection and treatment.9 The following are among \nthe  major  lessons  learned:  (i)  the  benefits  of  (a)  adopting  an  integrated  approach  in  the \nwatershed,  (b)  incorporating  nonstructural  measures,  and  (c)  incorporating  stakeholder  and \ncommunity  participation  and  public  awareness  raising;  and  (ii)  the  need  for  (a)  capacity \ndevelopment  for  project  management,  (b)  effective  project  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  (c) \nsustainable  financing  of  facilities  based  on  a  realistic  and  enforceable  tariff  structure.  The \nproject  incorporates  these  lessons  and  includes  a  number  of  innovative  design  features  in \nstructural and nonstructural components. \n \nB. \n \n12. \nThe impact will be the improved environmental ecological sustainability in the upper Qing \nRiver basin10. The outcome will be the improved river health and water resource management in \nthe upper Qing River basin. \n \nC. \n \n13. \nOutput 1: Wastewater management improved. The output will include improvement of \nwastewater  collection  systems,  expansion  of  two  existing  wastewater  treatment  plants \n(WWTPs),  and  construction  of  one  new  WWTP.  In  Enshi,  about  154  kilometers  (km)  of \ninterceptors and new branch sewer pipes will be installed; an existing WWTP will be expanded \nto provide  an  additional capacity  of  30,000  cubic  meters  per  day  (m3/d); and a new WWTP  of \n50,000 m3/d will be constructed and will meet class 1A effluent standards, including advanced \nsludge treatment and disposal capacity of 102 tons/day. In Lichuan, about 77 km of interceptors \nand new branch sewer pipes will be installed; pump stations will be constructed or improved; an \nexisting  WWTP  will  be  expanded  to  provide  an  additional  capacity  of  50,000  m3/d  and  meet \nclass 1A effluent standards, with advanced sludge treatment capacity of 688 tons/day; and an \nexisting  wastewater  treatment  facility  will  be  upgraded  to  improve  the  effluent  standard  from \nclass  1B  to  class  1A. 11  Energy  saving  and  greenhouse  gas  reduction  measures  will  be \nincorporated into the operation of the WWTPs. \n \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                \n7  ADB. 2014.

This output will include (i) construction of a \n14. \ntotal  of 66 km  of  river  embankments  with riverside amenities  in Enshi,  and  a total  of  49 km  in \nLichuan;  (ii)  dredging  of  silted  sections  of  the  Qing  River  and  tributaries  to  increase  the  flood \ncarrying  capacity  in  Enshi  (51  km)  and  Lichuan  (30  km);  and  (iii)  construction  of  ecological \nbuffer zones, including wetlands and amenity facilities, in Enshi and Lichuan. Pollution-intercept \nbuffer  zone  functions  will  be  incorporated  in  embankment  designs  including  vegetated \nembankments  and  constructed  wetlands.  Public  amenity  areas  will  be  constructed  along  the \nrivers  to  (i)  intercept  runoff  and  reduce  nonpoint  source  pollutants,  (ii)  renew  habitats  and \nrestore riparian ecosystems, and (iii) provide recreational space for residents and tourists. \n \n15. \nOutput 3: Water and environmental management integrated. This output will include \ndevelopment  of  (i)  a  2-year  pilot  participatory  program  in  Xinjie  village  in  Enshi  to  reduce \nnonpoint  source  pollution  by  improving  farming  practices,  training  farm  service  providers, \nproviding  subsidies  for  purchasing  formula  fertilizers  and  organic  fertilizers,  improving  solid-\nwaste collection, and installing biogas tanks to treat animal waste; (ii) a riverbank maintenance \nprogram,  including  community-based  environmental  supervision  and  public  education  and \nawareness-raising  initiatives  in  Enshi  and  Lichuan;  (iii)  a  sewerage  infrastructure  geographic \ninformation  system  and  asset  management  systems;  and  (iv)  a  flood  forecasting  and  warning \nsystem and introduction of water-sensitive land use planning in Enshi and Lichuan. \n \nOutput  4:  Inclusive  capacity  development  strengthened. The project will strengthen \n16. \ncapacity  and institutions for  project management. It  will  include training, capacity  building,  and \nconsultant  engagement  for  (i)  effective  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  project  using  the  project \nperformance management system; (ii) institutional and capacity strengthening for operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) of the structural works; and (iii) resettlement and social monitoring.  \n \n17. \nSpecial  features  and  value  addition.  The  project  will  demonstrate  that  international \nbest  practices  can  be  adopted  in  smaller  cities  in  poverty  areas  and  contribute  to  sustainable \nwater  resources  management  and  development  of  livable  cities  and  villages.  Successful \ntransformation of Enshi and Lichuan can be replicated by other smaller cities in less-developed \nareas.  The  ETMAPG  is  planning  major  investment  projects  to  implement  the  master  plans  for \nQing  River  pollution  control  and  flood  management.  In  addition,  the  central  government  will \nallocate  sizable  investment  and  grant  funding  to  implement  the  Ministry  of  Environmental \nProtection\u2019s  new  policy  to  improve  rural  environmental  protection.  The  activities  demonstrated \nunder  the  project  have  the  potential  to  be  scaled  up  through  ensuing  local  and  central \ngovernment initiatives.  \n \n18. \nA public\u2013private partnership (PPP) is under consideration for the O&M of the expanded \nLichuan WWTP. A memorandum of understanding was signed by the Lichuan city government \n(LCG)  and  ADB  on  expansion  and  O&M  of  the  Lichuan  WWTP.  The  PPP  will  enhance \ninfrastructure  efficiency  by  ensuring  that  the  plant  is  run  by  a  skilled  and  experienced  service \nprovider  with  appropriate  performance  incentives.  The  construction  of  the  WWTP  will  be \nundertaken  by  the  government,  and  O&M  will  be  tendered  as  a  concession.  The  LCG \nexpressed preference for a lease contract, which is one form of PPP. This could provide for an \nup-front payment from the lessee to the LCG to pay project development costs. The approach \nwill be suitable for replication in other infrastructure projects that generate user revenue. \n \n19. \nNonstructural  and  participatory  measures  are  also  introduced  to  complement  structural \nmeasures.  These  measures  include  a  village-based  pilot  program  to  reduce  nonpoint  source \npollution, a sewer infrastructure geographic information system and asset management system, \na flood forecasting and warning system, pollution characterization and management, community \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fenvironmental  supervision  and  flood  management,  a  riverbank  maintenance  program,  and \nwater-sensitive land use planning. The project design incorporates findings of an assessment of \npotential climate change impacts, and includes measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \nin the operation of WWTPs, and to increase climate resilience of flood management facilities. \n \nD. \n \n20. \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $231.62 million (Table 1). \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \n\nAmounta \n\nBase Costb \n1.

The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  5  years;  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  loan  and  project  agreements.  The \ngovernment has requested that the repayment will follow the straight line repayment option and \nthat the repayment dates are expected to be 1 March and 1 September in each year. Based on \nthe  requested  loan terms  and the  repayment  option,  the  average  loan maturity  is  15.25  years \nand  the  maturity  premium  payable  to  ADB  is  0.1%.  The  ADB  loan  will  also finance  taxes  and \nduties for eligible ADB-financed expenditures, and transportation and insurance costs included \nin the base cost for ensuring smooth project implementation. The loan will finance 43.17% of the \nproject cost, including civil works, equipment and materials, and institutional strengthening. The \nEnshi city government (ECG) will finance 36.7% of the project cost and the LCG 20.1% through \ncounterpart  funds  (Table  2).  Counterpart  funds  will  finance  some  civil  works,  land  acquisition \nand resettlement, survey, design, and supervision and monitoring. \n  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fSource \nAsian Development Bank \nEnshi City Government \nLichuan City Government \n\nTotal \n\nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \n\nAmount ($ million) \n\n100.00 \n85.10 \n46.52 \n231.62 \n\nShare of Total (%) \n43.2 \n36.7 \n20.1 \n100.0 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n22. \nThe PRC will be the borrower of the loan.

After detailed examination of the project\u2019s compatibility with local conditions, it was \nconfirmed  that  technical  feasibility  is  adequate.  Capacity  building  will  be  provided  to  ensure \nsustainable O&M of project facilities. \n \nB. \n \nThe economic analysis indicates that the project is economically viable, with an overall \n25. \ninternal  rate  of  return  of  17.2%  and  an  economic  net  present  value  of \neconomic \nCNY89.8 million.  The  rates  of  return  for  the  individual  outputs  are  10.6%  for  wastewater \nimprovement  in  Enshi  and  14.9%  in  Lichuan,  and  21.2%  for  river  rehabilitation  in  Enshi  and \n20.5%  in  Lichuan.  Sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  project  is  generally  robust  to  potential \nvariations in costs and benefits. In addition, the actual economic benefits are likely larger than \nestimated as some significant types of benefits are not quantifiable because of limited data. The \nfinancial  sustainability  assessment  for  the  nonrevenue  suboutputs  indicates  that  the  ECG  and \nLCG  have  sufficient  funds  to  finance  the  counterpart  contributions,  as  well  as  to  finance  debt \nservice  and  O&M  costs  during  operation.  During  implementation,  average  annual  counterpart \nfunding  accounts  for  0.55%  of  the  projected  revenue  of  the  ECG  and  0.67%  of  the  LCG.  The \nsum  of  annual  debt  service  costs  and  funds  required  for  facility  O&M  never  exceeds  0.1%  of \nprojected revenues from 2021 to 2034. \n \n26. \nThe financial  evaluation  for  output  1 in  Enshi  and  Lichuan  confirms that it  is  financially \nfeasible,  with  a  financial  internal  rate  of  return  of  4.60%  above  the  weighted  average  cost  of \ncapital  of  1.84%  in  Enshi  and  a  financial  internal  rate  of  return  of  5.00%  above  the  weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital  of  1.72%  in  Lichuan,  given  commitments  of  the  ECG  and  LCG  to  a \nprogressive increase in wastewater tariffs to achieve full cost recovery and to provide subsidies \nto fully cover funding shortfalls before tariffs reach full cost-recovery levels. The financial viability \nis  generally  robust.  Adjustments  towards  full  cost-recovery  tariffs  are  gradual  and  full  cost \nrecovery is achieved by  2026 in Enshi and by 2021 in Lichuan. The tariff affordability analysis \nshows  that  the  share  of  income  spent  on  water  and  wastewater  at  full  cost-recovery  levels  is \nless than 1.9% for average-income households and less than 2.6% for low-income households. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nfund \n\nGovernance \n\nNonetheless, the ECG and LCG have committed to (i) undertake periodic reviews of tariffs and \nfees following specified tariff setting mechanisms, (ii) assess the impact of wastewater collection \nfees  and  tariffs  on  the  poor  and  provide  necessary  subsidies  to  ensure  wastewater  collection \nservices to the poor, and (iii) hold public tariff consultation hearings to consult with the affected \npeople when setting or adjusting tariffs for wastewater. \n \n27. \nAssessment  of  the  financial  management  capacity  of  the  Enshi  Prefectural  Finance \nBureau,  Enshi  Urban  Construction  and  Investment  Company,  and  Lichuan  Liangli  Urban \nflow  arrangements,  staffing, \nConstruction  and  Development  Company  addressed \naccounting  and  audit  policies  and  procedures,  and  financial  information  systems.  Existing \npractices  are  generally  sound  but  lack  of  experience  with  ADB  projects  and  foreign-funded \nprojects was identified as an issue. The executing and implementing agencies have agreed to \nthe  proposed  measures  to  strengthen  their  financial  management  capability.  The  overall \nfinancial  management  risk  rating  of  the  project,  after  considering  mitigating  measures,  is \nmoderate.  The  identified  financial  management  risks  will  be  closely  monitored  during  project \nimplementation.13 \n \nC. \n \n28. \nAn  assessment  of  the  procurement  capacity  confirmed  that  the  executing  and \nimplementing agencies, acting through a procurement agency and with the assistance of ADB \nand  the  consultants,  would  have  adequate  procurement  capacity  to  facilitate  full  compliance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended from  time  to  time)  and Guidelines  on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Specific  policy  requirements, \ncapacity  development,  and  other  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  PAM.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \nETMAPG,  ECG,  and  LCG. The  specific  policy requirements  and supplementary measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \n29. \nAbout  70,900  households  will  benefit  from  improved  flood  protection  and  40,000 \nhouseholds  from  improved  wastewater  collection  and  treatment;  approximately  6%  of  these \nhouseholds  are  poor.  The  project  will  create  6,300  temporary  jobs  during  implementation  and \n105 permanent jobs during O&M. Jobs created under the project will be preferentially offered to \nwomen  and  to  people  displaced  economically  or  physically  under  the  project.  Focus  group \ndiscussions found that  environmental  improvements  are  anticipated to have significant gender \nand  poverty  impacts,  with  reduced  time  burdens  and  costs  for  health  care,  preparation  for \nfloods, and cleanup after floods.14 \n \nThe  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  A  gender  action  plan \n30. \ncontains  activities  to  ensure  project  benefits  contribute  to  improved  gender  equality  in  the \nproject area, including (i) women\u2019s participation in discussions on detailed designs, wastewater \ntariff  hearings,  community  activities,  training,  and  project  management;  (ii)  job  creation  for \nwomen; and (iii) inclusion of gender perspectives in capacity development of ETMAPG staff.15 \n \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n                                                \n13 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The \n\nsocial action plan is included in the PAM. \n\n15 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nE. \n \n31. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  A  for  environment,  and  an \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) and environmental management plan (EMP) have been \nprepared following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The EIA and EMP were disclosed \non  26  November  2014.  The  project  is  expected  to  have  environmental  benefits,  including \nimproved  water  quality  of  the  Qing  River  in  the  project  area,  reduced  flood  risk,  increased \nwastewater  treatment  capacity,  improved  sewage  coverage for  about  40,000  households,  and \nimproved  water  resources  management  capacity  of  the  ETMAPG.  Potential  environmental \nimpacts  are  a  result  of  the  planned  dredging  and  embankment  work,  and  construction-  and \noperation-related  disturbances.  During  preparation  of  the  EIA,  consultations  were  conducted \nwith  key  stakeholders  and  the  outcomes  have  been  integrated  into  the  project  design.  The \nETMAPG,  through  the  project  management  office  (PMO),  will  be  responsible  for  overall \nimplementation  and  compliance  with  the  EMP.  The  PMO  and  implementing  agencies  will  be \nresponsible for  site-based implementation  of the EMP. The  EIA  concludes that the  anticipated \nenvironmental impacts and risks can be mitigated through the implementation of the EMP. \n \n32. \nClimate change. An assessment of potential climate change impacts found the project \nat high risk for climate impacts, with an expected increase in temperature of 1.5o Celsius, higher \nrunoff,  more  variable  precipitation,  and  more  frequent  severe  storms  by  2031\u20132040.  In \nresponse,  the  project  design  incorporates  adaptation  measures,  including  a  flood  forecasting \nand warning system, community-based environmental supervision and flood management, and \nwater-sensitive  land  use  planning.  Measures  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  will  be \nundertaken as part of wastewater treatment standard operation practices. \n \n33. \nInvoluntary resettlement. The project is categorized as A for involuntary resettlement \nunder ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. It will permanently acquire a total of 73.15 hectares of \nland;  an  additional  145.28  hectares  will  be  occupied  temporarily.  The  project  will  demolish \n12,778 square meters of housing. It will economically displace 5,431 people, with 1,645 to lose \nmore than 10%  of  their agricultural  productive assets  and  143 to  be  physically  displaced.  The \nETMAPG prepared resettlement plans for Enshi and for Lichuan, in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  and  related  laws  and regulations  of  Enshi  and Lichuan,  Hubei  province,  and \nthe PRC. The ETMAPG will fully finance CNY132.61 million of land acquisition and resettlement \ncosts. The ADB loan will finance the costs for semiannual external resettlement monitoring and \nevaluation.  The  ETMAPG  has  experience  in  conducting  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  for \nforeign-funded projects and has the capacity to implement the project\u2019s resettlement plans.  \n \n34. \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  categorized  as  B  for  indigenous  peoples  under \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  ETMAP  has  an  ethnically  diverse  population  of  4.01 \nmillion\u201445%  of  people  are  Han,  46%  Tujia,  6.5%  Miao,  and  2.5%  belong  to  other  ethnic \ngroups.  The  project  area  has  similar  levels  of  ethnic  diversity.  The  ethnic  minorities  have \nsocioeconomic and livelihood systems similar to the mainstream population in terms of income, \neconomic  activities,  and  education,  and  no  language  or  other  cultural  barriers  were  identified. \nThey  will  benefit  equally from the  project  activities. To ensure the  benefits  are  accrued by  the \nethnic  minorities,  an  ethnic  minority  development  plan  was  prepared  and  endorsed  by  the \nETMAPG. \n \n35. \nGrievance  redress  mechanism.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  to  address  social \nand environmental concerns of stakeholders has been designed and will be established by the \nPMO.  The  PMO  will  have  final  responsibility  for  handling  any  disputes  within  the  grievance \nredress mechanism. The procedures are described in the PAM. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n \nF. \n \n36.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4, and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.16 Risk assessment for the overall project is \nmedium and the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nImplementation delays \ndue to the limited \nexperience of the project \nmanagement office and \nimplementing agencies \nBuildings and \ncommunities are not \nconnected to the new \nsanitary sewers installed \nunder the project \n\nProject implementation is \ndelayed because of \ndelays in land acquisition \nand resettlement \n\nMitigating Measures \nETMAPG will hire a qualified tendering agent with ADB procurement experience. The \nproject will provide consulting services for technical support and on-the-job trainings on \nprocurement, disbursement, and financial management. ETMAPG has established a \ngood relationship with the project implementing agencies of other ADB-funded projects \nto gain knowledge on loan implementation. \nFor buildings and communities where developers having legal title can be identified, \npipes connecting the buildings and communities to the sanitary sewers will be procured \nand installed by the property owners or developers in accordance with a regulation \nissued by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development. For other \ncommunities, pipes connecting communities to the sanitary sewers will be installed \nunder the project and financed by Enshi and Lichuan. Both cities have provided written \nassurances to install all connections within 2 years following installation of interceptor \nand branch pipes. \nThis risk will be mitigated through the implementation of measures laid out in the \nresettlement plan. A full-time resettlement staff member will be assigned to the project \nmanagement office for the smooth implementation of land acquisition and resettlement. \nThe project management office will conduct internal monitoring of resettlement plan \nimplementation and report to ADB through semiannual project progress reports. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, ETMAPG = Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture Government  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \nThe  government,  through  the  Hubei  provincial  government  and  the  ETMAPG,  has \n37. \nassured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies \nincluding \nthose  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement, \nconsulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the  PAM and loan documents. \nThe government has also agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set \nforth in the loan and project agreements. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n38. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$100,000,000  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Hubei  Enshi  Qing  River  Upstream \nEnvironment  Rehabilitation  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility;  for  a term  of  25  years,  including  a grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements presented to the Board. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n                                                \n16 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n20 August 2015\n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \nResults Chain \nOutcome \nRiver health \nand water \nresource \nmanagement \nin the upper \nQing River \nbasin improved \n\nOutputs \n1.
