THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased loan to Nepal for the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Customs Reform and \nModernization for Trade Facilitation Program.1 \n \n2.  The program will support the simplification, harmonization, and modernization of Nepal\u2019s \ntrade processes to meet international standards. This will contribute to Nepal\u2019s national goals of \npromoting and diversifying exports, and help the country fulfill its commitments to the Trade \nFacilitation Agreement (TFA) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and related international \nstandards on customs. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The development problem. Nepal is a least developed country (LDC) aspiring to attain \nmiddle-income status by 2030, and the manufacturing sector will play a key role in achieving the \naspiration.2 In line with the global 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Government of \nNepal has adopted development strategies that aim to expand the manufacturing sector and \npromote merchandise exports as vehicles for economic growth and poverty reduction.3 The \nperformance of Nepal\u2019s manufacturing sector has been lackluster, with its share in gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) declining over the years. The ratio of Nepal\u2019s exports to GDP has also declined \nsteadily, the merchandise trade balance has worsened, and exports remain concentrated in a few \nmarkets and commodities.4  \n \n4.  As a landlocked country virtually isolated from external markets, Nepal has high transport \nand trade costs. High trade costs impede export competitiveness and are often attributed to high \ntariffs and inadequate transport and trade-related infrastructure. To make  its export sector \ncompetitive,  Nepal  liberalized  its  trade  regime  by  cutting  tariffs  and  removing  quantitative \nrestrictions. However, infrastructure deficiency and nontariff barriers pose challenges in reducing \ntrade costs further. Studies have shown that inefficient, unpredictable, and opaque customs \nprocedures are among the primary nontariff barriers in developing countries\u2014contributing to high \ntrade costs, poor business climate, and inability to integrate into global value chains.5 In a 2016 \nbusiness survey involving 501 Nepalese traders, 51% of exporters and 21% of importers reported \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of Nepal, National Planning Commission; and Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2016.

Kathmandu. \n3  Reference to trade as an engine for growth is made across the 2030 Agenda\u2019s 17 Sustainable Development Goals \nand  179  targets,  including  a  doubling  of  LDCs\u2019  export  market \nshare.  https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld. The Government of Nepal has called \nfor greater availability of concessionary loans and other forms of international support to improve Nepal\u2019s trade \ncompetitiveness and lower its trade costs. Government of Nepal, National Planning Commission. 2015. Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals, 2016\u20132030: National (Preliminary) Report. Kathmandu. \n4  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The manufacturing sector\u2019s share \nof GDP declined from 9.5% in the mid-1990s to 6.5% in 2015. The ratio of merchandise exports to GDP declined \nfrom 15.4% in FY2000 to 5.1% in FY2014. The goods trade deficit more than doubled from 13.8% in FY2000 to \n30.3% in FY2016. \n5  WTO. 2016. Trade costs and inclusive growth: Case studies presented by WTO chair-holders. Geneva; International \nTrade Centre. 2016. SME Competitiveness Outlook: Meeting the standard for trade. Geneva; and WTO. 2016. World \nTrade Report 2016: Levelling the trading field for SMEs. Geneva. \n ", "2 \nfacing nontariff issues or procedural obstacles to trade.6 Estimates show that for Nepal, nontariff \ntrade costs are equivalent to applying a 325% ad valorem tariff on manufactured exports, 523% \non agricultural products, and 391% overall.7 Inaction on nontariff barriers, including those related \nto customs, imposes an opportunity cost for Nepal\u2019s businesses, government revenues, and the \neconomy as a whole. \n \n5.  Nepal has made a global commitment to undertake customs reforms by acceding to the \nWTO\u2019s TFA, the first multilateral trading agreement signed since the WTO was established in \n1995. The TFA aims to simplify, modernize, and harmonize export and import processes primarily \nthrough reforms to customs clearance procedures. Implementing TFA reforms for LDCs like Nepal \nis expected to increase the number of products exported by destination by 11.8%\u201312.8% and \nraise the number of destinations by product by 14.1%\u201321.3%. With nearly 90% of Nepalese \nexporters depending on imported inputs, improved customs procedures are expected to reduce \ntrading costs, lower the cost of importing inputs, and make exports more competitive.8 \n \n6.  Binding  constraints.  Although  Nepal\u2019s  Department  of  Customs  (DOC)  has  made \nprogress in introducing reforms and automation, it has largely remained a revenue-collecting \nenforcement body. It has yet to fully embody the \u201cCustoms in the 21st Century\u201d vision of the World \nCustoms Organization (WCO), which broadens the role of customs from regulating trade to \ninclude facilitating it.9 Customs clearance procedures in Nepal remain focused on exercising at-\nthe-border controls, subjecting some 80% of traded goods to physical inspection.10 Border \ncheckpoints are congested, and facilities and mechanisms for pre-arrival or post-clearance \n(behind-the-border)  processing  are  inadequate. 11  Legitimate,  low-risk  trade  suffers  from \ninefficient processes, and is subject to the same red tape as potentially illicit, high-risk trade.12 \nThese constraints not only result in higher trade costs, but also revenue leakages. They pose \nsocial, environmental and cultural safety, and security risks. The lack of modern, risk-based \nprocedures and institutional structures has also prevented the DOC from implementing customs \nprocedures with economic impact (CPEI), which are needed to support the export sector.13 The \nkey elements of the constraints are: \n                                                \n6  International Trade Centre. 2016.

This policy document redefines the role of customs administrations to meet the \nnew demands arising from the globalization of trade. Such demands task customs to exercise effective security and \ncontrol of international supply chains, while undertaking greater facilitation of legitimate trade. \n10 The DOC\u2019s Automated System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA) system identifies high-risk cargo for red lane clearance \nwith physical inspection, low-risk cargo for green lane clearance with minimum inspection, and medium-risk cargo \nfor yellow lane clearance with document verification before release. It also generates statistics on the clearance rate \nof the three lanes.    \n11 Government of Nepal, Ministry of Finance, DOC. 2017. Time Release Study Report: Mechi & Biratnagar Customs \n2017. Kathmandu. \n12 Illicit trade includes (i) trade in counterfeit or contraband goods; (ii) smuggling of highly taxed goods, arms, cultural \nartefacts, and other items that threaten the security and safety of the society; and (iii) noncompliant trade, which \navoids payment of duties and fees. \n13 The term CPEI was coined by the European Union\u2019s Customs Union and refers to specific measures to support the \nexport sector. CPEI include customs warehousing, inward and outward processing, temporary admission of goods, \nand transit. Customs-related transit measures include the adoption of the Customs Convention on the International \nTransport of Goods Under Cover of TIR Carnets (TIR Convention). \n ", "3 \n(i)  Absence of a legal framework to introduce a risk-based approach. Nepal \nlacks the legal provisions to enable customs to play the role of a trade facilitator. \nThe legislative framework governing customs procedures needs to incorporate the \nlegal basis for adopting a risk-based approach. This includes incentivizing traders \nwith a good record of compliance to benefit from faster clearance. \n(ii)  Unpredictable  and  inconsistent  clearance  procedures,  unsupported  by \nmodern  tools.  Predictable  and  transparent  customs  clearance  requires  a \ncoherent compliance strategy that integrates behind-the-border functions of risk \nanalysis  and  management,  intelligence,  valuation,  post-clearance  audit,  and \nadvance rulings. These are not in place or are underutilized in Nepal. In addition, \nmany  customs  border  offices  are  not  connected  electronically  to  the  DOC \nheadquarters, which hinders the application of unified and consistent customs \nprocesses across the country. \n(iii)  Dated institutional structure. The DOC\u2019s organizational structure is not designed \nfor modern customs procedures. Currently, 1,114 of the DOC\u2019s 1,283 customs \nofficers (87%) are stationed at the field offices to conduct traditional at-the-border \nprocesses, and only a small number of staff at the DOC headquarters performs \nbehind-the-border functions. Some of these functions, which require independent \nsections with segregated responsibilities, are dispersed within a larger entity. The \nDOC organizational chart does not reflect the links between the responsibilities of \ndifferent sections, and mechanisms to facilitate cross-section coordination are not \nstrong.  Weakness  in  the  procurement  and  automation  sections  precludes \nsustainable upgrading of the customs infrastructure. \n(iv)  Shortage  of  requisite  human  resource  capacity  for  a  modern  customs \nadministration. The qualifications of most DOC staff are not aligned with the \ntechnical expertise needed to execute behind-the-border functions. About 80% of \nthe workforce is composed of junior level non-officers with limited competency. \nNepal\u2019s civil service system also imposes a 2-year staff rotation requirement, which \nmakes retention of technical expertise within one agency a challenge. The DOC\u2019s \napproach to staff training has remained unplanned, without a comprehensive \nanalytical basis or a long-term vision. \n \n7.  Government reform agenda. Trade facilitation as a means to promote exports is a \npriority  in  Nepal\u2019s  national  development  agenda14 as  envisaged  in  the  14th  periodic  plan, \nFY2017\u2013FY2020  and  the  Nepal  Trade  Integration  Strategy,  2016.15 To  this  end,  Nepal\u2019s \nParliament has ratified two key international agreements on expediting the movement, release, \nand clearance of goods: the WCO\u2019s revised Kyoto Convention (RKC) and the WTO\u2019s TFA.16 \nAccording to the government\u2019s 2015 WTO TFA gap assessment and implementation action \nplan,17 Nepal will comply with 31 of the 37 TFA measures by January 2022. The DOC will lead \nthe implementation of 18 and co-lead in 15 of the 37 measures\u2014most of them related to legal \nand procedural reforms, institutional framework, and training.18 The TFA\u2019s entry into force on \n                                                \n14 The development policy letter is in Appendix 3. \n15 Government of Nepal, National Planning Commission. 2016.

Since  2003,  the  DOC  has  been  implementing  the  multiyear  Customs  Reform  and \nModernization Strategies and Action Plan (CRMSAP) in phases. Key achievements under the \nfourth  phase  of  the  CRMSAP,  2013\u2012201720 include  ratification  of  the  RKC,  rollout  of  the \nAutomated System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA) World,21 and commencement of the national \nsingle window,22 all of which have contributed to improved TFA compliance. The Ministry of \nFinance has approved the fifth phase of the CRMSAP, 2017\u20122021,23 which aims to transform \ncustoms operations to risk-based, paperless e-Customs, and to introduce CPEI to promote \nexports. Its strategic priorities and time-bound action points align with Nepal\u2019s implementation \nschedules for the WTO\u2019s TFA and the RKC (footnote 18). \n \n9.  The proposed program. The proposed program fully aligns with the reform priorities and \nimplementation period of the CRMSAP, 2017\u20122021. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has \nprovided long-term policy assistance to support Nepal\u2019s trade facilitation sector in planning, \nimplementing, and evaluating the CRMSAP phases. Budget support is considered appropriate to \nfinance part of the projected resource gap to implement the CRMSAP, 2017\u20122021. The policy \nactions trigger and support (i) reforms on legal and procedural issues, (ii) simplified and unified \nprocedures backed by automation tools, (iii) institutional reorganization, and (iv) human resources \ndevelopment.  These  would  help  Nepal  substantially  fulfill  its  WTO  TFA  commitments  and \ncomplement the related activities of the government and other development partners, including \nthose that have committed to support the TFA (para. 14). The two-tranche approach will allow for \nsequential reform milestones to be achieved in the short to medium term, setting the path toward \nthe longer-term reform targets. This would sustain the impact of ADB\u2019s multidimensional support \nthrough continuous policy dialogue, investment, budget support, and capacity development at the \nnational and South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) levels. \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s experience and value addition. ADB\u2019s support for trade facilitation in Nepal dates \nto 1996 when it introduced automation to customs administration. While ADB has kept automation \nas the backbone, its contributions have evolved and it has increasingly combined the delivery of \npolicy and capacity development support for legal, regulatory, and procedural reforms with the \ninvestment of resources needed to implement them.24 ADB has helped the DOC (i) prepare for \naccession to the RKC; (ii) conduct the midterm review of the CRMSAP, 2013\u20122017 and formulate \nthe CRMSAP, 2017\u20122021; (iii) compile an e-Customs master plan; (iv) establish customs client \nservice desks; (v) conduct Time Release Studies (TRSs);25 and (vi) draft legal amendments to \nthe Customs Act, 2007 and related procedures for taking in relief consignment after the April 2015 \nearthquake and for lodging electronic declarations to launch the ASYCUDA World pilot projects. \n                                                \n19 WTO.

Regular conduct of TRSs is part of the WTO\u2019s TFA (Article 7.6). \n ", "5 \nADB\u2019s primary value addition is founded on the sector knowledge gained through its long-term \nengagement in Nepal\u2019s trade facilitation. The government\u2019s confidence in the partnership with \nADB also testifies to ADB\u2019s record of translating knowledge into effective advisory and analytical \ninputs to DOC\u2019s policy formulation.  \n    \n11.  ADB, as an advocate of regional cooperation and integration, brings the added value of \ncomplementing country-level support to Nepal\u2019s trade facilitation with subregional initiatives. \nSince 2001, the ADB-supported SASEC program has provided a platform for member countries \nto address trade facilitation issues of subregional concern collectively, including those identified \nin the WTO\u2019s TFA.26 The SASEC Trade Facilitation Strategic Framework, 2014\u20132018 envisages \ngreater harmonization of trade procedures among the SASEC countries.27 The SASEC Customs \nSubgroup, established in 2013, provides a venue for dialogue and capacity building among \ncustoms  directors  general  of  member  countries  on  common  issues  related  to  customs \nmodernization, in line with the WTO\u2019s TFA and other related international conventions.  \n \n12.  ADB lessons learned. Key lessons from earlier ADB projects and an ADB program28 \npoint to (i) the appropriateness of two-tranche releases for policy-based lending to trigger and \nmaintain reform momentum; (ii) the importance of sustained policy dialogue with concerned \ngovernment agencies and private sector stakeholders to ensure implementation success; and \n(iii) the need for associated technical assistance (TA) to help the government achieve timely \nprogram and project completion. \n \n13.  Alignment  with  ADB  strategies.  The  program  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership strategy, 2013\u20122017 for Nepal, which highlights support for customs modernization \nand transport connectivity as complementary investments to be coordinated through the SASEC \nprogram.29 The proposed program is in the project pipeline of ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for \nRegional Cooperation and Integration, 2016\u2012202030 and aligns with the SASEC Operational Plan \n2016\u20122025.31 \n \n14.  Development partner coordination. Development partners coordinate interventions in \nsupport of Nepal\u2019s trade facilitation on multiple levels: (i) formally through the national Aid for \nTrade32 mechanism, the SASEC Customs Subgroup, and the global TFA Facility;33 and (ii) more \nflexibly at the project level or through targeted collaboration in discrete activities.34 At the project \nlevel, ADB has established a close partnership with the United Nations Conference on Trade and \nDevelopment in implementing successive ASYCUDA projects. The World Bank\u2019s Nepal\u2013India \nRegional Trade and Transport Project is further developing a national single window, conducting \n                                                \n26 Nepal is a founding member of the ADB-supported SASEC program.

The outcome will be increased access by legitimate trade to \nsimplified, harmonized, and modernized trade processes. This will be measured through greater \nuse of green lane clearance for low-risk cargo (footnote 10), an increased percentage of web-\nbased customs declaration clearance through ASYCUDA World, a reduction in the average \ncustoms clearance time,36 and an overall improvement in trade facilitation indicator (TFI) scores.37 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n16.  The program will support a policy framework, which is detailed in the policy matrix in \nAppendix 4. The policy actions will focus on six trade facilitation strategic priorities, all featured in \nthe WTO TFA articles and central to the DOC\u2019s transformation to risk-based, trade-facilitating \noperations, collectively introducing and enhancing  behind-the-border processing. These are \n(i) risk management, (ii) post-clearance audit, (iii) advance ruling, (iv) trade facilitation measures \nfor authorized operators, (v) pre-arrival processing, and (vi) expedited shipment. The program\u2019s \ncomprehensive review of customs legislation and expansion of customs automation will improve \nNepal\u2019s compliance with 19 more WTO TFA articles. The program will thus help Nepal comply \nwith 25 of the 37 WTO TFA articles, which is expected to result in a significant improvement in \nNepal\u2019s TFI scores.38 These 25 articles target reform areas that (i) require the DOC to lead the \ngovernment\u2019s compliance efforts; (ii) are listed under the medium-term implementation schedule \nof 2\u20135 years from TFA ratification; (iii) have a high degree of alignment with the RKC commitments \nand  the  CRMSAP,  2017\u20122021  action  points;  and  (iv)  complement  ongoing  work  of  the \ngovernment and its development partners (footnote 18). The program will also strengthen the \nDOC\u2019s institutional capacity to handle automation, procurement, accounting, and staff integrity \npromotion as enablers of the TFA reforms. The program\u2019s policy matrix of two tranches, each \ncomprising 10 policy actions,39 is designed to target the four elements of the binding constraints.  \n \n17.  Output 1: National policy and legal framework for trade facilitation improved. The \nprogram  will  support  (i)  accession  to  the  WTO\u2019s  TFA  and  the  RKC  General  Annex; \n(ii) achievement of the CRMSAP, 2017\u20132021 implementation milestones; (iii) submission of the \nlegal amendments to the cabinet to comply fully with the RKC General Annex and with WTO TFA \n                                                \n35 World Bank. Nepal\u2013India Regional Trade and Transport Project.  http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P144335? \nlang=en&tab=overview. \n36 The measurements will be from the TRSs (footnote 25). The 2016 TRS data (footnote 11) are in Sector Assessment \n(Summary): Industry and Trade; and Nepal\u2019s Development Context and the Role of Trade Facilitation (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n37 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Trade facilitation indicators.  http://www.oecd.org/ \ntrade/facilitation/indicators.htm. \n38 Nepal\u2019s score for 2015 was 0.8 on a scale of 0 to 2 (2 being the best possible performance). The CRMSAP, 2017\u2013\n2021 performance indicators include improvement of the TFI score to 1.3 by July 2021 (footnotes 18 and 24).  \n39 Tranche 1 policy actions are substantially completed in May 2017. The government will submit to ADB evidence of \ncompliance by the end of June 2017 as stated in Evidence of Compliance with the Policy Matrix (accessible from the \nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "7 \nmeasures  on  the  six  trade  facilitation  strategic  priorities;40 and  (iv)  drafting  of  legislative \namendments and new legislation to comply with 19 customs-related TFA measures and CPEI. \n \n18.  Output  2:  Customs  procedures  improved.  The  program  will  introduce  risk-based \napproaches  to  Nepal\u2019s  customs  clearance,  and  the  government  will  apply  the  streamlined \nprocedures across the country. The program will promote further automation, which will enable \nthe application of consistent and transparent clearance procedures. It will support (i) pilot testing \nof reengineered customs declaration processing steps in three customs offices,41 (ii) pilot testing \nof ASYCUDA World in 10 customs offices,42 and (iii) implementing a risk management framework \nand standard operating procedures. \n \n19.  Output 3: Department of Customs organizational structure strengthened. To enable \nthe implementation of the centrally monitored, risk-based approach, the program will strengthen \nthe DOC\u2019s organizational structure to perform the behind-the-border tasks identified in the six \ntrade facilitation strategic priorities. The organizational restructuring exercise will revise the \norganizational chart to (i) rationalize the reporting channels of key technical sections, (ii) define \nthe terms of reference for the sections, (iii) install mechanisms for better data sharing and \ncoordination between the sections, and (iv) create new sections where needed. As part of the \nrestructuring, ADB\u2019s associated stand-alone TA (para. 22) will help DOC analyze the required \nqualifications and terms of reference for individual staff positions. The DOC will implement the \nrestructuring plan in incremental phases for a gradual but sustainable change. The program will \nsupport the (i) review of the DOC\u2019s organizational structure, (ii) formulation of a realignment plan, \n(iii) completion of the initial phase of the realignment plan, and (iv) establishment of a risk \nmanagement section. \n \n20.  Output 4:  Department of Customs\u2019 capacity enhanced. The adoption of the risk-based \napproach in customs operations in Nepal will require a long-term training plan for DOC staff to be \nimplemented with adequate training tools. The government will prioritize the training required in \nthe  six  trade  facilitation  priority  areas,  and  the  related  areas  of  procurement,  automation, \naccounting,  and  staff  integrity.  To  fill  technical  capacity  gaps  and  address  staff  rotation \nconstraints, the DOC will launch a pool of experts scheme. This will involve a roster for customs \nexperts to act as trainers or to undertake specialized assignments with the DOC. The program \nwill support the (i) formulation of a DOC capacity development plan, (ii) development of training \nmodules, and (iii) establishment of the pool of experts scheme. \n \n                                                \n40 Nepal\u2019s  legislative  framework  complies  with  96  of  the 121  RKC  General  Annex  standards.  The  remaining \n25 standards require amendments in 22 articles of the Customs Act, 2007; two Customs rules; and one administrative \ninstruction. A summary of the 25 amendments, in Nepali, is in Government of Nepal, Ministry of Finance, DOC. \nhttp://customs.gov.np/en/%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E\n0%A5%80.html \n41 Customs declaration processing typically involves (i) data capture and validation, (ii) monitoring of customs \nregulations, (iii) registration, (iv) calculation of duties and taxes, (v) selectivity, (vi) assessment, and (vii) release of \ngoods. Streamlined and consistent application of these steps can be a challenge for customs administrations. \n42 In addition to the three customs offices that started using ASYCUDA World in 2016 (footnote 21), seven more pilot \ntests will be launched from the highest revenue-yielding customs offices. Together they collect over 95% of total \ncustoms-related revenues annually. In 2016, the three offices cleared 6% of the total declarations through this web-\nbased customs management system. All figures are from government data sources. \n ", "8 \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n21.  Nepal has substantial development financing needs and faces an estimated infrastructure \nfinancing gap of 8%\u201212% of GDP annually until 2020.43 Nepal\u2019s fiscal deficit averaged 1.2% in \nFY2003\u2012FY2016 (footnote 7). A budget surplus of 1.4% of GDP was recorded in FY2016, \nreflecting chronically weak budget execution.44 The fiscal deficit for FY2017, however, is projected \nat 8.8% of GDP or NRs229.3 billion.45 More than half of this deficit is expected to be financed \nthrough foreign loans. \n \n22.  The government estimated the total cost of implementing the program during 2017\u20122021 \nto be about $94 million, for which it has provisionally committed about $52 million of its own \nresources (footnote 23). The government is expecting development partner support of $21 million \nfrom this proposed ADB program. Additionally, the World Bank\u2019s trade and transport project \n(para. 14) will provide $16 million, leaving a funding gap of $5 million.46 The government will \nensure that the counterpart funds generated from the program\u2019s loan proceeds will support \nimplementation  during  2017\u20122021,  which  significantly  enhances  the  sustainability  of  the \nprogram\u2019s reform measures. The government has also requested associated stand-alone TA to \nsupport reform implementation under the program.47 The TA is estimated to cost $1 million, which \nwill be financed on a grant basis by a Special Fund administered by ADB. \n \n23.  The government has requested a concessional loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSDR15,341,000  ($21  million)48 from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  the \nprogram. The loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate \nof 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; and such other terms \nand conditions to be set forth in the draft loan agreement. The funds will be released in two \ntranches\u2014$10 million on loan effectiveness and $11 million about 24 months later\u2014once the \ngovernment has complied with the policy conditions. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n24.  The program period will be 4 years starting in July 2017. The DOC will be the executing \nand implementing agency. A program steering committee, chaired by the DOC director general, \nwill guide and monitor implementation. Committee members will be drawn from the DOC, the \nDepartment of Industry, and the finance and commerce ministries. Members of the Customs \nNational Trade Facilitation Committee, which represents trade-related stakeholders from the \npublic and private sector, and ADB may be invited to the steering committee meetings. The \nsteering committee will present the progress of and discuss issues on program implementation at \nregular meetings of the Customs National Trade Facilitation Committee. The DOC will form a \nprogram implementation framework, headed by its deputy director general (management), to \nsupervise five thematic task forces: (i) coordination, (ii) legislation, (iii) automation, (iv) risk \n                                                \n43 L.

The  program  supports  exports  and  economic  growth  through  customs  reform  and \nmodernization, which lower the cost of trade, and is expected to benefit Nepal\u2019s economy through \nvarious channels. A quantitative analysis undertaken shows a positive correlation between trade \nfacilitation and trade. Based on simulation results, Nepal\u2019s exports are expected to increase by \n23.0% and imports by 21.6% from improvement in trade facilitation.49 \n \n26.  Nepal\u2019s economy is expected to benefit from lower trading costs, which can help reduce \nthe price of imported inputs and improve manufacturers\u2019 access to imported inputs\u2014thereby \nimproving productivity in the manufacturing sector and making exports more competitive. The \nprogram is expected to lower entry barriers, enabling manufacturers to enter into new markets \nand products, and diversify their export basket. Other expected benefits include (i) increased \nparticipation of Nepalese firms in regional and global value chains, (ii) higher foreign direct \ninvestment inflows into Nepal as a result of the improved business climate, (iii) inclusive growth \nthrough poverty reduction and benefits to small and medium-sized enterprises, (iv) improvement \nin Nepal\u2019s customs revenue, and (v) a reduction in trade-related corruption (footnote 7). \n \nB.  Governance \n \n27.  ADB has carried out a financial management assessment.50 The overall fiduciary risk for \nthe program is moderate, because of (i) the lack of an internal audit service segregated from the \nprocessing of payments, (ii) capacity challenges in procurement and automation, and (iii) the \nperception of customs revenue leakages. These will be mitigated under the program through the \nexpanded application of automation in customs clearance, as well as the requirement under the \npolicy matrix to revise the DOC\u2019s organizational chart and train relevant DOC officials in priority \nareas, including accounting, automation, procurement, and staff integrity. \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n29.  The reforms supported under the program will indirectly contribute to poverty reduction.51 \nBeneficiaries from the program include current and future businesses, especially small and \nmedium-sized enterprises, informal traders, and women traders. More exports and the ensuing \ngrowth of manufacturers, as well as more investment, are also expected to provide benefits \nthrough job creation, higher wages, and poverty reduction. The program is thus expected to \ncontribute to inclusive and sustainable growth in the long term. \n \n                                                \n49 Economic Analysis; and Estimated Gains in Trade from Improvement in Trade Facilitation (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n50 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n51 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nD.  Safeguards \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s evaluation of the environmental and social impacts of each policy action shows that \nthe program does not trigger ADB\u2019s safeguard policies. The program is classified category C for \nthe environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n31.  The overall risk rating for program implementation is moderate. Major risks and mitigating \nmeasures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.52 Key risks \nfor the implementation of the program are related to the unstable political environment of Nepal, \nto be mitigated by  ADB\u2019s continuous dialogue with the government, underpinned by close \ndevelopment partner coordination. Shortage of technical capacity in the DOC is also a risk, which \nthe  associated  stand-alone  TA\u2019s  capacity  development  activities  will  help  mitigate. \nImplementation of the government\u2019s Public Financial Management Reform Strategy will help \naddress some of the country-wide fiduciary risks in the medium term. The integrated benefits and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n32.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement, as described in detail in the loan \nagreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n33.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan in various currencies equivalent to SDR15,341,000 ($21,000,000)53 to Nepal for the South \nAsia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  Customs  Reform  and  Modernization  for  Trade \nFacilitation Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in concessional terms, with an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter; for a \nterm of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the \nBoard. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n1 June 2017 \n                                                \n52 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n53 SDR1 = $1.36892 as of 9 May 2017. \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Program is aligned with: \nNepal\u2019s exports expanded and export competitiveness increased (14th periodic plan, FY2017\u2013FY2020; \nNepal Trade Integration Strategy, 2016)a \n  Performance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2021     \nLegitimate trade\u2019s  a.
