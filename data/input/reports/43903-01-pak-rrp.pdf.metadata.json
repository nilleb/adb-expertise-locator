In  addition  to  providing  additional  power \ngeneration  capacity  and  reliable  and  affordable  electricity,  the \nproject  will  stimulate  the  economy  by  purchasing  local  goods  and \nservices  and  creating  jobs  for  qualified  locals  in  the  project  area \nand in the country. \n \nThe  sponsor  is  International  Power  from  the  United  Kingdom. \nInternational  Power  is  a  leading  independent  power  generation \ncompany with interests in 32,358 MW (gross) of power generating \ncapacity, across five core regions\u2014North America, Europe, Middle \nEast,  Australia,  and  Asia.  The  sponsor  is  experienced  in  all \nphases  of  the  power  generation  chain,  including  development, \nconstruction,  operation,  trading,  and  marketing.  International \nPower  is  the  single  largest  private  investor  in  Pakistan\u2019s  power \ngeneration  industry,  with  a  net  ownership  of  1,200  MW  (three \nprojects) under operation.  \n \nADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  up  to  $100  million  from  the  ordinary \ncapital resources and a partial risk guarantee (PRG) to cover up to \n$50 million in loans from commercial lenders to Uch-II Power.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nJustification / ADB \nValue-Added \n\nThe  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction  works  will  be \nperformed by a consortium of experienced contractors.  Operation \nand maintenance will be managed by Uch Power (Private) Limited \n(Uch  Power),  with  support  from  International  Power,  and  key \nmaintenance  work  will  be  outsourced  by  the  long-term  service \nagreement.  After  completion,  the  project  will  be  operated  under  a \npower  purchase  agreement  with  National  Transmission  & \nDespatch Company (NTDC) and a gas supply agreement with Oil \nand  Gas  Development  Company  (OGDC).  The  Government  of \nPakistan will assume various key obligations to support the project \nunder the implementation agreement. \n \nThe  project  merits  ADB  support  because  (i)  the  project  will  add \nsignificant  power  generation  capacity  and  help  reduce  load \nshedding in Pakistan; (ii) the project will promote efficient use of an \nunused economical indigenous energy resource; (iii) the project will \nremote  and \nsupport  socioeconomic  advancement \neconomically  deprived  area  of  Balochistan;  (iv)  ADB\u2019s  active \nparticipation  and  presence  in  the  project  will  provide  a  degree  of \ncomfort to the sponsor and other lenders given ADB\u2019s strong track \nrecord  and  ongoing  public  and  private  sector  operations  in \nPakistan\u2019s power industry; (v) the proposed PRG (coupled with the \npresence  of \nfrom \ncommercial lenders; and (vi) the proposed assistance to the project \nis  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  development  plan  and  ADB\u2019s \noperational  strategies \nthe  country \npartnership strategy for Pakistan, and the Energy Policy. \n\nloan)  will  catalyze  cofinancing \n\nincluding  Strategy  2020, \n\nthe  ADB \n\nin  a \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nand partial risk guarantee to Uch-II Power (Private) Limited (Uch-II Power) for the Uch-II Power \nProject.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in  Appendix  1  and  the  summary  poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 2. \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n\nA. \n\nProject Identification and Selection \n\n2. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been working closely with the Pakistan Power \nand Infrastructure Board (PPIB) to identify independent power producers (IPPs) that would best \nmatch  ADB's  goal  of  supporting  the  development  of  both  the  power  industry  and  the  private \nsector in Pakistan. This close collaboration between ADB and the PPIB led to the identification \nof the proposed project. The project was one of the three power projects that the PPIB bid out in \nMarch 2007. The projects were bid out through international competitive bidding to ensure tariff \ncompetitiveness  and  transparency.  A  consortium  of  International  Power  from  the  United \nKingdom  and  Creative  Energy  Resources  from  the  United  Arab  Emirates,  which  are  also  the \nmain shareholders of Uch Power (Private) Limited (Uch Power), the company that is operating \nthe Uch Power (Uch-I) Project, submitted a proposal for development of a 404 megawatt (MW) \ncombined-cycle  power  plant  to  be  located  at  the  Uch-I  project  site.  Like the  Uch-I  project,  the \nUch-II plant will use low British thermal unit (BTU) gas from the Uch gas reservoir as the primary \nfuel.  After  a  detailed  evaluation, the  PPIB gave approval  in August  2008 for the  consortium to \ndevelop the project further. \n \nB. \n\nSector Performance \n\n1. \n\nDemand and Supply Gap of Electricity \n\n3. \nAddition  of  power  generation  capacity  in  Pakistan  is  a  matter  of  utmost  urgency. \nPakistan\u2019s power industry faces a major supply deficit that is constraining the country\u2019s already \nfragile economic growth. As compared with 18,926 MW peak demand in mid-2010, the country \nhad  only  14,723  MW  firm  supplies,  resulting  in  a  shortfall  of  4,203  MW  (or  22.2%  of  the \ncountry's  peak  electricity  demand).1 As  of  June  2010,  the  country\u2019s  installed  power  generation \ncapacity was 20,375 MW, of which approximately 55% was owned and operated by government \nentities and 45% by independent power producers and/or majority private operators. Appendix 3 \nprovides more details on Pakistan\u2019s power sector. \n \n4. \nAlthough  electricity  sales  and  demand  have  risen  by  more  than  40%  during  the  last  5 \nyears, investment in new generation capacity has lagged behind. The resultant power shortage \nhas  led  to  ever  increasing  incidents  of  brownouts  and  blackouts  in  all  major  urban  centers. \nMeasures  to  ration  consumption  are  already  being  taken.  Even  with  the  economic  slowdown \nand  dislocations  caused  by  the  flooding  in  2010,  power  demand  is  expected  to  continue  to \nincrease,  and  latent  demand  is  considered  substantial.  Left  unattended,  the  country\u2019s  power \ndeficit will continue to worsen and adversely impact Pakistan\u2019s economy.  \n \n\n                                                \n1  Private Power and Infrastructure Board. http://www.ppib.gov.pk/SupplyDemand.html \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nPrimary Energy and Fuel Mix \n\n5. \nPakistan urgently needs to develop indigenous energy resources. The power industry in \nPakistan is a mix of thermal, hydro, and nuclear power plants. Thermal power plants, which use \nimported fuel oil to meet almost 52% of their fuel needs (the balance is based on gas), account \nfor 67.6% of installed capacity; hydro plants account for 30.3%, and nuclear plants provide the \nremaining 2%. Coal-fired thermal plants account for only 0.1%. Originally, the ratio of hydro to \nthermal  installed  generation  capacity  in  the  country  was  about  2:1  (in  1985).  Over  time,  more \nthermal generation capacity was installed, leaving the country heavily dependent on imported oil \nfor  its  primary fuel  requirements.  Rising  oil  imports  have caused  the  country\u2019s  current  account \ndeficit  to  increase.  They  have  also  caused  considerable  price  escalation  and  volatility.  High \nelectricity tariffs are eroding the viability and affordability of the sector. \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Position \n\n6. \nThe  \u2015circular  debt  problem\u2016  impedes  the  progress  of  power  generation  expansion  and \nsours  the  mood  of  existing  and  potential  investors  in  Pakistan's  power  industry.  Circular  debt \nstarts with accumulation of payables by the Government of Pakistan to distribution companies, \nwhich  are  passed  on  to  the  generators  and  then  to  fuel  suppliers.  This  circular  debt  causes \ndelays in fuel supply to power generators, affecting generation capacity. Distribution companies \nare  not  able  to  charge  the  full  cost-recovery  tariff  determined  by  National  Electric  Power \nRegulatory Authority (NEPRA). The government has insulated low-income power consumers by \nproviding  subsidies  to  distribution  companies,  but  there  have  been  delays  in  government \npayments.  This  has  resulted  in  revenue  shortfalls  for  distribution  companies  and  temporary \ndeferment  of payments to nearly  all  power  plants  in the system.  Power  generation companies \nhave seen their receivables rise, and generation companies have been forced to stop, delay, or \nreduce  payments  to  their  fuel  suppliers  to  balance  their  cash  flows.  This  has  negatively \nimpacted generation capacity. This issue is not new and has been partially mitigated in the past. \nHowever, it is once again becoming a growing problem that must be resolved if the potential of \nthe  private  sector  to  address  Pakistan\u2019s  power  deficit  is  to  be  unleashed.  Measures  are \nunderway, but challenges remain. \n \n\n4. \n\nResponse by the Government of Pakistan \n\n7. \nTo address the energy shortage and growing power crisis, the government has decided \nto implement several energy expansion initiatives, with an emphasis on developing indigenous \nresources. These initiatives include expanding thermal and hydropower generation capacity by \nindependent  power  producers  (IPPs)  under  the  government\u2019s  Power  Policy  2002,  procuring \npower  from  rental  power  plants  under  short-term  agreements,  securing  electricity  and  gas \nimports from regional projects, and tapping into the huge potential of renewable energy sources. \nThe government is also exploring the possibility of using its domestic coal reserves, which are \namong  the  largest  in  the  world  (albeit  low  quality  and  remotely  located).  However,  the  time \nhorizon for domestic coal-fired power generation is relatively long term. In the short to medium \nterm, it is expected that both conventional (i.e., thermal) and renewable energy\u2014predominantly \nhydro  and  wind\u2014will  be  the  mainstays  of  Pakistan\u2019s  electricity  supply.  Simultaneously, \nimproving  transmission  and  distribution  efficiency  is  a  key  area  of  focus,  and  ADB  has  been \nassisting the government\u2019s program through its public sector operations.2 \n                                                \n2  ADB.  2006.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche \nFinancing  Facility  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  Power  Distribution  Enhancement  Investment.  Manila; \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n \n\n \n8. \nThe  government  has  started  efforts  to  resolve  the  circular  debt  problem  by  increasing \nconsumer  tariffs  and  by  transferring  the  debt  in  the  system  to  a  newly  established  company \noutside of the energy sector. ADB continues to support the government\u2019s sector reform program \nunder the Accelerating Economic Transformation Program.3 \n \n9. \nThe  reform  and  restructuring  of  the  sector  has  been  supported  by  major  development \npartners  such  as  ADB  and  the  World  Bank,  but  progress  has  been  slow  and  protracted  and \nmany  areas  have  lagged  behind  expectations. 4 The  appointment  of  independent  boards  of \ndirectors,  critical  for  autonomy  and  commercial  discipline,  needs  to  be  pushed  and  political \ninterference  needs  to  be  reduced.  Another  important  measure  required  to  move  toward  full \ncommercialization  of  the  power  industry  is  to  make  the  Central  Power  Purchasing  Authority \neffective  as  an  autonomous  body  to  ensure  financial  transparency  and  accountability. \nInsufficient reform of end-consumer tariffs, delinquent customer accounts, and other institutional \nfactors are major hurdles to reforming and improving the poor financial health of the sector. \n \n\n5. \n\nPrivate Sector Investment in Pakistan \n\n10. \nPakistan has undertaken wide ranging reforms in the energy sector with the help of ADB \nand  the  World  Bank.  In  the  early  1990s,  the  government,  recognizing  that  the  required \ninvestment  in  the  sector  could  not  be  provided  by  the  public  sector  alone,  restructured  and \nopened  Pakistan\u2019s  energy  sector  to  private  investment.  Since  then,  Pakistan  has  had  a  long \nhistory  of  private  sector  involvement  in  the  energy  sector,  and  about  a  third  of  generation  is \nprovided by IPPs. During the past 2 years, nine IPPs representing almost 2,000 MW of installed \ncapacity  have achieved  financial  close  under the  Power  Policy  2002.  Most  have already  been \ncommissioned, and all are expected to start commercial operation by end-2010 or early 2011. \n \n11. \nADB has taken the lead in supporting the government\u2019s initiative to attract private capital \ninto  the  energy  sector  and  has  been  instrumental  in  many  pioneering  transactions.  ADB \nfinanced the first private hydropower project, the New Bong Escape Hydropower Project.5 This \ntransaction  has  set  the  precedent  for  many  follow-on  private  hydropower  projects  in  Pakistan, \nseveral  of  which  ADB  is  considering.  ADB  has  also  provided  equity  and  a  partial  credit \nguarantee  for  a  gas-fired  combined  cycle  power  project,  the  Daharki  Power  Project,  using \nindigenous  gas.6 To  further  encourage  investment  in  the  energy  sector,  the  government  has \ntaken steps to privatize state-owned power companies\u2014both generation plants and distribution \nnetworks. ADB  helped  the  government  privatize  the  Karachi  Electric  Supply  Company,  and,  in \n2007, ADB provided a loan for the privatized entity to expand its generation, transmission, and \n\n                                                                                                                                                       \nADB.  2009.

The  proposed  assistance  will  promote  a \nlarger role for the private sector in financing infrastructure, and will catalyze private investment \nthrough ADB\u2019s credit enhancement product. \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with the Country Strategy \n\n13. \nADB\u2019s support for the project is in line with the country partnership strategy for Pakistan, \n2009\u20132013,  which  emphasizes  the  importance  of  energy  sector  development,  private  sector \nparticipation in infrastructure development, and expansion of ADB's private sector operations in \nthe  energy  sector.10 The  project  is  a  logical  continuation  of  ADB\u2019s  development  and  reform \nefforts  in  Pakistan's  energy  sector,  which  have  been  designed  to  promote  a  well-regulated, \nmarket-oriented power industry. Energy infrastructure has featured prominently in ADB's private \nsector operations in Pakistan. \n \n\n3. \n\nConsistency with the Energy Sector Strategy \n\n14. \nThe project is in line with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, and is particularly consistent with one of \nthe  three  pillars  of  that  policy\u2014maximizing  access  to  energy  for  all.11 Access  to  modern  and \nreliable  energy  services  fosters  sustainable  human  development,  economic  growth,  a  higher \nquality of life, and improved delivery of social services. The project will add generation capacity \nand  increase  the  reliability  of  electricity  supplies  in  a  country  facing  a  severe  power  shortage. \nThe project will promote the use of a low-cost indigenous fuel to generate electricity. Electricity \nsupplied by the project will be more affordable than existing supplies, and will not be affected by \nthe volatility of the international fuel market. The project will operate at high efficiency and  will \nbe more environmentally friendly than power plants that use other fossil fuels. By promoting the \nuse of indigenous resources, the project will also contribute to the country\u2019s energy security. \n \n \n\n                                                \n7  ADB.  2007.

Along with shares in power generators, the company also has \ninterests  in  desalination,  steam  generation,  and  energy  retail.  Through  its  corporate  history, \nInternational  Power  has  gained  experience  in  all  phases  of  the  power  generation  chain, \nincluding  development,  construction,  operation,  trading  and,  marketing.  Its  focus  is  on \ngenerating  low-cost,  affordable  power  in  countries  that  encourage  foreign  investment  and \nhave high demand growth. \n \n17. \nInternational  Power  has  been  increasing  its  presence  as  a  power  plant  developer  in \nPakistan  since  the  1990s,  when  it  began  investing  in  overseas  power  privatization  programs. \nOver  time,  International  Power  has  become  the  single  largest  private  investor  in  Pakistan\u2019s \npower generation industry. In 1993, National Power, a legacy company of International Power, \ninvested  in  the  Hub  Power  Company,  which  became  the  first  IPP  in  Pakistan. 12  In  1996, \nInternational Power purchased shares in Kot Addu Power Company, and in 1994 took a portion \nof  shares  in  Uch  Power.13 International  Power's  three  Pakistan  projects  have  demonstrated \nsound financial performance underpinned by long-term power purchase agreements.  \n \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n18. \nThe  Uch-II  project  is  in  the  Dera  Murad  Jamali  subdistrict  of  Balochistan  Province, \napproximately  600  kilometers  (km)  north  of  Karachi  and  42  km  northwest  of  Jacobabad.  It  is \nlocated  on  the  premises  of  the  Uch-I  power  station,  which  is  surrounded  by  a  boundary  wall \ncovering an area of approximately 260 hectares (ha). The project will require approximately 63 \nha including an area for residential and recreational facilities associated with the project. \n \n19. \nThe  project  will  consist  of  two  gas  turbine  generators,  two  heat  recovery  steam \ngenerators,  one  steam  turbine  generator,  one  condenser  and  multicell  cooling  tower,  and \nbalance-of-plant equipment. The project will use low-BTU gas and a high-speed diesel dual fuel \ncombustion  system.  Low-BTU  gas  is  the  primary  fuel,  but  distillate  liquid  fuel  will  be  used  for \nstart up and shut down because these activities are not feasible with low-BTU gas. \n \n20. \nElectricity generated from the Uch-II project will be stepped up to 220 kV for connection \nto  the  220  kV  switchyard.  This  switchyard  will  supply  power  directly  to  the  National \nTransmission & Despatch Company (NTDC) at its outlet gantries. The NTDC will be responsible \nfor interconnection of the project to the national grid. \n \n\n                                                \n12  International Power\u2019s current share in Hub Power Company is 17%. \n13 International Power\u2019s current share in Kot Addu Power Company is 36%, and share in Uch Power is 75%. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nProject Outputs and Outcome \n\n21. \nThe outcome of the project will be additional electricity supplies of 2,799 gigawatt hours \n(GWh) annually at an attractive tariff. The project will generate electricity by using competitively \npriced indigenous gas, and the tariff for electricity supplied by the project will be lower than that \nfor plants that use imported fuel. \n \n22. \nThe  primary  output  of the  project  will  be  net  additional  installed  capacity  of  375.2  MW, \nwhich  is  equivalent  to  8.9%  of  the  energy  shortfall  in  the  country.  In  addition,  during \nconstruction, it is expected that locally purchased goods and services will amount to $50 million, \nand 600\u2013800 local jobs will be created. \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact \n\n1. \n\nContribution  to  Economic  Growth  and  Poverty  Reduction  through  Private \nSector Development \n\n23. \nThe  project  will  help  alleviate  Pakistan's  severe  power  shortage,  which  is  adversely \nimpacting  the  country\u2019s  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  efforts.  The  project  will \nincrementally  increase  access  to  energy  for  households,  business,  and  industry.  Use  of \nindigenous  natural  resources  will  result  in  more  affordable  electricity  and  tariffs  that  are  less \nsusceptible  to  fluctuations  in  the  international  fuel  and  the  foreign  currency  markets.  Use  of \nindigenous fuel will also relieve pressure on the country\u2019s balance of payments. The project will \nfurther  demonstrate  the  advantageousness  of  private  participation  in  power  generation,  and \nmay increase general investor and lender confidence in Pakistan. In the long run, the project will \ncontribute to reduction of power shortages and development of indigenous power sources. \n \nC. \n\nEnvironment and Social Dimensions \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment \n\n24. \nThe project is classified as environmental category A, requiring an environmental impact \nassessment (EIA) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The  project\u2019s \nenvironmental  and  social  impacts  were  adequately  assessed  in  the  EIA report  (January  2010) \nand  EIA  report  addendum  (October  2010).  The  EIA  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with \nPakistan regulations and procedures, and the addendum with revised information was prepared \nin response to ADB comments. The EIA report was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 7 July 2010 \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), while the addendum will also be \nposted on the website. \n \nPotential  adverse  project  impacts  include  a  decline  in  air  quality,  an  increase  in \n25. \ngreenhouse gas emissions, increased use of water, and an increase in liquid waste generation. \nThese  adverse  impacts  will  be  adequately  mitigated  where  feasible,  as  described  in  the  EIA \nreport  and  addendum.  Uch-II  Power  is  deemed  to  have  sufficient  capacity  to  manage \nenvironmental  and  social  issues.  The  project  is  sited  on  land  acquired  by  Uch  Power,  located \nwithin the Uch-I fenced compound on mostly vacant land. The locality is arid and fairly remote, \nwith no ecologically sensitive sites. \n \nThe  maximum  rates  of  plant  emissions  will  be  within  Pakistan  National  Environmental \n26. \nQuality  Standards  (NEQS)  limits  and  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC)  guidelines  for \n\u2015fuels other than natural gas\u2016 (applied because low-BTU gas is of different quality than \u2015natural \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n \n\nincrease \n\nlimit:  500 \n\nincremental \n\nt/day).  The  projected \n\ngas\u2016)  for  all  major  pollutants,  including  5  milligrams  per  normal  cubic  meter  (mg/Nm\u00b3)  of \nparticulate matter of 10 micrometers size or less (PM10) (against the IFC limit of 50 mg/Nm\u00b3), 77 \nmg/Nm3  of  oxides  of  nitrogen  (IFC  limit:  152  mg/Nm3)  and  0.18  tons  per  day  (t/day)  of  sulfur \ndioxide  (NEQS \nin  ground-level \nconcentrations of oxides of sulfur  and oxides of nitrogen occurring as a result of the project  is \nlow  at  0.2  micrograms  per  cubic  meter  (\uf06dg/m3)  and  5.9  \uf06dg/m3,  respectively.  Both  are  within \nNEQS limits. The increase in the PM10 24-hour ground-level concentration will be just 0.4 \uf06dg/m3. \nThe  cumulative  worst-case  PM10  24-hour  ground-level  concentration  of  100.0  \uf06dg/m3  is  lower \nthan  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  interim  target-1  (150  \uf06dg/m3),  but  higher  than  the \nWHO guideline (50 \uf06dg/m3) because of naturally high ambient levels of particulate matter (WHO \nguidelines  are  applicable  under  IFC  guidelines  when  there  is  no  national  standard).  Offsetting \nthis projected increase in ambient PM10 levels is not feasible as there are no identifiable sources \nof particulate matter other than natural causes and the Uch-I power plant. \n \n27. \nThe  project  is  expected  to  produce  2.125  million  t  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  per  year,  a \nreduction of about 64,000 t of CO2 annually over conventional boilers burning oil (the main type \nof  generation  currently  supplying  the  grid),  or  a  reduction  of  about  494,000 t  of  CO2 annually \nover  coal-fired  thermal  generation.  CO2  emissions  will  be  quantified  and  reported  annually. \nOffsetting CO2 emissions occurring as a result of the project will not be possible with local tree \nplanting because of the arid conditions surrounding the plant site and the large volume of water \nrequired if irrigation were to be undertaken. \n \n28.  Water  use  for  the  project  will  total  10,300  m3/day  during  operation.  Water  use  will  be \nminimized  by  vertical  draft  cooling  towers  with  continuous  cooling  water  reticulation;  close \nmonitoring of cooling water chemistry to optimize use; and water conservation in the colony. All \nproject  water  requirements  will  be  reallocated  from  the  Uch-I  plant's  water  allocation,  which  is \nonly  partially  used,  thus  causing  minimal  impact  on  existing  users.  A  \u2015zero  discharge\u2016 \nwastewater  treatment  system  will  be  installed  to  treat  1,238  m3  of  effluent  per  day.  All  treated \neffluent will be discharged into an on-site evaporation pond for tertiary treatment. Water quality \nin  this  pond  will  in  general  comply  with  NEQS  and  IFC  guidelines.  Total  dissolved  solids  and \nchlorine (residual) will be above NEQS limits, and total suspended solids and chlorine (residual) \nmay breach IFC limits, but this is acceptable given that there will be no discharge from the pond \nto any other surface water. Minimal infiltration will occur from the pond because of the very low \npermeability of the silty clay subsoil. \n \n\n2. \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n29. \nThe  project  is  classified category  C for  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  people \nsafeguards. The project will be constructed on 83.5 ha (206 acres) within the fenced property of \nUch Power, which has a total land area 260 ha (642 acres) in Dera Murad Jamali, Balochistan. \nThe land for the project will be leased to Uch-II Power by Uch Power. Uch Power acquired its \nland  in  1996;  it  was  previously  owned  by  the  government  and  private  landowners. \nCompensation  has  been  fully  paid  to  the  original  owners  at  above-fair-market  value  plus  the \nmandated 25% additional cost of acquisition following the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act \nof  1894.  The  land  where  the  Uch-II  plant  will  be  constructed  has  no  occupants  or  signs  of \noccupancy, and no outstanding issues with land acquisition. The tribal communities outside the \nproject  area  are  inhabited  by  the  Bhangar,  Bangul-zai,  Bahrani,  Jamali,  Jakhrani,  and  Khosa \ntribes,  among  others.  Although  the  residents  of  the  villages  near  the  project  area  may  have \ntribal  affiliations,  the  project  will  not  in  any  way  affect  their  dignity,  human  rights,  livelihood \nsystems, or culture. This is demonstrated by the operation of the similar Uch-I plant in the area \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nfor  10  years.  Moreover,  the  land  where  the  project  will  be  constructed  is  not  owned,  used, \noccupied, or claimed as ancestral domain or asset by any of these groups. \n \n\n3. \n\nConsultation and Participation Process \n\n30. \nConsultations  with  local  communities  reached  a  wide  segment  of  the  population  in  the \nproject area and took the form of formal and informal meetings, focus group discussions, and in-\ndepth  interviews.  Information  related  to  the  project  was  discussed  and  various  stakeholders \nwere  encouraged  to  voice  their  concerns  and  opinions.  Feedback  obtained  from  the \nstakeholders was documented, and all issues and suggestions raised were recorded. Three key \nissues  were  raised  during  the  detailed  consultations  in  11  villages:  (i)  giving  priority  to  local \nvillagers  for  project-related  employment  and  activities,  (ii)  ensuring  that  community  water \nresources are not overexploited, and (iii) ensuring that traffic is managed so as not to jeopardize \nthe  safety  of  the  communities.  Mitigating  measures  were  incorporated  in the  project  design  to \naddress these issues. \n \n \nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nConstruction Arrangements \n\n31. \nDuring construction, the project technical team will be headed by a project manager who \nwill coordinate with the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor, and with \nthe owner\u2019s engineer. The project manager will be experienced in power plant management and \nwill be responsible for meeting the plant\u2019s pre-operations requirements. \n \n32. \ncontractor consortium.  \n \n\nThe  project  will  be  constructed  under  an  EPC  contract  performed  by  an  experienced \n\n2. \n\nOperations Arrangements \n\n33. \nOperation and maintenance (O&M) of the project will be carried out by Uch Power under \nan O&M agreement. A dedicated O&M team may also be added. All maintenance work will be \ncarried out as per the recommendations of the original equipment manufacturer. \n \n34. \nAs the sponsor of the project, International Power will also play an important role in the \nproject\u2019s  O&M.  Uch-II  Power  will  implement  International  Power's  policies,  procedures,  and \nstandards\u2014particularly  in the  areas  of  environment,  health,  and safety  management\u2014and will \nbe subject to periodic audits to monitor compliance in these areas. The project will also leverage \nInternational Power\u2019s global resources and network (i.e., technical support) and benefit from its \nindustry experience and best practices. \n \n\n3. \n\nGas Supply \n\nThe project\u2019s fuel will be low-BTU gas from the Uch gas field, which is 47 km away from \n35. \nthe project site. Gas will be supplied by Oil & Gas Development Company (OGDC) under a 25-\nyear take-or-pay gas supply agreement (GSA).  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n \n\n4. \n\nPower Offtake \n\n36. \nThe NTDC is the power offtaker and will purchase electricity from the project under a 25-\nyear  take-or-pay  power  purchase  agreement  (PPA).  The  tariff  payable  by  the  NTDC  will  be \nconsistent with the tariff determined by the NEPRA. The project will supply base load electricity.  \n \n\n5. \n\nRole of the Government of Pakistan \n\nThe government plays a crucial role for the project as well as for other IPPs in Pakistan. \n37. \nIts  obligations  are  set  out  under  an  implementation  agreement  with  Uch-II  Power.  Under  the \nimplementation  agreement,  the  government  grants  the  company  the  exclusive  right  to  develop, \nown,  and  operate  the  project  using  gas  from  the  Uch  gas  reserve,  subject  to  applicable  laws, \nregulations, and certain other obligations, for a period of 25 years. Among the principal functions of \nthe implementation agreement is to provide assurances to the company, International Power, and \nlenders that the various government entities and agencies will meet their contractual obligations\u2014\nincluding paying dues on time.  \n \n\n6. \n\nProcurement  \n\nThe EPC contractor was selected through international competitive bidding. \n\n38. \n \n\n7. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n39. \nUch-II  Power  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date) \nand  the  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  Policy  (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire  the  company  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls \nfollowing international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. The investment documentation between ADB and Uch-II Power will \nfurther allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring, Reporting, and Evaluation \n\n40. \nUch-II  Power  will  be  required  to  submit  quarterly  unaudited  financial  statements, \nquarterly construction or operations reports, and annual operating budgets to ADB and the other \nlenders,  and  must  report  any  material  changes.  The  company  will  be  required  to  hire  an \ninternationally reputable accounting firm (or its local affiliate) to audit its annual accounts in line \nwith  international  financial  reporting  standards.  ADB  will  monitor  the  project\u2019s  construction \nprogress and operation performance, using information from  public sources, lender\u2019s advisors, \nand government statistics. The project will be evaluated on two levels: (i) success of the project, \nincluding  its  completion,  commissioning,  and  operation;  and  (ii)  impacts  beyond  the  project, \nincluding  the  country\u2019s  economic  growth  and  the  increase  of  private  sector  participation  in \nPakistan\u2019s energy sector. The performance indicators are included in the design and monitoring \nframework (Appendix 1). \n \n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\n1. \n\nADB Loan \n\n41. \nThe  proposed  loan  of  up  to  $100  million  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources without government guarantee. The loan amount will not exceed 25% of the final total \nproject  cost  approved  by  the  NEPRA  upon  completion.  Proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  used  for \neligible capital expenditures and civil works for the project. \n \n\n2. \n\nADB Partial Risk Guarantee \n\n42. \nThe  proposed  partial  risk  guarantee  (PRG)  will  be  extended  without  government \ncounterindemnity in favor of commercial lenders that will provide direct loans of up to $50 million \nto Uch-II Power (ADB-guaranteed loan). Proceeds of the ADB-guaranteed loan will be used for \nthe project\u2019s costs and expenditures. \n \nB. \n\nJustification for ADB Assistance \n\nThe proposed assistance by ADB to the project is justified for the following reasons: \n\n43. \n \n\nthe project will add significant power generation capacity, which will help reduce \nload  shedding  in  Pakistan  and  strengthen  the  supply  network  and  stabilize \nvoltage in the province of Balochistan; \n \nthe  project  will  use  an  unused  and  economically  attractive  indigenous  energy \nresource  to  supply  affordable  electricity  and  reduce  reliance  on  expensive  oil \nimports. This will significantly reduce the volatility of the project\u2019s electricity tariff \nand  relieve  stress  on  Pakistan\u2019s  foreign  exchange  reserves.  Furthermore,  it  will \ncontribute to Pakistan\u2019s energy security. \n\nthe  project  will  create  revenue  opportunities  for  the  gas  industry,  and  will  also \ncreate job opportunities for local people during construction and operation of the \nproject  and  will  support  socioeconomic  advancement \nin  a  remote  and \neconomically deprived area of Balochistan. \n\nADB\u2019s active participation and presence in the project will reassure the sponsor, \nInternational  Power,  and  other  lenders  that  the  government  and  government \nentities  will  continue  to  support  the  project.  Given  ADB\u2019s  track  record  and \nongoing  engagement  in  Pakistan\u2019s  energy  sector\u2014including  policy  dialogue, \npublic sector reform programs, and recent financing of key IPPs through private \nsector  operations\u2014project  participants  will  value  ADB\u2019s  role  in  mitigating  risk, \nsolving  problems,  and  catalyzing  financial  resources  to  support  private  sector \npower projects in Pakistan. \n\nADB's  assistance  is  considered  indispensable  to  achieve  financial  close.  The \nlong-term  financing  that  ADB  will  provide  is  essential  to  ensure  successful \nimplementation of the project, and would not otherwise be easily available under \nthe present financial and country environment. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\n \nC. \n\nAssurances \n\nConsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  mandate  to  mobilize  financing  from  other  sources,  the \nproposed  PRG  (coupled  with  the  presence  of  the  ADB  loan)  will  catalyze \nfinancing from commercial lenders. \n\nThe  proposed  assistance  to  the  project  is  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s \ndevelopment plan and ADB\u2019s operational strategies as discussed in this report. \n\n44. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment  of  Pakistan  will  be  requested  to  confirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed \nassistance to Uch-II Power (Private) Limited.

Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nADB\u2019s support for the project is in line with the Pakistan country partnership strategy (CPS)a and the government\u2019s strategic \nemphasis on energy sector development. As per the ADB CPS, \u2015ADB views itself as one of Pakistan\u2019s strategic development \npartners for infrastructure development,\u2016 with power as one of the main areas of support, and \u2015the emphasis on lending for \neconomic infrastructure will be continued, which is consistent with the high priority attached to it in the government\u2019s Medium \nTerm Development Framework.\u2016 The proposed project also conforms to the cross-cutting theme of sustainable environmental \nmanagement,  as  reflected  in  the  CPS.  Lastly,  the  CPS  mandates  that  ADB  develop  greater  complementarity  between  its \npublic  and  private  sector  operations.  It  places  specific  emphasis  on  the  role  of  the  private  sector  as  a  driver  of  investment \ngrowth and employment. The project will tap gas from a nearby gas reservoir to generate power that will be made available to \nalleviate the country's power supply deficiency. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis \n \nKey issues. During construction, the project will employ construction workers from nearby communities, thereby augmenting \nthe  incomes  of  local  households.  This  will  in  turn  lead  to  the  creation  of  small  enterprises  to  service  the  construction \nworkforce. During operation, the presence of power plant personnel and contractors will increase local demand for food and \nservices,  thus  benefiting  local  business.  The  project  is  expected  to  implement  local  development  programs  through  the \ncorporate  social  responsibility  (CSR)  initiatives.  The  CSR  initiatives  are  mainly  focused  on  (i)  socioeconomic  development \nprojects  mainly  in  Balochistan  Province's  Naseerabad  District  and  surrounding  areas;  and  (ii)  other  noteworthy  causes  in \nBalochistan and in  the rest of the country (e.g., provision of food assistance to thousands  of affected individuals during the \n2010 Indus river flooding). \n \nDesign  features.  The  project  has  no  specific  technical  design  feature  that  is  relevant  to  poverty  reduction  except  for  the \nexpected implementation of the CSR initiatives, which are discussed in more detail in the social analysis and strategy section \nbelow.  \n \n\nTargeting Classification: General Intervention  \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \n \nKey  issues.  An  environmental  and  social  impact  assessment,  social  compliance  audit  on  prior  land  acquisition,  and  due \ndiligence  on  other  social  dimensions  were  undertaken  for  the  project.  These  reports  concluded  that  the  construction  and \noperation of the project power plant are not expected to have adverse social impacts. Key findings are as follows: \n \nInvoluntary resettlement. The project will be constructed on 83.5 hectares (ha; 206 acres) within the fenced property of Uch \nPower, which has a total land area of 260 ha (642 acres). The land for the project is being leased by Uch Power to the project \ncompany,  Uch-II  Power.  The  total  landholding  of  Uch  Power  was  acquired  from  the  government  of  Balochistan  in  1996. \nCompensation  has  been  fully  paid  to  the  original  owners  (portions  of  the  land  were  privately  held  and  portions  were \ngovernment land) at above-fair-market value plus the mandated 25% additional cost of acquisition following the provisions of \nthe  Land  Acquisition  Act  of  1894.  The  land  where  the  project  will  be  constructed  has  no  occupants  or  sign  of  occupancy. \nThere  are  no  outstanding  issues  with  land  acquisition,  and  Uch  Power  confirms  that  it  has  not  received  any  complaints  or \ngrievances emanating from the original owners of the land.  \n \nThe land and surrounding areas are arid and not suitable for agriculture, with low population density.  \n \nIndigenous peoples. There are eight villages near the project area: three on the southern side, one on the western side, two \non  the  northern  side,  and  two  near  the  access  road  leading  to  the  site.  These  villages  are  composed  of  169  households \nwhose main tribal affiliations are as follows: Bhangar, Bangul-zai, Bahrani, Jamali, Jakhrani, and Khosa. Other tribes in these \nvillages are: Bbbor, Brohi, Bugti, Gola, Jat, Kaprani, Lahri, Lango, Lanha, Lashari, Machi, Marri, Pechwa, Raeesani, Solangi, \nand Soomro. \n \n\n \n\n\f     Appendix 2 \n\n14 \n \n\nAlthough  the  residents  of the villages  located near the  project  area may  have  tribal  affiliations,  the  experience of  the  Uch-I \nplant,  which  has  been  operating  in  the  project  area  for  10  years,  indicates  that  the  project  will  not  in  any  way  affect  their \ndignity, human rights, livelihood systems, or culture. Moreover, the land where the  project will be constructed is not owned, \nused, occupied, or claimed as ancestral domain or asset by any of these groups. \n \nLabor and working conditions. Pakistan has ratified all International Labour Organization fundamental conventions covering \nthe  four  core  labor  standards.  These  are  embodied  in  the  Constitution  and  in  the  Industrial  Relations  Ordinance  (IRO)  of \n2002.  Uch  Power  has  demonstrated  its  commitment  to  following  the  2002  IRO,  and  has  a  human  resources  policy  and \nmanuals that cover employee benefits, equal opportunity, nondiscrimination, grievance mechanism, and others. Uch-II Power \nwill implement the same policies. \n \nCorporate  social  responsibility  (CSR).  Uch  Power  engages  the  neighboring  communities  and  villages  and  the  wider \ncommunity where it does business through CSR initiatives. It has robust CSR programs  that are geared toward community \nwelfare and support activities and other socioeconomic development projects, mainly in Balochistan Province's Naseerabad \nDistrict. The CSR programs also focus on other noteworthy causes in Balochistan and in the rest of Pakistan. The programs \nare  governed  by  a  committee  comprised  of  representatives  from  the  local  administration  and  provincial  government.  The \ncommittee  reviews  the  development  requirements  of  the  local  communities  and  selects  programs  that  would  most  benefit \nthese communities. Uch-II Power is expected to apply the same CSR policies and procedures applied by Uch Power. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1.  Community  consultations  were  carried  out  in  the  project  area  through  formal  and  informal  meetings,  focus  group \ndiscussions and in-depth interviews. The company\u2019s socioeconomic team, assisted by environmental specialists, initiated the \nsessions by giving a brief, simple, and nontechnical description of the project, including an overview of all likely positive and \nnegative impacts. This was followed by an open discussion in which all participants were encouraged to voice their concerns \nand  opinions.  Stakeholder  feedback  was  documented,  and  all  issues  and  suggestions  raised  were  recorded.  Through  this \nprocess the consultations reached a wide segment of the population in the project area and actively involved all stakeholders. \nCommunity  consultations  were  carried  out  included  in  the  villages  of  Azizabad,  Faiq  Khan  Jamali,  Haji  Mohammad  Ayub \nMangal, Haji Rehmat, Haji Sohbat Khan, Jan Mohammad Jamali, Langha Khan Jamali, Mir Abdul Ghafoor Lari, Soobho Khan \nJatak,  and  Taj  Mohammad  Khan  Jamali,.  They  are  inhabited  by  the  Jamali,  Jakhrani,  Khoso,  Mengal,  Lari,  Panhwar,  and \nPandrani  tribes.  Consultations  were  conducted  in  the  Balochi  and  Sindhi  languages.  Three  points  were  raised  during  the \nseries of consultations: (i)  local villagers should be given priority  for jobs created by  project-related works and activities, (ii) \ncommunity  water  resources  should  not  be  overexploited,  and  (iii)  increased  traffic  should  not  jeopardize  the  safety  of  the \ncommunities.  Addressing  these  concerns,  project-related  jobs  will  be  provided  to  qualified  local  villagers;  community  water \nresources will not be exploited (the combined usage of the Uch-I plant and the proposed Uch-II plant is likely to be only about \n42% of the water allocation to the Uch site); and traffic management measures to ensure the safety of local communities have \nbeen included in the project\u2019s environment management plan.  \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n Information sharing     \n\n Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No    \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared? \n \nC&P activities were done in the context of environmental and social assessment, discussed thoroughly in the environmental \nimpact assessment (EIA) report, and implemented as appropriate. Most of the consultations took place during the early phase \nof project preparation. A complaints registry will be established and community engagement is expected to continue through \nthe company\u2019s CSR initiatives.  \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n \nKey Issues. Dera Murad Jamali Tehsil has a population of 157,429, of which 82,627 is male and 74,802 is female, according \nto  the  population  and  housing  census  of  1998.  According  to  the  1998  census,  the  male-to-female  ratio  is  1.10:1.  The \nsocioeconomic study for the EIA covered 103 villages with a total population of 21,055 and approximately 3,779 households. \nThe male population of these villages is estimated to be close to 51.05%, while the female population is estimated to be about \n48.94%, for a male-to-female ratio of 1.04:1. Women in the community generally observe purdah from outsiders. The purdah \nrestrictions  are  more  stringent  for  young  girls.  Adult  women  can  appear  before  male  members  of  the  same  tribe.  The \nrestrictions  on  mobility  are  not  very  strict;  they  vary  with  the  marital  status  and  age  of  women  and  from  tribe  to  tribe.  The \nsocial  impact  assessment  looked  at  various  factors  affecting  the  socioeconomic  status  of  women,  e.g.,  health,  education, \nlivelihoods, and drinking water supply. No particular gender-related issue was identified by the social impact assessment for \nthe project. \n \nIn avoiding gender bias in the workplace, the project will follow the same human resources policies being maintained by Uch \nPower,  which  provides  for  specific  entitlements  such  as  maternity  benefits  in  addition  to  the  usual  company  benefits. \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                                     Appendix 2 \n\n15 \n\nAdditional special arrangements are also available to the employees, covering items such as daily pick-up and drop-off from \nwork  station.  During  project  construction,  contractors  will  be  bound  by  contractors'  agreements  and  are  expected  to  follow \nlocal norms when engaging local communities. \n \nKey actions.
