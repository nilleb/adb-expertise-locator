An  environmental  impact  assessment  was  undertaken; \nthe  summary  was  circulated  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nBoard of Directors and placed on the ADB website on 19 May 2008. \n \nThe  Ho  Chi  Minh  City\u2013Long  Thanh\u2013Dau  Giay  Expressway  (HLD \nexpressway)  Project  comprises  construction  of  approximately  51 \nkilometers  of  four-lane,  tolled  expressway.  The  expressway  will \ncommence  at  the  junction  of  the  Second  Ring  Road  in  District  9,  Ho \nChi Minh City (HCMC), and end at a junction with National Highway 1 \nat  Dau  Giay,  Dong  Nai  Province.  It  will  provide  a  direct  connection \nfrom the center of HCMC to economic growth areas in provinces to the \nnorth  of  HCMC  along  National  Highway  1,  which  connects  HCMC  to \nHanoi.  The  expressway  will  be  a  toll  road,  with  access  initially \nrestricted  to  three  locations:  the  intersection  with  the  Second  Ring \nRoad, the intersection with National Highway 51 at the southern end of \nLong Thanh town, and at Dau Giay. The Project includes construction \nof  a  major  new  1,700-meter  bridge  over  the  Dong  Nai  River  at  Long \nThanh, and two rest and service areas. \n \nThe Government\u2019s Socio-Economic Development Plan for 2006\u20132010 \nfor  a  network  of  high-capacity,  high-speed \nidentifies \nexpressways  to  complement  the  network  of  national,  provincial,  and \ncity  roads.  Under \nthe  Government's  Expressway  Master  Plan, \ndeveloped  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  funding  under \ntechnical  assistance  for  the  Expressway  Network  Development  Plan \nProject approved in 2005, a short-term program of priority expressway \nprojects was identified. This program includes the HLD expressway. \n \nGreater  HCMC  is  the  largest  city  in  Viet  Nam  and  the  country\u2019s \neconomic  hub.  However,  the  road  network  both  within  and  around \nHCMC  is  becoming  heavily  congested,  travel  speeds  are  decreasing, \nand  transport  costs  increasing.  Relief  to  city  roads  connecting  the \ncenter  of  HCMC  and  the  port  area  with  roads  leading  north  from  the \ncity to central and northern Viet Nam is urgently needed. HCMC also \nlies  at  a  critical  junction  on  the  transport  network  for  the  Greater \nMekong Subregion. \n \n\nthe  need \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome  The  project  impact  will  be  business-led,  pro-poor,  and  sustainable \neconomic  growth  in  HCMC  and  neighboring  provinces.  The  project \noutcome  will  be  ability  of  transport  users  in  HCMC  and  Dong  Nai \nProvince  to  travel  from  District  9  in  HCMC  to  Dau  Giay  with  lower \ntransport costs on the HLD expressway.  \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $932.4  million \nequivalent, including taxes and duties of $6.6 million. \n \n\n \nProject Investment \nPlan  \n \nFinancing Plan \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank \nJapan Bank for International Cooperationa \nVietnam Expressway Corporation \n\nTotal \n($ million) \n410.2  \n\n517.6  \n4.6  \n\nPercent \n\n44.0 \n\n55.5 \n0.5 \n\n \na The amount indicated for the Japan Bank for International Cooperation is \n\n932.4  \n\nTotal \n\n100.0 \n\nindicative pending the completion of detailed designs and final cost estimates \n\n(ii) \n\nland  acquisition  and \n\n \nA loan of $410,200,000 from the ordinary capital resources of ADB will \nbe  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a \ngrace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  plus  a  spread  of  0.20%,  a \ncommitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n \nThe  ADB  loan  will  finance  44%  of  the  total  project  cost  and  will  fund \n(i) civil works for construction of the Long Thanh\u2013Dau Giay section of \nthe  HLD  expressway, \nresettlement \ncompensation  and  allowances  for  all  of  the  Project,  (iii)  consulting \nservices, and (iv) project administration costs of Vietnam Expressway \nCorporation  (VEC).  ADB's  financing  will  cover  all  local  taxes  on  the \nADB-financed civil works section. \n \nThe  Government  also  requested  a  loan  of  \u00a550.972  billion  (about \n$444.5 million equivalent) from the Government of Japan through the \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC). The loan will have a \n30-year term, including a grace period of 10 years and an interest rate \nof  1.2%  for  the  construction  loan  and  0.01%  for  consulting  services. \nJBIC will finance civil works for the HCMC\u2013Long Thanh section of the \nHLD  expressway,  an  electronic  toll  collection  and  traffic  information \nand monitoring system for the entire Project, and consulting services.  \n \nVEC will finance the remaining cost of about $4.6 million equivalent. \n \n\n \n\n\f \nAllocation and \nRelending Terms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\niii\n\nThe  discrepancy  between  the  JBIC  loan  amount  and  the  estimated \ncosts  for  the  JBIC-financed  project  components  presented  in  this \ndocument has arisen as a result of the initial JBIC loan amount being \nfixed  in  October  2007,  whereas  the  estimated  costs  are  based  on  an \nupdated cost estimate completed in February 2008. A determination of \nthe  total  amount  of  funding  to  be  provided  by  JBIC  will  be  drawn  up \nonce detailed designs and final cost estimates are complete (expected \nby the end of March 2009); this amount will be consistent with the final \ncost estimates for the components to be funded by JBIC.  \n \nThe  Government  of  Viet  Nam  will  be  the  Borrower  for  the  ADB  and \nJBIC  loans.  The  Government  will  onlend  the  entire  loan  proceeds  to \nVEC,  as  the  Executing  Agency.  For  the  ADB  loan,  the  onlending  will \nbe on terms acceptable to ADB, and at ADB\u2019s interest rate applicable \nto  the  loans,  plus  an  onlending  fee  pursuant  to  the  Borrower\u2019s \nregulations. \n \n31 December 2014 \n \n30 June 2014 \n\n \nVEC \n \nVEC  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  project  implementation  and \nformal  correspondence  with  the  line  ministries,  provincial  authorities, \nand ADB. VEC will engage and direct the work of consultants, and will \nprocure  and  direct  all  contractors.  VEC  will  delegate  responsibility  for \nday-to-day project implementation to the Southern Expressway Project \nManagement  Unit.  The  peoples  committees  of  HCMC  and  Dong  Nai \nProvince  have  established  district  compensation  committees  and \ncommune  resettlement  task  forces  for  all  districts  through  which  the \nHLD expressway will pass. The district compensation committees will \nbe responsible for preparing and implementing the resettlement plans. \nVEC  will  have  overall  responsibility \nthe \nimplementation  of \nenvironmental management plan during design and construction.  \n \nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007 as amended \nfrom time to time). Civil works to be funded from the ADB loan will be \nprocured  through  (i)  international  competitive  bidding  procedures  for \ntwo  contracts  to  construct  the  ADB-funded  section  of  the  HLD \nexpressway,  and  (ii)  national  competitive  bidding  procedures  for  four \ncontracts  to  prepare  resettlement  sites.  JBIC  will  fund  the  remaining \nfour  civil  works  contracts;  procurement  will  follow  JBIC  procedures. \nVEC will fund a contract for clearance of unexploded ordnance for the \nentire expressway; procurement will follow Government procedures. \n \n\nfor \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\nThe consulting service activities to be funded under the Project will be \nundertaken  through  four  contracts,  with  three  funded  from  the  ADB \nloan and one from the JBIC loan. Using ADB loan proceeds, VEC will \nrecruit  international  consulting  firms  for  the  project  supervision  and \nthird  party  quality  assurance  consulting  services  using  quality-  and \ncost-based  selection  procedures.  For  the  project  audit  consulting \nservices, VEC will recruit a national consulting firm using consultants\u2019 \nqualifications  selection  procedures.  All  recruitments  for  ADB-funded \ncontracts  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nThe principal direct benefits generated by the construction of the HLD \nexpressway include (i) increased efficiency of the movement of goods \nand  people  in  the  area  around  HCMC,  the  provinces  surrounding  the \ncity,  and  along  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  southern  and  eastern \neconomic corridors; (ii) reduced transport costs in the same area; and \n(iii)  reduced  social  and  economic  costs  of  traffic  accidents.  As \ntransport  costs  are  a  key  input  to  economic  activities,  the  indirect \nbenefits  of  the  expressway  construction  will  be  an  increase  in \neconomic  growth  and  a  contribution  to  the  Government\u2019s  overall \npoverty reduction program. \n \nThe  main  risk  to  the  Project  is  delayed  implementation  because  of \nslow  finalization  of  detailed  designs  and  procurement  of  civil  works \ncontracts.  This  is  being  addressed  through  the  project  preparation \nwork  undertaken  under  the  ADB-funded  Ho  Chi  Minh  City\u2013Long \nThanh\u2013Dau Giay Expressway Technical Assistance Project. This work \nfacilitate  commencement  of \nincludes  all  activities \nrisk \nconstruction.  The \nassociated  with  VEC\u2019s \nlimited  capacity  and  experience  with \nmanagement  of  major  projects.  It  includes  a  component  to  address \nregulatory  and \nthis \ncomponent, a revised organization structure will be prepared for VEC \nto address the corporation\u2019s future needs.  \n \nThe  construction  of  the  HLD  expressway  is  not  anticipated  to  cause \nany  major  environmental  impacts.  Impacts  during  construction  will  be \nmitigated  through  implementation  of  an  environmental  management \nplan covering both construction and operation phases. Impacts during \noperation  are  expected  to  be  limited  to  air  and  noise  pollution  due  to \nvehicular emissions, and potential water pollution due to accidents. \n \nThe Project will cause significant impacts because of land acquisition \nand  resettlement  activities.  Risks  that  may  arise  from  these  activities \nhave been mitigated through a full resettlement plan and measures to \naddress  vulnerable  groups,  including  a  gender  strategy.  Impacts  on \nethnic  minorities  will  be  minor  as  only  11  households  from  ethnic \nminorities were identified. These 11 households were found to be well \nintegrated into mainstream society; they will not be affected differently \nthan the main ethnic groups. \n\ninstitutional  strengthening  of  VEC.

The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \nIn 2007, the Vietnamese economy expanded by an estimated 8.5%,1 one of the fastest \n2. \nrates  in  the  world.  This  performance  came  on  top  of  an  average  annual  growth  rate  of  8.1% \nduring  2004\u20132006.  In  2007  GDP  growth  was  mainly  driven  by  rapid  growth  in  industry,  which \nexpanded  by  10.6%  and  contributed  4.3%  to  GDP  growth;  and  services,  which  expanded  by \n8.7% and accounted for 3.5% of GDP growth. One of the consequences of this sustained rapid \ngrowth has been an equally rapid increase in the use of motorized vehicles, which is leading to \nincreased  congestion  on  the  highway  network.  If  industry  is  to  continue  as  a  major  driver  of \ngrowth  in  the  Vietnamese  economy,  development  of  the  highway  transport  system  needs  to \ncontinue so that goods and people can be moved efficiently.  \n \nInvestments  in  large  infrastructure  have  played  a  major  role  in  attracting  the  private \n3. \ninvestment and employment that has underpinned Viet Nam\u2019s remarkable success in reducing \npoverty.  While  the  results  of  recent  investments  in  transport  infrastructure  are  impressive, \ninvestment  demands  are  still  considerable  and  past  growth  has  spawned  several  complex \nissues. These challenges are identified in several studies and recognized in the Government\u2019s \nSocio-Economic  Development  Plan  for  2006\u20132010;2 they  generally  fall  into  three  categories: \ntransport management, transport financing, and urbanization. An overview of the road subsector \nis in Appendix 2. \n \n4. \nTransport  Management. Viet Nam has relatively inefficient transport infrastructure and \nhigh  transport  costs.  Capacity  is  constrained;  less  than  5%  of  national  highways  have  four-\nlanes,  and  quality  is  poor.  Less  than  50%  of  national  highways  are  considered  to  be  in  good \ncondition  and  more  than  30%  of  bridges  have  weight  restrictions,  many  waterway  crossings \nhave no bridges. Rail transport is inhibited by low speeds and limited capacity; inland waterways \nhave  limited  cargo-handling  facilities.  Thus,  improving  transport  infrastructure  is  crucial  to \ndeveloping  a  competitive  economy.  To  be  competitive,  infrastructure  must  be  brought  up  to \nmodern  standards.  Viet  Nam  needs  to  enact  and  enforce  laws,  regulations,  and  policies  that \nencourage transportation to and through Viet Nam in conformity with international practices.  \n \n5. \nTransport Financing. Economic growth generates increased demand for infrastructure. \nFunds  from  the  state  budget  are  not  adequate,  even  when  supplemented  with  external \nassistance.  The  World  Bank 3\n estimates  planned  annual  expenditure  of  about  \n$2.3 billion for the period up to 2020, compared to total actual expenditures of about $4.0 billion \nduring  2001\u20132005  of  which  42%  was  funded  by  official  development  assistance.  While  both \ndomestic and foreign private funds are potentially available, but they are rarely accessed due to \nregulatory weaknesses. Given that concessionary official development assistance is limited and \n\n                                                 \n1   Asian Development Bank estimate. \n2   Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2005.

Washington, DC. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nthe demand is great, the Government will need to borrow long-term commercial funds for large \ninfrastructure.  \n \n6. \nUrbanization. With economic development, Viet Nam is becoming an increasingly urban \nsociety;  demands  for  urban  services  are  increasing  rapidly.  Economic  opportunities  in  urban \nareas attract migrants. In 2003, 25% of the country\u2019s population was urban; this is expected to \nreach  45%  by  2020.  Urban  centers  now  account  for  about  70%  of  total  economic  output,  and \nmost  foreign  direct  investment  is  directed  toward  cities.  The  combination  of  rapidly  growing \npopulation  and  economic  growth  rates  higher  than  the  national  average  is  driving  a  rapid \nincrease  in  demand  for  transport  services  in  urban  areas.  Meeting  these  demands  for  urban \ntransport  will  require  large  investments  in  new  roads  and  public  transport,  such  as  mass  rail \ntransport and high-speed, high-capacity expressways.  \n \nB. \n \n7. \nTraffic  volume  is  increasing  rapidly,  typically  more  than  10%  a  year.  Congestion  on \nmany  major  roads  is  an  increasing  problem  and  an  inappropriate  traffic  mix  is  contributing  to \nsevere  road  safety  problems.  The  construction  of  expressways  along  key  corridors  would \nprovide  large  capacity  highways  to  reduce  congestion,  absorb  traffic  growth,  and  reduce  the \nnumber of road safety incidents.  \n \n8. \nGreater  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  (HCMC)  is  the  largest  city  in  Viet  Nam  and  the  country\u2019s \neconomic hub. Its population is forecast to grow by 2.1% per annum from 7.9 million4 in 2008 to \n10.3  million  by  2020.  Growth  in  annual  trade  volume,  in  terms  of  value,  through  HCMC\u2019s  port \nexceeded  15%  in  2006.  The  road  network  both  within  and  around  HCMC  is  already  heavily \ncongested,  travel  speeds  are  reducing,  and  transport  costs  are  increasing.  Relief  is  urgently \nneeded  by  providing  city  roads  connecting  the  center  of  HCMC  and  the  port  area  with  (i) the \nsuburbs to the north and northeast of the city and further out to the roads leading north from the \ncity to central and northern Viet Nam, and (ii) the major subregional transport routes along the \nsouthern  and  eastern  economic  corridors  that  meet  at  HCMC  and  form  part  of  the  Greater \nMekong Subregion (GMS) Transport Network under the GMS program. \n \n\n1. \n\nThe Government\u2019s Strategy \n\n \n9. \nThe Government is acutely aware  of the impact of inadequate infrastructure on growth \nand  poverty  reduction,  and  is  already  beginning  to  see  infrastructure  bottlenecks  affecting \nforeign investment. It wishes to share development more equitably with parts of the country that \nare  remote  from  major  urban  areas\u2014Hanoi,  HCMC,  Da  Nang,  and  others.  As  part  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  for  2006\u20132010  (footnote  2),  the  transport \nsector  is  expected  to  promote  economic  growth,  poverty  reduction,  safety  enhancement, \nenvironmental  protection,  and  human  resource  development.  For  roads,  the  Government  has \nnoted  the  need  for  a  network  of  high-capacity,  high-speed  expressways  to  complement  the \nnetwork of national, provincial, and city roads. Under the Expressway Master Plan, developed \nwith Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance,5 a short-term program (2006\u20132015) of priority \nexpressway  projects  was  developed  consisting  of  21  projects  covering  1,968  kilometers  (km) \nwith  an  estimated  construction  cost  of  $11.556  billion.6 A  medium-term  program  (2016\u20132025) \n\n                                                 \n4   Estimate includes permanent and transient population. \n5   ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Expressway Network Development \n\nPlan. Manila (TA 4695-VIE). \n\n6   In 2007 prices. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nwas  also  proposed  that  included  another  8  projects  covering  an  additional  875  km  with  an \nestimated construction cost of $5.238 billion. \n \n10. \nIn  2004,  Vietnam  Expressway  Corporation  (VEC)  was  established,  as  a  state-owned \nenterprise under the Ministry of Transport, to invest in expressway construction, management, \nand  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M).  In  establishing  VEC,  the  intent  was  to  allow  VEC  to \nindependently  raise  funds  without  recourse  to  sovereign  guarantees.  However,  VEC  cannot \nissue debt instruments until it obtains a credit rating, which at this time is not practical as VEC \nhas virtually no assets and very limited cash flow. Initial projects will need government support \nuntil  VEC  establishes  a  credible  financial  record  that  demonstrates  capacity  to  fund  the  large \ncapital needs required for construction of sections of the expressway network. Establishing this \nfinancial capacity will take some time as the first expressway to begin operation will likely be the \nCau  Gie\u2013Ninh  Binh  Expressway  in  2011.  To  date,  VEC  has  limited  experience  in  project \nmanagement, financial management, procurement, and safeguard issues. The ADB-funded Ho \nChi Minh City\u2013Long Thanh\u2013Dau Giay Technical Assistance Project7 (HLD TA) will implement a \nstrengthening and capacity-building component for VEC that includes tasks to reorganize VEC \nand  put  in  place  financial  information  and  asset  management  systems.  This  work  is  to \nstrengthen the organization structure of VEC, facilitate a change from a state-owned enterprise \nto a commercially oriented infrastructure provider, and position VEC as a viable partner to work \nwith the private sector.  \n \n11. \nThe  legal  and  regulatory  environment  for  private  sector  investment  in  the  transport \nsector  needs  to  be  improved.  Although  the  country  has  a  generic  public\u2013private  partnership \n(PPP) law, it does not meet the specific requirements of road subsector PPPs. Further, existing \nroad  subsector  laws  do  not  provide  a  comprehensive  framework  for  PPPs.  Initiating  and \nattracting  private  investor  interest  to  road  PPPs  depends  on  a  comprehensive  policy.  Such  a \npolicy is absent in Viet Nam. Under the World Bank-funded Road Network Improvement Project8 \na  study  on  PPP  in  the  road  subsector  is  in  progress.  This  study\u2019s  objective  is  to  assist  the \nMinistry  of  Transport  to  formulate  a  strategy  for  development  of  roads  with  PPP,  and  the \npreparation of a policy framework for private sector participation in toll roads. \n \n\n2. \n\nLessons  \n\n \n12. \nADB  country  portfolio  review  missions  have  noted  implementation  delays  in  previous \nroad projects, in particular during project start-up. Delays in recruiting consultants or preparing \ndetailed  designs  have  led  directly  to  delays  in  award  of  civil  works.  This  is  addressed  in  the \ndesign of the Project by (i) using advance action for selecting consultants, and (ii) incorporating \nall safeguard-related and procurement-related activities in the scope of the HLD TA (footnote 7). \nRecruitment  of  consultants  under  the  HLD  TA  was  completed  in  August  2008.  These \nconsultants  have  commenced  work  on \n(i)  preparing  detailed  engineering  designs,  \n(ii)  developing  procurement  documentation,  (iii)  updating  safeguards  documentation,  and  \n(iv) implementing resettlement plans. The intent is that by the time of approval of loans for the \nProject,  updating  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans  will  be  in  progress,  and \nprocurement of civil works and consulting services contracts will be well advanced.  \n \n\n                                                 \n7   ADB.  2007.

The program of investment projects under the country strategy and program form three \nthrusts  that  are  in  line  with  the  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan.  The  first  thrust  supports \ninvestment  projects  to  reduce  critical  transport  bottlenecks  hampering  economic  growth  in  the \nmain  development  centers.  Projects  will  include  investments  in  urban  transport  and  priority \nexpressway  and  railway  facilities  to  facilitate  the  safe  and  efficient  movement  of  goods  and \npeople around, through, and between national centers of major economic activity. The second \nthrust  will  support  social  equity  aspects  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  transport  needs  through  support  to  the \ndevelopment  of  provincial  and  district  roads.  The  third  thrust  complements  the  first  two  by \nbringing  regional  dimensions  to  the  development  of  the  transport  network  in  terms  of \nconnectivity and competitiveness. \n \n14. \nUnder the Expressway Network Development Plan (footnote 5), ADB provided technical \nassistance  (TA)  in  response  to  the  Government\u2019s  request  for  assistance  to  plan  the \ndevelopment of an expressway network. The TA funded a study that prepared an expressway \nmaster plan for the long-term development of the country\u2019s expressway network, and identified \npriority expressway projects. An initial assessment was made of each section of the proposed \nexpressway  network  and  an  overall  ranking  was  prepared  based  on  estimates  of  net  present \nvalue.  Based  on  this  ranking,  the  HLD  expressway  was  evaluated  a  very  high  priority.  Given \nthat  HCMC  is  the  economic  engine  of  Viet  Nam,  and  the  need  to  ensure  that  the  country\u2019s \neconomic  growth  continues,  addressing  the  infrastructure  restraints  of  HCMC  was  given  the \nhighest priority. The HLD expressway is included in the 2004 Urban Transport Master Plan and \nFeasibility  Study  in  the  Ho  Chi  Minh  Metropolitan  Area  (often  referred  to  as  the  HOUTRANS \nstudy),  prepared  with  assistance  from  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency.  The  ADB-\nfunded  HLD  TA  (footnote  7)  will  complete  all  detailed  project  preparation  documentation \nsufficient  to  allow  construction  work  on  the  HLD  expressway  to  commence.  The  HLD  TA \nincludes a strengthening and capacity building component for VEC (para. 10). Work under the \nHLD TA commenced in September 2008. \n \n\n4. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n \n15. \nExternal  support  to  roads  in  Viet  Nam  commenced  in  1993  (Appendix  3).  Initially, \nprojects focused on rehabilitating National Highway 1 (QL1), which runs along the country\u2019s east \ncoast  and  acts  as  the  central  spine  for  the  road  network.  These  QL1  projects  were \ncomplemented by improvements under ADB-funded projects to highways connecting QL1 to the \nViet Nam sections of GMS economic corridors. As work on improving QL1 is drawing to a close, \nprojects  are  increasingly  focusing  on  other  parts  of  the  road  network  and  commencing  the \nconstruction of an expressway network. ADB has provided a TA loan10 and an investment loan11 \nfor  the  GMS  Noi  Bai\u2013Lao  Cai  Highway  Project  that  will  fund  construction  of  this  expressway \nconnecting Hanoi to the border with the People\u2019s Republic of China at Lao Cai. \n \n\n                                                 \n9   ADB. 2006.

Manila (Loans 2391/2392-VIE). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  business-led,  pro-poor,  and  sustainable  economic \n16. \ngrowth  in  HCMC  and  neighboring provinces.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  will  be  that  transport \nusers in HCMC and Dong Nai Province can travel from HCMC District 9 to Dau Giay with lower \ntransport  costs  on  the  HLD  expressway.  At  present,  all  traffic  leaving  HCMC  to  the  northeast \nhas to pass over the Dong Nai Bridge and then pass through a dense area of industrial estates \ncentered on Ben Hoa. Further, the route provides the only connection from the HCMC port area, \nimmediately  to  the  south  of  the  city  center,  to  all  destinations  to  the  north  of  HCMC.  As \neconomic  growth  centers  develop  around  HCMC,  a  high-capacity,  high-speed  transport  link  is \nneeded  to  divert  heavy  port  traffic  away  from  the  city  center  and  provide  direct  access  to  the \nnorth. The HLD expressway provides that link. The benefit to users of the expressway will be a \nreduction in transport costs for the movement of passengers and goods (i) between HCMC and \nthe  provinces  to  the  north  and  northeast  of  the  city,  and  (ii)  along  transport  links  on  the  GMS \nsouthern  and  eastern  economic  corridors.  The  HLD  expressway  is  a  key  link  in  an \ninterconnected  network  of  expressways  and  ring  roads  around  HCMC  that  is  planned  for \ndevelopment within the next 10 years.12 The impact of this network will be to alleviate transport \nconstraints on development in the HCMC area. \n \n17. \nEconomic  activity  in  HCMC  and  the  surrounding  provinces  is  a  major  driver  of  the \nVietnamese economy, and is focused on the industry and service sectors, which are driven by \nexport  markets.  Industrial  developments  in  the  HCMC  area  include  electronics,  industrial \nprocessing,  construction  equipment,  building  materials,  and  agroproducts.  Currently,  the  city \nhas 15 industrial parks and export-processing zones. The value of the city's industrial activities \nin 2007 is estimated at $6.4 billion, equivalent to 30% of the whole country. The value of goods \npassing through HCMC ports in 2007 is estimated at $36 billion, or 40% of the national total, of \nwhich  export  revenue  reached  $18.3  billion  accounting  for  40%  of  the  country\u2019s  total  export \nrevenue.13 With growth in the HCMC area exceeding that of the nation as a whole, the demands \nbeing  placed  on  transport  infrastructure  to  support  economic  activities  are  rising  rapidly  and \nmajor investments are required to expand capacity.  \n \n18. \nThe  Project  comprises  the  construction  of  about  51  km  of  four-lane  expressway.  The \nexpressway  will  commence  in  District  9  of  HCMC  at  the  junction  with  the  Second  Ring  Road \nand  the  East\u2013West  Highway,  a  new  highway  that  crosses  through  the  center  of  HCMC.  The \nHLD expressway will end at the junction at Dau Giay with QL 1, the main north\u2013south highway \nlinking  HCMC  with  Hanoi.  The  alignment  passes  by  the  proposed  site  of  the  new  HCMC \ninternational airport and will relieve congestion on the existing QL 1, through Bien Hoa, for traffic \nentering HCMC from the north. Construction work will include about 21 bridges, of which 20 are \nsmall or medium in scale. The Project will include construction of a new bridge over the Dong \nNai River at Long Thanh; the bridge will have a total length of about 1,700 meters and a width of \n19.75  meters.  The  expressway  will  be  a  toll  road,  with  access  initially  restricted  to  three \nlocations:  the  intersection  with  the  Second  Ring  Road,  the  intersection  with  QL51  at  the \nsouthern end of Long Thanh town, and at Dau Giay. Additional intersections may be provided \nas the road network develops in HCMC and Dong Nai Province, particularly with the proposed \nthird ring road and an expressway from Bien Hoa to Vung Tau. Toll plazas will be constructed at \n\n                                                 \n12  Planned expressways include Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh, Ben Hoa\u2013Vung Tau, and Dau Giay\u2013Nha Trang. Planned ring \n\nroads include the second and third ring roads. \n13  Source: http://www.hochiminhcity.gov.vn/eng. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nOutputs \n\nSpecial Features \n\nthe  three  interchanges;  at  the  interchange  with  QL51  the  toll  booths  will  be  located  on  the \napproach  ramps,  not  on  the  expressway  itself.  In  addition  two  rest  and  service  areas  are \nplanned. \n \nB. \n \n19. \nThe  core  output  from  the  Project  will  be  that  the  HLD  expressway  is  operating, \nconnecting  HCMC  District  9  with  Dau  Giay.  To  ensure  that  the  Project\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental  impacts  are  acceptable,  the  Project  will  implement  full  resettlement  plans,  an \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP)  prepared  based  on  an  environmental \nimpact \nassessment (EIA), and an HIV awareness and prevention of human trafficking program. Project \ndocumentation  incorporates  a  gender  strategy,  and  the  Project  will  implement  a  road  safety \nawareness  campaign  and  road  safety  audits.  A  project  performance  management  system  will \nbe  put  in  place  to  monitor  compliance  with  project  requirements  and  to  measure  project \nindicators.  The  project  design  includes  O&M  of  the  completed  expressway  under  an  O&M \nconcession. \n \nC. \n \n20. \nCofinancing.  The  Project  will  be cofinanced  by  ADB  and  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation (JBIC). Cofinancing will be on a parallel basis with each civil works and consulting \nservices contract funded by a single financier. However, ADB funding will be applied to all land \nacquisition and resettlement activities for the entire Project, and JBIC will fund an electronic toll \ncollection  and  traffic  information  and  monitoring  system  for  the  entire  Project.  An  agreement \nbetween ADB, JBIC, and VEC confirms that the requirements of ADB\u2019s environment, indigenous \npeoples, and involuntary resettlement policies will apply to the entire Project. \n \n21. \nEnvironmental Assessment. Based on the requirements of ADB\u2019s Environment Policy \n(2002),  the  Project  is  categorized  environment  category  A.  The  Government  prepared  an  EIA \nfor  the  Project  and  submitted  it  to  the  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources  and  Environment  in  July \n2007;  it  approved  the  EIA  in  October  2007.  Under  the  ADB-funded  TA  for  the  Expressway \nNetwork  Development  Plan  (footnote  5),  the  Government\u2019s  EIA  was  updated  and  additional \nsections added to fulfill the requirements of ADB\u2019s Environment Policy. A summary EIA for the \nProject was prepared and circulated to the ADB Board of Directors and made publicly available \nthrough  the  ADB  website  on  19  May  2009.  The  project  area  does  not  include  any  sensitive \nareas  such  as  national  parks,  protected  areas,  or  special  use  forests  within  or  near  the \nproposed alignment. Endangered, threatened, or rare species of flora and fauna have not been \nfound in the project area. The construction of the HLD expressway is not anticipated to cause \nany major change to the current ecology. \n \nResettlement Plan. The involuntary resettlement category for the Project is category A. \n22. \nA full resettlement plan was prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy \n(1995). A summary of the resettlement plan is in Appendix 4, and the full resettlement plan is \nprovided  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A.  Based  on  the  results  of  a  census  and  inventory  of \nlosses  carried  out  during  project  preparation,  the  project-affected  persons  (i.e.,  households, \norganizations, companies) were identified. A total of 975 households will be affected in District 9 \nof  HCMC  (167  households)  and  in  four  districts  of  Dong  Nai  Province  (808  households).  Of \nthese, 31 households in HCMC and 392 households in Dong Nai Province will lose more than \n10% of their productive assets; 309 households will have to relocate to new plots of residential \nland as their land will be either totally acquired or the remaining land will be no longer be viable; \nand 246 households will lose some land but they will retain sufficient residential land to retain or \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nrelocate structures on the remaining land. The Project will acquire land currently being used by \nthree rubber plantation companies, commune-owned culverts, 15 irrigation canals, church land \nwith a prayer house, and three foundations for transmission towers. In terms of land acquisition, \n307 hectares will be acquired of which 62 hectares are in HCMC and 245 hectares in Dong Nai \nProvince.  \n \n23. \nLand  Acquisition  and  Retroactive  Financing.  The  Government  requested  that  ADB \nloan funds be used to finance land acquisition and resettlement activities. As required by ADB\u2019s \nOperation Manuals,14 due diligence assessments focused on the (i) expected productive nature \nof  the  acquisition;  (ii)  suitability  of  land  market  conditions;  (iii)  adequacy  of  administrative \narrangements;  (iv)  definition  of  the  risk  profile  of  the  transaction;  and  (v)  soundness  of  the \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  arrangements.  From  the  results  of  these  assessments,  ADB \nconcluded  that  all  requirements  had  been  met,  a  copy  of  the  due  diligence  report  is  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  B.  The  Government  also  requested  that  retroactive  financing  be \napproved for land acquisition and resettlement activities. Approval of this request will allow the \nupdating and implementation of the resettlement plan to proceed in parallel with processing of \nthe  Project  to  expedite  award  of  construction  contracts  and  shorten  project  implementation. \nConsulting services resources to assist in updating and implementing the resettlement plan are \navailable  under  the  HLD  TA  (footnote  7).  However,  implementation  cannot  commence  without \naccess to the Project\u2019s land acquisition and resettlement funds. \n \n24. \nPublic\u2013Private Partnership. As an initial step to the involvement of the private sector in \nthe  expressway  subsector,  an  O&M  concession  will  be  put  in  place  using  competitive  bidding \nprocedures. The intent is that the O&M concession will take effect within 2 years of completion \nof construction of the HLD expressway and use documentation being prepared under the HLD \nTA (footnote 7).  \n \nD. \n \n25. \nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $932.4  million  equivalent,  including  taxes \nand duties of $6.6 million. The total cost includes physical and price contingencies, and interest \nand  other  charges  during  implementation.  The  project  investment  plan  is  shown  in  Table  1, \ndetailed cost estimates are in Appendix 5.  \n \nE. \n \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $410,200,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \n26. \nresources  to  help  finance  the  Project.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility  plus  a  spread  of  0.20%,  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.15%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB. The ADB loan will finance 44% of the total project cost: \n(i)  civil  works  for  construction  of  the  Long  Thanh\u2013Dau  Giay  section  of  the  HLD  expressway,  \n(ii)  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  compensation  and  allowances  for  all  of  the  Project,  \n(iii) consulting services, and (iv) VEC's project administration costs. ADB financing will cover all \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n                                                 \n14  ADB.  2005.  Operations  Manual.

Funds  from  this  account  will  only  be \napplied  to  eligible  payments  for  civil  works  for  the  construction  of  the  Long  Thanh\u2013Dau  Giay \nsection of the HLD expressway. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nJapan Bank for International Cooperationa \nVietnam Expressway Corporation \n \na   The amount indicated for the Japan Bank for International Cooperation is \nindicative pending the completion of detailed designs and cost estimates.  \n\nTotal \n410.2  \n517.6  \n4.6  \n932.4  \n\n% \n44.0 \n55.5 \n0.5 \n100.0 \n\nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nProject  administration  costs  will  be  funded  from  the  ADB  loan.  Eligible  expenses \n28. \nincurred by VEC for project administration, and by the city, provincial, and district resettlement \ncommittees in implementing the resettlement plan will include (i) salaries for full-time VEC staff \nengaged  in  administration  of  the  Project;  (ii)  leases,  utilities,  office  equipment  (both  hard \nfurnishings  and  computer  equipment),  and  communication  charges  for  offices  established  for \nthe  Project  by  VEC;  (iii)  per  diem,  travel,  and  other  field  allowances;  and  (iv)  lease, \nmaintenance, and operating costs for vehicles acquired by VEC for project use only. \n \nThe  Government  also  requested  a  loan  of  \u00a550.972  billion  (about  $444.5  million 15 \n29. \nequivalent)  from  the  Government  of  Japan  through  JBIC.  The  loan  will  have  a  30-year  term, \nincluding a grace period of 10 years and an interest rate of 1.2% for the construction loan and \n0.01% for consulting services. JBIC will finance civil works for the HCMC\u2013Long Thanh section, \nan electronic toll collection and traffic information and monitoring system for the entire Project, \nand  consulting  services.  Counterpart  funds  from  VEC  will  cover  taxes  on  the  JBIC-financed \nproject components. As of October 2007, the agreed amount of funding from JBIC to the Project \nis \u00a550.972 billion, this amount will be provided using a time-slice modality with the first loan for \n\u00a516.643 billion signed in March 2008. Loan documents for the remaining funds will be drawn up \nonce detailed designs and final cost estimates are complete. At that time,16 the total amount of \nfunding to be provided by JBIC, and the value of the second time-slice loan, will be determined \nto  be  consistent  with  the  final  cost  estimates  for  JBIC-funded  components.  The  discrepancy \nbetween  the  agreed  JBIC  loan  amount  and  the  estimated  costs  for  the  JBIC-financed  project \ncomponents presented in this document is a result of the initial JBIC loan amount being fixed in \nOctober  2007,  whereas  the  estimated  costs  are  based  on  a  February  2008  update.  The \nGovernment has provided ADB with an assurance that any shortfall in the JBIC financing will be \ncovered from the Government\u2019s own funds. \n \n30. \nVEC will finance the remaining cost, about $4.6 million equivalent. The loans from ADB \nand JBIC will be lent to the Government of Viet Nam. The Government will onlend the proceeds \nof  the  ADB  loan  to  VEC  through  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement  on  terms  and  conditions \nacceptable to ADB. \n \n\n                                                 \n15  Based on a yen/$ exchange rate of Y114.66/$1 on 30 October 2007, at the time of signing of the memorandum of \n\nunderstanding between JBIC and the Government of Viet Nam. \n\n16  The detailed designs and final cost estimates are being prepared under the HLD TA (footnote 7) and are expected \n\nto be complete by the end of March 2009. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n \n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n\n \nVEC will be the Executing Agency for the Project. VEC will have overall responsibility for \n31. \nproject implementation and formal correspondence with the line ministries, provincial authorities, \nand  ADB.  VEC  will  engage  and  direct  the  work  of  consultants,  and  procure  and  direct  all \ncontractors. It will delegate responsibility for day-to-day project implementation to the Southern \nExpressway Project Management Unit (SEPMU). SEPMU is based in HCMC and will establish \nfield  offices in  district  9 of  HCMC  and  Long  Thanh  district,  Dong  Nai Province.  SEPMU  has  a \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  unit,  headed  by  the  SEPMU  deputy-director,  and  has \nassigned  four  staff  on  a  full-time  basis  to  represent  VEC  on  the  district  compensation \ncommittees  (DCCs).  In  addition,  one  accountant  will  be  responsible  for  administering  and \nmonitoring loan funds for land acquisition and resettlement. Vietnamese regulations require that \nland acquisition and resettlement plans are implemented by the relevant provincial authorities. \nThe  peoples  committees  of  HCMC  and  Dong  Nai  Province  have  established  DCCs  for  all \ndistricts  through  which  the  HLD  expressway  will  pass.  The  DCCs  will  be  the  implementing \nagencies for the land acquisition and resettlement plans, and be responsible for payment of all \ncompensation and allowances. VEC will ensure that an updated resettlement plan is prepared \nprior  to  any  award  of  civil  works  contracts.  VEC  will  have  overall  responsibility  for \nimplementation  of  the  EMP  during  design  and  construction.  EMP  requirements  will  be \nincorporated  into  the  construction  documents;  monitoring  and  enforcement  will  be  ensured  by \nthe ADB- and JBIC-funded construction supervision consultants. VEC will implement the EMP \nrequirements during expressway operation, with the provincial departments of natural resources \nand the environment providing the monitoring. Project organization arrangements are shown in \nAppendix 6. \n  \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n32. \nThe Project will be implemented from December 2008 to June 2014. This assumes that \nconstruction  work  on  the  first  package  will  commence  by  the  June  2009  and  that  the  last \npackage will be sufficiently complete for the HLD expressway to be opened for operation by the \nJune  2013.  An  additional  year  is  allowed  to  complete  all  construction  work  and  finalize \npayments. The implementation schedule for the Project is in Appendix 7. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n33. \nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Civil works to be funded \nfrom the ADB loan will be procured through (i) international competitive bidding procedures for \ntwo  contracts  to  construct  the  ADB-funded  section  of  the  HLD  expressway,  and  (ii)  national \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  for  four  contracts  to  prepare  resettlement  sites.  The  first \ninternational  competitive  bidding  contract  will  cover  construction  of  13.9  km  of  the  HLD \nexpressway from the end of the JBIC section at Long Thanh to a point 37.8 km from the start of \nthe  expressway.  The  second  international  competitive  bidding  contract  will  cover  the \nconstruction  of  17.2  km  of  expressway  from  kilometer  37.8  to  the  eastern  end  of  the  HLD \nexpressway at Dau Giay. Advance contracting procedures will be applied to procurement of civil \nworks contracts. The remaining four civil works contracts will be funded by JBIC and procured \nusing JBIC procedures. JBIC will also fund an equipment contract for an electronic toll collection \nand traffic information and monitoring system for the entire HLD expressway. This contract will \nbe  procured  using  JBIC  procedures.  VEC  will  fund  a  contract  for  clearance  of  unexploded \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\nordnance  for  the  entire  expressway.  This  contract  will  be  procured  using  Government \nprocedures. Contract packages are presented in the procurement plan in Appendix 8. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n34. \nThe  consulting  service  activities  to  be  funded  under  the  Project  will  be  undertaken \nthrough four contracts, with three funded from the ADB loan and one from the JBIC loan. Using \nADB  loan  proceeds,  VEC  will  recruit  international  consulting  firms  for  the  project  supervision \nand  third  party  quality  assurance  consulting  services  using  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nprocedures,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time);  full  technical  proposals  will  be  required.  For  the  project  audit \nconsulting  services,  VEC  will  recruit  a  national consulting  firm  using  consultants\u2019  qualifications \nselection procedures, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Use of \nconsultants\u2019 qualifications selection procedures and a shortlist comprising only national firms is \njustified as (i) the cost of services is estimated at $180,000, (ii) the number of qualified national \nfirms  is  sufficient  to  draw  up  a shortlist,  (iii)  national  firms  have  successfully  undertaken  these \nservices  under  previous  ADB-funded  projects,  and  (iv)  the  preparation  and  evaluation  of \ncompetitive  proposals  is  not  necessary  given  the  nature  of  the  services.  In  the  evaluation  of \nproposals  for  all  services,  except  those  under  consultants\u2019  qualifications  selection  procedures, \nto calculate the firms\u2019 total scores the technical proposals will be given a weight of 80% and the \nfinancial  proposals  a  weight  of  20%.  About  1,800  person-months  (200  person-months  of \ninternational and 1,600 person-months of national consulting services) will be required. For the \nproject  supervision  services,  the  consultants  should  have  expertise  in  project  management, \nhighway engineering, structural engineering, geology, material and quality control, international \nprocurement,  toll  collection  systems,  expressway  O&M  management  and  works,  road  safety \nimprovement,  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation,  project  financial  assessment, \ncorporate  financing,  toll  setting,  EIA  and  environmental  management,  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement,  livelihood  development  and  income  restoration  programs,  ethnic  minority \ndevelopment  strategies,  gender  strategies,  HIV  and  sexually  transmitted  infections,  human \ntrafficking,  and  staff  training.  For  the  third  party  quality  assurance  services,  the  consultants \nshould  have  expertise  in  providing  quality  assurance  services  for  major  highway  projects, \nincluding construction of major bridges. Outline terms of reference for consulting services are in \nAppendix 9. VEC has engaged an external monitoring agency under the HLD TA (footnote 7) to \nmonitor  the  updating  and  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plans.  Retroactive  financing  will \nnot be required for consulting services. \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n \n35. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  VEC.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n \nTo ensure transparency and good governance, VEC will publicly disclose on its website \n36. \ninformation  on  how  loan  proceeds  are  being  used.  For  each  procurement  contract,  VEC  will \ndisclose (i) the list of participating bidders, (ii) name of the winning bidder, (iii) basic details on \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nbidding  procedures  adopted,  (iv)  amount  of  the  contract  awarded,  (v)  list  of  goods  and/or \nservices  purchased,  and  (vi)  intended  and  actual  utilization  of  loan  proceeds  under  each \ncontract.  VEC  will  disclose  details  of  resettlement  reports  on  its  website.  The  website  will  be \nupdated within 2 weeks of each contract being awarded. VEC will submit internal and external \nresettlement  monitoring  reports  to  ADB  every  quarter,  and  place  them  within  2  weeks  of \nsubmission. Moreover, the Government will ensure that all VEC\u2019s project staff are fully aware of \nand comply with Government and ADB procedures, including for implementation, procurement, \nuse of consultants, disbursement, reporting, monitoring, and prevention of fraud and corruption. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n37. \nLoan  disbursement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  between  the \nGovernment and ADB. A diagram showing the funds flow arrangements is in Appendix 10. Loan \nproceeds  will  be  disbursed  directly  to  the  contractors  and  consultants,  based  on  an  approved \ncontract  using  direct  payment  procedures.  An  imprest  account  will  be  established  at  a \ncommercial  bank  acceptable  to  the  Government  and  ADB,  and  be  operated  under  ADB\u2019s \nimprest  account  procedures  as  shown  in  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  VEC  will \nadminister  the  imprest  account.  The  initial  deposit  to  the  imprest  account  will  be  based  on \nADB\u2019s  share  of  estimated  expenditures  to  be  funded  from  the  imprest  account  for  the  first  \n6 months or $40.7 million, whichever is lower. Use of the imprest account will be limited to VEC \nproviding  funds  for  (i)  payments  for  project  administration  costs,  (ii)  payments  for  consulting \nservices, and (iii) replenishment of second generation imprest accounts (SGIAs).   \n \nFive SGIAs will be established in the project districts17 for payment of expenses arising \n38. \nfrom implementation of the Project\u2019s resettlement plan. Use of the SGIAs will be in accordance \nwith procedures in ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook. The initial deposit to an SGIA will be \nbased on ADB\u2019s share of estimated expenditures to be funded from the imprest account for the \nfirst 6 months of project implementation or $5 million, whichever is lower. Use of the SGIAs will \nbe limited to VEC providing funds for payments (i) to affected persons for land and other assets \nacquired  to  facilitate  construction  of  the  HLD  expressway;  (ii)  to  affected  persons  for \nresettlement  compensation  and  allowances  as  set  out  in  the  approved  updated  resettlement \nplan;  (iii)  for  relocation  site  development  and  income  restoration  programs;  and  (iv)  for \nincremental  expenses  incurred  by  the  city,  provincial,  and  district  compensation  committees \nnecessary for implementing the approved updated resettlement plan. Liquidation of any amount \npaid  from  any  SGIA  for  land  or  other  assets  will  require  submission  of  (i)  a  valid  validation \ncertificate  issued  by  an  external  valuer  acceptable  to  both  the  Government  and  ADB;  (ii)  the \nresults  of  the  detailed  measurement  survey  for  the  affected  person  receiving  the  payment, \nsigned as agreed by the affected person, setting out the assets to be acquired; (iii) that receipt \nof  payment  is  acknowledged  by  the  affected  person,  and  (iv)  certification  by  the  external \nmonitoring agency that the affected person has received the full payment. VEC will administer \nthe  SGIAs  and  be  responsible  for  ensuring  they  are  operated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements, authorize all withdrawals from the SGIAs, and ensure that all SGIAs are audited \nas part of the regular annual audits of project accounts. The statement of expenditure procedure \nwill  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  and  liquidate  advances  to  imprest  and  SGIA \naccounts to facilitate project implementation. The ceiling for each payment under the statement \nof expenditure procedure is $100,000. \n \n\n                                                 \n17  District 9 in HCMC, and Cam My, Long Thanh, Nhon Trach, and Thong Nhat districts of Dong Nai Province. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\nRetroactive financing up to a limit of $80 million will be applied to (i) acquisition of land \n39. \nand compensation of nonland assets; (ii) resettlement allowances; (iii) incremental expenses for \nthe  city,  provincial,  and  district  resettlement  committees  incurred  during  implementation  of  the \nproject  resettlement  plan;  (iv)  civil  works  to  prepare  resettlement  sites  for  the  Project;  and  \n(v) implementation of appropriate income restoration programs. Use of retroactive financing for \nthese  activities  is  considered  reasonable  as  this  will  allow  the  timely  commencement  of \nconstruction  activities.  The  $80  million  represents  less  than  20%  of  the  ADB  loan  and  is  thus \nwithin the limit set out in ADB\u2019s Operations Manual.18 Retroactive financing will be applied only \nto  expenditures  incurred  no  earlier  than  12  months  before  the  loan  signing  date  and  under \narrangements acceptable to ADB. Reimbursement procedures, in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook,  will  be  applied  to  payments  for  eligible  expenses  under  retroactive \nfinancing. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n40. \nVEC  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify  goods  and \nservices  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the  project  loan,  financing  resources  received, \nexpenditures  incurred  for  the  Project,  an  audit  of  resettlement  expenditures,  and  use  of  local \nfunds.  Within  6  months  of  the  close  of  the  each  year,  VEC  will  submit  audited  annual  project \naccounts to ADB, which provide a detailed description of the source of funds and expenditures \nmade.  Annual  project  accounts  will  be  audited  by  an  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  the \nauditor\u2019s  terms  of  reference  will  be  approved  by  ADB  before  commencement  of  work.  The \nannual audit will include a separate audit opinion on the imprest account, SGIAs, and statement \nof expenditures procedure operations.  \n \n41. \nRegular progress reports on the Project will be prepared by the construction supervision \nconsultants,  reviewed  by  VEC,  and  submitted by  VEC  to  ADB.  Progress  reports will  include a \ndescription  of  the  physical  progress,  status  of  implementation  of  updated  resettlement  plans, \nstatus  of  work  subject  to  provisions  of  the  EMP,  procurement  and  contractual  status,  and \nhighlights of any implementation issues. The progress reports will contain a summary of project \naccounts,  including  details  of  the  latest  project  expenditures  and  contract  amounts.  They  will \ninclude  an  evaluation  of  progress  in  implementing  the  Project.  Within  6  months  of  physical \ncompletion  of  the  Project,  VEC  will  provide  ADB  with  a  project  completion  report  covering \ndetails of project implementation, costs, and an evaluation of the Project\u2019s success in meeting \nperformance targets. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n42. \nVEC  will  establish  systematic  project  performance  monitoring  and  analysis  throughout \nthe life of the Project and integrate it with the existing management information system. Initially, \nthe  monitoring  system  will  develop  and  conduct  sample  surveys  to  establish  baseline  data  for \nsubsequent  performance  monitoring,  and  will  establish  preproject  social  and  economic  living \nconditions for the direct project beneficiaries. These baseline surveys will be carried out within  \n1  year  of  the  commencement  of  services  of  the  supervision  consultant  and  will  ensure  that \nsufficient  data  is  gathered  to  monitor  the  indicators  set  out  in  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework for the Project. A second survey will be carried out at project completion and a third \nafter a period of not less than 5 years after project completion. The baseline and impact surveys \nwill  include  appropriate  control  areas  and  assess  all  interventions  under  the  Project,  including \nresettlement and other safeguard interventions that affect the livelihood of project beneficiaries. \n\n                                                 \n18  ADB. 2006. Operations Manual. Section H4/BP: Retroactive Financing. Manila \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nIn addition, a set of indicators reflecting transport costs, tariffs, and mobility will be developed to \nassess  the  effects  of  improved  access.  District  indicators  will  include  agricultural  productivity, \neconomic activity, and status of health and education. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n43. \nADB,  together  with  Government  representatives,  will  undertake  regular  reviews  of  the \nProject at about 6-month intervals. At critical periods during implementation of the resettlement \nplans  and  EMPs,  ADB\u2019s  resettlement  and  environment  specialists  will  join  the  reviews.  In \naddition to these regular reviews a comprehensive midterm review of project implementation will \nbe carried out. This midterm review will allow for any necessary midcourse corrections. About 1 \nyear after project completion, a project completion review will document project achievements. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n \n44. \nEconomic  Viability.  Improved  transport  infrastructure  is  critical  for  sustained  rapid \neconomic growth and poverty reduction, and can contribute to regionally balanced and equitable \neconomic growth by stimulating production of goods and increasing trade flows. The Project is \nthe  most  cost-effective  and  least-cost  option  to  accommodate  traffic  growth  in  HCMC  for \nvehicles traveling from  the city center to  the northeast. The principal direct benefits generated \nby construction of the HLD expressway will be (i) increased efficiency of the movement of goods \nand people in the area around HCMC, the provinces surrounding the city, and along the GMS \nsouthern  and  eastern  economic  corridors;  (ii)  reduced  transport  costs  in  the  same  area;  and  \n(iii) reduced social and economic costs of traffic accidents. As transport costs are a key input to \neconomic  activities,  the  indirect  benefits  of  the  expressway  construction  include  increased \neconomic  growth  and  support  for  the  Government\u2019s  overall  poverty  reduction  program.  Traffic \nvolume  on  existing  roads  in  the  project  area  has  been  increasing  at  about  7%  per  annum  for \npassengers  for  the  last  7  years  and  about  12%  for  freight.  In  certain  sections,  the  capacity  is \nsaturated. Approximately 30%\u201340% of the traffic on existing roads is forecast to be diverted to \nthe project expressway. The forecast daily traffic volume on the HCMC\u2013Long Thanh section, for \nexample, is expected to grow from 17,200 vehicles in 2013 to 30,400 vehicles in 2020, a 8.5% \naverage  annual  growth  rate.  It  will  then  grow  more  slowly  at  6.7%  per  annum  to  reach  an \naverage of 42,000 vehicles in 2025 (Appendix 11). \n \n45. \nThe  Project\u2019s  economic  internal  rate  of  return  was  estimated  by  comparing  the  major \nroad networks of eastern HCMC with and without the Project. Without the Project, traffic will use \nthe existing road network, which will be congested and expensive to maintain because of rapidly \nincreasing traffic. With the Project, congestion on existing roads will be reduced, and traffic on \nboth  the  project  expressway  and  existing  roads  will  benefit  from  faster  travel.  The  project \neconomic  costs  include  (i)  capital  costs  and  resettlement  costs,  excluding  tax  and  price \ncontingency;  and  (ii)  the  expressway\u2019s  O&M  cost.  The  project  economic  benefits  are  reduced \nvehicle  operating  cost  and  reduced  passenger  travel  times,  which  will  benefit  traffic  on  the \nexpressway and traffic on existing roads. The Project yields an economic internal rate of return \nof 15.6%, indicating that it is economically viable. Sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of \nthe Project\u2019s economic viability. The capital cost would have to be 45.1% higher than projected, \nor  project  benefit  31.9%  lower  than  projected,  for  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  to  fall \nbelow the cutoff rate of 12%. The economic analysis of the Project was extended to analyze the \ndistribution  of  project  net  benefits  by  determining  the  project  effects  for  various  beneficiaries, \nincluding  road  users,  laborers,  and  the  Government  (Appendix  11  and  Supplementary  \nAppendix C). One of the risks that would prevent realization of the full economic benefits of the \nexpressway is the use of the expressway by overloaded trucks. To address this risk the project \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\ndesign includes truck weigh-station facilities. Inflation in Viet Nam accelerated markedly in late \n2007  and  early  2008  due  to  a  combination  of  internal  and  external  factors.  The  Project  is \nunlikely  to  fuel  inflation  as  the  bulk  of  expenditures  will  be  incurred  from  2010  onward  when \ninflation  is  expected  to  slow  to  single  digits.  In  the  medium  to  long  term,  the  Project  will  help \ncontain inflation because it will reduce infrastructure bottlenecks and increase aggregate supply. \n \n46. \nFinancial Viability. The Project\u2019s financial viability was assessed by (i) determining the \nfinancial internal rate of return (FIRR), and (ii) analyzing the Project\u2019s financial statements. The \nfinancial  viability  in  terms  of  the  FIRR  was  assessed  by  comparing  the  Project\u2019s  FIRR  to  the \nweighted  average  cost  of  capital  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial \nManagement and Analysis of Projects (2005). The financial analysis examined the aggregated \ncosts  and  benefits  from  toll  revenues  of  the  highway,  and  is  based  on  toll  rates  of  D900  per \npassenger  car  unit  per  km.  The  FIRR  of  the  Project  was  calculated  for  2008  to  2033  using \nconstant  2007  prices.  The  projected  financial  statements  for  the  Project  were  prepared  in \ncurrent  terms  using  the  same  period  as  the  FIRR  analysis.  From  this  analysis,  the  Project\u2019s \nFIRR is estimated at 4.0% after tax, this exceeds the weighted average cost of capital, which is \ncalculated as 1.1%, indicating that the Project is financially viable. Sensitivity tests show that the \nFIRR exceeds the weighted average cost of capital even under a range of adverse scenarios. \nThe projected financial statements demonstrate that the Project will have enough retained cash \nto cover O&M costs and annual debt service. The FIRR calculation and the projected financial \nstatements are shown in Appendix 12 and Supplementary Appendix D. The proposed toll rate of \nD900  per  passenger  car  unit  per  km  is  considered  reasonable 19 and  affordable,  given  that \nHCMC is one of the most developed areas of Viet Nam. A review of the proposed toll rate will \nbe  undertaken  6  months  prior  to  the  opening  of  the  expressway.  The  review  will  confirm  toll \nrates  at  opening  that  are  consistent  with  the  financial  viability  of  the  Project  and  meet  the \nrequired financial ratios. It will take into account the review of toll regulations to be undertaken \nunder the HLD TA (footnote 7). \n \nFinancial  Sustainability  of  VEC.  VEC  is  currently  processing  or  implementing  three \n47. \nprojects: (i) the Cau Gie\u2013Ninh Binh Expressway Project (50 km, under construction); (ii) the Noi \nBai\u2013Lao  Cai  Expressway  Project  (244  km);  and  (iii)  the  proposed  Project.  The  total  capital \nexpenditures for these three projects will exceed $2.5 billion, with revenues to VEC projected to \ncommence in 2011 when operation of the Cau Gie\u2013Ninh Binh Expressway starts. The analysis \nof financial projections for VEC is based on these activities. This analysis assumes that VEC will \ncharge  D900  per  passenger  car  unit  per  km  for  the  Project  and  that  this  will  be  adjusted  to \naccount  for  inflation.  The  results  show  that  VEC  will  have  net  operating  losses  until  2016 \nbecause toll revenue will not be sufficient to cover depreciation costs and interest in the initial \noperation  stage.  However,  VEC  can  maintain  positive  accumulated  cash  flow  throughout  the \noperating  period  to  cover  debt  service.  A  net  operating  profit  will  be  generated  from  2017,  or  \n7  years  from  the  commencement  of  operations,  on  the  assumption  of  a  gradual  increase  in \ntraffic volume. The estimated debt to equity ratio will be 95:5 in 2013, and improve to 77:23 in \n2022 as a result of increased retained earnings. Despite its large-scale investments, VEC will be \nfinancially  viable  in  the medium  and  long  term  without  additional  subsidies  during  expressway \noperation.  VEC  needs  to  establish  a  financial  information  system  to  ensure  that  investments \ntarget  financially  sustainable  expressway  projects,  through  which  VEC  may  monitor  cost \nrecovery, plan traffic forecasts and toll rates, make projected financial statements, and develop \na debt management strategy. A system to meet this need is to be designed and commissioned \nunder  the  HLD  TA  (footnote  7).  Financial  and  institutional  analyses  of  VEC  are  provided  in \nAppendix 13 and financial projections of the Project and VEC are in Supplementary Appendix D. \n\n                                                 \n19  The toll rate adopted for the Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Expressway (footnote 14) was D800 per passenger car unit per km. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n48. \nEnvironmental Impacts. The project area does not include any sensitive areas such as \nnational  parks,  protected  areas,  or  special  use  forests  within  or  near  the  proposed  alignment. \nEndangered,  threatened,  or  rare  species  of  flora  and  fauna  have  not  been  found.  The \nconstruction of the HLD expressway is not anticipated to cause any major change to the present \necological  situation.  Predicted  environmental  impacts  during  construction  include  air  pollution, \nmainly due to dust emission; noise and vibration; water pollution due to fuel spills and improper \nwaste disposal; soil erosion and siltation of water courses due to earthworks and extraction of \nborrow  materials;  and  temporary  obstructions  of  river  flow.  Impacts  during  operation  are \nexpected to be limited to air and noise pollution due to vehicular emissions, and potential water \npollution due to accidents involving transportation of chemicals and other hazardous materials. \nLand  use  within  the  project  area  is  dominated  by  tree  plantations  (mainly  rubber)  and  paddy \nfields; significant impacts to flora and fauna are not anticipated.  \n \n49. \nThe  mitigation  measures  identified  in  the  EIA  for  the  construction  phase  include  \n(i)  treatment  of sewage at  construction  camps  and  discharge  from  work  sites,  and mixing  and \ncrushing plants; (ii) dust suppression measures; (iii) maintenance of construction equipment and \nvehicles; (iv) restoration of borrow areas; (v) restriction of high noise activities to daylight hours; \n(vi) installation of temporary noise walls or boards at sensitive sites; (vii) coordination with local \nauthorities  on  collection  and  disposal  of  waste  and  surplus  soil;  (viii)  provision  of  concrete \npavement and oil separator in fuel storage sites; (ix) locating crushing and mixing plants away \nfrom  sensitive  sites;  and  (x)  implementation  of  slope  stabilization  measures.  The  civil  works \ncontractors  will  undertake  these  mitigation  measures,  while  VEC,  with  the  assistance  of  the \nsupervision  consultant  will  monitor  the  contractor\u2019s  environmental  performance.  During \noperation,  air  pollution  can  be  minimized  by  ensuring  a  steady  flow  of  traffic  and  avoiding \ncongestion.  VEC  will  cooperate  with  the  local  authorities  to  ensure  enforcement  of  road \nregulations. Two rows of trees will be planted on each side of the expressway to help minimize \nnoise and the spread of dust. Where the HLD expressway passes through residential areas in \nLong  Thanh,  sound-insulating  walls  will  be  constructed  to  reduce  noise.  VEC  will  prepare  an \nemergency  action  plan  for  use  during  expressway  operation  to  address  accidents  involving \nchemicals and other hazardous materials.  \n \nDuring detailed design of the expressway, being undertaken under the ADB-funded HLD \n50. \nTA  (footnote  7),  the  design  consultants  will  update  the  EMP  and  incorporate  in  the  project \ndesign  relevant  mitigation  measures  identified  in  the  EMP.  VEC  will  ensure  that  (i)  bidding \ndocuments for the civil works include contract clauses requiring the contractor to implement the \nEMP, (ii) contractors prepare a site-specific EMP based on the actual situation on-site and the \nEMP prepared for the Project, and (iii) the EMP is properly implemented during different project \nphases.  Provided  the  mitigation  measures  defined  in  the  EMP  are  implemented  appropriately \nbefore  and  during  construction,  and  throughout  the  expressway  operation,  the  Project  will  not \nresult in significant environmental impacts. \n \n51. \nSocial  Impacts. The HLD expressway will be constructed within HCMC and Dong Nai \nProvince, one of the least poor provinces in the country with a poverty rate of 10.33% (Viet Nam \nHousehold Living Standard Survey 2002). Given the low rate of poverty in the project area, and \nthat the expressway is intended to serve long distance traffic, the Project will have limited direct \nimpact  on  poverty  reduction  in  communities  living  along  the  expressway.  Even  though \nexpressways  generally  do  not  directly  address  local  poverty,  they  do  address  it  indirectly  by \nfacilitating continued economic growth. Improved transport infrastructure is critical for sustained \nrapid economic growth and overall poverty reduction, and can contribute to regionally balanced \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17 \n\nto  HIV  and \n\nand  equitable  economic  growth  by  stimulating agriculture production and  increasing  access  to \nemployment opportunities.  \n \n52. \nThe  Project\u2019s  social  impacts  relate  to  (i)  displacing  local  residents  because  of  land \nacquisition;  (ii)  losing  productive  land;  (iii)  dividing  local  communities  and  disrupting  the  local \nroad network: (iv) increasing traffic risks for people living and working along the highway due to \nthe large volume of traffic and higher vehicle speeds along the highway; and (v) increasing risks \nof  exposure \ntrafficking  of  women  and  children  during  construction  and \npostconstruction  phases  due  to  the  large  volume  of  transit  traffic  along  the  highway.  Unless \ncompensation,  income  restoration  measures,  and  livelihood  activities  relating  to  involuntary \nresettlement are delivered on time; these can pose significant risk to the livelihoods of project-\naffected  households.  The  Project  is  formulated  to  minimize  potential  risks.  A  full  resettlement \nplan  was  prepared  that  includes  compensation  and  allowances  for  households  that  will  be \nimpacted  by  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities,  and  an  income  restoration  plan  for \npeople who have been significantly affected. Land acquisition for expressway construction can \ndivide existing communities and disrupt existing local transport networks, which could have an \nimpact on the livelihood of local communities. During the detail project design, consultation with \nlocal  residents  will  be  undertaken  to  ensure  that  underpasses  and  overpasses  are  provided. \nThese  will  maintain  the  functions  of  existing  local  roads  and  irrigation  systems  during \nconstruction  and  operation,  and  minimize  disruption  to  local  peoples'  livelihood  systems  and \nsocial networks.  \n \n53. \nLand  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  The  involuntary  resettlement  category  for  the \nProject  is  category  A.  VEC,  together  with  the  local  officials  of  HCMC  and  Dong  Nai  Province, \nprepared a full resettlement plan based on the socioeconomic and inventory of losses surveys. \nA  summary  of  the  resettlement  plan  is  in  Appendix  4,  and  the  full  resettlement  plan  is  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  A.  Consultations,  public  meetings,  and  village  discussions  with \naffected  households  and  local  officials  were  carried  out  during  the  resettlement  planning \nprocess.  These  activities  will  continue  during  updating  and  implementation.  DCCs  have  been \nestablished  in  HCMC  and  Dong  Nai  Province.  The  DCCs,  together  with  VEC,  will  update  the \napproved  resettlement  plan  based  on  detailed  design  of  the  highway;  and  implement  land \nacquisition, resettlement, livelihood restoration, and income-restoration activities. The estimated \nresettlement  cost  is  $186.05  million,  of  which  about  $157.58  million  will  be  required  for  land \nacquisition  and  $28.47  million  for  resettlement  allowances  and  compensation.  VEC  will  be \nresponsible for internal monitoring of resettlement activities, and contract an external monitoring \nagency for independent monitoring and evaluation. The internal and external monitoring reports \nwill  be  uploaded  to  VEC\u2019s  website,  submitted  to  ADB  every  quarter,  and  uploaded  to  ADB\u2019s \nwebsite  until  the  resettlement  and  income  restoration  programs  are  complete.  The  project \nsupervision consultants will provide formal and on-the-job training to VEC and the DCCs. \n \nHIV  and  Human  Trafficking.  In  2003,  HCMC  residents  accounted  for  25%  of  all  HIV \n54. \ninfections  in  the  country.  The  city  has  the  fastest  growing  epidemic  in  the  country  with  HIV \nprevalence among adults aged 15\u201329 estimated to be about 1.2%, making this one of the worst \nepidemics  in  Viet  Nam.  The  number  of  infected  females  relative  to  males  is  increasing  each \nyear, indicating increasing heterosexual transmission.20 The influx of construction workers in the \nProject during construction and increased volume of transit traffic in the postconstruction period \nwill  increase  the  risk  of  HIV  and  human  trafficking.  With  improved  transportation  and \ninfrastructure,  existing  risks  and  vulnerabilities  for  HIV  transmission,  drug  use,  and  trafficking \n\n                                                 \n20  Ministry of Health, General Department of Preventative Medicine and HIV/AIDS Control. 2005. HIV/AIDs Estimates \n\nand Projections 2005\u20132010. Hanoi, Viet Nam. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nalong  the  highway  will  significantly  increase  if  targeted  risk  mitigation  initiatives  are  not \nimplemented.  Reports  from  nongovernment  organizations  and  aid  organizations  indicate  that \nthe  rate  of human  trafficking  from  the  south  to HCMC  is  high.  To  mitigate  these  risks,  an  HIV \nawareness  and  prevention  of  human  trafficking  program  is  included  in  the  Project  to  minimize \nexposure of the local population to these issues (a summary of the program is in Supplementary \nAppendix  E).  The  program  includes  capacity  building  of  VEC,  awareness  campaigns  in \nconstruction  camps  and  communities  in  the  project  districts,  development  of  peer  educators, \ncommunity  monitoring,  and  distribution  of  medical  equipment  to  relevant  health  facilities.  Also \nincluded  are  community  awareness  programs  on  human  trafficking,  safe  migration,  and \ncommunity  monitoring.  It  will  be  managed  by  the  construction  supervision  consultant;  a \nsummary of the terms of reference is in Appendix 9. \n \nEthnic  Minorities.  The overwhelming majority of the population within the project area \n55. \nis from the main ethnic group, the Kinh. Of the 800 households affected by resettlement, only 11 \nbelong to an ethnic minority. These 11 households are disbursed across the project districts; are \nliving within Kinh communities; and are well-integrated within mainstream Vietnamese society in \nterms of language, clothing, housing, and daily livelihood activities. A specific action for these 11 \nhouseholds is included in the resettlement plan.  \n \n56. \nGender.  The  resettlement  impact  on  poor  women  and  households  headed  by  women \ncould be significant. Poor women and women who head households in the project area are at \nmore  risk  economically  (loss  of  productive  assets  due  to  land  acquisition)  and  socially  (risks \nposed  by  HIV,  road  safety,  and  possible  human  trafficking)  than  males.  To  address  loss  of \nlivelihood of poor women and households headed by women, the resettlement plan includes a \nlivelihood program targeted at women in the project districts. A project-specific gender strategy \nwas  prepared  and  is  described  in  the  summary  of  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy \n(Appendix  14).  The  gender  strategy  includes  capacity-building  training  and  consultation \nworkshops  with  those  affected  to  increase  their  understanding  of  resettlement  issues \n(compensation,  entitlements,  and  grievance  procedures)  and  to  develop  skills  for  appropriate \nlivelihood activities.  \n \n57. \nRoad  Safety.  The  expressway  is  expected  to  provide  road  users  with  a  safe \nenvironment  compared  to  normal  roads.  However,  for  this  benefit  to  be  realized,  users  must \nmake  behavioral  changes  to  adapt  to  the  high  speed,  limited  access  environment  of  an \nexpressway. To address these and other road safety issues, a road safety awareness campaign \nand road safety audits are included in the tasks for the construction supervision consultant. \n \n58. \nProject  Implementation.  The  main  risk  to  the  Project  is  delayed  implementation \nbecause of slow finalization of detailed designs and procurement of civil works contracts. This is \nbeing addressed through the project preparation work undertaken under the HLD TA (footnote \n7). This work includes all activities required to advance the  commencement of construction. A \nfurther  risk  is  VEC\u2019s  limited  capacity  and  experience  with  project  management  for  major \nprojects. This risk is being mitigated through the HLD TA component to address regulatory and \ninstitutional  strengthening  of  VEC.  Under  this  component,  a  revised  organization  structure  will \nbe  prepared  for  VEC  to  address  future  needs  of  VEC  as  an  efficient  provider  of  infrastructure \nservices.  This  new  structure  will  include  a  unit  to  manage  environmental  and  social  impacts \narising from expressway construction and operation.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19 \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n59. \nhave given the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government, Ministry of Transport, and VEC \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nJBIC  cofinancing.  In  the  event  where  funds  from  loan  agreements  between \nJBIC and the Government are insufficient at any time to finance the items to be \nfunded  by  JBIC,  the  Government  undertakes  to  fund  the  shortfall  from  its  own \nresources under arrangements satisfactory to ADB. \nFinancial matters. The Government will ensure that VEC will achieve (a) a debt \nservice coverage ratio of at least 1.2 times, and (b) a debt to equity ratio of not \ngreater than 90:10 beginning from fiscal year 2020. The Government will ensure \nthat, no later than 1 June 2012 or the date of opening of the ADB section of the \nHLD  expressway  from  Long  Thanh  to  Dau  Giay  (whichever  falls  earlier),  VEC \nhas  established  toll  rates  sufficient  to  satisfy  VEC's  minimum  debt  service \ncoverage ratio and debt to equity ratios. \nResettlement.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  (a)  VEC  recruits  an  external \nmonitoring agency before commencement of any land acquisition activities; and \n(b)  land  acquisition  and  relocation  activities  do  not  commence  until  an  updated \nresettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  for  that  section  and  the  updated \nresettlement plan has been reviewed and approved by ADB. Resettlement plans \nwill  be  prepared  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  and \nthe  Government\u2019s  laws,  regulations,  and  procedures;  and  be  applied  to  all \nresettlement activities under the Project, regardless of the source of funding.  \nVEC  will  ensure  that  all  payments  for  land  will  require  (a)  a  valid  validation \ncertificate issued  by  an  external  valuer  acceptable  to  both  the  Government  and \nADB; (b) the results of the detailed measurement survey for the affected person \nreceiving  the  payment,  signed  as  agreed  by  affected  person,  setting  out  the \nassets  to  be  acquired;  (c)  that  receipt  of  payment  is  acknowledged  by  the \naffected  person,  and  (d)  certification  by  the  external  monitoring  agency  that  the \naffected person has received the full payment. \nVEC will ensure that civil works contractors are not issued a notice of possession \nfor a geographic area until (a) compensation payment and relocation to new sites \nhas  been  satisfactorily  completed  for  that  area,  (b)  agreed  rehabilitation \nassistance is in place, and (c) the area is free of all encumbrances. \nIndigenous  peoples  and  ethnic  minorities. The Government will ensure that, \nto  the  extent  any  ethnic  minorities  are  likely  to  be  significantly  affected  by  the \nProject,  the  measures  set  forth  in  the  ethnic  minority  specific  sections  in  the \nresettlement  plans,  and  as  agreed  between  the  Government  and  ADB,  are \ncarried  out  in  accordance  with  such  actions,  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of \nthe Government, and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998).  \n\n(vii)  Gender.  VEC  will  implement  the  provisions  set  forth  in  the  project-specific \ngender  strategy,  the  updated  resettlement  plan,  and  the  HIV  awareness  and \nprevention of human trafficking program.  \n\n(viii)  Other  social  issues.  VEC  will  ensure  that  all  civil  works  contracts  incorporate \nprovisions  that  contractors  comply  with  all  applicable  labor  laws  and  related \ninternational treaties and carry out the HIV awareness and prevention of human \ntrafficking program in the campsites and corridors of influence. \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nGovernance.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  a  project-specific  web  page  will \nbe  established  and  information  will  be  publicly  disclosed  on  this  web  page  on \nhow  loan  proceeds  are  being  used,  including  for  each  contract  (a)  the  list  of \nparticipating bidders, (b) name of the winning bidder, (c) basic details on bidding \nprocedures adopted, (d) amount of the contract awarded, (d) list of goods and/or \nservices  purchased,  and  (e)  intended  and  actual  utilization  of  loan  proceeds \nunder each contract. The web page will be updated after each award of contract. \nOperation  and  maintenance.  By completion of the works, VEC shall submit to \nADB documentation for an O&M concession for the entire Expressway including \na time-bound implementation schedule. \nEnvironmental.  VEC  will  ensure  (a)  that  specific  provisions  are  included  for \nimplementation  of  the  EMP  and  its  monitoring  in  civil  works  contracts,  and  in \nconsulting  services  contracts;  and  (b)  the  environmental  mitigation  measures  in \nthe  EIA  prepared  under  the  ADB-funded  TA  (footnote  5)  will  be  adequately \nimplemented  by  the  contractors.

While national and provincial roads provide the key links in the \nroad network, in 2004 only 44.8% of the total length of national roads was reported as being in \ngood condition. The existing national road system was mainly constructed with two lanes; only \nlimited  lengths  near  major  urban  areas  were  constructed  with  four  lanes.  Only  3.9%  of  the \nnational road network has four lanes; 66% has two or three lanes.

The  complex  traffic  conditions  cause  many  problems  such  as  poor  safety,  limited \nvehicle  speed,  and  low  capacity.  Motorbikes  have  increased  at  more  than  20%  per  year,  and \ntotaled over 11 million in 2003 (140 per 1,000 people). The number of four-wheel drive vehicles \nand articulated trucks grew slightly faster than gross domestic product, from 400,000 in 1997 to \n600,000 in 2002 (7.5 vehicles per 1,000 population). Trucks comprise 30% of the fleet; 80% of \nthem are small to medium size and only 10% are modern articulated trucks.  \n \nB. \n \nAdministration of the highways is determined by the administrative category of the road. \n3. \nNational,  provincial,  district,  urban  (cities  and  towns),  and  commune  authorities  administer  the \ncorresponding  category  of  road.  National  responsibility  for  the  road  network  lies  with  the  Viet \nNam  Road  Administration  under  the  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT).  However,  in  2004,  Vietnam \nExpressway Corporation (VEC) was established under MOT to develop expressways. \n \nC. \n \nPoor road safety is a serious and growing problem throughout Viet Nam\u201414,161 road \n4. \ndeaths  were  reported  in  2006,  equivalent  to  about  7  deaths  per  annum  per  10,000  vehicles. \nThis  was  a  marginal  increase  from  2005.  Fatality  rates  for  Viet  Nam  are  very  high,  even  in \ncomparison  with  many  neighboring  countries  in  southeast  Asia,  and  new  initiatives  in  road \npolicy  and  management  are  urgently  required.  Most  road  deaths  (60%)  occurred  on  national \nhighways, but the number of accidents and deaths on provincial roads is increasing. The major \ncauses of traffic accidents are speeding, misuse of drugs, and not following traffic regulations. \n\nRoad Safety \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\nAdditional factors are the mix of different vehicle types using individual roads, particularly that of \nhigh- and low-speed vehicles sharing the same facility, and poor road traffic management. The \nGovernment  established  an  interministerial  national  traffic  safety  program  to  address  road \nsafety  initiatives  where  roles  and  budget  are  allocated  to  each  ministry  concerned.  Under  this \nprogram,  campaigns  are  being  undertaken  to  promote  enforcement  of  traffic  laws,  road  traffic \nsafety, and regulation of the sale and use of motorcycles. However, this program has only had \nlimited  effect.1 Full  access-controlled  highways  (essentially  expressways)  can  address  some \naspects of the road safety problem as (i) they are targeted at high-speed long-distance traffic, \nso slower local traffic does not have access; and (ii) access is restricted to a limited number of \njunctions, with each junction designed to allow safe entry and exit of traffic. \n \nD. \n \n4. \nVEC was established in October 2004 under MOT to develop expressways in Viet Nam. \nUnder  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  Expressway  Network \nDevelopment Plan,2 a review was undertaken of the (i) government policies, laws, regulations, \ndecrees,  circulars,  and  charters  relevant  to  VEC;  (ii)  current  organization  structure  of  VEC, \nincluding the role and responsibilities of each VEC department and division, segregation of duty, \nand staffing; and (iii) VEC\u2019s future organization development plan. The study identified several \nissues that must be addressed, and are discussed in this appendix. Further information on the \ninstitutional structure and financial management at VEC are given in Appendix 13. \n\nVietnam Expressway Corporation \n\n \n1. \n\nOrganization  \n\n \nVEC was established with an organization structure intended for the start-up phase. As \n5. \nof  January  2007,  VEC  was  implementing  two  construction  projects  and  had  management \nsystems in place for these. Tolling operations are limited to two toll plazas.  VEC does not have \nany expressway operation and maintenance contracts in place; is not providing any additional \nsupport  activities  to  expressways,  such  as  roadside  facilities;  and  has  not  implemented \nprocesses to enable public\u2013private partnerships. Further, VEC has limited capacity to manage \nthe  social  and  environmental  impacts  of  the  expressways.  To  administer  the  proposed \nexpressway  program,  VEC  needs  to  expand  its  capacity  to  enable  it  to  manage  several  large \ncomplex projects and to take on new activities in terms of additional skills. \n \n6. \nVEC was established as a fully owned state-owned enterprise under MOT. However, the \nLaw  on  State  Enterprises,  2003,  requires  all  state-owned  enterprises  be  converted  into  a \ncompany operating under the Law on Enterprises before 2010. VEC is expected to operate as a \nregulator  and  owner  of  the  expressway  network  and  as  a  supplier  of  various  services.  These \ndemands  require  revision  of  the  organization  structure,  particularly  to  separate  the  roles  of \nregulator  and  supplier  within  VEC.  The  revisions  recommended  by  the  Expressway  Network \nDevelopment Plan report3 need to be refined for implementation. \n \n\n2. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Framework \n\n \nThe  Expressway  Network  Development  Plan  TA  reviewed  legal  and  regulatory \n7. \ndocuments  that  apply  to  expressways.  The  study  identified  several  issues  to  be  addressed \n                                                 \n1   Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation.  2003.

Of \nparticular  concern  is  Circular  90,  covering  toll  regimes  for  roads.  As  presently  formulated,  this \ncircular is very restrictive in terms of ceilings on toll rates, which may have consequences for the \nfinancial  viability  of  some  expressways.  The  TA  also  recommends  how  this  circular  could  be \nrevised to accommodate more flexible toll arrangements. \n\n \n3. \n\n \n4. \n\nTraining Needs \n\n \nGiven that VEC is a new organization, many staff require training to fully engage in their \n8. \nroles and responsibilities. The Expressway Network Development Plan TA undertook an initial \nassessment of training needs; a detailed program to address training needs is to be prepared \nonce work on the revised organization structure is complete. \n\nFinancial and Asset Management Systems \n\nThe Expressway Master Plan \n\n \n9. \nVEC  currently  uses  standard  accounting  software  to  record  all  financial  transactions. \nHowever, a financial management system is needed to allow data to be accessed and analyzed \nto  meet  needs  other  than  formal  financial  reporting.  The  Expressway  Network  Development \nPlan TA identified a need for an asset management system. \n \nE. \n \n10. \nUnder The Expressway Network Development Plan TA, ADB provided funding to assist \nthe Government in preparing an expressway master plan for a national expressway system. The \nplan identifies a logical national network of expressways and prioritizes the construction of each \nsection based on economic and financial viability.  \n \n11. \nThe  existing  national  road  system  was  mainly  constructed  with  two  lanes,  and  a  small \npart  with  four  lanes.  Traffic  growth  predictions  vary  across  the  country,  but  with  short-term \ngrowth  of  7%\u201310%  (to  2015),  traffic  volume  is  set  to  grow  significantly.  Given  that  critical \nsections of the existing network are already congested, the capacity of the network needs to be \nexpanded  rapidly  to  accommodate  additional  traffic.  Design  standards  for  expressways  differ \nfrom normal roads, as they are targeted at allowing a large number of vehicles to move freely \nbetween major centers, at speed, and with a high degree of safety. The proposed expressway \nnetwork will provide high-capacity highways that will connect key economic zones, large urban \ncenters,  industrial  zones,  and  international  borders.  The  master  plan  proposes  that  the  main \nfeatures  of  the  network  be  two  north\u2013south  expressway  axes,  and  six  east\u2013west  expressway \naxes,  together  with  14  expressway  sections  that  provide  access  around  major  centers.  The \nshort-term  program  (2006\u20132015)  includes  21  priority  expressway  projects  covering  1,968  km, \nwith an estimated construction cost of $11.556 billion.4 A medium-term program (2016\u20132025) is \nproposed  that  includes  another  8  projects  covering  an  additional  875  km,  with  an  estimated \nconstruction cost of $5.238 billion.

The  expressway  will  be  constructed  as  a  tolled  four-lane  facility  (two  lanes  in \neach direction), with access initially restricted to three locations: the intersection with Ring Road \n2, the intersection with National Highway 51 (QL51) at the southern end of Long Thanh town, \nand at Dau Giay. \n\nScope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n\n \nB. \n \n2. \nNai 245 ha). The census and inventory of losses identified the following:    \n \n\nThe Project will require acquisition of 307 hectares (ha) of land (HCMC 62 ha and Dong \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nA total of 975 households will be affected, of which 167 are in District 9 of HCMC \nand  808  are  in  the  four  districts  of  Dong  Nai  Province.  Of  the  affected \nhouseholds, 31 in HCMC will lose more than 10% of their productive assets while \nin  Dong  Nai  Province,  392  households  will  lose more  than  10%.  With  regard  to \nrelocation,  309  households  will  have  to  relocate to  new  plots  of  residential  land \nas their land will be totally affected or they will be left with a portion that will no \nlonger  be  viable;  246  households  will  have  remaining  residential  land  and  can \nmove back. \nThree  rubber  plantation  companies,  commune  culverts,  15  irrigation  canals, \nchurch land with a prayer house, and transmission towers (3 tower foundations) \nwill be affected.  \n\n \nLegal and Policy Framework   \n\nC. \n \n3. \nThe legal and policy framework for compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation under \nthe Project is defined by the relevant laws and regulations of the Government and ADB policies. \nIn case of discrepancies between the Borrower\u2019s laws, regulations, and procedures, and ADB's \npolicies and requirements; ADB's policies and requirements will prevail, consistent with Decree \nNo. 131/2006/ND-CP: which provides that in case of \u201cdiscrepancy between any provision in an \ninternational treaty on Official Development Assistance (ODA), to which the Socialist Republic of \nViet  Nam  is  a  signatory,  and  the  Vietnamese  Law,  the  provision  in  the  international  treaty  on \nODA shall take precedence\u201d (Article 2, Item 5). \n \nD. \n \n4. \nA  summary  of  project  entitlements  are  presented  in  Table  A4.1  and  correspond  to  the \nimpacts identified during the census and inventory of losses. Assistance with regard to amount \nof  cash  allowances  or  additional  support  (in  cash  or  in  kind)  will  depend  on  the  severity  of \nimpact  and  the  specific  needs  of  households.  These  entitlements  may  be  enhanced,  as \nnecessary,  following  the  conduct  of  the  detailed  measurement  survey  and  consultation  with \naffected persons to ensure that losses are restored, or the situation is improved. Monitoring will \nbe done regularly and modifications of the program and additional cash and material assistance \nto the affected households will be provided as and when necessary. \n \n\nProject Entitlements   \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\nTable 4.1: Summary Entitlement Matrix \n \n\nEntitlements \nFor legal and legalizable owners of land and those covered by customary \nrights, replacement land or cash compensation at replacement cost (i.e., \ncurrent market value, productive value, and similar location attributes). \nLessees of private land are to cover rent and allocation of suitable \nreplacement land that the lessor can lease.   \nAll owners of structures will be paid based on current market prices of \nmaterials and labor with no depreciation or deductions for salvageable \nmaterials. For poor and vulnerable households with less than the value of \na class-4 house, will be given additional cash assistance to improve the \nnew house to meet the minimum standard house in the area. Landless \nhouseholds will be provided with a plot of land at no cost to the \nhousehold. \nUnharvested crops will be compensated based on current market value; \ntrees will be paid based on type, age, and productive capacity. \nCash compensation to cover the cost of restoring the facilities, including \nirrigation system. Prayer house will be relocated in culturally sensitive and \nappropriate way.  \nIn addition to the compensation for affected land, rehabilitation measures \nwill include taking part in the income restoration programs that will be \ndesigned and implemented in close consultation with the affected \npersons. Various transition allowances will be provided while they are in \nthe process of restoring preproject income (while the affected households \nare taking part in income restoration programs) sufficient to provide the \nminimum basic needs of the households.    \nFor relocating households, various allowance will include materials \ntransport, transition subsistence, and bonus for timely moving. For \nrelocating shops, business disruption allowance will be provided to cover \nincome loss during reestablishment of the business. For employees, cash \nassistance equivalent will be provided to cover loss of salary while \nbusiness is being established.   \nThese persons are entitled to take part in income restoration program and \nwill be provided an additional support allowance while taking part in the \nprogram. Cash allowance for households as per Government regulation \n(social policy households, heroic mothers, wounded, dead soldiers). \n\nImpacts \nPermanent acquisition of \nland  \n\nStructures, crops, and trees \n(irrespective of tenure status) \n\nPublic facilities  \n\nSevere loss of income and/or \nlivelihood due to loss of 10% \nor more of total productive \nland and income sources \n(irrespective of tenure status) \n\nLoss of income and/or \nlivelihood due to relocation of \nhouses and shops \n(irrespective of tenure status) \n\nHigher risks of \nimpoverishment and/or \nhardship due to loss of \nresource base of vulnerable \ngroups regardless of severity \nof impacts \nTemporary impacts \n\nMonthly rent will be paid for use of nonproductive land. If productive land, \nno less than the net income that would have been derived from the \naffected property will be paid. Land will be promptly restored to its \npreproject condition at no cost to the affected household.  \n\nRelocation of Households \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nE. \n \nIn  HCMC,  the  majority  of  affected  households  interviewed  and  participating  in  the \n5. \nmeetings  prefer  to  receive  cash  compensation  at  replacement  cost  and  find  replacement  land \non their own as there is a well developed, active land market in the project area. In Dong Nai \nProvince,  four  relocation  sites  in  four  communes  were  identified  with  sufficient  capacity  to \naccommodate  the  number  of  relocating  households  and  to  respond  to  the  households\u2019 \npreference  to  move  to  relocation  sites.  Local  officials  and  households  that  opted  for  cash \ncompensation  are  optimistic  that  affected  households  opting  to  self-relocate  will  not  have \ndifficulty  finding  a  replacement  for  their  lost  land  as  the  land  market  for  both  productive  and \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n31 \n\nIncome Restoration \n\nParticipation, Disclosure, and Grievance Redress \n\nresidential land is good. Given this, the Project will ensure that compensation given for affected \nland  is  at  replacement  cost  at  the  time  of  disbursement  of  payment.  If  during  updating  of  the \nresettlement  plan,  the  suitability  of  new  or  potential  sites  initially  identified  will  be  reevaluated \nand  included  in  the  updated  resettlement  plan.  Affected  households  will  not  be  displaced  until \nthe commune or ward allocates land acceptable to them and until affected households receive \nall compensation and allowances due to them. \n \nF. \n \n6. \nAs  a  result  of  consultation  with  local  authorities,  various  organizations  and  affected \nhouseholds,  various  farm-  and  nonfarm-based  activities  and  programs  were  identified  for \nconsideration  in  the  planning  of  a  responsive  income  restoration  program.  During  the  detailed \nmeasurement  survey,  the  Project  will  help  design  and  implement  the  income  restoration \nprogram.  It  will  lead  the  process  of  identifying  the  livelihood  activities  of  each  household  by \nevaluating the household\u2019s specific needs against the household\u2019s preferences, inclination, and \npreparedness;  and  assessing  the  availability  of  external  support  needed  by  the  household  to \npursue  its  chosen  livelihood  activities.  In  addition  to  the  principles  governing  the  project \nresettlement  policy,  the  income  restoration  program  will  abide  by  the  following  precepts:  be \nresponsive  to  the  specific  needs  and  attuned  to  the  preparedness  of  the  household;  be \nsustainable  and  geared  toward  self-determination  and  empowerment;  foster  justice  and \nfairness, camaraderie, and social consciousness; and be gender sensitive and environmentally \nsound. Monitoring will be done regularly and the programs modified as necessary. \n \nG. \n \n7. \nConsultations, public meetings, and village discussions with affected persons and local \nofficials were carried out during the resettlement planning process. Project policies and options \nwith regard to relocation and income restoration were discussed during the meetings. Concerns \nand suggestions raised by the affected people were incorporated in the initial resettlement plan. \nThe  grievance  mechanism  is  designed  to  ensure  that  the  concerns  and  grievances  of  those \naffected are addressed and resolved in a timely and satisfactory manner. People affected will be \nmade  fully  aware  of  their  rights  verbally  and  in  writing  during  consultation,  survey,  and  at  the \ntime of compensation. The key information in the initial resettlement plan was disclosed to those \naffected prior to the ADB appraisal mission. \n \nH. \n \n8. \nSeparate  meetings  were  held  with  ethnic  minority  households  and  those  headed  by \nwomen. Members of 11 ethnic minority households were found to have similar living standards \nas  Kinh  people.  The  277  households  headed  by  women  were  consulted  during  the  planning \nprocess.  Specific  actions  for  ethnic  minorities  and  a  gender  strategy  are  included  in  the \nresettlement  plan;  these  include  active  participation  of  women  and  ethnic  minorities  from \nconsultation  to  monitoring,  representation  of  women  and  ethnic  minorities  in  compensation \ncommittees,  capacity-building  targeting  of  women  and  ethnic  minorities,  engagement  of  a \nthe  resettlement  plan,  and \ngender  specialist  during  updating  and \ndevelopment of monitoring indicators by gender and ethnic minority. \n \nI. \n \n9. \nThe  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project  will  be  the  Vietnam  Expressway  Corporation \n(VEC).

SEPMU \nhas  a  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  unit,  headed  by  the  SEPMU  deputy-director.  SEPMU \nhas  assigned  four  staff  to  represent  VEC  on  a  full-time  basis  in  the  district  compensation \ncommittees. In addition, one accountant will be responsible in administering and monitoring loan \nfunds for land acquisition and resettlement.   \n \nJ. \n \n10. \nThe  resettlement  plan  will  be  updated  by  district  following  detailed  design.  All \nresettlement  activities  will  be  coordinated  with  the  civil  works  schedule.  Land  acquisition  and \nrelocation  of  affected  households  cannot  commence  until  ADB  reviews  and  approves  the \nupdated  resettlement  plan.  VEC  will  not  allow  construction  activities  in  specific  sites  until  all \nresettlement activities have been satisfactorily completed, agreed rehabilitation assistance is in \nplace, and the site is free of all encumbrances.

The cost of \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  for  the  entire  Project  will  be  funded  from  the  ADB  loan. \nSecond generation imprest accounts (SGIAs) will be established in HCMC and in each district of \nDong Nai Province at a commercial bank acceptable to the Government and ADB. The SGIAs \nwill  be  operated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007, as  amended \nfrom time to time). Use of the SGIAs will be limited to providing funds for (i) affected persons for \nland and other assets acquired to facilitate the construction of the HLD Expressway; (ii) affected \npersons  for  resettlement  compensation  and  allowances  as  set  out  in  the  approved  updated \nresettlement  plan;  (iii)  relocation  site  development  and  income  restoration  program,  and  \n(iv) incremental expenses incurred by the district compensation committees for implementation \nof the updated resettlement plan. \n \n12. \nVEC  and  compensation  committees,  with  the  help  of  project  consultants,  will  set  up  a \nsystem to ensure that channeling of funds is done transparently, efficiently, and effectively; that \nmonitoring  is  in  place;  and  that  resettlement  audit  reports  are  submitted  in  a  timely  manner. \nADB staff will have the right to conduct spot or random checks of expenditures covered by the \nSGIAs.  Financial  and  audited  statements  will  be  made  available  to  the  external  monitoring \nagency.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nForeign \n  \n\nLocal \n($ thousand) \n  \n\n  \n\n% Foreign \nExchange  Costs \n  \n\n  \n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n \nTable A5.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \n \n\nForeign \n\nLocal  \n(D million) \n\n143,682 \n105,175 \n16,619 \n0 \n190,979 \n0 \n456,455 \n\n6,968,375 \n1,736,717 \n315,752 \n7,426 \n116,431 \n105,561 \n9,250,263 \n\nTotal \n\n7,112,058 \n1,841,891 \n332,370 \n7,426 \n307,410 \n105,561 \n9,706,717 \n\n0 \n456,455 \n\n163,383 \n9,413,645 \n\n163,383 \n9,870,100 \n\n8,980 \n6,573 \n1,039 \n0 \n11,936 \n0 \n28,528 \n  \n0 \n28,528 \n\nTotal \n\n444,504\n115,118\n20,773\n464\n19,213\n6,598\n606,670\n\n10,211\n616,881\n\n435,523\n108,545\n19,734\n464\n7,277\n6,598\n578,141\n \n10,211\n588,353\n\n41,036 \n25,786 \n66,821 \n\n817,428 \n2,308,250 \n3,125,678 \n\n858,464 \n2,334,036 \n3,192,499 \n\n2,565 \n1,612 \n4,176 \n\n51,089\n144,266\n195,355\n\n53,654\n145,877\n199,531\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n\nSubtotal (A) \n  \n\nTotal Base Costs \n  \n\nInvestment Costs \n1.

ADB\u2019s  approval  of  the  evaluation  results  will  be  obtained  before  they  are \ncommunicated to the applicants. For each ICB contract, a full set of bid documents should be \nsubmitted to ADB for review and approval before issuance to bidders.  \n\nCivil Works: National Competitive Bidding \n\n \n2. \nFor  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  contracts  funded  by  ADB,  the  requirements  of \nthe  standard  NCB  Annex  for  Viet  Nam  will  apply.  Documents  will  be  modeled  on  those \ndeveloped  for  NCB  under  previous  ADB-funded  projects.  This  model  is  a  single-stage,  single-\nenvelope  model  with  post  qualification.  The  first  draft  English  language  version  of  the \nprocurement  documents  will  be  submitted  for  ADB  review  and  approval  regardless  of  the \nestimated  contract  amount.  For  subsequent  contracts,  ADB  will  review  the  documents  post \naward. ADB-approved procurement documents will be used as a model for all succeeding NCB \ncontracts financed by ADB for the Project. For all contracts, ADB will review the bid evaluation \nreport and proposal for award of contract on a prior review basis.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nFor ADB-funded contracts, quality-and cost-based selection (QCBS) procedures will be \napplied  except  for  the  project  audit  consultants  who  will  be  recruited  under  consultant\u2019s \nqualification selection (CQS) procedures. Full technical proposals will be required except for the \nproject  audit  services  where  combined  technical  and  financial  proposals  will  be  required.  To \ncalculate the firms\u2019 total scores, the technical proposals will be given a weight of 80% and the \nfinancial proposals 20%. For contracts fully funded by the Government, recruitment documents \nand procedures will follow government guidelines. For the project audit consulting services, the \nshortlist will comprise only national firms. \n \n\nRecruitment of Consultants  \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTANTS \n\n \n\nA. \n\nProject Supervision Consultant \n\n \n1. \nTo  assist  in  implementing  the  Ho  Chi  Minh\u2013Long  Thanh\u2013Dau  Giay  (HLD)  Expressway \nConstruction Project, the proceeds of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan will be applied to \neligible payments for a single construction supervision consulting services contract: the project \nsupervision  consultant  (PSC).  The  consulting  services  will  be  undertaken  by  an  international \nconsulting  firm  with  associated  national  consulting  firms.  About  1,687  person-months  (171 \nperson-months of international and 1,516 person-months of national consulting services) will be \nrequired.  \n \n2. \nADB  and  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  are  cofinancing  the \nconstruction  of  the  HLD  expressway.  A  separate  consultant  will  be  engaged  to  supervise \nconstruction of the JBIC-financed component.

This additional capacity can \nbe  provided  by  either  widening  existing  highways  or  constructing  a  new  facility.  The  existing \nroute follows National Highway (QL) 1 from District 9, in the center of HCMC, through the city of \nBien  Hoa  and  to  the  north  via  Dau  Giay.  Land  use  along  most  of  this  route  comprises  dense \ndevelopments  of  mixed  residential  and  commercial  use,  while  in  Bien  Hoa  the  route  passes \nlarge  industrial  parks.  Widening  the  existing  highway  would  require  large-scale  clearance  of \nexisting structures that would be socially unacceptable and very expensive, given that much of \nthe developments are in what are considered to be prime locations. Due to the magnitude of the \nsocial impacts alone, widening the existing highway is not feasible, and any increase in highway \ncapacity  must  be  provided  by  constructing  a  new  facility.  The  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance  considered  various  mutually  exclusive  project  alternatives  such  as  different \npavement  types,  horizontal  and  vertical  road  alignments,  alternative  bridge  designs,  culverts, \nunderpasses,  and  overpasses.  The  Ho  Chi  Minh  City\u2013Long  Thanh\u2013Dau  Giay  Expressway \nConstruction Project is based on the most cost-effective and least-cost option of those that are \ntechnically feasible, and socially and environmentally acceptable. \n \nB. \n \nThe Project will serve as a new link between HCMC and Dau Giay, and provide access \n2. \nto the proposed Long Thanh international airport. The Project will provide a shorter route for the \nexisting  HCMC\u2013Bien  Hua\u2013Long  Thanh  and  Long  Thanh\u2013Bien  Hua\u2013Dau  Giay  routes.  The \nProject\u2019s traffic demand was forecast for 25 years for without-project and with-project scenarios. \nBaseline  routine  traffic  counts  were  determined  at  three  locations  (HCMC,  Long  Thanh,  and \nDau Giay) along the proposed project route. Roadside interviews were undertaken at two sites \nfor  origin\u2013destination  and  willingness-to-pay  surveys.  The  origin\u2013destination  survey  found  that \n50%\u201380% of users of the existing roads would use the expressway if no toll was applied. For \nthe  with-project  scenario,  an  expressway  toll  rate  of  D900  per  passenger  car  unit per  km  was \nassumed, giving the highest revenue over the appraisal period. Trip assignment was carried out \nby  allocating  interzonal  trips  to  various  travel  routes  within  the  road  network.  The  routes  were \nselected according to the lowest travel cost, comprising travel time, vehicle operating cost, and \nthe project expressway toll. The willingness-to-pay survey showed that 53% of those who would \nuse  the  expressway  with  a  zero  toll  would  still  use  the  expressway  at  a  toll  rate  of  D900  per \npassenger car unit per km. As a result, about 30%\u201340% of the traffic on the parallel highways \n(QL1 and 51) would divert to the project expressway. \n \n3. \nTraffic  demand  was  projected  by  taking  into  account  expected  increases  in  the  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) and estimated elasticity of passenger and freight transport with respect \nto GDP growth. The GDP growth rates were projected to be 10% for 2007\u20132010, 8% for 2011\u2013\n2020,  and  6%  for  2021\u20132030.  Demand  elasticity  for  passenger  and  freight  traffic to  GDP  was \nestimated  based  on  a  regression  analysis  for  the  three  provinces  nearest  the  Project.  An \nallowance was made in the risk analysis (para. 8) for variations of traffic growth to take account \nof possible variations in the values of the elasticity of demand selected. Given this, the values \nadopted for elasticity of demand are considered appropriate. The traffic demand of the proposed \nLong Thanh international airport, starting operation in 2015, was incorporated into the forecasts. \nThe new airport will handle all international passengers in southern Viet Nam and about 10% of \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\nYear \n\nCar \n\n \nHCMC\u2013Long Thanh \n \n2013 \n2020 \n2025 \n2030 \n \n\n3,913 \n7,250 \n10,022 \n10,110 \n\n \n\n \nLong Thanh\u2013Dau Giay \n \n\n \n2013 \n2020 \n2025 \n2030 \n \n\n1,874 \n3,406 \n4,746 \n6,293 \n\n \n\n \n\ndomestic passengers.

The financial costs were \nrevalued at economic prices by separating the cost items into tradable and nontradable goods \nand services. The tradable goods and services were converted to the domestic price numeraire \nusing a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.04. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.55 was used to \nconvert the financial wage rate for unskilled labor to an economic opportunity cost of labor.   \n \n5. \nThe economic benefits include savings in vehicle operating cost (VOC), passenger time \nsavings on the project expressway, and passenger time savings on the existing road network of \nthe  project area.  Reduced  VOC  is  the  main  source  of  economic  benefits  for  the  Project.  VOC \nwas calculated for eight vehicle types using the Highway Development and Management Model \n4 (HDM-4), taking into account the differences of terrain, road alignment, road roughness, and \ntravel  speed.  Traffic  diverting  from  existing  roads  to  the  project  expressway  would  travel  at \nfaster  speeds  on  a  smoother  road  surface,  with  better  vertical  and  horizontal  alignment,  less \ncongestion, and a shorter journey distance. Traffic remaining on the existing road network will \nbenefit  from  a  reduction  in  traffic  volume  and  congestion.  All  these  changes  affect  vehicle \nspeeds  and  VOC  for  all  vehicle  types.  Savings  in  travel  time  will  occur  on  the  project \nexpressway  and  the  existing  road  network.  After  completion  of  the  Project,  the  travel  time \nbetween Dau Giay and HCMC is expected to be 0.65 hours\u2014a reduction of about 1.0 hour. The \nvalues of travel time savings (Table A11.2) were used to estimate the benefit of reduced travel \ntimes. Work-related travel time, which accounts for 30% of total travel time, was evaluated for \npassenger cars and motorcycles, and 25% of total travel time was evaluated as work-related for \nthe buses. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.55 was applied to unskilled labor. Non-work-related \ntrips were estimated at 30% of the value of work-related trips. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n47 \n\n \nTable A11.2: Value of Travel Time \n \n\nItem \n\nMotorcycle\n\nCar \n\n \nAverage passenger time cost ($/hour) \nPassenger occupancy (number) \nTotal passenger time cost ($/hour) \nSources: Vietnam Expressway Corporation and Asian Development Bank estimates \n\n \n0.75\n3.00\n1.72\n\n \n0.22 \n2.00 \n0.37 \n\nSmall \nBus \n \n0.22 \n    10.00 \n1.47 \n\nLarge \nBus \n \n0.22 \n   28.00 \n4.11 \n\nProject Economic Internal Rate of Return \n\n \nD. \n \nThe  economic  analysis  covers  25  years  including  5  years  of  implementation  and  20 \n6. \nyears  of  operations.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was  estimated  by  comparing \nthe  with-project  and  without-project  scenarios  for  the  road  network  in  eastern  HCMC.  Without \nthe Project, traffic will use the existing road network, which will be congested and expensive to \nmaintain because of rapidly increasing traffic. With the Project, the congestion on existing roads \nwill be reduced, and traffic on the project expressway and existing roads will benefit from faster \ntravel. The Project yields an EIRR of 15.5% for the base-case scenario, indicating the Project is \neconomically viable (Table A11.3). The distribution analysis shows that road users will receive \nthe largest share of net project benefits, accounting for 95% of the total net benefits. \n \n\nTable A11.3: Economic Internal Rate of Return \n(constant 2007 economic prices, domestic price numeraire, $ million)  \n\n \n\nCosts \n\nCapital \n\nO&M \n\nTotal \n\nTotal \n\nNet \nBenefits \n\n \n4.3  \n355.0  \n107.3  \n107.3  \n107.3  \n\n  \n\n \nYear \n  \n\n \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nBenefits \nNormal and \nDiverted Traffic \nTime \nVOC \nSavings\nSavings\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n15.1  \n67.6  \n99.1  \n96.4  \n93.4  \n99.2  \n105.6  \n112.4  \n111.3  \n114.0  \n119.6  \n124.4  \n150.5  \n175.4  \n201.1  \n\n13.7  \n28.0  \n39.4  \n37.6  \n41.3  \n45.4  \n50.1  \n56.1  \n61.4  \n67.0  \n73.0  \n79.1  \n85.3  \n87.8  \n90.5  \n\n28.8  \n95.6  \n 138.5  \n134.1  \n134.7  \n144.6  \n155.7  \n168.5  \n172.7  \n181.0  \n192.7  \n 203.6  \n235.9  \n263.2  \n291.5  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n0.6  \n0.6  \n0.7  \n0.7  \n0.8  \n 0.7  \n0.9  \n6.1  \n1.1  \n1.2  \n1.3  \n1.4  \n1.4  \n1.4  \n1.7  \n\n \n4.3  \n355.0  \n107.3  \n107.3  \n107.3  \n0.6  \n0.6  \n0.7  \n0.7  \n0.8  \n0.7  \n0.9  \n6.1  \n1.1  \n1.2  \n1.3  \n1.4  \n1.4  \n1.4  \n1.7  \n\n \n(4.3) \n(355.0) \n(107.3) \n(107.3) \n(107.3) \n28.2  \n95.0  \n137.8  \n133.3  \n133.9  \n143.9  \n154.8  \n162.5  \n171.6  \n179.8  \n191.4  \n202.2  \n234.4  \n261.8  \n289.9  \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\n  \n\n \nYear \n  \n\n2028 \n2029 \n2030 \n2031 \n2032 \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n  \n\nCosts \n\nCapital \n\nO&M \n\nTotal \n\n6.9  \n2.0  \n 2.1  \n2.1  \n2.1  \n\n \n  \n\n6.9  \n2.0  \n2.1  \n2.1  \n(406.6) \n \n  \n\n(408.7) \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nBenefits \nNormal and \nDiverted Traffic \nTime \nVOC \nSavings\nSavings\n94.1  \n229.6  \n260.5  \n98.2  \n126.2  \n326.6  \n126.2  \n326.6  \n126.2  \n326.6  \n\nTotal \n\n323.7  \n358.7  \n452.8  \n452.8  \n452.8  \n\nEconomic Net Present Value = $ \nEconomic Internal Rate of Return =   \n\nNet \nBenefits \n\n316.8  \n356.8  \n450.6  \n450.6  \n859.4  \n248.6  \n\n15.6% \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\n( ) = negative, O&M = operation and maintenance, VOC = vehicle operating cost. \nSources: Vietnam Expressway Corporation and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n  \n \nE. \n \nSensitivity  analysis  was  undertaken  for  key  risk  factors  and  assumptions  that  could \n7. \ninfluence the Project\u2019s viability.

The FIRR analysis assesses the project \nreturn,  comparing  it  to  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC).  The  analysis  of  the \nfinancial  statements  focuses  on  the  Project\u2019s  debt  service  repayment  capacity  and  capital \nstructure. The financial analysis examines the aggregated costs and benefits from toll revenues \nof  the  Ho  Chi  Minh  City\u2013Long  Thanh\u2013Dau  Giay  Expressway.  The  FIRR  of  the  Project  is \ncalculated  for  2008\u20132033  using  constant  2007  prices.  The  projected  financial  statements  are \nprepared in current terms, over the same period. The foreign inflation rate was assumed to be \n0.8%, and the local inflation rate 18.3% for 2008, 10.2% for 2009, 6.5% for 2010, 4% for 2011, \nand  5.0%  for  2012  onward  during  the  projection  period.  The  foreign  exchange  rate  used  for \n2008 is D16,000 to $1. \n \nA. \n \nAssumptions.  The  main  project  costs  are  capital  investment  and  operation  and \n2. \nmaintenance  (O&M)  costs.  The  capital  costs  for  the  highway  include  civil  works  such  as \nearthwork,  pavement  and  bridges,  and  land  acquisition  costs.  The  O&M  costs  include  annual \nexpenses incurred in operating the highway. All capital costs are expressed in real terms using \nconstant 2007 prices. The FIRR was calculated on the basis of the base costs, excluding price \ncontingency and financial charges during implementation. \n \n3. \nThe  financial  benefits  for  the  Project  are  measured  by  the  operating  revenue  from  toll \ncollection  by  users.  The  revenues  are  projected  based  on  the  forecast  of  future  traffic  and  a \nbase  toll  rate  of  D900  per  passenger  car  unit  per  kilometer  (km).  Tolls  to  be  applied  to  the \noperation to the Project are in constant 2007 prices. \n \nWACC.  The  FIRR  was  compared  with  the  WACC  of  1.1%  (Table  A12.1).  The  WACC, \n4. \nafter-tax,  in  real  terms  was  calculated  using  estimated  capital  mix  and  costs  of  funds.  The \nassumptions are as follows: (i) the applicable 5-year swap rate plus a provision for ADB\u2019s spread \nof  0.2%  and  onlending  premium  of  0.2%  are  used  for  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  debt;  \n(ii)  for  the  loan  financed  by  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC),  1.2%  for \nconstruction and 0.01% for consulting service plus onlending premium of 0.2%; and (iii) the cost \nof counterpart funding is assumed to be 10.5%, which is the estimated interest of government-\nguaranteed bonds. The cost of debt is adjusted to reflect the impact of income tax of 28%. The \nnominal  cost  of  debt  is  converted  to  the  real  cost  of  debt  by  applying  the  average  domestic \ninflation rate for domestic debt, and the average international inflation rate for foreign-currency-\ndenominated debt. \n \nFIRR. The FIRR for the Project, computed on an after-tax basis, is 4.0%. This exceeds \n5. \nthe WACC of 1.1%. The results of sensitivity tests are shown in Table A12.2. The FIRR exceeds \nthe WACC for each sensitivity scenario. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n\n \n\nItem \n\nTable A12.1.

The financial projections are presented in current price terms, which take \ninto  account  the  potential  impact  of  domestic  and  foreign  inflation.  The  assumption  of  the \ndomestic and international inflation rates is described in paragraph 1. Depreciation of the dong \nagainst the dollar is assumed to be 1.3% per annum, based on the historical trend of the past  \n5 years. Toll rates will be adjusted to account for domestic inflation; there will be no real increase \nin  toll  rates  over  the  project  life  span.  A  corporate  tax  rate  of  28%  is  assumed,  in  line  with \ncorporate  tax  laws,  which  allows  for  the  following:  (i)  in  the  first  2  years  of  profit-making \noperations,  Vietnam  Expressway  Corporation  (VEC)  is  tax  exempt;  (ii)  in  the  following  3  profit-\nmaking  years  of  operations  VEC  will  pay  50%  of  the  20%  corporate  tax;  (iii)  in  next  10  years \nVEC will pay 20%; and (iv) in years thereafter, VEC will pay the full 28% corporate tax. The 10% \nvalue-added tax is included in the toll rate. \n \n8. \nThe  projected  O&M  costs,  comprising  annual  routine  costs  and  periodic  road \nmaintenance costs, are based on the results of engineering studies. The annual O&M costs are \napproximately  $0.6  million  at  2007  prices.  The  cost  of  periodic  maintenance  to  overlay  the \nhighway  is  assumed  to  be  $6  million  every  8  years  starting  in  2020.  These  O&M  costs  are \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n51 \n\nassumed  to  increase  in  accordance  with  the  domestic  inflation  rate  of  5%  per  annum.  A \ndepreciation period of 40 years is assumed, which reflects the current depreciation regulation. \n \n9. \nFinancing Plan. The project cost will be funded by ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, the \nJBIC  loan,  and  government  counterpart  funds  (Table  A12.3).  For  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources and the JBIC loan, VEC will borrow the funds from the Ministry of Finance based on \nsubsidiary  loan  agreements.  VEC  plans  to  borrow  in  Vietnamese  dong,  and  will  pay  an \nonlending  premium  of  0.2%  per  annum  in  addition  to  the  interest  rate  for  ADB  loans.  The \ncounterpart funds will be provided from VEC\u2019s own internal source. \n\n \nTable A12.3.

The  financial  projections  show  that  the  accumulated  net  cash \nflow remains positive (Table A12.4), which means that VEC will not require subsidies throughout \nthe  operation  period.  As  explained  in  para.  5,  since  the  amount  of  the  counterpart  funds  from \nVEC will be only 0.6% of the total project cost, the initial debt\u2013equity ratio for the Project is about \n98:1  in  2013.  However,  in  2022,  or  after  10  years  of  operation,  the  ratio  will  be  improved  to \n75:25 because of increasing toll revenue. Although the Project will have a debt service coverage \nratio of less than 1.0 in 2020 because of periodic maintenance, it will achieve a sufficient debt \nservice coverage ratio of more than 1.2, except in 2020, and maintain enough accumulated cash \nflow to cover the debt service. Therefore, the Project\u2019s debt service capacity is considered to be \nsufficient and sustainable. \n \n\nTable A12.4.

VEC does  not yet own its expressway assets and is in the \nprocess  of  developing  three  expressway  projects.  Institutional  and  financial  management \nanalyses  of  VEC  were  conducted  to  monitor  its  financial  management  capacity.  Financial \nanalysis  of  VEC  was  assessed  from  VEC\u2019s  consolidated  projected  financial  statements  for \n2008\u20132025. \n \nA. \n \nVEC  was established as a state-owned company on 6  October 2004 by the  Ministry of \n2. \nTransport  Decision  No.  3033.  VEC\u2019s  operation  is  mainly  governed  by  two  important  legal \ndocuments:  its  corporate  charter,  promulgated  by  Ministry  of  Transport  Decision  No. 3466,  \n12  November  2004;  and  the  Law  on  State  Enterprise.  Pursuant  to  Decision  No. 3033,  VEC\u2019s \nmain activities include (i) investing in expressway construction, management, and maintenance; \nand organizing toll collection on national highways; (ii) investing in construction of other transport \ninfrastructure  in  all  modes;  (iii)  managing  and  operating  services  adjacent  to  its  expressways, \nsuch as motels, restaurants, advertisements, and construction materials; (iv) providing technical \nconsulting  services  in  the  transport  sector,  research  and  development  of  national  highway \nsystems, and design and supervision of transport facility works; and (v) providing research and \ndevelopment of services in areas adjacent to expressways. In accordance with Article 166 of the \nLaw  on  Enterprises,  VEC  will  be  converted  from  a  state-owned  company  to  either  a  limited \nliability company or a shareholding company no later than 1 July 2010. \n \n3. \nVEC\u2019s operations are divided into five functional divisions and three project management \nunits.  VEC  currently  has  120  employees.  VEC\u2019s  organization  structure  was  established  in \naccordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Law  on  State  Enterprises  and  includes  (i)  management \nboard  and  internal  audit  unit,  (ii)  management,  and  (iii)  eight  operation  departments  including \nthree project management units. The organization structure is given in Figure A13. \n \nThe finance and accounting department is responsible for funds and asset management, \n4. \nand implementation of financial accounting and bookkeeping. VEC has issued audited financial \nstatements for 2004, 2005, and 2006. The financial statements are prepared in accordance with \nthe  Vietnamese  accounting  system  issued  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  The  reports  include  a \nbalance  sheet,  profit  and  loss  report,  and  cash-flow  statement.  They  are  prepared  by \naccountants using a computerized accounting system connected to all transactions in an online \ngeneral ledger. The reports are reviewed by an internal auditing control board, and audited by \nan independent external auditor annually. An external auditor has reviewed the audited financial \nstatements  of  past  years  and  rated  them  satisfactory  with  unqualified  opinion.  The  financial \nmanagement  system  and  VEC  staff  are  considered  adequate  for  accounting  purposes. \nHowever,  VEC  should  develop  its  own  financial  information  system  to  make  a  financially \nsustainable  expressway  investment  plan  that  takes  into  account  monitoring  and  planning  cost-\nfinancial  statements,  and \ntraffic  volume,  making  projected \nrecovery \ndeveloping  a  debt-management  strategy.

Therefore,  VEC  will  begin  generating  toll \nrevenues  from  2011.  Financial  statements  of  fiscal  year  2006  show  the  company\u2019s  modest \nprofitability  of  $3  million;  this  income  came  from  interest  earned  from  deposits,  not  from  toll \nrevenue. VEC\u2019s charter capital is D1,000 billion, or about $62 million. \n \nFinancial  Projections: The financial analysis of VEC is carried out in current terms on \n6. \nan  after-tax  basis.  VEC\u2019s  projected  financial  statements  are  prepared  by  consolidating  VEC\u2019s \ncurrent assets and the three expressway projects that are currently under construction or at the \ndetailed feasibility study stage: (i) the Cau Gie\u2013Ninh Binh Expressway (50 km, currently under \nconstruction);  (ii)  the  Noi  Bai\u2013Lao  Cai  Expressway  (244  km);  and  (iii)  Ho  Chi  Minh  City\u2013Long \nThanh\u2013Dau  Giay  Expressway  (55  km).  Total  capital  expenditures  on  the  three  projects  will \nexceed $2.5 billion. The financial projections assume that VEC will charge D900 per passenger \ncar unit per km for the Ho Chi Minh City\u2013Long Thanh\u2013Dau Giay Expressway (the Project), and \nthat the toll rate will be adjusted to account for inflation. Other assumptions, such as corporate \ntaxes,  value-added  taxes,  depreciation,  and  international  and  local  inflation  rates,  reflect  the \nassumptions used in Appendix 12. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n55 \n\n \n7. \nResults: The financial projections of VEC and the key financial ratios are shown in Table \nA13. VEC will have net operating losses until 2016 because the toll revenue is not sufficient to \ncover depreciation costs and interest in the initial operation stage. However, VEC can maintain \npositive  accumulated  cash  flow  throughout  the  operating  period  to  cover  debt  services.  Gross \nrevenue  will  increase  to  generate  net  operating  profit  from  2017  with  the  gradual  increase  of \ntraffic volume. The debt\u2013equity ratio will be 95:5 in 2013, and improve to 77:23 in 2022 because \nof  increased  retained  earnings.  Despite  its  large-scale  investment  plan,  VEC  will  maintain  its \nfinancial viability in the medium and longer term without additional subsidies during operations. \n \n\nTable A13: Financial Projections of Vietnam Electricity Corporation (2013\u20132025) \n($ million) \n \n\nItem \n\n2013 \n\n2015 \n\n2018 \n\n2020 \n\n2022 \n\n2025 \n\nGross Revenue \nDepreciation \nInterest \nNet Operating Profit / (Loss) \nAccumulated Cashflow \nTotal Assets \nDebt \nNet Equity \nCash Available for Debt Service \nDebt Service \nDebt Service Coverage Ratio (%) \nDebt to Total Assets \n( ) = negative, \u2014 = not applicable. \nSources: Vietnam Expressway Corporation and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n343.5 \n57.2 \n124.3 \n105.8 \n393.7 \n2,516.3 \n2,234.2 \n282.1 \n243.4 \n209.4 \n1.16 \n0.89 \n\n152.1 \n57.2 \n123.3 \n(49.5)\n173.8 \n2,564.0 \n2,513.7 \n50.3 \n137.9 \n132.3 \n 1.04\n0.98\n\n276.8 \n57.2 \n126.6 \n63.4 \n308.6 \n2,545.7 \n2,416.0 \n129.7 \n212.2 \n184.5 \n1.15\n0.95\n\n120.4 \n57.2 \n46.4 \n(0.9)\n120.5 \n2,557.3 \n2,441.4 \n115.9 \n107.6 \n1.1 \n\u2014 \n0.95\n\n496.6 \n57.3 \n115.9 \n222.8 \n627.1 \n2,638.6 \n2,025.5 \n613.2 \n311.9 \n212.6 \n\n1.47 \n0.77 \n\n635.7 \n57.3 \n71.9 \n361.7 \n991.1 \n2,830.7 \n1,343.1 \n1,487.6 \n381.7 \n221.2 \n1.73 \n0.47 \n\n \n \nProposed  Financial  Covenants.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nViet Nam\u2019s record in poverty reduction has been impressive in the last decade. The proportion of the population living below \nthe  poverty  line  has  declined  from  around  59%  in  1993  to  25%  in  2005.  The  proposed  target  for  the  Five-Year  Socio-\nEconomic  Development  Plan  2006\u20132010  is  to  reduce  the  percentage  of  poor  households  to  15%\u201316%  by  2010.  While \nsignificant  in  terms  of  magnitude,  progress  in  poverty  reduction  remains  fragile,  with  a  significant  number  of  \u201cnear  poor\u201d \nclustered  just  above  the  poverty  line.  Sustained  development  requires  modernization  and  improvement  of  physical \ninfrastructure and associated services.  \nTo support the Government in pursuing balanced economic growth and poverty reduction, the Country Strategy and Program \nUpdate  2006\u20132008  for  Viet  Nam  and  the  Poverty  Partnership  Agreement  between  Viet  Nam  and  the  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB) emphasize trade and access to markets within the country and the region. In the recent years the Southern Focal \nEconomic  Zone  (SFEZ)  has  made  a  great  contribution  to  economic  development  in  Viet  Nam.  The  country  is  experiencing \nrapid economic growth, centered on exports to world markets; and through increasingly bilateral trade in agriculture, aquatic, \nmining, and industrial products. Sustained development requires improved infrastructure that accommodates trade within the \ncountry and bilateral trade.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                          Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \n  \nIn the SFEZ, the Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC)\u2013Long Thanh\u2013Dau Giay Expressway (HLD expressway) will be an essential trunk \nroad  for  the  highway  network.  The  general  area  that  will  be  served  will  include  the  provinces  in  the  SFEZ,  Mekong  Delta, \nhighlands,  and  south  central  Coast.  The  expressway  will  provide  a  connection  to  the  proposed  Long  Thanh  international \nairport for HCMC, which will serve international and national traffic. Expressways are intended to serve long distance traffic; \nthey do not necessarily benefit people who are local to the expressway. Even though expressways generally do not directly \naddress local poverty they do address it indirectly by facilitating continued economic growth. The proposed HLD expressway \nis  located  in  HCMC  and  Dong  Nai  Province,  one  of  the  least  poor  provinces  with  a  poverty  rate  of  10.33%  (Viet  Nam \nHousehold  Living  Standard  Survey  2002).  Given  the  low  rate  of  poverty  in  the  project  area,  and  that  the  expressway  is \nintended to serve long distance traffic, the Project will have very limited impact on poverty reduction in the project locations.  \nHowever, improved transport infrastructure is critical for sustained rapid economic growth and overall poverty reduction, and \ncan  contribute  to  regionally  balanced  and  equitable  economic  growth  by  stimulating  agriculture  production,  and  increasing \naccess to employment opportunities. Remoteness and disconnection are often identified as factors for poor people\u2019s inability \nto benefit from economic growth. Road connectivity under the Project might contribute to local people\u2019s ability to benefit from \neconomic growth in the long run. The Project is classified as GI based on these reasons. \n \n2. Design Features.  \n \nThe  Project  does  not  include  pro-poor  design  except  for  the  potential  for  daily  wage  employment  generation  for  the  poor \nduring construction.   \n \nC.   Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.   Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nKey Issues.  \nThe 51-kilometer HLD expressway is located within the main engine of economic growth in Viet Nam. The establishment of \nexpressway will contribute to an improved transport system and support economic development of the area. The expressway \nwill  benefit major business centers in the south of Viet Nam, including: HCMC, Ba Ria,  Vung Tau, and Dong Nai Province. \n\nNot Applicable.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n57 \n\nThe primary  beneficiaries of  the Project include  large investors, traders, and vehicle  operators. The expressway  will benefit \nbusiness  and  investors  by  reducing  transport  costs  and  reducing  travel  time  for  the  transportation  of  goods  and  materials. \nWith  increased  investment  in  the  SFEZ  this  will  create  employment  opportunities  for  skilled  and  unskilled  labor.  During \nconstruction  the  demand  for  unskilled  labor  will  increase  and  both  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  will  benefit  from  increased \naccess to the labor market. The socioeconomic profile of the Project shows that 27% of the population is between 18 and 35 \nyears  of  age;  they  will  benefit  from  better  access  to  the  labor  market.  The  socioeconomic  profile  of  the  Project  districts \nindicates  that  35%  of  households  own  small  businesses.  They  are  less  likely  to  benefit  from  the  expressway  since  the \nexpressway will be more cost-effective for transport of large quantities of goods. Most people in the project area do no travel \nlong  distances  to  their  place  of  work;  therefore,  the  expressway  will  only  generate  limited  benefits  in  terms  of  easier \ncommuting to work for the local people.  \n \nThe main social and livelihood impacts of the Project are related to resettlement and relocation, HIV, human trafficking, and \nroad  safety.  During  construction  an  additional  impact  for  local  residents  may  be  increased  dust  and  noise  pollution. \nConstruction  of  the  expressway  may  lead  to  an  increase  in  land  prices  in  the  project  area.  This  may  attract  outsiders  to \npurchase  land  for  residential  and  business  purposes  resulting  in  a  change  in  the  social  nature  and  demographics  of  the \nproject districts. Of the 957 households that will be directly affected by expressway construction, about 30% will be relocated. \nRelocation  and  livelihood  restoration  are  the  key  issues  in  terms  of  the  social  impact  of  the  Project.  The  resettlement  plan \naddresses the relocation and livelihood impact of the Project.  \n \nThe expressway will increase the risk of exposure to HIV and the trafficking of women and children during construction and \npostconstruction  phase  due  to  increased  transit  traffic  along  the  highway.  In  2003,  HCMC  had  the  greatest  number  of  HIV \ninfected people, accounting for a fourth of all infections in the country. The city has the fastest growing epidemic in the country \nwith HIV prevalence among adults aged 15\u201329 estimated to be about 1.2. The number of infected females relative to males is \nincreasing each year, indicating increasing heterosexual transmission. The influx of construction workers in the Project during \nthe construction phase and increased volume of transit traffic in the postconstruction period will increase the risk of HIV and \nhuman trafficking. With improved transportation and infrastructure, existing risks and vulnerabilities for HIV transmission, drug \nuse, and trafficking along the highway will significantly increase if targeted risk mitigation initiatives are not implemented. Data \nfrom  social  assessments  show  that  53%  of  the  households  in  the  project  area  have  had  some  HIV  awareness  training  or \npromotional activities on HIV. However, awareness about trafficking issues is much lower among surveyed households than \nfor HIV. Reports from nongovernment organizations and aid organizations indicate that a high rate of human trafficking in the \nsouth. To mitigate these risks, a HIV awareness and prevention of human trafficking component is included in the Project to \nminimize exposure of the local population to these issues. The program includes capacity building of the Executing Agency; \nawareness  campaigns  in  construction  camps,  and  communities  in  the  project  districts;  development  of  peer  educators;  and \ncommunity  monitoring  distribution  of  medical  equipment  to  relevant  health  facilities.  The  program  includes  community \nawareness programs on human trafficking, safe migration, and community monitoring. \n \nA  road  safety  awareness  program  is  included  in  the  Project  to  address  the  need  for  behavioral  change  on  the  part  of  road \nusers  when  the  expressway  opens.  The  environment  management  plan  includes  measures  to  address  dust  and  pollution \nrelated issues. \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nConsultation meetings were held with project affected people to discuss the impact of the Project in terms of resettlement and \nenvironmental impacts. Meetings were held in all of the communes within the project area and the results of these meetings \nwere incorporated into the project resettlement plan, environmental impact assessment, and EMP. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\nDuring project construction, consultation will mainly relate to the preparation and implementation of the updated resettlement \nplan. A series of consultations with affected people will be held during the detailed measurement survey and updating of the \nresettlement plan.  \n \nTo minimize the risk of the expressway dividing local communities by disrupting existing local road communications, options \nfor including underpasses, overpasses, and frontage roads will be discussed with local communities during the early stages of \ndetailed  engineering  design.  The  communities  will  be  consulted  to  determine  the  maximum  distance  between  facilities  to \ncross the expressway, by either overpasses or underpasses, so that livelihood and social networks and the existing local road \nsystem are not significantly disrupted. Community consultations will be facilitated by social development specialists engaged \nas part of the construction supervision consultant\u2019s team.  \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nA separate C&P plan is not required. Consultation and participatory processes have been mainstreamed in relevant project \ncomponents and documents such as the resettlement plan, environmental impact assessment, gender strategy, and program \nfor the prevention of HIV and human trafficking. The resettlement plan and environmental impact assessment report include \nappendixes on the consultation process.  \n \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues. \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  transportation  system  and  facilitate  economic  development.  In  terms  of  gender,  the  Project \nimpacts  relate  to  (i)  increased  risks  of  exposure  to  HIV  and  trafficking  of  women  and  children  during  construction  and \npostconstruction  phase  due  to  the  large  volume  of  transit  traffic  along  the  road;  (ii)  poor  women  in  the  project  area  at  risk \neconomically  (loss  of  productive  asset  due  to  land  acquisition)  and  socially  (risks  posed  by  HIV,  road  safety,  and  possible \nhuman trafficking) than males. However, the Project will create employment opportunities for poor women during construction. \nIn addition, in the long run the increased investments in the SFEZ will create demand for both skilled and unskilled labor. An \nincrease in labor market demand will have an impact on employment opportunities for women. However, the employment in \nthe  factories  in  the  economic  zone  can  have  both  positive  and  negative  impacts.  The  women  migrant  workers  might  face \nexploitative  working conditions  with low  wages in the SFEZ. In addition, women migrant  workers could be deceived  and be \ntrafficked  to  the  SFEZ.  Measures  to  address  the  potential  negative  impacts  of  women  migrant  workers  in  the  SFEZ  are \noutside  the  project  scope.  The  potential  negative  impacts  relating  to  resettlement,  HIV,  and  human  trafficking  will  be \naddressed  through  the  gender  strategy  in  the  resettlement  plan  and  HIV  awareness  and  prevention  of  human  trafficking \nprogram. \n \n2.  Key Actions. \n \nA  project-specific  gender  strategy  is  been  prepared  and  included  in  the  resettlement  plan,  the  HIV  and  human  trafficking \nawareness program includes action targeted at women. The following are the key features of the gender strategy.  \n \nThe gender strategy includes specific activities to ensure that project benefits will accrue to women. The project area includes \na small number of households from ethnic minorities who are generally well-integrated into mainstream society. However, as \nappropriate, representatives of women from these ethnic minorities will be included in all meetings and discussions. \n \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\n  Gender plan      \n\n- \n\n- \n\n- \n\n- \n\n- \n\n- \n\n- \n\n- \n\n- \n\nconsultation meetings on resettlement activities will be held separately with women, households headed by women, \nand elderly women;  \nthe  district  resettlement  committees  will  include  representatives  from  district  women\u2019s  unions,  and  women  from \naffected households;   \nat project inception, a capacity-building training program on resettlement activities will be designed for both women \nand  men  commune  officials,  and  women  and  men  from  affected  households  to  orient  them  about  resettlement \nactivities; participation of poor women, and households headed by women in the training will be ensured; the training \nwill  include  representatives  from  the  Executing  Agency,  women\u2019s  unions,  and  youth  unions  will  be  involved  in \nresettlement committees;   \nthe training will include information on resettlement activities, compensation, management of compensation money, \ngrievance procedures, and impacts of the Project on livelihood activities related to loss of agricultural produce and \nother  productive  assets;  the  objective  of  the  training  is  to  provide  affected  communities  with  an  understanding  of \nresettlement issues, better access to compensation resources, and information on grievance procedures;  \nthe capacity-building training on resettlement issues will be conducted separately for women, including households \nheaded by women;   \nduring  preparation  of  the  detailed  measurement  survey,  men  and  women  from  the  households  will  participate  in \ndiscussions of detailed measurement survey activities; \nlivelihood  activities  will  be  planned  with  active  involvement  of  women;  needs  assessments  for  livelihood  activities \nand  skill  development  of  livelihood  activities  will  be  conducted  separately  for  women,  poor  women,  households \nheaded by women, and elderly women;  \nmonetary  compensation  will  be  given  to  both  men  and  women  from  the  households;  specific  attention  will  be \nprovided for poor  women, households  headed by  women,  and elderly  women in paying  the compensation on time \nand developing relevant livelihood activities;   \nthe resettlement plan will include joint registration of land rights in the names of husband and wife in instances where \nland is acquired;  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n59 \n\nrelocation  of  houses  in  the  resettlement  sites  will  include  separate  discussions  with  women  from  affected  persons \nhouseholds, households headed by women, and elderly women that include the selection of sites, housing structure, \nand other social infrastructure; \nspecial measures will be taken in the relocation of elderly, disabled, and households headed by women in terms of \nlocation of houses together  with their extended families/relatives; elderly  and disabled  women and men  will not be \nallocated  to  apartments  so  that  they  do  not  have  to  climb  stairs;  compensation  and  housing  options  must  be \nprovided according to their choice;   \nan HIV and human trafficking awareness campaign will be conducted during construction by the Executing Agency, \nand provincial and district authorities with active involvement of communities, women\u2019s unions, youth union, health \nworkers,  and  female  community  leaders  and  members.  Women  from  affected  households  will  be  involved  in  local \nmonitoring of the program at the local level.
