Subprogram  1  is  included  in  the \ncountry operations business plan for the Philippines, 2019\u20132021 of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB).2 \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  programmatic  approach  and budget  support.  The Philippines  is rebalancing  its \ncentral\u2013local  relations  to  promote  more  accountable  service  delivery  and  local  economic \ndevelopment (para. 10). Since 2006, ADB has played a leading role in supporting government \nreform  efforts  through  programmatic  lending  and  technical  assistance  (TA).  Past  efforts  have \nachieved important results. With ADB support, the government conducted a major review of the \n1991 Local Government Code (LGC) starting in 2013, focusing on expenditure management, and \nin 2014 introduced a medium-term LGU PFM reform strategy.3 The proposed program builds on \nthese efforts by expanding reform efforts to local governance and local economic development, \nand by aligning ADB support with government reform strategies and plans. Building on the earlier \nreview  of  the  LGC,  subprogram  1  advances  a  comprehensive  set  of  amendments  to  the  LGC \nacross  fiscal,  institutional,  and  administrative  dimensions;  professionalizes  local  PFM;  and \npromotes \ninvestment  and  economic  development.  Subprogram  2  will  support \nimplementation  of  amendments  to  the  LGC  and  expand  coverage  of  the  tools  and  systems \nintroduced  in  subprogram  1.4  The  program  will  be  complimented  by  a  project  loan,  which  will \nincrease local own-source revenues by supporting real property tax (RPT) reforms for targeted \nLGUs, setting up a real property valuation service, developing systems for property valuation and \ntax  payments,  and  professionalizing  local  assessors.5  The  government  has  expressed  their \ncommitment to the program in the attached development policy letter (Appendix 3).6 \n\nlocal \n\n2017\u20132022.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Policy-Based Loan \nfor Subprogram 2 to the Republic of the Philippines for the Local Government Finance and Fiscal Decentralization \nReform Program. Manila. \n\n4  ADB may consider a third subprogram, subject to discussions with the government. \n5  The real property tax is a local tax levied on \u201creal properties\u201d in the Philippines, including land, building and machinery. \n6  The Local Governance Reform Program was originally conceived as a sector development program incorporating \nboth a policy-based loan and a project loan; however, the sector development program has been separated into two \nindependent loans at the government\u2019s request. The separation request stems from timing differences in government \napprovals  for  the  project  versus  program  and  does  not  compromise  the  integrity  of  the  program  as  originally \nconceived. The project loan is targeted for board consideration in early 2020. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fStrong economic growth has not translated into inclusive development in the Philippines, \n4. \nwhere  disparities  in  income,  access  to  services,  and  economic  opportunities  persist.  The \neconomy  grew  6.2%  per  year  on  average  from  2011  to  2017,  driven  by  robust  domestic \ninvestment  and strong performance  in agriculture and construction.  Although  external  volatility \nfrom uncertain trade conditions is affecting growth prospects, gross domestic product (GDP) is \nprojected  to  grow  6.4%  in  both  2019  and  2020.  However,  income  inequality  exceeds  that  of \nregional  peers,  and national  averages mask  significant  regional  disparities.7  Poverty  incidence \nfell  from  26.6%  in  2006  to  21.6%  in  2015,  but  remains  among  the  highest  in  Southeast  Asia. \nContrary to national trends, poverty incidence is on the rise in parts of the eastern Visayas and in \nsouthern and western Mindanao; in these areas, poverty incidence can exceed 30.0%. The 22.5% \nof  women  in  poor  families  have  higher  poverty  rates  than  the  general  population;  poverty \nincidence  among  women  was  highest  in  the  Bangsamoro  Autonomous  Region  in  Muslim \nMindanao (BARMM), at 55.1%.8 Significant geographic diversity in the Philippines creates unique \ndevelopment challenges, where service delivery costs can be extremely high in the many remote \nparts of the country. Access to and quality of public services vary greatly across the Philippines: \nscores for grade 10 students on the National Achievement Test range from 61.4 (out of 100.0) in \nRegion  XIII  to  43.3  in  Region  I.9  Economic  opportunities  are  also  unevenly  distributed.  At \n\u20b1425,000 per year, the average household income in the National Capital Region (Metro Manila) \nis almost double the average for the rest of the country and almost triple the average of poorer \nareas such as Region V (Bicol Region), Region XII (comprising South Cotabato, Cotabato, Sultan \nKudarat, Sarangani, and General Santos in Mindanao), and BARMM.10 \n \n5. \nRole  of  local  governance.  Compared  with  regional  peers,  the  Philippines  is  very \ndecentralized.  A  global  decentralization  index  measuring  fiscal,  administrative,  and  political \ndecentralization places the Philippines 27th out of 182 countries, compared with Thailand (38th), \nIndonesia (40th), and Viet Nam (60th).11 Local government in the Philippines is broadly divided \ninto three levels, including provinces and independent cities, municipalities, and barangays. There \nare approximately 81 provinces, 145 cities, and some 1,490 municipalities, along with thousands \nof barangays. The LGC provides a formal basis for local management of public resources and \nservice delivery. In recognition of the disparities noted above, the government is engaged in major \nreforms to translate decentralization into inclusive growth, quality service delivery, and economic \nopportunity.  With  ADB  support,  these  efforts  have  begun  to  improve  service  delivery.  For \nexample, early childhood mortality rates declined from 31 per 1,000 in 2013 to 27 per 1,000 in \n2017,12  and  the  maternal mortality  ratio decreased  from  129 in 2010 to 114 in 2015,  although \naccess to skilled birth attendants remains a challenge for the poor.13 These improvements are \npartly driven by growth in local revenue collection and spending, which increased by more than \n20% from 2011 to 2016. Likewise, overall citizen satisfaction, as measured by the government\u2019s \nCitizen  Satisfaction  Index,  has  steadily  improved  since  2013.14  However,  more  remains  to  be \ndone.  The  legal  framework  has  not  kept  pace  with  the  government\u2019s  evolving  vision  of \ndecentralized local governance in the Philippines, and ambitious initial efforts have not translated \n\n \n\n7  The Philippines\u2019 Gini coefficient is 0.44, compared with 0.38 in Thailand, 0.39 in Indonesia, and 0.34 in Viet Nam. \n8  Government  of  the  Philippines,  Philippine  Statistics  Authority  (PSA).  2017.

Region I is the Ilocos Region in Luzon, and Region XIII is the Caraga Region in Mindanao. The national \naverage score for grade 10 students is 49.5 out of 100.0. \n\n10 2018 figures.

LGU  expenditures  comprise  about  18%  of  general \ngovernment  spending.  About  29%  of  LGU  revenue  comes  from  local  own-sources,  with  the \nbalance coming from central transfers. Accountability and quality of service delivery are stronger \nin LGUs with a greater share of own-source revenue and weaker in LGUs where central transfers \ndominate, as such LGUs enjoy the \u201cpleasure\u201d of spending without the \u201cpain\u201d of taxation. \n \n6. \nDevelopment  constraints.  To  translate  improved  local  governance  into  positive \ndevelopment outcomes, the government must address several constraints, including: (i) the need \nfor  an  updated  legal  and  regulatory  framework  to  empower  local  governments  to meet  citizen \nneeds;  (ii)  capacity  constraints  and  fragmentation  of  PFM  tools  and  systems,  which  impede \nefficient  and  effective  service  delivery;  and  (iii)  investment  barriers  that  hinder  equitable  and \ninclusive economic development. \n \n7. \nOutdated  legal  and  regulatory  framework  constrains  good  local  governance. \nSeveral  legal  and  institutional  constraints  impair  the  governance  of  LGUs  and  limit  LGUs\u2019 \naccountability  for  service  delivery.  Fiscal,  institutional,  and  administrative  arrangements  for \ndecentralized local governance in the LGC are not well-aligned with the service delivery needs \nthat LGUs face in practice. Moreover, reaching a consensus on amendments is difficult because \nof  the  sensitivity  of  decentralization  reforms  and  the  wide  range  of  stakeholders  involved.  For \nexample, insufficient clarity on the legal mandate for inter-LGU cooperation limits LGUs\u2019 scope to \njointly  address  regional  challenges\u2014for  instance,  by  partnering  for  service  delivery  in  waste \nmanagement or regional transport\u2014where economies of scale would support such an approach. \nThe  complexity  of  the  reforms  and  the  low  capacity  of  LGUs  exacerbate  these  challenges.  In \naddition, weaknesses in the legal framework for local revenue create a mismatch between areas \nwhere business costs are incurred and areas where taxes are collected. This discourages LGUs \nfrom mobilizing local own-source revenues and weakens the social compact between taxpayers \nand service delivery providers. \n \n8. \nFragmentation of systems and capacity constraints limit efficacy of PFM reforms. \nSignificant  variation  in  skills  and  competencies  exists  among  local  PFM  officials,  and  career \nadvancement is disconnected from capacity development. These constraints have made it difficult \nfor local governments to implement the LGU PFM reform roadmap. Weak treasury management \nhas  led  to  low  budget  execution  rates,  consistent  underspending,  and  unanticipated  budget \nsurpluses,  which  doubled  as  a  share  of  GDP  from  2012  to  2016.  Moreover,  because  of  their \nunpredictability,  these  surpluses  have  not  been  efficiently  allocated.15  Central  government \nagencies  have  introduced  electronic  platforms  and  tools  which  have  improved  the  quality, \ntimeliness,  accountability  transparency  of  local  PFM,  such  as  the  Electronic  Statement  of \nReceipts and Expenditures and the Local Government Financial Performance Monitoring System, \nbut the tools are fragmented and have increased the administrative burden on local officials. \n \n9. \nFinancing constraints must be addressed if LGUs are to provide proper support for \ninfrastructure investment, disaster resilience, and local economic development. Regulatory \nand administrative barriers constrain LGU access to finance; and outside of major metropolitan \nareas, the creditworthiness of LGUs is low because of an absence of effective fiscal rules. Poor \naccess to credit financing constrains the ability of LGUs to invest in infrastructure and deliver high-\nquality services. Local investment is further stymied by poor understanding and low use of public\u2013\nprivate partnerships. High-cost and inefficient local business environments discourage investment \nand  crimp  local  economic  development.  The  disaster  resilience  of  many  LGUs  is  low,  partly \nbecause of an absence of mechanisms to finance disaster risk at the local level.  \n\n15 Government of the Philippines, Bureau of Local Government Finance. 2017.

The  program  supports \n\nB. \n \n10. \nThe government\u2019s reform agenda. The PDP 2017\u20132022 targets efficient, effective, and \nequitable  public  service  delivery,  specifically  recognizing  the  role  of  local  governments.  In  line \nwith these objectives, the Philippines is reexamining its system of decentralized local governance. \nOne  option  being  considered  is  major  constitutional  reforms  toward  a  federal  system  of \ndecentralized  local  governance.  While  decisions  on  federal  versus  unitary  systems  belong  to \nPhilippine  citizens,  all  stakeholders  agree  that  a  more  effective  system  of  local  governance  is \nneeded. In a major shift, LGUs are moving away from acting as simple vehicles for public service \ndelivery  toward  catalyzing  private  investment  and  local  economic  development.  Underpinning \nthese  discussions,  the  ADB-supported  Local  Government  Finance  and Fiscal  Decentralization \nprogram  resulted  in  the  first  systematic  review  and  update  of  the  LGC  since  it  was  passed  in \n1991.16 In parallel with the review of the LGC, key stakeholders, including the Bureau of Local \nGovernment Finance, the Department of the Interior and Local Government, the Department of \nBudget  and  Management,  and  the  National  Economic  and  Development  Authority  have \nintroduced reforms to improve the quality and efficiency of service delivery and to enhance private \nsector participation in local economies. \n \n11. \nthree  primary  reform  areas:  \n(i)  strengthening  the  local  governance  framework  for  service  delivery;  (ii)  modernizing  and \nprofessionalizing  local  PFM;  and  (iii)  improving  the  LGU  financing  and  investment  framework. \nUnder subprogram 1, the government has accomplished 15 policy actions related to these reform \nareas: nine high-impact policy triggers and six policy milestones.17  \n \nStrengthening  the  local  governance  framework  for  service  delivery.  Under \n12. \nsubprogram 1, a broad, consultative drafting process resulted in a suite of amendments to the \nLGC  that  have  been  filed  with the  Congress.  Amendments  included:  (i)  clarification  on  who  is \nresponsible for delivering and paying for public services across government levels; and (ii) new \nmeasures to empower and promote inter-LGU cooperation; these allow LGUs to address inter-\njurisdictional  issues  where economies  of  scale invite a joint  approach,  such  as for  solid waste \nmanagement or urban transport. Major amendments to the framework for revenue mobilization \nhave also been filed with Congress, including provisions to (i) align business tax collection with \nthe geographic area in which the business activities took place, (ii) reduce uncertainty for private \ninvestment by harmonizing fees and fines across LGUs, and (iii) increase local autonomy in the \nuse  of  natural  resource  revenues.  To  promote  local  revenue  mobilization,  the  government \nofficially  incorporated  local  property  tax  reforms  as  part  of  the  national  Comprehensive  Tax \nReform Program, and an updated real property valuation and assessment reform act (RPVARA) \nwas filed with the Congress as part of the government\u2019s tax reform agenda. The RPVARA aims \nto broaden  the  property tax  base,  institutionalize  property valuation standards,  and  provide for \nprofessionalized property-value assessment consistent with international good practices. These \nreforms  are  expected  to  remove  political  economy  barriers  to  regularly  updating  local  market-\nvalue schedules, allowing LGUs to dramatically increase revenues from local property taxes. The \nproject (footnote 6) under preparation contemplates support for the implementation of the RPT \nreforms.  \n \n13. \nSubprogram 2 will target implementation of key LGC amendments drafted and filed under \nsubprogram 1, such as developing and publishing implementing rules and regulations for RPT \nreforms and rolling out a unified property tax database and transaction system. Subprogram 2 will \n\n16 ADB. Philippines: Local Government Finance and Fiscal Decentralization Reform Program\u2014Subprogram 1. \n17 The policy matrix is in Appendix 4. \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\falso  address  weaknesses  in  coordinating  policies,  planning,  and  budget  execution  between \ncentral  and  local  governments  and  among  local  governments  within  a  given  region.  The \ngovernment  plans  to  operationalize  an  online  e-planning  system  for  real-time  submission  and \ntracking of 3-year public investment programs, and will require national government agencies to \nprioritize  projects  and  activities  in  the  Local  Development  Investment  Program  rather  than \nidentifying  stand-alone  departmental  priorities.18  Finally,  the  government  will  refine  functional \nroles and responsibilities of LGUs in line with the 2018 Supreme Court decision to broaden the \ndefinition  of  centrally-collected  revenues  to  be  shared  with  local  governments,  effectively \nincreasing fiscal transfers.  \n \n14.  Modernizing and professionalizing local public financial management.  This reform \narea  addresses  public  service  delivery  failures  brought  about  by  weak  capacity  in  the  local \nbureaucracy  and  inefficient  PFM.  One  major  accomplishment  under  subprogram  1  is  the \nStandardized  Examination  and  Assessment  for  Local  Treasury  Service  (SEAL)  program.  The \nSEAL program introduced a three-tier competency and assessment framework to professionalize \nlocal treasurers, representing a significant departure from the past practice of the local executive \nselecting a treasurer irrespective of professional merit. As a testament to the rigorous nature of \nthe SEAL program, the first round of examinations resulted in a pass rate of just 35% for the more \nthan  1,000  examinees,  offering  greater  confidence  that  successful  candidates  have  the  skills \nnecessary  for  responsible  stewardship  of  public  resources.  To  accompany  people-centered \nreform, the government has also introduced tools to defragment, simplify, and improve the cross-\nplatform functionality of local PFM. Such tools include the LGU Integrated Financial Tools (LIFT) \nPFM system, which standardizes fiscal reporting and consolidates subnational financial accounts. \nLIFT  establishes  cross-platform  functionality  between  the  different  subnational  PFM  systems.  \nThe government  has  also formally  adopted  a  fiscal  sustainability  scorecard  for  LGUs to  grade \nboth quantitative and qualitative fiscal performance. \n \n15. \nUnder subprogram 2, the government will expand the professionalization of PFM officers \nin the local bureaucracy by introducing a competency measurement and assessment system for \nlocal  budget  officers,  similar  to  the  SEAL  program,  with  supporting  electronic  capacity \ndevelopment tools. Subprogram 2 will also introduce new institutional incentives for accountable \npublic finance, through the inclusion of national minimum standards for PFM performance as part \nof  the  Seal  of  Good  Local  Governance\u2019s  eligibility  criteria.  Proposed  indicators  include \ncomprehensiveness  of  budget  coverage,  strength  of  budget  execution,  timeliness  and \ntransparency  of  financial  reporting  including  gender  responsive  budgets,  and  alignment  of \nsubnational procurement with nationally recognized good practices.19 The government also plans \nto  further  improve  linkages  between  subnational  PFM  tools  and  systems  by  linking  the  LGU  \ne-Budget preparatory system and the LIFT PFM system to produce a single consolidated set of \nfiscal data for the whole of local government. \n \nImproving  the  local  government  unit  financing  and  investment  framework.  Under \n16. \nthis  reform  area,  the  government  addressed  LGU  financing  constraints  to  support  investment, \nservice delivery, and local economic development. Major accomplishments under subprogram 1 \ninclude passage of the Ease of Doing Business Act, 2018, which is designed to improve service \nefficiency and reduce the cost of doing business for private sector actors. In addition, a new local \nfinancing and debt framework was filed with Congress to improve LGU access to credit financing. \n\n \n\n18 The Local Development Investment Program allocates investment funds for programs, projects and activities under \n\nthe Comprehensive Development Plan. \n\n19 The Seal of Good Local Governance evaluates performance across a range of dimensions such as responsiveness \n\nand business friendliness and is linked to the provision of performance-based grants for qualifying LGUs. \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fThe government introduced fiscal rules to strengthen LGU creditworthiness, making LGUs more \nattractive  and  less  risky  for  private  lending  institutions.  The  government  also  increased  LGU \naccess to disaster risk financing by establishing a legal mandate for parametric localized disaster \nrisk  insurance.20  Finally,  the  government  is  improving  the  quality  and  transparency  of  LGU \nperformance monitoring through an LGU client rating system. The system allows citizens to easily \nprovide feedback on LGU service delivery performance to management at both central and local \ngovernment levels, so systematic weaknesses can be identified and addressed. \n \nUnder subprogram 2, the government plans to strengthen LGU disaster risk preparedness \n17. \nby introducing a new law requiring all LGU public assets to have property insurance. Building on \nthe  Ease  of  Doing  Business  Act,  the  government  plans  to  consolidate  the  issuance  of  local \nlicenses and permits under an electronic single service window, further reducing transaction costs \nfor the private sector. This will encourage the launch of more business start-ups and smooth their \noperations\u2014measures that  will  particularly benefit  women,  who registered more new  business \nnames (55.51%) than men in 2018.21 Finally, the government plans to enhance the online LGU \nclient rating system to cover a wider range of public services and provide real-time comparative \ninformation to citizens on the performance of their local governments. \n \n18. \nADB\u2019s  experience  and  strategy.  ADB  has  played  a  leading  role  in  supporting  local \ngovernance in the Philippines through TA, programmatic lending, and investment projects (see \nthe figure below). The Local Government Financing and Budget Reform Program from 2006 to \n2010  helped  institutionalize  the  timely  and  transparent  release  of  LGU  shares  in  national \ngovernment  revenues  to  improve  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  service  delivery.22  It  also \noperationalized local budgeting reforms in all provinces and highly urbanized cities. From 2010 to \n2016, ADB expanded engagement with LGUs through the Local Government Finance and Fiscal \nDecentralization  Reform  Program  (footnote  16),  conducting  the  first  review  of  the  LGC  in  \n25 years (para. 12), operationalizing the Performance Challenge Fund and the Seal of Good Local \nGovernance  to  incentivize  service  delivery  performance,  and  developing  and  implementing  a \nmedium-term LGU PFM reform strategy.23 Project completion reports rated both ADB program \nclusters highly relevant and satisfactory overall.24 \n \n\n2006: TA for Local \nGovernance and Fiscal \nManagement \n\n2010\u20132016: Loan for Local \nGovernment Finance and \nFiscal Decentralization Reform \nProgram \n\nADB\u2019s Engagement on Local Governance and Public Financial Management \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2013: TA for Support to \nLocal Government Finance \n \nand Fiscal Decentralization \n \nReform Program \n\n2011: TA for Support to Local \nGovernment Revenue \nGeneration and Land \nAdministration Program \n\n2015: TA for Support to Local \nGovernment Accountability \nSystems \n\n2010 \n\n2015 \n\n2020 \n\n2019\u20132021: Proposed \nPolicy-based Loan for \nLocal Governance Reform \nProgram \n\n2019\u20132021: Proposed \nLocal Governance \nReform  Project \n \n\n2005 \n\n2006\u20132010: Loan \nand TA for Local \nGovernment \n\n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: ADB staff. \n\n \n\n20 Parametric  insurance  ex  ante  agrees  to  make  payments  upon  the  occurrence  of  a  triggering  event,  rather  than \n\nindemnifying pure loss.

First,  while  previous  programs  focused  on  promoting \ndecentralization to support local service delivery, the proposed program focuses on improving the \nquality and efficiency of service delivery under existing structures while equipping LGUs with the \ntools  and  skills  to  better  perform  their  roles.  Second,  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy  for  the  Philippines,  2018\u20132023,  the  program  serves  as  an  umbrella  program  for  ADB \nengagement  in  local  economic  development  in  the  Philippines,  providing  a  policy  anchor  for \nsector-specific  operations  such  as  the  Regional  Development  Facility,  the  Livable  Cities \nInvestment Project, the Philippines City Disaster Insurance Pool, and several local infrastructure \nprojects.25 The program is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (Table 1).26 \n \n\nStrategy 2030 Priority \nAddressing remaining poverty \nand reducing inequalities \nTackling climate change, \nbuilding climate and disaster \nresilience  \nMaking cities more livable \n\nStrengthening governance and \ninstitutional capacity \n\nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \n\nProgram Activity \nStrengthen local service delivery and foster development of local job \nopportunities to address regional disparities \nPromote disaster preparedness through a parametric local disaster \ninsurance scheme; promote resilience through mandatory insurance \nof local assets \nImprove quality and responsiveness of municipal services through \nthe local government unit client rating system; promote local \ninfrastructure investment  \nProfessionalize local public financial management officials \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n20. \nLessons  learned.  Several  lessons  have  emerged  from  ADB\u2019s  engagement  in  local \ngovernance across the region. First, decentralization is a process for achieving the proper balance \nbetween central\u2013local relations, and a clear vision with time-bound milestones is needed to avoid \na state of perpetual decentralization. Past decentralization efforts in the Philippines have focused \non  supporting  more  decentralization  with  each  iteration,  increasing  the  relative  share  of \nresponsibilities  and  powers  for  LGUs.  The  evolving  focus  of  the  program  is  to  place  more \nemphasis  on  better  local  governance  and  service  delivery  for  a  given  balance  of  central-local \nrelations, rather than perpetuating a cycle of ever-increasing decentralization. Second, complex \nmulti-stakeholder  reforms  often  require  more  support  for  implementation  than  they  require  for \npolicy  formulation.  Earlier  efforts  to  provide  a  strong  framework  for  own-source  local  revenue \nmobilization have not yet solved LGUs\u2019 heavy reliance on intergovernmental fiscal transfers.27 To \npromote  greater  revenue  autonomy,  extensive  support  is  needed  for  reform  implementation, \nincluding tools, systems, and capacity development at multiple government levels. The design of \nthis program, as complimented by the project loan (footnote 6) will bridge this gap between policy \ndevelopment and reform implementation. \n \nADB\u2019s  value  addition.  Through  its  long-term  engagement  in  local  governance  in  the \n21. \nPhilippines, ADB has supported the development of a targeted, problem-driven reform agenda in \nthe  country.  ADB  provided  TA  to  support  revising  and  ultimately  filing  LGC  amendments  in \nCongress.28  ADB  also  supported  the  development  of  the  LIFT  system  as  well  as  the  SEAL \n\n \n\n25 ADB. 2018.

Under the Domestic Resource Mobilization Trust Fund \ncontributed by the Government of Japan, ADB supported preparation of the RPVARA to increase \nown-source local revenues from RPTs (para. 12). This trust fund also supported the development \nof  the  Philippine  Valuation  Standards,  which  ensures  that  property  assessment  and  valuation \npractices  are  in  line  with  international  practices.29 Going forward,  ADB  will  continue  to  support \nlocal governance reforms through a new regional trust fund.30 \n \n22. \nDevelopment partner coordination. ADB is the leading partner on local governance in \nthe  Philippines  but  works  closely  with  other  development  partners  to  ensure  that  efforts  are \naligned and complementary. ADB meets regularly with the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment  on  local  infrastructure  development  and  regional  assistance  to Mindanao.  It  has \nalso  coordinated  closely  with  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  and  policy  actions  under  the \nprogram  are  consistent  with  the  International  Monetary  Fund\u2019s  broad  assessment  and \nrecommendations for the Philippines. ADB also coordinates with the World Bank, particularly on \nensuring links between national PFM reforms (World Bank) and subnational PFM reforms (ADB). \nThe  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise de  D\u00e9veloppement  has also provided  technical assistance,  including  a \nstudy on the French approach to inter-LGU service delivery coordination. \n \nC. \n \nIn  line  with  the  Philippines  Development  Plan  (PDP)  2017\u20132022,  the  program  has  the \n23. \nfollowing impact: efficient, effective, and equitable public service delivery enhanced (footnote 1). \nThe  program  will  have  the  following  outcome:  service  delivery  ability  and  local  governance \nperformance  of  LGUs  improved.  The  impact  of  the  program  is  demonstrated  through  the \nperformance indicators in the design and monitoring framework.31 \n \n24. \nThe economic impact of the local governance reforms under the program is expected to \nbe substantial. The program impact assessment estimates the program\u2019s potential net economic \nbenefits at $1.5 billion\u2013$1.7 billion, using conservative assumptions.32 The primary transmission \nchannels for benefits are improved quality and efficiency of public service delivery in line with local \npreferences, reduced reliance on other distortionary tax and nontax revenue sources, and lower \ncost of doing business for the private sector.  \n \nD. \n \n25. \nThe government has requested two regular loans of $300 million each for subprograms 1 \nand 2, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the program. The PBL will provide \nbudget financing to support improved service delivery and local governance performance as well \nas priority activities in the government\u2019s development policy letter.33 The loan for subprogram 1 \nwill have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\n \n\n29 ADB.  2011.

To  finance  the  deficit,  the \ngovernment plans to raise $17.4 billion from the issuance of securities and $2.7 billion from official \nforeign  loans.  The  loan  size  for  subprogram  1  reflects  the  government\u2019s  financing  needs,  the \nstrength of the program, and the net economic benefits (para. 24). \n \nE. \n \n27. \nThe Department of Finance (DOF) is the executing agency for the program. The Bureau \nof  Local  Government  Finance,  Department  of  Budget  and  Management,  the  Department  of \nInterior  and  Local  Government,  National  Economic  and  Development  Authority,  and  Public\u2013\nPrivate  Partnership  Center  are the  implementing agencies.  The  implementation  period  is  June  \n2017\u2013June 2019. A steering committee chaired by the DOF oversees program implementation. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  withdrawn  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time).    \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nSafeguards.

Reforms  under  the  program  will  help  the  government  achieve  its \npoverty reduction targets by expanding the quality and range of public services available to the \npoor and by providing opportunities for inclusive local economic development. Specific measures \nwill include the introduction of (i) an LGU client rating system to provide the poor with a feedback \nchannel to improve service delivery, and (ii) local parametric disaster insurance to help ensure a \ntimely  fiscal  response  to  the  needs  of  the  poor  in  a  post-disaster  situation.  Subprogram  1  is \nclassified  some  gender  elements.  Linking  the  comprehensive  development  planning  process \n(through which LGUs determine development priorities) with the Local Development Investment \nProgram  (through  which  LGUs  identify  investment  projects)  will  provide  a  platform  for \nmainstreaming  gender  dimensions.  Reforming  the  local  business  environment  will  have  a \nparticularly  important  impact  on  women  small  business  owners  and  entrepreneurs.  The  LIFT \nsystem will provide a mechanism for gender-responsive budgeting and tracking of expenditures \nin line with government regulations.  \n \nGovernance. A public expenditure and financial accountability assessment conducted in \n30. \n2017 by the World Bank found that three of seven core PFM areas have improved: policy-based \nbudgeting, transparency, and asset\u2013liability management. Financial management is weaker, but \nefforts to improve budget credibility, predictability, execution, and external scrutiny and audit are \nongoing. Reforms under the program will significantly strengthen local PFM. The government is \nalso implementing a results-based anticorruption plan that will strengthen the judicial branch of \ngovernment and the Office of the Ombudsman. ADB explained its Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended  to  date)  to  the  government  including  the  DOF.  The  overall  governance  risk  for  the \n\n34 The loan may be disbursed in one or more installments. \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fprogram  is  low  to  moderate.
