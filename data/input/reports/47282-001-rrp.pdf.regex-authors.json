THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Energy \nSupply Improvement Investment Program.1  \n \n2.  The MFF will reinforce ongoing projects and finance new investments to boost energy \ntrade and regional cooperation, strengthen the country\u2019s energy infrastructure, increase energy \nsupply to accelerate the electrification rate, and improve operational efficiency in the sector. In \npower subsector, generation (renewable energy), transmission (regional and domestic lines), \nand distribution (on- and off-grid networks) projects are proposed, while wells rehabilitation is \nplanned in gas subsector. An MFF is proposed as (i) tranches will be programmatically aligned \nwith priorities of the government\u2019s $10.1 billion National Energy Supply Program 2013 (NESP), \n(ii) the program will be a showcase to explore and confirm cofinancing options and private \nsector participation, (iii) continuity in combining sector investments and nonphysical components \nfor  integrated  energy  sector  development  will  be  ensured,  and  (iv)  the  program  allows \nneighboring countries to develop regional projects for transit and trade.2 \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Energy deficit. After security, access to energy is the highest priority of households and \nbusinesses in Afghanistan.3 Energy demand has grown by almost twice the economic growth \nrate during 2005\u20132012. However, Afghanistan ranks among the lowest 5% in per capita energy \nconsumption globally and is a net energy importer. In 2014, more than 80% (1,000 megawatts \n[MW])  of  its  total  power  supply  (1,247  MW)  came  from  Iran  (16%),  Tajikistan  (25%), \nTurkmenistan  (12%),  and  Uzbekistan  (27%),  with  the  rest  generated  through  indigenous \nhydropower and thermal sources. Lack of domestic generation remains the key challenge for \nenergy security in Afghanistan.4 Insufficient energy supplies and the demand\u2013supply imbalance \nconstrain growth and income opportunities; create disparities in economic development; and \nfuel ethnic and regional tensions, insecurity, and discontent. Despite significant potential for \nrenewable energy and fossil fuel reserves, these have not been developed because of financing \nconstraints. In 2014, nearly 97% of domestic oil needs were imported despite proven reserves \nof 80 million barrels in the Amu Darya basin\u2014one of four major gas basins. The lack of a gas \npricing framework and insecurity inhibit private sector participation to develop identified gas \nreserves of 75 billion cubic meters\u2014enough to generate 400 MW of power annually for 75 years.  \n \n4.  Grid power remains a growing portion of total energy consumption, and connection rates \nincreased from 5% in 2002 to 30% in 2015, at the current supply of 750 MW and power \nconsumption of 3,700 gigawatt-hours. Demand for power in four of Afghanistan\u2019s largest cities is \ngrowing by 19% annually, and by 2032 demand is forecast to reach 3,500 MW and power \nconsumption to 18,400 gigawatt-hours.5 Meeting this demand requires boosting all viable import \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the MFF II: Energy \nDevelopment 2014\u20132023 (TA 8509-AFG for $1.5 million approved on 20 November 2013). \n3  Surveys conducted by The Asia Foundation and International Finance Corporation in 2011 in Afghanistan. \nHouseholds consume 85% of power, followed by commercial users (7%), government (5%), and others (3%). \n4  The absence of a water treaty with neighboring countries impedes the development of indigenous hydropower, \nwhile the refusal by mining investors to meet their contractual obligations is stalling coal or gas-to-power projects. \n5  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Power Sector Master Plan. Manila \n(TA 7637-AFG, for $1.5 million approved on 6 November 2010). \n ", "2 \noptions in parallel to harnessing domestic resources. The key challenges are (i) a lack of \ngeneration capacity, (ii) constraints in transmission and distribution systems, (iii) weak financial \nmanagement  and  operational  sustainability  of  sector  entities  due  to  an  inadequate  tariff \nframework, and (iv) poor sector regulation. The MFF will address these points directly. Since \ngovernment  resources are  limited, financing from development  partners  and  private  sector \nparticipation are needed to bridge the infrastructure deficit. The NESP envisages investment of \n$10.1 billion by 2030 to (i) increase the electrification rate from 30% to 83%, (ii) increase \ndomestic generation from 20% to 67%, and (iii) strengthen power exchange and trade options. \nHowever, because of the limited fiscal space in government finances, dismal private investment \noutlook,  and  directives  from  the  International  Monetary  Fund  to  the  government  against \nborrowing, grant funding from development partners will be the major source of NESP financing. \n \n5.  Energy infrastructure constraints. Of the 519 MW available installed capacity, 51% is \nthermal (diesel and furnace oil) with a generation cost of $0.25\u2013$0.35 per kilowatt-hour, nearly \nfour to five times cost of imported power. The remaining 49% (254 MW) is from hydropower, \nwhich is seasonal and has a capacity factor of less than 40%. No new hydropower, gas, or coal \ngeneration has been added since the 1980s.6 Afghanistan\u2019s power system is not synchronized \nwith any of the four countries that it imports from, and is split into 10 power islands\u2014increasing \ncosts and reducing reliability of supply. The individual networks operate asynchronously and \ncannot be interconnected because of differences in operational phase angles and frequency \nvariations. The lack of transmission and distribution infrastructure suppresses available latent \ndemand of nearly 2,500 MW. A unified grid will secure power supply from a balanced energy \nmix, achieve diversification, and share reserve capacity, as well as strengthen Afghanistan\u2019s \nrole as an electricity transit corridor between energy-rich Central Asia and energy-poor South \nAsia.  Afghanistan  is  an  anchor  in  the  regional  Turkmenistan\u2013Uzbekistan\u2013Tajikistan\u2013\nAfghanistan\u2013Pakistan (TUTAP) interconnection and Turkmenistan\u2013Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan\u2013India \n(TAPI) natural gas pipeline project.7 On 6 November 2015, the Government of Afghanistan \nsigned a 2015\u20132028 power purchase and sales agreement (PPSA) with Turkmenistan for year-\nround power supply (300 MW initially, with an increase of up to 500 MW) at a very competitive \ntariff compared with existing imports. The PPSA will be renewed thereafter. The PPSAs with \nUzbekistan (300 MW), Tajikistan (300 MW), and Iran (150 MW) are effective and renewed \nannually. Despite barriers, the sector has curtailed technical, fiscal, and governance deficits.8  \n \n6.  Policy framework. The government is implementing the energy sector road map, policy \nframework, and the envisaged investment plan as confirmed in its power sector master plan, \n2012\u20132032 and gas development master plan, 2015\u20132035, which both build on the Afghanistan \nNational Development Strategy, 2008\u20132013, and are integrated into the NESP.9 The approved \nElectricity Services Law, 2015, provides a legal and regulatory framework, and a transparent \nstructure for private sector participation.10 The power subsector in Afghanistan made substantial \n                                                \n6  The World Bank and the Government of the United States are assisting rehabilitation of three hydropower plants. \n7  TUTAP is a regional power project under the Central Asia South Asia Regional Electricity Markets framework. \nPhase  1  of  TUTAP  (Afghanistan\u2013Uzbekistan  220-kilovolt  [kV]  line)  was  commissioned  in  2009.  Phase  2 \n(Afghanistan\u2013Tajikistan 220 kV line) was commissioned in 2011. Phase 3 will be completed under tranches 1 and \n2 of the MFF. TUTAP meets Afghan power needs and all TUTAP imports until 2030 will be consumed in country. \nConstruction work on TAPI is expected to begin in 2016 and requisite tariff and transit agreements are signed. \n8  System losses dropped from 70% in 2002 to 25% in 2014; collection rates increased from 50% in 2002 to 90% in \n2014; revenues increased by 15% per quarter since 2009; and sector corporatization is enhanced by formation of \nDa  Afghanistan  Breshna  Sherkat  (DABS)  in  2009  and  the  Afghan  Gas  Enterprise  (AGE)  in  2011.  AGE \ncorporatization is supported by the World Bank to negotiate imported gas purchase and transit agreements. \n9  Because of fiscal challenges, the government is expected to finance less than 5% ($500 million) of the NESP. \n10  Under the law, the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) will initially act as regulator. ADB will provide support to \nstrengthen the tariff determination framework and possible regulatory support under the MFF. \n ", "3 \nprogress in meeting the strategic objectives and milestones set out in 2012, including (i) greater \nefficiency from existing operations (rehabilitation of hydropower plants and power networks); (ii) \nimprovement in sector governance (formulation of electricity services law, renewable energy \npolicy and autonomous power utility, and institutionalization of operations and management \nsystem); (iii) promotion of rural energy (development of off-grid networks); and (iv) investments \nin new capacity (development of additional generation, transmission, and distribution systems). \n \n7.  Road map and strategic context. The NESP road map, 2013\u20132030 focuses on energy \nsupply,  transmission  and  distribution,  energy  efficiency,  reinforcing  institutions  and  private \nsector participation, capacity support, and regulatory strengthening.11 It underscores an urgent \nneed to construct indigenous generation (gas, coal, and hydropower).12 However, as domestic \nprojects will take time to develop (footnote 4), high reliance on imports will continue in the \nmedium term. Building a 500-kilovolt (kV) transmission ring to connect major load centers would \naccelerate electrification rate in major load centers and cities. The road map also stresses the \nphased development of renewable energy projects in 15 off-grid provinces,13 development and \ncertification of gas reserves, and rehabilitation of existing gas wells to support anchor loads and \nenergy-intensive industries, as identified in the gas development master plan.14 \n \n8.  ADB assistance and country partnership strategy. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) is the country\u2019s largest on-budget development partner in the sector, with cumulative \ngrant assistance of nearly $937 million. ADB-assisted projects have commissioned more than \n630 kilometers (km) of transmission lines, eight substations, 15,000 new power connections, \nand eight gas wells to produce 2 million cubic meters of gas per day. Other projects under \nimplementation include nearly 400 km of transmission lines, four substations, 110,000 new \nconnections,  and  a  hydropower  project  to  generate  4.5  MW.  Additional  support  has  been \nprovided  to  strengthen  operations  and  maintenance,  projects  preparation,  and  capacity \ndevelopment. The ADB-assisted ongoing energy MFF, approved in 2008 and with a closing \ndate  on  28  November  2018,  is  fully  committed,  showing  satisfactory  results,  with  some \nimplementation lag caused by insecurity, capacity constraints, and procurement difficulties.15  \n \n9.  The proposed MFF is in line with ADB\u2019s interim country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132015, \nand is included in Afghanistan\u2019s country operations business plan, 2015\u20132017, which prioritizes \ninfrastructure development, and in the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation strategy, \nwhich promotes regional cooperation and energy trade.16 The MFF is designed with the lessons \nlearned from ADB-financed energy sector interventions in Afghanistan. These include the need \nto (i) finance security, demining, and taxes as part of project costs; (ii) streamline procurement \nand implementation through turnkey contracting; and (iii) provide flexible tranches to match the \nemerging sector needs. The Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW), the policy and regulatory \nbody,  is  being  strengthened  by  financing  from  United  States  government  funds.  The \n                                                \n11  The NESP has an investment plan of $10.1 billion, of which $7.3 billion is for generation and network integration, \n$1.7 billion for major transmission links, and $1.1 billion for subtransmission and distribution in provinces. \n12  Gas and coal power plants are envisaged to be developed by the private sector, and development partners are \nassisting in rehabilitating existing and constructing new hydro plants. \n13  ADB. 2014.

In  Afghanistan,  harmonizing  energy  investment  plans  remains  challenging  because \n(i) uncertainty in the development budget has led to a lack of integrated planning; (ii) more than \n50% of sector investments funded by bilateral development partners and military funds bypass \nthe  government\u2019s  core  budget  and  planning  systems,  leaving  the  government  with  limited \ninformation on these donor-funded projects, plans, and activities; and (iii) security risks impede \nprogress.18 Bilateral  development  partners  work  on  annual  planning  cycles,  with  budgets \navailable on a use-it-or-lose-it basis, and project priorities may change in line with the fragile \nand volatile situation in Afghanistan. The ADB-assisted Inter-Ministerial Commission for Energy \nhas been vital in coordinating and streamlining sector investments and capacity development \nassistance.19 The MFF comprises priority NESP projects that have been agreed at the Inter-\nMinisterial Commission for Energy and approved by the Office of the President of Afghanistan. \n \n11.  Investment program. Nearly $10.1 billion\u2014funded by the government, development \npartners, and the private sector under the NESP\u2014is needed by 2032 to support economic \ngrowth of 10% and to reduce poverty by 3% per year.20 The MFF, through ADB and Afghanistan \nInfrastructure Trust Fund (AITF) financing of up to $1.2 billion, will be implemented countrywide \nto support (i) energy infrastructure improvements, operations, and maintenance; (ii) feasibility \nstudies and designs; and (iii) human resource development and institutional reform.21  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact of the MFF will be improved access to sustainable energy supplies across \nAfghanistan. The outcome will be increased supply of imported and indigenous power. \n \nC.  Outputs \n13.  The MFF will have five outputs: (i) new 500 kV and 220 kV power transmission lines, \npower distribution networks, and high-voltage, direct-current, back-to-back convertor station \ncommissioned; (ii) renewable energy projects constructed; (iii) domestic gas production and \nimported volume of natural gas from TAPI gas pipeline increased; (iv) project preparation and \nmanagement capacity of energy ministries and agencies improved; and (v) Da Afghanistan \nBreshna Sherkat (DABS) business plan, and tariff model and framework developed. The MFF \nwill finance nonphysical interventions, particularly capacity and governance support, and sector \nreforms, under (iv) and (v). Additional capacity gaps and sector issues identified under (v), will \nbe addressed in subsequent tranches. \n \n14.  The first tranche of the MFF will finance: (i) 306 km of 500 kV transmission line from \nSheberghan  to  Dashte  Alwan;  (ii)  65  km  of  220  kV  transmission  line  from  Andkhoy  to \nSheberghan; (iii) analytical studies, particularly the development of a business plan, and a tariff \n                                                \n17 The sector investment road map and policy framework are discussed in the Framework Financing Agreement    \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18  More than 80% of the Afghan development budget is financed through grants from development partners. \n19  ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for Supporting the Inter-Ministerial \nCommission for Energy. Manila (TA 8328-AFG, $1.5 million, approved on 22 February). \n20 The NESP was jointly endorsed by the Government of Afghanistan and international development partners in 2013. \n21  The ADB-administered AITF, established in 2010, pools resources from bilateral development partners to finance \ncritical infrastructure investments in Afghanistan. AITF contributors, to date, include the governments of Japan, the \nUnited Kingdom, and the United States. \n ", "5 \nmodel and framework for DABS; (iv) preparation of future projects; and (v) support for program \nmanagement  and  implementation. 22  Tranche  1  will  allow  expanded  power  imports  by \nconstructing  the  last  missing  links  to  forge  an  expanded  Turkmenistan\u2013Afghanistan  power \ninterconnection. Tranches 2 to 4, to be prepared by the project preparatory consultants to be \nfinanced under tranche 1, are expected to finance (i) a high-voltage, direct-current, back-to-back \nconvertor station at Dashte Alwan to enable asynchronous interconnection with Turkmenistan; \n(ii) a Herat\u2013Kandahar transmission line and related distribution networks; (iii) renewable energy \ngeneration; and (iv) gas wells rehabilitation and Afghanistan\u2019s equity component for the TAPI \nnatural gas pipeline project. All of these are NESP priority investment projects. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n15.  The government has requested an MFF to help finance a portion of its $10.1 billion \nNESP amounting to $1.22 billion. The MFF is projected to have four tranches from 2015 to 2025. \nTranche 1 is expected to be executed in 2015.

The MFF \ncomprises an amount of up to $750 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, i.e., Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) resources, and an amount of up to $450 million as joint cofinancing \nfrom the AITF to be administered by ADB.23 Any ADF allocation will be subject to (i) the \n                                                \n22  Selection of future projects must meet the following criteria, among others: (i) a priority project in the NESP; (ii) a \ncandidate for the least-cost expansion; and (iii) compliance with technical, financial and economic, and social \nsafeguards due diligence criteria of ADB and the government. \n23  Instruments of contribution to the AITF totaling $75 million have been executed. Discussions are ongoing with the \ngovernments of Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom for the \ncontribution of further amounts totaling $375 million. For every tranche that will be supported by AITF cofinancing, \ninstruments of contribution to the AITF in the total amount of the said AITF cofinancing will be executed prior to the \napproval of the tranche.  \n ", "6 \navailability of ADF resources, (ii) Afghanistan\u2019s access to such resources pursuant to ADB\u2019s \ngraduation  policy 24 and  the  requirements  of  ADF  donors,  and  (iii)  the  availability  of  such \nresources  to  Afghanistan  given  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  performance-based  allocation  of  ADF \nresources.25 Cofinancing  will  be  front-loaded  for  disbursement  purposes.  ADF  and  AITF \nfinancing under the MFF will be provided 100% as grants to Afghanistan.   \n \n17.   The MFF will consist of several tranches, subject to the government\u2019s submission of \nrelated periodic financing requests, execution of the related grant and project agreements for \neach  tranche,  and  fulfillment  of  terms  and  conditions  and  undertakings  set  forth  in  the \nframework financing agreement. For tranche 1, the government has requested (i) a grant of \n$200 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources,26 and (ii) a grant of $75 million from AITF \ncofinancing to be administered by ADB (footnote 21). Financing extended under the MFF will \ncover local taxes and duties, including the business receipt tax.27 ADB and the AITF have been \nfinancing local taxes and duties in Afghanistan since 2011. \n \n18.

DABS, MEW, and the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum (MOMP) will be the executing \nagencies of the MFF. The program management office (PMO) set up for the first energy MFF \n(footnote 15) is operational and familiar with ADB policies and guidelines. It will be responsible \nfor implementing and monitoring the investment program. The PMO will be provided with project \nimplementation  support  from  tranche  1  financing.  The  implementation  arrangements  are \nsummarized in Table 3 and detailed in the facility administration manual (FAM).29 \n                                                \n24 Currently, ADB.  2008.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n20.  The tranche 1 project extends the Afghanistan\u2013Turkmenistan 500 kV interconnection to \nDashte Alwan, the hub of converging power interconnections from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, \nand would complete the 500 kV ring from the Afghan\u2013Turkmen border to Kabul. By 2018, \nTurkmenistan  will  add  1,570  MW  of  gas-to-power  generation  capacity,  and  the  500  kV \ntransmission line inside Turkmenistan to the Afghan border is completed. The PPSA between \nAfghanistan and Turkmenistan\u2014which includes tariff, volumes, and penalties\u2014was signed in \nNovember 2015. The demand forecast in Afghanistan, confirmed by the power master plan, \njustifies the construction of a 500 kV transmission line to enable asynchronous interconnection \nwith Turkmenistan. The requisite load flow studies were conducted in 2013\u20132014 to confirm the \n500 kV alternating current connection. Ongoing investments are adequate to evacuate and \ndisperse this power across Afghanistan. The 220 kV transmission line would also enable power \nevacuation from  domestic gas to  power generation  plants  in  northern  Afghanistan.  Similar \nanalysis will be undertaken for projects proposed under subsequent tranches. International \ncontractors are under procurement on other ADB and development partner-assisted projects to \nimplement 500 kV and 220 kV transmission lines, as well as converter stations in Afghanistan. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  Economic and financial analyses will be undertaken for each tranche under the MFF. For \ntranche 1, the analysis considered both transmission lines as one undertaking; these lines will \nbe interconnected with another ADB-assisted project that is connected to the Turkmenistan grid. \nTherefore, overall incremental benefits are taken as a whole. Among the benefits identified by \n ", "8 \nthe financial analysis are additional revenues from incremental sales by the construction of new \ntransmission lines to enable power imports from Turkmenistan to be sold in Afghanistan. The \nanalysis also found the financial internal rate of return under the base case to be 4.76%, which \ncompares  favorably  with  the  estimated  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  0.12%.  The \nsensitivity analysis confirms robust financial sustainability and viability under adverse conditions. \n \n22.   The economic benefits comprise the consumption of imported power by customers that \nused alternative means of power generation, such as diesel, and new consumers. The analysis \nshowed  a  base  case  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  19.47%.  The  sensitivity  analysis \nsuggests sufficient robustness of the project under all tested assumptions. \n \nC.  Governance    \n23.  A financial management assessment (FMA) and procurement capacity assessments \nwere undertaken for DABS in 2015. The FMA found that DABS has not been strictly following \nthe generally accepted accounting principles and conventions in compliance with international \naccounting standards. The FMA states that while premitigation risks are high for DABS and \nsubstantial  for  the  investment  program,  necessary  mitigation  is  under  way.  DABS\u2019  annual \nfinancial  statements  (FY2010--FY2014)  have  been  audited  with  disclaimers  and  qualified \nopinions. Project financial statements have been prepared, audited, and submitted to ADB since \n2010. The 2015 procurement capacity assessment confirms that the country\u2019s procurement \nsystem is weak but improving. The National Procurement Authority undertakes due diligence for \nthe approval of all contract packages, and is chaired by the President of Afghanistan. DABS has \nbeen implementing development partner-assisted projects, including those from ADB and the \nWorld Bank, and the PMO is extremely proficient with the procurement procedures of donors. \n \n24.  The United States government is implementing a capacity support component in DABS \nto introduce a new accounting manual and system. Tranche 1 will (i) make use of the existing \nPMO and maintain separate project accounts, (ii) recruit an international firm to assist in project \nimplementation, (iii) establish direct payment and commitment procedures for disbursements to \ncontractors  and  consultants,  and  (iv)  require  that  DABS  engage  an  independent  auditor \nacceptable to ADB to audit project and corporate financial statements annually in accordance \nwith ADB requirements. \n \n25.  Tranche  1  will  support  DABS  to  develop  its  business  plan,  and  tariff  model  and \nframework by 30 June 2018. Adequate financial and operational covenants will be instituted in \nsubsequent tranches, following the formulation of the business plan and the tariff model. \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and DABS. The FAM details the specific requirements and measures. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n27.  The MFF will improve socioeconomic conditions through increased grid connectivity and \nsubstitution of diesel generators, which will improve the environment. Tranche 1 does not entail \ndirect impacts on affordability or operational employment opportunities. During construction, the \ncontractor will be required to ensure equal opportunities for all social groups, equal pay for \nequal work regardless of gender, and the prohibition of child labor. \n \n28.  The MFF and tranche 1 are categorized as no gender elements, so gender monitoring is \nnot required. The benefits of electrification would benefit all, regardless of gender. \n ", "9 \nE.  Safeguards \n29.  Tranche 1 is category B for environment. Any category A project will be financed as a \nstand-alone investment project instead of through this MFF. DABS, in consultation with other \nexecuting agencies, has prepared the environmental review and assessment framework for the \nMFF and an initial environmental examination report for tranche 1, including an environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). It was \ndisclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 22 October 2015. The environmental impacts are envisaged as \nsite-specific and temporary, and can be mitigated through EMP implementation. Detailed public \nconsultations will be conducted, and the initial environmental examination and the EMP will be \nupdated  before  construction.  EMP  implementation  will  be  reported  through  environmental \nmonitoring reports, submitted to ADB semiannually. Environmental specialists of the consultant \nwill provide support to DABS. Initial climate change screening has rated the project risk medium, \nand the foundation design of towers will be modified to mitigate this risk. \n \n30.  Tranche 1 is category C for indigenous peoples. The field survey found that no ethnic \nminority, as defined by the safeguard policy, is involved or affected. The project is category B for \ninvoluntary  resettlement.  Based  on  the  preliminary  project  design,  a  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement framework for the MFF and a land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) for \ntranche 1 have been prepared in consultation with affected households. These documents were \ndisclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 20 October 2015, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement. Nearly 368 households (3,312 people) will be directly or indirectly affected. However, \nonly 19 households are likely to experience severe impacts of physical displacement. Once the \ncontractor completes the detailed design, DABS will update the LARP and submit it to ADB for \napproval. No civil works will start until DABS has fully implemented the LARP. Implementation of \nthe LARP will be monitored semiannually, with reports submitted to ADB for its review. \n \n31.  DABS will develop and implement a corrective action plan agreed with ADB to rectify \nany default on the safeguard requirements covenanted in the legal agreements or any other \nfailure to comply with safeguards. Such reports and plans will be disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n32.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.30 The integrated benefits and impacts of the \nMFF are expected to outweigh the costs.     \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nReduced availability of  A power purchase and sales agreement between the two countries agrees and confirms \npower supply from  tariff, volume, and penalties until 2028.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS  \n33.  The  government,  including  MEW,  MOMP,  and  DABS,  have  assured  ADB  that \nimplementation of the Energy Supply Improvement Investment Program shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the FAM \nand the grant documents. \n \n34.  The  government,  including  MEW,  MOMP,  and  DABS  have  given  ADB  certain \nundertakings for the MFF, which are set forth in the framework financing agreement.
