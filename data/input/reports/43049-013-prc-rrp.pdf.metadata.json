The  PRC  has  made  impressive \nachievements  in  securing  a  stable  food  supply  for  the  largest  population  in  the  world  due  to \nsubstantial investments in the agriculture sector and in irrigation coverage and efficiency. Since \n2006, the government has invested more in improving technical knowledge and training farmers \nto promote synergies between agricultural infrastructure, technology applications, and farmers\u2019 \ncapabilities.  In  2010,  the  grain  production  grew  to  a  record  high  of  546.4  million  tons. 4 \nNevertheless,  food  security  remains  a  concern  as  the  population  is  expected  to  reach  about \n1.46 billion in 2030. Feeding the growing population with a self-sufficiency rate above 95% will \nrequire increasing grain production by 50 million tons during 2009\u20132020.5 The PRC accounts for \nabout  8%  of  the  world\u2019s  arable  land,  but  it  has  to  feed  about  20%  of  the  world\u2019s  population. \nMeanwhile,  increasing  farmers\u2019  incomes  and  closing  the  income  gap  between  the  rural  and \nurban areas continue to pose challenges to the sector.  \n \n4. \nWater  availability  and  use  efficiency.  Water  availability  remains  one  of  the  greatest \nchallenges to agricultural development in the PRC. Water shortage is a more serious problem in \nthe  Hai  River  and  Yellow  River  basins.  Moreover,  water  scarcity  is  aggravated  by  climate \nchange  that  results  in  more  frequent  droughts  and  floods,  and  subsequent  reductions  in grain \noutput  annually.  The  amount  of  water  allocated  to  agriculture  is  unlikely  to  increase  as  the \ndemand  for  water  from  the  industry  and  domestic  sectors  is  expected  to  continue  increasing \nrapidly.  Because  of  the  political  and  social  importance  of  food  security  in  the  PRC,  securing \nenough  water  for  agriculture  remains  a  government  priority;  thus,  more  attention  needs  to  be \ngiven  to  improving  the  efficiency  of  agricultural  water  use.  The  average  irrigation  water  use \nefficiency  is  about  40%,  and  the  efficiency  in  the  project  area  is  lower  than  the  national \naverage.6 There  is  a  potential  to  increase  water  use  efficiency  in  the  project  area  by  adopting \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  For  the  purposes  of  this  paper,  the  Ningxia  Hui  Autonomous  Region  is  included  in  the  reference  to  project \n\nprovinces. \n\n3  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance.

Beijing. \n\n6  Irrigation water use efficiency refers to the ratio of the net water volume irrigated into  the field and the total water \n\nvolume supplied from the source. \n\n\f2 \n\nwater-saving  irrigation  measures  such  as  canal  lining,  land  leveling,  and  drip  and  sprinkler \nirrigation. \n \n5. \nIrrigation  and  drainage  systems.  The  irrigated  area  in  the  PRC  in  2009  was \n59.3 million  hectares  (ha),  accounting  for  less  than  50%  of  its  total  arable  land.7 Irrigation  and \ndrainage  systems  are  lacking  in  some regions, and many  of the  existing  systems  do  not  work \nefficiently because of poor operation and maintenance (O&M). Many of the canals are over 30 \nyears  old  and  require  maintenance.  The  irrigation  facilities  are  inefficient  in  water  supply,  and \nsome cannot  support  a reliable  supply  of  water for  high-yielding grain production.  In  the  PRC, \nabout  24.4  million  ha  of  cultivated  land  are  prone  to  waterlogging  because  of  deteriorated  or \nlacking  of  drainage  systems.  In  areas  with  high  groundwater  levels  (including  the  project \nprovinces  of  Anhui,  Heilongjiang,  and  Jilin),  crop  production  is  constrained  by  waterlogging. \nFurthermore,  farmers  have  not  participated  effectively  in  the  O&M  of  irrigation  and  drainage \nsystems. \n \n6. \nLand  quality.  Soil fertility has degraded in many regions of the country because of the \nuse of intensive farming techniques over long periods. In northwestern PRC, particularly in the \nYellow  River  basin,  soil  salinity  has  become  a  significant  problem  because  of  natural  factors \n(high  groundwater  tables  and  low  rainfall)  and  human  practices  (poor  irrigation  management, \nrice cultivation, excess water application, and inadequate drainage). Of the total arable land in \nthe PRC, about two thirds is classified as low- or medium-yield land; this indicates a significant \npotential to increase productivity by improving agricultural practices and irrigation and drainage \nsystems.  \n \nAgricultural  support  systems.  Agricultural  extension  services  are  important  in \n7. \nsupporting  agricultural  productivity  and  reducing  poverty  in  the  PRC.  Public  agricultural \nextension  agencies  at  all  administrative  levels  play  a  key  role  in  helping  farmers  access  new \nagricultural technologies and market information. However, they often have limited outreach and \ndo  not  always  deliver  technical  advice  that  corresponds  to  farmers\u2019  needs.  Local  agriculture \nbureaus  are  providing  most  of  the  services,  but  private  extension  providers  (e.g.,  universities \nand private agro-enterprises) have recently emerged. \n \nIn  many  areas,  seeds  are  stored,  processed,  and  handled  improperly  which  leads  to \n8. \npoor  seed  quality,  including  low  germination  rates.  Efficient  fertilizer  use  is  also  a  problem. \nMechanized plowing and harvesting equipment is in short supply in the PRC\u2019s low- and middle-\nincome  farming  areas.  There  is  also  a  shortage  of  expertise  and  training  in  equipment \nmaintenance,  new  product  development,  and  profitable  operation  of  machinery  firms. \nWindbreaks  and  shelterbelt  trees  have  proven  to  be  useful  for  improving  cultivation  and  crop \nyields.  However,  they  are  not  widely  adopted  or  well  maintained  because  of  a  lack  of  funding \nsources.  \n \n9. \nAn  integrated  approach  should  be  adopted  to  address  these  issues.  Infrastructure \ninvestments  remain  in  high  demand  for  irrigation  and  drainage  systems,  farm  service  roads, \nshelterbelt  trees,  etc.  To  promote  effective  O&M  for  irrigation  and  drainage  systems,  more \nguidance  and  assistance  should  be  provided  to  farmer  organizations,  such  as  water  users \nassociations  (WUAs),  to  enhance  their  capabilities.  Moreover,  training  courses  on  advanced \nagricultural practices need to be introduced and promoted to help deal with issues such as low \nsoil fertility, poor seed quality, and the improper application of fertilizers. \n  \n\n                                                \n7  National Bureau of Statistics. 2011.

Five  provinces  and  one  autonomous  region  have \n10. \nbeen  identified  for  the  proposed  project  to  represent  the  national  food-surplus  and  food-\nbalanced regions. Anhui, Heilongjiang, Henan, and Jilin are the top four food-surplus provinces, \naccounting  for  over  28%  of  both  the  country\u2019s  grain  cultivation  area  and  grain  output  in  2008. \nThese four provinces are, therefore, highly important for ensuring the food security of the PRC. \nThe  Yunnan  Province  represents  the  food-balanced  region  of  the  southwest,  and  the  Ningxia \nHui  Autonomous  Region  represents  the  northwest.  They  will  also  contribute  to  national  food \nsecurity  by  maintaining  their  food  self-sufficiency  status.  There  is  a  large  potential  to  increase \nagricultural productivity in these inland provinces because (i) about 60% of their arable land is \ncategorized  as  low-  and  medium-yield  land;  and  (ii)  the  area  is  characterized  by  poorly \nmaintained,  or  incomplete,  or  lack  of  irrigation  and  drainage  systems;  and  poor-quality  farm \nservice roads. The project area provides a reasonable basis on which to develop new concepts \nthat could be extended to the rest of the PRC. Within the project area, 69 CAD counties have \nbeen selected to be included in the project based on geographical, financial, and environmental \ncriteria; as well as their water availability and potential for improving agricultural productivity.  \n \nGovernment  policy  and  ADB\u2019s  strategy.  The  government  has  been  shifting  the \n11. \nemphasis  from  a  growth-oriented  focus  toward  a  broader  and  more  inclusive  rural  and \nsustainable  development.  The  recently  released  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015  stresses \nthe  importance  of  food  security,  agricultural  productivity,  and  water  resources  management.8 \nThe  CAD  program,  introduced  in  1988  by  the  government  to  respond  to  the  nation\u2019s  food \nsecurity problems, represents an integrated approach to addressing the common sector issues. \nWith  direct  funding  from  the  national  government,  the  CAD  program  supports  improving \nirrigation  and  drainage  systems,  soil  quality,  and  agricultural  production.  The  project  is  in  line \nwith  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2011\u20132015  for  the  PRC,  which  supports  the \ngovernment\u2019s  goal  of  building  a  harmonious  society  by  (i)  addressing  the  rising  income \ninequality and the widening regional disparities, and (ii) promoting environmentally sustainable \ndevelopment.9 \n \n12. \nLessons.  Based  on  experience  from  the  PRC\u2019s  CAD  program  and  ADB\u2019s  and  other \ndevelopment partners\u2019 irrigation and drainage projects, the project design includes (i) creating a \nconducive institutional framework, which is essential for improving and sustaining irrigation and \ndrainage  systems;  (ii)  sustaining  O&M  with  user-pay  principle  to  improve project  performance; \n(iii)  ensuring  the  development,  participation,  and  empowerment  of  farmers  and  farmer \norganizations,  which  are  vital  elements  for  the  project\u2019s  success;  and  (iv) improving  farming \ntechnologies  and  marketing,  which  will  be  integral  parts  of  the  project.  Having  approved  more \nthan 10 investment projects since 1990, the World Bank is the major supporter of irrigation and \ndrainage development in the PRC. It has supported the government\u2019s CAD program, particularly \nwith three loan projects in the provinces of Anhui, Henan, Jiangsu, and Shandong which were \nconsidered  successful.  With  numerous  technical  assistance  and  loan  projects,  ADB  has \nextensive  experience  in  agricultural  development  both  in  the  PRC  and  in  other  developing \nmember countries. The project will build on these experiences and best practices to support the \ngovernment\u2019s  CAD  program  by  introducing  (i)  institutional  reform  in  O&M  of  irrigation  and \ndrainage  systems,  (ii)  impact  monitoring  and  evaluation  mechanisms,  (iii)  water  use  efficiency \nand environmental management, and (iv) farmers\u2019 participation and social inclusion. It will also \nintroduce real-water savings and water footprint concepts.10 \n \n\n                                                \n8  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, National Development and Reform Commission. 2011.

Improved  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure  will \nsupport  (i)  upgrading  and  completing  drainage  and  irrigation  systems  covering  an  area  of \n56,588 ha, and increasing the surface irrigated area by 8,650 ha; (ii) developing and upgrading \ngroundwater irrigation systems in 32 counties covering an area of 41,183 ha, and increasing the \nirrigated  area  by  29,979  ha;  (iii) introducing  water-saving  technology  on  74,495  ha  of  surface  \nand  groundwater  irrigation  systems;  and  (iv)  facilitating  the  establishment  and  operation  of  68 \nWUAs.   \n \n16. \nImproved agricultural support will focus on (i) improving the soil quality of about 67,138 \nha  by  land  leveling,  soil  testing,  appropriately  applying  fertilizers,  returning  crop  residue  to \nfarmland, and reducing salinity (particularly in Ningxia); (ii) repairing farm service roads (about \n1,866 kilometers) for field operations and transporting crops; (iii) reforming agricultural practices \nsuch  as  the  wider  distribution and  promotion  of quality  seeds,  and the  provision  of  agricultural \nmachinery  for  field  cultivation  and  harvest  activities;  (iv)  reducing  land  degradation  in  critical \nareas  through  the  expansion  of  shelterbelt  trees;  (v)  demonstrating  modern  agricultural \ntechnologies  such  as  greenhouse  agriculture  and  pollution-free  and/or  green  agriculture;  and \n(vi)  developing  farmer  capacity  through  training  and  by  establishing  117  farmer  professional \nassociations (FPAs) or cooperatives on balanced fertilization application, farming technologies, \nand marketing skills.  \n \n17. \nImproved  project  management  will  focus  on  (i)  increasing  the  capacity  of  the  six \nprovincial  and  69  county  CAD  offices  by  providing  training  and  capacity  development,  and \nnecessary equipment; (ii) upgrading the information management system of the State Office for \nCAD (SOCAD) in the Ministry of Finance, and establishing a project performance management \nsystem;  (iii)  establishing  expert  teams  at  national,  provincial,  and  county  levels  to  provide \ntechnical  advice  for  project  implementation  and  safeguards  management;  (iv)  conducting \nresearch and studies on water conservation, farmer participation, and farming technologies; and \n(v) training on real-water savings and reducing water footprints. \n \nD. \n \n18. \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual.11 \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $354.83 million (Table 1). The detailed cost estimates by \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\n19. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $200  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  to  help  finance  the  project.  The  loan  will  have  a  20-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  5  years;  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; \nand  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  loan  and  project  agreements.

The provincial and local governments will finance \n$119.86  million,  or  33.78%  of  the  total  project  costs,  including  the  balance  of  civil  works,  and \n\n                                                \n12 The amount of taxes and duties to be financed in the project has been determined based on the principles that (i) \nthe amount of taxes and duties financed by the ADB loan which representing about 2% of the project cost, does \nnot represent an excessive share of the project; (ii) the taxes and duties apply only with respect to ADB-financed \nexpenditures; and (iii) the financing of taxes and duties is material and relevant to the success of the project since \nthe percentage of some financed expenditures needs 100%. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\ftraining and capacity development; research and monitoring; land acquisition and resettlement; \nenvironmental management and monitoring; surveys, design, and supervision; taxes and duties, \nand the contingencies. The beneficiaries will finance $26.81 million, or 7.56% of the total project \ncosts, through cash and in-kind contributions to land improvement and small canal dredging. \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n21. \nSOCAD  in  the  Ministry  of  Finance  will  be  the  executing  agency  responsible  for  the \noverall planning, coordination, and management of the project. A national project management \noffice  (PMO)  has  been  set  up  within  SOCAD  to  take care  of  the  daily  project  preparation  and \nmanagement.  A  provincial  PMO  has  been  established  in  each  participating  province.  The \nexisting  county  CAD  offices  will  serve  as  the  county  PMOs,  which  will  be  responsible  for  the \ndaily implementation of project activities, quality control, procurement of works and goods,  and \nmaintenance of project accounts.  \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\n22. \nthe project administration manual (footnote 11). \n \n\nAspects \nImplementation period  July 2013\u2013June 2018 (5 years)  \nEstimated completion \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements \n\ndate \n\nPeriod of utilization \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body \n\n30 June 2018 \nUntil 31 December 2018 \n\nMinistry of Finance and National Development and Reform \nCommission \n\n(ii)  Executing agency  SOCAD \n(iii) Key implementing \n\nagencies \n\nThe provincial PMOs of Anhui, Heilongjiang, Henan, Jilin, and Yunnan \nprovinces  and  the  Ningxia  Hui  Autonomous  Region  will  assume  the \nresponsibility  for  (i)  programming,  planning,  and  coordinating  project \nactivities  at  the  provincial  level;  (ii)  implementing  project  activities \nrelating  to  technical  guidance  and  training  at  provincial  level;  (iii) \nprocuring  goods  at  provincial  level,  and  (iv)  monitoring  and  reporting \nprovincial project performance. \n\nEach  county  CAD  office,  as  the  county  PMO,  will  be  responsible  for \ndaily  implementation  of  project  activities,  quality  control,  procurement \nof civil works and goods, and maintenance of project accounts. \nThe  county  PMO  will  serve  as  the  implementing  unit  for  each  of  the \nproject counties. \nNational competitive \nbidding \n\nAbout 640 contracts for \ncivil works and goods \n\n$195,193,800 \n\nShopping \n\nAbout 280 contracts for \ncivil works, goods, and \ntraining  \n\nof national consulting \nservices \n\n$16,199,300 \n\n$2,453,800 \n\nAll financed  \nby the \ngovernment \n\n \nConsulting services \n\nCommunity participation  Small on-farm works \nGovernment procedures  About 780 person-months \n\n(iv) Implementation \n\nunit \nProcurement \n\n6 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\fAspects \nAdvance contracting \nand retroactive \nfinancing \n\nDisbursement  \n\nArrangements \nSOCAD  has  requested  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing \nto  enable  early  commencement  of  procurement  of  civil  works,  goods, \nand  training.  Retroactive financing will  apply  to up  to  $40 million,  with \nrespect  to  expenditures  incurred  before  loan  effectiveness  but  not \nmore  than  12 months  before  the  signing  of  the  loan  and  project \nagreements. \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nThe \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and \ndetailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  between  ADB  and \nthe \ngovernment. \n\nloan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  CAD  =  comprehensive  agricultural  development,  PMO  =  project  management \noffice, SOCAD = State Office for Comprehensive Agricultural Development. \na  The  staff  review  meeting  was  conducted  in  2011,  and  the  discussion  and  agreement  on  disbursement  with  the \n\ngovernment was based on the Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). \n\nSource: ADB and SOCAD estimates. \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nThe  economic  analysis  of  the  project  has  been  carried  out  using  with-  and  without-\n23. \nproject scenarios following the relevant ADB guidelines. Crop budget data were obtained on a \nprovincial  basis  from  the  domestic  feasibility  study  data.  The  economic  analysis  indicates  that \nthe project is economically viable with an overall economic internal rate of return of 20.3% and \nan  economic  net  present  value  of  CNY888.1  million.  The  sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the \nproject is generally robust. The financial analysis indicates that an overall financial internal rate \nof return is 18.3%, with the rates for individual provinces ranging from 10.5% for Heilongjiang to \n31.1% for Anhui\u2014all well above the weighted average cost of capital of 4.19%.  \n\n24. \nProject  sustainability  has  been  assessed,  including  assessment  of (i) the incentives for \ngovernment  agencies  and  users  to  participate  in  the  project,  (ii)  the  fiscal  capacity  of \nparticipating  provinces  and  counties  to  finance  counterpart  expenditures,  and  (iii)  the \ninstitutional  and  financial  arrangements  for  sustainable  operations  of  the  project  facilities.  The \nfiscal impact of counterpart funding for implementation will be insignificant compared to the total \nprovincial  and  local  fiscal  revenues.  All  project  provinces  and  counties  have  committed  to \nprovide  an  adequate  budget  to  support  the  project.  Local  government  agencies  and  farmers \nhave  demonstrated  strong  interest  in  participating  in the  project.  Farmers  will  benefit  from  the \nincreased income through enhanced farm productivity. The FPAs and WUAs will be established, \nand lead farmers will be contracted through competitive means to take over the responsibility of \nO&M of small project facilities.  \n\nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n25. \nThe  institutional  and  capacity  analysis  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies \nfound  that  (i)  they  have  extensive  experience  in  implementing  domestically  financed  CAD \nprojects;  (ii)  SOCAD  and  four  of  five  provinces  (except  Yunnan)  and  one  autonomous  region \nhave  implemented  CAD  projects  financed  by  external  agencies,  including  the  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational Cooperation and the World Bank; and (iii) they are qualified to manage the project \nin terms of technical, financial, and managerial capacity. The established network of provincial \nand county CAD offices will make it organizationally possible to implement the project using an \nintegrated  CAD  model  where  lessons  learned  in any  project  area  can  be  effectively  promoted \nelsewhere. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n \n\nThe  financial  management  assessment  shows  that  (i)  the  executing  and  implementing \n26. \nagencies  are  capable  of  carrying  out  satisfactory  accounting  and  financial  reporting  for  the \nproject, and (ii) internal controls and audits are generally acceptable. The procurement capacity \nassessment indicates that (i) the established arrangements are in place in the PRC and project \nprovinces to handle the various stages of procurement, including preparation of bid documents, \ntender  invitation,  bid  evaluation,  contract  award,  construction  supervision,  and  contract \nperformance  monitoring;  (ii)  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  have  experience  in \nundertaking  domestically \nirrigation  and  agricultural  development  projects  and \nexternally  financed  projects  (except  Yunnan);  and  (iii)  the  monitoring  and  internal  controls \nregarding procurement are generally in place. Because SOCAD and the provinces have limited \nexperience \ntraining  during \nimplementation  on  procedures \nfinancial  management,  procurement,  and \ndisbursement. \n\nimplementing  ADB-financed  projects,  ADB  will  provide \n\nfinanced \n\nrelating \n\nto \n\n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  SOCAD.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 11). \n\nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n28. \nRural  households,  particularly  farmer  households,  are  still  lagging  behind  compared  to \nthe  urban  social  and  economic  development  in  the  PRC.  The  project  will  improve  the  income \nand  sustainability  of  livelihoods  of  about  1.23  million  rural  people  in  about  500  villages  in  the \nproject  area  by  providing  better  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure  and  agricultural  support \nservices.  Most  of  the  69  project  counties  are  major  grain  production  areas,  with  13  of  them \nclassified as national and six as provincial key counties for poverty reduction.    \n\n29. \n  Gender.  A  gender  analysis  was  carried  out  during  project  preparation.  The  project \nsupports  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  main  gender  issues  in  the  rural  PRC  and  the \nproject  area  are  women\u2019s  under-represented  participation  in  decision  making  and  increasing \nworkloads  because  they,  and  older  persons,  are  left  on  the  farm  while  many  men  and  young \npeople  go  elsewhere  for  better  job  opportunities.  A  gender  action  plan  has  been  prepared  to \ndescribe how the project will benefit and empower women and work toward gender equality; it \nincludes  detailed  activities,  implementation  responsibilities,  and  expected  benefits  from  these \nactivities.13 The plan will be implemented and monitored throughout project implementation. The \ngender action plan, together with the ethnic minority development plans (EMDPs), will ensure, \nwhere applicable, that specific interests of ethnic women farmers are respected and benefits to \nthem achieved in a culturally appropriate manner. The All-China Women\u2019s Federation will take \npart  in  project  implementation,  particularly  in  steering  committees;  and  provide  oversight  to \nensure women are represented effectively in the villages. \n\nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n30. \nEnvironment.  ADB  classifies the  project  as category  B.  Based on  the requirements of \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  SOCAD  has  prepared  an  initial  environmental \nexamination  and  a  consolidated  environmental  management  plan.  These  documents  are \nconsistent  with  and  complement  the  domestic  environmental  impact  assessment  report  that \nmeets  the  requirements  of  the  PRC\u2019s  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  Law  (2003)  and \nrelevant regulations.14  \n\n                                                \n13  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, National People\u2019s Congress. 2003. Environmental Impact Law of \n\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China. Beijing.  \n\n\fThe  environmental  assessment  confirmed  that  the  project  will  generate  multiple \n31. \nenvironmental  benefits. The  major  anticipated  environmental  benefits  include (i)  water  savings \nfrom existing irrigated lands, (ii) reduced use of agrochemicals per hectare, (iii) reduced soil loss \nand  improved  soil  quality,  (iv)  reduced  salinization  and  waterlogging,  (v)  recovery  of  plastic \nmulch,  and  (vi)  increased  climate  resilience.  No  major  adverse  impacts  were  identified. \nConstruction and rehabilitation works are small and relatively simple. Some counties, which are \nlocated  in  areas  where  water  resources  are  more  abundant,  may  increase  their  overall  water \nuse.  Groundwater  will  only  be  used  in  areas  where  sufficient  recharge  is  available,  and  a \ndetailed  monitoring  program  will  be  implemented.15 No  project  activities  will  be  carried  out  in \nenvironmentally sensitive areas. It is expected that all impacts will be prevented or minimized to \nan  acceptable  level  through  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan  and \nmonitoring program. \n\n32. \nIndigenous peoples. The project is classified as category B. According to a preliminary \nscreening,  sizeable  ethnic  minority  populations  live  in  about  16  counties  in  Heilongjiang,  Jilin, \nand  Yunnan  provinces  and  the  Ningxia  Hui  Autonomous  Region;  and  are  among  the  project \nbeneficiaries.  Based  on  the  social  assessment,  the  project  is  not  expected  to  have  significant \nnegative  impacts  on  ethnic  minorities.  The  detailed  design  of  the  subprojects  will  be  prepared \nwhen the  county  PMOs get ready for  their  implementation. Therefore,  it  is  not  yet  possible for \nthe  implementing  agencies  to  prepare  the  EMDPs.  Instead,  an  ethnic  minority  planning \nframework has been prepared following the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009).  The  framework  explains  under  which  conditions  an  EMDP  has  to  be  prepared  and \nspecifies the detailed screening process, the procedural requirements, the outline of the EMDP, \nmonitoring  of  its  implementation,  and  the  grievance  redress  mechanism.  Measures  will  be \ndesigned  to  ensure  that  the  ethnic  minority  beneficiaries  have  been  consulted  and  can \nparticipate fully and derive benefits in a culturally appropriate manner. Special emphasis will be \nplaced on ethnic minority participation during the FPA and WUA formulation and in the provision \nof training and extension services.  \n\n33. \nResettlement.  Although  a  potential  exists  for  numerous  small  land  acquisition  impacts \nunder the project, overall the project will have significant impact to very few households, if any. \nThe project is therefore classified as category B. The detailed design of the subprojects will be \nprepared  when  the  county  PMOs  get  ready  for  their  implementation.  Therefore,  it  is  not  yet \npossible  for  the  implementing  agencies  to  conduct  detailed  screening  and  prepare  the \nresettlement  plans.  Instead,  a  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared.  The  framework \nexplains  under  which  conditions  a  resettlement  plan  has  to  be  prepared.  It  also  specifies  the \ndetailed  screening  process,  procedural  requirements,  outline  of  the  resettlement  plan, \nmonitoring  of  its  implementation,  and  grievance  redress  mechanism.  The  initial  screening  of \nproject  sites  for  resettlement  impacts  indicates  that  there  would  be  little  permanent  land  loss \nand no house demolition. All impacts (canals and ditches, farm access roads, tube wells, etc.) \nwill  be  within  the  villages  on  land  that  remains  under  village  ownership,  so  no  formal  land \nacquisition will be necessary. The impact of land loss, temporary or permanent, to each affected \nhousehold will be minor, as construction will mainly upgrade and use existing structures. Most \nland that will be needed temporarily or permanently for the project will be compensated through \nland adjustments in the villages.  \n\nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n34. \nThe  project  has  some  potential  environmental,  governance,  implementation,  and \ninstitutional risks. The project provides adequate measures to mitigate these risks and verify the \nassumptions of achieving the project impact, outcome, and benefits. Major risks and mitigating \n\n                                                \n15 Some counties were dropped from the project during project preparation due to water availability issues. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nmeasures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk \nmanagement plan.16 \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nRisks \nInadequate \nmaintenance of \nirrigation and \ndrainage systems \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe project will support the establishment and empowerment of farmer \nprofessional associations and water users associations to take \nresponsibility of O&M of the project facilities. The project management \noffices will also contract small facilities, such as tube wells to lead \nfarmers, for O&M through a competitive bidding process.  \n\nGroundwater \noverdraft in some \nlocations \n\nGroundwater will only be used in areas where sufficient recharge is \navailable, and a detailed monitoring program will be implemented to \nensure no overdraft of groundwater.  \n\nWeak capacity of the \ncounty implementing \nagencies \n\nThe project will provide adequate capacity development and training \nprograms to improve the knowledge and capacity of the executing and \nimplementing agencies in project implementation and management, \nparticularly on procurement, financial management, disbursement, and \nsafeguards monitoring and management. \n\nO&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nIV. \n\n ASSURANCES \n\nThe government and SOCAD have assured ADB that the implementation of the project \n35. \nwill conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards,  gender,  procurement,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  the  project \nadministration manual (footnote 11) and loan documents. \n\nThe  government  and  SOCAD  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \n\n36. \nproject, which are set forth in the loan and project agreements. \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nto \n\nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China \n\n37. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \nthe  Comprehensive  Agricultural \n$200,000,000 \nDevelopment  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate-based  lending  facility;  for  a  term  of  20 \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements \npresented to the Board. \n\nfor \n\n \n \n\n \n25 October 2012 \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n                                                \n16  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\n \n\n \n\nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \nEnhanced food \nsecurity in the \nPRC  \n \n \n \n\nOutcome \nIncreased \nagricultural \nproductivity in the \nproject area \n \n \n \n\nPerformance Indicators and \nTargets with Baselines \n\n \nGrain output in Anhui, \nHeilongjiang, Henan, and Jilin \nprovinces increased from 500,700 \ntons in 2009 to 662,700 tons in \n2020; and in the Ningxia Hui \nAutonomous Region and the \nYunnan Province from 162,300 \ntons in 2009 to 211,300 tons in \n2020 in the project area  \n \nAverage per capita income for \nfarmers increased by 11% from \nCNY3,614 in 2010 to CNY4,012 \nin 2020 in constant 2010 values \nin the project area \n \nGrain yields increased by 27% \nfrom 5.74 tons/ha in 2010 to 7.31 \ntons/ha by 2018, cash crop yields \n(excluding vegetables) by 27% \nfrom 1.90 tons/ha in 2010 to 2.41 \ntons/ha by 2018, and vegetables \nby 27% from 25.2 tons/ha in 2010 \nto 32.0 tons/ha by 2018 \n \nOverall irrigation water use \nefficiency increased from 40% in \n2010 to 45% by 2018 for surface \nwater irrigation systems, and from \n60% in 2010 to 75% by 2018 for \ngroundwater irrigation systems \n\nOutputs \n1.
