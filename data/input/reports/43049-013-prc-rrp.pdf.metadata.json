I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Comprehensive Agricultural Development \nProject.1 \n \n2.  The  project  will  support  the  government\u2019s  comprehensive  agricultural  development \n(CAD) program in five provinces (Anhui, Heilongjiang, Henan, Jilin, and Yunnan) and one \nautonomous region (Ningxia Hui) to improve agricultural productivity and enhance the nation\u2019s \nfood security.2 This document is based on the consultants\u2019 studies, surveys, and reports; the \nsurveys and reports of the executing and implementing agencies; the findings of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) missions; and discussions with government agencies, stakeholders, \nbeneficiaries, and development partners.3   \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Food  security  and  agricultural  development.  The  PRC  has  made  impressive \nachievements in securing a stable food supply for the largest population in the world due to \nsubstantial investments in the agriculture sector and in irrigation coverage and efficiency. Since \n2006, the government has invested more in improving technical knowledge and training farmers \nto promote synergies between agricultural infrastructure, technology applications, and farmers\u2019 \ncapabilities.  In  2010,  the  grain  production  grew  to  a  record  high  of  546.4  million  tons.4 \nNevertheless, food security remains a concern as the population is expected to reach about \n1.46 billion in 2030. Feeding the growing population with a self-sufficiency rate above 95% will \nrequire increasing grain production by 50 million tons during 2009\u20132020.5 The PRC accounts for \nabout 8% of the world\u2019s arable land, but it has to feed about 20% of the world\u2019s population. \nMeanwhile, increasing farmers\u2019 incomes and closing the income gap between the rural and \nurban areas continue to pose challenges to the sector.  \n \n4.  Water availability and use efficiency. Water availability remains one of the greatest \nchallenges to agricultural development in the PRC. Water shortage is a more serious problem in \nthe Hai River and Yellow River basins. Moreover, water scarcity is aggravated by climate \nchange that results in more frequent droughts and floods, and subsequent reductions in grain \noutput annually. The amount of water allocated to agriculture is unlikely to increase as the \ndemand for water from the industry and domestic sectors is expected to continue increasing \nrapidly. Because of the political and social importance of food security in the PRC, securing \nenough water for agriculture remains a government priority; thus, more attention needs to be \ngiven to improving the efficiency of agricultural water use. The average irrigation water use \nefficiency  is  about  40%,  and  the  efficiency  in  the  project  area  is  lower  than  the  national \naverage.6 There is a potential to increase water use efficiency in the project area by adopting \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  For the purposes of this paper, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is included in the reference to project \nprovinces. \n3  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance.

Beijing. \n6  Irrigation water use efficiency refers to the ratio of the net water volume irrigated into the field and the total water \nvolume supplied from the source. ", "2 \nwater-saving irrigation measures such as canal lining, land leveling, and drip and sprinkler \nirrigation. \n \n5.  Irrigation  and  drainage  systems.  The  irrigated  area  in  the  PRC  in  2009  was \n59.3 million hectares (ha), accounting for less than 50% of its total arable land.7 Irrigation and \ndrainage systems are lacking in some regions, and many of the existing systems do not work \nefficiently because of poor operation and maintenance (O&M). Many of the canals are over 30 \nyears old and require maintenance. The irrigation facilities are inefficient in water supply, and \nsome cannot support a reliable supply of water for high-yielding grain production. In the PRC, \nabout 24.4 million ha of cultivated land are prone to waterlogging because of deteriorated or \nlacking  of  drainage  systems.  In  areas  with  high  groundwater  levels  (including  the  project \nprovinces of Anhui, Heilongjiang, and Jilin), crop production is constrained by waterlogging. \nFurthermore, farmers have not participated effectively in the O&M of irrigation and drainage \nsystems. \n \n6.  Land quality. Soil fertility has degraded in many regions of the country because of the \nuse of intensive farming techniques over long periods. In northwestern PRC, particularly in the \nYellow River basin, soil salinity has become a significant problem because of natural factors \n(high groundwater tables and low rainfall) and human practices (poor irrigation management, \nrice cultivation, excess water application, and inadequate drainage). Of the total arable land in \nthe PRC, about two thirds is classified as low- or medium-yield land; this indicates a significant \npotential to increase productivity by improving agricultural practices and irrigation and drainage \nsystems.  \n \n7.  Agricultural  support  systems.  Agricultural  extension  services  are  important  in \nsupporting  agricultural  productivity  and  reducing  poverty  in  the  PRC.  Public  agricultural \nextension agencies at all administrative levels play a key role in helping farmers access new \nagricultural technologies and market information. However, they often have limited outreach and \ndo not always deliver technical advice that corresponds to farmers\u2019 needs. Local agriculture \nbureaus are providing most of the services, but private extension providers (e.g., universities \nand private agro-enterprises) have recently emerged. \n \n8.  In many areas, seeds are stored, processed, and handled improperly which leads to \npoor seed quality, including low germination rates. Efficient fertilizer use is also a problem. \nMechanized plowing and harvesting equipment is in short supply in the PRC\u2019s low- and middle-\nincome  farming  areas.  There  is  also  a  shortage  of  expertise  and  training  in  equipment \nmaintenance,  new  product  development,  and  profitable  operation  of  machinery  firms. \nWindbreaks and shelterbelt trees have proven to be useful for improving cultivation and crop \nyields. However, they are not widely adopted or well maintained because of a lack of funding \nsources.  \n \n9.  An  integrated  approach  should  be  adopted  to  address  these  issues.  Infrastructure \ninvestments remain in high demand for irrigation and drainage systems, farm service roads, \nshelterbelt trees, etc. To promote effective O&M for irrigation and drainage systems, more \nguidance and assistance should be provided to farmer organizations, such as water users \nassociations (WUAs), to enhance their capabilities. Moreover, training courses on advanced \nagricultural practices need to be introduced and promoted to help deal with issues such as low \nsoil fertility, poor seed quality, and the improper application of fertilizers. \n  \n                                                \n7  National Bureau of Statistics. 2011.

Five provinces and one autonomous region have \nbeen  identified  for  the  proposed  project  to  represent  the  national  food-surplus  and  food-\nbalanced regions. Anhui, Heilongjiang, Henan, and Jilin are the top four food-surplus provinces, \naccounting for over 28% of both the country\u2019s grain cultivation area and grain output in 2008. \nThese four provinces are, therefore, highly important for ensuring the food security of the PRC. \nThe Yunnan Province represents the food-balanced region of the southwest, and the Ningxia \nHui Autonomous Region represents the northwest. They will also contribute to national food \nsecurity by maintaining their food self-sufficiency status. There is a large potential to increase \nagricultural productivity in these inland provinces because (i) about 60% of their arable land is \ncategorized  as  low-  and  medium-yield  land;  and  (ii)  the  area  is  characterized  by  poorly \nmaintained, or incomplete, or lack of irrigation and drainage systems; and poor-quality farm \nservice roads. The project area provides a reasonable basis on which to develop new concepts \nthat could be extended to the rest of the PRC. Within the project area, 69 CAD counties have \nbeen selected to be included in the project based on geographical, financial, and environmental \ncriteria; as well as their water availability and potential for improving agricultural productivity.  \n \n11.  Government  policy  and  ADB\u2019s  strategy.  The  government  has  been  shifting  the \nemphasis  from  a  growth-oriented  focus  toward  a  broader  and  more  inclusive  rural  and \nsustainable development. The recently released Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015 stresses \nthe importance of food security, agricultural productivity, and water resources management.8 \nThe CAD program, introduced in 1988 by the government to respond to the nation\u2019s food \nsecurity problems, represents an integrated approach to addressing the common sector issues. \nWith  direct  funding  from  the  national  government,  the  CAD  program  supports  improving \nirrigation and drainage systems, soil quality, and agricultural production. The project is in line \nwith  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2011\u20132015  for  the  PRC,  which  supports  the \ngovernment\u2019s  goal  of  building  a  harmonious  society  by  (i)  addressing  the  rising  income \ninequality and the widening regional disparities, and (ii) promoting environmentally sustainable \ndevelopment.9 \n \n12.  Lessons. Based on experience from the PRC\u2019s CAD program and ADB\u2019s and other \ndevelopment partners\u2019 irrigation and drainage projects, the project design includes (i) creating a \nconducive institutional framework, which is essential for improving and sustaining irrigation and \ndrainage systems; (ii) sustaining O&M with user-pay principle to improve project performance; \n(iii)  ensuring  the  development,  participation,  and  empowerment  of  farmers  and  farmer \norganizations, which are vital elements for the project\u2019s success; and (iv) improving farming \ntechnologies and marketing, which will be integral parts of the project. Having approved more \nthan 10 investment projects since 1990, the World Bank is the major supporter of irrigation and \ndrainage development in the PRC. It has supported the government\u2019s CAD program, particularly \nwith three loan projects in the provinces of Anhui, Henan, Jiangsu, and Shandong which were \nconsidered  successful.  With  numerous  technical  assistance  and  loan  projects,  ADB  has \nextensive experience in agricultural development both in the PRC and in other developing \nmember countries. The project will build on these experiences and best practices to support the \ngovernment\u2019s  CAD  program  by  introducing  (i)  institutional  reform  in O&M  of  irrigation  and \ndrainage systems, (ii) impact monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, (iii) water use efficiency \nand environmental management, and (iv) farmers\u2019 participation and social inclusion. It will also \nintroduce real-water savings and water footprint concepts.10 \n \n                                                \n8  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, National Development and Reform Commission. 2011.

Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact of the project will be enhanced food security in the PRC. The outcome will be \nincreased agricultural productivity in the project area. \n \nC.  Outputs \n14.  The project includes the following outputs to be implemented through subprojects in the \nproject counties: (i) improved irrigation and drainage infrastructure; (ii) improved agricultural \nsupport; and (iii) improved project management.  \n \n15.  Improved irrigation and drainage infrastructure will focus on improving the irrigation and \ndrainage  of  about  117,000  ha  of  land.  Improved  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure  will \nsupport  (i)  upgrading  and  completing  drainage  and  irrigation  systems  covering  an  area of \n56,588 ha, and increasing the surface irrigated area by 8,650 ha; (ii) developing and upgrading \ngroundwater irrigation systems in 32 counties covering an area of 41,183 ha, and increasing the \nirrigated area by 29,979 ha; (iii) introducing water-saving technology on 74,495 ha of surface  \nand groundwater irrigation systems; and (iv) facilitating the establishment and operation of 68 \nWUAs.   \n \n16.  Improved agricultural support will focus on (i) improving the soil quality of about 67,138 \nha by land leveling, soil testing, appropriately applying fertilizers, returning crop residue to \nfarmland, and reducing salinity (particularly in Ningxia); (ii) repairing farm service roads (about \n1,866 kilometers) for field operations and transporting crops; (iii) reforming agricultural practices \nsuch as the wider distribution and promotion of quality seeds, and the provision of agricultural \nmachinery for field cultivation and harvest activities; (iv) reducing land degradation in critical \nareas  through  the  expansion  of  shelterbelt  trees;  (v)  demonstrating  modern  agricultural \ntechnologies such as greenhouse agriculture and pollution-free and/or green agriculture; and \n(vi) developing farmer capacity through training and by establishing 117 farmer professional \nassociations (FPAs) or cooperatives on balanced fertilization application, farming technologies, \nand marketing skills.  \n \n17.  Improved  project  management  will  focus  on  (i)  increasing  the  capacity  of  the  six \nprovincial and 69 county CAD offices by providing training and capacity development, and \nnecessary equipment; (ii) upgrading the information management system of the State Office for \nCAD (SOCAD) in the Ministry of Finance, and establishing a project performance management \nsystem;  (iii)  establishing  expert  teams  at  national,  provincial,  and  county  levels  to  provide \ntechnical  advice  for  project  implementation  and  safeguards  management;  (iv)  conducting \nresearch and studies on water conservation, farmer participation, and farming technologies; and \n(v) training on real-water savings and reducing water footprints. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n18.  The project is estimated to cost $354.83 million (Table 1). The detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual.11 \n19.  The government  has  requested  a  loan  of $200  million from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 20-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years;  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; \nand other terms and conditions set forth in the loan and project agreements. Based on the \n                                                \n11  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "5 \nabove loan terms and borrower\u2019s choice of straight-line repayment method, the average loan \nmaturity is 12.75 years, and there will be no maturity premium payable to ADB. The government \nhas allocated the loan proceeds as follows: $30 million each to the Ningxia Hui Autonomous \nRegion and the Yunnan Province; and $35 million each to the Anhui, Heilongjiang, Henan, and \nJilin  provinces.  The  government  will  make  the  loan  proceeds  available  to  the  provincial \ngovernments, which in turn will make the loan proceeds available to the county governments \nthrough the prefecture governments on a grant basis and with proper arrangements acceptable \nto ADB. \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \nItem    Amounta \nA.

The sensitivity analysis shows that the \nproject is generally robust. The financial analysis indicates that an overall financial internal rate \nof return is 18.3%, with the rates for individual provinces ranging from 10.5% for Heilongjiang to \n31.1% for Anhui\u2014all well above the weighted average cost of capital of 4.19%.  \n24.  Project sustainability has been assessed, including assessment of (i) the incentives for \ngovernment  agencies  and  users  to  participate  in  the  project,  (ii)  the  fiscal  capacity  of \nparticipating  provinces  and  counties  to  finance  counterpart  expenditures,  and  (iii)  the \ninstitutional and financial arrangements for sustainable operations of the project facilities. The \nfiscal impact of counterpart funding for implementation will be insignificant compared to the total \nprovincial and local fiscal revenues. All project provinces and counties have committed to \nprovide an adequate budget to support the project. Local government agencies and farmers \nhave demonstrated strong interest in participating in the project. Farmers will benefit from the \nincreased income through enhanced farm productivity. The FPAs and WUAs will be established, \nand lead farmers will be contracted through competitive means to take over the responsibility of \nO&M of small project facilities.  \nB.  Governance \n25.  The  institutional  and  capacity  analysis  of the executing  and  implementing  agencies \nfound  that  (i)  they  have  extensive  experience  in  implementing  domestically  financed  CAD \nprojects; (ii) SOCAD and four of five provinces (except Yunnan) and one autonomous region \nhave implemented CAD projects financed by external agencies, including the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation and the World Bank; and (iii) they are qualified to manage the project \nin terms of technical, financial, and managerial capacity. The established network of provincial \nand county CAD offices will make it organizationally possible to implement the project using an \nintegrated CAD model where lessons learned in any project area can be effectively promoted \nelsewhere. \n ", "8 \n26.  The financial management assessment shows that (i) the executing and implementing \nagencies are capable of carrying out satisfactory accounting and financial reporting for the \nproject, and (ii) internal controls and audits are generally acceptable. The procurement capacity \nassessment indicates that (i) the established arrangements are in place in the PRC and project \nprovinces to handle the various stages of procurement, including preparation of bid documents, \ntender  invitation,  bid  evaluation,  contract  award,  construction  supervision,  and  contract \nperformance  monitoring;  (ii)  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  have  experience  in \nundertaking  domestically  financed  irrigation  and  agricultural  development  projects  and \nexternally  financed  projects  (except  Yunnan);  and  (iii)  the  monitoring  and  internal  controls \nregarding procurement are generally in place. Because SOCAD and the provinces have limited \nexperience  implementing  ADB-financed  projects,  ADB  will  provide  training  during \nimplementation  on  procedures  relating  to  financial  management,  procurement,  and \ndisbursement. \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  SOCAD.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 11). \nC.  Poverty and Social \n28.  Rural households, particularly farmer households, are still lagging behind compared to \nthe urban social and economic development in the PRC. The project will improve the income \nand sustainability of livelihoods of about 1.23 million rural people in about 500 villages in the \nproject area by providing better irrigation and drainage infrastructure and agricultural support \nservices. Most of the 69 project counties are major grain production areas, with 13 of them \nclassified as national and six as provincial key counties for poverty reduction.    \n29.    Gender. A gender analysis was carried out during project preparation. The project \nsupports effective gender mainstreaming. The main gender issues in the rural PRC and the \nproject area are women\u2019s under-represented participation in decision making and increasing \nworkloads because they, and older persons, are left on the farm while many men and young \npeople go elsewhere for better job opportunities. A gender action plan has been prepared to \ndescribe how the project will benefit and empower women and work toward gender equality; it \nincludes detailed activities, implementation responsibilities, and expected benefits from these \nactivities.13 The plan will be implemented and monitored throughout project implementation. The \ngender action plan, together with the ethnic minority development plans (EMDPs), will ensure, \nwhere applicable, that specific interests of ethnic women farmers are respected and benefits to \nthem achieved in a culturally appropriate manner. The All-China Women\u2019s Federation will take \npart in project implementation, particularly in steering committees; and provide oversight to \nensure women are represented effectively in the villages. \nD.  Safeguards \n30.  Environment. ADB classifies the project as category B. Based on the requirements of \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  SOCAD  has  prepared  an  initial  environmental \nexamination  and  a  consolidated  environmental  management  plan.  These  documents  are \nconsistent with and complement the domestic environmental impact assessment report that \nmeets  the  requirements  of  the  PRC\u2019s  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  Law  (2003)  and \nrelevant regulations.14  \n                                                \n13  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, National People\u2019s Congress. 2003. Environmental Impact Law of \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China. Beijing.  \n \n ", "9 \n31.  The  environmental  assessment  confirmed  that  the  project  will  generate  multiple \nenvironmental benefits. The major anticipated environmental benefits include (i) water savings \nfrom existing irrigated lands, (ii) reduced use of agrochemicals per hectare, (iii) reduced soil loss \nand improved soil quality, (iv) reduced salinization and waterlogging, (v) recovery of plastic \nmulch,  and  (vi)  increased  climate  resilience.  No  major  adverse  impacts  were  identified. \nConstruction and rehabilitation works are small and relatively simple. Some counties, which are \nlocated in areas where water resources are more abundant, may increase their overall water \nuse. Groundwater will only be used in areas where sufficient recharge is available, and a \ndetailed monitoring program will be implemented.15 No project activities will be carried out in \nenvironmentally sensitive areas. It is expected that all impacts will be prevented or minimized to \nan  acceptable  level  through  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan  and \nmonitoring program. \n32.  Indigenous peoples. The project is classified as category B. According to a preliminary \nscreening, sizeable ethnic minority populations live in about 16 counties in Heilongjiang, Jilin, \nand Yunnan provinces and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region; and are among the project \nbeneficiaries. Based on the social assessment, the project is not expected to have significant \nnegative impacts on ethnic minorities. The detailed design of the subprojects will be prepared \nwhen the county PMOs get ready for their implementation. Therefore, it is not yet possible for \nthe  implementing  agencies  to  prepare  the  EMDPs.  Instead,  an  ethnic  minority  planning \nframework has been prepared following the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). The framework explains under which conditions an EMDP has to be prepared and \nspecifies the detailed screening process, the procedural requirements, the outline of the EMDP, \nmonitoring of its implementation, and the grievance redress mechanism. Measures will be \ndesigned  to  ensure  that  the  ethnic  minority  beneficiaries  have  been  consulted  and  can \nparticipate fully and derive benefits in a culturally appropriate manner. Special emphasis will be \nplaced on ethnic minority participation during the FPA and WUA formulation and in the provision \nof training and extension services.  \n33.  Resettlement. Although a potential exists for numerous small land acquisition impacts \nunder the project, overall the project will have significant impact to very few households, if any. \nThe project is therefore classified as category B. The detailed design of the subprojects will be \nprepared when the county PMOs get ready for their implementation. Therefore, it is not yet \npossible  for  the  implementing  agencies  to  conduct  detailed  screening  and  prepare  the \nresettlement  plans.  Instead,  a  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared.  The  framework \nexplains under which conditions a resettlement plan has to be prepared. It also specifies the \ndetailed  screening  process,  procedural  requirements,  outline  of  the  resettlement  plan, \nmonitoring of its implementation, and grievance redress mechanism. The initial screening of \nproject sites for resettlement impacts indicates that there would be little permanent land loss \nand no house demolition. All impacts (canals and ditches, farm access roads, tube wells, etc.) \nwill be within the villages on land that remains under village ownership, so no formal land \nacquisition will be necessary. The impact of land loss, temporary or permanent, to each affected \nhousehold will be minor, as construction will mainly upgrade and use existing structures. Most \nland that will be needed temporarily or permanently for the project will be compensated through \nland adjustments in the villages.  \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n34.  The  project  has  some  potential  environmental,  governance,  implementation,  and \ninstitutional risks. The project provides adequate measures to mitigate these risks and verify the \nassumptions of achieving the project impact, outcome, and benefits. Major risks and mitigating \n                                                \n15 Some counties were dropped from the project during project preparation due to water availability issues. \n ", "10 \nmeasures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk \nmanagement plan.16 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInadequate  The project will support the establishment and empowerment of farmer \nmaintenance of  professional associations and water users associations to take \nirrigation and  responsibility of O&M of the project facilities.

ASSURANCES \n35.  The government and SOCAD have assured ADB that the implementation of the project \nwill conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards,  gender,  procurement,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  the  project \nadministration manual (footnote 11) and loan documents. \n36.  The  government  and  SOCAD  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan and project agreements. \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n37.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$200,000,000  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Comprehensive  Agricultural \nDevelopment Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate-based lending facility; for a term of 20 \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n25 October 2012 \n                                                \n16  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nDesign  Performance Indicators and  Monitoring  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets with Baselines  Mechanisms  And Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nEnhanced food  Grain output in Anhui,  County,  The government continues \nsecurity in the  Heilongjiang, Henan, and Jilin  provincial, and  to support the CAD \nPRC   provinces increased from 500,700  national  program and pursues \n  tons in 2009 to 662,700 tons in  economic  inclusive development \n  2020; and in the Ningxia Hui  records and  policies. \n  Autonomous Region and the  annual statistics   \nYunnan Province from 162,300     \ntons in 2009 to 211,300 tons in   \n2020 in the project area  \n \nAverage per capita income for \nfarmers increased by 11% from \nCNY3,614 in 2010 to CNY4,012 \nin 2020 in constant 2010 values \nin the project area \nOutcome      Assumptions \nIncreased  Grain yields increased by 27%  County,  Farmers are willing to \nagricultural  from 5.74 tons/ha in 2010 to 7.31  provincial, and  participate and take over \nproductivity in the  tons/ha by 2018, cash crop yields  national  O&M of irrigation works. \nproject area  (excluding vegetables) by 27%  economic   \n  from 1.90 tons/ha in 2010 to 2.41  records and  Maintenance of irrigation \n  tons/ha by 2018, and vegetables  annual statistics  and drainage systems is \n  by 27% from 25.2 tons/ha in 2010    inadequate. \nto 32.0 tons/ha by 2018  Water resource \n  bureaus\u2019  Crop production is \nOverall irrigation water use  statistics  economically viable. \nefficiency increased from 40% in     \n2010 to 45% by 2018 for surface  Project  Counterpart funds are \nwater irrigation systems, and from  performance  available on time. \n60% in 2010 to 75% by 2018 for  monitoring and   \ngroundwater irrigation systems  progress reports  Risk \nby the PMO  Farmers lack access to \n  appropriate farming \nProject  technologies and \ncompletion and  marketing skills after \nevaluation  irrigation and drainage \nreports  systems are improved. \nOutputs  By 2018:    Assumption \n1.
