The development of this railway line is a major initiative for this \nregion, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is already providing assistance for developing \nthe  safety  aspects  on this  line.2 The  project  will  construct  a  demonstration  multimodal  hub3 on \nthis line in Xichang city in Sichuan province, improve maintenance systems by introducing modern \nmaintenance equipment, and enhance institutional capacity for railway maintenance.4 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nLagging railway development in the southwestern region of the People\u2019s Republic \nof  China.  The  rail  transport  subsector  is  vital  to  the  economic  and  social  development  in  this \nregion, and its expansion is needed to extend the benefits of development to people living in the \nregion.  Railway  development  has  lagged  in  the  southwestern  region  owing  to  the  highly \nmountainous terrain, which makes railway construction difficult. This constrains economic growth, \nparticularly  in  landlocked  provinces  like  Yunnan  and  Sichuan.  This  region  has  also  lagged  in \neconomic development, and gross domestic product per capita remains low, especially compared \nwith the more prosperous eastern provinces: out of the 31 administrative divisions in the PRC, \nSichuan  province  is  ranked  23rd  and  Yunnan  province  30th.  The  government  recognizes  the \nvirtues  of  the  railway  as  a  cheaper,  safer,  and  more  fuel-efficient  mode  compared  to  other \ntransport  modes.  It  has  the  potential  for  greater  speed  and  the  capacity  to  provide  demand-\nresponsive  sustainable  development  along  core  economic  corridors  without  taking  much  land \narea,  if  properly  planned  and  developed.  In  the  Thirteenth  Five-Year  Plan,  2016\u20132020,  the \ngovernment  has  placed  special  emphasis  on  expanding  the  railway  network  to  promote \nsustainable development in poorer and undeveloped provinces.5 The plan envisages removing \nexisting constraints in railway capacity and enhancing railway development in the western region \nby developing intercity rail networks to support inclusive development and reduce inequality and \npoverty. \n \n4. \nChengdu\u2013Kunming railway line. The existing line connecting the capital cities of Yunnan \nand Sichuan provinces was constructed in 1970, is a single-track line with operating speeds of \n40\u201360  kilometers  (km)  per  hour,  and  has  been  operating  at  near  full  capacity  for  more  than \n10 years. To expand capacity across the southwestern region of the PRC, a new railway line is \nbeing developed. The new Chengdu\u2013Kunming railway line (CKRL) involves the construction of \n\n                                                \n1  The project is included as a firm project for 2019 in ADB. 2018.

Outline of the Thirteenth Five-Year \nPlan for National Economic and Social Development of the People\u2019s Republic of China, 2016\u20132020. Beijing (adopted \nin 2016). \n\n\f860  km  (645  km  in  Sichuan  and  215  km  in  Yunnan)  of  railway  line  for  passenger  and  freight \ntransportation.  The  new  CKRL  is  22%  shorter  (236  km)  than  the  existing  single-track  line \n(1,096 km). Trains on the new railway line will be able to run at 160 km per hour compared with \nthe  existing  speed  of  only  60  km  per  hour.  The  capacity  for  passenger  trains  per  day  would \nincrease from 24 to 70. The shorter alignment and faster train speeds will shorten the travel time \nto less than 8 hours for passenger trains. Presently, it takes 18\u201322 hours for people to travel from \nChengdu to Kunming via rail. The shorter travel time is likely to make the railway a more attractive \ntravel option, and it is estimated that there will be a modal shift of 3.2 million passengers from \nroad to railway after the new line becomes operational, which  will reduce energy consumption \nand lower carbon emissions. \n \n5. \nNeed for integrated and energy-efficient multimodal hubs. In the PRC, new railway \nstations often do not meet the needs of passengers, as they are often located far from city centers \nand are not well integrated with cities\u2019 transport systems. Thus, while the new railway lines will \nfacilitate faster intercity travel, the stations also need to be efficiently linked to city centers with \nwell-designed  multimodal  transport  infrastructure  and  high-quality  integrated  public  transport \nservices.  This  will  enhance  the  quality  of  the  journey  experience  for  passengers  and  will \nencourage  increased  use  of  public  transport.  This  will  reduce  transport  costs,  increase  travel \nopportunities and regional accessibility to jobs and services, and promote economic development \nand poverty reduction. One of most important multimodal hubs on the CKRL will be developed in \nXichang city in Sichuan province, which has a population of about 775,000. It is rich in agriculture \nand food processing industries, is one of the centers of the PRC\u2019s space satellite program, and is \na  popular  tourist  destination.  It  is  estimated  that  2.8  million  passengers  will  use  the  Xichang \nmultimodal hub in 2025. Developing Xichang into a well-designed multimodal hub could have a \nmajor demonstration impact for the region. One of the most important strategic objectives of all \ndevelopment initiatives in the PRC is the reduction of energy consumption and carbon emissions \nacross sectors. In the PRC, buildings alone consume over 20% of the total energy produced, and \na shift toward green buildings is of great importance. The rail transport subsector in the PRC has \ndeveloped rapidly, with the number of stations now exceeding 5,000, so the subsector should pay \nsufficient attention to the use of energy in the stations. Railway stations can be developed as a \nmodel to demonstrate best practices in energy efficiency. \n \nEnsuring sustainability through improved maintenance. Good maintenance practices \n6. \nare an integral part of providing competitive, high-quality, and reliable railway transportation. The \nPRC  railway  network  is  managed  and  maintained  by  18  bureaus  that  are  wholly  owned  and \ncontrolled by CRC. The new CKRL line will be managed and maintained by Chengdu Railway \nBureau (CRB). By the end of 2016, the network size under CRB had reached 9,100 km. Of this, \nabout 2,100 km of track had an operating speed of 200 km per hour and above, and the remaining \n7,000 km was ordinary railway track. The volume of traffic carried was 210 million passengers, \nand 190 million tons of freight. The railway lines managed by CRB are typically in mountainous \nareas. The geological situation is complex, and the topography and landscape are hazardous. \nThe  difficult  terrain  poses  major  challenges  for  conventional  maintenance  systems.  Over \n1,500 km of the network has curves with a radius of fewer than 600 meters, which causes rapid \ntrack  wear  and  deformation  and  requires  careful  monitoring.  CRB\u2019s  current  maintenance  and \ninspection  equipment  are  insufficient.  The  maintenance  staff  have  limited  capacity  and  often \nstruggle to keep up with the demands of the rapidly growing network, which is increasingly difficult \nto maintain owing to the surge in operating speeds. \n \nRegional  cooperation. The  southwestern  PRC has  good  economic  complementarities \n7. \nwith South Asian and Southeast Asian countries, and bilateral trade is growing rapidly. Bordering \nthe  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  Myanmar,  and  Viet  Nam,  the  provinces  of  the \nsouthwestern  PRC  form  a  regional  cooperation  link  between  the  PRC  and  Association  of \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fSoutheast Asian Nations. The new CKRL will, together with the pan-Asia railway, constitute an \ninternational railway channel (i) connecting the PRC with the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \nMyanmar,  and  Viet  Nam;  (ii) playing  a  key  role  in  strengthening  communication  and  trade \nbetween the PRC and Southeast Asia and South Asia; and (iii) promoting the development of the \nPRC\u2013Association of Southeast Asian Nations free trade area.6 The PRC further needs assistance \nin ensuring that the line is (i) properly integrated with other transport modes through well-designed \nmultimodal hubs, and (ii) made sustainable by having an improved maintenance system in place. \n \n8. \nStrategic  priorities.  The  project  supports  a  number  of  the  operational  priorities  of \nStrategy 2030.7 By improving maintenance and thus reliability of railway operations, the project, \nwhich  is  located  in  a  less-developed  area  of  Sichuan  province  in  the  southwestern  PRC,  will \naddress  poverty  by  improving  access  to  markets  and  nonfarm  employment  opportunities.  The \nproject incorporates distinct gender-sensitive design features to enhance women\u2019s inclusion and \nparticipation,  and  ensure that  women  benefit from  the railway  line  and  station. The  project  will \nsupport  climate  change  mitigation  by  maximizing  the  passenger  hub\u2019s  (i)  capacity  to  facilitate \nefficient intermodal connectivity and (ii) incorporation of energy efficiency features. The project \ncontributes  to  climate  change  mitigation  by  enabling  a  modal  shift  to  railways,  which  are  less \ncarbon intensive compared with other modes of transportation. The location of the new passenger \nhub on an important railway line will strengthen its demonstration effect on the development of \nrailway  stations  in  cities  of  similar  size  in  the  PRC.  By  improving  railway  maintenance  on  an \ninternational railway corridor linking the PRC and Southeast Asia, the project will (i) strengthen \nservice delivery and improve institutional capacity, and (ii) facilitate regional cooperation. Through \nits support for climate change mitigation and regional cooperation, the project supports regional \npublic goods. Overall the project improves access to market and jobs thereby directly impacting \nlivelihoods of the people in the region. \n \n9. \nThe project is aligned with the strategic priorities of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nthe  PRC,  2016\u20132020  in  supporting  inclusive  economic  growth,  as  the  project  is  in  a  less-\ndeveloped region (Sichuan province in the southwestern PRC).8 The project will help the PRC \naddress the challenges highlighted above, and deepen the cooperation between the government \nand ADB by helping to develop the rail transport mode into a sustainable transport system for \nfreight and passengers. The project is in line with ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative, which \nhighlights railway development as an important opportunity for sustainable transport operations.9 \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  the  PRC  Thirteenth  Five-Year  Plan\u2019s  objectives  of  balanced \ndevelopment of rural and urban areas, better transport connectivity, and inclusive urbanization \n(footnote 5). The CKRL is also part of the PRC\u2019s medium- and long-term railway network plan, \nwhich seeks to improve the railway system, especially in the central and western PRC.10 \n \n10. \nValue  added  by  ADB  assistance.  ADB  will  add  value  to  the  project  through  the \nincorporation of design features to enhance the sustainability and efficiency of the multimodal hub, \nprocurement  of  advanced  technology  railway  maintenance  equipment,  and  incorporation  of \ngender-sensitive features. ADB has played a significant role in supporting CRC\u2019s development of  \nmultimodal passenger hubs in the PRC, including through the provision of technical assistance.11 \n\n                                                \n6  The Pan-Asia railway (also known as the Kunming\u2013Singapore railway) refers to a network of railway lines, planned \nor under construction, that would connect the PRC to Singapore and the countries of mainland Southeast Asia. \n7  ADB.  2018.

Manila. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fADB\u2019s support for the development of the multimodal hub in Xichang city will add value through \n(i)  an  emphasis  on  the  use  of  recycled  materials  to  ensure  sustainable  construction,  (ii) the \nextensive use of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency features in building design, and \n(iii) a design to maximize connectivity between different transport modes to facilitate intermodal \ntransfers  for  passengers.  ADB  will  also  add  value  by  financing  procurement  of  modern  track \nmaintenance equipment using international advertising. Investing in high-quality, state-of-the-art \nmaintenance equipment will yield substantial benefits by improving the reliability and operational \nefficiency  of  train  operations  and  facilitating  sustainability.  The  capacity  building  activities  will \nassist in the development of an integrated approach to maintenance systems, which is needed to \nmaintain  the  intensively  used  railway  infrastructure.  ADB\u2019s  involvement  will  also  prioritize \nmaintenance, which in the past in the PRC has been given lower priority than the construction of \nnew railway lines. The concentration of passengers arising from connecting transport modes will \nfacilitate the development of private-sector market opportunities. ADB will also ensure the project \nincorporates distinctive gender-sensitive design to enhance the level of satisfaction, comfort, and \nsafety  of  women  using public  transportation. These features  include  improved  safety features, \nuniversal design to facilitate accessibility of people, and improved signage. The project has also \nset targets to contribute to women\u2019s economic empowerment through project-related employment \nand  to  ensure  that  women  railway  staff  strengthen  their  knowledge  and  skills  to  improve  their \nemployment and career prospects. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n11. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  sustainable  railway  system  in  the \nsouthwestern PRC developed (footnotes 5 and 10). The project will have the following outcome: \nintegrated, energy-efficient, and sustainable railway corridor in Sichuan province developed.12 \n \nC. \n \nOutput  1:  Multimodal  passenger  hub  developed.  The  project  will  construct  a \n12. \nmultimodal  passenger  hub  in  Xichang  (Xichang  west  station),  which  is  a  growing  tourist \ndestination in Sichuan province.13 Xichang city is the capital of Liangshan prefecture in Sichuan \nprovince, located in the middle of the CKRL.14 The hub will include good intermodal connectivity \nand  energy  efficiency  features  in  the  form  of  improved  insulation  and  enhanced  air  ventilation \nsystems,  and  conform  to  PRC\u2019s  standard  for  green  buildings.15 It  will  have  improved  drainage \nsystems to adapt to the risk of flooding and will generate renewable energy generation through \nsolar power. The hub will incorporate inclusive and gender-sensitive features for a bus station for \nlong-distance,  local,  and  tourist  buses;  ticketing  and  support  facilities;  parking  for  cars, \nmotorcycles, and bicycles; and pedestrian walkways linking the railway station to other transport \nmodes to facilitate intermodal transfers. \n \nOutput 2: Railway maintenance improved. Track-renewal and track-laying operations \n13. \nrequire high expenditure for personnel and machines. With the help of mechanized work methods, \nthese costs can be significantly reduced and a higher quality can be achieved. This output will \nprocure modern railway track maintenance machines. The equipment will cover track inspection \nand repair, as well as rescue and restoration. This output will also include capacity building for \n                                                \n12 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n13 About 18.20 million tourists visited in Xichang in 2013, which was 18.69% higher than the 15.33 million in 2012, with \n\ntourism revenue of CNY10.52 billion in 2013 compared with CNY8.06 billion in 2012. \n\n14 Xichang west station will be built in Xichang\u2019s newly urbanized area, 10 km northwest of the existing city and 9 km \n\n15 Government of the PRC, Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development. 2014.

Some  of  the  specific  equipment  to  be  procured  under  the  project  includes  track \nreplacement  and  ballast  compacting  machines,  tunnel  inspection  vehicles,  and  accident  relief \nvehicles. The preliminary technical specifications of the equipment have been reviewed, and it \nhas  been  confirmed  that  the  equipment  is  compatible  with  and  suitable  for  the  maintenance \nrequirements of the railway network in the region. \n \nB. \n \nThe ADB-financed multimodal passenger hub and mechanized maintenance equipment \n22. \ncomponents were assessed individually. The economic benefits of the multimodal passenger hub \ninclude reduced travel time and vehicle operating costs, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and \nbenefits from improved safety. The economic benefits from the maintenance equipment include \nlabor  cost  savings  and  reduced  consumption  of  railway  materials  (rail,  ballast,  and  sleepers) \nbecause  of  the  higher  productivity  and  work  quality  of  mechanized  maintenance  machines \ncompared with CRB\u2019s existing equipment. The project will result in large positive net economic \nbenefits. The economic internal rate of return for the project is 22.23% and the net present value \nat a 9% discount rate is CNY1.75 billion. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the results are \nrobust and that the project would maintain its economic viability under most plausible scenarios. \n \nA  financial  analysis  was  undertaken  to  assess  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  project \n23. \nbased  on  the  fiscal  impact  of  (i)  counterpart  funds  during  the  project,  (ii)  operation  and \nmaintenance costs, and (iii) the loan repayment obligation. CRC will be responsible for all financial \nobligations. The total project cost to be financed by the government represents up to 0.19% of \nthe 2017 total revenue of CRC. After project implementation, ADB\u2019s loan repayment, financing \ncharges, and recurrent costs will be about 0.84% of the projected annual revenue of the railway \nline. The project is financially sustainable based on the financial sustainability analysis of CRC\u2019s \nfinancial health and the projected revenues and expenditures of the railway line. \n \nC. \n \n24. \nFinancial management. The financial management assessment (FMA) was conducted \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects19 and Financial Due \nDiligence: a Methodology Note and related technical guidance notes.20 The FMA concluded that \nthe capacity of both CRC and CKRC is adequate, and the overall financial management risk is \nmoderate.  CRC  has  prior  and  ongoing  experience  in  implementing  ADB  projects  and  has  an \nunderstanding of ADB procurement, disbursement, and financial management procedures. The \nFMA  recommended  that  CKRC  further  strengthen  its  financial  management  capability  by \nundertaking  training,  particularly  on  ADB  policy  and  its  procedural  requirements  for  financial \nmanagement, including financial reporting and disbursement.21 \n \n25. \nProcurement and anticorruption measures. All procurement to be financed under the \nADB  loan  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  and  Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all  procurement  documents  and  contracts.

The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 17). \n \nD. \n \nPoverty  and  social.  The  causes  of  poverty  include  (i)  low  profits  from  local  products \n26. \nbecause of lack of market access and local processing of agricultural products, (ii) lack of local \nnonfarm  employment  opportunities,  (iii)  insufficient  access  to  health  care,  (iv)  vulnerability  to \nclimate change and other environmental degradation; and (v) lack of access to credit and other \nsocial  services.  The  project  will  improve  maintenance  and  reliability  of  higher-speed  railway \noperations that provide access to regional markets, thereby increasing profit margins and raising \nrural incomes and improving livelihoods. \n \nProject beneficiaries. The project has the potential to benefit people in the project area \n27. \nthrough (i) employment during project construction and operation; (ii) improved access to markets, \ntransport, and other services through the larger railway line development; and (iii) integration of \nthe project area with regional trade and commerce. Rural households will increase and diversify \ntheir  agricultural  production  to  include  more  market-oriented  agriculture  because  of  expanded \naccess  to  markets  and  the  ability  to  move  bulk  goods,  improving  their  quality  of  life  thanks  to \nbetter  access  to  goods,  services,  and  social  infrastructure  at  less  cost.  Improved  access  to \nmarkets  will  facilitate  investment  in  local  processing  industry  and  value  addition  to  agricultural \nproduce and generation of nonfarm employment. Travel time to destinations along the Chengdu\u2013\nKunming railway line will be reduced significantly. \n \nGender.  The  project  is  categorized  as  having  some  gender  elements.22 Women  in  the \n28. \nproject  area  have  differentiated  transport  needs  arising  from  their  combined  engagement  in \nproductive  activities  and  in  caring  roles  such  as travelling  with  children  and  the  elderly. These \ngender roles result in specific mobility patterns and accessibility issues. Women also tend to have \nhigher  concerns  for  personal  safety  when  using  public  transportation.  To  address  women\u2019s \nspecific  transportation  needs,  the  project  incorporates  distinctive  gender-sensitive  design, \nincluding improved safety features such as lighting and CCTV in waiting areas and around hubs; \nuniversal design to facilitate accessibility of people using mobility aids, strollers, and those helping \nothers; and improved signage in and around hubs for the easy location of reserved seating, baby \ncare rooms, toilets, and lockers. These measures will enhance the level of satisfaction, comfort, \nand  safety  of  women  when  using  public  transportation.  The  project  has  also  set  targets  to \ncontribute  to  women\u2019s  economic  empowerment  through  employment  during  construction  and \noperation of the hub. Targets have also been set to ensure women railway staff actively participate \nin  technical  training  and  update  their  knowledge  and  skills  on  new  railway  maintenance \napproaches, increasing their employability and chances for career progression. \n \nE. \n \n29. \ncategories are as follows.23 \n \n30. \nthe \nenvironmental impact associated with the construction of Xichang multimodal passenger station. \nThe  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  complies  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  requirements, \nincluding  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement, and  identifies  potential  adverse  impacts.  During \nconstruction, such risks would include (i) soil erosion, (ii) construction noise and dust affecting \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\n(category  B).  The  project\u2019s  categorization  mainly \n\nEnvironment \n\nSafeguards \n\nreflects \n\n                                                \n22 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n\n\flocal residents, (iii) inappropriate storage of construction materials and wastes, and (iv) safety of \nconstruction workers. During operation, limited adverse impacts are anticipated, except for noise \nbecause of increased travelers. The IEE concludes that those impacts can be mitigated through \nthe implementation of the environmental management plan, which specifies mitigation measures, \nmonitoring  requirements,  and  institutional  responsibilities  for  ensuring  proper  environmental \nmanagement  throughout  the  project\u2019s  construction  and  operation.  The  executing  agency  has \nconsiderable  experience  with  previous  ADB  and World  Bank  projects.  Both  the  executing  and \nimplementing agencies are committed to managing the identified environmental risks and have \nagreed  on  a  comprehensive  set  of  mitigation  measures  and  a  training  program  with  a  strong \nemphasis  on  environment safeguards. The IEE was  posted  on the  ADB  website.  Environment \nsafeguard documents were disclosed to the affected people. Potential environmental complaints \nor disputes will be handled in accordance with the grievance redress mechanism established for \nthe project. A rapid climate risk assessment concludes that climate risk is medium, and the most \nsignificant  risk  to  the  project  area  and  its  vicinities  relates  to  flooding.  During  the  detailed \nengineering  design  of  the  station,  flood  risk  will  be  addressed  by  incorporating  a  sufficient \ndrainage system at the Xichang multimodal hub. \n \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). For output 1, a total of 530 mu of collective land \n31. \nwas acquired for the construction of the Xichang multimodal hub, affecting 45 households with \n187  persons.24 The  total  cost  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  was  CNY38.7  million.  Land \nacquisition and house demolition were completed by December 2017. A social compliance audit \nreport was prepared in accordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement and posted on the \nADB website.25 Furthermore, a Resettlement Due Diligence Report for associated facilities (the \nE\u2019mei\u2013Miyi Main Rail Line from E\u2019meishan City to Miyi County) was prepared and posted on the \nADB  website. 26 The  two  reports  include  a  corrective  actions  plan  with  time-bound  actions  to \naddress  the  remaining  resettlement  issues. The implementing  agency  is  committed to  monitor \nand  work  closely  with  the  relevant  government  agencies  to  manage  resettlement  issues.  The \nexecuting agency will engage an external monitor for semiannual monitoring and reporting. Public \nconsultations were undertaken during project preparation and will continue throughout the project \ncycle.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  has  been  established  to  address  affected  people\u2019s \nconcerns  and  suggestions. Output  2  involves  the  procurement  of  maintenance  equipment  and \ntherefore has no land acquisition and resettlement issues. \n \n32. \nadversely affected by the project. \n \nF. \n \n33. \nThe overall risk is assessed to be low. The integrated benefits and impacts are expected \nto  outweigh  the  costs.  The  project  is  formulated  to  minimize  potential  risks.  Sensitivity  tests \nindicate  that  economic  circumstances  would  have  to  worsen  substantially  for  the  investment \nprogram to lose its economic viability. CRC has successfully implemented ADB-financed projects \nin the past. \n \nRisks associated with potential changes in government policy are minimal. An analysis of \n34. \nthe  demand  for  railway  transport  shows  that  the  southwestern  PRC  needs  additional  railway \nmaintenance capacity to sustain its transport development.
