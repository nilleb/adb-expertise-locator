THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $68,400,000 to ArmPower CJSC for the Yerevan Gas-Fired Combined-Cycle Power Project \n(CCPP) in Armenia.  \n \n2.  The proposed loan will provide long-tenor financing that is not sufficiently available in the \nlocal market to support the construction of a gas-fired CCPP. This will contribute to diversification \nof energy sources in Armenia and boost efficiency by helping to replace existing aging generation \nassets with modern facilities.   \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n3.  Project identification. Since the start of the 21st century, Armenia\u2019s energy sector has \nundergone a series of reforms that have significantly improved its performance. The reforms \ninvolved the unbundling of a vertically integrated electricity subsector and the privatization of most \nof the generating companies and power and gas distribution networks.1 However, the existing \ngeneration facilities are aging and need replacement.  Generation in Armenia has dropped \nsubstantially since its peak in 1988. Armenia relies on nuclear and hydropower for about 65% of \nits power generation. Several thermal power plants have been delayed and one of the two \nreactors at the Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant (MNPP) has been shut down therefore, requiring \nadditional power generation.  \n \n4.  Since 2010, Yerevan Thermal Power Plant (YTPP), owned by the Ministry of Energy \nInfrastructures and Natural Resources, has been operating a 270 megawatt (MW) gas-fired \ncombined-cycle cogeneration power plant next to the proposed project site. The YTPP was \nfinanced with a concessional loan from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation. Given the \nneed to upgrade ageing power generation facilities in Armenia, Renco S.p.A. proposed 250 MW \nexpansion next to the YTPP site to the Government of Armenia.

It is a special purpose company \nowned 60% by Renco Power (a 75:25 joint venture between Renco and Societ\u00e0 Italiana per le \nImprese all\u2019Estero (SIMEST)); and 40% by Siemens Project Ventures (SPV). \n \n7.  Sponsors.  Renco is an Italian company incorporated in 1979. Its core activities are to \nprovide consulting services, and engineering and construction services for the energy, oil and \ngas, and civil infrastructures sectors. In addition to its operations in Italy, Renco operates in \ncountries  such  as  Armenia,  Congo,  Kazakhstan,  the  Russian  Federation,  and  Tanzania. \n[Confidential information deleted.] \n \n8.  SIMEST was established in 1991 to promote investments of Italian businesses abroad \nand to provide Italian companies with technical and financial support. Cassa Depositi e Prestiti \nGroup, 82.77% owned by Italy\u2019s Ministry of Economy and Finance, holds 76% of SIMEST\u2019s \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014.

Confidential information deleted.  \n \nB.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n11.  Impacts. The project will lead to the diversification of Armenia\u2019s primary energy sources.3 \nThe project will support the energy policy of the Government of Armenia, which aims to ensure \nenergy independence and enhance energy security.  \n \n12.  Outcome. The outcome of the project will be increased availability of reliable and affordably \npriced power to the domestic grid and the CCPP\u2019s power generation of 1,981 gigawatt-hours \nannually, which will help satisfy local electricity demand. The project is expected to provide at least \n80 jobs during operations. \n \n13.  Outputs. The outputs will be (i) 250 MW capacity gas-fired CCPP installed and operated \nby the private sector, (ii) local employment generated from the construction and operation of the \nCCPP, and (iii) local and national economy stimulated. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n14.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nthe Midterm Review on Strategy 2020, which includes a focus on private sector development and \noperations, and infrastructure development.4 ADB\u2019s support for the project is in line with its \ncountry partnership strategy for Armenia, 2014-2018 which supports private sector development \nand energy security by diversifying energy sources.5 \n \n15.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project is in line \nwith ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, particularly with one of its three pillars\u2014promoting energy efficiency \nand renewable energy. Although not a renewable energy source, the project will become the most \nefficient thermal power plant in the country and contribute to upgrade of electricity sources in \nArmenia where nuclear and hydropower plants generate about 65% of the electricity.6 This project \nis also complements ADB\u2019s earlier financing to ENA to improve the efficiency of Armenia\u2019s \nelectricity sector. \n \n                                                \n2  SIMEST. 2017.

ADB\u2019s  proposed  assistance  comprises  a  limited-recourse,  secured  loan  of  up  to \n$68,400,000 to ArmPower from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with a tenor of up to 15 years, \nincluding a 2.5-year grace period.  \n   \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n21.  ADB\u2019s role as a direct lender will enable the project to catalyze much-needed long-term \ndebt financing, which has limited availability in the domestic market. The project\u2019s sustainability \ndepends on its ability to amortize its up-front capital costs over the period of operation and tenor \nof the loan. The long tenor of the ADB loan is necessary for the project to achieve sound debt \nservice levels over the life of the project. The national and international commercial financing \nmarket does not provide such loans to the borrower. ADB\u2019s involvement significantly enhances \nenvironmental and social standards for the project. Successful project financing will establish \nprecedents  for  future  financings  of  similar  projects,  including  independent  power  producer \nprojects in Armenia, by boosting investor and lender confidence. \n \nC.

In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguards \ncategories are as follows: category A for environment, and category C for involuntary resettlement \nand indigenous peoples. To meet ADB environmental and social requirements for an environment \ncategory  A  project,  an  Environmental  and  Social  Impact  Assessment  was  prepared.7 The \npotential environmental and social impacts of the project have been identified and effective \nmeasures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts are incorporated \ninto an Environmental and Social Management Plan. The institutional capacity and commitment \nof ArmPower to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed adequate, \nparticularly given that Renco is already certified under international standards.8 \n \n32.  Environment (category A). The site is a former farmland in an industrial area of Yerevan. \nIt has been subject to previous earthworks through its use as a laydown and storage area for the \nneighboring power station. The soil has been tested for contamination and is suitable for industrial \nland use, but the groundwater has elevated hydrocarbons and heavy metals. Air monitoring for \nsulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide (NO ), and particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in diameter \n2\nfound that the airshed is non-degraded.9 Except for locations near main roads, the site and \nsurrounding areas generally have low noise levels.10    \n \n33.  Temporary construction impacts will potentially include noise, dust, traffic, erosion, solid \nand liquid waste generation, hazardous substances management, and health and safety issues. \nNo construction camp is required. The contractor will implement dust control, erosion and \nsediment control, and waste management as part of a construction environmental, health, and \nsafety management plan. No truck movements will be permitted at night. Groundwater is to be \nmanaged by the installation of a clay barrier and sub-surface drainage. The sponsor is engaging \nexperts to conduct a hydrological assessment and develop mitigation measures, which will be \nreviewed and approved by ADB prior to construction. \n \n34.  The plant will have a low nitrogen oxide burner and a 66-meter stack height in compliance \nwith international standards.11 The projected NO  emissions of 97.9 micrograms (\u00b5g)/cubic meter \n2\n(m3) per hour and 5.1 \u00b5g/m3 per year are well below the national and international NO  emission \n2\nstandards of 200 \u00b5g/m3 per hour and 40 \u00b5g/m3 per year. Greenhouse gas emissions of 785,000 \n                                                \n7  Fichtner. 2018.

Noise will not increase by more than 0.15 A-\nweighted decibels at sensitive receptors. Water requirements of up to 450 m3/hour will be sourced \nfrom the municipal network. Industrial wastewater will be treated via an oil\u2013water separator and \na biological treatment system to international discharge standards.12 Discharges of 70 m3/hour \nwill be delivered into an existing discharge pipeline and a series of canals, before entering the \nHrazdan River 7 kilometers downstream. This provides sufficient cooling so that there are no \nadverse effects on the river. About 14m3/hour of sanitary sewage will be discharged to the \nmunicipal network. \n \n35.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples (category C). The project site is in \nan industrial area owned by YTPP. ArmPower entered into the final land purchase agreement in \n2017 to acquire the site. The land does not have any legacy or current risks associated with land \nacquisition and resettlement. The due diligence phase has also assessed that the project does \nnot result in impacts on indigenous peoples. Hence, no involuntary resettlement or indigenous \npeople issues are envisaged for the project. \n \n36.  ArmPower will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy (2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor \nstandards.13 The client will report regularly to ADB on (i) its and its contractors\u2019 compliance with \nsuch laws and (ii) the measures taken. Information disclosure and consultation with affected \npeople will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements.14 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy  \n37.  ArmPower was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations  \n38.  The  proposed  loan  is  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single \nexposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n39.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),15 \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of Armenia \nhas no objection to the proposed assistance to ArmPower. ADB will enter into suitable finance \ndocumentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed \nassistance by the Board of Directors. \n \n                                                \n12 IFC. 2008.
