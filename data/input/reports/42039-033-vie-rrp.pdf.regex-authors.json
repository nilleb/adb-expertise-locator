I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Power \nTransmission Investment Program.1 \n \n2.  The proposed investment program will enhance the capacity of the transmission network \nto balance power loads in northern, central, and southern Viet Nam. It will (i) expand the \nelectricity transmission infrastructure by constructing and upgrading 500 kilovolt (kV) and 220 \nkV transmission lines and associated substations, (ii) improve the operational effectiveness and \nefficiency of the National Power Transmission Corporation, and (iii) support the implementation \nof the investment program.2  \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n1.  Socioeconomic Context \n3.  Viet Nam\u2019s rapid development has been accompanied by steadily growing demand for \nelectricity for both industrial development and private consumption. Consumption grew by an \naverage of 14% annually during 2004\u20132010, substantially surpassing the average economic \ngrowth rate of 7% per year in the same period. Demand for electricity is expected to continue \ngrowing by an average of 14% per year during 2011\u20132015 and 11% during 2016\u20132020. It is \nprojected  that  electricity  consumption  will  increase  from  85,932  gigawatt-hours  in  2010  to \n251,763 gigawatt-hours in 2020.  \n \n4.  Industry consumes 52% of electricity, residential consumers 39%, service businesses \n8%, and agriculture 1%. While industry is the largest electricity consumer, it is also the most \nimportant sector economically, projected by 2015 to account for 41% of gross domestic product, \n29% of the workforce, and 87% of export revenues.  Ensuring reliable electricity supply is \ntherefore an important prerequisite to sustaining economic growth at the target of 7.5%\u20138.0% \nper year.  \n \n5.  Viet Nam has made remarkable progress in expanding access to electricity, as the \npercentage of households without electricity fell from 22% in 1999 to only 3% in 2010. Those \ncommunities that are not yet connected to the grid are mainly in the less-developed and rather \nsparsely populated mountainous areas of the northwest. Per capita income reached $1,168 in \n2010, and the poverty rate fell to 14.2%. The high concentration of industrial parks and general \neconomic development induce many people to migrate to the centers of dynamic development \nand  employment  opportunities  in  the  southeast,  Central  Highlands,  and  Red  River  Delta. \nWithout additional generation capacity and transmission network expansion,  the main load \ncenters in these regions are expected to suffer a worsening electricity supply deficit and the \nshare of urban and rural populations without electricity is expected to increase, in particular \namong populations with lower income and electricity consumption.   \n \n2.  Institutional Arrangements \n6.  Institutional arrangements. The Ministry of Industry and Trade guides and supervises \nthe development of the power sector. Its responsibilities include formulating legal and regulatory \n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2010. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing the \nPower Transmission Investment Program. Manila.  ", "2 \nreforms  and  mechanisms  for  establishing  a  competitive  and  financially  sustainable  power \nmarket. It needs to coordinate closely with the Ministry of Planning and Investment, Ministry of \nFinance, and State Bank of Vietnam to develop policies and financial mechanisms to attract \nforeign investment and official development assistance, as well as increase the self-financing \ncapacity of power sector entities, to meet the funding requirements of the rapidly expanding \npower sector.  \n \n7.  Vietnam Electricity (EVN), the country\u2019s national power utility, is mainly responsible for \nundertaking  investments  in,  and managing the  operation  of,  assigned  electricity-generating \nprojects. The National Power Transmission Corporation (NPT) was established in 2008 as a \ncompany wholly owned by EVN. NPT is responsible for investment in and the management and \noperation of 500 kilovolt (kV) and 220 kV transmission lines and associated substations. NPT \nconsists  of  three  power  project  management  boards  (PPMBs)  that  implement  investment \nprojects undertaken by NPT. The Northern, Central, Southern, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh power \ncorporations, established in 2010 and currently wholly owned by EVN, are responsible for the \ndistribution  network.  Several  state-owned  enterprises  are  involved  in  independent  power \ngeneration projects, notably the oil and gas company PetroVietNam and the mining company \nVinacomin. \n \n8.  Since  enacting  the  Electricity  Law  in  2005,  Viet  Nam  has  demonstrated  strong \ncommitment to creating a competitive power market and broadening ownership in the sector. \nEVN was transformed into a vertically integrated holding company, and power-generation plants \nare gradually being transferred to independent power producers. During 2011\u20132020, 46% of \nnew power-generating capacity is planned as coming from foreign and domestic private sector \nentities. The state-owned power sector entities scheduled to be privatized are three of the five \ndistribution  companies.  However,  the  government  specified  that  the  national  transmission \nnetwork and large electricity-generation projects that are of high socioeconomic importance for \nnational defense and security will not be privatized.  \n \n3.  Subsector Problems and Constraints \n9.  Technical sustainability. A total of 22,294 megawatts (MW) of generation capacity will \nbe added during 2011\u20132015, and a further 35,087 MW during 2016\u20132020, to meet projected \npeak demand of 45,199 MW in 2020 and maintain a reserve margin of 41%, which still depends \nheavily on the availability of hydroelectricity.3 Electricity imports from regional power trade will \nbe 3% of the targeted generation capacity of 77,200 MW in 2020.  \n \n10.  The rapid expansion of new power generation and electricity imports from neighboring \ncountries requires that 500 kV and 220 kV transmission lines and associated substations be \nstrengthened and developed commensurately to better balance regional power load systems by \n(i)  removing  transmission  bottlenecks,  (ii)  facilitating  power  transfers,  and  (iii)  reducing \ntransmission  system  losses  and  voltage  fluctuations.  During  2011\u20132020,  the  transmission \nnetwork is planned to expand by 8,372 kilometers (km) of 500 kV transmission lines, 15,942 km \nof 220 kV transmission lines, 43,850 megavolt-amperes (MVA) of 500 kV/220 kV substation \ntransformer capacity, and 74,926 MVA of 220 kV/110 kV substation transformer capacity. The \ngovernment has set targets to reduce system losses from 10% in 2010 to 8% in 2020.  \n \n11.  Financial capacity. A key challenge for power sector entities is to mobilize financing to \nmeet investment requirements. While independent power producers are increasingly essential \nto attracting more investments in power generation, NPT remains solely responsible for meeting \n                                                \n3 In 2010, 44.6% of total installed capacity was hydropower, 17.6% coal-fired thermal, 31.8% oil- and gas-fired \nthermal, and 6.0% from small-scale hydropower and imports. Targets have been set to improve energy efficiency \nespecially in industry. The elasticity ratio of electricity demand is projected to decline from 2.0 in 2011 to 1.0 in 2020. ", "3 \ninvestment requirements by using its own resources and mobilizing financing from development \npartners. Without strong cash flow, NPT will find it increasingly difficult to finance its investment \nrequirements. Further, the availability of concessionary official development assistance and \ndomestic  funds  from  the  government  is  limited.  Local  finance  is  available  for  priority \ninfrastructure projects but with loans of only short tenure. NPT therefore resorts to borrowing on \ncommercial terms from export credit agencies and Asian Development Bank (ADB) ordinary \ncapital resources. \n \n12.  Electricity tariff and transmission charge adjustments. Although affordability and \npublic  welfare  must  be  considered  at  Viet  Nam\u2019s  stage  of  development,  the  government \nrecognizes  that  increases  in  tariffs  are  inevitable  to  cover  greater  costs  associated  with \nexpansion in power generation and transmission. The average electricity retail tariff was raised \nby 8.9% in 2009, 6.8% in 2010, and 15.3% in 2011 and is currently set at D1,242/kWh. \nTransmission charges were increased by 14.3% in March 2011 to D77.5/kWh. \n \n13.  Human resource development. Human resource capacity in the key operational areas \nof corporate strategic business planning, management, accounting, financial management, and \nplanning need to be strengthened, and appropriate tools, processes, and procedures need to be \nfurther updated, developed, and implemented to allow NPT to efficiently and effectively keep \npace with expansion requirements.  \n \n4.  Road Map, Strategy, and Sector Reform Framework \n14.  Expanding power generation, transmission, and distribution capacity in an economically \nand environmentally sustainable manner to meet rapidly growing electricity demand is a key \npriority of the Government of Viet Nam. It is one important prerequisite to sustaining economic \ngrowth, expanding employment and income-generating opportunities, and thus continuing to \nreduce  poverty.  The  government\u2019s  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132015 \nacknowledges  the  importance  of  large  infrastructure  investments  for  socioeconomic \ndevelopment. Recognizing the need to overcome current constraints in the power sector, the \ngovernment approved on 27 July 2011 the National Power Development Master Plan (PDMP) \nVII. With PDMP VII, the government approved multiple power generation and transmission \nprojects to be implemented during 2011\u20132020 and laid out a detailed road map and reform \nframework for (i) strengthening financial capacity, (ii) improving the operational performance of \npower sector entities, (iii) enhancing human resource capacity and development, (iv) improving \nthe  technological  optimization  and  modernization  of  power  sector  infrastructure,  and  (v) \nenhancing  energy  efficiency  in  generation  and  consumption  to  sustainably  develop  and \nmodernize Viet Nam\u2019s power sector.4  \n \n15.  NPT\u2019s investment plan for 2011\u20132020, estimated at $7,780 million, comprises physical \nand nonphysical investments to address infrastructure requirements and operational constraints \n(Table 1). \nTable 1: National Power Transmission Investment Plan Estimates \n($ million) \nShare of Total \nItem  2011\u20132015  2016\u20132020  Total  (%) \nExpansion of transmission network   3,580.0  3,860.0  7,440.0  95.6 \nOperational effectiveness and efficiency  30.0  20.0  50.0  0.7 \nProject management   140.0  150.0  290.0  3.7 \nTotal  3,750.0  4,030.0  7,780.0  100.0 \nSource: National Power Transmission Corporation estimates. \n \n                                                \n4 The Framework Financing Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) includes the MFF \nconstituents detailing the road map, the strategy, sector reform, and ADB\u2019s strategic context.  \n ", "4 \n5.  ADB Sector Experience \n16.  ADB  has  continuously  supported  the  power  sector  through  investments,  technical \nassistance, and policy dialogue for planning reform and designing the power market.5 ADB\u2019s \ncountry assistance program evaluation for Viet Nam, 1999\u20132008 assessed the energy sector \nassistance strategy and program highly relevant, successful, effective, likely to be sustainable, \nand substantial in impact and contribution to development results and value addition.6  \n \n17.  The  country  assistance  program  evaluation  identified  efficiency  issues  related  to \nimplementation  delays,  in  particular  (i)  lengthy  government  administrative  and  approval \nprocedures  involving  several  ministries;  (ii)  many  layers  of  approval  for  procurement, \nconstruction,  land  acquisition,  and  safeguards;  (iii)  delays  in  finalizing  detailed  technical \ndesigns; (iv) small procurement packages in the interest of attracting local bidders; and (v) \nlimited trained human resources to implement safeguard measures in an effective and timely \nway. The risk of implementation delays under the investment program will be mitigated by (i) \nensuring  a  high  degree  of  readiness  for  subproject  implementation  with  detailed  technical \ndesigns,  government  approvals,  and  advanced  procurement  in  place  before  a  tranche  is \napproved, (ii) implementing procurement plans with an appropriate number of procurement \ncontracts per subprojects, and (ii) building the capacity of NPT staff to prepare and implement \nsafeguard compliance documents and measures. \n \n6.  Rationale for the Multitranche Financing Facility Modality \n18.  Compared with other modalities, an MFF provides long-term, consistent, predictable, \nand  coordinated  support  with  a  critical  amount  of  financing  for  physical  and  nonphysical \ninvestments in line with the objectives and time frame of PDMP VII. The objectives of PDMP VII \nare fully consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy and energy assessment strategy \nand road map for 2011\u20132015.7 The sequencing and size of financing tranches provides to NPT \nthe flexibility to sequence transmission network investments in response to (i) the development \nof new power generation capacity, (ii) changes in load forecast and the commissioning of new \npower plants, and (iii) the finalization of technical designs.8 With the existence of a road map, \nsector strategy, and reform framework strongly owned by the government and power sector \nentities, the key requirements for using the MFF modality are met.  \n \n7.  Development Partner Coordination \n19.  Development  partner  coordination  has  in  the  past  provided  the  government  with \nopportunities to synergize interventions and capitalize on best practices. ADB, the World Bank, \nand bilateral partners have provided a significant portion of the funds for developing Viet Nam\u2019s \npower  sector,  including  the  country\u2019s  transmission  network.  However,  physical  investment \nrequirements,  in  particular  in  transmission,  exceed  the  financing  available  from  any \ndevelopment partner and import\u2013export banks that are interested in providing financing to the \ntransmission subsector.9 Through its long expertise, distinctive capabilities, and services, ADB \nwill continue to add value to the transmission subsector, improving both physical infrastructure \nand sector performance.  \n                                                \n5 ADB. 2004.

", "5 \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n20.  The investment program will contribute to meeting growth in electricity demand from \nindustrial,  commercial,  and  residential  consumers  in  an  economically  and  environmentally \nsustainable manner. The outcome of the investment program is the enhanced capacity of the \ntransmission network to balance power loads. \n \nC.  Outputs \n1.  Component 1: Expanded Transmission Network  \n21.  The first component of the investment program will support the expansion and upgrading \nof 500 kV and 220 kV transmission lines and associated substations throughout Viet Nam. It will \ncontribute to expanding Viet Nam\u2019s power transmission network by adding 647.6 km to 500 kV \ntransmission lines, 101.3 km to 220 kV transmission lines, 3,500  MVA to 500 kV/220 kV \nsubstation  transformer capacity,  and  1,250  MVA  to  220  kV/110 kV substation  transformer \ncapacity.10 The main benefits include (i) reductions in transmission losses with the strengthening \nof the transmission network, and (ii) increased power availability by facilitating power transfers, \nin particular from new and existing hydropower plants. The transmission network expansion \ntherefore will contribute to (i) increasing per capita electricity consumption from 985 kWh in \n2010 to 3,800 kWh in 2025, (ii) supporting the government\u2019s efforts to mitigate climate change, \nand (iii) facilitating the development of a competitive power market. All subprojects considered \nfor financing under the investment program are included in PDMP VII. \n \n22.  Tranche 1 will finance four subprojects: (i) the 500 kV and 220 kV Bac Ninh 2\u2013Pho Noi \ntransmission line in northern Viet Nam,11 (ii) the associated 500 kV/220 kV Pho Noi substation, \n(iii) the 220 kV Song May\u2013Uyen Hung transmission line, and (iv) the 220 kV/110 kV Phu My 2 \nsubstation (the latter two located in southern Viet Nam).  \n \n2.  Component 2: Improved Operational Effectiveness and Efficiency \n23.  The second component will build on ongoing capacity support provided by ADB through \ncapacity  building  technical  assistance.12  To  provide  NPT  with  the  tools  to  effectively  and \nefficiently manage the growth of its operations, NPT management and staff will undertake \ntraining seminars on (i) strategic corporate planning, business planning, and management; (ii) \naccounting, financial management, planning, and control; (iii) human resource management and \ndevelopment; and (iv) optimizing the engineering design of the transmission network. Under \ntranche 1, the services of a consulting firm will be engaged to provide training to at least 20 staff \non (i) strategic corporate planning, business planning, and management; and (ii) accounting, \nfinancial management, planning, and control. \n \n3.  Component 3: Project Implementation Support \n24.  The  third  component  will  support  project  implementation  with  focus  on  detailed \nengineering,  construction  supervision,  procurement,  safeguards  compliance,  and  the \npreparation of subsequent tranches of the investment program. The completion of detailed \nengineering  designs,  safeguard  compliance,  and  procurement  documents  will  trigger \npreparation for the financing of subsequent tranches.  \n                                                \n10 A list of subprojects identified for financing under the investment program is provided in the Facility Administration \nManual, Annex 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 A single circuit 500 kV and double circuit 220 kV transmission line will be installed on the same towers. \n12 ADB. 2010.

ADB loan proceeds from tranche 1 will finance (i) national and international individual \nconsultants to support and provide on-the-job training to staff of the established environment \nand social safeguard units toward preparing and implementing safeguard documents; and (ii) \nnational individual consultants to undertake independent monitoring for safeguard compliance. \nNPT  will  finance  a  local  consulting  firm  to  support  design,  construction  supervision,  and \nmanagement. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n26.  Viet Nam has requested an MFF in the amount up to $730 million from ADB's ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance part of NPT\u2019s investment program in line with PDMP VII. The \ninvestment plan is summarized in Table 2. Subsequent tranches will finance part of each of the \nthree output components.13 \n \nTable 2: Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Investment Program  Project 1 \nA.   Base Cost     \n  1.

The  MFF  is  anticipated  to  consist  of  four  tranches,  subject  to  the  government's \nsubmission  of  related  periodic  financing  requests;  execution  of  related  loan  and  project \nagreements for each tranche; and fulfillment of terms, conditions, undertakings, and assurances \nset forth in the framework financing agreement and loan and project agreements.14 Ordinary \ncapital resources financing will follow the ordinary operations loan regulations applicable to \nloans based on the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR), subject to possible modifications \nunder individual loan agreements.  \n \n28.  The first tranche, for $120.5 million, will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of \n4 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility,  and  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year.  Interest  during  construction  will  be \ncapitalized in the loan. The government will act as the borrower and relend to NPT under the \nsame terms and conditions, including an onlending spread of 0.25% per annum.15 The financing \nplan is summarized in Table 3.  \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s  tranche  1  loan  proceeds  will  finance  equipment,  civil  works,  contingencies, \nfinancing  charges  during  implementation,  services  with  regard  to  strengthening  NPT\u2019s \noperational effectiveness and efficiency, and project implementation support.16 NPT will finance \ntaxes and duties, land acquisition, costs for safeguard mitigation measures, and services for \nproject implementation support.  \n \n \n \n                                                \n13 The estimated investment plan, financing plan, and time frame for subsequent tranches is provided in the Facility \nAdministration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n14 Loan Agreement and Project Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n15 Decree 78, issued on 14 July 2010, regulates the onlending of sovereign foreign loans. \n16 Transportation and insurance costs may also be financed by the ADB loan.

The direct payment procedure \nwill be used. \na To facilitate project readiness and expedite project implementation, NPT has already recruited consulting services to \nsupport project implementation, which are entirely financed by NPT. On 20 September 2011, ADB approved \nadvance contracting and retroactive financing for safeguard consulting services, goods, and works. ADB may \napprove advance procurement and retroactive financing for subsequent tranches.  \nSources: Asian Development Bank and National Power Transmission Corporation estimates. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n31.  The development of the power transmission system is determined by the location of \nexisting and new power plants. The Institute of Energy, under the Ministry of Industry and \n ", "8 \nTrade, carries out studies on least-cost generation and transmission expansion for the country \nusing the integrated resource planning approach. Exhaustive engineering design and power \nsystem calculations ensure robust and optimal transmission network development based on \ninternationally  proven  extra-high-voltage  alternating-current  transmission  technology.  The \nMinistry of Industry and Trade approves feasibility studies and detailed technical designs for all \ntransmission projects. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n32.  Subprojects  appraised  for  tranche  1  are  economically  and  financially  viable.  The \neconomic rate of return is 28%. The financial internal rate of return for the four subprojects \nranges from 11.7% to 17.6%. The economic and financial internal rates of return exceed the \nweighted average cost of capital of 3.9%, and the economic and financial net present values are \npositive. Sensitivity analysis indicates that subprojects\u2019 economic and financial internal rates of \nreturn  are  viable  under  stressed  conditions. The  subprojects generate  a  net financial  and \neconomic surplus.17  \n \n33.  ADB reviewed NPT\u2019s financial performance and projections, including its capacity to \nfinance its investment needs and the adequacy of its capital structure to meet its debt service \nrequirements.18  The  government  will  ensure,  through  the  facility  undertakings,  that  a \ntransmission charge is set and implemented and/or additional financial restructuring measures \nare undertaken so that NPT can progressively achieve the financial performance objectives of a \n(i) debt-service-coverage ratio of 1.5, (ii) self-financing ratio of 25%, and (iii) debt-to-equity ratio \nof 75:25 by 2015 and maintain them thereafter. In addition, ADB provides NPT with financing \nsupport, using the MFF and technical assistance, to strengthen the capacity of NPT staff in \naccounting, corporate financial management, planning, and control.  \n \nC.  Governance \n34.  While NPT is a fairly new entity, most of its staff was formerly part of EVN, and the \nPPMBs existed prior to the establishment of NPT as unincorporated business units of EVN. As \nthe staff of NPT and its three PPMBs has implemented several transmission projects funded by \nADB  and  other  development  partners  and  financing  institutions,  it  possesses  extensive \nexperience and skills in implementing projects. A project financial management, procurement, \nand implementation capacity assessment of NPT and the PPMBs concluded that the executing \nand  implementing  agencies  have  adequate  financial  accounting,  audit  and  reporting, \nprocurement,  and  implementation  arrangements  in  place  for  implementing  the  investment \nprogram.  \n \n35.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and NPT. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the facility administration manual.19 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n36.  The poverty and social analysis assessed impacts at the sector level, since identifying \nspecific consumers is challenging in the context of transmission network expansion.20 In rural \nareas, reliable and improved electricity supply will, in addition to improving the quality of life \n                                                \n17 Economic Analysis and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Financial Performance and Projections of National Power Transmission Corporation (accessible as supplementary \ndocument in Appendix 2). \n19 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "9 \ngenerally, improve the productivity, efficiency, and quality of agricultural production for both \ndomestic consumption and export, thus increasing income. Benefits to the poor will come from \nincreased  demand  for  labor  resulting  from  improved  electricity  supply  to  industrial  and \ncommercial employers in urban and peri-urban areas. Industry is projected to account for 29% \nof the workforce by 2015, and services for 31%, increasing incomes and remittances from \nmigrant labor and mitigating the income vulnerability of urban and rural households. While \nelectricity tariffs need to be increased to ensure the ability of power sector entities to finance the \nlarge investment required, the government is committed to continuing efforts to develop and \neffectively implement appropriate tariff structures and social safety measures to ensure equal \nsocioeconomic development over the term of the MFF. Women that occupy roles in accounting, \nfinancing, human resources, and safeguards in NPT will benefit from the training programs \nprovided under the investment program. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n37.  The  government  and  NPT  endorsed  the  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework and the resettlement and ethnic minority development framework prepared for the \ninvestment program in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and Viet \nNam\u2019s regulations and guidelines.21 The impact on indigenous people from subprojects financed \nunder the investment program will be assessed in accordance with the resettlement and ethnic \nminority development framework. Both frameworks will guide NPT and the PPMBs in preparing \nand implementing safeguard measures, as subprojects will need to be classified as safeguard \ncategory B or A. The resettlement and ethnic minority development framework includes specific \nactions  to  ensure  gender-equitable  participation  in  the  preparation  and  implementation  of \nresettlement  plans.  The  two  frameworks  are  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website.  The  safeguard \ncategory for tranche 1 is B for environment, A for involuntary resettlement, and C for indigenous \npeople. \n \n38.  Environment.  Subprojects  of  tranche  1  are  category  B  under  ADB\u2019s  environment \nguidelines.  No  component  of  any  of the  four subprojects  is  located  in  an  environmentally \nsensitive or protected area, and potential impacts during construction will be mitigated by using \ngood international construction practices. An initial environmental examination report with an \nenvironmental management plan and implementation budget was prepared for each of the \nsubprojects of tranche 1 and is disclosed on ADB\u2019s website.22 Environmental and social units \nwill be formed within each PPMB to supervise implementation and assure occupational and \ncommunity health and safety until operation.  \n \n39.  Resettlement and indigenous people. Two subprojects of tranche 1 are category A\u2014\nthe 500 kV/220 kV Pho Noi substation and the 220 kV Song May\u2013Uyen Hung transmission \nline\u2014and the other two subprojects are category B. There is no need to relocate houses, but \n1,880 households will be affected by land acquisition, including 293 households likely to be \nsignificantly affected. Provincial governments confirmed that ethnic minorities do not reside in \nthe subproject areas financed under tranche 1. Resettlement plans have been prepared for \neach of the four subprojects and are disclosed on ADB\u2019s website.23 Implementation will be \nindependently monitored.  \n \n40.  Following an initial assessment, the safeguard category for subsequent tranches will \nreflect  that  of  tranche 1,  with  no  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  but  potentially \n                                                \n21  Environmental  Assessment  and  Review  Framework  and  Resettlement  and  Ethnic  Minority  Development \nFramework (accessible from the linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nsignificant involuntary resettlement impacts and some having limited impact on indigenous \npeople. The safeguard categories will be confirmed after detailed technical design.   \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n41.

ASSURANCES \n42.  The government and NPT have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n43.  The government and NPT have given ADB certain undertakings for the MFF, which are \nset forth in the framework financing agreement. Specific covenants agreed by the government \nand the National Power Transmission Corporation with respect to individual tranches under the \nMFF are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreements for the respective tranches. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n44.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the \nPresident,  under  the  provisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I \nrecommend that the Board approve the provision of loans under the multitranche financing \nfacility in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding $730,000,000 to the Socialist Republic \nof Viet Nam for the Power Transmission Investment Program from ADB's ordinary capital \nresources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the framework financing agreement presented to the Board. \n   \n  Bindu N.
