The  energy \nprovided  will  support  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  social  and  economic \ndevelopment. \n\nConsidering  the  present  constraints  on  the  power  sector  in  Sri \nLanka\u2014such as politicized tariff setting and lack of a transparent \ncompetitive  business  environment\u2014the  Government  has \ncommitted  itself  to  fundamental  policy  reforms  and  improved \nbusiness  practices  to  realize  power  sector  efficiencies.  Without \nchanges  in  policy,  investments  alone  will  not  yield  the  desired \nresults.  Accordingly,  the  mixed  modality  of  a  sector  development \nprogram,  which  supports  policy  changes  in  addition  to  project \ninvestments,  is  considered  the  most  appropriate  approach  for \nsupporting power sector restructuring. \n\nThe objectives of the Program are to (i) establish an independent \nregulatory  and \ntariff-setting  mechanism;  (ii)  enhance  sector \nefficiency  by  introducing  competition  and  commercialization;  and \n(iii)  encourage  private  sector  participation  in  the  sector  by \ndeveloping an enabling, transparent business environment.  \n\n(i)  Enactment  of  the  Electricity  Reform  Bill  and  Public  Utilities \nCommission  Bill,  which  taken  together  will  allow  (a)  the \nfor \nestablishment  of  an \nthe \nlicensing, \ninto \nunbundling  of \ngeneration,  transmission,  and  distribution  companies;  and    (c) \ncompulsory metering of all consumers \n\nindependent  regulatory  authority \n(b) \n(CEB) \n\nthe  Ceylon  Electricity  Board \n\ntariff  setting,  and  dispute \n\nresolution; \n\n(ii)  Appointment  of  the  Sri  Lanka  Public  Utilities  Commissioners \n\n(the Regulator) \n\n \n(iii)  Corporatization  of \n\nthe  generation, \ndistribution functions of CEB and LECO \n\n \n(iv)  Financial restructuring of the sector \n\ntransmission,  and \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n A  loan  of  $60,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  will \nbe  provided  under  ADB's  LIBOR-based  lending  facility.  The  loan \nwill have a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years, \nan  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  LIBOR-\n\n\fii \n\n \nExecuting Agency  \n\nImplementation \n      Arrangements \n\n \n\n \n \nThe Project Loan \n \nObjectives \n\n \nComponents \n  And Outputs \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nbased lending facility, commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a \nfront-end  fee  of  1.0%,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set \nforth in the draft Loan Agreement. \n\nThe Executing Agency (EA) of the program loan is the Ministry of \nFinance of the Government. \n\nThe  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  finance  the  foreign \nexchange costs (excluding local taxes and duties) of eligible items, \nproduced in and procured from ADB's member countries. \n \nCounterpart funds will be used by the Government in accordance \nwith  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB,  to  support  the  financial \nrestructuring  of  CEB  and  adjustment  costs  associated  with  the \nProgram, including (i) reduction of the accounts payable of CEB to \npower  producers,  and  suppliers  of  fuel  and  transportation,  (ii) \nretirement  of  CEB\u2019s  expensive  commercial  debt;    (iii)  payment  of \noutstanding  government  dues \ntechnical \nequipment  directly  related  to  the  functional  unbundling  of  CEB's \noperational areas. \n\nto  CEB;  and \n\n(iv) \n\nthe  quality  and  quantity  of  electricity  supply  by \n Improve \nexpanding,  modernizing,  and  rehabilitating  the  transmission  and \ndistribution systems, and expanding the rural network. \n\nThe Project loan consists of three components: \n\nPart A: About 600 rural electrification (RE) subprojects all over the \ncountry that will provide or expand electricity supply in about 820 \nvillages with about 112,500 consumers. \n\n Part  B:  Strengthening  of  CEB\u2019s  existing  distribution  networks, \nwhich  are  becoming  overloaded  in  many  areas,  and  to  reduce \nrelated line losses. This part will include 33-kilowatt development \nlines and express lines. \n\nPart C:  Transmission lines and substations to transport electricity \nfrom the generation stations to the rural areas. \n\n\f \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n \n\nExecuting Agency \nand Implementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\nBenefits and  \n       Beneficiaries \n\n \nRisks  \n\n \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\niii\n\n \nA loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights \n52,884,000 ($70,000,000 equivalent) will be provided from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources,  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of \n1.0%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  thereafter;  a  term  of  32 \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. \n\nThe Project will be executed by the Ministry for Power and Energy \n(MOPE)  and  implemented  by  CEB  or  its  successor  companies. \nThese  companies  will  be  duly  incorporated  and  registered  under \nthe Sri Lanka Companies (Amendment) Act No. 33 of 1991. \n\nGoods and services procured by CEB and financed by ADB under \nthe  Project  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. \n\nThe  social  and  poverty  assessment  shows  that,  although  the \nmajority  of  the  population  will  benefit  from  the  sector  reform,  the \nmain beneficiaries are the people living in electricity-deprived rural \nareas.  The  negative  impacts  expected  from  the  envisaged  tariff \nincreases in the short term will be partially offset by the effects of \nenhanced efficiency in the sector and in the economy as a whole. \n \nthrough \nTargeted  project  beneficiaries  will  directly  benefit \nsubstantial  savings  on  fuel,  time  for  household  activities,  and \nbetter educational and health outcomes from improved supply of \nelectricity. \n\nidentified  risks  have  been  mitigated \n\nThe  major  risks  to  the  Program  are  (i)  failure  to  establish  the \nregulatory  authority,  (ii)  lack  of  financial  support  for  CEB  in  the \nrestructuring  transition  period,  and  (iii)  operational  inadequacies. \nthrough  (i)  early \nThe \nGovernment  approval  of  the  bill  establishing  the  regulatory \nauthority;  (ii)  the  Government\u2019s  guarantee  of  financial  support  for \nCEB  during \ntransition  period;  and  (iii)  changing  and \nstrengthening  management  and  organizational  structures;  and \npractices,  and  enforcing  an  effective  checks-and-balance  system \nand mechanisms. \n\nthe \n\nthe  Program.  Technical  assistance  (TA) \n\nThese  two  facilities  are  not  part  of  the  Program,  but  are \nindependent  activities  directly  linked  to  the  ability  to  achieve  the \nobjectives  of \nfor \n$800,000,  with  an  additional  $250,000  in  cofinancing  from  the \nSwedish  International  Development  Agency,  will  support  the \nimplementation of the unbundling of CEB. The TA\u2019s objectives are \nto  (i)  help  establish  the  new  companies  by  allocating  assets, \nliabilities,  and  staff,  as  well  as  developing  sound  commercial \nbusiness  practices;  (ii)  establish  the  legal  contracts  between  the \nnew companies;  (ii) develop financial, operational, and reporting  \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\nsystems  within \nthe  new  companies;  and  (iii)  develop  and \nadminister an information campaign related to the restructuring of \nthe power sector. \n\nthrough \n\nloan  programs \n\nIn the past, poorer households have often been excluded from the \ndirect benefits of RE due to the high up-front costs associated with \na  grid  connection.  Moreover, \nthe \ncommercial banking system often exclude the poor because of the \nformal  requirements  to  access  credit.  ADB  will  develop  a  pilot \nprogram  to  finance  the  electricity  connection  costs  for  poorer \nhouseholds  through  a  revolving  fund  administered  by  local \nmicrofinance  institutions.  The  fund  will  be  financed  by  the  Japan \nFund for Poverty Reduction on a grant basis and re-lent at interest \nrates  that  encourage  poor  people  to  avail  of  electricity.  ADB  will \nengage  a  local  nongovernment  organization  to  prepare  initial \npoverty  assessments  in  pilot  villages,  monitor  the  progress  of \nthe \nimplementing \nparticipating households. \n\nfacility  and  assess \n\nimpact  on \n\nthe \n\nthe \n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \n\n1. \nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Power Sector Development Program. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nThe  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  framework1  notes  the  importance  of  rural \n2. \nelectrification  (RE):  \u201cWithout  access  to  electricity,  rural  areas  cannot  host  the  industries  and \nother off-farm income-generating activities that are essential to a pro-poor process of structural \nchange.\u201d In this respect, the goal is to have 80% of the country\u2019s population electrified by 2010. \nHowever, the poverty reduction framework also stresses the need to control fiscal deficits so as \nto maintain a stable macroenvironment. In this regard, there is a need for better management of \npublic enterprises, including those in the power sector. Efficiencies in the power sector are to be \nachieved  through  unbundling  of  the  relevant  public  enterprises  into  separate  generation, \ntransmission, and distribution companies, as outlined in the Government\u2019s 1998 Power Sector \nPolicy  Directions.2  The  Government  has  requested  assistance  from  the  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB) to further electrification of the nation\u2019s rural areas and to support the reform of the \npower sector. \n \nIn response to the Government\u2019s request, ADB included the Power Sector Development \n3. \nProgram  (the  Program)  in  the  Sri  Lanka  Country  Program  for  2002.  In  preparation  for  the \nProgram,  ADB  approved  a  technical  assistance  (TA)3  grant  to  advise  the  Government  on  the \nstructure,  operations,  and  management  of  the  power  sector  and  the  entities  within  the  sector. \nAn ADB Appraisal Mission visited Sri Lanka from 4 to 25 June 2002. Using the results of the TA, \nthe  Government  adopted  a  reform  program  and  issued  a  development  policy  letter  requesting \nADB's assistance (Appendix 1). \n \nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n4. \nThe power sector in Sri Lanka consists primarily of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) its \nsubsidiary, Lanka Electricity Company (LECO), and three independent power producers (IPPs). \nThe  key  sector  indicators  are  in  Appendix  2.  CEB  is  a  vertically  integrated,  state-owned  utility \nwith about 14,392 employees serving 2.69 million customers. Appendix 3 gives its organization \nchart.  CEB  is  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Ministry  of  Power  and  Energy  (MOPE),  and  it  is \nresponsible for (i) over 90% of all generation, (ii) transmission of power for the public throughout \nthe  nation,  and  (iii)  distribution  of  electricity  to  about  85%  of  all  customers.  The  balance  is \nserved  by  LECO,  which  has  342,054  customers  and  a  staff  of  1,321.  In  recent  years,  some \nmicrohydro  stations  have  been  deployed,  but  they  have  yet  to  make  any  real  impact  on  the \nsector.  \n \n5. \nCEB\u2019s  total  installed  capacity  for  electricity  generation  increased  from  1,410  megawatt \n(MW) in 1994 to 1,999 MW in 2001, and now comprises 1,137 MW of hydropower and 563 MW \nof  thermal  power.  The  peak  demand  in  2001  was  1,445  MW,  which  increased  by  2.8% \ncompared with 1,405 MW in 2000. The share of private IPPs in the total capacity increased from \n6%  in  1999  to  10%  in  2000.  With  the  increase  in  private  thermal  power  capacity,  reliance  on \ninstalled capacity of hydropower, further dropped to 57%from 62% a year ago.  \n                                                 \n1  Government of Sri Lanka, June 2002. Connecting to Growth: Sri Lanka's Poverty Reduction Strategy. \n2  TA 2795-SRI: Energy Sector Strategy Study prepared by the Ministry of Irrigation and Power. \n3  ADB.  1998.  Technical  Assistance  to  Sri  Lanka  for  Power  Sector  Restructuring  Project.  Manila.  The  work \n\ncommenced in the field on 8 May 2000. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nIn  2000  and  2001,  reduced  hydropower  generation  and  a  turbulent  crude  oil  market \n6. \nadversely affected the energy supply. As a result, CEB had to hire, at a high cost, several power \nplants  from  the  private  sector  on  a  temporary  basis  to  meet  the  demand.    To  ensure  load \ngrowth, significant new generation capacity needs to be commissioned in the near future. Of the \nexpected  165  MW  combined  gas  turbine  at  Kelanitissa,  110  MW  was  commissioned  in \nNovember  2001.  The  70  MW  Kukule  hydropower  project  is  expected  to  be  commissioned  in \n2004. The 150 MW Upper Kotmale hydropower project loan agreements have been signed but \nno ground-breaking yet, and the 300-MW coal thermal power project is still uncertain.  \n \n7. \nTransmission  systems  at  voltage  levels  of  220  kilovolts  (kV)  and  132  kV  are  used  to \ntransfer  power  from  the  generation  stations  to  the  load  centers.  The  System  Control  Center \nlocated  at  Dematagoda  manages  the  operation  of  both  220  kV  and  132  kV  transmission \nsystems  of  CEB.  The  transmission  system  is  generally  sound,  but  is  becoming  overloaded  in \nmeeting  the  load  growth  in  several  areas.  The  physical  condition  of  the  subtransmission  and \ndistribution networks was generally unsatisfactory in the 1990s as a result of high load growth, \ninsufficient  investment,  and  inadequate  maintenance.  To  analyze  these  problems,  the \nDistribution Planning Unit of CEB formulated a computerized database in 2000 to collect power \nsystem data such as voltage drop, phase current, and distribution transformer loading from each \narea office and the customer service centers in all provinces. Development programs to improve \nsystem  loss  reduction  and  low  voltage  have  been  identified.  Additional  investments  for \nexpanding the transmission and distribution systems as well as for the development programs \nare required.  \n \n8. \nDuring the past 10 years, CEB\u2019s system loss was between 17% and 19% mainly due to \ninappropriate network design and metering deficiencies. System loss has gradually increased to \n22%, despite substantial investments made to the transmission and distribution networks. The \nrapid  expansion  of  RE  programs,  delays  in  fixing  breakdowns,  and  lack  of  electricity  meters \naccount for the increase in system losses. Hence, it is very important for CEB to reduce such \nlosses  to  12%  through  improvements  in  the  power  system  and  careful  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) of the system. \n \n9. \nRecognizing  the  need  for  power  sector  reform,  the  Government  approved  in  1998  the \nadoption  of  a  restructuring  model,  which  called  for  the  unbundling  of  the  power  sector  into \nseparate  companies  for  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution.  Furthermore,  through  its \nsteering committee for power sector reforms, the Government approved on 6 April 2001 the new \npower sector structure. The approved unbundling of CEB and LECO calls for the establishment \nof  (i)  one  generation  company,  (ii)  one  transmission  company  with  two  subsidiaries  for  bulk \npower  activities  (purchase  and  sale  of  electricity)  and  the  transmission  activity,  and  (iii)  four \ndistribution companies. An independent regulator will be established to regulate all the activities \nof  the  new  power  sector  structure.  The  Government  has  decided  to  establish  a  multisector \nregulatory commission, by enacting the Public Utilities Commission Bill, which initially will cover \ninfrastructure sectors such as the electricity and water sectors. \n \nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n10. \nThe  power  sector  in  Sri  Lanka  is  faced  with  three  major  constraints  that  need  urgent \nattention.  These  are  (i)  overall  generation  and  load  capacities,  (ii)  financial  management  and \noperational  governance  of  CEB,  and  (iii)  the  business  environment  of  the  sector.  The \nconstraints are interlinked in the day-to-day operations of CEB, but they must be delinked during \nanalysis and correction for optimum results. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 3\n\n1. \n\nConstraints \n\n11. \nLoad  Restrictions.  Power  demand  increased  by  2.8%  in  2001.  Drought  severely \naffected the energy supply from hydroelectric power stations in 2001. Besides the drought, the \naverage plant load factor of the thermal power plant was only 46%. This low figure may imply \ninadequate  maintenance  work.  The  insufficient  installed  thermal  power  generation  capacity \nalong  with  its  relatively  low  availability  and  the  severe  drought  compelled  CEB  to  resort \nextensively  to  expensive  thermal  power  generation,  mainly  container-mounted  power  plants. \nThe total hired generation in 2001 was 341 gigawatt-hours (GWh) accounting for about 5.2% of \nthe  total  generation.  The  situation  may  not  improve  in  the  immediate  future  since  the \ncommitments  of  the  new  power  plants  such  as  the  Coal  Thermal  Power  Project  and \nKerawalipitya Power Project are still awaited. \n \n12. \nFinancial Management and Governance. The financial management system in CEB is \nantiquated and is based on accounting for expenses incurred and booking them in the proper \naccounts. CEB has not adopted modern business practices in cash management and treasury \noperations  since  CEB's  internal  view  is  that  it  has  so  far  not  been  central  to  its  mission.  In \naddition,  CEB  has  felt  no  need  or  obligation  to  address  this  shortcoming  earlier  since  it  had \nproduced enough energy and had substantial amounts of soft loans. As a result, there is today \nno management information system that can provide the management or the board of directors \ninformation necessary for decision-making in an accurate, up-to-date, and integrated manner. \n \n13. \nCEB  lacks  an  integrated  energy  accounting  system  where  the  amount  of  energy \ngenerated  is  linked  to  the  actual  energy  billed,  and  in  turn  to  the  cash  collected  monthly. \nDeveloping  proper  departmental  and  divisional  financial  budgets,  treasury  operations  plans; \nincreasing the speed of cash collection, cash placements, and payments made on due dates so \nas  to  utilize  the  credit  terms  given  will  be  highly  beneficial  to  CEB\u2019s  financial  operation  and \ncontrol.  \n \n14. \nCEB  Operations.  CEB  today  is  run  more  like  a  government  department  than  an \nautonomous corporation and lacks clear operational and financial objectives. The independence \nand  effectiveness  of  the  board  of  directors  have  not  turned  out  as  originally  intended  and  the \nauthority levels within CEB are too low and inadequate for almost any purchase appropriate to \nthose levels. The requirements of public service management, particularly those justified by the \nFinance  Act  and  various  regulations,  are  at  the  root  of  many  of  the  problems  in  procurement \nand human resource management, and the absence of management accountability for results. \nThe poor focus on customer service translates to low quality of electricity supplies; inconvenient \nbilling  processes;  and  slow  response  to  inquiries,  fault  notices,  and  applications  for  new \nconnections.  In  addition,  CEB  operations  have  been  guided  by  politically  motivated  directions \nfrom  MOPE  rather  than  by  the  board's  own  financial  and  operational  needs.  As  a  result,  CEB \nhas  not  applied  to  MOPE  for  necessary  tariff  increases,  and  the  need  for  decisions  related  to \nadditional generation capacity is needed. \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Government\u2019s Objectives and Strategy \n\n15. \nThrough its Power Sector Policy Directions in 1998, the Government clearly expressed \nits wish to restructure the power sector so as to create an enabling business environment that \nwould improve the sector\u2019s (i) operating efficiencies, (ii) financial viability, and (iii) service to its \ncustomers.  This  Government  objective  is  even  stronger  today  due  to  the  current  financial \nproblems  and  the  need  for  further  generation  capacity.  To  achieve  its  aim,  the  Government \nproposes  to  (i)  encourage  and  facilitate  direct  and  indirect  (benchmark)  competition,  wherever \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\nfeasible;  (ii)  invite  private  sector  participation  in  power  generation  through  transparent  and \ncompetitive  bidding  processes,  with  equal  opportunities  to  the  public  and  private  sectors, \n(iii) charge  tariffs  based  on  commercial  principles  that  enable  costs  to  be  recovered  and \nreasonable  returns  to  be  made  on  investments;  and  (iv)  grant  transparent,  reasonable,  direct \nand  quantified  subsidies  to  targeted  sections  of  consumers.  The  Government  decided  to \ncomprehensively amend the existing legislation, regulations, and tariffs in accordance with the \nabove principles.  \n \nThe  Government  established  the  Steering  Committee  for  Power  Sector  Reform4  to \n16. \noversee  and  approve  matters  related  to  power  sector  restructuring.  To  assist  the  steering \ncommittee,  the  Power  Sector  Reform  Office  was  established  and  staffed  with  personnel  from \nCEB  and  LECO.  To  address  the  foregoing  objectives,  the  Government  requested  technical \nassistance  from  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  (WB).  The  three  parties  agreed  to  a  delineation  of \ntasks. ADB approved in December 1998 a TA5 for the operational and managerial aspects of a \nrestructured power sector, while WB funded the legal and regulatory aspects. The consultants \nbegan work in the field in early May 2000. As a result of the work presented by the consultants \nto the steering committee, the committee approved a power sector structure in February 2001.6 \nThe new power sector structure would transform CEB into one generating company (GENCO) \nand a transmission company (TRANSCO) that would be responsible for both the transmission \nfunction  inclusive  of  dispatch  and  the  bulk  power  purchase  and  sales  from  all  generation \ncompanies  to  the  distribution  companies;  and  establish  three  to  four  distribution  companies \naccording  to  the  financial  viability  of  the  distribution  areas.  The  new  companies  will  initially  be \nfully  owned  by  the  Government,  but  private  sector  participation  will  be  allowed  later  when  the \ncompanies need funding for future investments. \n \n\n3. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector \n\n17. \nThe  power  sector  in  Sri  Lanka  has  received  substantial  foreign  aid  and  loans  over  the \nlast two decades. The multipurpose hydro project in the Mahaweli Basin was mostly financed by \nthe  Overseas  Economic  Cooperation  Fund  of  Japan  (now  JBIC).  WB  and  ADB  are  the \nmultilateral  agencies  involved  in  the  sector,  and  the  bilateral  sources  have  been  sourced  by \nGermany through the Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Widernaufbau (KfW), Swedish International Development \nCooperation  Agency  (SIDA),  and  the  Kuwait  Fund.  The  development  coordination  matrix \nregarding the power sector is summarized in Appendix 4. \n \n\n4. \n\nADB\u2019s Country and Sector Strategy \n\n18. \nOperational Strategy. Sri Lanka experienced a severe economic and social dislocation \nin 1996 as a direct result of power shortages. The country's reliance on hydropower generation \nexposed the national economy to fluctuations in rainfall. As the national economy had become \nlarger and more sophisticated, it became obvious that the energy supplies needed to be reliable \nduring  low  rainfall  years  also.  The  situation  demanded  rethinking  the  mix  of  generation  plants \nand  diversifying  energy  resources.  The  national  budget  has  severe  constraints  in  undertaking \nnew  investments,  and  funding  for  priority  investments  relies  heavily  on  concessional  funding \nand private sources. ADB's strategy and subsequent assistance are directly linked to the need \n\n                                                 \n4   The  Steering  Committee  was  superseded  by  the  Energy  Supply  Committee  (ESC),  which  was  enacted  by  the \nEnergy Supply Act, No. 2 of 21 March 2002. The ESC ratified all the decisions taken by the Steering Committee. \n\n5   ADB. 1998. Technical Assistance to Sri Lanka for Power Sector Restructuring. Manila. \n6  The Consultants, a consortium of Fichtner/PA Consulting/Earnst & Young, have prepared five detailed reports for \nTA 3141-SRI namely: (i) Initial Comprehensive Plan for Power Sector Restructuring, (ii) Engineering Review,   (iii) \nPersonnel Report, (iv) Financial Report, and (v) Tariff Report.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 5\n\nfor power sector reforms. It is necessary to create an environment conducive to private sector \nparticipation and to ensure that the entities operating within the power sector function according \nto financially sound principles. Accordingly, as the Government has acknowledged the need for \nand  committed  to  sector  reforms,  ADB,  together  with  other  aid  agencies,  has  embarked  on  a \nrestructuring  program  to  ensure  adequate  and  reliable  power  supplies  at  competitive  prices \nthrough  increased  private  sector  participation  and  improved  management  and  operational \nefficiencies.  It  should  be  noted  that  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  the  energy  sector  is  developed  with \nstrict emphasis on performance. The details of the strategy are in Appendix 4. \n \n19. \nLessons Learned. To date, the operations of ADB and other agencies in the Sri Lankan \npower  sector  have  generally  been  successful  from  a  technical  point  of  view,  i.e.  the  projects \nconcerned  have  been  completed,  although  some  with  substantial  delays,  and  they  perform  in \naccordance  with  the  technical  specifications.  However,  two  major  issues  have  been  detected \nduring  the  project  completion  exercise  and  periodic  review  mission  of  ongoing  projects.7  Over \nthe  last  decade,  CEB  has  not  been  able  to  meet  some  of  the  financial  covenants,  especially \nthose linked to the rate of return. Unsatisfactory financial performance has prevented CEB from \nundertaking,  through  its  own  funds,  its  investment  program.  Funds  from  the  Government  and \nexternal resources beyond what is normally needed have been required.  \n \n20. \nIn  the  past,  implementation  delays  were  caused  by  cumbersome  procurement \nprocedures. The authority levels have been far too low, and the number of tender and technical \ncommittees  exceeds  what  ADB  considers  best  practice.  Considering  that  the  Sri  Lankan \nprocurement  procedures  are  encountered  in  most  of  the  sectors  that  ADB  assists,  attempts \nwere made through a TA8 to address the procurement bottleneck. However, such attempts have \nnot  been  successful.  The  approach  of  unbundling  the  power  sector  and  establishing  each \ncompany  under  the  Companies  Act  will  ensure  that  the  current  system  of  cabinet  tender \ncommittees is abandoned. Procurement procedures will be established in accordance with best \npractices, as per the international competitive bidding (ICB) systems and the use of international \n(or national) shopping, as required for smaller amounts. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n\nA comprehensive program for restructuring the power sector has been initiated through \n21. \nADB  and  WB  TA  grants.  The  Power  Sector  Development  Program  seeks  to  mobilize  greater \nresources  for  the  power  sector  to  enable  it  to  realize  a  possible  increase  in  total  investments. \nThe  Program  includes  support  and  incentives  for  restructuring  in  the  form  of  program \nassistance,  and  assistance  for  project  investments  in  the  rural  areas,  in  the  form  of  new \ndistribution lines and connections as well as improvements in the existing rural transmission and \ndistribution network. \n \nThe Program has been designed to address two of three major issues currently affecting \n22. \nthe  power  sector,  namely,  (i)  the  financial  deterioration  of  CEB  including  the  drain  on  the \nnational resources and economic effects, and (ii) the operational inefficiencies of CEB and the \nsector as a whole. The third issue, generation shortage, is part of ADB\u2019s ongoing policy dialogue \nbut, as ADB has earlier expressed, additional generation facilities should be developed by the \nprivate  sector.  Nevertheless,  a  large  part  of  the  policy  component  of  the  Program  indirectly \naddresses  the  generation  situation  as  it  focuses  on  developing  an  environment  conducive  to \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2000.

Manila. \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nprivate  sector  participation  at  a  substantially  higher  level  than  to  date.  The  private  sector  will \nonly  participate  when  the  financial  capacity  of  the  off-taker  is  sound,  and  it  has  the  financial \ncapacity to shoulder the purchase of electricity generated. \n \nThe  Program  seeks  to  establish  in  the  power  sector  a  business  environment  that \n23. \npromotes  (i)  efficiency,  (ii)  growth,  (iii)  required  investments,  and  (iv)  customer  satisfaction. \nSince these facets of development are all important for the success of restructuring, the sector \ndevelopment program modality has been considered the most appropriate.  \n \nA. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n24. \nThrough its Power Sector Policy Directions, the Government, in 1998, clearly expressed \nthe desire to restructure the power sector in order to create an enabling business environment \nthat  would  improve  the  sector\u2019s  (i)  operating  efficiencies,  (ii)  financial  viability,  and  (iii)  service \nquality.  The  Government  proposes  to  do  this  by  (i)  encouraging  and  facilitating  direct  and \nindirect  (benchmark)  competition,  wherever  feasible;  (ii)  inviting  private  sector  participation  in \npower  generation  through  transparent  and  competitive  bidding  processes,  giving  equal \nopportunities  to  the  public  and  private  sectors;  (iii)  charging  tariffs  based  on  commercial \nprinciples that allow costs to be recovered and reasonable returns to be made on investments; \nand (iv) granting transparent, reasonable, direct, and quantified subsidies to targeted sections of \nconsumers.  The  Government  wishes  to  comprehensively  amend  the  existing  legislation, \nregulations, and tariffs in accord with the above principles.  \n \nB. \n\nImportant Features \n\n25. \nThe  immediate  objectives  of  the  Program  are  to  support  and  provide  incentives  to  the \nGovernment  and  CEB/LECO  to  (i)  implement  sector  reform  activities  such  as  establishing  an \nindependent  regulator,  developing  an  independent  tariff-setting  mechanism  and  rationalizing \ntariff,  and  functionally  segregating  CEB\u2019s/LECO\u2019s  activities  through  unbundling;  and  (ii) \nmodernize,  upgrade,  and  extend  electrification  to  identify  rural  areas  by  augmenting  the \ntransmission and distribution networks. The entire exercise aims to improve the power sector\u2019s \nfinancial  and  economic  viability  over  the  next  3  \u2013  5  years  to  ensure  sustained  growth  of  the \nsector. The program framework is in Appendix 5.  \n \nA stand-alone TA9 is also being processed in parallel to the Program to support actual \n26. \nimplementation  of  the  restructuring  during  the  transformation  of  the  integrated  CEB  and  the \nestablishment of the new companies. A stand-alone TA will ensure flexibility in timing the actual \nstart of the restructuring. \n \n27. \nIt is proposed that ADB provide two loans totaling $130 million equivalent from its capital \nresources. The amount of $60 million for the Policy Component will come from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources (OCR). The OCR loan will have a term of 15 years, including a grace period of \n3  years;  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  LIBOR-based  variable  lending \nfacility;  an  annual  commitment  charge  of  0.75%;  a  front-end  fee  of  1%  of  the  loan  amount; \nconversion  options  that  may  be  exercised  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  draft  Loan \nAgreement, the Loan Regulations, and ADB's conversion guidelines; and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. The Borrower will be the Democratic Socialist \nRepublic of Sri Lanka, which will also carry the foreign exchange risk. The second loan \u2013 for the \nproject component \u2013 will be for SDR 52,884,000 ($70.0 million equivalent), and will come from \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2002.

The Borrower \nwill bear the foreign exchange risk. \n \nC. \n\nThe Program Loan \n\n28. \nThe policy loan of $60 million will support reforms and restructuring in the power sector. \nUnder arrangements satisfactory to ADB, the Government will use the counterpart funds to be \ngenerated  from  the  loan  proceeds  to  support  the  financial  restructuring  of  CEB/LECO  and \nadjustment costs associated with the Program, including (i) reduction of the accounts payable of \nCEB  to  power  producers,  and  suppliers  of  fuel  and  transportation;  (ii)  retirement  of  CEB\u2019s \nexpensive  commercial  debt;  (iii)  payment  of  outstanding  government  dues  to  CEB;  and  (iv) \ntechnical  equipment  directly  related  to  the  functional  unbundling  of  CEB's  and  LECO's \noperational areas. \n \n\n1. \n\nObjectives \n\n29. \nThe Program will assist the Government to implement the policy decision made in 1998 \nto reform and restructure the power sector. In summary, the Government decided and agreed to \ncomprehensively  restructure \nits  power  sector,  although  on  a  gradual  basis,  allowing \ndevelopment  of  (i)  successor  companies  of  CEB,  (ii)  a  culture  based  on  commercial  terms, \n(iii) consumer  benefits  in  terms  of  quality  of  supply,  and  (iv)  an  independent  tariff  setting \nmechanism.  \n \n\n2. \n\nComponents \n\n30. \nThe  policy  dialogue  between  the  Government  and  ADB  has  been  conducted  at  three \nlevels:  (i)  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  on  the  power  sector's  impact  on  the  national \neconomy  and  the  government  budget,  (ii)  with  MOPE  on  sector  policies  and  structures,  and \n(iii) with CEB regarding the Project and organizational issues related to the restructuring.  \n \n\n3. \n\nImportant Features   \n\na. \n\nReform Model and Institutional Arrangements \n\n31. \nThe Government\u2019s policy for reforms was set out in its Policy Directions paper in October \n1998. The paper broadly endorsed PriceWaterhouse Option 710 as the model best suited to Sri \nLanka.  The  PriceWaterhouse  study  looked  at  various  degrees  of  functionally  unbundling  CEB \nand  fully  commercializing  its  operations,  and  the  creation  of  an  independent  regulator  to \nintroduce  and  ensure  efficiency  and  accountability.  Option  7  called  for  separating  the \ngeneration,  transmission,  and  distribution  functions  of  CEB\u2019s  operations,  and  establishing  an \nindependent regulator. Option 7 has served as the framework for the policy dialogue.   \n \n32. \nThe most recent policy dialogue focused on the number of companies in each functional \narea,  and  how  they  should  be  structured.    The  extensive  dialogue  culminated  in  the  Steering \nCommittee approving the following: (i) CEB\u2019s generation function will ultimately be vested in two \nhydropower  generation  companies  and  one  thermal  generation  company,  (ii)  the  transmission \ncompany  will  have  two  subsidiaries,  one  for  transmission/dispatch  and  one  for  the  bulk \n                                                 \n10 In  1995,  the  Government  engaged  PriceWaterhouse  to  undertake  the  Study  to  Examine  Legal  and  Regulatory \nFramework  and  Policy  Incentives  Required  to  Promote  Private  Sector  Participation  in  Power  Development.  This \nstudy developed a number of options for Sri Lanka and recommended Option 7. \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\npurchase and sales functions; and (iii) there will be 3 \u2013 4 distribution companies, depending on \nthe  financial  analysis  of  the  marketplace.  The  early  indication  is  that  establishing  four \ndistribution companies is financially feasible. Competition is to be introduced progressively, and \neach  new  IPP  will  be  bidded  out  to  safeguard  competition  for  the  market.  Similarly,  each \ndistribution company will enjoy a monopoly in its territory, with its performance being compared \non  a  benchmark  competition  basis  with  the  other  distribution  companies.  An  illustration  of  the \nnew power sector structure and the industry roles are in Appendix 6. This structure has served \nas the framework for the policy dialogue. The Bulk Power Company (BulkPowerCo), one of the \nsubsidiaries of the transmission company, is the single buyer in the market, and it will buy all the \nnecessary electricity generated and sell it to the distribution company. As the Sri Lanka power \nsector becomes more sophisticated, other forms of competition can be introduced. \n \n\nb. \n\nCEB\u2019s Financial Position \n\n33. \nThe  current  financial  position  of  CEB  is  cause  for  alarm  among  the  Government's \nministries,  national  and  international  lenders,  IPPs,  equipment  suppliers,  and  CEB  staff  alike. \nCEB  has  not  been  in  a  position  to  build  up  any  equity  funds  over  the  last  decade,  nor  has  it \nbeen able to earn a reasonable rate of return on assets that would have ensured less reliance \non  government  support  and  foreign  lenders.  The  financial  statements  in  Supplementary \nAppendix A give the audited financial statements showing the historical actual financial figures.  \n \n34. \nThe  total  receivables  (accounts  receivable  and  other  receivables)  have  increased  from \nSLRs9.3 billion at end-1998 to SLRs12.6 billion by end-2000. This level of receivables is equal \nto  50%  of  electricity  sales  in  2000.  An  improved  collection  effort  will  not  only  achieve  a  better \ncash position, but in the current cash deficit position of CEB it will also lower the total amount of \ndebt servicing particularly the high overdraft interest rate of approximately 21%. Another item of \ninterest  is  the  substantial  revaluation  surplus,  which  had  as  of  end-2000  reached  SLRs112.9 \nbillion. It is highly questionable if the annual revaluation of assets is a sound accounting method \nas  it  would  most  likely  overstate  the  assets,  and  accordingly,  the  total  equity  of  CEB.  It  is \ninteresting that the revaluation surplus is larger than the accumulated depreciation at end-2000. \n \n35. \nIn  the  Government's  efforts  to  restructure  the  power  sector,  it  is  vital  that  the  financial \nhemorrhaging of CEB is contained and reversed. The overall implementation of restructuring is \nexpected  to  take  about  2  years,  from  about  1  January  2003  to  1  January  2005.  During  the \nperiod  from  end-2001  to  end-2004,  CEB  is  likely  to  experience  additional  cash  requirements \nestimated  approximately  SLRs34.9  billion.  The  Government  together  with  CEB  has  been \nrequested to develop a financial plan to show how this cash requirement will be met during the \nimplementation  of  the  restructuring.  The  cash  flow  analysis  is  shown  in  Appendix  7.  The \nproposed  restructuring  is  intended  to  keep  and  ensure  a  financially  and  operationally \nsustainable  power  sector  in  the  future.  However,  it  is  unreasonable  to  expect  that  the  new \npower  sector  will  also  be  able  to  bear  the  mismanagement  of  the  past.  Accordingly,  the \nGovernment  has  developed  a  financial  recovery  plan  that  will  manage  and  liquidate  this  debt \nbacklog.  \n \n36. \nand LECO.  They are as follows: \n \n\nIt  is  proposed  that  six  new  companies  be  incorporated  to  take  over  the  assets  of  CEB \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nOne generation company; \nOne  transmission  company  consisting  of  two  subsidiaries:  (a)  the  system \noperator  and  the  transmission  functions,  and  (b)  one  bulk  power  dealing \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 9\n\ncompany  (BulkPowerCo)  that  will  procure  power  to  meet  the  forecast  demand \nand sell in bulk to distributors; and \nFour distribution companies. \n\n(iii) \n\n \nCustomers and assets have been assigned to the distribution companies in such a way \n37. \nthat  they  should  be  financially  sound  and  able  to  provide  improved  customer  service. \nOperational  and  financial  performance  measures  intended  to  provide  a  degree  of  competition \nare to be set and monitored. \n \n38. \nOpening balance sheets have been prepared for each company and financial projections \nmade  for  5  years  2003-2007.  The  foundation  assumption  for  the  financial  structuring  and \nprojections of the new companies was that each company in the sector is to be run on a fully \ncommercial  basis,  with  prices  reflecting  costs  including  a  return  on  total  capital  employed  of \n17% per annum, and paying income tax and dividends to owners. The approach taken by the \nTA  consultant  in  making  the  projections  and  the  key  assumptions  is  shown  in  Supplementary \nAppendix B \n \n39. \nThree  scenarios  were  evaluated  to  illustrate  the  effect  of  different  pricing/subsidization \npolicies,  principally  on  the  average  level  of  tariffs  that  would  result  and  on  Government  cash \nflows: \n \n\nFully  commercial  operation  with  an  objective  return  of  17%  on  total  capital \nemployed  before  tax  and  interest  and  payment  of  dividends  equal  to  5%  of \nequity; \n\nPartial  subsidization  of  the  sector  by  reducing  the  opening  value  of  hydro \ngeneration companies\u2019 fixed assets by 50%; \n\nAlternative, additional partial subsidization of the sector by reducing the objective \nreturn  on  all  generation  companies'  capital  employed  at  full  asset  valuation  to \n8%;11  \n\n \nTable 1 illustrates the revenue yields required to meet the earnings and other objectives \n40. \nset.  Potential  annual  cash  flows  to  the  Government  are  in  Table  2.  This  is  the  release  by  the \npower sector to the Government of cash for social sector spending. The current cash flow to the \nGovernment from CEB's and LECO's debt service payments is of the order of SLRs5.3 million \nper year. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n                                                 \n11  This  is  equivalent  to  writing  down  the  value  of  fixed  assets  by  53%,  including  those  commissioned  during  2003-\n2007. This is an aggressive course of action, as it implies that new power plants are worth less than half of what \nthey cost. However, it needs to be seen in conjunction with the relatively high revaluation assets of CEB. \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1: Average Revenue Yields \n(SLRs per kWh Sold) \n \nScenario 1 \n\nScenario 2 \n\nCompany \n\nBulkPowerCo \nDisCo-1 \n\nDisCo-2 \n\nDisCo-3 \n\nDisCo-4 \n\nSimple average \n\nIndex \n\nTariff Increase Required \n\n     kWh = kilowatt hour. \n\n6.2266 \n9.7351 \n\n10.1086 \n\n10.0871 \n\n9.7589 \n\n9.9224 \n\n1000 \n\n27% \n\n5.4474 \n8.8460 \n\n9.2059 \n\n9.2035 \n\n8.8951 \n\n9.0376 \n\n911 \n\n15.6% \n\nScenario 3 \n\n5.1405 \n8.4953 \n\n8.8499 \n\n8.8550 \n\n8.5543 \n\n8.6886 \n\n876 \n\n11.2% \n\n \n \n\n \n\nTable 2: Average Annual Cash Flow to Government \n(SLRs million) \n\n6,187 \n\nPayment \n\nDividends \n\nScenario 3 \n\nScenario 2 \n\nScenario 1 \n\nIncome Tax \n\nDebt Service \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n41. \nThe level of future retail tariffs is the main determinant of the degree to which external \nfunding  (both  debt  and  equity)  will  be  necessary  to  support  the  development  of  the  planned \nhydro  schemes  and  the  continuing  extension  and  augmentation  of  the  transmission  and \ndistribution networks while at the same time preserving sound balance sheets.  \n\n31,054 \n\n37,915 \n\n29,664 \n\n25,609 \n\n19,089 \n\n19,271 \n\nTotal  \n\n5,993 \n\n5,139 \n\n5,790 \n\n6,120 \n\n5,437 \n\n \n\n \n\n42. \nThe ESC established a subcommittee to review and fully understand the consequences \nof the various financial scenarios. In terms of outputs, the Government is faced with making a \nnumber  of  policy  decisions  required  on  several  issues  essential  for  fully  the  establishing \ncommercial operations in the restructured power sector: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\nAcceptance of cost-reflective pricing, including commercial rewards to providers \nof capital; \nGovernment funding of social subsidies; \nBasis of valuation of fixed assets to be transferred; \nPrompt payment of Government electricity bills on due date; \nCompanies to raise capital on commercial markets; \nThe  new  companies  to  receive  a  clean  start  in  operations  and  not  be  saddled \nwith consequences of past management decisions; \nThe new companies to be placed on equal footing with IPPs; \n\n(vii) \n(viii)  The  new  companies  to  be  capitalized  on  a  more  commercial  basis  and  the \n\nexisting loan capital replaced. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 11\n\nc. \n\nSocioeconomic Impact \n\n43. \nThe  overall  strategy  of  the  program  loan  as  formulated  is  to  address  bottlenecks  to \neconomic growth and the delivery of high quality supply of electricity to the unserved population. \nAlthough significant tariff increases are needed, the efficiency effects of restructuring the sector \nwill  act  to  bring  down  tariffs  in  the  medium  and  long  term.  While  all  categories  of  electricity \nconsumers  will  be  directly  affected  by  tariff  increases,  the  main  beneficiaries  will  be  the \npopulation residing in unserved areas. These areas are currently not beneficiaries of subsidized \nelectricity tariffs, but are indirectly paying for them in terms of taxes, forgone access to electricity \nor other forgone investments. The full poverty impact assessment prepared for the Program is \npresented  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C.  The  data  show  that  unserved  areas  are  among  the \nmost economically deprived, with the highest proportion of poor people in Sri Lanka. Inflationary \npressures  on  consumer  prices  due  to  tariff  increases  can  be  expected  in  the  short  term. \nHowever,  the  alternative  scenario,  with  CEB  exacerbating  the  fiscal  deficit,  is  likely  to  lead  to \nmore widespread and persistent inflation.  \n \nThe  Program  will  result  in  efficiency  gains  with  a  positive  impact  on  economic  growth \n44. \nand  poverty  reduction.  As  large  consumers  will  be  better  able  to  capture  these  gains,  the \nconsumer  consultative  process  will  be  strengthened.  Such  strengthening  will  also  increase \nconsumer awareness, resulting in better dialogue, and enhance the role of electricity regulatory \ncommission.  Despite  these  measures,  gradual  tariff  increases  will  be  required  to  restore  the \nfinancial health of CEB and LECO. The increases have been designed to have minimal impact \non  the  poor  by  maintaining  a  lifeline  tariff  for  poor  households.  A  strong  consumer  awareness \nprogram  under  ADB  TA  will  help  ensure  public  understanding  and  promote  better  dialogue \nbetween  the  public  and  the  regulatory  commission.  Under  the  regulatory  commission,  a \nconsumer  consultative  committee  will  be  established  to  (i)  advise  the  commission  on \nappropriate  consumer  standards;  (ii)  monitor  electricity  consumer  satisfaction;  (iii)  promote \nawareness of consumer rights and standards; and (iv) receive and, where it has the power to do \nso, deal with complaints and concerns of electricity consumers.  \n\n \n45. \nThe  Program  will  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  employment  pattern  of  the  power \nsector, particularly CEB and LECO employees. The Government has assured that there will be \nno  involuntary  retrenchment  of  CEB  and  LECO  employees.  The  Government  has  sought  the \nassistance  of  ADB  to  develop  a  detailed  implementation  plan  for  the  restructuring  process, \nincluding  help  in  establishing  the  new  entities  in  terms  of  allocation  of  assets  and  liabilities, \nallocation of staff resources, and development of sound commercial business practices. \n \n\nd. \n\nGovernance \n\n46. \nA major cornerstone in the dialogue with the Government has been the development of \na  transparent  regulatory  framework.  The  main  objective  is  to  design  a  regulatory  commission \nthat  would  ensure  autonomy  and  accountability.  The  autonomy  sought  is  not  only  from  the \nGovernment  but  also  from  other  participants  in  the  power  sector  such  as  utilities  and \nconsumers. The commission will be funded by an end-user fee; have responsibilities related to \nthe  tariff-setting  mechanism  and  actual  tariff  level,  approval  of  sector  licenses  (generation, \ntransmission, distribution), approval of development plans; and ensure government payment of \nliabilities such as subsidies. The role of the Government will  be limited to policy making in areas \nsuch  as  taxation,  subsidies,  and  privatization.  The  regulatory  commission  will  implement \nGovernment policies. \n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\ne. \n\nInternal Reforms \n\n47.  With the recent poor showing of internal governance and transparency together with the \ncontinuing  financial  deterioration  of  CEB,  there  is  a  need  to  immediately  increase  internal \noperational efficiencies. Simplifying procedural hurdles to obtain official connections will reduce \nthe nonmonetary barriers to access the network, and simultaneously reduce illegal connections. \nThis effort will also reduce system losses. \n \nConsidering  the  financial  situation  of  CEB,  there  is  a  need  to  establish  an  up-to-date \n48. \ncomputerized financial and accounting system for each segment of CEB\u2019s business operations. \nThe  systems  must  be  developed  in  a  manner  that  would  ensure  transferability  to  the  new \ncompanies when they are established. A treasury system will also enhance CEB\u2019s knowledge of \nits  flow  of  revenues  and  expenses,  operational  expenses  as  well  as  capital  expenses.  This \nsystem enhancement effort should culminate in an overall management information system.  \n \n49. \nAssignments according to budget allocations and operational performance targets result \nin  increased  efficiencies  and  a  more  focused  management  and  workforce.  Successful \nimplementation of the reform initiatives will also hinge on the motivation and enthusiasm of CEB \nand  LECO\u2019s  management  and  workforce.  An  interim  period  when  the  focus  is  on  setting \nperformance targets and achieving them will prepare the workforce for the environment they will \nface after restructuring. Accordingly, the stress due to the changes will be reduced. \n \n\n4. \n\nFinancing Plan and Counterpart Funds \n\nThe  policy  loan  of  $60.0  million,  will  support  reforms  and  restructuring  in  the  power \n50. \nsector.  The  counterpart  funds  to  be  generated  from  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  by  the \nGovernment,  under  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB,  to  support  the  financial  restructuring  of \nCEB/LECO. In particular, (i) to support the financial restructuring of CEB and adjustment costs \nassociated  with  the  Program  estimated  to  be  $110  million,  including:  payment  of  outstanding \ndues of the Borrower's agencies and state owned enterprises ($10 million), retirement of CEB's \ndefault public debt ($65 million), pension liabilities on account of organizational and institutional \nsector  reforms  ($6.5  million),  and  technical  equipment  directly  linked  to  the  restructuring \n($28.50 million); and (ii) to provide part of the counterpart funds to support (a) the payment of \noutstanding  government  bodies'  dues  owed  to  CEB  and  (b) reduction  of  debt  obligations  of \nCEB. The counterpart funds will fund about 55% of the estimated adjustment costs. \n \n\n5. \n\nImplementation Arrangements  \n\na. \n\nProgram Management \n\nThe  Executing  Agency  (EA)  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  the  Implementing \n51. \nAgency  is  the  Energy  Supply  Committee  (ESC).  The  Program  is  scheduled  to  begin  in \nNovember 2002 and be completed by December 2004. The Borrower will certify that the volume \nof  eligible  imports  exceeds  the  amount  of  ADB's  projected  disbursements  under  the  program \nloan in a given period. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify \nthe accuracy of the Borrower's certification. \n \n\nb. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n52. \nIn accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for \nprogram loans, goods and services produced in and originating from ADB member countries will \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 13\n\nbe  procured,  with  due  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency,  in  accordance  with  standard \npublic sector procedures in Sri Lanka. \n \n53. \nThe proceeds of the Policy Loan will be disbursed for a broad range of imports, subject \nto a negative list of ineligible items (Appendix 8). Loan proceeds will be disbursed on the basis \nof  a  certification  provided  by  the  Borrower,  confirming  that  in  each  year  in  which  Policy  Loan \nproceeds  are  expected  to  be  disbursed,  the  value  of  total  imports  minus  (i)  imports  from \nnonmember  countries,  (ii)  ineligible  imports,  and  (iii)  imports  financed  under  other  official \ndevelopment assistance, is equal to or greater than the amount expected to be disbursed during \nthe  year.  The  Government  will  open  an  account  (the  deposit  account)  at  Central  Bank  of  Sri \nLanka into which the proceeds of the loans will be deposited and from which all withdrawals will \nbe made. Monthly statements of the deposit account will be attached to the semiannual report of \nthe Policy Loan. \n \n\nc. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching \n\nThe policy loan will be released in two tranches based on the fulfillment of the conditions \n54. \nper  tranche  as  shown  in  the  policy  matrix  (Appendix  1).  The  tranches  will  be  of  equal  size, \namounting to $30 million each. The tranches are expected to be released in the fourth quarter of \n2002, and in December 2003. \n \n55. \nFirst Tranche - $30.0 million. The major first tranche conditions are as follows: (i) the \nGovernment  to  enact  the  Public  Utilities  Commission  Bill  and  the  Electricity  Reform  Bill  in \nParliament,  (ii)  Government  pays  all  its  agencies'  and  state-owned  enterprises'  dues  owed  to \nCEB as of 30 August 2002 (SLRs800 million); (iii) CEB reduces the levels of net receivables to \n2.5 months of electricity sales; and (iv) the Government guarantees the provision of a facility for \nfunding  CEB\u2019s  cumulative  cash  shortfall  from  31  December  2000  to  31  December  2003  or  on \nthe date of completed restructuring, whichever is sooner.  \n \n56. \nSecond Tranche - $30.0 million. The second tranche conditions include the following: \n(i)  the  Borrower  should  establish  the  Public  Utilities  Commission  and  appoint  the  members  of \nthe Public Utilities Commission; (ii) the Public Utilities Commission should independently issue \nrules  and  standards  for  tariff  setting  and  licensing  of  generation,  transmission  and  distribution \ncompanies  and  for  the  purchase  and  sale  of  power  in  accordance  with  the  Governing  Law; \n(iii) the  new  transmission,  generation,  and  distribution  companies  created  under  the  Program \nshould  obtain  all  necessary  licenses  and  commenced  operations;  (iv)  the  Borrower  should \nimplement  the  unbundling  of  CEB's  generation,  transmission  and  distribution  functions  in \naccordance with the Detailed Implementation Plan; and, (v) the Borrower, CEB, or LECO, as the \ncase  may  be,  should  secure  letters  of  no-objection  form  major  lenders  for  the  detailed \nrestructuring. \n \n\nd. \n\nProgram Performance Monitoring, Review, and Evaluation \n\n57. \nESC will prepare quarterly progress reports for the program component, and submit the \nreports  to  ADB  within  30  days  from  the  end  of  each  quarter.  As  a  minimum,  the  reports  will \ndescribe  the  progress  made  during  the  quarter,  changes  to  the  implementation  schedule, \nproblems and/or issues encountered and remedial actions taken, and the work to be undertaken \nin the following period.  \n \n58. \nOn the basis of the quarterly reports, ADB will review the implementation and operations \nof  the  Program,  and  will  conduct  semiannual  review  missions  to  discuss  the  progress  of  the \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\nProgram with Government officials and related agencies/companies. At the end of the Program, \nESC  will  submit  the  completion  report  to  ADB  within  3  months  of  physical  completion  of  the \nprogram conditions. \n \nD. \n\nThe Project Loan \n\n1. \n\nObjectives \n\nADB will consider a sector loan of $70 million from its Asian Development Fund (ADF) \n59. \nresources,  with  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  interest  of  1% \nduring  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  thereafter.  The  Borrower  will  be  the  Democratic  Socialist \nRepublic of Sri Lanka and the Executing Agency will be CEB, and its successor companies. The \nGovernment will provide the total loan component for rural electrification (RE), taxes and duties \nas equity to CEB. The CEB will bear other local costs in implementing the project. The Borrower \nwill bear the foreign exchange risk on the loan. \n \n\n2. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n60. \nThe  project  components  are  as  follows:  Part  A  \u2013  Rural  Electrification,  Part  B  \u2013  33kV \nDistribution  System,  and  Part  C  \u2013  132kV  Transmission  lines  and  substations.  Details  of  the \nProject components are given in Appendix 9. \n \n\n3. \n\nImportant Features \n\na. \n\nEnvironment \n\n61. \nThe proposed project component of the Program is category \"B\" in ADB's classification \nsystem. Concerning the distribution lines and substations, the initial environmental examination \n(IEE) reports for three sample project components were prepared (the summary is attached as \nSupplementary Appendix D). The IEEs show that the overall adverse environmental impacts will \nbe  very  minimal  and  temporary,  related  mostly  to  land  clearing  activities  (e.g.,  temporary \nchange in land use, and tree cutting). The proposed mitigation measures identified by the IEE \nare manageable and will be incorporated into the bidding documents, bills of quantity, and other \ncontractual obligations of the contractors. \n \n62. \nThe  potential  environmental  impacts  of  the  project  activities  were  evaluated.  Most \nimpacts  are  considered  positive  and  beneficial  to  Sri  Lanka.  The  new  electricity  legislation \nshould properly guide the regulator to require environmental impact assessment (EIA/IEE) and \nincreased public participation to be conducted by the licensee for each new investment project.  \n \nCEB  will  prepare  an  IEE  for  other  project  components  in  accordance  with  the \n63. \nGovernment's  environmental  laws  and  regulations  as  well  as  ADB's  environmental  impact \nassessment requirements. \n \n\nb. \n\nPoverty and Social Dimensions \n\n64. \nThe  benefits  of  electrification  include  several  dimensions  of  social  and  economic  well \nbeing.  Targeted  project  beneficiaries  will  benefit  directly  through  substantial  cost  savings  on \nalternative  energy  sources  and  savings  of  time  and  effort  in  household  activities.  Newly \nelectrified  villages  undergo  fundamental  economic  transformation  where  the  provision  of \nelectricity  lays  the  foundation  for  structural  change  and  economic  growth  in  rural  areas. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 15\n\nElectrification  enhances  the  scope  for  productive  off-farm  income-generating  opportunities \nenabling the poor to diversify income sources, reduce risks and benefit from other development \ninputs  important  for  poverty  reduction,  such  as  clean  water,  sanitation,  health,  and  education. \nElectricity means longer business hours for the local stores and enhances social interaction in \nthe village. \n \n65. \nAlthough  energy  is  biased  in  favor  of  women  in  terms  of  workloads,  time  savings,  and \nexposure to indoor air pollution, the direct benefits of access to electricity appears to be gender \nneutral  since  it  is  not  commonly  used  for  cooking  purposes  in  rural  areas.  The  gender \ndevelopment  index  displays  little  direct  relation  with  either  access  to  electricity  or  monthly \nexpenditure. But given the high proportion of female heads of households below the poverty line \nin rural areas and the relationship between electrification and poverty, the overall economic and \nhuman development resulting from electricity will favor women to the extent of a gender bias in \nother  development  factors.  When  electric  water  pumps  become  available  women\u2019s  workload \nand associated health implications will be reduced. \n \nDespite the availability of socioeconomic data on RE, CEB needs to update and improve \n66. \nits database to capture consumer behavior and long-term benefits. To enhance the abilities of \nCEB to address, collect, analyze and monitor social benefits, environment, land acquisition, and \npoverty impact of the RE component, the Government will establish a fully functional social and \nenvironmental  management  cell  and  placed  it  under  the  responsibility  of  CEB\u2019s  Rural \nElectrification Unit or its successor companies. \n \n\nc. \n\nResettlement \n\n67. \nADB's  involuntary  resettlement  policy  defines  resettlement  as  any  impact  on  land  or \nassets and means of livelihood. Resettlement may or may not involve physical relocation. The \ninvestment project consists of both RE schemes and substations and associated transmission \nlines. All subprojects will require insignificant resettlement. Indigenous people are not affected. \n \n68. \nTransmission. CEB will implement four subprojects that include three new sub-stations \nand associated transmission lines. Existing facilities will be improved. A resettlement framework \nand  a  core  subproject  resettlement  plan  have  been  prepared.  CEB  will  ensure  that  a \nresettlement plan (RP) is prepared for each subproject according to procedures described in the \nframework and submitted to ADB for review and approval before awarding civil works contracts. \nRPs will be prepared in accordance with the national involuntary resettlement policy and ADB\u2019s \nHandbook on Resettlement. ADB formats for preparing resettlement plans (short and detailed), \nresettlement  framework  evaluation  and  a  checklist  for  involuntary  resettlement  have  been \nconveyed to CEB. CEB will select subprojects that, other things being equal, avoid or minimize \nland acquisition and resettlement. On completion of the technical designs and when submitting \nthe draft bidding documents, CEB will submit completed involuntary resettlement checklists for \neach  sub-project.  A  resettlement  framework  is  attached  as  Appendix  10.  A  summary \nresettlement  plan  for  a  sample  project  for  the  transmission  component  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix E. \n \n69. \nRural  Electrification  Schemes.  CEB  confirms  that  all  subprojects  selected  under  the \nschemes  are  in  category  B,  with    \u201cinsignificant\u201d  resettlement.  Except  for  clearing  the  way  by \ncutting trees, no land acquisition or resettlement is required. All substations will be mounted on \npoles  on  public  land.  CEB  submitted  a  RP  that  applies  to  all  subprojects.  To  ensure  timely \npayment,  CEB  confirms  that  the  funds  for  compensation  in  year  1  of  implementation  are \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\navailable  as  well  as  in  subsequent  years.  The  RP  for  all  subprojects  is  attached  as \nSupplementary Appendix F.  \n \n70. \nCapacity  Building  for  CEB.  CEB  does  not  have  dedicated  staff  to  address  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement.  The  implementing  consultants,  contracted  under  the  technical \nassistance for Phase II (footnote 9), will assess and recommend an appropriate organizational \nstructure  for  handling  resettlement  in  future  CEB  operations  and  those  of  the  successor \ncompanies. The recommendations will be based on the needs of the different companies under \nthe reorganized CEB. The assessment will consider generation, transmission, and distribution, \nall  of  which  entail  resettlement  impacts  of  different  magnitude.  CEB  will  implement  the \nrecommendations  and  help  the  consultant  establish  the  unit/s.  Training  will  be  provided  under \nthe generation component. Staff in both transmission and distribution will be trained. \n \n\n4. \n\nFinancing Plan  \n\n71. \n\nThe summary cost estimates of the project components are given in Table 4.  \n\n \nTable 4: Summary Cost Estimate \n($ million) \n \n\nForeign Exchange \n \n \n17.7 \n4.7 \n18.7 \n41.1 \n \n \n4.1 \n2.3 \n6.4 \n \n0.0 \n5.8 \n\nLocal Currency \n \n \n19.0 \n3.9 \n3.3 \n26.2 \n \n \n2.6 \n6.2 \n8.8 \n \n12.2 \n7.4 \n\nTotal Cost \n \n \n36.7 \n8.6 \n22.0 \n67.3 \n \n \n6.7 \n8.5 \n15.2 \n \n12.2 \n13.2 \n\n53.3 \n\n54.6 \n\n107.9 \n\nItem \n \nA.

CEB's general manager and additional general manager for distribution and customer \nservices  will  supervise  the  project  managers  and  teams  who  will  implement  CEB's  rural \nelectrification and 33kV distribution components. CEB's general manager and additional general \nmanagers for planning and transmission will supervise the project managers and teams who will \nimplement CEB's transmission component. Before implementation, these groups from CEB will \nprepare  appraisal  reports  for  all  proposed  subprojects  for  ADB\u2019s  review  and  approval.  The \nsubprojects will be evaluated and selected based on the economic evaluation model, as used \nduring the implementation of the Second Power System Expansion (Sector) Project (footnote 1), \nand modified for establishing a poverty impact indicator. As per prior agreement with ADB, the \nsame \nto  ensure  successful  project \nimplementation in CEB's successor entities. \n \n\nimplementation  arrangements  will  be  established \n\nb. \n\nPeriod of Implementation \n\nImplementation  of  the  Project  will  begin  in  December  2002  and  be  completed  in \n74. \nDecember 2006 (Appendix 11). CEB will be responsible for directly supervising implementation \nand  monitoring  of  the  operational  performance  of  the  project  components,  and  will  submit \nquarterly  progress  reports  to  the  Government  and  ADB  within  30  days  from  the  end  of  each \nquarter. ADB will review the implementation and operation of the Project based on these reports \nand meet with the Government and CEB at least semiannually to discuss project progress. ADB \nwill also monitor the overall financial and technical performance of the power sector in relation to \nthe Government's fiscal position. \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\nc. \n\nProcurement \n\n75. \nGoods  and  services  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement.  For  such  procurement,  bid  specifications  will  be  prepared  in  a  manner  as  to \nensure  maximum  competition  under  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures.  Each \nsupply  contract  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  $500,000  or  more  will  be  awarded  on  the \nbasis  of  ICB.  Each  contract  estimated  to  cost  less  than  the  equivalent  of  $500,000  will  be \nawarded  on  the  basis  of  international  shopping.  For  the  RE  schemes  under  Part  A,  CEB\u2019s \nstandard  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  procedure  may  be  used  for  the  manufacture  of \naluminum  conductors  and  procurement  of  concrete  poles,  line  hardware,  and  accessories.  To \nencourage  the  local  industry,  it  is  proposed  that  CEB  be  permitted  to  give  price  preference  to \ndomestic  manufacturers  participating  in  international  bids  under  the  Project,  as  per  ADB \nscheme for such preferences. After a review of the project components, it was agreed that such \nprice  preferences  will  be  limited  to  15%  in  line  with  the  national  trend  of  opening  sectoral \nprocesses to global competition and thereby benefit from price reductions. \n \nThe  CEB  successor  companies  will  also  follow  ADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement  in \n76. \nprocuring  goods  and  services  financed  by  ADB  under  the  Program.  CEB's  successor \ncompanies will establish new procurement procedures/practices in line with their new existence \nunder  the  Companies  Act.  The  new  procurement  procedures  will  follow  efficient  and  effective \nbest  market  practices  and  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  approved  detailed \nimplementation  plan  and  under  the  TA  provided  by  ADB  for  implementing  phase  II  of  power \nsector restructuring. \n \n\nd. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n77. \nADB\u2019s direct payment, commitment letter, or reimbursement procedures will be applied \nin procuring goods, materials, equipment, and services. An imprest account will be established \nto  facilitate  disbursement  of  the  local  costs  financed  under  the  ADB  loan.  The  disbursements \nwill  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook,  January  2001.  A  list  of  the \nmajor  contract  packages  under  the  Project  with  their  cost  estimates  is  in  Appendix  12. \nRetroactive financing will not be allowed. \n \n\ne. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n78. \nCEB  will  prepare  separate  semiannual  progress  reports  for  its  respective  components \nand  submit  them  to  ADB  within  30  days  of  the  end  of  each  half  year.  The  reports  will  be  a \nnarrative  description  of  progress  made  during  the  period,  changes  to  the  implementation \nschedule,  problems  or  difficulties  encountered,  the  performance  of  the  project  implementation \nconsultants, and work to be carried out in the next period. The reports will include a summary \nfinancial  account  for  the  Project  consisting  of  project  expenditures  during  the  period,  year  to \ndate, and total expenditure to date. From these reports, ADB will review the implementation and \noperation  of  the  Project  and  meet  with  the  EAs  and  the  Government  at  least  semiannually  to \ndiscuss  the  progress  of  the  Project.  Completion  reports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  3 \nmonths of project completion. \n \n79. \nCEB  and  the  successor  companies  participating  in  this  Project  will  have  their  annual \nfinancial  statements  \u2013  including  the  income  statement,  balance  sheet,  and  sources  and \napplication  of  funds  statement  \u2013  audited  by  a  professional  auditing  firm  acceptable  to  ADB. \nAudited statements will be submitted to ADB within 9 months of the close of the financial year. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 19\n\nCEB  will  also  submit  to  ADB  audited  project  accounts  and  the  auditors\u2019  observations  with \nrespect to compliance with the loan covenants. \n \n\nf. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n80. \nCEB  will  prepare  and  submit  subproject  appraisal  reports  for  the  Project  to  ADB  for \nreview  and  approval.  The  procedures  for  subproject  selection,  appraisal,  and  approval  are \ndescribed  in  detail  in  Supplementary  Appendix  G.  For  part  A,  subproject  appraisals  will  follow \nprocedures similar to those used for the RE schemes under the ongoing Second Power System \nExpansion Sector Project (footnote 7). \n \n81. \nFor  each  subproject,  an  appraisal  report  with  an  IEE  and  RP,  if  necessary,  will  be \nprepared. Subprojects under part B should have an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of at \nleast 12%. For RE subprojects under part A, the minimum EIRR will be 12%. In addition, ADB \nwill  review  the  existing  socio-economic  data  and  economic  analysis  for  subprojects  for  the \npurpose  of  including  poverty  targeting  performance  indicators  in  selecting  subprojects.  These \nperformance indicators are included in the subproject appraisal reports. \n \n82. \nThe investment component will primarily benefit poor consumers. CEB or its successor \ncompanies  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  consumer  behavior  and  the  benefits  of  the  RE \ncomponent.  To  enhance  CEB's  ability  to  address,  collect  data  on,  and  analyze  and  monitor \nsocial  benefits,  environment,  land  acquisition,  and  poverty  impact  of  the  RE  component,  the \nGovernment will establish a fully functional social and environmental management cell and put it \nunder  the  responsibility  of  CEB\u2019s  Rural  Electrification  Unit  or  a  related  department  in  the \nsuccessor companies. \n \n\ng. \n\nProject Review \n\nProject  implementation  will  begin  in  December  2002  and  be  completed  by  December \n83. \n2006  (Appendix  11).  CEB  or  the  successor  companies'  agencies  will  be  responsible  for  the \noperational  performance  of  the  project  components.  These  will  submit  quarterly  progress \nreports  to  the  Government  and  ADB  within  30  days  from  the  end  of  each  quarter.  ADB  will \nreview the implementation and operation of the Project based on these reports and meet with \nthe  Government  and  CEB/LECO  at  least  semiannually  to  discuss  project  progress.  ADB  will \nalso monitor the overall financial and technical performance of the power sector in relation to the \nGovernment's fiscal position.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nExpected Impacts \n\n1. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\na. \n\nProgram Component \n\n84. \nThe  program  component  will  establish  a  financially  self-sufficient  power  sector  through \nthe restructuring effort. The power sector is envisaged to positively contribute to the economic \ndevelopment of Sri Lanka through a sufficient quantity of electricity and sustainable tariff levels. \nA major portion of the Program is also geared toward reestablishing the financial soundness of \nCEB  during  the  transition  period,  so  as  to  give  the  successor  companies  a  sound  financial \nplatform, from which they can commence operations. \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\nb. \n\nProject Component \n\n85. \nIn  the  financial  analysis  of  the  project  component  (Appendix  13)  the  RE  is  financially \nmarginal (financial internal rate of return [FIRR] is negative). The investment cost is higher than \nthe financial benefits gained from the outputs of the component, as the Project caters mainly to \npoor  rural  consumers.  In  ADB\u2019s  experience  with  RE  projects,  the  FIRR  calculations  are \nnegative, but the financial loss directly attributed to the Project is outweighed by the substantial \neconomic benefits, both direct and indirect as described in the next section.  \n \n\n2. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\na. \n\nProgram Component \n\n86. \nThe  overall  strategy  of  the  proposed  Project  is  to  address  bottlenecks  to  economic \ngrowth and to the delivery a high-quality supply of electricity to the unserved population. On the \none  hand,  the  inefficiency  and  financial  losses  of  CEB  reduce  its  ability  to  pursue  RE  and \nmaintain a high-quality supply to rural areas. On the other, the deterioration of CEB exacerbates \nthe  severe  fiscal  deficit  that  raises  concern  about  future  ability  of  the  Government  to  invest  in \nsectors more productive for economic growth and poverty reduction. Although funds are not fully \nfungible, the linkage between fiscal space and CEB\u2019s losses is clear. The opportunity costs of \nthe financial cash shortfall of CEB in terms of social sector spending amounts to 22% for fiscal \nyear 2001. \n87. \nIn  the  absence  of  sector  reform  and  necessary  tariff  increases,  the  situation  can  only \nworsen. While all categories of electricity consumers will be directly affected by tariff increases, \nthe  main  beneficiaries  will  be  the  population  residing  in  unserved  areas.  These  areas  are \ncurrently not beneficiaries of the subsidized electricity tariffs, but are indirectly paying for them in \nterms of forgone access to electricity or other forgone investments. The need for tariff increases \nwill  result  in  inflationary  pressures  on  the  general  price  level  in  the  short  term.  However,  the \nalternative is dismal. Fiscal imbalances not only result in inflation but also act to reduce investor \nconfidence  in  the  economy.  Government  and  CEB  borrowing  from  the  banking  sector  further \ncrowds  out  private  investments  and  raises  the  interest  rate.  The  consequences  of  no  sector \nreform on economic growth and poverty reduction would devastate the Sri Lankan economy. \n \n\nb. \n\nProject Component  \n\n88. \nIn the economic analysis of the RE investments (Appendix 13) the benefits derive from \ntwo  sources:  (i)  the  replacement  costs  of  alternative  energy  sources  that  would  be  used  for \nlighting in the absence of electricity, and (ii) the incremental benefits from increased electricity \nconsumption.  Residential  consumers  whose  primary  use  for  electricity  is  for  lighting  are \ndifferentiated by household size. Industrial users, on the other hand, use power for machinery in \naddition  to  lighting.  Overall,  the  RE  investments  have  an  EIRR  of  23.6%,  with  the  bulk  of  the \nbenefits coming from the additional power consumed. Sensitivity analysis of the level of system \nlosses,  mix  of  hydro  and  thermal  generation,  and  price  of  oil  show  that  the  RE  investments \nachieve an EIRR in excess of 20% even under conservative assumptions. \n \n89. \nThe economic analysis considers only a narrow range of project benefits. Unquantifiable \nbenefits  of  electrification  include  a  variety  of  dimensions  of  social  and  economic  well-being. \nTargeted project beneficiaries will benefit directly through substantial cost savings on alternative \nenergy sources, and savings in time and effort for household activities. Newly electrified villages \nin the rural areas where the provision of electricity lays the foundation for structural change and \neconomic  growth  undergo  fundamental  economic  transformation.  Electrification  enhances  the \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 21\n\nscope  for  productive  off-farm  income-generating  opportunities  enabling  the  poor  to  diversify \nincome sources, reduce risks and benefit from other development inputs important for poverty \nreduction,  such  as  clean  water,  sanitation,  health,  and  education.  Electricity  means  longer \nbusiness hours for the local stores and enhances social interaction in the village. As such, the \nestimated EIRR is likely to be conservative. \n \n90. \nAlthough  energy  is  biased  in  favor  of  women  in  terms  of  workloads,  time  savings,  and \nexposure to indoor air pollution the direct benefits of access to electricity appears to be gender \nneutral  since  it  is  not  commonly  used  for  cooking  purposes  in  rural  areas.  The  gender \ndevelopment  index  displays  little  direct  relation  with  either  access  to  electricity  or  monthly \nexpenditure. But given the high proportion of female heads of households below the poverty line \nin rural areas and the relationship between electrification and poverty, the overall economic and \nhuman development resulting from electricity will favor women to the extent of a gender bias in \nother  development  factors.  When  electric  water  pumps  become  available,  women\u2019s  workload \nand associated health implications will be reduced. \n \nDespite the availability of socioeconomic data on RE, CEB needs to update and improve \n91. \nits database to capture consumer behavior and long-term benefits. To enhance the abilities of \nCEB  to  address,  collect  data  on  and  analyze  and  monitor  social  benefits,  environment,  land \nacquisition,  and  poverty  impact  of  the  RE  component,  the  Government  will  establish  a  fully \nfunctional  social  and  environmental  management  cell  and  put  it  under  the  responsibility  of \nCEB\u2019s Rural Electrification Unit or its successor companies. \n \n\nc. \n\nPoverty Reduction Impact \n\n92. \nThe  investment  under  the  Project  will  benefit  rural  areas,  which  suffer  from  higher \npoverty  rates  than  the  national  average.  Based  on  the  most  recent  figures,  which  exclude  the \nnorth  and  east,  the  poverty  rate  in  the  rural  areas  of  Sri  Lanka  is  41%  compared  with  39% \noverall.12  Moreover,  the  Project  will  be  implemented  islandwide,  including  the  north  and  east, \nwhere  anecdotal  evidence  suggests  the  poverty  rates  are  much  higher  due  to  of  the  civil \nconflict. The RE component under parts A and B is comprised of 600 individual subprojects that \nwill  supply  electricity  to  about  112,500  new  consumers  in  820  villages  during  the  course  of \nproject implementation. This represents a 5% increase in electrification coverage in Sri Lanka. \nImproved poverty targeting for the RE investments will be achieved through the provision of a \nrevolving  fund  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  to  cover  the  electricity \nconnection costs for poor households. \n \n93. \nEconomic analysis shows that the average expenditure on lighting for a poor household \nis  nearly  50%  lower  for  an  electrified  household.  Thus,  electrification  of  poor  households \nrepresents a pro-poor redistribution of purchasing power. In addition, the inconvenience of the \nirregular availability of kerosene in the local store entails transaction and search costs. Although \nthe  ability  to  purchase  electrical  appliances  constrains  electricity  consumptions  and  thus \nbenefits  \u2013  for  poor  households  \u2013  the  additional  benefits  of  residing  in  an  electrified  village  are \nsubstantial, even if the household is not electrified. Electricity is essential for attracting off-farm \nbusiness  opportunities.  Off-farm  income-generating  activities  have  been  identified  as  key  for \nreducing income deprivation among the poor. In addition, the diversified income sources reduce \nvulnerability. The detailed poverty reduction and social strategy is presented in Appendix 14. \n \n\n                                                 \n12  The most recent figures are from 1995/96, and the officially defined poverty line in Sri Lanka is SLRs742 per adult \n\nper month, excluding the north and east regions.  \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\n \n\nAlthough  nonelectrified  poor  households \n\nin  electrified  villages  obviously  benefit \n94. \nindirectly,  they  are  deprived  of  direct  benefits.  Cost  savings  are  especially  significant  among \nthese benefits. The inability to overcome up-front connection charges prevents households from \nbeing  electrified.  To  ensure  poverty  targeting  and  enhance  the  benefits  to  the  poor  under  the \nproject component, a proposal for a power fund for the poor is submitted for funding by a grant \nfrom JFPR.13 \n \nB. \n\nRisks and Safeguards \n\nSeveral perceived risks linked to the sector development program need to be mitigated. \n\n95. \nThe risks and their mitigation are summarized here. \n \n(i) \n\nRegulatory risks. The success of the entire power sector reform program hinges on the \nconviction that actions in the power sector will be based on commercial principles, such \nas  a  tariff  mechanism  that  will  ensure  improved  operating  efficiencies  and  enable  the \nnew  companies  to  earn  a  fair  rate  of  return  on  their  investments  in  accordance  with \nactual  performance.  To  depoliticize  the  tariff-setting  mechanism  process  in  Sri  Lanka, \nthe  Program  ensures  the  establishment  of  a  statutory  regulatory  authority  whose \nresponsibilities  includes  tariff  setting  and  licensing.  The  new  electricity  bill  also  has \nstringent  eligibility  criteria  for  the  commissioners,  to  ensure  that  the  commission  works \nproperly. \n\nEnforcement  of  decisions.    The  decisions  of  the  regulatory  commission  have  to  be \nimplemented by the new companies in the sector, sometimes with the assistance of the \nGovernment.  Accordingly,  confidence  related  to  the  decisions  of  the  Commission, \nespecially those that are politically unattractive has to be established. To demonstrate its \nwill  to  make  difficult  political  decisions,  the  Government  introduced  an  average  tariff \nincrease of 35% on 1 April 2002 when it created CEB's successor companies. Further, it \nwill develop a finance plan that will consist of further tariff hikes to meet the rising cost of \nsupply. \n\nCorporate  governance.  Corporate  governance  is  defined  here  as  the  independence \nand  effectiveness  of  the  board  of  directors.  Corporate  governance  as  well  as  the \noperational  effectiveness  of  CEB  and  CEB\u2019s  successor  companies  that  will  be  created \nduring the reform period will be crucial in determining the success, or its absence in the \npower  sector  restructuring  efforts.  Embedded  in  the  new  system  are  processes  to \nstrengthen  the  companies\u2019  capacity  to  increase  efficiencies  and  improve  those \nefficiencies as the companies mature. \n\n \n96. \nThe  board  of  directors  and  senior  management  of  the  new  companies  will  be  primarily \nstaffed by members from outside the Government, who have the necessary expertise and skills \nto  commercially  develop  the  entities.  Operational  and  financial  performance  is  expected  to \nimprove from the current level as a direct result of the above measures. \n \nProcurement evaluation, procedures, and authority levels have all caused project delays \n97. \nand  questionable  governance  behavior.  Proper  delegation  of  authority,  responsibility,  and \naccountability  is  crucial  in  establishing  the  new  companies.  The  establishment  of  the  new \n\n                                                 \n13 The proposal received concept clearance from the JFPR committee on 13 July 2001 and was concurred in by the \nGovernment at the MOU of Appraisal Mission 25 June 2002. The draft proposal will be submitted by October 2002 \nto the Government of Japan, and the President's approval is expected in December 2002. \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 23\n\ncompanies under the Companies' Act will ensure the development of appropriate procurement \nand accountability procedures. \n \n98. \nCustomer  orientation  has  been  a  neglected  area  in  CEB\u2019s  operations.  The  creation  of \nthe  new  companies,  and  increased  accountability  at  all  levels,  will  prepare  employees  and \nassure customers of a more efficient and responsive management style.   \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents, \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n99. \nthe Government has given the following assurances. \n \n\n1. \n\nAdministrative \n\n100.  The Government will, at all times, support and respect the autonomy of CEB, LECO, and \nits successor entities in securing their commercial, operational, and administrative interests. \n \n101.  The Government will assist CEB\u2019s successor entities to expeditiously meet the legal and \nadministrative requirements related to making applications, and obtaining permits and licenses. \n \n102.  The long-term sustainability of the power sector \u2013 financial, economic, operational, and \nadministrative  viability  \u2013  depends  on  the  restructuring  of  the  sector.  In  developing  the  reform \nprogram, ESC is developing and will approve the following plans: \n\n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\nfinance restructuring plan, \nfinancial recovery plan,  \ndetailed implementation plan,  \npersonnel plan, and \ninformation strategy and implementation plan. \n\n \n103.  The Government will make every effort to implement the plans and recommendations of \nESC, in a manner satisfactory to ADB. ESC will also monitor the program loan component. \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial \n\n104.  Considering the financial deterioration of CEB, the Government will commit in advance \nto financially support the utility during the transition period from an integrated utility to separate \nentities under the restructured power sector. \n \n105.  The  Government  will  make  timely  and  adequate  budgetary  appropriations  to  any \ndirected programs to meet its subsidy payment liabilities, if any, to ensure that all subsidy dues \nare  paid  in  cash  to  CEB,  or  its  successor  companies,  no  later  than  six  months  of  the  date  of \nclaim by such entity. An example of such a program is capital subsidies for RE.  \n \n106.  The Government will make timely and adequate budgetary appropriations to ensure that \nCEB\u2019s,  or  its  successor  companies\u2019,  balance  of  receivables  from  municipalities  and  other \ngovernment entities will not exceed 2.5 months equivalent of billings. \n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nSector Reforms \n\n107.  Public  awareness  campaigns  and  participatory  strategy  will  be  developed  and \nimplemented to gain broad-based public support for to the restructuring of the power sector. \n \n108.  For  the  personnel  plan,  the  Government  ensures  adoption  of  a  straightforward  set  of \npolicies,  consultative  process,  prudent  transfer  arrangements,  incentive  for  skills  acquisition, \nand  a  sector-wide  transitional  training  program  as  practical  means  of  setting  up  new \norganizations.  The  Government  will  make  the  necessary  funds  available,  as  required,  for \npersonnel redeployment in a timely manner. \n \n109.  The  Government  will  take  timely  steps  in  resolving  issues  relating  to  the  transfer  of \noperations  from  CEB  to  the  new  companies,  including  the  allocation  and  transfer  of  CEB\u2019s \nassets and liabilities. \n \n110.  The  Government  will  support  a  consumer  consultative  committee  as  stipulated  in  the \nproposed  electricity  act  through  the  regulatory  commission  to:  (i)  advise  the  commission  on \nappropriate  consumer  standards;  (ii)  monitor  electricity  consumer  satisfaction;  (iii)  promote \nawareness of consumer rights and standards; and (iv) receive and, where it has the power to do \nso, deal with complaints and concerns of electricity consumers. \n \n\n4. \n\nSuccessor Entities \n\n111.  Before  any  successor  entity  or  entities  become  an  implementing  agency,  the  new \ncompanies will enter into an agreement with ADB with respect to their rights and obligations. It \nhas been agreed between the Government and ADB that subsequent project agreements with \nany successor or assignee of CEB shall include detailed financial covenants currently not in the \nProject  Agreement  with  CEB,  such  as,  but  not  limited  to,  debt/equity  ratio,  current  ratio,  self \nfinancing  ratio,  collection  ratio,  and  kilowatt  hour  (kWh)  bought  versus  kWh  billed  versus  kWh \ncollected. \n \n\n5. \n\nEnvironment and Social Dimensions \n\n112.  CEB  ensures  (i)  that  all  project  components  that  require  IEE  according  to  the \nGovernment  and  ADB's  environmental  impact  assessment  requirements  will  have  completed \nthe  IEE  reports  and  obtained  the  necessary  environmental  clearance  from  the  relevant \nauthorities  before  any  construction  works  start;  (ii)  all  environmental  mitigation  measures  set \nforth in the IEE and environmental clearance will be implemented; and (iii) all transformers and \ncapacitors  purchased  under  the  Project  will  be  free  of  poly-chlorinated  biphenyls  (PCBs)  and \nthis requirement will be included in the bidding documents.  \n\n \n\n113.  CEB will submit to ADB annual reports on the monitoring results, permits, licenses, and \nclearances  obtained  for  the  Project.  In  case  of  any  violation  of  laws  and  standards,  the  report \nwill also include certification from the relevant authority that such violation has been remedied or \nan acceptable plan for its correction has been approved. \n \n114.  CEB  or  its  successor  companies  will  conduct  poverty  monitoring  and  two  sets  of \nconsumer  surveys  during  the  project  period  to  analyze  the  socioeconomic  impacts  of \nelectrification under the RE component, with special attention to households below the poverty \nline; and will submit to ADB an annual report on the monitoring results. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 25\n\n6. \n\nImplementation and Benefit Monitoring \n\n115.  CEB will set up the program implementation and benefit monitoring unit (BMU) within 3 \nmonths of loan effectiveness. The responsibilities of BMU will include monitoring the impact of \nthe reforms under the Program on the end consumers, particularly those below the poverty line. \nUsing  consulting  services,  BMU  will  undertake  an  in-depth  qualitative  and  quantitative \nassessment of the impacts of the Program on the end consumers.  \n \n116.  The program impact will be assessed particularly from the power consumption patterns \nof the rural poor due to electrification.  Independent research agencies will be appointed at the \nstart of the Program to monitor the agreed-upon performance indicators. \n \n117.

Box 789 \n0980 Manila \nPhilippines \n \nDear Mr. Chino, \n \nThe Government of Sri Lanka has approached the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \n \nfinancial  assistance  of  $130  million  to  support  implementation  of  the  Sri  Lanka  Power  Sector \nDevelopment  Program.  Together  with  ADB,  we  have  carried  out  a  review  of  the  power  sector \nand  has  finalized  the  strategies  for  the  short  and  medium  term  for  restructuring  of  the  sector \nbased  on  (i)  the  amended  Power  Sector  Policy  of  1998;  and  (ii)  the  preparatory  studies \nconducted under technical assistance projects funded by ADB and the World Bank. The power \nsector has deteriorated in the past several years to such an extent that its critical physical and \nfinancial  situation  is  becoming  a  severe  constraint  to  economic  growth  and  has  affected  the \nwelfare  of  the  people  in  general.  With  this  background,  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  has \nresolved to undertake power sector reforms and make adequate and efficient power available to \nall sectors of the economy and society. \n \nA. \n \n1. \n \n\nThe objectives of the power sector reforms are: \n\nObjectives of Power Sector Reforms \n\n(a)  To achieve commercial efficiency and financial viability so that the sector does not \nabsorb  Sri  Lanka's  financial  resources  that  are  needed  for  socio-economic \ndevelopment; \n\n \n(b)  To improve delivery of services and achieve cost effectiveness through technical, \n\nmanagerial and administrative restructuring of the utilities; \n\n \n(c)  To  increase  the  operating  efficiency  of  all  power  sector  utilities  through  greater \n\ncompetition, managerial autonomy and higher accountability; \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\n \n(d)  To  create  an  environment  which  will  attract  private  capital,  both  domestic  and \n\nforeign, to supplement public sector investment; \n\n \n(e)  To achieve conservation of energy through integrated resources planning, efficient \nutilization,  demand  side  management  and  minimizing  waste,  and  to  promote \nenvironmentally sound and sustainable development; \n\n \n(f) \n\nTo publish the right and obligations of consumers in the power sector. \n\nApproach to the Reforms \n\n \nB. \n \nThe  legislative  basis  for  restructuring  and  regulating  the  State's  power  sector  are  the \n2. \nproposed Electricity Reform Bill, 2002 and the proposed Public Utilities Commissions Bill, 2002. \n \n3. \n \n\nThe key provisions of the Electricity Reform Bill are: \n\n(i)  Independent tariff setting and regulation; \n(ii)  Compulsory metering of all consumers, unless otherwise agreed between the \n\nconsumer and the electricity supplier; \n\n(iii)  Functional segregation of the sector into generation, transmission and distribution; \n(iv)  Reorganization of the Ceylon Electricity Board into several successor companies, \n\nto enable competition; and \n\n(v)  Commercialization of all activities in the sector, including promotion of private \n\nsector participation wherever feasible and desirable. \n\nUnder  the  Public  Utilities  Commissions  Act  the  Public  Utilities  Commission,  a  new \n\n \n4. \nstatutory, independent regulatory authority will be established which will be responsible for: \n \n\n(a)  approving the tariffs set by the licensees on a reflective tariff methodology specified \n\nby the Commission; \n\n \n(b)  determining the corresponding performance norms; \n \n(c) \n \n(d)  creating  and  maintaining  a  non-discriminatory  and  commercial  business \n\ncollecting, verifying and disseminating sector statistics; \n\nenvironment in this sector; \n\n \n(e)  adjudicating disputes between sector entities; and \n \n(f) \n\nissuing licenses. \n\n \n5. \nGOSL  established  the  Steering  Committee  for  Power  Sector  Reform  (Steering \nCommittee) to oversee and approve matters related to the power sector restructuring. To assist \nthe  Steering  Committee,  the  Power  Sector  Reform  Office  was  established  and  staffed  with \npersonnel from CEB, LECO and other institutions as required. In order to address the objectives \nmentioned  above,  GOSL  requested  technical  assistance  from  ADB  and  WB.  A  delineation  of \ntasks  was  agreed  to  by  the  three  parties,  and  ADB  approved  in  December  1998  a  TA  for  the \noperational  and  managerial  aspects  of  a  restructured  power  sector  while  the  WB  funded  the \nlegal and regulatory aspects. The consultants commenced work in the field in early May 2000. \n\n\f \n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n29 \n\nPrivate Sector Participation \n\nAs  a  result  of  the  work  presented  by  the  consultants  to  then  Steering  Committee,  a  sector \nstructure was approved by the Steering Committee in February 2001. This comprised two hydro \ngeneration companies (GENCOs), one thermal GENCO, a transmission company (TRANSCO) \nthat  would  be  responsible  for  both  the  transmission  function  inclusive  of  dispatch  and  to \nestablish four distribution companies according to the financial viability of the distribution areas. \nOn  a  request  made  by  the  Trade  Unions,  ESC  agreed  to  a  slight  change  in  the  structure  by \nallowing the three generating companies to function as three independent profit centres under a \nsingle company. However, this will be reviewed after a definitive period. The new companies will \nbe incorporated under the Companies' Act by October 2003 and on the outset be fully owned by \nGOSL. \n \n6. \nThe  Steering  Committee  was  merged  into  the  tasks  assigned  to  the  recently  enacted \nEnergy  Supply  Committee  (ESC).  The  ESC  has  confirmed  the  decisions  approved  by  the \nSteering  Committee,  and  is  now  responsible  for  the  decision  making  process  of  the  power \nsector restructuring process. \n \nC. \n \n7. \nPrivate  sector  is  expected  to  play  a  key  role  in  power  sector  development  activities. \nDevelopers  will  be  invited  to  build  power  generation  plants  that  are  elements  of  the  approved \nplan. The selection will be through a transparent competitive bidding process. In support of this, \nthe  Government's  approach  will  be  to  foster  a  business  environment  that  will  provide  a  level \nplaying field both for the private and public sectors and also by separating sector regulation from \noperations.  It \nis  recognized,  however,  that  to  provide  incentives  for  better  technical \nperformance,  there  has  to  be  competition  and  an  appropriate  enabling  commercial  business \nenvironment. As already mentioned earlier, the Government proposes to establish the Sri Lanka \nPublic  Utilities  Commission,  a  multisector  regulatory  commission  to  make  tariff  setting  and \nregulation,  transparent  and  apolitical.  The  private  sector  involvement  can  already  be  seen \nthrough the establishment of various medium-size power stations by the private sector, the AES \nKelanatissa independent power station, the development of the Kerewalipitiya power station and \nthe  GOSL's  decision  to  increase  the  limit  on  private  sector  participation  for  development  of \nhydro generation from 10MW to 50MW. \n \nD. \n \n8. \nThe  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  recognizes  the  fact  that  there  has  to  be  a  tariff \nrationalization  if  private  and  foreign  investments  are  to  be  forthcoming  in  the  power  sector. \nUtilities  should  operate  on  commercial  principles  and  earn  adequate  rates  of  return  on  capital \ninvestments. On the other hand, grant of unrestrained freedom to fix the tariff by power utilities \nwill  lead  to  consumer  interest  being  adversely  affected.  Looking  to  this  we  have  set  up  an \nindependent regulatory commission. While the Government of Sri Lanka recognizes, on the one \nhand,  the  need  for  the  continuance  of  subsidized  tariff  for  socially  obligatory  activities  like \ndrinking water and street lighting and lighting for urban and rural poor, on the other hand, it also \nrecognizes that these subsidies will have to be explicit, quantified, reasonable and targeted and \npaid  for  by  the  Government  as  part  of  its  social  obligations.  The  Government  also  recognizes \nthat,  while  cross-subsidization  cannot  be  fully  eliminated,  it  has  to  be  kept  within  reasonable \nlimits. To assure the ADB of our commitment to these principles the Government has agreed to \npay  the  Ceylon  Electricity  Board  for  the  electricity  supplied  by  it  for  street  lighting,  until  and \nincluding 31 August 2002, and will provide, through the Government's budget, additional funds \nto pay for such social activities on a recurring basis every year. In addition, action will be taken \nto settle all dues to the Ceylon Electricity Board from all the private sector institutions. \n\nTariffs \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\nConclusions \n\nConsultations \n\n \nE. \n \n9. \nThe  Government  believes  that  power  sector  reform  requires  concerted  interventions  at \ndifferent  levels  of  the  sector  to  make  the  reforms  a  success.  A  phased  approach  taking  into \naccount  the  ground  realities,  and  the  available  financial  and  managerial  resources  of  the \nGovernment  and  the  sector  has  been  drafted.  The  Government,  through  the  Electricity  Sector \nCommittee,  the  Ceylon  Electricity  Board  and  through  political  processes,  held  public \nconsultations  about  domestic  and  international  experiences  with  power  sector  reform  and  the \nmerits  of  different  sector  structures  before  it  commenced  the  reforms  process.  Stakeholders' \nviews have been appropriately incorporated. This makes the Sri Lankan electricity sector reform \nprogram one of the most transparent in Asia. \n \nF. \n \n10. \nOnly a reliable and efficient electricity infrastructure will pave the way for the continued \nexpansion of the state's economy and the welfare of its people. The Government of Sri Lanka \nonce  again  reaffirms  its  commitment  to  restructure  the  power  sector  along  commercial  lines. \nGiven its vast experience in the reform process in the power sectors of its developing member \ncountries, ADB can play a major role in assisting the Government in restructuring the sector. On \nbehalf  of  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka,  I  wish  to  convey  our  unequivocal  commitment  to  the \nPower  Sector  Development  Program  and  urge  that  you  recommend  ADB  assistance  for  its \nimplementation. \n \n11. \nenclosed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nA  Policy  Matrix  outlining  the  proposed  actions  by  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  is \n\nK N Choksy \nHon.

The specific focus \nof each program is as follows; \n \nJBIC:  Project financing of generation stations, \ntransmission and distribution networks.  Some \ntechnical institutional building support.  \n \nWorld Bank:  Assistance provided to the power \nsector reform process, particularly in developing the \nregulatory framework for the unbundled power sector.  \nFurther  financial assistance to the Government  will \nbe provided once  the restructuring process has been \nimplemented.   Focused its assistance on renewable \npower supply for off-grid hydro stations and solar \npower. \n \nSida:  Funding a RE project, and participating in the \nrestructuring through a cofinancing with ADB of the \nPower Sector Restructuring \u2013 Phase II TA. \n \nKuwait Fund:  Funding a RE project. \n \nUSAID:  Sri Lanka is one of the countries participating \nin the South Asia Infrastructure Restructuring (SARI) \nprogram.  The SARI program has done several \nstudies related to the power sector in Sri Lanka \nfocusing on future needs and options available to the \nGovernment.  Grant funds with no project financing in \nthe program.   \n \nGermany: Assistance to the development and \nimplementation of grid substations. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADTA = advisory technical assistance, JBIC = Japan Bank for International Cooperation, PPTA = project preparatory technical \nassistance, Sida = Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, RE = rural electrification, UK = United Kingdom. \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n39 \n\n \n \n \nSRI LANKA POWER SECTOR \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE, 1987-2002 \n($ million) \n \nLoan \n\nGrant \n\nTotal \n\nSource \n \nMULTILATERAL \n \n  World Bank \n\nADB \n\n \n\nSubtotal \n\nPeople's Republic of China \n\n \n \nBILATERAL \n \n  Germany \nJapan \n \n \nKuwait \n  Netherlands \n  Nordic Development Fund \n  Norway \n  Republic of Korea \n \n  United Nations Development  \n \n  United Kingdom \n \n \n \n\n    Programme (UNDP) \n\nSubtotal \n\nSweden \n\nTOTAL \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n 213 \n122 \n\n335 \n\n285 \n1,106 \n1 \n \n4 \n\n \n\n1,401 \n\n1,736 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2  \n3 \n\n5 \n\n4 \n \n \n \n1 \n \n9 \n5 \n22 \n\n2 \n45 \n83 \n\n88 \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 215 \n125 \n\n340 \n\n4 \n285 \n1,106 \n1 \n1 \n4 \n9 \n5 \n22 \n\n2 \n45 \n1,484 \n\n1,824 \n\n \n\nSources:  UNDP  Development  Cooperation:  Sri  Lanka  1993  Report,  March  1995  and  ADB  Document  No.  95/09, \n\nLoan, Technical Assistance and Private Sector Operations Approvals, September 1995. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK LOANS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \nTO THE ENERGY SECTOR IN SRI LANKA \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n8.00 \n17.50 \n11.30 \n3.45 \n3.80 \n12.40 \n34.80 \n74.30 \n80.00 \n24.00 \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n  46,000 \n  190,000 \n  80,000 \n  150,000 \n  250,000 \n  50,000 \n  230,000 \n  445,000 \n  690,000 \n\n40 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nLoans \n\n \nA.  \n \n \nLoan No. \n118-SRI(SF) \n299-SRI(SF) \n436-SRI(SF) \n654-SRI(SF) \n634-SRI(SF) \n732-SRI(SF) \n870-SRI(SF) \n1021-SRI(SF) \n1414-SRI(SF) \n1438-SRI(SF) \n \nB. \n \n \nTA No. \n118-SRI  \n219-SRI \n523-SRI \n551-SRI \n578-SRI \n660-SRI \n930-SRI \n1307-SRI \n1308-SRI \n\n1309-SRI \n1309-SRI \n\n2795-SRI \n3141-SRI \n3450-SRI \n\n3655-SRI \n3857-SRI \n \n\nDate of \nApproval \n\n \nProject \n\n 19 Dec 1972  Bowatena Hydroelectric Project1 \nCanyon Hydropower Project1 \n 26 Jul 1977 \n 10 Dec 1979  Rural Electrification Project1 \n 17 Nov 1983  Trincomalee Thermal Power Project \n 16 Aug 1983  Special Assistance2 \n 13 Feb 1985  Secondary Towns Power Distribution3 \n 3 Dec 1987 \n 31 May 1990  Power System Expansion (Sector Loan) 1 \n 14 Dec 1995  Second Power System Expansion Sector \n 16 May 1996  Emergency Rehabilitation of Petroleum Facilities \n\nSecondary Towns Power Distribution Project II1 / 2 \n\nDate of \nApproval \n\n \nProject \n\nRural Electrification \n\nTrincomalee Thermal Power \n\n 11 Apr 1973  Preparation of Samanala Wewa Power \n 9 Dec 1977 \n 16 Jun 1983  Energy Planning Support  \n 17 Jun 1983 \n 29 Dec 1983  Secondary District Towns Proper \n 26 Dec 1984  Energy Planning Support (Phase II) \nInstitutional Strategy Study of LECO \n 3 Dec 1987 \n 31 May 1990  Rural Electrification Development \n 31 May 1990  Preparation of CEB\u2019s New Thermal Power \n\n  700,000 \n  125,000 \n\n 31 May 1990 \n 28 Jun 1991 \n\nStation \nInstitutional Review and Development of CEB \nInstitutional  Review  and  Development  of  CEB \n(Supplementary) \n\n  100,000 \n1,000,000 \n  325,000 \n\n 19 May 1997  Energy Sector Strategy Study \n 23 Dec 1998   Power Sector Restructuring \n 01 Jun 2000  Promotion  of  Private  Sector  Involvement  in  Oil \n\n  150,000 \n  800,000 \n\n 24 May 2001  Study of Pricing in the Petroleum Subsector \n 15 April 2002  Power Sector Restructuring \u2013 Phase II \n\nand Gas Exploration \n\n                                                 \n1   Executing Agency was Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) \n2   The  Special  Assistance  Loan  totaling  $14.7  million  was  given  to  selected  Bank-financed  Projects  for  local  cost \nfinancing.

identified  through  detailed  discussion \nwith  the  Ceylon  Electricity  Board  (CEB).  The  objectives  are  to  (i)  continue  the \nGovernment\u2019s  rural  electrification  (RE)  program  through  CEB,  (ii)  continue  expanding \nand  reinforcing  CEB\u2019s  distribution  systems,  and  (iii)  provide  financing  for  urgent \ntransmission system developments required by CEB. The proposed project component \nconsists  of  three  groups  of  subprojects:  A:  RE,  B:  33  kilovolt  distribution,  and  C: \ntransmission. \n \n2. \nPart A will consist of many RE subprojects that will provide or expand electricity \nsupply in about 820 villages in the rural areas that are under CEB\u2019s responsibility. It will \ninclude about: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n1,360 kilometers (km) of 33 kV overhead lines; \n3,150 km of 400 volt (V) overhead lines; \n600  distribution  transformers  with  a  total  capacity  of  100/160  kilovolt \nampere (kVA); \nservice connections and meters for about 112,500 new consumers; and \nother related RE equipment. \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n \n3. \nThe  number  of  RE  schemes  would  be  around  600  throughout  Sri  Lanka.  The \nproposed  RE  will  supply  electricity  to  about  112,500  additional  households  and  other \nconsumers, an increase of about 4% in total connections in the country. \n \n4. \nPart  B  will  consist  of  33  kV  distribution  lines  to  strengthen  CEB\u2019s  existing \ndistribution  networks,  which  are  becoming  overloaded  in  many  areas,  and  to  reduce \nlosses on those lines. It will include about \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n400  km  of  33  kV  development  lines  to  expand  the  rural  network  for  the \nexisting RE; \n33 kV express lines comprising 75 km of 33 kV tower lines and 69 km of \n33 kV pole lines to improve reliability, strengthen the existing system, and \nreduce losses: \nother related distribution equipment. \n\n \nPart  C  will  provide  for  the  construction  of  three  new  transmission  substations, \n5. \ntransformers, transmission lines, and a line protection system for the CEB system, which \nare urgently needed to meet the load growth of the power system. Part C will entail: \n \n\nconstruction  of  three  new  132/33  kV  grid  substations  at  Ambalangoda, \nAniyakanda, and Pannala plus associated 132 kV transmission lines; \nadditional transformer capacity totaling about 30 MVA at Deniya; and \nreplacement  of  two  132  kV  circuit  breakers  and  associated  control  and \nprotection systems. \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nRESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \nFOR RURAL ELECTRIFICATION AND TRANSMISSION COMPONENTS \n\nPurpose \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nThe  framework  aims  to  establish  the  screening,  planning,  and  management \nprocedures  for  involuntary  resettlement  that  apply  to  noncore  subprojects,  so  that  the \nprocedures  will  conform  to  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement.  The  framework \napplies  to  these  activities,  as  they  are  prepared  after  Board  approval  and  during  loan \nimplementation.  The  subprojects  selected  for  financing  include  transmission  and  rural \nelectrification (RE) schemes. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nduring project implementation are as follows: \n \n\nThe  procedures  for  preparing  a  resettlement  plan  (RP)  for  noncore  subprojects \n\nProcedures \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe  subprojects  with  possible  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  are \nscreened  to  ensure  consistency  with  the  ADB  policy  on  involuntary \nresettlement; \nResettlement effects are identified, avoided or minimized; \nThe  need  for  a  full  or  short  RP  is  determined  in  accordance  with  the \ncriteria set in ADB's Handbook for Resettlement;1 \nThe Executing Agency (EA) prepares each subproject's RP, if required, to \nbe  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval  and  to  be  implemented  before  civil \nworks contracts are awarded; and \nPrior to implementation CEB, will disclose the RP translated into the local \nlanguage,  in  the  divisional  secretariat  and  grama  niladhari  (village \nheadperson) office. \n\nScope of Land Acquisition \n\n \nC. \n \nRE  will  involve  only  category  B  projects.  The  activities  will  comprise  cutting  of \n3. \ntrees  and  clearing  of  leaves  for  the  medium-voltage  lines  (MV).  Approximately  600 \nsubprojects  in  eight  provinces  are  included  in  the  RE  component.  No  compensation  is \nrequired for removing leaves to clear the way, as the households are direct beneficiaries. \nWhere  vegetation  is  heavy,  conductors  will  be  bundled  to  avoid  cutting  valuable  trees. \nCompensation will be paid for cutting trees for the transmission lines. Based on their age \nand  species,  trees  are  valued  at  market  price  by  specialized  agencies  such  as  the \nCoconut Development Board, Rubber Research Institute, and the divisional secretariats. \nThe  affected  households  are  not  direct  beneficiaries.  Distribution  substations  are \nmounted  on  poles  on  the  roadside.  No  right-of-way  (ROW)  acquisition  is  required. \nProperty values typically increase due to the presence of transmission lines and access \nto electricity.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1  A full resettlement plan should be prepared if the project has significant impacts on the affected people. \nResettlement  will  be  \u201csignificant\u201d  where  200  or  more  people  experience  major  impacts.  \u201cMajor\u201d  impacts \nare  physical  displacement  from  housing  and/or  loss  of  more  than  10%  of  the  household\u2019s  productive \n(income generating) assets.  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n51 \n\nSome  transmission  projects  entail  insignificant  resettlement.  The  RP  will  be \n4. \nprepared  in  accordance  with  the  national  involuntary  resettlement  policy  and  ADBs \nHandbook on Resettlement. Replacement value will be paid for trees cut. \n \nD. \n\nPolicy Framework \n\n \n\n \n\n5. \nAccording  to  the  Electricity  Act  of  Sri  Lanka,  sections  15  to  19,  any  distribution \nauthority  is  required  to  inform  the  landowner  fully  and  obtain  consent  for  drawing  the \nline. The Executing Agency (EA) serves notice before entering the land. The EA marks \nthe trees and the owners are responsible for clearing them. Once clearance is certified \nby the owner and the EA, the chief engineer authorizes payment. The felled timber is the \nproperty of the landowner and its value is not deducted from the compensation. Absence \nof a legal title will not bar the landowner from receiving compensation. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements and Public Consultation \n\nCEB  has  prepared  a  long  list  of  subprojects  for  financing  for  which  designs  are \n6. \nadvanced  enough  to  ascertain  the  land  acquisition  requirements.  CEB  will  finalize  the \nsub-project  list  using  the  checklist  on  involuntary  resettlement  completed  for  each \nsubproject. The core subproject RP and future subproject RPs will be based on census \nand inventory of losses. \n \n7. \nThe RPs will be prepared by CEBs transmission division, CEB local offices and \nthe  environment  unit.  CEB  staff  will  prepare  the  RPs  in  consultation  with  the  affected \npersons  and  local  government  representatives.  Grievance  redress  procedures  will  be \nprepared  in  consultation  with  the  affected  persons,  RPs  will  be  disclosed  in  draft  and \nfinal form through the local grama niladhari offices.  \n \nDisputes  are  handled  by  the  divisional  secretary  who  reviews  cases  with  the \n8. \nassistance  of  the  grama  niladhari.

The  initial  capital  investments \nunder the RE component include all components funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nand Government/Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) under part A of the Project ($53.4 million) and \na  portion  of  part  B.  The  development  lines  to  be  erected  under  part  B  are  to  permit  later \nconstruction  of  low  voltage  distribution  lines  and  connection  of  customers  under  RE  schemes \nyet  to  be  identified.  There  will  be  no  corresponding  revenue  until  the  low-voltage  lines  are  in \nuse; however, the financial and economic results on completion of the future schemes are likely \nto  be  in  line  with  results  under  the  present  Project.  The  express  lines,  which  make  up  about \n65% of the cost under part B, will support the existing RE distribution system and those to be \ncompleted  under  part  A.  For  the  purposes  of  the  economic  and  financial  analyses,  the  entire \ncost of the express lines was included ($9.4 million) for a total of $62.8 million of initial capital \ninvestments. \n \nB.  \n \n \n \n2. \nDuring  project  implementation,  20%  of  the  RE  schemes  will  be  completed  in  both  the \nfirst  and  fourth  years,  and  30%  in  both  the  second  and  third  years.  Customers  are  added \nuniformly over the course of the year, except in the first year when a six-month delay is included \nto  allow  for  project  start-up  and  to  enhance  the  distribution  system  before  customer \nconnections.  Connection  rates  are  calculated  separately  for  four  consumer  categories\u2014small \nhouseholds, medium-size households, large households, and nonresidential buildings\u2014with the \nfinancial  model\u2019s  distribution  in  the  representative  scheme  based  on  a  nonrandom  sample  of \nCEB  RE  schemes  (Table  A13.1).  The  model  allows  for  faster  growth  in  connection  rates  than \nthe CEB survey data implies, assuming that the new companies can achieve higher connection \nrates and that the Project will better target poor households. The number of potential customers \nin a service area increases by 1.25% annually,1 but distribution across consumer types does not \nchange. \n \nAverage  monthly  usage  per  customer  by  consumer  type  in  the  first  year  assumes \n3. \nresidential  customers\u2019  usage \ntariff  categories  and \nnonresidential  customers  use  100  kilowatt  hours  (kWh)  per  month.  This  gives  an  average \nmonthly  demand  per  customer  of  49  kWh,  which  is  about  80%  of  actual  monthly  usage \nislandwide for residential consumers in 2001, to account for lower usage levels in rural areas. \nElectricity demand per customer grows at 2.5% per year.2 The evaluation includes the 4 years \n\nis  uniformly  distributed  within \n\nCustomers and Sales \n\nthe \n\n1. \n\n                                                 \n1   Population grew by 1.17% per annum on average between the 1981 and 2001 censuses. The higher growth rate \n\nfor potential customers accounts for business development and declining household size. \n\n2   Growth in demand per customer is calculated as 80% of the difference in the average annual growth in the gross \ndomestic product during 1981-2001 (4.4%) and the growth in potential customers. The 80% adjustment factor is to \naccount for the higher proportion of low-usage consumers in rural areas than nationwide. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n57 \n\nof  project  implementation  and  20  years  thereafter.  By  the  end  of  the  evaluation  period,  more \nthan 230,000 customers will have been connected out of nearly 380,000 potential customers in \nthe  service  area  (a  connection  rate  of  72%)  and  they  will  consume  nearly  245  gigawatt  hours \n(GWh) of power per year. \n \n\nTable A13.1: Customers and Tariff Rates \n\nItem \n\n30.00 \n4.00 \n45.5 \n\n30.00 \n10.90 \n100.0 \n\nFirst Year Connection Rate \nShare of Actual Customers in First Year \n\nTariff Category \nFixed Charge (SLRs) \nPer Unit Charge (SLRs/kWh) \n\nNon- \nResidential\n \n3 \n \n26 \n3 \n \n \n\nMedium \nHouseholds\n \n40 \n \n33 \n47 \n \n \n\nSmall \nHouseholds\n \n42 \n \n15 \n22 \n \n \n0-30 kWh \n30.00 \n3.00 \n15.0 \n\nShare of Potential Customers in Service Area \nShare of Actual Customers \n \n \n\nLarge \nHouseholds \n \n15 \n \n53 \n28 \n \n \n31-60 kWh  61-90 kWh  General \n30.00 \n4.40 \n75.5 \n\nDistribution of Customers (%) \n \n \n \n \n \nTariff Schedule \n \n \n \n  Monthly Usage in First Year (kWh/month) \nKWh = kilowatt hour. \n \n \n4. \nThe tariff rates are from CEB\u2019s tariff schedule at the time of appraisal. For nonresidential \nconsumers,  the  general  purpose  contract  rate  for  less  than  10  kilovolt  ampere  (kVA)  is  used. \nThe  weighted  average  yield  per  unit  of  electricity  sold,  based  on  the  distribution  of  customers \nand including the fixed charge, is SLRs5.73 per kWh. While no tariff adjustments are included in \nthe  analysis,  the  per  unit  charge  is  allowed  to  increase  by  0.05%  annually  as  rising  average \npower  consumption  moves  some  customers  into  the  higher  tariff  brackets.  However,  the \nweighted  average  yield  per  unit  sold  actually  falls  to  SLRs5.42  by  the  end  of  the  evaluation \nperiod,  as  the  connection  rate  for  low-tariff  customers  rises  faster  than  that  for  high-tariff \ncustomers. \n \n \n \n5. \nThe initial capital investments during project implementation follow the same pattern as \nassumed for the completion of RE schemes. In addition, customers are connected at a cost of \nSLRs5,500  per  connection,  which  is  borne  by  the  consumer.  The  principal  operations  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  cost  is  staff.  Recurring  O&M  costs  are  based  on  additional  employees \nbeing  requried  at  a  rate  of  one  per  300  customers,  at  a  gross  cost  of  SLRs0.25  million  per \nemployee  per  year.  An  allowance  of  SLRs0.25  million  per  employee  per  year  is  added  to  this \ncost to account for overhead, spare parts, and other nonlabor expenses. \n \n6. \nThe  cost  of  a  unit  of  energy  supplied  to  the  grid  is  affected  by  the  generation  fuel  mix \n(especially the availability of hydropower), the international price of oil, and the exchange rate. \nUnder  normal  hydrological  conditions,  an  oil  price  of  $25  per  barrel,  and  an  exchange  rate  of \nSLRs96  to  the  dollar,  the  average  variable  cost  of  energy  into  the  grid  is  SLRs2.02  per  kWh. \nAllowing for transmission losses of 5%, the cost of a unit of energy available for distribution is \nSLRs2.12. A key cost of supplying power to the new RE schemes is the high rate of technical \nand  nontechnical  losses.  Distribution  losses  in  CEB  are  currently  about  15%  on  average.  The \nmodel  allows  for  reductions  in  technical  losses  due  to  enhancements  on  the  Project\u2019s \ndistribution system and lower nontechnical losses as the percentage of unmetered connections \n\nCapital Investments and Cost of Supply \n\n2. \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Evaluation \n\ndeclines. Hence, the distribution losses are assumed to be 15% in the first year, falling to 10.8% \nby the fourth year. \n \n \n \n \n7. \nFrom  CEB\u2019s  perspective,  the  RE  component  is  unprofitable.  The  net  present  value \n(NPV)  of  the  financial  flows  evaluated  at  the  real  weighted  average  cost  of  capital3  of  6%  is \nnegative, as is the financial internal rate of return (Table A13.2). Annual cash flows themselves \nare  negative  until  the  15th  year  after  project  completion.  The  cost  of  supply,  both  bulk  power \npurchases and distribution losses, is the largest recurrent cost component, accounting for 35% \nof  total  costs  in  present  value  terms,  while  O&M  is  22%.  The  capital  cost  per  customer  of \nSLRs27,600 is high due to the low density of customers in RE schemes. \n \n8. \nThe current tariff structure and the high proportion of low-usage customers in rural areas \nlead to the negative NPV, although the present value of sales revenue is sufficient to cover the \npresent value of the capital investments, but not the recurrent costs. In fact, tariff rates will need \nto be nearly doubled, both the per unit charge and the fixed cost, to make the NPV of the RE \ncomponent  positive.  At  current  tariffs,  the  benefit-cost  ratio  is  about  56%,  implying  that  about \nhalf  of  the  costs  will  be  recovered  by  the  inflows  generated.  In  the  end,  some  form  of  capital \nsubsidy will be necessary to make RE expansion attractive to a distribution company operating \non  commercial  terms,  given  the  Government\u2019s  policy  to  maintain  the  lifeline  tariff  rate  for  low \nlevels of consumption and uniform tariffs between urban and rural users. \n \nC.  \n \n \n \nFor  the  economic  analysis,  the  assumptions  regarding  the  number  and  distribution  of \n9. \ncustomers,  yield  per  unit  sold,  and  financial  costs  are  the  same  as  those  in  the  financial \nanalysis.  The  benefit  calculations  follow  the  methodology  in  CEB\u2019s  RE  substation  scheme \nevaluation  model.4  The  primary  use  of  electricity  in  rural  households  and  commercial \nestablishments is for lighting; in addition, industrial users employ electric motors. The economic \nbenefits  derive  from  two  sources:  (i)  the  savings  from  replacing  alternative  sources  of  lighting \nand  power  with  electricity  (capital  and  operating  costs),  and  (ii)  the  incremental  benefits  from \nincreased  energy  consumption.  Savings  for  residential  consumers  are  based  on  the  kWh \nequivalent cost of kerosene. Benefits for nonresidential consumers include the cost differential \nfrom  replacing  diesel  engines  with  electric  motors,  in  addition  to  savings  on  kerosene  for \nlighting.5 \n\nEconomic Benefits and Costs \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n1. \n\n                                                 \n3   The  real  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  is  the  nominal  cost  of  capital  (assuming  CEB  receives  funds  from  the \n70% ADB-financed portion at 13% interest and borrows the remainder at a commercial rate of 18%) deflated by the \nprojected local inflation rate of 8%. \n\n4   The  model  was  developed  under  the  Power  System  Expansion  (Sector  Loan)  Project  (Loan  1021-SRI),  and \nmodified  as  part  of  the  preparatory  work  for  the  Second  Power  System  Expansion  (Sector  Loan)  Project  (Loan \n1414-SRI). \n\n5   The basis in calculating the economic cost of kerosene is the international price of $27.90 per barrel. To calculate \nthe cost savings based on the kWh equivalent consumption before electrification, the economic cost of kerosene, \nin SLRs per liter, is multiplied by 2.2, which is the kWh equivalent for a liter of kerosene used for lighting. For the \noperating cost differential between diesel engines and electric motors, the international diesel price of $27.50 per \nbarrel is used, but the displaced kWh equivalent is derived by assuming no additional power consumption (net of \nusage for lighting) in the first year following electrification.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\nYear\n\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\n2026\n\n2.4\n15.6\n37.1\n57.2\n71.9\n81.4\n89.9\n97.7\n105.2\n112.8\n120.6\n128.7\n136.9\n145.2\n153.6\n162.3\n171.2\n180.7\n190.5\n200.5\n210.7\n221.0\n231.6\n242.7\n\n14\n87\n196\n299\n373\n422\n467\n508\n549\n590\n632\n676\n721\n767\n813\n861\n911\n964\n1,019\n1,075\n1,133\n1,192\n1,253\n1,316\n\nTable A13.2: Financial Analysis of the Rural Electrification Component\n\nTotal\nSales\n(GWh)\n\nSales\nRevenue\n(SLRs mn)\n\nCapital \nContribution\n(SLRs mn)\n\nTotal\nInflows\n(SLRs mn)\n\nInitial Capital\nInvestments\n(SLRs mn)\n\nConnection\nCharges\n(SLRs mn)\n\nBulk \nPower\n(SLRs mn)\n\nDistribution\nLosses\n(SLRs mn)\n\nOperations and\nMaintenance\n(SLRs mn)\n\nTotal\nOutflows\n(SLRs mn)\n\nNet Cash\nFlows\n(SLRs mn)\n\n44\n204\n194\n176\n91\n72\n58\n50\n46\n43\n42\n42\n41\n40\n38\n37\n38\n39\n38\n36\n33\n32\n32\n33\n\n58\n291\n390\n476\n464\n494\n525\n558\n595\n633\n675\n718\n762\n807\n852\n899\n949\n1,003\n1,057\n1,111\n1,166\n1,224\n1,285\n1,350\n\n1,206\n1,809\n1,809\n1,206\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n6,031\n5,221\n\n44\n204\n194\n176\n91\n72\n58\n50\n46\n43\n42\n42\n41\n40\n38\n37\n38\n39\n38\n36\n33\n32\n32\n33\n\n5\n33\n79\n121\n153\n173\n191\n207\n223\n239\n256\n273\n290\n308\n326\n344\n363\n383\n404\n426\n447\n469\n492\n515\n\n219\n194\n171\n152\n153\n154\n157\n160\n163\n166\n170\n174\n178\n182\n186\n191\n195\n200\n205\n209\n215\n220\n225\n231\n\n7\n44\n105\n161\n201\n226\n246\n262\n277\n290\n303\n316\n329\n341\n353\n364\n376\n387\n399\n410\n420\n430\n440\n450\n\n1,482\n2,285\n2,358\n1,817\n598\n625\n651\n679\n709\n739\n772\n805\n839\n872\n904\n937\n972\n1,009\n1,045\n1,081\n1,115\n1,151\n1,189\n1,229\n\n-1,424\n-1,994\n-1,967\n-1,341\n-134\n-131\n-127\n-121\n-114\n-106\n-97\n-87\n-77\n-65\n-52\n-38\n-23\n-7\n11\n30\n51\n73\n96\n120\n\n-7,525\n-6,413\n\nBenefit-Cost Ratio @6.0% = 55.5%\nFIRR = -15.5%\n\nTotal\nNPV@6.0%\n\n16,838\n7,024\n\n1,502\n963\n\n18,339\n7,987\n\n1,502\n963\n\n6,722\n2,816\n\n4,472\n2,266\n\n7,138\n3,134\n\n25,865\n14,400\n\nFIRR = financial internal rate of return, GWh = gigawatt hours, NPV = net present value.\n\nCalculation of financial internal rate of return to Ceylon Electricity Board\n(2002 constant prices, exchange rate SLRs96 = $1.00)\n\nMemorandum Items:\n\n2003 Beginning year of Project implementation\n\n6.02% Real weighted average cost of capital\n\n96 Exchange rate (SLRs/$)\n\n27,588 Total capital cost per customer\n\n \n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nThe economic benefit from additional power usage is the incremental consumer surplus \n10. \nat  the  new  consumption  level.  The  implied  price  and  quantity  of  electricity  demanded  for \nhouseholds  before  electrification  are  the  quantity  of  electricity  needed  to  supply  lighting  levels \nfrom  kerosene  lamps  and  the  equivalent  cost  per  kWh.  Assuming  a  linear  demand  curve,  the \nincremental  consumer  surplus  would  equal  one-half  the  price  difference  before  and  after \nelectrification multiplied by the quantity difference. As the demand curve is unlikely to be linear, \nthe  product  of  the  price  and  quantity  differences  is  multiplied  by  a  willingness-to-pay  factor  of \n0.4 rather than one half. Since the incremental energy consumption is valued in local prices, the \nresult is converted to economic border prices by multiplying the calculated consumer surplus by \nthe standard conversion factor of 0.8. \n \n11. \nIn evaluating project costs, economic analysis uses border prices, which exclude duties \nand taxes on imported materials and equipment. The assumed input shares for the various cost \nitems are summarized in Table A13.3. Capital for inside wiring and connections is assumed to \nbe nontraded. Fuel for hydropower is produced locally while fuel for thermal power is imported. \nThe market for skilled labor is assumed to be in equilibrium, but unskilled labor is assumed to be \nin surplus in the economy. The prices of skilled labor, nontraded capital, and power from hydro \ngeneration are converted to economic border prices by multiplying by the standard conversion \nfactor. That for unskilled labor, however, is adjusted by the shadow wage rate factor of 0.7. The \nfuel  mix  for  the  power  available  for  distribution,  which  includes  bulk  power  purchase  and \ndistribution system loss, is based on a normal-rainfall year throughout the economic analysis. \n \n\nTable A13.3: Input Shares and Conversion Rates for Economic Costs \n(percent) \n \n\n \n\nLabor \n\nCapital \nTraded  Nontraded\n\nFuel \n\n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n\nThermal \n\nUnskilled\n\n0 \n \n70 \n\n4 \n10 \n10 \n10 \n\n80 \n0 \n0 \n25 \n\n0 \n70 \n70 \n25 \n\nHydro \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n\nSkilled \n16 \n20 \n20 \n40 \n\nItem \nInitial Capital Investment \nConnection Charges \nHouse Wiring \nOperation and Maintenance \nBulk Power Purchase/ \nDistribution System Loss \n \nConversion Factors \n \n \n \n12. \nAlthough  the  RE  component  is  not  financially  viable,  the  project  is  strongly  justified  on \neconomic grounds.

The  bulk  of  the \nbenefits\u2014more  than  70%\u2014comes  from  the  additional  power  consumed.  Overall,  the  RE \ncomponent  has  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  23.6%.  The  evaluation  does  not \ntake into account quality differences, such as better quality lighting from electricity, nor does it \nconsider other possible uses for electricity in households, such as television sets, rice mills, or \nrubber  presses.

Nonelectrified households residing in electrified villages benefit economically from \ndiversified sources of household income through increased off-farm employment opportunities, \nand  socially  from  increased  community  activities.  These  benefits  typically  occur  at  the  village \nlevel  and  can  be  viewed  as  positive  externalities  to  nonelectrified  households.  As  such,  the \nestimated EIRR is likely to be a conservative estimate of the benefits from the RE component to \nthe economy. \n \n13. \nThe  figures  used  for  system  losses  are  average  losses;  however,  losses  are  much \nhigher during peak hours, possibly as much as 15 percentage points higher than the average. \nSince most of the consumption under RE schemes is for lighting, the bulk of the power used in \nrural areas is during peak times. Adding 12 percentage points to the loss rates (15 percentage \npoints  additional  loss  with  80%  of  rural  power  consumption  occurring  during  peak  hours) \nsignificantly  increases  the  present  value  of  the  economic  costs,  but  the  RE  component  still \nachieves an EIRR of 20%. \n \n14. \nAs experience in the last few years has shown, CEB\u2019s financial situation is vulnerable to \nchanges  in  world  oil  prices  and  the  water  levels  in  the  hydro  generation  reservoirs.  While \nchanges in the fuel mix will have a definite negative effect on the EIRR through the increase in \nthe  average  cost  of  bulk  power  and  distribution  losses,  changes  in  world  oil  prices  affect  both \nthe costs and benefits. In the case of below average rainfall changing the generation mix to 60% \nthermal and 40% hydro, the EIRR drops only slightly to 23.3%. With a 20% increase in world oil \nprices,  implying  a  $30  per  barrel  price  for  crude  oil,  the  EIRR  actually  increases  to  26.4% \nbecause  of  the  increased  benefit  from  the  avoided  cost  of  kerosene.  Under  relatively  dry \nweather and high oil prices, the EIRR for the RE component is 25.9%. \n \nD.  \n \n15. \nThe distribution of the net project benefits is assessed on the basis of the difference in \nNPV of the financial and economic returns, using a discount rate of 12%. The NPV of the cash \nflows  arising  from  the  loan  is  included  in  the  financial  net  benefits  based  on  the  Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) lending terms of a 32-year loan period, with an 8-year grace period, \n1%  interest  rate  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  during  the  payback  period.  Benefits  are \nevaluated for each category of consumers based on their willingness to pay. Household size is \nused as a proxy for income level, with individuals in small households assumed to be under the \npoverty line and all others above. Assuming unskilled labor is composed solely of people living \nbelow the poverty line, the difference between the financial and economic costs accrues entirely \nto  the  poor.  Net  benefits  to  nonresidential  consumers  and  the  government/economy  are \nassumed  to  reach  the  poor  in  proportion  to  their  income  share  in  the  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP). For the rural poor, the figure is 10.1%. \n \nOf the SLRs6.2 billion in discounted economic benefits, 7.8% accrues to the poor (Table \n16. \nA13.5). This is lower than the poor\u2019s share of income in GDP, but this result is very sensitive to \nthe  assumptions  on  the  mapping  between  household  size  and  income  levels.  If  5%  of  small \nhouseholds are assumed to be nonpoor and 5% of medium-size households are assumed to be \npoor, then the poverty impact ratio rises to 11.6%. The result is less sensitive to the assumption \nthat  all  unskilled  workers  are  below  the  poverty  line.  Assuming  only  80%  of  unskilled  workers \nare poor causes the ratio to fall by less than half a percentage point to 7.4%. \n \n\nPoverty Impact Ratio \n\n\fTable A13.5: Distribution of Net Benefits and Poverty Impact Ratio of the Rural Electrification Component\n(SLRs million in present value at 12% discount rate)\n\nEconomic\nPresent\nValue\n\nNet Benefits\nFinancial\nPresent\nValue\n\nElectricity Customers\nLarge\nMedium\nHousehold Household Household Residential Unskilled\n\nSmall\n\nNon-\n\nLabor\n\nSkilled\n\nGovernment/\nEconomy\n\nDifference\n\nDistribution of Net Benefits\n\n \n\n \n\n4,600\n10,866\n0\n0\n\n-4,373\n-553\n-503\n-1,231\n-1,222\n-1,365\n0\n\n0\n0\n3,477\n3,100\n\n-4,574\n0\n0\n-1,399\n-1,388\n-1,625\n-807\n\n4,600\n10,866\n-3,477\n-3,100\n\n201\n-553\n-503\n168\n167\n260\n807\n\nTotal\n\n6,219\n\n487\n\nPoverty Impact Ratio\n\n7.8%\n\n2,026\n5,565\n-1,484\n0\n\n0\n-317\n-288\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n1,476\n4,032\n-1,174\n0\n\n0\n-145\n-132\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n447\n351\n-478\n0\n\n0\n-19\n-17\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n55\n21\n19\n0\n0\n49\n0\n\n651\n917\n-342\n0\n\n0\n-220\n-200\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n807\n\n0\n0\n0\n-3,100\n\n0\n98\n89\n168\n167\n81\n807\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n146\n28\n25\n0\n0\n130\n0\n\n330\n\n807\n100.0%\n807\n\n5,503\n0.0%\n0\n\n4,057\n0.0%\n0\n\n284\n10.1%\n29\n\n144\n100.0%\n144\n\n330\n0.0%\n0\n\n-4,906\n10.1%\n-493\n\nNet Benefits\n\n6,219\n\n-3,216\n\n9,435\n\n5,503\n\n4,057\n\n284\n\n144\n\n-1,690\n\nItem\n\nInflows\n\nCost Savings\nAdditional Power Consumption\nSales Revenue\nLoan\n\nOutflows\n\nInitial Capital Investment\nConnection Charges a\nInside Wiring\nBulk Power\nDistribution Losses\nOperations and Maintenance\nDebt Service\n\nPoverty Impact Ratio\n\nGains and Losses b\nProportion of the Poor (%)\nNet Benefits for the Poor\n\nNotes:\n\n \n \n \n \n\na Financial present value of connection charges is net of the capital contribution from electricity consumers.\nb Gains and Losses to the Government/Economy include the financial return of -3,216.\n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \n17.  While the poverty impact ratio shows the poor benefiting less than their share of income \nin GDP when small households are equated with those living below the poverty line, under this \nassumption poor households will make up 33% of the direct beneficiaries and account for 11.7% \nof  power  consumed  by  the  end  of  the  evaluation  period.  The  figures  rise  to  34%  of  direct \nbeneficiaries  and  13.5%  of  power  consumed  if  5%  of  small  households  are  assumed  to  be \nnonpoor  and  5%  of  medium-size  households  are  assumed  to  be  poor.  Moreover,  the  positive \nexternalities  of  electrification\u2014particularly \nincreased  nonfarm  employment  activities\u2014will \nprovide further benefits to the poor from the RE component of the project. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n65 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY \n\nYes \n\n \nYes \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nSector identified as a National Priority \nin Country Poverty Partnership \nAgreement?   \n\n \nA. \nSector identified as a National Priority in \nCountry Poverty Analysis?   \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Sri Lanka: \n \nAlthough  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  human  development  index  ranks  among  the  highest  in  Asia  poverty  has  remained \nstagnant despite high growth rates. About 90% of the population reside in rural areas and more than 40% \nof the rural population are below the poverty line. Large variations in human poverty exist between rural \nand  urban  areas  and  between  districts  (Table  A14.1).  Economic  development  seems  to  have  bypassed \nthe  poorest  districts.  Analysis  shows  that  fostering  broad-based  rural  development  by  creating  off-farm \nopportunities is key for the poor to benefit from economic growth and structural change.1 Off-farm activities \nallow  households  vulnerable  to  poverty  to  diversify  income  sources  and  hedge  against  risk  and  external \nadverse  shocks.  Access  to  electricity  is  essential  for  practically  any  off-farm  activity.  For  small-scale \nfarmers who aim to increase agricultural productivity, electricity is an essential input that allows the use of \nimproved  technology.  Many  districts  with  the  highest  incidence  of  poverty  have  less  than  30%  of  the \npopulation electrified, and large numbers experience a major source of deprivation with limited scope for \neconomic activity and human development. \n\n \nHDI\n\n \nGDI\n\nDistricta \n\n \nHPI\n(%)\n\nElectrification\nRatioc \n(%) \n\nIncidence \nof \nPovertyb \n(%) \n\nAverage \nMonthly \nIncome/Capita\n(SLRs) \n\n \nTable A14.1: Development, Poverty and Energy by District \nShare (%) of \nIncome \nReceived \nBy the 40% \npoorest \n14.9 \n16.2 \n17.6 \n20.5 \n15.5 \n17.3 \n15.2 \n17.8 \n22.9 \n16.8 \n17.2 \n16.8 \n16.0 \n17.3 \n15.9 \n18.9 \n15.2 \n\nColombo \nKaluthara \nKurunegala \nPuttalam \nAnuradhapura \nPolonnaruwa \nKandy \nMatale \nNuwara Eliya \nGalle \nMatara \nHambantota \nRatnapura \nKegalle \nBadulla \nMonaragala \nSri Lankad \na  Data is missing for Baticaloa, Trincomalee, and Ampara districts. \nb  Consumption poverty.   \nc  1994. \nd  Total incidence of poverty in rural areas is 41% and in urban areas is 25%. \nSource:  ADB, Poverty Reduction in Sri Lanka: Maximizing the Asian Development Bank's Contribution, March 2001; \n\n13  0.85 0.49\n16  0.89 0.48\n22  0.97 0.48\n19  0.59 0.36\n21  0.98 0.56\n28  0.97 0.56\n17  0.65 0.40\n21  0.73 0.46\n30  0.81 0.54\n19  0.74 0.42\n19  0.70 0.42\n23  0.74 0.47\n25  0.75 0.45\n24  0.74 0.41\n27  0.72 0.48\n29  0.69 0.41\n18  0.75 0.47\n\n2,279 \n1,461 \n1,189 \n1,304 \n1,362 \n1,203 \n1,219 \n   988 \n1,067 \n1,229 \n1,145 \n   911 \n  991 \n    1,079 \n  815 \n  849 \n1,442 \n\n19 \n39 \n53 \n51 \n50 \n40 \n42 \n51 \n40 \n39 \n44 \n43 \n52 \n41 \n48 \n66 \n39 \n\n77 \n51 \n23 \n39 \n33 \n28 \n52 \n27 \n25 \n48 \n49 \n26 \n25 \n26 \n36 \n17 \n43 \n\nUNDP; National Human Development. \n\nGDI = Gender Development Index, HDI = Human Development Index, HPI = Human Poverty Index.\n\n                                                 \n1  Rural incomes are strongly positively linked with nonfarm income shares. Preliminary findings of the World Bank's \n\nintegrated survey. \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\nPoverty Intervention \n\n \n \nThe rural electrification (RE) component under the proposed loan proposes to electrify about 113,000 \nhouseholds in 820 villages, in addition to commercial and religious establishments. Nearly 50,000 of these \nhouseholds (44%) appear to live below the poverty line. To ensure poverty targeting in the RE component, \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) are discussing amortization of \nconnection charges. Although, non electrified households residing in electrified areas do benefit indirectly \nfrom increased income-generating activities and improved health care, they are deprived of the direct \nbenefits. Cost savings, in the short term, are especially significant among these benefits. For poor \nhouseholds, electricity expenditure on lighting is reduced by over 50 % on average in addition to the \nbenefit of not suffering from bottlenecks in the availability of kerosene in the local store.     \n \n \nB. \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nPoverty and social assessment for the proposed project was conducted during the feasibility study.  The \nprimary objective of this study is to (i) assess whether the benefits of the project will flow primarily to \npoor/nonpoor consumers; (ii) design the poverty intervention component of the project; (iii) identify and \ndeal effectively with any social risks such as involuntary resettlement, gender, labor, affordability, including \nthe need to prepare any necessary mitigative measures or plan.   \n \nDespite the availability of socioeconomic data on RE, CEB needs to update and improve its database to \ncapture consumer behavior and long-term benefits.  Although surveys have been conducted under \nprevious RE loans, the need to analyze socioeconomic data related to electrification is not understood and \nhence the information that the surveys capture is not effectively used. In addition, obstacles that prevent \nconnection by poor households to connect are not appropriately addressed since the existing survey data \nused for analysis do not refer to these issues. The CEB or its successor companies will be responsible for \nmonitoring consumer behavior and the benefits from the RE component.  A socioeconomic survey with \nemphasis on the benefits to the poor, including issues related to poverty targeting in the RE schemes, will \nbe conducted at the early stage of project implementation and will be updated annually.  The survey data \nwill be used to update the current socioeconomic data underlying the economic analysis for individual \nsubprojects.  The poverty impact analysis together with the economic criterion of 12% rate of return will \ndetermine the selection of future subprojects. \n \n \nC. \n \nStakeholder analysis.  The project is designed through a participatory process.  Different categories of \nstakeholders are identified: government staff, labor unions, and categories of electricity consumers, non-\ngovernment organizations (NGOs) and aid communities. Stakeholder analysis was conducted to analyze \nwho are likely to be the major beneficiaries of the project and disadvantages from the Project. \n \nParticipation  strategy  required.    As  part  of  the  requirements  under  the  proposed  Public  Utilities \nCommission  Bill,  the  Public  Utilities  Commission  will,  where  it  considers  appropriate  to  do  so,  and \nfollowing  consultation  with  the  Minister  of  Power  and  Energy,  establish  as  a  part  of  the  Commission,  by \norder  published  in  the  Gazette,  a  consumer  consultative  committee  (C3)  for  the  following  purposes:  (i) \nadvise  the  Commission  on  appropriate  consumer  standards;  (ii)  monitoring  electricity  consumer \nsatisfaction; (iii) promote awareness of consumer rights and standards; and (iv) receive and, where it has \nthe  power  to  do  so,  deal  with  complaints  and  concerns  of  electricity  consumers.    The  Commission  will \ndevelop the form, structure, composition, and functions of the C3.                                                                    \n \n\nParticipation Process \n\n\f \n\n \nD. \n\n  \n\nPotential Issues2 \n\n \n\nSignificant/ \nNon \nSignificant/ \nUncertain/ \nNone \n\n \n\n \nResettlement4  \n \n  \n\n \nNon-\nsignificant \n\nGender  \n \n \n\nNo \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n67 \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \nPlan \nRequired3 \n\n \nResettlement \nframework \nand short \nresettlement \nplans (RPs) \nfor \nTransmission \nand RE \ncomponents \n\nNo  \n\nfor \n\nRE \n\nthe \n\nFor \n\ncomponent. \n\n \nThe  investment  project  includes  a  RE  component  and \naugmentation  of  existing  substations.  All  resettlement  in \nthe  subprojects  are  \"B\u201d,  no \nindigenous  people  are \naffected.  The resettlement does not include relocation of \nhouseholds,  and  resettlement  impacts  are  insignificant. \nCEB has prepared a resettlement plan that covers all sub-\nprojects \nthe \nsubstations/distribution  component,  a  RP  has  been \nprepared.    For  the  remaining  substations,  RPs  will  be \nprepared  to  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval  before  the \naward of civil works contracts. \n \n Although energy is biased in favor of women in terms of \nworkloads, time savings, and exposure to indoor air \npollution for the direct benefits of access to electricity \nappear to be gender neutral since it is not commonly used \nfor cooking purposes in rural areas. The gender \ndevelopment index displays little direct relation with either \naccess to electricity or monthly expenditure. But given the \nhigh proportion of female heads of households below the \npoverty line in rural areas and the relationship between \nelectrification and poverty (Table A14), the overall \neconomic and human development resulting from \nelectricity will favor women to the extent of a gender bias \nin other development factors. When electric water pumps \nbecome available, women\u2019s workload and associated \nhealth implications will be reduced. \n \n\n\fLabor \n\nNo \n\nYes \n\n68 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nAffordability  \n\n \n\nIndigenous \nPeople \n\nNo \n\nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities \n\nYes \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nAlthough  some  60%  of  the  villages  are  electrified  and \nelectricity has brought about substantial development, the \nsurvey data indicate that only 44% of potential consumers \nconnect.  Substantial  cost  savings  are  from  electricity,  but \nthe  ability  of  poor  households  to  access  electricity  is \nlimited. Findings show that the construction of the houses \n(thatched roof) may also play a role in excluding potential \nconsumers  in  some  areas.  The  main  constraint  is  the \nlarge  up-front  costs  of  connection  and  wiring  and  the \ntemporary nature of houses. About 25% of the households \ntake  a  loan  through  a  special  loan  facility  guaranteed  by \nCEB,  to  pay  for  connection  and  wiring  costs.  However, \nformal  bank  requirements  to  prove  property  rights  and \nsteady  income  in  addition  to  the  institutional  and  social \nobstacles  that  prevent  poor  households  to  access  formal \nbanks  exclude  many  of  the  poor.  Long-term  amortization \nof  connection  applications  directly  offered  by  CEB  or  its \nsuccessor  companies  will  simplify  the  process  and  lower \ntransaction costs. \n \nThe program loan will have no significant negative impact \non CEB and Lanka Electricity Company's (LECO) \nemployees.  There will not be any involuntary labor \nretrenchment due to CEB restructuring.  ADB assisted \nCEB to prepare a labor redeployment plan.  Specific \ntransfer principles are recommended in appointing \npersonnel to positions in the new companies and in \nrelation to retirement policies and the need for multiskills.  \nProcedures will be provided for communicating with and \ncounseling staff to achieve understanding of the reasons \nfor the restructuring.  Special care will be given in the \nresolving workforce differences and grievances, especially \nwhere these are related to the staff redeployment/transfer \nprocess. \n The investment component will not affect any indigenous \npeople or communities; therefore, an indigenous people \ndevelopment plan is not envisaged. \n\nThe capacity of CEB to involve employees and civil \nsociety to make them aware of the overall operation and \nrestructuring of the electricity sector and to promote \nconsumer advocacy groups is very weak.  This issue is \nbeing addressed in the draft electricity act submitted to the \nParliament. The capacity of CEB and its successor \ncompanies to address these issues needs to be \nstrengthened. \n\nYes  \n\nNone \n\nYes \n\n2 If not known, a contingency should be included in the TA budget to predict the need for a plan.  \n3 A plan will be required at design stage if any of the potential issues are found significant. \n4 Significant involuntary resettlement requires a full resettlement plan; nonsignificant, requires a short resettlement   \n  plan. \n \n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 2 September 2002) \n", "Currency Unit \n", " SLRe1.00 \n", "$1.00 \n", "\u2212 \n= \n= \n", "Sri Lanka Rupee/s (SLRe/Rs) \n$0.01 \nSLRs96.26 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAsian Development Fund \nbenefit monitoring unit \nCeylon Electricity Board \nexecuting agency \neconomic internal rate of return \nEnergy Supply Committee \ngross domestic product \ninternational competitive bidding \ninitial environmental examination \nInternational Monetary Fund \nindependent power producer \nInitial Social Assessment \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction \nKreditanstalt fur Widenaufbau \nLanka Electricity Company \nLondon Interbank Offered Rate \nMinistry of Finance \nMinistry of Power and Energy \nordinary capital resources \noperation and maintenance \n", "\u2212 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2212 \n\u2212 \n\u2212 \n\u2013 \n\u2212 \n\u2212 \n\u2212 \n\u2212 \n\u2212 \n\u2212 \n\u2212 \n\u2013 \n\u2212 \n\u2212 \n\u2212 \n\u2212 \n\u2212 \n\u2212 \n\u2212 \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n", "ADB \nADF \nBMU \nCEB  \nEA  \nEIRR \nESC \nGDP  \nICB  \nIEE  \nIMF  \nIPP  \nISA \nJBIC  \nJFPR \nKfW  \nLECO  \nLIBOR \nMOF  \nMOPE  \nOCR  \nO&M \n \n \n \n \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n", "NOTES \n \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and CEB ends on 31 December. \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "This report was prepared by a team consisting of R.
