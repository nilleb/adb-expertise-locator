Rajasthan is the largest state in India; it has 10% of \nthe country\u2019s land area, 5% of its population, and only about 1% of its surface water resources. \nAbout 17 million people (25% of Rajasthan\u2019s population) live in 193 urban centers. Rajasthan has \ndone  more  to  reduce  poverty  than  any  of  India\u2019s  other  low-income  states  particularly  between \n2005 and 2012\u2014the population below poverty line (BPL) declined from 38% in 1994, to 34% in \n2005, and further to 15% in 2012.3 Cities are places of opportunity in Rajasthan: the urban poverty \nrate averages 11% compared with 16% in rural areas.4 Rajasthan\u2019s Urban Development Policy \n(2017)  emphasizes  public  service  improvement  in  urban  areas  as  a  key  contributing  factor  to \nstrive for growth and poverty reduction. Important national and state government initiatives seek \nto  stimulate  industrial  development  and  create  jobs  for  migrants  and  local  people,  including \nnumerous industrial parks throughout the state developed by GOR. In addition, 39% of the Delhi\u2013\nMumbai Industrial Corridor is situated in Rajasthan. Tourism is also a major economic driver, with \n50  million  tourists  (including  1.8  million  foreign  tourists)  in  2018,  double  the  figure  in  2010. 5 \nHowever, the state\u2019s economic development is constrained by water availability, and GOR has \nseveral plans to increase water supply for industrial and domestic consumption. \n \n4. \nUrbanization  challenges.  Urbanization  in  India  has  outpaced  the  development  of \ninfrastructure  to  meet  basic  needs  and  the  capacity  of  institutions  to  deliver  high-quality  and \nsustainable services in cities, and large gaps remain to be filled to ensure high-quality urban WSS \nservices for all, including the poor and vulnerable. The 74th amendment to India\u2019s Constitution \n(enacted  in  1992)  devolved  service  delivery  to  local  governments,  while  multiple  national \n\n \n\n1  Secondary towns are class 2 and class 3 cities not covered under previous ADB-supported projects. Class 2 cities \nhave a population of 50,000 to 99,999 and class 3 cities have a population of 20,000 to 49,999 (Government of India. \n2011. Census of India. Delhi).  A few towns with populations below 20,000 or above 100,000 are included as they \nhave similar characteristics and the acute need to improve water supply and sanitation services. \n\n2  ADB. India.

Jaipur. \n\n\f2 \n\nprograms are in place to fund urban infrastructure and incentivize reforms.6 Notable progress has \nbeen made, including in Rajasthan, but the investment gap and institutional challenges remain \nsignificant,  efforts  to  strengthen  local  governments  are  slow,  and  urban  growth  continues. \nSubstantial resources and support are still required to empower local governments and improve \nurban governance in a manner that results in sustainable service delivery. \n \n5. \nSector  overview.  GOR  has  a  sector  development  plan  for  urban  WSS  that  includes \ninvestment and sustainability road maps, with a greater focus on secondary towns than previous \nplans. 7 GOR has prepared detailed project reports for over 50 secondary towns in line with the \nplan.  In  the  state\u2019s  secondary  towns,  which  have  not  yet  received  ADB  support,  water  supply \ncoverage  can  be  relatively  high\u2014but  water  quality  is  poor,  and  services  are  intermittent, \nunreliable,  and  inefficient.  High  transmission  and  distribution  system  losses  are  a  major \ncontributor to the poor service quality. In the project towns, households receive an average of 1.5 \nhours of water per day; there are inequities in distribution, and a high incidence of waterborne \ndiseases, while the coping costs\u2014to purchase, pump, and treat water from alternative sources\u2014 \nare also high. Most connections are unmetered. Women are primarily responsible for collecting, \ntransporting, using, and managing water, but have almost no involvement in decision-making in \nthe  sector.  Low  levels  of  fecal  sludge  collection,  treatment,  and  safe  disposal  have  led  to  an \nunsanitary  environment  with  negative  impacts  on  health  and  economic  growth.  Despite  the \nprogress in sector reforms, most urban local bodies (ULBs) have inadequate technical staff and \nown-source revenues to manage citywide WSS services, and have limited experience in (i) all \nfunctions  of  WSS  operations,  (ii)  smart  water  features  to  be  included  in  the  project,  and  (iii) \nmanagement and monitoring of operation and maintenance (O&M) contractors. \n \nAssistance  of  ADB  and  other  development  partners.  Since  2000,  the  state  has \n6. \nsuccessfully  implemented  two  multisector  urban  investment  projects  supported  by  ADB, \nbenefitting more than 7 million people in 21 class 18 and class 2 cities (footnote1), with improved \nquality  of  life,  increased  access  to  economic  opportunities,  and  considerable  benefits  for  the \npoor.9 The third project, Rajasthan Urban Sector Development Program, is ongoing and supports \ninvestments in six class 1 cities as well as sector reforms (footnote 2). With support from ADB in \nthe  form  of  physical  investments,  technical  assistance,  and  policy-based  lending,  GOR  has \ndeveloped the enabling environment to expand and increase access to and the quality of WSS \nservices throughout the state, and more efficiently use scarce water resources. Transformative \nreforms undertaken under the program include (i) establishment of the Rajasthan Urban Drinking \nWater,  Sewerage  and  Infrastructure  Corporation  Limited  (RUDSICO),  a  corporatized  entity,  to \nexpand urban investments and implement urban reform agendas; (ii) adoption of a sewage and \nwastewater policy, the first in India; (iii) establishment of a corporatized utility for WSS services in \nJaipur, the first in the state; (iv) transfer of water supply operations from the state to five municipal \nbodies with adequate support systems; (v) establishment of a state urban governance training \ninstitute  to  train  all  urban  functionaries  and  elected  representatives;  and  (vi)  preparation  of  a \nfinancial  sustainability  road  map  for  the  sector,  which  includes  a  government  order  to \nautomatically adjust the WSS tariff annually.10 The Swachh Bharat Mission (Clean India) has also \nsucceeded in ensuring that all households have a toilet. The next stage for improving sanitation \n\n \n\n6  Notable  programs  of  the  Government  of  India  include  Atal  Mission  for  Rejuvenation  and  Urban  Transformation; \n\nJawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission; Swachh Bharat Mission (Clean India); and Smart Cities. \n\n7  Local  Self  Government  Department.  2020.

The project incorporates lessons from ADB-financed projects in Rajasthan and \n7. \nacross Asia, such as (i) contract and project implementation periods should be aligned with the \nscale  and  nature  of  works,  their  geographic  spread,  and  capacity  of  project  implementing \nagencies;  (ii)  early  government  commitment  should  be  secured  to  increase  staffing  in  ULBs \nresponsible for O&M; (iii) adequate support to build operational and financial capacity of ULBs \nshould be linked with infrastructure investments; (iv) private sector engagement should ensure \nprofessional O&M systems are immediately in place while transferring skills to ULBs;11 (v) gender \nequality  and  social  inclusion  (GESI)  targets  should  be  based  on  verified  baselines;  (vi)  an \nintegrated  approach  to  sanitation  should  be  pursued  that  combines  centralized  sewerage  \nsystems  provided  in  more  densely  populated  areas  and  decentralized  on-site  fecal  sludge \nmanagement solutions in less populated areas (it is more cost-effective, wider-reaching, and less \nwater-dependent than sewerage);12 and (vii) all contracts should include household connections \nin sewered areas to ensure immediate and adequate flows to sewage treatment plants (STPs). \n \n8. \nProject modality. The project meets the sector loan modality criteria, as (i) GOR has a \nsector  development  plan;  (ii)  institutional  capacity  is  sufficient  to  implement  the  sector \ndevelopment  plan\u2014the  executing  agency  has  significant  experience \nin  planning  and \nimplementing  large-scale  projects  and  reforms,  and  further  support  will  be  provided  under  the \nproject;  and  (iii)  supporting  policies  are  in  place,  and  will  be  further  strengthened  through  the \nproject. The choice of the sector loan modality is justified because the project supports a slice of \nthe GOR\u2019s investment program and the criteria for sector loan modality are met. \n \n9. \nAlignment with ADB and country priorities. The project is aligned with pillars 2 and 3 \nof  the  country  partnership  strategy  for  India,  2018\u20132022,  and  mitigation  of  negative  climate \nchange  impacts.13   It  is  aligned  with  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs);14 and  ADB \nStrategy  2030, 15  particularly  the  operational  priorities  of  (i)  making  cities  more  livable;  (ii) \nstrengthening governance and institutional capacity; (iii) accelerating progress in gender equality; \ntackling  climate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing \n(iv) \nenvironmental sustainability; and (v) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequality. \n \n10. \nCoronavirus  disease.  The  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  declared  coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19) a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and \ndeclared  a  pandemic  on  11  March  2020. 16 The  project  remains  highly  relevant  in  COVID-19 \npandemic context as the provision of safe WSS in homes, schools, marketplaces, and health care \nfacilities,  and  improved  hygienic  conditions  are  essential  to  protecting  human  health  during  all \ninfectious disease outbreaks, including COVID-19 pandemic.17 The pandemic has led to loss of \n\n \n\n11 ADB.  2019.

The project will also help revive the tourism industry once the COVID-\n19 pandemic tourism-related restrictions are relaxed by improving WSS services in two heritage \ntowns. \n \nB. \n \n11. \nThe  project  seeks  to  improve  WSS  services  in  secondary  towns,  including  heritage \ntowns18  through a sector loan modality. Subprojects with high readiness are prioritized by GOR \nand  must  meet  all  the  agreed  subproject  selection  criteria.19 The  differentiated  approach  for \nsecondary  towns  in Rajasthan  includes a stronger  emphasis  on  ensuring ownership,  capacity, \nand readiness of ULBs to take over assets from the state government; and citywide sanitation \nsolutions that are more inclusive, cost-effective, and sustainable. The project includes towns with \na high proportion of indigenous peoples, with three towns (Abu Road, Banswara, and Pratapgarh) \nlocated in scheduled areas.20 \n \n12. \nThe project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) access to potable, affordable, reliable, \nequitable, and environmentally sustainable drinking water supply in all urban areas of Rajasthan \nimproved;21 and  (ii)  health  status of  urban population,  especially  the  poor and underprivileged, \nimproved. 22  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  quality,  reliability,  equity,  and \nsustainability of WSS services in project towns of Rajasthan improved.23 The investments in WSS \nwith 10-year O&M contracts, coupled with institutional strengthening of RUDSICO and ULBs in \ndistrict  headquarters,  heritage  towns,  and  other  market  centers  are  expected  to  ensure \noperational sustainability and improve quality of life in project towns, including for the poor and \nvulnerable.  The  project  is  also  expected  to  build  resilience  of  communities  to  manage  health \npandemics.  There are three project outputs. \n \nOutput 1: Water supply system in at least eight project towns improved. By 2027, at \n13. \nleast eight project towns with about 100,000 households will have five new or rehabilitated water \ntreatment plants (WTPs) and 1,350 kilometer (km) distribution networks to provide safer, more \nreliable,  and  more  equitable  water  supply  services.  The  systems  are  designed  for  and  are \nexpected to provide a 24-hour supply at most times, except during prolonged dry spells (efforts \nby  GOR  to  augment  its  water  supply  are  ongoing).  Water  safety  plans  will  be  implemented  to \nensure  water  quality  remains  potable  even  during  periods  of  intermittent  supply.  Distribution \nnetworks  use  a  district  metered  area  approach,  which  allows  the  network  to  be  hydraulically \nisolated; this will help in identifying and resolving water losses, meeting nonrevenue water (NRW) \ntargets, and managing water pressure to ensure equitable distribution. All households will have a \nwater  meter  that  allows for  volumetric  billing.  The water  supply  improvements  are expected  to \nbenefit all residents, including the urban poor, by reducing time spent collecting water from other \nsources,  which  may  be  costly  or  unhygienic,  while  the  reduction  in  waterborne  diseases  will \nminimize earning losses from missed work due to health issue. \n \n\n \n\n18 The heritage towns in the project are Khetri and Mandawa. \n19 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Criteria  for  declaring  any  area  as  a  \u201cScheduled  Area\u201d  under  the  Fifth  Schedule  of  the  Constitution  of  India  are                          \n\n(i) tribal (i.e., indigenous) peoples predominate; (ii) the area is compact and of reasonable size; (iii) there is a viable \nadministrative entity, such as a district, block, or taluk; and (iv) the area is economically backward compared with \nneighboring areas. \n\n21 Government of Rajasthan. 2018.

Jaipur. \n23 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f14. \nOutput 2: Sanitation system in at least 13 project towns developed or improved. By \n2027, at least 13 towns with about 103,000 households will have 19 sewage and one fecal sludge \ntreatment plants, 1,300 km sewer networks, and desludging trucks for citywide inclusive sanitation \nthrough a combination of onsite and sewerage solutions; this will ensure that the benefits\u2014which \ninclude  improved  services,  a  cleaner  and  more  hygienic  environment,  and  better  health\u2014are \nshared  by all  residents, including  the  urban poor.  The  approach  is  cost-effective as it  (i)  limits \nsewers  to  core  areas,  with  outer  areas  served  through  organized  desludging,  and  safe \ntransportation  and  treatment  of  sludge;  and  (ii)  prioritizes  rehabilitating  STPs  to  meet  current \neffluent  standards  over  constructing  new  assets.  Household  sewer  connections  are  included, \nincluding for poor households living in sewered zones. As a climate adaptation measure, project \nconsultants will provide support to ULBs in at least five project areas to identify users and structure \nagreements for wastewater reuse. \n \n15. \nOutput 3: Institutional and human capacities strengthened for sustainable service \ndelivery,  gender  equality,  and  improved  public  health.  By  2027,  the  project  will  have \nstrengthened the capacity and ensured the readiness of project ULBs to manage water supply \nand/or  sanitation  services  and  recover  O&M  costs.  The  project  will  strengthen  the  contract \nmanagement skills of at least 500 staff and 500 elected council members  of 14 project ULBs to \nsupport  monitoring  of  contractor  performance  and  service  levels,  construct  or  improve  office \nspace for new WSS divisions, and develop standard procedures for ULB O&M. A data platform \nthat incorporates supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), and a geographic information \nsystem will be established in each of the 14 project ULBs to support decision-making and efficient \nservice delivery. The project includes capacity strengthening of RUDSICO by making its financial \nmanagement system certified by an accredited institution. To promote gender equity, the project \nincludes  an  internship program  in  RUDSICO  so that  at  least  500  college-age women  will  gain \nprofessional experience in a technical field, with the broader objective of increasing the number \nof  women  working  on  urban  development  in  Rajasthan. 24  Awareness  programs  on  water \nconservation,  O&M,  financial  sustainability,  climate  change  impacts,  GESI  action  plan \nimplementation, and public health (including hygiene and minimizing the spread of communicable \ndiseases) will target students, elected officials, and ULB staff, and will be delivered throughout \nthe project implementation period. Training will be provided to at least 100 women including 50 \nwomen from scheduled caste, other backward castes, or scheduled tribes with limited economic \nopportunities to build their skills in related areas, such as plumbing and meter reading. \n \n16. \nThe  project  will  reduce  or  avoid  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  using  energy-efficient \nmotors,  maximizing  the  use  of  surface  water  sources  to  avoid  pumping  groundwater,  and \ninstalling solar panels on all facilities that are constructed. Climate adaptation measures of the \nproject include rainwater harvesting structures in new RUDSICO buildings. \n \nC. \n \n17. \nPartnership with ADB helps ensure a longer-term policy dialogue on deepening financial \nsustainability  and  institutional  strengthening  reforms,  particularly  in  local  governments,  and \nintroduces new good practices. Specifically, ADB will help ensure that the project incorporates \npractical  lessons  and  innovations;  is  inclusive,  resilient,  and  sustainable;  and  introduces \nappropriate technologies, such as a geographic information system, and supervisory control and \ndata  acquisition  with  a  control  and  command  center.  ADB  supports  sustainability  through  (i) \ntechnical due diligence that includes analysis of life-cycle costs, benefit maximization, and climate \nresilience;  (ii)  requirements  for  financial  sustainability  plans;  and  (iii)  support  for  institutional \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\n24 Appendix 7: Guidance Note on Women Internship Program of Project Administration Manual (accessible from the \n\nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fstrengthening and involvement of ULBs at all phases. ADB has also helped ensure a more cost-\neffective approach to sanitation through a shift from an exclusive waterborne sewage approach \nto a citywide inclusive sanitation approach, which ensures improved sanitation services for all. \nGESI targets are based on lessons from past projects and incorporate new opportunities such as \nsector-specific livelihood support for indigenous women, and a structured internship program for \nthe professional development of women (footnote 25). Holistic support from ADB to fill gaps in \nthe  provision  of  citywide  WSS,  along  with  measures  to  support  financial  sustainability  and \nempower  ULBs,  will  bring  significant  economic,  health,  and  environmental  benefits  to  project \ntowns, including for the urban poor.25 \n \nD. \n \n18. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $428.5  million  (Table  1).

ADB reviewed the subproject designs for 16 towns, \n14 of which were found to meet the technical subproject selection criteria. Subprojects in Didwana \n(sanitation) and Kuchaman (WSS) were fully appraised by ADB and found to meet all the agreed \ncriteria. Various aspects of additional sample subprojects were appraised to provide RUDSICO \nwith  a  model  of  the  types  of  issues  likely  to  be  encountered  across  the  range  of  ULBs:  two \nadditional  sample  subprojects  were  appraised  for  the  financial  and  economic  analysis;  seven \nwere appraised for environmental safeguards; and six were appraised for social safeguards. The \nexecuting agency is primarily responsible for finalizing appraisal reports and sharing these with \nADB  for  review.28 ADB  will  continue  to  review  the  appraisal  reports  for  all  subprojects.  ADB \nclearance of all safeguards documents is required. \n \nA. \n \n25. \nADB found the subprojects proposed under the project to be technically robust based on \na  comprehensive  review  of  feasibility  studies,  cost  estimates,  and  site  investigations.  The \nsubprojects  reviewed  by  ADB  meet  the  technical  subproject  selection  criteria  with  respect  to                        \n(i) rationale and relevance, benefits, and ease of implementation and O&M;  (ii) comparison with \ntechnical alternatives; (iii) life-cycle costs; (iv) maximizing beneficiary coverage, including for the \npoor;  and  (v)  avoiding  and  minimizing  adverse  environmental,  social,  heritage,  and  climate \n\nTechnical \n\n28 Subproject  selection  criteria  is  in  Appendix  3  of  Project  Administration  Manual  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial Viability29 \n\nchange impacts. The LSGD and RUDSICO assessed the viability of existing facilities, such as \nWTPs  and  STPs,  and  will  upgrade  them  to  meet  current  standards.  NRW  management, \nwastewater reuse, and rainwater harvesting are key project features that will serve to optimize \nuse  of  the  state\u2019s  scarce  water  resources.  Consultants  and  contractors  will  provide  ULBs  with \nO&M training. \n \nB. \n \n26. \nEconomic analysis. The economic rationale for the government\u2019s intervention is sound, \nas the project aims to provide better quality and more sustainable WSS services in the project \ntowns. The economic analysis evaluated the economic feasibility of five sample subprojects in \nthree  project  ULBs.30 The  estimated  economic  internal  rates  of  return  ranged  from  10.0%  to \n22.1%, which exceeds the economic opportunity cost of capital (estimated at 9.0%), indicating \nsignificant economic returns. The  overall sensitivity analysis results are satisfactory, except  for                 \n(i)  the  combined  worst-case  scenario  for  all  sanitation  subprojects  in  three  ULBs,  and  (ii)  the \nscenario  combining  a  capital  cost  overrun  of  20%  and  a  decrease  in  benefits  of  20%  for  the \nsanitation subproject in Kuchaman. However, the economic viability of the sample subprojects is \nexpected to increase if unquantifiable benefits such as environmental improvements are included \nin the analysis. \n \n27. \nFinancial analysis. An incremental recurrent cost analysis was conducted for five sample \nsubprojects in three project towns (footnote 31). None of the sample subprojects will generate \nadequate revenue for full O&M cost recovery through the existing tariff. This was confirmed by a \ncash-flow  analysis  of  project  ULBs  conducted  to  assess  their  capacity  to  cover  incremental \nrecurrent  costs  from  all  revenues,  such  as  tax  income,  user  charges,  and  external  grant \nresources.  To  ensure  subproject  sustainability,  the  GOR  approved  the  financial  sustainability \nplans prepared by the project ULBs, which include measures such as  (i) periodic tariff increase, \n(ii)  introduction  of  a  volumetric  tariff,  (iii)  improvement  of  collection  efficiency,  and  (iv)  GOR\u2019s \nfinancial support to fill gaps.  \n \nC. \n \n28. \nThe project has a sound institutional setup. PIUs are housed within each project ULB to \nensure ULBs are closely involved. The project will construct or improve the physical PIU office in \neach ULB, and GOR has agreed to increase the number of technical staff in each project ULB \n(ULBs  are  responsible  for  O&M,  including  supervision  of  the  O&M  to  be  undertaken  by  works \ncontractors for  10  years).  The Centre  for  Urban Development  and  Governance  established by \nGOR  will  continue  capacity  development  through  ongoing  training  for  urban  functionaries  and \nelected  representatives.  Nevertheless,  risk  to  project  sustainability  is  high,  because  all \nsubprojects are unlikely to generate adequate revenue for full O&M cost recovery through tariffs \nalone  without  regular  tariff  revisions.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  GOR  has  agreed  to  reinstate  and \nimplement  its  policy  for periodic  adjustment  of  the  water tariff,  provide transfers to ULBs  to  fill \nfunding gaps, and strengthen collection of the urban development tax. The project will also finance \nthe  initial O&M  by  using  private  contractors to  support  ULBs  during  the transition  period.  As  a \nproject  requirement,  GOR  and  ULBs  have  approved  financial  sustainability  plans  that  will  be  \nmonitored  by  GOR  and  ADB  during  implementation  through  quarterly  progress  reports.31 For \nenvironmental  sustainability,  the  project  will  improve  environmental  health  with  discharge  of \ntreated  wastewater  and  ensure  more  optimal  use  of  water  resources  through  improved  water \nmanagement and wastewater reuse. \n\nSustainability \n\n \n\n29 Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 The five sample subprojects are in (i) Banswara (WSS); (ii) Didwana (sanitation); and (iii) Kuchaman (WSS). \n31 Monitoring  will  include  the impacts  of  COVID-19  pandemic  on  the  government\u2019s  fiscal  position and its effects  on \n\nfinancial sustainability, which will be reflected in the progress reports. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\n \n \nD. \n \nThe  assessment  of  state-owned  enterprise  governance  concluded  that  RUDSICO  has \n29. \nbeen  complying  with the  standard procedures  and processes  of  the  Companies Act  2013  and \ndirectives of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. Areas of strength include the overall governance \nframework and significant experience of the merged entities to manage and execute large-scale \ninternally and externally aided projects. However, RUDSICO was only recently established, and \nboth RUDSICO and GOR need to show sustained commitment to achieving greater operational \nsynergies  between  all  merged  entities.  Institutional  reform  enables  the  improvement  of \nRUDSICO\u2019s viability as it can implement government- and donor-sponsored projects, and also \nlend funds to ULBs and others for urban development projects. Yet, it takes time for RUDISCO to \nbe fully equipped with staff and fully function. During this transition period, consultancy services \nunder the project will strengthen corporate governance practices in RUDSICO, with a focus on \nfinancial  management  and  human  resources,  and  strengthen  technical  support  for  ULBs. 32 \nIntegrity due diligence for RUDSICO has been conducted and no significant integrity risks have \nbeen identified. \n \n30. \nFinancial  management.  A  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  for  the \nLSGD  and  RUDSICO  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines.33 The  LSGD  and  RUDSICO  have \nadequate financial management capacity to (i) record financial transactions, (ii) provide reliable \nand timely financial reports, and (iii) safeguard the financial assets. The financial management \nrisk at RUDSICO is assessed to be substantial mainly because of (i) decentralized fund flow to \nseveral PIUs, (ii) inexperienced financial staff, and (iii) delays in approval of RUDSICO\u2019s audited \nfinancial statements. The main risk-mitigation actions are (i) appointing qualified financial staff, \nincluding  an  external  consultant;  (ii)  providing  training  on  ADB\u2019s  financial  management  and \ndisbursement procedures; (iii) requiring quarterly financial reporting; (iv) ensuring the project is \naudited by RUDSICO\u2019s internal audit function; (v) using the agreed audit terms of reference and \nreporting  templates;  and  (vi)  adhering  to  statutory  entity  audit  timelines.  The  project  financial \nstatements will be audited annually by an auditor acceptable to ADB, following auditing standards \nacceptable to ADB. \n \n31. \nProcurement. All procurement of goods and works and consultant recruitment will adhere \nto  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  the  Procurement \nRegulations  for  ADB  Borrowers  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Hybrid  contracts  with \ndesign\u2013build for STPs and WTPs, item rates for pipelaying works, and 10-years of O&M service \nwere selected as offering the best fit for the project\u2019s objectives. Larger packages were formed to \nattract  more  experienced  contractors  capable  of  providing  design,  works,  and  O&M  services. \nPrivate sector participation in O&M is important to ensure sustainability of assets after completion \nand for transferring skills to the ULBs. Part of the contractor\u2019s payment during the O&M phase is \nlinked to performance targets. The strategic integration of all these key aspects in the contracts \ncontributes to achieving value for money. \n \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to a lockdown across India beginning in March 2020, \n32. \nand civil works were halted. Along with the situation improvement, civil works have been partially \nresumed  in  Rajasthan.  The  main  construction  materials  required  by  the  project  are  available \nlocally, and other materials such as pipes are manufactured within Rajasthan or other states in \nIndia,  eliminating  any  dependency  on  global  supply  chains.

New health and \nsafety  measures  have  been  included  in  bidding  documents  and  works  contracts.  The  work \nschedules have been adjusted in works contracts. Components that can be quickly implemented \nwill be prioritized. \n \n33. \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government, GOR, LSGD, and RUDSICO. Specific policy requirements \nand  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  PAM  (footnote  19).  Based  on  risk \nassessments, some of the mitigation measures include (i) regular updating of the project website \nto  enhance  transparency  in  project  implementation,  procurement,  and  safeguards;  and  (ii)  an \neffective mechanism for grievance resolution. \n \nE. \n \n34. \nPoverty. The project will help achieve SDG 6 (access to clean water and sanitation for \nall) and others (footnote 14), and indirectly help reduce poverty. Pro-poor design features include \nproviding subsidized water supply connections and sewerage connections for BPL households, \nimproving  sanitation  services  in  slums,  and  awareness  campaigns  in  poor  and  marginalized \ncommunities. \n \nGender. The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. The following features \n35. \npromote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment: (i) increasing women\u2019s access to safe WSS \nand alleviating domestic burdens; (ii) providing the opportunity for female college students to gain \nwork experience through an internship program at RUDSICO (footnote 25); (iii) providing gender-\nrelated  capacity  building  for  ULB  officials  and  elected  representatives  to  raise  awareness  and \nbuild support among men and women for gender equality; (iv) providing training opportunities for \nwomen  ULB  staff  and  elected  representatives;  (v)  providing  sector-relevant  skills  training34 for \nwomen from scheduled caste, other backward castes, and scheduled tribes; and (vi) collecting \nsex-disaggregated data on staff, consultants, construction workers, and project-related training \nparticipants. 35  RUDSICO  and  ULBs  will  implement  a  GESI  action  plan  with  support  of \nconsultants29F\n    RUDSICO will nominate a gender focal point in the PMU and in each PIU to oversee \nand monitor the implementation of the GESI action plan. \n \nF. \n \nThe PMU will prepare semiannual environmental and social monitoring reports for ADB \n36. \nreview and disclosure. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS) (2009), the \nproject\u2019s safeguard categories are as follows. \n \nEnvironment (category B). Initial environmental examinations (IEEs) conducted for 10 \n37. \nsample subprojects in six towns indicate that the project is unlikely to have any significant adverse \nenvironmental  impacts that  are  irreversible,  diverse,  or  unprecedented.37 Potential  impacts  are \nsite-specific, temporary in nature, and can be mitigated through proper engineering designs and \nrecommended  mitigation  measures.  An  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s SPS and applicable laws and regulations will guide subproject selection, \nscreening, and categorization; environmental assessment; and the implementation of any other \n\nSafeguards \n\n36\n\n \n\n34 The training includes water audit methods and other technical skills in water management. \n35 The project will collect and publish relevant gender-specific information and sex-disaggregated data. \n36 Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n37 The sample subprojects are in (i) Abu Road (WSS); (ii) Didwana (sanitation); (iii) Khetri (WSS); (iv) Kuchaman (WSS); \n\n(v) Sardarshahar (WSS); (vi) and Ratangarh (sanitation). \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\fpotential subprojects. Category A subprojects will not be considered under the project. All draft \nIEEs  have  been  cleared  by  ADB,  and  environmental  management  plans  will  be  included  in \ncontract documents. Public consultations were conducted for sample subprojects during project \npreparation  and  consultations  will  continue  throughout  implementation.  Grievances  will  be \nhandled  following  the  project  grievance  redress  mechanism.  The  IEEs  and  environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  include  provisions  in  line  with  WHO\u2019s  guidance  to  help \nminimize the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 (footnote 17). \n \n38. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). A resettlement framework in line with ADB\u2019s SPS \nand  applicable  laws  was  prepared  to  guide  subproject  screening  and  assess  resettlement \nimpacts. Subprojects with significant involuntary resettlement impacts (classified as category A) \nwill not be eligible for funding. Based on the draft resettlement plans, resettlement and indigenous \npeoples plan (RIPP), and one due diligence report of five sample towns,38 the project will cause \nlimited impacts: (i) a significant economic impact on one non-titleholder family that is cultivating \ngovernment land, and (ii) temporary economic impacts during civil works. The sample subprojects \ninvolve  no  land  acquisition  or  physical  displacement.  Measures  in  the  draft  resettlement  plans \nand draft RIPP are adequate to deal with identified risks. Draft resettlement plans and/or RIPPs \nwill form part of the contract documents and will be updated during detailed design and submitted \nto  ADB  for  review  and  disclosure.  The  draft  resettlement  framework  and  plans  have  been \ndisclosed  to  project-affected  people  and  on  the  ADB  and  project  websites,  with  final  plans \ndisclosed  to  the  affected  persons. 39  Through  previous  projects  LSGD  has  demonstrated  its \ncapacity to implement the resettlement framework and meet the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. \n \nIndigenous peoples (category B). Scheduled tribes40 comprise only 3.2% of the state\u2019s \n39. \nurban population, but comprise 10.6% of the population in the sample town of Abu Road, and \n33.8% in six nearby villages, which are all located in a scheduled area (footnote 20). Scheduled \ntribes  will  benefit  from  the  improved  WSS  services.  In  the  sample  subprojects  appraised,  the \nbeneficiary scheduled tribes are not rendered vulnerable by the project. An indigenous peoples \nplanning framework was prepared in line with ADB\u2019s SPS and applicable laws to ensure that, for \nsubprojects  to  be  prepared  after  Board  approval,  scheduled  tribes  will  receive  culturally \nappropriate benefits;41 any adverse impacts will be addressed through indigenous peoples plans. \nCategory A subprojects will not be considered under the project.  The draft RIPP for Abu Road \nidentifies only beneficial impacts to scheduled tribes and has adequate measures to ensure tribes \nare  included  in  project  benefits.  Combined  RIPPs  will  also  be  required  for  Banswara  and \nPratapgarh.  The  draft  and  final  RIPPs  will  be  disclosed  to  affected  and  benefited  indigenous \npeoples  communities,  and  disclosed  on  ADB  and  project  websites.  Project  management  and \nimplementation consultants will assist the PMU of RUDSICO to manage indigenous peoples risks \nand impacts. \n \nG. \n \n40. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.42 \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\n \n\n \n\n38 Sample subprojects are (i) Abu Road (WSS), (ii) Didwana (sanitation), (iii) Kuchaman (WSS), (iv) Laxmangarh water \n\nsupply, (v) Ratangarh (sanitation), and (vi) Sirohi (WSS). \n\n39 Government of Rajasthan. Rajasthan Urban Infrastructure Development Project.  \n40 Defined by India\u2019s Constitution as those with at least one of the  following: (i) tribes\u2019 primitive traits, (ii) distinctive \nculture, (iii) shyness with the public at large, (iv) geographical isolation, and (v) social and economic backwardness. \n\n41 Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n42 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\nRisks \nWater shortages arising from \nextreme drought beyond \nprojections undermine the \nperformance of water supply \nand sanitation facilities. \nUrban local body revenue is \ninadequate to ensure \nfinancial and operational \nsustainability. \n\nPMU and PIUs do not have \nadequate, dedicated, and \nqualified accounting staff, \nresulting in delays and \nnoncompliance with ADB\u2019s \nfinancial management \nrequirements. \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigation Measures \nThe project includes measures for water conservation and climate change \nadaptation, such as minimizing water losses, monitoring consumption, and \nreusing wastewater. GOR is planning and implementing water \naugmentation in many project towns. \n\nGOR and project urban local bodies have prepared and will implement \nplans for full operation and maintenance cost recovery, including by \nadopting volumetric billing, increasing collection efficiency, and \nimplementing a sustained reduction in nonrevenue water and operating \ncosts. GOR is committed to providing gap funding where shortfalls exist. \nQuantitative targets for collection efficiency and operating ratio are loan \ncovenants. \nRUDSICO and/or GOR will assign fulltime, qualified accounting staff to the \nPMU and each PIU. ADB will provide regular training on agreed project \narrangements and procedures for financial management. A qualified \nfinancial management specialist will be hired as part of the project \nmanagement and capacity building consultant to support the PMU in \nsetting up project-specific financial management arrangements, providing \nhands-on training to project staff in PMU and PIUs, monitoring \ncompliance, and preparing consolidated financial reports. \nReadiness is high through advance actions. Protocols for communicable \ndiseases such as coronavirus disease will be followed by all contractors to \nensure adequate worker health and safety while allowing works to proceed \nsafely. \n\nImplementation delays due \nto coronavirus disease \npandemic result in time and \ncost overruns. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, GOR = Government of Rajasthan, PIU = project implementation unit, PMU = project \nmanagement unit, RUDSICO = Rajasthan Urban Drinking Water, Sewerage and Infrastructure Corporation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n41. \nThe  Government  of  India,  GOR,  LSGD,  and  RUDSICO  have  assured  ADB  that \nimplementation of the project shall conform to all applicable ADB requirements, including those \nconcerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services, \nfinancial management, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM (footnote 19) and loan \ndocuments.
