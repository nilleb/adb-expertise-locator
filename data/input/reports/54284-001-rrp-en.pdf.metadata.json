It  seeks to \nstrengthen  public  financial  management  (PFM),  reduce  fiscal  risks,  and  support  private  sector \ndevelopment toward restoring sustained and equitable economic growth. The program will also \nprovide further support for Palau\u2019s COVID-19 mitigation measures\u2014initially supported under the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) Health Expenditure and Livelihoods Support Program\u2014with the \navailability of assistance having been extended beyond January 2021 (para. 5).2 The program is \naligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  operational  priorities  of  strengthening  governance  and \ninstitutional capacity, including a differentiated approach to institutional strengthening and private \nsector  development  in  small  island  developing  states  (para.  9),  and  accelerating  progress  in \ngender equality.3 It is also consistent with the Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020 strategic priorities of \nmanaging risks by promoting sound public sector management and reducing costs by creating a \nmore enabling business environment, as well as with the proposed Pacific Approach 2021\u20132025.4 \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nDevelopment context. Palau is a small island developing state with a population of about \n18,600 (as of 2019) and a land area of 458 square kilometers. It is the most vulnerable economy \nglobally,  based  on  the  United  Nations\u2019  Economic  Vulnerability  Index. 5 Recent  shocks  include \ntyphoons Bopha in 2012 and Haiyan in 2013, a drought in 2016, and COVID-19 impacts in 2020. \nPalau receives grants averaging 9.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) through its Compact of \nFree Association with the United States. Although Palau is classified a high-income economy with \nnominal per capita gross national income of $16,490 in 2019, elevated cost structures stemming \nfrom its remoteness and small domestic market erode purchasing power.6  \n \n4. \nTourism-driven economy hit hard by COVID-19. With annual tourism receipts reaching \nthe  equivalent  of  36.5%\u201353.4%  of  GDP  during  FY2010\u2013FY2019,  Palau  is  among  the  most \ntourism-driven economies globally. However, the tourism industry has struggled since FY2016. \nFrom  a  peak  of  nearly  170,000  tourists  in  FY2015,  arrivals  declined  to  less  than  90,000  in \nFY2019.7 The drop was initiated by a drought that affected water supply in hotels and resorts, \n\n \n\n1  The  lending  proposal  is  included  in  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2020.

Data are from the World Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators (accessed 15 March 2021). \n\n7  Government of Palau. Visitor Arrivals (accessed 19 November 2020). \n\n\frestrictions on tour groups from the People\u2019s Republic of China, and subsequent reductions in \nflight services because of weak demand. Amid COVID-19 travel restrictions, arrivals fell by 53% \nto below 42,000 in FY2020 and could plunge to less than 10,000\u2014mostly essential travelers and \nreturning  residents\u2014if  travel  remains  restricted  until  end-FY2021.  Because  of  this  prolonged \ntourism downturn, Palau had seen successive economic contractions during FY2016\u2013FY2019, \nexcept  for  FY2018  when  the  economy  was  boosted  by  the  advent  of  high-speed  internet \nservices.8 Early assessments projected economic contractions of 9.5% in FY2020 and 12.8% in \nFY2021.9 The latest assessment of the  International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates a deeper \ncontraction of 10.3% in FY2020, with a further 7.8% decline projected for FY2021.10 However, the \nearly commencement of COVID-19 vaccination in Palau provides an upside to the outlook.11 \n \n5. \nReversal  from  fiscal  surpluses  to  near-term  deficits.  Even  amid  its  pre-pandemic \neconomic downturn, Palau demonstrated solid fiscal management by maintaining annual fiscal \nsurpluses averaging 3.0% of GDP during FY2011\u2013FY2019 (footnotes 9, 10, and 12). However, \nbecause of COVID-19 impacts on economic activity, tax collection declined by 25% in FY2020 \nand another 24% drop is expected in FY2021.12 With $20 million in additional spending to mitigate \nadverse impacts on the private sector authorized under the Coronavirus Relief One-Stop Shop \n(CROSS)  Program,  the  IMF  estimates  that  a  fiscal  deficit  equivalent  to  11.2%  of  GDP  was \nrecorded in FY2020.13 Another $12 million will be needed to extend CROSS assistance measures \nuntil the end of FY2021, which could push the deficit to 15.7% of GDP during this fiscal year.14 \n\n \n6. \nSound  macroeconomic  management  underpins  positive  outlook.  Robust  macro-\nfiscal management, which helped achieve surpluses before the COVID-19 shock, can facilitate a \nreturn  to  a  positive  fiscal  position  over  the  medium  term  when  growth  resumes  in  Palau.  On \nrevenues, reforms to raise tobacco taxes and departure taxes pushed the tax\u2013GDP ratio up to an \naverage of 20.2% in FY2015\u2013FY2019 from 17.3% in FY2005\u2013FY2014. Similarly, on expenditures, \nPalau has successfully controlled the public sector wage bill, which declined as a share of GDP \nto an average of 14.7% during FY2015\u2013FY2019 from 17.1% during FY2005\u2013FY2014. The IMF \nrecognizes  Palau\u2019s  record  of  fiscal  prudence,  which  led  to  a  buildup  of  government  deposits \n(footnote 10). The government saved the bulk of FY2011\u2013FY2019 fiscal surpluses, which resulted \nin the general fund reserve rising to 11.2% of GDP in FY2019.15 In line with the IMF\u2019s projections, \nADB expects the fiscal deficit to fall to 14.4% in FY2022 as growth resumes, and the government \npursues  expenditure  consolidation  measures  (including  controlling  recurrent  expenditures). 16 \nPublic debt is also projected to be sustainable (para. 27). \n\n \n8  ADB.

Thus, \nPalau  is  on  track  to  be  among  the  first  countries  globally  to  be  mostly  vaccinated  against  COVID-19,  which  can \nsupport an earlier revival of tourism and a less severe FY2021 economic contraction. \n\n12 Graduate  School  USA.  2020.

Details \n\nof a further extension in availability of assistance are being finalized, to refine existing delivery systems. \n\n15 In FY2014, the government established a permanent general fund reserve as a fiscal buffer to be drawn on during \nstates of national emergency or periods when projected local revenues fall by more than 5% from the previous year. \n16 Debt Sustainability Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) provides more information \non the fiscal outlook. The IMF\u2019s projected FY2022 fiscal deficit is smaller (at 8.7% of GDP) as it does not account for \nanticipated transfers to state governments, whose fiscal buffers have been depleted by the COVID-19 crisis. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fKey fiscal constraints. The IMF highlights several challenges that the government needs \n7. \nto  address  for  fiscal  sustainability,  especially  with  the  impending  expiry  of  Compact  financial \nassistance in FY2024 (para. 3), which are made more critical by the COVID-19 crisis.17 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nLack  of  a  medium-term  outlook.  Palau\u2019s  budget  is  missing  a  multiyear \nperspective,  with  fiscal  policy  only  required  to  adhere  to  a  legal  requirement  of \nmaintaining at least a balanced budget for spending financed through the general \nfund.  Although  a  medium-term  fiscal  strategy  (MTFS)  was  prepared  with  ADB \ntechnical assistance (TA), this requires updating given COVID-19 pressures.18 \nOutdated and inefficient tax regime. Palau\u2019s tax system relies heavily on gross \nrevenue  taxes  and  import  duties,  which  together  account  for  half  of  annual \ncollections.  This  system  is  inefficient  and  distortionary,  and  discourages  private \ninvestment. During FY2015\u2013FY2019, Palau\u2019s tax\u2013GDP ratio was 20.2%, below the \n24.4%\u201329.0% range for other tourism-driven Pacific economies. \nSignificant transfers to  state-owned enterprises  and social security funds. \nWith tariffs set below full cost recovery, Palau Public Utilities Corporation (PPUC) \nrequired subsidies averaging $1.5 million (2.3% of recurrent spending) in 5 of the \n7  years  from  FY2013  to  FY2019. 19 Further,  in  FY2019,  Palau\u2019s  social  security \nfunds  received  transfers  totaling  $3.7  million  (3.4%  of  recurrent  spending)  and \nneeds are projected to rise because of substantial unfunded liabilities. \n\n \nWeak  business  environment.  Although  Palau\u2019s  private  sector  contributes  about  two-\n8. \nthirds of annual GDP, weak legal frameworks contribute to low investment\u2014private sector credit \nwas  only  11.9%  of  GDP  during  FY2015\u2013FY2019\u2014and  constrain  growth  in  business  and \nemployment  opportunities.  The  absence  of  unified  rules  and  procedures  for  international \ncommercial  arbitration  discourages  cross-border  investment  because  of  perceived  risks  from \ndomestic dispute resolution mechanisms. Palau\u2019s corporations legislation is also outdated, still \nrequiring  incorporators  to  appear  before  a  clerk  of  the  Supreme  Court  or  a  notary  to  sign \napplication documents, for approval by the President of Palau.20 Further, the absence of a modern \nelectronic  corporations  registry  leads  to  information  gaps  that  can  be  exploited  by  beneficial \nowners of companies for tax avoidance or evasion and for possible money laundering. Moreover, \na framework for public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) is absent. In April 2019, Palau entered its first \nPPP arrangement\u2014for the upgrading and management of a new international airport terminal\u2014\nfacilitated  by  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency.  With  more  PPPs  expected  in  the \nmedium term, including in renewable energy generation, a formal PPP framework will be needed \nto  guide  the  selection,  monitoring,  and  regulation  of  private  sector  partners  to  minimize  the \npotential for incurring new contingent liabilities that would add to the government\u2019s debt burden. \nThe government plans to encourage PPPs to expand the revenue base for tax collections. \n \n9. \nReform context. A differentiated approach to supporting public sector reforms is needed \nin  small  island  developing  states  constrained  by  limited  capacity,  including  Palau.  For  policy-\nbased operations, this involves using a programmatic approach with initial actions that  lay the \nfoundation for more substantive reforms, interim milestones to sustain momentum and maintain \nthe government\u2019s focus on reform outputs, broad-based engagement while building capacity for \ndeeper reforms, and integration with ADB country activities to reinforce results achievement.21 \n\n \n\n17 IMF. 2019.

Previous  ADB  policy-based  operations  in  Palau  demonstrated  the  need  for \n10. \n(i) parallel TA to supplement the reform design and implementation capacities in key government \nagencies,  and  (ii)  sustained  consultations  with  stakeholders  to  mitigate  risks  of  reform  delays \namid  changes  in  political  leadership.22 Further,  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  implementation  of  Pacific \nbudget support programs during the 2008\u20132009 global crisis highlight the critical need to support \naggregate demand, while protecting the fiscal position through well-targeted stimulus packages.23 \n \nB. \n \n11. \nProgram  description.  The  government  recognizes  the  need  for  complementary  policy \nreforms to safeguard fiscal sustainability amid the COVID-19 crisis. This is demonstrated in its \ncommitment to (i) implement its MTFS, (ii) adopt a fiscal responsibility act (FRA), and (iii) restart \nthe tax reform process, as expressed in the June 2020 development policy letter for the Health \nExpenditure  and  Livelihoods  Support  Program  (footnote  2).  A  policy-based  loan  is  a  suitable \nmodality  to  support  the  government\u2019s  wide-ranging  reform  agenda.  A  programmatic  approach \nallows  for  the  prioritization  and  sequencing  of  policy  actions\u2014to  account  for  implementation \ncapacity constraints\u2014while bridging budget support needs to sustain reform momentum. It also \nprovides the flexibility to adapt the reform agenda to emerging opportunities and constraints. \n \n12. \nThe program aligns with the  government\u2019s  reform agenda to safeguard Palau\u2019s  longer-\nterm  fiscal  sustainability  (para.  11).  Both  subprograms  will  support  reforms  in  three  areas: \n(i)  the  policy  and  legislative  framework  for  PFM  strengthened;  (ii)  fiscal  risks  from  weak \nmanagement  of  public  revenue,  expenditure,  and  liabilities  reduced;  and  (iii)  private  sector \ndevelopment  supported  (Appendix  4).  Subprogram  1  lays  the  foundation  for  improving  fiscal \nsustainability  through  the  introduction  of  upgraded  policy  frameworks,  guidelines,  and  plans \n(paras. 15 and 17); the approval of comprehensive reviews and evaluations, with recommended \nreforms (paras. 19 and 20); and the preparation and President\u2019s transmittal of critical legislative \nbills to Palau\u2019s National Congress (Olbiil Era Kelulau [OEK]) for approval (paras. 14, 16, 18, and \n20). Subprogram 2 will build on this foundation by starting to implement refined guidelines and \nplans; adopting reform recommendations from reviews and evaluations; and institutionalizing key \nreforms. The program seeks to include strong reform actions by the government. However, it is \nalso important to ensure that reforms move forward steadily with attention to the achievement of \nmedium-term  objectives.  To  promote  this,  the  program  includes  a  critical  administrative  action \nthat sets a high-level direction to initiate the strengthening of the legal and regulatory framework \nfor PPPs, which will facilitate increased  private sector participation in public service delivery.24 \nReform  targets  account  for  implementation  capacity  constraints,  given  Palau\u2019s  small  public \nadministration (para. 9). \n \n13. \nUnder subprogram 1, ADB supports 10 prior actions, all of which have been completed. \nTen  indicative  triggers  have  been  identified  for  subprogram  2,  for  refinement  based  on \ngovernment priorities and capacity, considering possible continued COVID-19 disruptions. \n \n14. \nReform area 1: Policy and legislative framework for public financial management \nstrengthened.

Manila. \n\n24 For subprogram 1, policy action 3.2 (Appendix 4) is considered an administrative action, as establishing a technical \nworking group is a critical step toward developing a robust PPP policy statement under subprogram 2 (para. 20). \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fprovisions for managing public revenue, expenditure, debt, and fiscal buffers. The FRA includes \nprovisions to be reflected in annual national budgets, for (i) maintaining operating expenditures \nwithin medium-term targets; (ii) prioritizing capital spending to upgrade public assets over time; \n(iii) maintaining debt at prudent levels; (iv) preserving the real value of Palau\u2019s Compact Trust \nFund (footnote 17) by establishing investment and withdrawal rules; (v) adopting a modern and \nefficient tax regime suitable for a tourism-based economy; (vi) managing reserves as insurance \ncoverage for cyclical downturns, disasters, and climate change impacts; and (vii) managing fiscal \nrisks  from  public  sector  entities,  including  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  and  social  security \nfunds. The President has transmitted the bill to the OEK for approval. The FRA prescribes a strict \nprocess  for  departure  from  these  provisions  to  allow  for  flexibility  during  fiscal  shocks.  The \ngovernment  may  deviate  from  FRA  provisions  provided  that  the  departure  is  temporary,  with \nreasonable justification and specification of a clear period after which fiscal policy must revert to \nadherence  to  FRA  provisions.  Subprogram  2  will  commence  the  implementation  of  FRA \nprovisions, starting with the inclusion of a new economic and fiscal update section to underpin the \nFY2022 budget. This section will provide a detailed assessment of how the government\u2019s fiscal \nprogram adheres to specific FRA provisions toward safeguarding fiscal sustainability. \n \n15. \nSubprogram  1  also  supports  the  preparation  of  MTFS  guidelines  that  adhere  to  FRA \nprovisions, which were issued as a presidential directive. The implementation of the guidelines \nwill  begin  under  subprogram  2  through  the  presentation  of  an  MTFS  that  applies  a  multiyear \nbudgeting  approach  in  the  FY2022  budget.  The  MTFS  will  be  refined  annually  to  reflect  the \nprevailing macro-fiscal context. Annual budget statements will supplement and update the MTFS. \n \n16. \nReform area 2: Fiscal risks from weak management of public revenue, expenditure, \nand  liabilities  reduced.  Since  COVID-19  requires  substantial  borrowing,  greater  domestic \nresource  mobilization,  more  efficient  public  spending,  and  improved  debt  management  are \nneeded to create sufficient fiscal space to service debt. Subprogram 1 supports the design and \ndevelopment of a tax reform package that (i) broadens the revenue base by replacing the general \nimports  tax  with  a  value-added  tax  that  brings  consumption  of  services  into  the  tax  net, \n(ii) eliminates distortions by moving from gross revenue taxation to a net profits tax and replacing \nimport  duties  for  alcohol  and  tobacco  with  an  excise  tax  that  also  applies  to  local  production, \n(iii) promotes equity by adjusting income thresholds for the wages and salaries tax and aligning \nthe net profits tax with the highest marginal tax rates for wages and salaries, and (iv) includes \nactions to help remove barriers to businesses owned by women. The President has transmitted \nthe tax reform package to the OEK for approval. Under subprogram 2, a tax reform committee \nwill be established and operationalized by the Ministry of Finance (MOF), with at least 30% female \nstaff, to oversee tax reform implementation, including the development of implementing rules and \nregulations and the identification of systems upgrading and capacity-building needs. \n \n17. \nOn  expenditures,  subprogram  1  supports  the  MOF  in  (i)  adopting  public  expenditure \nreprioritization measures during FY2021, including adjustments to the targeting and delivery of \nCOVID-19 assistance, based on recommendations from the FY2020 Economic and Fiscal Review, \nthe  first  of  regular  evaluations  of  budget  execution  amid  the  pandemic;  and  (ii)  preparing  and \nendorsing a climate-resilient and gender-sensitive national infrastructure investment plan (NIIP), \nprioritizing timely upgrades to and adequate maintenance of existing assets. The NIIP supports \nthe FRA provision of prioritizing capital expenditures to ensure an increase in national net worth. \nSubprogram  2  aims  for  the  implementation  of  the  NIIP,  as  reflected  in  annual  capital  budgets \nstarting in FY2022. Expenditure reprioritization will continue in FY2022 (and beyond, potentially \nsupported  by  a  post-program  partnership  framework  [para.  28],  as  needed),  informed  by  a \nsuccessive review of evolving COVID-19 impacts and relief measures (footnote 14). \n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fSubprogram  1  supports  the  development  of  a  bill  for  an  external  debt  management \n18. \nframework, with provisions for strengthening the review of the fiscal and economic implications of \nnew borrowing, while improving debt transparency. The framework requires the creation of a debt \nmanagement  unit  responsible  for  the  technical  due  diligence  and  debt  sustainability  analysis \n(DSA) of any proposed borrowing. The President has transmitted the bill to the OEK for approval. \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  MOF  will  issue  a  debt  management  policy  that  supports  the \nimplementation of the framework toward ensuring positive societal returns from public borrowing. \n \nThe MOF has endorsed the results of an actuarial evaluation of the social security pension \n19. \nfund under subprogram 1, including reforms to restore longer-term sustainability. The evaluation \nassesses the adjustments required to restore sustainability in the long-term contribution\u2013benefit \nratio. 25 Pressures  from  the  COVID-19  crisis  will  be  considered  in  developing  options  to  limit \nlegislative action on unfunded benefits. Subprogram 2 targets the transmittal by the President of \na social security reform bill, based on the evaluation\u2019s recommendations, to the OEK for approval. \n \n20. \nReform  area  3:  Private  sector  development  supported.  The  program  supports \nbroadening  the  revenue  base  through  expanded  business  opportunities,  which  are  critical  for \nfiscal  sustainability  and  long-term  growth.  Subprogram  1  supports  (i)  the  preparation  of  an \ninternational  arbitration  bill,  which  the  President  has  transmitted  to  the  OEK  for  approval\u2014\nallowing  for  and  recognizing  clauses  on  the  international  arbitration  of  commercial  disputes  in \nbusiness  contracts  between  local  and  foreign  partners\u2014to  encourage  more  foreign  direct \ninvestment;26 (ii) the creation of an interministerial technical working group through a presidential \ndirective, with guidance on developing a policy statement for a PPP framework to facilitate private \nsector participation in public service delivery;27 and (iii) MOF endorsement of a comprehensive \nreview of the corporations bill, identifying additional provisions including for the development of \nan electronic companies registry that supports increased transparency on beneficial ownership to \nincrease  tax  compliance  and  reduce  integrity  risks.  Subprogram  2  aims  for  the  international \narbitration bill to be approved by the OEK and signed into law, as well as the President\u2019s issuance \nof a PPP framework and transmittal to the OEK for the approval of an updated Corporations Bill. \n \n21. \nADB\u2019s value addition. The program builds on previous ADB policy-based operations and \npublic sector management TA in Palau.28 It complements concurrent ADB policy-based lending \nsupport for tariff, financial management, and corporate governance reforms in the PPUC that will \nreduce  subsidy  requirements  and  contingent  liability  risks  for  Palau\u2019s  largest  SOE  (para.  7). \nADB is also mobilizing parallel TA to help advance critical reforms, including for preparing key \npieces of legislation\u2014such as the FRA and the international arbitration bill\u2014and undertaking an \nactuarial study of the social security fund.29 Further TA may be provided in coordination with the \n\n \n\n25 In FY2017, an additional $50 per month in benefits was legislated, supported by a government transfer of $2 million \nand an increase in the contribution rates of employers and employees from 6% to 7%. A further $50 per month was \nawarded to beneficiaries in FY2019, but with no compensating increase in rates, leaving the system imbalanced. \n26 The bill is based on model legislation that provides rules and procedures for parties to conduct arbitration. It covers \nall  stages  of  the  arbitral  process  from  the  arbitration  agreement,  the  composition  and  jurisdiction  of  the  arbitral \ntribunal, and the extent of court intervention through to the recognition and enforcement of the arbitral award. \n\n27 The technical working group is composed of members from various divisions of the MOF and the Ministry of Public \nInfrastructure, Industries and Commerce. It was directed by the President to prepare a PPP policy statement that \noutlines the regulatory and legal framework for PPPs in Palau by no later than end-March 2021. \n\n28 ADB.

The new President fully supports the program, as \nindicated by the new Minister of Finance\u2019s signed Development Policy Letter (Appendix 3). \n \nDevelopment partner coordination.  The program was developed in coordination with \n23. \nthe  IMF  to  help  safeguard  macroeconomic  stability  during  the  COVID-19  crisis.  TA  from  the \nPFTAC helped the government to assess options for making the tax system more efficient and \nequitable, including an impact analysis of the potential introduction of value-added tax. This led \nto  the  development  of  the  tax  reform  package,  which  is  supported  under  reform  area  2  of  the \nprogram  (para.  16).  The  PFTAC  is  supporting  parallel  tax  administration  reforms,  including \nsystems strengthening for on-time filing and payment as well as the management of tax arrears.30 \nAn IMF assessment letter was received by ADB in January 2021. The government is engaging \nwith other partners, including the World Bank and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, \nfor possible budget support. ADB is in regular dialogue with these development partners. \n \nC. \n \n24. \nThe reforms will shift Palau\u2019s economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis toward a more \nsustainable  fiscal  path.  A  strengthened  policy  and  legislative  framework  for  PFM  will  support \nfiscally responsible and strategic budgeting toward efficient allocation of government resources. \nBy reducing fiscal risks and improving the management of public revenue and expenditure, the \ngovernment can generate fiscal space for more productive spending to support recovery. Further \nprivate sector development will help broaden the economic and revenue bases, which, in turn, \nwill contribute to longer-term fiscal sustainability. The impact that the program is aligned with is \nenhanced quality of life for current and future generations of Palauans.31 The subprogram reforms \nwill contribute to this through sequenced policy actions (paras. 14\u201320). The program is expected \nto help reduce the fiscal deficit to 5.5% of GDP or less (from 14.4% of GDP projected in FY2022), \nand raise the tax\u2013GDP ratio to above the pre\u2013COVID-19 average of 20.2% by FY2023. Further, \nthe implementation of reforms of both revenue and expenditure will help the government generate \nsufficient fiscal space to service higher debt levels arising from the COVID-19 crisis.32 \n \nD. \n \n25. \nThe impacts of COVID-19 restrictions are expected to raise the government\u2019s financing \nneeds  significantly,  as  reflected  in  projected  fiscal  deficits  of  $37.1  million  (15.7%  of  GDP)  in \nFY2021 and $37.9 million (14.4% of GDP) in FY2022 (Table 1). Based on these substantial needs, \nthe  government  has  requested  program  financing  of  $55  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources. The proposed financing will be disbursed in two subprograms\u2014$25 million in FY2021 \nand $30 million in FY2022. Along with the program supporting PPUC reforms (footnote 19), ADB\u2019s \nbudget support will total $30 million in FY2021 and $35 million in FY2022. \n \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support  \n\n \n\nInitiative,  Phase  IV;  and  ADB.

Palau\u2019s public debt is mostly external, with domestic debt equivalent \nto 7.0% of GDP as of FY2019. External public debt fell gradually from 38.3% of GDP in FY2009 \nto 23.1% in FY2015, before a rise to 31.1% in FY2019 amid infrastructure investments supported \nby ADB.33 The onset of the COVID-19 crisis pushed Palau\u2019s public debt\u2013GDP ratio to 57.7% in \nFY2020. Although a further rise in public debt\u2013GDP to 70.9% in FY2021 and a peak of 74.4% in \nFY2022 is projected, ADB\u2019s updated DSA shows that debt will maintain a steady downward trend \nin the medium term as the economy recovers (footnote 16). With sustained recovery, the public \ndebt\u2013GDP ratio can revert below the pre-COVID-19 level by FY2030, even under conservative \neconomic  growth  assumptions.  Further,  while  total  projected  borrowing  during  FY2021  and \nFY2022 will add to debt service obligations, the complementary implementation of fiscal reforms \ncan ensure sufficient resources for annual repayments. Program support to contain fiscal risks \nfrom SOEs and the social security pension fund will also help ensure that contingent liabilities are \nminimized. ADB\u2019s DSA concludes that Palau\u2019s debt remains sustainable and fiscal vulnerabilities \nare contained. These results align with the conclusions of the IMF (footnote 10). \n \nE. \n \n28. \nThe MOF will be the executing agency responsible for overall program monitoring, as well \nas the primary implementing agency coordinating progress toward policy actions. Implementing \nagencies  include  the  President\u2019s  Office  and  Office  of  the  Attorney  General  for  preparation  of \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n33 ADB.

A program steering committee headed by \nthe  Minister  of  Finance  has  been  established  to  monitor  progress  in  reform  implementation. \nADB regional TA has been mobilized to facilitate the implementation of program policy actions \n(para. 21). The program implementation period is July 2020\u2013July 2022 (subprogram 1: July 2020\u2013\nJuly 2021; subprogram 2: August 2021\u2013July 2022). ADB and the government will discuss a post-\nprogram partnership framework to support the continued implementation of subprogram 2 actions \nbeyond the program.  The proceeds of the policy-based  loans will be withdrawn in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time).34 \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n29. \nGovernance. Palau has a strong recent record of sound fiscal management, as exhibited \nby the achievement of annual fiscal surpluses since FY2011, but the IMF points to broader PFM \naspects that need to be improved over the medium term (para. 7). Although a public expenditure \nand financial accountability (PEFA) self-assessment was conducted in 2013, the results are not \npublicly available and a planned follow-on formal assessment has been delayed. The PFTAC is \npreparing  to  conduct  a  streamlined  or  AgilePEFA,  along  with  pilot-testing  of  a  PEFA  climate \nmodule, as indicated in its FY2021 work plan for Palau (footnote 30). These assessments, which \nshould lead to a formal PEFA assessment, will be critical to identify further actions for inclusion in \nan  updated  PFM  reform  plan.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained to and discussed with the government. \n \n30. \nPoverty and inequality. With per capita incomes at risk of falling to pre-FY2001 levels in \nreal terms, basic needs poverty could rise from 19.4% of Palau\u2019s population in 2014 to 26.5% by \nthe end of FY2021.35 A strengthened policy and legislative framework for PFM will allow more \nstrategic fiscal planning for efficient allocation of public finances. Reduced fiscal risks from the \nmanagement of public revenue, expenditure, and liabilities will create additional fiscal space that \ncan be harnessed to increase productive public spending, including for basic services and social \nprotection. Private sector development will result in expanded income-generating opportunities. \n \n31. \nGender. The program is classified some gender elements. It ensures more resources in \nthe short term to support disadvantaged groups against COVID-19 crisis impacts and to preserve \nrecent  gender  equality  gains.  Actions  to  reduce  fiscal  risk  and  improve  public  revenue  and \nexpenditure management ensure that gender analysis is considered as part of decision-making \nand  creates  opportunities  to  support  women  entrepreneurs:  (i)  the  tax  reform  bill  minimizes \ndisincentives for new and small businesses, including potential and existing women entrepreneurs, \nby moving to a more efficient and equitable net profits tax; (ii) the FY2020 fiscal review includes \ngender analysis of the impacts of cost-saving measures and gender-sensitive lessons for national \nbudgets, particularly in light of COVID-19 impacts; and (iii) the MOF has approved an NIIP that \nincludes processes to ensure that women\u2019s needs and priorities are considered in the prioritization \nand selection of projects. Further measures to support gender equality outcomes will be pursued \nfor subprogram 2, including the collection of sex-disaggregated data in PFM systems to support \ninitial gender-responsive budgeting actions and through an electronic companies registry. \n \n32. \nSafeguards. Based on an evaluation of the potential impacts of supported policy actions, \nthe  program  will  not  result  in  any  adverse  consequences  for  the  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, or indigenous peoples. In line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the \nprogram is classified category C for environment, involuntary settlement, and indigenous peoples. \n\n \n\n34 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 Government  of  Palau.  2019.

This includes technical assistance from ADB \non formulation of key legislation and the Pacific Financial Technical \nAssistance Centre on tax policy and administration. \nADB  worked  with  the  government  to  replenish  Palau\u2019s  contingent \ndisaster  financing  instrument  in  November  2020.  This  restores \nPalau\u2019s ability to access quick-disbursing financing in the event of \nany disaster or health emergency. The government is continuously \nworking  with  development  partners,  including  ADB,  to  build  the \nhealth system\u2019s capacity for surveillance and COVID-19 testing. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n34. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \nagreements.
