I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Integrated Development of Key Townships in Central \nLiaoning.1 \n \n2.  The  project  will  promote  balanced  and  environmentally  sustainable  urbanization  by \nsupporting the development of seven key townships in central Liaoning Province of the PRC.2 The \nproject will support wastewater management, energy-efficient heating supply, urban road and \nbridge rehabilitation and construction, and related services. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Located in northeast PRC, Liaoning Province has seen economic growth lag that of other \nprovinces since 1980 due to resource depletion and a painful transition from a state-dominated \neconomy. Moreover, rapid urbanization has left many of Liaoning\u2019s cities and towns with poor \ninfrastructure,  severe  pollution,  significant  poverty,  and  rural  migrants  with  mismatched-\nemployment skills. Central Liaoning's current population of 23.6 million is now 65% urban, and \nplanners expect 85% of the population to be urban by 2050, largely through rural\u2013urban migration.3 \nConsequently,  in  the  coming  decades,  demand  from  millions  of  rural  migrants  for  urban \ninfrastructure, municipal services, and employment must be satisfied. Recent announcements on \nhukou reform are expected to intensify this demand.4  \n \n4.  The Government of Liaoning Province recognizes that urbanization is pressuring Shenyang, \nthe provincial capital, which has a population of 7.4 million. At the same time, it aims to reap the \nbenefits of concentrated urbanization, so it is facilitating the urbanization of key townships by \nstrengthening their infrastructure to support higher populations. Reflecting earlier ADB advice,5 \nLiaoning urbanization strategies6 support the Shenyang Economic Zone Integration Strategy.7 The \nproject\u2019s rationale is to support strategic urbanization in central Liaoning Province through targeted \nwastewater management, district heating, and urban transport development in key townships. The \nparticipating  townships  were  selected  through  a  competitive  process  eliciting  proposals  from \neligible townships. Considerations included consistency with planning objectives and a balanced \nrepresentation of the integrated development concept, as Shenbei and Waitoushan are in the core \nShenyang metropolitan area; Fuxin, Gaizhou, and Xinmin are located in intercity connection belts \noutside the core metropolitan area; and Heishan and Huanren are included to demonstrate rural \nlinks with more-concentrated urban areas.  \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  \u201cTownship\u201d here includes the cities of Gaizhou and Xinmin, urban districts of Shenbei and Waitoushan, counties of \nHeishan and Huanren), and township of Sihe in Fuxin. \n3  Liaoning Provincial Government. 2009. Liaoning Yearbook 2009\u20132010. Shenyang. \n4  PRC citizens are assigned a hukou registration and location, either a specific rural township and village or a specific \nurban district. The hukou location specifies where one is entitled to receive economic and social benefits. When rural \npeople migrate to cities, they have no social benefits unless their hukou status is changed, which is very difficult. Some \ncities now grant temporary rights for a certain period. In February 2012, the State Council released a circular on hukou \nreform stating that migrant workers and their families should be eligible to apply for permanent residence permits or \nurban hukou in all county- and prefectural-level cities (as are most of the townships participating in the project), while \nadding that new rules pertaining to hukou conversion should not require that people relinquish their claims to rural \nland. \n5  ADB. 2004.

Improving wastewater management is a priority for Liaoning Province as water resources \nare scarce at merely 800 cubic meters (m3) per capita, one-third of the national average. Poor \nwastewater treatment facilities in Shenbei new district degrade water quality in the Shenbei branch \nof  the  Liao  River  and  impede  development;  the  proposed  project  will  construct  wastewater \nmanagement systems to support urban development. Likewise, poor district heating services affect \nliving quality. By the end of 2010, centralized district heating served 19 million square meters (m2) \nof the Fuxin urban area, with the rest serviced by small boilers and heating stoves in individual \nhouseholds. During winter, pollutants from these coal-fired boilers and stoves pollute the air. The \nurban  poor  and  especially  women  suffer  disproportionately  from  poor  service  quality,  limited \nheating coverage, and higher exposure to pollutants. With project support, the Fuxin municipal \ngovernment will commission new distribution capacity and close 15 coal-fired boilers. An existing \ncombined heat-and-power plant will provide hot water to the system. The development will improve \nenergy efficiency and service quality, expand district heating coverage, reduce coal use by 21,500 \ntons annually, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and improve air quality. \n \n6.  Central Liaoning\u2019s urban population is growing rapidly. However, urban road development \nis slow, facilities for public transport and nonmotorized transport (NMT) are inadequate, and traffic \nmanagement and safety are poor. The project will facilitate environmentally sustainable urban \ninfrastructure development and improve urban road links and related facilities by rehabilitating and \nupgrading urban roads and alleys, constructing urban roads and bridges, improving storm-water \npipelines and sewer coverage, installing energy-conserving lighting, and expanding public green \nareas. The project will improve road safety and public transport services by piloting a public \ntransport program and implementing road safety and traffic management initiatives. Finally, in \nrecent years, local governments in Liaoning have, like others in the PRC, relied on debt issuance \nand sales of land-use rights to finance infrastructure and service expansion. But with increased \nlocal government liabilities and emerging downside risks regarding sales of land-use rights, there is \npressure to make local government finances more sustainable. The project will help examine \nfinancing  options  and  measures  for  strengthening  creditworthiness  by  providing  financial \nmanagement support and training, as well as programs to enhance leadership. \n \n7.  Strategic  fit.  The  project  will  support  the  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015,  which \nsponsors balanced urbanization and the development of cities that are livable, resource-conserving, \nand inclusive, emphasizing the fostering of urban clusters. The project is consistent with Liaoning \nurbanization strategies (see footnotes 6 and 7) and aligns with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy \n2011\u20132015  for  the  PRC.8 It  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  urban  sector  strategy  and  its  Urban \nOperational Plan, which fosters competitive, green, and inclusive cities.9 It supports ADB\u2019s Climate \nChange Program by reducing vehicle emissions per trip, enhancing water resource management, \nand  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  coal-fired  heating  boilers.10 ADB\u2019s  Sustainable \nTransport  Initiative  has  informed  the  design  of  urban  road  components  and  related  capacity \ndevelopment assistance, for instance through support for public transport.11 Finally, in keeping with \nADB's Strategy 2020, the project\u2019s support for urban infrastructure and municipal services will \nstrengthen private sector participation and the competitiveness of central Liaoning.12   \n \n8.

Innovative features. The project has the following demonstration features: (i) strategic \nurbanization supporting a model of concentrated urbanization, which evidence suggests yields \nhigher per capita incomes, more efficient energy use, reduced loss of arable land, and lower \ngreenhouse  gas  emissions  than  less-concentrated  alternatives; 14  (ii)  strengthened  financial \nmanagement,  in  recognition  of  mounting  pressures  that  threaten  fiscal  sustainability,  that  is \ndeveloped  to  gauge  and  strengthen  participating  townships\u2019  creditworthiness  and  identify \nalternative financing approaches; (iii) heightened leadership, focusing on a leadership development \nprogram that promotes social inclusion; and (iv) people-centric urban infrastructure and public \ntransportation  promotion,  including  holistic road  designs,  road  safety features  such  as traffic-\ncalming measures and separate NMT lanes, and bus priority lanes.    \n. \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The project\u2019s impact will be more competitive, green, and inclusive urbanization in key \ntownships  in  central  Liaoning. The  project  outcome  will  be  improved  sanitation,  heating,  and \ntransport services in key townships in Liaoning. \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  The project has four outputs:  \n(i)  Wastewater  management  improvements.  The  Qingshuitai  town  wastewater \ntreatment plant (WWTP) will be constructed in Shenbei new district with a capacity \nof 10,000 m3 per day and 18.7 kilometers (km) of sewer pipelines.  \n(ii)  Fuxin  (Sihe  town)  district  heating  network.  To  upgrade  Sihe  town\u2019s  central \nheating network, the project will build a primary and secondary heat transmission \nnetwork extending for 31.7 km and 12 heat-exchange stations, increasing district \nheating coverage by 3 million m2. The heat source will be an existing combined heat \nand power plant. \n(iii)  Environmentally sustainable urban infrastructure development. The project will \nimprove  urban  road  links  and  related  facilities  in  six  key  townships  in  central \nLiaoning by rehabilitating and upgrading 73.4 km of urban roads; constructing 51.2 \nkm of urban roads; constructing 18 bridges; and developing related services such as \n187.2 km of storm-water pipelines and sewers, energy-saving lighting, public green \nareas, road-safety features, public transportation support, and NMT lanes. \n(iv)  Capacity development and institutional strengthening. The project will support \n(a) the Liaoning project management office (LPMO)15 and implementing agencies to \nensure efficient and effective project implementation in compliance with PRC and \nADB  requirements,  introduce  credit  appraisal and  credit-rating  approaches,  and \nidentify alternative financing options; (b) a leadership-enhancement program for \n                                                \n13 Notably ADB. 2009.

The following \nprinciples were followed in determining the amount of taxes and duties to be financed by ADB: (i) The amount does not \nrepresent an excessive share of the project investment plan. (ii) Taxes and duties apply only to ADB-financed \nexpenditures. (iii) The financing of the taxes and duties is material and relevant to the success of the project. \nb In December 2011 prices. \nc  Physical contingencies are computed at 10% of base costs except those for land acquisition and resettlement and for \nproject management. Price contingencies are computed at an average of 0.3% on foreign exchange costs and an \naverage of 3.8% on local currency costs, and they include provision for potential exchange rate fluctuation under the \nassumption of a purchasing power parity exchange rate. \nd  Includes interest and commitment charges. Interest during construction for the ADB loan has been computed at the 5-\nyear forward London interbank offered rate plus a spread of 0.40% and a maturity premium of 0.10%. Commitment \ncharges for the ADB loan are 0.15% per year to be charged on the undisbursed loan amount.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n13.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $150  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 26-year term, including a 5-year grace \nperiod,  straight-line  repayment,  an  annual  interest rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility,16 a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nyear, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. Based \non this, the average loan maturity is 15.75 years, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% \nper annum. The loan will finance 38% of the project cost, including civil works, equipment and \nmaterials, and institutional strengthening and training. The loan will also finance taxes and duties \nfor eligible ADB-financed expenditures, bank charges, and transportation and insurance costs. The \ngovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-\nbased lending facility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these \nchoices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or \nadvice from ADB. The government will finance $245.35 million, or 62% of the project cost.

Urban \ntransport subcomponents incorporate a people-centric design concept with special emphasis on \npedestrian and bicycle traffic planning and facilities, public transportation, and pedestrian safety. A \ndetailed description of components is in the PAM. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n18.  Economic analysis. The economic analysis evaluated technical options and confirmed \nthat the project components are the least-cost options that support central Liaoning\u2019s long-term \ndevelopment plans. Economic internal rates of return were computed at 19.6% for the district \nheating component and 18.6% for the urban infrastructure development components, all of which \nexceed the economic opportunity cost of capital of 12.0%. The results are robust under the normal \nrange of sensitivity analyses. Economic costs include (i) capital costs such as land acquisition and \nresettlement, and environmental mitigation; (ii) project management and institutional strengthening; \n(iii) physical contingencies; and (iv)  operation and maintenance. Economic benefits include (i) \nenergy efficiency savings through reduced coal consumption, (ii) lower environmental costs from \nreduced pollutant emissions, and (iii) incremental economic benefits computed as the difference \nbetween the centralized district heating system proposed for the project and the existing small \nheating  boilers,  (iv) savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs,  (v)  time  savings,  (vi)  accident  cost \nreductions, and (vii) savings in fuel cost. Not readily quantifiable benefits such as better health and \nincreased employment were not included.19 \n \n19.  Financial  analysis. Financial cost\u2013benefit analyses of revenue-generating components \nconfirmed financial viability by concluding that the components\u2019 financial internal rates of return\u2014\n4.4% for the wastewater management component and 13.1% for the district heating component\u2014\nexceeded the respective weighted average costs of capital of 2.4% and 2.8%. Wastewater tariffs \ncurrently equal 0.18%\u20130.27% of an average household\u2019s income, and heating tariffs currently \nequal 1.8%\u20132.3% of an average household\u2019s income and, after the government subsidy, 1.0%\u2013\n1.1% of a poor household\u2019s income.20 The subsidies for the poor will be maintained. These tariffs \nare  considered  acceptable  in  view  of  better  services  and  related  health  benefits.  Moreover, \naffordability is expected to improve as household incomes increase more quickly than tariffs. As \nsensitivity and risk analysis revealed that the revenue-earning components\u2019 financial internal rates \n                                                \n18Project  beneficiaries  include  an  estimated  810,000  current  residents  and  730,000  future  residents.  Current \nbeneficiaries include an estimated 160,000 rural residents and 650,000 urban residents, of whom 64,000, or 9.9%, are \npoor. Wastewater management will benefit 60,000 people, district heating 40,000 people, and urban roads 1,443,000 \npeople. There will be 60,000 common beneficiaries of wastewater treatment and roads. \n19 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Minimum living standard security program recipients (i.e., poor households) are eligible for an annual heating subsidy \n(tariff of CNY5 for up to 14 m2 per person, while the standard tariff is CNY26 per m2), which is paid by the Fuxin \nmunicipal government. Pre-subsidy heating tariffs equal 3.5% of a poor household\u2019s annual income. \n ", "7 \nof return are most sensitive to changes in revenues (which come mainly from tariffs) and operating \ncosts, maintaining tariffs and controlling costs will be crucial to ensuring the components\u2019 financial \nviability.  \n \n20.  A financial analysis of the revenue-earning companies, namely the Fuxin City Heating \nPower  Corporation  and  the  Shenbei  Shenyang Water Works  Company  (SSWWC),  evaluated \nexisting tariff and cost-recovery arrangements and concluded that tariffs should be increased \ngradually  to  achieve  full  cost  recovery.  Financial  projections  showed  that  in  the first  year of \noperation, SSWWC will incur financial deficits with operating losses of CNY5.09 million. During this \nperiod of shortfall, township governments will provide subsidies to ensure the continued provision \nof wastewater services. SSWWC\u2019s financial status will improve as tariffs increase. Projections \nshowed that SSWWC\u2019s debt-service-coverage ratio is projected to improve to 1.1 by 2019, while \nthat of Fuxin City Heating Power Corporation will be 1.2 by 2015.  \n \n21.  Fiscal analysis revealed that participating townships have the funds necessary to finance \nequity, operation, and maintenance of the completed facilities and debt servicing. Projections of \naverage annual counterpart funding requirements for participating townships ranged from 0.20% to \n1.60% of projected revenues during implementation, and projections of annual debt service ranged \nfrom 0.01% to 0.10% of projected annual revenues in 2018.21 \n \nC.  Governance \n22.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Liaoning  provincial  government,  LPMO,  and  implementing  agencies.  A  financial \nmanagement assessment concluded that, while the LPMO and most of the implementing agencies \nhave  experience  in  managing  foreign-financed  projects,  including  ADB-financed  projects, \nsignificant training and support provided through the capacity-development component will be \nrequired  on  ADB  policies  and  procedures  including  procurement,  disbursement,  and  project \nmanagement. Specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the \nPAM, including providing support and training on ADB policies and procedures, and engaging a \ntendering agent to strengthen procurement (footnote 17).  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n23.  Poverty and social benefits. Liaoning Province\u2019s economic growth in recent decades has \nbeen slower than that of other provinces because of resource depletion and an economic transition \nfrom mostly heavy industry to light industry and services. Consequently, urban unemployment \nrates in central Liaoning cities have remained at over 4%. Moreover, official poverty rates for the \nurban poor22 in resource-depleted cities are high (e.g., 18.5% in Fuxin, 16.5% in Tieling, and \n10.2% in Fushun in 2009) compared with the national average of about 4% in 2010.23 \n \n24.  A poverty and social assessment that included a household survey, community and focus \ngroup discussions, and key informant interviews was conducted during project preparation. By \nimproving living conditions, public health standards, and the urban environment, the project will by \n2020 directly benefit 1.54 million urban residents, of whom 0.81 million currently live in participating \ntownships and 0.73 million are future residents, including rural migrants. Among the current 0.81 \nmillion  beneficiaries,  75.3%  are  urban  residents  and  24.7%  rural.  Some  9.9%  of  the  urban \nresidents and 4.7% of the rural residents received support in 2010 from minimum living standard \n                                                \n21 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Defined as those under the minimum living standard security program.  \n23 According to a study conducted by the Academy of Social Sciences of China using data from the Ministry of Civil \nAffairs (http://finance.hsw.cn/system/2011/08/04/051063127.shtml). \n ", "8 \nsecurity programs;24 18.3% are ethnic minority people of Manchu, Xibo, Chaoxian, Hui, and other \nnationality; and 49.1% are females. The project will create 25,000 person-months of jobs for \nunskilled laborers during construction, and 160 direct jobs and 840 indirect jobs during operations. \nEmployment targets for vulnerable groups and women are included in the design and monitoring \nframework, gender action plan (GAP), social development action plan, and loan assurances. Air \nand water quality and traffic improvements through the provision of wastewater management and \ndistrict heating services, development of the urban road network and improvements in NMT, and \nroad safety and transport planning will enhance public health and safety. Improving the urban road \nand bridge network will boost public access and mobility and reduce time burdens. The heating \ncomponent will improve air quality and district heating access. The closure of 15 small heating \nboilers will not cause job losses. The GAP and social development action plan will be implemented \nby  the  LPMO  and  implementing  agencies  during  project  construction.  The  leadership-\nenhancement  program  for  senior  officials  will  enhance  capacity  for  socially  inclusive  urban \nplanning. \n \n25.  Gender benefits. The project has been designed for classification as effective gender \nmainstreaming, and a GAP has been prepared and activities and indicators agreed. Survey results \nand focus group discussions indicate that, in addition to their employment, women in the project-\ninfluenced area are primarily responsible for housekeeping and caring for the sick and the elderly. \nImproved  sanitation  through  wastewater  management  will  enable  women  and  children  to  be \nhealthier and more productive. Meanwhile, more efficient heating systems will ease the time and \ncost  burdens  of  respiratory  illnesses.  This  is  particularly  significant  as  women  are  largely \nresponsible for managing household budgets. Improving the urban transport network and including \nwomen\u2019s needs in the planning of public transport routes, pedestrian and NMT access, and road \nsafety programs will reduce time burdens and increase access, mobility, and safety. The GAP \nincludes  specific  targets  for  women  in  employment,  participation,  and  capacity-building \nopportunities, and is supported by loan assurances and consultant support for implementation and \nmonitoring. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n26.  Environment.  The  project  is  environment  category  A.  An  environmental  impact \nassessment including an environment management plan was prepared in compliance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009) and was posted on the ADB website and circulated to ADB\u2019s \nBoard of Directors on 21 May 2012. Major environmental impacts and risks include soil erosion \nand  the  sedimentation  of  watercourses  during  road  and  bridge  construction,  as  well  as \noccupational and community health and safety risks at construction sites. Impacts during operation \ninclude traffic noise and the risk of surface water pollution if the WWTP malfunctions. Mitigation \nmeasures  defined  in  the  environment  management  plan  will  reduce  adverse  environmental \nimpacts to acceptable levels. During construction, the focus will be on protecting surface water \nquality, occupational and community health and safety, and adequate disposal of construction \nwaste. During operation, special attention will be paid to traffic noise, the operation of wastewater \nand  sewage  sludge  treatment  in  compliance  with  relevant  standards,  and  the  occupational \nhealthiness and safety of project facilities in compliance with worker safety laws and regulations. \nThe  project\u2019s  environmental  performance  will  be  monitored  during  project  construction  and \noperation and verified by external experts. The borrower is committed to managing identified \nenvironmental risks and has agreed to a comprehensive set of environment-related loan covenants \nand a 4-year training program from 2013 to 2017 with a strong focus on environment safeguards. \n                                                \n24 The standards for classifying the urban poor in subproject areas are CNY225\u2013CNY285 per person per month in 2009 \nand CNY250\u2013CNY310 in 2010. The standards for rural people in subproject areas are CNY1,250\u2013CNY1,600 per \nperson per year in 2009 and CNY1,300\u2013CNY2,600 in 2010.  \n ", "9 \nThe executing agency disclosed environment information to affected people, and the results and \nfindings from consultation were used to modify the environmental impact assessment and project \ndesign. Consultation and public participation will continue throughout project implementation, and \nany environmental complaints or disputes will be handled in accordance with the grievance-redress \nmechanism established for the project.  \n \n27.  The  project  will  have  substantial  environmental  benefits.  Improved  and  extended  road \nsystems will reduce traffic congestion and improve road safety by rationalizing the interaction of \npedestrians, NMT, and motorized traffic. Improved wastewater collection and treatment will leave a \ncleaner and healthier living environment for town residents and reduce the contamination of rivers \nand waterways. Savings in carbon dioxide emissions will accrue from the rationalization of urban \nroad transport and road connectivity, as well as from the modernization of central heating.  \n \n28.  Resettlement.  The  project  is  resettlement  category  A,  as  construction  will  require \nsignificant land acquisition and resettlement. In total, the project will affect 12 neighborhoods in 6 \nsubdistricts and 19 villages in 6 townships. A total of 1,208 mu of land will be permanently \nacquired, comprising 1,057 mu of village collective land and 151 mu of state-owned land.25 Land \nloss is mainly to construct roads, WWTPs, and pumping stations. The acquisition of 807 mu of \nfarmland will affect 500 rural households with 1,770 members, including 59 households whose \nhouses will be demolished. A total of 100,263 m2 of rural and urban houses will be demolished, \nadversely affecting 326 rural and 309 urban households with 2,229 members. In total, 1,076 \nhouseholds  with  3,762  members,  and  29 small  enterprises  and  shops  with  339  staffers  and \nemployees, will be affected. \n \n29.  Affected people will benefit from the project through improved air quality and transport \naccess. The LPMO and implementing agencies will be responsible for planning, implementing, \nfinancing, and reporting on land acquisition and resettlement. Six draft resettlement plans and a \ndue diligence report have been prepared for the project, endorsed by the executing agency and \nimplementing agencies, disclosed to affected people, and uploaded to ADB\u2019s website. During \nproject implementation, the resettlement plans will be finalized based on the final design and \ndetailed measurement survey, disclosed to affected people in their local language, and submitted \nto ADB for review and approval, before any civil works contracts are awarded. A grievance-redress \nprocedure has been established for affected people. The LPMO will submit a semiannual internal \nmonitoring report to ADB on the progress of resettlement. The LPMO will employ an external \nmonitoring  institute  or  firm  that  will  submit  semiannual  monitoring  reports  to  ADB  during \nresettlement implementation and annually for 2 years after resettlement completion. \n \n30.  Indigenous peoples. The project is indigenous peoples category C. Ethnic minorities make \nup 18.3% of the population in project townships, but the poverty and social assessment revealed \nthat they live as socially and economically integrated residents in urban areas. These groups are \nnot vulnerable, and the only adverse impact is land acquisition and house demolition, which has \nbeen addressed by resettlement plans. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.26 The project has no unusual technical risks, but \nimplementation arrangements are complicated by their multiple components, in response to which \n                                                \n25 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 m2).  \n26 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nproject  oversight  and  coordination  mechanisms  have  been  carefully  designed.  The  project\u2019s \nintegrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh costs and risks.  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nDelayed land acquisition  (i) Prompt implementation of detailed measurement surveys and \napproval and implementation  finalization of resettlement plans \n(ii) Early availability of compensation funding for affected people \n(iii) Strict operational compliance with resettlement plans \nDelayed project coordination  (i) Coordination support from project implementation consultants \nand synchronization among  (ii) Close project monitoring, frequent site inspections, and regular \nagencies  coordination meetings \nLack of sustainable O&M of  (i) Long-term capacity building at the wastewater and heating \ninfrastructure components  companies and implementation of road maintenance improvements \n(ii) Assurances regarding budget provisions for O&M \nDifficulties in complying with  Early mobilization of tendering agent and implementation consultants to \nADB procedures  provide technical support, combined with ongoing training \nADB = Asian Development Bank, O&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: ADB. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n32.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, \nprocurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  the  project \nadministration manual and loan documents. The government has agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the proposed project, which are set forth in the loan and project agreements. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n33.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $150,000,000 \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Integrated Development of Key Townships in Central \nLiaoning, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  for  a  term  of  26  years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n4 September 2012 \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and   \nDesign  Performance Targets and Indicators  Reporting  Assumptions and \nSummary  with Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact       \n \nMore competitive,  By 2020 (baseline year 2011), the   \n \ngreen, and  participating key townships in central    Assumption \n \ninclusive  Liaoning are  The Shenyang \n \nurbanization in  (i)   more competitive, with an average  Economic Zone Master \nStatistics published \nkey townships in  annual per capita disposable income  annually by LPSO  Plan accelerates \ncentral Liaoning  for urban households increased by  socioeconomic gains in \n \n   140% from CNY20,467;  central Liaoning. \nStatistics published by \n(ii)  more green, as the number of days   \nthe Liaoning \nwith air quality meeting or exceeding   \nEnvironment  Risk \ngrade 2 quality increased from 265 to \nProtection  Development pressures \n300 per year; and \nDepartment  outpace planned \n(iii) more inclusive, as unemployment \n  infrastructure \nreduced by 0.5 percentage points \nStatistics published  developments. \nfrom 5.5% and is maintained at no \nannually by LPSO \nmore than 5%. \n \n \nOutcome  By 2018 (baseline year 2011), in the     \nImproved  participating key townships in central    Assumptions \nsanitation,  Liaoning    Government \nheating, and  (i)   the wastewater collection rate  Liaoning Province  commitment and \ntransport services  increased on average from 43% to  environment statistics  support for \nin key townships  83%;  annual report  infrastructure \nin central  (ii)  wastewater treatment capacity    development continues. \nLiaoning  increased from 5,000 m3/day to  PCC issued by the   \n10,000 m3/day;   Liaoning HURCC  Project facilities are \nproperly operated and \n(iii)  heating-related carbon dioxide   \nmaintained. \nemissions reduced by 53,690 tons per PCC issued by the \n \nannum in Fuxin;  Fuxin HURCC   \nRisks \n(iv) district heating coverage increased in   \nActual economic growth \nFuxin from 18.9 million m2 to 21.9  PCC issued by the \nand population \nmillion m2;  Fuxin HURCC \nincreases turn out to be \n(v)  road network density increased on   \nfar from estimates. \naverage from 393.5 km to 460.2 km of PCC issued by the \n \nroad per 100 km2 of land area;  Liaoning HURCC  Actual sanitation, \n(vi) the operational length of bus lines    heating, and transport \nincreased from 391 km to 563 km;  PCC issued by the  demand turns out to be \n(vii) traffic fatality rates for every 10,000  Liaoning HURCC  far from estimates.  \nvehicles decreased by 15% on  Statistics issued by   \naverage from 4.26 to 3.62;a and  Public Security  Costs are much higher \n(viii) 2,520 jobs are created during project  Bureau   than foreseen. \nimplementation, and 161 jobs during   \noperation, with 20% targeted for  PCC issued by the \nwomen and 15% for the poor.
