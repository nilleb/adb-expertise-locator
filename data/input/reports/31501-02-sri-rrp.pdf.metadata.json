The  revised  and  updated \nsummary IEE (SIEE) is in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \nThe  supplementary  loans  for  the  Secondary  Towns  and  Rural \nCommunity-Based  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Project  support \nthe  objectives  and  scope  of  the  original  project.  As  such,  the \nsupplementary loans aim to contribute to poverty reduction efforts \nby  increasing  access  to  safe  water  and  sanitation  of  the  poor, \nthereby  improving  their  living  conditions,  especially  those  of \nwomen.  Within  this  framework,  the  following  challenges  continue \nthe \nthe  Project: \nto  be  addressed \nreconstruction  efforts  by  providing  piped  water  to  major  urban \ncenters  in  the  northeast  of  the  country;  (ii)  supporting  the \ndevolution  of  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  to  the  provincial \ncouncils  and  Pradeshiya  Sabhas  (PSs);  and  (iii)  supporting  the \nsector  reforms  identified  in  previous  interventions,  including \nachievement  of  cost  recovery  (operation  and  maintenance,  debt \nservice  and  depreciation),  independent  regulation  of  the  water \nsector,  and  increased  community-based  participation  in  the \nsector. The Project will provide water in two major urban areas in \nthe  North-East  Province  (Batticaloa  and  Muttur),  one  urban  area \nin the North Central Province (Polonnaruwa), and one urban area \nin  the  Southern  Province  (Hambantota).  The  Project  is  also \nimplementing  a  rural  water  supply  program  in  the  North  Central \nand North-East Province through community-based organizations \n(CBOs),  local  government,  and  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs),  and  supports  the  National  Water  Supply  and  Drainage \nBoard  (NWSDB)  to  advance  and  adapt  to  the  ongoing  sector \nreforms  by  improving  its  operational  efficiency  and  financial \nmanagement.   \n \nProvision  of  safe  drinking  water  through  construction  of  new \nschemes  and  augmentation  of  existing  ones  represents  a  major \nmilestone  in  the  Government\u2019s  New  Development  Strategy,  and \ntherefore  a  priority  for  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka.  The  Project \ncontinues  to  be  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  in \n(i) promoting  regionally  balanced  development,  (ii)  rehabilitating \n\n(i)  contributing \n\nto \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan \n\n(iv)  ongoing  activities \n\ninstitutional  assessments,  and  economic  and \n\nand  reconstructing  the  conflict-affected  areas,  and  (iii)  reducing \npoverty and ensuring equitable development. The supplementary \nloans  will  assist  the  Government  in  delivering  the  originally \ndefined  objectives.  People \nin  project  areas  are  vulnerable \nresulting  from  years  of  conflict  and  impacts  resulting  from  the \n2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.     \n \nThe  Project  has  suffered  a  cost  overrun  because  of  price \nescalation  factors,  initial  undercosting  and  detailed  engineering \ndesign modifications. Rationale for supplementary loans includes: \n(i) alignment  with  the  priorities  of  the  Government  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB); (ii) physical changes within the original \nscope, have been assessed along with their impacts in the context \nof  current  ADB  policies;  (iii)  the  revised  Project  is  technically \nfeasible, institutionally sound, economically viable, and financially \nsustainable; \n(including  construction \npackages) and those modified have been reviewed for safeguards \ncompliance and shown to be sound; and (v) all steps in the matrix \nof due diligence have been observed (including technical, capacity \nand \nfinancial \nanalyses of the revised Project). \n \nThe  overall  goal  of  the  Project  continues  to  be  contributing  to \npoverty  reduction  efforts  and  promoting  human  development  by \nfor  poor \nimproving  access \npopulations, \nthereby  decreasing  waterborne  diseases  and \nreducing  the  amount  of  resources  spent  in  these  activities.  The \nProject objectives are to: (i) provide safe water to 946,000 people \nand sanitation to 171,500 in four urban areas, and in rural areas of \nthe  North  Central  and  North-East  provinces;  and  (ii) increase  the \ncapacity  of \nto  provide  safe  water  by \nstrengthening the water sector institutions. \n \nThe  revised  project  components  are:  (i)  provision  of  urban  water \nsupply,  sanitation,  and  drainage  in  the  towns  of  Batticaloa, \nHambantota, Muttur, and Polonnaruwa; (ii) provision of rural water \nsupply  and  sanitation  in  the  districts  of  Anuradhapura  and \nPolonnaruwa in the North Central Province, and Batticaloa in the \nNorth-East  Province;  and  (iii)  institutional  strengthening  focusing \non  training,  public  awareness  campaigns,  and  improvement  of \noperational  and  financial  management  of  the  NWSDB.  Marginal \ndifferences  with  the  original  scope  include  an  additional  rural \nwater  supply  subcomponent  in  Batticaloa  and  eliminating  the \nconstruction of Matara\u2019s salinity barrier. \n \nThe revised total cost of the Project is estimated at $175.2 million \nequivalent,  including  taxes,  duties,  interest  charges  on  the  ADB \nloans,  and  physical  and  price  contingencies.  The  supplementary \nloans are proposed to amount to $60 million equivalent.  \n \n \n\nto  safe  water  and  sanitation \n\nthe  Government \n\n\f \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\niii\n\nThe  project  cost  increase  is  $80.8  million,  whereas  the  financing \ngap is estimated to be $88.8 million or approximately 100% of the \noriginal project cost. Factors and reasons leading to cost overrun \nin  the  Project  include:  (i)  price  increases  (about  36%  of  the  cost \noverrun), (ii) cost underestimation at appraisal (about 24% of the \ncost  overrun),  (iii) physical  changes  during  detailed  engineering \ndesign  (about  21%  of  the  cost  overrun),  and  (iv) underestimation \nand  increases  in  government  taxes  and  duties  for  goods  and \nservices (about 19% of the cost overrun).  \n \nA  loan  of  $60.3  million  equivalent  was  originally  allocated  from \nADB\u2019s Special Fund resources (ADF). In addition, supplementary \nloans amounting to $46.5 million equivalent will be provided from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (ADF)  and  $13.5 million  will  be \nprovided  from  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR).  ADF  resources \nfor supplementary loans will be provided from a variety of sources \nwhich include: (i) the reallocation of the equivalent of $18.5 million \nin ADF resources from unutilized loan proceeds of closed loans to \nthe  Government  of  Sri  Lanka,  and  (ii) a  new  ADF  allocation  of \n$28.0 million  equivalent.  The  Government  will  provide  a  total  of \nthe  community  $3.0  million \n$51.8  million  equivalent  and \nequivalent. \n \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  The  ADF  loan  will  have  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  8  years,  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1%  per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter. \nThe OCR loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period \nof 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility, \nconversion  options \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  conversion \nguidelines, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such \nother  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements. It is proposed that new loan and project agreements \nbe prepared for (i) ADF loan, and (ii) the OCR loan. \n \nThe  Government  will  make  loan  proceeds  available  to  NWSDB \nthrough new subsidiary financing agreements acceptable to ADB. \nThe ratio of grant and loan is expected to be determined based on \nthe urban and rural population ratio in the project areas. Based on \nthe subsidiary financing agreement signed between NWSDB and \nthe Government for the Secondary Towns and Rural Community-\nBased Water Supply and Sanitation Project, (i) 85% of funding for \nwater  supply  schemes  in  PSs  will  be  made  available  to  NWSDB \nas a grant and 15% as a loan; (ii) for urban councils and municipal \ncouncils, 50% of funding will be provided as a grant and 50% as a \nloan;  and  (iii)  for  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  systems \nimplemented by communities, 100% of funding will be provided as \na grant. The subsidiary loan from the Government to NWSDB will \nhave  an  interest  rate  of  10%  with  a  24-year  term,  including  a  5-\nyear grace period. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nPeriod of Utilization \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n30 June 2010 \n31 December 2009 \n\n \nIt is proposed that, as for the original project, NWSDB, under the \nMinistry  of  Urban  Development  and  Water  Supply  (MUDWS),  be \nthe Executing Agency for the supplementary loans.  \n \nImplementation  structures  under  the  original  project  will  be \ncharged  with  the  implementation  of  supplementary  loans.  These \nconsist  of  (i)  a  project  management  unit  (PMU),  established  in \nColombo  under  NWSDB,  (ii)  five  project  implementation  units \n(PIUs),  (iii)  eight  (and  in  future  six  additional  units  to  support \nbatch 2) PS implementation units (PSIUs), and (iv) four technical \nsupport  units  (TSUs).  Policy  and  strategic  decisions  and  PMU \nguidance  will  be  provided  by  the  existing  national  steering \ncommittee chaired by the secretary of MUDWS, and coordination \nfor  the  rural  PSIUs  continue  to  be  provided  by  the  project \nprovincial coordinating committee established in the North Central \nand  North-East  provincial  councils.  Where  necessary,  additional \ncommittees  will  be \ncoordinating \ncomplementary  project \nestablished  at  the  district,  divisional,  and  village  levels.  Despite \nincreasing concerns over the deterioration of the security situation \nin the north and east of the country, implementation is, in general, \nlargely  undisrupted,  as  most \nprogressing  effectively  and \nconstruction activities are in government cleared areas. \n \nGoods  and  services  financed  by  ADB  supplementary  loans  will \ncontinue  to  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Procurement \nGuidelines,  as  amended  from  time  to  time.  Urban  water  supply \nschemes will be built according to procurement packages agreed \nby  the  Inception  Mission  for  the  Secondary  Towns  and  Rural \nCommunity-Based  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Project,  which \ninclude  design-and-build  contracts  and  supply-and-lay  packages \nfor \n(ICB)  and  national \ncompetitive  bidding  (NCB).  As  for  the  original  project,  civil  work \ncontracts  valued  over  $2.5  million  equivalent  and  equipment \ncontracts  valued  over  $500,000  equivalent  will  be  undertaken \nthrough  ICB  procedures.  Civil  works  contracts  valued  at  $2.5 \nmillion  equivalent  or \nless  will  be  carried  out  under  NCB \nprocedures.  Equipment  packages  valued  at  $500,000  equivalent \nor \nfollowing  NCB  procedures.  All \nconstruction works for the rural component are still expected to be \nvalued  at  less  than  $1  million  equivalent  and  therefore  to  be \nprocured through NCB, or, in the case of contracts valued at less \nthan SLRs5 million (approximately $50,000 equivalent), by CBOs \nthrough  procedures  for  community  participation  in  procurement \nacceptable to ADB. \n \nIn  addition  to  consulting  services  provided  under  the  Secondary \nTowns and Rural Community-Based Water Supply and Sanitation \n\ninternational  competitive  bidding \n\nless  will  be  procured \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nsites \n\nsimultaneously.  The \n\nProject, it is envisaged that an additional 1,500 person-months of \nlocal  supervisory  staff  inputs  will  be  required  to  supervise  the \ncontractors'  work \nadditional \nrequirements  are  based  on  organizational  needs  for  adequate \nsupervision  of  all  contracts,  including  4  design-and-build  type \ncontracts and the 12 bill-of-quantity type contracts. The proposed \nadditional  consultant  inputs  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2006),  through  the \nsingle  source  selection  method  with  the  firm  already  selected  for \npackage  B  of  the  Project,  as  proposed  tasks  represent  a  natural \ncontinuation  of  previous  work.  The  firm  will  be  requested  to \nprovide a biodata technical proposal for review and negotiation by \nreference  and  qualification \nNWSDB  and  ADB.  Terms  of \nrequirements for consultants will follow the original contract. \n \nThe  number  of  direct  project  beneficiaries  remains \nlargely \nunchanged, at around 946,000 people, who will profit from a rise \nin  standard  of  living  based  on  the  provision  of  basic  needs.  Of \nthese,  575,500  people  in  urban  areas  will  gain  access  to  piped \nwater supplies and 370,500 people in rural areas will gain access \nto  improved  safe  sources  of  water.  As  envisaged  under  the \noriginal  project  design,  after  project  completion,  171,500  people \nwill have access to improved sanitation and better understanding \nof  hygiene  in  four  urban  areas  and  three  rural  districts.  The \nproposed sanitation and sewerage improvements will significantly \nreduce  pollution  in  the  project  towns  and  their  immediate \nsurroundings,  and  will  provide  a  proven  mechanism  for  easy \nreplication. \n \nThe  main  benefits  of  the  Project  remain  (i)  improved  health; \n(ii) less  resources  (time  and  cash)  spent  by  households  in  water \nprovision,  especially  by  women  and  young  girls;  and  (iii)  support \nto  environmentally  sustainable  economic  and  population  growth, \nespecially  in  the  urban  centers.  By  reducing  child  mortality  and \nmalnutrition  caused  by  waterborne  diseases,  and  increasing \nenvironmental  sustainability  through  a  reduction  of  groundwater \noverextraction and unsafe sanitation practices, the Project directly \naddresses ADB\u2019s goal of poverty reduction and contributes to the \nachievement  of \nthe  Millennium  Development  Goals.  Poor \nhouseholds are encouraged to participate as project beneficiaries. \n \nThe  Project  will  translate  into  visible  improvements  to  the  living \nconditions  of  the  civilian  population,  which  has  suffered  decades \nof  civil  unrest.  It  will  also  continue  to  support  the  reconciliation \nprocess. Commitment and cooperation for project implementation \nby both sides in the conflict in the North-East Province support the \nframework and platform to sustain peace building.  \n \nThe Project continues to assume (i) a stable political environment \nand  positive  economic  growth  in  Sri  Lanka;  (ii)  continuing \ntimely \ngovernment  support \nthe  Project, \nthe \nto \nprocurement  and  availability  of \n\nform  of \nthe \nfunds,  and  support \n\nto \n\nin \n\n \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n \n\ndecentralization  process;  and  (iii)  independent  regulation  of  the \nwater  sector  and  the  improved  efficiency  of  water  service \nprovision. Especially, it is assumed that tariff setting will be driven \nby  financial  considerations  and  that  it  will  be  independent  of \npolitical  influence,  to  achieve  adequate  levels  of  project  cost \nrecovery  and  proper  asset  management.  In  addition,  the  Project \nassumes \nthat  contractor  collusion  will  be  prevented  and \ncompetition encouraged. \n \nReduced  political  support  for  sector  reforms  would  impede  the \nimplementation  of  the  strategies  to  improve  the  operational  and \nfinancial  efficiency  of  NWSDB  and  other  service  providers.  Data \nmonitoring under Component 3 during project reviews will provide \nthe  necessary  diagnosis \nthe \nGovernment. \n \nWhile commitment to providing safe water and sanitation remains \na  priority  to  all  parties,  there  is  a  risk  that  deterioration  of  the \nsecurity  situation  may  delay  project  implementation  in  Batticaloa \nand  Muttur.  Safety  and  effectiveness  will  remain  ADB\u2019s  main \nconcern  during  the  remainder  of  project  implementation.  ADB, \ninformed  by  (i)  internal  security  and  United  Nations  security \nbriefings,  and  (ii)  PMU  weekly  updates,  will  closely  monitor  the \nsecurity situation and carefully guide implementation accordingly. \nDialogue will be continued with partners and project beneficiaries, \nwhich will enable a prognosis in project areas and guide decision \nmaking.     \n \n\nfor

\n\n1\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  two  proposed \nsupplementary loans, both to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, for the Secondary \nTowns and Rural Community-Based Water Supply and Sanitation Project. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE APPROVED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nThe Context \n\nIn  February  2002  a  ceasefire  agreement  was  signed  in  Sri  Lanka,  beginning  the  long \n2. \nprocess of negotiating a permanent end to a conflict which had affected the country for over 20 \nyears. Processed against this background, the Secondary Towns and Rural Community-Based \nWater Supply and Sanitation Project1 presented a balanced investment proposal whereby much \nneeded  water  infrastructure  (a  key  element  for  convergence)  was  to  be  provided  to  deprived \ntowns  in  both  the  east  and  south  of  the  country.  Furthermore,  in  December  2004,  the  Indian \nOcean tsunami impacted coastal areas of the Southern and North-East provinces, significantly \naffecting  towns  supported  under  the  Project.  Despite  varying  levels  of  dialogue  experienced \nsince  the  approval  of  the  Project  and  a  decline  in  the  security  situation  over  the  past  few \nmonths,  the  provision  of  safe  drinking  water  and  adequate  sanitation  systems  to  poor \nhouseholds remains one of the highest priorities for all stakeholders. \n \nB. \n\nProject Rationale \n\n3. \nNotwithstanding a significant increase in the population percentage with access to safe \nwater sources, from 68% in 1994 to 77% in 2000,2 only about 30% has a household connection \nto a piped system while 10% of the population is covered by hand pump tube wells.3 Similarly, \nurban population with access to improved sanitation increased from 89% to 98% from 1990 to \n2002 while rural coverage rose from 64% to 89%. Overall, 80% of the population has access to \non-site  sanitation  facilities  but  wastewater  collection  and  disposal  systems  are  not  widely \navailable.4 Although  groundwater  quality  in  most  parts  of  the  country  is  of  reasonable  quality, \nbiological contamination, high levels of fluoride and salinity intrusion in wells and water intakes \nare  common  problems.  Urban  growth  has  increased  pressure  on  scarce  water  resources, \nstressing  the  need  to  expedite  provision  of  piped  water  supply.  Towns  such  as  Batticaloa, \nHambantota, and Muttur are located in water scarce areas where water quantity is limited and \nquality frequently does not meet required standards. At the time of appraisal (September 2002), \nmore than 40% of households had incomes below the poverty line in Polonnaruwa, Batticaloa, \nand  Muttur;  in  Hambantota,  approximately  25%  of  households  were  poor.  Poverty  and  lack  of \naccess to services were found to be highly correlated among sample populations in all project \ntowns. In Hambantota, 45% of households had access to piped water, but this figure was as low \nas  19%  for  Polonnaruwa,  4%  for  Batticaloa,  and  0%  for  Muttur.  The  incidence  of  water  and \nsanitation  related  diseases  were  found  to  be  highest  among  populations  where  a  higher \npercentage  of  households  lacked  private  sanitation  facilities.  The  incidence  of  water-related \ndiseases was found to be highest in Muttur, affecting almost 40% of surveyed households.5 \n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2003.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Secondary Towns and Rural  Community-Based Water Supply \nand Sanitation Project. Manila \n\n2   National Council for Economic Development, 2005 Millennium Development Goals. Country Report 2005.  \n3   National Water Supply and Drainage Board. 2004. Annual Report. Colombo.  \n4   Only  a  fraction  of  Colombo  currently  has  sewerage  facilities  while  Hikadduwa  and  Kandy  are  in  the  process  of \n\nintroducing related services. Regional disparities are also significant. \n\n5   Although present socioeconomic baselines will only be completed by the end 2006, the tsunami is believed to have \n\nsignificantly worsened reported conditions in the towns of Batticaloa, Hambantota, and Muttur.  \n\n \n\n\f 2 \n\nThe National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB), responsible to the Ministry of \n4. \nUrban Development and Water Supply (MUDWS), is the primary agency responsible for water \nsupply  (covering  75%  of  over  500  piped  water  supply  systems).  Local  authorities  and \ncommunity-based  organizations  (CBOs)  operate  and  maintain  the  remainder.  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has been a partner in Sri Lanka\u2019s water supply and sanitation sector, \nassisting  the  Government  for  20 years  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  four  successive \nloans, and recently embarked on a project to support delivery of basic urban infrastructure and \nservices  for  local  authorities. 6 ADB  has  consistently  assisted  the  Government  in  improving \nsector policies, operational efficiency, and sustainability. 7  \n \nC. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n5. \nIn  March  2002,  the  Government  and  ADB  signed  a  poverty  reduction  partnership \nagreement,  highlighting  the  importance  of  access  to  safe  water  supply  and  sanitation  in \nreducing poverty in Sri Lanka. On 16 January 2003, ADB approved a loan equivalent to $60.3 \nmillion  from  ADB's  Special  Funds  resources  for  the  Secondary  Towns  and  Rural  Community \nBased Water Supply and Sanitation Project (footnote 1). The loan was declared effective on 21 \nNovember 2003 and the project completion date set to be 30 September 2009. The goal of this \nProject  is  to  reduce  poverty  and  promote  human  development  by  reducing  the  incidence  of \nwaterborne  diseases  and  by  reducing  the  time  and  resources  that  households  spend  in \nacquiring water. Its objective is to provide safe drinking water and safe sanitation to people in \nproject  areas.  The  Project  will  increase  the  capacity  of  water  sector  institutions  to  operate, \nmaintain, augment existing water schemes and invest in new water schemes in rural and urban \nareas.  The  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  water  policy, 8  as  it  fosters  the  necessary \nimprovement and expansion of delivery services in Sri Lanka, promotes conservation of water, \nimproved operational and financial efficiency and governance. The Project aims to provide 24-\nhour supply in all four urban areas, and supports the Government\u2019s efforts in providing access \nto improved sanitation facilities for all through its urban and rural sanitation components. \n \n6. \nOutcome  and  Outputs. The Project was designed to improve the standard of living in \nrural areas of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts in the North Central Province; and in the \ntowns  of  Batticaloa  and  Muttur  in  the  North-East  Province,  Hambantota  and  Matara  in  the \nSouthern  Province,  and  Polonnaruwa  in  the  North  Central  Province.  The  Project  is  also \ndesigned to increase the financial and institutional sustainability of NWSDB and the institutional \ncapacity  of  provincial  councils,  Pradeshiya  Sabhas  (PSs),  and  CBOs  participating  in  the \nProject.  The  project  design,  as  originally  defined,  anticipates  accomplishment  of  three \ncomponents, related outputs and activities. \n \n7. \nComponent  1  (urban  component)  anticipates:  (i)  provision  of  new  piped  water  supply \nsystems and improved drainage in the towns of Batticaloa and Muttur, (ii) expansion of existing \nwater  supply  systems  in  the  towns  of  Polonnaruwa  and  Hambantota,  (iii)  construction  of  a \nsalinity  barrier  at  the  intake  in  Matara  to  prevent  saline  intrusion  during  dry  periods, \n(iv)  provision of wastewater collection and treatment for Batticaloa Hospital, (v) improvement of \ndrainage  schemes  in  the  most  densely  populated  areas  of  Batticaloa  and  Muttur,  and \n(vi) provision of a low-cost latrine program.  \n \n8. \nComponent 2 (rural component) is expected to provide: (i) organization of beneficiaries \ninto  CBOs;  (ii)  CBO  capacity  development  to  implement,  operate,  and  maintain  water  supply \n\n                                                 \n6   ADB.  2005.

Manila \n\n\fschemes and sanitation facilities; (iii) a community-based rural infrastructure program to provide \nwater; and (iv) a community-based rural sanitation infrastructure program. \n \n9. \nComponent 3 (institutional strengthening) will: (i) deliver a national public awareness and \neducation campaign; (ii) support the implementation of NWSDB\u2019s corporate strategy to improve \nfinancial  planning  and  resource  allocation;  (iii)  support  the  implementation  of  the  strategy  and \naction  plan  to  address  audit,  accounting,  and  financial  management  issues;  (iv) support  the \nimplementation  of  NWSDB\u2019s  action  plan  to  improve  operational  performance;  (v) provide  an \nasset  registry  for  regional  water  supply  schemes  with  more  than  10,000  connections;  and  (vi) \ntrain  NWSDB,  project  staff,  CBOs,  and  communities  for  improved  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M) and scheme management. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n10. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project\u2014including  physical  and  price  contingencies,  taxes,  and \nduties\u2014was originally estimated at $86.3 million equivalent. Tables 2 and 3 of the original report \nand recommendation of the President (RRP) for the project (footnote 1) summarize the original \ncost details and financing plan. ADB provided a loan of $60.3 million equivalent from its Special \nFunds  resources  with  a  maturity  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and \ninterest rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. It was \nestimated  that  the  ADB  loan  would  cover  approximately  70%  of  total  project  costs.  The \nGovernment was to provide $22.5 million equivalent (26.5% of total costs) and the community \nwas to provide $3.1 million equivalent (3.5% of total costs). The community contribution for the \nrural component was proposed to be 20% of the capital cost for each technical option. However, \nthe  initial  project  allocation  has  been  found  to  be  insufficient  to  achieve  the  proposed \ndevelopment objectives. \n \n11. \nThe  Government,  through  a  subsidiary  financing  agreement  acceptable  to  ADB,  made \nthe  proceeds  of  the  proposed  loan  available  to  NWSDB.  The  terms  of  this  agreement  were \ndefined  as  follows:  (i)  85%  of  funding  for  water  supply  schemes  in  PSs  is  made  available  to \nNWSDB as a grant and 15% as a loan; (ii) for urban and municipal councils, 50% of funding is \nprovided  as  a  grant  and  50%  as  a  loan;  and  (iii)  for  rural  communities,  100%  of  funding  is \nprovided  as  a  grant.  In  each  case,  loan  financing  was  made  available  at  the  rate  of  10%  per \nannum with a repayment period of 24 years and a grace period of 5 years. \n \nE. \n\nStatus of and Progress in Project Implementation \n\n12. \nProject  implementation  has  been  satisfactory  to  date.  Despite  some  delays  stemming \nfrom  initial  start-up  and  the  tsunami,  significant  advancement  has  been  achieved  since  loan \neffectiveness. This section reviews (i) component-based progress in project implementation, (ii) \nsafeguards  compliance,  and  (iii)  early  performance  in  achieving  benefits  and  impacts.  A \nsummary of subproject implementation for all three components is in Appendix 2. Compliance \nwith loan covenants is also adequate (Appendix 3). \n \n\n1. \n\nProject Implementation \n\nUrban  Component.  Topographical,  geotechnical,  and  inundation  surveys  have  been \n13. \ncompleted  in  all  four  towns.  Construction  of  offices  and  staff  quarters  has  been  completed  in \nHambantota,  Polonnaruwa,  and  Batticaloa.  Contracts  have  been  awarded  and  are  under \nconstruction for (i) strengthening and raising the bund for Unnichchai tank; (ii) supply and laying \nof  the  treated  water  transmission  main  from  Ambalantota  to  Mirijjawila;  (iii) Batticaloa  Hospital \nsewerage  and  sewage  treatment;  and  (iv) Hambantota  headworks,  treatment  plant,  and \ntransmission  pipeline.  Major  design-and-build  contract  packages  have  been  tendered  and  are \ncurrently  being  evaluated  for  headworks,  raw  water  mains,  and  a  water  treatment  plant  for \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\nBatticaloa  and  Muttur.  Civil  works  contract  packages  for  elevated  towers  and  distribution \nsystems are under tendering or evaluation and are due to be awarded soon. Implementation is \ngenerally progressing effectively and undisrupted as most construction activities are in cleared \nareas.  Safety  aspects  have  been  carefully  considered  throughout  the  entire  cycle  of  detailed \ndesign,  construction  and  commissioning  and  project  management  structures  maintain  a \ncontinuous dialogue with Government agencies, key stakeholders and contractors. Construction \nof  Matara\u2019s  salinity  barrier  has  been  halted  as  a  result  of  farmers\u2019  objection  to  inundation. \nCompensation  to  be  paid  is  3\u20134  times  the  cost  of  the  structure  itself,  making  this  option \nfinancially unviable.9  \n \n14. \nRural  Component.  Batch  1  subprojects  of  the  rural  component  have  completed \nplanning  and  more  than  80%  of  all  design  activities.  Construction  of  rural  water  supply  and \nsanitation schemes was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2005 and is expected to be completed \nin  mid  2007.  Approximately  40%  of  all  contracts  in  140  Grama  Nilathari  Divisions  (GNDs)  in \nAnuradhapura  and  Polonnaruwa  (batch  1  serves  four  PSs  in  Anuradhapura  and  three  in \nPolonnaruwa)10 have been awarded. Batch 1 for Batticaloa\u2019s rural component is at an advanced \nstage  in  the  mobilization  and  planning  process.  Hygiene  and  sanitation  campaigns  have  been \ndelivered for PSs under the first batch of activities. Design and implementation information on \nparticipatory  mechanisms  in  the  community  driven  rural  water  supply  component  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix A.11   \n \nInstitutional  Strengthening.  Targets  for  in-country  training  of  project  staff  have  been \n15. \nparticularly  successful  (270%  participant  attendance)  but  overseas  project  staff  training  only \nachieved  50%  of  its  targets  because  of  NWSDB  restrictions  on  training  of  contractual  staff. \nNational  public  awareness  and  education  campaign  activities  are  also  being  implemented \ngradually, with varying media coverage, tools under utilization, and targeted audience. Although \napproximately  9  months  behind  schedule  implementation  of  the  proposed  NWSDB  corporate \nstrategy-support  component  is  progressing  well.  NWSDB  program  approval  was  obtained  in \nJune  2005  and  NWSDB  is  monitoring  its  implementation  quarterly.  Financial  management \nstrengthening  outputs  are  to  be  achieved  through:  (i)  implementation  of  a  resource  allocation \nstrategy  with  performance-based  incentives,  and  (ii)  financial  management  improvement \nstrategies.  The  operational  efficiency  plan  is  to  reduce  O&M  costs  through:  (i)  a  training \ncomponent;  (ii)  enhancing  collection  performance  and  customer  satisfaction  by  upgrading \ncomputer  hardware  and  introduction  of  computer-assisted  bill  receiving  cashier  points; \n(iii) reducing  power  consumption  through  improved  plant  efficiency,  introduction  of  energy \nsaving measures, and systems to reduce energy losses; and (iv) improving institutional capacity \nfor repairs and maintenance. While the program for reduction of power consumption has been \nsuccessful, further efforts and resource allocation is needed for reducing non-revenue water.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSafeguards Compliance Review \n\nEnvironment.  A  review  of  environmental  safeguards  compliance  is  in  Supplementary \n16. \nAppendix B. The assessment indicates that mitigation measures proposed in the original initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE), as presented at appraisal, have been incorporated in design \nand initial construction activities. Bidding documents address environmental requirements, and \n\n                                                 \n9   NWSDB has proposed to appoint a special committee to study low-cost options for Matara for future implementation \n\nunder other projects. The Project has suspended all activities regarding this component. \n\n10  Batch  1  water  supply  activities  in  Polonnaruwa  and  Anuradhapura  districts  are  expected  to  benefit  26,400 \nhouseholds  (HHs)  while  rural  sanitation  will  improved  the  well-being  of  around  12,600  HHs  in  the  same  areas. \nBatch 2 is expected to support water supply activities of 35,400 HHs and sanitation for 13,200 HHs in six PSs.  \n11  Foundations  for  successful  implementation  of  the  rural  component  are  based  on  ADB.  1997.  Report  and \nRecommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the  Democratic  Socialist \nRepublic of Sri Lanka for the Third Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project. Manila.  \n\n\fdesign of packages has been conducted to minimize and/or prevent any impacts. Environmental \nmanagement  plans  (EMPs)  have  been  formulated  for  the  towns  of  Batticaloa,  Hambantota, \nMuttur,  and  Polonnaruwa.  Environmental  clearances  have  been  obtained  from  the  Central \nEnvironmental Authority (CEA) for all project activities except the Matara salinity barrier, which \nis  no  longer  needed.  Site  selection  in  Polonnaruwa  has  been  modified  to  ensure  that: \n(i) construction  is  situated  at  a  safe  distance  from  the  archaeological  zone;  and  (ii)  the  water \ntreatment  plant  site  is  in  elevated  land,  preventing  exposure  and  damage  from  flooding.  A \nreview of project activities indicates that care has been taken in introducing and implementing \nrequired  environmental  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  plans.  Extensions  for  all  CEA \nenvironmental  clearances,  Wildlife  Department  clearance  and  water  rights  from  the  Mahaweli \nAuthority  for  Polonnaruwa\u2019s  scheme  have  been  obtained  and  NWSDB  has  recruited  project-\nbased environmental officers to oversee environmental implementation during construction.  \n \nResettlement.  A  review  of  the  implementation  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \n17. \nprocesses under the Project has revealed that activities for transferring government land are at \nan advanced stage. Of 21 parcels to be transferred, consent to construct has been received and \ninitial  lease  has  been  paid  for  5  parcels,  while  consent  to  construct  has  been  received  for  11 \nparcels.  Project  infrastructure  can  also  be  constructed  in  the  3  NSWDB  parcels.  Land \nacquisition  procedures  have  also  been  initiated  for  private  land.  Because  of  project \nmodifications, private land to be acquired has increased from 1.40 hectares (ha), at appraisal, to \n1.94  ha.  In  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  National  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  and \nADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement, 12 NWSDB  must  ensure  payment  at  replacement \ncosts  for  all  land  acquired\u2014even  for  a  transaction  completed  in  Muttur  not  meeting  this \nrequirement.  To  date, \nthe  project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU)  in  Batticaloa,  NWSDB  has  initiated  the  implementation  of  the \ncompensation  plan,  and  a  preliminary  list  of  affected  persons  (APs)  has  been  drawn  up.  The \ndraft compensation plan for Unnichchai tank was prepared by NWSDB in June 2002, and was \nrevised13 and discussed at a meeting held on 11 October 2005 among 15 government-agency \nstakeholders and 4 representatives of the farmer\u2019s organization. However, as prescribed in the \ncompensation  plan,  finalization  of  the  compensation  plan  requires  extensive  inputs  from  the \ncommittees  (which  should  include  all  APs)  with  an  independent  and  knowledgeable  facilitator \nand this should be addressed in a timely manner.14  \n \n\nits  project  management  unit  (PMU)  and \n\nthrough \n\n3. \n\nProject Benefits and Impacts \n\n18. \nGender. The gender action plan for the Project promotes equal representation of women \nin  staff  and  project  and  partner  organizations,  and  ensures  the  involvement  of  women \nthroughout  project  development  activities  in  all  phases.  Numerical  targets  set  for  the  Project \nhave been met or exceeded.15 The target of 50% representation in CBOs has not yet been met \nbut  is  progressively  increasing  (25%  in  Anuradhapura  and  40%  in  Polonnaruwa),  including  a \ngrowing  number  of  women\u2019s  organizations  (62  in  Anuradhapura  and  75  in  Polonnaruwa).  To \nfacilitate  gender  and  development,  the  Project  has  initiated  activities  such  as:  (i)  initial \nparticipatory  social  assessments  to  understand  women\u2019s  roles;  (ii)  formation  of  groups  and \norganizations  for  women,  and  ensuring  women\u2019s  representation  in  other  groups;  (iii)  women \n\n                                                 \n12  ADB. 1995.

The  rural  component  is  based  on  a  demand-driven \n19. \nparticipatory  approach \nthe \nbeneficiaries organize in CBOs and collectively take responsibility for subproject implementation \nand O&M of water systems. Implementation of the first rural batch is at an advanced stage and \nits  approach  is  reported  to  be  highly  supported  and  well  accepted  by  CBOs.  Supporting \ndocuments  have  been  prepared  for  selecting  partner  organizations,  social  mobilization  and \ncommunity  participatory  planning  process,  conducting  socioeconomic  surveys,  environmental \nconservation plans and hygiene and sanitation, participatory rural appraisals, and cost sharing. \nCommunity commitment and participation has been reflected not only through cash contribution \ntowards  the  overall  provision  of  the  schemes  (20%)  but  also  through  active  participation  in \ndesign  and  site  identification,  provision  of  unskilled  labor,  and  commitment  to  provide  skilled \nlabor, wherever the Project can offer training opportunities.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY LOANS \n\nA. \n\nRevised Cost Estimates \n\n20. \nThe revised total cost of the Project is estimated at $175.2 million equivalent, including \ntaxes,  duties,  interest  charges  on  the  ADB  loans,  and  physical  and  price  contingencies.

The project cost increase is $80.8 million, whereas the financing gap is estimated \nto  be  $88.8  million  or  approximately  100%  of  the  original  project  cost.16 Factors  and  reasons \nleading  to  cost  overrun  in  the  Project  include:  (i)  price  increases,  (ii)  physical  changes  during \ndetailed  engineering  design,  (iii)  cost  underestimation  at  appraisal,  and  (iv)  increases  in \ngovernment  taxes  and  duties  for  goods  and  services.

As  indicated  in  the  comparative  assessment \n(Table 1),  the  urban  component  has  increased  by  140%  (and  represents  89%  of  the  cost \noverrun), but the rural component has only increased by 39% (7% of the cost overrun) and the \nproject management component has risen by just 28% (4% of the cost overrun). Most significant \ncost  increases  have  been  registered  for  the  urban  component,  whereas  the  rural  component \nwas less significantly affected. As shown in Table 2, the urban component has been affected by \na combination of price escalation, undercosting at appraisal, and physical changes.  \n \n23. \nThe  rural  component  is  a  sector-like  component.  As  such,  precise  design  was  not \nconducted  at  feasibility;  instead,  sample  subprojects  were  utilized  to  conduct  projections. \nDespite general increases in commodities (which correlate adequately with the overall increase \nin  the  component),  the  cost  has  largely  been  contained  as  a  result  of  (i)  communities  being \nresponsible for undertaking civil works during construction, and (ii) partial activity redesigning to \nminimize capital expenditure while optimizing O&M costs.  \n \n24. \nIncreases  in  project  management  have  resulted  from  requirements  for  (i)  additional \nperson-months  of  supervision  consultants,  and  (ii)  PMU  and  PIU  salaries  and  running  costs. \nThe number of supervision consultants was minimized in the original project and later found to \nbe  insufficient  to  properly  implement  the  Project  in  a  timely  manner  in  four  towns  in  different \ngeographical locations at the same time.17 Project management requirements are estimated to \nhave  caused  4%  of  the  cost  overrun.  Government  incremental  costs  have  resulted  from \nsubstantial increases in salary over the past 3 years.18  \n                                                 \n16  Given the advanced state of design and tendering, physical contingencies have been minimized. Based on recent \nhistorical data, allowance for price contingencies has been retained to accommodate contract price adjustments. \n17  While it was suggested that the supervision person-months deficit could be fulfilled with NWSDB staff, this has not \nproven  possible  because  of  (i)  multiple  commitments  in  the  aftermath  of  the  tsunami  reconstruction  process; \n(ii) NWSDB  recruitment  minimization;  and  (iii)  operation  in  \u201cdifficult\u201d  areas  attracting  a  smaller  number  of  skilled \nstaff, often at additional premium rates. \n\n18  NWSDB has reviewed its human resources strategy and conducted a salary review and realignment.   \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\nCost Overrun per Category. Further evaluation of the cost overrun has shown that civil \n25. \nworks are the largest base cost category, increasing by $38.5 million or 100% increase over the \noriginal  civil  works  allocation  (these  still  represent  58%  of  the  base  cost  and  58%  of  the  total \ncost overrun). Goods and equipment follows, increasing by $25 million or 175% increase over \nthe  original  equipment  allocation  (representing  38%  of  the  total  cost  overrun  and  a  category \nincrease in base cost from 23% to 30%); consulting services, increasing by $1 million or 2% of \nthe  total  cost  overrun;  and  incremental  staff  and  recurring  costs,  increasing  by  $1.2  million  or \n2% of the total cost overrun. Taxes and duties, increasing by 15 million or 19% of the total cost \noverrun, will be covered by counterpart contributions. \n \n26. \nPrice  Escalation.  Price  factors  contributing  to  cost  escalation  have  two  main  sources: \n(i) a notable rise in international market rates for construction materials, and (ii) price escalation \nresulting from the post-tsunami construction boom. Price escalation data related to construction \nmaterials is in Appendix 5. A review of NWSDB national book rates and rates of the Sri Lanka \nInstitute of Construction, Training and Development indicates a significant cost increase in basic \nconstruction material. The price of goods sourced from international markets (such as oil, steel, \niron, and copper) rose almost continuously for the entire 2002\u20132006 period. Prices were further \naffected by increases in locally available resources such as sand and labor.19 Pre-tsunami price \nincreases  (2001\u20132004)  averaged  10-30%  per  year,  depending  on  international  markets.  The \ntsunami  disaster  exacerbated  the  situation  by  distorting  local  market  conditions  through \nincreased reconstruction activity, shortage of supplies, and demand for services. In addition to \nhigh  demand  for  materials  and  labor  for  the  reconstruction  process,  the  tsunami  delayed \nsurveying  activities  and  other  essential  studies  that  marginally  impacted  the  readiness  of  the \ndesign. 20 The overall compounded cost overrun caused by price escalation is estimated around \n36%.21 While price contingencies were provided under the original design (11.5% of base cost), \nthese are insufficient to accommodate foreign and local cost increases.22 \n \n27. \nCost Underestimation at Appraisal. Project costing at appraisal was conducted on the \nbasis of the 2001 NWSDB book rates, which are prepared based on recent and/or previous year \ncontract awards and market rates for ongoing projects. During this period (2001-2002), NWSDB \nbook rates did not incorporate contract experience in water supply and sanitation projects in the \nNorth-East Province, as no such projects were under implementation. Consequently, the rates \nused at appraisal were found to be insufficient. Based on contract-award experience for 2003\u2013\n2006, underestimation resulting from failure to consider risk factors at appraisal (2002) has been \ntotal  cost  overrun. 23  In  addition, \nevaluated \nunderestimation  at  appraisal  has  been  associated  with  the  use  of  NWSDB  rates,  which  have \nbeen  found  to  be  generally  insufficient  (15\u201320%  below  market  rates,  depending  on  the  item). \nUndercosting of the original project is estimated to be the cause of 24% of the cost overrun.  \n \n28. \nIncreases  in  Taxes  and  Duties.  Taxes  and  duties  for  goods  and  services,  including \nvalue  added  tax  and  custom  duties,  were  underestimated  at  appraisal  (by  $10  million  in \n                                                 \n19  Sample price increases during 2002\u20132006 include: (i) steel (120%), (ii) pipes (around 40% for PVC pipes and 60\u2013\n90%  for  ductile  iron  pipes),  (iii)  electromechanical  equipment  (100%),  (iv)  sand  (about  200%),  and  (v)  cement \n(45%).  High  oil  prices,  which  increased  by  about  60\u201390%,  also  led  to  increased  manufacturing,  shipping,  and \ntransportation  costs. Labor costs are reported to have increased significantly; NWSDB rates suggest an average \nincrease of 50\u201360% for unskilled and skilled labor. \n\nto  have  caused  around  10-15%  of \n\n20 Given time requirements to complete detailed engineering design, contracts could not have been awarded before \n\nthe \n\nthe tsunami.  \n\n21  This  figure  is  consistent  with  general  compounded  inflation  levels  of  around  46%  over  2001\u20132005.  The  slightly \n\nlower value correlates directly with currency devaluation (approximately 8% since original appraisal). \n\n22  Price contingencies were estimated at appraisal at an annual factor of 2.4% for both foreign and local costs.   \n23  Factors  having  been  quoted  to  be  at  the  origin  of  increasing  costs  include,  remoteness,  difficulty  of  access  and \n\nincreased insurance costs associated with security matters.  \n\n\fabsolute value). In addition, an increase in project cost has led to a rise in taxes and duties (by \n$5 million in absolute value). The total value represents an increase of 215% from the originally \nagreed value and 19% equivalent of the cost overrun. Financing for additional taxes and duties \nwill remain part of the Government\u2019s counterpart contribution under the supplementary loans.   \n \n29. \nCost  Increase  caused  by  Changes  in  Project  Design.  The  overall  cumulative  cost \noverrun  caused  by  changes  during  detailed  engineering  design  is  estimated  around  21%. \nPhysical contingencies provided under the original design (amounting to approximately 10% of \nthe  base  cost)  are  insufficient  to  accommodate  costs  increases  for  these  changes.  Design \nmodifications were introduced following completion of hydrological, water quality, topographical, \ngeotechnical, inundation, and environmental surveys and have been discussed in paras. 30\u201331. \n \nC. \n\nProposed Physical Changes within Existing Project Scope \n\n30. \nDepending  on  the  project  town,  surveys  indicated  the  need  to:  (i) resize  intake \nstructures,  (ii)  revise  electromechanical  arrangements  and  piping  material,  (iii) provide  full \nconventional water treatment, and (iv) provide adequate foundations to overcome potential land \nsubsidence.  Such  changes  were  introduced  to  ensure  that:  (i)  required  drinking  water  quality \nlevels  are  achieved  in  accordance  with  national  and  World  Health  Organization  standards;  (ii) \nwater  quantity  in  project  towns  is  sufficient  and  extracted  at  sustainable  rates;  and  (iii)  full \ncompliance  with  safety  requirements,  environment,  and  social  safeguards  is  secured.  Since \nthree  of  the  four  project  towns  were  significantly  impacted  by  the  tsunami,  the  design  was \nadapted, incorporating modifications and marginal scope changes for (i) buffer zoning, and (ii) \nwater supply to tsunami settlements. Physical changes and modifications in design are detailed \nin Appendix 6 and Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n31. \nThe  most  significant  cost  increases  were  incurred  in  Polonnaruwa  (52%  scheme  cost \nincrease  caused  by  design  changes)  following  a  forced  change  in  intake  location  from  the \nproposed  Parakarama  Samudra  source  to  the  Mahaweli.24 The  revised  design  for  the  water \nsupply scheme required (i) a new intake (instead of augmenting the existing one); (ii) increased \npumping  requirements,  length  and  size  of  transmission  lines;  and  (ii)  new  and  more  complex \nwater  treatment  facilities.  In  Hamabantota,  cost  increases  caused  by  design  changes  have \nresulted from an increase in intake size, revisions to design to accommodate and optimize the \nsimultaneous  operation  of  three  water  treatment  plants,  and  revisions  on  piping  material  to \nwithstand internal and external pressures. In Muttur, changes introduced will compensate poor \nsubsoil  conditions  and  ensure  the  safety  of  the  public,  workers,  and  equipment.  In  Batticaloa, \ndesign  modifications  include  treatment  against  blue-green  algae  toxicants,  and  revisions  to \nelectromechanical  works  to  minimize  O&M  costs.  In  Matara,  inundation  surveys  revealed  that \nthe  construction  of  its  single  subcomponent,  a  salinity  barrier,  would  require  significant \ncompensation\u2014amounting to approximately $12 million\u2014so the subproject is no longer viable. \nPhysical changes in design often arose from factors that could not have been addressed at the \nfeasibility  stage,  especially  as  surveys  conducted  during  this  period  were  restricted  by  local \nsecurity  conditions  in  the  North-East  Province.  Despite  the  above  changes,  the  number  of \nbeneficiaries is estimated to remain largely unchanged. \n \nD. \n\nImpact on the Project \n\n32. \nIn  the  absence  of  supplementary  loans,  the  Project  will  be  unable  to  meet  its  original \nobjectives.  In  particular,  the  urban  component  could  not  be  accomplished,  depriving  an \n\n                                                 \n24  The  preliminary  design  recommended  and  agreed  with  the  North  Central  provincial  irrigation  department  for  full \nwater extraction was to be sourced from the Parakrama Samudra tank (signed memorandum of understanding in \n2002). However, the irrigation department later contested the agreement, leading to the suspension of this option. \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\nestimated  population  of  up  to  250,000  (out  of  575,000)  of  water. 25 The  cost  overrun  would \nprevent  at  least  one  of  the  four  towns  (and  up  to  three,  depending  on  the  final  scope)  from \nreceiving a water supply scheme. Similarly, the rural component may have to be revised and the \nnumber  of  beneficiaries  may  have  to  be  reduced  by  about  100,000.  The  institutional \nstrengthening component, operating under the original budget, is expected to be able to meet its \nobjectives with current resource allocations.   \n \n33. \nBecause of the reasons outlined above, cost overruns have been generally reported in \nconstruction  operations,  including  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  sector.  NWSDB  remains \nengaged  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  urban  and  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation, \nespecially since the importance of this sector was renewed and emphasized after the tsunami \nneeds  assessment.  NWSDB  is  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  an  increasing  number  of \nforeign-assisted  projects.  However,  its  capacity,  in  terms  of  resources  and  counterpart \nallocations,  remains  adequate.  The  PMU  and  PIUs  are  operating  satisfactorily  and  executing \nand implementing agencies are operating within their mandate. An outline capacity assessment \nof the executing agency (EA) is summarized in Appendix 7. The revised design is considered to \nbe the best possible option for all four towns, and physical changes and modifications within the \noriginal  scope  are  expected  to  optimize  operation  while  reducing  maintenance  costs.  Design \nmodifications have also catered for improved safety measures, accessibility, and environmental \nprotection.  Although  the  objectives  of  the  overall  Project  remain  generally  aligned  to  those \nreported  in  the  original  project  RRP  (footnote  1),  a  revised  project  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 8. \n \nE. \n\nRationale for Supplementary Loans \n\nAlignment  with  Government  and  ADB  Priorities.  Provision  of  safe  drinking  water \n34. \nthrough  construction  of  new  schemes  and  augmentation  of  existing  ones  represents  a  major \nmilestone  in  the  Government\u2019s  New  Development  Strategy  and  is  therefore  a  government \npriority.  The  Project  continues  to  be  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  promote \nregionally  balanced  development,  rehabilitating  and  reconstructing  conflict-affected  areas, \nreducing poverty and providing equitable development. The supplementary loans will assist the \nGovernment in delivering the originally defined development objectives and, in addition, support \nthe tsunami rehabilitation process in three major secondary towns in Sri Lanka. The Project is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (2004\u20132008)26 and its updates.  \n \n35. \nAlignment  with  Government  and  ADB  Policies. Physical changes within the original \nscope  have  been  assessed,  along  with  their  impacts  in  the  context  of  current  ADB  policies.27 \nNew and revised policies, approved by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors since appraisal of the original \nproject, have been considered. Technical, capacity and institutional assessments and economic \nand financial analyses of the revised Project have been conducted. All steps in the matrix of due \ndiligence have been observed. The revised Project is technically feasible, institutionally sound, \neconomically viable, and financially sustainable (subject to tariff revisions).  \n \n36. \nCompliance  with  Safeguards  Requirements.  Ongoing    and  modified  activities  have \nbeen  reviewed  for  compliance  with  safeguards  and  shown  to  be  sound  with  regard  to  ADB\u2019s \nenvironment, resettlement, and indigenous peoples\u2019 policies.  \n \n\n                                                 \n25  Despite  dialogue  with  various  funding  agencies,  bilateral  aid  partners  are  unable  to  commit  the  required \nsupplementary  funds  to  this  Project.  The  Government  has  also  informed  ADB  that  it  is  unable  meet  the  entire \nproject funding gap.  \n\n26  ADB. 2003. Sri Lanka: Country Strategy and Program (2004\u20132008).

Despite  delays  associated  with  the  tsunami,  progress  to  date  has  been \n37. \nsatisfactory.  Processing  of  supplementary  loans  should  not  be  delayed  because:  (i) detailed \nengineering design is almost complete and figures are expected to remain largely unchanged; \n(ii) processing and loan effectiveness require several months, despite streamlining procedures \nintroduced  with  revisions  to  the  supplementary  financing  policy;  (iii)  the  Project\u2019s  cost  overrun \nhas  been  weighed  against  contracts  awarded  under  this  and  other  NWSDB  projects  over  the \npast  6  months,  indicating  no  expected  \u201csavings\u201d;  and  (iv)  if  supplementary  loans  were  not \nprovided, the project would have insufficient funds to award contracts by the end of 2006.  \n \nF. \n\nSafeguards \n\n38. \nInvoluntary  Resettlement.  A  short  resettlement  plan  (SRP)  was  prepared  by  the  EA \n(NWSDB)  during  project  appraisal,  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  National  Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy28 and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (footnote  12).  The  SRP \nhad  two  parts:  (i) addressing  temporary  loss  of  livelihood  for  farmers,  laborers,  and  fishers \naffected  by  lowering  water  levels  in  the  Unnichchai  tank  during  tank  strengthening  and  level \naugmentation; and (ii) addressing resettlement impacts resulting from permanent acquisition of \n10.0  ha  of  land,  of  which  NWSDB  owns  1.1  ha,  other  government  agencies  own  7.5  ha,  and \nprivate  individuals  own  1.4 ha.  The  current  project  design  will  have  the  same  impacts  on  the \ntemporary  loss  of  livelihood  for  farmers,  laborers,  and  fishers  affected  by  lowering  water \ndischarge  levels  in  the  Unnichchai  tank,  as  civil  works  are  conducted.  Since  there  will  be  no \nchanges in the resettlement impact for raising the Unnichchai tank, the existing compensation \nplan  will  be  followed  to  address  the  temporary  loss  of  livelihood.  However,  while  physical \nchanges  in  project  design  have  been  conceptualized  to  avoid  involuntary  resettlement  and \nminimize impacts, a revised SRP is required to: (i) ensure the replacement of housing structures \nfor NWSDB staff; (ii) compensate for structures, such as wells and trees, with commercial value; \n(iii)  ensure  that  vulnerable  persons  are  identified  and  provided  with  additional  compensation, \nand (iv) address temporary impacts. The revised SRP is in Supplementary Appendix G and its \nsummary is in Appendix 9. \n \nEnvironment.  Based  on  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Policy, 29  the  Project  is  classified  as \n39. \nenvironmental  category  B.  As  part  of  due  diligence,  proposed  physical  changes  within  the \noriginal  design  have  been  screened  for  safeguard  significance  and  found  to  be  within  the \noriginal  project  categorization.  IEEs  incorporating  detailed  engineering  design  changes  have \nbeen formulated for Batticaloa and Polonnaruwa; original IEEs for Hambantota and Muttur have \nbeen  found  to  adequately  address  potential  environmental  impacts  and  mitigation  measures. \nThe  Project  has  renewed  all  environmental  clearances  from  the  CEA.  A  revised  and  updated \nsummary  IEE  (SIEE)  has  been  formulated  to  encapsulate  the  findings  and  requirements \noutlined \nrevised  environmental  documents  prepared  during  project \nimplementation. The new SIEE (Supplementary Appendix H) shows that none of the proposed \ncomponents  will  have  significant  adverse  environmental \nimpacts.  Anticipated  minor \nenvironmental  impacts  not  included  in  the  original  design  include  dust  generation  caused  by \nexcavation activities, increased vibrations resulting from rock drilling, land subsidence because \nof poor soil conditions, and minor disturbance of the lagoon bed in Batticaloa during pipe-laying \noperations.  Environmental  impacts  have  been  minimized  through  appropriate  design  and  site \nlocation,  and  adequate  mitigation  measures  have  been  proposed  to  prevent  or  minimize \nimpacts resulting from construction and operation.  \n \n40. \nIndigenous  Peoples. The Project was classified as category C for indigenous peoples \nsafeguards  under  the  original  loan.  Although  the  Project  incorporates  a  mixture  of  Tamil, \n                                                 \n28  Ministry of Land Development. 2001. National Involuntary Resettlement Policy.

Consequently,  the  revised  detailed \nengineering design is expected to benefit all groups equally.  \n \nG. \n\nRevised Financing Plan \n\n41. \nA  loan  of  $60.3  million  equivalent  was  originally  allocated  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Fund \nresources.  In  addition,  supplementary  loans  for  $46.5  million  equivalent  will  be  provided  from \nADB\u2019s Special Fund resources (ADF) and $13.5 million equivalent will be provided from ordinary \ncapital  resources  (OCR)  to  finance  the  Project.  The  ADF  loan  will  have  a  term  of  32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum during \nthe  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  The  OCR  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, conversion options in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s conversion guidelines, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other \nterms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  The  Government  has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices \nwere  the  Government\u2019s  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB.

Interest  during  the  project \nimplementation  period will  be  capitalized.  The Government  will  provide  a  total  of  $51.8  million \nequivalent  (30%  of  the  total  project  cost)  to  finance  taxes  and  duties,  resettlement,  land \nacquisition, and part of civil works and equipment. Communities will provide about $3.1 million \nequivalent  for  civil  works  as  equity  contribution  to  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  schemes. \nADF resources for supplementary loans will be provided from a variety of sources, including: (i) \nthe  reallocation  of  $18.5 million  equivalent  in  ADF  resources  from  unutilized  loan  proceeds  of \nclosed  loans  to  the  Government,  and  (ii)  a  new  $28.0  million  equivalent  ADF  allocation.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the \nBoard of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Secondary Towns \nand Rural Community-Based Water Supply and Sanitation Project. Manila is as per the original loan agreement. The \nnew  ADF  loan  will  finance  67%  of  total  expenditure  in  civil  works,  76%  for  equipment  and  materials  (exclusive  of \ntaxes and duties), and 100% of the interest charge; the OCR loan will finance 62% of total expenditure in civil works, \n70% for equipment and materials (exclusive of taxes and duties),  and 100% of the interest and commitment charges.   \n\n\floan  and  project  agreements  will  be  prepared  for  both  ADF  and  OCR  loans.  Repayments  of \nsupplementary loans will be synchronized with those of the original loan. The Government will \ncontinue  to  make  available  counterpart  financing  in  a  timely  manner,  including  the  additional \n$33.2 million equivalent in counterpart resources required for the supplementary loans.  \n \n43. \nSubsidiary  Loan  Agreements.  The  Government  will  make  loan  proceeds  available  to \nNWSDB  as  a  grant  and  a  loan  through  new  subsidiary  financing  agreements  acceptable  to \nADB.  The  ratio  of  grant  and  loan  is  expected  to  be  determined  based  on  urban  and  rural \npopulation ratios in project areas. Based on the subsidiary financing agreement of the original \nproject  signed  between  NWSDB  and  the  Government:  (i)  85%  of  funding  for  water  supply \nschemes  in  PSs  will  be  made  available  to  NWSDB  as  a  grant  and  15%  as  a  loan;  (ii)  for \nschemes in urban and municipal councils, 50% of funding will be provided as a grant and 50% \nas a loan; and (iii) for rural water supply and sanitation systems implemented by communities, \n100%  of  funding  will  be  provided  as  a  grant.  The  subsidiary  loan  from  the  Government  to \nNWSDB will have an interest rate of 10% with a 24-year term, including a 5-year grace period.   \n \nH. \n\nLoan Savings and Utilization of Surplus Loan Proceeds \n\n44. \nAs  part  of  its  loan  portfolio  review  in  2006,  ADB  and  the  Government  identified \n$37.6 million  in  surplus  loan  savings  from  seven  ongoing  projects  in  the  country. 31  Given \nexisting  constraints  on  ADF  resources,  and  in  agreement  with  ADB\u2019s  revised  policy  on \nsupplementary financing (footnote 27), the Government has requested the reallocation of loan \nsavings  from  four  loans 32  where  activities  are  completed  or  loan  proceeds  are  no  longer \nnecessary  for  completion  of  the  projects  (Appendix  10).  Since  project  completion  dates  for  all \nfour captioned loans are foregone, changes in scope or implementation arrangements are not \nrequired.  As  indicated  in  para. 42,  it  is  proposed  that  surplus  loan  proceeds  be  utilized  to \nfinance part of the ADF supplementary loan for this Project and that reallocation be conducted \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Project Administration Instructions (PAIs).33 If the Board approves the proposed \nuse of surplus loan proceeds, then the director general, acting under the authority provided in \nthe PAIs,34 will be deemed to have approved the cancellation of surplus loan proceeds from the \nfour loans. The captioned loans will be closed, savings reallocated and cancelled on the same \ndate, which will coincide with the new ADF loan effectiveness date. \n \nI. \n\nRemedial Steps35 \n\n45. \nReliable  Costing. To minimize errors resulting from inadequate estimates, latest costs \n(i)  have  been  conducted  using  2006  market  rates,  which  accommodate  post-tsunami \nconstruction boom price increases and incorporate experience from ongoing contract packages \n                                                 \n31  Memorandum  of  Understanding:  Review  of  ADB  Lending  Portfolio  in  Sri  Lanka,  August  2006  (Supplementary \n\nAppendix I). \n\n32  Proposed  loan  savings  amount  to  SDR12.56  million  (about  $18.56  million  equivalent)  and  include:  (i)  ADB.  1997. \nReport  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the  Democratic \nSocialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Upper  Watershed  Management  Project.

Price  contingencies  have  been  maintained  to  accommodate \nvariable  price  contracts.  ADB  guidelines  for  estimating  price  contingencies  have  been  applied \nand  factors  conform  to  ADB\u2019s  recommendations  for  Sri  Lanka  to  account  for  inflation  and \ncurrency depreciation factors.   \n  \nTimely  Implementation. To prevent further cost overruns, it is essential for the Project \n47. \nto minimize any delays in implementation and construction activities. For this purpose, the PMU \nwill  continue  to  update  the  existing  critical  path  method  diagrams  as  part  of  the  project \nperformance monitoring system (PPMS), and recruit required staff and consultancy services in a \ntimely  manner. Project activities are expected  to be completed no later  than  6\u20139 months  after \nthe originally approved closing date.  \n \nJ. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n48. \nIt is proposed that NWSDB, under MUDWS, will be the EA for supplementary loans (as \nfor  the  Secondary  Towns  and  Rural  Community-Based  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Project). \nThe  PMU,  established  in  Colombo  under  NWSDB  to  support  the  original  project,  will  be  the \nPMU  for  the  supplementary  loans.  Existing  PIUs,  PS  implementation  units  (PSIUs),  and \ntechnical  support  units  under  the  original  project  will  support  implementation  under  the \nsupplementary  loans.  Policy  and  strategic  decisions  and  PMU  guidance  (as  for  the  original \nproject) will be provided by the existing national steering committee chaired by the secretary of \nMUDWS,  and  coordination  for  the  rural  PSIUs  will  be  provided  by  the  coordinating  committee \nestablished in the North Central provincial council. Where necessary, additional complementary \nproject coordinating committees will be established at the district, divisional, and village levels. \nThe rural water supply section of NWSDB will continue to act as the technical advisory unit for \nthe  rural  component,  providing  support  to  the  technical  support  units  and  PSIUs,  whilst  the \nRural Water Supply and Sanitation Division in MUD&WS  will provide policy guidance to PMU, \nprovincial project coordinating committee, project support units, and PSIUs, and monitor policy \nimplementation  of  this  component.  For  maximum  resource  efficiency,  TSUs  and  PIUs  in \nPolonnaruwa and Batticaloa share facilities and, wherever relevant and necessary, knowledge \nand expertise. Based on implementation and capacity development progress, and the financial \nmanagement  systems  assessment  (Appendix  7),  financial  management  arrangements  for  the \nsupplementary loans are regarded as satisfactory. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe  Secondary  Towns  and  Rural  Community-Based  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation \n49. \nProject  is  to  be  implemented  over  6  years  and  the  expected  completion  date  is  March  2009. \nSince few delays have  been incurred because of delayed  loan effectiveness and the tsunami, \nthe  proposed  supplementary  loans  are  expected  to  be  implemented  in  parallel  with  the  main \nproject activities, with a revised completion date no later than 31 December 2009 (Appendix 11). \n  \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n50. \nGoods  and  services  financed  by  the  ADB  loans  have  been  and  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines,  as  amended  from  time  to  time.  Urban  water \nsupply  schemes  are  to  be  built  according  to  procurement  packages  agreed  by  the  Inception \nMission  for  the  original  project,  which  include  design-and-build  contracts  and  supply-and-lay \n\n\f \n\n15\n\npackages for international competitive bidding (ICB) 36 and national competitive bidding (NCB). \nBefore any new procurement activity begins under NCB, ADB and the Borrower will review the \nBorrower\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines 37  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines  (2006).  Any  necessary  modifications  or  clarifications  will  be  reflected  in  the \nprocurement  plan.  Civil  works  contracts  valued  over  $2.5  million  equivalent  and  equipment \ncontracts  valued  above  $500,000  equivalent  will  be  undertaken  through  ICB  procedures.  Civil \nworks  contracts  valued  at  $2.5  million  equivalent  or  less  will  be  carried  out  under  NCB \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Equipment packages valued at $500,000 equivalent or less will \nbe procured following NCB. All construction works for the rural component remain valued at less \nthan  $1 million  equivalent,  so  they  will  be  procured  through  NCB  or,  in  the  case  of  contracts \nvalued at less than SLRs5 million (approximately $50,000 equivalent), they will be procured by \nCBOs following procedures for community participation in procurement acceptable to ADB. The \ncurrent  status  and  proposed  amendments  to  the  procurement  packages  for  the  urban \ncomponent are in Appendix 12 and a procurement plan is in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nthe  contractors'  simultaneous  work  sites  under \n\nIn addition to consulting services provided under the original project, it is envisaged that \n51. \nan  additional  1,500  person-months  of  national  supervisory  staff  inputs  will  be  required  to \nsupervise \nthe  Project.  The  additional \nrequirements  are  based  on  organizational  needs  for  adequate  supervision  of  all  contracts, \nincluding four design-and-build and 12 bills-of-quantity type contracts; and design of the salinity \nbarrier at Hambantota intake under the Project. A detailed assessment of the nature and time \ninputs of required additional consultants is in Appendix 13.  \n \nTwo  firms  were  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \n52. \nConsultants (2002) to support the original Project and included (ii) package A, for management \nsupport  for  the  PMU,  and  (ii)  package  B,  for  design  and  construction  supervision  of  the \nengineering  works.  The  consulting  firms  were  engaged  by  NWSDB  using  the  quality  and  cost \nbased selection method. The proposed additional consultant inputs for design and supervision \nwill  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2006),  as \namended  from  time  to  time,  through  the  single  source  selection  method  with  the  firm  for \npackage  B.  Single  source  selection  is  considered  the  most  appropriate  and  advantageous \nmethod of selection for the Government and the Project, as proposed tasks represent a natural \ncontinuation of previous work. Extending the services of the firm already engaged for package B \nis  expected  to  result  in  time  savings,  minimum  disruption  of  ongoing  activities,  and  the  use  of \nthe  most  competitive  rates  already  agreed  with  the  firm  which  won  the  contract  through  the \nquality  and  cost  based  selection  process.  The  firm  will  be  requested  to  provide  a  biodata \ntechnical proposal for review and negotiation by NWSDB and ADB. The terms of reference and \nqualification  requirements  for  consultants  will  follow  the  original  contract.  No  additional \nconsulting staff will be provided for package A under supplementary loans. \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n53. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998), as amended from time to time, was explained to and \ndiscussed  with  MUDWS  and  NWSDB.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \n\n                                                 \n36  Since this is an ongoing Project, contracts for goods and services have  been tendered and/or awarded following \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement (2004), consequently domestic preference has been and should continue to be \napplied  for  consistency  purposes.  From  1  April  2006,  all  procurement  is  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2006), as amended from time to time. Appendix 12 contains details. \n37  National Procurement Agency. 2006. Procurement Guidelines (Goods and Works). Colombo  \n\n \n\n\f 16 \n\nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in loan \nregulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by \nADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n\nMeasures to Enhance Governance and Prevent Corruption  \n\n6. \nThe  Project  will  introduce  additional38 specific  measures  to  enhance  governance  and \n54. \nprevent  corruption.  The  measures  include:  (i)  continued  consultant  support  to  PMU  staff  on \nprocurement, training, and financial management; (ii) continued use of information technology to \nincrease  transparency,  accountability,  and  efficiency;  and  (iii)  ensuring  that  all  representation \nletters are shared with ADB and attended to within 3 weeks of receipt (for this purpose, NWSDB \nwill develop relevant standard operating procedures). It is also recommended for audit systems \nto  be  strengthened  (internally  through  the  audit  committee  and  externally  through  the  Auditor \nGeneral). Adherence to codes of conduct by management and employees will be sought.  \n \nSpecific  measures  adopted  to  enhance  transparency  under  the  Project  include: \n55. \n(i) random and independent spot checks by ADB review missions on procurement and accounts \nof  the  Project;  (ii)  public  disclosure  through  the  NWSDB  or  project  website  of  information  on \n(a) bidding  procedures,  bidders,  and  contract  awards  for  the  Project;  and  (b)  use  of  the  funds \ndisbursed  under  the  Project;  (iii)  involvement  of  beneficiaries  in  monitoring  and  evaluation  of \nproject implementation; and (iv) the process of selection and approval of rural PSs will be made \nin  a  transparent  manner,  allowing  the  community  in  project  areas  to  access  such  information. \nProposed measures to enhance managerial and procurement capacity include: (i) in the case of \ncontractor  prequalification,  the  PMU  will  undertake  a  process  of  verification  to  meet  the \nspecified  qualification  criteria,  making  the  results  available  on  the  website;  (ii)  tender  capacity \nwill  be  mandatory  criteria  for  award  of  contracts;  and  (iii)  strict  review  of  implementation  and \nevaluation of the institutional strengthening component under the Project to determine the level \nof operational performance and financial management improvement within NWSDB.  \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n56. \nThe  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  disbursement  projections,  requesting \nbudgetary  allocations  for  counterpart  funds,  collecting  supporting  documents,  and  preparing \nwithdrawal applications and sending them to ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook39 as amended from time to time. To facilitate the timely release of loan proceeds and \ncounterpart  funds  and  to  expedite  project  implementation,  the  Government  will,  immediately \nafter loans are effective, open and maintain separate and new project imprest accounts, one for \nthe  ADF  supplementary  loan  and  another  for  the  OCR  supplementary  loan,  with  the  Central \nBank of Sri Lanka for NWSDB, to be managed by the PMU. The initial advances to the imprest \naccounts will not at any time exceed the estimated ADB-financed expenditures to be paid from \nthe imprest account for the next 6 months or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. The \nPMU  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  that  all  imprest  accounts  are  established,  managed, \nreplenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, and with \ndetailed arrangements agreed by the Government and ADB. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures \n(SOE) procedures will be used to liquidate advances from the imprest accounts. The maximum \n\n                                                 \n38  Corruption prevention structures in Sri Lanka include (i) the Bribery Commission, (ii) the Consultative Committee of \nthe  Parliament,  and  (iii)  the  institution  of  the  Auditor  General  (indirectly).  In  addition,  procurement  systems \nincorporate  anticorruption  and  transparency  elements  as  reflected  in  the  (i)  Guidelines  on  Government  Tender \nProcedures, and (ii) Procurement Support Bureau, which nominates tender evaluation committees. \n\n39  ADB. 2001. Loan Disbursement Handbook. Manila \n\n\fpayments permitted under the SOE for both first generation imprest accounts is $100,000 per \npayment. \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nThe Government will continue to provide ADB with monthly notes and quarterly progress \n57. \nreports on project implementation which follow ADB standard procedures. Accounts, SOEs, and \nrevenues related to the supplementary loans will be audited annually and separately by auditors \nacceptable  to  ADB.  The  annual  audit,  regularly  complied  with  under  the  original  project,  will \ninclude the audit of the imprest accounts and SOEs procedure. A separate audit opinion on the \nuse of the imprest accounts and SOE procedure will be included in the annual audit report. As \nto  date,  audited  project  accounts  and  financial  statements,  together  with  the  reports  of  the \nauditor,  will  continue  to  be  submitted  through  the  PMU  in  a  timely  manner.  However,  in \nagreement with ADB\u2019s latest policies, these will be submitted within 6 months after the end of \neach  financial  year.  The  PMU  will  also  submit  to  ADB,  within  3  months  of  the  physical \ncompletion of the Project, a project completion report following standard ADB procedures. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review and Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n58. \nADB  and  the  Government  will  jointly  undertake  annual  project  reviews  to  assess \nprogress, and a comprehensive midterm review in the fourth quarter of 2006. The project review \nwill  follow  standard  ADB  procedures.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  midterm  reviewers \nare informed of any policy or implementation changes affecting local government and the urban \ninfrastructure  sector.  The  midterm  review  will  (i)  finalize  implementation  arrangements;  (ii) \nassess  implementation  performance  against  project  indicators;  (iii)  review  and  establish \ncompliance  with  loan  covenants;  and  (iv)  identify  problems  and  constraints  and,  if  necessary, \nrecommend changes to ensure the expeditious implementation of the Project. As for the original \nloan, benefit monitoring and evaluation will be assessed through (i) targets established by the \noperation  plan  for  the  next  fiscal  year  to  be  prepared  by  the  Government  and  the  local \ngovernments by 31 December of the previous year and (ii) the PPMS procedures. As part of the \nPPMS, the use and reporting of the critical path method will be continued and reported during \nsemiannual review missions (see Supplementary Appendix K).   \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits, impacts, and risks identified for the original project continue to be relevant.40 A \n\n59. \nsummary of these and additional risks associated with supplementary loans follows. \n \nA. \n\nExpected Project Benefits and Impacts \n\n60. \nPoverty  Reduction  and  Improved  Quality  of  Life.  Lack  of  basic  infrastructure  and \nsocial  services  exacerbates  income  and  non-income  poverty,  particularly  in  project  towns \naffected by the tsunami. The Project is expected to impact on public health, reducing the high \nincidence of intestinal parasite and waterborne diseases caused by poor sanitation and lack of \nsafe water. This benefit will accrue especially to infants and children, who are more vulnerable. \nThe  Project  will  reduce  the  time  women  spend  fetching  water  and  taking  care  of  children \nsuffering  from  waterborne  diseases,  and  the  burden  of  carrying  heavy  loads.  The  Project  will \ncontinue  to  pursue  the  gender  action  plan\u2019s  specific  targets,  enhancing  women\u2019s  role  and \nparticipation in the sector. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 14.  \n \n\n                                                 \n40  The  number  of  beneficiaries  and  expected  benefits  remains  largely  unchanged.  Based  on  revised  projections  for \nproject areas, the number of beneficiaries, initially estimated at around 969,000 people, is expected to be 946,000. \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n\n\f 18 \n\nSupporting the Peace Process. The Project supports peace building. Water represents \n61. \nan  essential  good  and  provides  a  common  purpose  for  interaction  among  communities.  The \nProject will continue to assist reconstruction and development in areas affected by decades of \nconflict, and includes specific aspects aimed to address the needs of conflict-affected poor. \n \nSocial  Participation.  The  Project\u2019s  rural  component  provides  a  unique  opportunity  for \n62. \nsupporting inclusive social development and strengthening local government. Communities will \nbe  engaged  throughout  the  entire  cycle\u2014including  planning,  design,  construction,  and \nmanagement  stages\u2014leading  to  enhanced  ownership  and  accountability  among  beneficiaries. \nThe  Project  will  continue  to  provide  beneficiaries  with  training  opportunities  and  experience  in \nproject and financial management, and communities will gain skills to initiate other activities. \n \n63. \nEnvironmental  Sustainable  Development.  Towns  supported  under  the  Project  are \nlocated  in  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  \u201cdry  zone\u201d.  The  Project  will  support  water  extraction  from  sustainable \nsources,  limiting  pressures  on  groundwater  resources;  and  incorporate  measures  to  prevent \nsalinity intrusion and protect ecosystems. The Project will also provide improved sanitation and, \nin the case of Batticaloa, sewage treatment facilities preventing indiscriminate discharge of raw \nsewage  into  adjacent  lagoons.  Lagoon  and  river  protection  is  expected  to  yield  direct  benefits \non downstream ecosystems and, since primary fishing activities engage a significant part of the \nlabor force, protecting fisheries is a central activity for proposed poverty strategies.  \n \nEconomic  Benefits  and  Financial  Sustainability.  Economic  and  financial  analyses \n64. \nwere carried out for each water supply scheme in four towns (Supplementary Appendixes L, M, \nand  N).  Economic  benefits  for  water  supply  were  quantified  and  the  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn  (EIRR)  was  found  to  be  highest  in  Batticaloa  (12.1%),  followed  by  Muttur  (8.8%), \nPolonnaruwa (7.9%), and Hambantota (6.2%) in order of economic viability. For the four water \nsupply  schemes  combined,  the  overall  EIRR  is  estimated  at  9.8%.  As  agreed  with  the \nGovernment, financial sustainability of the urban schemes constructed under the Project will be \nsecured  through  the  revision  of  tariffs  to  cover  full  O&M  throughout  the  life  of  the  schemes41 \n(para.69).  This  is  consistent  with  NWSDB\u2019s  recent  policy  commitments  to  establish  tariffs \ncapable  of  recovering:  (i)  O&M,  debt  service,  and  depreciation  for  all  schemes  within  the \ncountry;  and  (ii)  scheme-specific  O&M.  Sustainability  of  the  rural  schemes  has  been  secured \nthrough:  (i)  CBO  signed  agreements  to  operate  and  maintain  all  schemes;  and  (ii)  extensive \nCBO  capacity  development  activities,  which  include  O&M,  management,  and  financial  and \naccounting training during construction and operation phases. \n \nB. \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\n65. \nPolitical Stability. The success of the Project in meeting its goal continues to assume a \nstable political environment. Disruption of the peace process may delay project implementation \nin  Batticaloa  and  Muttur.  ADB  will  continue  to  monitor  the  security  situation,  ensuring  that  the \nhighest  levels  of  safety,  as  determined  by  the  United  Nations,  are  applied.  The  PMU  will \ncontinue  to  monthly  brief  ADB  on  the  progress  of  each  of  the  packages,  immediately \nhighlighting any disruption associated to security matters. The Project will continue to implement \nspecific  mitigation  measures  proven  effective  to  date,  including:  (i)  careful  monitoring,  (ii) \npreferred  recruitment  of  district-based  qualified  PIU/TSU  staff,  (iii)  continued  dialogue  with  all \nstakeholders  and  aid  partners,  (iv)  fully  participatory  and  transparent  implementation  including \ndisclosure  of  financial  information,  (v)  mobilizing  strong  community  support  and  trust  in  the \nproject staff, and (vi) encouraging local employment under Project contracts. \n \n                                                 \n41  A  48%  tariff  nominal  increase  would  be  required  to  achieve  this  objective  by  2007.  Alternatively,  nominal  tariff \nincreases of 20% in 2007, 15% in 2008, and 15% in 2009 would allow NWSDB to have a positive balance sheet by \n2010, when project schemes will be completed. \n\n\fEconomic  Growth  and  Financial  Viability.  The  Project  assumes  that  the  country\u2019s \n66. \neconomy will continue to develop. The financial viability of each water supply scheme continues \nto  hinge  on  tariff  revision  over  the  construction  and  design  period.  To  ensure  the  financial \nviability of each water supply scheme, a real increase in tariff is required for average and two \nlowest  consumer  slabs.  The  financial  viability  of  the  Project  assumes  revisions  to  the  national \nwater  supply  tariff  by  NWSDB  to  cover  O&M  of  the  project  schemes,  and,  in  agreement  with \nnational policy, debt service and depreciation for all schemes in the country. \n \n67. \nReduced  Competition.  Given  accessibility  conditions,  few  contractors  may  express \ninterest  in  proposed  packages,  potentially  resulting  in  collusion  among  these.  Ensuring  that \ntenders are widely advertised in Sri Lanka and overseas may be partially offset this risk. \n \n68. \nPersonnel  Turnover.  As  a  result  of  the  tsunami  reconstruction  boom,  the  project \nmanagement  structure  has  seen  fast  turnover  of  personnel.  NWSDB\u2019s  new  salary  increase \npolicy and gradually reducing reconstruction activity is likely to lead to more stable conditions. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n69. \nIn addition to the standard assurances and assurances set forth in the Loan Agreement \n(Special Operations) of 18 August 2003 between the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka \nand  ADB,  and  the  Project  Agreement  of  even  date  between  NWSDB  and  ADB,  both  for  the \nSecondary  Towns  and  Rural  Community-Based  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Project,  the \nGovernment  and  NWSDB  have  given  the  following  assurances,  which  are  incorporated  in  the \nlegal documents: \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(a) \n\nin  accordance  with \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  National \n\nThe Government will ensure that during each year of the project implementation, \nadequate  budgetary  allocations  of  required  counterpart  funds  will  be  made  and \nreleased  by  the  relevant  authorities  on  a  timely  and  regular  basis  by  31 \nDecember. \nThe Government and NWSDB will ensure (and NWSDB will obtain Government \nassurance  from  the  Land  Acquisition  Section)  that  all  land,  land  rights,  rights-of \nway, and other land-related rights, and all water and water-related rights for the \nProject are acquired and the payment of replacement costs for land acquired is \nmade \nInvoluntary \nResettlement Policy (2001); (b) ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995); \n(c) the short resettlement plans for the Project; and (d) the agreed compensation \nplan  for  the  Project.

Wild  Life  Department  clearance  awaited.  Construction  of  staff  quarters  and \noffices completed. \n \nWater  rights  were  obtained  from  ID  in  2002  (MOU  signed  between  NWSDB  and  ID  on  24  October  2002)  for  Parakrama \nSamudaya and Mahaweli riverbank boreholes, as proposed at appraisal. However, following farmers\u2019 objection in 2003, ID \nreverted  the  joint  agreement  and  alternative  sources  had  to  be  identified.  The  only  sustainable  source  identified  is  the \nMahaweli River. At the request of NWSDB, new groundwater investigations were being undertaken to ascertain or reject the \nviability  of  this  option.  Full  groundwater  assessment  (including  full  long-term  sustainability  of  this  option)  completed  by \nNWSDB\u2019s Groundwater Section in June 2006 and submitted to ADB for review. Tests demonstrate that the required yield \ncan be obtained but sustainability cannot be secured (i) over extended abstraction periods, and (ii) under the most extreme \nseasonal  conditions  (including  the  end  of  the  dry  season).  The  Project  will  proceed  to  re-tendering  the  design-and-build \ncontract  with  direct  water  abstraction  from  the  Mahaweli  in  December  2006.  Design  completed;  draft  bid  documents  for \nheadworks, raw water transmission, and treatment plant to be completed on end October 2006. Bid documents for supply \nand  laying  distribution  pipes  and  elevated  towers  awaiting  government  clearance.  All  land  acquisition,  land  transfer,  and \nleases acquired for sites\u2014other than intake, which is to be confirmed following testing.    \n \nDetailed  engineering  design  for  elevated  towers  completed  in  April  2006.  Tendering  will  be  conducted  in  parallel  with  the \npackage for the construction of headworks, raw water transmission, water treatment plant, and treated water pumping main \nin the third quarter 2006.     \nConstruction of a salinity barrier has been halted as a result  of farmers\u2019 objection to inundation. Compensation to be paid \n(estimated  at  around  $10  million\u2013$12  million)  is  3\u20134  times  the  cost  of  the  structure,  making  this  option  financially  and \neconomically unviable. NWSDB has proposed to appoint a special committee to study low-cost options for Matara, possibly \nunder a different system. The Project has suspended all activities regarding this subcomponent.  \nLow-cost  latrine  program  ongoing;  a  fourth  of  these  have  been  completed  (18%  of  2,000  in  Batticaloa,  27%  of  1,500  in \nHambantota, 22% of 2,000 in Muttur, and 70% of 500 in Polonnaruwa). \n\nComponent 2: Rural Water Supply and Sanitation   \nBatch 1 \n(Pradeshiya \nshabas in \nAnuradhapura, \nPolonnaruwa and \nBatticaloa) \nBatch 2 \n\nBatch  1,  currently  under  implementation,  covers  8  PSs  in  the  districts  of  Anuradhapura,  Polonnaruwa,  and  Batticaloa. \nAppraisal and social mobilization under the program have been completed for this batch; planning and design activities have \nbeen completed in 140 GNDs in Anuradhapura,and Polonnaruwa. Tender and construction of rural water supply schemes is \nongoing  and  expected  to  be  completed  in  early  2007,  with  approximately  40%  of  the  contracts  having  been  awarded. \nSchemes  selected  by  the  communities  include  construction  of  tube  and  shallow  wells,  rainwater  harvesting,  and  pumped \nschemes.  \nSubject  to  availability  of  funds,  appraisal  of  batch  2  projects  is  anticipated  to  start  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2006  and \ninclude PSs in the districts of Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, and Batticaloa.  \n\nComponent 3: Institutional Strengthening \nTraining \n\nThe training program completed its first year of implementation (October 2004\u2013October 2005), covering training components \nfor project staff, NWSDB staff, provisional/divisional administrative staff, and CBOs. Targets for in-country training of project \nstaff have proven to be particularly successful (270% participant attendance, compared with planned numbers). Overseas \nproject  staff  training  has  only  achieved  50%  of  its  targets,  partly  due  to  restrictions  on  training  of  contractual  staff  by \nNWSDB.  To  compensate  any  potential  deficiencies,  the  PMU  has  indicated  that  discussions  with  international  academic \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n2\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n2\n\n \n\n \n \n\n2\n3\n\n \n\n\f \n\nComponent \n\nNational Public \nAwareness and \nEducation \nCampaign \nNWSDB Financial \nand Operational \nImprovement \nSupport \n\n  \n\nStatus of Implementation \ninstitutions are currently ongoing with international academic institutions such as the Asian Institute of Technology to develop \nand deliver engineering and project management courses in country. Progress on training in support of rural water supply \nprograms  has  met  all  targets.  However,  NWSDB  staff  in-country  training  has  been  delayed:  only  29%  of  the  programs \nplanned  have  been  delivered  to  date  and  18%  of  the  total  number  of  participants  have  received  training\u2014partly  because \npriorities have changed after the tsunami. \nThe program includes national awareness (governance, social marketing, media communication, and education) and project \nawareness  (public  gatherings,  information  dissemination,  and  public  announcement)  components.  Content  and  media  for \ndifferent programs have been selected. Materials and campaigns have produced and delivered for the rural water supply and \nurban sanitation components. \nAlthough  delayed  about  9\u201312  months,  the  proposed  NWSDB  corporate  strategy  support  component  is  currently  under \nimplementation.  Approval  of  the  financial  and  operational  improvement  support  program  was  obtained  in  June  2005  and \nNWSDB  is  monitoring  its  implementation  quarterly.  Loan  funds  to  support  the  financial  management  and  operational \nimprovement program have been specifically allocated to a selected number of activities, including the following. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nA  financial  management  program:  (a)  introduction  of  corrective  measures  to  reduce  accounting  errors  and \ndeficiencies (to be completed in October 2006), (b) introduction of an integrated computer management system \nallowing tracking of debtors and stocks (to be completed in December 2006), and (c) valuation of asset registry \n(to be completed by 4 quarter 2006). \nAn operational efficiency plan to reduce O&M costs is under implementation, including: (a) an ongoing training \ncomponent;  (b)  enhancing  collection  performance  and  customer  satisfaction  through  upgrading  of  computer \nhardware  and  the  introduction  of  computer-assisted  bill  receiving  cashier  points;  (c)  reducing  power \nconsumption  through  improved  plant  efficiency,  introduction  of  energy  saving  measures,  and  supply  and \ninstallation of equipment to reduce energy losses; and (d) improving institutional (technical) capacity for repairs \nand maintenance. \nA  small  non-revenue  water  component  is  under  implementation  but  activities  are  generally  limited  to  the \nreplacement of  defective  piping. While  other  ongoing  projects  may  be  providing support  to  non-revenue  water \ndevelopment, it is essential that preventive programs and the use of diagnosis tools be institutionalized. \nThe program for reduction of power consumption has been particularly successful despite the limited allocation \nof funds, including training engineers in all regional support centers and continuous support from NWSDB offices \nin  Colombo.  ADB\u2019s  project  funds  (SLRs15  million)  are  to  be  allocated  to  proposed  scheme  improvements  in \nAnuradhapura. For all these schemes, power efficiency targets have been set and the repayment time has been \nevaluated, showing immediate net benefit gains. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, CBO = community-based organization, CEA = Central Environmental Authority, DI = ductile iron; GND = Grama Nilathari Division, \nICB = international competitive bidding, ID = Irrigation Department, MOU = memorandum of understanding, mm = milimiters, NCB = national competitive bidding, \nNWSDB = National Water Supply and Drainage Board, O&M = operation and maintenance, PMU = project management unit, PS = Pradeshiya Sabha. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates \n\n \n\n2\n4\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n2\n \n\ni\n\n \n\nA\n\n\f            Appendix 3       \n\n25\n\nCOMPLIANCE WITH LOAN COVENANTS \n\nCovenant \n\nStatus of Compliance \n\n \n\n \n\nReference in \nLoan \nAgreement \nA.

The  cost  overrun  of  the  urban  component, \n2. \ncaused  by  cost  escalation,  is  summarized  in  Table  A5.2.  The  revised  cost  (2006)  in  SLRs  is \nestimated to be 66% (base cost) larger that that estimated at appraisal. However, given partial \ncurrency depreciation,1 the actual over the (2002-2006) period cost increase is computed to be \nonly 54% greater than at appraisal or caused by price escalation ranges from 48% and 64% of \nthe base cost for all four towns (US dollar base). The difference arises from the following: (i) the \nnature  of  the  components  proposed  under  the  original  design;  (ii)  the  change  in  unit  price  in \ninternational markets, as is the case of Muttur, where the original design proposed a relatively \nlarge number of pumps and other electromechanical equipment, and (iii) change in demand for \nspecific services, equipment and materials.  \n                                                 \n1   At appraisal (November 2002), the currency exchange was $1 = SLRs96.5; at present, $1 = SLRs103.5.  \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                                 Appendix 5    \n\n33\n\n \n\nTable A5.2: Cost Overrun Caused by Price Escalation \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPart A \u2013 in Absolute SLRs \nUrban Component \n\nMuttur Water Supply \nHambantota Water Supply \nPolonaruwa Water Supply \nBatticaloa Water Supply \n              Total \n\nPart B \u2013 Adjusted for \nCurrency Devaluation \nUrban Component \n\nMuttur Water Supply \nHambantota Water Supply \nPolonaruwa Water Supply \nBatticaloa Water Supply \nTotal \n \n\n% Difference \n(NWSDB price) \n73 \n57 \n70 \n67 \n66 \n\nOriginal Design \n\nNWSDB (2001) Rates \n(SLRs) \n467,884,000 \n941,874,440 \n470,931,500 \n2,133,761,500 \n4,014,451,440 \n\nOriginal Design \n\nNWSDB (2006) Rates \n(SLRs) \n811,044,728 \n1,475,500,441 \n800,910,600 \n3,559,961,280 \n6,647,417,049 \n\n% Difference  \n(NWSDB price) \n\nNWSDB (2001) Rates \n($) \n\nNWSDB (2006) Rates \n($) \n\n64 \n48 \n60 \n57 \n56 \n\n4,861,132 \n9,785,708 \n4,892,795 \n22,168,951 \n41,708,586 \n\n7,951,419 \n14,465,691 \n7,852,065 \n34,901,581 \n65,170,756 \n\nNWSDB = National Water Supply and Drainage Board  \nNote: Values are for base cost, excluding taxes and contingencies. \nAll prices estimated in SLRs.

This is consistent with data presented in Table A5.3 and \nmay  be  partly  because  NWSDB  rates  are  established  annually  based  on  packages  awarded \nduring  the  previous  year.  This  would  not  normally  be  significant,  but  recent  years  have  seen \nunusually high increases that have substantially affected estimates. The assessment conducted \non  the  revised  design\u2014comparing  the  use  of  NWSDB  (2006)  versus  market  (2006)  rates3\u2014is \nless conclusive in terms of components. However, overall, NWSDB (2006) rates are about 23% \nbelow market rates.  \n \nCost  Overrun  due  to  Physical  Changes.  Design  modifications  were  introduced \n6. \nfollowing completion of hydrological, water quality, topographical, geotechnical, inundation, and \nenvironmental  surveys.  Depending  on  the  subproject  town,  the  surveys  indicated  the  need  to \n(i) resize intake structures; (ii) revise electromechanical arrangements and, consequently, piping \nmaterial; (iii) provide full conventional water treatment; and (iv) provide adequate foundations to \novercome  potential  land  subsidence,  in  the  case  of  Muttur.  Such  changes  were  introduced  to \nensure that: (i) required drinking water quality levels are achieved in accordance with national \nand World Health Organization standards; (ii) water quantity under the Project is sufficient and \nextracted  at  sustainable  rates  (and  associated  changes  in  intake);  and  (iii)  full  compliance  is \nsecured  with  safety  requirements,  and  environment  and  social  safeguards.  The  cost  overrun, \nbased  on  NWSDB  (2006)  rates,  caused  by  physical  changes  in  each  town,  is  summarized  in \nTable A5.5. \n \n7. \nTable  A.5.5  shows  that  the  compound  percentage  difference  in  design  (defined  as  the \npercentage change incurred by incorporating physical changes in the project) is 25%, based on \n2006  rates.  The  cost  overrun,  compared  with  cost  deviations  from  the  original  appraisal,  is \naround 20% of the base cost.

Precise  design  was  not  conducted  at \nfeasibility;  instead  sample  subprojects  were  utilized  to  conduct  projections.  New  estimates  for \nthis  component  are  based  on  ongoing  subprojects  for  batch  1  and  associated  projections  for \nbatch 2.  The  increase  in  costs  has  been  partially  offset  by  the  following  facts:  (i)  original \nestimates (September 2002) for this component were above estimates computed using NWSDB \nrates for 2001 ($10 million instead of $7.5 million), making it a more expensive proposal at that \ntime; and (ii) activities have been redesigned for cost-efficiency, minimizing capital expenditure \nwhile optimizing operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. The resulting cost overrun has been \ncontained  at  38%,  which  correlates  with  price  escalation  and  inflation.  Labor  rates  have \nsignificantly  increased  as  a  result  of  high  demand  in  the  post-tsunami  reconstruction  process. \nHowever,  the  overrun  for  this  component  has  also  been  largely  contained  as  a  result  of \ncommunities being responsible for providing unskilled labor for civil works. \n \nC. \n \n9. \nmonths  of  supervision  consultants,  and \nimplementation unit (PIU) salaries and running costs. \n \nSupervision  Consultancy.  With  regard  to  design  and  supervision  consultants,  at  the \n10. \nfeasibility  stage,  supervision  staff  was  analyzed  on  a  subproject  basis  as  the  exact  work  and \npackaging  under  the  contracts  was  uncertain.  The  number  of  supervision  engineers  and \nassistant  supervision  engineers  was  minimized,  and  has  been  found  to  be  insufficient  to \nimplement the Project in a timely manner in four geographically dispersed project towns at the \nsame  time.  It  was  suggested/expected  that  the  supervision  person-months  deficit  could  be \nfulfilled with Executing Agency staff, but this has not proven possible given: (i) multiple NWSDB \ncommitments  in  the  post-tsunami  reconstruction  process;  (ii)  an  NWSDB  \u201cfreeze\u201d  (or \nminimization) on recruitment; and (iii) operation in \u201cdifficult\u201d areas attracting a smaller number of \nskilled  staff,  often  at  additional  premium  rates.  Additional  supervision  consulting  requirements \nare estimated at about 1,500 person-months of national consultants. The expected cost overrun \ncaused by additional consulting requirements is the source of 2% of the cost overrun. \n \n11. \nGovernment  Incremental  Costs.  The  PMU  informed  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  that  the  reasons  for  the  50%  increase  in  cost  estimate  from  $2.4 million  to  $3.6  million \nincluded an increase of 40% in NWSDB staff salaries during 2003/04 and a further 10% in 2004. \nFew  additional  staff  resources  (compensation  officer  in  Batticaloa,  two  environment  officers) \nhave been recruited for smooth implementation.

The breakdown, provided by the PMU, is \nin Table A5.6. \n\n \nTable A5.6: Summary Budgetary Requirements  \n\n2004 \n\n \n \nItem \nSalaries and Related \nExpenses \nAdministrative Expenditure \n \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n  8,844 \n \n21,901 \n\n13,057 \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n2007 \n(SLRs \u2019000) \n32,102 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\nTotal  \n\n19,287 \n\n27,348 \n\n33,546 \n\n50,059 \n\n175,399 \n\n13,057 \n\n33,729 \n\n37,102 \n\n40,812 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n32,344 \n\n61,077 \n\n69,204 \n\n74,358 \n\n51,057 \n\n \n101,116 \n\n184,601 \n \n360,000 \n\nTaxes and Duties \n\nD. \n \n12. \nBased  on  recent  computations  (Supplementary  Appendix  E)  for  feasibility  and  current \ndesigns, duties calculated at appraisal for the original project may have been miscalculated and \nunderestimated  at  appraisal.  Total  taxes  and  duties  calculated  at  appraisal  were  estimated  at \n$7.6  million.  However,  taxes  and  duties  at  feasibility  (exclusively  for  the  urban  component) \nshould have been $17.3 million instead and may have resulted from the accidental omission of \nGovernment and Service Tax/Value Added Tax. For the original design, the total value for taxes \nand duties would have remained largely unchanged over the 2001-2006. Moreover, the change \nin  design  would  have  left  taxes  and  duties  contributions  largely  unchanged,  but  updating  for \nmarket  prices  would  have  resulted  in  an  overall  11%  increase.  Financing  for  additional  taxes \nand  duties  will  remain  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  counterpart  contribution  under  the  proposed \nsupplementary loans. The financing gap for taxes and duties is estimated at $15 million for the \nentire of the Project, or 200% increase from original calculations ($7.6 million). Overall, it must \nbe  however  noted  that  taxes  would  appear  to  have  decreased  (as  a  percentage  of  the  total \namount) over the period of implementation.      \n \nE. \n \n13. \nTable A5.7 summarizes cost escalation by component and cause. The main component \nsubject to cost overrun  is the urban water supply and sanitation component. Major  causes for \nthe cost overrun include: (i) price escalation (36%), (ii) undercosting at appraisal (24%), and (iii) \nphysical changes (21%).   \n\nSummary \n\n \nTable A5.7: Summary Cost Overrun Evaluation \n\nCost Increase ($ million) \n\n \n \nComponent \nUrban Component \nRural Component \nInstitutional Strengthening \nProject Management \nTotal \n \n              % \n\n89 \n7 \n0.0 \n4 \nn/a \n100 \n16.5 \n \n21 \nNote: Cost overrun is calculated from base cost + taxes.

So, civil works for water intakes have been resized for a 45 year horizon. \nIntake  and  Treatment.  Intake  civil  structure  sized  from  31,500  m3/day  to  120,000  m3/day.  As  part  of  the  Government\u2019s \npriority  actions  to  rapidly  provide  water  to  tsunami-affected  resettlements,  water  treated  in  existing  plant  (7,500  m3/day) \nshould be supplemented by a water treatment plant sponsored by the Government of Austria that produces 7,500 m3/day . \nThe  water  treatment  plant  financed  by  ADB  has  been  resized  to  provide  15,000  m3/day.  Electromechanical  works  and \nreservoirs are to be constructed to serve all 3 plants. A Single (600 mm diameter) raw water main has been replaced by 2 x \n300 mm water mains for the Government of Austria-financed and existing water treatment plants, and a 500 mm diameter \nDI for the new plant. Given land restrictions within the site, a mechanical sludge dewatering system is required instead of \nlagoons/sludge drying beds.  \n \nWater Distribution. As a result of an increase in the diameter of transmission mains, and to withstand internal pressure, \npiping material has been changed from PVC to DI in various sections. A 500 mm DI treated water transmission main from \nAmbalantota  to  Mirijjawila  has  been  separated  from  the  main  package.  Extension  to  the  distribution  system  required \naccommodation/modification of service areas after the tsunami and the introduction of a coastal protection buffer zone. \nSource (Unnichchai tank) sustainability and security of supply was checked during feasibility, and confirmed during detailed \ndesign. Detailed engineering design demonstrated that expansion of the tank\u2019s capacity only required raising the dam wall \nby 5.0 feet instead of 7.5 feet, as initially indicated at feasibility; consequent size reduction of the water intake would result \nfrom  change  in  design  capacity  and  concept  using  submersible  pumps.  The  access  bridge  from  the  intake  well  to  the \nabutment of the tank was newly accommodated for pump maintenance.  \n \nWater Treatment. Following a monthly monitoring program, which included testing for algae (and potentially toxic strains of \nblue-green algae), the water treatment plant design had to be modified to include treatment against the potential seasonal \npresence of cyanobacteria. The water treatment plant will now include dissolved air floatation activated carbon adsorption \n(PAC) and chlorination. In addition, sludge lagoons had to be incorporated into the design of the plant. The capacity of the \nwater treatment plant reduced from 54,000 cum/day to 40,000 cum/day after reassessment of non-revenue water.  \n \nTransmission  Mains.  Following  geotechnical  investigations,  which  indicated  the  presence  of  hard  rock  near  the  road \nsurface, partial rock excavation for casing of the raw water transmission mains will be required in several selected sections. \nTreated water transmission mains will be encased in cement structures and laid across the lagoons instead of anchored on \nexisting bridges, given their precarious conditions and their location in security sensitive areas.  \n \nDistribution  Network.  The  viability  of  electromechanical  works  was  reviewed  and  modified,  resulting  in  requirements  of \none  additional  pumping  station  and  one  additional  groundwater  reservoir.  Distribution  systems  were  reviewed  to \naccommodate  tsunami  resettlement  area  demands.  The  number  of  distribution  pumps  increased  from  (2+1  stand  by)  to \n(4+2 standby). The total number of elevated towers remains the same, but capacity has been increased by 50%. The total \nsize of the distribution network was reevaluated since feasibility, requiring 40% additional length (from 183 km to 261 km).  \n\nBatticaloa Water \nSupply Scheme \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTechnical Assessment and Changes since Appraisal \nNo significant changes. Package treatment plant for hospital and prison proposed at appraisal. Sewerage system designed \nto  include  extended  aeration  activated  sludge  process  package  wastewater  treatment  plant  (3,500  people)  with  effluent \ndischarge to lagoon, and waste sludge to CEA approved land disposal area.    \nNo  details  for  the  drainage  scheme  were  presented  at  the  feasibility  stage.  Priority  areas  are  in  the  process  of  being \nidentified  and  defined.  Drainage  works  proposed  along  25  streets  (21  km);  additional  drainage  for  Arayampathy  (10  km) \nand Kattankudy (21 streets, 10 km) is under consideration.  \nSource.  Required  reestablishment  of  intake  1.5  km  downstream.  Since  the  location  is  in  the  flood  plain,  and  flood-free \naccess  is  to  be  provided,  intake  was  modified  after  incorporating  the  following  in  the  design:  (i)  silt  and  sand  removal \nfeatures  in  the  intake  channel,  (ii)  fencing  and  protection  from  and  for  surrounding  wildlife,  (iii)  access  bridge,  (iv)  bank \nprotection against erosion, and (v) site elevation against flooding and drainage. The civil structure was designed for ultimate \nflow of 40,000 cum/day. \n \nWater Plant treatment capacity reduced by 20% and treated water storage capacity of 3000 cum provided. Sludge drying \nbeds adopted as land for lagoons not available. Based on findings reported in geotechnical investigations, highlighting poor \nsubsoil condition, elevated towers design was modified to incorporate pile foundations, while the water treatment plant is to \nbe constructed on piles. Number of elevated towers reduced from three to two.  \nPriority areas are in the process of being identified and defined. Drainage works are proposed along 15 streets (16 km).  \nSource.  Investigations  conducted  during  project  preparation  proposed  a  combination  of:  (i)  augmented  extraction  for \ndrinking  water  supply  purposes  from  Parakrama  Samudra  irrigation  tank,  and  (ii)  extraction  from  Mahaweli  Ganga  (river) \nAlluvium  (through  boreholes).  Although  the  preliminary  design\u2014recommended  and  agreed with  the  Irrigation Department \n(through an MOU)\u2014proposed water extraction to be sourced from the Parakrama Samudra tank, the agreement was later \ncontested because of farmers\u2019 objections after severe drought conditions in 2003. A revised option for extraction from the \nMahaweli requires an increase in the size of the intake to accommodate an extractive capacity of 30,500 cum/day, including \nsilt removal features and additional pumping from this location 5\u20137 km away. \n \nTreatment  and  Transmission.  Raw  water  transmission  mains  required  an  increase  in  size  from  200  mm  to  500  mm \ndiameter. Consequently, materials had to be modified from PVC to ductile iron, while the length increased from 3.0 km to \n4.1 km. Given the change in the quality of water at source, the water treatment process changed from chlorination to full \ntreatment. Two treated water transmission lines to feed into two elevated towers. No changes in the number of towers or \ndistribution coverage.   \nA solution to farmers\u2019 opposition following appraisal has not been found. Estimated compensation for the scheme would be \nthree times the cost of the subproject, making it economically and financially unviable. \n\nMatara Salinity \nBarrier \nComponent 2: Rural Water Supply and Sanitation \nWater Supply \nSchemes \n\nIn view of the extreme poverty conditions affecting the area surrounding Unnichchai tank in Batticaloa District, it was agreed \nthat PSs in the area benefit from this component. As part of the first batch implementation, two PSs in Batticaloa received \nsupport for the Project, in addition to three PSs in Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa.  \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, DI = ductile iron, km = kilometer, m3 = cubic meter, mm = millimeters, MOU = memorandum of understanding, PAC = powered \nactivated carbon, PS = Pradeshiya Sabha, PVC = polyvinyl chloride. \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n\n \n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n6\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n3\n9\n\n \n\nSubproject \nBatticaloa Hospital \nand Prison \nSewerage \nBatticaloa \nDrainage \n \nMuttur Water \nSupply Scheme \n\nMuttur Drainage \nPolonnaruwa \nWater Supply \nScheme \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nEXECUTING AGENCY CAPACITY ASSESSMENT \n \n\nIntroduction \n\nOrganizational Structure \n\nA. \n \nThe Secondary Towns and Rural Community-Based Water Supply and Sanitation Project \n1. \nwas  approved  on  16  January  2003.  Since  loan  effectiveness,  the  Project  has  established  1 \nproject  management  unit  (PMU),  5  project  implementation  units  (PIUs),  and  9  Pradeshiya \nShaba  (PS)  implementation  units  (PSIUs)  which  are  supported  by  technical  support  units \n(TSUs).  Given  geographical  considerations,  the  PMU  was  established  in  Colombo,  providing \nsupport  countrywide.  Four  of  the  PIUs  are  located  in  each  of  the  project  towns  (Batticaloa, \nHambantota, Polonnaruwa, and Muttur). They provide support to all activities undertaken in their \nrespective  districts  but  mainly  focus  on  construction  and  implementation  of  the  urban \ncomponent. The fifth PIU, of specific technical nature, is housed in the Irrigation Department for \nthe  purpose  of  designing,  coordinating,  and  implementing  the  Unnichchai  tank  augmentation \nworks.  To  date,  PSIUs  have  been  created  in  each  of  the  8  PSs  (4  in  Anuradhapura,  3  in \nPolonnaruwa, and 1 in Batticaloa) selected for implementation of activities under batch 1 of the \nrural  component.  Further,  6  PSIUs  are  envisaged  to  be  created  in  support  of  activities  to  be \nimplemented under batch 2. While fulfilling different roles, PIUs and TSUs are housed within the \nsame offices in Polonnaruwa and Batticaloa, providing efficient complementary support. \n \nB.  \n \n2. \nThe organization of the Project is well laid out, and functions and responsibilities of the \nPMU  staff  are  clearly  defined  in  the  job  descriptions  prepared  for  the  Project.  The  PMU  is \nstaffed  by  a  mix  of  National  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Board  (NWSDB)  positions  (project \ndirector, deputy project director, project accountant, an engineer, and supporting staff). This is \nsupported by specific project staff (3 engineers, sociologist, assistant engineer, and supporting \nstaff),  a  project  management  consultant  team,  and  a  design  and  supervision  consultant  team. \nThe consulting teams provide support to PIUs and PSIUs, and their location can be in any of the \nunits, depending on support needs and other requirements. Similarly, each of the PIUs/TSUs is \nstaffed  with  a  combination  of  NWSDB  and  project-specific  staff  (including  project  managers, \naccountants, engineers, engineer assistants, sociologists, and support staff). PSIUs, in assisting \ncommunity-based  organizations  (CBOs)  implement  the  rural  component,  consist  of  engineers \nand community development specialists. The total current technical staff amounts to 52 for the \nentire Project and 39 support staff. \n \nC.  \n \n3. \nNWSDB  retains  its  mandate,  as  defined  in  the  1974  National  Water  Supply  and \nDrainage  Board  Act,  under  the  recently  created  Ministry  of  Urban  Development  and  Water \nSupply  (MUDWS).  NWSDB  has  a  mandate:  (i)  to  develop,  operate,  and  control  an  efficient, \ncoordinated  water  supply  and  to  distribute  water  for  public,  domestic, and  industrial  purposes; \n(ii) to establish, develop, operate, and control an efficient, coordinated sewerage system; (iii) to \ntake  over  and  carry  on  any  water  supply  or  sewerage  undertaking  of  any  local  authority \ntransferred  to  NWSDB  either  by  a  voluntary  transfer  order  or  by  a  compulsory  transfer  order; \nand (iv) to provide a supply of water and distribute or sell water in bulk or otherwise to any local \nauthority, any government department, any other institution or organization, or any individual. \n \nD. \n \n4. \nNWSDB has implemented numerous projects assisted by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB),  World  Bank,  and  other  bilateral  aid  partners.  At  present,  ongoing  projects  for  NWSDB \n\nExecuting Agency\u2019s Mandate  \n\nImplementation Capacity  \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                 Appendix 7 \n\n \n\n41\n\n \n\nto \n\ntargets \n\nreduce  staff-to-connection \n\nalone  are  valued  at  SLRs67,956  million  ($672.83  million),  of  which  70%  are  foreign-funded, \nincluding two ADB-funded projects. In addition to this Project, NWSDB has implemented three \nprevious  ADB  projects,  two  of  which  have  been  completed,  evaluated,  and  rated  generally \nsuccessful  in  the  project  completion  report.  Despite  the  increasing  number  of  projects  being \nimplemented,  NWSDB\u2019s  implementation  capacity  remains  adequate.  Moreover,  in  an  effort  to \nimprove its operational performance and efficiency, NWSDB has introduced a human resources \nincentive  program  and  a  strategy  with \nratios. \nConsequently, recruitment of permanent staff is carefully monitored, and often combined with a \nprogram of recruitment of contractual staff, supporting several of its ongoing projects.  \n \nHowever, consistent with ADB\u2019s evaluation,1 the balanced combination of NWSDB long-\n5. \nterm  staff  and  recruitment  of  contractual  staff  has  yielded  a  generally  efficient  arrangement  of \nPMU  and  PIUs,  with  individual  focused  tasks  and  deliverables.  The  use  of  external  staff  has \nbrought  the  Project  a  new  influx  of  external  influences,  based  on  varying  experiences  outside \nthe  Executing  Agency  (EA).  It  is  also  important  to  indicate  that  this  Project  will  provide  water \nsupply  schemes  in  two  towns  and  augment  water  supplies  in  two  further  towns.  Water  supply \nand  sanitation  available  staff  in  all  four  towns  is  currently  scarce.  Although  interaction  with \nexisting  staff  is  active,  the  project  strategy  envisages  the  conversion  of  temporary  staff  in  the \nPIUs into permanent staff to be trained by the contractor in operation and maintenance.  \n \nThe  Project  provides  an  important  component  aimed  at  improving  and  developing \n6. \ncapacity at all levels (NWSDB, Project, and CBOs). This component is at an advanced stage of \nimplementation and, combined with the public awareness exercise being conducted under the \nProject, is expected to allow the Project to achieve capacity development targets at individual, \norganizational,  and  sector  level.  Early  benefits  have  been  reported  by  NWSDB  as  having \nsupported the delivery of proposed targets for improved operational and financial performance \nunder  the  NWSDB  corporate  strategy.2  An  assessment  of  NWSDB\u2019s  financial  management \ncapacity is in Supplementary Appendix N. \n \nE.  \n \n7. \nStaffing. The main concern of the Project is on fast turnover of personnel. The Project \ncontinues  to  lose  local  staff,  particularly  in  the  PIUs,  to  tsunami-related  projects.  Many \ncommunity  development  workers  have  left  to  work  in  emergency  projects  that  offered  higher \nsalaries  than  the  Project.  This  has  given  rise  to  other  problems  such  as  delays  in  project \nidentification and social preparation because of the lack of local community staff.  The Project\u2019s \nfinance unit also lost several staff and is currently recruiting six more personnel to be fielded in \nthe PMU and the PIUs. The recruitment process is long and slow, since even clerical positions \nneed the approval of the Ministry of Finance. The appointments of project staff, except for the \nkey positions, are on a contractual basis and are renewed annually. \n \nFinancial  Reports  and  Audited  Arrangements.  Financial  reports  prepared  by  the \n8. \nProject consist of a balance sheet and related statement of expenditures. Reports are prepared \non  time  and  the  audited  reports  for  2005  were  submitted  in  April  2006,  ahead  of  schedule \n(September 30 of each fiscal year). Except for some minor findings and recommendations that \nare included to enhance further the financial management of the Project, the overall audit report \non the project is satisfactory. The project accounts are audited annually by the Auditor General\u2019s \n(government body) office during February and March. NWSDB also conducts periodic audits of \nthe project accounts through its Internal Audit Unit.    \n \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2005. Special Evaluation Study.

Colombo. \n\nPMU Financial Management Capacity \u2013 Financial Management Systems \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nAccounting  System.  The  Project  uses  a  computerized  financial  accounting  system, \n9. \nMSL accounting package, which was procured locally in Sri Lanka. The same system was used \nin  the  ADB-financed  Third  Water  Supply  Project.3  Based  on  demonstration  runs  requested \nduring the field audit, it was observed that the existing system works efficiently and effectively; it \nis able to generate financial reports with ease and facility.  \n \n10. \nProject  Cost  Accounting  System.  The  financial  accounting  and  reporting  system \nneeds some revision to enable cost accounting of projects by scheme. Although the entity has \nan appropriate system that allows recording by sources of funds and disbursement categories, \nthe project costs are not systematically recorded by components. When a project is completed, \nit  is  difficult  to  classify  the  construction  work  in  progress  into  specific  property,  plant,  and \nequipment accounts. This was one of the findings in the 31 December 2005 audit report. In its \nresponse of 14 June 2006, the PMU, through NWSDB, has committed to improve on this finding \nimmediately where it indicated that it has begun efforts to amend the MSL accounting package. \n \n11. \nDisbursements  and  Funds  Flow  System.  The  Project\u2019s  disbursement  system \ncomplies  strictly  with  ADB  disbursement  guidelines.  It  maintains  a  first  generation  imprest \naccount  with  the  Central  Bank  and  second  generation  imprest  accounts  with  the  provincial \nbranches  of  the  People\u2019s  Bank  in  Annuradhapura,  Polonaruwa,  Katubedda,  and  Baticaloa  to \nmake  payments  in  the  PIUs.  The  disbursement  and  fund  flow  systems  are  well  defined  and \nappropriate,  and  allow  for  the  timely  disbursement  of  project  funds.  There  is  sufficient  control \nover  disbursements.  Levels  of  authority  for  approval  of  payments  and  signatories  to  check \nvouchers  are  clearly  defined  at  PIUs  and  the  PMU.  The  majority  of  disbursements  are \nprocessed in the PMU; only minor disbursements are allowed for payments to the PIUs. A minor \nconcern over the disbursement system relates to the manual processing of payment vouchers. \nSubstantial  work  on  processing  of  disbursements  could  be  reduced  if  the  vouchers  were \ngenerated with the MSL accounting package.      \n \nF.  \n \n12 \nNWSDB\u2019s capacity to undertake the procurement envisaged under the Project has been \nproven  satisfactory  based  on  previous  experience  and  ongoing  project  activities.  Under  the \ncurrent  arrangements,  the  PMU  is  tasked  with  the  preparation  of  the  majority  of  detailed \nengineering  designs  and  bidding  documents.  The  project  director  and  deputy  project  director \nhave  long-standing  experience  in  performing  and  review  of  documents,  and  are  supported  by \nPMU engineers and a procurement specialist. The documents are then submitted to the Cabinet \nAppointed Tender Committee (CATB) or Ministry Tender Board and ADB for review, while bid \nevaluation is conducted by a CATB-appointed Tender Evaluation Committee. The PMU, through \nreports  prepared  semiannually  coinciding  with  the  project  joint  review  missions,  updates  the \nexisting  procurement  plan,  containing  all  milestone  dates,  and  discusses  any  variations  or \ndeviations from it. The latest version (September 2006) is in Supplementary Appendix J. While \nthe procurement capacity of NWSDB and the PMU are satisfactory, bid evaluation reports often \ndo  not  meet  requirements  outlined  in  ADB\u2019s  Guide  on  Bid  Evaluation  on  first  submission.4  To \novercome  this  problem,  the  PMU  organized  a  series  of  training  seminars  in  May  2006  on  bid \nevaluation for members of the Tender Evaluation Committee. \n\nCapacity to Undertake Procurement  \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB.  1997.

A short resettlement plan \n(RP)  was  prepared  by  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)\u2014the  National  Water  Supply  and  Drainage \nBoard  (NWSDB)\u2014in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  National  Involuntary  Resettlement \nPolicy,  2001,  and  the  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB).1 The RP had two parts: (i) addressing temporary loss of livelihood for farmers, laborers, \nand fishers affected by lowering water levels in the Unnichchai tank during tank augmentation; \nand (ii) addressing resettlement impacts caused by the permanent acquisition of 10.0 hectares \n(ha)  of  land,  of  which  NWSDB  owns  1.1  ha,  the  Government  owns  7.5  ha,  and  private \nindividuals own 1.4 ha. \n \nSupplementary financing has been requested by the Government because of significant \n2. \ncost  overruns.  The  causes  of \ninflation, \n(ii) underestimation  of  costs  in  conflict-affected  areas,  (iii)  changes  in  project  design,  and \n(iv) partial delays in project implementation resulting from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The \ncurrent  project  design  will  have  the  same  impacts  on  the  temporary  loss  of  livelihood  for \nfarmers,  laborers,  and  fishers  affected  by  lowering  water  levels  in  the  Unnichchai  tank  during \ntank augmentation. The compensation plan is available on the ADB website, and the summary \nprovided  in  the  report  and  recommendation  of  the  President  (RRP)  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix  G.  There  are  no  changes  in  the  resettlement  impact  for  lowering  levels  in  the \nUnnichchai  tank,  so  the  existing  compensation  plan  will  be  followed  to  address  the  temporary \nloss  of  livelihood.  Modifications  in  project  design  will  result  in  physical  changes  which  alter \npermanent  land  acquisition  for  the  Project.  The  revised  RP  below  addresses  the  physical \nchanges in the project design. 2 \n \nB.  \n \nThe Project avoids involuntary resettlement and minimizes impacts where unavoidable\u2014\n3. \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement,  and  the  Government\u2019s  national \ninvoluntary  resettlement  policy.  Rehabilitation  will  be  undertaken  within  existing  facilities. \nGovernment land will be used for new construction to the extent possible, and requirements for \nnew  construction  will  avoid  permanent  houses  or  structures  and  impacts  on  land.  Where \ngovernment  land  is  not  available  because  of  constraints  on  locating  treatment  plants  and \ndistribution towers (such as elevation and proximity to water sources), the acquisition of private \nland  is  required.  The  Project  ensures  the  acquisition  of  private  land  which  will  not  require \ndislocation  or  loss  of  significant  productive  assets.  Water  transmission  and  distribution  mains \nwill  be  located  in  road  rights-of-way  (ROW).  ROWs  can  accommodate  construction  activities \nand are not likely to affect people. Prior notice will be provided to all affected persons (APs) and \ntraffic  mitigation  measures  are  provided  in  the  Project\u2019s  initial  environmental  examination. \nLaying  of  water  pipelines  are  proposed  within  ROWs  and  temporary  land  acquisition  is  not \nrequired.  Minor  impacts,  which  will  be  addressed  by  contractors,  are  anticipated  during \nconstruction.  The  Project  requires  the  permanent  acquisition  of  11.70  ha  of  land,  of  which \nNWSDB owns 0.60 ha, the Government owns 9.20 ha, and private individuals own 1.94 ha.

An entitlement matrix for \nthe Project, based on the above policies and the anticipated impacts, is in Table A9.3. \n \nD. \n \n5. \nThe  original  RP  was  disclosed  to  all  APs  to  give  them  an  opportunity  to  discuss  with \nNWSDB concerns regarding the Project, and was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. Local language \nversions  of  this  summary  RP  will  be  provided  by  the  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  and \ndisclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website. \nInformation  dissemination  and  consultation  will  continue \nthroughout project implementation. Grievances of APs will first be brought to the attention of the \nPIU  and  relevant  NWSDB  resident  engineer.  Grievances  not  redressed  will  be  brought  to  the \nresettlement specialist (RS) in the project management unit (PMU); if not addressed by the RS, \nthe PMU will request the stakeholder\u2019s committee to act as grievance redress committee (GRC). \nIn consideration of the small number of APs affected by permanent land acquisition, the GRC is \nnot expected to hold regular meetings to act on grievances, but will meet only when a grievance \nis not resolved by the PMU. It will be given notice of the meeting, meet to determine the merit of \nthe grievance, and resolve the grievance within a month of receiving the notice for the meeting. \nFurther grievances will be referred by APs to appropriate courts of law.  \n \nE. \n \nAll losses will be compensated based on replacement values2 consistent with NIRP and \n6. \nADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement. The entitlement matrix further defines entitlements to \nvulnerable households. Vulnerable households will be provided additional assistance in the form \nof land-for-land replacement options with the replacement land having facilities from the Project \n(e.g.,  under  the  coverage  of  the  piped  water  system  and/or  sewerage),  preference  for \n\nCompensation \n\n                                                 \n2  Consistent with the original RP: \u201c(i) When the title to the land is clear, a government evaluation will be prepared and \nthe  negotiations  with  the  owner  will  start.  Negotiations  will  be  conducted  by  NWSDB.  (ii)  The  government \nevaluation will be based in replacement value as defined in ADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy. Titleholders will \nbe  compensated  for  all  permanent  land  losses  at  full  replacement  cost.  (iii)  NWSDB  will  approve  the  earlier \nagreement  reached  between  the  owner  and  NWSDB.  NWSDB\u2019s  legal  officer  will  execute  the  deed,  and \ncompensation  will  be  disbursed  by  the  PMU  to  the  owner  within  one  month  of  reaching  the  agreement.  (iv)  If \nagreement is not reached, NWSDB will resort to compulsory acquisition, in which the minister responsible for lands \nwill issue an order under section 2 of Lands Acquisition. In such an event, NWSDB  will comply  with the National \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy and ADB policies and ensure that replacement value is paid for the required land.\u201d \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n                                                                                                          Appendix 9 \n\n49\n\n \n\nInstitutional Framework, Resettlement Costs, and Implementation Schedule \n\nemployment in subproject activities, and short-term allowances.

A PMU in NWSDB supports the Project. PIUs in all \nsecondary  towns  are  responsible  for  day-to-day  project  implementation.  The  PMU,  through  a \nresettlement specialist, is responsible for the overall implementation and monitoring of the RP, \nand consequently for the preparation of monitoring reports. PIUs will be responsible for the day-\nto-day  implementation  and  monitoring  of  the  RP.  The  Project  has  allocated  a  budget  under \ncounterpart funding to finance the land acquisition. The PMU will be responsible for disbursing \ncompensation  within  1  month  of  reaching  a  written  agreement  with  APs.  All  land  acquisition, \nincluding  payment  of  compensation,  will  be  completed  before  civil  works  contracts  can  be \nawarded (Table A9.2). \n \n\nTable A9.2: Implementation Schedule \n \n\nActivity \n\nAPs  \n\ni.

The \nMinistry of Forestry and Environment, as the Executing Agency (EA), had overall responsibility \nfor  project  implementation.  Implementing  agencies  included  the  Forest  Department  and  the \nDepartment of Agriculture, and support from the Wildlife Department. The project\u2019s closing date \nwas 31 December 2005 with loan savings of about SDR 2,621,449 (or about $3.87 million). \n \nB. \n\nSecond Perennial Crops Development Project2 \n\n2. \nA  loan  for  $20.0  million  equivalent  (SDR14,743,000)  was  approved  by  ADB  on  25 \nSeptember 1997 to: (i) support further perennial crops development, and (ii) institute measures \nto ensure sustainability of credit facilities and extension services of perennial crops. The Ministry \nof  Agriculture  and  Lands  and  the  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  were  the  EAs.  The  project  was \ncompleted  on  30  June  2006  with \nto  SDR1,085,912  (about \n$1.60 million). \n \nC. \n\nTea Development Project3 \n\nloan  savings  amounting \n\n3. \nA  loan  for  the  Tea  Development  Project  amounting  to  $35  million  equivalent \n(SDR26,326,000) was approved by ADB on 10 November 1998. The project aimed to increase \nthe  income  of  tea  smallholders  and  private  states  on  a  sustainable  basis  and  to  improve \nenvironment  at  the  same  time.  For  this  purpose  the  project  was  to:  (i)  undertake  institutional \nreforms  to  improve  the  effectiveness  of  tea-related  institutions  and  rationalize  the  rebate  to \nbenefit  the  smaller  holdings,  (ii)  provide  credit  financing  for  replanting  and  infilling  on \nsmallholdings  and  private  states,  and  (iii)  improve  social  infrastructure.  The  project  was \ncompleted on 31 December 2005 with loan savings totaling SDR659,172 (about $0.97 million). \n \nD. \n\nWater Resources Management Project4 \n\nOn  19  September  2000,  ADB  approved  a  loan  for  SDR14,923,000  ($19.7  million \n4. \nequivalent)  for  the  Water  Resources  Management  Project  to  strengthen  the  Government's \ncapacity to manage its water resources in a sustainable, participatory, and transparent way. The \nproject  was  designed  in  two  parts:  (i)  capacity  building  to  assist  in  establishing  the  National \nWater  Resources  Authority  and  strengthening  existing  agencies  in  the  water  sector,  and  (ii) \nconstruction of urgently needed infrastructure for control and measurement of water resources. \nIn October 2004, ADB suspended part A of the loan, because of delayed legal establishment of \nthe National Water Resources Authority. The project\u2019s closing date was 30 June 2006 with loan \nsavings of about SDR 8,197,888 (or about $12.11 million). \n                                                 \n1   ADB.  1997.

During preparation and appraisal of \nthe Project, the Government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) agreed that the consulting \nservices package could be reduced from the feasibility study estimates. It was also envisaged \nthat most of the contracts would follow design-and-build contracts where need for supervision is \nlimited. Furthermore, subprojects were sequenced so that the consultants could be moved from \none  location  to  another  within  the  project  implementation  period.  However,  given  tsunami \ndelays,  a  reassessment  of  the  two  consulting  packages  under  Project  has  indicated  that \nadditional  local  supervisory  staff  is  required  for  package  B\u2014to  timely  supervise  on  going \nsimultaneous contracts in each town, which will allow meeting the projected Project completion \ndate.  \n \n2. \nOther  reasons  for  the  additional  person-months  include  the  following:  (i)  resident \nengineers, assistant resident engineers, and engineering assistant requirements are based on \norganizational needs for adequate supervision of all contracts, including three design-and-build, \nand  12  bill-of-quantity  (BOQ)  type  contracts;  (ii) BOQ  type  contracts  are  of  diverse  nature, \nincluding raw and treated water transmission, distribution mains and elevated towers, sewerage \nand  drainage  contracts;  (iii)  additional  quality  control  measures  are  recommended  during \nconstruction;  (iv)  for  Hambantota  and  Batticaloa,  additional  assistant  resident  engineers  and \nexecuting agency inputs are critical, considering the large geographic area of these contracts; \n(v)  person-month  estimates  are  based  on  the  individual  contract  durations  agreed  by  the \nProject; (vi) person-month estimates are based on 15 contracts in four project urban areas; (vii) \nBatticaloa and Muttur include supervision/support staff for drainage and sewerage.  Analysis of \nthe additional requirement is in Table A13.

The  percentage  of \npoor households fell from 18.2% to 13.4% in urban areas from 1992 to 1996. In the same period, the percentage of poor \nhouseholds declined in rural areas. Despite impressive achievements, poverty levels in Sri Lanka remain high. Poverty is \nmultifaceted and is manifested in the ability to afford basic consumption goods, and lack of access to basic needs such as \nsafe  drinking  water,  sanitation  facilities,  health  care,  and  education.  In  recent  years,  water-related  diseases  and  child \nmalnutrition have worsened. Twenty-eight percent of the population does not have access to safe drinking water and 24% \ndoes not have access to safe sanitation. There are regional variations in dimensions of poverty, with poverty levels in the \nnortheast among the highest in the nation. In some districts, including Muttur, over half of the rural population does not \nhave  access  to  safe  drinking  water  supplies.  Inadequate  sanitation  infrastructure  and  access  to  safe  drinking  water  in \nurban and rural areas are the leading causes of public health problems in poor communities. \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  2002  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  states  that  \u201cthe  provision  of  safe  drinking  water,  and  adequate \nsewage and sanitation systems, is frequently cited as the single, highest social service priority by poor households.\u201d The \nstrategy  includes  provision  of  water  to  85%  of  the  population  by  2010.  In  April  2002,  the  Government  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) signed a poverty partnership agreement that recognizes water supply and sanitation as a main \nstrategy for poverty reduction. \n \nThe proposed Project will provide safe drinking water to approximately 969,000 people and sanitation facilities to 171,500 \npeople, specifically to poor and low-income households in rural areas of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts of the \nNorth Central Province and in the towns of Batticaloa, Hambantota, Matara, Muttur, and Polonnaruwa. The Project aims \nto  improve  the  living  conditions  and  health  status  of  people  in  the  project  area\u2014specifically,  for  the  poor  and \ndisadvantaged. The table below summarizes how investment in the Project will contribute to poverty reduction. \n \n\nDirect Contribution \n \nInvestment in water infrastructure is a catalyst for \nlocal and regional development \nNone \n\nPoverty As \n\nAccess to \nincome \nAccess to \nprimary \neducation \n \nGender equality \n \n\nNone \n\nHealth \n \n\nAccess to safe \nenvironments \n\nImproved quantities and quality of domestic water \nand sanitation reduce main morbidity and mortality \nfactor for young children \n\n \n\nImproved health reduces susceptibility to anemia \nand other conditions that affect maternal mortality \nAccess to safe sanitation reduces \ndefecation on open areas and \ndomestic pollution \n\nIndirect Contribution \n \n\nImproved health for better quality water \nincreases productive capacities \nImproved school attendance from improved \nhealth and reduced water-carrying burdens, \nespecially for girls \n\nCommunity-based organizations (CBOs) for \nwater management will improve social \ncapital of women \n\n \n\nWomen reduced time and health burdens \nfrom improved water services will lead to \nmore balanced gender roles \nImproved health and reduced labor \nburdens from water portage reduce \nmortality risks for women \n \n\nMinimizing groundwater extraction \ndecreases risk of salinization and changes \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n      Appendix 14 \n\n59\n\nPoverty Analysis                                                                     Proposed Classification: General intervention \n\nB. \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nPoverty consultations carried out in Sri Lanka by the Poverty Impact Monitoring Unit on behalf of ADB indicate that the \npoor unanimously identify basic infrastructure, including water supply and sanitation, as a priority need. \n \nThe project area includes both urban and rural areas from east, south, and north central regions of the country. There has \nbeen a significant deterioration in the general economic, social, and physical conditions in the northeast region over the \npast two decades because of ethnic conflict and war; and poverty is quantitatively and qualitatively different from that in \nother  parts  of  the  country.  Although  no  official  statistics  are  available  for  this  region  because  the  security  situation  is \nunfavorable, the project socioeconomic surveys show that in Batticaloa and Muttur in the Northeast Province, poverty is \nhigher than in the rest of the country, there is a high concentration of ethnic minorities, health indicators are lower, and the \nsituation is more acute in Muttur. Therefore, 74% of the capital investment of the Project will concentrate in the northeast, \nwhere  investments  in  basic  infrastructure  have  been  suspended  for  the  last  20  years  and  poverty  is  greater.  In \nPolonnaruwa  and  Anurapurah  districts,  the  poverty  incidence  is  8%  higher  than  the  national  figurea  and  is  the  third \npoorest province based on the higher poverty line. Within the districts, poverty is higher in rural areas, which are targeted \nin the rural component. The Project will prioritize rural investments based on demand-driven and need criteria. \n \nFour  of  the  five  project  districts  are  in  the  northeast  and  north  central  regions.  In  these  four  districts,  40\u201345%  of  the \npeople  live  below  poverty  line.  Hambantota  in  the  south  has  a  high  incidence  of  drought  and  limited  groundwater. \nAlthough income levels are similar to the national average, the population has to spend more than in other parts of the \ncountry to have access to drinking water. Lack of income, employment, and water are the main concerns among the poor \nin Hambantota district. In low-density areas of Hambantota, the Project will use a community-based approach (currently \nimplemented  by  the  Third  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project)  to  reach  communities.  During  implementation, \nspecial  attention  will  be  given  to  community  participation  to  overcome  the  lack  of  trust  in  the  Government  and \nnongovernment organization (NGO) efforts.b \n \n\n   No \n\n    Yes \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \nC. \nIs there a stakeholder analysis:                      \n \nDuring  project  preparation,  the  project  components  were  discussed  with  the  stakeholders  at  various  levels.  The  rural \ncomponent  of  the  Project  requires  active  participation  of  communities.  CBOs  will  be  formed  before  subproject \nimplementation  and  will  take  responsibility  for  the  selection  of  proper  water  system  and  technology,  procurement  of \ngoods,  monitoring  of  construction,  and  contribution  to  the  capital  investment  (20%  in  kind  and/or  labor).  After \nimplementation, the CBOs will take ownership of the assets and be responsible for the operation and maintenance of the \nsystems. Local NGOs will facilitate community participation with the CBOs, supported by the Pradeshiya Sabhas. In the \nurban  components,  a  mechanism  will  be  developed  for  community  members  in  project  areas  to  bring  their  concerns \nand/or feedback regarding project implementation to the project coordination committee at the central level. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?                    \n \nD. \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe  Project  recognizes  that  women\u2019s  participation  in  decision  making  is  important,  as  they  are  providers,  users,  and \nmanagers of water at the household level. Women are the best people in a village household to ask about the quantity, \nquality,  and reliability of  water used  by her family. The Project also recognizes that communication  and interaction  with \nwomen  is  more  effective  when  done  by  other  women;  consequently,  it  is  important  to  include  women  in  the \nimplementation  team.  Therefore,  the  Project  will  actively  encourage  the  participation  of  women  as  beneficiaries  and \nimplementers. \n \nDuring  social  mobilization  at  selected  villages,  the  importance  of  women\u2019s  participation  will  be  explained  to  beneficiary \ncommunities in village meetings, hygiene education, and all other project activities. The following targets will be achieved \nin the implementation of the rural component: \n \n \n \n \n\n(i)  Project facilitators will emphasize the need to have active participation of all at community meetings, including \n50% participation by women. \n(ii) Women will account for 50% participation in small group activities. \n(iii) The executive committee of the CBOs will be at least 50% women. \n\nGender and Development \n\n   Yes            \n\n   No \n\n \n\n\f          Appendix 14 \n\n60 \n \n\n \n\n(iv)  Separate  discussions  with  women\u2019s  groups  will  take  place  regarding  technologies  and  service  level  of  the \nwater  supply  facilities  built  by  the  Project.  If  major  differences  occur  between  women\u2019s  groups  and  mixed  or \nmen\u2019s groups, the project facilitators will take an active role to prevent women's decisions being overshadowed. \n\n \n \n \n \nThe Executing Agency will actively recruit qualified women in all levels of the project implementation structure, especially \nin the rural component. The institutional strengthening component activities related to training  will specify how  women\u2019s \nparticipation will be encouraged. The following targets shall be achieved in the project implementation and the institutional \nstrengthening component: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(i)  25%  of  professional  and  technical  level  staff  working  in  the  Project,  project  monitoring  unit  (PMU),  project \nimplementation unit (PIU), Pradeshiya Sabhas, and counterpart NGOs, will be women. \n(ii)  In  the  institutional  strengthening  component,  at  least  20%  of  National  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Board \n(NWSDB) professionals who participate in the training subcomponent, will be women. \n(iii) In designing awareness campaigns about water supply and sanitation, the role of women in the household \nfor most of the provision and use of water will be taken into account. \n\nNWSDB and the PMU will be responsible for developing and implementing the appropriate strategies and action plans to \nachieve these targets. NWSDB and the PMU will monitor these targets through the project progress reports and project \nbenefit monitoring. \n\n \n\n \n\nHas an output been prepared?                               \n \nE. \n\nSocial Safeguards and Other Social Risks \n\n    Yes \n\n          \n\n   No \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nconnection \n\nThe  Project  will  require  the  permanent  acquisition  of \n11.70  hectares  (ha)  of  land,  of  which  NWSDB  owns \n0.6 ha,  1.94  ha  is  private  land,  and  the  Government \nowns the rest. Land acquisition will not result in loss of \nlivelihoods  or  community  resources.  Temporary  loss  of \nlivelihoods may be incurred because construction in the \nUnnichchai  tank  will  affect  about  4,000  people.
