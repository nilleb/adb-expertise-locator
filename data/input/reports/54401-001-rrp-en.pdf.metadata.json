The PRC is one of the most water-stressed countries in the world, \nwith per capita water availability of about 2,000 cubic meters (m3), only one-quarter of the global \naverage.2 Water scarcity in the PRC is further exacerbated by water pollution. Insufficient access \nto clean water has been described as one of the PRC\u2019s most pressing bottlenecks to economic \ngrowth to 2030, and ADB has estimated an annual investment need of $60 billion per year for \nwater supply and sanitation in the PRC.3 \n \n4. \nBecause of uneven distribution of water resources, water scarcity is particularly severe in \nthe Yellow and Huai River basins (footnote 1). Water security remains a key constraint  for the \nbasins as they are prone to natural hazards and adverse impacts from climate change, such as \nsevere droughts and flooding. For instance, more than three-quarters of the Yellow River basin \narea is defined as ecologically fragile, with its total water resources shrinking by 13.4% since 1990 \n(footnote 2). \n \n5. \nIn recognition of the critical nature of water security, provincial governments along the river \nbasins are increasingly introducing stricter local WWT discharge standards that are higher than \nthe  national  requirements. 4  ADB,  through  EARD,  is  supporting  the  government  in  capacity \ndevelopment and in designing the Yellow River ecological corridor framework which focuses on \nprotecting  the  fragile  ecological  environment  of  the  Yellow  River  basin,  balancing  the  use  and \npreservation of water resources, and promoting high-quality green development. Through a One \nADB approach, ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department identified a private sector solution \nto complement EARD\u2019s initiatives for water sustainability in key river basins in the PRC. \n \n6. \nProject design. The project will support the expansion of WWT capacity and upgrade of \ntreatment and discharge standards at operating WWT plants mainly in third- and fourth-tier cities, \nwith  a  focus  on  the  Yellow  and  Huai  River  basins.5 The  project  is  designed  to  support  private \nsector participation in protecting the water environment in the PRC. Further, the project will bundle \n\n \n\n1   ADB. 2020.

As of 2018, 62% of urban WWT plants met class 1A \n\nwhile 33% were still following class 1B. \n\n5  Third- and fourth-tier cities are generally cities that are smaller than and ranked below provincial capital cities. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fprojects  typically  too  small  and  expensive  for  international  banks  to  finance  on  a  stand-alone \nbasis. As such, the project is designed to be a least-cost solution to financing smaller-scale WWT \nupgrade and expansion projects in the PRC. \n \nUnder  the  project,  ADB  will  disburse  funds  to  selected  subprojects  subject  to  defined \n7. \nenvironmental, social, development, and financial criteria. Eligible capital expenditure items will \ninclude  constructing,  upgrading,  expanding,  and  refinancing  the  subprojects.  [CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED] \n \n8. \nEach  subproject  involves  a  public\u2013private  partnership  arrangement  with  a  municipal \ngovernment based on template contracts set forth in national concession guidelines. In each case, \nthe  specific  expansion  and/or  upgrade  infrastructure  will  depend  on  development  and \nenvironmental needs as determined by municipal governments. The facilities will be required to \ncomply with ADB\u2019s safeguards, gender mainstreaming, and other policy requirements. \n \n9. \nThe sponsor. Asia Cube Water Limited (ACW), the sponsor, is a 100% privately owned \nWWT company with nine operating projects serving more than 2 million residential and industrial \nconsumers  in  Guangdong,  Heilongjiang,  Henan,  and  Shaanxi  provinces  in  the  PRC.  All  ACW \noperations  are  consolidated  under  its  wholly  owned  onshore  subsidiary,  China  Cube  Water \nLimited  (CCW),  the  borrower.  ACW  holds  its  ownership  in  CCW  through  a  holding  company \nregistered in Hong Kong, China\u2014China Water Cube Limited (CWC), the guarantor. \n \n10. \nThe borrower. CCW began operating as a WWT utility in 2011 and had a total operating \ncapacity of 207,500 m3 per day as of December 2020. Seventy percent of CCW\u2019s capacity is in \nHenan  and  Shaanxi  provinces,  along  the  Huai  and  Yellow  River  basins.  Further,  CCW  has \nadditional capacity of 105,000 m3 per day under development and construction, located near or \nadjacent to its Huai and Yellow River basin projects. CCW distinguishes itself from other WWT \noperators in the PRC by its technological expertise and operational excellence. [CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED] \n \n11. \nShareholders.  ACW  is  wholly  owned  by  I  Squared  Capital  Advisors  LLC  (ISQ),  an \ninternational infrastructure private equity firm. In Asia, ISQ has deployed more than $2.6 billion in \ninvestments,  owning,  and  managing  projects  in  renewable  energy,  environmental  protection, \ntelecommunications, data centers, and highways. Since its acquisition in 2014, ISQ has brought \nin  a  highly  qualified  and  experienced  management  team  to  CCW  and  introduced  initiatives  to \nincrease efficiency, such as implementing a rigorous investment approval process, streamlining \noperational processes, and optimizing variable costs such as electricity and chemical costs. \n \n12. \n \nPandemic  impacts.  CCW  has  a  large  operational  footprint  in  Henan  and  Shaanxi \n13. \nprovinces\u2014neighboring provinces to Hubei, the epicenter of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \noutbreak.  CCW  acted  on  municipal  government  requests  to  ensure  uninterrupted  WWT  to \nresidential and industrial consumers so that essential activities were supported as the economy \nattempted to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Though CCW experienced a delay in tariff \nrepayment from local governments in the first 6 months of the outbreak, the overall impact has \nbeen limited as the tariff payments have now resumed per the regular payments cycle. Therefore, \nCOVID-19 has not had a material long-term impact on CCW\u2019s project costs or capacity. ADB\u2019s \nsupport  for  private  sector  participation  in  building  and  maintaining  critical  infrastructure  is \nexpected to help local governments ensure resilience in their pandemic recovery efforts. Further, \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nthe subprojects will provide local jobs and a more inclusive work environment for male and female \nemployees. \n \nB. \n \n14. \nImpacts.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impacts:  access  to  wastewater \nmanagement for residential and industrial users enhanced, and the urban environment improved \nin the PRC.6 \n \n15. \nOutcome. The project will have the following outcome: provision of WWT services mainly \nin third- and fourth-tier cities, with a focus on the Yellow and Huai River basins increased and/or \nimproved to meet higher local discharge standards.7 \n \n16. \nOutputs. The project will have the following outputs: (i) capacity of WWT plants expanded \nand/or effluent discharge upgraded, (ii) budget of local city governments in the PRC supported, \n(iii) local employment generated, and (iv) gender equality in the workplace strengthened. \n \nC. \n \n17. \nConsistency with ADB strategy. The project is aligned with Strategy 2030\u2019s operational \npriority 4 (making cities more livable) by reducing pollution through expansion of WWT capacity \nand  by  supporting  water  quality  improvements  through  higher  discharge  standards  of  treated \nwastewater. The project is also consistent with Strategy 2030\u2019s operational priority 2 (accelerating \nprogress in gender equality) with measures designed to promote gender-sensitive solutions and \ngender-responsive  infrastructure  assets.  Further,  the  project  contributes  to  Strategy  2030\u2019s \noperational  priority  1  (addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities)  by  providing \nemployment  during  the  project\u2019s  construction  and  operation  phases,  and  operational  priority  3 \n(tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental \nsustainability)  by  providing  additional  capacity  to  treat  wastewater.  The  project  supports  the \nstrategic  priorities  of  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC,  2021\u20132025  to  address \nenvironmental  degradation  through  mainstreaming  private  sector  solutions  for  environmental \ninfrastructure.8 \n \n18. \nLessons  from  previous  operations.  The  project  will  benefit  from  ADB\u2019s  broad \nexperience in mobilizing investment from the private sector to support sustainable development \nin the water infrastructure value chain in the PRC. Key lessons from previous operations include \n(i)  water  utilities  with  private  investment  typically  outperform  those  owned  by  municipalities;9 \n(ii) effective  policy  dialogue  on  cost  recovery  benefits  urban  water  planning  and  ensures \ninvestment sustainability; 10 (iii) there is a need to adopt an integrated approach, treating water \nsystems  together  with  the  catchment  area  as  a  complete  ecosystem;11 (iv)  there  is  a  need  for \ninnovative technology (smart systems based on information and communication technology) to \n\n \n\n6  Government of the PRC, State Council. 2015.

The  project  was  originated  and  structured  through  a  strong  One  ADB  approach \nundertaken  by  ADB\u2019s  EARD  and  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  in  the  PRC  and \ncomplements the Yellow River ecological corridor framework currently being designed by EARD. \nThe  project  includes  tracking  pollutants  such  as  heavy  metals,  oil  hydrocarbons,  inorganic \nnitrogen, phosphate, and organic matter that are listed as pollutants to be controlled under ADB\u2019s \nAction Plan for Healthy Oceans.14 Finally, supporting a private sector sponsor with expertise in \ndeploying technology and operational efficiency in urban water projects will provide an opportunity \nto extract lessons learned to further encourage private sector participation in addressing one of \nthe PRC\u2019s most critical development needs. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nADB\u2019s assistance to CCW is a senior loan of up to CNY230 million from its ordinary capital \n\nThe Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \n23. \nresources. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n \nB. \n \n24. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nADB\u2019s assistance provides the following additionality: \n(i) \n\nFinancial  additionality.  Compared  to  its  peers  which  are  mostly  state-owned \nentities,  CCW  has  extremely  limited  access  to  long-term  financing  from  local \ncommercial  banks. In  particular, financing  for  upgrading  existing  WWT  plants  to \nmeet  higher  water  quality  standards  is  difficult  to  obtain  because  of  the  lack  of \nadditional collateral. Without ADB\u2019s support, CCW would need to fund the required \ncapital expenditure either entirely through equity or pledge other debt-free projects \nas collateral. By aggregating a series of upgrade and expansion subprojects which \nare  too  small  to  be  financed  on  a  stand-alone  basis  with  an  operating  portfolio, \nADB will structure a single optimum financing solution for CCW, reduce transaction \ncosts, and bring a cofinancier to the project. \nNonfinancial  additionality.  ADB  will  work  with  CCW  to  establish  a  corporate \nenvironmental and social management system (ESMS) as a condition precedent \nto the first disbursement. ADB\u2019s engagement will promote gender inclusiveness in \nCCW\u2019s  operations  and  support  the  implementation  of  CCW\u2019s  gender-sensitive \npractices  in  its  human  resources  policies  and  in  the  workplace.  Through  a  One \nADB approach, the key lessons from this project  on WWT through a river basin \napproach will be shared with other developing member countries. \n\n(ii) \n\n14 ADB. 2019.

Corrective actions were identified to ensure \nthat CCW\u2019s E&S measures and institutional capacity and commitment to manage the project\u2019s \nE&S impacts will be adequate. \n \n28. \nExternal  consultants  conducted  an  audit  of  CCW\u2019s  existing  corporate  ESMS  and  E&S \ncompliance audits of nine subprojects that will be supported by the ADB loan. At the time of the \nE&S audit, nine subprojects were in operation and only one subproject had ongoing construction \nactivities.  The  audits  did  not  find  any  potential  significant  adverse,  irreversible,  diverse,  or \nunprecedented E&S impacts that may be caused by the upgrade, expansion, and operation of \nCCW  subprojects.  Auxiliary facilities  such  as  pipelines  and  sludge  treatment  stations  are  built, \noperated, and maintained by local governments and will not be financed by the ADB loan. The \nsubprojects are not located in or adjacent to any legally protected areas; critical habitats; or areas \nof cultural, historical, or religious significance. In each case, the local government determines the \nlocation of the subprojects based on the local land use planning. Treated wastewater from each \nsubproject is discharged to water bodies designated by the government and is strictly monitored \nagainst  the  applicable  effluent  discharge  standards  by  the  local  Ecology  and  Environmental \nBureau through a real-time wastewater online monitoring system. Based on the screening using \nthe AWARE for Projects tool, the climate risk rating for each subproject ranges from medium to \nhigh because of floods, storms, and snow loading. Since site selections were based on local land \nuse planning and national and local standards for flood control, the potential climate risk may be \nlow  to  medium.  The  corrective  action  includes  developing  and  adopting  a  supplementary \nemergency response plan in case of floods. \n \n29. \nCCW has environment, health, and safety (EHS) policies and procedures for its subproject \noperation  and  maintenance,  including  equipment  maintenance,  influent  and  effluent  quality, \nchemical use, occupational health and safety, accident and incident management, and COVID-\n19 prevention and control. The EHS procedures are cascaded to the subprojects and are adjusted \nto comply with requirements in the concession agreements and/or with the applicable regulations. \n \n30. \nThe  audits  recommended  corrective  actions  to  ensure  that  relevant  procedures  are \nadequate  and  compliant  with  applicable  national  and  local  laws  and  regulations,  good \ninternational  industry  practices,  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  requirements. \nSpecifically,  CCW  will  (i)  apply  ADB\u2019s  prohibited  investment  activities  list,  (ii)  ensure  that \nsubprojects  that  use  ADB  funds comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  abide  by \nnational  laws  and  regulations,  (iii)  establish  and  maintain  an  appropriate  corporate  ESMS \n\n15 ADB.

A time-bound corrective action plan will be \ndiscussed and agreed with CCW. \n \n31. \nCCW\u2019s  human  resource  management  policies  and  procedures  applicable  to  direct  full-\ntime and short-term employees at corporate and subproject levels were assessed in the audits \nas  being  compliant  with  national  laws  and  regulations  and  include  measures  to  comply  with \ninternationally  recognized  core  labor  standards,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy \n(2001).  Policy  enhancement  opportunities  have  been  identified  regarding  specific  coverage  of \nsubcontractor  labor  contracting  and  maximizing  local  recruitment,  which  are  included  in  the \ncorrective action plan. The ESMS will set out requirements, as applicable, for compliance with \nnational  labor  laws  and  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor \nstandards,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy.  The  ESMS  will  also  contain \nrequirements, as applicable, for grievance redress management and information disclosure and \nconsultation with affected people following ADB requirements. CCW will report regularly to ADB \non (i) its E&S performance and that of its subprojects, including compliance with applicable laws; \nand (ii) the measures taken.16 \n \nSome gender elements. The project is classified as having some gender elements. The \n32. \ngender  analysis  conducted  during  due  diligence  concluded  that  CCW  operates  in  accordance \nwith national regulations governing gender equality in the workplace. The nature of work at WWT \nplants makes it difficult to have balanced participation in technical and operational jobs in line with \nthe  national  average,  yet  CCW  maintains  consistent  female  representation  in  its  management \nteams.  Since  January  2021,  the  PRC  has  had  its  first  national  legislation  in  place  obliging \ncompanies to adopt measures to prevent and respond to sexual harassment in the workplace.17 \nCCW is committed to having responsive business practices and, notably, initiated an anti-sexual-\nharassment policy. Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development, CCW has incorporated \nmeasures  to  promote  gender  equality  and  women\u2019s  empowerment  in  its  business  activities, \nfostering  a  gender-inclusive  environment. 18  These  measures  relate \nthe  effective \nimplementation  of  its  new  anti-sexual-harassment  policy  through  active  communication  with \nemployees at headquarters and at the plants, using digital and other channels to disseminate key \nmessages on this topic, and its integration into the human resource onboarding program. CCW \nwill  also  further  enhance  its  facilities  to  be  more  gender  responsive  by  setting  up  designated \nnursing  rooms  at  all  plants.  CCW  will  submit  periodic  reports  on  its  implementation  of  the \nproposed gender measures to ADB. \n \nB. \n \nCCW was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \n33. \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nto \n\n \n\n16 Summary  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Strategy;  and  Environmental  and  Social  Management  System:  Audit \n\nFindings and Details of Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n17 D.
