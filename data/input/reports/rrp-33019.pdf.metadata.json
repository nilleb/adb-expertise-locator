The first component will address port sector\npolicy, institutional, and regulatory issues.  This will include\nmeasures to improve the efficiency of the existing port, in\nparticular  the  Jaya  Container  Terminal  (JCT).    It  will  also\nprepare  the  regulatory  and  planning  framework  for  port-\nrelated  international  trade  operations.    The  second\ncomponent  comprises  preparatory  work  for  the\nimplementation  of  the  South  Harbor  Development  Project\n(SHDP).\nClassification Other\nThematic: Private Sector Development\nEnvironmental Category A.  A full environmental impact assessment (EIA) of\nAssessment the SHDP will be undertaken under the TA loan. This EIA will\nbe in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Environmental\nAssessment of Infrastructure Projects.\nRationale An efficient port is a major engine of growth. Not only is a port\na major activity in itself, but it requires an extensive range of\nancillary  services  and  can  support  the  development  of\ndownstream activities. Access to an efficient port is a key\nfactor  in  the  development  of  internationally  competitive\nindustries. As an island state, Sri Lanka relies on Colombo\nPort for its international trade links. The port\u2019s efficiency is\nessential for the country\u2019s economic development, and is an\nimportant determinant of employment creation and poverty\nreduction.\nObjectives and Scope The proposed TA loan will assist the Government in realizing\nthe  potential  of  Colombo  Port  to  become  a  major\ninternationally competitive port in South Asia by (i) expanding\nprivate  sector  participation  in  the  port  sector,  (ii)\ncommercializing  public  sector  operations  and  thereby\nimproving efficiency, and (iii) adopting a strategic approach to\nenlarging  Colombo  Port  and  maximizing  private  sector\nfunding.\nThe first component of the TA will address port sector policy,\ninstitutional,  and  regulatory  issues.  The  first  part  of  this\ncomponent will provide consulting services to prepare draft\nlegislation to revise the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) Act\nand  the  necessary  documentation  for  establishing  a\ncompetition regulator.  The second part of this component will\nfocus  on  increasing  the  efficiency  of  SLPA\u2019s  existing\ncontainer  terminal  facilities  at  the  JCT  by  (i)  reorganizing\nadministration, management, and operations at the JCT; and\n(ii)  introducing  International  Standards  Organization  (ISO)\n9002-based  quality  standards  and  obtaining  ISO  9002", "iii\ncertification.  The  second  part  of  this  component  will  also\ninclude  consulting  services  to  prepare  a  master  plan  to\nsimplify port documentation and cargo clearance procedures,\nincluding implementation of an electronic data interchange,\nwhich will improve the efficiency of clearance of goods. The\nthird part of this component will prepare necessary enabling\nregulations or legislation for the establishment of dedicated\nfacilities  for  international  trade  operations  such  as\ninternational procurement centers.\nThe  second  component  concerns  preparation  for  the\nimplementation of the SHDP. The first part will review the\nmarket  for  the  SHDP,  confirm  demand  projections,  and\nprepare marketing and business plans. The business plan will\nalso include a definition of the factors necessary to obtain\ncommitment to the SHDP from shipping lines and terminal\noperators,  and  options  for  packaging  concessions  for  the\nSHDP. The second part will examine detailed engineering\ndesigns and prepare the contractual documentation required\nto commence the construction of the first phase of the SHDP.\nWork under this component will continue until the award of all\nconcession and construction contacts. The third part of this\ncomponent  will  include  the  preparation  of  a  summary\nenvironmental  impact  assessment;  a  full  environmental\nimpact assessment, and an initial social analysis; a full social\nanalysis, if required; and a poverty impact study. The TA also\nprovides for a panel of experts to review the proposed SHDP\nwith  respect  to  commercial,  technical,  and  operational\nviability.\nCost Estimates The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $14.40  million\nequivalent,  comprising  a  foreign  exchange  component  of\n$7.99 million (about 55 percent of the total TA cost) and a\nlocal currency component of $6.41 million equivalent (about\n45 percent).\nFinancing Plan It  is  proposed  that  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\nprovide a loan of $10.0 million equivalent to cover the entire\nforeign exchange cost and part of the local currency cost of\nthe TA. The Government will finance the remaining local cost\nof $4.4 million equivalent.\nLoan Amount and ADB will provide a loan in an amount equivalent to $10.0\nTerms million from Special Funds resources, with a maturity period\nof 32 years, including a  grace  period  of  8 years,  and  an\nannual interest rate of 1 percent during the grace period and\n1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\nPeriod of Utilization 29 February 2004\nImplementation The Ministry of Port Development and Development of the\nArrangements South (MPDDS) will be the Implementing Agency for the TA.\nA  steering  committee  will  be  established  to  give  overall\ndirection  to  the  TA,  comprised  of  representatives  of  the", "iv\nMinistry of Finance (MOF), MPDDS, SLPA, ADB, Japan Bank\nfor  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  and  the  World  Bank.\nSLPA will recruit the core staff for the project management\nunit  (PMU)  from  the  open  market  in  accordance  with\nGovernment  procedures  that  are  acceptable  to  ADB.  The\nPMU will supervise the work under the TA for the JCT and the\nSHDP.\nExecuting Agency MPDDS will be the Executing Agency for the TA.\nConsulting Services There will be two consulting services contracts under the TA.\nThe first contract will be for the panel of experts, while the\nsecond will be for the main services, i.e., concerning port\nsector policy, institutional, and regulatory issues as well as\npreparations for the implementation of the SHDP.\nThe individual consultants for the first contract will be experts\nof international repute, and will be selected by the steering\ncommittee,  and  engaged  by  the  Borrower.  The  steering\ncommittee will review all nominations, and selection will be on\nthe basis of voting by its members.\nThe main services that are the subject of the second contract\nwill be undertaken by international consultants in association\nwith suitably qualified domestic consultants.\nAll consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants.  Approximately  463\nperson-months  of  consulting  services  will  be  required,\ncomprising approximately 285 person-months of international\nand 178 person-months of domestic consultants.\nEstimated Project 31 August 2003\nCompletion Date\nProject Benefits and The benefits of the TA will be to establish the environment to\nBeneficiaries (i)  increase  private  sector  participation  in  the  port  sector,\nleading to increased competitiveness; (ii) increase efficiency\nat  existing  container  terminals  through  corporatization  and\nimproved management of the JCT facility; and (iii) facilitate\nproject  preparation  for  an  investment  loan  to  expand  the\ncontainer facilities by maximizing the use of private sector\nfunding.\nThe immediate beneficiaries will be the users of Colombo\nPort,  but  the  SHDP  has  the  potential  to  create  synergies\nleading  to  the  expansion  of  economic  activities  centered\naround  shipping  and  related  activities.    Efficient\ntransshipment ports attract large ships that will pass on the\nbenefit of cheaper shipping costs to domestic traffic.", "v", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  loan  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the\nColombo Port Efficiency and Expansion Project.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. Colombo  Port  serves  as  a  hub  for  regional  container  and  transshipment  traffic\nconnecting South Asia\u2019s 1.5 billion inhabitants through feeder services with the world\u2019s main\nshipping routes. The port also serves as the major conduit for Sri Lanka\u2019s international trade.\nBecause  of  stagnation  in  the  growth  of  the  port,  the  Government  requested  the  Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to provide assistance for improving the efficiency and enlarging the\ncapacity of the port. In 1999, ADB provided TA1 to assist the Government of Sri Lanka in\nexamining the feasibility of developing the South Harbor to increase the capacity of container\nfacilities at Colombo Port. That TA, which was completed in May 2001, concluded that the\nSouth Harbor Development Project (SHDP) is feasible but noted that (i) reforms in the port\nsector are required to encourage private sector participation, (ii) efficiency levels at the existing\nJaya Container Terminal (JCT) facilities needed to be improved, and (iii) the scale of South\nHarbor development requires additional project preparation. In January 2001, at the tripartite\nmeeting for TA 3276, the Government requested ADB to consider providing a follow-on TA to\nundertake detailed preparatory work for the SHDP. The TA Loan Processing Mission2 held\ndiscussions with the Government, other stakeholders, and representatives of other aid agencies\nsupporting the port sector including the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and the\nWorld Bank. Following from these discussions, an understanding with the Government was\nreached on the scope, costs, financing, and implementation arrangements for the TA.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA.  The Port Sector\n3. The port sector in Sri Lanka is dominated by Colombo Port.  Only Colombo Port is\nequipped to handle container traffic, and the port handles 95 percent of Sri Lanka\u2019s total\ninternational trade. Trincomalee and Galle are the next largest ports in terms of throughput, but\nthey handle only noncontainerized cargo.\n4. Colombo Port is one of the few deepwater ports that is close to the Indian subcontinent\nand also lies on the main shipping route connecting East and Southeast Asia, Europe, and\nNorth and South America. It is in an excellent location to serve as a hub for regional container\nand transshipment traffic, and could command a significant market share of this trade. Between\n1987  and  1997  the  throughput  of  containers  in  Colombo  Port  increased  from  429,000  to\n1,650,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (teu). Growth stagnated from 1997 to 1999, but then\ngrew to 1,732,855 teu during 2000. The JCT in Colombo Port is presently handling 1.43 million\nteu a year and is expected to reach its maximum capacity in 2003/2004. Projections of growth in\ninternational trade across the Indian Ocean indicate that Colombo Port has the potential for\n                  \n1 TA 3276-SRI: Port of Colombo South Harbor Development, for $1,460,000, approved on 13 October 1999.\n2 Comprising P.Vallely, Transport Specialist/Mission Leader; M. Mizutani, Transport Economist; P. Dutt, Transport\nSpecialist; and T. Duncan, Project Economist.", "2\nrapid  growth.  To  exploit  this  potential  requires  that  Colombo  Port  is  perceived  within  the\nshipping industry as an internationally competitive port with adequate capacity.\n5. The ports sector is administered through the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) Act of\n1979. This act is based on the philosophy of a government-owned service port, i.e. where all\nservices within a port are offered by a port authority. Until recently, all port operations were\nprovided by the government through the SLPA but efficiency at the JCT is low. In terms of\ncontainer  moves  per  hour,  JCT  averages  17\u201319,  whereas  the  industry  average  is  25\u201330;\nefficient ports may reach 50 moves per hour. Shipping lines are critical of ship turnaround times;\ndelays are caused by the shift system used at the JCT, outmoded work practices, and high\nabsenteeism in the workforce. Although no systematic analysis has been carried out, it is\ngenerally felt that Colombo Port is overstaffed. For domestic cargo, shipping agents have\nhighlighted causes of delays as (i) inefficient customs procedures and (ii) security measures that\nfrustrate truck movements into and out of the port. Commercial and marketing efforts need to be\nenhanced to achieve the full potential of Colombo Port.\n6. Most major ports in the world are now operated using the landlord model,3  which allows\nthe private sector to operate port infrastructure facilities and addresses the need to react swiftly\nto a rapidly changing market. The role of the state becomes that of a landlord and a regulator.\nUnder the 1979 SLPA Act, exclusive powers are given to SLPA. This is not consistent with the\nlandlord model. Changing this act would allow SLPA to restructure its operations, including\ndecentralizing financial and managerial functions, and to optimize the use of private sector\nconcessions.\n7. To date the only private sector facility in Colombo Port is that operated by the South Asia\nGateway Terminal (SAGT). SAGT has a 30-year concession to upgrade the Queen Elizabeth\nQuay (QEQ), provide equipment, and operate the facility. This concession was awarded in\n1999. The first rehabilitated berth opened in May 2001.\n8. Efficient ports are perceived to be catalysts for adding value to supply chains and are\npositioned to attract certain types of industries and enterprises. Although these commercial and\nindustrial developments require access to port facilities, they also require the development of\ncoordinated actions to set up distribution hubs, which are not currently in place. To attract\nindustries such as international procurement centers requires an efficient transportation network\nwith exemptions from taxes and duties.\nB.  Government Policies\n9. In 1997, the Government proclaimed the National Port and Shipping Policy, which sets\nout its vision for the port sector as (i) efficient ports that will facilitate Sri Lankan trade and\ntransshipment; (ii) exporters and importers having unimpeded access to reliable and competitive\nshipping services; (iii) ancillary services that will enhance the position of Sri Lankan ports in the\nSouth Asian region; (iv) availability of shipbuilding and ship repair facilities; (v) internationally\ncompetitive national merchant shipping line(s), capable of assisting the growth of the region\u2019s\nseaborne trade; (vi) an environment that promotes safety at sea and the prevention of marine\npollution; and (vii) seafarers trained to international standards. This policy document makes a\ncommitment  to  reform  of  the  port  sector;  a  manifestation  of  this  commitment  was  the\nGovernment\u2019s privatization of the QEQ in 1999. However, the reform process then stalled until\n                  \n3 One whereby the port authority retains ownership of the facility but the private sector equips and operates it under\na concession.", "3\nthe Advisory Committee on Ports was established in 2000 to recommend measures to improve\nthe efficiency of Colombo Port. This committee was established in response to stagnation of the\ngrowth of Colombo Port after 1997, and was to address the loss of shipping lines and services\nto other ports. Of particular concern was the loss of a major shipping line to a new port in the\nMiddle East that is perceived as a direct competitor of Colombo. An interim report by this\ncommittee recommended that, as a matter of urgency, a number of actions should be taken to\nimprove  efficiency  at  the  port.4  The  Government  has  accepted  this  report,  and  its\nrecommendations are being implemented.\nC.  External Assistance to the Sector\n10. Modern  development  of  Colombo  Port  started  in  1980  with  the  commencement  of\nconstruction of the first phase of the JCT with funding from JBIC, then known as the Overseas\nEconomic Cooperation Fund. A series of JBIC loans through the 1980s and 1990s funded the\nenlargement of the JCT to its present four berths. In 2000, a JBIC loan was provided to upgrade\nthe JCT\u2019s computer systems, which is expected to enhance the efficiency of port operations.\n11. The  World  Bank  assisted  the  port  sector  under  its  Port  Efficiency  Project,  which\ncommenced in 1997 and funded studies into the legal, regulatory, and management aspects of\nboth the port sector as a whole and Colombo Port in particular. The Port Efficiency Project was\nsuspended in 1999 due to lack of agreement, between World Bank and the Government on\nrestructuring the port sector.\n12. ADB\u2019s activities in the Sri Lanka port sector include a loan to and equity investment in\nthe SAGT for private sector development of the QEQ in Colombo Port.5 This project was ADB\u2019s\nfirst build-operate-transfer project in the transport sector in Sri Lanka and was a major step\ntoward the Government\u2019s objective to increase private sector involvement in the port sector.\nD.  Lessons Learned\n13. To improve the efficiency of the port sector in Sri Lanka will require reforms. The\nexperience of the World Bank\u2019s Port Efficiency Project shows, that without support at the\nhighest political level, attempts to reform the sector will be frustrated. The 2000 election brought\nin a Government that has committed itself to reform. The election also brought in a minister to\nthe Ministry of Port Development and Development of the South (MPDDS) who has adopted a\nradical reform agenda and is receptive to restructuring the State\u2019s role in the port sector. The\nsupport of the Government, and of this particular minister, will be important if the proposed TA\nloan is to achieve its objectives. However, the successful SAGT concession for developing the\nQEQ  demonstrates  that  reforms  are  moving  forward  and  that  well-conceived  projects  can\nsucceed.\nE.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n14. ADB\u2019s overall strategy in Sri Lanka is to enhance private sector development through (i)\npromotion of an enabling environment for private sector activities through ADB\u2019s public sector\noperations, and (ii) direct investment in private sector companies in the form of loans and equity\nthrough operations of ADB\u2019s Private Sector Group. Consistent with this approach, ADB has to\n                  \n4 Including deepening of the southern entrance and harbor basin, expediting the SHDP, and restructuring SLPA.\n5 Loan  1689/7153-SRI: Colombo Port Development Project,  for  $35.0  million  (loan)  and  $7.4  million  (equity\ninvestment), approved on 11 May 1999.", "4\ndate placed strong emphasis on creating a suitable environment for the expansion of private\nparticipation in the economy and on identifying specific opportunities for private investment.\nFollowing its loan and equity investment for the QEQ in 1999 (footnote 5), ADB provided TA\n(footnote 1) to assist the Government in undertaking a feasibility study to determine the viability\nof developing Colombo Port\u2019s South Harbor through building a breakwater and constructing\nadditional container terminals with private sector participation.\n15. For  Colombo  Port,  the  medium-term  objective  of  this  strategy  is  to  make  the  port\ninternationally competitive, operated by the private sector, with all investment requirements\nbeing financed by the private sector. Under this strategy, a programmatic approach will be\nadopted whereby implementation will be sequential, with progress from one stage to the next\nbeing linked to the accomplishment of policy reforms. Under the proposed TA loan, assistance\nwill  be  given  to  the  Government  to  reform  the  port  sector  and  to  prepare  the  SHDP  for\nimplementation. If found economically viable, this will be followed by an investment loan to\nprovide funding for the construction of the first phase of the SHDP. The terms of this investment\nloan, and the role of the private sector, will depend on the business plan to be developed under\nthe TA. The Government has indicated that it anticipates the need to arrange cofinancing of the\nfirst phase of the SHDP from ADB, JBIC, and the World Bank.\nIV.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN\nA.  Rationale\n16. An efficient port is a major engine of growth. Not only is a port a major activity in itself,\nbut it requires an extensive range of ancillary services and can support the development of\ndownstream  activities.  Access  to  an  efficient  port  is  a  key  factor  in  the  development  of\ninternationally competitive industries. As an island nation, Sri Lanka relies on Colombo Port for\nits  international  trade  links.  The  port\u2019s  efficiency  is  essential  for  the  country\u2019s  economic\ndevelopment, and is an important determinant of employment creation and poverty reduction. At\npresent, Colombo Port\u2019s crane handling rate for containers is about 16 boxes per hour, whereas\nmost world-class ports can achieve about 25-30 boxes per hour.\n17. Colombo  Port  has  a  geographical  advantage  that  gives  it  the  potential  to  be  the\ninternational hub for South Asia. The port also has the potential to create synergies leading to\nthe expansion of economic activities centered around port, shipping, and related activities.\nEfficient transshipment ports attract large ships, which will pass on the benefit of cheaper\nshipping costs to domestic traffic.\nB.  Objective and Scope\n18. The proposed TA will assist the Government to realize the potential of Colombo Port to\nbecome a major internationally competitive port in South Asia by creating the environment to\nallow (i) expansion of private sector participation in the port sector, (ii) commercialization of\npublic sector operations and thereby improved efficiency, and (iii) adopting a strategic approach\nto  enlarging  Colombo  Port  and  maximizing  private  sector  funding.  The  TA  objectives  are\npresented in the TA Framework in Appendix 1.\n19. The TA will consist of two components. The first component will address port sector\npolicy, institutional, and regulatory issues. This will include measures to improve the efficiency\nof  the  existing  port,  particularly  the  JCT.  It  will  also  prepare  the  regulatory  and  planning", "5\nframework for port-related international trade operations. The second component comprises\nproject preparation for the SHDP.\n20. The Government has agreed to certain time-bound covenants related to institutional and\npolicy reforms, successful accomplishment of which will be a condition for processing a further\nloan by ADB for the SHDP. The institutional and policy reforms will be carried out in phases,\nwith the first phase commencing under the TA. It is expected that the reforms will be completed\nduring implementation of the SHDP.\n21. The Government has agreed that the processing of a further loan by ADB for the SHDP\nwill be conditional upon (i) all personnel for JCT line management positions being filled; (ii) the\nInternational Standard Organization (ISO) 90026 compliance application will have been filed; (iii)\nthe  JCT  labor  rationalization  plan  having  been  approved  by  a  corporatized  JCT  board,\nimplementation of the plan having commenced, and the plan being acceptable to ADB; (iv) the\norganizational structure and functions of the port regulator having been finalized; and (v) private\nsector participation in the SHDP being agreed upon at the tripartite review of the business plan\n(to be prepared under this TA).7\n1.  Policy, Institutional, and Regulatory Issues Component\n22. The first part of this component will provide consulting services to prepare (i) draft\nlegislation to revise the SLPA Act to optimize the use of private sector concessions, and (ii) the\nnecessary documentation for the establishment of a competition regulator. The revised SLPA\nAct will allow the Government to optimize the use of private sector concessions not only in\nColombo Port but also throughout the country.\n23. The second part of this component will focus on increasing the efficiency of SPLA\u2019s\nexisting container terminal facilities at the JCT, beginning  with the registration of a corporatized\nentity to operate the JCT. To strengthen SLPA\u2019s capacity to manage the corporatized JCT, the\nTA  will  identify  necessary  expertise,  especially  top-level  management  positions  in  finance,\nmarketing, and information and communication technologies services. These positions will form\nthe core of the JCT management team to (i) reorganize administration, management, and\noperations at the JCT based on recommendations made under World Bank-funded studies and\nrecent updates8; and (ii) manage the introduction of ISO 9002-based quality standards and\nobtain ISO 9002 certification. The intention is that the JCT management team will be an integral\npart of the JCT\u2019s corporate management with the authority to implement the reorganization.9\nThe second part of this component will also include consulting services to prepare a master plan\nto simplify port documentation and cargo clearance procedures, including implementation of an\nelectronic data interchange (EDI), which will improve the efficiency of clearance of goods.\n24. The third part of this component will prepare the necessary enabling regulations or\nlegislation for the establishment of dedicated facilities for international trade operations such as\n                  \n6 ISO 9000 standards are internationally administered and certified quality procedures that require the rigorous\nidentification of all activities within a manufacturing or service operation. Certification is renewed annually and is\ninternationally recognized. For port operations the relevant standard is ISO 9002.\n7 At a minimum, this participation will consist of offering concessions for equipping and operating the berths to be\nconstructed under the first phase.  If the business plan demonstrates that the SHDP is viable as a full private\nsector-funded project, this will be a condition to approve the concession documentation.\n8 World Bank funded a consultant to prepare a corporate plan for the JCT. SLPA has retained the same consultant\nto prepare an implementation framework for this corporate plan, which is ongoing.\n9 I.e., the JCT management team is not intended to be merely an advisory unit.", "6\ninternational  procurement  centers.  It  is  envisaged  that  this  will  take  the  form  of  a\ncommercial/industrial facility with exemption from normal customs and taxation requirements.\nThe intent is that the facility will support enterprises that will increase throughput at Colombo\nPort while adding value to the goods in the process.\n2.  Project Preparation for the SHDP\n25. The second component of the TA will prepare the strategy to enlarge the container\ncapacity of Colombo Port, maximizing the use of private sector funding. The first part of this\ncomponent will review the market for the SHDP, confirm demand projections, and prepare\nmarketing and business plans. From this work the scope of the first phase of the SHDP will be\ndefined in terms of the number of berths. The business plan will also include a definition of the\nfactors necessary to obtain commitment from shipping lines and terminal operators to the\nSHDP,  and  an  options  analysis  for  packaging  of  concessions  under  the  TA.  The  options\nanalysis will address maximizing private sector input and minimizing public sector funding.10\nThe second part of this component will prepare the contractual documentation required to\ncommence the construction of the first phase of the South Harbor. Under this part, detailed\nconcession documents will be drawn up, expressions of interest invited and evaluated, and bids\nevaluated. Simultaneously, detailed engineering parameters will be prepared for the major civil\nworks components, including breakwaters, sea walls, approach channels, turning and berthing\nbasin, relocation of an existing pipeline, and engineering parameters for the terminals. These\nparameters will define the technical and operational limitations within which the SHDP must be\nconstructed. Work under this component will continue until the award of all concessions, and will\ninclude the technical, financial, and commercial evaluation of bids. The consulting services for\nthis component include the provision of three experts to form the South Harbor Development\nTeam (SHDT). The SHDT will work closely with SLPA to manage the implementation planning\nfor the SHDP. The third part of this component will include the preparation of a summary\nenvironmental impact assessment; a full environmental impact assessment; an initial social\nanalysis; a full social analysis, if required; and a poverty impact study. The TA also provides for\na panel of experts to review the proposed SHDP with respect to commercial, technical, and\noperational viability.\n26. To supplement SLPA\u2019s implementation capacity, this component will finance additional\nline management positions for the SHDT. This team will manage the SHDP in terms of (i)\nevaluation of bids and negotiation of concessions, and (ii) monitoring and facilitating Project\nimplementation. The team will be an integral part of SLPA management to implement the\nbusiness plan.\n                  \n10The potential for private sector participation in the expansion of Colombo Port through the SHDP will be analyzed\nin terms of\n(i)  part privatization of movable assets, wherein cargo handling and storage would be private while the\nbreakwater, channels,  and quay wall would remain public;\n(ii)  part privatization of terminal, where in the quay wall and movable assets would be private while the\nchannels and breakwater would remain public;\n(iii)  public/private partnership, wherein the channels, breakwater, and quay wall would be organized on\na public-private partnership basis, and cargo handling and storage would be private;\n(iv)  full privatization; wherein all elements of the SHDP would be privatized.\nThe  selection  of  privatization  option  is  dependent  on  further  analysis  under  the  TA,  which  will  take  into\nconsideration projections of the increase in port traffic, level of port competition, ability to optimize scale and\ncapacity utilization, and divisibility of port assets.", "7\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n27. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $14.40 million equivalent, comprising a foreign\nexchange component of $7.99 million (about 55 percent of the total TA cost) and a local\ncurrency component of $6.41 million equivalent (about 45 percent). It is proposed that ADB\nprovide a loan of $10.0 million equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and part of\nthe local currency cost of the TA. The Government will finance the remaining local cost of $4.4\nmillion equivalent, comprising remuneration for consultants for the SHDT, counterpart staff, and\nthe junior administration and support staff assigned to the consultants; the project management\nunit (PMU); office accommodation; local transport; part of the field surveys and model simulation\ncosts; part of the reports and communications costs; and taxes and duties. The Borrower will be\nthe Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.  A summary of the financing plan is given in\nTable 1, and detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2.\nTable 1: TA Cost and Financing Plan\n($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Total Costs Percent\nExchange Currency\nADB 7.99 2.01 10.00 69\nGovernment 4.40 4.40 31\nTotal 7.99 6.41 14.40 100\n28. ADB will provide a loan in an amount equivalent to $10.0 million from the Special Funds\nresources, with a maturity period of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and an annual\ninterest rate of 1 percent during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Project Organization and Coordination\n29. MPDDS  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA.  A  steering  committee  will  be\nestablished to give overall guidance to the TA, comprised of representatives of the Ministry of\nFinance (MOF), MPDDS, SLPA, ADB, JBIC, and the World Bank. Reviews of sector reforms\nand the progress of TA implementation will be made at tripartite meetings. A TA organization\nchart can be found in Appendix 3. SLPA will recruit the core staff for the PMU from the open\nmarket in accordance with Government procedures, which are acceptable to ADB. The PMU will\nsupervise the work under the TA for the JCT and SHDP.\n2.  Consulting Services\n30. Consulting services for the TA will be carried out under two contracts. The first contract\nwill be for the panel of experts and the second for the main services. Outline terms of reference\nare provided in Appendix 4. The individual consultants for the first contract will be experts of\ninternational repute and will be selected by the steering committee. The steering committee will\nreview all nominations, and selection will be on the basis of voting by its members. The main\nservices will be undertaken by an international firm of consultants in association with suitably\nqualified  domestic  consultants.  These  consultants  will  be  required  to  have  expertise  in  (i)\nrevising  port  sector  legislation  and  establishing  a  port  regulator;  (ii)  port  operations\nreengineering,  information  systems  (including  EDI),  and  ISO  certification  for  an  existing\ncontainer facility; (iii) taxation, logistics, and marketing relating to international procurement\ncenter/distribution  hubs;  (iv)  market  analysis,  economic  analysis,  financial  analysis,  and", "8\nconcession planning related to preparing a business plan and the management of a new\ncontainer facility; (v) port planning, engineering, concession documentation, and environmental\nimpact  assessment  required  to  prepare  engineering  designs  and  concession/contract\ndocumentation for a new container facility; and (vi) social and development impacts of the new\ncontainer facility. At MPDDS\u2019s request, ADB approved advance action for the recruitment of\nconsultants on the understanding that such approval would not commit ADB to finance the\nproposed TA. The contract for the main services will include equipment to be procured in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement. As this equipment consists of off-the-shelf\nitems of office equipment, direct purchase will be allowed. The equipment to be procured is\nlisted in Appendix 4.  Management gave approval for advance procurement action on 30 April\n2001.\n31. Approximately  463  person-months  of  total  consulting  services  will  be  required,\ncomprising  approximately  285  person-months  of  international  and  178  person-months  of\ndomestic consultants. All consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on\nthe Use of Consultants. Domestic junior, administrative, and support staff will be in addition to\nthe above domestic person-months.\n3.  Disbursements\n32. TA  loan  disbursement  arrangements  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan\nDisbursement Handbook. Payment of ADB\u2019s portion of the consulting services will be subject to\ndirect  payment  procedures  from  ADB  to  the  consultants  against  withdrawal  applications\nsubmitted by MPDDS to ADB.\n4.  Implementation Schedule\n33. It is expected that the TA will commence in January 2002 and will be completed by\nAugust  2003.  An  implementation  schedule  is  given  in  Appendix  5.  Milestones  have  been\nestablished at three points. After the preparation of the business plan for the SHDP, a tripartite\nmeeting among the Government (MPDDS and SLPA), ADB, and the consultants will be held to\nreview the status, and viability, of both sector reforms and the business plan before proceeding\nwith the next phase. This meeting will also review the report of the panel of experts on the\nviability of the business plan of the SHDP to be developed under this TA. A second milestone\nwill occur when the draft concession documents and the evaluation report on expressions of\ninterest have been submitted for review by a tripartite meeting. This meeting will also review the\nreport of the panel of experts on the viability of the procurement documentation for the SHDP.\nThe  conditions  to  be  accomplished  by  this  second  milestone  will  be  those  required  to\ncommence processing of the proposed ADB loan for the SHDP. The third milestone will occur\nbefore the award of concessions/contracts for the SHDP, when a tripartite meeting will approve\nthe negotiated concessions/contracts.\nE.  Financial and Economic Analysis\n34. Financial analyses were carried out for the public and private sector portions of the\nSHDP separately. For the public sector portion, it was assumed that the revenues are those to\nbe collected by SLPA from harbor dues charged to ships, seaward navigation, pilotage charges,\nconcession fixed rentals and a concession fee on each teu handled by the operator. The net\npresent value (NPV) of the financial returns gained by SLPA is SLRs15,427 million. The costs\nincurred by SLPA are for construction, maintenance, and operation of the breakwater, harbor\nbasin, and channel. The NPV of the financial costs of SLPA is SLRs17,424 million, giving a net", "9\nfinancial benefit-cost ratio of 0.89 for SLPA. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is 10.9\npercent.\n35. For the private sector portion of the SHDP, the revenues are fees collected by the\nterminal operator including wharf fees, storage, stevedoring, wharf handling, and other services\nto vessels calling at the terminal. The NPV of the financial benefits derived by the private sector\nis SLRs114,620 million. The costs include capital, maintenance, and operating costs for the\nberths,  terminal  handling  equipment,  and  associated  infrastructure  on  land;  buildings;\nequipment; and storage. The NPV of the financial costs of the private sector is SLRs73,681,\ngiving a net benefit-cost ratio of 1.55 and an FIRR of 26.7 percent.\n36. For the economic analysis, it is important to disaggregate the benefits that will accrue to\nthe Sri Lankan economy from the benefits that will flow to overseas entities. Only preliminary\nestimates of benefits and costs are available at this stage. It was estimated that 40 percent of\nthe profits generated by the concession company will be repatriated overseas11 and that only 25\npercent of the consumer surplus generated from SHDP will accrue to the Sri Lankan economy.12\nBased on the preliminary figures, it is estimated that the NPV of the economic benefits to Sri\nLanka is SLRs122,375 million.13 The NPV of economic costs is SLRs90,284 million. This gives\na net benefit-cost ratio of 1.35 and an estimated economic internal rate of return of 19.2 percent.\nThese economic analysis estimates show that a priori this project is economically justified based\non the benefits that will remain in the country. However, a more conclusive economic analysis\nwill be carried out under the TA.\nF.  Environmental and Social Issues\n1.  Environmental Impacts\n37. Preliminary environmental investigations were undertaken under TA 3276 (footnote 1).\nHowever, the scope of work under that TA was not sufficient to obtain environmental approval of\nthe construction of the SHDP. Services under the proposed TA loan provide for completing a full\nenvironmental  impact  assessment  of  the  SHDP  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines for\nEnvironmental Assessment of Infrastructure Projects, Environmental Assessment Requirements\nof  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (March  1998),  and  the  requirements  of  the  Coastal\nConservation Department and Central Environmental Agency of Sri Lanka.\n2.  Social Impacts and Poverty Impact\n38. Work under TA 3276 established that social issues with respect to the construction of\nthe SHDP were limited. The SHDP will be constructed entirely within the existing port area, and\nno  resettlement  will  be  required.  Social  impacts  resulting  from  the  construction  work  are\nexpected to be limited to those associated with (i) rock quarries and transport of rock to the\nSHDP, and (ii) facilities for and the impact of construction camps. Consultant services under the\nproposed  TA  loan  include  those  for  a  social  impact  assessment  in  accordance  with  the\nrequirements of ADB\u2019s Handbook for Poverty and Social Analysis, and a poverty impact study\non the impact of the development on poverty reduction.\n                  \n11The implicit assumption is that the concession company running the terminal will have 40 percent foreign\nownership, i.e., the same level as the current SAGT company.\n12 Indigenous cargo forms only 25 percent of the traffic handled by the port; 75 percent is transshipment traffic.\n13 About SLRs85,965 million or 70 percent of the net benefits accruing to Sri Lanka is in fact generated from revenues\nderived from transshipment traffic.", "10\nV.  ASSURANCES\nA.  Specific Assurances\n39. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  At least 1 week prior to the tripartite meeting to review the SHDP business plan,\nSLPA  will  have  submitted  the  business  plan  to  the  steering  committee  for\napproval.\n(ii)  No later than three months after the award of the main services contract for\nconsulting services, SLPA will submit to ADB copies of the legal documentation\nshowing that (a) a legal corporate entity has been registered and empowered to\noperate and run the JCT, and (b) a board of directors has been established and\nempowered to operate and run the JCT.
