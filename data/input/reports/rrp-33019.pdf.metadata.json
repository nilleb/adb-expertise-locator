The  first  component  will  address  port  sector\npolicy,  institutional,  and  regulatory  issues.    This  will  include\nmeasures  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  existing  port,  in\nparticular  the  Jaya  Container  Terminal  (JCT).    It  will  also\nprepare  the  regulatory  and  planning  framework  for  port-\n  The  second\nrelated \nthe\nfor \ncomponent \nimplementation  of  the  South  Harbor  Development  Project\n(SHDP).\n\npreparatory  work \n\ntrade  operations. \n\ninternational \n\ncomprises \n\nThematic: Private Sector Development\n\nCategory A.  A full environmental impact assessment (EIA) of\nthe SHDP will be undertaken under the TA loan. This EIA will\nbe  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Environmental\nAssessment of Infrastructure Projects.\n\nAn efficient port is a major engine of growth. Not only is a port\na major activity in itself, but it requires an extensive range of\nancillary  services  and  can  support  the  development  of\ndownstream  activities.  Access  to  an  efficient  port  is  a  key\nfactor  in  the  development  of  internationally  competitive\nindustries.  As  an  island  state,  Sri  Lanka  relies  on  Colombo\nPort  for  its  international  trade  links.  The  port\u2019s  efficiency  is\nessential  for  the  country\u2019s  economic  development,  and  is  an\nimportant  determinant  of  employment  creation  and  poverty\nreduction.\n\nThe proposed TA loan will assist the Government in realizing\nthe  potential  of  Colombo  Port \nto  become  a  major\ninternationally competitive port in South Asia by (i) expanding\nprivate  sector  participation \n(ii)\nthereby\ncommercializing  public  sector  operations  and \nimproving efficiency, and (iii) adopting a strategic approach to\nenlarging  Colombo  Port  and  maximizing  private  sector\nfunding.\n\nthe  port  sector, \n\nin \n\nthe  necessary  documentation \n\nThe first component of the TA will address port sector policy,\ninstitutional,  and  regulatory  issues.

The  port  also  serves  as  the  major  conduit  for  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  international  trade.\nBecause  of  stagnation  in  the  growth  of  the  port,  the  Government  requested  the  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  assistance  for  improving  the  efficiency  and  enlarging  the\ncapacity  of  the  port.  In  1999,  ADB  provided  TA1  to  assist  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  in\nexamining  the  feasibility  of  developing  the  South  Harbor  to  increase  the  capacity  of  container\nfacilities  at  Colombo  Port.  That  TA,  which  was  completed  in  May  2001,  concluded  that  the\nSouth  Harbor  Development  Project  (SHDP)  is  feasible  but  noted  that  (i)  reforms  in  the  port\nsector are required to encourage private sector participation, (ii) efficiency levels at the existing\nJaya  Container  Terminal  (JCT)  facilities  needed  to  be  improved,  and  (iii)  the  scale  of  South\nHarbor  development  requires  additional  project  preparation.  In  January  2001,  at  the  tripartite\nmeeting  for TA 3276, the Government requested ADB to consider providing a follow-on TA to\nundertake  detailed  preparatory  work  for  the  SHDP.  The  TA  Loan  Processing  Mission2  held\ndiscussions with the Government, other stakeholders, and representatives of other aid agencies\nsupporting the port sector including the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and the\nWorld  Bank.  Following  from  these  discussions,  an  understanding  with  the  Government  was\nreached on the scope, costs, financing, and implementation arrangements for the TA.\n\nA. \n\nThe Port Sector\n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\n3.\nThe  port  sector  in  Sri  Lanka  is  dominated  by  Colombo  Port.    Only  Colombo  Port  is\nequipped  to  handle  container  traffic,  and  the  port  handles  95  percent  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  total\ninternational trade. Trincomalee and Galle are the next largest ports in terms of throughput, but\nthey handle only noncontainerized cargo.\n\n4.\nColombo Port is one of the few deepwater ports that is close to the Indian subcontinent\nand  also  lies  on  the  main  shipping  route  connecting  East  and  Southeast  Asia,  Europe,  and\nNorth and South America. It is in an excellent location to serve as a hub for regional container\nand transshipment traffic, and could command a significant market share of this trade. Between\n1987  and  1997  the  throughput  of  containers  in  Colombo  Port  increased  from  429,000  to\n1,650,000  twenty-foot  equivalent  units  (teu).  Growth  stagnated  from  1997  to  1999,  but  then\ngrew to 1,732,855 teu during 2000. The JCT in Colombo Port is presently handling 1.43 million\nteu a year and is expected to reach its maximum capacity in 2003/2004. Projections of growth in\ninternational  trade  across  the  Indian  Ocean  indicate  that  Colombo  Port  has  the  potential  for\n\n                  \n\n1 TA 3276-SRI: Port of Colombo South Harbor Development, for $1,460,000, approved on 13 October 1999.\n2 Comprising  P.Vallely,  Transport  Specialist/Mission  Leader;  M.  Mizutani,  Transport  Economist;  P.  Dutt,  Transport\n\nSpecialist; and T. Duncan, Project Economist.\n\n\f2\n\nrapid  growth.  To  exploit  this  potential  requires  that  Colombo  Port  is  perceived  within  the\nshipping industry as an internationally competitive port with adequate capacity.\n\n5.\nThe  ports  sector  is  administered  through  the  Sri  Lanka  Ports  Authority  (SLPA)  Act  of\n1979.  This  act  is  based  on  the  philosophy  of  a  government-owned  service  port,  i.e.  where  all\nservices  within  a  port  are  offered  by  a  port  authority.  Until  recently,  all  port  operations  were\nprovided  by  the  government  through  the  SLPA  but  efficiency  at  the  JCT  is  low.  In  terms  of\ncontainer  moves  per  hour,  JCT  averages  17\u201319,  whereas  the  industry  average  is  25\u201330;\nefficient ports may reach 50 moves per hour. Shipping lines are critical of ship turnaround times;\ndelays  are  caused  by  the  shift  system  used  at  the  JCT,  outmoded  work  practices,  and  high\nabsenteeism  in  the  workforce.  Although  no  systematic  analysis  has  been  carried  out,  it  is\ngenerally  felt  that  Colombo  Port  is  overstaffed.  For  domestic  cargo,  shipping  agents  have\nhighlighted causes of delays as (i) inefficient customs procedures and (ii) security measures that\nfrustrate truck movements into and out of the port. Commercial and marketing efforts need to be\nenhanced to achieve the full potential of Colombo Port.\n\nMost major ports in the world are now operated using the landlord model,3  which allows\n6.\nthe private sector to operate port infrastructure facilities and addresses the need to react swiftly\nto a rapidly changing market. The role of the state becomes that of a landlord and a regulator.\nUnder the 1979 SLPA Act, exclusive powers are given to SLPA. This is not consistent with the\nlandlord  model.  Changing  this  act  would  allow  SLPA  to  restructure  its  operations,  including\ndecentralizing  financial  and  managerial  functions,  and  to  optimize  the  use  of  private  sector\nconcessions.\n\nTo date the only private sector facility in Colombo Port is that operated by the South Asia\n7.\nGateway  Terminal  (SAGT).  SAGT  has  a  30-year  concession  to  upgrade  the  Queen  Elizabeth\nQuay  (QEQ),  provide  equipment,  and  operate  the  facility.  This  concession  was  awarded  in\n1999. The first rehabilitated berth opened in May 2001.\n\n8.\nEfficient  ports  are  perceived  to  be  catalysts  for  adding  value  to  supply  chains  and  are\npositioned to attract certain types of industries and enterprises. Although these commercial and\nindustrial  developments  require  access  to  port  facilities,  they  also  require  the  development  of\ncoordinated  actions  to  set  up  distribution  hubs,  which  are  not  currently  in  place.  To  attract\nindustries such as international procurement centers requires an efficient transportation network\nwith exemptions from taxes and duties.\n\nB. \n\nGovernment Policies\n\n9.\nIn 1997, the Government proclaimed the National Port and Shipping Policy, which sets\nout  its  vision  for  the  port  sector  as  (i)  efficient  ports  that  will  facilitate  Sri  Lankan  trade  and\ntransshipment; (ii) exporters and importers having unimpeded access to reliable and competitive\nshipping services; (iii) ancillary services that will enhance the position of Sri Lankan ports in the\nSouth  Asian  region;  (iv)  availability  of  shipbuilding  and  ship  repair  facilities;  (v)  internationally\ncompetitive  national  merchant  shipping  line(s),  capable  of  assisting  the  growth  of  the  region\u2019s\nseaborne trade; (vi) an environment that promotes safety at sea and the prevention of marine\npollution;  and  (vii)  seafarers  trained  to  international  standards.  This  policy  document  makes  a\ncommitment  to  reform  of  the  port  sector;  a  manifestation  of  this  commitment  was  the\nGovernment\u2019s privatization of the QEQ in 1999. However, the reform process then stalled until\n\n3 One whereby the port authority retains ownership of the facility but the private sector equips and operates it under\n\n                  \n\na concession.\n\n\f3\n\nthe Advisory Committee on Ports was established in 2000 to recommend measures to improve\nthe efficiency of Colombo Port. This committee was established in response to stagnation of the\ngrowth of Colombo Port after 1997, and was to address the loss of shipping lines and services\nto other ports. Of particular concern was the loss of a major shipping line to a new port in the\nMiddle  East  that  is  perceived  as  a  direct  competitor  of  Colombo.  An  interim  report  by  this\ncommittee recommended that, as a matter of urgency, a number of actions should be taken to\nthe  port.4  The  Government  has  accepted \nits\nimprove  efficiency  at \nrecommendations are being implemented.\n\nthis  report,  and \n\nC. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n10.\nModern  development  of  Colombo  Port  started  in  1980  with  the  commencement  of\nconstruction of the first phase of the JCT with funding from JBIC, then known as the Overseas\nEconomic Cooperation Fund. A series of JBIC loans through the 1980s and 1990s funded the\nenlargement of the JCT to its present four berths. In 2000, a JBIC loan was provided to upgrade\nthe JCT\u2019s computer systems, which is expected to enhance the efficiency of port operations.\n\n11.\nThe  World  Bank  assisted  the  port  sector  under  its  Port  Efficiency  Project,  which\ncommenced in 1997 and funded studies into the legal, regulatory, and management aspects of\nboth the port sector as a whole and Colombo Port in particular. The Port Efficiency Project was\nsuspended  in  1999  due  to  lack  of  agreement,  between  World  Bank  and  the  Government  on\nrestructuring the port sector.\n\n12.\nADB\u2019s  activities  in  the  Sri  Lanka  port  sector  include  a  loan  to  and  equity  investment  in\nthe SAGT for private sector development of the QEQ in Colombo Port.5 This project was ADB\u2019s\nfirst  build-operate-transfer  project  in  the  transport  sector  in  Sri  Lanka  and  was  a  major  step\ntoward the Government\u2019s objective to increase private sector involvement in the port sector.\n\nD. \n\nLessons Learned\n\n13.\nTo  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  port  sector  in  Sri  Lanka  will  require  reforms.  The\nexperience  of  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Port  Efficiency  Project  shows,  that  without  support  at  the\nhighest political level, attempts to reform the sector will be frustrated. The 2000 election brought\nin a Government that has committed itself to reform. The election also brought in a minister to\nthe Ministry of Port Development and Development of the South (MPDDS) who has adopted a\nradical  reform  agenda  and  is  receptive  to  restructuring  the  State\u2019s  role  in  the  port  sector.  The\nsupport of the Government, and of this particular minister, will be important if the proposed TA\nloan is to achieve its objectives. However, the successful SAGT concession for developing the\nQEQ  demonstrates  that  reforms  are  moving  forward  and  that  well-conceived  projects  can\nsucceed.\n\nE. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\n14.\nADB\u2019s overall strategy in Sri Lanka is to enhance private sector development through (i)\npromotion  of  an  enabling  environment  for  private  sector  activities  through  ADB\u2019s  public  sector\noperations, and (ii) direct investment in private sector companies in the form of loans and equity\nthrough operations of ADB\u2019s Private Sector Group. Consistent with this approach, ADB has to\n\n                  \n\n4 Including deepening of the southern entrance and harbor basin, expediting the SHDP, and restructuring SLPA.\n5 Loan  1689/7153-SRI:  Colombo  Port  Development  Project,  for  $35.0  million  (loan)  and  $7.4  million  (equity\n\ninvestment), approved on 11 May 1999.\n\n\f4\n\ndate  placed  strong  emphasis  on  creating  a  suitable  environment  for  the  expansion  of  private\nparticipation  in  the  economy  and  on  identifying  specific  opportunities  for  private  investment.\nFollowing  its  loan  and  equity  investment  for  the  QEQ  in  1999  (footnote  5),  ADB  provided  TA\n(footnote 1) to assist the Government in undertaking a feasibility study to determine the viability\nof  developing  Colombo  Port\u2019s  South  Harbor  through  building  a  breakwater  and  constructing\nadditional container terminals with private sector participation.\n\n15.\nFor  Colombo  Port,  the  medium-term  objective  of  this  strategy  is  to  make  the  port\ninternationally  competitive,  operated  by  the  private  sector,  with  all  investment  requirements\nbeing  financed  by  the  private  sector.  Under  this  strategy,  a  programmatic  approach  will  be\nadopted  whereby  implementation  will  be  sequential,  with  progress  from  one  stage  to  the  next\nbeing linked to the accomplishment of policy reforms. Under the proposed TA loan, assistance\nwill  be  given  to  the  Government  to  reform  the  port  sector  and  to  prepare  the  SHDP  for\nimplementation.  If  found  economically  viable,  this  will  be  followed  by  an  investment  loan  to\nprovide funding for the construction of the first phase of the SHDP. The terms of this investment\nloan, and the role of the private sector, will depend on the business plan to be developed under\nthe TA. The Government has indicated that it anticipates the need to arrange cofinancing of the\nfirst phase of the SHDP from ADB, JBIC, and the World Bank.\n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\nAn efficient port is a major engine of growth. Not only is a port a major activity in itself,\n16.\nbut  it  requires  an  extensive  range  of  ancillary  services  and  can  support  the  development  of\ndownstream  activities.  Access  to  an  efficient  port  is  a  key  factor  in  the  development  of\ninternationally competitive industries. As an island nation, Sri Lanka relies on Colombo Port for\nits  international  trade  links.  The  port\u2019s  efficiency  is  essential  for  the  country\u2019s  economic\ndevelopment, and is an important determinant of employment creation and poverty reduction. At\npresent, Colombo Port\u2019s crane handling rate for containers is about 16 boxes per hour, whereas\nmost world-class ports can achieve about 25-30 boxes per hour.\n\n17.\nColombo  Port  has  a  geographical  advantage  that  gives  it  the  potential  to  be  the\ninternational hub for South Asia. The port also has the potential to create synergies leading to\nthe  expansion  of  economic  activities  centered  around  port,  shipping,  and  related  activities.\nEfficient  transshipment  ports  attract  large  ships,  which  will  pass  on  the  benefit  of  cheaper\nshipping costs to domestic traffic.\n\nB. \n\nObjective and Scope\n\n18.\nThe proposed TA will assist the Government to realize the potential of Colombo Port to\nbecome  a  major  internationally  competitive  port  in  South  Asia  by  creating  the  environment  to\nallow  (i)  expansion  of  private  sector  participation  in  the  port  sector,  (ii)  commercialization  of\npublic sector operations and thereby improved efficiency, and (iii) adopting a strategic approach\nto  enlarging  Colombo  Port  and  maximizing  private  sector  funding.  The  TA  objectives  are\npresented in the TA Framework in Appendix 1.\n\nThe  TA  will  consist  of  two  components.  The  first  component  will  address  port  sector\n19.\npolicy, institutional, and regulatory issues. This will include measures to improve the efficiency\nof  the  existing  port,  particularly  the  JCT.  It  will  also  prepare  the  regulatory  and  planning\n\n\f5\n\nframework  for  port-related  international  trade  operations.  The  second  component  comprises\nproject preparation for the SHDP.\n\n20.\nThe Government has agreed to certain time-bound covenants related to institutional and\npolicy reforms, successful accomplishment of which will be a condition for processing a further\nloan  by  ADB  for  the  SHDP.  The  institutional  and  policy  reforms  will  be  carried  out  in  phases,\nwith the first phase commencing under the TA. It is expected that the reforms will be completed\nduring implementation of the SHDP.\n\n21.\nThe Government has agreed that the processing of a further loan by ADB for the SHDP\nwill be conditional upon (i) all personnel for JCT line management positions being filled; (ii) the\nInternational Standard Organization (ISO) 90026 compliance application will have been filed; (iii)\nthe  JCT  labor  rationalization  plan  having  been  approved  by  a  corporatized  JCT  board,\nimplementation of the plan having commenced, and the plan being acceptable to ADB; (iv) the\norganizational structure and functions of the port regulator having been finalized; and (v) private\nsector participation in the SHDP being agreed upon at the tripartite review of the business plan\n(to be prepared under this TA).7\n\n1. \n\nPolicy, Institutional, and Regulatory Issues Component\n\nThe  first  part  of  this  component  will  provide  consulting  services  to  prepare  (i)  draft\n22.\nlegislation to revise the SLPA Act to optimize the use of private sector concessions, and (ii) the\nnecessary  documentation  for  the  establishment  of  a  competition  regulator.  The  revised  SLPA\nAct  will  allow  the  Government  to  optimize  the  use  of  private  sector  concessions  not  only  in\nColombo Port but also throughout the country.\n\n23.\nThe  second  part  of  this  component  will  focus  on  increasing  the  efficiency  of  SPLA\u2019s\nexisting container terminal facilities at the JCT, beginning  with the registration of a corporatized\nentity to operate the JCT. To strengthen SLPA\u2019s capacity to manage the corporatized JCT, the\nTA  will  identify  necessary  expertise,  especially  top-level  management  positions  in  finance,\nmarketing, and information and communication technologies services. These positions will form\nthe  core  of  the  JCT  management  team  to  (i)  reorganize  administration,  management,  and\noperations at the JCT based on recommendations made under World Bank-funded studies and\nrecent  updates8;  and  (ii)  manage  the  introduction  of  ISO  9002-based  quality  standards  and\nobtain ISO 9002 certification. The intention is that the JCT management team will be an integral\npart  of  the  JCT\u2019s  corporate  management  with  the  authority  to  implement  the  reorganization.9\nThe second part of this component will also include consulting services to prepare a master plan\nto simplify port documentation and cargo clearance procedures, including implementation of an\nelectronic data interchange (EDI), which will improve the efficiency of clearance of goods.\n\nThe  third  part  of  this  component  will  prepare  the  necessary  enabling  regulations  or\n24.\nlegislation for the establishment of dedicated facilities for international trade operations such as\n\n                  \n\n6 ISO  9000  standards  are  internationally  administered  and  certified  quality  procedures  that  require  the  rigorous\nidentification  of  all  activities  within  a  manufacturing  or  service  operation.  Certification  is  renewed  annually  and  is\ninternationally recognized. For port operations the relevant standard is ISO 9002.\n\n7 At  a  minimum,  this  participation  will  consist  of  offering  concessions  for  equipping  and  operating  the  berths  to  be\nconstructed  under  the  first  phase.    If  the  business  plan  demonstrates  that  the  SHDP  is  viable  as  a  full  private\nsector-funded project, this will be a condition to approve the concession documentation.\n\n8 World Bank funded a consultant to prepare a corporate plan for the JCT. SLPA has retained the same consultant\n\nto prepare an implementation framework for this corporate plan, which is ongoing.\n\n9 I.e., the JCT management team is not intended to be merely an advisory unit.\n\n\f6\n\ninternational  procurement  centers.  It  is  envisaged  that  this  will  take  the  form  of  a\ncommercial/industrial  facility  with  exemption  from  normal  customs  and  taxation  requirements.\nThe  intent  is  that  the  facility  will  support  enterprises  that  will  increase  throughput  at  Colombo\nPort while adding value to the goods in the process.\n\n2. \n\nProject Preparation for the SHDP\n\n25.\nThe  second  component  of  the  TA  will  prepare  the  strategy  to  enlarge  the  container\ncapacity  of  Colombo  Port,  maximizing  the  use  of  private  sector  funding.  The  first  part  of  this\ncomponent  will  review  the  market  for  the  SHDP,  confirm  demand  projections,  and  prepare\nmarketing and business plans. From this work the scope of the first phase of the SHDP will be\ndefined in terms of the number of berths. The business plan will also include a definition of the\nfactors  necessary  to  obtain  commitment  from  shipping  lines  and  terminal  operators  to  the\nSHDP,  and  an  options  analysis  for  packaging  of  concessions  under  the  TA.  The  options\nanalysis  will  address  maximizing  private  sector  input  and  minimizing  public  sector  funding.10\nThe  second  part  of  this  component  will  prepare  the  contractual  documentation  required  to\ncommence  the  construction  of  the  first  phase  of  the  South  Harbor.  Under  this  part,  detailed\nconcession documents will be drawn up, expressions of interest invited and evaluated, and bids\nevaluated. Simultaneously, detailed engineering parameters will be prepared for the major civil\nworks components, including breakwaters, sea walls, approach channels, turning and berthing\nbasin,  relocation  of  an  existing  pipeline,  and  engineering  parameters  for  the  terminals.  These\nparameters will define the technical and operational limitations within which the SHDP must be\nconstructed. Work under this component will continue until the award of all concessions, and will\ninclude the technical, financial, and commercial evaluation of bids. The consulting services for\nthis  component  include  the  provision  of  three  experts  to  form  the  South  Harbor  Development\nTeam (SHDT). The SHDT will work closely with SLPA to manage the implementation planning\nfor  the  SHDP.  The  third  part  of  this  component  will  include  the  preparation  of  a  summary\nenvironmental  impact  assessment;  a  full  environmental  impact  assessment;  an  initial  social\nanalysis; a full social analysis, if required; and a poverty impact study. The TA also provides for\na  panel  of  experts  to  review  the  proposed  SHDP  with  respect  to  commercial,  technical,  and\noperational viability.\n\nTo  supplement  SLPA\u2019s  implementation  capacity,  this  component  will  finance  additional\n26.\nline  management  positions  for  the  SHDT.  This  team  will  manage  the  SHDP  in  terms  of  (i)\nevaluation  of  bids  and  negotiation  of  concessions,  and  (ii)  monitoring  and  facilitating  Project\nimplementation.  The  team  will  be  an  integral  part  of  SLPA  management  to  implement  the\nbusiness plan.\n\n10 The potential for private sector participation in the expansion of Colombo Port through the SHDP will be analyzed\n\n                  \n\nin terms of\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\npart privatization of movable assets, wherein cargo handling and storage would be private while the\nbreakwater, channels,  and quay wall would remain public;\npart privatization of terminal, where in the quay wall and movable assets would be private while the\nchannels and breakwater would remain public;\npublic/private partnership, wherein the channels, breakwater, and quay wall would be organized on\na public-private partnership basis, and cargo handling and storage would be private;\nfull privatization; wherein all elements of the SHDP would be privatized.\n\nThe  selection  of  privatization  option  is  dependent  on  further  analysis  under  the  TA,  which  will  take  into\nconsideration  projections  of  the  increase  in  port  traffic,  level  of  port  competition,  ability  to  optimize  scale  and\ncapacity utilization, and divisibility of port assets.\n\n\fC. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan\n\n7\n\n27.\nThe total cost of the TA is estimated at $14.40 million equivalent, comprising a foreign\nexchange  component  of  $7.99  million  (about  55  percent  of  the  total  TA  cost)  and  a  local\ncurrency  component  of  $6.41  million  equivalent  (about  45  percent).  It  is  proposed  that  ADB\nprovide a loan of $10.0 million equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and part of\nthe local currency cost of the TA. The Government will finance the remaining local cost of $4.4\nmillion equivalent, comprising remuneration for consultants for the SHDT, counterpart staff, and\nthe junior administration and support staff assigned to the consultants; the project management\nunit (PMU); office accommodation; local transport; part of the field surveys and model simulation\ncosts; part of the reports and communications costs; and taxes and duties. The Borrower will be\nthe  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka.    A  summary  of  the  financing  plan  is  given  in\nTable 1, and detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2.\n\nTable 1: TA Cost and Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nSource\n\nADB\nGovernment\n\nTotal\n\nForeign\nExchange\n7.99\n\n7.99\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n2.01\n4.40\n6.41\n\nTotal Costs\n\nPercent\n\n10.00\n4.40\n14.40\n\n69\n31\n100\n\n28.\nADB will provide a loan in an amount equivalent to $10.0 million from the Special Funds\nresources, with a maturity period of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and an annual\ninterest rate of 1 percent during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\n\nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1. \n\nProject Organization and Coordination\n\n29.\nMPDDS  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA.  A  steering  committee  will  be\nestablished to give overall guidance to the TA, comprised of representatives of the Ministry of\nFinance  (MOF),  MPDDS,  SLPA,  ADB,  JBIC,  and  the  World  Bank.  Reviews  of  sector  reforms\nand  the  progress  of  TA  implementation  will  be  made  at  tripartite  meetings.  A  TA  organization\nchart  can  be  found  in  Appendix  3.  SLPA  will  recruit  the  core  staff  for  the  PMU  from  the  open\nmarket in accordance with Government procedures, which are acceptable to ADB. The PMU will\nsupervise the work under the TA for the JCT and SHDP.\n\n2. \n\nConsulting Services\n\nConsulting services for the TA will be carried out under two contracts. The first contract\n30.\nwill be for the panel of experts and the second for the main services. Outline terms of reference\nare  provided  in  Appendix  4.  The  individual  consultants  for  the  first  contract  will  be  experts  of\ninternational repute and will be selected by the steering committee. The steering committee will\nreview  all  nominations,  and  selection  will  be  on  the  basis  of  voting  by  its  members.  The  main\nservices  will  be  undertaken  by  an  international  firm  of  consultants  in  association  with  suitably\nqualified  domestic  consultants.  These  consultants  will  be  required  to  have  expertise  in  (i)\nrevising  port  sector \nlegislation  and  establishing  a  port  regulator;  (ii)  port  operations\nreengineering,  information  systems  (including  EDI),  and  ISO  certification  for  an  existing\ncontainer  facility;  (iii)  taxation,  logistics,  and  marketing  relating  to  international  procurement\ncenter/distribution  hubs;  (iv)  market  analysis,  economic  analysis,  financial  analysis,  and\n\n\f8\n\nconcession  planning  related  to  preparing  a  business  plan  and  the  management  of  a  new\ncontainer facility; (v) port planning, engineering, concession documentation, and environmental\nimpact  assessment  required \nto  prepare  engineering  designs  and  concession/contract\ndocumentation for a new container facility; and (vi) social and development impacts of the new\ncontainer  facility.  At  MPDDS\u2019s  request,  ADB  approved  advance  action  for  the  recruitment  of\nconsultants  on  the  understanding  that  such  approval  would  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the\nproposed  TA.  The  contract  for  the  main  services  will  include  equipment  to  be  procured  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement. As this equipment consists of off-the-shelf\nitems  of  office  equipment,  direct  purchase  will  be  allowed.  The  equipment  to  be  procured  is\nlisted in Appendix 4.  Management gave approval for advance procurement action on 30 April\n2001.\n\nApproximately  463  person-months  of  total  consulting  services  will  be  required,\n31.\ncomprising  approximately  285  person-months  of  international  and  178  person-months  of\ndomestic consultants. All consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on\nthe Use of Consultants. Domestic junior, administrative, and support staff will be in addition to\nthe above domestic person-months.\n\n3. \n\nDisbursements\n\nTA \n\nloan  disbursement  arrangements  will  be \n\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan\n32.\nDisbursement Handbook. Payment of ADB\u2019s portion of the consulting services will be subject to\ndirect  payment  procedures  from  ADB  to  the  consultants  against  withdrawal  applications\nsubmitted by MPDDS to ADB.\n\n4. \n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n33.\nIt  is  expected  that  the  TA  will  commence  in  January  2002  and  will  be  completed  by\nAugust  2003.  An  implementation  schedule  is  given  in  Appendix  5.  Milestones  have  been\nestablished at three points. After the preparation of the business plan for the SHDP, a tripartite\nmeeting among the Government (MPDDS and SLPA), ADB, and the consultants will be held to\nreview the status, and viability, of both sector reforms and the business plan before proceeding\nwith  the  next  phase.  This  meeting  will  also  review  the  report  of  the  panel  of  experts  on  the\nviability of the business plan of the SHDP to be developed under this TA. A second milestone\nwill  occur  when  the  draft  concession  documents  and  the  evaluation  report  on  expressions  of\ninterest have been submitted for review by a tripartite meeting. This meeting will also review the\nreport of the panel of experts on the viability of the procurement documentation for the SHDP.\nThe  conditions  to  be  accomplished  by  this  second  milestone  will  be  those  required  to\ncommence processing of the proposed ADB loan for the SHDP. The third milestone will occur\nbefore the award of concessions/contracts for the SHDP, when a tripartite meeting will approve\nthe negotiated concessions/contracts.\n\nE. \n\nFinancial and Economic Analysis\n\nFinancial  analyses  were  carried  out  for  the  public  and  private  sector  portions  of  the\n34.\nSHDP separately. For the public sector portion, it was assumed that the revenues are those to\nbe collected by SLPA from harbor dues charged to ships, seaward navigation, pilotage charges,\nconcession  fixed  rentals  and  a  concession  fee  on  each  teu  handled  by  the  operator.  The  net\npresent value (NPV) of the financial returns gained by SLPA is SLRs15,427 million. The costs\nincurred  by  SLPA  are  for  construction,  maintenance,  and  operation  of  the  breakwater,  harbor\nbasin, and channel. The NPV of the financial costs of SLPA is SLRs17,424 million, giving a net\n\n\f9\n\nfinancial benefit-cost ratio of 0.89 for SLPA. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is 10.9\npercent.\n\n35.\nFor  the  private  sector  portion  of  the  SHDP,  the  revenues  are  fees  collected  by  the\nterminal operator including wharf fees, storage, stevedoring, wharf handling, and other services\nto vessels calling at the terminal. The NPV of the financial benefits derived by the private sector\nis  SLRs114,620  million.  The  costs  include  capital,  maintenance,  and  operating  costs  for  the\nberths,  terminal  handling  equipment,  and  associated  infrastructure  on  land;  buildings;\nequipment;  and  storage.  The  NPV  of  the  financial  costs  of  the  private  sector  is  SLRs73,681,\ngiving a net benefit-cost ratio of 1.55 and an FIRR of 26.7 percent.\n\n36.\nFor the economic analysis, it is important to disaggregate the benefits that will accrue to\nthe  Sri  Lankan  economy  from  the  benefits  that  will  flow  to  overseas  entities.  Only  preliminary\nestimates of benefits and costs are available at this stage. It was estimated that 40 percent of\nthe profits generated by the concession company will be repatriated overseas11 and that only 25\npercent of the consumer surplus generated from SHDP will accrue to the Sri Lankan economy.12\nBased  on  the  preliminary  figures,  it  is  estimated  that  the  NPV  of  the  economic  benefits  to  Sri\nLanka is SLRs122,375 million.13 The NPV of economic costs is SLRs90,284 million. This gives\na net benefit-cost ratio of 1.35 and an estimated economic internal rate of return of 19.2 percent.\nThese economic analysis estimates show that a priori this project is economically justified based\non the benefits that will remain in the country. However, a more conclusive economic analysis\nwill be carried out under the TA.\n\nF. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Issues\n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts\n\n37.\nPreliminary  environmental  investigations  were  undertaken  under  TA  3276  (footnote  1).\nHowever, the scope of work under that TA was not sufficient to obtain environmental approval of\nthe construction of the SHDP. Services under the proposed TA loan provide for completing a full\nenvironmental  impact  assessment  of  the  SHDP  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for\nEnvironmental Assessment of Infrastructure Projects, Environmental Assessment Requirements\nof  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (March  1998),  and  the  requirements  of  the  Coastal\nConservation Department and Central Environmental Agency of Sri Lanka.\n\n2. \n\nSocial Impacts and Poverty Impact\n\n38. Work  under  TA  3276  established  that  social  issues  with  respect  to  the  construction  of\nthe SHDP were limited. The SHDP will be constructed entirely within the existing port area, and\nno  resettlement  will  be  required.  Social  impacts  resulting  from  the  construction  work  are\nexpected  to  be  limited  to  those  associated  with  (i)  rock  quarries  and  transport  of  rock  to  the\nSHDP, and (ii) facilities for and the impact of construction camps. Consultant services under the\nproposed  TA  loan  include  those  for  a  social  impact  assessment  in  accordance  with  the\nrequirements of ADB\u2019s Handbook for Poverty and Social Analysis, and a poverty impact study\non the impact of the development on poverty reduction.\n\n                  \n\n11 The  implicit  assumption  is  that  the  concession  company  running  the  terminal  will  have  40  percent  foreign\n\nownership, i.e., the same level as the current SAGT company.\n\n12 Indigenous cargo forms only 25 percent of the traffic handled by the port; 75 percent is transshipment traffic.\n13 About SLRs85,965 million or 70 percent of the net benefits accruing to Sri Lanka is in fact generated from revenues\n\nderived from transshipment traffic.\n\n\f10\n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES\n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n39.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nAt least 1 week prior to the tripartite meeting to review the SHDP business plan,\nSLPA  will  have  submitted  the  business  plan  to  the  steering  committee  for\napproval.\n\nNo  later  than  three  months  after  the  award  of  the  main  services  contract  for\nconsulting services, SLPA will submit to ADB copies of the legal documentation\nshowing that (a) a legal corporate entity has been registered and empowered to\noperate and run the JCT, and (b) a board of directors has been established and\nempowered to operate and run the JCT. SLPA will also submit evidence that the\nJCT has been fully staffed and equipped as agreed upon with ADB.\n\nNo later than six months after the award of the main services contract, the JCT\nwill  have  recruited  four  skilled  managers  for  the  key  management  positions,  as\nagreed  upon  with  SLPA,  and  suitable  documentation  (such  as  employment\ncontracts) evidencing such recruitment will have been submitted to ADB.\n\nNo later than six months after the award of the main services contract, the JCT\nboard will have approved a labor rationalization plan, and will have submitted a\ncopy of the board resolution and plan to ADB.\n\nBy  31  December  2002,  MPDDS  will  have  finalized  the  organizational  structure\nand functions of the port regulator, and a copy of the legal documents evidencing\nthe same will have been submitted to ADB.\n\nNo later than 12 months after the award of the main services contract, the JCT\nwill have filed the application for ISO 9002 compliance, and will have submitted\nto ADB copies of the application for assessment.\n\n(vii)  No later than 12 months after the award of the main services contract, MPDDS\nwill have advised ADB in writing that private sector participation in the SHDP is\nas agreed upon at the tripartite review of the business plan.\n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness\n\nB. \n\n40.\n\nThe following condition for loan effectiveness will be included in the TA Loan Agreement:\n\n(i) \n\nSLPA  will  have  submitted  to  ADB  (i)  a  copy  of  the  legal  documentation,\nacceptable  to  ADB,  evidencing  that  a  corporate  entity  has  been  registered  with\nthe  sole  purpose  of  operating  the  JCT;  and  (ii)  confirmation  that  all  other  legal\nrequirements to allow the JCT to operate as a wholly owned Government entity\nhave been carried out.\n\n\f11\n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\n41.\nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to\nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  7,878,000  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the\nColombo Port Efficiency and Expansion Project with a term of 32 years, including a grace period\nof  8  years,  and  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace\nperiod  and  1.5  percent  per  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are\nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement  presented  to  the\nBoard.\n\n4 September 2001\n\nTADAO CHINO\nPresident\n\n\f12\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNumber Title\n\nPage\n\nCited on\n(page, para.)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nTechnical Assistance Framework\n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan\n\nTechnical Assistance Organization Chart\n\nOutline Terms of Reference for Consulting Services\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n13\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n22\n\n4, 18\n\n7, 27\n\n7, 29\n\n7, 30\n\n8, 33\n\n\fTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\n\nTargets/Inputs\n\nMonitoring Mechanisms Assumptions/Risks\n\nColombo Port capacity increases to 4\nmillion twenty-foot equivalent units by\n2007.\n\n.\n\nProgress reports and\nother monitoring\nmechanisms of the\nsubsequent investment\nproject\n\nAcceptance by the Government of (i)\nreform of the Sri Lanka Port Authority\n(SLPA)  Act and establishment of a\nport regulator; (ii) the business plan for\nthe South Harbor Development Project\n(SHDP); and (iii) award of a\nconcession for the SHDP\n\nMarket demand analysis and business\nplan is completed by the end of month\n3, institutional reforms by the end of\nmonth 12, and concession documents\nand engineering parameters by the\nend of month 7 of consulting services.\n\nSteering committee\nmeetings, inception\nreports, interim reports,\nprogress reports and\ntechnical design reports\n\nExpert panel to review\ntechnical design\n\nGovernment will carry out\nprocurement procedures to appoint\nconsultants expeditiously.\n\nAvailability of counterpart support\nand financing\n\nGovernment expedites approval of\nlegal reforms and establishment of\nregulator.\n\nDesign Summary\n1.
