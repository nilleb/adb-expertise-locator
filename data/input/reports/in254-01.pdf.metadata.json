EPD provides the President with information, analysis, and advice on economic policy and prepares proposals on\neconomic issues. It assists the President in controlling and monitoring (i) the economic activities of the Government and\nother agencies; and (ii) the implementation of laws, presidential decrees, resolutions, and directives on economic issues.\nEPD has limited analytical and policy formulation capacity. This is particularly so as regards monetary and fiscal policy.\nConsequently, in September 1998, the Government requested advisory technical assistance from the Asian Development\nBank to strengthen capacity in EPD. Following detailed discussions with EPD during fact-finding conducted in July 1998,\nwhich resulted in understanding being reached on the objectives, scope, costs, terms of reference and implementation\narrangements, ADB approved technical assistance for this purpose in August 1999.\nTA OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE:\nThe objective of the TA was to strengthen EPD\u2019s capacity to (i) track key developments in the economy; (ii) initiate\nand  manage  macroeconomic  policy  and  reforms,  monitor  their  progress  and  asses  their  impact;  and  (iii)  improve\ncoordination mechanisms related to the reform process.\nTo achieve this objective, the scope of the TA covered three main areas: developing an effective and systematic\nmonitoring of macroeconomic developments and reforms; providing policy advice to the President on economic matters;\nand improving coordination mechanisms for key government agencies involved in economic management. In the first of the\nabove areas, the TA sought to meet EPD\u2019s requirements by identifying a selected subset of macroeconomic indicators with\nan emphasis on the particular requirements of the Kyrgyz economy and its reform program. A computer-based reporting\nsystem consisting of the selected macro indicators was to be established. EPD staff would be trained to systematically\nevaluate reports for effective monitoring, and to make appropriate and timely proposals to the President regarding\nmacroeconomic matters. In the second of the above areas, the skills of concerned EPD staff in providing policy advice on\nmajor economic issues would be upgraded through on-the-job training by the consultants to be fielded under the TA.\nParticular emphases was to be placed on (i) fiscal, monetary, and external policy, and debt management; and (ii) providing\npolicy advice on and assessing the impact of the Government\u2019s ongoing program of macroeconomic stabilization and\nstructural reforms. Finally, the TA sought to assist EPD in identifying the major impediments to effective coordination of the\nkey economic agencies, in systemizing and establishing improved coordination mechanisms both between it and the\nconcerned agencies and between the agencies themselves.\nTA INPUTS EVALUATION:\nThe TA envisaged a total of 39 person months of consultant inputs comprising 9 person months of international\nconsultant (Adviser) and 30 person months of domestic consultants in the monetary and fiscal areas. The Adviser was\nenvisaged to be fielded intermittently over three work assignments of 3 months each. The work of the Adviser was cut down\nby 15 days in his last work assignment owing to the security developments in the region arising from the terrorist incidents\nof 11 September 2001 in the USA. This did not have any real impact on the outcome of the project as the Adviser was able\nto finish the final report of the TA to the satisfaction of both the Government and the ADB. The project design and terms of\nreference (TOR) were generally satisfactory. However, an important element of the TOR viz. improving coordination with\nand between key economic agencies was not addressed under the TA. The TA design envisaged that the Adviser should\nhave experience in providing similar high-level  advisory services. The Adviser selected under the TA was particularly\nsuited for the task since he was well qualified for the job and fluent in the Russian language. The monitoring  of  the TA was", "delegated to ADB\u2019s Kyrgyz Resident Mission resulting in closer supervision and interaction with the Government and the\nconsultants during implementation. Both the Government and the ADB found the consultant inputs as timely, pertinent and\nof a high quality. EPD took a keen interest in the Implementation of the TA and the President of the Kyrgyz Republic has\nalso expressed his appreciation of the project.\nTA OUTPUTS EVALUATION:\nThe TA resulted in considerable benefits for EPD: (i) existing economic reporting systems were examined and\nanalyzed and deficiencies identified; (ii) a set of macroeconomic indicators focusing on monetary and fiscal aspects was\ndeveloped; (iii) a computerized database system using these indicators was set up in EPD; (iv) EPD staff were trained on\nthe  composition,  maintenance  and  interpretation  of  the  database;  (v)  general  macroeconomic  training  needed  to\ncomprehend the data and undertake meaningful analysis was also provided; (vi) a reporting system from key economic\nagencies to keep the database current was established; (vii) the preparation of economic reports for briefing the President\nand senior EPD and Government staff was instituted; (viii) advice was provided to EPD staff on a wide range of issues that\nwere examined for the President\u2019s attention; and (ix) on-the-job training was provided to EPD staff to prepare policy\nproposals and monitor progress and impact of the Government\u2019s reform program.\nWhen evaluating the TA outputs it needs to be recognized that the benefits of the training imparted were affected\nby the frequent turnover of EPD staff.  Another factor to be recognized is that one of the original thrusts of the TA, namely,\nimproving coordination with and between key economic agencies was not undertaken. This proved to be an issue of wider\nscope than could be tackled under the TA. The coordination among the agencies has been identified as one of the major\nproblems to be addressed under the Comprehensive Development Framework (CDF) till the year 2010. The CDF is the\ncountry\u2019s blueprint for future social and economic development and is a document of immense national importance. The\nCDF Secretariat which was set up recently under the aegis of EPD for the implementation of the CDF has improving\ncoordination between key public agencies as one of its principal goals. An adequate counterpoise to the above aspects,  is\nthe fact that the  TA achieved a number of strategic and important outputs which were not originally a part of the TOR. The\nAdviser was invited on a number of occasions to meet with the President to discuss various economic issues. He prepared\nthree major policy statements for delivery by the President in the context of the formulation of the CDF. Another major\ncontribution was the key role played by the Adviser in the editing and the finalization of the CDF document during April and\nMay 2001. His inputs in this regard were highly valued by the Government and contributed significantly to ensuring the\nlogic, structure and content of the paper.\nTA OVERALL ASSESSMENT AND RATING:\nThe project outcomes have met most of its objectives and purposes and the only specific purpose missed has\nbeen the formal establishment of interagency coordination mechanisms on economic policy. Offsetting this is the excellent\ncontributions under the TA in the formulation and finalization of the important CDF document. In addition, the project has\nexceeded  design  expectations  in  the  areas  of  developing  economic  policy  and  providing  guidance  to  EPD  in  its\nimplementation. On the completion of the TA, a very good economic and social database has been set up in EPD,\nthoroughly documented, and staff trained in its maintenance and operation.  Overall, the TA is found to be \u201cSuccessful.\u201d\nMAJOR LESSONS LEARNED:\nSome of the training benefits of the TA have been affected by the frequent turnover of staff in EPD.  A number of\nthe staff trained under the TA have moved on to other jobs and postings. Whereas movement to better paying jobs in the\nprivate sector cannot be prevented, a firm commitment needs to be obtained from the Office of the President, to ensure the\nretention of staff in EPD to the extent possible as a condition to any future assistance. Other lessons learned are that (i)\nadvisers need to be flexible in their approach to their task and not strictly limited by the terms of reference as the needs of\nsuch a high level agency can change over time; and (ii) familiarity with the Russian language is very important advantage in\nsuch a project owing to the volume of documents that need to be read/worked on.\nFOLLOW-UP ACTION AND RECOMMENDATIONS:\nThe TA has been successful in meeting its overall objective. ADB needs to extend follow-up support for further\nstrengthening capacity in EPD and to build upon the foundations laid under this project.\nPrepared by: J. C.
