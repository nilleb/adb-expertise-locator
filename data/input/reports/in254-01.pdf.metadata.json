EPD provides the President with information, analysis, and advice on economic policy and prepares proposals on\neconomic  issues.  It  assists  the  President  in  controlling  and  monitoring  (i)  the  economic  activities  of  the  Government  and\nother agencies;  and  (ii)  the  implementation  of  laws,  presidential  decrees,  resolutions,  and  directives  on  economic  issues.\nEPD  has  limited  analytical  and  policy  formulation  capacity.  This  is  particularly  so  as  regards  monetary  and  fiscal  policy.\nConsequently, in September 1998, the Government requested advisory technical assistance from the Asian Development\nBank  to  strengthen  capacity  in  EPD.  Following  detailed  discussions  with  EPD  during  fact-finding  conducted  in  July  1998,\nwhich  resulted  in  understanding  being  reached  on  the  objectives,  scope,  costs,  terms  of  reference  and  implementation\narrangements, ADB approved technical assistance for this purpose in August 1999.\n\nTA OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE:\n\nThe objective of the TA was to strengthen EPD\u2019s capacity to (i) track key developments in the economy; (ii) initiate\nand  manage  macroeconomic  policy  and  reforms,  monitor  their  progress  and  asses  their  impact;  and  (iii)  improve\ncoordination mechanisms related to the reform process.\n\nTo achieve this objective, the scope of the TA covered three main areas: developing an effective and systematic\nmonitoring  of  macroeconomic  developments  and  reforms;  providing  policy  advice  to  the  President  on  economic  matters;\nand improving coordination mechanisms for key government agencies involved in economic management. In the first of the\nabove areas, the TA sought to meet EPD\u2019s requirements by identifying a selected subset of macroeconomic indicators with\nan  emphasis  on  the  particular  requirements  of  the  Kyrgyz  economy  and  its  reform  program.  A  computer-based  reporting\nsystem  consisting  of  the  selected  macro  indicators  was  to  be  established.  EPD  staff  would  be  trained  to  systematically\nevaluate  reports  for  effective  monitoring,  and  to  make  appropriate  and  timely  proposals  to  the  President  regarding\nmacroeconomic matters. In the second of the above areas, the skills of concerned EPD staff in providing policy advice on\nmajor  economic  issues  would  be  upgraded  through  on-the-job  training  by  the  consultants  to  be  fielded  under  the  TA.\nParticular emphases was to be placed on (i) fiscal, monetary, and external policy, and debt management; and (ii) providing\npolicy  advice  on  and  assessing  the  impact  of  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing  program  of  macroeconomic  stabilization  and\nstructural reforms. Finally, the TA sought to assist EPD in identifying the major impediments to effective coordination of the\nkey  economic  agencies,  in  systemizing  and  establishing  improved  coordination  mechanisms  both  between  it  and  the\nconcerned agencies and between the agencies themselves.\n\nTA INPUTS EVALUATION:\n\nThe TA envisaged a total of 39 person months of consultant inputs comprising 9 person months  of international\nconsultant  (Adviser)  and  30  person  months  of  domestic  consultants  in  the  monetary  and  fiscal  areas.  The  Adviser  was\nenvisaged to be fielded intermittently over three work assignments of 3 months each. The work of the Adviser was cut down\nby 15 days in his last work assignment owing to the security developments in the region arising from the terrorist incidents\nof 11 September 2001 in the USA. This did not have any real impact on the outcome of the project as the Adviser was able\nto finish the final report of the TA to the satisfaction of both the Government and the ADB. The project design and terms of\nreference  (TOR)  were  generally  satisfactory.  However,  an  important  element  of  the  TOR  viz.  improving  coordination  with\nand between key economic agencies was not addressed under the TA. The TA design envisaged that the Adviser should\nhave  experience  in  providing  similar  high-level    advisory  services.  The  Adviser  selected  under  the  TA  was  particularly\nsuited for the task since he was well qualified for the job and fluent in the Russian language. The monitoring  of  the TA was\n\n\fdelegated  to  ADB\u2019s  Kyrgyz  Resident  Mission  resulting  in  closer  supervision  and  interaction  with  the  Government  and  the\nconsultants during implementation. Both the Government and the ADB found the consultant inputs as timely, pertinent and\nof a high quality. EPD took a keen interest in the Implementation of the TA and the President of the Kyrgyz Republic has\nalso expressed his appreciation of the project.\n\nTA OUTPUTS EVALUATION:\n\nThe  TA  resulted  in  considerable  benefits  for  EPD:  (i)  existing  economic  reporting  systems  were  examined  and\nanalyzed  and  deficiencies  identified;  (ii)  a  set  of  macroeconomic  indicators  focusing  on  monetary  and  fiscal  aspects  was\ndeveloped; (iii) a computerized database system using these indicators was set up in EPD; (iv) EPD staff were trained on\nthe  composition,  maintenance  and  interpretation  of  the  database;  (v)  general  macroeconomic  training  needed  to\ncomprehend  the  data  and  undertake  meaningful  analysis  was  also  provided;  (vi)  a  reporting  system  from  key  economic\nagencies to keep the database current was established; (vii) the preparation of economic reports for briefing the President\nand senior EPD and Government staff was instituted; (viii) advice was provided to EPD staff on a wide range of issues that\nwere  examined  for  the  President\u2019s  attention;  and  (ix)  on-the-job  training  was  provided  to  EPD  staff  to  prepare  policy\nproposals and monitor progress and impact of the Government\u2019s reform program.\n\nWhen evaluating the TA outputs it needs to be recognized that the benefits of the training imparted were affected\nby the frequent turnover of EPD staff.  Another factor to be recognized is that one of the original thrusts of the TA, namely,\nimproving coordination with and between key economic agencies was not undertaken. This proved to be an issue of wider\nscope than could be tackled under the TA. The coordination among the agencies has been identified as one of the major\nproblems  to  be  addressed  under  the  Comprehensive  Development  Framework  (CDF)  till  the  year  2010.  The  CDF  is  the\ncountry\u2019s  blueprint  for  future  social  and  economic  development  and  is  a  document  of  immense  national  importance.  The\nCDF  Secretariat  which  was  set  up  recently  under  the  aegis  of  EPD  for  the  implementation  of  the  CDF  has  improving\ncoordination between key public agencies as one of its principal goals. An adequate counterpoise to the above aspects,  is\nthe fact that the  TA achieved a number of strategic and important outputs which were not originally a part of the TOR. The\nAdviser was invited on a number of occasions to meet with the President to discuss various economic issues. He prepared\nthree  major  policy  statements  for  delivery  by  the  President  in  the  context  of  the  formulation  of  the  CDF.  Another  major\ncontribution was the key role played by the Adviser in the editing and the finalization of the CDF document during April and\nMay  2001.  His  inputs  in  this  regard  were  highly  valued  by  the  Government  and  contributed  significantly  to  ensuring  the\nlogic, structure and content of the paper.\n\nTA OVERALL ASSESSMENT AND RATING:\n\nThe  project  outcomes  have  met  most  of  its  objectives  and  purposes  and  the  only  specific  purpose  missed  has\nbeen the formal establishment of interagency coordination mechanisms on economic policy. Offsetting this is the excellent\ncontributions under the TA in the formulation and finalization of the important CDF document. In addition, the project has\nexceeded  design  expectations  in  the  areas  of  developing  economic  policy  and  providing  guidance  to  EPD  in  its\nimplementation.  On  the  completion  of  the  TA,  a  very  good  economic  and  social  database  has  been  set  up  in  EPD,\nthoroughly documented, and staff trained in its maintenance and operation.  Overall, the TA is found to be \u201cSuccessful.\u201d\n\nMAJOR LESSONS LEARNED:\n\nSome of the training benefits of the TA have been affected by the frequent turnover of staff in EPD.  A number of\nthe staff trained under the TA have moved on to other jobs and postings. Whereas movement to better paying jobs in the\nprivate sector cannot be prevented, a firm commitment needs to be obtained from the Office of the President, to ensure the\nretention of staff in EPD to the extent possible as a condition to any future assistance. Other lessons learned are that (i)\nadvisers need to be flexible in their approach to their task and not strictly limited by the terms of reference as the needs of\nsuch a high level agency can change over time; and (ii) familiarity with the Russian language is very important advantage in\nsuch a project owing to the volume of documents that need to be read/worked on.\n\nFOLLOW-UP ACTION AND RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\nThe  TA  has  been  successful  in  meeting  its  overall  objective.  ADB  needs  to  extend  follow-up  support  for  further\n\nstrengthening capacity in EPD and to build upon the foundations laid under this project.\n\nPrepared by:\n\nJ. C.
