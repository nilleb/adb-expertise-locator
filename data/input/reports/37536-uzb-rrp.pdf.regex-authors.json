An initial environmental examination was undertaken. The summary \nAssessment  is presented in Supplementary Appendix S. \n   \nProject  Land degradation is a serious economic, social, and environmental problem in \nDescription  Uzbekistan and the rest of Central Asia. It directly affects the livelihoods of the \n  rural  population  by  reducing  land  productivity,  and  by  causing  agricultural \n  production losses estimated at $2 billion a year for the region.  \n \nThe Project will address the rapidly worsening and expanding land degradation in \nnine districts in Bukhara, Kashkadarya, and Navoi provinces. The project area, \ncovering  162,300  hectares  (ha)  of  irrigated  land,  suffers from  increased  soil \nsalinity  and  shallow  groundwater  table\u2014the  most  serious  forms  of  land \ndegradation. Crop yields in these areas reportedly have declined by 30% since \n1991.  These  problems  are  caused  by  (i)  poor  water  management,  (ii) \ndeteriorating  irrigation  and  drainage  (I&D)  infrastructure,  and  (iii)  a  policy \nenvironment that constrains production growth and reduces incentives to invest \nin  land  improvement.  Worsening  land  degradation  directly  affects  a  rural \npopulation of 1.4 million in the project districts. \n \nTo help the Government halt and reverse land degradation, the Project will (i) \ndevelop and disseminate improved land reclamation practices adapted to local \nconditions;  (ii)  strengthen  institutions  to  address  land  degradation  issues  at \ncentral,  provincial,  and  community  levels;  and  (iii)  improve  land  and  water \nmanagement infrastructure to enhance water control and efficiency. Through \nagreed policy reforms, the Project also will help to increase farmers\u2019 incentives to \nraise land productivity and invest in land, as well as improve rural governance.  \n  \nRationale   Agriculture remains the major source of livelihood for rural communities, which \nare home to 60% of the population, and is critical to attaining inclusive and \nsustainable growth for the economy. The Government has prioritized improving \nagricultural productivity, particularly maximizing export revenues and achieving \nfood security. However, rapidly worsening land degradation is threatening the \nperformance of the agriculture sector.  \n \nThe proposed Project would target areas that experience the most severe land \ndegradation in Uzbekistan. The Project design harnesses the experience of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  lessons  gained  from  relevant  land \nmanagement  and  agriculture  projects  in  Uzbekistan,  the  subregion,  and \nelsewhere. ", "iv   \n  The  Project  is  based  on  the  premise,  derived  from  ADB  experience  and \nsupported  by  the  Government,  that  an  enabling  policy  environment  that \npromotes and encourages farmers\u2019 incentives is needed to support sustainable \nland management. This is the principle behind the ongoing agriculture sector \nreform initiative, spearheaded by ADB and the World Bank, which focuses on (i) \nreducing  the  mandatory  state  procurement  quota  on  cotton  and  wheat;  (ii) \nimproving pricing; (iii) ensuring timely payments to farmers; and (iv) liberalizing \nmarketing of these commodities, thereby ensuring greater freedom and improved \nprofitability of producers. This approach will be extended and deepened in the \nproject  districts,  enabling  farmers  to  benefit  directly  from  increased  crop \nproduction and to develop the financial capacity to invest in land improvement. \nThe Project also recognizes that incentives to look after their farmland must go \nhand  in  hand  with  improved  and  more  secure  access  to  land.  Additionally, \ninstitutions responsible for land management must be strengthened and their \ncapacity developed, including their knowledge and skills to implement custom \nsolutions  to  the  worsening  land  degradation.  Land  and  water  management \ninfrastructure, which has deteriorated seriously since independence in 1991, also \nmust be improved through cost-effective investments, taking into account the \nneed for sustained operation and management in the future. \n \nThe  Project  builds  on  the  agriculture  sector  reform  initiatives  that  ADB  has \nmaintained in Uzbekistan since its first project in 2002. It will help Uzbekistan \naddress  its  land  degradation  problems  in  a  multipronged  manner,  covering \nincentives, institutions, and infrastructure. Through cofinancing with the Global \nEnvironment Facility (GEF), the Project also aims to allow long-term planning \nand  implementation  of  corrective  interventions  to  prevent  and  control  land \ndegradation beyond the project area. \n \nImpact and  The expected impact of the Project is increased income of farmers in the project \nOutcome  area. The project outcome would be improved quality and sustainable productivity \nof land, leading to higher crop yields and enhanced ecological sustainability in the \nproject areas.  \n \n  The intended outcome will be produced through investments to rehabilitate land \nand water infrastructure, as well as the application of improved land and water \nmanagement  practices.  These  will  be  carried  out  in  an  enabling  policy  and \ninstitutional environment, which hinges on five key reforms: (i) increased freedom \non farming decisions (reduced state procurement quota), (ii) fair and improved \npricing  of  state-procured  commodities,  (iii)  timely  payments  to  farmers,  (iv) \nliberalized markets, and (v) secure access to land. The intended aims of these \nreforms are clarified in the Assurances section, and the specific measures are \nincorporated in the Project and the associated technical assistance (TA) to help \nthe  Government  implement  the  reforms.  In  addition,  the  capacity  of  the \ninstitutions responsible for the reforms and the farmers, the ultimate beneficiaries \nand caretakers of land and water resources, will be developed.  \n \nThe Project comprises (i) land and agricultural improvements that will promote \nthe  dissemination  of  appropriately  designed  land  reclamation  and  agronomic \npractices, as well as modern farm business management; (ii) capacity building for \n ", "  v\n  land and water management institutions, which will strengthen the ability at the \ncentral, provincial, and community levels to introduce integrated land and water \nresources management, upgrade operation and maintenance (O&M) practices, \nsupport  water  users\u2019  associations  (WUA),  and  involve  beneficiary  farmers  in \nplanning and construction supervision of on-farm works; (iii) rehabilitation of land \nmanagement infrastructure of main and on-farm systems to ensure efficient land \nand water management, and equitable delivery of irrigation water to individual \nprivate farms; and (iv) project management that will establish project offices, as \nwell  as  units  for  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  social  and  environmental \nperformance. A GEF grant ($3.0 million) is proposed to promote innovative land \nmanagement, enhance the replicability of the Project, and generate additional \nglobal environmental benefits. If GEF financing is not confirmed, only the project \nactivities  financed  by  the  two  ADB  loans,  as  described  above,  will  be \nimplemented. \n   \nProject  The Project is estimated to cost $76.18 million, including taxes and duties of \nInvestment Plan   $11.59 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  ADB will provide a blend of two loans to finance the Project: (i) a loan for $32.6 \nmillion  from  the  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR),  and  (ii)  a  loan  in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR 18,515,000 ($27.6 million) from the Special Funds \n(SF) resources. The OCR loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period \nof  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of \n0.75% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the OCR loan \nagreement. A portion of the OCR loan not exceeding $16.7 million will be used to \nfinance on-farm I&D rehabilitation works, and the costs will be recovered fully \nfrom the beneficiary farmers through WUAs. The loan from the SF resources will \nhave a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of \n1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter, and other \nterms and conditions set forth in the SF loan agreement. \n   \nPeriod of  Until 31 March 2013 \nUtilization \n   \nEstimated  30 September 2012 \nProject   \nCompletion Date   \n \nExecuting  Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (MAWR) \nAgency \n   \nImplementation  The Project will be implemented over 6 years, starting in October 2006. A high-\nArrangements  level project steering committee, with a deputy prime minister as chairman, will \nprovide policy guidance. The deputy minister of water resources in MAWR will be \ndesignated  as  project  director  with  overall  responsibility  for  project \nimplementation. A project management office (PMO) will be established within \nMAWR to manage project activities, and to liaise with ADB and the coordinating \nbodies. Project implementation units (PIU) will be established in each of the three \nproject provinces to implement the Project. \n ", "vi   \n  A full-time project manager will administer and manage the PMO, while a project \nsite manager will oversee each PIU. The Government will nominate the project \nmanager, who will be endorsed by ADB. A panel of experts appointed by the \nGovernment will select the project site managers and key staff based on merit.  \n   \nProcurement  The Project will procure machinery, equipment, civil works, services, vehicles, \noffice  equipment,  and  materials.  All  procurement  will  be  undertaken  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines.  \n   \nConsulting  The Project will provide 131 person-months of international consulting services \nServices  and 857 person-months of domestic consulting services in (i) institutional capacity \nbuilding;  (ii) land  and  water  management  methodologies;  (iii)  design, \nprocurement,  and  construction  supervision;  and  (iv)  project  management, \nmonitoring, and evaluation. The consultants will be engaged in accordance with \nthe Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and its \nBorrowers, using the quality- and cost-based selection method. \n   \nProject Benefits  The  main  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  are  expected  to  result  from  (i) \nand Beneficiaries  avoidance of production losses due to reduced land degradation and improved \nmanagement; (ii) increased cotton and wheat yields and production, resulting \nfrom policy, institutional, and technical interventions; and (iii) higher and more \nsustainable  farmer  incomes  from  production  incentives  and  productivity \nenhancements. The economic internal rate of return of the project investments is \nestimated at 21.5% with a net present value of $26.78 million, indicating positive \nreturns to the economy. An overall annual increase of 31,200 tons of cotton and \n13,800 tons of wheat is projected in the project areas. In response to local market \ndemand,  a  small  expansion  in  fodder  crops,  vegetables,  and  fruit  also  is \nexpected, and will increase slightly the cropping intensity on private farms. In \naddition,  project  interventions  will  halt  further  land  degradation  in  the  area, \nestimated at 13,000 ha over the next 15 years.  \n   \n  After project implementation, household incomes in the project area will rise by \n15% in Kashkadarya, 23% in Navoi, and 30% in Bukhara. In-kind consumption \ngrowth  will  average  10\u201315%  in  the  project  area.  At  project  completion, \nproductivity growth and higher income and consumption of poor households will \nreduce poverty incidence (i) from 37.3% to 35% in Kashkadarya Province, (ii) \nfrom 28.3% to 24.2% in Navoi Province, and (iii) from 27.3% to 22.5% in Bukhara \nProvince. Further, an analysis of the policy reforms associated with the Project, \nusing a policy analysis matrix approach, indicates a positive impact on exports \nand Government revenues. \n   \n ", "  vii\nRisks and  The Project aims to achieve enduring behavior changes\u2014in addressing land \nAssumptions  degradation and implementing agriculture sector reforms\u2014at all levels, including \nin national and local governments, and among beneficiaries. To achieve and \nsustain such changes, the Government\u2019s strong commitment and political will are \nessential. The Government has demonstrated its commitment to implementing \nagriculture sector reforms slowly, but consistently. Despite some initial delays, the \nGovernment has raised production incentives gradually through (i) accelerated \nfarm privatization, (ii) decreased net transfers from agriculture, (iii) reduced state \nprocurement quotas, (iv) higher procurement prices, and (v) gradual liberalization \nof  the  cotton  trade.  It  also  has  developed  a  new  simplified  tax  code  for \nagriculture. Therefore, the risk that the Government might turn away from its \ncommitment to reforming the agriculture sector and addressing land degradation \nin a comprehensive manner is considered low. \n \n  ADB and World Bank continue to collaborate closely in monitoring and assessing \nthe progress of reforms. Alongside the Project, the associated TA will help the \nGovernment and stakeholders to assess the progress, outcomes and impacts of \nthe  reforms.  This  will  promote  awareness  and  understanding  among \nstakeholders, thereby building alliances that will support and advocate enduring \nbehavior changes.  \n \nInstitutions with adequate capacity and legal authorities also must support the \nintended  behavior  changes.  In  particular,  the  institutions  responsible  for \nsustainable  land  management  must  be  provided  with  clear  mandates  and \nenhanced capacity. The Project recognizes the risk of falling short in delivering \nthe  intended  results  due  to  institutional  weaknesses.  Accordingly,  it  aims  to \ndevelop  institutions  based  on  several  ongoing  ADB-assisted  institutional \nstrengthening activities, notably for water sector institutions, WUAs, and land \nmanagement institutions. The proposed Project and associated TA will build on \nthe progress from these activities, while the proposed GEF grant will support \nnational level planning and institutional strengthening.   \n \n  One potential risk involves the inadequate maintenance of the rehabilitated I&D \nschemes due to the lack of financial resources and/or technical skills. The Project \naddresses this risk in two ways. First, it will select, through systematic screening \nand consultation with stakeholders, schemes with low O&M costs. Second, the \nProject will help develop participatory design, implementation, and O&M of the \nselected schemes through WUAs, utilizing the extensive experience of the ADB-\nfinanced Ak Altin Agricultural Development Project in WUA development and \ntraining, in close collaboration with other funding agencies. The reform agenda \nthat  will  be  implemented  under  the  Project  also  will  support  institutional \nstrengthening of MAWR and WUAs, and raise farmers\u2019 incomes to enable them \nto invest in sustainable water management and improved O&M. \n \n  As for project implementation risks, the proposed Executing Agency has been \nimplementing  three  ADB  projects,  and  has  demonstrated  adequate \nimplementation  capacity.  The  scope  and  nature  of  physical  works  under  the \nProject are also generally simple. Thus, the risk of the Project encountering \nimplementation delays and difficulties is considered low. \n \n ", "viii   \nTechnical  A TA entitled Implementation and Monitoring of Policy Reforms in the Agriculture \nAssistance  Sector will be provided to assist the Government at central and provincial levels in \n  (i)  formulating,  prioritizing,  and  implementing  the  agreed  reforms;  (ii) \nstrengthening the relevant institutions; (iii) preparing legislation to reverse the \nconstraints  on  agricultural  productivity  and  rural  incomes;  (iv)  monitoring  the \nimplementation of reforms and their impact on farm incomes, rural poverty, and \nGovernment revenues; and (v) planning the expansion of sector reforms.  \n \n  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000 equivalent, of which $800,000 will be \nfinanced by ADB\u2019s TA funding program ($200,000) and the Poverty Reduction \nCooperation  Fund  administered  by  ADB  ($600,000)  on  a  grant  basis.  The \nGovernment will finance the remaining $200,000 by providing offices, logistical \nsupport, and counterpart staff. The Ministry of Economy will be the TA Executing \nAgency. The TA will be implemented over 24 months, starting in October 2006. \nThe TA will provide 14 person-months of international consulting services and 36 \nperson-months of domestic consulting services. ADB will engage the consultants \nthrough  a  qualified  firm  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants by Asian Development Bank and its Borrowers. \n \n ",

THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Land Improvement Project. The report also describes the \nproposed technical assistance (TA) for implementation and monitoring of policy reforms in the \nagriculture sector. If the Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approves the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by Board, will approve the TA.1  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n2.  At the request of the Government of Uzbekistan, ADB approved a TA to prepare the \nLand  Improvement  Project.  The  TA  was  carried  out  from  January  to  August  2005.  This \ndocument is based on the consultants\u2019 studies, surveys, and reports; the findings of ADB \nmissions; and discussions with government agencies, stakeholders, and beneficiaries. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  Uzbekistan is a low-income country with gross national income per person of $420 in \n2003. The Government estimates that Uzbekistan's gross domestic product (GDP) grew 4.2% in \n \n2002, 4.4% in 2003, and 7.7% in 2004. During 2000\u20132004, agriculture accounted for about 29% \nof GDP, 25% of export earnings, and 33% of the national employment. About 15 million people, \nor 60% of the population of 25.6 million, live in rural areas and depend solely on agriculture for \ntheir livelihoods. Cotton, which dominated the country\u2019s agriculture sector during the Soviet era, \ncontinues to do so, though to a lesser extent. The country is the world\u2019s sixth largest producer of \ncotton, which remains a major source of export and tax revenues. Since independence, the \nGovernment has promoted wheat production, and wheat self-sufficiency was achieved in 1997.  \n \n4.  The agriculture sector continues to be an important source of income for the economy. \nGovernment policy consistently has aimed to (i) maximize agriculture exports; (ii) achieve food \nsecurity and self-sufficiency in wheat; and (iii) redistribute revenues from agriculture to other \nsectors, such as health, industry, and infrastructure. The transfers from the agriculture sector \nare made possible by a policy framework that gives the Government control over the production \nand marketing of cotton and wheat through planning, foreign exchange and trade controls, and \ndirected credits.2 State procurement contracts (quotas) are set, subsidized credit and inputs are \nprovided to finance cotton and wheat production, and farmers are required to sell 50% of their \noutput  to  the  Government  at  fixed  prices  below  international  prices.  Since  2002,  the \nGovernment has undertaken sector reforms (paras. 10\u201311) with the support of international \ndevelopment partners, including ADB (paras. 15\u201317). \n \n5.  Irrigation is vital to agriculture in Uzbekistan, which has an arid climate. The expansion \nof irrigated areas started in the 1950s, when huge schemes were constructed to irrigate semi-\ndesert areas. Many people from densely populated parts of the country were mobilized to \nsupport the development of these schemes, as well as agro-processing industries. An excessive \namount of water was taken from the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers for this large-scale \nirrigation program, with little attention to efficient use of the water. This contributed to soil \nsalinization, land degradation, and the Aral Sea environmental disaster. Since independence, \nfarm restructuring and the emergence of private farms have presented new challenges to \n                                                 \n1  The project design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Uzbekistan for Agriculture Sector Review Planning Project. \nManila. The TA reviewed the performance of the sector, taxation, transfers, and subsidies. The World Bank\u2019s \nsector work (para. 17) estimated the net transfers from the cotton subsector at 1.4% of GDP in 2004.   \n ", "2   \nirrigated agriculture. These have included the need for institutions, operation and maintenance \n(O&M)  procedures,  and  water  control  and  distribution  structures  to  provide  adequate  and \nefficient water supplies to thousands of small private farms.  \n \n6.  The  farming  community  is  organized  into  three  main  producer  types:  (i)  shirkats \n(cooperative farms), (ii) private farms, and (iii) dekhan farms.3 Under the large Soviet state \nfarms,  workers  received  a  fixed  wage.  With  the  collapse  of  the  former  Soviet  Union,  the \nGovernment started transforming these farms into enterprises that could manage their land \nbetter. During the 1990s, 1,100 state farms and 940 collective farms4 were reorganized into \nsmaller cooperative farms (shirkats), where workers hold a share of the farm assets. Shirkats \nhave performed poorly, with many incurring substantial financial losses. In 1997, private farms \nreceived independent jurisdictional status. As farm privatization accelerated, 125,000 private \nfarms cultivating 2.9 million hectares (ha) were established in 2004. Under the Government's \nreform program, farm privatization is scheduled for completion by 2007. The number of dekhan \nfarms also has increased from 2.3 million in 1991 to 4.3 million in 2004. Dekhan farms produce \n17% of the country\u2019s grains and most of it fruits and vegetables, while providing cash income for \nthe rural population. Land use rights of dekhan farms are clearly established (e.g., long-term \nlease and free cropping patterns). However, the land use rights of private farms are linked to the \nfulfillment of state procurement quotas for cotton and wheat, and often do not reflect the land \nquality  and  farm  infrastructure.  Land  use  contracts  are  rarely  registered,  allowing  local \nauthorities to evict farmers if they do not fulfill state quotas. These factors limit land use security \nand investment in land improvement, and are disincentive for farmers and rural business.  \n \n7.  Overall,  the  performance  of  the  agriculture  sector  has  fallen  short  of  its  potential. \nAgriculture output dropped 16% from 1990 to 1996, though it has grown modestly since and has \nrebounded to 1990 levels.5 The poor productivity in the sector is reflected in low irrigation \nefficiency, extensive land degradation, and low yields. The average withdrawal of irrigation \nwater per hectare is 14,000 cubic meter (m3), compared with 9,000\u201310,000 m3/ha in countries \nwith similar climate.6 The heavy water usage has not translated into high yields, as the average \nyields\u20142.25 tons (t)/ha for cotton and 4.2 t/ha for wheat\u2014are low. More than 60% of water \ndiverted for irrigation fails to reach the fields, overloading the drainage network with water \nlosses. The Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (MAWR) estimates that about 20,000 \nha of irrigable land are abandoned each year due to the progressive failure of the drainage \nsystems, rise in soil salinity, and land degradation, as well as declining crop yields.  \n \n8.  Agriculture sector policies, such as mandatory production targets and state control of the \nproduction system, are also among the underlying causes for deteriorating land and water \nresources.  As  farmers  are  forced  to  adhere  to  short-term  production  targets,  inadequate \nattention  is  paid  to  farm-level  investments  for  increasing  longer-term  productivity.  Land \ndegradation causes an estimated $31 million in annual crop production losses in Uzbekistan.7 \nMoreover,  salinization  and  land  degradation  have  been  recognized  as  key  environmental \nproblems.  The  most  adverse  impact  of  land  degradation  is  being  experienced  in  Navoi, \nBukhara, and Kashkadarya provinces, and in the Fergana Valley.  \n \n                                                 \n3  Dekhan farms are small inheritable households plots (0.15\u20130.35 ha) free in crop selection and marketing. \n4  State farms (sovkhoz) are state-operated agricultural estates specialized for large-scale production. Collective \nfarms (kolkhoz) are large cooperative agricultural enterprises operated on state-owned land. \n5  World Bank. 2003. Country Economic Memorandum. Washington, DC. \n6  World Bank. 2000. Republic of Uzbekistan Irrigation and Drainage Sector Study. Washington, DC. \n7  The Central Asia Scientific-Research Institute for Irrigation estimates that cotton yields decline 20\u201330% on slightly \nsalinized land, 40\u201360% on moderately salinized land, and up to 80% on severely salinized land. \n ", "  3\n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n9.  Key Constraints. Sector8 and farm problems are reflected in (i) low productivity and \nreturns from cotton and wheat production, (ii) limited crop diversification, and (iii) continuing \ndeterioration of land and water. At the same time, mandatory production targets for cotton and \nwheat, the involvement of local governments in private farming production and financing, and \nbelow-market procurement prices are major disincentives for private farmers to increase yields, \ndiversify cropping patterns, and improve farm management. This also highlights the need for \nlocal governments to transform from enforcers of the state-dominated procurement system to \nfacilitators of a new market-based agriculture system, in line with the Government\u2019s agriculture \nsector strategy. Thus, technical solutions for land improvement will be ineffective unless critical \nissues of agriculture policy and local governance are addressed. \n \n10.  Government Strategy. The Government has taken a gradual approach to the transition \nto a market economy, relying on state intervention and state planning. Although this approach \nhas  succeeded  in  avoiding  the  economic  collapse  that  has  befallen  other  former  Soviet \nrepublics, it has created economic distortions. Recognizing these distortions, the Government \nhas  undertaken  significant  macroeconomic  and  sector  reforms  since  2001.  At  the \nmacroeconomic level, the exchange rate was devalued in 2003. At the microeconomic level, \nstate procurement quotas for cotton and wheat have decreased from 70% to 50% of the total \nproduction since 2002. A further reduction of quotas from 50% to 25% is applied to ADB- and \nWorld Bank-financed projects. Procurement prices are being increased gradually. The cotton \nprocurement  price  was  increased  from  $50/t  in  2000  to  $224/t  in  2005,9 while  wheat \nprocurement  prices  have  been  aligned  with  the  prices  in  Central  Asia.  In  March  2003, \nPresidential Decree No. 3226 established a framework for the development of private farming, \nand reduction of the Government\u2019s control over agriculture, promotion of market principles in \ninput  supply  and  output  marketing.  Since  2005,  farmers  have  been  allowed  to  sell  cotton \nexceeding the state quota to foreign traders, or to the Government at a 20% premium to the \nprocurement price. The Uzbekistan Commodity Exchange was established in 2004, providing \nan alternative marketing outlet. \n \n11.  A new simplified tax code for agriculture is being developed, and an improved land \ntaxation mechanism is being pilot tested.10 Combined with the currency devaluation, these \nmeasures reduced implicit cotton taxation from 66% in 2000 to 31% in 2004.11 The centralized \nginning  system  has  been  restructured,  while  flour  mills,  grain  warehouses,  and  fertilizer \ndistribution centers are being privatized. Still, private investment and ownership have been slow \nto take root. The Government also has started replacing subsidized state credit with commercial \nbank lending. However, the farmers\u2019 lack of collateral, because their land leasehold rights are \nambiguous and are rarely accepted by banks for loan guarantees, has hampered this process.  \n \n12.  Despite these policy improvements, implementation of some reform measures at the \nlocal level is slow. State institutions continue to be present throughout the sector's value chain. \nMoreover,  local  governments  still  control  farm  production,  provision  of  inputs  and  credit, \nmarketing of outputs, and monitoring of quota targets. Continued subsidies of farm inputs and \ncredit lead to inefficiencies and the diversion of inputs into the black market. However, the policy \ndialogue with the Government is yielding results. The Government accepts the need to deepen \nreforms and improve incentives, though close monitoring of policy implementation at the local \n                                                 \n8  Summary agriculture and water sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n9  Since 2002, prices are adjusted annually, using formulae established by the Government, ADB, World Bank, and \nInternational Monetary Fund. These are outlined in Presidential Decree No. 3114 of 20 August 2002. \n10  In Tashkent, Samarkand, and Surkhandarya provinces, the tax rate declined from 23% in 1999 to 14.6% in 2003. \n11  World Bank. 2005. Cotton Taxation in Uzbekistan: Opportunities for Reform. Washington, DC. \n ", "4   \nlevel is needed to ensure that incentives to improve land and water management are in place. \nThese issues will be addressed under the agreed reform agenda, and monitored through the \ngrant-financed TA (para. 43). \n \n13.  The Government\u2019s funding of O&M for irrigation and drainage (I&D) infrastructure has \nfallen dramatically since independence, accelerating the deterioration of the system.12 Pumping \nof water for irrigation consumes about 20% of electricity generated in Uzbekistan and 70% of \nthe Government budget for the sector. As a result, little money is left for I&D rehabilitation and \nmodernization. Due to the lack of incentives to conserve water and improve land management \npractices, overuse of water\u2014with the consequent water logging and soil salinity\u2014affects more \nthan  47%  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s  irrigated  area.13 Overuse  of  chemicals  exacerbates  poor  soil \nconditions.  Rehabilitation  of  I&D  infrastructure  and  better  water  management  are  needed \nurgently to arrest the expanding land degradation and conserve water.  \n \n14.  To  address  water  management  constraints,  the  Government  is  moving  towards  a \ndecentralized  administration  of  water  resources.  Basin  irrigation  system  authorities  (BISA), \nbased on hydrological boundaries, have been established to rationalize water allocation. In \naddition, water users associations (WUA) are being established rapidly, and responsibility for \non-farm O&M is being transferred to these groups. A commitment has been made to introduce \nwater user charges to ensure funding of O&M of I&D systems.14 Water delivery fees are being \ninstituted on a trial basis, and bulk water charges are to be implemented in 2006. However, \nsince BISAs and WUAs do not have adequate expertise and resources to deliver the services \nneeded, further capacity building is required.  \n \n15.  External  Assistance.15 ADB, a major supporter of sector development, is financing \nthree ongoing projects designed to address low farm productivity, low farm incomes, and poor \nsector growth. The Ak Altin Agricultural Development Project16 is aimed at strengthening rural \ninstitutions to support private farming (e.g., rural business advisory centers and WUAs), and \nrehabilitating irrigation infrastructure. The Grain Productivity Improvement Project17 supports \ncapacity building of institutions in wheat breeding and research, adoption of new varieties, \nprivate sector development in input supply, improved farming practices, and environmentally \nsafe pest control. The Amu Zang Irrigation Rehabilitation Project18 finances the rehabilitation of \na pumping cascade, irrigation infrastructure, improved irrigation management, and development \nof private farms. These projects also support the implementation of sector policy reforms by pilot \ntesting and replicating reduced procurement quotas for cotton and wheat.  \n \n16.  The Agriculture Sector Review and Planning TA19 helped the Government assess the \ntaxes imposed on the cotton subsector, and identify key strategic directions for sustainable \nagricultural development. Another TA20 focused on an integrated cadastre system for land \n                                                 \n12 In 2004, only 3.4% of the country\u2019s annual investments were in agriculture.  \n13 ADB. 2003.

ADB also financed the preparation of \nthe Central Asian Countries Initiative for Land Management (CACILM),22 which supports the \ndevelopment  and  implementation  of  national  programming  frameworks  (NPF)  for \ncomprehensive and integrated approaches to sustainable land management to combat land \ndegradation. The Uzbekistan National Working Group established under CACILM prepared the \nNPF, which outlines the Program for Sustainable Land Management, and includes activities \nfinanced by this Project and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) (para. 27). \n  \n17.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  assistance  combines  physical  investments,  policy  reforms,  and \ninstitutional development. The Cotton Sub-sector Improvement Project23 pilot tested reforms in \nthe cotton subsector (e.g., lowering procurement quotas and establishing alternative marketing \nchannels); the Rural Enterprise Support Project24 aims to improve farm productivity; and the \nDrainage, Irrigation and Wetland Improvement Project25 supports a reduction of drainage flows \ninto the Amu Darya River. The World Bank carried out recent sector study26 that complements \nADB's  sector  work.  This  study  argues  that  cotton  production  is  over-taxed,  creating \ndisincentives  for  farmers.  Further,  the  World  Bank  study  suggested  (i)  abolishing  the \ncompulsory quotas patterns, (ii) eliminating the ginning monopoly; and (iii) liberalizing cotton \nmarketing.  The  European  Union  (EU)  supports  integrated  water  management,  and  is  pilot \ntesting land registration. United States Agency for International Development (USAID) provides \nassistance  in  water  management  and  farmers\u2019  business  training.  Food  and  Agriculture \nOrganization (FAO) is supporting the introduction of salt-tolerant crops and minimum tillage.  \n \n18.  Lessons. Implementation of the ADB-financed Ak Altin Project has confirmed farmers\u2019 \npositive response to quota reduction. The cotton yield within the project area grew by 29% \nbetween  2004  and  2005,  exceeding  the  growth  rate  of  20%  in  adjacent  areas.  Likewise, \nincomes of farmers within the project area were 15% higher than those in neighboring areas. \nThese  results  can  be  attributed  to  the  enhanced  incentives  available,  as  the  project\u2019s \ninfrastructure is not yet rehabilitated. However, farmers still wait up to 6 months for full payment \nfor their cotton,27 and they are not yet selling their above quota cotton to other buyers. While \nthese initial difficulties point to the need to include the local authorities in the reform process, the \npositive outcomes in the Ak Altin area already are changing the mindset of the Government. \n \n19.  Land degradation control often has emphasized top-down engineering solutions. This \napproach typically has not involved participation of stakeholders, or attacked the root causes of \nthe problem. The experience of ADB and other development agencies throughout the region \nindicates that sustainable land management must (i) apply customized techniques that meet the \nspecific needs and capacities of the affected population in a flexible way; (ii) provide adequate \nprice incentives, free of government intervention, to achieve higher farm incomes and ensure \nsustainable land and water management; and (iii) create an institutional environment\u2014in the \nform of land and water management, and land tenure arrangements\u2014that reinforce incentives \nfor sustainable land management based on market principles. The most crucial lesson is to \nensure the creation of an enabling policy environment that supports enduring changes in the \nbehavior of stakeholders responsible for land degradation. This requirement is strongly tied to \n                                                 \n21 ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance for Combating Desertification in Asia.

The  World Bank\u2019s  experience28 suggests  that  (i) proper  sequencing is  important  for \nsuccessful  reform  (e.g.,  withdrawal  of  subsidies  should  be  synchronized  with  enhanced \nincentives); (ii) delaying investments until the policies are right can reduce the ability to help the \npoor and can increase the costs; (iii) investments in a limited geographic area, combined with \nfocused policy reforms, are most likely to be successful; and (iv) Government decision making \nmight take longer than expected, given the complex institutional relationships. Further, the \nWorld Bank experience demonstrates that adequate TA grants are needed to support project \nimplementation. Initial delays in implementing reforms on the ongoing ADB and World Bank \nprojects also suggest that sufficient resources need to be allocated for capacity building of local \ninstitutions, monitoring of the implementation of reforms, and raising public awareness.   \n \n21.  These lessons have been incorporated in the project design: (i) analysis of the impact of \nthe policy initiatives on yields, incomes, and revenues has been prepared and discussed with \nthe Government as part of extensive police dialogue; (ii) a geographically focused project has \nbeen designed, coupling priority policy reforms with physical interventions to achieve tangible \noutcomes; (iii) support to strengthen the capacity of institutions at the provincial and district \nlevels,  as  well  as  of  private  farmers  and  WUAs,  has  been  incorporated;  and  (iv)  project \nperformance will be closely monitored and supervised based on clear indicators. To adequately \nfund these activities, TA- and GEF-financed grants (through CACILM) have been provided.   \n \n22.  Rationale.  Agriculture  remains  the  main  source  of  livelihood  for  rural  communities, \nwhich make up 60% of the population, and is critical to the inclusive and sustainable growth of \nthe Uzbekistan economy. Rapidly worsening land degradation is threatening the performance of \nthe agriculture sector and the livelihoods of a large proportion of the rural population. Given the \nimportance of the sector, the Government aims to increase farm productivity. However, unless \nthe depletion of the production base is reversed and land and water management are improved, \nthis goal will not be achieved. The design of the proposed Project, which focuses on the areas \nthat experience the most severe land degradation in Uzbekistan, fully reflects the experience \nand  lessons  gained  from  ADB\u2019s  past  and  ongoing  operations.  Such  lessons  suggest  that \nenabling  policies  that  promote  and  encourage  farmers\u2019  incentives  are  needed  to  support \nsustainable land management. In Uzbekistan, these policies include (i) increased freedom on \nfarming decisions (i.e., reduced state procurement quota), (ii) fair and improved pricing of state-\nprocured commodities, (iii) timely payments to farmers, (iv) liberalized markets, and (v) secure \naccess to land. Reforms to production, pricing, and marketing have been undertaken since 2002 \nunder ongoing agriculture sector reforms supported by ADB and World Bank. The proposed \nProject will build on, expand, and deepen these reforms\u2014particularly by incorporating a new \ninitiative for improving access to land\u2014as clarified in the assurances (para. 62). Moreover, the \nProject will take specific actions to achieve good governance in agricultural production and land \nmanagement. Other experiences also indicate that institutions responsible for land management \nmust have the ability to design and implement custom solutions to land degradation. The Project \nincorporates these lessons through a strong policy agenda for improved land tenure (para. 25), \nas well as institutional strengthening to improve rural governance. Based on these lessons, the \nProject will bring in the necessary investments to rehabilitate seriously deteriorated land and \nwater  management  infrastructure  cost-effectively  taking  into  account  the  need  for  future \nsustained O&M. The Project also aims to develop long-term planning and interventions to \n                                                 \n28  World Bank. 2002.

ADB\u2019s Strategy. ADB\u2019s country strategy (2006\u20132010) in Uzbekistan29 recognizes that \nthe key constraints to agricultural productivity include the state procurement system, and heavy \nintervention in inputs supply and marketing. It also recognizes the need to strengthen property \nrights, market, land, and water management institutions; and to maintain the physical state of \nland and water infrastructure. By focusing on rural development, ADB can help Uzbekistan \nenhance  rural  governance,  employment  and  income  opportunities,  and  environmental \nsustainability, thereby contributing to a reduction in rural poverty. The country strategy and \nprogram\u2019s  four  strategic  priorities  are  (i)  accelerating  environmentally  sustainable  rural \ndevelopment through improved land and water management, agricultural productivity, and land \nadministration reform; (ii) supporting the private sector; (iii) promoting regional cooperation; and \n(iv)  building  human  capital.  Within  each  of  these  areas,  a  core  set  of  governance  and \ninstitutional outcomes are to be pursued. The Project is closely aligned with this strategy, as it \nfocuses on key land, water management, and environmental issues; as well as reforms to raise \nproduction incentives and improve rural governance. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome  \n \n24.  The project area covers 162,300 ha in nine districts: Kamashi, Guzar, and Kasan in \nKashkadarya; Kyzyltepa, Khatirchi, and Navbakhor in Navoi; and Jandor, Bukhara, and Romitan \nin  Bukhara.  The  districts  were  selected  through  systematic  screening  and  stakeholder \nconsultation, based on the following criteria: (i) availability of irrigation water; (ii) high risk of land \ndegradation  without  interventions;  (iii)  high  potential  for  restoring  land  capability;  (iv)  low \ninvestment and O&M costs; (v) large number of poor households; and (vi) existence of relevant \nrural organizations. The expected impact of the Project is increased income of farmers in the \nproject area. The project outcome would be improved quality and sustainable productivity of \nland, leading to higher crop yields and enhanced ecological sustainability in the project areas. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n25.  To ensure this outcome, the loan and accompanying TA grant are designed to produce \npolicy, technical, and institutional changes. The outputs are (i) an enabling policy environment \nthat supports incentives for sustainable land management (para. 22), (ii) improved land and \nwater management practices, (iii) strengthened capacity of water management institutions, (iv) \nrehabilitated  land  and  water  infrastructure,  and  (v)  operational  and  effective  project \nmanagement  and  monitoring  systems.  While  the  TA  focuses  on  the  implementation  and \nmonitoring of policy reforms, the Project will carry out the following: \n \n(i)  Reform  initiatives  will  be  implemented  in  the  project  district,  introducing  (a) \nincreased freedom on farm decisions: state procurement quota for cotton and \nwheat in the project districts will be reduced to 25% of the long-term average \nproduction, and greater freedom on cropping patterns will be allowed; (b) price \nreform: the procurement prices for raw cotton and wheat will reflect changes in \ninternational prices, inflation, and market-based exchange rates, and farmers will \nbe entitled to sell production exceeding their quota at their discretion; (c) payment \nreform: farmers will receive final payment for raw cotton after crop delivery; (d) \n                                                 \n29 ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program 2006\u20132010. Manila \n ", "8   \nmarket liberalization: farmers will be allowed to sell above-quota cotton and other \nnon-quota  produce  freely;  and  (e)  land  access  reform:  the  land  use  lease \ncontracts between the Government and the farmers will be improved to ensure \nprotection from cancellations without legal process, and will be eligible for use as \ncollateral to access loans from commercial banks. \n(ii)   Land and agricultural improvements will introduce improved land reclamation \npractices  and  on-farm  water  management.  The  Project  will  establish  three \ndemonstration farms to promote innovative on-farm technologies (e.g., leveling, \nsubsoiling, etc.), and to demonstrate enhanced agronomic practices (e.g., crop \nrotations and minimum tillage to reduce inputs and increase soil fertility, and \nintegrated  pest  management).  Local  scientific  institutions  with  relevant \nexperience  will  be  involved  to  ensure  the  ownership,  replication,  and \nsustainability of these operations.30 The loan consultants will supplement the \ncapacity  of  the  scientific  institutions.  These  improvement  practices,  initially \nimplemented  through  the  scientific  institutions,  will  be  scaled-up  with  the \nincreased involvement of the private sector, and financed through the GEF grant.  \n(iii)   Capacity of land and water management institutions, particularly BISAs, MAWR, \nand  WUAs,  will  be  strengthened  through  (a)  development  of  efficient  O&M \nprocedures  and  market-based  irrigation  delivery  fees,  (b)  adoption  of  an \nintegrated water management, and (c) financial and management training.  \n(iv)   Land management infrastructure will be rehabilitated, including rehabilitation of \non-farm  canals  and  drains  for  improved  land  and  water  management,  and \nequitable delivery of irrigation water to individual private farms, including 15,175 \nha in Navoi, 21,460 ha in Bukhara, and 24,150 ha in Kashkadarya. The cost of \non-farm improvements will be recovered from the beneficiaries. In addition, the \nmain drainage collectors will be rehabilitated, including 330 kilometers (km) in \nNavoi, 640 km in Bukhara, and 500 km in Kashkadarya, covering an area of \n162,300  ha.  Rehabilitation  of  drainage  and  irrigation  structures  for  improved \nwater control and efficiency will be prioritized. \n(v)   Project  management  will  comprise  the  establishment  of  project  offices  and \nperformance monitoring and evaluation units, surveys, and water and soil quality \nmonitoring. A project management office (PMO) will be established at MAWR to \nmanage project activities. Three project implementation units (PIU) will be set up \nin Navoi, Bukhara, and Kashkadarya to implement the Project in their areas, and \nto maintain liaison with local and beneficiary organizations. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n26.  The Project represents a shift in ADB\u2019s sector assistance from irrigation rehabilitation to \na comprehensive improvement in land and water management, focusing on the worsening and \nexpanding  land  degradation.  To  do  this,  the  Project  expands  and  deepens  the  ongoing, \nprogrammatic approach to agriculture sector reforms implemented under the ADB-financed \nprojects in the sector. In addition, it will also establish a supportive policy and institutional \nframework for sustainable land management, including enhanced security of land tenure and \nfarmers\u2019 access to commercial credit. To help the Government implement these reforms, an \nassociated TA will provide expertise and resources to enhance local institutions\u2019 capacity, and \nto monitor the reform progress (para. 43). These reforms ensure increased freedom in farm \ndecisions (i.e., what to grow and where to sell), fair and timely payments of state-procured \ncommodities, and secured access to land use rights\u2014all according to the transparent and \n                                                 \n30 The Tashkent Institute of Irrigation and Melioration and the Cotton Research Institute have agreed to participate. \n ", "  9\n \npredictable rule of good local governance. The Project\u2019s contribution to achieving good local \ngovernance, particularly in restricting official and unofficial interventions of local authorities in \nfarm management decisions, reflects the CSP\u2019s recognition of governance risks associated with \nlocal governments. Further, it is in line with the recommendations of ADB\u2019s Country Assistance \nProgram Evaluation for Uzbekistan for strategic approach to governance issues.31 \n \n27.  A  grant  from  GEF  Operational  Program  15  on  Sustainable  Land  Management  is \nproposed to enhance the project impact at national and subregional levels. ADB submitted a \nrequest for grant financing ($3.0 million) to the GEF Council to finance additional activities to \nensure sustainable ecological productivity in the project area. If approved, ADB will administer \nthe GEF grant, according to GEF-ADB agreement, to promote modern land management, \nenhance project replicability, and generate additional global environmental benefits. The GEF-\nfinanced activities will (i) address regulatory conditions for improved land management; (ii) \nfoster coordination among line agencies to ensure an integrated, participatory approach to \nproject  activities;  (iii)  involve  all  stakeholders  in  planning,  implementing,  and  monitoring  of \nsustainable land management; (iv) pilot test innovative technical systems and public and private \npartnerships;  and  (v)  include  monitoring  and  evaluation  to  increase  the  replicability  of  the \nProject. The GEF Council will review the proposal in June 2006. If approved, GEF financing will \nbegin in 2007 and will be implemented over 4 years. If GEF does not approve financing, only \nthe project activities financed by the two ADB loans (para. 25) will be implemented. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n28.  The Project is estimated to cost $76.18 million, including $11.59 million for taxes and \nduties,  $8.60  million  for  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  $5.06  million  in  estimated \nfinancial charges during implementation.

The Government has requested a blend of two loans to finance the Project: (i) a loan of \n$32.6 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR), and (ii) a loan in various currencies \nequivalent to SDR 18,515,000 from the Special Funds (SF) resources.  \n \n30.  The OCR loan will finance a portion of the cost of the on-farm I&D rehabilitation works \nand other project activities, such as land and water management improvement, institutional \nstrengthening, and project management. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per year, and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement (ordinary operations). A portion \nof the OCR loan not exceeding $16.7 million will be used to finance on-farm I&D rehabilitation \nworks,  and  will  be  recovered  from  the  beneficiary  farmers  through  WUAs  (para.  34).  The \nGovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n \n31.  The  SF  loan  will  be  utilized  solely  to  finance  the  cost  of  the  main  and  inter-farm \nrehabilitation works. The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, \nan interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter, and \nother terms and conditions set forth in the loan agreement (special operations).The beneficiaries \nalso will contribute $0.39 million towards the cost of the demonstration farms. The Government \nwill finance the remainder of the project cost, estimated at $15.58 million, including $11.59 \nmillion for taxes and duties.

Project Management   \n \n32.  MAWR will be the project Executing Agency. A high-level project steering committee will \nbe established and meet quarterly to provide policy guidance. The deputy minister of water \nresources  in  MAWR  will  be  designated  as  project  director  with  responsibility  for  project \nimplementation. A PMO will be established within MAWR to manage project activities and liaise \nwith ADB. PIUs will be set up to handle project implementation in the three project provinces, \nand to liaise with local administrations and beneficiaries. A full-time manager will lead the PMO, \nwhile a site manager will oversee each PIU. The Government will nominate the PMO manager, \n ", "  11\n \nwho will be endorsed by ADB. A panel of experts appointed by the Government will select the \nkey staff based on merit. The management organization chart is in Appendix 8. The National \nWomen\u2019s Committee will be represented in the PMO to implement the Gender Action Plan \n(GAP) presented in Appendix 13. A financial management assessment was undertaken during \nproject preparation, indicating that the MAWR has satisfactory management capability and \nsystems for financial and accounting management, reporting, auditing, and internal controls. \nThe financial management assessment of MAWR is in Supplementary Appendix R.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n33.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years, starting in October 2006. Project activities \nduring the first year will focus on fielding consultants, procuring equipment, and establishing the \nPMO and PIUs. Surveys, investigations, and preparation of designs and bidding documents will \nstart within 6 months of project implementation. In parallel, participatory community consultation \nwith  stakeholders  will  determine  the  scope  of  on-farm  rehabilitation  and  agricultural \ninterventions. The results will be collated in the design processes. The project civil works will \nbegin 24 months after the start. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 6. \n \n3.  Cost Recovery \n \n34.  A portion of the OCR loan not exceeding $16.7 million will be used to finance on-farm \nI&D rehabilitation works, and will be recovered from the beneficiary farmers. Before beginning \non-farm civil works, the PMO, WUAs, and farmers jointly will review and agree on the scope and \ncosts of the rehabilitation works. Further, the WUAs and farmers will enter into agreements with \nthe PMO (on behalf of the Government), indicating their approval of the scope of works, cost \nestimates,  and  readiness  to  recover  the  costs.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  these \nagreements are prepared and executed in a form and substance satisfactory to ADB. The PMO \nwill maintain the records on the selection and approval of the agreements for ADB's review. \nADB  will  pay  the  civil  works  contractors  directly.  A  commercial  bank  designated  by  the \nBorrower, and acceptable to ADB, will collect payments through the WUAs and deposit them in \na special account.32 The average rehabilitation cost is estimated at $350/ha or $7,000/farm \nequivalent,  and  the  terms  of  repayment  will  be  decided  on  case-by-case  basis  during \nimplementation in consultation with farmers. In general, repayments will be made for up to 25 \nyears, including a grace period of 5 years, with the maximum interest of 8% per year, subject to \nchanges to be agreed upon during the midterm review of the Project.33 A financial analysis of a \ntypical size farm confirmed that farmers will have the capacity to repay. The proposed flow of \nfunds is in Supplementary Appendix T. \n \n4.  Procurement \n \n35.  Goods, related services, and civil works will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines. Major contracts for equipment costing $1,000,000 equivalent or more \nwill be awarded through ADB\u2019s international competitive bidding (ICB). Contracts estimated at \nless than $1,000,000 will be awarded using national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures \nacceptable to ADB. Shopping will be allowed for contracts valued at $100,000 equivalent or \nless. The Executing Agency will certify to ADB that the goods and services financed by the loan \nare procured from ADB member countries. For works contracts costing less than $50,000, ADB \nmight agree to force account procedures, provided that MAWR can implement these works at a \n                                                 \n32 For these services, an administrative fee of up to 1.5% per year will be paid to the designated bank. \n33 The maximum repayment period of 25 years is based on the economic life of the Project, while the 5-year grace \nperiod takes into account the duration of construction and the benefits\u2019 built-up period. \n ", "12   \nreasonable cost. ADB must approve in advance the awarding of all contracts and substantial \ncontract variations. The procurement plan is in Appendix 7.  \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n \n36.  The Project will provide 131 person-months of international consulting services and 857 \nperson-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  in  the  following  areas:  (i) land  and  water \nmanagement;  (ii) institutional  capacity  building;  (iii) design,  procurement,  and  construction \nsupervision; and (iv) project management, monitoring, and evaluation. At the start of the Project, \nMAWR and ADB will reassess the required inputs, based on the refined project schedule. The \nconsulting  services  will  be  provided  by  an  international  firm,  in  association  with  domestic \nconsultants or a domestic firm. MAWR will engage the consultants in accordance with the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers, using full \ntechnical proposals and quality- and cost-based selection. 34  \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n37.  The  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loans  will  be  disbursed  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook. For consulting services, civil works, and equipment following ICB \nprocedures, loan funds will be disbursed directly. For civil works following NCB procedures and \nsmall expenditures related to the PMO and PIUs, reimbursement and imprest fund procedures \nwill be applied. After loan effectiveness, the PMO will open imprest accounts for each loan in a \ncommercial bank in Uzbekistan acceptable to ADB. The combined initial deposit to the imprest \naccounts will not exceed the estimated expenditures for 6 months of project implementation, or \n10% of both loans, whichever is lower. ADB's statement of expenditures procedure may be \nused to reimburse advances made into the imprest account for eligible expenditures, with \nindividual payments amounting to $100,000 or less. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n38.  MAWR will maintain separate project accounts and financial statements, in accordance \nwith the provisions of the Loan Agreement, the recommendations of the financial management \nassessment  (FMA),  and  the Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of \nInvestment Projects Financed by ADB. Further, MAWR will have them audited annually by \nindependent auditors acceptable to ADB. MAWR will submit to ADB certified copies of the \nannual audited project accounts and financial statements, as well as the auditor\u2019s report, which \nwill include a separate opinion on the use of the imprest account and statement of expenditures, \nand management letter, all in English, within 6 months of the end of each fiscal year during \nproject implementation. MAWR was advised of ADB\u2019s requirement for timely submission of \naudited project accounts and financial statements, and the suspension of disbursements of the \nADB loan if it fails to comply with this requirement.  \n \n39.  MAWR, through the PMO, will submit quarterly and annual reports to ADB, indicating \nprogress  made,  problems  encountered,  steps  taken  to  remedy  the  problems,  program  of \nactivities, and expected progress during the remaining period. The reports will incorporate the \nproject performance monitoring data and relevant financial data. MAWR also will provide reports \nand information on the Project, such as ADB may reasonably request, including environmental \nimpacts, dialogue with beneficiaries, and related social issues. Within 3 months after project \n                                                 \n34 The outline terms of reference for consulting services are in Appendix 9.  \n ", "  13\n \ncompletion, MAWR will submit to ADB a project completion report with detailed information on \nproject implementation, use of the loan proceeds, and accomplishment of the project objectives.  \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n40.  To monitor the progress of physical works, the Project provides for a comprehensive \nsystem of M&E that will be established in accordance with ADB guidelines within 1 year of loan \neffectiveness. An M&E unit will be established in the PMO to monitor project performance, \nincluding environmental, poverty, gender, and social impacts, as specified in the Summary Initial \nEnvironmental Examination (SIEE) and the poverty, social, and gender assessment (PSGA). \nThe assessment will be based on the monitoring indicators in the project framework (Appendix \n1). Sample surveys, conducted at project completion, will be compared with baseline data. For \nperiodic monitoring, key indicators will be confirmed at project inception, with data incorporated \ninto the system focusing on outcomes, efficiency, profitability, and quality. The TA associated \nwith the Project will monitor the implementation of policy reforms, and assess their impacts.  \n \n9.  Project Review \n \n41.  The Government and ADB will review project implementation at least once a year. After \n3 years of implementation, the Government and ADB will carry out a midterm review of the \nProject to identify problems and assess the need to modify the project scope, as well as \nimplementation and financing arrangements. The parameters for assessing the implementation \nmilestones will include (i) implementation status, (ii) design and construction standards, (iii) \nphysical  progress  and  disbursements,  (iv)  status  of  compliance  with  loan  covenants,  (v) \nachievement of the Project\u2019s objectives, (vi) progress of policy reforms, and (vii) need for any \nchanges in the project scope to achieve project impact. On completion, the Project will be \nevaluated according to the terms of reference agreed upon by the Government and ADB.   \n \n10.  Anticorruption Measures \n \n42.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998)  was  explained  to,  and  discussed  with,  the \nGovernment  and  Executing  Agency.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. Combating \ncorruption is part of broader work on good governance and capacity building that forms and \nimportant element of the Project. It is intended to ensure enduring behavior changes of local \nauthorities, and enable transparent and equitable distribution of farm profits to support farmers\u2019 \nincentives for improved land management. Measures to improve local governance, empower \nfarmers  to  make  independent  farm  production  decisions,  and  combat  corruption  are \nincorporated in the project design. Supplemented by institutional capacity building, these policy \nreforms will be implemented in the project districts to increase farmer\u2019s independence, improve \nland tenure security, and limit the interference of local authorities in business decisions (paras. \n25\u201326). At the project level, the financial management capacity of the Executing Agency has \nbeen  assessed  as satisfactory  (para.  32).  A stand-alone  PMO  will  manage  the  Project  to \nmitigate the risks associated with weaknesses in government systems, and project accounts will \nbe audited externally each year (paras. 38 and 63). The project civil works have been packaged \n ", "14   \ninto large contracts to attract reputable contractors and will require ADB\u2019s approval before being \nawarded. Since direct involvement of the intended beneficiaries in procurement is recognized as \nan effective measure to combat corruption, the planning and construction supervision of the on-\nfarm I&D rehabilitation works (28% of the loan amount) will be carried out in close consultation \nwith the participating farmers and WUAs, and the beneficiaries will confirm their agreement with \nthe scope and cost of these works before contracts are awarded. The accompanying TA also \nprovides for close participatory monitoring of project implementation.  \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n43.  A TA grant will support the Government in implementing and monitoring the agreed \npolicy  reforms  (para.  62.),  TA  impacts  are  accelerated  agriculture  sector  reforms  and \ndissemination of reform knowledge that can be replicated within Uzbekistan. The TA outputs are \n(i) reduced quotas, register land use contracts, and liberalize agricultural markets in the project \ndistricts; (ii) an implementation plan for reforms; and (iii) monitoring of reform implementation, \nand proposals to expand reform initiatives. The TA will have three components: (i) design of the \nimplementation of reforms; (ii) support to institutions in implementing the agreed reforms; and \n(iii)  a  participatory  system  for  monitoring  the  implementation  and  impact  of  reforms  on \nGovernment revenues, farm profitability, and poverty reduction.35 The TA also will carry out \nextensive consultation campaigns to disseminate reform information.  \n \n44.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000 equivalent. ADB\u2019s TA funding program will \nprovide a grant for $200,000, while the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund administered by \nADB will finance $600,000. The Government will finance the remaining $200,000 by providing \noffices and logistical support. The TA will be implemented over 24 months, starting in October \n2006. The Ministry of Economy will be the TA Executing Agency. The TA will require 14 person-\nmonths  of  international  consulting  services  and  36  person-months  of  domestic  consulting \nservices. ADB will recruit the TA consultants in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. Simplified technical proposals and ADB's quality- and cost-based selection system \nwill be used. The detailed TA description and cost estimates are in Appendix 10. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Economic and Financial Impact \n \n45.  The main economic benefits are expected from (i) the avoidance of production losses \nthat would have occurred without the Project due to further land degradation; (ii) higher cotton \nand wheat yields resulting from the implementation of proposed technical, institutional, and \npolicy interventions; and (iii) increased and sustainable farmer incomes derived from incentive \nand productivity improvements. The economic analysis was based on an estimated 25-year \nproject life. The project economic internal rate of return, excluding the impact attributable to the \npolicy reforms, is estimated at 21.5% with a net present value of $26.78 million.  \n \n46.  Project interventions will mitigate the gradual loss of production due to land degradation. \nFor 60,785 ha, the full rehabilitation of I&D infrastructure, combined with improved land and \nwater  management,  would  increase  crop  yields  and  cropping  intensity.  Cotton  yields  are \nexpected to rise from 2.6 tons/ha to 3.4 tons/ha in Navoi, from 1.8 tons/ha to 2.8 tons/ha in \nBukhara, and from 2.2 tons/ha to 3.2 tons/ha in Kashkadarya. Another 64,850 ha will benefit \nfrom the rehabilitation of only off-farm infrastructure, with cotton yields increasing by 10% and \n                                                 \n35 Including collection and analysis of gender-disaggregated data. \n ", "  15\n \nwheat yields by 16%. For private farms, net farm incomes are expected to rise by $4,120 per \nyear. The Project also will increase the net value of production of dekhan farms\u2014from 23% in \nNavoi to 30% in Kashkadarya. A farm budget analysis illustrates that, with the higher crop \nproduction and a 25% quota reduction, farmers will be able to meet the full on-farm investment. \n \n47.  An  analysis  of  the  policy  reforms  under  the  Project  indicates  a  positive  impact  on \nfarmers and the Government. Without the Project and reforms, private profit is low ($94/ha), \nsuggesting a lack of incentives for productivity improvements. With the Project, private profits \nwould increase significantly ($435/ha) due to a 25% quota reduction and higher prices. If \ncombined with productivity improvements from better land management, profits would increase \neven further. Higher profits are expected to increase farmers\u2019 investments in land improvement, \nraising productivity and revenues further. By adopting the 25% quota reduction and allowing a \ngreater  proportion  of  the  land  to  be  planted  with  cotton\u2014the  crop  with  the  comparative \nadvantage\u2014cotton  production  is  expected  to  increase  15%  in  the  area  and  the  Project\u2019s \nefficiency in earning foreign exchange is expected to improve. Government revenues from the \nproject  areas  are  forecast  to  increase  by  20%  due  to  the  sale  and  export  of  additional \nproduction, increased tax collection, and savings from lower production subsidies. \n \nB.  Environmental Impact and Assessment \n \n48.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE),36 conducted  during  project  preparation, \nconfirms  that  the  Project  will  have  considerable  positive  environmental  impacts.  The \nrehabilitation of main drains will have a direct and positive impact on groundwater tables. In \naddition, the rehabilitation of on-farm I&D infrastructure for 33,890 ha will increase irrigation \nefficiency, decrease water losses, and reduce groundwater levels. These improvements will \nreduce waterlogging and soil salinity significantly, and improve soil quality. The Project will not \nincrease the use of river water. Instead, it will improve water use efficiency, thereby benefiting \ndownstream  users  by  increasing  stream  flows.  Better  agriculture  and  land  management \npractices also will improve stream flow quality. \n \n49.  The  project  area  does  not  include  any  national  parks,  or  environmental  or  cultural \nmonuments. The flora and fauna in the area, which has been cultivated for more than 25 years, \nhave been impacted by human activity. As no species are registered on the Species Survival \nCommission\u2019s Red List,37 none is recognized as endangered. The current flora and fauna \nappear to be adapted to the irrigated agricultural environment. Since the Project will not extend \nto new areas, negative impacts on flora and fauna are not expected. The only potential negative \nimpacts identified in the IEE are due to rehabilitation works, though these are considered \ninsignificant.  Mitigation  measures,  environmental  management,  and  monitoring  have  been \nintegrated into the project design and costs. These include (i) stockpiling of spoil from drains; (ii) \ndisposal of waste material from repairs; and (iii) provision of suitable locations for contractors\u2019 \ncamps, which will meet national health, safety, and hygiene requirements. \n \nC.  Impact on Living Standards \n \n50.  Socioeconomic and gender analysis, based on in-depth interviews, participatory rural \nappraisal,  and  household  survey,  has  shown  that  the  Project  will  have  significant  positive \nimpacts on the living standards of the rural population. Some 4,000 private farms and about \n70,000 dekhan farms, established within the project area in the past 3\u20134 years, urgently need \nland improvements. Decreasing soil salinity and increasing soil fertility, as well as building the \n                                                 \n36 The IEE is in Supplementary Appendix Q, while the summary SIEE is in Supplementary Appendix S. \n37 The list is in Supplementary Appendix Q. \n ", "16   \ncapacity of agricultural service providers and WUAs, are particularly important. About 85% of \nthe respondents in the project area have saline land, and 40% have land affected by high \ngroundwater. Only 10% of private farmers believe that their land is in good condition. During the \nstudy,  farmers  reported  that  the  growth  of  farm  productivity  and  household  incomes  is \nconstrained by (i) the deteriorated condition of I&D systems, (ii) limited access to credit and \ninputs, and (iii) high leasing costs for machinery. As many as 97% of respondents indicated that \nland improvement is critical to raising their living standards. The Project also is expected to have \na significant impact on the women employed in the agriculture sector.  \n \n1.  Poverty Reduction \n51.  The  household  survey  undertaken  during  project  preparation  showed  that  poverty \nincidence was similar in Navoi and Jandor district of Bukhara (28.3% and 27.3%, respectively), \nand as high as 37.3% in Kashkadarya. In 2004, the national average was 26.5%. Average \nextreme poverty is 5% in the entire project area. Project households generate up to 70% of their \nincome from agriculture and in-kind household consumption of products grown on household \nplots. Most of the poverty determinants are related to agriculture, and are explained by low \nincome in the agriculture sector. This, in turn, is explained by policy distortions, deteriorated \nland conditions, and lack of resources and skills. \n  \n52.  After  project  implementation,  household  incomes  will  increase  up  to  44.5%  in \nKashkadarya, 56.3% in Navoi, and 71.3% in Bukhara. Higher incomes of private and dekhan \nfarms will increase household incomes by 15% in Kashkadarya, 23% in Navoi, and 30% in \nJandor district of Bukhara. In-kind consumption growth will average 10\u201315% in the project area. \nIncome of poor households will increase by 16.0% in Kashkadarya, 12.5% in Navoi, and 18.0% \nin  Bukhara.  Productivity  growth,  combined  with  higher  income  and  consumption  of  poor \nhouseholds, will reduce poverty incidence at project completion (i) from 37.3% to 35.0% in \nKashkadarya, (ii) from 28.3% to 24.2% in Navoi, and (iii) from 27.3% to 22.5% in Bukhara.  \n \n53.  The project impact on employment within the project area will be moderate (2%), due to \nthe low elasticity of demand for labor in the agriculture sector. Production intensification should \nincrease employment in household and dekhan plots. Employment is also expected to grow (by \n3\u20134%) among service providers, I&D maintenance enterprises, and the related segments of the \nlabor market (trading, services, handcraftsmanship, and agricultural production processing).  \n \n2.  Gender and Development \n54.  During project preparation, a detailed PSGA was carried out (Appendix 11) and a Project \nParticipation Plan was prepared (Appendix 12). Key findings of the gender analysis confirm \nwomen's  increasing  exclusion  from  the  farm  privatization  process.  Based  on  the  potential \ngender impact of the Project, a project-specific GAP will promote the equal participation of all \nstakeholders as project beneficiaries. Proposed GAP activities aim to (i) establish quotas for \nwomen's  representation  in  the  decision-making  processes,  model  farms,  and  WUAs;  (ii) \nintegrate women's needs in the design and operation of project infrastructure; (iii) establish \nquotas for the participation of rural women farmers in training activities; and (iv) ensure the \neffective  involvement  of  women  in  the  project  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  Women\u2019s \nCommittee of the Republic of Uzbekistan, which is represented in the PMO, will be involved in \nimplementing gender design features, and monitoring gender-relevant targets and indicators, in \ncollaboration with the Association of Women's NGOs.38 \n \n                                                 \n38 Established in 2003, the Association of Women's NGOs comprises of 53 local women\u2019s NGOs. \n ", "  17\n \n3.  Rural Governance and Institutional Development \n55.  The Project will link the physical improvements with rural governance and institutional \ndevelopment, and enhanced land security. The Project will introduce improved and transparent \nland registration procedures and contracts to enhance farmers\u2019 security of land tenure. Rural \ninstitutions  to  be  developed  include  WUAs,  which  require  assistance  in  achieving  self-\nsustainability.  The  focus  of  their  development  will  be  on  improved  irrigation  management \nthrough participatory management and application. Rural women's groups also need to be \ndeveloped to broaden the opportunities for women to participate in all project activities at the \nfield and management level. The strongest institutions in rural areas are the provincial and \ndistrict governors. Their support, therefore, is essential to the success of the Project, and to \nimproved  rural  governance.  Through  the  TA  capacity  building  programs,  local  institutions\u2019 \nimplementing capacity will be enhanced to ensure their support for the Project.  \n \n4.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n56.  All rehabilitation works for the main system will be within the boundaries of existing \nstructures, or along existing canals and drains, which are within the Government\u2019s right-of-way. \nResults from field surveys and public consultations indicate that involuntary resettlement will not \nbe required for the main system works. The on-farm works include rehabilitation39 of minor on-\nfarm  structures  and  drains  on  leasehold  agricultural  land.  Participation  in  these  works  is \nvoluntary. Farmers and WUAs will be involved in the design, construction quality control, and \nrelated activities of the on-farm rehabilitation program. On-farm construction will start only after \nindividual farmers have signed construction contracts.   \n \n5.  Impact of the Project on Indigenous Peoples \n57.  Based on the poverty and social assessment, no ethnic minority issues are anticipated in \nthe project areas. The ethnic composition is homogeneous, with Uzbeks accounting for 97.3% \nof the population in Kashkadarya and Navoi, and 99.5% in Bukhara. Project beneficiaries will be \ntreated  equally,  and  the  Project  will  reduce  rural  poverty  and  improve  incomes  of  all \nstakeholders. Therefore, the Project will not have any adverse impacts on indigenous peoples \nor ethnic minorities, and will not activate ADB\u2019s policy on indigenous peoples.  \n \nD.  Risk Assessment  \n \n58.  Policy Reforms. The Project aims to bring about the enduring changes in addressing \nland degradation and implementing agriculture sector reforms at all levels, including in national \nand local governments, and beneficiaries. The Government has demonstrated its commitment \nto implementing agriculture sector reforms slowly, but consistently. The Government gradually \nhas raised production incentives through (i) accelerated farm privatization, (ii) decreased net \ntransfers from agriculture, (iii) reduced cotton and wheat procurement quotas, and (iv) gradual \nliberalization of the cotton trade. It has also developed a new simplified tax code for agriculture. \nTherefore, the risk that the Government might turn away from its commitment to reforming the \nagriculture sector and addressing land degradation in a comprehensive manner is considered \nlow. ADB and the World Bank continue to collaborate closely in monitoring and assessing the \nprogress of reforms. The associated TA will assess the outcomes and impacts of the reforms \nand promote awareness and understanding among stakeholders.  \n \n                                                 \n39 The private farmers will decide whether their land needs improvements, and will select the type of on-farm works. \n ", "18   \n59.  Institutions. Institutions with adequate capacity and legal authority must support the \nintended  behavior  changes.  In  particular,  the  institutions  responsible  for  sustainable  land \nmanagement  must  be  provided  with  clear  mandates  and  enhanced  capacity.  The  Project \nrecognizes  the  risk  of  falling  short  in  delivering  the  intended  results  due  to  institutional \nweaknesses. Thus, it aims to develop institutions based on several ongoing ADB-assisted \ninstitutional  strengthening  activities,  notably  for  water  sector  institutions,  WUAs,  and  land \nmanagement institutions. The proposed Project and associated TA will build on the progress \nfrom these activities, while the proposed GEF grant will support national level planning and \ninstitutional strengthening. \n \n60.  Project Implementation. One potential risk involves the inadequate maintenance of the \nrehabilitated I&D schemes due to a lack of funds and technical skills. The Project addresses this \nin two ways: (i) schemes with low O&M costs have been selected through systematic screening \nand consultation with stakeholders; and (ii) the Project will help develop participatory design, \nimplementation, and O&M of the selected schemes through WUAs, utilizing the experience from \nthe ADB-financed Ak Altin Agricultural Development Project in WUA development and training, \nin close collaboration with other funding agencies. The reform agenda that will be implemented \nunder the Project also will support institutional strengthening of MAWR and WUAs, and raise \nfarmers\u2019 incomes to enable them to invest in sustainable water management. \n \n61.  Operation and Maintenance. There is discernable risk of the rehabilitated I&D schemes \nnot being maintained adequately due to the lack of funds and technical skills. The Project \naddresses this risk by (i) selecting, through systematic screening and consultation, schemes \nwith low O&M costs; and (ii) developing participatory design, implementation, and O&M of these \nschemes through WUAs utilizing the experience of the ADB financed Ak Altin Project in WUA \ndevelopment and training, in close collaboration with other funding agencies. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n62.  The following conditions and assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents, \nhave been agreed with the Government: \n \n(i)  The  Government  will  ensure  timely  and  adequate  budgetary  funds  for \nmaintaining the normal operation of the project I&D systems, and will continue \nproviding capital replacement and O&M for primary and secondary canals and \ndrains until the costs can be recovered from the beneficiaries. \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that contractors employed under the Project fully \ncomply with applicable labor laws of the Government, and provide adequate \nsafety and health protection of workers employed. The Government will ensure \nthat no minors will be employed for works financed with the proceeds of the loan, \nin compliance with the Government\u2019s legislation prohibiting child labor.  \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that within 6 months from the beginning of project \nimplementation, an adequate financing and accounting control system will be \nestablished to allow the PMO and the PIUs to apply international accounting \nstandards acceptable to ADB. For the purpose of conducting external audit of \naccounts, the loan proceeds may be used to finance expenditure for private \nsector auditors and translation of auditors\u2019 reports into English, provided that (a) \nsuch auditors have qualifications, expertise, and terms of reference acceptable to \nADB; and (b) the recruitment process is acceptable to ADB. \n \n ", "  19\n \n(iv)  The  Project  will  be  carried  out,  and  all  facilities  constructed,  operated, \nmaintained, and monitored, in accordance with the existing laws, regulations, and \nstandards of the Government concerning environmental protection, and ADB\u2019s \nenvironment policy; and the Government will ensure that MAWR implements the \nenvironmental mitigation measures and monitoring requirements as outlined in \nthe IEE. Further, the Government will assure that appropriate resources including \nbudgetary allocation are provided and the State Committee of Nature Protection \nfulfills  its  responsibilities  for  implementation  of  mitigation  measures  and \nmonitoring requirements, as outlined in the IEE. \n(v)  All civil works will be undertaken on Government rights-of-way and no persons \nwill be affected. In case that construction beyond the Government rights-of-way \nis required which results in impacts on people, the Government will prepare a \nresettlement plan based on detailed designs and in accordance with ADB's policy \non  involuntary  resettlement  policy.  The  plan will  be  disclosed  to  all  affected \npersons  in  a  form  and  language  that  they  can  understand,  and  it  will  be \nsubmitted with the EA's endorsement to ADB for review and approval before any \ncivil works contract is awarded. \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that the GAP is implemented in a timely manner \nover the entire project period, and that adequate resources are allocated for this \npurpose. The GAP will aim at: (a) establishing quotas for women's representation \nin  the  decision-making  processes,  in  demonstration  farms,  and  WUAs;  (b) \nintegrating women's needs in the design and operation of project infrastructure; \n(c)  establishing  targets  for  women  farmers'  participation  in  training;  and  (d) \nensuring women's effective involvement in the monitoring and evaluation of the \nProject. Implementation of the GAP will be closely monitored, and the progress \nreported in the quarterly reports to ADB.  \n(vii)  Commencing from the cropping season of 2007, the Government will set the \nmandatory state procurement quota for cotton and wheat in the project districts to \n25% of the long-term average actual production achieved during 2001\u20132005 to \nbe expressed in tons for each project district. Farmers will maintain their right to \nsell to the Government their over-quota production. \n(viii)  Commencing from the cropping season of 2007, the Government shall ensure \nthat individual farmers in the project districts (a) receive final payment for raw \ncotton after crop delivery, according to their contracts with the gins; and (b) are \nentitled to sell above-quota cotton at their discretion to any buyer in accordance \nwith the current legislation.  \n(ix)  Commencing from the 2007 cropping season, the procurement prices for raw \ncotton and wheat and future price adjustments for these commodities will reflect \nchanges in international border prices, inflation, and market-based exchange \nrates.  For  raw  cotton,  the  procurement  price  will  be  in  accordance  with \nPresidential Decree No. UP/3114 of 20 August 2002 entitled \u201cThe mechanism for \nsetting-up procurement prices for cotton.\u201d \n(x)  Cropping patterns, production, marketing, and financial activities in the project \ndistricts will be carried out independently by the farmers (without interference of \nthe local authorities), and the sale of agriculture produce will be decided by the \nindividual farmers, pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 3226 of 24 March 2003 \nentitled \u201cOn the Most Important Directions of Deepening Agricultural Reforms.\u201d \n(xi)  The land use right lease between the Government and farmers in project districts \nwill be improved and registered to ensure protection of farmer\u2019s land use rights \n(a) from outright cancellations of these contracts and eviction from farmland \nwithout  recourse  to  legal  process,  and  (b)  systems  of  fair  and  transparent \n ", "20   \nwarnings and penalties be introduced for breaches of contract conditions. The \nGovernment shall ensure that the land lease contracts are inheritable and can be \nused as collateral to access loans from commercial banks, pursuant to the Land \nCode and the Central Bank Regulation No. 54 dated 10 January 2005.  \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n \n63.  As a condition for loan effectiveness, the Government will adopt resolutions confirming \nthat (i) the project-specific assurances stated in items vii to xi in para. 62 will be implemented, \nand (ii) the PMO has been established, including the appointment of manager and provision of \noffice and facilities. \n \nVII.

Macroeconomic Context \n1.  Since  independence  in  1991,  Uzbekistan\u2019s  economy  has  been  in  transition  from  a \ncentrally  planned,  command-based  structure  to  a  more  market-oriented  system.  The \nGovernment has adopted a gradual approach to this transition, with the state retaining a central \nrole in the economic life of the country. For example, the introduction of structural adjustment \nmeasures, including the privatization of state enterprises, has remained slow.  \n \n2.  Uzbekistan\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate increased from 4.2% in 2002 to \n4.4% in 2003, driven by a robust performance of the agriculture sector and a rebound of the \ntrade sector,2 according to official estimates. The economic forecast for Uzbekistan shows that \nreal GDP growth might decline from 4.4% in 2005 to 4.0% (2006) and 3.9% (2007). In addition, \nprice trends for cotton, Uzbekistan\u2019s main export commodity, appear favorable in 2006\u20132007, as \na rundown of global stocks will lead to a gradual rise in prices. The textile sector\u2019s contribution \nto economic growth should increase, as new cotton processing facilities begin operations.3 \n \nB.  Sector Context \n3.  Contribution of the Agriculture Sector to the Economy. Agriculture is a key sector of \nthe economy, accounting for an estimated 29% of the GDP and about 25% of export earnings. \nThe agriculture sector employs up to 33% of the population. Uzbekistan is the world\u2019s sixth \nlargest cotton producer, and more than 80% of cotton production is exported as raw fiber. \nMoreover, agriculture is an important source of income for the rest of the economy, and annual \nnet  transfers  out  of  agriculture  are  significant.  These  transfers  are  made  possible  by  an \ninstitutional and policy framework that gives the Government control over the production and \nmarketing of the two major crops, cotton and wheat.  \n \n4.  Main Crops. Cotton and wheat are the two strategic crops. Cotton is grown on 41% of \nthe irrigated land, while wheat is cultivated on 42% of irrigated land. The Government imposes \nproduction  quotas  on  these  crops.  Other  crops  include  fodder  (9%  of  irrigated  land);  and \npotatoes, vegetables, and fruits (less than 8% of irrigated land).   \n \n5.  Land Resources. Uzbekistan has 44,410 million hectares (ha) of land resources.4 The \ncountry\u2019s physical geography can be divided into three zones: (i) desert (Kyzylkum), steppe, and \nsemi-arid region, covering 60% of the country; (ii) fertile valleys (Ferghana valley, Samarkand \noasis), which border the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers; and (iii) mountainous areas in the \neast, with peaks 4,500 meters (m) above sea level (Tien Shan and Gissaro-Alay Ridges). \nUzbekistan\u2019s ability to maintain the economic potential of its land is increasingly threatened by \nsevere land degradation, resulting from (i) secondary salinization, (ii) waterlogging and flooding, \n(iii) loss of organic matter, (iv) water erosion and pollution; and (v) aerial transport of salt and \ndust from the dry bed of the Aral Sea to irrigated lands.  \n \n6.  Land Degradation. Land degradation is widespread, with the most adverse impacts \nbeing experienced in the provinces of Bukhara, Navoi, and Kashkadarya, as well as in the \nFergana Valley. While erosion from water and wind are the major forms of land degradation, \n                                                 \n1  The full description is presented in Supplementary Appendix A, Agriculture and Water Sector Review. \n2  ADB. 2004. Uzbekistan Country Program and Strategy Update 2004\u20132006. Manila. \n3  EIU. 2006. Uzbekistan Country Report. London. \n4  FAO. 2002. Gateway to Land and Water Information Uzbekistan. Rome.  \n   ", "26  Appendix 2   \nsecondary  salinization  is  one  of  the  most  important  factors.  Caused  mainly  by  the  over-\nirrigation, secondary salinization affects up to 47% of the irrigated area. Irrigable land is being \ndegraded steadily. Of the more than 4.1 million hectares (ha) of irrigable land, an estimated \n20,000 ha are abandoned each year. The abandonment results from (i) progressive failure of \nthe irrigation systems, (ii) inadequate drainage, and (iii) increasing soil salinity. Due to lack of \nmaintenance, the drainage systems also have deteriorated, which has caused water tables to \nrise as leaks and other losses from the irrigation system steadily worsen. Land salinization \ncauses an estimated $31 million in annual crop production losses in Uzbekistan, while the \neconomic value of land abandoned due to high salinity is approximately $12 million.  \n \n7.  Water Resources. The climate of Uzbekistan is continental and arid. Average annual \nrainfall is 264 millimeters (mm), ranging from less than 97 mm in the northwest to 425 mm in the \nmountainous zone. Rainfall occurs during the winter season, mainly between October and April. \nThe two river basins in Uzbekistan\u2014the Amu Darya basin in the south and the Syr Darya basin \nin the north\u2014cover 86.5% of and 13.5% of the country, respectively, and form the Aral Sea \nbasin. The estimated average surface runoff is (i) 22.33 cubic kilometers (km\u00b3)/year for the Syr \nDarya  River  basin  at  the  border  between  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Uzbekistan,  of  which \n11.8 km3/year is transit flow to Tajikistan; (ii) 11.54 km\u00b3/year for the Syr Darya River basin at the \nborder  between  Tajikistan  and  Uzbekistan,  of  which  10 km3/year  is  transit  flow  to \nKazakhstan; and (iii) 22 km3/year for the Amu Darya River basin. The total river flow generated \ninside Uzbekistan is estimated at 9.54 km3/year.5 \n \n8.  Irrigation is vital to Uzbekistan\u2019s agriculture because of its climate. The design of the \nirrigation and drainage (I&D) infrastructure developed during the Soviet era was geared mainly \nto cotton production. Most I&D works were constructed according to sound technical standards. \nSince the late 1980s, however, funds to maintain I&D infrastructure adequately have been \nlacking. During 2000\u20132003, maintenance of regular irrigation works covered only an estimated \n55\u201366% of actual requirements. More than 60% of irrigated land depends to some extent on \nwater pumping, either for irrigation or drainage. Of the 5,100 pumping stations, more than 80% \nof  major,  50%  of  medium,  and  30%  of  small  pumping  stations  need  rehabilitation  or \nreplacement, according to estimates. Official figures indicate an irrigation efficiency rate of 60%. \nIn many areas, however, as little as 40% of the water reaches the field. On average, at least \n50% of irrigation water is lost in the system. \n \nC.  Institutions \n9.  Public  Institutions.  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Water Resources  (MAWR)  of \nUzbekistan was established in 1996, and its organizational structure was approved in 2001. The \nmain  functions  of  MAWR  are  (i)  to  monitor  compliance  with  the  legislation  on  water, \ncooperatives  (shirkat),  and  private  farms;  (ii)  to  participate  in  the  development  and \nimplementation of branch and regional agriculture, as well as water management development \nprograms in conjunction with other Government ministries and agencies, state committees, and \nlocal and Government state bodies; (iii) to coordinate the development and implementation of \nmeasures  for  multisector  agriculture  and  rights  protection  of  rural  producers,  with  other \nministries, agencies, and state committees; and (iv) to develop the strategy for rural industrial \nand social infrastructure.6 MAWR, therefore, is the national institution responsible for I&D. As \nsuch, it has offices at central, province, and district levels. Following the 2003 presidential \ndecree on deepening reforms in agriculture, MAWR is being reorganized. The decree promotes \n                                                 \n5  FAO. 1997. Aquastat Country Profile Uzbekistan. Rome. \n6  Information on MAWR from the Portal of the State Authority (www.gov.uz). \n  \n \n ", "          Appendix 2       27 \nthe  introduction  of  a  basin-level  water  resource  management  system.  Before  2003,  the \ninstitutional  structure  of  the  water  management  system  was  based  on  administrative \nboundaries. Now the Government is completing the restructuring of local organizations into \nwater management agencies based on 10 basins.  \n10.  Financing for the Sector. MAWR is a self-financing entity, receiving contributions from \nits provincial departments and organizations. A review of the last 3 years of income statements \nshows that the planned level of revenue for MAWR was around $1 million annually. However, \nonly 60\u201380% of the planned amount was received. Thus, MAWR had barely enough money for \nsalaries; social insurance; business trips; and operation and maintenance (O&M) of buildings, \ncars, equipment, and other operating expenses. A new system of financing cotton and wheat \nhas  been  introduced  for  private  farms.  Despite  the  low  annual  interest  rate  of  3%,  the \ncomplexity of the credit application has discouraged many farmers. In response to the rapidly \ngrowing number of private farms, banks are expanding their branch network into rural areas.  \n11.  Property Rights and Land Tenure. Uzbekistan has three main types of agricultural \nproducers: (i) shirkats (cooperative farms), (ii) private farms, and (iii) dekhan farms (household \nplots). With the restructuring of shirkats accelerating in recent years, private farms are expected \nto dominate the agriculture sector soon. Although the first private farms were created in 1992, \nmost date from 1996. As of late 2004, the country had more than 100,000 private farms, \ncultivating about 1.6 million hectares (38% of irrigated land). Despite the rapid restructuring of \nshirkats into private farms, the registration of allocated land has not made similar progress. In \naddition,  during  the  restructuring  of  shirkats,  some  farmers  expressed  concern  that  the \ndistribution of land is neither fair nor transparent. Private property and written contracts are also \ndifficult to enforce. Finally, as the land tenure agreement between the leaseholder and the local \ngovernment has no transferable value, it cannot be used as collateral to obtain credit from \nbanks.  \n \nD.  Policy Environment \n12.  The Government\u2019s agricultural strategy is focused on three broad goals: (i) generation of \nforeign  exchange  earnings;  (ii)  improvement  in  food  security;  and  (iii)  promotion  of  rural \nemployment, improvement in living standards, and enhanced social stability. The Government \nintervenes in the agriculture sector by setting production targets for cotton and wheat, fixing \noutput prices, and executing procurement quotas. In 2001, in line with the sector strategy and \nunder pressure from funding agencies, the Government agreed to pilot test procurement and \npricing  policy  reforms  in  six  districts  covered by  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Ak  Altin \nAgricultural Development Project7 and the World Bank\u2019s Rural Enterprise Support Project. The \nreforms under these projects focused on (i) abolition or easing of wheat and cotton production \ntargets,  (ii)  reduction  in  the  mandatory  crop  procurement  quotas,  (iii)  abolition  of  joint \nresponsibility of farms and family groups for fulfilling procurement quotas, (iv) adjustment of the \nstate procurement prices based on movement of international prices and domestic inflation, and \n(v) gradual reduction in wheat and cotton procurement by the Government.  \n \n13.  Agricultural Taxation. Before 1999, the Government imposed a variety of agricultural \ntaxes, including profit tax, value-added tax (VAT), environment tax, water tax, property tax, land \ntax, and other local taxes and fees. On average, agricultural enterprises paid about 23% tax on \ntheir revenue, and 18% on their cost of production. In 1999, the Government introduced a single \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n   ", "28  Appendix 2   \nland tax to unify and simplify agricultural taxation. This applies to all agricultural producers \nexcept dekhan farmers, who pay land tax, water tax, and property tax. Since the introduction of \nthe new unified land tax in Tashkent and Samarkand oblasts, the overall tax burden declined \nfrom 23% in 1999 to 14.6% in 2003. \n \n14.  Water Sector Priorities. The rehabilitation of key water management facilities is one of \nthe  Government\u2019s  top  national  priorities.  The  Government  recognizes  that  rehabilitation  is \nrequired to protect the livelihoods of many rural people, and to maintain the basic resource and \ninfrastructure foundation. Without such rehabilitation, ongoing reforms to increase agricultural \nproduction and to increase farm income would be compromised. In 2001, with the assistance of \nthe World Bank, the Government prepared a strategy for the irrigation and drainage subsector. \nA two-phase approach was proposed. The first phase comprised a public investment program to \nrehabilitate priority works of the main and inter-farm I&D systems. The second phase covered \nthe  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  all  I&D infrastructure in  Uzbekistan,  and  would  include \nimprovements to the on-farm infrastructure funded mainly by water users\u2019 association (WUAs) \nand farmers.  \n \nE.  Binding Constraints to Sector Performance \n15.  Since 1991, the cotton subsector has been in decline, with cotton planting area and \nproductivity steadily falling. Cotton area has declined from 1.75 million ha in 1991 to 1.4 million \nhectares in 2003, while cotton yields have fallen from about 2.55 tons (t)/ha in the early 1990s to \na current average of 2.25 t/ha. This reduced cotton output from 4.5 million tons in 1991 to 3.2 \nmillion  tons  in  2004.  Some  of  the  binding  constraints  to  sustainable  development  in  the \nagriculture sector can be grouped into three broad categories: incentives, infrastructure, and \ninstitutions. \n \n16.  Incentives. The Government\u2019s restrictive pricing and procurement policies give farmers \nlittle incentive to increase their productivity and efficiency. Rigid control is largely limited to \ncotton and wheat marketing, with the Government acquiring almost all cotton and 50% of wheat. \nShirkats and private farmers growing cotton and wheat also are required to sell a significant \nproportion  of  their  produce  to  the  Government  at  fixed  prices.8 Implicit  taxes,  through \nsuppressed  cotton  and  wheat  prices,  are  a  major  source  of  financial  transfers  from  the \nagriculture sector. These implicit taxes include the non-repayment of VAT on the sales of seed \ncotton, and the inefficient Government monopoly of cotton processing and marketing. This \npricing policy and tax burden significantly reduces the gross incomes of private farmers and \nshirkats, which are required to meet compulsory production quotas for cotton and wheat. VAT, \nwhich is applied by Government, was reduced from 16% to 13% as of 5 July 2005. \n \n17.  In addition, the cropping pattern imposed by the Government is highly detrimental to soil \nfertility. As cotton and wheat tend to exhaust the soil, a significant proportion of the area (30%\u2013\n40%) could be planted with lucerne and other leguminous crops to replenish soil nutrition, \nabsorb salts, and supply feed for livestock.  \n \n18.  Shirkats  and  private  farms  deliver  their  cotton  and  wheat  quotas  to  Government-\ncontrolled purchasing centers. After the crop is delivered and inspected, farms are paid via \naccount transfers through local banks (a detailed description of the full cotton marketing chain is \npresented  in  a  recent  World  Bank  report9).  In  2002,  however,  the  Government  made  a \n                                                 \n8  Farmers are required to sell 50% of their raw cotton and wheat at fixed prices to the Government. \n9  World Bank. 2003.

In 2002, 20,000 t of \ncotton were sold through an auction system established by the commodities exchange. The \nquantities of cotton marketed through this exchange are expected to expand rapidly in the \nfuture. Wheat marketing is less regulated, with a number of private mills purchasing non-quota \nwheat from farmers. \n \n19.  Even though the state procurement prices were increased recently to more closely \nreflect world market prices, and procurement quotas are being relaxed gradually, the current \npolicies are still very restrictive and severely limit a farmer\u2019s ability to allocate resources to \nalternative farm enterprises in a productive and profitable manner. Farmers who fail to meet \nproduction  targets  can face  punishments  from  local  authorities,  including  lower prices  and \npossible eviction from their land. Farmers, therefore, have very little incentive to increase their \nproductivity and efficiency under these restrictive pricing and procurement policies. \n \n20.  Infrastructure. The Government has been unable to provide sufficient funds for capital \ninvestment and operation and maintenance (O&M) to ensure that I&D infrastructure remains in \nsatisfactory condition. Since the mid 1990s, only about 40% of the funds needed for O&M have \nbeen allocated in the budget. Between 1995 and 2002, Government financing of water sector \nfell from 2.9% of GDP to 1.8% (i.e., 60% reduction), while the resources allocated for capital \ninvestment  in  the  water  sector  also  declined  from  0.9%  of  GDP  to  0.6%.11 As  a  result, \nconsiderable deferred capital and O&M expenditure (estimated at more than 40% of total asset \nvalue)  is  urgently  required  to  return  the  system  to  a  satisfactory  standard.  On-farm  I&D \ninfrastructure is also in very poor condition, as the low net returns from cotton and wheat \nproduction over the past decade have reduced the financial resources available to maintain \nthese systems.  \n \n21.  The cost recovery mechanism for O&M of I&D infrastructure is ineffective and almost \nentirely dependent on Government budget allocations, which have been diminishing in recent \nyears. The vast majority of farmers receive irrigation water for free. This lack of funding and \nneglect of basic maintenance requirements have jeopardized the future sustainability of irrigated \nagriculture.  \n \n22.  The decline in the condition of I&D infrastructure contributes to the depletion of the \nagricultural resource base, as well as to environmental degradation. The continued deterioration \nof  I&D  infrastructure,  which  could  lead  to  the  collapse  of  some  of  these  systems,  also \nendangers the livelihoods of millions of rural people who depend on the efficient operation of \nthese  large-scale  irrigation  systems.  Moreover,  unless  this  deterioration  is  arrested,  it  will \nundermine the ongoing agriculture sector reform program, which cannot succeed without the \neffective functioning of basic I&D infrastructure. It also will harm the livelihoods of the future \nfarming generations. \n \n23.  Institutions.  One  of  the  key  limitations  to  the  accelerated  development  of  private \nfarming is the lack of adequate support services, such as input supply, machinery services, and \ncredit facilities. The quantity and timing of farm inputs is often unreliable. Machinery services are \nalso  frequently  not  available  in  a  timely  manner,  which  undermines  crop  productivity. \nGovernment agencies and banks are responsible for financing and rationing 90% of input \nsupplies. Inputs for cotton and wheat are rationed according to production plans, and their use \n                                                 \n10 Letter of Intent of the Government of Uzbekistan on Policy Reforms to the IMF, 29 July 2002. \n11 Center for Economic Research, Uzbekistan. \n   ", "30  Appendix 2   \nfor other crops is strictly forbidden. Input quantities are based on MAWR norms calculated for \nplanned cotton and wheat production areas.  \n \nF.  Conclusion \n24.  These sector constraints have a profound impact on the livelihoods of rural farmers. \nCompared with other sectors of the economy, incomes from agriculture are very low. Rural \nincomes are estimated to have dropped to less than 5% of urban wage rates. The increasing \ndisparity has resulted from a combination of falling rural incomes and the need for the farm \nsector to absorb a high proportion of the growth in the working population. Furthermore, the \nprivate agribusiness sector remains poorly developed, largely due to the unclear business \nenvironment. Private rural businesses involved in trading, processing, or construction generally \nare limited to small-scale operations with modest capital investment. \n \n25.  The main binding constraint seems to be the system of incentives, such as the state \nproduction  quota,  restrictive  crop  procurement,  and  pricing  policies.  These  policies  and \npractices do not provide sufficient motivation and freedom of choice for private farmers to \nincrease investments in their land to realize productivity gains, implement more sustainable \ncropping systems, and choose higher value products. Hence, the proposed Land Improvement \nProject emphasizes policy reforms. The other key binding constraint that the proposed Project \nwill address is the deterioration of land and water infrastructure, and the lack of effective O&M \ncost recovery mechanisms. Thus, the Project will include a component on rehabilitating such \ninfrastructure, coupled with the adoption of improved on-farm management practices, as well as \na component on strengthening land and water institutions. \n \n  \n \n ", "       Appendix 3  31\n   \n \n \nMAJOR EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE AGRICULTURE AND WATER SECTORS \n  Funding  Amount      \nProject  Source  ($ million)  Year  Location \n   \n         \nCotton Subsector Improvement  World Bank 66.0  1995\u20132005  National \n \nRural Enterprise Support Project  World Bank 36.0  2001\u20132006  Five Districts \n(Appraisal)   \nDrainage, Irrigation, and Wetlands  World Bank 60.0  2003\u20132010  Three Districts in \nImprovement  South \nKarakalpakstan \nAk Altin Agricultural Development  ADB  36.0  2000\u20132006  Ak Altin \n \nThe Grain Productivity Improvement   ADB  26.0  2004\u20132009  Tashkent, \nSamarkand, Jizzak \nAmu Zhang Irrigation Rehabilitation  ADB  73.0  2004\u20132009  Sukhandarya \n \nIrrigated Agriculture and Food Industry  EU  1.6  1997\u20132001  National \nDevelopment \nRegional Agricultural Development  EU  2.4  1997\u20132001   \n \nSupply of O&M Equipment to the MAWR   PRC  5.1  2005\u20132006  Navoi, Bukhara, \nKashkadarya, and \nother oblasts \nIntegrated Water Management  SDC/IWMI  4.8  2001\u20132008  Kyrgyz Republic, \nTajikistan, and \nUzbekistan \nRegional  Special  Initiative  Water  USAID  10.0  2002\u20132005   \nProgram   \nNatural Resources Management  USAID  25.0  2000\u20132005  Kyrgyz Republic, \nTajikistan, and \nUzbekistan (various \nprovinces) \nWater User Associations Support  USAID  25.0  2004\u20132009  Kyrgyz Republic, \nTajikistan, and \nUzbekistan  \nTotal    370.9     \nADB \u2013 Asian Development Bank; EU \u2013 European Union; IWMI \u2013 International Water Management Institute; PRC \u2013 \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China; SDC \u2013 Swiss Development Corporation; USAID \u2013 United States Agency for International \nDevelopment; WB \u2013 World Bank \n \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n   ", "   \n3\n            COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN   2\n \n    \n \n \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES    \n \n \nTable A4.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Category  A\np\np\n  e\nn\n(SUM % % Total dix\nmillion) ($'000) Foreign Base  4\nExpenditure Accounts Local Foreign Total Local Foreign Total Exchange Costs    \n \n \n \n \nI.

Rationale for Public Intervention \n \n1.  Agriculture remains critical to the livelihoods of rural communities and the sustainable \ngrowth of Uzbekistan\u2019s economy. To achieve the sector goal of accelerated, environmentally \nsustainable  development,  key  constraints  must  be  removed  to  reverse  natural  resource \ndepletion, improve land and water management, and improve productivity.  \n \n2.  Rapidly worsening land degradation is threatening the performance of the agriculture \nsector. Land degradation causes an estimated $31 million in annual crop production losses in \nUzbekistan. If land degradation is not arrested, and irrigation and drainage (I&D) facilities are \nallowed to deteriorate further, the cropped area could shrink by up to 25% over the next 30 \nyears,  according  to  estimates.  As  a  result,  crop  yields  will  continue  to  decline,  and  the \nlivelihoods of a large proportion of the poor rural population\u2014and of the subsequent rural \ngenerations\u2014will be jeopardized.  \n \n3.  Public sector involvement is necessary to address market and institutional failures in the \nagriculture sector. Through this Project, the Government will implement key policy reforms and \naddress institutional constraints, including (i) reducing production quotas to improve farmers\u2019 \nincentives in project areas, (ii) reducing interventions by local authorities into farming activities, \nand (iii) improving land tenure rights. \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s Role. The new Asian Development Bank (ADB) country strategy and program \n(2006\u20132010)2 in  Uzbekistan  recognizes  that  the  main  constraints  to  increasing  agricultural \nproductivity  are  (i)  the  state  procurement  system,  and  (ii)  state  intervention  in  inputs  and \nmarketing. It also recognizes the need to strengthen land rights, as well as market and land and \nwater  management  institutions,  and  to  maintain  the  physical  state  of  land  and  water \ninfrastructure.  This  Project  is  complemented  by  other  ADB  activities  in  Uzbekistan,  which \nsupport  the  ongoing  policy  and  institutional  reforms  (e.g.,  alternative  procurement  quota \nsystems and the formulation of a water delivery cost recovery policy).  \n \nB.  Financial and Economic Impact and Feasibility \n1.  Expected Benefits \n5.  Economic and financial analysis of the \u201cwith project\u201d and \u201cwithout project\u201d scenarios was \ncarried out to assess the economic impact and viability of the Project. This analysis also aimed \nto determine the financial impact on farmers, as well as the impact of project-related reforms. \nThe main economic benefits are expected from (i) avoidance of production losses that would \nhave occurred without the Project due to further land degradation; (ii) increased productivity \nfrom a more efficient alignment of cotton, wheat, and other cropping patterns; and higher cotton \nand wheat yields resulting from the implementation of proposed technical, institutional, and \npolicy  interventions;  (iii)  higher  and  more  sustainable  farmer  incomes  derived  from  price \nincentives and profitability improvements; and (iv) an increase in net Government revenue from \nthe project area. \n \n                                                 \n1 The  full  description  is  presented  in  Supplementary  Appendix  N,  Financial  and  Economic  Analysis;  and \nSupplementary Appendix O, Detailed Cost Tables. \n2  ADB. 2006.

The sum \nwas used as the unit of account, at the official exchange rate of SUM1,207 to $1 (March 2006). \nBasic assumptions used in the analysis include: \n \n(i)  The use of a domestic price numeraire. \n \n(ii)  The  project  implementation  period  is  over  6  years,  and  the  project  life \n(following project completion) is estimated at 25 years.  \n \n(iii)  Economic prices for traded goods (i.e., wheat, cotton, and chemical fertilizers) \nwere derived from World Bank commodity price projections3 for 2015. Prices \nwere converted to 2006 constant prices using the manufacturing unit values \nindex, and were adjusted for insurance, freight, processing, transport, and \nhandling to determine economic farm gate prices. Economic prices for cotton \nwere derived on an export parity basis, while the economic prices for wheat \nand fertilizers were calculated on an import parity basis.  \n \n(iv)  For imported goods and services, a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.18 was \nused. In view of the high subsidy levels of machinery services, a conversion \nfactor of 1.33 was used for converting financial prices to economic values. \n \n(v)  A shadow wage rate factor of 0.80 was used to reflect rural employment rates. \n \n(vi)  The unified land tax has been included in the farm budget financial analysis. \nAverage  land  tax  within  the  subproject  area  is  estimated  to  range  from \nSUM8,000 per hectares (ha) to SUM11,000 per ha.   \n \n(vii)  Taxes and duties were omitted in the economic valuation. \n \n7.  Without Project (Current) Yield Assumptions. The current \u201cwithout project\u201d cropping \npattern comprises 58.2% cotton and 38.7% wheat (weighted average in the project districts), as \nshown in Table A5.1. Current yields in the project area were based on data collected from the \nproject  districts,  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Water  Resources  (MAWR),  and  household \nsocioeconomic surveys.

The level of production quotas has been calculated based on the \ncurrent weighted average yields, which is in line with the approach used on the ongoing ADB-\nfinanced Ak Altin Agricultural Development Project,4 Grain Productivity Improvement Project,5 \nand Amu Zang Irrigation Rehabilitation Project.6 Cotton and wheat production under 50% quotas \nare estimated as percentages of the present (without the project) weighted average yields (e.g., \n2.01 t/ha for cotton and 2.11 t/ha for wheat), and are assumed to be 50% less under the 25% \nquota scenario. The formula used for these calculations is:  \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n  \n \n ", "  Appendix 5  37   \n \nQuota Production = Cultivated Area x % Under Cotton or Wheat x Present Yield x Quota % \n \nFor example, the 50% quota for cotton in the full rehabilitation area is 60,785 ha x 58% x \n2.01t/ha x 50% = 35,650 t. The 25% cotton quota for the same area is calculated at 9,939 tons. \n \nTable A5.2: Cotton and Wheat Production and Procurement Quotas in the Project Area \n \n   Crop  Cotton  Wheat  Cotton  Wheat \nProduction Quotas (%)  100  100  50  25  50  25 \nProduction from Full              \n   Rehabilitation Area  71,301  49,666  35,650  17,825  24,833   12,417 \nProduction from Off-Farm I&D              \n   Rehabilitation Area  76,071  52,990  38,036  19,018  26,495   13,247 \nProduction from Areas w/o              \n   Direct Project Benefits  43,020  29,967  21,510  10,755  14,983   7,492 \n            \n   Total Present Production  190,392  132,623  95,196  47,598  66,311   33,156 \nI&D \u2013 irrigation and drainage \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n10.  The \u201cwith project\u201d analysis on the policy reforms assumed that (i) over-quota prices are \n20% higher than quota prices mandated by the Government and applied countrywide; (ii) over-\nquota  cotton  production  is  sold  to  the  Government;  (iii)  the  Government  sales  price  is \nSUM350,000/t ($289.98/ton) for cotton and SUM119,000/ton ($98.59/ton) for wheat; and (iv) \ndirect cotton production subsidies7 include cotton production credit at concessional rate, oil price \ndifferential, fuel value added tax (VAT), machinery, fertilizers VAT, and ammonium nitrate. \nWheat  subsidies  and  additional  export  earnings  from  increased  production,  which  are  not \nincluded in this analysis, would increase Government revenues further.  \n \n3.  Economic Impact and Viability of the Project \n11.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project is calculated at 21.5% with a \nnet present value of $26.78 million at a 12% discount rate. EIRRs were calculated for each of \nthe subproject areas, and all are above 12%. These analyses were carried out on the base case \n(para. 8). The results of the sensitivity analysis show that the project\u2019s economic viability is \nsensitive to declines in crop yields, drops in world prices for cotton, quota relaxation, and delays \nin physical works. As the economic impact of the Project hinges on the policy reforms, namely \nthe relaxation of production quotas, the expected economic impact is discussed in the section \non impact of policy reforms. \n \n4.  Financial Impact on Farmers \n12.  Project area interventions will mitigate the gradual loss of production due to further land \ndegradation. Over the past 15 years, an estimated 12,000 ha (or 11% of the irrigable project \narea) has been abandoned. Without the rehabilitation of I&D infrastructure, another 13,000 ha of \nland could go out of production over the next 15 years. \n \n                                                 \n7  Estimates are based on the World Bank. 2005. Cotton Taxation in Uzbekistan. Washington, DC. The direct \nsubsidies are calculated pro rata for the cotton area within Land Improvement Project.  \n   ", "38  Appendix 5   \n13.  For 60,780 ha of the project area, the full rehabilitation of I&D infrastructure, coupled \nwith improved land and water management, are expected to lead to improved crop yields, \nhigher cropping intensity, and an expansion of the irrigated area. Cotton yields are expected to \nincrease from 2.6 t/ha to 3.4 t/ha in Navoi, 1.8 t/ha to 2.8 tons/ha in Bukhara, 2.2 t/ha to 3.2 t/ha \nin Kasan, and 1.5 t/ha to 2.7 t/ha in Kamashi and Guzar. In the areas where rehabilitation works \ncover only off-farm infrastructure, the Project is expected to benefit an additional 75,404 ha. For \nthis area, cotton yields are expected to increase by about 10% and wheat yields by 16%. \nModest increases in cropping intensity are expected from expanded horticulture and fodder \ncrops for local markets. \n \n14.  For each subproject area, farm budgets were prepared for private farms (30 ha) and \ndekhan farms (0.25 ha). These farm models were based on the crop budgets and cropping \npatterns derived from detailed information on crop areas, crop yields, input use, labor and \nmachinery requirements, and input and output prices collected for private and dekhan farms \nduring the agro-economic survey. For private farms, net farm incomes are expected to increase \nby an average of $4,120 per year, or $3,940 after operation and maintenance (O&M) fees. The \nProject will have a positive impact on the net value of production of dekhan farms with increases \nranging  from  23%  in  Navoi  to  30%  in  Kashkadarya.  Annual  O&M  costs  for  the  on-farm \ninfrastructure were estimated at $68/ha, and $12/ha is assumed to be needed to cover part of \nthe O&M costs for the main and inter-farm systems.  \n \n15.  Affordability.  The  farm  budget  analysis  demonstrates  that  the  increased  crop \nproduction, combined with the quota reduction from 50% to 25%, will enable farmers to meet \nthe on-farm investment and O&M costs. On the basis of this analysis, an assessment was \nundertaken of the farmers\u2019 capacity to pay I&D fees sufficient to meet (i) O&M costs for on-farm \ncivil works, (ii) O&M costs for part of main and inter-farm civil works (i.e., excluding pumping), \nand (iii) betterment levy to meet 100% of the on-farm rehabilitation costs. In the \u201cfuture with the \nproject\u201c situation, the annual O&M expenditure required for on-farm infrastructure was estimated \nat SUM75,500 per hectare, with SUM13,300 per hectare assumed to be needed to cover part of \nthe O&M costs for the main and inter-farm systems. Regarding the farmers\u2019 capacity to meet \nthese future O&M costs, I&D fees were expressed as a percentage of the additional net farm \nreturns (before I&D fees) for both types of farm. Currently, the water users\u2019 association (WUAs) \nis charging only nominal fees, and this is assumed to continue in the \u201cwith project\u201d situation. As \nan indicator of farmers\u2019 capacity to pay, the general rule is that I&D fees (as a percentage of \nadditional net farm income before I&D fees) should not exceed 50%. The analysis suggests that \nfarmers might have the capacity, in theory, to meet O&M costs. However, this is not likely to be \nsufficient, given the substantial constraints private farmers face in the current \u201ccontrol and \ncommand\u201d farming environment. These constraints include restricted credit facilities, delayed \npayments, and lack of alternative marketing facilities, as well as procurement quotas and low \nfarm gate prices for cotton and wheat. The results of this analysis highlight the importance of \ncomplementing on-farm productivity improvements with policy reforms. \n \n5.  Impact of Policy Reforms \n16.  The analysis of the policy reform measures associated with the Project, using a policy \nanalysis matrix8 approach, indicates a positive impact on farmers and the Government. Four key \nindicators were used: (i) private profit and loss, (ii) economic profit and loss, (iii) domestic \nresource cost (DRC) ratio, and (iv) private resource cost (PRC) ratios.  \n                                                 \n8  See Harrigan et al. 1992.

Economic Analysis of Policy-Based Operations: Key \nDimensions. Manila. \n  \n \n ", "  Appendix 5  39   \n \n17.  The private (farmer) profits and losses reflect the results of the Land Improvement \nProject  (LIP)  farm  budget  analyses.  In  the  \u201cwithout  project\u201d  scenario,  private  profit  is  low \n(SUM103,000/ha), indicating that farmers do not have a strong incentive to expand or improve \nproductivity. This situation will deteriorate further without the project, and will likely generate \nlosses if costs that were not accounted for are included. This would make the introduction of \nland improvements even more difficult in the future. However, private profits would increase with \nthe relaxation of quotas, which would raise the prices farmers receive, and reallocation of \nresources to cotton. Combined with productivity improvements from drainage technology, this \nwould  enable  profits  to  improve  further.  For  example,  under  the  25%  quota  and  full  land \nimprovement  package,  private  profit  is  estimated  at  SUM478,000/ha  ($396/ha  equivalent). \nHigher private profits would increase the incentives for farmers to invest in land improvement, \nraising productivity and revenues further.  \n \n18.  The economic profit and losses also reflect the LIP farm budget analyses. The \u201cwithout \nproject\u201d  scenario  shows  a  higher  economic  return  compared  with  private  return \n(SUM217,000/ha or $195.50/ha). Still, this is marginally efficient in terms of its foreign exchange \nearning capacity. Quota relaxation would allow farmers to grow more cotton and receive prices \nthat  are  closer  to  economic  prices,  increasing  allocative  and  productive  efficiency.  Land \nimprovement technologies also increase economic efficiency: under the 25% quota and full land \nimprovement package economic profit is SUM717,000/ha or $594.03/ha.  \n \n19.   DRCs for cotton in the \u201cwithout project\u201d scenario and for all project options are below 1 \nand greater than 0, indicating that the project area has a comparative advantage in cotton.9 \nDRCs move closer to 0 with quota relaxation and with land improvement technology, again \nshowing greater efficiency under the 25% quota and full land improvement package option. \nCalculation of DRCs in financial terms, the PRC ratio, indicates low output prices and value \nadded compared with factor and other costs, and low competitive advantage of farmers. The \nresults of the summary policy analysis for selected LIP scenarios are in Table A5.3. \n \nTable A5.3: Effects of LIP Technologies and Quota Reductions \non Economic and Private Performance of Cotton \n \n      With  With  With  With \n  Present  Future  Project   Project   Project   Project \nIndicators  Situation  Without  Off-farm  Off-farm  Full   Full \nProject  Rehab.

Economically profitable enterprises \nhave a high value added in relation to domestic factor costs. DRCs greater than 1 show low comparative \nadvantage. DRCs between 0 and 1 show underlying comparative advantage.  \n   ", "40  Appendix 5   \n20.  The analysis also shows that an efficiency policy objective, rather than a food security \npolicy objective, would achieve greater financial profit and economic efficiency by growing more \ncotton and less wheat. Further, the Government and the economy would benefit from greater \nefficiency in foreign exchange earning capacity, raising the capacity to import, for example, food \nfrom countries with a comparative advantage in growing wheat. For the 25% quota reduction \nand land improvement in the LIP areas, wheat production was unchanged.  \n \n21.  The adoption of a 25% quota would increase the efficiency of the project areas to earn \nforeign exchange, reduce the need for subsidies, and increase Government revenues. The \nanalysis indicates that the 25% quota reduction would not compromise wheat production in LIP \nareas, and would increase cotton production by 15%.10 In addition, Government revenue would \nincrease  20%  due  to  the  sale  and  export  of  additional  cotton  production,  increased  tax \ncollection, and savings from lower subsidies. \n \n6.  Distribution and Poverty Impact  \n22.  The Project\u2019s impact on employment within the project area will be moderate (2%), due \nto  the  low  elasticity  of  workforce  demand  in  the  agriculture  sector.  However,  continued \ncommercialization should increase employment in household and dekhan plots. Employment is \nalso  expected  to  grow  (by  3\u20134%)  among  service  providers  for  agricultural  operators,  I&D \ninfrastructure  maintenance  enterprises,  and  related  segments  of  the  labor  market  (trading, \nservices, agricultural production processing, etc.). \n \n23.  The distribution of project effects among the main stakeholders\u2014cooperative farmers, \nprivate  farmers,  private  traders,  state  enterprises,  and  local  government  and  national \ngovernments\u2014also was analyzed qualitatively within the broader context of the agricultural \npolicy reforms.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Land Improvement Project (LIP) will require 131 person-months of international \nconsulting  services  and  857  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  to  assist  the \nMinistry  of  Agriculture  and  Water  Resources  (MAWR)  in  managing  and  implementing  the \nProject. The project will be implemented over 6 years, beginning in October 2006.  \n \nB.  Institutional Capacity Building  \n \n2.  The consultants will undertake a training needs assessment of all project stakeholders, \nand  will  provide  the  necessary  institutional  support  and  training  for  MAWR,  Government \nagencies, water users\u2019 association (WUA), and farmers. The consultants also will help identify \nappropriate  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  procedures  for  off-,  inter-,  and  on-farm \ninfrastructure,  and  assist  with  the  establishment  of  appropriate  budgetary  systems  and \nrepayment mechanisms by beneficiaries.  \n \nC.  Land and Water Management  \n3.  The consultants will arrange for detailed field surveys and investigations on the two \ndemonstration  farms.  Areas  requiring  remedial  works  will  be  identified,  and  necessary \ninterventions designed. The consultants also will identify the equipment and services needed for \nthe demonstration farms, assist with such procurement, and supervise implementation of the \nland improvement works. Further, the consultants will initiate farmer and WUA participatory \nactivities, and assist in the development of their overall capabilities. \n \nD.  Design, Procurement, and Construction Supervision \n \n4.  The consultants will arrange and supervise field investigations, and design and civil \nworks procurement; and will supervise feasibility studies, final designs, and bidding documents. \nThe consultants will assist with the procurement of works, goods, and services needed for the \ncivil works contracts.

Objectives and Scope \n \n1.  The  Government  of  Uzbekistan,  which  has  prioritized  addressing  land  degradation, \nasked Asian Development Bank (ADB) to finance the Land improvement Project (LIP). The \nProject  will  cover  nine  districts  in  Bukhara,  Kashkadarya,  and  Navoi  provinces,  which \nexperience the most adverse impacts of land degradation. The Project will improve farmers\u2019 \nlivelihood through higher yields, enhance land productivity, and increase incomes.  \n \n2.  The  Government  also  agreed  to  expand  and  deepen  the  reforms  outlined  in  the \nPresidential Decree of 24 March 2004, and to improve security of land tenure and farmers\u2019 \naccess to commercial credit in the project areas. However, during implementation of other ADB-\nfinanced  projects,  some  constraints  were  identified.  These  included  a  lack  of  (i)  common \nunderstanding  and  approach  to  policy  reforms  at  the  central  and  provincial  levels,  (ii) \ncollaborative/participatory policy reform review and evaluation measures, (iii) comprehensive \nmonitoring and evaluation mechanism, and (iv) key stakeholder awareness of the impact of \nreforms  on  their  farming  and  financial  operations.  Therefore,  technical  assistance  (TA)  is \nproposed to address these issues. \n \nB.  TA Impact, Outcome, Outputs, and Components   \n \n3.  To expand and deepen the reform process beyond the ongoing ADB-financed projects, \nthe implementation and outcomes of the reforms in the LIP areas must be monitored carefully, \nevaluated  and  discussed  among  all  key  stakeholders.  The  TA  will  (i)  facilitate  the \nimplementation of the reform package agreed under the Project; (ii) raise the awareness of local \ngovernment  and  rural  communities  regarding  the  implemented  reforms;  (iii)  monitor  their \nimpacts on Government revenues and expenditures, and on rural livelihood and poverty, in a \ntransparent  and  participatory  manner;  and  (iv)  propose  measures  for  improving  reform \neffectiveness.  \n \n4.  One impact of the TA will be accelerated agriculture sector reforms, as a result of the \nimplementation of the agreed reforms. Another impact will be widespread dissemination and \nsharing of reform knowledge, which can be replicated in wider geographical context within \nUzbekistan and in Central Asia. The TA outcome will be the acceptance of the participatory \nreform processes. The TA will have three components, each implemented as a separate phase \nof the TA.  \n \n5.  Phase  1:  Analysis  and  Design  of  Reform  Measures,  and  Dialogue  with  Key \nStakeholders and International Funding Agencies. The main tasks will include (i) developing \nmethods to measure progress of quota reduction at district and farm levels; (ii) designing \nmeasures to improve land use contracts in the project area\u2014and their use as collateral for bank \ncredit\u2014and a time-bound program for registration of these contracts; and (iii) assessing the \nliberalization of marketing of agricultural products. Following the initial review and analysis, the \nTA will establish an open and participatory forum to review and assess regularly the progress \nand impacts of reforms. This forum will involve national, provincial, and district governments; \nfarmers; and civil society. A dialogue with bilateral and multilateral agencies (World Bank, \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  European  Bank  of  Reconstruction  and  Development \n(EBRD), Department for International Development (DFID), etc.) will be initiated to ensure a \ncoordinated approach to agriculture sector reforms and poverty reduction. This will be followed \n  \n \n ", "Appendix 10  49\nby a joint assessment of (i) costs and benefits associated with each policy reform to key \nstakeholders, including national, local, and farmer communities; (ii) anticipated impact on the \nrural poor; and (iii) preparation of a timetable for implementation.  \n \n6.  Phase  2:  Implementation  of  Agreed  Policy  Reform  Agenda.  Assistance  will  be \nprovided to the central, provincial, and district governments to implement the agreed policy \nreform agenda on a sustainable basis. This will be carried out through stakeholder consultations \nat all levels, including poorer farmers and particularly female-headed farms. Consultation at the \nfarm  and  local  government  levels  will  receive  greater  emphasis  to  ascertain  the  desired \ngrassroots reform needs. A comparative analysis of the governance and institutions in the \nproject districts will be carried out, and assistance will be provided in capacity building of \nimplementing agencies to ensure a common interpretation of the policy reforms. The TA also \nwill support the Government in improving land registration legislation, as well as in drawing \nimplementation programs to ensure that reforms with immediate impact on poverty can be \nimplemented in an effective and timely manner.  \n \n7.  Phase  3: Monitoring  the  Impact  of  Reforms  and  Stakeholder  Consultation. To \nassess the impact of the project and policy reforms on farm incomes and poverty reduction, the \nfollowing tasks will be carried out: (i) establishment of a participatory system for monitoring and \nevaluation of the impact of policy reforms on poverty, which will involve consultation with key \nstakeholders,  civil  society,  and  elected  representatives;  (ii)  initial  monitoring  of  the \nimplementation of policy reforms and their impact on governance, Government revenues, farm \nprofitability,  and  poverty  reduction;1 and  (iii)    identification  of  nongovernment  organization \n(NGOs) or other independent agencies that could take over the monitoring process after TA \ncompletion. In particular, the TA will monitor (i) progress in terminating the involvement of local \nauthorities in farm operations, management, and marketing; (ii) registration of land use rights; \n(iii) impact of reforms on rural incomes; and (iv) proposals for expansion of reform initiatives \nbased on an assessment of the impact of implemented reforms.  \n \n8.  The TA outputs will include (i) agreed measures to reduce quotas, register land use \ncontracts, and liberalize agricultural markets in the project districts; (ii) implementation plan for \nreforms; and (iii) monitoring design, implementation plan, and reports. The TA will also design \nand carry out policy consultation campaigns, national and district workshops, emphasizing legal \nand financial aspects, as well as gender-related impacts,2 of the reform process. \n  \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n9.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, starting in October 2006. The Ministry of \nEconomy will be the TA Executing Agency. The TA consultants will work closely with the \nMinistry  of  Agriculture  and  Water  Resources  (MAWR)  and  other  key  stakeholders.  Other \nGovernment institutions that might participate in TA implementation include National Bank of \nUzbekistan, Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Justice. The consultants also will interact \nwith the ADB-financed Ak Altin Development Project3 and Amu Zhang Irrigation Rehabilitation \nProject4, as well as relevant ongoing projects of other international agencies (e.g., World Bank), \n                                                 \n1  Including collection and analysis of gender-disaggregated data. \n2  A project-specific gender action plan has been developed under LIP to promote the equal participation of male and \nfemale stakeholders in the Project. \n3  ADB. 2002.

Intensive consultations will \nbe conducted with civil society organizations and private sector organizations. \n \n10.  The TA will require 14 person-months of international consulting services and 36 person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consulting  services.  The  international  consultant  inputs  will  include  a \nmonitoring and evaluation specialist/team leader (6 person-months), an institutions specialist (3 \nperson-months), a social development specialist (3 person-months), and a credit specialist (2 \nperson-months). The domestic consultant inputs will comprise a monitoring and evaluation \nspecialist/deputy team leader (24 person-months), a legal specialist (3 person-months), a water \nusers\u2019 association (WUA) specialist (2 person-months), a credit specialist (3 person-months), a \ngender specialist (2 person-months), and a public awareness specialist (2 person-months). The \nrecruitment of the TA consultants will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. Simplified technical proposals and ADB's quality- and cost-based selection system \nwill be used to choose consultants.   \n  \nD.  Reporting \n11.  The consultants will submit an inception report 1 month after starting work on the TA. \nThe consultants also will submit a final report for phase I, bimonthly progress reports, and a \ncomprehensive draft final report at the end of the 10th month of phase III, followed by a final \nreport at the end of TA implementation. Each report, which will be published in English and \nRussian, will include a section on the Government\u2019s progress toward meeting loan covenants \nand policy reforms. All public consultation and dissemination materials will be published in \nEnglish, Russian, and Uzbek. \n  \nE.  Estimated Costs \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000 equivalent. ADB\u2019s TA funding program will \nprovide  a  grant  for  $200,000,  while  the  Poverty  Reduction  Cooperation  Fund  (PRF) \nadministered by ADB will finance $600,000. As phase 3 will be completed after the PRF cutoff \ndate of December 2007, it will be financed by the ADB TA funding program. The Government \nwill finance the remaining $200,000 by providing offices, logistical support, and counterpart staff. \nThe estimated breakdown of the costs is in Table A10.  \n \nF.  Description of Tasks \n \n1.  Phase 1: Analysis and Design of Reform Measures, and Dialogue with Key \nStakeholders and International Funding Agencies \n \n13.  The consultants will review Government policies that affect land tenure, freedom of \nfarming decisions, and incomes. As envisaged, the review will: \n(i)  Assess Government policy on cotton and wheat quotas. \n(ii)  Assess  the  level  of,  and  terms  and  conditions  for,  land  tenure  security  that \nfarmers might enjoy. \n(iii)  Compare farm gate prices for cotton and wheat with international prices. \n(iv)  Assess the availability of commercial sources of farm credit, and determine the \nextent of market liberalization for agricultural products. \n(v)  Identify and prioritize reforms, and assess their impact, through consultations at \nnational, provincial, and district levels, as well as with farmers. \n(vi)  Assess the benefits and costs associated with each policy reform. \n(vii)  Prioritize the agreed reforms, and prepare program for phased implementation. \n  \n \n ", "Appendix 10  51\n \n2.  Phase 2: Implementation of Agreed Policy Reform Agenda \n \n14.  The consultants will assist the Government in implementing the agreed policy reform \nagenda on a sustainable basis. To achieve this, the TA will \n(i)  Help the Government undertake stakeholder consultations on the reform agenda, \nat all levels, including farmers. Consultation at the farm and local government \nlevels will receive greater emphasis to ascertain the grassroots reform needs. \nBased on the stakeholders\u2019 feedback, necessary changes to the policies and \ntheir implementation will be proposed. \n(ii)  Support the Government in identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the \ninstitutions and agencies that will be involved in implementing the policy reforms. \n(iii)  Assist the Government in undertaking the required capacity building to enable \nimplementing agencies to understand how each policy should be implemented, \nand to ensure a common interpretation of the policy reforms. \n(iv)  Support the Government in drawing up relevant regulations and programs to \nensure the effective implementation of the proposed policy reforms. \n(v)  Assist in identifying the resources required to implement each policy initiative.   \n3.  Phase 3: Monitoring the Impacts of Policy Reform \n \n15.  The consultants will: \n \n(i)  Establish a system for monitoring and evaluating agreed policy reforms that \nconcentrates on the project districts, and involves participatory consultation with \nkey stakeholders, including civil society and elected representatives. The system \nmust  be  applicable  during  and  after  completion  of  the  TA.  Further,  the \nconsultants  will  examine  the  potential  of  selected  independent  agencies  for \nmonitoring after TA completion. \n(ii)  Monitor the implementation progress of policy reforms in the project districts, and \ntheir  impact  on  farm  productivity  and  profitability,  as  well  as  the  cost  and \navailability  of  inputs  and  private  machinery  services,  output  prices,  farmers\u2019 \nincentives, etc. In particular, the TA will monitor progress in (a) terminating the \ninvolvement of local authorities in farm operations, and the removal of remaining \nconstraints to the free marketing of cotton and wheat; (b) implementing measures \nto  improve  conditions  for  the  supply  of  inputs  by  the  private  sector;  and \n(c) improving land tenure contracts to enhance land use security, and to enable \nland use certificates to be used as collateral for bank credit. \n(iii)  Provide  feedback  on  compliance  with  other  policy  reform  agreements  with \nbilateral and multilateral agencies. \n(iv)  Carry out policy awareness campaigns, including the organization of training and \nworkshop/meetings, and the development of literacy material to disseminate the \npolicy reform agenda, TA findings, and recommendations.

Links to the Country Poverty Analysis \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national priority in   Yes  \npriority in country poverty analysis?       No  country poverty partnership agreement? a     No  \nContribution of the sector/subsector to poverty reduction in Uzbekistan: \nAgriculture accounted for about 29% of gross domestic product in 2000\u20132004 and about 25% of export earnings \n(IMF 2005), and provided 33% of the country's employment. About 15 million people, or 60% of the population of \n25.6 million, live in rural areas and depend solely on the agriculture sector for their livelihoods. Some 3 million \ndekhan farms (small inheritable households plots free in farms crop selection and marketing) grow agricultural \nproducts on small plots (from 0.15 to 0.35 hectare (ha)), thus contributing significantly to household budgets. Despite \nthe expected 15% decrease in agriculture sector employment from 2005 to 2010, agriculture will continue to be an \nessential sector of the national economy. It will absorb more than a fourth of the 300,000 young people who enter the \nlabor market annually. While Uzbekistan does not have an official definition of poverty, the Government has been \naddressing poverty-related issues in collaboration with international funding agencies. In 2003, two major studies \nwere carried  out: the World Bank-funded Living Standard Assessment (LSA); and the study  entitled  Linking \nMacroeconomic Growth Policy to Poverty Reduction, funded by United Nations Development Program (UNDP). \nThese studies formed the basis for the formulation of the Medium-Term Strategy for Improving the Living Standards \nof the People of Uzbekistan (SILSP), funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). They also contributed to the \nfinalization of the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) in June 2005. \n \nThe World Bank\u2019s LSA found the incidence of rural poverty in Uzbekistan was 30.5% in 2001. The percentage of \npoor households was 18.7% (Navoi oblast), 13.4% (Bukhara), and 62.6% (Kashkadarya). Data in the I-PRSP \nindicate that the average poverty incidence in Uzbekistan has decreased from 27.5% in 2001 to 26.2% in 2003. The \nSILSP and I-PRSP emphasize the critical role of agriculture in reducing poverty in rural areas, where 70% of the poor \nreside. These documents emphasize the need to address poverty by (i) increasing agricultural productivity, (ii) \nimproving irrigation and drainage (I&D) systems, (iii) developing a free market of commodities and agricultural input \nresources (fertilizers and machinery), (iv) developing water users\u2019 association (WUAs), and (v) implementing market \nreforms. Agricultural development is one of the Government\u2019s priorities. Planned reforms include the liberalization of \nthe agriculture sector by reducing Government-order target output of cotton and wheat, and transferring land to \nprivate farms. The I-PRSP provides for an increase of private farmers from 102,000 in 2004 to 151,000 in 2010, and \nfor restructuring 77% of agricultural land for private farmers (against 47% in 2004). By 2010, private farmers are \nexpected to contribute 26.6% of the country\u2019s agricultural output, compared with 17.3% in 2004 and 3.5% in 1998. \nThe I-PRSP emphasizes that the decrease in crop yields and crop areas resulting from land salinization and \ndegradation now affects about 50% of the irrigated land area, with an immediate impact on the living standards of the \npopulation. Land conditions continue to deteriorate in Uzbekistan. During the Soviet era and the time of collective \nfarms (shirkats), shirkat workers were not motivated to produce results from their work. Following independence, the \nfleet of tractors and other agricultural machinery decreased 40\u201370% between 1997 and 2003. Rehabilitation of \ndrainage networks has been limited, and construction of new drains has not materialized, due to a lack of \nGovernment funding for operation and maintenance (O&M), rehabilitation, and upgrading. \n \nThe relatively new Government policy of restructuring shirkat land into farmland managed by private/leasehold \nfarmers is improving farmers\u2019 motivation to enhance land management. However, thousands of new private farmers \nlack resources and machinery and equipment to undertake the necessary agricultural and land improvement tasks, \nbecause their crops are purchased under Government order at approximately 30% of world prices. This has \ndecreased the viable income of cotton farms. In the project area, about 85% of private farmers surveyed have saline \nland; 40% of private farmers have land affected by high groundwater table; and 20% of private farmers have low soil \nfertility. Land degradation has contributed to a decrease in all crop yields of almost 50%, which strongly influences \nhousehold income and poverty levels. \n \nThe legacy of the Soviet era centrally planned system and state procurement quotas also has affected the use of \njuvenile laborb Under pressure to meet state quotas, local officials order schools and universities closedc during the \ncotton harvest, and students are sent to work in the fieldsd Pupils are paid for their labor, though their actual wages \nafter deduction of costs (e.g., food and accommodation) are unclear. However, due to farm restructuring, the \nsituation is changing. Private farmers, who seek to reduce production costs, are hesitant to use inefficient juvenile \nlabor and pay for students\u2019 food and accommodation. Due to the agreed policy reforms (e.g., quota reductione and \nlimited intervention of local authorities in private farming) and rapid farm privatization, the use of juvenile labor in the \nproject areas is expected to be reduced greatly. Specific assurances regarding the use of juvenile labor in the project \narea are included in the legal documents. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  Targeting Classification:  General intervention \nThe population in the project districts is about 1,400,000. Based on the results of the sample survey of 1,800 \nhouseholds (April 2005), using consumption level as key poverty indicator, poverty incidence in the project area was \n37.3% (Kashkadarya), 28.3% (Navoi), and 27.3% (Jandor rayon of Bukhara oblast). The extreme poverty rate was \n ", "54   Appendix 11 \n \nabout 5%. As of March 2005, the poverty levels in monetary terms were $9.5 (Kashkadarya), $10.8 (Navoi), and \n$10.4 (Bukhara) per capita per month. During the same period, the minimum food basket price that ensures per \ncapita consumption at 1,500 kcal per day (extreme poverty line) was $6.3. \n \nIn March 2005, the Kashkadarya oblast\u2019s average household income was $87, and the average per capita income \nwas $13. The average total household income and average per capita income amounted to $100and $18 (Navoi) and \n$87 and $15 (Bukhara). The average per capita income of the poor households was 1.5\u20132 times lower than that of \nnon-poor households, i.e., $11 (Kashkadarya), $10.5 (Navoi), and $8.7 (Bukhara) per month. Day wage labor and \nsocial transfers (pensions and social benefits) are the main sources of income for low-income households. Pensions \nand social transfers as a percentage of the incomes of poor households is 23% (Kashkadarya), 35% (Navoi), and \n26% (Bukhara). Poor households spend more than 60% of their household income for foodstuffs, while the level of \nmeat consumption meets recommended standards in only 14% of households. The staple foods are carbohydrate-\ncontaining foodstuffs (flour, potato) and fats (vegetable oil). The number of poor households spending for education \nis 20% lower than that of the non-poor households. In monetary terms, poor households spend 50% less for \neducation than non-poor households. Poor households also spend 50% less income for medical treatment, and \nallocate only 5% of their total expenditures for medical treatment (compared with 10% for non-poor households). In \nmonetary terms, poor households spend three times less on medicines and doctors than non-poor households.  \n \nFor non-income poverty indicators, poor and non-poor households have limited access to municipal services, such as \nclean  potable  water  and  public  sanitary  facilities.  Access  to  piped  water  is  limited  to  12%  of  households \n(Kashkadarya), 28% (Navoi), and 2% (Bukhara). Many settlements have no medical clinics, or they are in such poor \nconditions and have such limited funding that they cannot operate effectively. Rural areas have few drugstores, with \nlimited choice of medicines and excessively high prices. Access to basic medical services has been identified as a \ncritical need for more than 25% households. The education level of poor households is close to the average \neducational level of the population. However, the percentage of members with a secondary, vocational, and/or higher \neducation is 1.2 to 1.5 times lower in poor households. The availability of agricultural land and the quality of that land \nare important factors in determining the well-being for households, given the lack of employment opportunities in rural \nareas. Direct and indirect benefits from agricultural ventures accounted for 70% of total household income in the \nproject area. Most of the poverty determinants, which are related to farming, are caused by low income in the \nagriculture sector. While low income is explained largely by increased land deterioration and decreasing yields, the \nlack of skills and resources among farmers and agricultural workers also contributes to low income levels. \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes              No  \nDuring preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) consultations and loan fact-finding, a broad range of stakeholders \nwere identified and consulted at central and local government levels, including grassroots consultations with local \ncommunities in the project area. During the preparation of the Poverty, Social and Gender Analysis (May 2005), a \nsample survey was carried out with 1,800 households. This provided an opportunity to inform the stakeholders about \nthe Project\u2019s outcome and impact. In addition, 40 in-depth interviews were organized with experts, private farmers, \nand local self-governance bodies. Four rural participatory rapid assessments were carried out, and included group \ndiscussions with the general public and experts to identify key social problems and discuss issues related to living \nstandards, employment, and income generation. When the data was collected and analyzed, the specific needs and \nconstraints faced by women and other vulnerable groups were emphasized. The agro-economic study in the project \narea provided additional performance analyses and needs assessments of 80 private farms, 80 dehkan farms, and \n10 shirkat farms. Key project stakeholders are poor and non-poor agricultural operators, women, agricultural workers, \nagricultural input suppliers, agricultural service providers, financial institutions for agriculture, construction companies, \ncentral and local authorities, and land and water resource management institutions. Key vulnerable groups in the \nproject area include women, the unemployed (mostly people who lost their jobs as a result of the restructuring of \nshirkats into private farms), and families with household land plots. \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No  \nThe project-specific participation plan (Appendix 12) aims to involve all stakeholders in the implementation of the \nLand Improvement Project (LIP), and in any consultative and/or participatory process aimed at assessing the \nProject\u2019s impact on poverty reduction. The stakeholders include Government authorities at central and oblast level; \noblast agricultural and water management agencies; river irrigation system management agencies (RISMA); research \nand development institutes; civil society organizations, including WUAs and nongovernment organization (NGOs); \nand project beneficiaries (shirkat farms, private farms, and dehkan farms). Participation will be encouraged by \nemphasizing consultation, sharing information, empowerment and/or shared control, collaboration and/or shared \ndecision making, and negotiations during project implementation. Participation methods will include workshops and \nmeetings, as well as qualitative and quantitative surveys (projects outset and project completion). To expand and \ndeepen  the  reform  process  beyond  the  LIP,  a  technical  assistance  (TA)  (Appendix  10)  will  (i)  facilitate  the \nimplementation of the reform package agreed under the LIP project, (ii) raise the awareness of local government and \nrural communities regarding the implemented reforms, (iii) monitor the impacts on Government revenue and on rural \nlivelihood and poverty in a transparent and participatory manner, and (iv) propose measures for improving reform \neffectiveness.  \n \n  \n \n ", "Appendix 11  55\n \nD.  Gender Development \nIn Uzbekistan, women\u2019s contribution to the country\u2019s economy is important. The labor force participation rate is estimated \nat 60% among men and 31% among women. These estimates do not include those doing unpaid work in the family or on \nsmall subsistence plots. In 2005, the proportion of women among the officially unemployed was 61.5%, compared to \n38.5% for men. The average duration of job searches is higher among women than among men. As a result, 67.7% of \nthose unemployed for more than 1 year are women. In urban areas, employed women are concentrated within low-\nincome sectors of the national economy, mostly state-funded and/or low-skill jobs. In agriculture, women tend to do low-\nproductivity manual work, such as cotton picking. This type of work is also often seasonal. Women with young children \nare much less likely to participate in the labor force, or are more likely to have their employment choice limited to \nhousehold  production  activities  (small  plots).  Women\u2019s  opportunities  to  participate  are  limited  due  to  the  limited \navailability of child care facilities. Furthermore, women traditionally are responsible for household tasks and children. The \ntraditional gender division of labor results in women\u2019s wages averaging 70% of men\u2019s wages. This continues to worsen, \nas the percentage of young women seeking professional degrees is decreasing and limited to traditional disciplines, a \npractice that exposes them to the risks of unemployment and/or accepting low-paid jobs. In rural areas, the shift from \ncollective farms to joint stock shareholding companies (shirkats) has resulted in labor retrenchment, which has affected \nwomen significantly. The liquidation of collective farms in favor of private farms organized as farmers\u2019 associations \n(PDFA) and/or WUA has consolidated farm management as a male occupation. Women\u2019s claim to private farms is \nlimited. The available data suggests that women represent only 4.8% of private farmers. Farm management appears to \nhave become a male occupation. This implies that women are being excluded from key employment opportunities in the \nrestructuring process, as well as from positions of authority that could help empower them in local communities. Their \nlow representation among private farmers seems likely to be due partly to their lack of appropriate agricultural and \nbusiness skills, and also to cultural stereotypes that are particularly strong in rural areas. Lack of influence over decisions \nregarding the distribution of land also might mean that women get poorer quality plots. While the actual labor input of \nwomen into farming activities in cotton production, on private subsidiary plots, and household plots remains extremely \nhigh, they are increasingly incorporated into the workforce as unpaid laborers or as casual laborers earning piece-wage \nrates. In addition, decreased access to municipal services and potable water affects the status of rural women farmers. \nDuring project preparation, a detailed poverty, social, and gender analysis was carried out. Key findings of the gender \nanalysis and follow-up discussions during loan fact-finding confirmed women's increasing exclusion from the benefits and \nopportunities derived from the ongoing farm privatization process. Based on LIP\u2019s potential gender impact, a project-\nspecific Gender Action Plan (GAP) has been developed (Appendix 13) to promote the equal participation of male and \nfemale stakeholders as agents and beneficiaries of the Project. Proposed activities aim to (i) establish quotas for \nwomen's representation within decision-making processes and structures of model farms and WUAs, (ii) integrate \nwomen's needs and constraints in the design and operation of project infrastructure, (iii) establish quotas for rural women \nfarmers' participation in training activities, and (iv) ensure women's effective involvement in the monitoring and evaluation \nof project impacts. The Women\u2019s Committee, which will be represented in the project management office (PMO), will be \nresponsible for implementing gender design features, as well as monitoring gender-relevant targets and indicators, in \ncollaboration with the Association of Women's NGOs. The GAP is consistent with the National Platform of Action on \nImproving Women\u2019s Status, adopted in 1998, and the Presidential  Decree entitled \u201cOn additional measures to support \nthe activity of Women\u2019s Committee of Uzbekistan\u201d, adopted in 2004. \nHas an output been prepared?

Work must \nnot interfere with the studies of those under 18.
