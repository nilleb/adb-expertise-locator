This  region  has  natural  resources  and  is\nknown  for  its  scenic  landscape  and  historical  sites.  Poor  accessibility\nand  lack  of  economic  transport  have  limited  the  development  of  these\nless  developed  with\nresources  and \nconsiderable  poverty.  The  poverty  incidence  is  21  percent  compared\nwith  12  percent  in  the  PRC  as  a  whole.  The  main  cause  of  poverty  is\ninsufficient opportunity for earning income. Transport capability needs to\nbe developed to catalyze economic activity, and create employment and\nincome-generating  activities.  The  Project  will  provide  efficient  and  low-\ncost  transportation  for  passengers  and  goods,  which  will  increase  the\ndevelopment of natural resources and industry bringing more income to\nthe  local  community  and  thus  help  reduce  poverty.

These\ndevelopment  of  natural \ndevelopments  will  create  new  employment  and  income-generating\nopportunities  that  will  benefit  people  in  general,  and  the  poor  in\nparticular. The project design incorporates special measures for passing\non  the  Project\u2019s  benefits  to  the  poor.  During  the  five-year  project\nconstruction period, a total of 110,000 person-years of employment will\nbe  created,  of  which  47,500  person-years  will  be  provided  to  poor\nhouseholds. Economic activities induced by the railway are expected to\ncreate  20,100  person-years  of  employment  in  2007,  increasing  to\n60,000 person-years in 2026. About 40 percent of the new employment\nis  expected  to  go  to  poor  people.  The  resulting  increase  in  income  will\nimprove  living  standards  and  decrease  the  number  of  people  living\nbelow the poverty line. Distribution analysis shows that 26 percent of the\nproject benefits will go to the poor. Quantifiable benefits from the Project\ninclude  transport  cost  savings  for  diverted  traffic  that  will  accrue  to\nowners of freight and passengers. The economic internal rate of return\nis  estimated  at  14.4  percent  and  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  at\n6.4 percent.\n\n\fv\n\fv\ni\n\fI submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed loan\n\n1.\nto the People's Republic of China (PRC) for the Ganzhou-Longyan Railway (GLR) Project.\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nExperience with completed railways1 in the PRC financed by the Asian Development Bank\n2.\n(ADB),  i.e.,  Shanxi-Xiaoliu  Railway,  Yaogu-Maoming  Railway,  Guang-Mei-Shan  Railway,  Hefei-\nJiujiang  Railway,  and  Jing-Jiu  Railway,  and  the  ongoing  railway  projects2  shows  that  the\nconstruction  and  operation  of  railways  can  contribute  significantly  to  stimulating  economic\ndevelopment  in  relatively  poor  areas.  These  projects,  together  with  the  developments  and\nactivities  induced  by  the  lower  cost  of  transport  are  catalyzing  rapid  economic  growth,\ntransforming  local  economies,  enhancing  the  investment  environment  in  the  project  areas,\nenabling access to wider markets and better prices for local products, and generating large-scale\nemployment for local people. Consequently, these projects have significant impacts on improving\nthe incomes and living standards of people in general and reducing poverty in particular.\n\n3.\nThe  proposed  Project  involves  the  construction  of  a  new  railway  from  Ganzhou  to\nLongyan, traversing eight counties in two prefectures, one each in western Fujian and southern\nJiangxi provinces (maps 1 and 2). It will link the poor and underdeveloped project area with other\nmore prosperous parts of the PRC. The eight counties have a population of 4.1 million, of which\n3.4 million people, or 83 percent, live in rural areas. In 2000, the incidence of rural poverty based\non rural per capita income of Y1,000 per year was 21 percent compared with 12 percent for the\nPRC as a whole. In terms of poverty classification, the Project has been categorized as Other.3\nThe  Project  supports  the  thematic  priority  of  economic  growth.  The  improved  accessibility  and\nlower  transportation  costs  made  possible  by  the  GLR  will  accelerate  economic  growth  by\ndeveloping industries, and natural and agricultural resources. New employment opportunities and\nincome-generating activities will be created that will raise incomes and improve living standards\nbenefiting  the  people,  particularly  the  poor.  The  Project  has  been  designed  to  enhance  its  pro-\npoor  features.  Without  the  Project,  transport  constraints  would  continue  and  the  sustained\neconomic growth necessary to reduce poverty would not take place.\n\n4.\nDuring the 2001 Country Programming Mission, the Government reconfirmed its request\nfor ADB assistance for the Project. A feasibility study4 and an environmental impact assessment\n(EIA)5  were  prepared  by  the  Fourth  Survey  and  Design  Institute  of  the  Ministry  of  Railways\n(MOR).  MOR  prepared  a  resettlement  plan  (RP).  ADB  provided  technical  assistance  (TA)6  to\nsupplement  the  Government  studies,  including  the  RP.  In  addition  to  TA  supervision  missions,\n\n                  \n\n1 The completed railway projects include Loan 948-PRC: Shanxi-Xiaoliu Railway Project, for $39.7 million, approved\non  31  January  1989;  Loan  1087-PRC:Yaogu-Maoming Railway Project,  for  $67.5  million,  approved  on  20  June\n1991; Loan 1167-PRC:Guang-Mei-Shan Railway Project, for $200 million, approved on 25 June 1992; Loan 1221-\nPRC: Hefei Jiujiang Railway Project, for $110 million, approved on 30 March 1993; and Loan 1305-PRC:Jing-Jiu\nRailway Technical Enhancement Project, for $200 million, approved on 14 July 1994.\n\n2  The ongoing railway projects include Loan 1439-PRC: Daxian-Wanxian Railway Project, for $100 million, approved\non 4 June 1996; Loan 1553-PRC: Shenmu-Yan'an Railway Project, for $200 million, approved on 29 September\n1997; Loan 1626-PRC: Guizhou-Shuibai Railway Project, for $140 million, approved on 18 August 1998; and Loan\n1748-PRC: Hefei-Xi'an Railway Project, for $300 million, approved on 17 August 2000.\n3  This classification is used in view of the non-excludable nature of the project benefits.\n4 The feasibility study was approved by the PRC\u2019s State Development Planning Commission in August 2001.\n5  The EIA was approved by the State Environmental Protection Administration on 21 May 2001.\n6  TA 3486-PRC: Ganzhou-Longyan Railway Project, for $665,000, approved on 30 August 2000 (completed).\n\n\f2\n\nADB missions7 visited the PRC from 27 February to 16 March 2001 (fact-finding) and from 10-26\nMay  2001  (appraisal).  Loan  negotiations  were  conducted  in  PRC  from  27-29  August  2001  with\nauthorized representatives of the Government. Formulation of the Project is based on the findings\nof  the  ADB  missions,  information  provided  by  the  Government,  beneficiary  consultations,\ndiscussions  with  other  funding  agencies,  and  recommendations  of  the  feasibility  study  and  TA\nconsultants. A project framework that outlines the goal, purpose, outputs, and inputs or activities is\nin Appendix 1.\n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA. \n\nSector Description\n\n1. \n\nTransport\n\n5.\nInfrastructure  and  Traffic.  The  implementation  of  the  Government's  economic  reform\npolicies since 1978 has resulted in rapid growth of the PRC economy, and a sharp increase in the\ndemand  for  transportation  services.  Despite  the  Government's  efforts  to  increase  transport\ncapacity, serious constraints and bottlenecks remain. The land transport system comprises about\n68,000 route-kilometers (km) of railways, 1.35 million km of highways, and 116,100 km of inland\nwaterways. In addition, there are 1.5 million km of civil aviation routes. The density of the transport\nnetwork  ranks  among  the  lowest  in  the  world  relative  to  either  population  or  geographic  area.8\nAlthough  infrastructure  networks  expanded  rapidly  in  the  past  decade,  they  have  not  kept  pace\nwith  the  demand  generated  by  the  country's  economic  growth.  Inadequate  transportation  is  a\nconstraint to the sustained efficient growth of the PRC economy.\n\n6.\nBetween 1985 and 2000, all modes of freight transport grew from 1,837 billion to 4,366\nbillion  ton-kilometer  (ton-km)  or  at  5.9  percent  per  annum.  In  2000,  the  modal  split  for  freight\ntransport (in ton-km) was (i) coastal and inland waterways 54 percent, (ii) railways 31.9 percent,\n(iii)  roads  14  percent,  and  (iv)  civil  aviation  0.1  percent.  Railway  freight  traffic  increased  from\n813 billion ton-km in 1985 to 1,257 billion ton-km in 1999 and 1,334 billion ton-km in 2000, or an\nannual  increase  of  3.4  percent,  with  a  6.1  percent  increase  in  2000  compared  with  1999.\nRailway  passenger  traffic  increased  from  242  billion  passenger-km  in  1985  to  406  billion\npassenger-km  in  1999  and  441  billion  passenger-km  in  2000,  or  an  annual  increase  of  4.1\npercent,  with  an  8.5  percent  increase  in  2000  compared  with  1999.  In  2000  road  traffic\naccounted for 54.1 percent of total passenger-km, railways for 36.8 percent, civil aviation for 8.2\npercent,  and  coastal  and  inland  waterways  for  0.9  percent.  The  railway's  share  of  the  total\nfreight  and  passenger  traffic  moved  by  all  transport  modes  declined  during  1985-1999;  the\nshare increased in 2000.\n\n7.\nInvestments. Transport in the PRC lags behind the rapidly developing economy, which\ndepends on the efficient transportation of goods and passengers for growth and sustainability.\nInadequate investment in transport up to the early 1990s resulted in transportation inefficiencies\nthat  severely  constrained  the  growth  of  the  national  economy.  To  address  this  situation  the\nGovernment substantially increased investment in transport infrastructure in the Ninth Five-Year\nPlan  (FYP)  (1996-2000).  Investment  in  transport  infrastructure  as  a  percent  of  gross  domestic\n\n                  \n\n7  The missions comprised R. Soin, Senior Project Engineer and Mission Leader; H. Sakurai, Financial Analyst; Hong\nWei, Senior Financial Economist, PRC Resident Mission; S. Price, Senior Social Development Specialist; D. Tang,\nEnvironment  Specialist;  and  X.  Peng,  Senior  Counsel.  F.  Agnello,  Poverty  Reduction  Specialist,  and  S.  Curry,  Sr.\nProject Economist, assisted the Mission at headquarters.\nIn terms of density per square km of land area, the PRC's transport network is one sixth of India's network and one\nfifth that of the Republic of Korea.\n\n8\n\n\f3\n\nproduct (GDP) more than doubled from 0.8 percent in 1990 to 1.9 percent in 1999. To meet the\nincrease in transport demand, more infrastructure investments are needed. A World Bank study9\nindicates that total transport investment should be increased to at least 3 percent of GDP to avoid\nthe economic costs associated with transport constraints. The Government has accorded priority\nto  transport  in  the  Tenth  FYP  (2001-2005).  Substantial  investments  in  the  railway  and  road\nsectors are envisaged. The Government realizes that to sustain large investments an increasing\nproportion  of  financing  will  have  to  come  from  both  domestic  and  international  private  sector\nsources.10\n\n8.\nInstitutions.  At  the  national  level,  the  State  Development  Planning  Commission\nformulates  the  five-year  development  plans,  and  establishes  transport  priorities  and  targets  in\nconsultation  with  the  administrative  units  responsible  for  the  various  transport  sectors,  and\nrepresentatives of transport users. MOR administers the national railway system; the Ministry of\nCommunications, national highways, inland waterways, coastal shipping, and major ports; and the\nCivil Aviation Administration, air transport and airports.\n\n2. \n\nRailway\n\nThe 68,000 route-km railway system11 in the PRC comprises 58,000 route-km of the state-\n9.\nowned national railway and 10,000 route-km of local railways.12 Under the administrative control of\nMOR  the  national  railway  is  operated  by  14  railway  administrations.13  The  1990  Railway  Law\nprovides the framework for the regulation and operation of railways in the PRC.14 Given the vast\ndistances  between  locations  of  industry  and  natural  resources,  as  well  as  the  socioeconomic\ndifferences between the PRC's inland and coastal regions, the current dimensions of the railway\nnetwork do not provide adequate geographic coverage.15\n\n10.\nThe  railway  system  remains  the  preferred  mode  of  medium-  to  long-distance  intercity\ntransport.  This,  combined  with  economic  growth  and  technological  improvements  for  the\nrailways, ensures a continuing role for railway transport in the future. The railway's competitive\nadvantage is in the transport of bulk and semibulk commodities over medium to long distances,\nlong-distance  passenger  traffic,  and  containerized  freight.  In  2000,  the  national  railway\ntransported  almost  the  same  amount  of  freight  traffic  and  more  than  16  times  the  volume  of\npassenger  traffic  as  all  the  railway  lines  in  the  United  States  (US)  combined,  including\ncommuter lines.\n\n11.\nAs the PRC moves toward a more dynamic, decentralized, and market-driven economy,\nand  in  the  light  of  increasing  competition  from  the  expanding  road  network,  structural  reforms\n\n                  \n\n9 World  Bank.  1995.

The law also specifies the rights and obligations of the Government, MOR, local governments, other\nrailway operators, shippers, and railway users.\n\n15 Railway network density in terms of route-km per square km of land area is one third that of India and one tenth\n\nthat of Japan.\n\n\f4\n\ntouching all aspects of railway operation and management are being implemented (beginning in\nthe 1980s) to modernize and improve the efficiency of the railway system. Major reforms were\npreceded  by  extensive  studies  and  pilot  programs.  Considering  the  size  and  spread  of  the\nrailway and its critical importance to the PRC\u2019s economy, the reforms were carefully sequenced\nand  designed  to  suit  local  conditions.  A  summary  of  the  railway  sector  reforms  is  given  in\nAppendix 2.\n\n12.\nThe  first  important  reform  initiative  was  the  productivity  contract  system  introduced  in\n1986.  However,  productivity  targets  alone  are  not  sufficient  to  operate  profitably  in  a  market\nenvironment.  After  a  series  of  pilot  studies  on  management  methods,  in  1999,  the  assets\noperation liability system was introduced for the national railway. Under this system, MOR entered\ninto  management  contracts  with  the  railway  administrations  to  improve  profitability.16  The\nmanagement  contracts  have  helped  improve  the  operational  and  financial  performance  of  the\nrailway  administrations17  and  the  national  railway  as  a  whole.  In  1999,  the  national  railway\ntransported a total of 1,662 billion converted ton-km, an increase of 4.2 percent over 1998, and\n1,775  billion  converted  ton-km  in  2000,  an  increase  of  6.8  percent  over  1999.  The  safety  of\noperation of the railway network also improved during 1999-2000 compared with previous years.18\nIn  the  drive  to  improve  profitability,  MOR  has  divested  its  construction  enterprises;  production\nfacilities for locomotives, passenger coaches, freight wagons, and signaling and communications\nequipment; and 11 captive educational universities.19\n\n13.\nTo  improve  productivity  and  efficiency,  operation  and  maintenance  is  being  modernized,\nwith  over  97  percent  of  the  needed  traction  power  provided  by  modern  electric  and  diesel\nlocomotives. Commercialization is progressing steadily, and excess transportation staff, a legacy\nof the past, are being reduced.20 To provide employment for redundant employees, MOR helped\nset  up  diversified  businesses  (independent  of  the  core  transportation  business)  to  supply\nequipment, goods, and services to the railway industry.21 Several measures have been taken to\nimprove    management    information    systems,    including  a  point-to-point  costing  system,22  a\nrevised revenue  settlement  system23  and  a  transportation  management  information  system\n\n                  \n\n16 Under  the  assets  operation  liability  system  the  performance  of  railway  administrations  is  evaluated  by  using\nagreed  targets  for  simultaneously  improving  profitability,  maintaining  and  increasing  fixed  assets,  and  ensuring\nsafety of operation.\n\n17 For  example  the  two  project  implementing  agencies,  the  Nanchang  Railway  Administration  increased  operating\nprofit  from  Y62  million  in  1998  to  Y400  million  in  1999  and  Y480  million  in  2000;  while  the  Shanghai  Railway\nAdministration earned a profit of Y140 million in 2000 compared with a loss of Y205 million in 1998 and a loss of\nY153 million in 1999.\n\n18 The  incidence  of  accidents  per  million  locomotive-km  in  1999-2000  was  21  percent  less  than  that  during  1996-\n\n1998, and 41 percent less during 1991-1995.\n\n19 In  September  2000,  MOR  divested  the  following  six  large  nontransportation  entities,  along  with  the  associated\ndebt:  (i)  South  Locomotives  and  Rolling  Stock  Industries  Corporation,  (ii)  North  Locomotives  and  Rolling  Stock\nIndustries  Corporation  (iii)  China  Railway  Telecom  and  Signaling  Corporation,  (iv)  China  Railway  Construction\nCorporation, (v) China Railway Engineering Corporation, and (vi) China Civil Engineering (Group) Corporation.\n20 The  number  of  employees  employed  by  MOR  decreased  from  1.93  million  in  1996  to  1.49  million  in  2000.\nCorrespondingly,  productivity  in  terms  of  converted  ton-km  per  employee  increased  from  0.84  million  in  1996  to\n1.19 million in 2000, an increase of 9 percent per year.\n\n21 These enterprises have provided alternative employment to 0.4 million surplus employees of the national railway.\nIn 1999, the total revenue of these companies was Y36 billion with annual profits of Y2.6 billion. This program is an\neffective and socially acceptable approach for reducing staffing levels.\n\n22 A point-to-point costing system covering 1,200 locations systemwide will be operationalized in 2002. This system\n\ncan evaluate the costs and profitability of individual traffic movements.\n\n23 The  existing  revenue  settlement  system  will  be  improved  by  helping  railway  administrations  evaluate  interline\n\nrevenue taking account of the commodity carried and the tariff rate.\n\n\f5\n\n(TMIS).24 Since 1999, various restructuring measures have been taken to improve productivity\nand  reduce  operating  losses  on  120  branch  lines  that  comprise  about  7,800  km  (or  13.4\npercent)  of  the  national  network.25  Consistent  with  the  global  trend  for  multimodal  transport,\ncontainer traffic is a key area for development. Since the mid-1990s container traffic has been\nincreasing by more than 10 percent per year, more than three times the growth rate for freight\ntraffic.26  These  measures  will  improve  service  quality,  asset  utilization  and  productivity,  and\nfinancial performance of the national railway, and help focus on more profitable traffic.\n\nThe  Government,  through  the  State  Council,  regulates  tariff  charges  on  the  national\n14.\nrailway.  The  Government  is  cautious  when  considering  tariff  increases  because  of  the  adverse\nimpact on inflation, which has economywide implications. During 1967-1982, tariff rates remained\nunchanged. Since 1983, tariff rates and structures have changed significantly. From Y0.0148 per\nton-km  in  1983,  the  nominal  freight  tariff  increased  to  Y0.0791  per  ton-km  in  July  2000,  an\naverage annual increase of 10.4 percent, which compares with the average annual inflation rate of\n8.4 percent during the same period. The freight tariff includes increases in basic freight tariff and\nsurcharges  to  generate  resources  for  railway  development.  In  March  1990,  a  construction\nsurcharge was added to most commodity freight tariffs, the proceeds of which are credited to a\nseparate  railway  construction  fund  (RCF)  account  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance.27  The  RCF  is\nmainly used for railway construction.28 In April 1993, the Government approved the policy of \"new\nline,  new  tariff\"  to  generate  revenue  for  cost  recovery  and  service  debt  incurred  to  finance  the\nconstruction of new lines. 29 In the same year an electrification surcharge30 was levied on all traffic\nmoving  on  electrified  lines  to  raise  capital  for  electrification.  In  1999,  a  new  commodity-based\nfreight tariff structure and additional charges for freight loading and unloading were introduced.\n\nThe basic passenger tariff per passenger-km was raised in stages from Y0.017 in 1985\n15.\nto Y0.0586 in 2000, or an average annual increase of 8.6 percent. Since 1992, additional fares\nare  being  charged  to  passengers  availing  of  premium  and  value-added  services.31  The\nexpansion of such services to meet demand increased the revenue collection from passenger\nservices.  On  a  passenger-km  basis  the  ratio  of  actual  revenue  to  basic  tariff  increased  from\n\n                  \n\n24 Following  successful  trials  on  the  Shanghai  Railway  Administration,  installation  of  the  TMIS  on  the  national\nnetwork was completed in 2000. Similar management information tools have been successfully used for railways\nin  the  US  and  Canada.  Significantly,  the  TMIS  has  been  connected  to  the  Internet  enabling  shippers  to  monitor\nshipments  and  passengers  to  access  train  schedules  on-line.  The  TMIS  will  improve  the  quality  of  services  and\nensure  more  efficient  utilization  of  assets.  Under  the  Project,  the  TMIS  will  be  extended  to  cover  the  project\nfacilities.\n\n25 The measures taken include restructuring of branch lines into separate/independent entities or joint ventures with\nprovincial  governments  and  close  monitoring  of  their  operational  performance.  As  a  result  of  these  measures,\nrevenue on branch lines increased from Y7.5 billion in 1999 to Y8.45 billion in 2000, an increase of 12.6 percent,\nand  operating  losses  on  branch  lines  decreased  from  Y1,139  million  in  1999  to  Y915  million  in  2000,  a  fall  of  6\npercent.\n\n26 In  2000,  container  traffic  was  2.6  percent  of  total  freight  traffic.  To  meet  demand  for  container  traffic  MOR  is\n\nplanning to set up 250 container stations on the national network during the Tenth FYP (2001-2005).\n\n27 From Y0.003 per ton-km in March 1990, the construction surcharge increased in stages to Y0.033 per ton-km in\n1999.  Fertilizers  and  yellow  phosphate  are  exempt  from  the  construction  surcharge,  and  a  lower  surcharge  is\napplied  to  rock  phosphate  and  cotton,  Y0.0224  per  ton-km,  and  pesticides,  Y0.0192  per  ton-km.  In  2000,  Y37.1\nbillion was credited to the RCF.\n\n28 Since 1993, the RCF has also been used to pay interest on debt incurred for capital investments.\n29 ADB helped MOR to carry out a tariff study to determine a special higher tariff for the Jing-Jiu  Railway  under  TA\n\n2122-PRC: Policy Support to the Ministry of Railways, for $600,000, approved on 14 July 1994 (completed).\n\n30 The electrification surcharge increased from Y0.004 per ton-km in April 1993 to Y0.012 in February 1999.\n31 The fare for (i) an airconditioned seat is 50 percent more than for nonairconditioned; (ii) express trains is about 50\npercent more than standard trains, (iii) a soft seat is about 70 percent more than a hard seat; and (iv) sleeper seat\nis 75 percent more than a sitting seat. During the peak holiday season up to a 30 percent premium is charged on\nsome trains.\n\n\f6\n\n1.218  in  1996  to  1.422  in  2000,  reflecting  increased  demand  for  improved  value-added\npassenger transportation services.\n\n16.\nIn spite of the general and selective tariff increases, the current tariffs of Y0.0791 per ton-\nkm and Y0.0586 per passenger-km are still low by comparison with other transport modes in the\nPRC and by world standards. The selective tariff increases helped augment revenue, but they did\nnot compensate for the phase-out of subsidies on material and energy inputs in the early 1990s,\nwhich  adversely  affected  the  profitability  of  the  national  railway.  However,  between  1996  and\n2000,  unit  revenues  from  both  freight  and  passenger  services  increased  more  than  the  unit\noperating costs, which improved the financial performance of the national railway.\n\nB. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n17.\nThe lack of railway capacity to meet the increasing demand for transportation services is\nconstraining economic growth. The Government\u2019s plan for railway development gives priority to\n(i)  expanding  the  railway  network  by  constructing  new  railway  lines  to  provide  economic\ntransportation  and  catalyze  growth  in  poor  inland  regions;  (ii)  encouraging  the  construction  of\njoint  venture  railways  to  develop  local  economies;  (iii)  improving  the  efficiency  of  the  existing\nsystem by using new technology and modern management tools; (iv) increasing cost recovery by\ncommercializing  services  and  adopting  appropriate  pricing  policies;  (v)  improving  efficiency\nthrough institutional and structural reforms; and (vi) encouraging nongovernment investment32 in\ninfrastructure and related services.\n\n18.\nThe Tenth FYP, covering 2001-2005, envisages (i) constructing 6,000 km of new lines to\nprovide access to unserved areas with the network length reaching a total of 74,000 route-km;\n(ii)  providing  3,000  km  of  double  lines  and  electrifying  5,000  km  of  key  lines  to  increase\ncapacity;  and  (iii)  increasing  operating  speeds  on  5,000  km  with  the  total  length  of  such  lines\nreaching  15,000  km.  The  Tenth  FYP  envisages  a  total  outlay  of  Y350  billion  for  railway\ndevelopment, consisting of Y270 billion for capital construction33 and Y80 billion for rolling stock.\nAbout  one  third  of  this  investment  will  be  internally  generated;  the  remaining  will  be  arranged\nfrom domestic markets and foreign sources.\n\nC. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n19.\nJapan provides largest amount of external financing for the railway sector, followed by the\nWorld  Bank  and  ADB  (Appendix  3).  Japan  and  the  World  Bank  have  been  mainly  involved  in\nexpanding the capacity of the national railway. In the past 20 years, Japan34 has provided \u00a5558\nbillion for 15 railway projects to expand rail transport capacity, particularly in major coal transport\ncorridors.  Japan  has  also  financed  the  development  of  new  sections  of  the  national  railway\nnetwork in inland provinces. Since 1984, the World Bank has provided loans totaling $2.2 billion\nfor seven national railway projects and one local railway project.\n\n20.\nADB  has  focused  on  railway  development  in  less-developed  and  poor  regions  to\npromote sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty. Since 1989, ADB has provided nine\nloans totaling about $1.4 billion to help finance the construction of 1,754 km of new railway lines\nunder seven local railway projects, and 3,484 km of new railway lines under two national railway\n\n                  \n\n32 The Guangshen Railway Company, operating between Guangzhou and Shenzhen, raised $200 million through a\n\nworldwide offering of shares to finance investments.\n\n33 During the Ninth FYP (1996-2000) the actual investment for railway capital construction totaled Y250 billion.\n34 Financing from Japan was initially sourced from the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund, which was merged on\n\n1 October 1999 with the Export-Import Bank of Japan to form the Japan Bank for International Cooperation.\n\n\f7\n\nprojects.  These  projects  have  financed  the  construction  of  railway  lines  in  less-developed  and\npoor  areas,  introduced  modern  technology,  and  improved  the  efficiency  of  railway  operation\nthrough  institutional  and  structural  reforms.  ADB  has  promoted  the  commercial  operation  of\nrailways to achieve full cost recovery and has helped improve the management of railways by\nenhancing  their  knowledge  of  (i)  commercial  operation,  traffic  costing,  and  pricing;  (ii)  market-\noriented  business  planning  and  strategies;  (iii)  financial  management  and  efficient  resource\nallocation;  and  (iv)  modern  management  tools.  ADB  is  supporting  the  transformation  of  the\nrailway  sector  to  provide  efficient,  safe,  and  quality  transport  services;  maintain  financial  self-\nsufficiency;  and  enhance  subregional  cooperation  with  neighboring  countries  in  Central  Asia\n(covering  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  Uzbekistan)  and  Southeast  Asia  (covering  Lao\nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, and Viet Nam).\n\nADB  coordinates  with  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  and  World\n21.\nBank  to  ensure  complementarity  of  aid  involvement  in  the  railway  sector.  During  project\nprocessing,  discussions  were  held  with  JBIC  and  World  Bank  staff  regarding  their  operational\nexperience  with  ongoing  railway  programs.  The  Project  is  in  line  with  the  national  priorities  for\nrailway  development  and  ADB's  strategy  in  the  sector,  and  complements  the  investments  and\npolicy dialogue of JBIC and the World Bank.\n\nD. \n\nLessons Learned\n\n22.\nExperience from completed and ongoing ADB-financed railway projects in the PRC shows\nstrong  commitment  and  generally  satisfactory  capabilities  of  the  executing  agencies  (EAs)  for\nproject implementation. The speed of implementation has generally exceeded the expectations at\nthe  time  of  appraisal.  The  EAs  generally  complied  with  the  loan  covenants.  Resettlement  and\nenvironmental management were carried out satisfactorily. Audit covenants were complied with in\na timely manner, and the audited financial statements were found generally acceptable. Of ADB\u2019s\nnine  railway  projects,  five  (footnote  1)  are  complete,  and  four  (footnote  2)  are  under\nimplementation. The major lessons learned and accomplishments under these projects are given\nin Appendix 4.\n\n23.\nThe key lessons from the previous railway projects highlight the need to (i) ensure that\nthe  EA  established  for  project  processing  and  implementation  is  also  responsible  for  the\nproject\u2019s  operation;  (ii)  prepare  realistic  traffic  forecasts;  (iii)  review  constraints  to  traffic  on  a\nnetwork basis, and the impact on project viability of the existing and/or planned railway lines and\nother transportation modes that may compete with the project facilities; and (iv) finance railway\nprojects with appropriately determined debt-equity ratios.\n\n24.\nPrevious  railway  projects  have  sparked  socioeconomic  development  in  the  projects'\ninfluence areas. The main impacts experienced were (i) new railway lines in less-developed and\npoor regions stimulated economic development resulting in higher growth rates of GDP and rural\nincomes  compared  with  the  without  the  project  scenario;35  (ii)  construction  activities  generated\ndemand for unskilled labor and employment of poor workers who would have otherwise remained\nunemployed or underemployed;36 (iii) service roads built for construction activities opened up and\n\n                  \n\n35 In the project area of the Jing-Jiu Railway (footnote 1) the GDP of 10 counties in Jiangxi Province increased from\nY4.9 billion in 1993 to Y15.4 billion in 1998, an annual increase of 25.5 percent compared with 10.2 percent for the\nprovince as a whole. Rural income per capita in Xinfeng County increased from Y802 in 1993 to Y2,222 in 1998,\nan annual increase of 18.5 percent compared with 10.3 percent during 1985-1992 (before the project).\n\n36 During the first two years of construction of the Guizhou-Shuibai Railway (footnote 2), a total of about 7.5 million\nperson-days of employment was generated, of which 4.1 million person-days or about 55 percent were provided to\nlocal poor people thereby raising them above the poverty line.\n\n\f8\n\nbenefited rural communities in inaccessible areas; (iv) domestic resource mobilization improved,\nproviding additional resources for social programs37 and generating employment; (v) supply and\ntransportation of local materials generated employment; (vi) low cost railway transport, compared\nwith the high cost of motorized transport, extended the market spatially by increasing the distance\nto  breakeven  locations  resulting  in  lower  prices  of  agricultural  inputs  (such  as  fertilizers),  which\nstimulated  cash-crop  farming  and  provided  more  income  to  farmers;  and  increased  mobility  of\nrural residents and allowed access to more employment opportunities and social services beyond\ntheir  immediate  community  neighborhoods;  (vii)  counties  provided  with  railway  access  recorded\nhigher  GDP  growth  rates  than  those  without  the  railway;  (viii)  the  investment  environment  was\nenhanced;  resulting  in  rapid  development  of  secondary  and  tertiary  industries  that  generated\nemployment;38  the  consequent  shift  in  the  structure  of  employment  from  low  productivity\nagriculture  to  higher  productivity  agroprocessing  and  light  industry  increased  employment\nopportunities for women whose incomes and social status then improved;39 (ix) tourism developed\nbecause of more affordable and convenient railway travel; and (x) environmental protection and\nmitigation  measures  were  taken  under  the  projects  as  agreed  at  appraisal;40  and  environmental\nimpacts  of  induced  developments  were  addressed  in  accordance  with  the  EIAs  and  summary\nEIAs  for  those  projects.  In  summary,  the  railway  projects  have  contributed  to  a  dramatic\ntransformation of the local economies. The per capita rural incomes in the project areas increased\nsubstantially  compared  with  those  before  the  project.  Living  standards  were  raised  and  poverty\nwas reduced. The lessons learned and experiences with the previous railway projects have been\nappropriately incorporated in the design of the Project.\n\nE. \n\nADB's Sector Strategy\n\nADB\u2019s  strategy  for  the  PRC  emphasizes  three  broad  objectives:  (i)  improve  economic\n25.\nefficiency;  (ii)  promote  growth  in  poor  inland  provinces  to  reduce  poverty;  and  (iii)  protect  the\nenvironment  and  manage  natural  resources.  In  pursuit  of  these  three  broad  objectives,  the\nstrategy  supports  developing  efficient  and  integrated  transport  networks  to  meet  the  needs  of  a\ngrowing market economy and contribute to reducing poverty through investment targeting poorer\nareas coupled with policy and institutional reforms.\n\n26.\nRecognizing  the  importance  of  railway  transport  in  the  development  of  the  national\neconomy,  ADB\u2019s  strategy  for  the  railway  sector  focuses  on  (i)  expanding  the  railway  system  by\nconstructing  new  lines  in  unserved,  less-developed,  and  poor  areas;  (ii)  modernizing  and\nincreasing  the  capacity  on  key  routes  of  the  national  railway  system  to  improve  transport\nefficiency;  and  (iii)  commercializing  railway  operation  to  sustain  efficient  operation.  Through  this\nstrategy  ADB's  overarching  goal  is  to  reduce  poverty.  The  location  of  the  Project  in  a  less-\ndeveloped and poor region is in line with ADB\u2019s strategy and will promote economic growth and\n\n                  \n\n37 The  financial  revenue  of  10  poverty  counties  in  Jiangxi  Province  that  are  traversed  by  the  Jing-Jiu  Railway\n(footnote  1)  increased  from  Y0.5  billion  in  1993  to  Y1.4  billion  in  1998,  an  annual  increase  of  22.7  percent\ncompared with 12.3 percent during 1985-1992, before construction of the Jing-Jiu Railway.\n\n38 The Jing-Jiu Railway facilitated the setting up of a large number of resource- and agriculture- based industries in\nXingfeng  County  of  Jiangxi  Province.  Their  number  increased  from  3  in  1992  to  39  in  1998,  after  project\ncompletion.  The  number  of  businesses  grew  from  8,005  in  1992  to  19,287  in  1998,  and  the  number  of  persons\nemployed  in  these  increased  from  18,484  in  1992  to  52,153  in  1998,  an  annual  increase  of  23  percent.  In  the\nsame county the number of people living below the poverty line reduced from 30,400 in 1993 to 11,580 in 1998, a\ndecline by 62 percent.\n\n39 Beneficial  income  and  social  impacts  particularly  on  women  were  noted  in  the  influence  areas  of  the  Yaogu-\n\nMaoming Railway (footnote 1) and Guang-Mei-Shan Railway (footnote 1).\n\n40 The China Academy of Railway Sciences, which monitored environmental management on the Jing-Jiu Railway,\n\nreported that the environmental requirements in the EIA and the summary EIA were complied with.\n\n\f9\n\nprovide  poor  people  with  more  access  to  a  broad  range  of  socioeconomic  activities,  including\nemployment and income opportunities that will improve living standards and reduce poverty.\n\nF. \n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n27.\nPolicy dialogue has been a significant component of ADB assistance to the railway sector\nand  has  effectively  complemented  the  lending  operations.  The  issues  addressed  include\ncommercializing operations, supporting management autonomy of railway operations, developing\nhuman  resources,  and  improving  financial  management  and  accounting  systems.  During  the\npolicy dialogue for the Project, poverty reduction aspects of the Project were strengthened. Other\nareas  covered  included  institutional  reforms,  cost  recovery  and  commercialization,  market  and\nbusiness development, private sector participation, and nongovernment financing.\n\n1. \n\nPoverty Reduction\n\n28.\nPoverty  reduction  through  pro-poor  economic  growth  is  a  key  aspect  of  the  policy\ndialogue. The Project is located in a poor area. Because of the high incidence of poverty in the\nproject  area,  poverty  reduction  was  an  integral  part  of  project  planning  and  design.  Specific\nfeatures included in the project design are aimed at transferring the benefits of the Project to the\npoor.  Issues  discussed  include  (i)  obtaining  commitment  from  the  project  proponent,\nimplementing  agencies,  monitoring  agencies,  and  the  concerned  prefecture  and  county\ngovernments  to  pursue  pro-poor  policies  to  maximize  the  benefits  to  the  poor  during  project\nplanning,  implementation,  and  operation;  (ii)  providing  employment  during  construction  and\noperation of the GLR on a preferential basis to poor workers; (iii) supplying local materials that\nmeet the requirements of quality and economy from poor villages; (iv) providing station access\nroads and link roads to widen the Project's benefits to poor interior areas; (v) supporting poverty\nreduction programs of local governments to complement the poverty reduction efforts under the\nProject; and (vi) obtaining commitment from local governments to implement pro-poor policies in\nthe project influence area.\n\n2. \n\nInstitutional Reform\n\nADB  has  supported  institutional  reform  of  the  PRC's  railway  sector  to  separate  the\n29.\nGovernment's ownership and regulatory role from operation, giving full play to market forces for\nimproving  efficiency.  Passenger  and  freight  operations  will  be  undertaken  by  enterprises  that\noperate in a competitive environment. The ongoing restructuring of railways will help create an\nenvironment that will attract private sector capital for railway development, including developing\nspecialized  railway  transport  services  and  improving  efficiency  and  the  quality  of  service.  For\nnew  investments,  railway  enterprises  will  have  to  ensure  financial  viability  through  increasing\ncommercialization  of  operations  (para  31).  New  railways  that  the  Government  requires  to  be\nbuilt  mainly  to  develop  unserved  inland  areas  and  directly  reduce  poverty  will  continue  to  be\nfinanced by the Government. MOR will pursue these areas of reform.41\n\nThe PRC's entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO) 42 will open up railway transport\n30.\nservices to foreign investors and operators.43 This development needs to be taken into account\n\n                  \n\n41 Due  consideration  will  also  be  given  to  the  lessons  learned  from  reforms  on  railway  systems  in  other  countries\n\n(i.e., the United Kingdom, US, and Japan).\n\n42 Under WTO accession commitments, foreign investors would be able to (i) acquire minority shareholding in joint\nventures for freight services after the PRC's accession to the WTO, (ii) acquire majority shareholding within three\nyears thereafter, and (iii) set up solely foreign-owned companies within six years after the PRC's accession to the\nWTO.\n\n\f10\n\nfor future restructuring of the national railway along market principles. In addition, the structure\nof transport demand may change with trade liberalization. MOR will therefore need to consider\nvarious institutional, operating, and technical options in its strategy for the structural adjustment\nof the railways. Under the Project, MOR will receive assistance in evaluating the implications of\nWTO  accession  commitments  on  railway  operation,  including  measures  necessary  for\nimproving operational performance.\n\n3. \n\nCommercialization\n\n31.\nADB  has  supported  commercializing  the  railway  operations  with  full  cost  recovery  to\nensure financial sustainability. A key element of the policy dialogue under ADB-financed railway\nprojects has been the establishment of pricing policies that facilitate optimal intermodal choices\nand efficient use of the railway. Tariffs will be set for full cost recovery while considering market\nconditions and the socioeconomic situation in the area served. MOR will apply the policy of new\nline,  new  tariff  to  the  GLR  and  ensure  full  cost  recovery,  covering  operation  and  maintenance\ncosts, depreciation, and debt service in excess of depreciation, taxes, and a reasonable profit,\nduly considering the price elasticity of traffic. This policy will be reflected in a tariff study that will\nbe  carried  out  by  MOR  to  determine  the  tariffs  to  be  applied  on  the  GLR  before  the  start  of\ncommercial operation (para. 84). Marketing efforts will be strengthened to include analysis and\nforecast of passenger and freight customers\u2019 demands for railway services. MOR will continue\nto eliminate excess staff to improve productivity. The performance of passenger transportation\ncompanies will be monitored with greater emphasis on improving service quality consistent with\ndemand.\n\n4. \n\nMarketing and Business Development\n\n32.\nThe  Government  is  addressing  transportation  constraints  by  constructing  new  railway\nlines  and  expanding  the  capacity  of  existing  lines.  As  the  PRC  progresses  to  a  market-driven\neconomy, the railway will compete on service quality for demand-based transportation services.\nIt  will  need  to  rely  more  heavily  on  new  marketing  and  business  initiatives  and  cost-effective\noperations. To be able to do this, the railway should offer new and improved customer services\nand  increase  productivity  through  marketing  and  business  initiatives  in  freight  and  passenger\nservices. MOR will pursue these initiatives; assistance will be provided under the Project.\n\n5. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation and Nongovernment Financing\n\n33.\nIn line with ADB's private sector development strategy, a wider role for the private sector\nis  envisaged  during  project  implementation.  MOR  has  taken  steps  to  create  the  conditions\nnecessary  to  attract  investment  in  the  project  facilities  and  services  from  nongovernment  and\nprivate  sector  sources.  Possible  areas  include  construction  of  industrial  sidings,  tourism,  and\ncontainer  and  luggage-related  businesses.  The  strategic  proximity  of  the  GLR  to  Xiamen  Port\nwill provide a good impetus to private sector operations in the project influence area.44 The GLR\nwill expand the hinterland of Xiamen Port into interior areas that are largely poor and help create\nthe  conditions  necessary  for  local  governments  to  attract  private  investments  for  industrial\ndevelopment.\n\n   \n43 In  August  2000,  MOR  and  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Trade  and  Economic  Cooperation  jointly  promulgated\n\nregulations on approval and management of foreign-funded railway freight transport enterprises.\n\n44 ADB  is  providing  assistance  under  Loan  1584-PRC:  Xiamen Port Project,  for  $50  million,  approved  on  27\nNovember  1997,  to  expand  the  port's  cargo-handling  capacity  to  meet  demand  and  provide  market  access  to\nresource-rich but less-developed neighboring inland areas.\n\n\f11\n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\nin \n\n34.\nLocated  in  a  poor  and  less-developed  area,  the  Project  will  catalyze  economic\ndevelopment  and  help  reduce  poverty.  Progress  in  reducing  poverty  in  the  PRC  has  been\nsignificant  particularly \nthe  coastal  areas  and  urban  centers  where  markets,  skills\ndevelopments, and new technologies are easily accessed. Nevertheless poverty has persisted\nin some inland regions, such as the eight counties/district (footnote 49) in southern Jiangxi and\nwestern  Fujian  provinces,  which  comprise  the  project  influence  area.  Reducing  the  more\nintransigent poverty in this largely mountainous area will require reaching out to the remote rural\npopulation with small-sized and low-quality agricultural land, little access to modern technology\nand training, and no cost-effective means to transport raw materials and products. This region\nhas rich natural resources (i.e., metallic ores, coal, limestone, and granite) and is known for its\nscenic  landscape  and  historical  sites.  But  poor  accessibility  and  the  high  cost  of  motorized\ntransport  have  limited  development  and  this  region  has  remained  less  developed  and  poor.\nBased  on  experience  with  previous  railway  projects,  cost-effective  railway  transportation  will\ninduce  the  sustainable  development  of  natural  resources  and  industries,  and  market-based\nagriculture  that  will  improve  productivity  and  raise  individual  households  out  of  poverty.  It  will\nhelp  increase  domestic  resource  mobilization  by  local  governments.  In  view  of  these  reasons,\nthe  Government  characterizes  the  GLR  as  a  key  poverty  reduction  project  in  the  Tenth  FYP\n(2001-2005).\n\nThe GLR\u2019s strategic positioning between the port of Xiamen and the Jing-Jiu Railway (a\n35.\nmajor north-south railway artery, which ADB helped finance), and its connections to the national\nnetwork will improve traffic maneuverability, reduce transportation constraints, and lower network\ntransportation costs. The GLR will provide an important transit link to the less-developed and poor\nsouthwest  regions  of  the  PRC  when  the  proposed  railway  link  from  Ganzhou  to  Chenzhou  and\nLiuzhou in Guangxi is constructed.45\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n36.\nThe  Project's  goal  is  to  promote  sustainable  economic  growth  that  will  help  reduce\npoverty in the project area. This will be achieved by providing economic railway transportation in\nunserved,  less-developed,  and  poor  areas  to  create  the  conditions  necessary  for  developing\nlocal resources and generating employment and income-enhancing opportunities that will raise\nliving standards, particularly for the poor.\n\n37.\nThe  project  scope  comprises  (i)  constructing  a  single-track,  standard-gauge  railway\n(about 277 km long)46 between Ganzhou and Longyan, including subgrades;47 141 bridges with\na  total  length  of  33  km;  970  culverts;  and  99  tunnels  with  a  total  length  of  61  km;48  (ii)  laying\nrailway  track  consisting  of  rails  and  accessories,  concrete  sleepers,  and  stone  ballast;  (iii)\nconstructing  14  new  railway  stations  complete  with  facilities;  (iv)  providing  modern  technology\n\n                  \n\n45 Preliminary investigations and survey of the proposed railway link to the PRC's southwest are in progress.\n46 About 120 km or 43.3 percent of the GLR\u2019s total length, in Jiangxi Province, falls in the jurisdiction of the Nanchang\nRailway Administration, and the remaining 157 km, or 56.7 percent, in Fujian Province, is in the jurisdiction of the\nShanghai Railway Administration.\n\n47 The  subgrade  includes  retaining  walls,  protection  of  earth  slopes  from  erosion,  protection  against  scouring,\n\ngroundwater drains, and other works that support environmental protection.\n48 There are 13 bridges more than 500 m, and four tunnels more than 4 km long.\n\n\f12\n\nand equipment for signaling, communications, transportation management information system,\nfreight  and  container  yard  operation,  and  mechanized  maintenance  of  track;  (vi)  providing\ntraining on the use and maintenance of modern equipment; (vii) protecting the environment and\nmitigating adverse environmental effects; (viii) acquiring land and resettling affected people; (ix)\nfor  design,  construction  supervision  and  quality  control,\nproviding  consulting  services \nprocurement,  environmental  monitoring,  and  monitoring  of  resettlement  implementation  and\npoverty reduction; and (x) strengthening the institutional capacity of the EA.\n\nC. \n\nTechnical Justification\n\n1. \n\nProject Area\n\nThe GLR, connecting the cities of Ganzhou and Longyan, crosses eight counties/district\n38.\nin  two  prefectures  and  two  provinces.49  The  western  half  of  the  alignment  is  hilly  terrain  with\ngenerally favorable conditions for agriculture. From the center section eastward, the topography\nis  moderately  mountainous  with  complex  and  faulted  strata.  At  the  western  end,  the  GLR  will\nconnect to the existing Ganxian station of the Jing-Jiu Railway (footnote 1). The existing Jing-Jiu\nfacilities  at  the  Ganzhou  passenger  station  and  Ganzhou  east  district  station  will  be  improved\nunder  the  Project.  On  the  eastern  end,  the  GLR  will  connect  to  the  existing  Longyan  west\npassenger  station  (on  the  Zhangping-Longyan-Meizhou  Railway),  which  will  be  expanded  by\nMOR together with the Tieshanyang district station on the Zhangping-Longyan line. The recently\nupgraded  national  highways  319  and  323  are  within  a  few  kilometers  of  the  GLR  and  are\ngenerally parallel to it (map 2).\n\n2. \n\nTraffic Forecast\n\n39.\nThough a relatively small link in the overall national network, the GLR provides a direct\nrailway link to the port of Xiamen (footnote 44) from the north-south Jing-Jiu Railway. Xiamen's\nrapid growth in the 1990s is expected to continue, with the port traffic also maintaining its growth\ntrend. Relatively little of this traffic is moving currently by rail, mainly because direct rail service\nto  the  port's  natural  hinterland  to  the  west  is  not  yet  available  and  the  existing  railway  link  is\ncircuitous  and  congested.  The  GLR\u2019s  direct  link  to  the  Jing-Jiu  Railway  will  also  help  reduce\ncongestion  along  the  north-south  movement  of  freight  to  and  from  the  already  congested\nsouthern ports by diverting some traffic to Xiamen.\n\n40.\nFreight traffic was forecast by commodity (i.e., metallic ores, grain, coal, iron and steel,\ntimber, fertilizer, petroleum, and others), and in three categories differentiated by their economic\nimpact:  (i)  diverted  rail  traffic  from  other  lines  to  the  GLR  based  on  projected  traffic  on  the\nnetwork by major commodity groups, and reduced overall railway operating costs in the national\nnetwork as a result of the GLR; (ii) traffic diverted from the road based on an assessment of the\nrelative  service  and  cost  competitiveness  of  the  GLR;  and  (iii)  additional  generated  traffic  that\nwould  not  move  except  due  to  the  GLR.  The  forecast  of diverted traffic is based on MOR's\n\n                  \n\n49 The  eight  counties/district  are  Ganxian,  Huichang,  Ruijin,  and  Yudu  counties  in  Ganzhou  City  (prefecture-level);\nand  Changting,  Liancheng,  and  Shanghang  counties,  and  Xinluo  District  in  Longyan  City  (prefecture-level).\nExcepting Ganxian County and Xinlou District, the remaining six intermediate counties are national-level poverty\ncounties with the exception of Ruijin, which is a provincial-level poverty county.\n\n\f13\n\nrailway  investment  strategy  model.50  The  forecast  of  generated  traffic  is  based  on  market\nsurveys  and  the  assessment  of  consultants  for  TA  3486  (footnote  6),  which  was  prepared  in\nconsultation with local communities and industry representatives.51 The forecast of freight traffic\ntakes into consideration the lessons learned on previous railway projects as well as the trend of\ndeclining freight traffic intensity in the PRC.52 A summary of the traffic forecasts is given in Table\n1 and details are given in Appendix 5.\n\nType of Traffic\nFreight (tons)\nTransit\nOther than Transita\nTotal (tons)\nTotal (ton-km)\nPassenger (number)\nTotal (passenger-km)\n\nTable 1: Summary of Traffic Forecasts\n(million)\n2011\n\n2007\n\n2016\n\n2021\n\n2026\n\n6.3\n3.8\n10.1\n1,979.0\n2.7\n377.0\n\n7.6\n5.2\n12.8\n2,453.0\n5.2\n719.0\n\n9.5\n7.6\n17.1\n3,219.0\n7.9\n1,091.0\n\n11.7\n11.2\n22.9\n4,258.0\n10.9\n1,516.0\n\n14.5\n16.3\n30.9\n5,681.0\n11.1\n1,535.0\n\na\n\nIncludes originating, terminating, and local traffic.\n\nSource: Staff estimates.\n\n41.\nFreight volume on the GLR is forecast to increase from about 2 billion ton-km in 2007 to\n5.7  billion  ton-km  in  2026,  an  annual  growth  rate  of  5  percent.  Passenger  traffic  is  forecast  to\nincrease  from  377  million  passenger-km  in  2007  to  1,535  million  passenger-km  in  2026,  an\naverage  annual  increase  of  7.6  percent.  These  growth  rates  are  lower  than  the  actual  and\nforecast  growth  rates  for  the  Jing-Jiu  Railway  (7.1  percent  for  freight  and  8  percent  for\npassengers).  The  assumed  growth  rates  for  traffic  are  considered  realistic  and  achievable  for\nthe new line. Transit traffic, utilizing the shorter distances and the higher efficiency that the GLR\nwill provide to the national network, accounts for about 62 percent of the total traffic in 2007 and\n47  percent  in  2026.  Generated  traffic  accounts  for  the  remainder.53  Poor  access  and  the  high\ncost  of  motorized  transport  (about  Y0.70  per  ton-km)  have  limited  the  development  of  natural\nresources that have low commodity value in relation to weight and bulk. Cheaper transportation\non the GLR (with freight tariff of about Y0.21 per ton-km) will foster the sustainable development\nof  natural  resources  and  industries  that  will  increase  generated  traffic.  As  the  economy\nliberalizes,  both  business  and  personal  travel  are  expected  to  expand.  The  PRC's  0.8\npassenger  trips  per  capita  by  rail  in  2000  is  low  compared  with  other  developing  countries.\nRailway passenger traffic is expected to grow faster than the economy as a whole.\n\nThe port of Xiamen handles 18 million tons per year including 1.1 million containers (20-\n42.\nfoot equivalent units). The increase in container traffic has been dramatic, largely due to relaxation\nof trade restrictions with Taipei,China, enabling direct trade instead of through Hong Kong, China.\nThe GLR will provide a significant gateway to the east-west raiIway system connecting to the port\nof Xiamen. The Project is already acting as a powerful stimulus to improve infrastructure including\nroads  in  the  project  influence  area.  To  develop  container  traffic  on  the  GLR  and  the  adjoining\nnetwork,  the  Project  will  provide  equipment  for  handling  and  transporting  containers.  MOR  has\n\n                  \n\n50 The Railway Investment Strategy model developed by MOR is used for traffic forecasting and evaluating railway\ncapacity expansion. Traffic forecasting was done by simulation trials using field survey data under with and without\nproject  line  scenarios  to  obtain  commodity-specific  traffic  volume  on  the  project  line  by  traffic  type,  i.e.,  diverted\nfrom other railway lines, diverted from road, and generated. Validation of the results under TA 3486 show that the\nmodel provided sufficiently accurate traffic estimates both for the national network and the GLR.\n\n51 The final report for TA 3486 contains a comprehensive list of potential shippers.\n52 Between 1985 and 1999, freight intensity in the PRC per dollar of GDP declined from 17 ton-km to 4 ton-km.\n53 The GLR's generated freight traffic on ton per route-km basis is conservatively estimated at about 10 percent less\n\nthan the average for the national network.\n\n\f14\n\ngiven  assurance  that  it  will  efficiently  operate  these  facilities.54  Transportation  improvements  will\ncatalyze the development of natural resources and associated industries. Local governments are\nseeking  private  sector  companies  to  invest  in  their  areas.55  Given  the  growth  potential  of  the\nregion, the Government\u2019s priority for developing the project influence area, as well as the direct\ntransportation  link  to  Xiamen  Port  provided  by  the  GLR,  the  freight  and  passenger  traffic\nforecasts are considered reasonable.\n\n3. \n\nDesign Standards\n\n43.\nConsistent  with  the  traffic  forecasts,  the  GLR  will  be  built  as  a  single-track  railway  with\ndiesel traction. Conversion to electric traction will take place after a suitable buildup of traffic. The\nalignment  of  the  GLR  was  selected  from  various  alternatives  after  consultation  with  the  local\nresidents  and  taking  into  account  technical  feasibility  and  the  need  to  minimize  involuntary\nresettlement  and  environmental  impacts.  The  TA  consultants  and  ADB  missions  reviewed  the\nalignment  and  concluded  that  it  was  an  optimal  and  economic  solution  for  meeting  the\ntransportation needs of the region.\n\n44.\nThe GLR will be constructed to MOR\u2019s class I technical standards. For track facilities, 50\nkilogram per meter (m) rail will be used on concrete sleepers (with a density of 1,760 sleepers per\nkm) laid on stone ballast. The gradient will generally be 0.6 percent and the minimum curvature\n1,200 m, except in the mountainous sections where the maximum gradient will be 1.5 percent and\nthe  minimum  curvature  550  m.  Crossing  lines  at  stations  will  have  a  length  of  880  m  enabling\nfreight trains of 3,500 tons to be hauled matching the standard train size for the Jing-Jiu Railway.\nFor train control, a semiautomatic block relay signaling system with electric interlocking and color\nlight  signals  will  be  used,  and  fiber-optic  cable  for  communications.  Operational  safety  will  be\nenhanced by providing equipment to detect hot bearings of the rolling stock. Initially 14 stations (9\nfor passengers and freight, and 5 for passengers only) will be constructed. Additional stations and\npassing loops will be constructed in the future to meet increases in railway transport demand.\n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates\n\n45.\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project,  including  provision  for  physical  and  price  contingencies,\ninterest and other charges during construction, and front-end fee of 1 percent of the loan amount\nis estimated at $775 million. This comprises $254.7 million (33 percent) in foreign exchange cost\nand $520.3 million (67 percent) in local currency cost. The cost estimates are based on quantities\nderived  from  the  technical  designs  and  market  prices  for  goods  and  materials,  and  include  the\ncosts of land acquisition, resettlement, compensation, environmental protection, and measures to\nmitigate adverse effects, and provide for resettlement and environmental monitoring. The project\ncost  estimates  are  summarized  in  Table  2  and  detailed  in  Appendix  6.  The  GLR's  cost  of  $2.9\nmillion  per  km  compares  well  with  the  $3.2  million  per  km  for  the  Guizhou  Shuibai  Railway\n(footnote 2) and $3.0 million per km for the Hefei-Xi'an Railway (footnote 2 ).\n\n                  \n\n54 The  operation  and  management  of  container  facilities  will  be  done  in  consultation  with  the  China  Railway\n\nContainer Transport Center, which has the necessary expertise.\n\n55  Counties traversed by the GLR are providing various incentives to attract investors. A number of inefficient state\n\nenterprises have been restructured as joint ventures that are planning substantial investment.\n\n\f15\n\nTable 2: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\n201.8\n1.0\n\n202.8\n\n13.4\n14.1\n27.5\n2.0\n22.4\n254.7\n\n386.5\n63.6\n\n450.1\n\n29.6\n19.1\n48.7\n0.0\n21.5\n520.3\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n588.3\n64.6\n\n652.9\n\n43.0\n33.2\n76.2\n2.0\n43.9\n775.0\n\nItem\nA.

The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an\ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based\nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum, a front-end fee of 1.0 percent\n(the fee will be capitalized in the loan), conversions options that may be exercised in accordance\nwith  the  terms  of  the  draft  Loan  Agreement,  the  Loan  Regulations  and  ADB's  Conversion\nGuidelines,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement.  The\nGovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for the PRC's decision to borrow under ADB's\nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking\nthat  these  choices  were  the  PRC's  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any\ncommunication or advice of ADB.\n\n47.\nMOR  and  the  China  Development  Bank  will  finance  all  other  project  costs,  including\ninterest  and  commitment  charges  during  construction  on  the  loan  amount.

Because  of  the  poverty  reduction  aspects  of  the\nProject, the loan will carry an interest rate of 5.9 percent per annum. MOR will cover any cost\noverruns  including  cost  increases  that  could  arise  from  higher  than  projected  inflation  and\nunanticipated exchange rate variations. The Government and MOR have agreed to make timely\nprovision of sufficient counterpart funds to complete the Project as scheduled.\n\n\f16\n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1. \n\nProject Implementation\n\n49.\nThe Nanchang and Shanghai railway administrations, in whose jurisdiction the GLR will\nbe located (footnote 45), will be responsible for all aspects of project implementation, including\nplanning  and  scheduling  of  works,  contract  preparation,  bidding,  supervision,  quality,  and\npayments.56 The construction organizations under the two railway administrations have qualified\nstaff with experience on similar projects. Both implementing agencies will ensure that the quality\nof  construction  conforms  with  national  standards.57  Implementation  of  the  Project  by  the  two\nimplementing  agencies  will  be  coordinated  by  MOR\u2019s  project  coordination  office  supported  by\nit\u2019s planning, construction, financial, and technical departments, as well as the Foreign Capital\nand Technical Import Center (FCTIC). FCTIC will undertake the procurement of ADB-financed\ncomponents,  monitor  utilization  of  the  ADB  loan,  and  maintain  liaison  with  ADB.  FCTIC  has\nwell-qualified  and  experienced  staff  who  have  undertaken  similar  tasks  satisfactorily  in  the\npast.58  Preliminary  preparations  for  construction  will  start  in  the  second  half  of  2001;  the  civil\nworks are scheduled to start in early 2002. The construction of civil works and track laying will\ngenerally proceed from both ends of the Project. The Project will be constructed over a five-year\nperiod  and  be  completed  in  June  2006.  The  project  implementation  schedule  is  given  in\nAppendix 7.\n\n2. \n\nProcurement\n\nCivil  works  and  goods  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  following  international\n50.\ncompetitive bidding or international shopping procedures, in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for\nProcurement, and using  ADB\u2019s  standard  bidding  documents.  Each  supply  contract  estimated  to\ncost less than $500,000 equivalent may be awarded on the basis of international shopping. ADB-\nfinanced civil works contracts will be packaged on the basis of vertical slicing.59 A list of contract\npackages to be  financed  by  ADB is given in Appendix 8.  For  procurement  of  the  ADB-financed\ncontract  packages,  international  tendering  companies  selected  in  accordance  with  competitive\nnational  procedures  will  assist  FCTIC.  MOR-financed  civil  works  and  goods  will  be  procured\nfollowing the Tendering and Bidding Law.60 MOR has agreed to include the relevant sections of\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy61 in all bidding documents and contracts.62\n\n                  \n\n56 Both railway administrations have set up project implementation offices with qualified and experienced staff. These\n\noffices are carrying out initial preparations for the Project.\n\n57 Contractors risk a three-year disqualification for substandard work.\n58 FCTIC successfully completed procurement under Loan 1305 (footnote 1), and is carrying out procurement under\n\nLoan 1748 (footnote 2) satisfactorily.\n\n59 To ensure homogeneity of civil works, each contract will include subgrade, bridges, tunnels, and other works, but\nwill exclude specialized items such as track, signaling, telecommunications, and electric power supply, which will\nbe undertaken by contractors with the required experience.\n\n60 The  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law,  which  took  effect  on  1  January  2000,  prescribes  bidding  conditions  for  large-\nscale  infrastructure  construction  projects  that  are  fully  or  partly  financed  by  the  Government  or  by  international\nfinancing  organizations.  ADB  provided  assistance  for  preparing  standard  bidding  documents  for  domestic\nprocurement  under  TA  2845-PRC: Establishment of National Procurement Regulations for the Public Sector,  for\n$565,000, approved on 20 August 1997.\n\n61 ADB.1998. Anticorruption Policy (On-line). Available: http://www.adb.org/work/Policies/Anticorruption.\n62 The bidding documents and contracts for civil works will include special conditions requiring contractors to (i) hire\n50 percent of the unskilled workers from poor households, (ii) procure local materials that meet the requirement of\nquality  and  economy  from  poverty  villages,  (iii)  implement  environmental  protection  and  mitigation  measures  in\naccordance with the EIA and summary EIA, and (iv) ensure the health care of construction workers.\n\n\f17\n\nThe  Government\u2019s  request  to  undertake  advance  action  for  procurement  of  civil  works\n51.\nwas approved by ADB on 9 April 2001.63 Advance action will enable MOR to make preparations\nto start construction of civil works according to the schedule. A delay in construction would delay\nthe  start  of  commercial  operation  and  realization  of  project  benefits.  Timely  construction  is\nimportant  because  the  Project  is  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  policy  to  expand  infrastructure\ninvestment to stimulate economic growth and reduce poverty in a poor and less-developed region.\nThe advance  action  includes  all  procurement  activities  up  to  the  stage  of  contract  award.  The\nGovernment and MOR were advised that approval of the advance procurement action would not\ncommit  ADB  to  finance  the  Project.  An  imprest  account  will  be  established  to  facilitate  project\nimplementation  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  imprest  fund  procedures.64  The  Mission  ascertained\nthat MOR has sufficient capabilities for accounting, internal control, and auditing procedures to\nensure smooth operation of the imprest account.\n\n3. \n\nConsulting Services\n\n52.\nThe  ADB  loan  will  finance  eight  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  to\nhelp  MOR  (i)  evaluate  the  implications  of  PRC's  accession  to  the  WTO  on  the  development,\noperation,  and  management  of  the  railway  system,  and  propose  measures  for  sustainable\noperation  in  an  evolving  market  environment;  and  (ii)  strengthen  marketing  and  business\ndevelopment  functions,  including  training  of  key  railway  staff  (for  a  total  period  of  eight  staff-\nmonths). Terms of reference for the international consultants, who will be recruited in accordance\nwith  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants,  are  given  in  Appendix  9.  The  provisions  of\nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  will  be  included  in  all  invitation  documents  and  contracts  for\ninternational consultants.\n\n53.\nMOR,  through  FCTIC  and  the  implementing  agencies,  will  engage  and  finance  suitable\ndomestic  consultants  for  project  design,  international  procurement,  construction  supervision  and\nquality  control,  monitoring  of  environmental  management,  monitoring  and  evaluation  of\nresettlement, and evaluation of poverty reduction. Past experience with similar projects confirms\nthe  availability  of  adequately  qualified  and  experienced  domestic  consultants  to  satisfactorily\nundertake these tasks. The engagement of domestic consultants will be done in accordance with\nGovernment procedures acceptable to ADB.65\n\n4. \n\nLand Acquisition\n\n54.\nFor GLR construction, a total of 1,017 hectares (ha) of land will be permanently acquired\nand an additional 200 ha will be acquired for temporary use during construction. The institutional\nresponsibility  for  implementing  land  acquisition  will  rest  with  the  provinces,  prefectures,  and\ncounties  traversed  by  the  GLR.  MOR  will  pay  compensation  to  the  provincial  governments  in\naccordance  with  the  land  administration  laws  of  the  PRC.66  The  provinces  will  compensate  the\nrelevant  local  governments,  which  will  deal  directly  with  the  village  collectives  and  individuals\naffected.  The  two  prefectures  and  eight  counties  crossed  by  the  GLR  have  established  railway\nconstruction support offices (RCSOs) to facilitate land acquisition in consultation with the county\nland  administration  bureaus.  The  total  cost  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  estimated  at\n$38  million  equivalent  and  will  be  financed  by  MOR.  The  Government  has  assured  that  these\n\n                  \n\n63  Advance procurement action was reported in the May 2001 issue of ADB Business Opportunities.\n64 MOR is operating an imprest account under Loan 1748 (footnote 2).\n65 MOR  has  engaged  the  Fourth  Survey  and  Design  Institute  for  survey,  design,  and  environmental  impact\n\n66 The  compensation  for  land  acquired  will  be  based  on  the  agreements  negotiated  by  MOR  with  the  provincial\n\nassessment of the Project.\n\ngovernments of Fujian and Jiangxi.\n\n\f18\n\nfunds,  including  funds  necessary  to  finance  cost  overruns,  will  be  made  available  in  a  timely\nmanner. Resettlement under the Project is discussed in paras 72 to 76.\n\n5. \n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit\n\n55.\nMOR  has  agreed  that  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  will  be  made  for  reporting  on\nproject  implementation  progress.  MOR  will  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project\nimplementation  covering  progress  with  procurement,  civil  works,  environmental  management,\nland  acquisition,  compensation,  resettlement,  employment  created,  and  other  socioeconomic\nimpacts  during  construction  and  initial  operation  of  the  GLR.  The  progress  reports  will  compare\nthe original implementation schedule with actual progress during the period under review; provide\ncontract  award  and  disbursement  projections;  assess  compliance  with  loan  covenants;  provide\ninformation on operations, problems that would affect the implementation schedule, together with\naction  taken  or  proposed  to  be  taken;  and  include  a  program  of  activities  during  the  following\nquarter. They will also document the progress of station access and link roads. A midterm review\nof the Project will be undertaken by ADB in consultation with the Government and MOR during the\nthird year of project implementation.\n\n56.\nMOR's  financial  management  system  has  the  capacity  to  provide  accurate  and  timely\nreports  on  the  financial  status  of  the  Project  and  MOR's  overall  operation.  During  project\nimplementation MOR will maintain separate project accounts for all project expenditures financed\nfrom the ADB loan and domestic sources.67 MOR will produce annual financial reports comprising\nan income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. The project accounts and financial\nstatements  of  MOR  will  be  audited  by  the  PRC\u2019s  National  Audit  Office,  which  has  undertaken\nsimilar work on previous projects financed by ADB and the World Bank.68 Within nine months of\nthe end of each related fiscal year, MOR will submit to ADB the audited project accounts and its\naudited financial statements, including the auditor's opinion in English. To facilitate postevaluation\nof  the  Project,  MOR  will  furnish  to  ADB  within  three  months  of  the  physical  completion  of  the\nProject, a report on project implementation, in such detail as ADB may require.\n\n6. \n\nImplementation of Related Facilities\n\nConnected  Railway  Improvements.  The  impact  of  the  GLR  on  traffic  on  the  adjoining\n57.\nnetwork  was  reviewed.  Construction  of  the  GLR  will  increase  traffic  on  the  Longyan-Zhangping\nline (map 2). To cope with this increase, the existing track and operations on this line will need\nimprovements.  The  Shanghai  Railway  Administration  is  developing  plans  for  improving  the\nterminal facilities at Longyan and enhancing capacity on the Longyan-Zhangping line. MOR has\nassured that the required improvements will be completed in a timely manner. The progress of the\nconnected  railway  improvements  will  be  monitored  by  MOR  and  reported  to  ADB  through  the\nquarterly progress reports on project implementation.\n\n58.\nIndustrial  Sidings.  Industrial  sidings  improve  transport  efficiency  by  linking  the  railway\nand  the  manufacturing  and  warehouse  facilities  of  major  shippers  thereby  eliminating  handling\nand road transport costs for local delivery. Providing industrial sidings to handle large volumes of\n\n                  \n\n67 The  Mission  confirmed  that  MOR  has  the  expertise  to  prepare  accounts  and  conduct  internal  auditing  in\n\naccordance with the Government\u2019s standards.\n\n68 ADB is providing assistance under TA 3103-PRC: Strengthening the Government Auditing System, for $700,000,\napproved  on  26  November  1998,  to  strengthen  auditing  standards  and  procedures  to  conform  with  the\nrequirements  of  the  Audit  Law  and  international  auditing  standards  and  procedures.  A  training  program  will  be\ncarried  out  for  Government  auditors  to  promote  full  and  consistent  adherence  to  the  auditing  standards  and\nprocedures.\n\n\f19\n\nfreight will improve the competitiveness of railway services. The study under TA 3486 (footnote 6)\nidentified  potential  industrial  sidings  whose  construction  would  open  up  resource-rich  areas  for\ndevelopment. Both Nanchang and Shanghai railway administrations are pursuing opportunities to\nincrease  traffic  and  freight  revenue  and  have  been  proactively  discussing  the  provision  of\nindustrial  sidings  with  potential  customers.  MOR  has  given  assurance  that  potential  major\nshippers  along  the  GLR  will  be  encouraged,  and  assistance  will  be  provided  as  necessary  to\nconstruct and operate industrial sidings.\n\nService  Roads,  Station  Access  Roads,  and  Link  Roads.  About  150  km  of  service\n59.\nroads  will  be  built  to  facilitate  GLR  construction.  These  service  roads  will  be  laid  out  in\nconsultation with local governments to provide access to villages and communities in the interior\nthat currently have no access. On completion of railway construction, the service roads will be\nhanded  over  to  local  governments  for  use  by  local  people.  About  17  access  roads  (with  total\nlength of about 25 km) will connect the new railway stations on the GLR  route with  the  nearest\ncounty/township.  Eight  link  roads  (with  a  total  length  of  570  km)  will  be  upgraded  to  provide\nconnections between the railway and the hinterland (Appendix 10). These roads will maximize the\nbenefits of the GLR to townships and villages in the interior and provide wider market access for\npeople living in those areas. Local governments will construct the station access roads and link\nroads  concurrently  with  the  Project  using  their  own  resources.  MOR  will  report  the  progress  of\nconstruction  of  the  station  access  roads  and  link  roads  to  ADB  through  the  quarterly  progress\nreport on project implementation.\n\n7. \n\nOperation and Maintenance\n\nThe GLR will be operated by the Nanchang and Shanghai railway administrations of MOR\n60.\nin their respective jurisdictions (footnote 46). GLR operation will be integrated with that of these\nrailway  administrations,  which  will  be  responsible  for  the  management,  operation,  repair,  and\nmaintenance  of  the  GLR  facilities.  The  performance  of  MOR  in  the  repair  and  maintenance  of\nfacilities under previous projects has been satisfactory. MOR has assured that a sufficient number\nof trained staff and resources will be made available to meet the operational needs of the GLR,\nand a sufficient quantity of rolling stock (locomotives, freight wagons, and passenger cars) will be\nprovided to meet the traffic demand and operate the GLR efficiently.\n\n8. \n\nSafety of Operation\n\n61.\nThe Railway Law requires that the safety of passengers and freight transport be ensured\nduring  operation.  MOR  has  the  management  and  organizational  capability  to  monitor  the\ncondition of the railway infrastructure and its operation, and ensure the safety of passengers and\nfreight.  MOR  is  implementing  programs  for  human  resource  development  and  equipment\nmodernization that have significantly improved the safety on the national network (footnote 18).\nMOR  has  assured  that  upon  completion,  the  GLR  will  be  operated  and  maintained  efficiently\nensuring  the  safety  of  freight  and  passengers.  Railway  travel  is  safer  than  travel  by  road,\nparticularly in mountainous areas. Consequently, net traffic safety benefits are associated with\nthe Project.\n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Management System\n\n62.\nMOR  and  ADB  have  agreed  on  a  set  of  indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluating  project\nperformance. These include indicators for (i) sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction,\n(ii)  resettlement  of  affected  people,  and  (iii)  performance  of  the  Project  and  MOR  as  the  EA.\nDuring  construction  and  initial  operation,  employment  created,  particularly  that  benefiting  poor\n\n\f20\n\nthrough \n\nthe  quarterly  report  on  project\nhouseholds,  will  be  monitored  and  reported \nimplementation. Indicators for economic growth (i.e., GDP per capita, net rural income per capita,\nand  number  of  people  living  below  the  poverty  line  will  be  monitored  on  an  annual  basis  and\ncompared  with  the  baseline  values  before  the  start  of  construction.  Indicators  for  physical\noperation of the GLR and financial performance of MOR will be monitored on an annual basis and\nthe  results  compared  with  the  appraisal  forecasts.  MOR  will  prepare  and  maintain  records  of\nphysical operation on the GLR and MOR's financial performance for five years, starting from the\nfirst full year of commercial operation, which will be provided to ADB within nine months of the end\nof each fiscal year. The details of indicators for performance monitoring, monitoring and reporting\nagencies, and the frequency and duration of monitoring are given in Appendix 11.\n\n10. \n\nAnticorruption Measures\n\n63.\nDuring project processing ADB's anticorruption policy was explained to MOR. Attention\nwas  drawn  to  the  section  on  fraud  and  corruption  in  ADB's  Guidelines on Procurement  and\nADB's  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  Special  attention  was  drawn  to  the  need  for\ncontractors, suppliers, and consultants to observe the highest standards of ethics in the bidding\nand  execution  of  ADB-financed  contracts,  as  well  as  the  sanctions  if  fraud  and  corruption  are\ndiscovered.  MOR,  through  its  inspection  bureau,  ensures  that  the  Government's  policies  on\neliminating fraud and corruption are followed. The inspection bureau investigates all complaints\nto detect corrupt practices; action is taken as necessary. ADB is supporting broad governance\nactivities through its TA program. Support for the public procurement law, its standard bidding\ndocuments and implementing regulations (footnote 60), and strengthening the auditing system\n(footnote 68) are examples. In addition, ADB provided support for preparing various economic\nlaws,  and  construction  industry  regulations  and  registration  procedures.  The  Government  and\nMOR have indicated their commitment to ADB's Anticorruption Policy.\n\nG. \n\nThe Executing Agency\n\n1. \n\nOrganization\n\n64.\nMOR  will  be  the  EA  responsible  for  overall  project  implementation.  MOR  satisfactorily\ncompleted  the  Jing-Jiu  Railway  (footnote  1)  and  implementation  of  the  Hefei-Xi'an  Railway\n(footnote  2)  is  progressing  on  schedule.  MOR  has  extensive  exposure  to  other  international\nlenders,  such  as  the  World  Bank  and  JBIC,  and  bilateral  assistance  from  Australia,  Austria,\nCanada, and Germany. The internal capacity and the level of transparency are satisfactory. MOR\nhas adequate capacity to fulfill ADB's financial management and reporting requirements, as well\nas anticorruption and corporate governance requirements. MOR will ensure compliance with loan\ndocuments,  report  on  implementation  progress  to  ADB,  and  coordinate  with  Government\norganizations implementing the Project.\n\n2. \n\nFinancial Performance of MOR\n\n65.\nMOR's  financial  statements  reflect  the  consolidation  of  accounts  of  individual  railway\nadministrations.  A  projection  of  MOR's  financial  performance  was  prepared  for  2002  to  2010,\ntaking  into  consideration  the  investments  planned  during  that  period.  The  results  are\nsummarized in Table 4 and details are given in Appendix 12.\n\n\f21\n\nTable 4: Financial Performance of the Ministry of Railways\n(Y million)\n\nYear Ending\n31 December\nOperating Revenuea\nOperating Expense\nOperating Ratio (%)\na  Including proceeds of the railway construction fund.\nSource: Staff estimates.\n\n2002\n160,936\n108,026\n69.9\n\n2004\n180,058\n120,195\n69.5\n\n2006\n202,133\n133,947\n69.0\n\n2008\n222,848\n149,176\n69.7\n\n2010\n245,495\n164,766\n69.9\n\n66.\nMOR  will  maintain  an  operating  ratio  of  not  more  than  70  percent  on  its  operations\nduring  the  commercial  operation  of  the  GLR.  MOR's  operating  ratio  is  expected  to  steadily\nimprove because of revenue growth based on the adjustment of tariffs for inflation, improvement\nin  service  quality,  increase  in  efficiency,  and  adoption  of  market-oriented  policies.  MOR  is\npursuing organizational restructuring and management reforms to increase productivity, reduce\ncosts,  and \nrailway\nimprove  operational  efficiency.  Management  contracts  with \nadministrations  under  the  assets  operation  liability  system  (footnote  16),  have  improved  their\nfinancial  performance.  Establishment  of  passenger  transportation  companies  by  railway\nadministrations  with  more  focus  on  marketing  and  customer  services  will  improve  the\nprofitability  of  passenger  business.  The  divestiture  of  nontransportation  businesses  and\nactivities  in  2000  and  the  improvements  in  management  by  applying  new  tools,  such  as  the\npoint-to-point  costing  system  (footnote  22),  the  revenue  settlement  system  (footnote  23),  and\nthe TMIS (footnote 24) will have beneficial effects on the financial performance of MOR. Given\nthe  robustness  of  MOR's  financial  base,  and  the  expected  positive  effects  of  the  ongoing\nreforms,  and  restructuring  and  business  reengineering,  the  financial  performance  of  MOR\nduring 2002-2010 is expected to be satisfactory.\n\nthe \n\nH. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1. \n\nEnvironment\n\n67.\nThe Project is classified as environmental category A. The overall conclusion of the EIA,\nwhich was confirmed by the TA consultants and the Mission, was that the adverse environmental\nimpacts arising from the construction and operation of the GLR can be appropriately mitigated by\nundertaking  suitable  measures.  The  implementation  of  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring\nprograms  included  in  the  Project  will  ensure  compliance  with  the  environmental  guidelines  and\nprocedures  of  ADB  and  the  Government.  A  summary  EIA  was  circulated  to  ADB\u2019s  Board  of\nDirectors  on  29  March  2001.  The  EIA  (in  Chinese)  was  provided  to  the  RCSOs  in  the  counties\ntraversed by the GLR for the information of the public.\n\nAdverse  environmental  impacts  will  be  minimized  by  the  selection  of  an  appropriate\n68.\nalignment. The Project was designed to avoid forests and nature preserves, and to minimize the\nacquisition of arable land. The use of bridges and viaducts was favored in lieu of embankments,\nand tunnels in place of cuts. Specifically, the GLR uses extensive tunneling to preserve the forests\nin the project area. The trees to be cut down will be from orchards and secondary woodlands, and\nprimary/old growth forests will be untouched. Adequate buffer zones will be maintained between\nthe  railway  and  environmentally  fragile  conservation  areas.  The  rare  and  endangered  flora  and\nfauna  species  in  both  the  small  animal  preserves  operated  by  the  forestry  department  and  the\nworld-class  Meihuashan  nature  preserve  (which  is  separated  from  the  railway  by  a  minimum\ndistance  of  5  km)  will  not  be  adversely  affected  by  the  Project.  Potential  environmental  impacts\ninclude  those  related  to  tunnel  spoil  disposal,  soil  erosion,  air  pollution,  degradation  of  water\n\n\f22\n\nquality,  noise  pollution,  impairment  of  aesthetics,  disposition  of  solid  wastes,  and  encroachment\nonto  areas  set  aside  to  protect  plants  and  wildlife.  In  each  case  the  stressors  that  caused  the\nimpact,  and  the  receptors,  the  people  and/or  ecosystems  affected,  were  studied.  Wherever\nadverse impacts were identified, comprehensive mitigation measures were specified. A summary\nof the environmental impacts and mitigation measures is presented in Appendix 13.\n\nthe  Nanchang  and  Shanghai  railway  administrations \n\n69.\nMOR has assured that the environmental mitigation measures identified in the EIA and the\nsummary EIA will be incorporated in the design and construction stages of the Project.69 During\ntheir  project\nconstruction \nimplementation  offices70  will  coordinate  with  local  environmental  protection  bureaus  (EPBs)  to\nmonitor  the  contractor\u2019s  compliance  with  the  requirements  for  environmental  protection  and\nmonitoring  as  detailed  in  the  EIA  and  the  summary  EIA.  Although  most  of  the  construction\nworkers will be housed in the cities along the GLR route, monitoring the quality of potable water\nand  sanitation  (i.e.,  wastewater  and  solid  wastes)  in  large  workers\u2019  construction  camps  is\nimportant  for  protecting  the  health  of  both  the  workers  and  the  downstream  users  of  the\nwatercourses. The environmental mitigation and monitoring measures are estimated to cost Y91.2\nmillion ($11 million equivalent), which is included in the project cost estimates.\n\nthrough \n\n70.\nMOR  has  engaged  the  Beijing  Oasis  Environmental  Protection  Technology  Company\nLimited (BOEPTC)  71 to independently monitor environmental protection and mitigation measures\nand  to  ensure  that  all  applicable  national,  provincial,  and  local  environmental  laws,  regulations\nand guidelines, and standards, as well as ADB\u2019s guidelines and procedures on environment will\nbe  met  during  project  implementation.  BOEPTC  is  staffed  with  well-qualified  professionals  who\nhave  experience  with  the  environmental  management  of  similar  projects.  It  will  liaise  with  the\nNanchang and Shanghai railway administrations, the project implementing agencies, EPBs, and\nlocal governments, as necessary.72 Monitoring of such measures will be reported in the quarterly\nprogress reports on project implementation, annual reports on environmental monitoring, and an\nevaluation  report  one  year  after  completion  of  construction.  MOR  will  provide  these  reports  to\nADB.\n\n71.\nThe cheaper transportation provided by GLR will facilitate the sustainable development of\nnatural  resources  and  industries.73  The  Mission  confirmed  that  as  part  of  the  approval\nrequirements  for  all  projects  that  are  likely  to  have  adverse  impacts  on  the  environment,  a\ncomprehensive  EIA  will  be  prepared  in  compliance  with  the  national  environmental  laws  and\nprovincial  regulations.74  The  State  Environmental  Protection  Administration  and  the  EPBs  have\nassured that all forthcoming projects, including induced activities, will follow the same procedure,\nand that during the construction and operation of such projects the Government's environmental\n\n                  \n\n69 MOR  will  include  in  the  bidding  documents  and  contracts  for  the  civil  works  the  environmental  requirements  on\n\nwhich contractors need to take action as specified in the EIA and the summary EIA.\n\n70 Both railway administrations will strengthen their project implementation offices with environment specialists before\n\nthe start of construction to provide support on all environmental matters.\n\n71 BOEPTC is a joint venture enterprise set up by the Environmental Assessment Center of the China Academy of\nRailway  Sciences  and  the  Environmental  Protection  Committee  of  the  China  Railway  Association.  BOEPTC  has\nbeen assigned environmental monitoring work for the World Bank-financed Baoji-Lanzhou Railway Project.\n\n72 Before  the  start  of  construction,  BOEPTC  will  familiarize  railway  staff  and  contractors\u2019  personnel  with  the\n\nenvironmental requirements in the EIA and the summary EIA.\n\n73 Adverse  environmental  impacts  were  minimized  in  the  project  areas  of  previous  railway  projects  (e.g.,  Jing-Jiu\nRailway).  Natural  resources  were  developed  and  manufacturing  industries  set  up  taking  advantage  of  cheaper\nlabor and cheaper transportation compared with motorized transport.\n\n74 The  consultants  under  TA  3486  (footnote  6)  and  the  Mission  reviewed  samples  of  EIAs  of  natural  resource\ndevelopment  projects  and  industrial  projects,  that  were  found  to  be  satisfactory.  Ganzhou  Prefecture  confirmed\nthat  in  the  case  of  developments  induced  by  the  Jing-Jiu  Railway,  environmental  impact  assessments  were\nprepared and appropriate measures were taken to mitigate and minimize adverse environmental effects.\n\n\f23\n\npolicies, laws, and regulations will be followed to ensure minimal adverse environmental impact.75\nReview  by  the  Mission  confirmed  that  the  Nanchang  and  Shanghai  railway  administrations  and\nthe  EPBs  possess  adequate  professional  capability  to  manage  environmental  monitoring\nprograms.  They  have  both  the  qualified  personnel  and  the  necessary  facilities  to  monitor\nenvironmental  parameters,  including  ambient  noise,  air,  and  water  conditions,  as  well  as\nconcentrations  of  specific  pollutants.  Consequently,  environmental \ninduced\ndevelopment projects are expected to be addressed adequately.\n\nimpacts  of \n\n2. \n\nResettlement\n\n72.\nThe alignment of the GLR was selected through a combination of (i) technical suitability for\nensuring economic efficiency of project design, (ii) minimizing involuntary resettlement by avoiding\nfarmland  and  urban  areas  wherever  feasible,  and  (iii)  minimizing  environmental  impacts  by\navoiding fragile conservation areas. The design includes tunnels, viaducts, bridges, overpasses,\nand underpasses that reduce the area of land to be acquired as well as the disrupting effects on\nthe local community. The Fourth Survey and Design Institute carried out the detailed specification\nof  the  alignment  and  location  of  stations  in  consultation  with  prefecture,  county,  and  township\nofficials and representatives of local farmers. The alignment selected is both socially responsive\nand economically efficient.\n\nThe  acquisition  of  land  for  the  construction  of  the  GLR  will  affect  an  estimated  19,340\n73.\npeople  in  4,300  households,  including  those  who  will  lose  land  or  houses  or  both.  MOR  has\nprepared an RP for the affected people based on the land administration laws of the PRC. The\nRP  was  reviewed  and  refined  by  TA  consultants  and  the  Mission  in  accordance  with  ADB's\nrequirements for involuntary resettlement. It incorporates the results of a socioeconomic sample\nsurvey76  of  affected  households,  and  feedback  from  field  visits  and  meetings  by  the  TA\nconsultants  and  the  Mission  with  various  stakeholders.  The  RP  includes  the  compensation\nentitlement  of  affected  people  based  on  the  nature  of  their  losses.  It  will  also  apply  to  people\nwho  might  be  affected  due  to  land  acquisition  for  station  access  roads  and  link  roads.  Where\nnecessary, affected people, particularly those from poor households and households headed by\nwomen will be given additional assistance as provided by law. Affected people will be relocated\nnear  their  current  location,  and  communities  will  not  be  broken  up.  The  total  cost  of  land\nacquisition and resettlement is estimated at $38 million equivalent and will be financed by MOR.\nThe  Government  has  assured  that  funds,  including  cost  overruns,  will  be  made  available  in  a\ntimely manner, and that the entitlements specified in the RP will be disclosed and delivered to the\naffected  people.  The  RP  meets  with  ADB's  requirements  for  involuntary  resettlement.  Its\nsummary is given in Appendix 14.\n\n74.\nMOR  will  assume  lead  responsibility  for  implementing  the  RP.  The  institutional\nresponsibility  for  implementing  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  rest  with  the  provinces,\nprefectures,  and  counties  traversed  by  the  GLR.  MOR  will  compensate  the  governments  of  the\ntwo  provinces  crossed  by  the  GLR  for  the  costs  incurred  for  resettlement.77  The  provinces  will\ncompensate  the  relevant  local  governments,  which  deal  directly  with  the  affected  villages  and\npeople.  The  county  land  administration  bureaus  responsible  for  land  acquisition,  surveying  and\nrecording  the  amount  of  land  involved,  and  categorizing  land  into  quality  levels,  will  work  jointly\n\n                  \n\n75 For violation of environmental laws in respect of wastewater, and dust and gas emissions, about 37 factories and\n\ntwo mines were closed down in the counties and districts along the GLR.\n\n76 Under TA 3486, the baseline sample survey covered 600 affected households.\n77 The agreements on land acquisition and compensation between MOR and Fujian and Jiangxi provinces will be the\n\nbasis for payment of resettlement compensation by MOR.\n\n\f24\n\nwith  the  RCSOs  to  set  specific  compensation  values  for  the  land  involved.  Periodic  resettlers\u2019\nmeetings  will  be  held  at  the  local  level  to  discuss  the  RP,  the  implementation  schedule,  and\npolicies and standards of compensation, and to receive feedback from the affected people. Local\nunits  of  the  All  China  Women\u2019s  Federation  will  participate  in  this  process  to  ensure  that  the\ninterests and concerns of women, particularly households headed by women are fully addressed\nunder the Project.\n\n75.\nConstruction  of  the  277  km  GLR  will  proceed  by  contract  section.  Before  the  start  of\nconstruction  in  each  section,  detailed  surveying  of  housing  and  related  residential  areas  will  be\ndone. Public consultation and negotiation with the affected people will be carried out to determine\ncompensation and resettlement locations. The overall schedule for implementation will ensure that\nall  affected  people  will  be  relocated  as  well  as  provided  with  means  of  livelihood  before  the\nconstruction begins. Because of the careful planning and public consultation done,78 no significant\nproblems are envisaged in land acquisition and resettlement implementation. Local officials have\nexperience with resettlement on previous projects notably the Jing-Jiu Railway and the Longyan-\nMeizhou Railway.\n\n76.\nOn  10  March  2001,  MOR  distributed  copies  of  the  RP  (in  Chinese)  to  the  county\ngovernments and RCSOs for the information of the affected people. In addition MOR prepared\nan  information  booklet  covering  the  important  aspects  of  the  RP,  including  the  Government\u2019s\npolicies, privileges of the affected people, entitlements for compensation, legal rights of affected\npeople,  and  the  system  for  redress  of  grievances;  it  was  distributed  (on  23  March  2001)  to\ntownships  and  villages  along  the  GLR  route  for  the  information  of  the  affected  people.  The\nRCSOs are responsible for receiving the comments of the affected people and addressing their\nconcerns. MOR will report the progress of land acquisition and resettlement to ADB through the\nquarterly progress reports on project implementation. MOR has engaged the Research Institute of\nthe  Southwest  Jiaotong  University  (RI-SJU)79  to  independently  monitor  RP  implementation,\nconduct annual survey updates during resettlement implementation, report on completion of the\nresettlement,  and  evaluate  the  resettlement  process  two  years  after  completion  of  resettlement.\nMOR will provide RI-SJU's monitoring and evaluation reports to ADB. MOR has given assurance\nthat  the  resettlement  will  be  completed  satisfactorily  as  per  the  RP  and  in  accordance  with  the\nPRC's land administration laws and ADB's resettlement requirements.\n\n3. \n\nSocial Analysis\n\nThe  detailed  social  analysis  carried  out  under  TA  3486  examined  the  broader  social\n77.\ntrends,  as  well  as  the  needs  of  people  in  the  project  area,  and  their  ability  to  benefit  from  the\nProject.  Gender  issues  were  taken  into  account  in  the  analysis.  Adequate  consultations  were\nheld with people living in the project area, including formal and informal interviews and meetings\nwith  leaders  and  residents  of  local  communities  as  described  in  the  RP,  the  EIA,  and  the  final\nreport  for  TA  3486  (footnote  6).  The  widespread  knowledge  and  information  about  the  Project\namong  the  people  living  in  the  project  influence  area  was  confirmed  during  the  Mission\u2019s  field\nvisits.  The  social  analysis  incorporates  the  results  of  a  sample  household  survey  in  the  project\narea  that  provides  a  baseline  for  monitoring  the  impact  of  the  Project  and  associated\ndevelopments.\n\n                  \n\n78 The village representatives and households, including households headed by women, met by the Mission were all\naware  of  and  supported  the  Project.  They  expressed  belief  that  the  Project  would  provide  new  employment  and\nincome-generating opportunities, and that cheaper transportation on the railway will open distant markets and help\nget better prices for local produce and labor.\n\n79 RI-SJU  is  independent  of  MOR  and  is  staffed  by  qualified  personnel  with  experience  necessary  to  undertake\n\nresettlement monitoring. It has undertaken similar assignments satisfactorily on World Bank projects.\n\n\f25\n\n78.\nAbout 4.1 million people live in the eight counties/district on the GLR route; 83 percent in\nrural  areas.  Because  of  the  mountainous  terrain,  cultivated  land  is  limited  and  farms  are  small\nproviding rural families with less than half of their income. Over 20 percent of rural income is from\nwage  labor  and  nearly  30  percent  from  small  business  activity.  Over  60  percent  of  farmers\u2019\nhouses  are  made  of  traditional  earth  and  wood  construction  and  are  relatively  small.  Primary\neducation is almost universal in the project influence area. Basic health care is generally available.\nWater supplies are mostly safe, except in Changting County; but running water is quite rare. Out\nof eight counties/district (footnote 49), except Ganxian County at the west end and Xinlou District\nat  the  east  end,  the  remaining  six  intermediate  counties  that  do  not  have  railway  service  at\npresent  comprise  the  main  impact  area  of  the  GLR.  Ganxian  County  and  Xinluo  District  which\nhave existing railway service, will also benefit.\n\n79.\nThe  project  area  is  rich  in  natural  resources  (i.e.,  metallic  ores,  limestone,  coal,  granite,\nand  forests),  but  lack  of  economic  transport  has  limited  the  sustainable  development  of  natural\nresources and associated industry.80 Without railway transport, many of these assets will remain\nunderdeveloped.  Local  governments  are  providing  incentives  to  promote  investments  that  will\nbenefit from the externalities arising from the Project.\n\n80.\nThe  Project  will  have  major  direct  and  indirect  social  and  poverty  reduction  impacts  that\nsignificantly strengthen its justification. Formulation of the Project has sought to maximize positive\nsocial  impacts,  and  avoid  and  mitigate  the  negative  ones.  During  the  early  stages  of  project\ndesign  and  preparation,  continuous  publicity  on  radio  and  television  and  in  the  newspapers\nensured that the people living along the line became familiar with the main features of the Project.\nIn  the  course  of  fieldwork  for  the  feasibility  study  and  the  EIA,  and  during  the  study  under  TA\n3486,  the  Fourth  Survey  and  Design  Institute  and  the  TA  consultants  carried  out  intensive\ndialogue  with  local  government  officials,  representatives  of  townships  and  villages,  and  local\nresidents  on  the  choice  of  the  alignment  as  well  as  resettlement  options.  Questionnaires  were\ndistributed to many local citizens to solicit their opinion on the Project. The Mission visited villages\nalong the GLR route and interviewed a selection of local residents to assess the socioeconomic\nsituation and awareness of the Project among local people. A list of those who participated in the\npublic  consultations  at  various  stages  of  project  preparation  is  given  in  Appendix  15.81  The\nimplementation strategy focuses on the participation of local people to improve the distribution of\nbenefits to them. Local people consulted during the Mission's field visit supported the Project and\nbelieve  that  the  railway  will  provide  employment  and  income-generating  opportunities  that  will\nimprove their standard of living.\n\n81.\nIn  conjunction  with  the  Project,  local  governments  are  pursuing  the  objective  of  poverty\nreduction  through  (i)  market-based  agriculture,  (ii)  microurbanization,82  and  (iii)  development  of\ninland areas. Local governments have initiated a number of programs for increasing rural incomes\nby  growing  cash  crops  for  markets.  A  shift  to  market-based  agriculture  is  dependent  on  the\navailability  of  cost-effective  transport  that  will  be  provided  by  the  Project.  A  summary  of  the\ndevelopment programs initiated by local governments is given in Appendix 16. A reduction of the\nrural population through microurbanization will increase the per capita availability of the cultivated\nland among the rural people. Consequently, rural incomes will increase. Local governments are\n\n                  \n\n80 The natural resources to be moved are bulky in nature with relatively low commodity value in relation to weight and\n\nvolume making trucks inefficient as transportation providers.\n\n81 This  list  is  indicative  only,  and  exhaustive  details  of  public  consultation  (other  than  those  covered  in  the  sample\nsurvey \u2013 footnote 76) are available in the feasibility study, EIA, summary EIA, and the TA consultant's final report.\n82 Under  the  microurbanization  program,  new  urban  centers  will  be  developed  targeted  at  reducing  the  rural\n\npopulation from 73 percent to 50 percent.\n\n\f26\n\ndeveloping  urban  centers  along  the  GLR  with  associated  programs  for  industrialization.  The\ncheaper  transportation  provided  by  the  GLR  will  facilitate  access  of  farmers  to  markets  outside\ntheir immediate communities.\n\nThe social analysis indicates that no negative gender impacts will be associated with the\n82.\nconstruction  and  operation  of  the  GLR.  GLR  construction,  and  the  activities  induced  by  it,  will\nemploy  local  labor  at  a  wage  rate  of  about  Y20  per  day.  Given  the  extent  of  rural\nunderemployment,  the  demand  for  local  labor  will  increase  worker  productivity  and  wages.  The\nPRC law gives equal rights to women in employment. Labor-absorbing growth and the resulting\nexpansion  in  employment  opportunities  in  secondary  and  tertiary  industries  will  bring  many\nwomen into the workforce. The wages paid to women who are provided employment will increase\nfamily incomes. Prefecture and county representatives of the All-China Women\u2019s Federation will\ntake part in resettlement implementation and advise on wider social and economic development\nimpacts on women. The Project provides opportunities for gender-related employment grievances\nto  be  redressed.  The  rise  in  female  participation  in  the  workplace  during  GLR  construction  and\noperation  and  the  increase  in  women\u2019s  income,  will  have  important  consequences  for  poverty\nreduction  and  improving  the  status  of  women.  When  monitoring  and  evaluating  the  Project\u2019s\nsocioeconomic  benefits,  special  attention  will  be  given  to  households  headed  by  women.  The\nGovernment and MOR will ensure that ADB\u2019s policy on gender and development83 is followed.\n\n4.\n\nIndigenous People\n\n83.\nAlong  the  GLR  route,  the  only  known  ethnic  minority  with  a  significant  population  is  the\nShe  community,  found  mainly  in  Shanghang  County,  and  in  some  contiguous  mountain  areas.\nThe She account for 90 percent of about 59,000 minority people living in the eight counties/district\ntraversed by the GLR. Minority people comprise less than 1.4 percent of the total population of 4.1\nmillion. The She are economically and socially integrated and are not disadvantaged with respect\nto their cultural and economic position, nor are they likely to be disproportionately affected by the\nProject  on  account  of  their  cultural  identity.  No  special  measures  are  needed  for  them.  Small\nnumbers of at least 17 other minority nationalities live in the project influence area. Most live there\nbecause  of  intermarriage  with  the  Han  people.  These  people  are  also  fully  integrated  into  the\nmainstream and are not disadvantaged.\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses\n\n1.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\n84.\nBased on the policy dialogue under the Project, MOR will set GLR tariffs under the new\nline, new tariff policy at full cost recovery,84 while ensuring economy and efficiency of operation.\nThe  Project's  financial  internal  rate  of  return  was  estimated  at  6.4  percent,  based  on  an\nassumed  freight  tariff  of  Y0.2143  per  ton-km85  and  unit  passenger  revenue  of  Y0.113  per\npassenger-km, (Appendix 17). The proposed level of freight tariff is competitive compared with\n\n                  \n\n83 ADB. 1998. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development. Manila.\n84 Considering operation and maintenance costs, depreciation, debt service charges in excess of depreciation, taxes,\n\nand a reasonable profit.\n\n85 This  compares  with  a  freight  tariff  of  Y0.0791  per  ton-km  on  the  national  network,  Y0.16  per  ton-km  on  the\nMeizhou-Kanshi  Railway,  and  Y0.15  per  ton-km  on  the  Baotou-Shenmu  Railway  and  Hefei-Jiujiang  Railway.\nBecause of socioeconomic and affordability considerations, the passenger tariff was assumed to be the same as\nfor the national network.\n\n\f27\n\nthe cost of motorized transport of Y0.70 per ton-km. The projected level of traffic and tariffs will\nresult  in  sufficient  revenues  to  fully  meet  the  project  costs  under  the  full  cost  recovery  policy.\nSensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  Project  has  robust  financial  viability  since  the  financial\ninternal rate of return exceeds the weighted average cost of capital of 3.4 percent in the tested\nadverse scenarios. Tariffs to be applied on the GLR will be based on a tariff study to be carried\nout  by  MOR  before  the  start  of  commercial  operation.  This  study  will  consider  various  tariff\nalternatives and analyze the impact of the proposed tariff on traffic demand. The results of this\nstudy will be provided to ADB.\n\n2.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n85.\nThe scope of economic evaluation includes financial evaluation, link roads, and station\naccess  roads.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  was  calculated  by  comparing  the  with  and\nwithout GLR scenarios. The benefits from the GLR comprise (i) benefits derived from freight and\npassenger  transport  such  as  operating  cost  savings,  time  savings,  and  net  economic  value\nadded  through  additional  production  that  would  occur  consequent  to  GLR  construction;  (ii)\nbenefits  associated  with  link  roads  and  station  access  roads  such  as  vehicle  operating  cost\nsavings and net economic value added due to station area development attributed to the GLR;\n(iii)  avoided  road  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  costs  for  the  existing  highways;  (iv)  avoided\nfatality  costs  on  the  existing  roads;  and  (v)  incremental  tourism  benefits  from  spending  by\ntourists  attributed  to  the  GLR.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  was  estimated  at  14.4\npercent  (Appendix  17).  The  Project  remains  economically  viable  in  the  tested  adverse\nscenarios.\n\nB. \n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n1.\n\nPoverty in the Project Area\n\nOf the eight counties/district traversed by the GLR, six counties are officially designated\n86.\npoverty counties. Lack of economic transport has been one of the major reasons why this region\nwas bypassed and remained poor. In 2000 the incidence of poverty in the project influence area\nwas 21 percent compared with 12 percent in the PRC as a whole. The main cause of poverty is\ninsufficient  opportunity  for  earning  income,  insufficient  arable  land,  and  lack  of  skills.86  Job\nopportunities are scarce, especially those that do not require displacement to a far-off part of the\ncountry. Jobs created within the project influence area allow the family member to maintain ties\nand  nonmonetary  responsibility  to  family  at  the  same  time.  They  also  bring  revenue  to  the\ncommunity for reinvestment either to generate economic development and jobs or to invest in\nthe  longer  term  needs,  i.e.,  education,  health  care,  and  the  cultural  life  of  local  people.  The\nsmall  size  of  the  cultivated  land  allocated  per  family  is  not  enough  to  gainfully  employ  all\nhousehold members. Therefore, at least one family member seeks wage employment to meet\nthe  basic  needs  and  improve  the  standard  of  living  of  the  family.  Data  from  the  household\nsurvey  shows  that  families  with  higher  dependence  on  agricultural  activities  are  the  poorer\nfamilies,  and  those  that  have  risen  above  the  poverty  line  are  getting  a  larger  share  of  their\nincome from wage earning and running small businesses on a commercial basis.\n\n                  \n\n86 Poverty  reduction  efforts  in  the  past  have  highlighted  the  importance  of  access  to  markets,  availability  of  cost\neffective means to transport raw materials and products to market, training, and new technologies for developing\ncash crops and increasing farm production.\n\n\f28\n\n2.\n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n87.\nThe  Project  will  have  direct  effects  on  poverty  reduction  by  providing  employment  and\nincome-generating  opportunities  to  poor  people  during  the  five-year  construction  period.\nCheaper  railway  transportation  facilitated  by  the  Project  will  induce  sustainable  economic\nactivity as evidenced under previous railway projects. The induced activities will have significant\nimpacts  on  the  people  in  the  project  influence  area  and  help  to  reduce  poverty.  A  detailed\npoverty  impact  analysis  that  demonstrates  the  impacts  on  poverty  reduction  of  both  the  Project\nand the developments induced by it is presented in Appendix 18.\n\na.\n\nImpacts During Construction\n\nA detailed assessment of the employment created during the construction and operation\n88.\nof the GLR was carried out under TA 3486. Each construction contractor will be required to hire\nat  least  half  of  the  unskilled  labor  required  for  the  project  construction  works  from  poor\nhouseholds. During construction, a large quantity of materials (such as sand and stone) will be\nobtained from poor villages.87 For materials that are locally produced, at least 30 percent of the\nunskilled labor requirement will likely be met by poor households. Access and link roads to be\nconstructed by local governments will create new employment, half of which will be availed of by\npoor households.88 Operation of the GLR will require about 2,500 staff. No new staff will be hired\nbut surplus staff from the national network will be relocated to operate the GLR, in pursuance of\nMOR\u2019s  policy  of  reducing  excess  staff.  To  load  and  unload  freight  wagons  and  to  work  as\nsecurity guards at stations and warehouses, the GLR will hire contract labor, 70 percent of who\nwill be sourced from poor households.\n\nb.\n\nImpacts of Induced Developments\n\n89.\nThe project area is rich in natural resources, including metallic ores, minerals, and forest\nresources.  Low  cost  transport  provided  by  the  GLR  will  facilitate  sustainable  industrial\ndevelopment in the project influence area. Poverty reduction programs by local governments will\nfoster  technical  skills,  managerial  expertise,  and  financial  means  needed  to  add  value  to\nprocessing  industries.  The  Project  will  stimulate  economic  development  that  will  enable  poor\nhouseholds to increase income, raise their standard of living, and decrease their vulnerability to\neconomic  and  social  adversities.  It  will  also  increase  the  revenue  base  for  local  governments,\nwhich  can  be  used  to  increase  expenditures  on  social  services.  These  outcomes  have  been\ndemonstrated in the previous railway projects, particularly the Jing-Jiu Railway (footnote 1).\n\n90.\nBefore  the  Jing-Jiu  Railway  was  constructed,  lack  of  economic  transportation  in\nGanzhou  Prefecture  constrained  development  and  this  region  remained  less  developed  and\npoor.89 In the aftermath of the Jing-Jiu Railway the economic development of western Ganzhou\naccelerated.  During  the  five-year  operation  of  the  Jing-Jiu  Railway  since  1996,  the  major\neconomic impacts in Ganzhou Prefecture were (i) GDP growth averaged 10.1 percent per year,\n\n                  \n\n87 During  the  field  survey  by  the  Fourth  Survey  and  Design  Institute,  local  availability  of  materials  that  meet  the\n\nrequired quality standards was ascertained.\n\n88 During  the  Mission\u2019s  field  visit,  local  governments  supported  the  special  measures  under  the  Project  to  provide\nemployment to poor households. The Mission was assured that lists of poor households in the villages along the\nGLR  will  be  made  available  to  the  contractors  for  hiring  poor  workers.  Similar  measures  were  implemented\nsuccessfully on previous infrastructure projects.\n\n89 The Jing-Jiu Railway traverses 262 km in the western part of Ganzhou Prefecture across 7 counties (i.e., Xingguo,\n\nGanxian, Zhanggong, Nankang, Xinfeng, Longnan, and Dingnan), 33 townships, and 133 villages.\n\n\f29\n\nexceeding  the  national  and  provincial  growth  rates  of  8.3  percent  and  9.8  percent;90  (ii)  387\nforeign-financed  projects  (with  total  investment  of  Y503  million),  and  3,271  domestic-financed\nprojects  (with  total  investment  of  Y8,560  million)  were  set  up,  which  was  15  times  the\ninvestment  during  the  previous  five  years  (1991-1995);  (iii)  new  and  expanded  industries\nprovided employment to 395,000 people, including 186,000 poor people; (iv) during 1995-2000\nthe change in the economy was dramatic, with the tertiary sector improving its share in GDP at\nthe expense of the primary and secondary sectors;91 (v) productivity and demand for labor along\nthe  Jing-Jiu  Railway  increased,  increasing  worker\u2019s  wages  from  Y3,775  in  1995  to  Y6,190  in\n2000;  (vi)  the  total  number  of  poor  people  in  two  national  poverty  counties  (i.e.  Xingguo  and\nGanxian) was reduced from 283,650 in 1995 to 240,000 in 2000;92 (vii) access to wider markets\nencouraged  production  of  cash  crops  (such  as  fruits  and  vegetables),  livestock,  poultry,\nfloriculture, and agro-based industry;93 (viii) a total of 10 million passengers and 8 million tons of\nfreight  were  transported,  or  an  average  annual  increase  of  36.5  percent  and  65.6  percent,\nrespectively; (ix) business and commercial activity was stimulated; at the end of 2000, Ganzhou\nhad 178,000 self-owned businesses and 5,086 private enterprises employing a total of 561,000\npeople;94  the  annual  industrial  and  commercial  tax  income  from  individual  self-owned\nbusinesses  was  Y610  million,  accounting  for  about  30  percent  of  the  budget  revenue  of\nGanzhou  Prefecture;  the  revenues  of  county  governments  also  grew;95  and  (x)  tourism\ndeveloped  rapidly;  in  2000,  Ganzhou  received  4.6  million  tourists  (including  37,700  foreign\ntourists) or about 20 percent of the total visitors to Jiangxi Province.96\n\n91.\nThe  study  under  TA  3486  showed  that  the  GLR  will  facilitate  significant  expansion  of\nexisting industrial and commercial activity in the region. The study identified 33 specific economic\ndevelopment  opportunities  that  were  directly  attributable  to  the  GLR,  including  sustainable\ndevelopment  of  natural  resources,  agricultural  processing,  microurbanization,  and  tourism.  For\nexample the Fujian Minxi Zijin Mining Industry Group, a public-private joint venture, owns a copper\nore deposit of 200 million tons near Longyan that can be economically developed using low cost\nrailway transportation. This activity will create about 6,000 new jobs, including 2,400 jobs for local\n\n                  \n\n90 In the project influence area of the Hefei-Jiujiang Railway (footnote 1), which includes seven counties, the GDP per\n\ncapita during the construction period (1992-1997) increased by an average 20 percent per annum.\n\n91 The percentage share of primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors in GDP was 34.7:29.3:36 in 2000 compared with\n\n44.3:30.2:25.5 in 1995.\n\n92 In  seven  counties  in  the  project  influence  area  of  the  Hefei-Jiujiang  Railway,  the  number  of  poor  persons  was\nreduced from 834,926 in 1992 (before the project) to 493,264 in 1997 (after the project). In two districts traversed\nby  the  Guang-Mei-Shan  Railway  (footnote  1)  the  number  of  poor  people  was  reduced  from  347,520  in  1992\n(before the project) to 56,318 in 1996 (after the project).\n\n93 Along  the  Jing-Jiu  Railway  a  number  of  products,  as  for  example,  salted  duck  from  Ganxian  County,  sweet\ngrapefruit  from  Nankang,  navel  orange  and  straw  mushroom  from  Xifeng,  gray  goose  from  Xingguo,  have  been\npromoted. The total area of orchards increased to 110,000 ha, with total yield of 350,000 tons. Nearly 1,000 firms\nfocusing  on  processing  and  marketing  of  agriculture  products  have  been  set  up.  The  Southern  Jiangxi  Fruit\nIndustry Company Limited, with daily processing capacity of 160 tons of fresh fruits, is listed on the stock market.\nAgro-products  are  being  supplied  to  more  than  20  inland  provinces,  cities  and  districts,  and  exported  to  Japan,\nPakistan and other Asian countries.\n\n94 The  rapid  development  of  self-owned  businesses  promoted  the  development  of  large-scale  commodity  markets.\nOver 600 trading markets with a total area of 2.36 million square meters and business volume of Y125 million have\nbeen  set  up.  Ganxian  County  has  attracted  Y280  million  to  build  the  Gannan  Guangcai  Market  at  the  Ganzhou\neast freight railway station in an area of 6.67 ha, with 1,200 shops and employing more than 3,700 people and an\nannual revenue of Y10 billion. At Dingnan County, 12 production bases of agricultural by-products, such as piglets,\npears,  and  nonseasonal  vegetables  have  been  set  up  with  a  sales  network  extending  to  Shanghai,  Guangzhou,\nand Beijing.\n\n95 In the project influence area of the Hefei-Jiujiang Railway (footnote 1) the revenue of the seven counties increased\n\nby an average 30 percent per year from 1992 (before the project) to 1997 (after the project).\n\n96 After completion of the Guang-Mei-Shan Railway (footnote 1) tourism to the project influence area doubled every\n\nyear because of the safety, comfort, and connectivity provided by the railway.\n\n\f30\n\npeople. Two existing cement plants in Yudu, two in Liancheng, and one each in Huichang, Ruijin,\nChangting, and Shanghang will expand their manufacturing capacity with the construction of the\nGLR. As a result 3,300 additional jobs will be created. The GLR will enhance the competitiveness\nof 10 granite mining enterprises in Changting County. These will create 180 additional jobs. In the\narea  of  agriculture-related  development,  the  existing  Liancheng  sweet  potato  processing  plant\n(capacity  80,000  tons)  will  be  expanded  by  50  percent,  creating  700  new  jobs.  Both  Yudu  and\nLongyan poverty reduction offices are planning to expand the production of green plums, forestry\nproducts, and other cash crops following the Liancheng example. The GLR will provide a synergy\nfor speeding up the Government's microurbanization program, which has targeted development of\nindustrial and commercial activity at six GLR stations. Under this program a shoe manufacturing\nfacility is planned to be set up at Xijiang, which will create an estimated 2,500 jobs.\n\nThe employment effects of induced developments estimated on the basis of freight traffic\n92.\ngenerated by the GLR from production in new industries and expansion of existing industries97\nare summarized in Table 5.\n\nTable 5: Employment Impact of the Ganzhou-Longyan Railway\nand Induced Developments\n(person-years)\nTotal Employment\nCreated\n\nEmployment for Poor\nHouseholds\n\nConstruction\n2002 to 2006\n\nOperation\n2007 to 2026\n\nConstruction\n2002 to 2006\n\nOperation\n2007 to 2026\n\nType of Employment\n(Unskilled)\nDirect\n\nConstruction of GLR\nGLR operation (MOR staff)\nLoading/Unloading\nSecurity guards\n\nIndirect\n\nGLR induced jobs (generated\ntraffic)\nMaterials sourced locally\nAccess and link roads\n\n76,020\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n20,230\n3,320\n10,070\n109,640\n\n\u2014\n 49,380\n103,360\n   1,280\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n888,040\n\n38,010\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n6,150\n1,660\n1,200\n47,020\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n72,350\n900\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n366,860\n\n\u2014\n\n734,020\n\n\u2014\n\n293,610\n\n   Rest of the PRC\nTotal\n\u2014=not applicable, GLR=Ganzhou-Longyan Railway, MOR=Ministry of Railways, PRC=People's Republic of China.\nSource: TA 3486-PRC: Ganzhou-Longyan Railway Project. Final Report, February 2001.\n\n93.\nDuring the five-year construction period, the Project will generate about 109,600 person-\nyears of unskilled employment, of which about 47,000 person-years will be provided to the poor.\nDuring  operation,  incremental  production  attributable  to  the  GLR  will  result  in  20,100  person-\nyears of employment in 2007 increasing to 60,000 person-years in 2026. Therefore during the\n20  years  from  2007  to  2026,  a  total  of  734,000  person-years  of  employment  will  be  created.\nAssuming that about 40 percent98 of the new employment will go to poor households, a total of\n294,000 person-years of employment would be passed on to poor people during 2007 to 2026.\n\n                  \n\n97 The generated traffic and employment created were estimated in the study under TA 3486. The study provides a\nlist  of  main  industrial  and  mineral  enterprises  that  would  be  heavily  impacted  by  the  GLR.  The  benefits  from\ninduced developments are not included in the financial and economic analyses of the Project.\n\n98 Based on the incidence of poverty in areas close to the GLR route as per the sample household survey.\n\n\f31\n\nc.\n\nDistribution Analysis\n\n94.\nThe financial and economic analyses have been integrated through a distribution analysis\nthat disaggregates the net financial and economic benefits to various beneficiaries. The impact on\nthe poor was measured by quantifying the direct benefits that would accrue to poor people from\nthe  Project.  The  proportion  of  total  benefits  passed  on  to  poor  people  was  determined  as  the\npoverty impact ratio of the Project, and evaluated as 26 percent (Appendix 17).\n\n95.\nThe  poverty  impact  ratio  compares  favorably  with  the  national  poverty  incidence  of  12\npercent. It does not capture the indirect benefits that would accrue to the poor from the economic\ngrowth, higher incomes, and better living standards from the Project. If these were also included,\nthe  benefits  accruing  to  the  poor  would  be  substantial.  The  impact  of  the  Project  and  induced\ndevelopments  as  well  as  local  programs  for  poverty  reduction  will  be  monitored  by  local\ngovernments, RI-SJU, and MOR under the project performance management system (Appendix\n11) and reported to ADB through the periodic and annual monitoring reports.\n\nC. \n\nRisks\n\n96.\nThe Project was designed to minimize potential risks. Based on experience with previous\nrailway projects, traffic demand was conservatively estimated. The forecast for freight traffic was\nadjusted  in  the  initial  years  of  operation  based  on  generally  slower  growth  experienced  on\nprevious  railway  projects.  Sensitivity  tests  have  shown  that  economic  circumstances  must  turn\nsubstantially  adverse  for  the  Project  to  lose  economic  viability.  A  potential  risk  is  delay  in\nimplementation,  which  would  delay  the  realization  of  benefits.  MOR  and  both  railway\nadministrations have successfully built railway lines over difficult terrain, such as the Nanning-\nKunming Railway, the Jing-Jiu Railway, and the Meizhou-Kanshi Railway. The support that the\nProject  has  from  the  Government,  MOR,  and  the  provinces;  the  thorough  preparation  of  the\nProject; and the approval of advance procurement action, all contribute to reducing the potential\nrisk of delays in implementation. The major environmental risks will be mitigated and monitored\nduring  project  implementation.  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  may  be  a  potential  risk.\nConsidering that these activities have been well planned, have the support of MOR and the two\nprovinces on the GLR route, are adequately budgeted in the project cost estimates, and will be\nimplemented  by  experienced  provincial  and  the  local  governments,  the  potential  risk  of\nresettlement problems is considered low.\n\nFor  a  project  generating  revenue  in  domestic  currency,  exchange  rate  changes\n97.\nconstitute  a  risk.  Since  the  share  of  foreign  exchange  in  the  total  cost  is  only  33  percent,  the\nforeign  exchange  risk  is  not  significant.  Sensitivity  tests  indicate  that  the  Project  will  be\nfinancially  viable  even  with  depreciation  of  the  yuan  by  as  much  as  30  percent.  The  risk  of\nunderachievement  of  the  expected  poverty  reduction  impact  if  employment  and  income\ngeneration opportunities do not accrue to the poor has been mitigated by the strong commitment\nof the Government, MOR, the two provinces, and the local governments to poverty reduction in\nthe project influence area.\n\n\f32\n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  and  MOR  have  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the\n\n98.\nstandard assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nConnecting  Railway  Lines.  MOR  will  ensure  that  the  connected  railway\nimprovements  on  the  Longyan-Zhangping  line  and  expansion  of  yards  at  the\nterminals of the project railway are completed in a timely manner.\n\nConstruction  Quality.  MOR  will  ensure  that  the  GLR  is  constructed  in\naccordance with national technical standards, and that construction supervision,\nquality control, and contract management are performed satisfactorily.\n\nCounterpart  Financing.  MOR  will  provide,  on  a  timely  basis,  all  funds  and\nresources  necessary  for  construction,  and  operation  and  maintenance  of  the\nGLR. MOR will cover any project cost overruns.\n\nEnvironment.  MOR  will  ensure  that  the  GLR  is  constructed  and  operated  in\naccordance with the national environmental laws and provincial regulations, and\nmeets ADB guidelines and procedures for the environment. MOR will also ensure\nthat any adverse environmental impacts arising from construction and operation\nof  the  GLR  are  minimized  by  implementing  the  mitigation  measures  and\nmonitoring  the  program  recommended  in  the  EIA  and  the  summary  EIA.  MOR,\ntogether with the provincial and county EPBs, will ensure that the station access\nand  link  roads  are  constructed  in  accordance  with  the  national  environmental\nrequirements. BOEPTC will carry out environmental monitoring in accordance with\nthe  EIA  and  the  summary  EIA.  The  results  of  environmental  monitoring  will  be\nreported  by  MOR  to  ADB  through  the  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project\nimplementation,  annual  reports  on  environmental  monitoring,  and  an  evaluation\nreport one year after completion of construction. The Government through Fujian\nand  Jiangxi  provinces  will  ensure  that  any  project-induced  economic  activities,\nparticularly  mining  and \nindustrial  developments,  will  undergo  appropriate\nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  under  the  national  laws  and  provincial\nregulations,  and  any  adverse  environmental  impact  will  be  appropriately\nmitigated.\n\nFinancial  Performance  and  Tariffs.  MOR  will  monitor \nthe  operational\nperformance of the GLR on the basis of agreed indicators of physical operation\nand MOR's financial performance; the results of such monitoring will be provided\nto ADB for the first five full years of GLR operation within nine months after the\nend of the fiscal year. The Government and MOR will ensure that the tariffs are\nset  at  levels  sufficient  to  ensure  full  cost  recovery,  including  operation  and\nmaintenance costs, depreciation, debt service, taxes, and a reasonable profit. Six\nmonths prior to opening the GLR for commercial traffic, MOR will carry out a tariff\nstudy to determine the tariffs to be applied. This study will be provided to ADB.\nMOR  will  maintain  an  operating  ratio  of  not  more  than  70  percent  on  its\noperations during the commercial operation of the GLR.\n\n\f33\n\n(vi) \n\nGender  and  Development.  MOR  will  follow  and  cause  Fujian  and  Jiangxi\nprovinces  to  follow  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  gender  and  development,  and  will  take  all\nnecessary actions to encourage women living in the project area to participate in\nimplementing the Project. MOR, with the help of RI-SJU, and in consultation with\nthe  local  representatives  of  the  All-China  Women\u2019s  Federation,  will  monitor  the\nProject's effects on women through gender-disaggregated data.\n\n(vii) \n\nIndustrial Sidings. MOR will ensure that potential major shippers along the GLR\nwill be encouraged and assisted as necessary to construct and operate industrial\nsidings.\n\n(viii)  Land Acquisition and Resettlement. MOR will ensure that all land and rights-\nof-way  required  for  the  Project  are  made  available  in  a  timely  manner.  MOR,\nunder arrangements with Fujian and Jiangxi provinces, will ensure that the RP is\ncarried out promptly and efficiently in line with the PRC Land Administration Law\n1998, the provincial guidelines on land acquisition and resettlement, and ADB\u2019s\npolicy  on  involuntary  resettlement.  MOR  will  ensure  that  all  persons  are\ncompensated  and  assisted  prior  to  displacement  from  their  houses,  land,  and\nassets in accordance with the RP such that they are at least as well off as they\nwould  have  been  in  the  without  Project  scenario.  The  Government  will  ensure\nthat funds for land acquisition and resettlement are provided as scheduled in the\nRP  and  meet  any  unforeseen  obligations  in  excess  of  the  cost  estimate.  The\nGovernment,  through  Fujian  and  Jiangxi  provinces,  will  ensure  that,  for  station\naccess  and  link  roads,  the  provinces  will  provide  the  same  compensation  and\nassistance  as  set  out  in  the  RP.  MOR  will  ensure  that  RI-SJU  carries  out\nindependent  monitoring \nresettlement\nregular \nimplementation,  and  evaluates  resettlement  achievement  two  years  after\ncompletion. Monitoring and evaluation will include annual survey updates during\nresettlement  implementation  as  required  in  the  RP.  MOR  will  report  to  ADB  on\nthe  progress  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  through  quarterly  progress\nreports, and a report to be submitted on completion of the resettlement, and two\nyears thereafter.\n\nreporting \n\nduring \n\nand \n\n(ix)  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  MOR  will  monitor  the  Project's  performance\nthrough  the  project  performance  management  system  to  ensure  that  the\nobjective of poverty reduction is achieved and the project facilities are managed\nefficiently. MOR will collect the necessary information on project performance as\nagreed to by ADB.\n\nPoverty Reduction. Through appropriate stipulations in the contracts, MOR will\nensure that subject to satisfying the requirements of suitability and economy (a)\nhalf of the total requirement of unskilled labor for the construction of the project\nfacilities will be hired from poor households, and (b) local materials that meet the\nrequirements  of  quality  and  economy  will  be  arranged  by  contractors  from  poor\nvillages.  The  Government  will  cause  Fujian  and  Jiangxi  provinces  and  the\ncontractors to implement the poverty reduction programs in the project area, and\nprovide  half  the  unskilled  jobs  for  the  construction  of  station  access  roads  and\nlink roads to poor households. MOR will monitor the impacts on poverty with the\nhelp  of  RI-SJU.  MOR  will  provide  to  ADB  annual  monitoring  reports  of  RI-SJU\nand an evaluation report to be submitted two years after the start of operation.\n\n(x) \n\n \n\n\f34\n\n(xi) \n\nRailway  Operation.  MOR  through  the  Nanchang  and  Shanghai  railway\nadministrations  will  ensure  (a)  efficient  and  economic  management,  day-to-day\noperation, and repair and maintenance of the GLR; (b) provision of an adequate\nnumber of trained staff and resources to meet the GLR's operational needs; and\n(c)  provision  of  sufficient  rolling  stock  (locomotives,  freight  wagons,  and\npassenger  cars)  to  meet  the  demand  for  transportation  on  the  GLR.  MOR  will\nensure  the  safety  of  passengers  and  freight  in  accordance  with  the  PRC\u2019s\nRailway Law.\n\n(xii) \n\nStation Access and Link Roads. The Government will cause Fujian and Jiangxi\nprovinces to take all measures to construct the station access and link roads in a\ntimely manner to maximize the benefits of economic transport to the poor.\n\n(xiii)  Worker Safety and Health. MOR will ensure that measures are taken to ensure\nthe  safety  of  workers  during  construction,  and  contractors  disseminate\ninformation on the risks of socially transmitted diseases to those employed during\nconstruction.\n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB\n99.\nand  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  $200,000,000  to  the  People's  Republic  of\nChina  for  the  Ganzhou-Longyan  Railway  Project  from  ADB's  ordinary  capital  resources,  with\ninterest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  LIBOR-based  loan  facility,  an  amortization\nperiod of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years, and such other terms and conditions as\nare substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the\nBoard.\n\n19 September 2001\n\nTadao Chino\n   President\n\n\f35\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNumber Title\n\nPage\n\nCited on\n(page, para.)\n\nProject Framework\n\nReforms in the Railway Sector\n\nExternal Assistance of World Bank, Japan Bank for\nInternational Cooperation, and Asian Development\nBank to the Railway Sector\n\nLessons Learned from ADB-Financed Railway Projects\n\nTraffic Forecasts\n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nADB-financed Contract Packages\n\nTerms of Reference for International Consulting Services\n\nStation Access and Link Roads\n\nProject Performance Management System\n\nFinancial Performance\n\nSummary of Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\nSummary of the Resettlement Plan\n\nPublic Consultations for the Project\n\nPoverty Reduction Programs\n\nFinancial, Economic, and Distribution Analyses\n\n36\n\n38\n\n41\n\n42\n\n44\n\n45\n\n46\n\n47\n\n48\n\n50\n\n51\n\n53\n\n56\n\n58\n\n61\n\n63\n\n64\n\n70\n\n2, 4\n\n4, 11\n\n6, 19\n\n7, 22\n\n13, 40\n\n14, 45\n\n16, 49\n\n16, 50\n\n17, 52\n\n19, 59\n\n20, 62\n31, 95\n\n20, 65\n\n22, 68\n\n23, 73\n\n25, 80\n\n25, 81\n\n26, 84\n27, 85\n31, 94\n\n28, 87\n\n18\n\nPoverty Impact Analysis\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIXES\n(Available on request)\n\nSummary Environmental Impact Assessment\n\nResettlement Plan\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\nA\n\nB\n\n\f36\n\nAppendix 1, page 1\n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\n\nPerformance\nIndicators/Targets\n\n\u2022  To increase per capita\n\nincomes\n\n\u2022  To reduce the incidence\n\nof rural poverty\n\nMonitoring Mechanisms\n\nRisks/Assumptions\n\n\u2022  Surveys and statistics\nregarding the project\narea at preproject,\npostproject, two years\nafter start of operation\nContents: Gross\ndomestic product per\ncapita, rural net income,\nand poverty incidence\n\n\u2022  Planned development of\nindustries and natural\nresources along the GLR\n\n\u2022  Timely completion of\n\ninfrastructure and within\nbudget\n\n\u2022  Supporting social\n\nprograms\n\n\u2022  Trends in freight and\n\npassenger volumes for\nthe GLR\n\n\u2022  Financial performance\n\nof the GLR\n\u2022  Progress reports\n\u2022  Project administration\n\n(PA) missions\n\n\u2022  Realizing traffic forecasts\n\nfor the GLR\n\n\u2022  The GLR can compete\nsuccessfully with other\ntransport modes\n\nDesign Summary\nGoal\n\u2022  To promote economic\ngrowth and reduce\npoverty in poor areas of\ntwo provinces traversed\nby the Ganzhou-\nLongyan Railway (GLR)\n\nPurpose\n\u2022  Develop rail transport to\nimprove accessibility\nand integrate less\ndeveloped and poor\nareas with more\ndeveloped regions\n\n\u2022  Increase productivity\n\n\u2022  Trends in railway and\n\n\u2022  Progress reports\n\n\u2022  Satisfactory operation and\nmanagement of the GLR\n\nand reduce\ntransportation costs for\ndomestic and\ninternational shippers\n\nroad tariffs\n\n\u2022  Induce industrial and\nnatural resources\ndevelopment\n\n\u2022  Number of\n\ndevelopmental projects\nset up\n\n\u2022  Project performance\nmonitoring system\n\n\u2022  Coordinated economic\n\ngrowth\n\nOutputs\n1.

The  Government  provided\nsupport  by  (i)  allowing  MOR  to  retain  profits  after\nbusiness  tax,  (ii)  reclassifying  the  funds  given  to\nMOR from budget allocation to interest-free loan, (iii)\nincreasing railway tariffs, and (iv) allowing the railway\nto set up diversified economy companies.\n\nturnover. \n\nIn \n\n1989\n\nThe PRC Railway Law was enacted.\n\nfinancial \n\nThe  ECS  changed \nthe \nrelationship\nthe\nthe  Government  and  MOR \nbetween \nin \nfollowing  ways:  (i)  railways  earned  profits  and\ninvested  more  in  infrastructure  construction  and\nrolling stock; (ii) significant investments were made\nto increase capacity in the Seventh Five-Year Plan\n(1986-1990); and (iii) traffic capacity was increased\nby 31 percent in 1990 compared with 1985. As the\nPRC  progressed  to  a  market  economy,  problems\nrelating \nto  customer  service,  marketing,  and\ncompetition  with  other  modes  were  faced  that\naffected  railway  profitability.

Both  freight  and\npassenger  tariffs  have  been  steadily  raised  since\n1995.\n\nTo  finance  new  railways  development,  in  1991  a\nsurcharge  was  levied  on  freight  traffic  that  was\ncredited to a railway construction fund.

Higher tariff for the north-\nsouth corridor including the JJR was accepted.\n\nLoan: After a delayed start due to administrative separation of\nSichuan Province and Chongqing Municipality, physical\nimplementation is progressing satisfactorily.\n\nTA 2578: The TA identified excessive staffing, undercapitalization,\nand underutilization of assets as current problems of local railways in\nSichuan. Organizational commitment to meet customer needs was\nfound lacking. An action plan for reforms in local railways to develop\nthe required business environment is under implementation.\n\nLoan: Implementation of the project started in 1997, and is\nprogressing satisfactorily.\n\nTA 2878: The study made recommendations for efficient commercial\noperation of SXRC and SLRC, including corporatization of SLRC.\nOther areas covered include management information systems,\ntraffic costing and tariffs. Implementation of the action plan under the\nTA is in progress.\n\nTo promote economic growth and\nto create conditions necessary to\nreduce endemic poverty\n\nImplementation of the project started in 1998, and is progressing\nsatisfactorily.\n\n9.

The  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  promote  sustainable\neconomic growth by enhancing transportation capability in a less accessible and mountainous\nregion, create employment and income-enhancing opportunities, and raise incomes and reduce\npoverty.  To  achieve  this  objective,  induced  developments  such  as  value-added  and  labor-\nintensive industries need to be facilitated to the project area. The construction of the GLR will\ncreate  the  conditions  for  a  significant  number  of  companies  to  invest  in  the  area.  From  the\nfinancial perspective of the GLR, it is the industry on the route of the GLR that will generate the\ngreater proportion of the traffic. To capture the potential for economic development and traffic in\nthe  region  and  foster  railway-local  industry  cooperation,  institutional  strengthening  in  railway\nmarket development will be necessary. The purpose of the consulting services will be to assist\nthe  railway  in  defining  what  the  service  should  be,  plan  its  future  operation,  and  assist  in\ncreating appropriate customer-oriented services for the GLR and the connection to Xiamen Port.\nThe  consulting  services  will  review  the  impact  on  the  railway  sector  of  the  country\u2019s\ncommitments for accession to the World Trade Organization.\n\nB. \n\nScope\n\n1. \n\nPart A\n\n2.\n\nThe scope of the consulting services will include the following.\n\n3.\nThe consultants will (i) determine the level of industry and market development expertise\nin  the  Nanchang  and  Shanghai  railway  administrations;  (ii)  determine  the  programs  and\nincentives  available  for  attracting  industry  at  the  county,  prefecture,  and  province  levels;  (iii)\nmeet with a selection of potential shippers located or planning to locate along the route of the\nGLR;  (iv)  meet  with  officials  of  Xiamen  Port  and  the  railway  serving  the  port,  to  determine\ncurrent  operations  and  future  inland  transport  requirements;  (v)  develop  plans  for  improving\nrailway  services,  in  particular  intermodal  services;  (vi)  propose  measures  to  develop  industrial\nsidings;  (vii)  develop  a  plan  for  supplying  special  purpose  wagons  to  attract  industry  to  the\nproject  area;  and  (viii)  improve  marketing  of  railway  services  to  industries,  specifically  for  the\nGLR and Xiamen Port.\n\n4.\nThe  consulting  services  will  develop  suitable  training  programs  in  the  country  and  a\nforeign  country  where  successful  industrial  and  railway  marketing  programs  are  in  place.  The\nforeign training program will be for eight key railway staff, four from MOR and two each from the\nNanchang  and  Shanghai  railway  administrations.  The  trainees  will  specifically  study  the\nfollowing: (i) operating intermodal container services, with specific attention to intermodal hubs\nand  dedicated  container  trains;  (ii)  serving  shippers  directly  with  industrial  sidings  as  well  as\ntracks to industrial parks; (iii) economics and financing of special purpose wagons; (iv) overall\nrailway  operation  in  Xiamen  Port  with  particular  reference  to  bulk  transportation  of  grain,\ncement, sugar, and other products that are applicable to the GLR and the port; (v) developing\nindustries  and  the  various  approaches  to  attracting  industries  to  locate  along  the  railway;  and\n(vi) marketing of railway services to potential shippers.\n\n\f49\n\nAppendix 9, page 2\n\n2. \n\nPart B\n\n5.\nUnder the country\u2019s commitments for accession to the World Trade Organization, foreign\ninvestors would be able to (i) acquire minority shareholding in joint ventures for freight services\nafter  the  PRC's  accession  to  the  WTO,  (ii)  acquire  majority  shareholding  within  three  years\nthereafter,  and  (iii)  set  up  solely  foreign-owned  companies  within  another  three  years.  This\ntransition needs to be factored in to future restructuring of the national railway. The consulting\nservices will evaluate the existing competitive strengths and weaknesses of the national railway\nin  the  light  of  imminent  entry  of  foreign  operators  in  the  rail  freight  transport  market.  Strategic\noptions for railway administrations, including establishing partnerships with foreign operators will\nbe identified. Possible benefits and risks of railway administration-foreign operator partnerships\nwill  be  analyzed  and  measures  will  be  recommended  for  mitigating  risks.  The  consulting\nservices  will  evaluate  the  implications  to  the  competitiveness  and  financial  viability  of  the\nnational  railway  of  allowing  majority  and  eventually  full  foreign  ownership  of  railway  freight\noperation.  Considering  these  and  other  competitive  developments,  the  consulting  services  will\npropose  various  institutional,  operating,  and  technical  options,  while  evaluating  alternative\nstructural  reforms.  The  consulting  services  will  evaluate  the  implications  of  the  country\u2019s\naccession  to  the  World  Trade  Organization  on  the  railway  sector,  and  propose  measures  for\nmaximizing the benefits of foreign operator entry into the railway freight transport market.\n\nC. \n\nExpertise and Cost Estimates\n\n6.\nAbout  eight  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  will  be  engaged  in\naccordance with the ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The international consultants\nwill  have  expertise  in  industrial  development  and  marketing,  international  trade,  and  railway\noperation. The loan will finance the services of international consultants and the cost of foreign\ntraining of key railway staff for a total of eight staff-months.\n\nMOR will (i) assign appropriate counterpart staff to liaise with and facilitate the work of\n7.\nconsulting  services;  (ii)  provide  suitable  office  accommodation  and  communication  facilities\ncommensurate  with  the  requirement;  (iii)  assist  the  consultants  in  scheduling  field  visits  and\ndiscussions  with  field  agencies  in  connection  with  the  study;  and  (iv)  provide  all  facilities,\ndocumentation, and assistance as may be reasonably requested by the consultants to complete\nthe work.\n\n\f50\n\nAppendix 10\n\nSTATION ACCESS AND LINK ROADS\n\nLength\n(km)\n\nCost\n($ million)\n\nCounty/Location\nA.

The  main\nassumptions  for  the  financial  statements  are  as  follows:  (i)  freight  tariff,  including  railway\nconstruction  fund  (RCF)  surcharge,  are  assumed  to  remain  constant  in  real  terms;  unit  freight\nrevenue was assumed lower than the nominal freight tariff due to reduced tariffs applicable to\nsome commodities; (ii) unit passenger revenue is taken at 50 percent higher than the nominal\ntariff  for  hard  seat  because  of  additional  charges  for  value-added  services  such  as  higher\nspeed,  air-conditioning,  and  soft  and  sleeper  seats;  and  passenger  revenue  was  assumed  to\nannually  increase  in  real  terms  by  5  percent  up  to  2006  and  1.5  percent  thereafter  for  value-\nadded services;2 (iii) working expenses are assumed to increase according to domestic inflation,\nand traffic volume and real increase were assumed in line with the historical trend of each cost\ncomponent between 1992 and 1999; (iv) annual depreciation expenses are computed based on\neach  asset\u2019s  economic  life;  and  (v)  financial  expenses  are  calculated  based  on  assumed\ninterest  rate  and  outstanding  borrowings;  business  tax  of  3.24  percent  on  the  gross  revenue;\nand income tax of 33 percent on profit before tax that exceeds the accumulated loss.\n\n2. \nThe financial statements of the GLR (Table A12.1) were prepared on a pro-forma basis\nfor 10 years from 2002 to 2011 according to the assumed financing plan, terms and conditions,\nconstruction  schedule,  revenue  based  on  the  forecast  traffic,  tariff,  and  the  estimated  costs.\nAnnual  asset  revaluation  is  assumed.  Sufficient  cash  flow  and  sound  operations3  are  forecast\nfor the project life.\n\n3. \nThe financial statements of MOR (Table A12.2) include actual figures from 1997 to 1999\nand  tentative  figures  for  2000,  and  consider  MOR\u2019s  investment  plan,  and  are  adjusted  to\ninternational accounting practices. These were based on the following additional assumptions:\n(i) staff reduction is assumed at 0.75 percent per year to result in 21.6 employees per route-km\nat  the  end  of  2010  compared  with  34  and  25.6  in  1997  and  1999;  (ii)  freight  and  passenger\ntraffic are assumed to grow annually by 1.5 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively; (iii) no capital\ninfusion  or  subsidy  by  the  Government  is  assumed;  (iv)  nominal  freight  tariff  for  2001  is\nassumed  at  Y0.0791  per  ton-km,  including  Y0.33  per  ton-km  of  railway  construction  fund\nsurcharge and the assumed unit passenger revenue for 2001 is Y0.0875 per passenger-km,4 or\n49  percent  more  than  the  hard  seat  rate;  (v)  annual  net  profits  derived  from  the  enterprises\nunder the diversified economy program are assumed based on the net return on assets of the\nenterprises; (vi) the divestment of nontransportation entities in September 2000 is reflected as\nestimates,  which  would  reduce  losses  in  nonoperating  expenses  from  2001  onward;  and  (vii)\ninterest  rates  for  domestic  and  foreign  loans  are  assumed  at  6.2  percent  and  6.5  percent  per\nyear with repayment period of 12 years and 20 years, respectively.\n\n                                                          \n1 Domestic inflation is assumed at 2.5 percent for 2002, 3 percent for 2003, 3.3 percent from 2004 to 2006, and to\nvary  from  3.5  percent  to  2.2  percent  between  2007  and  2026.  International  inflation  is  forecast  at  2  percent  for\n2002, 2.2 percent for 2003, 2.3 percent for 2004, 2.4 percent from 2005 to 2008, and to vary from 2.3 percent to 2\npercent between 2009 and 2026.\n\n2 The historical trend of annual real increase of passenger unit revenue was approximately 5 percent since 1996.\n3  Average and minimum debt service coverage ratio for the first 10 years are 1.6 and 1.2, respectively, and operating\nratio for 20 years is 51.8 percent on average. These indicators are sustainable in the tested adverse scenarios.\n4 The  latest  applicable  nominal  freight  tariff  per  ton-km  since  July  2000  was  Y0.0791,  including  Y0.033  of  RCF\n\nsurcharge, and Y0.0586 per passenger-km for a hard seat.\n\n\fItem/Year \nOperational Statistics \nFreight Ton-Km (million)\nPassenger  Pas-Km (million)\nAverage Freight Unit Revenue/Ton-km

An  additional  200  ha  will  be  acquired  for  temporary  use\nduring construction. Forty-three percent of the permanently acquired land and 12 percent of the\ntemporary  land  is  agricultural  land.  About  460,000  square  meters  (m2)  of  buildings  will  be\nremoved for construction purposes. Most of the buildings to be demolished are farmers\u2019 houses\nand  outbuildings.  Loss  of  land  or  housing,  or  both,  will  affect  about  19,340  people  in  4,300\nhouseholds.  The  number  of  affected  people  constitutes  less  than  one  half  of  1  percent  of  the\ntotal population of 4.1 million in the counties and districts on the route of the GLR. The proposed\nalignment was selected from various alternatives to minimize acquisition of farmland as well as\nminimize  involuntary  resettlement  in  rural  and  urban  areas.  The  design  includes  viaducts  and\nbridges,  overpasses,  and  underpasses  to  reduce  the  requirement  of  land  for  right-of-way  and\nminimize disrupting effects on the local community. The alignment and stations locations were\ndiscussed  with  local  officials,  representatives  of  villages  and  a  selection  of  farmers.  The\nselected alignment is both socially responsible and economically efficient.\n\n2.\nFor  the  people  affected  by  the  Project,  the  Ministry  of  Railways  (MOR),  the  Executing\nAgency,  prepared  a  resettlement  plan  (RP)  in  accordance  with  the  1998  Land  Administration\nLaw of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The RP was refined by the consultant under the\nproject  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)2  to  address  the  concerns  of  the  Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and incorporate the results of a socioeconomic sample survey carried\nout under the TA. The RP meets ADB's requirements for involuntary resettlement. As required\nby ADB, copies of the RP, in Chinese, were provided on 10 March 2001, to the counties and the\nrailway construction support offices (RCSOs)3 for information of the affected people. To ensure\nthat  affected  people  are  made  aware  of  their  rights  regarding  compensation,  relocation,  and\nprotection of their economic security, a resettlement information booklet was prepared by MOR\nand distributed by local governments to the villages and townships along the GLR on 23 March\n2001.\n\nB. \n\nSocioeconomic Analysis\n\nAs  part  of  project  preparation,  a  socioeconomic  analysis  was  carried  out  with  the\n3.\nparticipation  of  local  officials,  project  beneficiaries,  and  people  affected  by  the  Project.  A\nsocioeconomic  sample  household  survey  was  carried  out  by  the  TA  consultant  in  association\nwith the Fourth Survey and Design Institute during June-December 2000. During this period the\nviews and concerns of the affected people were sought several times. Except Ganxian County\nand Xinlou District at the ends of the GLR, the remaining six intermediate counties are poverty\ncounties. The incidence of rural poverty in the project area based on rural per capita income of\nY1,000 per year was 21 percent. No indigenous people lived along the alignment. Less than 1.5\npercent  of  the  people  were  nonindigenous  members  of  minority  nationalities  who  are\neconomically and socially integrated and not disadvantaged compared with their Han (majority)\n\n                  \n\n1 The  eight  counties/district  are  Ganxian,  Huichang,  Ruijin,  and  Yudu  counties  in  Ganzhou  City  (prefecture  level);\n\nand Changting, Liancheng, and Shanghang counties and Xinlou District in Longyan City (prefecture level).\n\n2 TA 3486-PRC: Ganzhou-Longyan Railway Project, for $750,000, approved on 30 August 2000.\n3 The  involved  prefectures  and  counties  have  set  up  RCSOs  to  facilitate  acquiring  land,  relocating  buildings,  and\n\nother resettlement activities.\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 14, page 2\n\nneighbors.  The  local  people  strongly  support  the  Project.  Ninety-six  percent  of  households\nsurveyed favored the Project. Local people, especially in the six intermediate counties that do\nnot  have  railway  transport  service,  see  the  GLR  as  the  key  to  greater  mobility,  economic\ndevelopment, and prosperity.\n\nC. \n\nResettlement Plan\n\n4.\nThe  primary  objective  of  the  RP  is  to  restore  the  income  and  living  standards  of  the\naffected  people  within  a  short  period  after  resettlement,  with  as  little  disruption  as  possible  to\ntheir  economic  and  social  environment.  The  RP  has  set  out  criteria  for  identifying  project\naffected people, including those who might be affected by the acquisition of resettlement land,\nand  access  and  link  roads.  Provision  of  compensation  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is\nbased  on  the  agreements  between  MOR  and  Jiangxi  and  Fujian  provinces,  which  follow  the\nPRC's  Land  Administration  Law  and  provincial  regulations.  The  RP  includes  an  entitlement\nmatrix to compensate affected people based on the nature of losses and includes compensation\nfor  loss  of  buildings,  costs  of  relocation,  acquiring  replacement  land,  loss  of  crops  and  of\nincome-producing trees, costs of relocating graves and tombs, and subsistence allowance due\nto loss of income or wages during the transition. The RP provides for alternative employment,\nassistance  for  those  desiring  to  begin  or  improve  small  business  activities,  and  assistance\nduring relocation.\n\n5.\nShort-  and  long-term  strategies  envisaged  in  the  RP  will  provide  access  to  land  and\nemployment  so  that  the  affected  people  can  regain  and  improve  their  livelihoods  in  the\npostresettlement period. The strategies will allow them to benefit from the Project by exploiting\nthe  commercial  and  economic  opportunities  it  induces.  Should  people  experience  particular\nhardship  in  restoring  their  livelihood,  the  monitoring  teams  and  local  government  officials  will\nprovide necessary assistance. In addition, several avenues for redressing grievances (through\nlocal land administration bureaus, local governments, MOR, and law courts) are available under\nthe PRC law. Where necessary, the affected people will be assisted by increased resettlement\nsubsidy as specified in the 1998 PRC Land Administration Law. The RP will ensure that project-\naffected people receive assistance so that they are at least as well off as they would have been\nin the absence of the Project.\n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates\n\n6.\nThe  cost  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  including  contingencies,  is  estimated  at\nY313.7 million ($38 million equivalent). The amount is included in the project cost estimates and\nwill be financed by MOR, including any cost overrun to meet the objectives of the RP.\n\nE. \n\nOrganization and Implementation\n\nfor \n\nimplementing \n\nthe  RP.  The \n\nMOR  will  have \n\nlead  responsibility \n\n7.\ninstitutional\nresponsibility  for  implementing  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  rest  with  the  provinces,\nprefectures,  and  counties  traversed  by  the  GLR.  MOR  will  pay  compensation  to  the\ngovernments  of  the  two  provinces  crossed  by  the  GLR.  The  provinces  will  compensate  the\nrelevant  local  governments,  which  deal  directly  with  the  affected  individuals  and  village\ncollectives.  The  RCSOs  are  in  charge  of  plans  for  land  acquisition,  and  compensation,\ndisbursing  compensation \nland\nadministration bureaus are in charge of acquiring land, surveying, recording the area involved,\nand  categorizing  land  into  quality  levels.  Periodic  resettlers\u2019  meetings  will  be  held  at  the  local\nlevel to discuss the RP, the implementation schedule, policies, and standards of compensation;\n\nresettlement.  The  county \n\nreceived,  and \n\nimplementing \n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 14, page 3\n\nand  to  receive  feedback  from  the  affected  people.  Local  units  of  the  All  China  Women\u2019s\nFederation will participate in the process to ensure that the needs of women, particularly women\nwho head a household, are understood and met at all stages of the process.\n\nBuilding the 277 km GLR will be carried out under 19 contract sections. Construction of\n8.\ndifferent contract sections will be started in early 2002 after the award of civil works contracts.\nThe  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  implementation  timetable  will  match  the  civil  works\nconstruction.  Land  acquisition  will  be  done  before  civil  works  construction  is  started,  and\nsufficient  time  will  be  allowed  for  the  removal  and  reconstruction  of  new  housing.  Detailed\nidentification and classification of land to be acquired will be started in April 2001, followed by\nquantifying  of  housing  and  attachments,  public  consultation  and  negotiation  with  the  affected\npersons,  and  preparation  of  compensation  and  resettlement  details.  Disbursement  of\nto  removal  and\ncompensation  and  housing  restoration  will \nreconstruction  with  anticipated  completion  times  and  primary  institutional  responsibilities  are\ndetailed in the RP.\n\nfollow.  Activities  related \n\nLocal  officials  are  experienced  in  resettlement  and  compensation.  Most  counties  and\n9.\nboth prefectures have just completed resettlement related to the upgrading and reconstruction\nof  national  highways  323  and  319,  which  parallel  much  of  the  GLR.  In  addition,  officials  in\nLongyan  Prefecture  have  experience  with  resettlement  for  the  ADB-funded  hydroelectric\nproject,4  as  well  as  for  the  Longyan-Meizhou  Railway.  Ganzhou  Prefecture  officials  have\nresettlement  experience  with  the  Jingjiu  Railway.5  Local  officials  are  familiar  with  the  Land\nAdministration  Law,  and  provincial  regulations  and  are  committed  to  realizing  its  principles.\nBecause  of  the  detailed  planning  done  and  consultation  with  affected  persons,  no  significant\nproblems are envisaged in acquiring land and resettling the affected persons.\n\nF. \n\nMonitoring\n\nMOR  will  report  the  progress  on  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  to  ADB  through  the\n10.\nquarterly  progress  reports  on  project  implementation.

The  financial,  economic,  and  distribution  analyses  for  the  Ganzhou-Longyan\nRailway (GLR) Project was conducted for 5 years of the construction period from 2002 to 2006\nand 20 years of operation from 2007 to 2026, in 2001 constant prices.1\n\n2.\nFinancial Evaluation. The financial internal rate of return was calculated based on the\ncapital costs for the Project covered by the cost estimates and rolling stock, the revenue stream\nfrom  the  assumed  traffic  and  tariff,  the  recurring  costs,  and  the  taxes  paid  (Tables  A17.1  and\nA17.2).  The  capital  costs  include  physical  contingency  and  construction  of  additional  stations\nscheduled  in  2011  and  2016,  but  excludes  the  financial  charges  during  construction  and\nchanges in working capital.\n\n3.\nTo  achieve  full  cost  recovery  nominal  freight  tariff  is  assumed  at  Y0.2143  per  ton-\nkilometer  (km)  (providing  unit  freight  revenue  of  Y0.205  per  ton-km),  including  railway\nconstruction fund (RCF) surcharge of Y0.033 per ton-km (providing RCF surcharge revenue of\nY0.032  per  ton-km).  The  passenger  unit  revenue  is  assumed  at  Y0.1133  per  passenger-km\nreflecting  a  real  increase  of  5  percent  per  year  up  to  2006  and  1.5  percent  thereafter.2  The\nweighted  average  cost  of  capital  was  calculated  at  3.4  percent  based  on  the  after-tax  real\ninterest rate of each debt,3 including 0.18 percent of the annualized front-end fee for the Asian\nDevelopment Bank loan and the opportunity cost for the RCF.\n\n4.\nEconomic Evaluation. The economic internal rate of return was calculated based on a\ncomparison  of  with-  and  without-project  scenarios  (Tables  A17.2  and  A17.3).  The  economic\ncosts and benefits were presented in the domestic numeraire. The economic costs include the\nrailway  construction  and  operating  costs  and  those  for  the  station  access  roads  and  the  link\nroads.  Each  cost  component,  divided  into  tradable  and  nontradable,  was  calculated  from\nfinancial  prices  by  using  the  corresponding  conversion  factor  and  a  shadow  exchange  rate\nfactor of 1.08 applicable for tradable goods. The opportunity cost was estimated at 0.75 and 1.0\nof the wages for unskilled and skilled labor. Land opportunity cost, which is represented as the\neconomic value of land, was computed annually taking into account the productivity increases of\ncultivated land by different types of land use.\n\n5.\nThe  transport  economic  benefits  consist  of  (i)  operating  cost  saving  in  diverted  freight\nand  passenger  traffic  from  existing  railway  routes  and  roads;  the  difference  of  net  economic\noperating cost per ton-km between the GLR and the roads was Y0.245 per ton-km and Y0.0752\nper passenger-km in the base case; (ii) operating cost saving in generated passengers in local\nand  interline  traffic  calculated  by  the  estimated  passenger-km  multiplied  by  one  half  of  the\nsavings of the economic operating cost between the railway and the buses; (iii) time saving in\ndiverted passenger traffic from the existing railway and buses operating at 35 km per hour on\naverage, based on the value of time per passenger-km estimated from the average net income\nof rural people in each province; and (iv) the net economic value in the project area calculated\n                                                          \n1 As project physical completion is scheduled in mid-2006, followed by a half-year of trial operation. Revenue from\nthe half-year trial operation was excluded, but the half-year expenses were reflected as the cost for preparation of\ncommercial operation.\n\n2 Considering  the  socioeconomic  situation  and  affordability  by  poor  people  the  passenger  tariff  for  a  hard  seat  is\nassumed to remain constant. For 2006, the unit passenger revenue is estimated to be higher than the hard seat\ntariff by 93.4 percent, ranging from 86 percent for local traffic and 112 percent for transit traffic.\n\n3 The interest rate for the ADB loan is assumed at 6.9 percent, which is an interpolated 25-year fixed rate interest\nbased on the current swap market. The China Development Bank loan will carry an interest rate of 5.9 percent per\nannum. The opportunity cost of the RCF is taken at  8 percent  assuming the 25-year swap-based fixed rate plus\nrisk premium to be offered to the PRC Government in the current market.\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 17, page 2\n\nbased  on  the  economic  value  per  additional  ton  of  each  commodity  of  generated  traffic  as  a\nresult  of  the  construction  of  the  GLR.  The  production  of  commodities  was  estimated  from  a\nstudy of the envisaged expansion and setting up of new industries in each county. Time saving\nin diverted freight traffic from the railway was negative as the GLR causes an additional length\nof  haul  to  the  national  network  for  2007  onward,  although  it  is  insignificant.  Similarly,  during\ninitial years of project operation time dissaving occurs in the diversion from the roads due to the\ndifference of average speed between trucks (50 km per hour) and the GLR (40 km per hour)4\nbased on the assumed same length of haul for both transportation means.\n\nWithout the GLR, the national highways 323 and 3195 will be considerably burdened. As\n6.\nmost trucks are heavily loaded, the road degradation is fast and significant. The costs of road\nimprovements  necessary  to  accommodate  the  assumed  growth  of  traffic6  was  included  as\navoided  maintenance  costs  for  roads.  Ganzhou  and  Longyan  local  governments  will  upgrade\n570  km  of  existing  link  and  county  roads  to  facilitate  the  access  to  the  GLR  stations.7  The\nbenefits  derived  from  vehicle  operating  cost  saving  are  25  percent  of  the  economic  operating\ncost due to the improved road conditions multiplied by generated freight traffic discounted at the\nassigned  rate  for  Longyan\u2019s  link  roads.  Due  to  the  number  of  overloaded  trucks  and\nmountainous topography, the existing roads are prone to accidents. Avoided accident costs in\ntraffic diverted from roads were calculated only for fatal accidents, which were assumed to have\nan incidence of 1.2 fatal accidents per million vehicle-km.\n\n7.\nEconomic  development  in  the  GLR  station  areas  was  quantified  through  the  net\neconomic  value  based  on  the  estimated  earnings  per  square  meter  along  the  station  access\nroads.8 Approximately 30 percent was ascribed to the GLR. Incremental tourists are considered\nas another source of economic benefits for the project area. Each tourist is assumed to spend\nabout Y500 per day in the project area. The incremental tourism income was multiplied by 19.3\npercent  representing  operating  surplus  and  taxes  in  the  sector  and  further  by  7  percent  as  a\nshare of the GLR. The environmental benefits from saving of emission of nitrogen oxides that\nwould have been caused by the transportation by truck were not included.\n\n8.\nDistribution  Analysis.  The  distribution  of  project  benefits  was  analyzed  to  determine\nthe extent to which the Project benefits poor people (Tables A17.4 and A17.5). The distribution\nanalysis brings out the differences between the financial and economic values arising from the\nProject,  which  have  been  reflected  as  distributional  impacts  to  various  beneficiaries.  The  net\nfinancial  return  to  MOR,  and  the  difference  between  net  economic  benefits  and  net  financial\nbenefits was disaggregated for poor people in the project area, and the Project\u2019s poverty impact\nratio was evaluated.\n\n                                                          \n4 The calculated time dissaving for freight is multiplied by the economic value of each commodity and the opportunity\n\ncost ranging from 2.5 to 8.5 percent per annum.\n\n5 The national highways are located within a few kilometers of the GLR.\n6 Without  the  GLR,  freight  traffic  to  be  carried  on  roads  in  the  eight  on-route  counties/district  is  estimated  at  12.2\n\nmillion tons for 2006, 16.3 million tons for 2011, and 21.8 million tons for 2016.\n\n7 Unit cost per km for upgrading the local roads is estimated at $0.25 million and 10 percent of the cost is assignable\nto  the  GLR.  As  the  Ganzhou  local  government  has  already  improved  70  percent  of  the  link  roads  to  all-weather\ntype, no benefits were counted for the link roads in Ganzhou.\n\n8 Local governments collect annual lease charges ranging between Y0.45 to Y0.75 per square meter.\n\n\fTable A17.1: Financial Internal Rate of Return\n(Y million)\n\nOperating and\nOther

Benefits to the poor are\n             disaggregated in the following proportions: (i) for MOR, the Government, and the lenders = the national incidence of poverty based on rural per capita income of\n             Y1,000 per year (12 percent); (ii) for local government = the incidence of poverty based on rural per capita income of Y1,000 per year in the project area (21 percent);\n              (iii) for local economy = same as (ii) except that it was reduced by 20 percent considering that benefits may not reach some poor people in remote areas\n              (16.5 percent); (iv) for project users = the weighted average of the incidence of poverty for different types of traffic (freight and passenger, diverted) and reduced \n              20 percent, same as for item (iii); the national incidence of poverty (12.0 percent) is used for diverted traffic beneficiaries; the incidence of generated poverty in\n              the project area (21 percent) was applied to freight beneficiaries, reduced by 20 percent (15.6 percent); and (v) for local labor, the special measures under the \n              Project require that 50 percent of the unskilled labor for construction will be sourced from the poor households (50 percent). The difference between the \n              financial wages and its economic value was allocated to local labor after the validation of data against the estimated wages during construction and operation of\n              the  GLR to quantitatively reflect the measures under the Project for employment opportunities to unskilled labor.\nSource: Staff estimates.\n\ni\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n7\n,\n \np\na\ng\ne\n \n6\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 18, page 1\n\nA. \n\nIntroduction\n\nPOVERTY IMPACT ANALYSIS\n\nThe  Government  has  prioritized  the  277  kilometer  (km)  Ganzhou-Longyan  Railway\n1.\n(GLR) Project as a poverty reduction project in the Tenth Five-Year Plan (2001-2005). The GLR\ntraverses  eight  counties/district,1  situated  in  a  mountainous  area  that  is  less  developed  and\npoor.  The  Ministry  of  Railways  (MOR)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  and  the  Nanchang  and\nShanghai railway administrations will construct the GLR and operate it in their jurisdiction. The\nGLR  will \nthe  necessary\ninfrastructure, (ii) improving access to wider markets, and (iii) encouraging labor mobility. Cash\ncrops,  agricultural  processing,  tourism  industry,  as  well  as  service-oriented  activities  in  the\nregion  will  particularly  benefit  from  the  GLR.  Incremental  economic  activities  derived  from  the\nrailway will increase fiscal revenue to the local governments. This will expand local government\nresources  to  improve  basic  education,  basic  health,  and  other  social  programs  for  the  poor,\nwhich account for more than 50 percent of their fiscal expenditures.\n\nfacilitate  sustainable  economic  development  by  (i)  providing \n\nB. \n\nPoverty Reduction\n\n2.\nThe achievements of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) with reducing poverty have\nbeen  exemplary  with  one  of  the  best  success  records  in  the  world  over  the  last  two  decades.\nThe number of rural poor (with income less than Y635 per capita per year) decreased from 260\nmillion  in  1978  to  about  80  million  in  1994.  Since  the  beginning  of  the  Government's  Eight-\nSeven  Poverty  Reduction  Program  in  1994,2  poverty  has  been  significantly  reduced  from  80\nmillion people in 1994 to an estimated 30 million poor in 2001.\n\n3.\nThe  PRC\u2019s  general  success  in  poverty  reduction  efforts  can  be  explained  by  the  wide\nvariety  of  programs  and  funding  channels  involved  in  the  effort.  Poverty  reduction  is\nmainstreamed  among  most  central  and  local  ministries,  and  an  obligation  for  private  sector\ninvestment and institutional partnerships. The national poverty reduction effort is coordinated by\nthe Leading Group for Poverty Reduction of the State Council. Government agencies are guided\nby  three  overarching  objectives:  (i)  improving  the  subsistence  standards  of  the  poor  (e.g.,\nincome,  land,  employment  opportunities,  and  other  income-generating  opportunities);  (ii)\nimproving rural infrastructure for the poor; and (iii) providing essential social services. A major\nreason  of  the  success  in  poverty  reduction  stems  from  this  equity  approach.  The  strong\ncommitment of the Government to poverty reduction, increased annual budgetary allocations to\npoverty programs, and institutional accountability are other factors critical to the PRC's success\nin reducing poverty.\n\nThe  Government  is  pursuing  the  poverty  reduction  objectives  through  the  Tenth  Five-\n\n4.\nYear Plan (2001-2005) and the Ten-Year Poverty Reduction Strategy approved in 2001.\n\nC. \n\nPoverty Impact Analysis\n\nGeneral Approach. The detailed poverty impact analysis carried out for the Project was\n5.\nbuilt  on  the  experience  with  previous  projects  with  particular  reference  to  the  policies  and\n\n                  \n\n1  The eight counties/district are Ganxian, Yudu, Huichang, and Ruijin counties in Ganzhou City (prefecture level; and\n\nChangting, Liancheng, and Shanghang counties and Xinlou District in Longyan City (prefecture level).\n\n2  This  program  recognized  592  national-level  poverty  counties  nationwide  to  which  the  poverty  reduction  efforts  and\n\nfunds were directed.\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 18, page 2\n\nprograms  that  facilitate  employment  and  income  generation  for  the  poor.  The  analysis  was\nbased  on  the  exclusive  work  done  under  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA),  3\nincluding the results of a sample household survey, and discussions by ADB missions with local\ngovernments. Qualitative and quantitative assessments were made of the impact of the Project\non the poor. Links were established between the project intervention and associated programs\nfor  poverty  reduction.  The  qualitative  assessment  is  supported  by  the  quantitative  analysis,\nwhich follows the relevant guidelines for social, financial, and economic analyses, with particular\nattention  to  distributional  effects  of  the  project  benefits.  The  financial  and  economic  analyses\nhave been brought together through the distribution analysis, and the net economic benefits of\ndifferent  stakeholders  were  assessed.  Poverty  outcomes  have  been  considered  in  the  project\ndesign and specific measures have been incorporated to ensure that the envisaged benefits will\nbe passed on to the poor.\n\n6.\nPoverty  Situation.  The  area  traversed  by  the  GLR  in  western  Fujian  and  southern\nJiangxi  has  poor  accessibility  and  is  less  developed;  the  people  are  poor.  Except  for  Ganxian\nCounty and Xinlou District at the ends of the GLR, the remaining six intermediate counties are\nnational-level  poverty  counties  with  the  exception  of  Ruijin,  which  is  a  provincial-level  poverty\ncounty. Official statistics of the eight involved counties/district give the incidence of rural poverty\nbased on per capita rural income of Y1,000 per year at 21 percent compared with 12 percent\nnationwide. Since the Project is beneficiary nonspecific, therefore in accordance with the criteria\nset out in ADB's loan classification system the Project has poverty classification of other.4 The\nProject supports the thematic priority of economic growth.\n\n7.\nResults  of  Sample  Household  Survey.  The  sample  household  survey  (of  1,000\nhouseholds) done under the TA, showed a high incidence of rural poverty along the GLR. The\nsurvey  shows  that  having  a  wage-earning  member  in  the  household  is  important  to  raise\nhousehold  income.

The Project will provide economic railway\npassenger  and  freight  services  to  some  counties  and  townships  for  the  first  time,  thereby\ncreating  the  opportunities  for  the  economic  and  social  development  to  significantly  reduce\npoverty. The Project will facilitate the development of natural resources and industries, thereby\ncreating  employment.  Substantial  opportunities  for  employment  will  be  passed  on  to  the\nunskilled  workers  in  the  area,  and  support  the  efforts  of  local  governments  to  provide  an\nenvironment in which new opportunities are created for the poor to raise themselves above the\npoverty line.\n\nThe  Project  will  reduce  poverty  by  (i)  providing  employment  opportunities  during  the\n13.\nconstruction and operation of the GLR, (ii) providing employment opportunities in poor villages\nfrom which suitable local materials will be supplied and transported, (iii) supporting the chain of\nsocial and economic improvements brought by the poverty reduction strategy, and (iv) fostering\ntourism  by  facilitating  cheap  and  convenient  travel  from  other  parts  of  the  PRC.  The\nemployment created by the GLR will be (i) direct\u2014to support the tasks and functions related to\nGLR construction and operation, and (ii) indirect\u2014created by suppliers of goods and services to\nthe railway, and employment created throughout the economy by the multiplier effects of direct\nbenefits.  The  estimates  of  employment  are  based  on  the  study  under  the  TA  as  well  as  a\ncomprehensive input-output analysis of the PRC economy.\n\n14.\nEmployment  During  Construction.  For  civil  works  construction,  the  contractors  will\nhire at least 50 percent of their unskilled workers from the list of poor households maintained by\nthe villages and poverty reduction offices.5 The benefit will be distributed to poor households in\nremote  villages  because  contractors  will  be  required  to  engage  30  percent  of  the  total\nrequirement  of  unskilled  workers  from  remote  villages.  Construction  of  the  GLR  will  create  a\ntotal  of  76,000  person-years  of  unskilled  employment,  38,000  of  which  will  go  to  poor\nhouseholds.  An  additional  benefit  of  this  type  of  employment  is  the  on-the-job  training  that\ncomes  with  it.  Each  worker  will  be  able  to  seek  other  construction  work  with  experience  and\nskills learned on the GLR. The county poverty reduction offices will tailor some of their programs\nto  ensure  follow-up  of  households  that  gain  additional  income  to  ensure  sustained  gains  from\nemployment.\n\n15.\nConstruction of the GLR requires a large investment in materials and supplies. Materials\nthat meet the requirements of quality and economy will be procured from the poverty villages.6\nFor materials that are locally produced, at least 30 percent of the labor component is assumed\nto  benefit  poor  households.7  The  Project  is  estimated  to  create  a  total  of  about  20,200  new\nindirect person-years of employment to produce the required materials; 6,150 of these will go to\nworkers  from  poor  households.  Materials  supplied  from  other  parts  of  the  PRC  will  create\n10,070  person-years  of  employment;  of  which  1,200  person-years  will  go  to  poor  households\n\n                  \n\n5  During the field visit the Mission confirmed that the villages in both Longyan and Ganzhou prefectures maintain lists\nof poor households, which are used to prioritize employment to the poorest. MOR and the Nanchang and Shanghai\nrailway  administrations,  the  implementing  agencies,  assured  that  at  least  50  percent  of  the  total  requirement  of\nunskilled labor will be engaged from the lists of poor households in consultation with the railway construction support\noffices.\n\n6 Based on the distribution of natural resources along the GLR alignment, about 30 exploitation sites for the supply of\nsand and stone will be established to meet the needs of the GLR. The value of the labor is paid to the worker and the\nvillage retains the value of the materials.\n\n7 This  assumption  is  based  on  the  assurance  by  the  local  governments  and  the  experience  gained  on  previous\n\ninfrastructure projects in this region.\n\n\f74\n\nAppendix 18, page 5\n\nbased on the poverty incidence of 12 percent for the PRC as a whole. Local governments will\nbuild station access and link roads that connect remote and poor areas to the railway to capture\nthe benefits from the GLR. The construction of the roads will require about 3,300 person-years\nof  unskilled  labor.  Assuming  that  poor  households  would  do  50  percent  of  the  work,8  about\n1,660 person-years of new employment will be generated.\n\n16.\nIn  summary,  during  the  five-year  construction  period,  the  Project  will  utilize  a  total  of\n76,000  person-years  of  direct  unskilled  employment  and  33,600  person-years  of  indirect\nemployment. Of these a total of 47,500 person-years of employment will be provided to those\nfrom poor households.\n\n17.\nEmployment  during  Operation.  Staff  for  operation  of  the  GLR  (about  2,500)  will  be\nprovided  by  MOR  by  transferring  surplus  staff  from  elsewhere  in  the  network  under  its  staff\nreduction  program.  Spending  by  the  railway  employees  and  their  families  will  have  multiplier\neffects  in  the  local  economies.  The  GLR  will  hire  contract  workers  to  load  and  unload  freight\nwagons  and  to  work  as  security  guards  for  the  stations  and  warehouses.  Of  the  total\nrequirement  for  unskilled  workers  in  these  categories,  70  percent  will  be  hired  from  poor\nhouseholds. Based on the estimates of diverted and generated traffic for the GLR, the number\nof contract workers required was estimated at 2,866 in 2007 and 8,510 in 2026. This would total\nabout  103,400  person-years  of  employment  during  the  20-year  period  from  2007  to  2026,  of\nwhich 70 percent or 72,350 person-years will be passed on to poor households.\n\n18.\nAmong  the  categories  of  freight  traffic  carried  by  the  GLR  is  generated  traffic,  which\nconsists of goods that would not have been produced without the GLR. The new and expanded\nindustries will create additional employment. After the completion of construction, employment is\nexpected to be about 20,100 person-years in 2007 increasing to about 60,000 person-years in\n2026.  This  would  total  about  734,000  person-years  of  employment  during  the  20-year  period\nfrom 2007 to 2026, of which 293,600 person-years would be passed on to poor households (i.e.,\nin the same proportion as the poverty incidence in the vicinity of  the GLR\u201438.6 percent).\n\n19.\nLocal governments are promoting tourism to scenic and historical sites along the GLR.\nBecause tourism is labor-intensive, tourism-linked employment will particularly benefit the poor.\nThe  study  under  the  TA  estimated  that  43,500  new  tourism  jobs  will  be  created  in  the  eight\ncounties/district along the GLR. Using the railway's modal share of 7 percent of the total number\nof passengers in the PRC, about 3,050 new tourism jobs in 2007 are attributable to the GLR.\n\n20.\n\nThe employment impact of the GLR is summarized in Table A18.6\n\n8  During  the  Mission\u2019s  field  visit,  local  governments  confirmed  arrangements  for  employing  50  percent  of  the  total\n\nrequirement of unskilled labor for roads construction from poor households.\n\n                  \n\n\f75\n\nAppendix 18, page 6\n\nTable A18.6: Employment Impact of the GLR\n(person-years)\n\nEmployment\nCreated (Unskilled)\n\nConstruction\n2002 to 2006\n\nOperation\n2007 to 2026\n\nEmployment Passed on to\nPoor households\n\nConstruction\n2002 to 2006\n\nOperation\n2007 to 2026\n\nType of Employment\nDirect\nGLR construction\nGLR operation (existing MOR staff)\nLoading/unloading of goods\nSecurity guards\nIndirect\nGLR induced jobs(generated traffic)\nMaterials sourced locally\nAccess and link roads\nRest of PRC\nTotal\n\n76,020\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n20,230\n3,320\n10,070\n109,640\n\n\u2014\n49,380\n103,360\n1,280\n\n734,020\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n888,040\n\n38,010\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n6,150\n1,660\n1,200\n47,020\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n72,350\n900\n\n293,610\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n366,860\n\n\u2014=not applicable, GLR=Ganzhou-Longyan Railway, MOR=Ministry of Railways, PRC=People\u2019s Republic of China.\nSource: Final report under TA 3486.\n\n21.\nThe  GLR  will  support  the  Government's  programs  for  poverty  reduction,  such  as  (i)\nmicrourbanization  will  reduce  the  rural  population  from  73  percent  to  50  percent,  thereby\nincreasing the share of cultivated land per capita in rural areas and thus increasing income and\nreducing  poverty;9  (ii)  agricultural  programs  designed  to  increase  production  and  farmers'\nincomes have been prepared;10 the disadvantages caused by lack of land are being overcome\nthrough technological inputs and growing higher value commodities and two or three crops in a\nyear; in addition food packaging, canning, and processing are being developed to add value to\nthe  commodity;  and  (iii)  women\u2019s  programs  will  support  specific  needs  and  development  of\nwomen; the All China Women's Federation is active in representing the interests of women to\nlocal  governments  and  in  carrying  out  a  variety  of  programs  such  as  the  Spring  Bud  program\nthat  provides  support  to  needy  households  to  keep  girls  in  school  when  their  parents  cannot\nafford it; and operates a small business fund for women. The mobility provided by the GLR will\nincrease the effectiveness of these programs.\n\nE. \n\nDistributional Analysis and Poverty Impact Ratio\n\n22.\nThe  distribution  of  project  benefits  was  analyzed  to  determine  the  extent  to  which  the\nProject  benefits  poor  people.  The  distribution  analysis  highlights  the  differences  between  the\nfinancial  and  economic  values  arising  from  the  Project,  which  have  been  reflected  as\n\n                  \n\n9 Along the GLR, various towns have been identified for infrastructure and economic development. The county local\ngovernments are preparing proposals for townships, including station towns for  improving  transport linkage,  roads,\nmarket facilities, warehouses, and factories. As for example, Jiangkou on the GLR will be upgraded into a county-\nlevel town as one of the 100 pilot national microurbanization towns in the PRC.\n\n10 Local  government  programs  for  poverty  reduction  include  technological  improvements  in  farming,  husbandry,\nforestry,  village  infrastructure,  transportation,  basic  health,  basic  education,  irrigation,  drinking  water  supply,  village\nroads,  extensions  and  microfinance.  These  are  funded  by  government  grants  and  low  interest  loans  from  the\nAgricultural  Bank  of  China.  International  and  bilateral  sources  (i.e.,  the  World  Bank,  International  Agriculture\nDevelopment  Fund,  United  Nations  Development  Program,  and  Germany)  are  also  providing  assistance  in  these\nareas.\n\n\f76\n\nAppendix 18, page 7\n\ndistributional  impacts  to  various  beneficiaries.11  The  net  financial  return  to  MOR  and  the\ndifference between net economic benefits and net financial benefits was disaggregated for poor\npeople. The Project's poverty impact ratio was estimated to be 26 percent, which is considered\nsatisfactory for an infrastructure project.12\n\nF. \n\nMonitoring and Reporting\n\nthrough \n\nrailway  administrations \n\nThe  Nanchang  and  Shanghai \n\n23.\ntheir  project\nimplementation agencies and the contractors will maintain records of total workers hired, local\nworkers  hired,  workers  hired  from  poor  households,  and  average  monthly  wage  paid.\nEmployment provided to workers hired from remote villages will be recorded separately. Poverty\nvillages that supply local materials for GLR construction will compile similar reports on workers\nemployed  from  poor  households,  and  the  revenue  earned  by  villages  by  supplying  materials.\nThis  information  will  be  provided  to  the  project  implementing  agencies.  Improvement  of  social\nconditions in the village made possible with the revenue earned from GLR construction will be\nindicated  separately.  The  county  governments  will  report  on  the  number  of  poor  persons\nemployed  and  wages  paid  during  the  construction  of  station  access  and  link  roads.  During\noperation,  Nanchang  and  Shanghai  railway  administrations  will  monitor  the  hiring  of  unskilled\nworkers  to  load  and  unload  freight  wagons  and  as  security  guards  for  the  stations  and\nwarehouses. The railway administrations will provide regular monitoring reports to MOR. MOR\nwill report this information to ADB in the quarterly progress report on project implementation.\n\n24.\nThe  Project\u2019s  poverty  reduction  impact  will  be  monitored  with  the  assistance  of  the\nResearch  Institute  of  the  Southwest  Jiatong  University  (RI-SJU).  RI-SJU  will  monitor  the\nbenefits  of  the  Project,  including  (i)  number  of  businesses  set  up  by  poor  households;  (ii)\nvillage/township  improvements  made  possible  as  a  result  of  GLR  construction;  and  (iii)\nsocioeconomic  and  other  impacts  of  the  Project  that  will  benefit  poor  people.  This  information\ntogether  with  a  socioeconomic  sample  survey  in  the  project  area  to  be  undertaken  two  years\nafter start of operation will be used to evaluate the poverty reduction impact of the GLR. RI-SJU\nwill  prepare  annual  monitoring  reports  and  an  evaluation  report  two  years  after  the  start  of\noperation, to cover all relevant parameters. MOR will provide these reports to ADB.\n\n                  \n\n11  ADB.  2000.
