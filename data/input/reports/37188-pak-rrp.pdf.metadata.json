An initial environmental examination was undertaken \ncovering the main subprojects, and an environmental assessment \nand review procedure report was also completed.  \n \nThe  Project  aims  to  reduce  poverty  for  the  inhabitants  of  the \ncoastal zone of Thatta and Badin districts in Sindh Province. The \nproject strategy is to help these households sustainably increase \ntheir incomes, their access to public services, and their capacity to \nmanage the natural resource base on which they live.  \n \nAt  the  household  level,  demand-driven  skills  training,  links  to \nmicrofinance \nresource \ndevelopment  (mangrove  planting,  crab  and  prawn  ponds,  and \nbivalve and seaweed rafts) will create income-generating options. \nAt  the  community  level,  group  organization,  leadership  training, \ndemand-driven  community-led  civil  works  and  related  initiatives, \nand direct participation in the sustainable management of coastal \nnatural  resources  will  support  social  capital  development  and \nbetter  public  service  access.  This  will  establish  the  enabling \nconditions  for  continuing  community-driven  development.  At  the \ninstitutional  level,  creation  of  a  coastal  zone  management  and \nmonitoring  plan,  capacity  development  of \nthe  Coastal \nDevelopment Authority (CDA), a fisheries and water quality survey \nof near-coastal waterways, and targeted capacity development of \nthe  districts  will  enhance  public  sector  responsiveness  to  local \nneeds.  Involvement  of  strong  national  and  local  nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs)  as  well  as  local  governments  will  help \nbeneficiaries better understand, engage with, and build long-term \nrelationships with the institutions they depend on for services and \nsupport.    \n \nSindh  has  a  coastline  of  approximately  350  kilometers,  a  major \nportion  of  which  comprises  the  Indus  River  Delta.  Significantly \nreduced  flows  in  the  lower  Indus  due  to  a  long  period  of  river \nwater  extraction  upstream  have  reduced  the  availability  of  water \n\nservices,  and \n\nimproved \n\ncoastal \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nfrom  the  Kotri  barrage  and  increased  tidal  seawater  intrusion  in \nthe lower reaches of the river. These conditions have resulted in a \nhigh  level  of  environmental  degradation,  consisting  of  tidal \nsaltwater intrusion, significant loss of agricultural land production, \ndecline  in  the  mangrove  habitat,  erosion  along  tidal  creeks,  and \nloss  of  inshore  fish  stocks.  While  inter-provincial  water  sharing \nagreements  are  a  long-term  issue  requiring  significant  national \nattention  to  resolve,  the  effects  on  the  downstream  areas  need \nimmediate attention. \n \nThe center of the highly fragile and rapidly changing ecosystem is \nthe coastal areas of Thatta and Badin districts, consisting of eight \ntalukas (subdistricts) with a population of 1.2 million. Poverty is a \nserious issue in rural Sindh, with 79% of the people in the project \narea living in under the poverty line. In addition to lack of income \nopportunities  and  poor  access  to  Government  services,  coastal \nhouseholds  have  to  deal  with  rapidly  declining  environmental \nconditions.  \n \nThe  downward  spiral  of  environmental  change,  with  a  parallel \nincrease  in  poverty,  isolation  and  powerlessness  under  usual \nhousehold  resource  management  conditions,  is  the  fundamental \nissue in the project area. Poverty is worsening at an alarming rate, \nas salt water intrusion weakens traditional land-based livelihoods. \nWith  declining  options  on  the  land,  people  increasingly  are \nexploiting  coastal  resources  which  already  have  been  seriously \naffected by the changes in the Indus Delta.  \n \nAs recognized in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, the slow \nprogress  in  reducing  rural  poverty  clearly  indicates  the  need  to \ncontinue focusing on poverty interventions. The national priority to \nprotect  the  vulnerable  and  improve  their  livelihoods\u2014and  the \n\u201cdouble  jeopardy\u201d  that  Sindh\u2019s  coastal  rural  poor  face\u2014are  the \nreasons why the Project is appropriate and timely. \n \nThe overall project impact is a reduction in poverty for households \nin  Sindh  Province.  The  outcomes  are  improved,  ecologically \nsustainable income opportunities and access to services for poor \nresidents in the eight coastal talukas of Thatta and Badin districts. \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $40.1  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $1.76 million.  \n \nA loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR24,237,000 ($36.0 \nmillion  equivalent)  will  be  provided  from  the  Asian  Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB) Special Fund to help finance the Project. The loan \nwill  be  for  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  with  an \nannual  interest  charge  of  1%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5% \nthereafter, and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the \nLoan Agreement. \n \n\n\f \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \n\nThe Government will relend the proceeds of the ADB loan to the \ngovernment of Sindh on the same terms and conditions as those \nbetween  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  GoS  shall  make  the \nentire  proceeds  of  the  Loan  available  to  CDA  on  a  grant  basis. \nThe Government of Sindh will assume the foreign exchange risk. \n \n30 June 2013  \n \n31 December 2012 \n\nThe project steering committee, with the same membership as the \nproject preparatory technical assistance oversight committee, will \n(i)  ensure  high-level  interagency  coordination  and  cooperation, \n(ii) provide policy guidance and reform support, and (iii)  facilitate \nproject  implementation.  The  Project  will  establish  a  project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  within  the  CDA,  Karachi,  headed  by  a \nproject director who will be supported by appropriate technical and \nsupport staff. The PMU will be responsible for overall interagency \ncoordination,  project  procurement  and  financial  management, \nreporting,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  project  outputs  and \nresults.  Two  district  project  implementation  units  will  be  based  at \nBadin  and  Thatta  for  field-level  coordination  and  facilitation  of \nimplementation,  including  environmental  and  other  safeguards, \nproject-related capacity building for district governments and local \nNGOs, and monitoring of gender and other social concerns.    \n \nCoastal Development Authority \n \nProcurement of $32.0 million of goods, related services, and civil \nworks, including $18.1 million of community-driven small initiatives \nand medium-scale infrastructure, will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2006, as amended from time to time). \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  250  person-months  of  specialized \nservices  of  national  consultants  and  23  person-months  of \ninternational  consulting  services.  Long-term  and  short-term \nappointments will be made through consulting firms and individual \nconsultant contracts. The community organization and small-scale \ninitiatives contracts provide an additional 3,024 person-months of \nfield  staff.  Project  management  and  project \nprofessional \nimplementation staff will provide 2,208 person-months of services.  \nQuality-  and  cost-based  selection,  single-source  selection  with \nmixed  input  and  performance  basis,  fixed-cost  selection,  and \nselection  methods  will  be  used.  \nconsultant-qualification \nConsultant selection will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2006, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nv\n\n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\nlong-term \n\nrelationships  with \n\nThe Project will provide direct social capital development, poverty-\nreduction  mechanisms,  improved  access  to  government  and \nNGO-based  services,  and  improved  institutional  capacity  to \nsustain  such  services  in  a  natural  resource  management  context \nfor  an  estimated  58,000  households.  The  poverty  impact  ratio,  a \nmeans  of  estimating  the  poor  as  a  proportion  of  all  project \nbeneficiaries,  is  59.9%.  The  base  case  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn  (EIRR)  for  the  Project,  which  assumes  the  community \ndevelopment component is a pure cost, is estimated to be 16% (a \nnet  present  value  of  PRs71.9  million,  or  $1.2  million  at  12% \ndiscount  rate).  This  EIRR  is  considered  within  an  acceptable \nrange. For the community-managed initiatives, the link road EIRR \nis  15.38%.  Project  investment  in  mangrove  planting,  crab  ponds, \nand  shrimp  ponds  yields  EIRRs  of  27.5%,  28.3%,  and  24.8%, \nrespectively.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  Project  is \nrobust with regard to changes in costs and benefits.  \n \nAt  the  institutional  level,  CDA,  provincial  departments,  district \ngovernments, and NGOs will better understand, engage with, and \nlocal  communities.  The \nbuild \ncommunities  will  (i)  increase  their  social  capital  and  leadership, \n(ii) improve  their  access  to  government  services  by  increasing \nknowledge  and  group  leverage,  (iii)  improve  self-confidence  and \nincrease  effective  community \nmutual  support,  and \nmanagement  of  coastal  natural  resources.  All  area  households \nwill  have  increased  access  to  potable  water,  schools  and  clinics, \nflood  safety  areas,  and  other  services  on  demand,  as  well  as \naccess  to  microfinance  services.  Participating  households  will \nhave better income-earning options and higher incomes. \n \nProject  risks  include  cyclone  and  storm  surges,  declining  fresh \ninstitutional \nwater  discharge \ndisengagement,  sustainability  of  community  organizations,  and \ninadequate  funding  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of \nfacilities constructed under the project. To mitigate these risks, the \nProject  will  (i)  undertake  preconstruction  safeguard  reviews  to \naddress  disaster  risk  before  confirming  construction,  as  well  as \npromote  the  construction  of  safety  areas  in  the  most  vulnerable \nlocations; (ii) facilitate the population\u2019s continuing adjustment to an \nenvironment with much less fresh water; (iii) ensure the resources \nand  roles  of  all  parties  implementing  aspects  of  the  Project  are \nclearly  delineated  and  agreed  upon,  and  establish  three  tiers  of \ncontinuing  dialogue  at  the  level  of  district  project  implementation \nunits, PMU, and project steering committee; (iv) designate as key \ncommunity  development  contractor  the  National  Rural  Support \nProgramme,  a  national  NGO  with  an  endowment  fund  that  can \nhelp extend community empowerment benefits beyond the project \nlife; and (v) have communities provide up-front funds for O&M on \nsmall-scale  schemes,  and  ensure  that  O&M  for  medium-scale \ninitiatives will be sustained through district Government budgets. \n\nIndus  River  Delta, \n\nthe \n\n(iv) \n\nto

\n\nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n\n \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Sindh Coastal Community Development Project (the \nProject).1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nAlthough  Pakistan  has  increased  spending  on  social  services  and  poverty  reduction  to \nalmost  5%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  as  of  2006,  poverty  continues  to  be  a  significant \nconcern.  The  national  poverty  analysis2  shows  that  32.1%  of  the  population  and  40.2%  of \npeople  in  rural  areas  live  in  poverty.  An  additional  20.4%  of  the  people  are  just  above  the \npoverty  line,  leaving  them  vulnerable  to  household,  environmental,  or  economic  shocks  that \neasily  could  push  them  back  into  poverty.  Typically,  the  poor  have  low  educational  levels  and \nlack  access  to  services,  such  as  fresh  water,  transport,  education,  and  health.  Household \nisolation,  which  is  accompanied  by  few  income  options,  poor  public  service  provision,  and \nvulnerability  to  natural  disasters,  reinforces  poverty  and  hopelessness  for  rural  households, \nparticularly in the project area. Women are uniquely vulnerable as they have one of the lowest \nliteracy rates in Asia and lower access to paid work than men due to social restrictions.   \n  \n3. \nThe average per capita income in Sindh Province is about $450 per year. Standards of \nliving for the urban educated population are significantly higher than for their rural counterparts, \nwith the highest poverty level for the country in rural Sindh (52%) and the lowest in urban Sindh \n(23%). About two-thirds of rural households live on less than $1 a day. Drought is common in \nSindh, affecting the population dependent on non-irrigated lands in particular.  \n \n4. \nThe  eight  coastal  talukas  (subdistricts)  of  Thatta  and  Badin  Districts  have  48  unions, \n2,008 villages (of which 718 are registered with the Board of Revenue), and a population of 1.2 \nmillion  people  in  175,000  households.  Although  formal  poverty  profiling  has  not  been \nundertaken  in  the  area,  secondary  data  generated  by  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance  (TA)3  showed  that  54%  are  in  the  poorest  category  and  79%  are  characterized  as \npoor.  In  a  2004  national  survey  Pakistan\u2019s  poorest  district  was  Thatta,  with  Badin  not  far \nbehind.4    \n \n5. \nMost  of  the  coastal  population  of  Thatta  and  Badin  live  in  rural  areas,  with  the  vast \nmajority  traditionally  depending  on  agriculture  and  fisheries  as  their  main  livelihood.  Other \nsources  of  income  include  basket  and  mat  making,  sales  of  bamboo  and  fodder  collected  in \ncoastal  open  lands,  net  making,  embroidery,  small  livestock  rearing,  and  sales  of  labor.  A \nsignificant  proportion  of  the  people  in  villages  in  the  mangrove  swamps  and  mudflats  at  the \nsea\u2019s edge in the coastal areas depend completely on capture fisheries for their income.  \n\n                                                 \n1  This  project  was  transferred  from  Agriculture,  Environment,  and  Natural  Resources  Division,  South  Asia \nDepartment  to  Agriculture,  Environment,  and  Natural  Resources,  Central  and  West  Asia  Department  on  8  June \n2006.

Social  Development  in  Pakistan:  Growth,  Inequality  and  Poverty. \n\nIslamabad.  \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n6. \nPoverty  in  coastal  Sindh  is  caused  by  household  isolation\u2014from  information  (about \nmarkets,  rights,  and  options  for  change);  from  economic  opportunities;  from  communities;  and \nfrom  public  services,  including  disaster  protection.  This  isolation  continues  despite  the  area\u2019s \nproximity to the megacity of Karachi, which is only 3 hours drive away by good road. Information \nflows are poor in areas where few can read or own radios, where institutional interactions with \nlocal  people  are  uncommon,  and  where  historic  socioeconomic  connections  are  weak. \nDistances between villages are long, infrastructure poor, and few community groups are active.  \n  \n7. \nThe isolation of poor coastal households from opportunities for change is an urgent and \nimportant issue. The solution is to focus on community, informational, and institutional links that \nwould enable households to protect and sustain the natural resource base, while benefiting from \na wider variety of income-generating options. To deepen and stabilize household benefits, and \nmake poverty reduction permanent, the government of Sindh (GoS) recognizes the importance \nof providing poor villagers with essential public services. GoS also understands the importance \nof  creating  mechanisms  for  the  community  and  government  to  interact  effectively  with \nnongovernment organizations (NGO) to improve household and village conditions.  \n \nB. \n \n8. \nSocioeconomic  Isolation  and  Gender  Restrictions.  As  much  as  90%  of  households \nin the project area live in reed shacks known as katchi abadis (one-room village house made of \nreed  mats,  no  fixtures)  with  no  cooking  or  sanitation  facilities  and  no  real  protection  from  the \nelements.  The  coastal  populations  are  a  long  way  from  medical  facilities,  and  the  pervasive \nshortage  of  clean  water  adds  to  their  health  issues.  The  average  literacy  rate  for  men  is  47% \nand women 14%, and most children do not attend school. The coastal areas have a traditional, \ngender-based  division  of  labor.  Despite  their  significant  contribution,  women  have  weak \nbargaining  positions  in  the  household  and  little  involvement  in  local  resource  management. \nThey  essentially  are  excluded  from  decision  making  at  the  household  and  community  levels. \nPhysical  isolation  due  to  the  distances  between  roads  and  villages  contributes  to  a  sense  of \ndisempowerment for both men and women.  \n \n9. \nCommunities  are  used  to  generating  a  certain  level  of  income  from  activities  they \nundertake in their immediate surroundings. As the resources needed for these activities erode \nor  disappear,  poor  households  use  the  remaining  resources  even  more  intensively  because \nthey  have  few  other  options.  As  a  result,  the  weakening  of  the  fragile  ecosystem  accelerates, \nreducing income opportunities for households, increasing risks of loss of food and health, and \ncreating a sense of vulnerability and despair. The lack of sufficient government services adds to \nthe  sense  of  hopelessness.  Changing  these  circumstances  requires  help.  Communities  and \nhouseholds need to alter their income and living paradigm\u2014from one of isolated households to \none of community groups that directly face their circumstances and actively manage interactions \nlivelihoods  and \nwith \nsustainability. A summary of the poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 2. \n \n10. \nInstitutional Constraints. Government\u2019s role is to plan, deliver, and provide upkeep for \nbasic  services,  such  as  (i)  physical  infrastructure  (roads,  water  supplies,  power),  (ii)  social \nsupports  (health,  education,  welfare  services),  and  (iii)  information  for  joint  public  resources \n(government land, fisheries, forest, agriculture, and livestock). Households in the coastal zone \nhave  not  received  effective  GoS  and  district  support,  as  planning,  implementation,  and \nmonitoring  capacity  is  insufficient  to  facilitate  appropriate  service  provision.  The  Coastal \nDevelopment  Authority  (CDA),  which  has  a  clear  mandate  to  plan,  facilitate  implementation  of \nand monitor all development of the coastal zone, is poised to fill this gap. Coastal area NGOs \nprovide  social  services  and  draw  attention  to  rights  issues.  However,  their  capacity  is  weak, \n\ninstitutional  environment \n\ntheir  physical  and \n\nto  enable \n\nimproved \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3\n\nparticularly in project planning, implementation, and financial management. The development of \na coastal zone management plan, as well as the capacity of all players to implement the plan, is \nessential for sustainable development in the area. \n \n11.  Water.  A  variety  of  anthropogenic  and  natural  pressures  have  degraded  Sindh\u2019s  350-\nkilometer  (km)  arid  coast  significantly  over  the  past  50  years.  The  main  causes  have  been \nsubstantial reductions of Indus River discharges into the delta, increasing salinity resulting from \npoor drainage, and seawater intrusion. These changes have reduced the natural resource base, \nwith  the  most  significant  impacts  being  on  (i)  the  availability  of  fresh  water  for  drinking  and \nagriculture, (ii) mangrove forest coverage, (iii) fisheries production, and (iv) agricultural output. \nThe significant and measurable declines in these areas have harmed the coastal environment \nand  the  vulnerable  coastal  communities.  Availability  of  fresh  water  has  become  the  critical \nissue, negatively affecting the productive use of human time, health, population distribution, and \nchoice and productivity of crops and livestock. The sector analysis is in Appendix 3. \n \n12.  Mangrove  Forests.  Mangrove  forests  and  their  environmental  functions  are  extremely \nimportant to the delta and coastal ecosystems, providing nursery habitats for fish, shrimp, crabs, \nand mollusks, sustainable supplies of fuel wood and fodder, and vital protection against coastal \nand tidal erosion and storms. Since 1997 however 72% of the 263,000 hectares (ha) have been \nlost  to  (i)  over-harvesting  of  mangrove  trees  for  fuel  wood,  fodder,  and  timber;  (ii)  grazing  by \ncamels and, to a lesser extent, by goats; (iii) major alterations in the fresh water and seawater \ndynamics of the lower Indus Delta, including its maritime near-shore components; (iv) reduced \nsediment loads and associated nutrients in the lower Indus River; (v) encroachment and some \nindustrial pollution in Karachi District; and (vi) failure to enforce forestry regulations. Sustainable \nregeneration  of  mangrove  forests  at  key  sites  under  community  management  is  central  to  the \nfuture sustainability of the coastal zone and its rural communities in Sindh, and potentially also \nto the more distant communities in the Indus River catchment area. \n \nFisheries. The fresh water and marine fishery resources of the onshore and near-shore \n13. \nIndus  Delta  represent  over  70%  of  Pakistan\u2019s  fisheries  industry  and  employ  and  feed  a \nsubstantial number of coastal Sindh households. In 2005 the total catch of fish and shellfish in \nPakistan  exceeded  665,000  metric  tons  and  had  an  export  value  of  $129  million.  While  the \nexport  of  shrimp  from  the  Sindh  coastal  area  generated  about  $100  million  in  1994, the  value \nhas declined to less than $40 million per year in 2005. In addition to shrinking shrimp exports, \nthe overall fish catch from the Arabian Sea appears to be declining. Uncontrolled foreign fishing \nvessels  and  the  contract  fishing  system  are  adversely  affecting  the  resources  on  which  the \nfishery depends. The catch is not managed to produce a sustainable yield and its value is not \nmaximized. The root problem is that the responsible institutions do not have the data or capacity \nto manage the resource properly. Further, mariculture options have not been explored.  \n \nAgriculture and Land Base. Large landholders own 70% of the remaining arable land \n14. \nin  coastal  Sindh.  Under  crop-share  agreements  with  haris  (tenant  farmers),  bananas,  onions, \npan  leaves,  rice,  sugarcane,  sunflower,  tomatoes,  wheat,  and  a  range  of  minor  crops  are \ncultivated  on  this  land,  with  low  yields  per  ha  but  reasonable  yields  per  worker.  In  fiscal  year \n2005 the value of the major crops produced was approximately PRs1.2 billion. Poor households \nare largely laborers on these lands. Such households also make use of uncultivated areas for \ncollection of fodder, bamboo, reeds, and other plants. When possible, poor households acquire \nlivestock  as  a  method  of  savings  and  income  generation.  As  land  pressure  increases  and \nagricultural  land  access  declines  labor  demand  also  drops,  cutting  off  a  major  source  of \nhousehold  income.  Pressure  on  uncultivated  lands  also  increases,  with  consequent  negative \nimpacts on income-generating activities, land cover, and livestock options. \n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n15. \nLessons.  The  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  record  of  achievements  in  rural \ndevelopment  projects  is  mixed.  Evaluation  studies  from  ADB\u2019s  Operations  Evaluation \nDepartment  (OED)5  and  other  ADB  implementation  experiences6  were  reviewed  for  useful \nlessons. Under a 2004 TA7 a detailed assessment of four rural development projects in Pakistan \nthat began in 1990 was undertaken and these recommendations were also incorporated. Finally \na sector synthesis of fisheries carried out by OED in 1998 as well as findings from the previous \nfive fisheries projects in Pakistan was reviewed. The most fundamental lesson was that projects \nneed to be simple to be effective. The Project reflects this finding. \n \n16. \n\nThe project design incorporates the following lessons: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n(x) \n\ncompact physical location for multiple inputs;  \nmeasures to improve the usual 2.4-year delay in startup, including methods for rapid \nsetup of the project management unit (PMU) and NGO contracting;  \nidentification  and  use  of  institutions  with  the  built-in  capacity  to  provide  needed \nservices  to  beneficiaries,  as  well  as  sufficient  local  knowledge  to  ensure  locally \nsuitable methods for natural resource management and community organization;  \nenabling communities to express needs and have them met in sustainable ways;  \nlocal-level  coalition  building  of  district  and  provincial  government  offices,  NGO \nservice providers, microfinance institutions, and sustainable community groups;  \nflexibility  in  design  for  pilot  work  in  fisheries,  ensuring  that  beneficiaries  drive  the \nexpansion processes;  \nestablishment of reliable fisheries resources statistics;  \nbalance  of  civil  works  construction  with  effective  social  mobilization,  with \nbeneficiaries given significant control over budgets, plans, and implementation;  \nwork to strengthen local institutional capacity, particularly for districts; and  \nresults-based  targets  and  rewards  systems  for  NGOs  and  government  institutions, \nwith effective monitoring and evaluation. \n\n \nGovernment\u2019s Strategy. The Government\u2019s program to address rural poverty is set out \n17. \nin  the  national  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper  (PRSP)  of  January  2004,  and  the  Sindh \nprovincial PRSP of December 2003. The Sindh PRSP recognizes that the lower districts of the \nprovince  have  been  particularly  affected  by  disasters  (cyclones)  and  natural  phenomena  (salt \nwater intrusion). Further, it observes that the economy has been constrained and the incidence \nof  poverty  has  increased  in  these  areas.  The  Sindh  PRSP  calls  for  special  focus  on  these \ndistricts, including the coastal areas, with five broad strategies to reduce poverty: (i) fiscal and \nfinancial  management  reforms,  (ii)  improved  governance  of  civil  service  and  public  sector \ndelivery, (iii) promotion of private sector development and economic revival, (iv) development of \nwomen and children, and (v) addressing vulnerability to shocks.  \n \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB.  2003.

ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP) for Pakistan was updated in \nAugust 2005. The CSP supports poverty reduction in Pakistan through initiatives in three areas: \nsupport for good governance (devolution, legal, judicial, and police reforms, as well as sector-\nand province-based reforms), sustainable pro-poor growth (rural development and employment \ngeneration),  and  inclusive  social  development  (health,  education,  water  supply  and  sanitation, \nand  social  protection).  In  addition,  sub-regional  development,  sustainable  environmental \nmanagement,  and  gender  and  development  were  identified  as  crosscutting  themes.  The \nupdated  CSP  identifies  the  proposed  Project  as  an  important  component  of  ADB\u2019s  support. \nOther external assistance related to the Project is in Appendix 4. \n \n\nA.  \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n \n\n19. \nThe  overall  project  impact  is  a  reduction  in  poverty  for  households  in  Sindh  Province. \nThe  outcomes  are  improved,  ecologically  sustainable  income  opportunities,  and  access  to \nservices for poor residents in the eight coastal talukas8 of Thatta and Badin districts.  \n\nB.  \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  outputs \n\n20.  \ninclude  (i)  an  environmentally  sound  coastal  zone  medium-term \nsocioeconomic  development,  management,  and  conservation  plan  implemented  by  CDA; \n(ii) effective  community-driven  mechanisms  for  community  planning  and  increasing  household \nincomes;  (iii)  transparent  and  accountable  community-driven  mechanisms  for  small-scale  civil \nworks  and  public  services  delivery;  (iv)  sustainable  community-managed  income-generating \nmangrove  stands,  crab  and  prawn  ponds,  and  bivalve  rafts;  and  (v)  an  operational  project \nmanagement system.   \n\nThe proposed Project has four components: (i) institutional strengthening, (ii) community \n\n21. \ndevelopment, (iii) improved coastal management, and (iv) project management. \n\n1. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening \n\n22. \nCDA Capacity Building. Under this subcomponent, the Project will help CDA develop a \ncomprehensive  coastal  development  plan  that  effectively  addresses  environmental,  social \ndevelopment,  economic,  and  other  concerns.  CDA  will  engage  the  GoS  and  districts, \ncommunity  groups  and  village  organizations  of  the  coastal  zone,  businesses,  and  other \nstakeholders  in  the  process.  It  will  start  with  a  framework  under  which  the  plan  will  be \ndeveloped.  The  Project  will  enhance  the  capacity  of  CDA  to  implement  its  mandate  through \nteam  building  of  an  expanded  CDA  staff,  provision  of  geographic  information  system  (GIS) \nfacilities,  and  support  for  appropriate  leadership  and  cross-institutional  collaboration.  CDA  will \nselect appropriate leadership workshops for its senior staff, with training provided in Asia where \nsuitable.   \n\nArea  Fisheries  and  Water  Quality  Survey  and  District  Capacity  Building.  The \n23. \nsecond subcomponent is a survey of coastal fresh water and brackish water fisheries and water \nquality.  It  will  be  linked  to  a  major  national  near-shore  and  offshore  fishery  survey  along  the \ncoast  of  Sindh  and  Balochistan  funded  by  the  Government  of  Norway.  Sindh  Provincial \nLivestock  and  Fisheries  Department  (SLFD)  will  implement  the  project  survey  over  3  years  in \ncooperation  with  district  fisheries  divisions,  and  in  consultation  with  other  government  and \nuniversity  organizations.  In  the  first  year,  the  survey  will  be  designed  and  tested,  following \ndiscussions to ensure integration with the national marine fisheries survey. In the second year, \nthe  survey  will  be  conducted  at  least  twice,  once  before  the  monsoon  period  and  once  after \n\n                                                 \n8  The  project  area  talukas  are  (i)  Ghorabari,  Jati,  Keti  Bander,  Kharo  Chan,  Mirpur  Sakhro,  and  Shah \n\nBander in Thatta District; and (ii) Badin and SF Rahu (Golarchi) in Badin District. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nmonsoon  period.  The  results  will  be  statistically  analyzed  during  the  third  year.  As  part  of  the \nsurvey process, SLFD will mobilize and train local communities in basic fisheries regulation and \nmanagement.  To facilitate devolution of skills and services in fisheries from province to district, \nconsultants will complete a training needs analysis of the project area district fisheries officers \nand provide a series of trainings with SLFD to upgrade skills and improve extension capacity of \ndistrict fisheries officers. \n\n2. \n\nCommunity Development \n\n24. \nCommunity Organization and Income Enhancement. This subcomponent will provide \nfor  (i)  the  formation  of  at  least  1,388  community  organizations  in  no  less  than  700  villages, \n(ii) participatory  planning  and  assessment  of  household  and  community  needs,  (iii)  training  of \nhouseholds  in  income-generating  options  and  leadership,  (iv)  microsavings  and  links  to \nmicrocredit,  and  (v)  graduation  of  groups  to  community  citizen  boards.  The  National  Rural \nSupport  Programme  (NRSP)  will  conduct  all  community  organization  work,  starting  with  a \nreview of its existing program and improvements to meet the specific conditions of the coastal \ntalukas.  This  will  be  consolidated  in  an  operational  manual  that  lays  out  the  project \nimplementation  mechanisms,  and  a  field  guide  that  presents  the  tools  and  mechanisms  to  be \nused  in  the  social  mobilization  process  and  small-scale  initiatives  (para.  28).  Both  documents \nwill be updated at least annually. \n\n25. \nNRSP will introduce the concept of community organizations as village-based entities for \nhousehold and community economic and social development. Village selection will be based on \npoverty  levels,  interest  and  willingness  of  poor  households  to  engage  in  the  activities  of  the \nProject,  and  physical  proximity  to  the  coast,  to  other  interested  villages,  and  to  proposed \nmangrove and prawn and crab pond working areas. Villagers will be encouraged to form groups \nof men or women with an average of 15 members, decide on a set of leaders, and start saving \nsmall amounts that are self-determined for each household. Leaders will be trained in advocacy, \nrecordkeeping  and  bank  account  operations,  and  economic  options.  The  savings  will  be \ndeposited  into  a  bank  account  and  fully  accounted  for  to  members.  NRSP  social  organizers \n(both female if recruitment is possible; one male and one female, if not) will work with villagers \nto  complete  poverty  self-analyses,  resource  mapping  including  household  counts,  and  an \nongoing reflection and planning process to identify, prioritize, undertake, and monitor household \nand community income-generation and public service improvement activities.  \n\nServices provided to community organization members and their households will include \n26. \n(i) training on a demand basis in income generation options, environmental management, and \nleadership  and  advocacy;  (ii)  access  to  microcredit  for  members,  as  well  as  support  to \ncommunity organizations to interlend their savings; (iii) links between community organizations \nthat  enable  them  to  form  village  organizations  for  economic  development  purposes;  and  (iv) \nconnections  between  village  organizations  and  local  government  to  access  government \nresources.  NRSP  also  may  help  community  organizations  consider  and  address  longer-term \nrights issues, such as fisheries licensing and personal identity cards.  \n\n27. \nNRSP will provide links between community organizations and four agencies for project \nactivities. First, it will facilitate connections between community organizations and the SFWD to \nenable  community  engagement  in  the  planting  and  management  of  mangrove  plantations. \nSecond,  NRSP  will  facilitate  links  with  the  SLFD  for  villager  training  in  aquaculture;  and  for \ncommunity management of shared fisheries resource areas, such as creeks and inland seas, as \nwell  as  engagement  in  the  coastal  fresh  and  brackish  water  and  water  quality  survey.  Third, \nNRSP and local NGOs will facilitate links with districts for access to medium-scale infrastructure \n(para. 31). Fourth, NRSP will link community activities to CDA coastal planning, implementation, \nand monitoring arrangements under the coastal zone development plan. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n7\n\n28. \nSmall-Scale Community-Managed Initiatives. The Project will finance initiatives in 700 \nvillages  based  on  community  demands,  with  an  open  menu  of  social  and  economic  activities \nincluding  small-scale  rural  service  infrastructure  and  capacity  building.  Funding  (PRs700,000 \nper village) will be allocated through grants, allowing community organizations in the village to \nprioritize  one  or  more  initiatives  within  this  budget.  The  budget  will  be  disclosed  to  the \ncommunities at the outset of the planning cycle. A short negative list will be provided to villages, \nwhich will include social functions and environmentally damaging activities. NRSP will manage \nthe  funds  and  the  process,  drawing  on  its  experience  completing  more  than  600  small  civil \nworks projects within the project districts.  \n\n29. \nBased on the budget, the community organizations with support from NRSP will develop \na village plan, which will include detailed project proposals. The community organizations then \nwill  submit  the  plan  with  the  supporting  proposals  to  the  village  for  endorsement  through  a \ncommunity  meeting  facilitated  by  NRSP.  The  community  schemes  will  be  prioritized  based  on \ntwo  main  criteria.  First  the  scheme  must  have  (i)  the  potential  to  accommodate  practical  and \nstrategic  gender  needs  of  women  and  girls;  (ii)  the  potential  to  benefit  the  poorer  and \ndisadvantaged  sections  of  the  community;  (iii)  the  ability  to  demonstrate  sustainable  medium- \nand  longer-term  impact  on  the  reduction  of  existing  poverty  and  social  inequality;  and  (iv)  not \nhave the potential of adverse environmental impact. Second, the community organizations must \nprovide counterpart funds totaling at least 5% of the scheme cost, of which 3% must be in cash \nto be set aside for operation and maintenance (O&M).  \n\nNRSP  will carry out feasibility studies on social, technical, financial, and environmental \n30. \naspects  of  the  proposed  initiatives  based  on  the  operations  manual  and  field  guide.  Social \norganizers  will  work  with  community  organizations  to  make  sure  villagers  have  the  requisite \nskills to implement and maintain each project. The district project implementation units (DPIU) \nwill ensure that the proposals do not overlap with projects already planned and in the pipeline by \nthe  local  governments.  NRSP  then  will  advise  the  communities  that  they  can  proceed  with  an \napproved project, and provide funds in two or  more tranches. The communities will undertake \nphysical  implementation  with  NRSP  supervision  and  support  from  qualified  technicians  for \nfinancial and environmental monitoring and management. Project books in the village, which will \nbe  made  publicly  available,  will  record  all  aspects  of  the  scheme  design,  construction,  and \npayment. NRSP will provide documentation on each small-scale village initiative suitable to ADB \nfor  loan  withdrawal  purposes,  inclusive  of  the  approved  village  plan  and  specific  project \nproposal, technical certification of work done, and expenditure receipts, where applicable. The \ncommunity organizations will take over O&M upon completion.  \n\n31.  Medium-Scale  Local  Government-Managed  Initiatives.  The  Project  will  finance  not \nless  than  91  medium-scale  rural  infrastructure  projects  (up  to  PRs6  million  each)  on  a  grant \nbasis to the village communities within the project area. The projects to be financed under this \nsubcomponent  include  rural  infrastructure,  such  as  water  supplies,  link  roads,  culverts,  small \nbridges,  school  buildings  on  higher  ground  for  protection  against  cyclones,  floods,  or \nearthquakes.  A  demand-driven  process  for  selection  will  be  used,  involving  applications \ntriggered by requests from communities through locally operating NGOs. The proposed project \nwill be developed after intensive consultations with beneficiary communities. The project will be \nendorsed  by  a  public  meeting,  documented  in  a  project  book  by  the  applicant  NGO,  with \nparticipation and voting by at least 60% of the households living in the project area at the time of \nproposal.  Beneficiary  communities  should  commit  a  portion  of  the  project  cost  as  their \ncontribution, either in kind or in cash.   \n\nThe  proposals  must  meet  the  following  criteria:  (i)  potential  to  benefit  the  poorer  and \n32. \ndisadvantaged  sections  of  the  community,  particularly  women;  (ii)  potential  to  create  a \nsustainable  medium-  and  long-term  impact  on  poverty  and  social  inequality;  (iii)  beneficiaries \nable  to  contribute  2%  of  the  counterpart  funds,  in  cash  or  in  kind;  and  (iv)  incorporation  of \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nmeasures  that  promote  transparency  and  accountability  in  project  implementation.  In  addition, \nthe NGO forwarding the proposed project should commit itself to ensuring transparency in all of \nits activities and transactions. \n\n33. \nAfter  DPIU\u2019s  initial  screening  of  compliance  with  the  selection  criteria,  the  district \ngovernments  will  undertake  the  feasibility  study  and  cost  estimates  on  these  proposals.  Once \nthese are completed and DPIU checks safeguard compliance, the proposals will be submitted to \nthe selection committee for the final selection process. The selection committee, which will be \nchaired by the director general CDA, will comprise (i) an additional secretary, GoS Works and \nServices  Department;  (ii)  the  district  coordination  officer  of  either  Thatta  or  Badin  District \n(depending on the location of the application); (iii) a representative from one of the three NGOs \non  the  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  by  rotation;  and  (iv)  a  senior  woman  representative \nfrom a local NGO working in the relevant district project area, or (if local NGOs cannot agree on \na candidate) a representative from the district chapter of the All Pakistan Women\u2019s Association.  \n\n34. \nThe  projects  approved  by  the  selection  committee  will  go  through  the  regular  tender \nprocess  of  the  district  government,  with  project  funds  provided  through  the  Sindh  provincial \nbudget. However, the tender notice will mention clearly that tender documents and information \ncan be obtained from DPIU, in addition to the offices of the concerned line agencies. A team, \nwith  one  representative  each  from  the  relevant  district  line  agency,  DPIU,  and  deputy  district \nofficer  (revenue),  will  open  the  contracts  and  decide  on  the  winning  bidder.  The  safeguard \nspecialist from the DPIU will attend as observer. The winning contractor will implement the work \nin close collaboration with the local NGO and the community, relevant district agencies, and the \nDPIU.  The  contractor\u2019s  contract  will  require  cooperation  with  all  stakeholders  on  matters  of \ntransparency and accountability.  \n\nThe districts will implement, operate, and maintain the selected projects. With local NGO \n35. \nsupport, villagers will maintain project books with all the details on the scheme, including design, \nbudget,  contractor,  time  frame,  payments,  and  comments  or  questions  by  the  area  residents. \nThe  DPIU  will  review  and  discuss  the  project  books  with  the  local  NGO  and  villagers  at  least \nthree times during construction to ensure transparency, accountability, and understanding. The \nDPIU  will  ensure  that  important  scheme  details  are  entered  on  a  Web  site,  and  posted  in  the \nproject area and on local notice boards in the taluka. Project funds have been allocated to help \ndefray district and local NGO costs, and to provide a grievance system to help area residents \naddress their concerns in a timely manner. \n\n3. \n\nImproved coastal management \n\n36.  Mangrove Planting. This subcomponent provides for planting of not less than 3,350 ha  \nclusters  of  mangroves  at  sites  in  the  intertidal  zones  to  provide  significant  disaster  protection \nfrom  storm-induced  tidal  surges  and  episodic  cyclones.  The  plantations  will  also  improve \nsubstantially  the  coastal  environment,  thereby  increasing  biodiversity,  and  provide  much-\nneeded new habitats for juvenile commercial fish stocks. Community members who work on the \nplantations  will  benefit  from  wood  and  vegetation  yields  in  these  new  sites,  fish  cultivation \noptions  in  their  mangrove  areas,  and  a  partnership  with  the  government  for  sustainable \nmanagement of mangrove resources. The mobilized communities will have an increased sense \nof ownership and commitment to the Project, which will strengthen subcomponent effectiveness. \n\n37. \nSites have been identified in Thatta at Keti Bander and Shah Bander, and in Badin at the \nnorthwest corner of the Zero Point Inland Sea. About 3,000 ha of new plantings and 350 ha of \ninfill  planting  will  be  done  along  tidal  creeks  and  in  the  intertidal  zone  of  the  dhand  (swamp) \nsystem near Ahmad Rajo. The areas have been selected based on (i) suitability of soil and tidal \nflow  characteristics  for  maximum  environmental  enhancement,  (ii)  absence  of  significant \npollution,  (iii)  presence  of  adjacent  coastal  rural  communities  that  can  be  mobilized  for \nmangrove  management,  and  (iv)  absence  of  coverage  by  other  rehabilitation  programs.  Two \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n9\n\nlocal  mangrove  species  which  have  been  planted  successfully  in  the  project  area,  Avicennia \nmarina and Rhizophora mucronata, will be used for the Project. Small saplings will be planted in \nmixed-species and single-species clusters and belts 50\u2013100 meters wide. The mangroves will \nbe planted at a density of about 1,100 plants per ha, or one plant per nine square meters.  \n\nInternational Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) will work \n38. \nclosely  with  the  Sindh  Forestry  Department  and  NRSP,  starting  with  a  public  information \ncampaign  about  the  multiple  benefits  of  mangroves.  IUCN,  NRSP,  and  the  Department  of \nForests  will  engage  communities  living  near  the  planting  areas  that  choose  to  participate  in \nmangrove  planting  and  establishment.  Further,  IUCN  will  arrange  for  community  training  in \nmangrove  sustainable  management,  and  in  mangrove  planting  and  tending  techniques.  The \nSindh  Provincial  Forest  and  Wildlife  Department  (SFWD)  will  manage  the  physical  nursery \nestablishment and mangrove planting processes, providing all necessary technical and logistical \nsupport  plus  payment  for  agreed  services.  SFWD  will  arrange  community  policing  and \nreplanting activities. IUCN, with NRSP links, will provide communities with training and technical \nsupport on how to protect and sustainably use the mangrove areas for fodder, fuel, and fisheries \nproduction and sale. IUCN will use global positioning systems to mark off areas to be placed in \nthe CDA GIS, monitor processes, and report on results. \n\n39. \nPrawn  and  Crab  Ponds,  and  Bivalve  and  Seaweed  Raft  Cultivation.  The  second \nsubcomponent  entails developing  simple  aquaculture  ponds  and  trials  of  prawn, crab,  bivalve, \nand  seaweed  cultivation  methods.  Households  can  replicate  these  if  the  technology  is  found \nappropriate and environmental safeguards are incorporated. Endogenous species fully adapted \nto  local  environmental  conditions  have  been  selected:  (i)  two  prawn  species,  Penaeus  indicus \nand  Penaeus  merguiensis;  (ii)  the  mud  crab,  Scylla  serrata;  (iii)  a  local  species  of  oyster, \nCrassostrea  rivularis;  (iv)  the  mussel,  Perna  viridisand;  and  (v)  local  seaweed  species,  Ulva. \nEnteromorpha Porphyra. Saline water shrimp ponds and crab ponds will be pilot tested.9 If the \npilot is successful, suitable government-owned land for more ponds will be available, subject to \nadvance  environmental  planning  and  regulation  to  avoid  future  pollution  and  environmental \ndegradation. Rafts can be sited at many creeks. Private sector interest and potential financing \nfrom a local commercial bank10 have been confirmed. \n\n40. \nAt  each  of  two  sites,  10  ponds  will  be  constructed\u2014five  for  crabs  and  five  for  shrimp. \nThe 20 trial ponds will be 20 meters by 50 meters, or about 0.1 ha each. The ponds will be dug \ndeeply into sites above mean high tide level, with bunds to prevent encroachment during spring \ntides. Seawater will be supplied by a gravity-fed system relying on the ebb and flow of the twice-\ndaily  tide.  The  shrimp  ponds  will  be  seeded  with  post-larvae  from  the  Hawkes  Bay  shrimp \nhatchery  or  Gharo  site.  The  crab  ponds  will  be  seeded  with  young  crabs  caught  by  local \nvillagers in the mangrove swamps. The crabs will be fed trash fish and shrimp. The shrimp will \nfeed on commercial feed pellets, or a combination of cow and poultry waste, diaminophosphate, \nmolasses, and yeast. Shrimp ponds yield 1,950 kilograms (kg) per ha after 4 months, and crab \nponds produce 4,735 kg/ha after 4 months. The market for shrimps is large, with local prices in \nthe  project  area  at  PRs450\u2013500/kg.  Crabs  are  a  valuable  export  with  a  significant  market \n(PRs80/kg on pond sites), and the potential for direct seaweed exports and local sale of extracts \nis high. Harvest and marketing of the prawns and crabs will be managed carefully, taking into \nconsideration a good return fairly distributed to the local communities involved in the operation. \n\n41. \nOysters and mussels as well as seaweed will be cultivated on a pilot scale by growing \nthem  on  ropes  attached  to  simple  rafts.  Six  rafts  will  be  sited  at  each  of  three  sites  (three  for \nmussels and oysters, and three for seaweed) with two extra for bivalves in the most promising \n\n                                                 \n9  The  Centre  of  Excellence  in  Marine  Biology,  University  of  Karachi  has  conducted  successful  trials  on  crab  pond \nculture  in  Sandspit  near  Karachi,  while  the  Gharo  aquaculture  facility  in  Thatta  has  conducted  trials  on  prawn \nculture.   \n\n10 Khushali Bank, in discussions with the President of the bank on 28 September 2006. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nlocation. The 20 initial pilot rafts will be anchored in the mangrove creeks, allowing them to be \nflushed twice a day by the ebb and flow of the tides. Seed for the mussels and oysters occurs \nnaturally  on  a  seasonal  basis,  and  will  attach  to  the  ropes.  Young  stages  of  seaweed  will  be \ncollected and attached to ropes. Water testing for pollution will ensure proper placement. \n\nThe ponds and rafts will be managed in collaboration with the SLFD facilities at Gharo \n42. \nand Hawkes Bay. NRSP will mobilize community organizations in villages to assist in the pilot-\nscale trials. Community members will be trained in cultivation and harvesting techniques, and in \nthe  maintenance  and  policing  of  ponds  and  rafts.  Following  successful  pilot-scale  replication, \nthe cultivation of crabs, shrimp, bivalves, and seaweed will be extended to the third site at Zero \nPoint,  and  at  the  Keti  Bander  and  Shah  Bander  sites  with  80  additional  ponds  and  80  rafts, \nbringing the total to 100 ponds and 100 rafts. IUCN will monitor environmental impact carefully. \n\n43. \nHatchery  Rehabilitation.  This  subcomponent  will  provide  minor  production  capacity \nupgrades  to  the  Badin  fresh  water  and  brackish  water  hatchery,  the  Hawkes  Bay  marine \nhatchery,  and  the  marine  rearing  facility  at  Gharo.  These  improvements  will  enable  them  to \nprovide  seed  for  the  trials,  address  technical  needs  and  experimental  pond  management \nsupport,  and  provide  suitable  training  to  potential  prawn  and  crab  cultivation  households.  The \nhatcheries and rearing facility will provide fry for the stocking of marine shrimp ponds, and fin fry \nfor  the  local  fresh  water  and  brackish  water  areas  in  the  talukas  of  the  project  area.  The \nupgraded  hatcheries  will  be  provided  with  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  enable  installation  of \ntraining for village households in appropriate options for aquaculture based on the survey work \nto  be  undertaken.  Fisheries  officials  will  also  work  with  community  groups  to  facilitate \nsustainable yield and reseeding, as appropriate, in coastal lakes and ponds. \n\n44. \nSLFD will upgrade the hatcheries in collaboration with district governments. International \nand national consultants will provide advice on needed improvements to meet the requirements \nof  the  proposed  pilot  village-based  aquaculture  activities.  SLFD  will  procure  civil  works  and \nequipment with PMU support and develop and deliver training regularly on villager pond and raft \nmanagement in collaboration with NRSP, local NGOs, and community organizations. \n\n \n\n4. \n\nProject Management \n\n45. \nThis  component  includes  the  PMU,  two  DPIUs,  vehicles,  furnishings,  equipment,  and \nconsultants. The Project will provide full-time institutional specialists, one based in each DPIU to \nconduct  a  training  needs  analysis  of  the  planning  and  monitoring  capacity  of  public  servants. \nThe  specialist  will  provide  training  and  hands-on  support  to  improve  the  skills  and \nimplementation capability of government officials. \n\nC.  \n\nSpecial Features \n\n46. \nCommunity-Driven Development Processes. The Project will develop the capacity of \ncommunities  to  undertake  participatory  planning  and  resource  allocation  based  on  a  simple, \nresults-oriented approach grounded in the principles of community empowerment, transparency, \nand  ownership.  With  NRSP  facilitation,  communities  will  (i)  organize  themselves,  (ii)  decide \nwhat their most pressing problems are and how best to address them, (iii) mobilize a portion of \nthe  resources  needed  to  deal  with  their  issues,  and  (iv)  manage  and  monitor  the  changes  in \ntheir  conditions.  Capacity  building,  small-  and  medium-scale  interventions,  mangrove  planting \narrangements,  and  experimentation  in  villager  aquaculture  will  be  community-driven.  This \nprocess  will  empower  communities,  which  is  necessary  to  address  poverty  and  access \nproblems in a sustainable manner.  \n\nSimplified  Implementation  Processes  for  Faster  Startup,  Using  Trusted  and \n47. \nProven  Partnerships.  Under  the  Project,  NRSP  will  implement  the  community  organization, \nincome  generation  and  small-scale  initiatives  activities.  NRSP  will  work  together  with \nGovernment  agencies  and  other  NGOs  for  mangrove  planting  (Coastal  Forest  Division,  with \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n11\n\nIUCN),  fisheries  surveying  and  pond  and  aquaculture  development  (Fisheries),  and  district \ngovernment for medium-scale infrastructure. NRSP\u2019s presence in the two project districts, and \nsuccessful history of community development in 34 other districts throughout Pakistan, places it \nin a unique position to expand to the harsher coastal zone of Sindh. With its internship practice, \nNRSP is able to field additional staff in the shortest time possible and can start working in the \nproject areas quickly to engage with poor households and start providing a reliable community \npresence.  IUCN\u2019s  12  years  of  work  with  SFWD  will  also  provide  rapid  engagement  for \nmangrove and coastal zone management with project area communities. \n\nTransparent  Anticorruption  Mechanisms  at  the  Local  Level.  Making  programs \n48. \naccountable to beneficiaries and insisting on effective public transparency of information helps \nensure  integrity  and  success  in  small-scale  civil  works  programs.  The  integrity  measures \nintroduced  under  the  Project  include  (i)  community-led  and  -validated  project  identification; \n(ii) transparent selection criteria and processes; (iii) participatory review and public audit of the \nschemes involving the local communities; (iv) project books that provide detailed information on \nproject  design,  costing,  implementation  processes,  and  finances  maintained  in  the  villages  to \nensure  accessibility  to  the  beneficiaries  and  their  communities;  (v)  project-related  information \ndisseminated  on  publicly  accessible  media,  such  as  local  radio,  notice  boards,  and  Web  site; \n(vi) selection committee with representation from the community, including women, to make the \nfinal selection on medium-scale infrastructure to be financed under the Project; (vii) provision for \ndistribution of tender documents and information from the DPIU office as well as the concerned \nline agency office; and (viii) grievance review mechanism with provision of a focal point in the \ndistricts for any complaints about community issues. Further details are in Appendix 5. \n\n49. \nGender Responsiveness. The Project has significant potential for greater gender equity \nthrough improved resource decision making by women, which will contribute to overall poverty \nreduction and improved ecosystem management. A project-specific Gender Action Plan (GAP) \nhas  been  formulated  to  promote  the  equal  participation  of  all  stakeholders  as  project \nbeneficiaries  (Supplementary  Appendix  A).  Proposed  GAP  activities  aim  to  (i)  establish \nmechanisms  to  ensure  women\u2019s  representation  in  decision-making  processes,  and  targets  for \nthe  number  of  women  community  organizations,  trainees,  and  village  activists;  (ii)  integrate \nwomen\u2019s  needs  into  project  subcomponents;  (iii)  establish  targets  for  female  staff  in  project \nimplementing  agencies;  and  (iv)  ensure  the  effective  involvement  of  women  in  project \nmonitoring and evaluation, including gender-disaggregated data for these purposes.  \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nD. \n \n50. \nCost  estimates  for  the  Project  are  in  Table  1.  The  project  cost  is  estimated  at  about \n$40.1 million, including physical and price contingencies, taxes and duties, and interest during \nimplementation. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 6. \n \nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n51. \nThe  Government  has  asked  ADB  to  provide  a  loan  for  the  equivalent  of  $36.0  million \nfrom  its  Special  Fund  resources  to  finance  90%  of  the  project  cost.  The  Government  and \nbeneficiaries will cover the balance. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period \nof 8 years, with an annual interest charge of 1% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. \nThe Government will relend the proceeds of the ADB loan to the Government of Sindh on the \nsame terms and conditions as those between the Government and ADB. The GoS shall make \nthe entire proceeds of the Loan available to CDA on a grant basis. The Government of Sindh \nwill assume the foreign exchange risk. The financing plan is in Table 2.  \n\n52. \nThe current country cost-sharing ceiling is 75%. The higher cost sharing for this project \nis  justified  for  two  main  reasons.  First,  the  project  activities  are  important  for  environmental \nprotection and reduction of extreme poverty. This will enable Government costs for welfare and \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nenvironmental mitigation in the area to decline over time and tax revenues to increase, releasing \nprovincial funds for loan repayment. Second, Government budget contributions being provided \nfor  social  services  and  disaster  mitigation  demonstrate  its  higher  financial  contribution  to \naddress the overall development issues in the coastal zone. \n \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimatesa \n($ million) \n\nComponent \nA.

Chaired  by  the  additional chief  secretary  of  the  Planning  and \nDevelopment  Department,  the  PSC  will  have  the  following  members:  (i)  secretary,  finance; \n(ii) secretary, local government and spatial development; (iii) secretary, livestock and fisheries; \n(iv)  representative  from  the  Navy;  (v)  secretary,  forest  and  wildlife;  (vi)  secretary,  environment \nand  alternative  energy;  (vii)  district  coordination  officer  of  Thatta  District;  (viii)  district \ncoordination  officer  of  Badin  District;  (ix)  Khushali  Bank  senior  official;  (x)  director  general  of \nCDA; (xi) chief executive officer of NRSP; (xii) senior representative from IUCN Pakistan; (xiii) a \nsenior  representative  from  the  World  Wide  Fund  for  Nature  (WWF)  Pakistan;  (xiv)  a  senior \nrepresentative from the Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum; (xv) project director as member secretary of \nthe committee; and (xvi) other parties deemed appropriate by the PSC and appointed at the first \nmeeting after loan effectiveness. Membership is consistent with that of the steering committee \nfor the project preparatory technical assistance. The PSC will meet at least twice a year. \n\n54. \nThe  Executing  Agency  will  be  the  Coastal  Development  Authority  (CDA),  while  the \nimplementing agencies will be (i) SFWD (mangrove planting); (ii) CDA (community organization, \nsmall-scale  community-managed  initiatives,  CDA  capacity  building,  and  project  management); \n(iii)  SLFD  (fisheries  and  water  quality  survey,  shrimp  and  crab  ponds  and  bivalve  rafts \ndevelopment,  hatchery  rehabilitation);  and  (iv)  the  district  governments  of  Badin  and  Thatta \n(medium-scale  local  government-managed  infrastructure).  SFWD  and  SLFD  each  will  appoint \nan officer at BPS 19 to supervise implementation of the components under its responsibility. In \nperforming  project  responsibilities,  these  officers  will  report  to  the  project  director.  The  Project \nwill  establish  a  PMU  within  the  CDA,  Karachi,  headed  by  a  project  director  supported  by \nappropriate technical and support staff, including a rural infrastructure engineer. All professional \nstaff  will  be  appointed  through  competitive  processes  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  project  director \nwill  report  to  the  director  general,  CDA.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  (i) overseeing \ninteragency and inter-district coordination and cross-learning for project activities; (ii) recruiting \nconsultants and NGOs, and awarding procurement and consulting contracts; (iii) consolidating, \nreviewing,  and  submitting  regular  progress  and  financial  reports  to  the  PSC  and  ADB;  and \n(iv) monitoring and evaluating project outputs and results. The PMU will serve as the secretariat \nof  the  PSC  and  the  selection  committee,  and  will  be  the  focal  point  for  liaison  between  the \nGovernment and ADB.  \n\nIn each project district, the Project also will establish a DPIU, which will be headed by a \n55. \nDPIU director who will report to the project director and will have six professional staff and other \nsupport  staff  as  required.  All  professional  staff  will  be  appointed  through  competitive  process \nacceptable  to  ADB.  The  DPIU  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  undertaking  field-level  coordination, \nfacilitation, and monitoring of inputs; (ii) supporting and training district governments in planning, \nmonitoring,  and  local  NGO  liaison;  (iii) ensuring  that  safeguard  conditions  are  met  for \nenvironment,  land  acquisition,  and  indigenous  peoples,  as  well  as  promoting  project  integrity; \n(iv) monitoring gender and other social concerns; and (v) providing ongoing support to project \nactivities  within  the  District  where  frequent  interagency  coordination  is  required.  The  project \norganizational flowcharts and structures of the PMU and DPIUs are in Appendix 7. \n\n56. \nProject  allowances  to  be  provided  to  the  GoS  and  key  CDA  staff  will  be  paid  twice  a \nyear, provided that the project milestones for specific components established in the inception \nteam  building  workshop,  and  agreed  with  ADB,  are  met  fully  during  the  previous  period.  GoS \nhas confirmed these arrangements. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nMicrocredit Opportunities and Links \n\n57. \nCertain activities foreseen under the Project will require anticipated beneficiaries to have \naccess  to  microcredit.  Khushali  Bank  has  opened  branches  in  Thatta  and  Badin  for  this \npurpose.  Contingent  on  a  feasibility  assessment,  Khushali  Bank  has  committed  to  provide  a \ndedicated  center  for  microfinance  services  by  August  2007.  In  addition,  NRSP  has  agreed  to \napply to the Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF) for additional financing for microcredit to \ncommunity organizations in the project area, based on the budget provided under the Project. \nAs NRSP has a longstanding financing arrangement with PPAF, this application is likely to be \napproved under the current or planned World Bank loan ($400 million). A proposed Japan Fund \nfor Poverty Reduction grant will provide funding for mobile banking service pilots in the project \narea.11  Funding  has  been  included  in  the  project  budget  for  microcredit  officers  starting  in  the \nsecond year, and can be used if PPAF funds are provided to NRSP for the project area.  \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n58. \nThe Project will be implemented over 6 years, beginning in the first quarter of 2007 and \ncompleting project  implementation  by  31  December  2012.  The  closing  date  for  disbursements \nwill be 30 June 2013. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n59. \nGoods,  related  services,  and  civil  works  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2006, as amended from time to time); and, where appropriate, will be \nconsistent with the government rules on small works. Civil works contracts valued at less than \n$1  million  may  be  procured  through  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB),  limited  international \nbidding  (LIB),  shopping,  or  community  participation  in  procurement,  as  determined  by  the \ncircumstances of the contract packages. The goods and equipment contracts will be procured \nusing  the  LIB,  NCB,  or  shopping  procedures.  CDA  will  certify  to  ADB  that  the  goods  and \nservices financed by the loan are procured from ADB member countries. ADB must approve in \nadvance  the  awarding  of  contracts  and  substantial  contract  variations,  as  indicated  in  the \nprocurement plan in Appendix 9.  \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n60. \nThe  Project  will  provide  250  person-months  of  specialized  services  of  national \nconsultants,  as  well  as  23  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  under  long-term \nand  short-term  appointments  through  consulting  firms  and  individual  consultants  for  the \nfollowing areas: (i) crab and prawn pond and bivalve and seaweed raft technology, (ii) financial \nmanagement and external spot audits, (iii) aquaculture food systems and hatcheries technology, \n(iv)  GIS  technology,  (v)  fisheries  biology,  and  (vi)  standing  water  quality  assessment. \nProfessional  field  staff  will  provide  an  additional  3,024  person-months  of  services  under  the \ncommunity  mobilization  and  small-scale  interventions  contract.  Project  management  staff  will \nprovide  2,208  person-months  of  services.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with \nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006, as amended from time to time). Two single-\nsource  selection  contracts  are  justified  in  paras.  61  and  62.  The  Government  has  agreed  to \nrecruit  individual  consultants  under  the  Project  in  accordance  with  ADB's  relevant  procedures \n(Appendix 9). A list of all consultants, staff, and related government officers is in Supplementary \nAppendix C. \n\n61. \nNRSP  will  provide  the  consulting  services  for  community  organization  and  small-scale \ninitiatives  under  single-source  selection.  NRSP,  the  largest  national  NGO  of  this  kind  in \nPakistan, is the only one with the scope, financial management systems, and ability to deliver \n\n                                                 \n11  PAK: Microfinance for the Poorest, submitted to the Government of Japan on 1 November 2006 for $2 million by \n\nADB\u2019s West and Central Asia Department, Governance, Finance, and Trade Division. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n15\n\nthe  community  organization,  links,  and  small-scale  initiatives  planned  under  the  Project.  An \ninstitutional  assessment  of  NRSP  undertaken  during  appraisal  confirmed  NRSP\u2019s  unique \ncapability for this contract. NRSP has agreed to be paid its management overhead based on its \nachievement of semiannual milestones, consistent with component and project objectives to be \nagreed  upon  before  contracting.  The  budget  assumes  that  ADB\u2019s  Sindh  Rural  Development \nProject (footnote 6) will finance the establishment of the regional and district offices. The NRSP \nreview is in Appendix 10. \n\nIUCN  will  provide  consulting  services \n\n62. \nfor  community  mangrove  planting  and \nmanagement, as well as monitoring and evaluation of mangrove planting, and crab and prawn \npond  environmental  effects  and  issues.  IUCN  is  the  world\u2019s  largest  conservation  network.  In \nPakistan, IUCN has been working for over 12 years on mangrove area planting, environmental \nmanagement  of  mangrove  areas  and  related  biodiversity,  and  community  participation  in \nmangrove replanting and fisheries management in the project areas and elsewhere.  \n\n63. \nThe Government has requested advance contracting and retroactive financing under the \nProject. The purposes of the advance contracting and retroactive financing are to help ensure \nthe timely and accurate completion of the Planning Commission Proforma-1(PC-1), continue the \nongoing  preparation  for  a  rapid  project  startup,  and  enable  contract  finalization  and  fielding  of \nNRSP  and  IUCN.  The  retroactive  financing  will  be  in  effect  for  not  more  than  12 months  after \nthe  date  of  the  Loan  Agreement  to  be  used  for  Project  management  related  expenditure.  The \nGovernment  has  been  informed  that  the  amount  of  the  retroactive  financing  must  not  exceed \n20%  of  the  ADB  loan  amount,  and  that  approval  of  advanced  contracting  and  retroactive \nfinancing does not commit ADB to finance the Project.  \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption  \n\nADB\u2019s  policy  on  Anticorruption  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \n64. \ndiscussed  with  the  Government  and  the  Executing  Agency.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to \ngood  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate, \ndirectly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices \nrelating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \nAnticorruption  (1998)  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the \nProject.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  will  include \nprovisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the \nExecuting Agency, implementing agencies, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project.   \n\n65. \nAt the start of the Project, a financial management specialist will help ensure that project \nrecords  are  structured  and  kept  appropriately  to  meet  ADB  and  Government  integrity \nrequirements.  The  Project  will  recruit  an  auditor  to  perform  spot  checks  on  all  project  and \nproject-related accounts. Special integrity measures to enhance governance in the small-scale \ninitiatives and medium-scale community infrastructure have been incorporated into the Project. \nThese are reflected in paras. 28 and 31\u201333 and in Appendix 5. \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n66. \nThe proceeds of the ADB loan will be disbursed according to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook  (2001,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Direct  payment  procedures  will  be  used  for \nconsulting  services  and  equipment  following  LIB  procedures.  For  civil  works  following  NCB \nprocedures  and  small  expenditures  related  to  the  PMU,  reimbursement  and  imprest  fund \nprocedures  will  be  applied.  After  loan  effectiveness,  the  PMU  will  open  an  imprest  account  at \nthe  State  Bank  of  Pakistan.  The  initial  deposit  to  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  the \nestimated expenditures for 6 months of project implementation or 10% of the loan, whichever is \nlower.  Following  a  financial  management  assessment  to  confirm  the  capacity  of  the \ndepartments,  two  second  generation  imprest  accounts\u2014one  each  for  SFWD  and  SLFD\u2014may \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nbe  established  at  the  National  Bank  of  Pakistan  to  enable  field  operations  for  mangrove \nplanting, and for fisheries surveys and field training. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedure \nwill be applied to reimburse expenditures, and to liquidate and replenish the imprest account for \npayments of $50,000 and less. The currency of the imprest account will be in US dollars, and \nthe currency of the two second generation imprest accounts will be in Pakistani rupees. \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n67. \nCDA, through the PMU, will maintain project accounts acceptable to ADB in accordance \nwith the ADB.12\u2019 Further, CDA, through the PMU, will maintain separate records and accounts \nfor  goods,  works,  and  services  to  be  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds  and  Government \nfinancing  following  sound  accounting  principles.  Auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  will  audit  the \naccounts  and  records  annually.  Within  6  months  of  the  close  of  the  financial  year,  certified \ncopies  of  the  audit  report  in  English,  with  the  auditor\u2019s  opinion,  will  be  submitted  to  the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  The  audit  reports  will  include  a  management  letter  and  a  separate \nopinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditures  procedure.  The \nGovernment  has  been  advised  that  delays  in  the  submission  of  audited  financial  statements \nmight result in the suspension of loan and grant disbursements by ADB.   \n\n68. \nThe  PMU  will  submit  quarterly  and  annual  reports  to  ADB.  The  reports  will  indicate  (i) \nprogress  made;  (ii)  problems  encountered;  (iii)  steps  taken  to  remedy  the  problems;  (iv) \nprogram of activities; and (v) expected progress during the remaining implementation period, as \nwell as project performance data. The reporting system will focus on outcomes, efficiency, and \nquality, consistent with the project framework. The project completion report will be submitted by \nthe PMU within three months of the project completion date. \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n69. \nTo monitor the progress of the Project in achieving the outcome and outputs, the PMU \nwill  establish  a  baseline  and  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  consistent  with \nADB  and  Government  reporting  requirements.  During  the  project  inception  team  building \nworkshop, a matrix of sub-indicators will be developed with at least annual milestones linked to \nthe performance indicators in Appendix 1. The PPMS will be established by the end of the first \nyear.  Baseline  data  will  be  gathered,  and  progress  updates  will  be  provided  semiannually  to \ninterested stakeholders and the public. \n\n10.   Project Review \n\n70. \nCDA,  GoS,  and  ADB  will  review  the  implementation  of  the  Project  semiannually,  using \nthe information gathered from the PPMS and the progress reports on the project activities. The \nreviews  will  consider  (i)  achievement  of  loan  covenants;  (ii)  physical  achievements  against \nmilestones, with any reasonable changes, and disbursement and financial progress; (iii) project \nimplementation  changes  and  areas  requiring  resolution  or  action;  (iv)  interagency  operations \nand  engagement;  and  (v)  media  and  information  flows  to  stakeholders  and  the  public.  Close \ncoordination  with  the  resident  mission  will  ensure  effective  participation  and  representation  of \nADB. \n\n71. \nDuring  the  first  half  of  the  fourth  year  of  project  implementation,  ADB,  CDA,  and  GoS \njointly  will  undertake  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  (MTR).  The  MTR  will  review  and \nevaluate  (i)  project  scope,  design,  and  implementation  arrangements;  (ii)  progress  against \nagreed indicators based on the project framework; (iii) procurement performance; (iv) PMU and \nNGO  effectiveness;  (v)  performance  of  the  consultants;  (vi)  potential  options  to  shift  funds \nbetween  small-scale  initiatives  and  medium-scale  community  infrastructure;  (vii)  options  for \n\n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2003. Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects \n\nFinanced by ADB. Manila \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n17\n\nimplementation of recommendations of the fisheries and water quality survey, and the pilot pond \nand  raft  activities,  including  a  detailed  environmental  impact  assessment;  and  (vii)  any  other \nissues agreed upon by ADB, the CDA, and GoS. A month before the MTR, the PMU will submit \na comprehensive analysis of each of these issues, as well as others that are appropriate. At the \nconclusion  of  the  MTR,  the  ADB  and  GoS  will  agree  on  changes  in  project  scope  and \nimplementation arrangements deemed necessary. \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Benefits  \n\nfor \n\nlinks \n\nto  microcredit \n\nincome-generation  options; \n\nThe  Project  will  provide  four  types  of  mechanisms  with  measurable  impact:  (i)  skills \n72. \ntraining  and \n(ii)  microsavings; \n(iii) development  of  mangrove  stands  and  simple  aquaculture  options  for  household-level \nimplementation;  and  (iv)  provision  of  small-scale  initiatives  and  medium-scale  community \ninfrastructure.  For  simplicity  and  clarity,  the  final  economic  analysis  was  completed  on  the \ncontributions  of  the  pond  and  raft  mariculture,  as  well  as  the  returns  to  mangrove  plantations \nand related fish production. Workers also will benefit from wood and vegetation yields in these \nnew sites, fish cultivation options in their mangrove areas,  and a partnership with government \nfor sustainable management of the mangrove resources. The mobilized communities will have \nan  increased  sense  of  ownership  and  commitment,  which  will  strengthen  the  subcomponent\u2019s \neffectiveness and sustainability.  \n\nThe  Project  will  introduce  shrimp,  crab,  bivalve,  and  seaweed  aquaculture  linked  to \n73. \nprotective  planting  of  the  mangroves.  Aquaculture  based  on  community  ponds  and  rafts  will \nprovide  livelihood  opportunities,  and  household  incomes  will  increase  as  a  result  of  finfish, \nshrimp,  and  crab  and  bivalve  sales.  The  benefits  from  mangroves  include  increases  in  fish \nstocks  and  fish  catch,  sales  of  firewood  and  fodder,  and  protection  of  land  that  otherwise \nprobably would be lost to seawater encroachment. Additionally, these activities will likely enable \ncommunities to improve management of their natural resource base, enabling more diversified, \nregular,  and  sustainable  incomes  from  these  sources.  Investment  in  mangrove  planting  and \naquaculture yields economic internal rates of return (EIRR) of 27.5% and 24.6%, respectively.  \n\n74. \nThe  base  case  EIRR  for  the  Project,  which  assumes  the  community  development \ncomponent  is  a  pure  cost,  is  estimated  at  16%  (net  present  value  of  PRs71.9  million,  or  $1.2 \nmillion  at  12%  discount  rate).  This  EIRR  is  considered  within  an  acceptable  range.  Sensitivity \nanalysis  indicates  that  the  Project  is  modest  to  robust  with  regard  to  changes  in  costs  and \nbenefits. For the community-based participatory initiatives, the benefits of link roads have been \nevaluated  based  on  the  availability  of  average  daily  traffic  data  and  the  probability  that \ncommunities would select roads for funding. The EIRR for such roads is 15.38%. \n\n75. \nThe  poverty  impact  of  the  Project  is  measured  using  a  weighted  average  incidence  of \nthe poor in each of the categories of project beneficiaries as the means of estimating the poor \nas  a  proportion  of  all  project  beneficiaries.  The  resulting  poverty  impact  ratio  is  estimated  at \n59.9%. This supports the overall thrust of the Project, which is to reduce poverty. \n\nB. \n\nSocial Impacts \n\n All communities where the community organizations operate will have increased access \n76. \nto  fresh  water,  schools  and  clinics,  safety  areas,  and  other  infrastructure  on  a  demand  basis. \nThe  result  will  be  improved  health,  educational  opportunities,  and  market  access  for  all \nhouseholds in the affected villages, reaching far beyond the directly targeted beneficiary group. \nIn  addition,  access  to  microsavings  and  safety  areas  provides  a  community  cushion  against \ndisasters,  and  helps  prevent  households  from  having  to  borrow  for  emergencies.  Thus,  poor \nhouseholds  are  protected  from  labor  bondage,  and  the  physical  safety  of  families  and  their \nmovable assets is increased. The community organization process has a number of intangible \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nbenefits, including increasing trained leaders, improving access to government services through \ngreater  knowledge  and  group  leverage,  expanding  community  social  capital,  and  enhancing \nself-confidence and support.  \n\nC. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\nUnder  ADB\u2019s  environmental  classification  system,  the  Project  has  been  designated \n77. \ncategory  B.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  (Supplementary  Appendix  D)  has  been \nprepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  assessment  and  environmental  review \nprocedures. Potential negative environmental impacts from the Project are not anticipated to be \nsignificant. The selection criteria for subprojects exclude any sites of ecological importance, or \nsubprojects identified as having significant negative impact. The environmental assessment and \nreview procedure (EARP) prepared for the Project (Supplementary Appendix E) will be utilized \nto screen and evaluate proposed subprojects for approval.  \n\nD. \n\nRisks \n\nA  review  of  experience  in  coastal  Sindh,  experience  with  other  projects,  and  a  general \n\n78. \nknowledge of prevailing climatic conditions in the project area suggest the following risks:  \n\n79. \nCyclone and Storm Surges. Unprotected initiatives in parts of the project area subject \nto storm surges have a probability of being damaged by floods in one out of every three years. \nThe probability of a major disaster in the zone is 1 year out of every 30 years. To reduce these \nrisks, the pre-selection safeguard review will consider carefully the likelihood of damage in any \narea.  Options  for  protection  will  be  discussed  and  implemented,  including  the  promotion  of \nsafety area construction of schools in the most vulnerable areas. Disaster preparedness will be \na core part of training for the community organization members and their communities.     \n\nDeclining  Fresh  water  Discharge  to  the  Indus  River  Delta.  The  ongoing  activities \n80. \nupstream from the delta area, including growth of Karachi and further irrigation projects, suggest \nthat  the  amount  of  water  flowing  to  the  sea  will  be  low  for  the  foreseeable  future.  This  will \ncontinue  to  have  major  environmental  impacts,  including  salt  water  intrusion  into  coastal \naquifers,  shoreline  erosion  due  to  lack  of  sediment  deposition,  and  other  factors.  Project \nactivities will facilitate the population\u2019s adjustment to an environment with much lower availability \nof fresh water, enabling the people to cope with these changes more effectively. \n\nInstitutional Disengagement. The Project is established to help very poor households \n81. \nreduce poverty. For the process to be effective, the NGOs and Government agencies must work \nclosely together, and focus on empowerment of the beneficiaries. To reduce this risk, resources \nand roles of all parties have been delineated clearly and simplified. The GoS has encouraged \nstrongly collaboration well before project startup. Effective DPIUs, PMU, and PSC should help \nresolve any confusion or misunderstandings. \n\n82. \nSustainability  and  Operation  and  Maintenance.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  NRSP  will \nimplement the key community development subcomponents, with an endowment fund that can \nhelp extend community empowerment benefits beyond the project life. NRSP also will assist in \nthe formation of citizen community boards for longer-term operations. Community organizations \nwill identify, plan, implement, and maintain the subprojects under the small-scale initiatives. For \nmedium-scale  community  infrastructure,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  the  O&M  budget  will \nbe sustained. DPIU engineers will be responsible for monitoring both, with regular review by the \nPMU senior rural engineer. \n\n83. \nNone of the project components, activities, or civil works is expected to entail any land \nacquisition,  conversion,  donation,  or  restrictions  of  access  that  will  trigger  ADB's  policy  on \nInvoluntary Resettlement (1995). The GoS will ensure that no project component or activity will \nentail  any  involuntary  resettlement  impacts,  or  any  permanent  or  temporary  adverse \nsocioeconomic impacts arising from any land acquisition, conversion, donation, or restrictions of \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n19\n\naccess. Further, the GoS will ensure that any land utilized for the Project, whether government-\nowned  or  otherwise,  is  not  occupied  or  under  use  as  defined  by  ADB's  policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement.   \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n84. \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents:  \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \n\n(i) \n\nWithin 6 months of loan effectiveness, the GoS will ensure that the PMU and DPIUs will \nhave  been  established  and  fully  staffed  to  the  satisfaction  of  ADB,  and  remain  fully \nstaffed throughout the implementation of the Project. \n\n(ii)  Within six months of loan effectiveness, the Livestock and Fisheries Department and the \nForest and Wildlife Department will each appoint an officer at BPS 19 to supervise the \nimplementation  of  the  Project  activities  under  their  responsibility.  In  undertaking  these \nresponsibilities, these officers will report to the Project Director. \n\n(iii)  Within six months of loan effectiveness, the GoS will ensure that the Operation Manual \nand  Field  Guide  required  for  the  successful  implementation  of  community  organization \nand  small  scale  interventions  will  have  been  completed  by  NRSP  to  the  satisfaction  of \nADB. The Operation Manual and Field Guide will be updated on an annual basis. \n\n(iv)  Within  six  months  of  the  loan  effectiveness,  the  GoS  will  ensure  that  a  selection \ncommittee  will  have  been  established  to  (i)  select  all  applications  for  medium  scale \ninitiatives; and (ii) review the completion reports of each initiative. The GoS will ensure \nthat  all  tender  documents  related  to  the  implementation  of  the  medium  scale  initiatives \nwill be easily accessible to concerned parties, including provision through the DPIU. \n\n(v)  Within twelve months of loan effectiveness, the GoS will ensure the establishment of a \nProject website which will provide Project-related information including, but not limited to, \ninformation  on  small  and  medium  scale  initiatives.  This  will  enhance  transparency  and \naccountability in the implementation of the Project. \n\n(vi)  Within twelve months of loan effectiveness, the GoS will ensure that a grievance review \nmechanism will be established to the satisfaction of ADB. The mechanism will allow the \nintended  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  and  the  local  stakeholders  to  file  and  track \ncomplaints related to the implementation of the Project. The mechanism will include the \nappointment  of  one  of  the  PMU  staff  to  act  as  the  focal  person  in  receiving  and \naddressing the grievances. \n\n(vii) \n\nThe GoS will ensure that all counterpart funds required for the Project, including the cost \nof land acquisition or lease, are allocated in its annual budget and that these funds are \nreleased in a timely manner. GoS will further agree that the counterpart funds not utilized \nby  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year  will  be  carried  forward.  In  the  event  that  it  is  not \npermissible  to  carry  forward  unutilized  counterpart  funds,  the  unutilized  counterpart \nfunds will be reallocated for Project specific purposes in the following fiscal year. \n\n(viii)  The  GoS  will  ensure  the  establishment  of  a  maintenance  plan  and  appropriate  O&M \nbudget including projected budget requirements for all facilities and improvements to be \nprovided,  constructed,  or  rehabilitated  under  the  Project,  except  for  the  small  scale \ncommunity-driven initiatives where communities will assume such responsibility. \n\n(ix) \n\nThe  Government  and  GoS  will  ensure  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Policy \n(2002)  and  ensure  that  all  mitigation  and  monitoring  measures  set  out  in  the  IEE  and \nEARP  are  incorporated  and  implemented  in  the  detailed  planning  and  all  Project \n\n \n\n\factivities.  Proper  monitoring  and  enforcement  of  necessary  environmental  safeguard \nmeasures  for  pond  cultivation  will  be  properly  established  in  the  CDA  coastal  zone \nmanagement  plan.  The  GoS  will  allow  the  lease  of  its  land  to  any  entities  for  the \nconstruction of prawn or crab ponds within the Project Area upon the establishment of a \nspecific environmental plan with mitigation  and remedial measures, taking into account \npotential future problems of pollution. \n\nThe GoS will employ in reasonable numbers the poor and vulnerable people within the \nProject Area for planting, construction and maintenance activities related to the Project, \nand ensure that the wages are not differentiated between men and women for work of \nequal value. Compliance will be strictly monitored during Project implementation. \n\nThe GoS will ensure that all land to be utilized for the Project will be government-owned \nland and not involve land acquisition or land conversion that might generate involuntary \nresettlement impacts, including loss of income, resources or assets for the non-titled, as \nspecified under ADB\u2019s policy on Involuntary Resettlement. (1995.) \n\nThe  GoS  will  ensure  timely  and  effective  implementation  of  the  Gender  Action  Plan, \nwhereby at least 33% of the Project beneficiaries will be women, and the GoS will take \nall  the  necessary  steps  to  recruit  women  professionals  for  PMU  staff,  DPIU  staff  and \nincremental CDA staff, with a target of 33% but not lower than 15% of the staff. \n\n(xiii)  The Government and GoS will both comply with ADB\u2019s policy on Anticorruption (1998). \nThe Government and GoS acknowledge ADB\u2019s right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the \nproject, and agree to cooperate fully with such investigation and to extend all necessary \nassistance,  including  providing  access  to  all  relevant  books  and  records,  as  may  be \nnecessary for the satisfactory completion of any such investigation. \n\n(xiv)  Within  12  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  initial  baseline  surveys  and  established \nProject  performance  management  system  consistent  with  the  Project  framework  will \nhave  been  completed.

An  additional \n20.4% are just above the poverty line, leaving them vulnerable to household, environmental, or economic shocks that \neasily  could  push  them  back  into  poverty.  The  national  incidence  of  rural  poverty  is  high  at  40.2%.  About  60%  of \nPakistan\u2019s  rural  poor  are  landless.  Most  of  the  poor  and  vulnerable  non-poor,  when  employed,  work  in  the  informal \nsector. Thus they are less likely to have stable incomes and move out of poverty. More than half work in agriculture, \nfisheries,  and  forestry,  and  another  21%  in  trade  and  community  services.  The  rural  poor  are  highly  vulnerable  to \nchanges in climatic conditions, particularly droughts and cyclones. Typically, the poor have low educational levels and \nlack  of  access  to  services,  such  as  fresh  water,  transport,  education,  and  health  services.  The  combination  of  few \nincome  options  and  poor  access  to  public  service  access  reinforces  their  poverty  and  hopelessness.  Women  are \nparticularly  vulnerable,  as  they  have  one  of  the  lowest  literacy  rates  in  Asia  at  40%  and  have  lower  access  to  paid \nwork than men due to social and other restrictions.   \n\n  Yes \n    No \n\nThe average per capita income in Sindh Province is about $450 per year. About two thirds of the rural population lives \non less than $1 a day. The project districts\u2014Thatta and Badin\u2014were rated two of the poorest in a 2004 nationwide \nvillage  survey.b  Only  17%  of  the  land  area  has  fresh  water.  In  addition  to  lacking  fresh  water,  poor  households  in \nSindh,  and  particularly  in  the  project  area,  are  characterized  by  (i)  few  income-generating  options;  (ii)  low  levels  of \neducation (47% literacy for men, 14% for women); and (iii) unmet needs for transport, education, and health services. \nDrought is common, affecting the population dependent on non-irrigated lands in particular. \n\nSindh has a coastline of approximately 350 kilometers, a major portion of which comprises the Indus River Delta. The \ncoastal  areas  of  Thatta  and  Badin  districts  are  highly  vulnerable  to  natural  disasters  and  human  impact.  This  has \ncaused continued deterioration  of environmental conditions  and socioeconomic circumstances. Significantly  reduced \nflows  in  the  lower  Indus  have  reduced  the  availability  of  irrigation  water  from  the  Kotri  barrage  and  increased  tidal \nseawater intrusion in the lower reaches of the river. These conditions have resulted in a high level of environmental \ndegradation, consisting of tidal saltwater intrusion, productive land loss, decline in the mangrove habitat, concomitant \nerosion  along  tidal  creeks,  and  almost  certainly  a  loss  of  inshore  fish  stocks.  As  a  result  of  the  water  shortage  and \ndegradation  of  groundwater  and  surface  fresh  water  resources,  potable  water  sources  are  scarce,  with  severe \nimplications for agriculture, livestock, human health, and  income-generation options. As this continues, more people \nare  driven  to  fishing,  or  collecting  and  gathering  of  wood,  bamboo,  or  reeds  for  sale.  This,  in  turn,  puts  additional \npressure on the fragile landscape. \n\nIn  the  project  area,  almost  all  of  the  79%  of  households  below  the  poverty  line  of  $1  per  day  have  few  income-\ngenerating opportunities, little or no access to public services, and high vulnerability to environmental conditions and \necosystem erosion. A multipronged effort is needed to address poverty. The poor must have improved and diversified \noptions for income generation to reduce risk and increase household income. If the households engage in a focused \neffort to regenerate and improve usage of particularly saline areas their income options will expand, contributing to a \nhealthier,  sustainable  natural  resource  base.  These  households  also  must  have  better  access  to  public  services, \nparticularly  fresh  water,  transport,  sanitation,  and  opportunities  for  basic  education  and  health  services.  In  this  way, \nthey  can  be  healthy  and  aware  enough  to  exploit  new  income  options.  Finally,  households  must  work  together  to \nenable more effective choices for stabilizing and sustainably exploiting the changing natural environment in which they \nlive,  as  they  depend  heavily  on  their  physical  circumstances  and  landscape  for  most  of  their  income  and  their \nimproved safety.   \n\nSince  2001,  the  Government  of  Pakistan  has  approached  the  multiple  problems  of  poverty  reduction  much  more \naggressively.  Pakistan  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  signed  a  poverty  partnership  agreement  (PPA)  in \n2002.  National  and  provincial  poverty  reduction  strategy  papers  have  been  prepared.  In  recent  years,  the \nGovernment\u2019s  commitment  to  poverty  reduction  has  been  reflected  by  the  increasing  trend  in  pro-poor  public  sector \nexpenditure,  reaching  4.83%  of  the  budget  in  2005.  The  lessons  of  the  past  5  years  show  clearly  that  improved \ngovernance, broad-based economic growth (particularly in agriculture and the rural economy), better access to public \nservices, and expanded economic liberalization are the necessary elements for poverty reduction. The Project utilizes \nthese four elements, with the addition of improved natural resource management to help the area households sustain \nthe income effects. \n\n_________________ \na International Monetary Fund. 2004.

Of the 1.04 million persons in the project area, 79% live in poverty. Further, 54% \nof the populations in the eight talukas (subdistrict) were found to be extremely poor (compared with about 12% in the \nnational population).  \n \nThe  basic  causes  of  poverty  are  (i)  lack  of  access  to  productive  resources  (mainly  water  and  land);  (ii)  insufficient \npublic  services,  such  as  clean  water,  health  services,  education,  and  transport;  and  (iii)  erosion  of  household \nresources  and  income  generation  options  due  to  illness,  ecosystem  damage,  and  natural  disasters.  Low  levels  of \neducation  and  social  status  also  contribute  to  poverty.  The  lack  of  sustainable  land  and  water  ecosystem \nmanagement,  social  protection  measures,  participatory  governance,  entrepreneurship,  and  alternative  livelihood \nopportunities  make  the  landless\u2014and  women  particularly\u2014vulnerable.  Poverty  in  these  areas  is  correlated  with  (i) \nhousehold economic characteristics, such as no or low land ownership and few employment opportunities; (ii) lack of \naccess  to  basic  services,  leading  to  poor  health,  lack  of  education,  and  vulnerability  of  most  households  to  natural \nhazards;  and  (iii)  change  in  the  environment  from  fresh  water  to  brackish  water  systems,  and  a  lack  of  training  or \nability of the population to adjust to the change and sustainably manage their natural resource base due to insufficient \ninformation, social support, or community engagement. \n \nLandless, small farmers, and fisherfolk identified the main problems in Thatta and Badin as a shortage of fresh water \nsupply, income opportunities, and public services. The community groups\u2019 expectations of the benefits and impacts of \nthe  Project  are  (i)  improved  drinking  water  supply;  (ii)  improved  health  facilities,  including  access  to  medicines  and \nhealth care professionals; (iii) access to link roads between remote settlements; (iv) skills development and training, \nincluding  materials  for  schools;  and  (v)  livestock  improvement.  All  women  interviewed  expected  to  benefit  from  the \nProject mainly by improved drinking water followed by health services.   \n\nEconomic and Social Impacts \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  a  wide  range  of  alternative  livelihood  opportunities  interwoven  into  a  sustainable  natural \nresource  management  process.  Essential  public  services,  such  as  water  supplies,  roads,  bridges,  and  schools  and \ntraining,  will  be  provided  on  a  demand-driven  basis  to  complement  the  income-generation  options.  The  livelihood \nopportunities  will  include  but  not  be  limited  to  simple,  but  important,  natural  resource  management  arrangements, \nsuch  as  mariculture  and  mangrove  replanting.  Further,  certain  income  generation  options  will  encourage  more \ncommunity-based mobilization of resources and more sustainable use of the ecological base on which people live. By \nwidening their income options, and encouraging sustainable management of the coastal and inland areas, the Project \nwill  reduce  poverty  while  also  mitigating  the  ecological  impact  of  sea  encroachment.  Group  access  to  community-\ndriven  public  services,  such  as  water,  roads,  health  care,  and  education,  will  lower  the  poverty  of  services  access, \nwhich  is  a  significant  problem  in  the  country  and  the  region.  Access  to  safe  areas  and  disaster  preparedness \narrangements through the Project also will help households ameliorate risk. \n \nThe project design aims to ensure that the poor, particularly women, receive a substantial share of the benefits from \nincome  growth  generated  by  the  Project  through  increased  production  and  employment  opportunities.  Mangrove \nplantings  and  mariculture,  community  mobilization,  skills  training  and  links  to  microcredit,  and  the  provision  of  small \ngrants  for  social  services  and  small-scale  infrastructure  are  the  main  project  interventions.  The  Project  will  reinforce \ncommunity interest in mangroves, and reward labor for tending and managing the plantings. Household incomes will \nincrease  and  domestic  nutrition  will  improve  by  developing  mariculture  options  for  village  households.  Households \nalso  will  have  the  opportunity  to  expand  income  sources  through  skills  training  and  access  to  microcredit. \nImprovement in  water supplies, increased  access to  health and education services, and links to  public services and \nmarkets through roads, culverts, and bridges  will help  increase labor productivity and better access to  both markets \nand information. Supportive institutional development work for the Coastal Development Authority in fisheries, and in \ndistrict governments will help orient the government services framework to address poverty more actively. \n \n\n \n                                                 \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n26     Appendix 2 \n\nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nThe  project  design  is  based  on  a  participatory  process  that  included  rapid  assessment  surveys  and  interviews  with \nfocus  groups  and  individual  farmer  groups,  fisherfolk,  landless,  and  women.  These  activities  led  to  an  inventory  of \nlocal  needs,  problems  and  constraints  related  to  (i)  water  resources  in  relation  to  domestic  agriculture,  fisheries, \ntransport,  environment,  and  other  uses;  (ii)  possible  solutions  to  resolve  the  constraints  identified,  including  their \npositive  and  negative  impact  on  local  interest  groups;  (iii)  implications  of  solutions  on  poverty  reduction;  and  (iv) \nprioritization of water resources needs relative to other development needs. Stakeholder workshops synthesized the \nfindings and resulted in the development of an action plan of interventions, and in a mechanism to institutionalize the \nlocal community participation in the anticipated interventions. Stakeholder workshops were held in November 2005 in \nDistrict Coordination Officer offices in Badin and Thatta, and in the field with individual farmers and groups of women \nfrom  September  to  December  2005.  The  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  team  held  consultations  with \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  involving  approximately  50  participants  each,  in  Badin  and  Thatta  in  April \n2006. In July 2006, the Special Project Mission held similar consultations in Thatta. The project appraisal team held \nvillage  consultations  with  20\u201350  participants,  both  men  and  women,  in  each  of  the  15  sample  villages  throughout \ncoastal Badin and Thatta during 18\u201323 September 2006. \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nIs there a participatory social development strategy prepared?  \n \nProject implementation will be based on a participatory community mobilization and resource assessment and access \nprocess  that  will  strengthen  village  life  and  enhance  confidence  for  beneficiaries.  National  Rural  Support  Program \n(NRSP)  will  provide  leadership  and  confidence  building  training  for  organizational  and  capacity  building  among  all \nbeneficiaries,  with  participation  specifically  targeted  at  the  poor  and  women\u2019s  groups,  in  preparation  of  developing \ncommunity organizations capable of sustained household  income expansion and social service access. Civil society \nwill  be  strengthened  by  the  interaction  of  NRSP,  International  Union  for  the  Conservation  of  Nature  and  Natural \nResources (IUCN), and government departments with villagers, and by participating communities understanding they \nhave resources available so they can make their own choices about investments in needed services or infrastructure. \nThe participatory process, especially for the selection of small grant-based interventions, training, and engagement in \nmangrove  and  fish  ponds,  will  put  into  place  procedures  for  meaningful  beneficiary  participation  in  all  stages  of  the \nProject. The process will include (i) beneficiary-run, NGO-supported processes of resource mapping, poverty profiling, \nhousehold investment planning, and reflection and learning; (ii) procedures and guidelines for beneficiary selection of \nproject  interventions;  (iii)  beneficiary  participation  in  the  design,  planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  the \nproject activities; and (iv) a comprehensive strategy for access to grant funding and regular project-level coordination \nmeetings  with  representatives  of  NRSP  and  the  district  government.  The  Project  will  establish  procedures  for  close \ncoordination  among  district-level  administration,  NRSP,  IUCN,  and  community  organizations  for  effective  service \ndelivery.   \n \nD. \nGender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nGender  disparity  and  female  disadvantages  are  inherent  features  of  the  social  structure  in  Pakistan  and  in  Sindh \nProvince. Most Muslim women, who constitute the majority of women in Sindh, spend their time in unpaid household \nwork  and  are  restricted  in  their  movement  and  decision  making.  Women  in  minority  Hindu  castes  migrate  between \npaid jobs on a seasonal basis. Apart from fieldwork,  women in paid employment tend cattle and buffalo, collect and \nsell milk, and are involved in sewing and embroidery. \n \nA  central  issue  for  women  in  Sindh  is  chronic  ill  health.  Although  the  Project\u2019s  gender  strategy  seeks  to  empower \nwomen, and to maximize their economic and social benefits within the norms and culture of Sindh, it is important to \nunderstand  that  poor  physical  circumstances  (especially  lack  of  clean  water  and  limited  access  to  medical  facilities) \nlimit the participation of a large proportion of women from economic activity. The Project\u2019s interventions will reduce this \nconstraint substantially. \n \nThe Project adopts a gender mainstreaming strategy that aims to: \n \n\n(i) \n\nContribute to the government of Sindh\u2019s poverty reduction strategy, where gender equity plays a major \nrole through capacity building of communities, including women, as agents of development. Community \nmobilization  and  leadership  training  will  lead  to  women  playing  a  growing  role  in  the  affairs  of  their \ncommunities. The target of female community organization formation and operation is 50%.   \n\n(ii) \n\nIncrease  the  understanding  of  project  staff  at  all  levels  about  the  role  of  women  in  coastal  and \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2       27\n\n \n\necosystem  management,  and/or  rural  development.

Many people in \nthese communities live in abject poverty. Most communities have little access to clean drinking \nwater,  and  some  communities  do  not  have  any  fresh  water  at  all.  Almost  all  communities \ncomplain of lack of opportunities, poor or nonexistent health facilities, and inadequate schools \nwith absent teachers. \n\n2. \nThe economy and sustainability of these rural communities are intimately bound up with \ntheir immediate environment. This environment consists of the mangrove swamps and creeks at \nthe outer fringe of the Indus Delta and their fisheries, as well as the land above high tide level \nwhere subsistence agriculture, with village livestock and fish farming, is practiced. Many of the \nlocal  communities  depend  almost  completely  on  the  resources  in  the  mangrove  swamps  for \ntheir  survival.  Environmental  impoverishment  also  is  high  due  to  (i)  the  effects  of  periodic \ncyclones,  (ii)  the  long-term  reduction  in  flow  of  the  Indus  River,  (iii)  salt  water  intrusion  at  the \nsurface  by  tidal  encroachment  and  in  the  subsurface  water  accessed  by  wells,  and  (iv)  the \ngeneral decline of the mangrove swamp ecosystem. \n\nSindh coastal households exist in an environment that narrowly defines their economic \n3. \noptions. Human interaction with the environment can cause further damage to incomes and to \nthe coastal zone, or help stabilize it and generate opportunities to earn additional income. Given \nthe circumstances of the coastal communities, the key to poverty reduction is a combination of \nincome  and  non-income  interventions  in  the  context  of  a  sustainable  natural  resource \nmanagement process. Accordingly, understanding the coastal environment and its products and \ncircumstances  is  essential  to  determining  how  to  improve  livelihoods  for  its  inhabitants.  The \nfocus areas are mangroves, fisheries, and important plants. \n\nB. \n\nMangrove Ecosystems \n\n4. \nThe  economic  importance  of  mangroves  in  Pakistan  largely  comes  from  the  fishery \nresource that they harbor. An estimated 80% of the fish caught in coastal waters spend at least \npart  of  their  life  cycle  as  fry  in  the  mangrove  creeks,  or  depend  on  the  food  web  within  the \nmangrove ecosystem. Shrimp fishery is the major fish export of mangroves, accounting for 68% \nof the $100 million of the foreign exchange the country earns from fisheries exports. The annual \nshrimp  landing  has  reached  its  maximum  sustainable  yield  of  about  30,000  metric  tons.1  A \nJune/July ban on shrimp fishing also has been implemented.  \n\n5. \nThe  mangrove  swamps  of  the  Sindh  coastal  zone  are  extensive,  covering  243,000 \nhectares  (ha)  compared  with  7,400  ha  along  the  Balochistan  coast.2  The  zone  also  has  large \nareas  of  bare  mud  flat.  The  system  is  intersected  by  large  and  small  creeks  that  allow  tidal \nwater  to  move  into  and  out  of  the  area  during  the  twice-daily  ebb  and  flow  of  the  tides.  The \nmangrove swamps are made up of several indigenous species of trees that are adapted to live \nin brackish water or sea water. The main species in the area is the black mangrove Avicennia \nmarina, which has aerial roots growing up out of the mud. The swamps also have less common \nspecies of mangrove tree, the main one on the Sindh coast being the red mangrove Rhizophora \nmucronata. This has prop roots that grow out from the main trunk and then down into the mud, \nstabilizing the plant. Both species of mangrove tree are important sediment and soil stabilizers. \n\n_________________ \n1   Meadows and  Meadows. 2001. Coastal Zone Management and Environmental Impact Assessment.

Karachi. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3       29\n\n \n\nSeveral species of marine seaweed also grow in mangrove swamps, often as algal mats on the \nsurface of the mud.  \n\n6. \nThe  mangrove  swamps  are  relicts  of  the  estuarine  conditions  that  once  existed  in  the \nSindh region, although exact figures on their size are difficult to obtain. Before the construction \nof  dams  and  barrages,  mangroves  covered  an  estimated  43%  of  the  intertidal  area.  This  has \ndeclined to about 1% of the total area. The exact cause of this reduction is not known, although \nthe  current  lack  of  fresh  water  input  is  often  blamed.  One  view  is  that  the  process  might  be \ndifficult to reverse. \n\n7. \nThe  mangrove  swamps  are  an  important  part  of  the  biodiversity  of  the  coastal  zone  of \nSindh.  The  mangrove  swamps,  bare  mud  flats,  and  mangrove  creeks  support  many  animals \nalong  the  Sindh  coast.  These  include  a  large  number  of  invertebrates,  such  as  mussels, \noysters, and shrimp, as well as many species of fish in the creeks. The young stages of shrimp \nand fish live in the creeks, and move offshore as they grow. Some species of birds also use the \nswamps  as  wintering  grounds  during  their  long  distance  migrations.  Although  few  scientific \nstudies have been conducted in the area, a 1980 survey of the Keti Bundar and Turshian Creek \narea listed more than 40 species of fish and invertebrates.  \n\n8. \nMangrove  swamps  provide  a  complex  series  of  resources  and  livelihoods  to  local \ncommunities,  such  as  those  at  Keti  Bundar  and  Shah  Bundar,  as  well  as  communities  living \nfurther  inland.  The  mangrove  trees  are  used  for  firewood  and  building,  while  the  mangrove \ngreen shoots and leaves are used as fodder for livestock, for medicinal purposes, and as food \nfor the villagers in some cases. The 100,000 people living along the northern edge of the Indus \nDelta  use  an  estimated  18,000  tons  of  mangrove  firewood  each  year.  At  certain  times  of  the \nyear,  about  16,000  camels  are  herded  into  the  mangroves  and  left  to  browse  for  about  6 \nmonths. The creeks provide a source of shrimp and fish for the local village fisherfolk working \nfrom small inshore boats. Bees that live in the mangroves and above the high tide level inland \nprovide honey, which is a valuable marketed commodity.  \n\nMangrove  swamp  ecosystems  face  a  number  of  threats,  as  they  are  an  exploitable \n9. \nnatural  resource  for  the  rural  communities  along  the  Pakistan  coast.  Man-made  and  natural \nimpacts  have  degraded  the  mangroves.  These  include  (i)  construction  of  dams  and  barrages, \n(ii) fresh water diversion for irrigation, (iii) decrease in fresh water input and sediment load, and \n(iv) increase in salinity. For example, the estimated historic fresh water flow down the Indus is \nabout 150 million acre feet (MAF) per year (180 billion cubic meters). However, over the past 70 \nyears, water abstraction for irrigation has reduced dramatically the supply of fresh water to the \nmangrove forests. The flow reaching the Indus Delta now is less than 35 MAF (43 billion cubic \nmeters), and could decline further to about 10 MAF (12 billion cubic meters) in the next three to \nfive  years.  The  amount  of  silt  discharged,  which  was  about  100  million  tons  per  year,  is \npredicted to fall to 30 million tons during the same period.3 Other threats include domestic and \nindustrial pollution, overgrazing by animals, overcutting of mangroves by rural communities, and \ncyclones and storms. \n\n10. \nSea level rise caused by global warming poses a major long-term environmental threat \nto the Sindh coastline and its mangrove swamps.4 Over the past century, the rise has been 1.1 \nmillimeters per year. While the predicted sea level rise of 2.00 millimeters per year will support \nmangrove  growth,  anything  above  this  rate  would  cause  a  loss  of  mangroves.  This  would \nrequire  replanting  species  with  longer  propagules,  such  as  Rhizophora  mucronata,  and \npropagating  Avicennia  marina  on  higher  grounds,  as  is  occurring  along  the  Balochistan \ncoastline.  In  the  proposed  Project,  a  strong  case  can  be  made  for  interplanting  Rhizophora \n_________________ \n3  IUCN. 1992.

Fisherfolk and camel \nherders will be affected by the sea level rise. Sea encroachment will affect directly some of the \n300,000 people of the coastal areas of Thatta district alone. Moreover, salt intrusion will make \nthe agricultural land even more unsuitable for cultivation. Based on the number of fishing boats \naround  Gharo,  Keti  Bundar,  Karo  Chan,  and  Shah  Bundar,  an  estimated  20,000  people  could \nbe directly impacted on an immediate basis, with many more families affected over the medium \nterm.  \n\n11.  Mangrove  plantation  programs  produce  proven,  positive  environmental  consequences. \nThe  most  immediate  result  is  a  shielding  of  the  area  on  the  landward  side  of  the  plantations \nfrom  monsoonal  and  cyclonic  waves  and  wind.  This  protection  becomes  more  pronounced  as \nthe  trees  increase  in  height.  Progressively,  more  noticeable  changes  are  seen  in  creek \nmorphology and position, with associated changes of water flow into and out of the mangrove \nsystem. Changes of sediment deposition and location of mud banks also occur. The presence \nof  new  developing  stands  of  mangrove  trees  have  a  positive  impact  on  biodiversity\u2014more \nspecies  of  animals  and  plants  become  established  in  the  mangrove  creeks  and  forest.  As  a \nresult,  the  food  webs  become  more  complex  and  more  stable.  The  economic  consequences \ninvolve the input of increased jobs and money into local communities. \n \nC. \n \n12. \nCoastal rural communities largely operate the inshore and near-shore fisheries along the \nSindh  coast.5  Although  these  fisheries  are  well-established,  they  are  almost  uncontrolled  and, \nhence,  unregulated.  They  consist  of  a  range  of  commercial  finfish  and  shellfish.  Rural \ncommunities  access  the  fisheries  by  going  directly  into  the  mangrove  swamp  creeks,  or  by \noperating fishing vessels of various sizes. \n\nFisheries, Bivalves, and Crabs \n\n13. \nIndividual fisherfolk go into the mangrove areas to catch small finfish with one- or two-\nman operated nets, which are used from the shore or thrown by the fisherfolk while standing in \nshallow water. Adults and male children catch crabs in the mangrove swamps by wading in to \nwaist level, and then using baited fishing lines or multi-pronged rods like garden forks. Villagers \nalso operate small to medium-sized fishing boats. The smallest boats are 10\u201315 feet long, carry \none to four fishermen, and operate close to shore in the mangrove creeks. These boats go out \nhourly or daily. Medium-sized fishing boats range in size from about 20 feet to about 45 feet in \nlength,  and  carry  between  five  and  30  fishermen.  They  go  out  daily  or  weekly.  The  small  and \nmedium-sized  fishing  boats  use  a  variety  of  nets,  including  seines  operated  between  pairs  of \nboats, drift nets, trawls, and nets pinned to the seabed to catch fish in the tidal flow. Some of the \nnets  are  not  legal,  and  are  confiscated  on  an  ad  hoc  basis  by  Sindh  fisheries  personnel  with \npolice. Confiscation is risky as guns can be used. \n\nAccording to a 1986 survey of fishing gear used in Pakistan,6 Sindh fisherfolk use shrimp \n14. \ntrawlers and tukri (entangle gill net used for shrimp), rach (gill net used to catch small pelagic \nfish), katra (surround net used to catch small pelagic fish), jalla (cast net), gujii (small drag net), \nbhoola (tidal trap net), and others (beach seine and long lines). Based on a study of fishing nets \nin  the  Indus  Delta,  the  estimated  landing  in  1  month  by  the  katra  net  was  5,040  metric  tons, \nwhich included 1.68 metric tons of trash fish. The estimated bhoola net monthly catch was 473.6 \nmetric tons of fish and 28.4 metric tons of shrimp.7 \n\n_________________ \n5  Ahmad, M. 1985. Marine Fisheries of Pakistan.

The  marine  finfish  landings  have \nincreased  by  about  5%  annually,  and  this  fishery  is  believed  to  have  potential  for  expansion. \nThis  has  meant  that  many  fisherfolk  have  continued  to  take  out  loans  and  become  bonded  to \nmiddlemen,  resulting  in  economic  deprivation.  The  fast-growing  population  and  the  influx  of \nmigrating fishing communities to the Indus Delta has put huge pressure on this natural resource. \n\n16. \nStudies conducted in 1986\u20131987 suggested that the fishery was still under-exploited and \nhad room for expansion. The fishery has expanded since then, and landings in 1990 exceeded \n120,000 tons. Signs of overfishing are emerging, as catches, catch per unit effort, and average \nsize  of  catch  of  some  species  of  shrimp,  pomphret,  hilsa,  and  barramundi  are  declining.  \nFisherfolk  are  unaware  of  overfishing,  which  they  sometimes  associate  with  the  type  of  gear \nused. Generally, they believe that the fish are sent by Allah and he will provide these.  Fisherfolk \nmust understand that their direct action will reduce the supply of fish. \n\n17. \nThe  analysis  of  the  mangrove  shrimp  stocks  of  the  Indus  Delta  have  focused  on \nestimates  of  total  catch  and  effort  from  grouped  species  taken  by  an  offshore  trawler.  This \nassessment  concluded  that  the  shrimp  resource  was  overexploited,  and  suggested  ongoing \ncollection of catch, effort, and length and frequency data based on a defined sampling strategy. \nA  World  Bank  review  of  the  National  Conservation  Strategy  emphasized  that  not  many \nproposed  projects  addressed  Pakistan\u2019s  capture  fisheries.  An  Asian  Development  Bank \nFisheries Sector Study in 19878 found that a stock assessment had not been conducted within \nthe  marginal  mangrove  creek  and  estuarine  system.  Further,  this  study  stressed  that  the \nreduction in fish and shrimp stocks is real, foreseeable, and requires research.  \n\nAn  Artemia  salina  (brine  shrimp)  culture  industry  has  the  potential  for  development, \n18. \nwhich would provide an excellent source of food for larvae, juvenile, and adult stages of fish.9 \nThis  species  is  easy  to  grow,  and  has  been  used  successfully  in  some  countries  as  diet  for \nfinfish and shellfish. It also has a market as food for aquaria species. \n\n19.  Marine  mussels  and  oysters  are  known  to  be  present  in  the  mangrove  swamps.  Their \nyoung  stages  occur  naturally  as  floating  plankton  in  the  sea  water  of  the  creeks.  These \neventually attach to solid surfaces in the mangrove swamps, such as the roots of mangroves, \nand  develop  to  maturity.  The  field  culture  of  these  shellfish  has  significant  potential,  as  the \ntechniques are relatively simple and have been tested in other countries. Marine mussels and \noysters are a high-value catch on the international market. \n\n20. \nSeveral species of marine crab are known to grow in the mangrove areas of the Sindh \ncoast. They are valuable sources of income for rural communities. Villagers collect the crabs as \nmature  adults  from  wild  populations  in  the  mangrove  creeks.  Recent  trials  at  Sandspit  by  the \nCentre  of  Excellence  in  Marine  Biology,  University  of  Karachi,  have  suggested  that  crab  pond \nculture has high potential. Sited at the high tide level, the ponds are flushed with clean seawater \ntwice a month at spring high tides. In this work, the crabs are obtained as small animals from \nthe wild population and transferred to the ponds, where they can grow to a marketable size. The \nsame researchers also are working on the production of seed. \n\nD.  \n\nBamboo, Reeds, and Salt-Tolerant Grasses \n\n21. \nThe coastal zone landward of high tide in Sindh becomes more arid in the inland areas. \nThe  habitat  is  often  termed  coastal  sabkha.  Overall,  the  habitat  is  extremely  arid  with  sparse \nnatural vegetation cover and low plant biodiversity. Soil conditions are very dry with a high salt \ncontent. Strong coastal winds and erratic periods of rain in the summer impose additional stress \n_________________ \n8 Asian Development Bank. 1987. Pakistan Fisheries Sector Study. Asian Development Bank.

The natural vegetation, which is highly adapted to the area, is able to grow in \nplaces that are very dry and salty. This natural vegetation is dominated by succulent perennials \nand perennial grasses, including more than 100 halophytic (salt-tolerant) species in 36 families. \nGrasses  (including  bamboos)  dominate,  and  some  sedges  and  succulent  chenopods  can  be \nfound.  Acacia  (Acacia  nilotica  ssp.  Indica:  babool)  and  prosopsis  (Prosopsis  juliflora)  are  also \ncommon  in  certain  locations.  Some  of  the  halophytic  species  not  only  germinate  under \nconditions of high salinity, but also are viable for long periods in seawater. The seeds of some \nspecies germinate quickly, within hours in some cases, demonstrating the plants\u2019 adaptation to \nvery dry conditions and the sporadic input of brackish or salt water. \n\n22. \nThe local populations use the natural halophytic vegetation in the sabkha coastal zone \nfor  building;  fodder  for  domestic  camels,  buffalo,  goats,  and  poultry;  food;  and  in  some  cases \nmedicine. Local rural communities use the fruits of some species as food, and young leaves and \nshoots are used as cooked vegetables and in salads and pickles.10 The oil in some of the seeds \nis  used  for  preparing  soap  and  for  producing  candles.  The  seeds  of  Salvadora  oleoides  and \nSalvadora persica (Mustard tree or Toothbrush tree) contain 30%\u201340% fat, which is very useful \nfor  such  products.  Some  of  the  halophytic  species  also  are  used  to  stop  itching  (Salsola \nimbricata) and coughing (Salvadora oleoides), and to cure eye infections (Zygophyllum simplex) \nand stomach problems (Thespesia populnea).  Such plants, with demonstrated economic value,  \ncan be of great use for bio-reclamation of very saline soils where other plants will not grow.   \n\nThe  halophyte  plant  group  at  the  Department  of  Botany,  University  of  Karachi,  has \n23. \ndeveloped  one  of  the  more  interesting  potential  tools  for  improving  income  generation  of  the \nlocal rural communities in these areas. This group has grown some halophytic grass species in \nexperimental  field  trials  with  communities  on  the  Balochistan  coast,  using  plots  irrigated  with \nbrackish water. The grass species have been tested as fodder for livestock. Animals prefer to \neat these grass species, and put on more weight compared with control animals not fed on the \ncultivated grasses. These grass species and related ones have potential for testing on the Sindh \ncoast in the coastal sabkha.   \n\nE. \n\nSeaweed \n\n24. \nSeaweed grows naturally in seawater between high tide and a depth of 10 meters in the \nsea.  In  Pakistan,  they  are  common  along  the  coast,11  growing  on  the  seabed,  on  rocks  and \nboulders, in mangrove swamps and creeks, and in the intertidal zone. Seaweed is not cultivated \nat a small rural community level or on a commercial scale in Pakistan at this time. \n\n26. \nSeaweed  (or  macro-algae)  and  micro-algae  are  marine  plants,  and  the  primary \nproducers in marine food chains, especially in nearshore and inshore waters. Their importance \nas a source of food for a range of marine herbivores is paramount. They also contribute to food \nwebs,  nutrient  release,  and  detritus  in  the  mangrove  ecosystem.  Seaweed  is  categorized  into \nthree  major  groups:  green,  brown,  and  red.  All  are  present  along  the  Sindh  coastline, \npossessing  potential  economic  importance  as  food,  fodder,  and  fertilizer,  as  well  as  in  the \npharmaceutical industry. Seaweed also has great export potential. \n \n\n_________________ \n10 Ali, Nasir, and Qaiser, eds. 1999. Flora of Pakistan. Karachi.University of Karachi; and Khan, Ajmal and Bilquees \nGul.  2002.

The  species  used\u2014some  of \nwhich are also present along the Pakistan coast\u2014include the red seaweed Porphyra, the brown \nseaweed  Undaria  and  Laminaria,  and  the  green  seaweed  Enteromorpha  and  Ulva.  They  are \nused  as  food  and  as  a  source  of  gelatin,  agar,  carrageenan,  alginates,  mannitol,  and  iodine. \nGoiter, for example, can be treated by using products from the red alga Porphyra, which is rich \nin  iodine.  In  Japan,  nori  (Porphyra)  has  been  cultivated  for  human  consumption  for  three \ncenturies, with a typical value of 35.6% protein in the dried form. Nori contributes $1 billion to \nthe Japanese economy (350,000 tons wet weight). \n \n28.  Many scientific studies have been conducted on seaweed species along the Sindh and \nBalochistan coast, including their identification and chemistry.12 The HEJ Institute of Chemistry \nand  the  Department  of  Botany,  University  of  Karachi,  have  done  much  of  this  work,  which \nincludes  the  role  of  seaweed  as  sources  of  antimicrobial  and  antifungal  agents.  However,  no \nprograms are underway in Pakistan to develop seaweed farming. Technical expertise would be \navailable from People\u2019s Republic of China and Japan among other places.  \n \n29. \nCoastal  zone  seaweed  in  Sindh  could  be  utilized  in  two  ways  to  enhance  the  living \nstandards  of  local  rural  communities.  First,  members  of  rural  communities  could  harvest  the \nnatural  growth  of  seaweed.  This  will  require  an  initial  field  survey  to  establish  the  extent  of \nseaweed cover in the mangrove creeks and at the edge of the coastal zone near such villages \nas Keti Bandar. The technology is straightforward and can be undertaken from inshore fishing \nvessels.  Information  also  might  be  available  from  fisherfolk  in  the  communities.  Second, \nseaweed-farming  technology  could  be  introduced.  This  will  require  pilot-scale  studies  followed \nby longer-term seaweed farming programs in the mangrove creeks and related marine waters. \nThe  rural  coastal  communities  also  will  need  training.  Both  routes  potentially  could  make \nsignificant  contributions  to  uplifting  rural  communities  and  generating  income,  especially  for \nthose  living  in  or  close  to  the  shoreline  and  mangrove  swamps.  In  addition,  the  potential  for \nseaweed export to the international market is considerable. \n\n_________________ \n12 Ali  et  al.  2000.

The  use  of  well-being  ranking  or  similar  is  the \nsuggested  mechanism  for  selecting  areas  under  the  Project.  NRSP  should  first  enter  areas \nscoring poorly on well-being rankings in unions, villages, and settlements, particularly in coastal \nareas  and  near  potential  mangrove  and  crab  or  prawn  pond  sites.  Final  selection  of  the  target \nareas  should  consider  the  need  to  have  cost-effective  and  manageable  clusters  for  project \nintervention.  \n \n2. \nNRSP has a firmly established participatory process in place for identifying and selecting \ncommunity-initiated  schemes.  The  division  of  roles  between  NRSP  and  the  communities  has \nalso has been laid out clearly. The current approach and processes need to be continued with \nsome  modifications.  NRSP  should  educate  the  community  organizations  on  criteria  for \nprioritization of the village-level schemes identified through participatory processes. The following \ncriteria are agreed: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\nthe  potential  of  the  scheme  to  satisfy  practical  and  strategic  gender  needs  of \nwomen and girls, \nthe potential to benefit the poorer and disadvantaged sections of the community, \nthe potential to create a sustainable medium- and longer-term impact on existing \npoverty and social inequality,  \nnot to have the potential to create adverse environmental impact, and \ncommunity  organizations  must  provide  counterpart  funds  totaling  at  least  5%  of \nthe scheme cost, of which 3% must be in cash to be set aside for operation and \nmaintenance (O&M).  \n\n2.  \n\nEstablishing Integrity in Small-Scale Initiatives \n\nNRSP  has  the  basic  elements  of  integrity  systems  and  processes  in  place  through  its \n\n3. \ncommunity-oriented and transparent approach, such as: \n\nregular public meetings and reviews, \npublic signing of the agreement in the community,  \nproject register (book) at the community level, \nuse of market rates for works estimation, and \nformation and use of a community organization audit committee. \n\n \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n \nThe  following  additional  measures  need  to  be  taken  to  strengthen  the  system  and \n\n4. \ncontinue the good practices:  \n \n\n(i) \n\nEmphasis should be placed on NRSP staff and community organization managers \nusing the last project-related public meeting as a public audit of the work (quality, \nquantity, prices of materials, wage rates paid to the workers, and dissemination of \ninformation  regarding  who  contributed  what  and  why),  and  ways  forward  for  the \n\n \n\n \n\n\f(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\nAppendix 5       37\n\n \n\ncommunity.  NRSP  staff  must  understand  fully  the  importance  of  such  public \nmeetings in ensuring transparency. \nMost  of  the  NRSP  staff  do  not  understand  fully  the  importance  of  the  project \nregister  as  the  anchor  for  transparency,  and  books  are  sometimes  incomplete. \nNRSP  engineers  and  social  organizers  and  the  community  organizations  need \nadditional orientation to understand and enforce the immediate information access \nand validation aspect of the project register. \nAlthough NRSP uses local market rates for labor, work, and materials, it needs to \neducate  the  communities  on  the  standard  market  practices.  This  includes  such \narrangements  as  price  concessions  of  around  10%\u201320%  for  cash  payments  of \nmaterials.  Day  labor  payments  should  be  recorded  based  on  what  is  received, \nrather  than  quantifying  meals.  This  will  help  ensure  that  concessions  are \naccounted for properly and village elites do not pocket them for personal benefit. \nUse  of  a  Web  site  developed  by  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  to  post \ninformation  on  all  of  its  schemes  in  different  villages  implemented  through  the \nProject  will  add  to  the  transparency  of  the  processes  and  decisions.  NRSP  also \nshould  use  other  media  (local  radio,  posters,  and  religious  meetings)  to \ncommunicate  information  on  the  small-scale  initiatives  to  the  community. \nAdditionally,  the  NRSP  and  its  community  organizations  can  use  this  public \ninformation system to post any community concerns in the project areas, such as \nabsence of teachers from the school or bad conditions in a health post. The local \nNRSP  office  can  print  out  the  relevant  Web  pages  in  Sindhi,  and  post  them  in \nlocations in the area. \nNRSP engineering staff\u2019s awareness and insights into the practices of civil works \ncorruption needs to be strengthened. The schedule of work rates used by NRSP \nneeds  serious  review  and  revision,  at  least  for  some  of  the  items,  such  as  road \nbuilding  through  the  use  of  bulldozers  and  rollers.  NRSP  also  needs  to  inject  a \nsense  of  advocacy  among  its  staff  against  corrupt  practices,  as  well  as  a \nheightened sense of awareness on the pitfalls of corruption.  \n\n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nMonitoring Indicators for Small-Scale Initiatives \n\nThe  following  are  some  indicators  suggested  for  use  in  project  monitoring,  and \n\n5. \nmilestones to be used by district project implementation unit (DPIU) and NRSP: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\nthe  number  of  project  registers  kept  in  complete  form  without  errors  by  the \ncommunity organizations; \npercentage of villagers (women and men) who can accurately report the costs of \nthe project; \npercentage  of  villagers  (women  and  men)  who  attended  the  project  completion \nmeeting; \npercentage  of  villagers  (women  and  men)  who  attended  at  least  three  public \nmeetings  organized  for  the  implementation  of  the  small-scale  initiative  in  the \nvillage; \nnumber  of  NRSP-supported  community  organizations  that  are  implementing \nprojects independently without technical support from NRSP; \ntotal funds used by NRSP-facilitated initiatives; \npercentage  of  projects  passing  a  final  quality,  price,  and  completion  status \ninspection by the DPIU and NRSP; and \npercentage  of  projects  in  full  operation  and  with  quality  maintained  in  the  asset \nafter 2 years. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n38     Appendix 5 \n\nB. \n\nMedium-Scale Initiatives \n\n \n\n1. \n\nIdentification and Selection of Medium-Scale Initiatives \n\n6. \nThe  community  areas  will  demand  medium-scale  initiatives  from  the  district  project \nimplementation  unit  (DPIU)  through  a  local  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)  following  a \nprocess  that  meets  certain  prescribed  standards  for  transparency  and  participation.  These \ninclude (i) at least one public meeting attended by at least 60% of the beneficiary households in \nthe  concerned  area  to  discuss  and  plan  the  proposed  project;  (ii)  verification  by  the  DPIU  of \nwhether the proposals received meet the prescribed minimum criteria; and (iii) prioritization and \nfinal selection of the proposed initiatives by a selection committee of five members, based on the \nfollowing transparent criteria:   \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\npotential  to  benefit  the  poorer  and  disadvantaged  sections  of  the  community, \nparticularly women; \npotential to create a sustainable medium- and longer-term impact on the poverty, \nenvironment, and social inequality; \nability to incorporate measures to promote transparency and accountability in the \nimplementation of the interventions; and \nability of the beneficiaries to contribute 2% counterpart funds in cash or in kind. \n\nthe \n\nThe  Coastal  Development  Authority  (CDA)  director  general  will  chair  the  selection \n7. \ncommittee,  which  will  comprise \nfollowing  other  members:  (i)  additional  secretary, \nGovernment of Sindh (GoS) Works and Services Department; (ii) district coordination officer of \nThatta  or  Badin  District  (depending  on  the  location  of  the  application);  (iii)  representative  from \none  of  the  three  NGOs  on  the  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  by  rotation;  and  (iv)  a  senior \nwoman representative from a local NGO working in the relevant district project area, or (if local \nNGOs  cannot  agree  on  a  candidate)  a  representative  from  the  district  chapter  of  All  Pakistan \nWomen\u2019s Association for either Thatta or Badin.  \n \n\n2. \n\nIntegrity Process for Medium-Scale Infrastructure \n\n8. \nThe NGO requesting the project on behalf of the community will ensure transparency and \naccountability of the processes. The NGO is required to use at least the following proven tools \nand mechanisms for ensuring transparency and accountability:  \n\n \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\ncommunity-led transparent process of project identification and selection; \nan independent project selection committee (para. 7); \ncomplete  project  register  of  the  type  used  by  NRSP  in  all  its  civil  infrastructure \nworks; \ncommunity  review  and  reporting  of  the  project,  including  (a)  public  awarding  of \ncontract  to  winning  bidder  and  oath-taking  by  officials,  (b) midterm  review  and \nreporting, and (c) final review (public audit) and reporting; \npublic  posting  of  project-related  information  on  Web  sites  and  public  bulletin \nboards in the project areas; and \na  committee  with  oversight  responsibilities  for  selection  of  contractors  for \nimplementation. \n\n3. \n\nMonitoring Indicators for Medium-Scale Initiatives \n\nThe following indicators may be monitored for medium-scale initiatives: \n\n(i) \n\nnumber  of  public  meetings  held  regarding  the  project  with  participation  of  at  least \n60% of the beneficiary households; \n\n9. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5       39\n\n \n\n(ii)  number of bidders for each tender issued; \n(iii) \n\nthe  difference  between  the  prices  quoted  by  the  highest  bidder  and  the  lowest \nbidder; \nthe difference between the prices estimated by the government department and the \nlowest bidder (winning contractor); \nthe difference between the work rates quoted by the winning bidder and the actual \nwork rate paid at the construction site; \nthe  number  of  project  registers  kept  in  complete  form  without  errors  by  the \ncommunity organizations; \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii)  percentage of villagers (women and men) who can accurately report the costs of the \n\nproject; \n\n(viii)  percentage  of  villagers  (women  and  men)  who  attended  the  project  completion \n\nmeeting;  \nfunds used by medium-scale initiatives; \n\n(ix) \n(x)  percentage  of  projects  passing  a  final  quality,  price,  and  completion  status \n\ninspection by DPIU and PMU; and \n\n(xi)  percentage of projects in full operation and with quality maintained in the asset after \n\n2 years. \n\n \n\nC.  \n\nGrievance Review Mechanism \n\n \nTo enhance governance in the planning and implementation of small- and medium-scale \n10. \ninitiatives, and to address key risks such as elite capture, the Project will establish a grievance \nreview mechanism. This will allow the project beneficiaries and the local stakeholders within the \nproject  areas  to  raise  complaints  concerning  the  planning,  construction,  operation,  or \nimplementation of the small- or medium-scale  interventions. This Project, therefore, will have a \nhigher  level  of  accountability  to  beneficiaries  and  interested  stakeholders.  Such  measures  also \nwill allow early identification and mitigation of project implementation issues.   \n\nrelated \n\nAn  aggrieved  party  can \n\nreport  complaints  and  grievances \n\n \nto  project \n11. \nimplementation, even anonymously, to the NRSP social organizer or a designated person from \nthe PMU. If the complaint is submitted to the NRSP social organizer, then it will be forwarded to \nthe  designated  person  in  the  PMU  for  documentation  and  action  as  appropriate.    A  list  of \ngrievances  and  the  status  of  the  redress  process  will  be  placed  on  the  project  Web  site  and \nreported  back  to  the  complainant.  This  will  allow  the  aggrieved  party  to  track  progress  in \nredressing his or her grievances. Similar information will be posted on the community boards. In \naddition, the NRSP social organizers will report this information in regular community meetings. If \na  person  is  unable  to  address  the  issue,  he/she  should  bring  the  matter  to  the  attention  of  the \ndirector general of CDA, who is required to seek proper redress to grievances. If the complainant \nis  not  satisfied  with  the  results,  she/he  may  appeal  to  the  chairman  of  the  PSC  for  further \nassistance. The specific mechanism will be developed within 6 months of loan effectiveness.  \n \n\n \n\n\f(US$ \u2018000) \nForeign \n \n \n0 \n\nTotal \n\n \n \n9,465 \n\n \nExchange \n \n \n0 \n\n% of \nTotal \nCosts \n\n4\n0\n \n \n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n6\n \n \n \n \n \n\ni\n\nAppendix 6  \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nItem \n \nA.

Every  community  organization  forms  three \ncommittees  for  projects:  project  committee  (3\u20135  persons),  audits  committee  (2  persons),  and \noperations  and  maintenance  (O&M)  committee  (2  persons  from  the  project  management \ncommittee). The project committee manages the implementation of the initiative with technical, \nmanagerial, and social support from National Rural Support Programme (NRSP). NRSP and the \ncommunity  organization  are  jointly  responsible  for  financial  management  of  the  project.  The \nNRSP  engineer,  social  organizer,  and  manager  review  the  projects  for  feasibility.  The  district \nproject implementation unit rural engineer and safeguards specialist periodically will spot-check \nto  ensure  the  projects  are  being  undertaken  properly.  Funds  are  released  in  tranches  to  the \nbank account of the community organization for joint release by the president and secretary of \nthe community organization and the NRSP area field engineer.   \n \n2. \nItem 7 Method of Implementation. International Union for Conservation of Nature and \nNatural  Resources  (IUCN),  NRSP,  and  the  Sindh  (Provincial)  Forest  and  Wildlife  Department \n(SFWD) will engage communities living near the planting areas that self-select to participate in \nmangrove  planting  and  establishment.  NRSP  will  assist  in  setting  up  the  community \norganizations, \nleadership,  minute-taking,  and  other  social  capital-building \narrangements. IUCN will arrange for community training in sustainable mangrove management, \nand  in  mangrove  planting  and  tending  techniques.  SFWD  will  manage  the  physical  nursery \nestablishment and mangrove planting processes, providing all necessary technical and logistical \nsupport  for  the  processes,  plus  arrange  standard  and  suitable  payment  for  agreed  services \n(nursery  tending,  planting,  monitoring  and  guarding,  infill  planting,  and  other  minor  works, \nincluding construction of walkways). As IUCN and SFWD have undertaken this type of activity \nfor many years in adjacent areas, rates and processes are well-known. The SFWD will arrange \ncommunity  policing  and  replanting.  IUCN  (with  NRSP  links)  will  provide  communities  with \ntraining  and  technical  support  on  how  to  protect  and  use  the  mangrove  areas  sustainably  for \nfodder, fuel, and fisheries production and sale. IUCN will mark out all areas by global positioning \nsystem  to  be  placed  in  the  Coastal  Development  Authority  geographic  information  system; \nmonitor nursery, planting, infill, and maintenance processes; and report on results. \n\nfacilitating \n\n  \n\n\f52 \n\n     Appendix 10 \n\nASSESSMENT OF NATIONAL RURAL SUPPORT PROGRAMME \n\n \n1. \nAs part of the Sindh Coastal Community Development Project, the government of Sindh \nanticipates  providing  a  blended,  results-based  contract  for  the  provision  of  community \norganization  and  household  income  generation,  and  small-scale  interventions  in  the  eight \ntalukas (subdistrict) of coastal Badin and Thatta. Over 6 years, a minimum of 1,388 community \norganizations  will  be  formed,  and  no  less  than  700  villages  will  undertake  small-scale \ninterventions.  Based  on  lessons  learned  and  an  assessment  of  district-based  nongovernment \norganizations  (NGO)  working  in  the  project  districts\u2014and  given  the  need  for  rapid  start-up  to \nassist  these  communities\u2014the  National  Rural  Support  Programme  (NRSP)  will  be  the  sole \nsource for this contract. Alternative selection methods will be too time-consuming and inefficient, \nbecause  of  lack  of  capacity  of  district-based  NGOs,  as  well  as  coordination,  approach,  and \nreporting  problems  arising  from  the  use  of  multiple  NGOs.  This  could  delay  start-up  and \npotentially  create  implementation  problems.  Accordingly,  an  assessment  of  the  capacity  and \nqualifications  of  the  NRSP  was  undertaken  to  justify  the  single-source  selection.  NRSP\u2019s \npresence in the two project districts, and its successful history of community development in 34 \ndistricts  and  82  talukas  throughout  Pakistan,  places  it  in  a  unique  position  to  expand  to  the \nharsher coastal zone of Sindh. A more detailed assessment is in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \n2. \nNRSP  Establishment. In  1991,  the  Government  supported  the  countrywide  replication \nof the Rural Support Programme model, which culminated in the creation of the NRSP. In 1992, \nthe  Government  provided  NRSP  with  a  grant  of  PRs500  million  to  start  operations.  As  other \nresources  became  available,  particularly  from  development  partners  but  also  from  provincial \ngovernments,  NRSP  expanded  beyond  the  initial  eight  districts.  Cost  recovery  from  NRSP\u2019s \nmicrocredit program, which constitutes the largest portfolio of any microfinance organization in \nPakistan  with  160,893  active  loans  totaling  PRs1,779  million  ($29.6  million),  now  provides  a \nsignificant proportion of NRSP\u2019s operating funds. Rising contributions from donor agencies are \nthe main source for NRSP\u2019s expansion.  \n \n3. \nEvidence of Impact. NRSP\u2019s performance was evaluated as part of a case study for the \n2004  Shanghai  Conference  on  Scaling  Up  Poverty  Reduction.  Membership  in  an  NRSP \ncommunity  organization  resulted  in  an  estimated  7.5%  higher  household  income  annually. \nSimilarly,  NRSP  estimates  show  that  poverty  levels  were  lower  in  member  households  (Khan \n2002). The United Nations Development Program (UNDP)-supported Pakistan National Human \nDevelopment  Report  2003  states  that  (i)  68%  of  the  NRSP  respondents  ate  their  fill  daily, \n(ii) 68% ate better than before, (iii) 50% felt improvements in health, and (iv) 82% experienced a \nsustainable increase in income after accessing credit. A study of 35 rural water supply schemes \nin  Punjab  (Khan  1999)  concluded  that  NRSP  schemes  were  more  cost-effective  and  had  a \nhigher  success  rate  in  sustainable  service  delivery  than  schemes  undertaken  directly  by \nGovernment.  A  1998  UNDP  evaluation  of  NRSP  observed:  \u201cIn  sum,  the  NRSP  model  is  \u2026 \nhighly  responsive  to  community  motives  and  aspirations  within  the  context  of  community \nparticipation.  NRSP\u2019s  experiences  suggest  that  it  is  feasible  to  unlock  the  productive  and \nentrepreneurial potential of Pakistan\u2019s rural people.\u201d (UNDP 1998).  \n\n4. \nExperience  in  the  Project  Districts.  NRSP  has  been  operating  for  12  years  in  Badin \nand 6 years in Thatta. It has engaged in community mobilization, savings, and implementation \nof small-scale civil works in these areas.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n                                                                                  Appendix 10 \n\n \n\n53\n\nTable A10.1: Current National Rural Support Programme Areas in Thatta and Badin \n\nDistrict \nBadin \n \n \n \n \nThatta  \n \n \n \n\nTehsil/Taluka \nBadin \nGolarchi \nTando Bagho \nTalhar \nMatli \nThatta  \nSajawal  \nMirpur Sakro \nMirpur Bathro \n\nField Unit \nBadin \nGolarchi \nTando Bagho \nTalhar \nMatli \nThatta \nSajawal \nMirpur Sakro \nMirpur Bathro \n\n \n\n \nSindh Coastal Community Development Project areas. \nSource:  National Rural Support Program records.  \n\n \n5. \nNRSP  has  a  regional  office  in  Hyderabad,  a  district  office  in  Badin,  five  field  offices  in \nBadin, and four in Thatta. Field offices are set up within 25 kilometers of a working area, with \ntwo  social  organizers,  one  engineer,  and  one  credit  officer,  plus  a  driver  and  general  support \nstaff. The current offices are too far from the project area to serve them. Thus, two offices,1 one \neach in Ghorabari and Jati, will be set up for the project. \n\n6. \nThe  regional  budget  last  year  was  about  PRs80  million  ($1.3  million).  Infrastructure \ninvestments were PRs88.1 million for a 2.5-year phase, or about PRs35.2 million per year. The \nADB  proposal  is  for  expenditures  of  about  $5.5  million  over  6  years  of  operations,  or  PRs55 \nmillion a year, and about PRs80 million a year in small-scale interventions. This will increase the \noverall regional budget by 69% and the infrastructure budget by 229%, highlighting the need for \nsignificant staffing additions and management enhancements in the project area.  \n\n7. \nSocial  Mobilization  and  Small-Scale  Interventions.  Community  organization  and \nplanning will form the core activities under the Sindh Coastal Community Development Project \n(SCCDP).  NRSP  community  organizations  have  proven  successful \nthe \nidentification  of  needs  by  villages,  and  in  arranging  for  demands  to  be  met  effectively  in \nparticipatory  ways.  Community  organization  members  and  their  households  currently  can \naccess  services  from  NRSP,  including  training,  microcredit,  and  support  for  small-scale  civil \nworks  interventions.  NRSP  also  has  put  in  place  important  sustainability  measures,  and  is \nhelping  community  organizations  to  register  as  Citizen  Community  Boards  in  order  to  access \nfunding from district governments.  \n\nfacilitating \n\nin \n\nTable A10.2: Social Mobilization in Badin and Thatta:  \nCommunity Organizationsa and Savings \n \n\nOrganization \n\nItem \nCommunity \nFormation \n       Men \n       Women \n       Mix \n\nBadin \n2,206.00 \n\n1,654.00 \n432.00 \n120.00 \n\nThatta \n817.00 \n\n486.00 \n199.00 \n132.00 \n\nTotal \n3,023.00 \n\n2,140.00 \n631.00 \n252.00 \n\n_________________ \n1  The  budget  provides  for  incremental  staffing  and  costs  for  the  regional  and  district  offices  assuming  that  the \nfollowing project will finance their establishment: ADB. 2002.

NRSP is the only organization operating in the area that has proven capacity to do \ncommunity  mobilization  and  implementation  of  civil  works  at  the  proposed  scale.  In  the  Badin \nand Thatta area, 433 projects have been completed at an average grant of about PRs400,000. \nThese  projects  have  benefited  more  than  24,000  households.  Local  community  members  are \ninvolved  in  the  entire  process  of  physical  infrastructure  schemes\u2014from  identification  and \nplanning  to  execution,  monitoring,  and  maintenance.  This  creates  a  sense  of  ownership  and \nresponsibility.  Local  community  groups  have  contributed  a  significant  amount  of  the  project \ncosts, approaching 29% in both areas, mostly through labor.   \n\nTable A10.3: NRSP Community Physical Infrastructure in Thatta and Badin \n(as of 31 August 2006)a \n \n\nItem \nCompleted projects \nTotal cost (PRs million) \n       Donor share \n       Community share \na  These  numbers  refer  to  the  schemes  implemented  through  direct  input  by  NRSP.

NRSP  has  strong  mechanisms  for \n9. \nHuman  Resource  (HR)  development, \nInstitute  of  Rural \nManagement  (IRM).  All  staff  participates  in  a  15-day  induction  program  which  includes  field \ntime,  and  are  subject  to  a  6-month  probationary  period.  The  main  method  of  professional \nrecruitment is through their internship program, a 6-month program offered to Master\u2019s degree \ngraduates,  which  serves  as  an  extended  induction  program,  including  classroom  and  field \ntraining.  All  interns  go  through  general  training,  as  well  as  specific  and  targeted  modules, \ndepending  on  their  position.  In  addition,  staff  undergo  annual  refresher  trainings  of  3\u20135  days. \nNRSP carries out annual performance evaluations for all staff. Performance is closely linked to \npromotions  and  salary  increases.  Currently,  about  22%  of  staff  are  female,  but  only  8%  at \nmanagement  level.  The  average  graduating  class  from  the  internship  program  has  40% \nfemales. \n\n10. \nNRSP  is  struggling  with  high  attrition  rates,  mainly  due  to  competition  from  other \norganizations and projects that offer better remuneration packages. However, the organization \nis  likely  to  be  able  to  employ  highly  trained  and  qualified  staff  to  implement  the  SCCDP.  The \nstrategy  to  address  large  staffing  needs  and  expansion  will  include  (i)  using  the  internship \nprogram as the main recruitment mechanism, and providing retention bonuses for women; and \n(ii) dividing the experienced staff in two, with half the group working under SCCDP with newly \nrecruited staff. NRSP will be able to expand its current staff in the project area by an estimated \n4-5  times.  This  means  that  management  capacity  will  have  to  be  upgraded  to  supervise  this \nexpanded program. \n \n11. \nBudgeting  and  Financial  Management.  Strong  and  transparent  budgeting  and \nfinancial  management  mechanisms  are  in  place.  The  Finance  and  Accounts  Department \n\n \n\n\f \n\n                                                                                  Appendix 10 \n\n \n\n55\n\nmaintains the central treasury of NRSP. As such, it is responsible for overall cash inflows and \noutflows,  utilization  and  management  of  funds,  consolidation  of  accounts,  budget  preparation, \nand reviewing the effectiveness of internal financial controls. An Internal Audit department was \nestablished in 2005 to conduct routine internal audits and investigations. External auditors also \naudit  each  district  office,  regional  office,  head  office,  IRM,  and  donor-funded  projects  at  least \nonce a year. The World Bank, which has certified NRSP financial management systems since \n2001, found their audit and management letters acceptable. \n\n12.  Management  Information  Systems  and  Strategic  Planning.  NRSP  has  established \nsophisticated management information systems (MIS) with clear sets of management indicators \nthat  it  tracks  regularly  in  Microsoft  Access.  Data  recording  begins  with  the  community \norganizations,  which  record  all  details  of  activities,  including  minutes  of  meetings,  resolutions, \nand attendance rates. The field units collect data about every community organization, such as \n(i)  number  of  members,  (ii)  savings,  (iii)  training  courses,  (iv)  microcredit  provided  and  repaid, \n(v) infrastructure projects implemented, and (vi) funds released. Data collected in the field units \nare  submitted  to  the  regional  offices,  where  it  is  verified  and  consolidated  into  a  monthly \nprogress  report  (MPR).  The  regional  MPRs  and  the  sector  data  from  the  various  departments \nare  consolidated  into  a  single  monthly  program  update  at  the  Monitoring,  Evaluation  and \nResearch  (MER)  unit  at  the  head  office.  The  MER  unit  also  consolidates  information  and \nprovides trend analyses for the biannual program management meeting, where all districts are \nrepresented.  These  data  and  reports  are  used  to  identify  policies  and  strategies.  While  the \norganization does not have a separate policy unit, a committee is appointed to develop policies \nas needed.  \n\n13. \nOther  Expansion  Plans.    The  ADB-funded  Sindh  Rural  Development  Project  recently \nselected NRSP as the sole source provider of similar services in four districts of Sindh, including \nBadin  and  Thatta.  The  relevant  project  officers  are  working  closely  to  ensure  consistency  and \nresource-sharing, as well as to not overburden NRSP. Given the expected level of engagement \nof both projects, (approximately $46 million over 5\u20136 years), NRSP capacity will be stretched. \nHowever, the achievement of project objectives is strongly likely.
