THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \ngrant to be provided by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) from its Special Funds resources, \nand (ii) a proposed grant to be provided by the Afghanistan Infrastructure Trust Fund (AITF),1 \nboth  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan  for  the  Preparation  of  Central  Asia  Regional \nEconomic Cooperation Corridors 5 and 6 (Salang Corridor) Project,2 and if the Board approves \nthe proposed grants, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the \nadministration of the grant provided by AITF. \n \n2.  The proposed project will assist the Government of Afghanistan in preparing the Central \nAsia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Corridors 5 and 6 (Salang Corridor) Project \n(ensuing project). The ensuing project will rehabilitate and upgrade the Salang Corridor\u2014one of \nthe few viable land routes linking the north and south of Afghanistan. The project will support the \ngovernment in (i) studying the feasibility of three alignment options for the rehabilitation and \nupgrade  of  the  Salang  Corridor;  and  (ii)  completing  the  detailed  engineering  design, \nprocurement documentation, and project and safeguard documents for the selected option.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Afghanistan is the geographic center of gravity in Central Asia, and has vast potential to \nbe the nexus between north\u2013south and east\u2013west regional trade corridors. Within Afghanistan, \none of the few viable land routes linking the south, including the capital of Kabul, with the north \nis  the  Salang  Tunnel  and  associated  connecting  roads,  collectively  known  as  the  Salang \nCorridor. Forming key sections of the CAREC Corridors 5 and 6, the Salang Corridor is the only \nroute that permits year-round north\u2013south passage of goods and people across the Hindu Kush \nmountain range, which has peaks over 7,700 meters above sea level. This makes the Salang \nTunnel one of the highest tunnels in the world. Given the lack of alternative routes, the vast \nmajority of goods shipped to Kabul from the north traverse the Salang Corridor. Conservative \nestimates suggest that over 5,500 vehicles per day transit the Salang Corridor\u2014far exceeding \nits capacity. \n \n4.  Planned and designed over many years, construction of the 2.7-kilometer Salang Tunnel \nwas  completed  in  1964.  During  more  than  50  years  of  service,  proper  maintenance  and \nrehabilitation did not occur regularly, if at all, as a result of the 30 years of internal conflict and \nassociated effects on sector governance. Road crashes, fires, conflict-related acts, and constant \nusage have contributed to the tunnel falling into a state of severe disrepair. Present conditions \nwithin the tunnel are dangerous to users because of inadequate ventilation, poor lighting, lack of \nproper modern safety features, and a failing road surface\u2014all of which constrain the traffic flow \nand incur an estimated economic cost of $60 million per year.3 If the tunnel completely fails, the \ncosts to the Afghan economy would be substantial and could pose an additional risk to the \nstability of the fragile and conflict-affected state (FCAS). \n  \n                                                \n1  Financing partners: the governments of Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and the governments of \nGermany and the Netherlands through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Afghan National Army Trust Fund. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  Based on the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). 2012. Salang Tunnel Feasibility Study. \nKabul. Economic costs include vehicle operating costs, road crashes, and travel time resulting from congestion. ", "2 \n \n5.  In 2012, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) completed a \nstudy that analyzed six potential options and various sub-options to solve the capacity problem \nand failure risk associated with the Salang Corridor. Although the USAID study was entitled the \nSalang Tunnel Feasibility Study, limitations on the budget and study scope produced what \nshould be termed a prefeasibility study\u2014identifying route options for further refinement and \nfuture study. In discussing the results, and given the very broad level of detail of this initial \nstudy, USAID and the government decided to further study the more promising options to obtain \na better estimate of the costs as well as the technical, economic, and financial viability.   \n \n6.  Since the publication of the USAID study, and given delays in moving forward with a \nlonger term solution, the World Bank agreed in 2015 to rehabilitate some of the most damaged \ngalleries in the existing tunnel, the road surface within the tunnel, and substantial sections of the \napproach roads\u2014as part of a larger project focused on rehabilitating the roads north of the \ntunnel from Baghlan to Bamyan. This will provide connectivity to the roads already rehabilitated \nor undergoing rehabilitation under the ADB-financed North\u2013South Corridor Project and tranche \n3 of the Multitranche Financing Facility for the Transport Network Development Investment \nProgram. 4 However, the World Bank-financed project will not result in a long-term solution to \nthe corridor traffic capacity constraint. It is a short- to medium-term solution for the Salang \nCorridor by keeping the existing tunnel open year-round and precluding a total failure of the \nstructure until a long-term solution is agreed on and implemented.5 \n \n7.  The ensuing project will improve regional and national connectivity by constructing new \ntunnels and connecting roads that will significantly improve the capacity of the Salang Corridor \nand thereby the transport network of Afghanistan. The ensuing project is consistent with the \ngovernment\u2019s national infrastructure priorities; is aligned with the objectives of ADB\u2019s interim \ncountry partnership strategy, 2014\u20132015 for Afghanistan and the Midterm Review of Strategy \n2020; and is included in the country operations business plan, 2016\u20132018 for Afghanistan.6   \n \n8.  ADB  has  assisted  Afghanistan  in  rehabilitating  CAREC  Corridors  5  and  6  through \n(i) completion of the North\u2013South Corridor Project,7 (ii) ongoing construction of the Jabul Seraj\u2013\nNijrab road, (iii) ongoing construction of the Kabul\u2013Jalalabad road, and (iv) planned construction \nof the approved yet remaining un-rehabilitated link in the North\u2013South Corridor between Dar-i-\nSuf  and  Yakawlang.  The  latter  three  interventions  are  being  funded  under  the  Transport \nNetwork  Development  Investment  Program.8 Collectively,  these two  CAREC  corridors form \nsignificant sections of Afghanistan\u2019s national transport network, providing connectivity between \nnorth and south as well as links to three of the four major urban centers: Mazar-e-Sharif, Kabul, \nand Jalalabad.  \n \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2006.

Through these interventions, ADB has accumulated a wealth of experience on how to \nexecute road transport projects in Afghanistan, which is an FCAS. Lessons include (i) ensuring \nthe security of consultants and contractors, (ii) the need for up-front support to the government \non project design, and (iii) the need for close support to the government on consultant selection \nand procurement. \n \n10.  Together with the other completed, ongoing, and planned ADB-financed interventions, \nas well as the World Bank-financed project, the ensuing project will increase the capacity, \nefficiency, and reliability of CAREC Corridors 5 and 6 by rehabilitating the Salang Corridor with \na long-term solution spanning a planning horizon of more than 50 years. The ensuing project \nwill  (i)  reduce  the  cost  of  passenger  and  cargo  transportation  between  the  southern  and \nnorthern regions of Afghanistan and Central Asia by reducing travel times; (ii) ensure the \nsecurity, reliability, and year-round use of the Salang Corridor by providing some redundancy \nthrough the availability of two alternative routes; and (iii) promote trade and investment.  \n \n11.  Additionally, the ensuing project will produce road safety benefits and may be a vehicle \nfor  introducing  private  sector  participation  in  the  transport  sector  through  possible  partial \nfinancing of construction and future operations and maintenance. Based on the previous USAID \nstudy  and  the  three  options  remaining  for  consideration,  the  ensuing  project  is  tentatively \nestimated  to  cost  $1,150  million\u2013$1,600  million,  including  taxes,  duties,  and  physical \ncontingencies. The feasibility study and detailed engineering design to be undertaken under this \nproject will provide more confident estimates. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact the project is aligned with is the accelerated implementation of the ensuing \nproject,  contributing  to  improved  efficiency  and  safer  movement  of  goods  and  people  in \nAfghanistan and across Central and West Asia. The outcome of the project will be the ensuing \nproject designed and procured, ready for implementation.  \n \n13.  The intended impact of the ensuing project will be enhanced regional connectivity and \ntrade  through  the  Salang  Corridor.  The  outcome  of  the  ensuing  project  will  be  improved \nefficiency and safer movement of goods and people through the Salang Corridor.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n14.  The  outputs  of  the  project  are  (i)  feasibility  studies  on  three  alignment  options \ncompleted; and (ii) detailed engineering design, procurement documentation, and project and \nsafeguard documents on the selected option completed. The two outputs relate to the two \ndistinct phases of the project. In the first phase, feasibility studies will be undertaken on the \nthree alignment options considered most viable in the USAID study.9 The options will be studied \nfrom a technical, financial, economic, social, and environmental point of view. The ability for \neach alignment option to meet long-term capacity needs will be assessed. Based on the results \nof the feasibility studies, the government, supported by ADB, will decide on the alignment option \nthat would best meet the future needs of the Salang Corridor. \n \n   \n                                                \n9  These are options 2, 3, and 4. Further details of the three alignment options are in the Project Administration \nManual (PAM, accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "4 \n \n15.  When the preferred option has been identified, the project will move to the second \nphase, which will undertake a detailed engineering design on the selected option, prepare \ndetailed cost estimates, formulate environmental and social safeguards planning documents, \nand complete advance procurement for the ensuing project to the stage of civil works contracts \nready to be signed.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n16.  The  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $31.37  million,  including  taxes,  duties,  and \ncontingencies (Table 1).10  \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n \nItem  Amounta \nA.

The government has requested a grant not exceeding $15,450,000 from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to help finance the project.11 The ADB-administered AITF will provide grant \ncofinancing of $15,920,000 to be administered by ADB.12 The ADB and AITF funding for the \nproject includes financing of taxes and duties.13 ADB financing of project taxes and duties is \njustified because (i) the amount will not represent an excessive share of the project investment \nplan, and (ii) the financing of the taxes and duties is material and relevant to the success of the \nproject. The financing plan is in Table 2. \n                                                \n10 Detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and detailed cost estimates by financier are in the PAM \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11  A country\u2019s eligibility for Asian Development Fund (ADF) grants under the revised grant framework is determined \nby its risk of debt distress. The latest debt sustainability analysis determined that Afghanistan had a high risk of \ndebt distress and was therefore eligible to receive 100% of its ADF allocation as grants. \n12 Financing partners: the governments of Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and the governments \nof Germany and the Netherlands through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Afghan National Army Trust Fund. \n13 Taxes and duties costs are the business receipt tax, estimated at 7%; the fixed tax on imports of 2%\u20137%; and \ncustom duties of 2%\u201316%. They do not represent an excessive share of the financing plan and are within \napplicable country partnership strategy parameters. ADB. 2005.

Considering  the  country\u2019s  political  situation,  FCAS  principles  and  practices  will  be \nadopted for processing and implementing the project. By offering up-front grant financing for the \npreparation of the ensuing project, the project is considered highly relevant from an FCAS \nperspective. Without the project, the government would not have any recourse to funds for \npreparing the ensuing project, which is of national strategic importance. The project will support \nthe government in raising the required resources for the ensuing project, including through the \npublic\u2013private  partnership  modality.  The  ensuing  project  will  fully  take  into  account  FCAS \nprinciples,  and  consider  how  to  allow  maximum  use  of  national  contractors.  Procurement \npackages will be prepared accordingly. \n \n19.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the executing agency of the project. The Ministry \nof Public Works (MPW), through the ADB-financed program management office (PMO), will be \nthe  implementing  agency.  Since  its  inception  in  2009,  the  MPW\u2013PMO  has  accumulated \nconsiderable experience in ADB-financed projects and is being reformed for greater efficiency. \nDuring  project  implementation,  the  MPW  will  ensure  that  a  team  of  staff  with  sufficient \nexperience  in  procurement,  engineering,  financial  management,  accounting,  and  program \nmonitoring and evaluation, as well as legal, administrative, and secretarial matters, is available \nin the PMO. The MPW will ensure that a project manager is assigned to the PMO for the day-to-\nday management and implementation of the project. The consultants to be recruited under the \nproject  will  offer  additional  capacity  to  the  PMO  in  areas  such  as  procurement,  financial \nmanagement, environment safeguards, and social safeguards. The PMO will also be equipped \nwith the necessary office space, equipment, and facilities to undertake its duties.  \n \n20.  Two international consulting firms will be mobilized for the implementation of the project. \nThe first will undertake the feasibility studies and detailed engineering design, while the second \nwill provide an independent proof check of the detailed engineering design to be developed by \nthe first firm, specifically for the tunnels and galleries. The terms of reference for both consulting \nfirms are in the project administration manual (PAM).14 Full technical proposals will be solicited \nfor the first firm, and simplified technical proposals will be used for the second firm. Both firms \nwill be recruited using the quality- and cost-based selection method with a quality\u2013cost ratio of \n90:10. Additional individual consultants and resource persons will be recruited to carry out \ncapacity building and implementation support to the PMO, especially in financial management, \nprocurement, and work requiring highly technical skills. Individual consultants and procurement \nof small equipment will be paid through an imprest account. Consultants will be selected and \nengaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). To ensure high quality of consulting services and to avoid start-up delays, the \n                                                \n14 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "6 \n \ngovernment requested ADB to select the consultants on its behalf. The MPW will negotiate and \nsign the contract with the selected consultants.  \n \n21.  Up to four armored vehicles will be procured for use by the consultants, as required to \nconform with the United Nations\u2019 Minimum Operating Security Standards. Procurement of the \narmored vehicles will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended \nfrom time to time). The contracts for armored vehicles will include provision for operation and \nmaintenance. At the conclusion of the contract, the armored vehicles will be handed over to the \ngovernment.  \n \n22.  The expected implementation period of the project will be from December 2016 to \nJune 2020.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n23.  The feasibility studies and detailed engineering design work to be undertaken under the \nproject are complex, but within the capacity of experienced international consulting firms. The ", "7 \nwork  under  this  project  will  require  a  highly  qualified  consulting  firm,  with  experience  in \ndesigning and procuring contractors for large-scale projects involving tunnels in difficult terrain \nand security environments. The project will assess the technical, economic, financial, social, \nand environmental feasibility of the ensuing project. Viable engineering options will be prepared \nand optimized for economy and construction efficiency in accordance with international practice \nand applicable standards. The designs will integrate climate-proofing measures and use proven \ntechnology  with  standard  materials  compatible  with  local  conditions.  Methodologies  in \ndeveloping a robust tunnel and road maintenance regime will be developed. Road safety will be \nexplicitly taken into consideration in the detailed engineering design.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n24.  The ensuing project will support Afghanistan\u2019s economic growth and reduce poverty by \nensuring reliable access between the northern and southern parts of the country. Under the \nproject, economic analyses will be conducted to evaluate the national and regional economic \nbenefits of the preferred tunnel option by comparing the with- and without-project scenarios, \nincluding risk-based analysis of failure without the project. Such a failure is not an unlikely \nevent. Financial analysis will also be prepared in consideration of the substantial demand for \nfunding for both construction as well as operations and maintenance. The financial analysis will \nconsider the application of tolls for funding part of the capital investment as well as operations \nand maintenance. The economic analysis will be conducted according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nthe Economic Analysis of Projects and the Cost\u2013Benefit Analysis for Development: A Practical \nGuide.15 It will cover all aspects of analysis as specified in ADB\u2019s Operations Manual on the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects and summarized in the Key Areas of Economic Analysis of \nInvestment Projects: An Overview.16  \n \nC.  Governance \n25.  Governance risks are prevalent in Afghanistan, in areas of public financial management, \nprocurement, and corruption. ADB conducted a financial risk assessment of the MPW and \nPMO, and found that the inherent and control risks were both moderate. The project has been \ndesigned to mitigate such governance risks. First, ADB will select the consultants to be recruited \nunder the project, reducing start-up delays. Second, ADB has prepared an updated financial \nmanagement assessment of the MPW and its PMO. This found that the MPW and its PMO have \nsignificantly improved their financial management capabilities in 2015, and now have adequate \nstaff and a satisfactory organizational structure for proper planning, accounting, disbursement, \nreplenishment, and reporting. Third, consultants recruited under the project will provide day-to-\nday support to the MPW and PMO on the financial management of the project. Details of the \nfinancial management assessment and disbursement procedures are described in the PAM.  \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MPW.

The project is not expected to have any impacts on gender and social dimensions. The \nproject will ensure that the ensuing project will be prepared in compliance with ADB\u2019s Handbook \non Poverty and Social Analysis: A Working Document.17Gender, labor, HIV/AIDS, and other \n \nsocial  risks related  to  the  ensuing  project  will  be  assessed,  and  a mitigation  plan  will  be \nprepared to address those issues. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n28.  The  project  will  support  the  development  of  an  environmentally  and  socially  viable \ninvestment project. Because the project is focused on project preparation, it will not have any \nadverse social and environmental consequences. The project is categorized C for environment, \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples. The  ensuing  project  will  be  designed  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and government laws, guidelines, \nregulations,  and  policies.  During  project  implementation,  the  consultants  will  prepare \nenvironmental impact assessments or initial environmental examinations, as applicable, along \nwith climate risk and vulnerability assessments, and environmental management plans that will \nbe incorporated in the project\u2019s procurement documentation. Similarly, resettlement planning, \nindigenous peoples\u2019 planning, and gender analyses will be conducted as applicable.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n29.
