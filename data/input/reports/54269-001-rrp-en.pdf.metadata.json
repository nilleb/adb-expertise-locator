These  measures  will  improve  the  sector\u2019s  financial \nsustainability  and  ensure  adequate  investment  in  critical  infrastructure,  which  will  help  reboot \neconomic growth and bring new employment opportunities when recovering from the pandemic \ncrisis.  Placing the  clean energy  transition  at the center  of  reforms,  the  program  will  accelerate \nmodern, reliable, and clean energy infrastructure to put greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions into \nstructural  decline.  The  program  will  support  the  government\u2019s  ultimate  objectives  of  improving \nquality of life and creating jobs by developing a robust private sector, fully aligned with the country \npartnership strategy for Uzbekistan, 2019\u20132023 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).1 \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nMacroeconomic  context.  Benefiting \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nfrom  high  commodity  prices,  Uzbekistan \nexperienced  robust  economic  growth  averaging  more  than  7%  in  the  first  part  of  the  2010s. \nHowever, since 2015, unfavorable external environment conditions, such as declining commodity \nprices and subdued growth of trading partner countries, slowed economic growth from 6.1% in \n2016  to  4.5%  in  2017.  In  response,  in  2017,  the  country  initiated  comprehensive  economic \nreforms  to  stimulate  demand,  foster  foreign  investment,  and  develop  the  private  sector. \nUzbekistan  has  made  good  progress  on  economic  reforms  while  entrenching  macroeconomic \nstability. Major structural reforms to date include implementing foreign exchange and tax reforms, \nimproving  macro  fiscal  management,  and  restructuring  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs).  The \ngovernment remains committed to structural reforms to sustain the economic development. \n \nAs a result, Uzbekistan maintained sound macroeconomic management leading up to the \n4. \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, achieving gross domestic product (GDP) growth of \n5.4% in 2018 and 5.6% in 2019. The government has pursued a prudent debt policy, with low \npublic  and  external  debt,  and  large  foreign  exchange  reserves.  In  2019,  public  debt  was \nsustainable, at 29.2% of GDP; and external debt was 43.5% of GDP, with strong foreign exchange \nreserves equivalent to 14 months of imports. The national poverty rate declined from 12.8% in \n2015 to 11.4% in 2018. The fiscal deficit widened from 1.9% of GDP in 2017 to 3.9% of GDP in \n2019  because  of  social  spending  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  structural  reforms.  A  currency \ndevaluation of 48% in 2017, price liberalization, and bank credit growth increased inflation from \n8.8%  in  2016  to  17.5%  in  2018.  Under  the  inflation-targeting  regime,  inflation  is  expected  to \ndecrease from 14.5% in 2019 to 12.9% in 2020, with target inflation less than 10% by 2021 and \n5% by 2023. \n \n5. \nCOVID-19 and the economic shock it has triggered are dramatically changing the short-\nterm  economic  outlook.  Wide-ranging  social  distancing  and  containment  measures  have \nnegatively affected the economy, with GDP growth dropping to 1.5% in 2020, while lower exports \nand remittances widened the fiscal deficit. The fiscal deficit is projected to increase to 5.6% of \n\n1  ADB. 2019. Country Partnership Strategy: Uzbekistan, 2019\u20122023\u2500Supporting Economic Transformation. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fGDP  in  2020  against  an  earlier  estimate  of  2.7%.  Support  from  multilateral  institutions  with \nconcessional  loans  will  help  cover  fiscal  needs  and  mitigate  the  impact  on  foreign  exchange \nreserves.  A  temporary  increase  in  the  fiscal  deficit  to  accommodate  emergency  spending  on \nhealth  care  and  social  support  is  appropriate.  The  macroeconomic  policies  are  expected  to \nmaintain Uzbekistan\u2019s fiscal and external sustainability. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) \nAssessment  Letter  corroborates  this.2 The  direction  of  macroeconomic  policies  is  well  aligned \nwith ADB\u2019s requirements for the PBL. \n \nSector  context.  Reliable  and  affordable  electricity  supply  is  fundamental  for  driving \n6. \neconomic  growth  and socioeconomic  development.  Joint-Stock  Company  (JSC)  Uzbekenergo, \nas a state-owned power utility, was tasked with providing electricity for Uzbekistan with a legally \nendowed monopoly and a vertically integrated supply chain covering generation, transmission, \nand distribution. Without a designated oversight body for the sector, Uzbekenergo undertook the \ncombined functions of planning, investment, day-to-day system operations, and regulation. This \nintegrated monopoly structure faced the challenge of meeting fast-growing power demand against \na backdrop of inadequate investment in the power sector, which has resulted in unreliable service \nand  slow  increases  in  generation  capacity.  In  March  2019,  to  address  this  challenge,  the \ngovernment embarked on comprehensive reforms\u2014starting from the creation of the Ministry of \nEnergy  (MOE)  as  the  lead  agency  for  the  sector,  and  unbundling  Uzbekenergo  to  facilitate \ncompetition  and  unlock  private  investment.  This  reform  is  a  complex  process  and  should  be \nguided  by  a  multistep  implementation  plan,  supported  by  legislation  reforms,  while  working  to \nchange the policies designed to address specific development constraints. \n \n7. \nCOVID-19 impact on sector. COVID-19 has visibly affected Uzbekistan\u2019s power sector. \nElectricity consumption declined 2.1% from the previous year in April 2020 and 5.7% in May 2020. \nIn addition, the government decided to withhold the scheduled tariff increase in April 2020 and \nnot to disconnect consumers for reasons of nonpayment during the pandemic. These measures, \ncombined with the decline in electricity consumption, led to an immediate drop in sector revenue. \nIn June 2020, the government urgently provided liquidity support of SUM750 billion ($73.3 million) \nfor the power sector from its Anti-Crisis Fund to mitigate the impact. While this support helped \nrelieve  the  financial  straits  temporarily,  the  sector  is  expected  to  face  pressure  to  maintain \nfinancial  liquidity  because  of  the  decreased  revenue  and  cash  flow.  The  sector  reforms  have \nreached  a  critical  juncture,  where  more  financing  and  targeted  policy  support  are  needed  to \nmaintain the momentum. \n \n8. \nPoor  financial  sustainability.  Uzbekistan\u2019s  power  sector  has  grappled  to  fund  new \ninvestments  because  of  its  poor  financial  performance.  Uzbekenergo\u2019s  financial  situation  was \nweakened  by  significant  technical  losses,  ad  hoc  tariff  adjustments  and  unstructured  pricing \npolicy, and poor collection rates. This was compounded by the adverse impact of the currency \ndevaluation  in  2017  on  its  foreign  currency  debt  exposure.  Uzbekenergo  recorded  losses  of \n$840 million in 2017, which the government absorbed. While the government has continuously \nrationalized the electricity tariff, with an average adjustment rate of 5.9% during 2007\u20132018, the \naverage electricity tariff remained at 70% of the cost recovery level in 2018 and 81% in 2019. \nWithout  adequate  tariff  adjustments,  combined  with  measures  to  reduce  technical  losses  and \nimprove collection rates, the fiscal gap in the sector is estimated at $270 million in 2020 and would \nreach $1.05 billion by 2023 (pre-COVID-19 estimate). The lack of creditworthiness limits financing \noptions  for  the  sector,  making  it  completely  reliant  on  limited  sovereign  financing  for  major \ninvestments. This, in turn, exacerbates underinvestment in the sector, reinforcing a vicious cycle. \n\n2  The  IMF  confirmed  the  sound  macroeconomic  management  and  fiscal  and  debt  position  of  Uzbekistan  in  the \n\nInternational Monetary Fund Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fLack of medium-term tariff policy. With ADB assistance, in April 2019, the government \n9. \nadopted a new tariff methodology that establishes pricing principles\u2014aimed at full cost recovery \nand adjustment of costs incurred through foreign exchange and other costs beyond the control of \nthe sector companies. Based on this, the government needs to announce a medium-term tariff \nincrease  program  to  remove  uncertainties  and  allow  consumers  to  plan  for  a  reduction  in \nconsumption. In addition, the authority to determine tariffs held by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) \nshould be transferred to an independent regulatory agency, combining technical and economic \nregulatory responsibilities over the sector, and insulated from political interference. Potential tariff \nincreases should be coupled with (i) tariff structure improvements to promote the efficient use of \nelectricity, and (ii) social assistance mechanisms to mitigate the impact on vulnerable groups. \n \n10. \nInadequate  revenue  collection.  The  metering  and  billing  systems  are  inadequate, \noutdated, and susceptible to tampering and potential manipulation of charges by consumers and \ntariff collection officers. The revenue collection rate was less than 80% in 2014. The government \ntook a dual approach of (i) introducing modern smart-metering infrastructure, and (ii) enforcing \npayment  discipline  through  the  Bureau  of  Compulsory  Enforcement  (BCE)  since  2017.  These \ncombined efforts improved the collection rate to 95% in 2019. However, the BCE charges a 5% \nfee  for  the  collected  revenue  by  BCE,  which  flows  out  of  the  sector  and  worsens  the  sector\u2019s \nfinancial health. In 2019, the revenue loss by BCE charges totaled about $90 million. Nationwide \nsmart-metering  infrastructure  will  address  unnecessary  cash  outflows  from  the  sector  while \nensuring the utilities meter, bill, and collect the revenue. This is high on the priority reform agenda.  \n \n11. \nUnreliable  electricity  service.  Uzbekistan  is  fully  electrified,  but  the  quality  of  the \nelectricity  service  is  poor  and  unreliable  because  of  transmission  bottlenecks,  aging  power \ngeneration and distribution assets. In addition, power outages and the quality of service are not \nappropriately monitored, and the sector lacks incentive and/or penalty mechanisms to maintain \nhigh-quality service and protect consumer rights. Unreliable power supply has negatively affected \npeople\u2019s livelihoods and businesses\u2019 profitability. More than 32% of firms in Uzbekistan identify \nthe lack of reliable electricity as a major constraint to doing business and a cause of losses, as \noutages  total  3.0%  of  enterprises\u2019  annual  sales,  which  is  worse  than  the  average  for  Eastern \nEurope and Central Asia.3 Small enterprises suffer more because of the lack of expensive diesel \nback-up generators. This issue is more pronounced in rural and remote areas during winter when \nelectricity demand surges and blackouts are common, lasting 2\u20136 hours a day. Women, as the \nprimary users of electricity in households, are disproportionately affected by the unstable and low \nquality  of  electricity  supply. 4  Reliable  power  supply  could  enable  women  to  operate  small \nenterprises and participate in income-generating and community activities.  \n \n12. \nLack  of  integrated  planning.  Some  56,500  gigawatt-hours  or  88.8%  of  the  electricity \ngenerated  in  2019  was  from  burning  fossil  fuels,  while  the  rest  was  from  hydropower.  The \ncountry\u2019s reliance on natural gas for electricity generation has increased from its share of 82% in \n2010.  The  energy  sector  is  the  predominant  source  of  GHG  emissions  in  Uzbekistan.  Power \nsector projects have been identified and implemented in an ad hoc manner\u2014lacking coordination \nwith gas subsector planning, as no single oversight body integrated the power and gas segments. \nThe absence of an integrated energy sector plan often leads to inefficient use of natural gas and \nunderinvestment  in  critical  energy  infrastructure.  At  current  natural  gas  production  levels,  the \nexisting proven gas reserves would last for only 20 years, making it imperative to shift to a more \nsustainable energy system.5 Despite rich solar and wind resources across the country, Uzbekistan \n\n \n\n3  World Bank. 2020.

BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2019. London. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\flacks a coordinated policy to incentivize increased solar and wind deployment.6 The country could \nalso benefit from increasing electricity trade with hydro-rich neighboring countries. \n \n13. \nPrevalent  energy  inefficiencies.  Uzbekistan  is  the  second  most  energy-intensive \neconomy  in  Europe  and  Central  Asia,  as  measured  by  energy  intensity  per  unit  of  GDP.  The \naverage  efficiency  of  thermal  power  plants  is  only  33%,  well  below  the  53%\u201356%  average \nefficiency of modern combined cycle gas turbines. A significant part of the distribution lines was \nbuilt during the Soviet era from the 1950s to 1970s, and more than 80% of the distribution lines \nand about one-third of substation transformers are in urgent need of replacement. Losses in the \ntransmission  and  distribution  system  in  2019  averaged  17.4%,  which  is  threefold  those  in  the \nOrganisation for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  countries.  District  heating  is  one  of \nthe most inefficient segments of the industry. The efficiency of heat generation equipment is 65%\u2013\n70% (the international benchmark is more than 90%) and losses in the heat network reach 40%\u2013\n50% in extreme cases (the international benchmark is less than 15%). \n  \n14. \nInefficiencies emanate from the use of outdated equipment and technologies across the \neconomy.  Agriculture  and  irrigation,  which  account  for  21%  of  electricity  consumption  in \nUzbekistan, rely heavily on old pumping infrastructure\u2014more than 65% of 5,000 pumping stations \nhave exceeded their useful life. The metallurgy, cement, and chemicals industries still operate the \nmost  electricity-intensive  technologies.  The  integration  of  improved  energy  efficiency  in  the \nsector\u2019s  policy  direction  will  help  mainstreaming  energy  efficiency  measures,  energy  audits, \nenergy-efficient  buildings,  and  upgraded  labeling  appliances. Implementing  policies  to  improve \nenergy  efficiency  will  be  necessary  to  manage  fast-growing  electricity  demand  and  meet  the \ncountry\u2019s commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  \n \n15. \nConstrained private sector participation. Given the sector\u2019s heavy reliance on limited \nsovereign financing, unlocking private participation is inevitable to ensure adequate investment in \ninfrastructure. The government expects electricity demand to double by 2030, and $26 billion is \nrequired  to  add  17  gigawatts  of  generation  capacity  to  meet  this. 7 However,  the  unfavorable \nregulatory  framework  and  nascent  investment  environment  have  discouraged  private  sector \nparticipation. The government enacted the Law on Public\u2013Private Partnership (PPP) in 2019 to \nprovide  government  support  and  protect  investors  with  supplementary  legislation.  These \nregulatory  frameworks  and  supporting  programs  need  to  be  tested  with  model  projects. \nMonopolistic regulations, such as prohibiting private generators from accessing the national grid \nand selling electricity, need to be deregulated. Utilities\u2019 lack of experience of private projects, and \npotential political interference in dealing with state-owned off-takers, remain risks.  \n \n16.  Weak governance. The MOF and multiple state committees and commissions shared the \nregulatory  responsibility  for  the  sector  until  2019,  and  the  role  of  each  entity  was  not  clearly \ndefined.  The  Cabinet  of  Ministers  (COM)  made  policy  decisions  (e.g.,  industry  structure, \nregulation, and the corporate structure of operational entities) at the highest level because of the \nsector\u2019s importance, while the MOF undertook administrative regulation of many operational or \ncommercial  decisions.  The  government\u2019s  policy  formation  and  execution  roles  need  to  be \nreoriented  and streamlined,  with  a  dedicated  independent regulatory  unit  for  sector regulation. \nDespite  attempts  to  corporatize  Uzbekenergo, corporate  governance  has remained  weak.  The \nresulting lack of creditworthiness has limited financing options and made Uzbekenergo primarily \nreliant  on  sovereign  financing  for  capital  projects.  Reliance  on  sovereign  financing  also  led  to \n\n \n\n6  The  United  Nations  Development  Programme  estimates  Uzbekistan  to  have  the  following  renewable  energy \npotential:  biomass  (800 megawatts  [MW]),  solar  (593,000  MW),  wind  (1,600  MW),  and  small  hydro  (1,800  MW). \nUnited Nations Development Program. 2014.

Little \ninformation on Uzbekenergo\u2019s performance has been disclosed to the public, key performance \nindicators  were  not  monitored  closely,  and  associated  incentives  and/or  penalty  mechanisms \nwere absent.  \n \n17. \nPrevious reform efforts supported by ADB. ADB sector reform support has focused on \nimproving  the  internal  management  system  and  institutional  strengthening  of  Uzbekenergo. \nAchievements include the adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the \ncreation  of  the  center  for  financial  management,  and  asset  revaluation.8 Policy  reform  support \nbecame necessary to respond to the emerging needs for comprehensive and substantial sector \nreforms.9 Since 2018, ADB support has shifted to the policy reform agenda, including a new tariff \nmethodology,  a  sector  master  plan,  transaction  advisory  support  for  PPP  projects,  and  policy \nadvisory on the power market design. In addition, ADB\u2019s Economic Management Improvement \nProgram, aimed at improving the governance and financial viability of SOEs, helped design and \nimplement the sector reforms, benefiting from ADB\u2019s strong presence in policy dialogue.10 \n \n18. \nLessons. The program draws on lessons from power sector reform initiatives across the \nglobe. Strong government commitment and adequate support from all stakeholders, including key \ndevelopment partners, are critical prerequisites for a successful policy-based reform program.11 \nIn addition to the MOE, the MOF and the Ministry of Investment and Foreign Trade monitor and \nbalance the reforms, while the progress of reforms is regularly reported to the President\u2019s office \nand  the  COM.  In  the  energy  sector,  the  Ministry  of  Investment  and  Foreign  Trade  has  been \neffectively \nfor \nReconstruction  and  Development  (EBRD),  and  the  World  Bank.  This  will  provide  a  strong \nmonitoring and evaluation platform for effective continuation of the reform initiatives. Technical \nassistance  (TA)  support  and  policy  advice,  coordinated  across  development  partners  and \nprovided in parallel with budget support programs, can help push the reform agenda and build \ncapacity.12 The program will be supported by ongoing TA and new TA to be provided by Agence \nFran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) including the tariff affordability study.13 \n  \nB. \n  \n19. \nThe government has a strong reform agenda in the power sector, with the overarching \nreform  objectives  of  restructuring  the  industry  to  enable  competition  and  creating  a  conducive \nenvironment  for  private  investment  in  the  sector. 14  In  developing  the  reform  program,  the \ngovernment  undertook  high-level  policy  dialogue,  monthly  development  partners  coordination \nmeetings, and multiple diagnostic and analytical studies supported by key development partners, \nincluding  a  sector  master  plan  and  new  tariff  methodology  (ADB),  an  impact  study  of  tariff \nincreases and a power market design study (World Bank), and a power sector decarbonization \n\nleading  monthly  coordination  meetings  with  ADB, \n\nPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition  \n\nthe  European  Bank \n\n \n\n8  ADB.  2010.

The  program\u2019s  four  pillars  are  (i)  power  sector  restructured  and  regulation \nstrengthened,  (ii)  sector  financial  sustainability  improved,  (iii)  power  sector  carbon  intensity \nreduced, and (iv) demand-side energy efficiency increased. \n \nReform  area  1:  Power  sector  restructured  and  regulation  strengthened.  Policy \n20. \nactions  focus  on  strengthening  the  sector  regulation  and  paving  the  way  for  competition. \nSubprogram  1  will  ensure  that  the  MOE  provides  overall  oversight  of  the  sector  entities, \nharmonizes  the  sector  investment  program,  and  charts  the  reform  direction.  In  April  2020,  the \nMOE  adopted  a  power  sector  development  program,  2020\u20132030,  setting  a  reform  road  map \ntoward  a  wholesale  market  where  electricity  is  traded  between  generators  and  resellers.  As  a \nresult of the sector reform (para. 6), Uzbekenergo was vertically unbundled into three successor \ncompanies: (i) JSC Thermal Power Plants (TPP) for generation, (ii) JSC National Electric Grid of \nUzbekistan (NEGU) for transmission, and (iii) JSC Regional Electric Power Networks (REN) for \ndistribution. Horizontal unbundling was completed, with 10 JSC thermal generation plants under \nJSC TPP, and 14 JSC provincial distribution companies under JSC REN. Vertical unbundling will \nallow each unit to focus on its core mandate without the distraction of balancing its interest against \nother  parts  of  the  business,  and  facilitate  greater  transparency  in  financial  management  and \naccounting for costs. The horizonal unbundling will allow for the entry of new players and create \nan environment where companies compete to provide lower prices. To promote gender equality \nin the energy sector, the MOE adopted a sector policy for promoting gender equality, including \ngender-responsive human resources policies and women-friendly infrastructure in the workplace. \n \n21. \nShares of the unbundled companies were transferred to the Agency for Management of \nState  Asset,  a  state  property  management  unit  responsible  for  performance  monitoring  and \nprivatization of SOEs. The unbundled companies approved independent supervisory boards and \nnew company charters in line with the corporate governance guidelines of the Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development. ADB is leading the commercialization of distribution \nsubsector, and assisted JSC REN to prepare opening balance and financial statements compliant \nwith the IFRS and to adopt key performance indicators. The World Bank is supporting JSC NEGU \nand  the  EBRD  is  supporting  JSC  TPP.  These  measures  will  facilitate  the  improvement  of  the \nfinancial management system and corporate governance of unbundled companies. \n \nIn subprogram 2, the government plans to amend the Law on Electricity (2009) to approve \n22. \na  new  power  market  structure,  incorporate  the  sector  unbundling,  ensure  commercial  and \ncorporate principles governing the sector, promote the attraction of private investment, and create \nthe  conditions  for  full  deregulation  of  electricity  industry.  Subprogram  2  will  focus  on \ncommercializing the sector SOEs and improving financial management, including adopting the \nIFRS and strengthening corporate governance. The gender policy will be cascaded down to the \nsector SOEs to mainstream gender equality in the sector. \n \nReform area 2: Sector financial sustainability improved. The objective of this reform \n23. \nis to improve the sector\u2019s financial sustainability. The government transferred the responsibility \nfor  tariff  determination  from  the  MOF  to  the  autonomous  tariff  commission  under  the  COM  to \nstrengthen  the  independence  and  transparency  of  tariff  determination  (para.  9).  To  improve \ncollection rates and payment discipline, the government approved a time-bound action plan to roll \nout  the  smart  metering  system  throughout  the  country  (para.  10).  Based  on  the  promising \noutcome of the smart metering projects, the government abolished bill collection by the BCE. The \ngovernment  has  implemented  a  program  of measures to  attract  independent  power  producers \n(IPPs)  through  (i)  a  credit  enhancement  mechanism  to  mitigate  initial  off-taker  risks; \n(ii) establishing  procedures  for  the  public  procurement  of  IPPs  and  standardizing  bankable \ntransaction  structures,  and  (iii) nondiscriminatory  access  to the  national grid.  The  transmission \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fcompany, NEGU, is the single buyer of electricity from generators and executes power purchase \nagreements  with  generators.  Considering  the  nascent  domestic  capital  market  and  weak \ncreditworthiness of NEGU, the credit enhancement mechanism and government support program \nfor  IPPs  will  build  private  sector  confidence  in  Uzbekistan\u2019s  power  market.  Gender  equality \nprovisions were extended to private sector projects, with a 5% women employment target in line \nwith the sector gender policy, which will create job opportunities for women. \n \n24. \n Subprogram 2 will establish an independent energy regulator for the sector, with the key \nfunctions  of  tariff  determination,  licensing,  market  regulation,  and  consumer  protection.  The \nregulator\u2019s independence will preserve stability and continuity in rule setting and avoid political \ninterference  in  business  decisions  and  regulatory  risks.  Further  analytical  studies  will  be \nconducted through the AFD TA to reform the retail tariff mechanism to reduce cross-subsidies \nand protect the vulnerable in 2020\u20132021. Subprogram 2 will focus on implementing renewable \nenergy IPPs to reach at the financial close of 1,000 megawatts (MW) solar and 500 MW wind \nprojects. To allow NEGU to generate enough revenue to pay for the electricity it purchases, the \ngovernment will develop further measures to improve NEGU\u2019s financial viability and de-merge the \ntransmission system operations and the single buyer function. \n \n25. \nReform area 3: Power sector carbon intensity reduced. The objective of this reform is \nto reduce GHG emissions in the electricity supply chain. To this end, the government adopted a \nbroad program to transition to a green economy and decrease the carbon intensity of the economy \nby 10% of the 2010 level by 2030. Policy measures in subprogram 1 comprehensively covered \npower generation, transmission, and distribution. In power generation, the government approved \na national policy to (i) develop solar and wind energy sources to cover more than 15% of electricity \ngeneration  by  2030,  (ii)  retire  old  and  inefficient  5.9-gigawatt  thermal  power  plants,  and \n(iii) increase  regional  trade  with  hydro-rich  countries.  In  transmission  and  distribution,  policy \nactions  focused  on  reducing  losses  and  expanding  the  grid  system  to  accommodate  the \nincreasing renewable energy integration. Digitalization of transmission and distribution operations \nwill improve the efficiency and service quality. In distribution, the government approved programs \nto  green  the  distribution  networks  while  improving  service  quality  and  reducing  losses  to  9%: \nsmall-scale distributed renewables and a distribution modernization and loss reduction program. \n \nSubprogram 2 will adopt the revised Nationally Determined Contributions, with improved \n26. \nadaptation measures covering the power and gas industries and a climate-resilient hydropower \ndevelopment program for 2020\u20132030. It targets adopting a policy for enhancing climate change \nmanagement for hydropower and increasing regional trade with hydro-rich neighboring countries. \nFor  distribution,  ADB  will  assist  the  government  to  develop  further  regulatory  frameworks  and \ncommercial incentives, such as renewable energy auctions, which will facilitate the penetration of \ndistributed renewable energy for productive use. \n \nReform  area  4:  Demand-side  energy  efficiency  increased.  Energy  efficiency  and \n27. \nconservation are at the forefront of the government\u2019s energy policy. The objective of this reform \nis to manage the fast-growing electricity demand and defer investment in the power system by \nreducing  wasteful  electricity  consumption  in  the  industry,  residential  segment,  and  public \nbuildings. In subprogram 1, the government approved an energy efficiency road map, focusing \non  upgrading  regulatory  standards  to  international  level,  and  setting  energy-saving  targets  for \nenergy-intensive enterprises in the oil and gas, metallurgy, chemical, textile, and manufacturing \nindustries. The government also adopted a district heating efficiency improvement program for \n2019\u20132022,  focusing  on  Tashkent  City,  with  a  share  of  70%  of  the  country\u2019s  district  heating \nservices.  An  improved  district  heating  system  will  help  reduce  the  electricity  consumption  for \nspace heating in the winter. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fEnergy efficiency requires multisector engagement and broader coordination with different \n28. \nsectors  of  the  economy,  such  as  agriculture  and  industry,  and  with  local  government. \nSubprogram 2 will focus on the amendment to the Law on the Rational Use of Energy (1997) and \nthe introduction of an energy conservation data management system to trace energy consumption \nby sector. The adoption of a new energy-labeling system will be followed up on, as this requires \nbroader consultation with other ministries, industries, and consumers. \n \n29. \nChoice of programmatic approach. International experience indicates that the design \nof reforms can be sequenced as follows: (i) develop a policy that provides broad reform guidelines, \n(ii) enact  legislation  to  implement  the  policy,  (iii)  develop  a  transparent  regulatory  framework, \n(iv) unbundle the integrated structure and establish a market, and (v) divest state ownership in \ngeneration  and  distribution. 15  Consistent  with  international  good  practice,  the  reforms  are \nsequenced over two subprograms. Subprogram 1 will focus on the formulation of the sector policy \nand  guidelines,  and changing  institutional  and  human resources  structures.  Subprogram  2  will \nfocus  on  the  regulatory  and  legal  framework,  a  functioning  power  market  model,  and \nimplementation of the private investment projects. A programmatic approach is appropriate for \nchronologically  sequencing  the  reforms  in  a  multiyear  framework  and  allowing  time  to  yield \nresults. \n \n30. \nADB\u2019s value addition. ADB is uniquely positioned to advise the government on the power \nsector  reform  from  its  extensive  experience  in  designing  and  implementing  the  power  sector \nreforms  and  PBLs.  ADB  has  helped  the  government  identify  key  reform  actions  based  on \ninternational power sector reform practices. The program builds on ADB\u2019s strong presence in the \nsector  and  policy  dialogue  built  under  the  Economic  Management  Improvement  Program \n(footnote 10). The PBL, as the first of its kind in Uzbekistan\u2019s energy sector, is critical to support \ncomplex reforms and deepen private investment at a time of high uncertainty and risks. Strong \ncoordination  with  other  development  partners  provided  a  unified  reform  package  to  the \ngovernment. ADB will continue to provide support to implement complex reforms, with the help of \nongoing TA (footnote 13) and programmed TA such as a distributed solar promotion program and \na dedicated TA program for subprogram 2.  \n \n31. \nAlignment with Strategy 2030. The program is fully aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, \nparticularly the operational priorities on (i) accelerating progress in gender equality; (ii) tackling \nclimate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental \nsustainability;  and  (iii)  strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity.16 The  proportion  of \nsubprogram 1 attributable to climate mitigation and adaptation is estimated at $125 million, as the \nprogram supports policy and institutional actions for the clean energy transition.17 \n \n32. \nDevelopment  partner  coordination.  The  program  benefited  from  the  close  donor \ncoordination and harmonized TA support from ADB, the EBRD, and the World Bank (para. 18). \nThe program was jointly developed with AFD, and AFD helped reorient the policy direction toward \ndecarbonization  and  climate  co-benefits.  Following  subprogram  1,  AFD  intends  to  cofinance \nsubprogram  2.  Under  the  broader  programmatic  and  coordinated  approach,  the  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency is processing a development policy lending of $200 million for \n2020,  targeting  energy  efficiency  and  capacity  building,  which  complements  the  program.  The \nWorld Bank is considering an energy sector development policy operation in 2021 to build on this \nprogram  and  expand  the  reforms  to  the  hydrocarbon  segment.  ADB  consulted  with  the  IMF \nregarding this program (footnote 2), and ADB has maintained close coordination and consultation \n\n15 World Bank. 2020.

The \nprogram will have the following effect of the reform: environment conducive to private investment \nand sector sustainability improved.19 The reform measures will improve the sector sustainability \nthrough four channels: (i) rationalization of tariffs to the cost recovery level; (ii) improved revenue \ncollection rates; (iii) reduced losses in the transmission and distribution; and (iv) increased private \ninvestment, which will leave additional fiscal space for public investment in priority areas. \n \n34. \nThe potential economic gains from the program outputs are expected to lead to additional \nfiscal  space  estimated  at  $1.74  billion.  These  benefits  accrue  from  estimated  public  budget \nsavings from avoided equity investment in the power generation assets required by 2030 ($1.4 \nbillion),  and  an  additional  $344  million  of  avoided  revenue  support  for  the  sector  from  loss \nreduction. Additionally, scaled up renewable generation will help avoid the use of natural gas and \nreduce  GHG  emissions  and  the  associated  social  costs  of  carbon  dioxide  emissions.  The \neconomic  value  of  the  saved  natural  gas  is  estimated  at  $1.3  billion,  and  net  carbon  dioxide \nreductions valued at the social cost of carbon are estimated at $383 million for the next 10 years.20 \n \nD. \n \n35. \nCompared  with  the  pre-COVID-19  estimates  for  2020,  the  government  financing \nrequirements (overall fiscal deficit) are expected to increase from $1.86 billion (2.7% of GDP) to \n$3.26 billion (5.3% of GDP). Of that amount, $1 billion will be used for the Anti-Crisis Fund. The \ngovernment will increase its external borrowing from $1.7 billion to $2.6 billion in 2020, mainly \nfrom  international  financial  institutions  including  ADB\u2019s  COVID-19  Active  Response  and \nExpenditure  Support  Program  ($500  million),  the  proposed  program  ($200  million),  budget \nsupport programs of the World Bank ($795 million), the IMF ($375 million), and other development \npartners\u2019 loans (Table 1). The remainder will be borrowed through the domestic government bond \nmarket. \n \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\nTable 1: Financing Needs and Support for 2020  \n($ million) \n\n \n \nItem \nGross financing requirement \nGross domestic financing \nGross foreign financinga \n      ADB\u2019s COVID-19 response \n\nCARES Program \nCOVID-19 Emergency Response Project (EAL)b \n\n      ADB\u2019s originally programmed and new PBLs \n\nFinancial Markets Development Program (subprogram 1)c \n\n \n\nBefore \nCOVID-19 \n2020 \n1,855.5 \n156.2 \n1,699.3 \n \n\n \n \n250.0 \n100.0 \n\nAdjusted for \nCOVID-19 \n2020 \n3,258.2 \n672.2 \n2,586.0 \n600.0 \n500.0 \n100.0 \n200.0 \n \n\nChange \n(%) \n\n75.6 \n330.3 \n52.2 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n18 ADB.  2020.

The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period \nof 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year;  and  such  other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the straight-line method, the \naverage maturity is 9.25 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. AFD will provide \ncollaborative cofinancing for subprogram 1 through a loan of \u20ac150 million. \n \nDebt  sustainability  analysis.  ADB\u2019s  public  debt  sustainability  analysis  indicates \n37. \nsustainable public debt and a low risk of debt stress, even in the post-COVID-19 scenario. ADB\u2019s \nanalysis suggests that loans for COVID-19 and this program will increase the outstanding public \ndebt by 13.7% (6.1% from ADB and 7.6% from the IMF and the World Bank). The public debt\u2013\nGDP ratio (excluding public guarantees) is projected to increase from 23.3% in 2019 to 33.3% by \n2021 and to decline steadily to 31.2% by 2024, which will remain below the threshold of 70% for \nlow  debt  stress.  Debt  sustainability  will  not  be  impaired  because  the  public  debt  remains  low. \nLong-term and highly concessional loans total more than 70% of total debt and keep borrowing \ncosts low. Uzbekistan\u2019s foreign exchange reserves position is strong, with more than 50% held \nas gold. The external debt is projected to increase from 43.5% in 2019 to 47.6% in 2021, below \nthe threshold of 55%.21 \n \nE. \n \n38. \nThe MOF will be the executing agency of the program, responsible for overall program \nmonitoring and reporting. The MOE will be the implementing agency. Ongoing TA will continue to \nprovide  support  for  the  policy  actions  (footnote  13).  The  programmatic  approach  will  be \nimplemented from 1 July 2019 to 31 December 2022. Subprogram 1, implemented from 1 July \n2019  to  31  July  2020,  will  be  disbursed  in  a  single  tranche,  and  the  loan  closing  date  is  26 \nFebruary 2021. Subprogram 2 will be implemented from 1 August 2020 to 31 December 2022. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n21 The MOF pursues its debt policy in line with the IMF and World Bank recommended threshold of less than 70% for \n\nthe public debt\u2013GDP ratio and less than 55% for the external debt\u2013GDP ratio.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fThe  proceeds  of  the  PBL  will  be  withdrawn  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n39. \nGovernance. The government is fully committed to improving the quality of governance \nand mitigating governance risks by strengthening the rule of law and anticorruption measures.22 \nThe 2019 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability assessment showed that the overall \npublic financial management systems are good, with credible budget planning and execution.23 \nNo major fiduciary risks and/or mismanagement of public resources have been identified.24 ADB \nhas supported the implementation of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards based \non  a  road  map  developed  in  2019.  To  strengthen  risk  management  and  fraud  prevention,  the \nMOF adopted a risk-based internal audit manual in 2019; and several ministries and/or agencies \nhave strengthened their internal audit units. The Law on Public Procurement, adopted in 2018, is \nbeing  improved  in  line  with  international  good  practice.  ADB  has  been  supporting  corporate \ngovernance improvements based on a road map approved in 2019 and the implementation of the \nIFRS for the unbundled companies. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government. \n \n40. \nPoverty  and  social  considerations.  Although  Uzbekistan  has  a  100%  electrification \nratio,  power  supply  is  unreliable  and  interruptions  are  frequent.  The  program  will  improve  the \nquality  of  electricity  services  and  lower  losses.  Encouraging  private  sector  investment  in  the \nenergy sector will increase job opportunities directly and indirectly. Sufficient and stable electricity \nwill expand livelihood options and businesses, boost local economic development, and reduce \npoverty and inequity. As the average household spending is mainly on food products (47.3%) and \nutility services (20.4%), the utility service price increase would have an impact on households. \nThe poverty rate would rise by almost 2% point if the gas and electricity tariff is increased by 20%. \nThe  program  will  assess  the  affordability  of  the  potential  tariff  increase  and  develop  social \nprotection measures, such as targeted subsidies and/or a tariff structure to limit the impact on the \nvulnerable  groups  in consideration  of the  government\u2019s  pilot  program  for the  block tariff.25 The \nadoption of social protection measures will be carefully assessed before subprogram 2. \n \nGender. The program is categorized some gender elements. It has two key policy actions \n41. \nwith strong gender impacts: the MOE has adopted (i) a sector gender policy to promote gender \nequality in the power sector and (ii) gender equality targets for PPP projects. The MOE\u2019s gender \npolicy  features  (i)  a  gender  assessment  for  the  sector  utilities  to  set  baseline  for  monitoring; \n(ii) anti-sexual  harassment,  non-discrimination,  and  equal  opportunity  policies  for  the  sector; \n(iii) the introduction of a gender management system; (iv) the provision of professional, technical, \nand vocational training for women; and (v) a 5% women employment target for the power sector \nPPP  projects.  These  measures  will  lead  to  gender-sensitive  decisions  and  empower  women \nthrough new opportunities in the sector. \n\n \n\n22 Uzbekistan  improved  the  most  among  the  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States  in  the  \u201cabsence  of  corruption\u201d \nindicator  of  the  Rule  Law  Index 2020  (ranked  89th in 2020  and  95th  in  2019).

Fiscal risk \nmanagement, including contingent liabilities, is strengthened under the PFM Reform Strategy, 2018\u20132028. \n\n25 The government pilot tested a block tariff in the Yunusabad district of Tashkent City in 2019\u20132020 to assess the \n\nimpact of the block tariff. However, the pilot test is suspended due to COVID-19 impact.  \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards.  Following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  program  is \n42. \nclassified  category  C  for  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples. \nProgram activities will be confined to policy and institutional reforms. The prior policy actions have \nbeen assessed and are not expected to result in or lead to involuntary resettlement or negatively \naffect indigenous peoples or the environment. \n \n43. \nTable 2 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.26 \n \n\nRisk  mitigating  measures.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in \n\nTable 2. Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nProlonged coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic and global \neconomic slowdown impede private \nsector interest in the power sector. \n\nUnanticipated resistance by \nstakeholders impedes the \nimplementation. \n\nAdverse public opinion on the use of \nmore expensive energy-efficient \ntechnology and opposition from \nindustry. \nWeak capacity of Ministry of Energy \nand financial management of sector \nstate-owned enterprises delay \nreform implementation. \n\n  Source: Asian Development Bank. \n\nMitigation Measures \nThe government continues the international procurement of multiple power \nsector public\u2013private partnership projects without significant delays. \nContinued support by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \ndevelopment partners with a strong reputation and creditworthiness will \nhelp retain the interest of private investors. \nThe program is based on the government\u2019s policy and reform initiatives, \nand is backed by strong political will and commitment. Key development \npartners strongly support the program, and technical assistance (TA) has \nbeen provided to the government by development partners.  \nBroad public consultations with relevant stakeholders, including consumers \nand manufacturers, will continue. The incentive mechanism to offset the \ncost increase and effects of energy savings will be promoted through \npublic awareness campaigns. \nADB and development partners will undertake continuous engagement \nwith the government through regular consultations and monitoring to \nassess capacity development requirements. Support will be provided under \nthe TA. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n44. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement as  described  in  detail  in  the  loan \nagreement. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n45. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  programmatic  approach  and  policy-based  loan  would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve (i) the programmatic approach for the Power Sector Reform Program, and \n(ii) the loan of $200,000,000 to the Republic of Uzbekistan for subprogram 1 of the Power Sector \nReform  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  in  regular  terms,  with  interest  to  be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility;  for  a  term  of  15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n\n4 September 2020 \n\n \n\n26 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objective \n\nSustainable, inclusive, and market-led power sector development facilitateda \n  \n\nResults Chain \nEffect of the \nReform \n \nEnvironment \nconducive to \nprivate investment \nand sector \nsustainability \nimproved \n \n\nReform Areas \nunder \nSubprogram 1  \n \n1.
