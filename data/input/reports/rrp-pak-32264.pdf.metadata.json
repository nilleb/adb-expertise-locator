An  environmental  assessment  of  the  policy  matrix  was \nundertaken and is available as Supplementary Appendix I. \n \nPakistan  experienced  good  economic  growth  in  the  1980s  but  generally \nperformed  poorly  in  the  1990s  when  poverty  was  exacerbated.  Recently, \neconomic  performance  has  improved;  however,  Pakistan  remains  a  poor \ncountry with extremely low social indicators. Punjab is the largest province \nof Pakistan with an estimated population of 83 million or 56% of the total \npopulation. The incidence of poverty in the province was around 34.1% in \n2001/02,  much  higher  than  28.2%  estimated  in  1993/94.  The  urban-rural \ngap is significant: poverty has increased more rapidly in rural areas, from \n31.9%  in  1993/94  to  about  37.0%  in  2001/02.  Inequitable  provision  of \nsocial  services,  as  reflected  by  the  upper-income  groups  commanding \ngreater  access  than  households  with  lower  incomes,  has  led  to  an \nincrease  in  poverty  of  opportunity.  As  a  result,  Punjab\u2019s  social  indicators \nfall  far  short  of  its  economic  development,  as  reflected  by  low  literacy \nrates; high infant, child, and maternal mortality rates; high susceptibility to \ncommunicable diseases; very low proportion of deliveries by trained birth \nattendants; high disparity among income and gender groups in access to \nsocial  services;  and  inadequate  conditions  of  sanitation  and  solid  waste \nmanagement. A key reason in the inability to reduce poverty and improve \nthe social indicators in the country in general, including Punjab, has been \nthe poor performance of the overly centralized and inefficient bureaucracy. \nLocal-level government agencies have been incapable of delivering basic \nsocial services for a variety of reasons, including lack of proper incentives, \nunderstaffing, corruption, inadequate capacity, and lack of participation by \nthe beneficiaries.  \n \n\n\fto \n\nfiscal  and \n\nimprove  governance;  reform \n\nResponding  to  the  chronic  failure  to  deliver  the  basic  social  services \nneeded to reduce poverty, the Government of Pakistan (the Government) \ninitiated  a  sweeping  and  complex  reform  program  in  2001  designed  to \ndevolve  the  authority  and  responsibility  for  social  services  to  the  local \nlevel.  Under  the  Local  Government  Ordinance  of  2001,  the  provincial \ngovernments  have  transferred  primary  responsibility  of  major  social \nservice  delivery  functions,  including  education,  health,  and  WSS,  to  local \ngovernment  institutions.  This  change  has  resulted  in  redefinition  of  roles \nand responsibilities at the provincial and local government levels, including \nplanning, financing, execution of services, and monitoring. \n \nOverall, the Government of Punjab (PG) is short of resources in relation to \nits  large  socioeconomic  needs.  At  the  moment,  the  fiscal  structure  in \nPakistan is heavily skewed in favor of the Government, with provinces and \nlocal  governments  both  heavily  reliant  on  fiscal  transfers  from  the \nGovernment.  In  response,  the  Government  has  prepared  a  Poverty \nReduction  Strategy  Paper  (PRSP)  with  the  provinces  having  developed \nsimilar  province-level  PRSPs,  which  set  out  a  comprehensive  policy \nreform  agenda  to  break  the  vicious  cycle  of  poverty.  Punjab\u2019s  PRSP  (P-\nPRSP)  aims \nfinancial \nmanagement;  create  a  supportive  environment  for  private  sector-led \ngrowth;  improve  the  delivery  of  public  services,  especially  basic  social \nservices; and address vulnerabilities. PG is refocusing its expenditures on \npro-poor  sectors.  PG  has  started  preparing  a  medium-term  budgetary \nframework  to  prioritize  its  expenditures  since  fiscal  year  (FY)  2003/04, \nwhich  needs  to  be  strengthened  and  expanded  to  cover  all  sectors.  PG \nremains  committed  to  continuing  the  ongoing  financial  and  governance \nreforms and this commitment has been expressed at the highest possible \nlevels. \n \nThe  overall  goal  of  PDSSP  is  to  achieve  progress  on  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) related to poverty, gender, education, health, \nand WSS. PDSSP\u2019s objective is to strengthen devolved social services for \na  more  equitable,  efficient,  effective,  and  sustainable  delivery  of  social \nservices  in  line  with  the  Punjab  Local  Government  Ordinance  2001 \n(PLGO). In order to achieve the goal and objective, it will be necessary to \nsupport  reforms  and  capacity  building  to  help  (i) expand  coverage  of \nhealth  services  (especially  for  women  and  children),  increase  school \nenrollment  rates,  and  improve  access  to  WSS  facilities;  (ii) move  away \nfrom provincially-driven to demand-driven programs that are identified and \nimplemented  by  LGs  in  line  with  P-PRSP,  medium-term  budgetary \nframework,  and  provincial  strategic  plans  and  guidelines  to  achieve \nMDGs;  and  (iii)  enhance  the  capacity  of  LGs  to  assume  new  roles  and \nresponsibilities in social services as envisaged under the PLGO, including \nparticipatory planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. \n \n \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nObjectives and \nScope \n\n\f \n\n \n\nv\n\nrelations \n\nPDSSP  is  built  around  three  principal  policy  outcomes:  (i) realigning \nintergovernment \nto  support  devolved  social  services; \n(ii) rationalizing  and  setting  minimum  standards  for  social  services;  and \n(iii) strengthening  the  public  accountability  mechanisms  and  promoting \npublic-private partnership. \n \nPDSSP  is  designed  to  support  the  devolution  of  social  services  for  3 \nyears,  covering  all  34  district  governments  (DGs)  and  up  to  44  program \ntehsil  (town)  municipal  administrations  (TMAs),  except  for  those  TMAs \nfunded  by  the  Water  and  Sanitation  Authority  and  those  receiving  any \nsupport from two ongoing projects funded by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB). The TA component for strengthening the devolution of social sector \nservices will be for a period of 4 years. \n \nPG proposes three areas of policy actions focusing on strengthening LGs \nto  deliver  improved  social  services.  First,  the  provincial  line  departments \n(PLDs)  through  a  consultative  process  will  formulate  and  disseminate \nprioritized  strategic  plans  for  5  years,  which  will  then  guide  DGs  and \nprogram TMAs to develop and finalize 3-year prioritized rolling plans. LGs \nand  PLDs  will  jointly  delineate  roles  and  responsibilities  of  PG  and  LGs. \nAdditional  funds  will  be  provided  to  participating  LGs  in  the  form  of \nconditional grants to strengthen devolved social services. \n \nSecond,  PG,  in  consultation  with  LGs,  will  set  pro-poor  and  gender-\nsensitive  minimum  service  delivery  standards  to  target  the  poor  and \nvulnerable  population.  This  will  cover  introducing  measures  to  rationalize \nthe  staff  mix  and  skills  mix,  fill  up  all  essential  vacancies,  improve \nmanagement of service delivery, and enhance gender parity. \n \nThird,  PG  and  LGs  will  strengthen  accountability  mechanisms  through \nquality  assurance  functions,  objective  monitoring  through  strengthened \ncommittees,  citizen  participation  and  information  systems,  and  third  party \nevaluation. PG also proposes to promote public-private partnership (PPP) \nby  developing  a  policy  that  covers  mechanisms  to  establish  and \nstrengthen  PPP;  regulation  and  self-regulation  through  a  consultative \nprocess; \nnongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs),  community-based  organizations  (CBOs),  and \ncommunity citizen boards to improve service delivery. \n \nThe  costs  associated  with  policy  and  institutional  reforms  addressed  by \nthe  program  loans  and  grant  are  estimated  to  be  at  least  $200 million \nequivalent. \n \n\npartnerships  with \n\nstrengthening \n\nand \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fthrough \n\nthe  Department \n\nthe  United  Kingdom, \n\nfinancial  assistance  of  $180 million  equivalent, \nPG  has  requested \ncomprising  two  program  loans  of  $75 million  equivalent  from  the  Special \nFund  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund \n[ADF])  and  $75 million \nequivalent  from  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR),  and  a  grant  from  the \nfor \nGovernment  of \nInternational  Development  (DFID)  of  $30 million  equivalent,  to  provide \nbudgetary support to PG.  \n \nThe ADF loan will have a maturity of 24 years, including a grace period of \n8  years;  interest  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5% \nthereafter;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft \nLoan and Program Agreements. \n \nThe OCR loan will have a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 \nyears;  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered \nincluding  a \ncommitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as set forth in the draft Loan and Program Agreements. \n \nThe Government has agreed to relend the proceeds of the loans to PG in \ndomestic currency, on the same terms and conditions, as are applicable to \nthe Borrower. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by PG. \n \nThe  program  period  will  be  from  31  March  2005  to  31  March  2008.  The \nfirst, second, and third tranches, equivalent to $80 million, $55 million and \n$45 million, will be made available upon compliance with tranche release \nconditions following loan effectiveness. \n \nPlanning and Development Department (P&DD), Punjab  \n\n(LIBOR)-based \n\nlending \n\nfacility, \n\nrate \n\n \nA  steering  committee  representing  relevant  provincial  line  departments, \nlocal  governments,  and  civil  society  will  be  established  at  the  P&DD  to \nprovide  overall  policy  guidance \nthe  Program.

The program support unit (PSU) and \n34  local  support  groups  financed  under  the  TA  will  assist  with  planning, \ncoordinating, and monitoring the policy reform and development activities. \n \n\nto  coordinate \n\nvi \n\n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \nProgram Loan \nAmounts and \nTerms \n\n \nProgram Period \nand Tranching  \n\n \nExecuting \nAgency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fvii\n\nThe loan proceeds will finance the foreign exchange costs (excluding local \ntaxes  and  duties)  of  eligible  items  produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB\u2019s \nmember countries. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the proceeds \nof the loans and verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification. PG will \nuse  counterpart  funds  in  accordance  with  arrangements  satisfactory  to \nADB,  to  support  the  development  and  reform  of  devolved  social  services \nin  Punjab  and  incremental  costs  associated  with  the  Program,  including \nincreased  costs  of  devolved  administration  and  rehabilitation  of  social \nservices,  and  up-front  financing  of LGs  and  CBOs.  The  Government  and \nPG will certify the utilization of counterpart funds in line with the Loan and \nProgram Agreements through audited statements acceptable to ADB. \n \nPG  has  also  requested  a  TA  to  (i) strengthen  sector  and  program \nmanagement and monitoring, (ii) build capacity of LGs and CBOs in social \nsector governance and development, and (iii) support policy reforms. \n \nto  cost  $25.0 million  equivalent,  comprising \nThe  TA \n$3.2 million in foreign exchange costs and $21.8 million equivalent in local \ncurrency costs. The Government of the United Kingdom through DFID will \nfinance the equivalent of $20.0 million, and PG will finance the equivalent \nof $5.0 million of the TA cost. \n \nFrom 31 March 2005 to 31 March 2009. \n \n \nPlanning and Development Department (P&DD), Punjab  \n\nis  estimated \n\n \nThe TA will also be guided by the steering committee established for the \nProgram,  and  will  primarily  support  program  implementation,  capacity \nbuilding,  and  reforms  through  the  PSU  with  representation  of  four \nprovincial line departments and 34 local support groups at the LG level.  \n \nAll procurement under the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement. Contract packages valued at $500,000 equivalent or less \nwill  follow  international  shopping  procedures,  except  for  vehicles,  which \nmay be procured through local competitive bidding (LCB). Minor packages \ncosting  $100,000  equivalent  or  less  may  be  procured  through  LCB  or \ndirect purchase. \n \nA  management  firm  will  be  recruited  competitively  following  quality  and \ncost-based  selection  procedures  to  deliver  the  TA  on  a  needs  basis  and \nonly some consultants for the PSU will be recruited individually according \nto  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  TA \nwill provide a total of 50 person-months of international and 4,978 person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consulting  services  Consultants  include  experts  on \nfinance  and  governance,  poverty  and  gender,  capacity  building  and \ntraining, community organization, contracting and personnel management, \nengineering,  environment,  economics,  sector  reform,  and  monitoring  and \nevaluation.  \n\n \n\nProcurement, \nDisbursement, \nand Counterpart \nFunds \n\n \nThe Technical \nAssistance \n\n \nCost Estimates \nand Financing \nPlan \n\n \nPeriod of \nUtilization \n \nExecuting \nAgency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \nunder the TA \n\n \nConsulting \nServices under \nthe TA \n\n \n\n\ffaces \n\nfour  potential \n\n \nThe  main  beneficiaries  of  PDSSP  will  be  the  rural  and  urban  poor, \nparticularly women and girls. Special attention will be given to vulnerable \ngroups. \n \nPDSSP \nrisks:  political,  governance,  capacity \nconstraints,  and  macroeconomic  and  external.  First,  while  many  reforms \nran  into  difficulty  and  were  either  delayed  considerably  or  not  fully \nimplemented  due  to  political  pressures,  changes  in  Government,  or  stiff \nopposition  to  reforms,  the  risk  is  much  less  in  Punjab  than  in  other \nprovinces  because  of  a  more  stable  political  environment  and  strong \nbureaucracy.  This  is  demonstrated  by  smooth  implementation  of  the \nPunjab  Resource  Management  Program  and  Punjab  Education  Sector \nReform  Program.  PDSSP  has  an  attached  TA  component  to  ensure \nownership and to keep reforms on track through stakeholder participation \nand within the PLGO framework. \n \nSecond, PDSSP\u2019s emphasis on transparent and objective decision making \nto  minimize  rent-seeking  might  be  delayed  or  undermined  by  vested \ninterests.  PDSSP  builds  on  stakeholder  ownership  during  the  program \nimplementation  stages;  establishes  program  oversight \ndesign  and \nmechanisms  including  participation  of  local  council  committees;  and \nensures  synergy  with  other  programs  such  as  the  Punjab  Resource \nManagement  Program,  Decentralization  Support  Program,  and  Punjab \nEducation Sector Reform Program. \n \nThird, while devolution moves social sector planning, implementation, and \nmonitoring  closer  to  beneficiaries,  it  also  requires  additional  commitment \nand improved capacity at the local service delivery level. PDSSP includes \na  substantial  TA  package  to  support  capacity  building  and  institutional \nstrengthening at the local level, including through the use of management \ncontracts. \n \nFourth,  PG  has  been  facing  serious  budget  deficits  in  the  past  with  a \nhistory  of  poor  revenue  collection,  which  resulted  in  serious  budget  cuts \nfor  the  social  sectors  during  the  1990s.  PG  has  committed  additional \nthe  P-PRSP  and  medium-term \nresources \nbudgetary framework to substantially enhance social sector allocations \n \n\nits  projections  under \n\nin \n\nviii\n\n \n\n \nProgram Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on: (i) two proposed \nprogram loans, (ii) proposed administration of a grant for budgetary support by the Government \nof  the  United  Kingdom,  through  the  Department  for  International  Development,  and  (iii) \nproposed  administration  of  technical  assistance  by  the  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom, \nthrough  the  Department  for  International  Development,  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for \nthe Punjab Devolved Social Services Program. \n \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\n \nThe Government of Pakistan (the Government) has been pursuing an ambitious reform \n2. \nagenda  over  the  last  4  years  aimed  at  putting  the  economy  on  a  stronger  and  more  stable \nfooting. With the rescheduling of external debt and a more proactive debt management strategy \nin place, record levels of exports, lower interest rates, a buoyant stock market, and a continued \npolicy of privatization, gross domestic product (GDP) growth has been increasing, estimated at \nabout 6.4% in fiscal year (FY) 2004, and projected to rise to 6.6% in FY2005. The high growth \nhas  been  accompanied  by  relatively  stable  prices,  lower  debt  service  payments,  manageable \nfiscal deficits, an external account surplus, and unprecedented high levels of foreign exchange \nreserves.  Several  factors  are  cited  for  this  economic  recovery,  including  economic  and \ngovernance  reforms,  stabilization  policy  of  the  Government  in  the  past  few  years,  global \ndevelopments  after  September  11,  2001,  and  positive  developments  on  the  political  and \nregional  fronts.  However,  despite  these  positive  developments,  investment  activity  has  been \nsluggish due to excess capacities and cautious behavior of investors. With recent improvements \nin  regional,  political,  and  business  environments,  officials  are  now  optimistic  that  investments \nwill  increase.  Barring  any  major  policy  reversal  and  political  and  international  upheavals, \nPakistan\u2019s economy is poised for high economic growth in the coming years.1 \n  \n3. \n In spite of the relatively optimistic economic prospects, Pakistan remains a poor country \nwith very low social indicators that are among the worst in the region. The Government is aware \nthat  poverty,  illiteracy,  and  ill  health  among  its  population  are  a  major  hindrance  to  economic \nprogress  and  a  source  of  social  instability.  Accordingly,  the  Government  has  undertaken  a \nsweeping and complex reform program designed to devolve authority and responsibility to the \nlocal level and prepared a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).  \n \n The  devolution  provides  a  framework  for  three  major  reforms,  namely  political, \n4. \nadministrative,  and  fiscal.  By  political  reforms,  the  Government  created  a  third  tier  of  local \ngovernment (LG) at the district level and below through local-level elected representatives. The \nadministrative  and  management  powers  were  decentralized  including  human  resource \nmanagement for 12 important sectors including social services and infrastructure. The political \nand  administrative  decentralization  was  backed  by  fiscal  reforms  in  the  shape  of  provision  of \nblock grants to the LGs, and authority to raise revenue through levy of local taxes. \n \nPrepared after extensive consultations with all stakeholders, the PRSP revolves around \n5. \nfour  basic  strategies:  (i) achieving  high  and  broad-based  economic  growth,  (ii) improving \ngovernance and consolidating devolution, (iii) developing human capital and efficient delivery of \n\n                                                        \n1  Pakistan  would  need  to  invest  $1.5 billion  to  $2  billion  additional  resources  to  achieve  a  medium-term  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth rate of 8% per annum, according to a joint press conference of the ADB and the \nGovernment at the time of the 2004 Pakistan Development Forum. 17\u201319 March 2004. \n\n\f2\n\n \n\nsocial services, and (iv) reducing inequalities and bringing the poor, vulnerable, and backward \nregions into the mainstream of development. The PRSP emphasizes that poverty reflects social, \npolitical,  and  economic  exclusion  and  prescribes  greater  social  inclusion  through  human \ndevelopment  and  devolution.  Provincial  governments,  too,  have  developed  similar  province-\nlevel  PRSPs,  including  the  province  of  Punjab,  which  set  out  a  comprehensive  policy  reform \nagenda to break the vicious cycle of poverty. \n \n6. \nAlthough  the  PRSP  provides  a  solid  conceptual  framework  for  accelerating  economic \ngrowth and reducing poverty, its implementation is predicated on a stable political and economic \nenvironment.  The  Government  is  committed  to  continue  ongoing  financial  and  governance \nreforms and this commitment has been expressed at the highest levels. Recent agreements on \nthe political front and moves to improve relations with India are encouraging.  \n \n \n\nIII.  THE SECTOR  \n\nSector Description and Performance  \n\n \nA. \n \n7. \nPunjab  is  the  largest  province  of  Pakistan  with  an  estimated  population  of  about \n83 million  or  56%  of  the  total  population  of  Pakistan.  Given  the  size  of  the  population  in  the \nprovince, the quality of the delivery of social services by the Government of Punjab (PG) affects \nover  half  of  the  country's  population.  To  reverse  the  trend  and  sharpen  the  focus  on  poverty \nreduction  at  the  provincial  level,  a  Punjab  PRSP  (P-PRSP)  was  developed  in  2003  in  the \ncontext of the national PRSP.  \n \n8. \nPunjab  PRSP.  P-PRSP  aims  to  improve  governance,  reform  fiscal  and  financial \nmanagement,  create  a  supportive  environment  for  private-sector  led  growth,  improve  the \ndelivery  of  public  services  (especially  basic  social  services),  and  address  vulnerabilities. \nGovernance  improvements  include  civil  service  reforms  and  strengthening  devolution  and \nplanning  processes  to  improve  efficiency,  accountability,  and  service  orientation.  Planning \nimprovements  include  delineating  responsibilities  between  the  PG  and  LGs  for  policy  making, \nimplementation,  and  monitoring;  strengthening  provincial  and  LG  capacities;  and  preparing \nmedium-term strategies under the medium-term budgetary framework (MTBF), which needs to \nbe  strengthened.  As  the  largest  province,  the  successful  implementation  and  sustainability  of \nthe P-PRSP and its pro-poor expenditures on devolved social services are crucial for Pakistan \nto  move  toward  overall  reduction  in  poverty  and  achieving  the  Millennium  Development  Goals \n(MDGs). PG has requested long-term support from ADB for its devolved social services.2 The \nprogram framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\n1. \n\nPoverty and Social Indicators in Punjab  \n\n \n9. \nPer  capita  income  and  poverty  characteristics  in  Punjab  mirror  overall  country \ncharacteristics,  with  marginally  better  figures.  The  incidence  of  poverty  in  the  province  was \naround 34.1% in 2001/02, much higher than the 28.2% estimated in 1993/94. The urban-rural \ngap is significant. Poverty increased more rapidly in rural areas, rising from 31.9% in 1993/94 to \nabout 37.0% in 2001/02 while urban poverty increased from 18.4% to 27.0% in during the same \nperiod.3  Poverty  is  more  widespread  in  southern  Punjab,  where  the  level  of  economic \ndevelopment and income are generally lower than in northern Punjab. Seven of the province\u2019s \n\n                                                        \n2  ADB. 2004. Pakistan: Country Strategy and Program Update (2005\u20132006).

Washington, D.C.: World Bank. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n10  most  deprived  districts  are  in  southern  Punjab.4  Poverty  in  southern  Punjab  is  largely \nassociated  with  low  social  development,  feudal  agriculture,  droughts,  and  water  shortage.5 \nHowever, the recent rise in poverty has been smaller than before in other provinces, and there \nhas been substantial decline in inequality in recent years.5 \n \n10. \nProvision of social services follows the national trend of inequity across income groups \nand  gender.  Inequity  is  also  marked  by  wider  gaps  in  various  access  related  social  indicators \nbetween the rich and the poor in rural areas than in urban areas. Education opportunities at the \nprimary,  middle,  and  secondary  levels  are  limited  for  poor  rural  children  and  females.  The \ndropout  rate  of  children  from  low-income  households  is  triple  those  from  higher  income \nhouseholds.6 Girls face the additional burden of gender discrimination. About 2.0 million children \naged 5 to 9 and 6.4 million children aged 10 to 14 were out of school in 2003.  \n \n11. \nThe availability of piped water in rural households among the lowest income quintile is \nonly  about  a  third  of  the  highest  quintile\u2019s.  Child  mortality  is  very  high\u2014nearly  11%  of  the \nchildren do not live to their fifth birthday partly because of limited access to adequate childhood \nhealth  care  services.  Childhood  immunization  levels  are  around  60%.  Every  year,  about \n200,000 women run into complications of pregnancy; the maternal mortality ratio is high at 500 \ndeaths  per  100,000  live  births  because  of  lack  of  access  to  obstetric  emergency  care.  In \naddition,  only  40%  of  pregnant  women  have  at  least  one  antenatal  checkup.  Although  the \naverage  age  at  marriage  (22.5  years)7  and  the  contraceptive  prevalence  rate  (30%)  have \nincreased over time, the population growth rate is 2.1% per annum and the total fertility rate is \nstill  one  of  the  highest  in  the  region  at  4.66.  Malnutrition  is  a  major  contributor  to  infant  and \nmaternal death. Currently, there are about 4 million malnourished children in Punjab, and about \na  third  of  all  pregnant  women  have  iron  deficiency  anemia.8  The  situation  among  the  poor  is \ngrim. Mortality rates are 69% higher in the poorest quintile than the richest quintile; the rate of \nunderweight children in the poorest quintiles is double that of the richest quintiles.  \n \nThe population residing in large urban areas, especially in industrial towns, is better off \n12. \nin  terms  of  quality  of  life  than  those  living  in  medium  and  small  villages,  especially  in  remote \npopulation clusters. The private health and education sectors are well established in cities from \nprimary to tertiary levels, and competitive market mechanisms that are gradually evolving have \nserved  to  monitor  the  cost  of  services.  The  not-for-profit  sector,  e.g.,  foundations  and \nphilanthropic  organizations,  is  also  active  in  some  urban  areas  in  serving  the  poor.  Unlike  in \ncities and towns, the private sector involvement in social service delivery is limited in the rural \nareas  and  is  dependent  on  commitment  and  leadership  of  a  few  individuals.  Some  parts  of \nPunjab,  especially  rural  areas  of  southern  Punjab,  are  controlled  by  the  feudal  system.  As  a \nresult, incidence of poverty remains high, which has led to many poverty-related interventions in \nthese  areas.  The  rural  population  historically  lacks  the  confidence  and  skills  to  take  control  of \npublicly financed social services.  \n \n13.  Women\u2019s situations are characterized by discrimination at the social, cultural, legal, and \npolitical  levels.  Although  the  Constitution  of  Pakistan  provides  guarantees  against  any \n                                                        \n4  The  Social  Policy  Development  Center,  Karachi  developed  a  district  profile  of  concentration  of  poverty  for  each \nprovince  in  2001,  using  four  indicators  namely  employment,  education,  housing,  and  housing  services  (which \nincludes water supply and sanitation). \n\n5  World Bank, ADB, DFID.

Devolution has addressed gender issues to a \nconsiderable extent, including the reservation of one third of seats at all levels of parliaments for \nwomen. Major gender reforms are planned under the gender reform action plan (GRAP) already \napproved by PG. \n \n2. \n\nDevolution to Local Governments  \n\n \n14. \nUnder  the  centralized  system,  social  sectors  were  poorly  planned,  administered,  and \nmonitored;  hence,  improvement  in  social  indicators  was  slower  than  planned.  Planning  was  a \ntop-down  approach  with  hardly  any  involvement  of  citizens  or  communities  in  planning, \nimplementing,  or  monitoring  social  services.  The  public  sector  had  assumed  the  role  of \npurchaser as well as provider of services with very little partnership with the not-for-profit or for-\nprofit  private  sector.  Centralized  planning  and  management  created  a  number  of \nshortcomings\u2014inappropriate  location  of  facilities,  staff  absenteeism,  short-working  hours,  low \nquality  of  services,  and  lack  of  consumer  satisfaction\u2014leading  to  low  productivity  and  higher \nunit  costs.  The  low  level  of  funding  for  social  sectors  in  the  late  1990s,  especially  for  the \nnonsalary budget, led to further deterioration in the quality of social services. \n \nOn 14 August 2001, the LG system replaced the old system of provincial administrations \n15. \nat  the  division,  district,  and  tehsil  levels.  The  new  system,  regulated  under  the  Punjab  Local \nGovernment  Ordinance  2001  (PLGO),  provides  for  much  more  autonomous  LGs  in  districts, \ntehsil  municipal  administrations  (TMAs),  in  towns  and  union  administrations  (UAs)  in  villages. \nThe intent is to devolve political power and decentralize administrative and financial authority to \naccountable LGs for improved governance, effective delivery of social services, and transparent \ndecision making through institutionalized participation of the people at the grassroots level. The \nnew  system  is  designed  to  bring  decision  making  closer  to  beneficiaries  of  public  services; \nensure citizens\u2019 involvement and oversight in planning and implementation; and give a greater \nvoice  to  women,  peasants,  laborers,  and  marginalized  population  groups.  Devolution  of \nadministrative  and  financial  powers,  followed  by  the  appropriate  empowerment,  staffing,  and \nresource  allocation  to  LGs,  is  expected  to  deliver  better  public  services  like  health,  education, \nand  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS).  PG,  to  date,  has  issued  more  than  60  administrative \norders and 16 consequential pieces of legislation for transfer of powers to LGs under the PLGO. \n \n16. \nDevolution  is,  however,  in  a  transition  phase  and  transfer  of  powers  is  still  continuing. \nThe PG and LGs are clarifying their roles and responsibilities and devising mechanisms to build \ncapacity  at  various  levels.  There  is  a  challenge  in  meeting  citizens\u2019  expectations  on  the  one \nhand and filling large capacity gaps on the other. With a paradigm shift in the power structure, \nthere  are  tensions  both  between  the  provincial-  and  local  government-elected  representatives \nand within LG tiers, which need to be carefully addressed through appropriate management of \nintergovernment relations. The capacity of LGs to undertake their new roles and responsibilities \nhas to be strengthened. A number of initiatives are under way to improve the capacity of LGs \nunder  the  Decentralization  Support  Program  (DSP),  Punjab  Resource  Management  Program \n(PRMP),  and  PG's  own  inputs.  While  these  efforts  are  in  the  right  direction,  they  need  to  be \nsustained in the medium term, particularly to help reduce the tensions between provincial and \nlocal offices. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\n3. \n\nSocial Sector Financing \n\n \n17. \nOverall,  the  PG  lacks  sufficient  resources  to  meet  its  large  socioeconomic  needs  as \nreflected  in  its  MTBF.  Under  the  P-PRSP,  PG  has  committed  to  increase  the  pro-poor  social \nexpenditures  by  another  40%  by  FY2006,  when  these  sectors  would  account  for  42%  of  the \nconsolidated budget of the province. At present, provincial expenditures on all development and \nnondevelopment activities, including LG expenditures, are about 6.5% of provincial GDP. This \namounts to less than $30 per capita for running the government, servicing debt, supporting LGs, \nmaintaining infrastructure, and financing social services. Provinces, including Punjab, and LGs \nare heavily reliant on fiscal transfers from the Government. PG derives 80% of its revenues from \nfederal transfers and 20% from its own revenues; both these revenue sources grew by 13\u201315% \nper annum in the last 5 years. However, the trend in revenue increase is not sufficient to finance \nPunjab\u2019s  increased  expenditure  obligations  under  the  P-PRSP  and  the  cost  of  implementing \ndevolution.  \n \n18. \nIn the social sectors, PG has undertaken various initiatives to improve their performance. \nThere is substantial increase in social sector allocations. Expenditures on education, health, and \nWSS  services  collectively  made  up  about  32%  of  total  provincial  spending  during  FY2000/01 \nthrough  FY2003/04.  These  expenditures  grew  roughly \nline  with  overall  provincial \nexpenditures  during  this  period  (8.6%  per  annum).  Growth  rates,  however,  varied  between \nsectors\u2014education  at  12.1%  per  annum,  health  at  7.7%  per  annum,  and  WSS  at  8.6%  per \nannum.  Allocations  to  the  three  sectors  increased  substantially  in  FY2004/05  in  line  with  P-\nPRSP\u2014education at 27.2%, health at 40.8%, and WSS at 123.9%,9 with an overall increase of \n31.6%.  Overall,  the  share  of  these  social  sectors  in  the  provincial  budget  rose  to  35.8%.  The \n2004/05 budget provided a generous increase for the nonsalary budget. \n \n19. \nPG  negotiated  the  PRMP  with  ADB  in  September  2003  to  strengthen  its  finances, \nrealign  governance  institutions  for  pro-poor  service  delivery,  and  increase  opportunities  for \nincome  and  growth  in  the  private  sector.  It  proposes  to  create  fiscal  space  by  developing  a \nbroad-based tax structure, rationalizing expenditure and management functions, and providing \nfor labor market interventions to support the private sector. The proposed levels of funding for \nsocial  sectors,  over  one  third  of  the  total  expenditures,  appear  sustainable  if  the  PRMP  is \nimplemented as planned, debt service is reduced, and inflows from other planned development \npartner-assisted  programs  and  projects  are  timely.  It  is  also  expected  that  there  will  be  an \nincrease  in  the  provincial  share  of  federal  transfers  under  the  new  National  Finance \nCommission  award.  PG\u2019s  commitment  to  enhance  social  sector  allocations,  improve  social \nindicators,  and  reduce  poverty  of  opportunity  is  supported  by  assistance  that  includes  the \nPunjab Education Sector Reform Program (PESRP) supported by the World Bank, and the two \nhealth and two WSS projects supported by ADB.10  \n \n\nin \n\n                                                        \n9  The  extraordinary  increase  for  WSS  is  due  to  the  dip  in  expenditures  on  WSS  sector  in  FY2003/04  because  of \n\nconfusion of roles and responsibilities by level. \n\n10  ADB.  2003.

The urban-based facilities often work beyond \ntheir  capacity  because  of  better  quality  services,  large  and  rising  population  to  serve,  higher \nliteracy rates and awareness of consumers, and better communication links. While urban areas \noffer  a  different  set  of  challenges  and  provide  options  for  service  delivery,  rural  facilities  are \nscattered,  poorly  staffed,  and  underutilized.  Rural  facilities  have  inadequate  nonsalary \noperational  budgets,  many  unfilled  vacancies  (particularly  in  disadvantaged  locations),  low \nquality  of  services  because  of  poor  management  and  weak  monitoring  arrangements,  limited \naccess for women, limited user and community involvement, and poor public accountability.  \n \nHowever,  the  transition  process  under  the  devolved  setup  is  under  way.  Water  user \n21. \ncommittees (WUCs) are now taking charge of WSS schemes and school councils (SCs) have \nbecome  active  in  several  districts  to  improve  management  and  quality  of  education.  Other \ninitiatives  are  either  planned  or  under  way,  including  formation  of  community  citizen  boards \n(CCBs)  as  development  partners,  evening  classes  by  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs) \nusing public sector schools, contracting-in management of basic health units in one district, and \nimproved  procedures  for  appointments  and  postings  and  transfers,  etc.  PG  and  LGs  have \nalready initiated several programs to move toward universal schooling of children: expansion of \nteacher training, consolidation of schools up to middle level, running evening classes in existing \nschools,  providing  incentives  to  the  private  sector  through  restructured  Education  Foundation, \ngranting waiver of tuition fees up to secondary level, providing stipends for girls in classes 6\u20138 \nin  the  15  districts  with  the  lowest  literacy  rates,  and  recruiting  teachers  to  fill  vacancies.  The \nsector analyses are summarized below while further details appear in Appendix 2. \n \n\n5. \n\nEducation \n\n \nThe national Education Sector Reform 2001\u20132005 (ESR), anchored on the Education for \n22. \nAll  Goal  by  2015,  seeks  to  implement  key  strategies  to  improve  the  gender  balance  and  the \nquality of and access to education through a more realistic estimation of resources to meet the \ngaps. ESR aims to increase (i) literacy rate from 49% to 60%, (ii) gross primary enrollment rate \nfrom  83%  to  100%,  (iii) gross  middle  school  enrollment  from  48%  to  55%,  and  (iv) secondary \nschool enrollment from 30% to 40%, all by 2005.  \n \n23.  While  PG  has  aligned  its  future  plans  in  line  with  ESR  in  its  own  PESRP,  successful \nimplementation requires a highly concerted and Herculean effort, as indicated by the challenges \nconfronting  Punjab.  Enrollment  and  dropout  rates  stagnated  in  1996\u20132001.  There  is  a  large \ndisparity in gross enrollment rates across income groups, urban and rural areas, and genders. \nThe present facilities fall short of overall needs and require expansion. Many teacher vacancies \nhave  remained  unfilled  for  a  long  time,  particularly  in  disadvantaged  locations  where \nenrollments are the lowest. Expansion at primary level will be followed by subsequent increases \nin  middle  and  secondary  school  enrollments,  and  require,  among  other  things,  more  qualified \nteachers, good learning materials, and monitoring of children\u2019s learning.  \n  \n24. \nSome  administrative,  planning,  and  academic  functions  have  been  devolved  to  the \ndistrict  governments  (DGs).  The  administration  functions  that  have  been  devolved  include \nadministration of schools and colleges, recruitment of staff up to Basic Pay Scale-16, and intra-\ndistrict  transfer  of  staff.  The  devolved  planning  functions  include  the  opening  of  new  schools \nand  colleges,  upgrading  of  colleges  and  schools,  preparation  of  district  budgets,  approval  of \ndistrict development schemes up to PRs20 million, and purchase of stores and capital goods \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nfor  devolved  institutions.  The  academic  functions  that  are  now  with  DGs  include  the \nmanagement of SC affairs, conduct of class 5 and 7 examinations, and scholarship grants to \nhigh achievers. However, it is important to clarify the roles and responsibilities by level, given \nthe considerable overlap of functions between province and district. \n \n25. \nThe  main  concerns  relate  to  three  areas:  (i) rationalization  of  staff  in  terms  of  teacher-\nstudent  ratio;  (ii) increasing  resources  for  nonsalary  recurrent  expenditures  for  instructional \nmaterials, regular training, operation and maintenance, and supervision and monitoring, some of \nwhich  are  happening  through  SCs;  and  (iii) interdistrict  transfer  of  staff  up  to  Basic  Pay  \nScale-16.  The  major  policy  area  is  the  rationalization  of  staff  covering  the  following  aspects: \n(i) setting  standards  for  creating  desirable  student-teacher  ratio  including  gender  focus  for \nelementary and high school education; (ii) for primary education, the approved teacher-student \nratio  is  1:40,  which  has  implications  for  quality  education;  and  (iii) developing  a  medium-term \npolicy to implement the reforms. The other areas needing policy attention include (i) delegating \nauthority  to  DGs  for  strengthening  management  of  educational  institutions  (schools  and \ncolleges);  (ii) strengthening  monitoring  arrangements  for  regulation  of  the  private  sector  under \nthe rules approved by the Department of Education; and (iii) creating enabling environments for \neffective  functioning  of  SCs,  including  administrative  powers,  to  effectively  manage  human \nresources and school operations.  \n \n\n6. \n\nHealth, Nutrition, and Population Welfare \n\n \n26. \nDespite significant efforts, progress toward achieving health-related MDGs has not been \nencouraging  in  Pakistan.  Under  5,  infant,  and  maternal  mortality  rates  are  unacceptably  high; \nmalnutrition  is  a  major  contributor  to  infant  and  maternal  deaths.  Urgent  and  additional  efforts \nare therefore necessary to increase the likelihood of Pakistan achieving the maternal and child- \nmortality-related MDGs. The public health sector remains severely underfunded. Although 4.1% \nof  GDP  is  currently  spent  on  health,  only  0.7%  of  this  comes  from  public  spending  and  the \nremaining  from  out-of-pocket  private  expenditures.  Per  capita  annual  health  expenditure  is \nabout  $18.  The  public  sector  per  capita  provision  is  about  $3.17,  which  is  equivalent  to  the \naverage amount spent on the treatment of fever in public health facilities.11  \n \nIn  Punjab,  if  PG  were  to  fully  subsidize  the  health  care  for  one  third  of  people  living \n27. \nbelow  the  poverty  line  at  the  international  minimum  of  $30  per  person  per  annum  and  the \nremaining  two  thirds  pay  for  the  actual  cost  of  services,  federal  resources  and  development \npartner  assistance  will  fall  short  annually  by  about  PRs32.2  billion.  The  P-PRSP,  however, \nprojects  a  lower  shortfall  for  next  3  years,  which  may  be  underestimating  the  full  need  of \ndelivering an essential package of health services to the poor. However, the resource gap can \nbe  partly  bridged  through  efficiency  gains  as  well  as  additional  fiscal  inputs  into  the  basic \npackage of health services.  \n \n28. \nThe  policy  environment  during  the  last  few  years  in  Pakistan  generally  and  Punjab \nspecifically has been encouraging.

Related  targets  include:  (i) increase  in \ncontraceptive prevalence rate to 57% by 2012; (ii) sustained increase in the age of marriage for \ngirls;  and  (iii) decrease  in  population  growth  rate  to  1.6%  by  2012.  PG,  under  the  P-PRSP, \nenvisages implementing a policy framework in line with the National Health Policy 2001 and the \nNational Population Policy 2002. The P-PRSP pledges to achieve targets set under the MDGs \nto reduce infant and child mortality, improve immunization of children, increase the proportion of \nbirths attended by health professionals, improve the contraceptive prevalence rate, and reduce \ntotal  fertility.  The  P-PRSP  highlighted  the  following  strategies  for  improving  health  status: \n(i) strengthening primary health care services with a focus on women, the poor, rural areas, and \nslums;  (ii) providing  adequate  referral  backup  services  including  emergency  care;  (iii) training \nand retaining of medical staff to improve quality of services; (iv) addressing gender imbalance, \nboth  in  provision  and  delivery  of  services;  (v) encouraging  public-private  partnerships;  and \n(vi) granting administrative autonomy to teaching hospitals. \n \n29. \nThe PLGO has devolved the following four functions of the health sector to DGs: basic \nand rural health, child and women health, hospitals up to district level, and population welfare. \nThe  last,  though  a  vertical  program  and  continues  to  be  federally  funded  and  provincially \nmanaged. However, there is a functional relationship with the executive district officer of health \nfor provision of family planning services. The federal Ministry of Health also supports preventive \nprograms through tied grants, and the system is well streamlined. The management staff of the \nhealth sector at district level is generally well trained in public health and management.  \n \n30.  The  main  challenges  in  advancing  devolution  are  related  to:  control  by  the  PG  on  staff \nappointments and posting and transfers; use of delegation of the financial powers rules of 1990; \nlack of alignment of the number and types of services and staff with the burden of disease; and \npoor  internal  monitoring  controls  by  committees  set  under  the  PLGO.  A  few  public-private \npartnership  initiatives  are  being  implemented,  and  need  to  be  evaluated  and  systematically \nexpanded based on the evaluation outcomes. The district-wise multiple indicator cluster surveys \nare likely to be available by the end of 2004. The surveys\u2019 results would guide the districts for \neffecting  improvements  in  planning  and  management  of  the  health  sector.  Finally,  a  formal  or \ninformal system for regulating the private health sector is lacking. \n \n\n7. \n\nWater Supply and Sanitation \n\n \n31. \nPG  aims  to  improve  access  to  water  and  sanitation  services.  The  10-year  Perspective \nPlan  targets  provision  of  safe  water  to  an  additional  34.2 million  people  (26.5 million  in  rural \nareas) and sanitation to 22.2 million (13.6 million in rural areas). Ongoing programs include two \nADB-funded  projects  (Southern  Punjab  Basic  Urban  Services  Project  and  Punjab  Community \nWater  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project)  (para.  19):  the  first  benefiting  2.3 million  rural \npeople in 54  tehsils of 26 districts, and the second 21 urban areas of southern Punjab. In the \nnext  few  2-3  years,  PG  plans  to  operationalize  408  water  supply  schemes,  improve  quality \nassurance, and build the capacity of TMAs. Since 2001/02, 116 TMAs have been implementing \nneeds-based  schemes  from  their  own  budgets  and  with  the  participation  of  their  citizens.  In \naddition to expanded coverage, future sector priorities include the development of a provincial \nstrategic plan and integrated master plans with prioritized rolling programs for each TMA, and \ncommunity motivation and organization of WUCs. \n \n32. \nThe  PLGO  created  TMAs  through  the  merger  of  staff  of  defunct  urban  councils  and \nprovincial  departments  of  Local  Government  and  Rural  Development  (LG&RD)  and  Housing \nand  Urban  Development  Planning  and  Public  Health  Engineering  Department  (HUD&PHED). \nTMAs  are  mandated  to  provide  municipal  services  including  water  supply  and  sanitation. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nIssues and Opportunities  \n\nHUD&PHED  transferred  122  field  staff  to  TMAs  and  retained  higher-tier  staff  in  four  regional \nunits  and,  at  the  provincial  level,  kept  powers  of  technical  sanction  of  schemes  costing  more \nthan  PRs5 million,  and  direct  implementation  of  the  ADB-financed  WSS  project  (para.  19). \nPrivate, formal sector involvement is limited to partnerships in solid waste management in urban \nareas  and  notable  but  small-scale  partnerships  in  sanitation.  In  brackish  groundwater  and \nwater-short  rural  areas  and  small  towns,  water  vending  through  informal  small  providers  is \ncommon. All construction works are carried out through private enterprises. \n \nThe  WSS  sector  faces  a  number  of  interrelated  challenges.  These  range  from  weak \n33. \ntechnical and operational practices inherited by TMAs from their predecessors to those relating \nto  TMAs\u2019  exclusive  mandate  for  planning  and  delivery  of  services  in  urban  and  rural  areas  in \ntheir  jurisdiction;  the  unfinished  agenda  for  devolution  (technical  sanction  and  administrative \napproval  powers,  service  cadre,  performance  grants,  etc.)  and  the  threat  of  reassumption  of \npowers by the authorities from which they were devolved; and the need for strategic direction, \nparticularly  focused  on  operation  and  maintenance,  water  quality  monitoring,  and  increased \nsanitation coverage. \n \nB. \n \n34. \nSlow  Pace  of  Devolution.  The  PLGO  became  effective  in  2001.  As  explained  in \nSupplementary Appendix A, much remains to be done to strengthen the capacity of LGs, clarify \nroles  and  responsibilities  of  LGs,  realign  intergovernment  relations  between  the  PG  and  LGs, \nand ensure increased and predictable funding to LGs to meet social services needs. While the \nLGs  are  now  responsible  for  the  delivery  and  management  of  social  services,  their \nadministrative and financial authority is not commensurate with the assigned responsibility. PG \nhas  a  key  role  in  supporting  LGs  by  (i) providing  TA  for  capacity  building;  (ii) establishing \npolicies, procedures, and minimum standards for service delivery; (iii) ensuring timely transfer of \nsufficient  fiscal  resources;  and  (iv) undertaking  monitoring  and  evaluation  to  ensure  minimum \nstandards of services and improved service delivery. The PG has a critical role in providing the \nenabling  environment  for  the  LGs  to  improve  their  functional,  financial,  and  managerial \nautonomy  in  line  with  the  PLGO,  so  as  to  empower  LGs  to  improve  social  services.  It  is \nessential to institutionalize LG councils and committees to make LGs\u2019 monitoring systems more \neffective, transparent, and accountable.     \n \n35. \nLGs are facing major challenges to rationalize devolved social services in line with local \nneeds and improve quality and sustainability of social services. The related issues include lack \nof clarity in roles and responsibilities of LGs and provincial line departments (PLDs), dual control \non  appointments  and  transfers,  restricted  financial  autonomy,  absence  of  a  culture  of  public-\nprivate  partnerships  (PPPs),  fiscal  constraints,  and  capacity  issues.  LGs  lack  appropriate \nfinancial and administrative powers to use their budgets optimally. LGs\u2019 staffing and thus their \nrecurrent budgets have no relation with funding needs; hence the same allocation would have \ndifferent impacts in different locations. LGs have faced problems in recruiting staff because of \nrecruitment  bans.  Thus  there  is  a  need  for  increasing  the  fiscal  transfers  to  LGs,  giving  LG \nadministrative  and  financial  authority,  improving  management  capacity  and  procedures,  and \ndeveloping partnerships with local communities. Most of these issues fall in the domain of the \nlocal  government  commission  (LGC)  and  provincial  finance  commission  (PFC)  processes, \nwhich need strengthening.  \n \nStaffing  and  Local  Needs.  LGs  inherited  social  sectors  that  largely  benefited  the \n36. \nnonpoor  and  urban  population  and  were  poorly  staffed  in  rural  and  hard-to-reach  areas. \nUtilization  rates  were  low,  particularly  among  the  poor,  women,  and  children.  The  quality  and \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10\n\n \n\ncapacity of service delivery have been hampered largely due to past recruitment bans resulting \nin  vacancies  in  essential  positions  and  the  absence  of  a  mechanism  to  provide  appropriate \nincentives to qualified staff to work in disadvantaged locations where the needs are most acute. \nCurrent  staffing  at  the  PLDs  and  LGs  is  not  in  line  with  priority  services.  This  situation \nparticularly applies to the health sector.  \n \n37. \nThe  new  environment  presents  opportunities  for  the  LGs  to  effectively  plan  and \nimplement  social  sector  services  and  undertake  alternative  ways  of  improving  access  and \nquality of social services for rural areas and the vulnerable populations, especially women and \nchildren. Some options include setting differential pay packages to attract staff to work in remote \nareas; developing a cadre of village-based midwives who work on self-employment; contracting \nout  management  of  health  and  education  facilities  to  the  private  sector  and  NGOs;  and \nencouraging  CCBs,  community-based  organizations  (CBOs),  and  WUCs  to  invest  in  and \nmanage the social sector services. \n \n38. \nGiven that only a little over 20% women constitute the total workforce and representation \nof women in higher-level managerial positions is less than 5%, a gender-sensitive environment14 \nis clearly missing. The health and education sectors have a shortage of female staff, especially \nin rural and hard-to-reach areas. PG is committed to increasing the enrollment of girls in primary \nand  secondary  education,  the  proportion  of  female  teachers,  and  access  of  women  to  health \ncare. PG is also committed to major gender reforms planned under the Punjab GRAP. \n \n39.  Monitoring  Mechanisms.  Monitoring  mechanisms  are  weak  at  all  levels  and  are  not \neffective  in  supporting  improvements  in  governance  and  the  performance  of  social  sectors. \nAlthough  the  PLGO  provides  for  the  establishment  of  monitoring  committees  of  local \ngovernment institutions at all three levels, these are not  yet fully functional, especially at TMA \nand union administration levels. The rules of business for functioning of monitoring committees, \nthough  prepared,  have  not  yet  been  notified.  However,  PG  is  now  making  efforts  to  provide \ntransport facilities and additional staff to strengthen monitoring at the LG level. \n \n40. \nCommunity and Private Sector Involvement. While the PLGO promotes public-private \npartnerships and opportunities for community-led service delivery by mandating both DGs and \nTMAs to set aside 25% of their annual development budget for use by CCBs on local priorities, \nthe  participation  of  civil  society  structures  is  limited  and  only  a  few  CCBs  are  active  in  most \ndistricts. School management committees have been reorganized into SCs and given resources \nand  authority  to  supervise  school  affairs.  PESRP  is  supporting  the  formation,  composition  of \nmembers, and functions of SCs in six of the 34 districts in Punjab through NGO involvement to \nenhance  the  effectiveness  of  SCs.  Similarly,  WUCs  exist  to  manage  water  supply  schemes. \nHowever, LGs, civil society, and the private sector require an appropriate enabling environment \nto  expand,  strengthen, and  sustain  their  partnerships  to  deliver  improved  social services.  This \nincludes incorporating lessons learned from ongoing initiatives. \n \n41. \nThe private sector is a major provider of health, education, and WSS services, especially \nin  urban  areas.  The  private  health  sector  provides  a  large  volume  of  outpatient  care,  mostly \nthrough  low  cost  solo-practitioners,  where  the  quality  of  care  is  questionable.  It  also  provides \ninpatient services but only in large urban centers and at very high cost. In education, the private \nsector continues to grow and accounts for over 30% of overall school enrollment. Although rules \nfor the regulation of private schools have been framed, DGs oversee only the initial registration \nof new schools. Thus, there is an urgent need to review current regulatory procedures to assure \n\n                                                        \n14 For example, absence of toilets for women at the work place and transport services. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nthe  quality  of  services  provided  by  the  private  sector.  The  public  sector  can  also  develop \npartnerships with the private sector and civil society to deliver social services. Some partnership \nexperiments,  such  as  contracting  \u2013in  and/or  out  management  services,  expanding  services \nthrough  NGOs  using  health  and  education  foundations,  the  private  sector  holding  evening \nclasses  in  public  schools,  encouraging  participation  of  CCBs  and  WUCs,  and  giving \nautonomous  status  to  some  hospitals  are  already  working.  However,  these  initiatives  require \nmore support to be sustained. \n \nLessons  Learned.  The  lessons  learned  from  the  Second  Social  Action  Program15 \n42. \nimplementation  as  presented  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B  have  been  carefully  reviewed  to \ndevelop a robust design for Punjab Devolved Social Services Program (PDSSP). According to \nthe  project  completion  report  of  the  Second  Social  Action  Program,  the  project  design, \nappropriateness, and likelihood of success have a direct relationship with (i) the political system, \nwhich  is  well  defined  and  appropriate;  (ii) clearer  roles  and  responsibilities  at  various  levels  of \ngovernment;  (iii) difficulty  of  implementing  institutional  reforms  in  isolation  without  addressing \npoor  governance;  and  (iv) simple  design  and  modest  scope  of  the  project  if  implementation \ncapacity  is  weak.  The  devolved  system  under  the  PLGO  provides  good  opportunities  to \nimplement  PDSSP,  as  the  three-tier  political  system  of  LGs  is  well  crafted  and  backed  by  a \nnumber  of  council  committees  with  a  built-in  system  of  transparency  and  public  voice  and \npressures. The PDSSP design creates a balance between institutional reforms and governance \nissues,  is  not  complex,  and  is  supported  by  a  package  of  TA  to  address  institutional  and \ngovernance issues. The PG has agreed during the formulation of PDSSP to flexible financing of \nsocial  sectors  to  address  gaps  in  service  delivery,  target  the  poor  and  vulnerable  including \nchildren and women, capacity building, and monitoring and evaluation. PDSSP will complement \nother externally funded programs in Appendix 3. \n \n43. \nPDSSP  follows  (and  has  benefited  from)  the  basic  design  principles  adopted  by  the \nSindh Devolved Social Services Program16 in terms of the main policy outcomes and conditional \ngrants mechanism. In addition, PDSSP has incorporated lessons learned from Sindh\u2019s program: \n(i) approval of Planning Commission Performa-1 for the TA component by loan effectiveness to \nexpedite the use of consultants; (ii) more carefully designed TA component to target support for \npolicy actions and capacity building under PDSSP at the provincial and LG levels; and (iii) more \ntimely  and  active  involvement  of  the  PFC  in  coordinating  the  conditional  grants  mechanism  to \nensure  more  effective  use  of  funds  by  the  participating  LGs.17  Supplementary  Appendix  C \nprovides a comparison between the Sindh program and PDSSP. \n \nExtensive  stakeholder  consultations  were  undertaken  during  the  design  phase  of \n44. \nPDSSP.  ADB  financed  TA  and  staff  consultants  for  the  analysis  of  sector-specific  and \ncrosscutting  issues.  The  TA  team  developed  a  program  approach  through  stakeholder \nconsultations at provincial and regional workshops. The project completion report of the Second \nSocial  Action  Program  (para.  43),  the  reports  on  progress  made  in  social  sectors  since  the \nimplementation  of  PLGO,  and  the  DSP  also  provided  important  insights  on  the  implications  of \n\n                                                        \n15  ADB.  1996.

A  continuing  dialogue  with  stakeholders  at  all  levels,  both \nthrough consultants and ADB Management, during PDSSP implementation would be necessary \nto ensure effective implementation of PDSSP.  \n \n \n\nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n \nA. \n \n45. \nThe overall goal of PDSSP is to achieve progress on MDGs related to poverty, gender, \neducation, health, and WSS. The program objective is to strengthen devolved social services for \na more equitable, efficient, effective, and sustainable delivery of social services in line with the \nPLGO. In order to achieve the goal and objective, it will be necessary to (i) increase funding to \nsocial  sectors  to  expand  access  to  health  services,18  especially  for  women  and  children, \nincrease  school  enrollment  rates,  and  improve  access  to  WSS  facilities;  (ii) move  away  from \nprovincially-driven  to  demand-driven  programs  that  are  identified  and  implemented  by  LGs  in \nline  with  P-PRSP,  MTBF  and  provincial  strategic  plans  and  guidelines  to  achieve  MDGs;  and \n(iii) enhance the capacity of LGs to assume new roles and responsibilities in social services as \nenvisaged  under  the  PLGO,  including  participatory  planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring \nand evaluation.  \n \n46. \nThe proposed policy matrix explicitly reinforces the transfer of powers to the LGs, e.g., \nstrengthening of planning processes, further devolution of administrative and financial powers to \nLGs,  empowerment  of  LG  monitoring  committees,  empowerment  of  females,  and  transfer  of \nadditional  funds  to  LGs  to  improve  the  equity  and  quality  of  social  services.  The  road  map  to \nmove  from  the  current  stage  to  the  next  stage  is  articulated  in  the  three  principal  policy \noutcomes  that  PDSSP  seeks  to  support:  (i) realigning  intergovernment  relations  to  support \ndevolved  social  services,  (ii) rationalizing  and  setting  minimum  standards  for  social  services, \n(iii) strengthening  public  accountability  mechanisms  and  promoting  public-private \nand \npartnership (PPP).   \n \n47. \nThe TA component will support activities in line with the program framework and policy \nmatrix  in  the  following  broad  areas:  (i) capacity  building  of  LGs;  (ii) partnership  development \nwith  private  sector  including  NGOs,  CBOs,  and  WUCs;  (iii) sector-specific  policy  reforms;  and \n(iv) planning,  programming,  management,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  TA  will  be \nprovided for a period of 4 years.  \n \n48. \nPDSSP will be implemented in close coordination with other ongoing poverty reduction \nand reform programs that support the devolved system under the PLGO, such as DSP, PRMP, \nAccess to Justice Program, PESRP, and GRAP in the areas of accounting, auditing, institutional \nstrengthening,  monitoring,  social  sector  reforms,  governance,  PPP,  and  mainstreaming  of \ngender concerns. \n \nB. \n \n49. \nThe policy outcomes and related policy actions are summarized below. \n \n \n\nThe  policy  matrix  is  in  Appendix  4  and  the  development  policy  letter  is  in  Appendix  5. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n                                                        \n18 Includes reproductive health and nutrition services. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n1.  \n\nRealigning Intergovernment Relations to Support Devolved Social Services \n\n \n \n \n50. \nPG  will  introduce  the  necessary  policy  changes  in  the  social  sector  to  support  the \ndevolution  process.  PLDs  (DOE,  DOH,  Department  of  Special  Education  [DOSE],  and \nHUD&PHED)  will  establish  a  consultative  process  to  formulate  and  disseminate  5-year \nprioritized strategic plans for their respective sector. The strategic plans will be implemented by \nthe  participating  LGs  and  PLDs,  and  will  delineate  clearly  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  PG \nand  participating  LGs.  Each  DG  and  program  TMA  will  develop  annual  sector  plans.  At  least \n75% of DGs and 50% of program TMAs will develop 3-year sector rolling plans consistent with \nthe  5-year  strategic  plans.  The  3-year  rolling  plans  will  identify  local  priorities  and  will  help \nprovide  predictability  to  funding  priorities.  The  institutional  analysis  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix D. \n \n51. \nThe financial and administrative powers of the  LGs will also be enhanced. LG&RD will \nlead the process of identifying gaps in implementation and the further devolution of financial and \nadministrative  powers  to  LGs.  The  capacity  of  TMAs  will  be  enhanced  to  further  devolve \nfinancial and administrative powers.  \n  \n52. \nEach  participating  LG  will  enter  into  a  memorandum  of  understanding  (MOU)  for \nconditional grants with PG. The MOU will, among other things, state (i) the eligibility and access \ncriteria  for  DGs  and  program  TMAs  to  qualify  for  and  access  the  loan  proceeds;  (ii) the \nobligations  and  responsibilities  of  PG,  DGs,  and  program  TMAs;  (iii) a  negative  list  to  prevent \nthe  loan  proceeds  from  being  utilized  for  nonbasic  devolved  social  services;  and  (iv) a  set  of \nbenchmarks  to  monitor  the  progress  made  by  DGs  and  program  TMAs.  The  draft  MOU  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix E. \n \n53. \nThe purpose of the conditional grants is to provide incentives to DGs and program TMAs \nto  undertake  reforms  in  the  social  sectors,  including  increasing  allocations  and  prioritizing \nexpenditures  in  the  social  sectors.  The  conditional  grants  will  be  tied  to  fulfilling  certain \nconditions  associated  with  intended  reforms,  including  (i) increased  expenditure  levels  (total, \nsalary, and nonsalary); (ii) improved gender representation and mainstreaming; (iii) promotion of \nPPPs  (percentage  funds  utilized  for  PPPs);  (iv) improved  indicators  (process-related,  such  as \ntimely release of funds; output-related such as percentage of completed schemes in the annual \ndevelopment  plan,  levels  of  enrollment  particularly  of  girls  and  disadvantaged  children;  and \noutcome-related  such  as  completion  rates  and  utilization  rates);  and  (v) timely  accounting, \nauditing, and reporting. (The use of conditional grants is discussed in Appendix 6.) \n \n \n \nThe  development  and  enforcement  of  service  standards  is  an  important  instrument  for \n54. \nimproving  the  quality  of  social  services  using  evidence-based  interventions.  By  establishing \nclear,  objective,  and  agreed  performance  benchmarks  and  explicitly  defining  expectations  in \nterms of inputs, processes, outputs, and outcomes, the PG can provide the enabling framework \nfor  more  effective  and  efficient  service  delivery  at  the  LG  level.  Social  services  currently  lack \nfocus on poor and vulnerable groups, and on women. PG will assess the quality and relevance \nof  existing  social  services  vis-\u00e0-vis  these  groups,  set  pro-poor  and  gender-sensitive  minimum \nservice delivery and technical standards in consultation with LGs, and assist LGs to rationalize \nservice provision. This will include targeting the poor within the social sector. PG, in consultation \nwith LGs, will develop guidelines and criteria to select pro-poor activities for annual sector plan \nand through PPPs.  \n\nRationalizing and Setting Minimum Standards for Social Services  \n\n2.  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14\n\n \n\n \n55.  With  a  view  to  improving  the  quality  and  capacity  of  services,  especially  in \ndisadvantaged  locations,  PG  will  review  the  existing  situation  and  regulations  pertaining  to \nappointment,  transfer,  promotion,  and  will  introduce  reforms  to  fill  all  essential  vacancies.  The \ncurrent  staffing  at  the  PLDs  and  LGs  is  not  in  line  with  the  priority  services.  This  situation \napplies particularly to the health sector. DOH will rationalize the staff mix and the skills mix at \nprimary  care  and  tehsil  hospitals  in  line  with  the  prevailing  burden  of  disease.  This  will  also \ninclude  rationalization  of  management  staff  to  improve  management  and  performance  of  key \nsubsystems,  such  as  reproductive  and  child  health  services.  Staff  availability  in  hard-to-reach \nareas  will  be  ensured  through  better  incentives  and  facility-based  recruitment,  as  PG  has \nagreed  to  introduce  differential  contract  pay  packages  to  attract  technical  staff  in  such  areas. \nPG  has  already  developed  and  approved  the  Punjab  GRAP  and  will  mainstream  its \nimplementation, with a focus on increasing representation of female members in the department \nselection committees up to 25%19 and on raising quotas for women\u2019s recruitment in the health \nand  education  sectors.  In  support  of  the  overall  GRAP  framework,  the  Program  will  seek  to \nintroduce gender sensitivity in planning and budgeting decisions, through specific requirements \nsuch  as  inclusion  of  women  on  relevant  council  committees  and  providing  incentives  for  the \ninclusion of gender-specific investments in the annual sector and 3-year rolling plans. The staff \nrationalization plans will be integrated into the strategic plans and LGs\u2019 3-year rolling plans. \n \n \n\nStrengthening  Public  Accountability  Mechanisms  and  Promoting  Public-\nPrivate Partnerships  \n\n3.  \n\n \n56. \nTo  improve  governance,  PDSSP  will  support  the  proposed  monitoring  mechanisms  to \nimprove  the  performance  of  the  social  sectors.  PLDs,  in  consultation  with  LGs  and  under  the \noverall  guidance  and  leadership  of  the  LGC,  will  undertake  a  comprehensive  review  of \nmonitoring  systems  in  the  social  sectors  at  all  levels,  in  order  to  develop  and  implement  a \nmonitoring  strategy.  This  intervention  is  expected  to  further  strengthen  and  institutionalize \nmonitoring in the social sectors at all levels, including third party evaluations. Improvements in \nmonitoring  will  include  strengthening  management  information  systems,  ensuring  access  to \nmore  timely  and  reliable  information,  putting  information  on  the  web  for  easy  access  by  the \npublic,  sharing  findings  from  third  party  evaluations,  and  implementing  a  behavior  change \ncommunication campaign that informs citizens of the reasons for poor social indicators.  \n \n57. \nPDSSP  will  provide  support  to  make  operational  the  monitoring  committees  of  local \ngovernment  institutions.  The  bye-laws  for  LGs\u2019  monitoring  committees  will  be  approved,  and \nLGs\u2019  committees  at  three  levels  will  be  made  effective.  Monitoring  criteria  to  be  used  will  be \ntransparent and objective. PDSSP will help to make council committees functional and ensure \ncitizen participation in LG forums, e.g., SCs, CCBs, and village councils. PDSSP will establish \ninformation flows on service standards, budgets, charters, management reports, and studies, for \nwider public information and effective citizen participation. \n \n58. \nPDSSP  will  support  PG  in  undertaking  a  comprehensive  review  of  policy  options  for \nPPPs.  Given  that  both  the  health  and  education  sectors  have  significant  involvement  of  the \nprivate sector, PG and LGs can benefit from different forms of PPPs, including the operation of \nthe  Health  Foundation,  provision  of  autonomy  to  some  district  hospitals,  and  involvement  of \nNGOs,  CBOs,  or  CCBs  in  the  management  of  public  health  facilities  and/or  promotion  of \nalternative  service  delivery  mechanisms.  All  of  these  initiatives  could  be  replicated  to  improve \nsocial  services  and  could  be  supported  through  conditional  grants.  PG  will  develop  a \n\n                                                        \n19 At present none, except executive district officer in five districts as committee members.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nImportant Features \n\ncomprehensive  policy  on  PPPs  in  the  social  sectors  through  a  consultative  process  to  enable \nLGs to implement various models of PPPs in line with the local environment as part of 3-year \nrolling plans. The policy on PPPs, with a focus on health and the WSS sector, will be prepared \nin  consultation  with  LGs  and  approved  by  PG.  Guidelines  will  be  prepared  to  allow  NGOs, \nCBOs,  and  CCBs  to  seek  proposals  for  partnership  with  public  sector  institutions  to  offer \nalternative forms of service delivery and/or to  enhance existing public social service provision. \nBased on the policy on PPPs, PG will support LGs in strengthening and institutionalizing PPPs \nin  social  service  delivery  at  all  levels.  PDSSP  funds  will  be  used  to  finance  proposals  for \nexpanding  service  delivery.  PDSSP  will  also  support  facility-based  committees  for  health \nfacilities,  especially  at  tehsil  and  district  hospitals,  to  improve  their  operation  for  better  quality \nservices, particularly to underserved constituencies.  \n \n59.  With the standards to be introduced, the monitoring system to be strengthened, and the \npolicy  on  PPP  to  be  developed,  PG  and  LGs,  with  support  from  PDSSP,  will  be  able  to \nstrengthen their quality assurance functions. TA will be available for capacity-building initiatives, \nand  for  strengthening  and  institutionalizing  quality  assurance.  For  instance,  the  HUD&PHED \nwants to focus on expanding water-testing capacity, including bacteriological testing. \n \nC. \n \nThis  is  the  first  ADB-supported  program  loan  for  the  social  sectors  in  Punjab.  PDSSP \n60. \nprimarily  supports  more  effective  implementation  of  social  sector  programs  in  line  with  the \nPLGO  under  the  new  three-tier  governance  structure  of  the  LG  system.  PDSSP,  besides \nproviding  additional  finances,  has  a  number  of  special  features  to:  (i)  support  devolution;  (ii) \nimprove  intergovernment  relationships;  (iii)  support  PFC  processes  to  make  funding  more \npredictable  and  transparent;  (iv)  develop  partnerships  to  support  alternative  mechanisms  of \nservice delivery, and (v) support policy reforms to align national, provincial and district priorities \nto  achieve  progress  on  MDGs.  The  PDSSP  design  includes  interventions  for  PPP  and  a \ncitizens\u2019 role in monitoring to ensure improved governance through community participation and \ntransparency, with a consequent impact on quality and efficiency of social services. \n \n61.   PDSSP  has  been  designed \nintegrating \n(i) consumer  perspectives  through  focus  group  discussions,  (ii) provider  perspectives  through \nregional  workshops,  and  (iii) district  manager  perspectives  through  discussions  and  meetings \nwith planners and policy makers. PDSSP thus provides an opportunity for the LGs to prioritize \nand  implement  basic  social  services  in  line  with  their  needs  and  within  the  framework  of  the \nPLGO. \n \n62. \nPDSSP  makes  special  provisions  for  protecting  poor  and  vulnerable  groups,  including \nwomen.  The  design  and  implementation  of  pro-poor  service  delivery  packages  will  ensure \ngreater  benefit  to  the  poor  and  marginalized  population.  PDSSP  will  provide  better  access  to \nhealth  facilities  for  the  poor,  rural  populations,  women,  and  children.  It  will  create  educational \nfacilities  for  handicapped  children  and  for  girls  in  less  affluent  districts.  The  expansion  of  the \neducation  system  for  girls  will  help  in  expanding  the  pool  of  female  students  to  become \nschoolteachers,  nurses,  midwives,  and  doctors.  PDSSP  also  directs  expenditures  to  make \nprogress on the MDGs that largely benefits the poor and women. Similarly, WSS schemes will \nmostly benefit small villages and population clusters. \n\nthrough  participatory  methods  and  by \n\n \nPDSSP  includes  unique  mechanisms  to  strengthen  the  PFC  process  to  provide \n63. \nconditional grants to LGs. PG will include conditional grants as part of the PFC award from the \nsecond  year  to  channel  funds  to  LGs  based  on  a  predictable  and  transparent  formula.  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16\n\n \n\nIn  addition, \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nfrom  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR). \n\nConditional  grants  are  flexible  grants  to  participating  LGs  that  would  enable  them  to  improve \nplanning,  prioritization,  allocation,  and  utilization  of  funds,  based  on  local  conditions  and \npriorities to achieve progress on social sector indicators.  \n \nPDSSP  explores  synergies  with  other  ongoing  programs,  such  as  the  ADB-supported \n64. \nDSP  and  PRMP,  aimed  at  supporting  decentralization  and  governance  reforms,  accounting, \nbudgeting  and  auditing,  operationalizing  P-PRSP  priorities,  and  strengthening  the  MTBF  for \npredictable and sustainable funding. \n \nD. \n \n65. \nThe Government has requested two loans: a program loan of $75 million equivalent from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund  [ADF])  and  a  program  loan  of \n$75 million  equivalent \nthe \nGovernment  of  the  United  Kingdom,  through  the  Department  of  International  Development \n(DFID)  will  provide  grant  assistance,  to  be  administered  by  ADB,  in  an  amount  equivalent  to \n$30 million (DFID grant) for budgetary support to PG. The loans and DFID grant will support the \npolicy reforms as described in the development policy letter and the policy matrix. The resource \ncost of reform is estimated at $200 million equivalent over 3 years for policy reforms, reorienting \nexpenditures  toward  pro-poor  services,  filling  essential  vacancies,  sustaining  increased \ninvestments in the social sectors, promoting PPPs, augmenting and sustaining budgetary needs \n(both recurrent and development) of participating LGs for social services, and capacity building.  \n \n66. \nThe  ADF  loan  of  approximately  $75 million  equivalent  will  have  a  term  of  24  years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; an interest of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5%  thereafter;  and  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Program \nAgreements.  \n \nThe  OCR  amount  was  reinstated  after  PG\u2019s  request  and  the  Government\u2019s  approval. \n67. \nThe OCR loan will have a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; an interest rate \nto  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility, including a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum; and such other terms and \nconditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Program  Agreements.  The  Government  has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii) an  undertaking  that  these  choices \nwere its own independent decision and not  made in reliance on any  communication or advice \nfrom ADB. \n \n68. \nThe  loans  are  justified  by  the  content  and  expected  impact  of  policy  reforms  and \nassociated costs as part of the MTBF. Appendix 7 provides the social sector financing plan in \nPunjab.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  relend  the  proceeds  of  the  loans  to  PG  in  domestic \ncurrency,  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions,  as  are  applicable  to  the  Borrower.  The  foreign \nexchange risk will be borne by PG. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \nProgram Management \n\n1. \n\n  \n\nThe  Planning  and  Development  Department,  Punjab  (P&DD)  will  be  the  Executing \n69. \nAgency  (EA).  The  P&DD,  acting  through  the  provincial  steering  committee  (PSC),  will  monitor \nthe  program  and  will  provide  overall  program  coordination,  and  policy  and  strategic  guidance. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nThe  PSC  will  be  headed  by  the  chairman,  P&DD  and  will  comprise  (i) secretary,  DOF; \n(ii) secretary,  DOH;  (iii) secretary,  DOE;  (iv) secretary,  DOSE;  (v) secretary,  HUD&PHED; \n(vi) secretary, LG&RD; (vii) secretary, Department of Women Development and Social Welfare; \n(viii) program directors from PRMP and DSP; and (ix) two representatives from NGOs. The PSC \nmay co-opt other members as appropriate. At least two members of the PSC will be women. PG \nhas also established an oversight committee chaired by the chief secretary to review progress \nmade  by  different  projects  and  programs.  Appendix  8  provides  the  program  implementation \norganization.  Supplementary  Appendix  F  provides  a \nimplementation \nresponsibilities.  \n \n70. \nDOH  will  be  the  lead  implementing  agency.  DOE,  DOSE,  HUD&PHED,  DGs,  and \nprogram  TMAs  will  act  as  additional  implementing  agencies.  DOH  will  house  the  program \nsupport unit (PSU) that will serve as the secretariat of the PSC and will comprise (i) a program \ndirector;  (ii) focal  officials  from  each  of  the  DOH,  DOE,  DOSE,  and  HUD&PHED;  and \n(iii) consultants to be identified under the TA. The PSU will provide (i) operational coordination \nand  technical  support  to  the  DOH,  DOE,  DOSE,  HUD&PHED,  and  the  local  support  groups  \n(LSGs);  and  (ii) support  to  the  DOH,  DOE,  DOSE,  and  HUD&PHED  in  the  planning, \nimplementation, and monitoring of sector-specific policy reforms. One LSG will be established in \neach  DG  which  will  provide  technical  support  to  DGs  and  program  TMAs  to  assume \nresponsibilities  for  NGOs,  CBOs,  and  CCBs  as  development  partners  and  to  monitor  their \nactivities. \n \n\nlist  of  program \n\nThe program support and policy reforms will be implemented over a period of 3 years. \n\n71. \nThe program period will be from 31 March 2005 to 31 March 2008. \n \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n \n\n72. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  finance  the  foreign  exchange  cost  of  items  produced  in  and \nprocured from ADB member countries, excluding listed ineligible items and imports financed by \nother  multilateral  and  bilateral  sources.  ADB  will  have  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  the  loan \nproceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification. Appendix 9 lists the ineligible \nitems. The Borrower will certify that (i) if the loan proceeds finance goods already imported, the \nvolume  of  eligible  imports  in  the  period  concerned  will  exceed  the  amount  of  the  requested \nwithdrawal;  or  (ii) if  the  loan  proceeds  finance  items  to  be  imported,  the  value  of  the  eligible \nimports in the immediately preceding 1-year period will be equal to or greater than the amount \nof  the  requested  withdrawal  plus  all  other  amounts  expected  to  be  withdrawn  from  the  loan \naccount  during  the  succeeding  1-year  period.  The  program  loans  will  be  used  for  3  years, \nnamely  31  March  2005\u201331  March  2008.  Disbursement  will  be  made  under  the  simplified \nprocedures  for  program  loans,  approved  by  ADB\u2019s  Board  on  16  April  1998.  The  Government \nand  PG  will  certify  the  utilization  of  counterpart  funds  in  line  with  the  Loan  and  Program \nAgreements through audited statements acceptable to ADB. \n  \n\n4. \n\nTranching and Counterpart Funds \n \n\n73. \nCounterpart funds generated by loan proceeds will be used to provide budgetary support \nfor  devolved  social  services.  The  ADF  loan  of  $75 million  equivalent,  OCR  loan  of  $75 million \nequivalent, and DFID grant for budgetary support of $30 million will be used over 3 years and \nreleased in three tranches with minimum 1-year intervals. The three tranches will be disbursed \nas follows upon fulfillment of the conditions shown in the policy matrix: (i) tranche 1: $80 million \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18\n\n \n\nequivalent;  ADF:  $25 million;  OCR:  $40 million;  DFID:  $15 million;  (ii) tranche  2:  $55 million \nequivalent; ADF: $25 million; OCR: $20 million; DFID: $10 million; and (iii) tranche 3: $45 million \nequivalent; ADF: $25 million; OCR: $15 million; DFID: $5 million.  \n \nIn  view  of  the  level  of  current  assistance  already  being  received  by  the  education  and \n74. \nWSS  sectors,  PG  has  proposed  that  the  ADF  and  OCR  loans  and  DFID  grant  for  budgetary \nsupport  be  distributed  among  the  three  sectors  in  the  following  ratio:  health  sector  65%, \neducation  17%,  and  WSS  18%.  An  analysis  of  social  sector  financing  in  Punjab  confirms  that \nthe financing gap in the health sector is the largest and thus requires more support, in line with \nPG\u2019s proposal. \n \n75. \nPG will use the counterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the policy loans and \ngrant  to  finance  costs  associated  with  implementing  the  P-PRSP  and  the  devolution  under \nPLGO.  PG  will  include  the  counterpart  funds  in  the  provincial  consolidated  fund  (rather  than \noutside  the  budget),  under  the  provincial  allocable  component  for  onward  distribution  to \nparticipating LGs. PG will make available part of this budget support to DGs and program TMAs \nfor financing specific activities in the social sectors.  \n \n\n5. \n\nAccounting and Auditing  \n \n\nPrior  to  withdrawal,  the  Government  will  open  a  deposit  account  at  the  State  Bank  of \n76. \nPakistan  to  receive  all  loan  proceeds.  The  deposit  account  will  be  established,  managed, \noperated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. Each DG will deposit the \nloan proceeds in a civil account and each program TMA will deposit the loan proceeds in a local \nfund account for efficient tracking of the loan proceeds and have their respective accounts and \nrelated  financial  statements  audited  and  annually  by  the  District  Audit  Office  of  the  Pakistan \nAuditor General. \n\n6. \n\n \nProgram Performance Management System  \n \n\nto  strengthen  management \n\n77. \nPG,  in  consultation  with  participating  LGs,  will  design  a  program  performance \nmanagement system (PPMS) for systematic program monitoring and to feed into the quarterly \nand  annual  progress  reports.  The  regular  progress  reports  will  track  implementation  of  policy \nreforms, sector financing, expenditure reporting from participating LGs, allocation of counterpart \nfunds,  formulation  and  implementation  of  annual  plans,  and  staff  appointments.  PPMS  will \ninclude benchmarking to compare progress made against a set of benchmarks prior to program \nthe  health \nimplementation, \nmanagement  information  system  and  the  educational  management  information  system  to \ninstitutionalize monitoring at all levels, to activate and strengthen institutional arrangements for \nmonitoring in line with the provisions under the PLGO, and to undertake independent third party \nsurveys20  to  monitor  outcome  and  impact  indicators.  District-based  multiple  indicator  cluster \nsurveys  and national Pakistan integrated household surveys with province-wise information are \ngood examples of third party surveys that will help in comparing the change over time because \nof  consistency  of  methodology  and  sample  size.  PPMS  arrangements  are  explained  further  in \nAppendix 10.  \n  \n\ninformation  systems  such  as \n\n                                                        \n20 For example, Community Information Empowerment and Training, Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey, etc. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\n7. \n\nProgram Review and Reporting \n\n \n78. \nPG,  acting  through  the  PSC,  will  monitor  the  implementation  of  reforms  agreed  under \nthe  program.  The  PSU  will:  (a)  with  the  assistance  of  LSGs,  monitor  the  program,  on  a \ncontinuous basis; and (b) provide ADB with reports of the PPMS, on a quarterly basis. PG, in \nconjunction  with  ADB  and  DFID  will:  (a)  conduct  a  comprehensive  mid-term  review  with  the \nassistance  of  an  independent  expert  in  the  last  quarter  of  the  second  (2)  year  of  program \nimplementation to evaluate the progress with policy reforms including: (i) financial flows; (ii) the \nactivities  of  DGs  and  program  TMAs;  (iii)  public-private  initiatives;  (iv)  effectiveness  of  service \ndelivery;  (v)  allocations  to  and  expenditures  in  social  services;  and  (vi)  coverage  of  services; \nand (b) prior to each tranche release, carry out a policy review to assess the achievement of the \npolicy reforms. Such review will use a participatory process including field visits. ADB and DFID \nwill conduct an inception mission, biannual review missions, and a program completion mission. \nDuring each mission, findings will be discussed with PG and an action plan will be agreed upon. \nADB  will  provide  a  full-time  specialist  at  its  Pakistan  Resident  Mission  to  strengthen  regular \nsupervision.  Monitoring  will  also  be  an  ongoing  exercise  through  the  PSU  and  local  support \ngroups  (LSGs),  and  through  support  from  DSP.  Monitorable  and  time-bound  actions  are \nreflected in the policy matrix. \n \n\nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n79. \nA TA component is proposed to support social service policy reforms under PDSSP and \nenhance  capacity  of  participating  LGs  to  improve  quality,  access,  efficiency,  and  cost-\neffectiveness of social services covering three sectors, namely health, education, and WSS. \n \nA. \n\nScope \n \n80. \nThe  goal  of  the  TA  component  is  the  same  as  the  overall  program  goal:  \u201cTo  achieve \nprogress on MDGs related to poverty, gender, education, health, and water and sanitation.\u201d The \npurpose  is  for  the  PLDs  and  participating  LGs  to  ensure  effective  delivery  of  social  services \naccording to their mandate as described under the PLGO. \n \nThe  TA  component  will  provide  support  under  four  output  areas:  (i) the  timely  and \n81. \neffective  processing  of  the  Devolved  Social  Services  policy  matrix,  conditional  grants,  and \ncapacity-building  support;  (ii) enhanced  capacity  of  PG  to  take  forward,  on  an  ongoing  basis, \nsocial sector policy development as specified in the policy matrix; (iii) increased capacity of LGs \nto  plan,  manage,  and  monitor  social  sector  development;  and  (iv) increased  capacity  of \ncommunities to work with PG to deliver services and hold it accountable for such delivery. \n \nB. \n \n82. \nUnder the TA component, four consultants will be recruited to the PSU to assist the PSC \nin coordinating the three main features of PDSSP: (i) the policy matrix, (ii) the conditional grants, \nand (iii) the three remaining areas of the TA component. \n \n83. \nThe  TA  component  will  provide  consultant  support,  training,  and  other  learning \nopportunities  on  a  flexible  needs  basis  (managed  through  the  procedure  detailed  in  section  D \nbelow) to support the PLDs in meeting the policy actions specified in the policy matrix. This will \ninclude  (i) strategic  planning  for  social  sectors  (the  development  of  strategic  sector  plans, \nsupported  by  sound  sector  economic  analysis  that  assesses  state  and  nonstate  service \nproviders; (ii) governance and institutional reforms required as part of the process of adjusting \n\nComponents \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20\n\n \n\ngovernment  institutions  following  devolution;  (iii) an  assessment  of  personnel  management, \nincluding  supporting  the  implementation  of  recommendations;  (iv) monitoring,  reporting,  and \nevaluation, especially ensuring the quality of information, supporting its use in decision making, \nand publicly disseminating information on the performance of services to empower community \ngroups  to  work  with  participating  LGs,  thereby  making  services  more  relevant  to  consumer \nneeds; and (v) technical dimensions of health and WSS policy, specifically in the areas of solid \nwaste, hazardous and infectious medical waste management, and sewage. \n \nThe TA component will support LG-level capacity building focusing on four key functions \n84. \nof LGs: (i) planning, (3-year rolling plans developed through a consultative process and building \non  situation  analyses);  (ii) developing  mechanisms  for  regulation  and  self-regulation  of  the \nprivate sector; (iii) supporting community participation and awareness campaigns in the areas of \nplanning  and  managing  service  delivery  improvements;  and  (iv) monitoring  and  reporting, \nincluding the activation of LG monitoring committees. \n \n85. \nThe  TA  will  mobilize  community  organizations  to  form  facility-based  committees  for \nhealth services, WUCs, and SCs. This support will dovetail with support provided to participating \nLGs to strengthen the relationship between CBOs and participating LGs. \n \nC. \n\nCost and Financing \n\n \n\nImplementing arrangements \n\nSteering Committee. The steering committee for the TA will be the PSC. The PSC will \n\n86. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  to  be  $25.0 million  equivalent,  comprising \n$3.2 million equivalent in foreign exchange costs and $21.8 million equivalent in local currency \ncosts.  The  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom  through  DFID  will  finance  $20.0 million \nequivalent,  comprising  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $16.8 million  equivalent  in  local \ncurrency, to be administered by ADB. This will provide 80% of the total cost of the TA, including \ninternational  and  domestic  consultant  services,  and  the  cost  of  training  programs,  equipment, \nvehicles,  and  furniture.  The  Government  will  finance  $5.0 million  or  20%  of  the  total  TA  cost, \nmainly  for  the  counterpart  budget  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  including \ncounterpart staff and facilities for the consulting team; taxes and duties on equipment, vehicles, \nand  furniture;  and  taxes  on  consultants.  The  TA  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan  are  in \nAppendix 11. \n \nD. \n \n87. \nbe the approving authority for annual TA plans submitted by the PLDs. \n \n88. \nTA on behalf of the EA and in close consultation with the PLDs and participating LGs.  \n \n89. \nImplementation  Period.  The  implementation  period  for  the  TA  component  is  4  years. \nThe implementation will continue a year after the closing of the program loans and DFID grant \nfor budgetary support. \n \n90. \nConsulting  Services.  A  TA  management  firm  will  be  recruited  for  overall  TA \nmanagement  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  following  quality  and \ncost-based selection procedures. This contract will include the scope of those services identified \ninitially and those that will be required later during program implementation. Indicative terms of \nreference will be included in this contract. Subsequent deployment of domestic consultants will \nbe  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  PSC.  The  TA  is  based  on  about  5,028  person-months  of \n\nExecuting Agency. P&DD will be the EA for the TA as well. The PSU will coordinate the \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nconsulting  services  (50  person-months  international  and  4,978  person-months  domestic).  A \nprovisional list of consultants with person-months is shown in Supplementary Appendix G. The \nprovisional list will be the starting point for PLDs and participating LGs to establish TA needs to \nmeet  program  requirements.  PLDs  and  LGs  with  the  support  of  the  TA  management  firm  will \nthereafter  submit  draft  terms  of  reference  (of  a  standard  format  provided  by  the  PSU)  to  the \nPSC,  through  the  PSU  program  coordinator.  The  PSC  will  agree  to  a  final  list  of  consultancy \nservices.  The  TA  management  firm  will  thereafter  finalize  the  terms  of  reference  (again  in \nstandard  format)  with  the  PLDs,  source  and  contract  the  services,  and  support  the  PLDs  to \nmonitor  the  delivery  of  services.  About  four  core  consultants  to  be  based  at  the  PSU  will  be \nrecruited individually.  \n \n91. \nInstitutional  Arrangements.  Arrangements  for  competitively  engaging  reputed  NGOs \nand  academic  institutions  and  firms  will  also  be  part  of  the  scope  of  work  of  the  management \nfirm. The firm will provide customized, relevant, capacity building within the social sector context \nand  the  PDSSP  framework,  including  issues  such  as  social  sector  planning  and  monitoring, \nquality assurance, client orientation in service delivery, and development of citizen charters.  \n \n92. \nProcurement. Contract packages for $500,000 equivalent or less will follow international \nshopping  procedures,  except  for  vehicles,  which  may  be  procured  through  local  competitive \nbidding.  Minor  packages  costing  $100,000  equivalent  or  less  may  be  procured  through  local \ncompetitive bidding or direct purchase, as per PG standard procurement, acceptable to ADB.  \n \n \n\nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nProgram Benefits \n\ninstitutionalization  of  strategic  planning  and  management  capacities \n\n \nA. \n \n93. \nInstitutionalized  Planning.  Social  sector  planning,  in  the  past,  was  ad  hoc  and \nnonparticipatory.  After  devolution,  the  planning  and  programming  of  the  basic  social  services \nwere decentralized to LGs. However, LGs have limited planning capacity. The devolved social \nsector  policy  reforms  include  support  for  developing  strategic  plans,  developing  PPPs,  and \nevolving  self-regulation  of  the  private  sector.  The  capacity-building  component  is  built  into  the \nTA  project  to  support  the  PLDs  and  participating  LGs.  Simultaneously,  the  TA  component  will \nalso  address \nin \nparticipating LGs for sustainability of the initiatives. PDSSP will also establish synergy with other \nongoing reform programs, such as PRMP, DSP, and PESRP. \n \n94. \nSocial  Sector  Financing.  PDSSP  will  provide  funds  to  participating  LGs  for  social \nsectors through Account IV, which is set up for LGs. Allocations to the social sectors will be in \nline  with  the  MTBF  estimates.  The  allocation  and  expenditure  figures  for  FY  2003/04  will  be \nused as benchmarks to monitor increases during the program period. PG will review the sector \nstrategies to align them with the P-PRSP, national commitments (Pakistan Health Policy, etc.), \nand  international  commitments  (MDGs)  to  accelerate  poverty  reduction  and  achieve  important \nmilestones in social development. A portion of the DFID grant will be reserved for encouraging \nan  increased  role  of  the  private  sector  and  NGOs  in  the  delivery  of  social  services  under  the \noverall stewardship of LGs. \n \n95. \nPro-Poor Social Services. At present, social services are not aligned with the burden of \ndisease,  the  needs  of  the  poor  and  vulnerable,  and  to  meet  the  MDGs.  The  program  design \nincludes special features and policies that will facilitate the development and implementation of \nessential, pro-poor packages of services with a special focus on addressing child survival and \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22\n\n \n\nmaternal  health;  improving  access  of  girls  to  primary  and  middle  schools  and  handicapped \nchildren to primary schools; and increasing access to potable drinking water and sanitation for \nthe  poor.  The  intended  beneficiaries  include  women,  girls,  children,  handicapped  people,  and \nthe  poor.  Resources  are  available  in  the  TA  component  to  rationalize  and  strengthen  social \nservices delivery and capacity building of LG staff, NGOs, and CBOs, to benefit the poor.  \n \n96. \nPublic-Private  and  Community  Partnerships.  PDSSP  will  support  PPPs  and \ncommunities  in  the  delivery  of  social  services.  PPPs,  to  be  developed  on  the  basis  of  a \ncomprehensive  nongovernment/private  sector  partnership  policy  and  piloting  innovative  and \ndifferent models of social service delivery, will open new avenues for delivering social services \nthrough  NGOs,  CBOs,  CCBs,  and  WUCs.  The  TA  component  will  build  capacity  of  registered \nnot-for-profit  organizations  for  developing  viable  social  sector  service  delivery  schemes  and \ntheir management capacity, and support sound intervention schemes for them.  \n \nB. \n \n\nImpacts  \n\n1. \n\nSocial Impact  \n\n \n97. \nPDSSP will improve the quality of human capital for a large majority of the population of \nPunjab, especially the rural population, poor segments, and handicapped and vulnerable people \nby improved targeting. Better governance and realignment of roles and responsibilities of PLDs \nand  LGs  are  expected  to  improve  quality,  efficiency,  access,  and  cost-effectiveness  of  social \nservices.  The  improved  quality  of  life  will  have  a  direct  impact  on  improving  the  social  sector \noutcomes  and  the  achievement  of  MDGs  as  specified  in  the  program  framework,  particularly \ninfant  and  child  mortality,  maternal  mortality,  and  a  broadening  of  the  pyramid  of  higher \neducational  achievements.  Through  pro-poor  sector  strategies  and  performance-based \ncontracting  mechanisms  between  PG  and  LGs,  the  social  services  are  expected  to  be  made \nmore  accessible  to  the  poor  and  marginalized.  There  will  be  no  land  acquisition  and  or \nresettlement and if required, unoccupied government land will be utilized. The summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10. \n \n\n2. \n\nGender  \n\n \n98. \nUniversal primary education and a focus on expanding middle education will benefit girls \nwhose enrollment still remains low. Higher enrollment of girls in primary and middle education \nwill  allow  more  girls  to  undertake  secondary  education,  which  is  strongly  associated  with \nreduction  in  infant  and  child  mortality  in  rural  areas.  Improved  access  to  and  management  of \npregnancy-related emergencies will not only help in lowering maternal mortality, but also help in \nbreaking the chain of family catastrophes. The implementation of the GRAP  (Appendix 10) will \nincrease access to social services by women. The implementation of the GRAP will be another \nwindow for mainstreaming women in the government structure and local bodies and improve the \nparticipation of women at management and decision-making levels. \n \n\n3. \n\nInstitutional Impact \n\n \n99. \nPDSSP  envisions  institutional  reforms  to  strengthen  the  newly  established  LG  system. \nThe  reforms  will  institutionalize  improved  governance,  access  to  information,  and  citizens\u2019 \nparticipation  in  planning  of  social  services  to  help  improve  service  delivery.  PDSSP  will \nstrengthen the compact between policy makers (PG and LGs), service providers (LGs and their \nstaff),  and  consumers  (communities)  to  make  social  services  more  accountable  to  the \ncommunities  they  serve,  especially  the  disadvantaged  and  deprived  communities.  The \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n23\n\ndevelopment  and  implementation  of  policies  for  PPPs\u2014hospital  autonomy,  NGOs,  CBOs, \nWUCs\u2014will  set  new  institutional  arrangements  for  use  of  public  funds  through  private  sector \nparticipation.  PDSSP  interventions  will  also  rationalize  institutional  structures  for  social  sector \noversight,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation,  thereby  contributing  to  improved  social  sector \nplanning and management systems.  \n \n\n4. \n\nEconomic and Poverty Impact \n\n \n100.  The social sectors will benefit from PDSSP through conditional grants. These grants are \nin  addition  to  social  sector  investments  already  planned  by  PG  and  LGs.  The  additional \nresource  envelope  is  mainly  focused  on  the  poor  and  vulnerable  through  delivery  of  essential \npro-poor  services.  The  expected  outputs  from  enhanced  investments  will  lead  to  human \ndevelopment  by  improving  basic  health  and  education,  which  in  turn  will  provide  impetus  to \naccelerate  economic  growth  and  reduce  poverty.  In  addition,  by  ensuring  a  focus  on  pro-poor \nsocial sector investments, the program loans also addresse important concerns of bridging wide \ngaps  in  income-based  social  development.  Indirectly,  better  governance  and  the  likely  social \ndevelopment  will  have  a  strong  positive  impact  on  poverty  reduction.  A  summary  poverty  and \nsocial analysis is in Supplementary Appendix H.  \n \n\n5. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\n \n101.  PDSSP  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B  due  to  issues  related  to  absence  of \nservice  standards  for  collection  and  disposal  of  hazardous  and  infectious  medical  waste,  and \nenvironmental  hazards  resulting  from  poor  disposal  systems  for  sewage  and  solid  waste. \nPDSSP includes interventions related to improving the environmental aspects over the medium \nterm through developing and implementing standard procedures and protocols for collection and \ndisposal of hazardous wastes. PDSSP will recruit two consultants, one for medical wastes and \nthe other for WSS waste management, to provide TA to DGs and program TMAs to develop and \nimplement standard operating procedures for disposal of hazardous and infectious waste, and \nsupport  training  of  related  staff.  The  environmental  assessment  summary  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix I. \n \nC. \n \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n1. \n\nPolitical Risks \n\nincluding \n\nthe  structural  adjustment \n\n \nthe \n102.  Many  reform  agreements, \nInternational Monetary Fund, ran into difficulty and were either delayed considerably or not fully \nimplemented  due  to  political  pressures  or  changes  in  Government.  Lack  of  communication \nabout  policy  reforms  in  the  past  has  caused  stiff  opposition  to  reforms.  However,  risk  of \nopposition  to  reforms  at  the  political  level  is  much  less  apparent  in  Punjab  than  in  other \nprovinces  because  of  a  more  stable  political  environment.  This  is  demonstrated  by  smooth \nimplementation of PRMP. PDSSP has an attached TA component to ensure ownership and to \nkeep  reforms  on  track  through  stakeholder  participation.  PDSSP  is  also  designed  within  the \nPLGO  framework,  which  remains  a  major  priority  of  both  the  federal  and  provincial \ngovernments. \n \n\nfacilities  of \n\n2. \n\nGovernance Risks \n\n \n103.  A major focus of PDSSP is to improve social sector governance and lead to transparent \nand objective decision making to minimize rent seeking. As a result, there is a risk that reform \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24\n\n \n\nimplementation  might  be  delayed  or  undermined  by  vested  interests.  PDSSP  includes  the \nfollowing  risk  mitigation  measures:  building  stakeholder  ownership  during  the  program  design \nand implementation stages; establishing program oversight mechanisms including participation \nof  LG  council  committees;  and  ensuring  synergy  with  other  reform  programs  such  as  PRMP, \nDSP, and PESRP.  \n \n\n3. \n\nCapacity Constraints \n\n \n104.  Devolution of delivery of social sector services to LGs presents both a challenge and an \nopportunity.  While  devolution  moves  social  sector  planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring \ncloser  to  beneficiaries,  it  also  introduces  an  additional  element  of  commitment  and  capacity \nproblems  in  terms  of  delivery.  At  present,  the  financial,  managerial  and  technical  capacity  of \nLGs  is  limited  and  there  would  be  limitations  in  effectively  spending  additional  funds.  LGs,  on \nthe other hand, are best positioned to ensure that new interventions are designed and located \nappropriately  and  involve  beneficiaries  in  the  design  of  social  services  and  user  fees.  These \nrisks will be mitigated by timely and appropriately designed capacity-building activities that will \nbe financed through the TA component.   \n \n\n4. \n\nMacroeconomic and External Risks \n\n \n105.  PG  has  faced  serious  budget  deficits  in  the  past,  and  has  a  history  of  poor  revenue \ncollection. There were serious budget cuts for the social sectors during the 1990s, resulting in \ndeteriorating  quality  of  social  services  and  stagnating  enrollment  rates.  According  to  the \nprojections  given  in  the  P-PRSP,  PG  has  committed  to  substantially  enhancing  social  sector \nallocations  in  the  coming  3  years,  with  an  average  increase  of  16%  for  health,  12%  for \neducation,  and  67%  for  WSS.21  These  additional  commitments  are  subject  to  the  improved \nperformance of the economy as a whole.  \n \n106.  Pakistan has strengthened its economic performance considerably over the last 3 years. \nThe Government has put in place a consistent economic management strategy that is based on \nfiscal stabilization and debt reduction to mitigate macroeconomic vulnerabilities. In FY2003/04, \nthe economy recorded a GDP growth rate of 6.4% as against 5.1% in 2002/03, the fiscal deficit \nhas  come  down  to  3.3%  of  GDP  compared  with  an  average  of  7.0%  in  the  1990s,  and  the \npoverty  rate  has  decreased  by  4.2%.22  With  ongoing  reforms  and  some  improvement  in  the \ninvestment  rate,  economic  growth  may  improve  further.  However,  the  country\u2019s  political  and \neconomic stability is dependent on geopolitical developments in the region, especially peaceful \nrelations with neighbors such as India and Afghanistan. \n \n\nVII.  ASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n107. \nwhich have been incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, PG has given the following specific assurances, \n\n(i) \n\nPG  will  ensure  (a)  that  the  objectives  achieved,  policies  adopted,  and  actions \ntaken prior to the date of the Loan Agreements, as set forth in the development \n\n                                                        \n21 The increases for social sector budgets in FY2004 were substantial: 41% in health, 27% in education, and 124% in \n\n22 Budget speech of the Finance Minister to the National Assembly, 12 June 2004. \n\nWSS.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n25\n\npolicy  letter,  will  continue  to  be  in  full  force  and  effect  for  the  duration  of  the \nprogram  period  and  subsequently;  and  (b)  proper  and  timely  achievement, \nadoption, compliance and implementation of the objectives, policies, and actions \nto be achieved, adopted, complied with, and implemented as set forth in the draft \ndevelopment policy letter will ensure that once achieved, adopted, complied with, \nand implemented, such objectives, policies, and actions will continue to be in full \nforce and effect during and subsequent to the program period.  \n\nPG  will  demonstrate  its  commitment  to  the  fiscal  decentralization  process  by \nensuring that all fees pertaining to the social sector are retained by such sector \nand utilized for better management of services. \n\nPG commits to increase (a) the social sector allocations in line with P-PRSP and \nMTBF  targets  and  (b)  the  social  sector  expenditures  as  a  percentage  of  total \nallocations  every  year  of  the  program  period  at  the  provincial,  DG,  and  TMA \nlevels: (i) 80% in 2005/06, (ii) 85% in 2006/07, and (iii) 90% in 2007/08. PG will \nalso maintain the provincial allocable funds as a percentage of divisible pool, at \nleast, at the 2003/04 level. \n\nPG  commits  to  create  greater  fiscal  space  for  the  DGs  and  the  program  TMAs \nand  will  ensure  that  their  capability  for  financial  management  is  enhanced  by \nimproving accounting, auditing, and reporting mechanisms.  \n\nPG  will  ensure  that  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  by  its  Department  of \nFinance to the eligible DGs and program TMAs within 1 month from the date of \nreceipt thereof. \n\nPG will require the DGs and the program TMAs to ensure timely flow of funds to \nparticipating CBOs, CCBs, and services. \n\nPG  will  require  the  DGs,  program  TMAs,  CBOs,  and  CCBs  to  adopt  and \nimplement clear procedures for the release and use of the loan proceeds. \n\n(viii)  PG will require: (a) each DG to deposit the loan proceeds in a civil account; and \n(b) each program TMA to deposit the loan proceeds in a local fund account, for \nefficient  tracking  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  have  their  respective  accounts  and \nrelated  financial  statements  audited  annually  by  the  District  Audit  Office  of  the \nPakistan Auditor General; \n\nPG  will  undertake  purposive  actions  to  achieve  role  clarity  regarding  the  PLDs, \nDGs,  and  TMAs  in  relation  to  the  social  sector,  with  clear  distinctions  between \nthe roles, responsibilities, and accountability at each level. \n\nPG  will  require  the  DGs  and  the  program  TMAs  to  rationalize  nonfunctional \nschools,  basic  health  units,  and  water  schemes  according  to  their  potential  for \nservice delivery. \n\nPG  will  establish  a  framework  to  selectively  support  training  institutions  for \ncapacity building and technical support of the DGs and the program TMAs. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\n(ix) \n\n \n(x) \n\n \n(xi) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26\n\n \n\n(xii) \n\n \nB. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n  \n \n\n \n\nPG  confirms  that  the  Program  will  not  entail  any  land  acquisition  and/or \nresettlement. In the event of unforeseen land acquisition and/or resettlement, PG \nwill  ensure  that:  (a)  all  land  required  for  the  purposes  of  the  Program  will  be \nPunjab\u2019s  land  free  from  any  encumbrances,  structures,  human  settlements,  or \ncultivation; (b) no person will be adversely affected in terms of ADB\u2019s  Policy on \nInvoluntary Resettlement; and (c) PG will prepare, in consultation with ADB, the \nrequisite  resettlement  plan(s)  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement.  In  such  an  eventuality,  any  award  of  civil  works  contracts  will  be \nconditional upon ADB\u2019s approval of such resettlement plan(s). \n\n \n(xiii)  PG will ensure that the Program and the TA will be carried out in accordance with \nthe  environmental  rules  and  regulations  applicable  in  Pakistan  and  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy.  PG  will  ensure  that  adequate  environmental  protection  and \nsafety measures will be included in the design of the program facilities and that \nthe  program \nin \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy.  PG  will  ensure  implementation  of \nenvironmental  monitoring  and  mitigation  measures,  and  the  environmental \nmanagement  plan  set  out  in  Supplementary  Appendix  I,  including  development \nand  implementation  of  (a)  service  standards  and  operating  procedures  for \ndisposal  of  hazardous  and  medical  waste,  and  (b)  provincial  policies  for  WSS \nand solid waste management. \n\nfacilities  will  be  constructed,  operated,  and  maintained \n\n \n(xiv)  PG  will, in a timely manner, promote and implement the  Punjab GRAP. PG will \nensure  that  in  accordance  with  the  gender  strategy  set  out  in  Appendix  12,  a \ngender  action  plan  will  be  prepared,  which  will  entail  gender-sensitive \ninterventions  in  areas  such  as  capacity  building  of  service  providers,  health \nservices  for  women  and  children,  strengthening  the  role  of  women  councilors, \nschool facilities for girls, and adequate representation of women in the PSC and \nthe PSU. \n\n \n(xv)  PG  will  allocate  and  make  available  to  the  PSU,  in  a  timely  manner,  requisite \ncounterpart  funds  from  its  budget  for  each  fiscal  year  to  ensure  smooth \nimplementation of the TA. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nPlanning Commission Performa-1 for the TA component will be approved by the \nExecutive Committee for National Economic Council. \n\nCopies of the agreed final drafts of the MOUs for conditional grants are available \nafter consultation with PLDs, PFC, LGC, and DGs and program TMAs. \n\nDFID will have confirmed the grant from the Government of the United Kingdom, \nand will have entered into arrangements with ADB, for administration by ADB, of \nthe grant.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n27\n\nVIII.

The  literacy  rate  is  very  low  in  Punjab  like  in  other  parts  of  Pakistan. \n1. \nThe literacy rate of the population 10 years and above is around 47% (57% for males and 36% \nfor females), with a much lower literacy of 38% (26% for females) in rural areas. The enrollment \nrates over the past few years have more or less stagnated, with gross enrollment rates (GERs) \nat primary, middle, and secondary levels at 53%, 45%, and 42%, respectively. The GER for girls \nat secondary level in rural areas is \nparticularly  low  at  20%  compared \nto  61% \nin  urban  areas,  as \nindicated  in  Table  A2.1.  Similarly, \nthe  GERs  are  much  lower  in  the \ndistricts \n15  most \ncompared \ndistricts, \ngender \nindicating \nimbalance and need for a focused \napproach. \n \nHuman  Resource  and  Infrastructure.  The  public  sector  operates  around  44,255 \n2. \nprimary schools, 6,873 middle schools, 4,463 high schools, 344 higher secondary schools, and \n374  colleges  for  professional  and  general  education.  These  institutions  are  managed  by \n500,000  staff  including  319,905  teachers. \nDuring  2002,  around  5 million  boys  and  girls \nwere  enrolled  at  primary  level,  1.64 million  at \nmiddle  level,  and  0.73 million  at  secondary \nlevel.  The  enrollment  at  middle  level  was \nequal  to  about  one  third  of  primary  level \nenrollment.  However,  the  continuation  rate \nafter  8  years  of  schooling  was  higher, \nmeaning  that  the  probability  of  continuing \neducation increases after completing grade 8. \nThe  disaggregation  by  gender  is  given  in \nTable  A2.2.  The  gender  gap  is  particularly \nvery  high  in  secondary  education,  indicating \nan  urgent  need  to  expand  enrollment  at  the \nsecondary level to match the rising enrollment \nat the middle school level.  \n \nOver 55,000 posts of teachers in the public sector at various levels are vacant, although \n3. \nthe Government of Punjab (PG) is now making serious efforts to fill these positions. Most of the \nstudents  do  not  have  access  to  reading  materials  in  addition  to  the  prescribed  textbooks. \nHowever,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-funded  Second  Science  Education  Sector \nProject provided materials for science subjects and mathematics.   \n \n4. \nPrivate Sector. According to Educational Management Information System (EMIS) data \nfor  2003,  the  private  sector  is  operating  18,387  schools  (6,785  for  boys,  4,065  for  girls,  and \n7,537  coeducation)  and  enrolled  31%  students  from  primary  to  higher  secondary  level  in  the \nage-group  of  5  to  16  years.  Efforts  are  under  way  to  engage  the  private  sector  through  the \nstrengthened Education Foundation.

Handicapped persons numbering about 1.8 million form about \n2.5% of the country\u2019s population. About one third falls in the school age-group of 5\u201319 years. In \nPunjab,  of  the  estimated  600,000  special  needs  children,  only  about  4,000  are  enrolled  in \nspecial  needs  schools.  Currently,  there  are  120  schools \nfor  all  four  disabilities  (Table  A2.3).  PG  operates  48 \nschools  with  an  enrollment  of  4,197  students.  Each \nstudent  is  paid  a  monthly  stipend  of  PRs200,  effective \nJanuary 2004. The salary of teaching staff has also been \ndoubled. However, careful analysis of policies, situations, \nand options available to address special needs education \nwould  require  determining:  (i) the  nature  and  magnitude \nof  disability;  (ii) potential  for  mainstreaming;  (iii) options \nfor  providing  special  needs  through  nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs);  and  (iv) ways  to  increase  the \nutilization of existing schools, which are generally big and \nunderutilized.  \n \nPolicy.  The  National  Education  Policy  1998\u20132010  envisages  achievement  of  universal \n6. \nprimary  education  by  2010  and  a  gross  primary  enrollment  rate  of  105%.  This  objective  is \ndirectly  linked  with  Poverty  Reduction \nStrategy  Paper  (PRSP)  and  Millenium \n(MDG)  2.  The \nDevelopment  Goal \nEducation  Sector  Reforms  (ESR)  2001\u2013\n2005  addresses  low  performance  of  the \neducation  sector  and  the  factors  that \ninequalities  between  genders, \ncreate \nincome  groups,  and  urban  and  rural \nareas.  The  ESR  targets  require  improved \nmobilization of resources including human \nresources  and  institutional  reforms  at  all \nlevels \nto  achieve  good  governance. \nHowever,  the  ESR  targets  are  ambitious \nand  are  not \nline  with  enhanced \nenrollment capacity that can be created in \nterms of both quality and access.  \n \n7. \nQuality  of  Education.  The  quality  of  education  at  all  levels  is  unacceptably  low.  The \nprescribed  teacher-student  ratio  of  1:40  at  primary  level  is  not  conducive  for  learning,  while \nthere are no standards beyond the primary level. The high dropout rate is a proxy indicator of \naccess to schools and low quality of education. Lack of basic facilities in schools, high teacher \nabsenteeism,  and  inadequate  monitoring  are  other  contributory  factors.  The  Department  of \nEducation  controls  interdistrict  transfers  of  teachers  with  consequent  loose  control  of  local \ngovernments  (LGs)  over  their  staff.  Punjab  Education  Sector  Reform  Program  (PESRP)  has \nbegun  to  address  some  of  these  problems  but  much  greater  efforts  are  required  to  address \nquality of education, teacher development and motivation, monitoring learning achievement, and \nidentifying alternatives of hiring qualified teachers. \n \n\nLiteracy \nGER-primary level \nNER-primary level \nMiddle school \nenrollment \nSecondary school \nenrollment \nGER = gross enrollment rate, NER = net enrollment \nrate. \nNote: The benchmark data differs from Pakistan \nIntegrated Household Survey 2001/02. \nSource: Consultant\u2019s report. \n\nTable A2.4: Education Sector Reforms Targets \nTarget \n2005  \n(%) \n  60.0 \n100.0 \n  76.0 \n\nBenchmark \n2001 \n (%) \n49.0 \n89.0 \n66.0 \n\nSubsector \n\n  55.0 \n\n  40.0 \n\n29.5 \n\n47.5 \n\nin \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\n \n\nFinancing. PG allocated PRs33,046 million to the education sector during 2002/03. The \n8. \nallocation of PRs42,023 million for 2003/04 shows a substantial increase of 27% over 2002/03. \nThe additional allocations during 2003/04 are largely the result of resources flowing under ESR. \nThe policy instruments under ESR attempt to (i) reduce teacher absenteeism, strengthen school \ncouncils,  improve  monitoring  and  evaluation,  encourage  public-private  partnerships  through \nrestructuring of the Education Foundation, and improve the quality of education; and (ii) improve \naccess to education by free education up to secondary level, girl scholarships for grades 6 to 8, \nschool consolidation, provision of missing infrastructure, and free text books. The PESRP credit \nof $100 million each for 3 successive years represents a huge injection of resources, providing \na major boost to the education sector and engaging the LGs in implementation.  \n \n9. \nCurrently,  secondary  education  is  receiving  very  limited  financial  support.  This  is \nparticularly true for girls\u2019 education, especially in the 15 most deprived districts. Without a major \nboost to girls\u2019 enrollment in secondary education, it will not be possible to achieve the MDGs on \ngender  parity.  It  will  also  not  be  possible  to  produce  enough  female  teachers  and  health \nworkers.  The  primary  candidates  for  investment  under  PDSSP  include  consolidation  of \nsecondary  schools,  upgrading  of  girl\u2019s  middle  schools,  developing  safety  nets  to  attract  girls\u2019 \nenrollment  in  secondary  schools  through  scholarships  and/or  free  textbooks,  and  selective \nexpansion  of  education  facilities  and  options  for  providing  education  to  handicapped  children. \nCareful  analysis  is  necessary  to  evolve  a  strategy  to  mainstream  special  needs  education  to \nenroll students to meet the Education for All target and selectively address the needs of those \nchildren  with  more  severe  disabilities.  Initially,  it  is  important  to  do  further  analysis  to  identify \nareas that would complement PESRP in order to avoid duplication and to evolve the innovations \nthat are essential in education. \n \nB. \n \n10. \nCurrent  Status.  The  poor  health  status  in  Pakistan  in  general  and  Punjab  province  in \nspecific  is  characterized  by  rural-urban,  income,  and  gender-based  differentials.  The  male  to \nfemale  sex  ratio  is  107 in  urban  and  105  in  rural  areas  .  The  infant  mortality  rates  are  88  per \n1,000  live  births  in  rural  areas  compared  to  65  in  urban  areas.  In  urban  areas,  the  gender \ndifferentials  in  infant  mortality  are  significant:  the  female  infant  mortality  rate  is  70  deaths  per \n1,000  live  births  compared  to  60  deaths  per  1,000  live  births  in  male  children.  The  infant \nmortality  rates  are  higher  in  children  of  illiterate  women:  89  deaths  per  1,000  live  births  in \nilliterate  women  compared  to  49  in  children  of  mothers  who  had  more  than  10  years  of \nschooling.  The  overall  levels  of  complete  childhood  immunization  is  53%  in  Pakistan,  while \nPunjab  province  has  done  better  at  57%;  Balochistan  is  only  24%.  The  income-based \ndifferentials  in  childhood  immunization  are  significant.  In  Punjab  province,  the  coverage  rates \nare 50% less in the poorest quintile than the richest quintile.  \n \n11.  Malnutrition  is  a  major  contributor  to  infant  and  maternal  deaths.  Almost  40%  of  the \nburden of disease is related to communicable diseases, 12% to reproductive health problems, \nand  6%  to  nutritional  deficiencies.  Punjab  province  appears  to  be  in  an  early  stage  of  the \nepidemiological  transition,  where  preventable  or  readily  treatable  diseases  primarily  affecting \nyoung children and women account for a dominant share of morbidity and premature mortality. \n \n12. \nHealth  Service  Utilization.  Utilization  of  public  sector  health  services  is  low.  At  basic \nhealth units (BHUs), the average daily attendance is 22 patients including, weekly, two clients \nfor  family  planning  services  and  three  antenatal  checkups.  At  rural  health  centers,  there  are \nthree family planning clients and seven antenatal checkups per week in daily attendance on 69 \npatients. In tehsil (town) headquarters hospitals, the outpatient services are well attended, but \n\nHealth, Nutrition, and Population Sector \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n35\n\nutilization of beds and reproductive health services generally remains low. The low utilization of \nservices is because of inappropriate staff and skills mix, short working hours, absenteeism, and \nmany vacant posts in less affluent areas. \n \n13.  While 82% of children suffering from diarrhea are taken for consultation in Pakistan, in \nPunjab  province  it  is  86%.  However,  only  44%  of  children  with  diarrhea  are  given  oral \nrehydration  therapy  in  Punjab  province  compared  to  54%  in  Pakistan  as  a  whole.  In  urban \nareas,  only  18%  of  children  were  seen  in  government  hospitals/dispensaries,  while  in  rural \nareas it was 21%. Proximity to private health providers and lack of a government facility in the \nvillage  and  staff  helpfulness  were  two  of  the  main  reasons  for  children  with  diarrhea  seeking \nprivate providers.  \n \nOnly 40% of women in Punjab visit health facility for prenatal consultation compared to \n14. \n35% in Pakistan. Of them, 42% visited a government hospital or clinic. Only 31% of women in \nrural areas have prenatal consultations compared to 64% in urban areas of Punjab. Only 43% of \npregnant women receive one tetanus injection, compared to 38% in Pakistan. Here again, the \npercentage  of  rural  women  who  get  one  shot  of  tetanus  injection  is  37%  compared  to  63%  in \nurban  areas.  Only  20%  of  pregnant  women  deliver  in  institutions,  of  which  12%  in  private \nfacilities and 8% in government facilities. In rural areas, the percentage of institutional delivery is \nonly 13% compared to 44% in urban areas. The Pakistan Integrated Household Survey, 2001 \nfound  that  21%  of  facilities  do  not  have  female  staff,  64%  of  facilities  charge  a  general  fee, \nwhich  is  on  average  PRs61,  72%  of  facilities  have  electricity,  75%  have  oral  rehydration \ntherapy, 46% have contraceptives, 60% have vaccines, and 84% have anti-malarial drugs. \n \nHealth  Expenditures.  Households  spend  4.8%  of  their  total  consumption  expenditure \n15. \non  health,23  which  ranges  from  4.1%  in  the  lowest  income  quintile  to  5.6%  in  the  5th  income \nquintile.  The  relative  expenditures  on  health  as  a  share  of  GDP  in  Pakistan  and  surrounding \ncountries are given in the table below. The overall health expenditures as a share  of GDP in \nPakistan is slightly less than the overall average of South Asia. The public expenditure on health \nas a percentage share of overall expenditures on health is on the higher side of the region, and \nhigher  than  India.  However,  there  is  still  scope  for  increases  in  public  expenditures  on  health \ncompared  to  most  of  the  countries  in  the  region.  As  presented  in  Table  A2.5,  the  per  capita \nexpenditure  on  health  in  Pakistan  is  less  than  the  South  Asian  average,  which  also  indicates \ngreater need for investments in the health sector.  \n \n16. \nPolicy. The National Health Policy, 2001 classifies health sector investments as part of \npoverty  reduction.  The  main  thrust  of  the  health  policy  is  to  reduce  widespread  prevalence  of \ncommunicable  diseases,  address  inequalities  in  primary/secondary  health  care  services, \nimprove  management  and  professional  skills  of  the  district  health  systems,  promote  greater \ngender equality, bridge nutrition gaps in the target populations, reduce urban-rural imbalances \nin  the  health  sector,  introduce  a  framework  for  regulation  of  the  private  health  sector,  create \nmass  awareness  in  public  health  matters,  improve  regulation  of  the  drug  sector,  and  build \ncapacity  for  monitoring  health  policy.  The  Population  Policy  pf  Pakistan  (2002)  states  of \nPakistan  states  universal  access  to  safe  family  planning  methods  by  2010,  and  a  population \ngrowth rate of 1.3% and fertility to replacement level of 2.1 births by 2020. The Punjab Poverty \nReduction Strategy reinforces the need to achieve the objectives of the National Health Policy \nand the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \n \n\n                                                        \n23 Federal Bureau of Statistics, Statistics Division. 2002.

World Development Report. 2003. Washington, D.C.: World Bank. \n \n17. \nHuman  Resources.  The  provincial  and  district  departments  of  health  have  around \n130,692 jobs for various categories of health staff, of which approximately 20% of posts are not \nfilled.  The  category-wise  sanctioned  jobs  include  2,238  specialists  (of  which  1,135  jobs  are  in \nthe  hospitals  under  LGs),  9,609  general  duty  doctors  (about  49%  of  them  serve  in  LGs),  441 \ndental  surgeons,  6,136  nurses  (around  19%  with  LGs),  36,243  lady  health  workers  serving  in \nLGs,  and  69,208  paramedics  and  support  staff.  Female  doctors  constitute    around  22%  of \nsanctioned  posts  of  general  duty  doctors.  The  nurse-doctor  ratio  in  the  public  sector  is  1:2,  a \npattern  reflecting  inappropriate  staff  mix  and  skills  mix.  The  vacancy  rates  are  much  higher  in \nhard-to-reach, unattractive areas, especially for female health workers, because of the uniform \npay package, even under contract appointment. About 50% of contract doctors and 15\u201320% of \nparamedics leave the job because of unattractive wages. \n\n \n18. \nInfrastructure  and  Facilities.  The  public  sector  health  system  runs  on  four  tiers  of \nservices.  Lady  health  workers  provide  community-based  services  for  mother  and  child  health, \nfamily planning, immunization, and malaria. The primary care facilities include 2,489 BHUs and \n301 rural health centers (RHCs). A BHU, staffed by four professionals, provides preventive and \nlimited  curative  care.  An  RHC,  a  higher-level  primary  care  facility  with  20  beds,  is  staffed  by \nabout eight professionals including four medics. The 77 tehsil headquarters hospitals with 40\u2013\n60  beds  and  staffed  by  3\u20135  specialists  provide  inpatient  and  outpatient  care.  District \nheadquarters hospitals, with 80\u2013250 beds each, offer second-line referral care. The 17 teaching \nhospitals, located in major cities, provide specialized care and are attached to medical colleges \nfor undergraduate and postgraduate training.  \n\n \nPublic-Private Partnership. In the absence of a comprehensive policy for public-private \n19. \npartnerships,  the  Department  of  Health  (DOH)  has  been  implementing  three  partnership \nmodels.  Medical  colleges  and  their  attached  hospitals  have  been  given  autonomous  status \nthrough legal cover and rules of business. The concept of autonomy has yet to be extended to \ndistrict hospitals. The other examples include: (i) transfer of management of BHUs in Rahimyar \nKhan  District  to  a  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)  and  (ii) establishment  of  the  Health \nFoundation. The NGO partnership is in early stages of implementation. The Health Foundation, \nin  the  last  10  years,  has  failed  to  activate  its  financing  window  for  NGOs  to  expand  pro-poor \nhealth services.  \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n37\n\nDevolution. Punjab Local Government Ordinance, 2001 has devolved the following four \n20. \nfunctions  of  the  health  sector  to  the  district  governments:  basic  and  rural  health,  child  and \nwomen  health,  hospitals  up  to  district  level,  and  population  welfare.  The  latter,  however  a \nvertical program, continues to be federally funded and provincially managed. However, there is \na  functional  relationship  with  the  executive  district  officer  of  health  for  provision  of  family \nplanning services. The federal Ministry of Health also supports preventive programs through tied \ngrants,  and  the  system  is  well  streamlined.  The  management  staff  of  health  sectors  at  the \ndistrict level is generally well trained in public health and management.  \n \n21. \nThe  main  challenges  in  advancing  devolution  are  related  to:  control  by  the  provincial \ngovernment  on  staff  appointments  and  posting  and  transfers;  the  use  of  delegation  of  the \nfinancial powers rules of 1990; services and staff are not in line with the burden of disease; and \npoor internal monitoring controls by and committees set under the PLGO. A few public-private \npartnership initiatives are under implementation, which need to be evaluated and  systematically \nexpanded,  based  on  the  evaluation  outcomes.  The  district-wise  multiple  indicator  cluster \nsurveys  are  likely  to  be  available  by  the  end  of  2004.    The  surveys  result  would  guide  the \ndistricts for effecting improvements in planning and management of the health sector. Further, a \nformal or informal system for regulation of the private health sector is lacking.  \n \n22. \nFinancing. According to PRMP conditionality, PG was to provide an additional budget of \n20%  for  the  health  sector  in  2003/04  over  2002/03.  While  the  provincial  budget  shows  an \nincrease  of  68%  from  PRs4.2  billion  in  2002/03  to  PRs7  billion  in  2003/04,  the  district  health \nbudgets for 19 districts revealed a meager increase of 5.6%. LGs\u2019 budget for medicines shows \nmuch  interdistrict  variation,  ranging  from  7.9%  of  the  total  budget  in  Sheikhupura  to  32.9%  in \nJhang  district.  The  district  governments  implement  preventive  programs  and  fund  recurring \ncosts,  including  staff  salaries,  while  the  federal  Government  provides  an  annual  tied  grant  of \naround PRs1.45 billion outside Account IV. \n \nProgram  Investment.  There  are  major  programmatic  and  financing  gaps  in  the  public \n23. \nhealth  sector.  These  include  the  absence  of  reproductive  health  services  at  community  level \nthrough  trained  midwives,  except  for  a  small-scale  investment  built  into  the  ADB  funded \nWomen\u2019s Health Project;24 transforming the current service package into an essential pro-poor \npackage  of  services;  improving  the  staff  mix  and  skills  mix  backed  by  skills  development; \nexpanding public-private partnerships; and improving internal and external monitoring systems. \nThe  RHCs  and  tehsil  hospitals  should  provide  24-hour  emergency  services  to  improve  the \nsurvival  rates  of  the  unborn  and  the  mother  during  pregnancy.  To  ensure  high-quality  and \nreliable services, all the vacant positions (paras. 3, 12, 17) need to be filled quickly. Here, it may \nbe  desirable  to  try  facility-specific  contractual  appointment  of  the  health  staff,  with  incentives \nbuilt  in  for  remote  areas.  In  remote  areas,  innovative  models  such  as  the  contracting  out  of \nprimary health care services to reputed NGOs may be necessary. To ensure participation and \ncontribution  of  the  local  communities  in  running  the  health  facilities,  it  may  be  essential  to \nconstitute  health  facility  committees,  and  give  them  authority  to  raise  user  fees  and  use  the \nrevenues from them for improving the quality of health services. All these improvements would \nalso require consolidation and upgrading of the existing health infrastructure. \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                        \n24  ADB.  2003.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\n \n\nWater Supply and Sanitation Sector  \n\nC. \n \n24. \nCurrent Status. The major source of drinking water in Punjab is groundwater. However \nin  26  districts,  there  are  significant  pockets  of  water  scarcity  or  brackish  subsoil  water  where \nabout 10,000 villages are located. In eight districts and some pockets in other districts, subsoil \nwater is of good quality and easily accessible. About 94% of households have a water source \ninside  the  house,  of  which  76%  get  water  from  a  handmotor  pump  and  18%  from  the  public \nwater supply system. The remaining 6% use unsafe water from shallow wells, rivers, or canals \nthat are often located at a considerable distance, with the burden of fetching water largely falling \non women. Treatment of public water supplies is undertaken at only a few places and even that \nis on a limited scale; there is no treatment of water at the household level either, except in a few \nurban households. The infrastructure for water supply and sanitation (WSS) was developed in \nthe past without analyzing the feasibility and affordability of operation and maintenance (O&M) \ncosts.  As  a  result,  several  hundred  poorly  designed,  and  financially  and  institutionally \nunsustainable  rural  water  supply  schemes  have  been  abandoned.  The  experience  shows  that \nrural  communities  can  only  maintain  low-cost  water  supply  schemes  using  simple  technology, \nand when these schemes are planned and developed with their participation.  \n \n25. \nAround  68%  of  rural  and  7%  of  urban  households  have  no  toilet  facility.  The  lack  of \naccess  by  the  poor  to  a  flush  latrine  is  a  major  public  health  concern  as  it  contributes  to  the \nspread of waterborne and food-borne diseases. Over 42% of households are not connected to a \ndrainage  system,  and  nearly  the  same  percentage  of  households  are  connected  to  an  open \ndrain.  The  underground  or  covered  drainage  system  is  only  available  to  38%  of  urban \nhouseholds.  The  position  of  garbage  disposal  is  even  worse.  Only  6%  of  all  households  have \naccess to a municipal garbage collection system, representing 19% of urban households. About \n12% of households have established a \u201cprivate\u201d system for garbage collection. \n \n26. \nKey  Issues.  Prior  to  devolution,  the  Public  Health  Engineering  Department  (PHED)  in \nrural areas and towns, and the water and sanitation agencies (WASAs) in cities with 5 million-\nplus  populations  were  the  main  agencies  responsible  for  planning  and  implementing  all \nprovincial  government-financed  major  investment  projects.  In  addition,  the  municipalities \nimplemented  minor  investments  largely  from  their  own  resources.  Under  the  PLGO,  all \nmunicipal functions, including WSS, were assigned to the TMA, along with staff devolved from \nthe  Local  Government  and  Rural  Development  (LG&RD)  Department,  Health  and  Population \nPolicy  Department,  and  PHED.  While  PHED  transferred  its  field  staff  to  the  TMAs,  it  has \ncontinued  its  links  with  the  sector  through  retaining  staff  in  four  regional  units  and  at  the \nprovincial  level,  and  through  assigning  to  itself  powers  of  approval  of  WSS  projects  costing \nmore than PRs5 million. The PHED is also implementing an ADB-financed WSS project through \nwhich it is exercising responsibilities devolved to the TMAs under the PLGO.  \n \nThe  WSS  system  faces  three  major  challenges.  The  first  concerns  institutional  and \n27. \norganizational  aspects  ranging  from  those  inherited  by  TMAs  from  their  predecessors\u2014weak \nsystem  of  operating  practices,  both \nfrom \nresponsibilities assigned for the first-time, exclusive mandate for integrated planning and service \ndelivery  in  both  rural  and  urban  areas  within  their  jurisdiction.  This  means  that  participatory \nplanning  systems  have  to  be  developed;  systems  and  procedures  for  O&M  and  procurement \nmodernized;  billing,  recovery,  cost  control,  and  monitoring  strengthened;  and  transparent, \ncustomer-responsive management introduced.  \n \n28. \nThe second challenge relates to the unfinished agenda for devolution. The main issues \npertain  to  (i) granting  administrative  powers  for  approval  and  technical  sanction  above \n\ntechnical  and  operational\u2014to \n\nthose  arising \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n39\n\nPRs5 million;  (ii) creating  a  municipal  service  structure;  (iii) instituting  a  conditional  and \nperformance  grants  system \nto  promote  provincial  policy  objectives  and  reward  TMA \nmanagement performance; (iv) delineating clear lines of control between province and TMA and \nrelations among LGs; (v) strengthening policy direction at the provincial level (rather than control \nof implementation and decision making); and (vi) effectively offsetting the threat of reassumption \nof powers by agencies from which they were devolved to the TMA (particularly PHED). \n \n29. \nThe third challenge relates to strategic direction: (i) lack of adequate focus on sanitation \n(hygiene awareness, excreta disposal, wastewater disposal including its treatment, solid waste \ncollection  and  sanitary  disposal);  (ii) need  for  greater  attention  to  monitoring  the  quality  of \ndrinking  water,  e.g.,  hand-pumps  and  municipal  systems,  and  remedial  measures  for  their \nprotection;  (iii) requirement  for  improved  and  sustainable  O&M  of  existing  and  new  WSS \ninvestments; and (iv) the overarching need for increasing access to WSS coverage for a large, \nunserviced segment of society. \n  \n30. \nFinancing. TMAs in Punjab receive about PRs8 billion in federal and provincial transfers \nbesides  their  own  revenue  sources.  In  the  period  2004\u20132009,  this  is  being  supplemented  by \ninvestments  in  the  WSS  sector  by  (i) the  WASAs  in  the  5 million-plus  cities;  (ii) small-scale \nschemes  by  union  administrations  funded  by  the  district  governments  (currently  estimated  at \nabout  PRs50 million  annually),  and  others  implemented  with  LG  funds  under  public-private \npartnership  arrangements  through  community  citizen  boards  (CCBs);  (iii) grants  from  the \nprovincial government; and (iv) two ADB-assisted projects ($60 million in the Punjab Community \nWater Supply and Sanitation Sector Project and $86 million in the Southern Punjab Basic Urban \nServices Project, excluding implementation-related costs). \n \n31. \nProgram  Policy  and  Plans.  PG  is  following  a  uniform  policy  framework  in  rural  WSS \nschemes to promote community ownership through community-based organizations and water \nuser committees and management of operations and maintenance costs. PG intends to transfer \nall  functions  related  to  WSS  to  TMAs  in  accordance  with  the  PLGO,  except  in  city  districts \nwhere  these  functions  are  with  the  city  district  government.  The  provincial  government\u2019s \nfunctions  will  be  clearly  delineated  in  terms  of  policy  design,  technical  capacity  building  of \nTMAs, and overall monitoring. Enhancing capacity building of TMAs is planned through various \ninitiatives,  including  the  ADB-assisted  programs,  Decentralization  Support  Program,  and  two \nWSS  projects.  PG  is  also  considering  the  viability  of  completing  those  schemes  that  were \nincomplete and abandoned by PHED after devolution, and handing them over to  communities \nafter completion. \n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable A2.6: Key Social Sector Indicators and Targets, Punjab Province \n\nIndicator \n\nHealth Sector \n\nInfant mortality rate per 1,000 live births \nChild mortality rate per 1,000 live births \nChildren <5 year under weight for age (%) \nChildren fully immunized, 12\u201323 months (%) \nMaternal mortality ratio per 1,000 live births \nTotal fertility rate \nDelivery by trained birth attendant (%) \nContraceptive prevalence rate (%) \n\nEducation Sector \nLiteracy rate 10 years and above (%) \nPopulation 10 years and above who have \ncompleted primary education or higher(%) \nGross enrollment rate at primary level (%)\u2014\nmale \nGross enrollment rate at primary level (%)\u2014\nfemale \nNet enrollment rate at primary level (%)\u2014\nmale \nNet enrollment rate at primary level (%)\u2014\nfemale \nGross enrollment rate at middle level (%)\u2014\nmale \nGross enrollment rate at middle level (%)\u2014\nfemale \nGross enrollment rate at secondary level \n(%)\u2014male \nGross enrollment rate at secondary level \n(%)\u2014female \n\nWater Supply and Sanitation  \n\nSource \n\nPIHS \nPRHFPS \nNHSP \nPIHS \nEstimates \nPRHFPS \nPIHS \nPRHFPS \n\nPIHS \nPIHS \n\nPIHS \n\nPIHS \n\nPIHS \n\nPIHS \n\nPIHS \n\nPIHS \n\nPIHS \n\nPIHS \n\n \nPIHS \nPIHS \nPIHS \n\n1995\u2013\n1996 \n\n2001\u2013\n2002 \n\n2007\u2013\n2008 \n\n2014\u2013\n2015  \n\n101.00 \n111.00 \n40.00 \n47.00 \n350.00 \n4.66 \n12.00 \n23.90 \n\n37.00 \n54.00 \n\n82.00 \n103.00 \n38.00 \n57.00 \n300.00 \n4.20 \n24.00 \n27.60 \n\n40.00 \n59.00 \n\n65.00 \n75.00 \n30.00 \n80.00 \n250.00 \n4.00 \n40.00 \n50.00 \n\n60.00 \n70.00 \n\n40.00 \n50.00 \n25.00 \n85.00 \n150.00 \n3.60 \n60.00 \n60.00 \n\n80.00 \n80.00 \n\n85.00 \n\n84.00 \n\n100.00 \n\n105.00 \n\n70.00 \n\n69.00 \n\n95.00 \n\n105.00 \n\n50.00 \n\n47.00 \n\n70.00 \n\n90.00 \n\n39.00 \n\n43.00 \n\n70.00 \n\n90.00 \n\n52.00 \n\n46.00 \n\n70.00 \n\n80.00 \n\n31.00 \n\n43.00 \n\n65.00 \n\n80.00 \n\n50.00 \n\n55.00 \n\n60.00 \n\n75.00 \n\n28.00 \n\n34.00 \n\n40.00 \n\n70.00 \n\nAccess to piped water (% rural) \nAccess to hand/motor pump (% rural) \nAccess to flush toilet (% rural) \nNHPS = National Health and Population Study, PIHS = Pakistan Integrated Household Survey, PRHPS = Pakistan \nReproductive Health and Family Planning Survey. \nNote: Figures for 2007/08 and 2014/15 are projections by the design team. \nSources:  Pakistan  Integrated  Household  Survey  2001/02;  National  Nutrition  Survey  of  Pakistan  2001/02;  National \nHealth Survey of Pakistan 1990\u20131994; Pakistan Reproductive Health and Family Planning Survey 2000/01. \n\n \n9.00 \n84.00 \n20.00 \n\n \n6.00 \n88.00 \n31.00 \n\n \n15.00 \n80.00 \n45.00 \n\n \n25.00 \n70.00 \n60.00 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nPDSSPa \n1.

By  themselves,  the  funds  are  neither  sufficient  to  finance  any  specific  gaps  in \nthe social sectors, nor are they meant to act as investments funds alone. The definitions of the \nscope of use of these funds, as well as the institutional mechanisms through which they are to \nbe used by the local governments, thus assume paramount importance. Within the overarching \nframework of the Program and generally following the principle of finance following function, the \nfunds would be proposed for use in a manner that supports and leads to the achievement of the \nprogram  goals  and  objectives  and  the  specific  actions  outlined  in  the  policy  matrix  for  the \nProgram.  While  aiming  to  provide  optimal  flexibility  to  the  LGs  to  enable  efficient  choices  for \ninvestments aimed at improving social services, the proposed use of funds would at the same \ntime adopt mechanisms that enable the Punjab Government (PG) to ensure that the processes \nof targeted, accountable, and participatory sector planning at the LG level are strengthened and \nthe  investments  are  pro-poor  and  gender-sensitive.  The  distribution  of  funds  proposed  would \nprovide for clear, predictable, and transparent funding to LGs. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  counterpart  funds  generated  by  the  Program  will  be  used  to  finance  a  package  of \npolicy reforms. The distribution of program funds need to be based on a set of clear, objective, \nand  relevant  criteria  that  take  into  account  the  sector  focus  of  the  Program  and  the  specific \nelements  of  the  policy  matrix,  so  as  to  ensure  that  there  is  a  fit  between  the  funding  and  the \npolicy actions in a manner that leads to the achievement of the program objectives. In arriving at \nthese distribution criteria, a number of aspects need to be considered, including the following. \n \n3. \nSector  Distribution.  Given  the  availability  of  funds  in  the  social  sectors  from  both  the \nGovernment\u2019s own resources, as well as from external assistance agencies, and also in view of \nthe priorities of the government of Punjab and financing gaps identified, it is proposed that the \nprogram funds be distributed among the health, education, and water and sanitation sectors in \nthe ratio of 65:17:18. The district governments (DGs) will receive 82% of all program funds for \nhealth and education and the tehsil (town) municipal administrations (TMAs) will receive 18%. \n \n4. \nFund  for  Promoting  Public-Private  Partnerships  (PPPs).  In  order  to  promote  PPPs \nfor  improving  social  services  in  terms  of  access,  delivery  or  monitoring,  it  is  proposed  to \napportion  some  program  funds  to  be  used  as  a  fund  for  PPPs.  In  line  with  the  Punjab  Local \nGovernment Ordinance 2001 (PLGO 2001), which calls for allocating 25% of the total budget for \nengagement  with  citizen  community  boards  (CCBs),  it  is  proposed  that  the  DGs  and  program \nTMAs also apportion 25% of funds for purposes of PPPs. However, the mechanism for use of \nthese funds will differ from that in the PLGO 2001 in that the allocations by the LGs will not be \nconditional  upon  equity  financing  from  partners  from  the  private  sector  in  the  PPP.  This  PPP \nfund  will  be  available  for  use  by  all  community-based  organizations  (CBOs),  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), CCBs, school councils (SCs), patient welfare associations (PWAs), and \nprivate  sector  firms,  subject  to  their  meeting  the  basic  eligibility  criteria  for  participation,  to  be \ndeveloped under the Program. \n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n \n\n \n\nTargeting.  In  order  to  ensure  that  the  program  funds  are  targeted  toward  pro-poor, \n5. \ngender-sensitive  investments,  DGs  and  program  TMAs  would  be  encouraged,  during  the \nprocess of developing the annual sector plans and the 3-year rolling sector plans, to prioritize \nexpenditures that target women and poor segments of the population. As the conditional grant \nsystem evolves into a more sophisticated policy transmittal instrument from the second year of \nthe  Program  onwards,  targeting  would  be  achieved  by  including  incentives  for  targeting  in  the \ndistribution  formula  itself  and/or  as  part  of  the  eligibility  and  access  conditions  in  the \nmemorandum  of  understanding  (MOU)  between  the  PG  and  participating  LGs  for  conditional \ngrants.  \n \n6. \nPerformance  Incentives.  There  is  also  a  need  to  establish  some  performance \nincentives for the LGs, so as to move them away from pure input-based criteria for distribution \nand toward more output- and outcome-based criteria, so that LGs are rewarded for efforts and \nresults to improve social services.  \n \nC. \n\nDistribution Formula \n\nInstitutional Mechanism  \n\n7. \nIt is proposed that the formula for distribution of program funds be clear, objective, and \nrelevant to the program objectives. The formula should follow needs-based distribution criteria \nthat  also  contain  elements  of  performance-based  incentives.  Given  that  the  Punjab  Devolved \nSocial Services Program (PDSSP) focuses on poor and deprived locations, it is proposed that \nfor the first tranche release, 70% of the funds be based on population and 30% on the Social \nPolicy Development Center deprivation index to focus more on the 15 most deprived districts. \nThe second tranche release would be determined by the provincial finance commission (PFC), \nwhich will also introduce performance criteria as discussed in para. 6 above. \n \nD. \n \nUnder  the  PLGO,  PFCs  were  established  with  a  view  to  providing  an  institutional \n8. \narrangement for fiscal transfers from provinces to LGs. PDSSP proposes to use the PFC as the \ninstitutional  mechanism  to  transfer  funds  under  the  Program.  These  transfers  would  be  in  the \nshape of conditional grants that would provide for clear, transparent, and predictable shares of \nthe LGs based on a PFC-approved formula. The PFC would also approve the eligibility criteria, \nthe access conditions, and the performance measurement indicators for the conditional grants \nand  would  in  conjunction  with  the  program  steering  committee  (PSC)  for  PDSSP,  monitor  the \nuse of funds periodically. Upon approval of the distribution formula, the PFC would make public \nthe annual allocations of each DG and program TMA, well before the new financial year begins, \nso as to allow the LGs to have a clear indication of the funds that would be available\u2014in the first \nyear  of  the  Program\u2014to  them  outside  the  PFC  award  and  other  transfers  from  PG,  as  a \nsupplementary grant. \n \nE. \n \nThe  share  of  the  DGs  and  program  TMAs,  as  determined  through  the  PFC-approved \n9. \ndistribution  formula  will  flow  from  the  provincial  government  to  the  district  fund  and  the  TMA \nfund directly from Account IV within 30 days of the eligible LGs meeting the access conditions \nfor the conditional grants. These access conditions would include the LGs signing an MOU with \nPG,  agreeing  to  a  set  of  conditions  under  which  the  funds  can  be  used,  such  as  minimum \nstandards  of  performance,  improving  participation  in  decision  making,  agreeing  to  use \nconditional grants within defined scope of activities, and meeting reporting requirements for the \nconditional grants.  \n\nTransfer of Funds \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n 55\n\nUse of Funds \n\nAccountability \n\n \nF. \n \n10. \nThe  conditional  grant  mechanism  developed  for  the  PDSSP  funds  aims  to  provide \noptimal  levels  of  flexibility  to  LGs  in  use  of  funds.  This  is  achieved  by  defining  the  scope  of \nactivities  and  investments  commensurate  with  the  policy  actions  outlined  under  the  Program \nthrough a positive and a negative list. An attempt has been made to make the positive list least \nprescriptive in nature, support the autonomous status of the LGs, and strengthen their ability to \nmake investment choices in a manner that fits within the overall program framework. Likewise, \nthe negative list is a lean list aiming to safeguard accountable and responsible use of funds by \nthe  LGs.  Both  the  positive  and  negative  lists  will  be  subject  to  review  every  year  with  the \nobjective of facilitating and providing incentives to LGs to assume more ownership and control \nof planning, budgeting, and monitoring processes to improve social services.  \n \nG. \n \nThe  flexibility  in  use  of  funds  that  is  being  proposed  under  PDSSP  calls  for  sufficient \n11. \nsafeguards  against  misuse  of  funds  and  abuse  of  the  flexible  approach.  These  safeguards \nwould include: (i) establishing a tracking and auditing and reporting of conditional grants going \nto  LGs;  (ii)  increased  participatory  planning  and  monitoring  at  the  LG  level;  (iii)  improved \nperformance  of  the  sector  monitoring  committees;  (iv)  setting  of  performance  standards, \nbenchmarks,  and  establishing  citizen  charters;  and  (v)  taking  effective  measures  to  ensure \ntransparency and improve public information on social services. \n \nH. \n \n12. \nDespite  the  mechanisms  being  put  in  place  to  support  and  encourage  LGs  to  improve \nperformance in the delivery of social services, there is always the risk that some LGs may not \nbe able to meet the conditions set under the Program. A disincentive for LGs not meeting the \nrequirements is proposed to be built in the form of withholding further releases to such LGs in \nthe year that follows. The funds that thus become available are proposed to be pooled into the \nPunjab Development Fund, from where they can be accessed by other, better performing LGs \nas  performance  grants.  The  criteria  for  accessing  these  would  be  determined  by  the  program \nsteering  committee  and  approved  by  the  PFC.  However,  mechanisms  will  be  put  in  place  to \nprovide technical assistance (TA) to districts that are lagging behind due to capacity problems. \n \nI. \n \n13. \nTo provide sustenance to this initiative of supporting the PG to improve its fiscal space \nand  increase  investments  in  the  social  sectors,  PG  will  need  to  (i)  refine  the  medium-term \nbudgetary  framework  based  on  a  realistic  estimate  of  the  sources  and  generation  of  financial \nresources and (ii) demonstrate a level of political commitment and provide adequate assurances \non  the  policy  actions  required  to  enable  the  program  funds  to  have  a  meaningful  impact  on \nsocial services by institutionalizing processes for accountable use of these funds.  \n \nPDSSP also has a TA component for building the capacity of the LGs in improving social \n14. \nservices.  This  component  would,  in  conjunction  with  the  ongoing  work  of  a  number  of  other \ninitiatives  such  as  the  Punjab  Resource  Management  Program,  Decentralization  Support \nProgram, and the Punjab Education Sector Reform Program, help improve systems, processes, \nand monitoring and evaluation at the LG level specifically for the social sectors. \n\nDisincentives for Deviant Behavior \n\nSustainability \n\n\f56\n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n\nSOCIAL SECTOR FINANCING IN PUNJAB \n\n \n \n1. \nPakistan  and  Punjab  Economy.  Punjab  plays  an  important  role  in  the  economy  of \nPakistan.  Its  population  is  estimated  at  82  million,  approximately  56%  of  the  Pakistan\u2019s  total \npopulation. Punjab plays a leading role in agricultural production in Pakistan, contributing about \n68%  to  the  annual  food  grain  production.  Since  23%  of  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  of \nPakistan is from the agriculture sector, and the provincial GDP accounts for 57% of the national \nGDP,1 any changes in the productivity in Punjab will have a substantial impact on GDP growth. \nThus, given Punjab\u2019s population size and the extent of economic activity it generates, Punjab's \ndevelopment performance has a significant impact on the economy of Pakistan as a whole. Its \nsocial indicators mirror overall country indicators, with some marginally better and some worse.  \n \nGovernment Financial Sources. As shown in Table A7.1, the total financial resources \n2. \nof the Punjab Government (PG) grew at an average annual rate of 11.0% between FY2000/01, \nand  was  PRs155.6  billion  in  FY2003/04.  The  financial  resources  were  sourced  from  revenue \nreceipts  and  development  grants.  While  development  grants  have  been  declining,  revenue \nreceipts,  on  the  other  hand,  have  increased.  Revenue  receipts  grew  at  an  average  annual \ngrowth  rate  of  12.5%.  The  revenue  receipts  consist  of  approximately  80%  federal  transfers \n(taxes  and  nontax  transfers),  and  20%  provincial  revenue  receipts.  Development  grants  have \ndeclined substantially in the last 5 fiscal years, from PRs4 billion in FY2000/01 to PRs89 million \nin FY2003/04. \n \n3. \nThe budget estimate for FY2004/05 for revenue receipts was forecast at PR180.0 billion \nin  the  Medium-Term  Budgetary  Framework  (MTBF),  increasing  by  15.7%  from  the  revised \nbudget of the previous year. Higher growth was forecast on the assumption that (i) the amount \nof  the  federal  transfer  would  increase  as  a  result  of  improved  revenue  collection  of  federal \ntaxes,  (ii)  federal  Government  would  provide  provincial  governments  with  financial  support  for \nmeeting  the  expenditure  on  account  of  a  15%  pay  increase  announced  in  the  federal  budget, \nand (iii) PG would be able to at least maintain the previous year\u2019s provincial revenue collection \nperformance. \n \nGovernment Budget. The total budget increased at an annual average growth rate of \n4. \n13.8%  between  FY2000/01  and  FY2003/04,  and  was  PRs170.4  billion  in  FY2003/04.  Three-\nquarters of the total budget are for revenue expenditures and the remainder for the development \nbudget. The revenue expenditure budget increased at an average annual growth rate of 9.9% \nbetween FY2000/01 and FY2003/04 and was PRs130.9 billion in FY2003/04. Until FY2001/02, \nmore than a third of the revenue expenditure budget was allocated to social services. Since the \nadministrative devolution of PG, beginning in FY2002/03, about half of the revenue expenditure \nbudget has been allocated to grants for local governments. The level of the revenue expenditure \nbudget has never exceeded the revenue receipts between FY2001/02 and FY2003/04, and the \nrevenue surplus has increased over the last 4 fiscal years. The increase was partly a result of a \nreduction in debt servicing,2 from PRs15.7 billion (17.4% of revenue expenditure) in FY2000/01 \nto PRs14.3 billion (8.4% of revenue expenditure) in FY2003/04. The development expenditure \nbudget,  on  the  other  hand,  has  also  increased  at  an  average  annual  growth  rate  of  32.4% \nbetween FY2000/01 and FY2003/04 and was PRs39.4 billion in FY2003/04. \n\n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2004.

Social  services  were  one  of  the  priority  sectors  in  the  2004/05 \n6. \nbudget.  Majority  of  the  social  sectors  budget  (education,  health,  and  water  supply  and \nsanitation)  was  allocated  to  local  governments.  As  shown  in  Table  A7.2,  the  social  sector \nbudget grew substantially by 31.1% in FY2004/05, which is higher than the growth rate of the \ntotal  PG  budget  of  10.8%.  The  total  social  sector  budget  is  estimated  at  PRs74.9  billion, \ncomprising  39.7%  of  PG\u2019s  total  budget.  For  FY2004/05,  the  majority  of  the  social  services \nbudget  was  allocated  to  local  governments,  while  34.3%  was  allocated  to  the  provincial \ngovernment and 65.7% to the local governments. \n \n7. \nThe  education  sector  continued  to  be  the  priority  sector  in  the  social  sectors,  but  the \nFY2004/05  budget  placed  a  strong  emphasis  on  health  sector  development.  Within  the  social \nsectors,  the  education  sector  was  allocated  the  largest  proportion  of  the  budget  at  68.9%, \nfollowed  by  the  health  sector  at  23.8%,  and  the  WSS  sector  at  7.4%  in  FY2004/05.  Both \nrevenue  expenditure  and  development  expenditure  budgets  for  education,  health,  and  WSS \nincreased by 22.8%, 29.1%, and 311.2%, respectively in FY2004/05. The increase derives from \na  substantial  increase  in  the  development  budget  for  health  and  WSS  sectors  in  FY2004/05, \nreflecting PG\u2019s medium-term policy. \n \n\nTable A7.2: Social Sector Budget, FY2001\u2013FY2004 \n(PRs million) \n\n \n\n \n\nBudget  \n( PRs million) \n \n2003/04 \nRE \n\n2002/03 \nRE \n\nGrowth  \n(%)  \n\n2004/05 \nBE \n\n2003/04 \nRE \n\n2004/05 \nBE \n\nItem \nA.

As  reflected  in  TableA7.3,  PG  is  committed  to  enhancing  pro-poor  spending \nunder MTBF, with a particular focus on social sectors from FY2004/5. MTBF marked a shift from \n\n\fAppendix 7       59  \n\nan annual to a medium-term budgeting process and provides the estimated budget allocation for \nthe next 3 fiscal years. This supports the medium term strategies in Punjab\u2019s Vision 2020 and \nPunjab\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  and  recognizes  the  need  to  guarantee  the  availability  of \nresources on a medium- to long-term basis to combat poverty.  \n \n\nTable A7.3: Social Sector Budget under MTBF \n(PRs million) \n\n \n \n\nItem \nA.

Lahore. \n \n9. \nSocial  Sector  Budget  in  MTBF.  MTBF  identified  education,  health,  and  WSS  sectors \nas  the  major  critical  sectors,  among  others,  in  the  next  3  fiscal  years.  MTBF  thus  reflects  a \nsubstantially  higher  social  sector  budget  in  2004/05  and  maintains  the  increased  budget  level \nfor the following 3 fiscal years. The total of the revenue and development expenditure budgets \nin FY2004/05 for education, health and WSS sectors increased by 22.8%, 29.1%, and 311.2%, \nrespectively,  and  the  growth  rate  would  be  maintained  at  11%  annually  thereafter.  During  the \nprogram  implementation  period,  as  a  result  of  MTBF,  the  revenue  expenditure  budget  of  the \nsocial sectors will increase by PRs27.2 billion ($477 million) and the development expenditure \nbudget by PRs7.4 billion ($130 million). \n \n10. \nFinancing  Gap  in  MTBF.  Table  A7.4  shows  that  the  proposed  expenditures  under \nMTBF is greater than the forecast revenue receipts for the next 3 fiscal years, thus producing a \nfinancing  gap.  Under  MTBF,  PG  estimates  that  revenue  receipts  will  grow  by  18.4%  in \n\n\f60\n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n\nFY2005/06  and  by  12.9%  in  FY2006/07  and  FY2007/08;  revenue  expenditures  will  grow  at  a \nslower  pace,  by  18.1%  in  FY2005/06,  and  12.8%  in  FY2006/07  and  FY2007/08.  The  slower \ngrowth is mainly due to the gradual reduction in debt servicing. As a result, the revenue surplus \nis expected to grow by 22.6% in the FY2005/06 and 14.4% in FY2006/07 and FY2007/08. This \nwill  allow  PG  to  allocate  more  resources  to  the  development  expenditure  budget,  which  will \ngrow  faster  than  revenue  receipts,  20.2%  in  FY2005/06  and  13.6%  in  FY2006/07  and \nFY2007/08. PG would be able to increase the development expenditure by creating fiscal space \nthrough  debt  service  reduction.  Nevertheless,  the  growing  revenue  surplus  alone  is  not \nsufficient  to  finance  the  development  expenditure  budget  necessary  to  implement  the  poverty \nreduction strategy of PG. Consequently, there is a financing gap of PRs8.7 billion ($153 million) \nin  FY2004/5,  PRs9.6  billion  ($169  million)  in  FY2005/06,  PRs10.6  billion  ($186  million)  in \nFY2006/07,  and  PRs11.6  billion  ($204  million)  in  FY2007/08  as  shown  in  Table  A7.3.  Since \nabout  less  than  a  third  of  the  development  expenditure  budget  is  generally  allocated  to  social \nsectors,  the  financing  gap  in  the  social  sectors  during  the  implementation  of  the  proposed \nProgram is estimated at, at least, PRs9.6 billion ($169 million). \n \n\nTable A7.4: Punjab Medium Term Budgetary Framework, FY2004/05\u2013FY2007/08 \n(PRs million) \n\n \n\nItem \n \n\n2004/05  2005/06  2006/07  2007/08 \n\nBE \n \n\nMTBF \n \n\nMTBF \n \n\nMTBF \n \n\nAnnual Growth Rate \n(%) \n2005/06  2006/07  2007/08 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nA.

Manila (TA 4183).  \n \n \n\n11. \nProposed  Program  and  MTBF.  The  proposed  Program  was  designed  in  line  with \nMTBF and the poverty reduction strategy, and will provide budget support to the financing gap \n\n\fAppendix 7       61  \n\nthe  rehabilitation  cost  of  an  existing  school  and  other  expenses \n\nin  the  social  sectors.  The  funding  requirement  for  implementing  policy  actions  under  the \nproposed Program would be about equal to the financing gap, as the policy actions under the \nproposed Program are a translation of the planned activities under MTBF. An attempt was made \nto estimate the funding requirement, by calculating the approximate cost of achieving the major \ntarget indicators in the program framework. \n \n12. \nIn the education sector, it is assumed that female gross enrollment rates in primary and \nmiddle  schools  will  improve  from  70%  to  75%  and  from  43%  to  50%,  respectively,  during  the \nprogram period, an increase of approximately 258,000 pupils. Since 69% of female pupils are in \npublic  schools,  PG  requires  financing  for  additional  178,000  pupils  and  1,723  new  schools. \nAssuming that the per capita annual recurrent cost is $47, the construction cost of a school is \n$20,000,  and \nfor \noperationalizing school councils are $1,800, the 3-year total cost would be about $58.8 million. \n \n13. \nIn the health sector, it is assumed that the proportion of lowest income quintile accessing \nservices  will  increase  by  20%  from  the  base  year.  There  are  17  million  people  in  the  lowest \nquintile, and the current access rate is 46%. In order to increase the access rate by 20% during \nthe  program  period,  PG  would  have  to  finance  the  cost  of  an  additional  2  million  people \ngradually  accessing  health  services  in  3  years.  Since  the  cost  of  essential  health  services  is \nestimated at $17 per person per year, the 3-year total cost would be $82.8 million. Furthermore, \nthe  number  of  health  centers  and  their  staff  would  have  to  increase  to  deliver  the  essential \nhealth services and improve access; this would cost about $8.5 million in 3 years. The total fund \nrequirement in the health sector in 3 years would be $91.2 million. \n \nIn the WSS sector, it is assumed that access to water sources will improve from 94% to \n14. \n96%. This requires the supply of safe water to an additional 1.5 million people. Assuming that \nimprovement in sanitation will take place along with the supply of safe water, the cost of water \nsupply and sanitation is estimated at $35 per person, and the 3-year total cost would be $51.9 \nmillion.  \n \n15. \nThe total cost of implementing policies and facilitation is estimated at $201.9 million and \nis  summarized  in  Table  A7.5.

The  following \nparagraphs explain these elements.  \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n  \n\n(iv) \n\nBenchmarking. A major area to be addressed by the program support unit to be \nestablished  by  loan  negotiations  is  to  develop  a  set  of  monitoring  benchmarks \nagainst which the progress of the Program will be assessed. These benchmarks \nlargely  include  indicators  provided  in  the  program  framework  and  required \ninformation  as  per  the  policy  matrix.  The  information  for  these  indicators  come \nfrom different sources, including regular surveys such as the Pakistan Integrated \nHousehold  Survey  (carried  out  by  the  Government  of  Pakistan)  and  follow-on \nsurveys  such  as  (Multiple  Indicator  Cluster  Survey)  to  be  supported  by  the \nProgram.  A  major  emphasis  will  be  to  establish  benchmark  for  financial \nallocations  to  the  social  sectors  and  percentage  of  expenditures  achieved  each \nyear  at  the  provincial  and  local  government  levels.  Benchmarks  will  also  be \nestablished for indicators relating to the Millennium Development Goals in order \nto indicate the effort Punjab Government would have to exert to ensure meeting \ninterim targets in order to be on track to meet the targets by 2015. A draft set of \nbenchmarks for the education, health, and water supply and sanitation sectors is \nattached  with  Appendix  2  but  this  will  be  modified  to  link  more  closely  with  the \nprogram framework (Appendix 1) and policy matrix (Appendix 4). \n\nManagement Information Systems. Other major sources of information for the \neducation and health sectors are the Punjab education management information \nsystem (PEMIS) and the health sector management information system (HMIS). \nWhile the PEMIS is more developed and reliable than the HMIS, the intention is \nto  draw  information  on  key  indicators  from  these  systems,  and  to  provide \ntargeted  support  to  improve  these  systems  in  order  to  enhance  the  use, \nreliability,  and  timeliness  of  information  generated  by  these  systems.  Key  users \nof the information will be identified and reports will be improved accordingly. \n\nMonitoring Framework. A major emphasis of PDSSP is to improve the overall \nmonitoring  capacity  of  the  provincial  line  departments  as  well  as  the  LGs.  The \npolicy  reforms  include  two  policy  actions  to  support  improved  monitoring:  (a) \nstrengthening  social  sector  monitoring  systems  including  the  management \ninformation  systems  and  enhanced  disclosure  on  social  services;  and  (b) \nstrengthening  the  capacity  of  local  council  monitoring  committees  in  order  to \nensure that monitoring functions are institutionalized in line with the provisions of \nthe Punjab Local Government Ordinance (PLGO). This process will also support \nthe  local  government  council,  which  is  the  lead  agency  for  facilitating  overall \nmonitoring  functions  of  the  LGs.  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  component \nincludes  provisions  to  support  provincial  line  departments  and  LGs  to  develop \nand strengthen their monitoring mechanisms and capacities. \n\n Third  Party  Evaluation.  The  TA  component  of  the  Punjab  Devolved  Social \nServices Program (PDSSP) includes provision to conduct third party evaluations \n(TPEs)  to  assess  progress  directly  associated  with  the  Program  and  TA.  The \nTPEs  will  focus  on  inputs,  process,  outputs,  and  outcome  indicators  to  be \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n65\n\nfinalized  by  program  effectiveness,  and  will  determine  absolute  and  relative \nimprovements made over time. The TPEs will include formative and summative \nevaluations. The Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) covering key indicators \nin the social sectors will be repeated to review the progress made under PDSSP.  \n\nLinkages. The PPMES will establish linkages with other relevant programs, such \nas  the  Punjab  Resource  Management  Program,  Decentralization  Support \nProgram, and Punjab Education Sector Reform Program, to ensure consistency \nand  synergy,  as  these  programs  are  also  supporting  the  monitoring  and \nevaluation (M&E) system. \n\n \n2. \nIn  order  to  institutionalize  M&E  capacity  as  envisaged  under  the  PLGO,  monitoring \nspecialists  are  planned  at  the  provincial  and  LG  levels  under  the  TA  component.  Tentative \nterms of reference are provided below:  \n \n\n \n(v) \n\n(i) \n\nMonitoring and evaluation specialist at provincial level (30 person-months). \nThe consultant will (a) take a lead role for M&E in the program support unit, (b) \ncoordinate with M&E sections of the provincial line department and LGs through \ndistrict-level  monitoring  expert  in  the  areas  of  M&E,  (c)  coordinate  with \nmanagement  information  specialist  (MIS)  specialist  for  developing  a  M&E \nframework  to  effectively  monitor  DSSP  activities  and  track  progress  against  the \nassurances and milestones contained in the policy matrix and annual plans, (d) \nassist the program support unit in preparing progress reports on time, (e) support \nM&E  experts  at  district  level  in  developing  the  capacity  of  the  LG  staff  and \ncouncil monitoring committees, and (f) undertake periodic review of M&E reports \nprepared by provincial line departments and provide ongoing assistance. \n\nMonitoring  and  evaluation  expert  at  district  level  (30  person-months).  The \nconsultant  will  (a)  support  and  coordinate  monitoring  activities  at  LG  level;  (b) \ncoordinate  with  provincial-level  M&E  specialist  and  seek  guidance \nfor \nstreamlining  M&E  activities  at  LG  level;  (c)  train  LG  staff  in routine  M&E  and  in \npreparing  quarterly  progress  reports  for  review  by  the  respective  LG  councils; \nand  (d)  design  user-friendly  monitoring  tools  for  LG  monitoring  committees, \ntraining members of committees monitoring in use of monitoring tools. \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n\f \n66\n\nAppendix 11 \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n\n \n1. \nThe total cost of the technical assistance (TA) is estimated at $25.0  million equivalent, \ncomprising  $3.2  million  equivalent  in  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $21.8  million  equivalent  in \nlocal  currency  costs.  The  Department  for  International  Development  (DFID)  will  finance  $20.0 \nmillion  equivalent,  comprising  the entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $16.8  million equivalent  in \nlocal currency (Table A11). \n \n\nTable A11: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($) \n\n  \n  \n\n  \nItem \nA.

The reason for increasing poverty is due \nto  a  decade  long  slowdown  in  economic  growth,  decline  in  public  and  private  investments,  increase  in  fiscal  and \ncurrent  account  deficits,  and  rapid  debt  accumulation.  In  late  2000,  the  Government  of  Pakistan  adopted  Interim \nPoverty Reduction Strategy, which was updated in 2003. The core elements of the strategy are to engender growth, \nimprove human development and governance, and reduce vulnerability of the poor to shocks.  \n \nPunjab as the largest province of Pakistan, faces two challenges of reviving economic growth and reducing poverty. \nIncidence of poverty in the province is around 34.1%, which was 28.2% in 1993/94. The urban-rural gap is significant \nand poverty increased more rapidly in rural areas than in the urban areas from 31.9% in 1993/94 to 37.0% in 2001/02. \nThe incidence of poverty is much higher in southern Punjab. In southern Punjab, the level of economic development \nand income is lower than in northern Punjab. While urban areas in northern Punjab had the lowest level of poverty \nin the country (13%), southern Punjab showed the highest level of urban poverty in Pakistan (35% in 1999, up from 28% \nin  1993).  In  northern  Punjab  a  great  deal  of  development  efforts  and  investments,  especially  industrial \ninvestments, has been concentrated in recent years.  \n \nSince  2002/03,  the  poverty  reduction  strategy  and  program  of  the  Government  of  Punjab  has  made  a  major \ndeparture from the past in terms of increased financing for the social sectors and taking initiatives to improve public \nsector  governance.  The  strengthening  of  devolution  of  the  social  services  through  Punjab\u2019s  Local  Government \nOrdinance  2001  (PLGO)  is  well  advanced  than  other  provinces.  So  far  16  consequential  pieces  of  legislations  have \nbeen passed to strengthen the local government system. According to the Local Government Ordinance, education up \nto  secondary  level,  primary  health,  and  referral  services  up  to  district  hospitals  have  been  devolved  to  the  district \ngovernments,  while  tehsil  (town)  municipal  administrations  are  made  responsible  for  water  supply  and  sanitation \nsector as  part  of municipal services. The local government services, as  conceived,  are expected to  improve  quality, \nefficiency,  and  accountability  of  social  services  through  improved  resource  allocation,  participatory  decision  making, \nand by solving problems using local solutions. \n \nThe poverty partnership agreement between the Government of Pakistan and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nreflects  the  Government's  vision  for  poverty  reduction  and  improving  the  quality  and  access  of  social  services, \nespecially  for  the  poor.  The  Government  has  agreed  that  long-term  poverty  reduction  requires  focus  on  good \ngovernance,  increased  allocation  of  funds  for  social  sectors,  and  improving  basic  social  services  to  enhance \nhuman  development.  ADB  supports  governance  reforms  through  the  Decentralization  Support  Program  and \nother  ongoing sector programs and  projects undertaken by the Government. The  goal of the Punjab Devolved \nSocial  Services  Program  (PDSSP) \nto  achieve  Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals  (MDGs)  related  to  poverty,  gender,  education,  health,  water  and  sanitation.  Specifically, \nthe  PDSSP  will  have  the  following  focus:  (i)  realign  intergovernment  relations  to  support  devolved  social \nservices;  (ii)  rationalize  and  set  minimum  service  standards  for  social  services;  and  (iii)  strengthen  public \naccountability  mechanisms  and  promote  public-private  partnership.  In  addition,  it  will  also  enhance  social \nsector financing and allocative efficiency. PDSSP supports improving quality and access of three social sectors \n(health,  education,  and  water  supply  and  sanitation),  by  human  resource  development  in  three  tiers  of  local \ngovernments  (LGs)  in  the  social  sector,  and  stakeholders  participation  at  grassroots  level  in  planning, \nmanaging, and monitoring of social sector services. It is expected that PDSSP intervention would have an impact on \nincreased efficiency in service delivery mechanism in the three tiers of LGs. \n  \n \nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis                                             Targeting Classification:  Targeted Intervention  \n\nto  strengthen  devolved  social  services \n\nis \n\nPunjab  is the  largest Province in Pakistan  with 83 million (56%)  of population, of  which 32% lives in more than 215 \nurban  localities  and  30  large  towns  and  cities.  The  poverty  characteristics  in  Punjab  are  almost  similar  to  the \ncharacteristics  of  other  part  of  Pakistan.  The  incidence  of  poverty  in  Punjab  is  around  34.1%  and  it  was  28.2%  in \n1993/94. The urban-rural gap is significant and poverty increased more rapidly in rural areas from 31.9% in 1993 to \n37.0% in 2001/02. The poverty in Punjab is described in broader terms of income,  consumption,  social  services  and \nbasic needs of urban and rural population. A study on district profile ranked 34 districts of Punjab, and the findings of \nthe study suggest that out of the total  districts, 10  districts  have  been  classified  as  highly  deprived  in  descending \n\n\f \n68\n\nAppendix 12 \n\norder:  Rajanpur,  Muzaffargarh,  DG  Khan,  Layyah,  Lodhran,  Bhakkar,  Pakpattan,  Rahimyar  Khan,  Bahawalpur,  and \nJhang.  Seven  of  these  most  deprived  districts  fall  in  southern  Punjab.  Poverty  is  multidimensional  is  influenced  by \nboth  economic  and  social  factors.  The  of  poverty  in  southern  Punjab  is  largely  due  to  limited  growth  of  the \nagriculture  sector,  which  is  related  to  feudal  agriculture,  droughts,  and  increasing  shortage  of  water.  Punjab  is \nclosely associated with feudal agriculture, drought, water shortage and lack of social sector service.  \n \nSome  of  the  characteristics  of  the  rural  poverty  are:  (i)  dependence  on  daily  wage  labor  in  agriculture  and \nnonagricultural activities, brick kiln, petty vending, etc; (ii) high indebtedness to private money lenders; (iii) no land or \nany other assets; (iv) lack of access government services (health, education, water); and (v) no voice and no role in \ndecision making in the community.  \n \nIn Punjab inequalities of provision of social services exist among the households from different social and economic \nconditions. For example literacy rate is higher for higher income group than the lower income group. Services of health \nfacilities are available to the higher and middle-income group than the lower income group and the poor. That the poor \nlack access to basic social services is not always due to lack of established social service facilities, but often because \nof the service provider attitudes toward them. Interviews with the poor people indicate that they are often discriminated \nand neglected by the service providers. For example, sometimes the health service provider of the government health \nfacility does not attend the poor patient and if the poor get attended by the doctor, they do not get adequate or proper \ntreatment and medicine.    \n \nIlliteracy is also positively correlated with poverty. The poverty levels are higher in households where the head of the \nhousehold  is  illiterate.  Literacy  ratio  and  per  pupil  expenditure  of  primary  and  secondary  education  is  substantially \nhigher in urban areas than rural areas and among households in the highest income quintile compared to households \nin the lowest income quintile. Gross enrollment rates (GERs) at primary level in Punjab are 69% for females and 84% \nfor  males  and  net  primary  enrollment  rates  (NERs)  are  43%  for  females  and  47%  for  males.  Primary  level  GERs \namong the first income  quintile are 44% for  females and  61%  for males, while in the fifth quintile they  are 97% and \n117%, respectively. Literacy rates for population 10 years and above are 36% for females and 57% for males. GERs \nat middle level are 43% for females and 46% for males. At secondary level, GERs are 34% for females and 55% for \nmales. Dropout rates of children 15\u201319 years were much higher among girls (33%) than boys (24.45%). \n \nThe social sector indicators are generally poor compared to countries with similar per capita income. The total fertility \nrate is currently 4.8 and contraceptive prevalence rate is estimated at 27.6%. The maternal mortality ratio per 100,000 \nlive  births  is  in  the  range  of  500.  Nearly  11%  of  children  die  before  reaching  their  fifth  birthday.  Among  those  who \nsurvive,  one  quarter  do  not  go  to  school.  Currently  there  are  about  4  million  malnourished  children  in  Punjab,  and \nabout a third of all pregnant women are estimated to have iron deficiency anemia. Over 35% of children under the age \nof 5 years are short for their age; over 10% are under weight for their age and over half are anemic.  \n \nDuring  the  1990s,  the  government  of  Punjab  implemented  Social  Action  Program  (SAP)  to  improve  delivery  and \ngovernance  of  social  services.  The  SAP  results  are  mixed.  A  combination  of  factors  such  as  weak  planning, \nimplementation  strategies,  lack  of  social  mobilization  activities,  planning  at  the  community  level,  lack  of  transparent \nprocess in financing and management etc. influenced the outcome of the SAP and did not bring the desired results. In \naddition  to  the  SAP,  other  social  sector  and  poverty  programs  brought  limited  impact  on  poverty  reduction  and  in \nproviding access to social services to the poor and women. Limited success of social service delivery is due to several \nfactors. Following observations are made during the field visits to Guzrat and Mandi Bahauddin: (i) lack of clarity on \nrole and responsibilities of the officials from different line agencies and the different tier of the local government under \nPLGO 2001; (ii) intergovernment relationships are not fully realized and practiced by the officials as described under \ndifferent notifications; (iii) in equitable and inefficient management and resource allocation for district, tehsil, and union \ncouncil  level;  (iv)  schools  and  health  facilities  are  without  teachers,  doctors,  and  paramedics;  (v)  absenteeism  of \nservice providers in the assigned duty station; and (vi) service facilities are not aligned to provide services to the poor \nand the women.  \n \nThe  proposed  PDSSP  plans  to  contribute  to  these  objectives  by  introducing  rational  policy  reforms,  building \ninstitutional and human resource capacity of social service agencies, quality of social services, and flexible financing \nfor the devolved social services. The specific interventions include: (i) development of operational manuals for service \nagencies  for  better  planning;  (ii)  capacity  building  of  the  officials  of  the  service  agencies,  local  government  and  the \nelected  representatives  of  the  union  councils  and  nazims  of  the  three  tiers  of  local  government;  (iii)  use  of  citizen \ncharters,  display  of  development  funds,  development  projects/programs  for  citizens  review  and  suggestion,  in  the \ndistrict council, tehsil, union council, and  social service facility boards; (iv) awareness raising activities for the service \nproviders  to  develop  pro-poor  and  pro-gender  social  service  delivery  mechanism;  and  (v)  improving  public-private \npartnership mechanisms for developing innovative projects on  social  services  for  the  local  communities,  including \nwomen and the poor. An important intervention under the PDSSP is to target poor and vulnerable population groups \nby designing pro-poor services, especially for the rural population and the deprived districts. \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n69\n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nC.        Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nStakeholder Analysis. A cross-section of the stakeholders was invited in five regional workshops in three regions of \nthe  province  i.e.,  south,  north,  and  center.  The  stakeholders  included  elected  representatives  from  various  tiers  of \nlocal government, government officials from provincial and local government departments, and some nongovernment \norganization (NGO) representatives. Meetings  were held with civil society organizations (CSOs), NGOs/ community-\ncitizen boards (CCBs), and elected representatives of the local government to identify issues related to weak service \ndelivery  and  strategies  to  improve  delivery  of  services.  The  potential  for  involvement  of  CSOs,  NGOs,  CCBs,  and \ncommunity-based organizations (CBOs) were identified. It is revealed from the discussions that on occasions where a \nCSO, such as the Patient Welfare Association, is involved in improving the health services in hospitals, the services \nhave  improved  significantly.  Similarly,  where  elected  woman  representative  is  involved  in  a  school  management \ncommittee (SMC), the performance of the school has improved.  \n \nThe  PDSSP  will  include  interventions  through  public-private  partnerships  to  involve  CSOs,  CBOS,  NGOs,  and \nthe  elected  representatives  of  the  union  council  to  develop  or  improve  community-level  social  services.  The \nspecific  interventions  comprise:  (i)  strengthening  skills  of  the  members  of  the  local  government\u2019s  monitoring \ncommittees at all levels to enable them to perform their mandated role through development of monitoring guidelines \nand  tools;  (ii)  strengthening  the  role  of  the  CSOs,  CBOs,  CCBs,  and  NGOs  in  developing  an  efficient  health \nservice  delivery  system  at  the  local  level; (iii) developing linkages between the social service agencies and CSOs, \nCBOs,  CCBs,  and  NGOs  for  pro-poor  service  delivery;  and  (iv)  introducing  a  participatory  monitoring  system  for \nassessment of the performance of the service delivery system and of the service providers.  \n \nThe display of development funds and schemes on social services for public information at the district council, tehsil \nmunicipal  administration,  and  union  council  level  would  enhance  awareness  among  local  communities  about  social \nsector  service  availability.  The  public  disclosure  of  development  funds  and  schemes  would  facilitate  community \ninvolvement in monitoring of social services. \n   \nThe  PDSSP  will  coordinate  its  work  on  water  and  sanitation  with  the  two  ADB-funded  water  and  sanitation  projects \nthat have  developed  participatory strategy such  as (i)  establishing  community  level  committees  to  undertake  the \nconstruction of lane level sewers; (ii) participation of committees in planning activities in their respective localities; \nand (iii) formation of community level committees in respective wards and neighborhood to conduct awareness \ncampaigns for solid waste management. With regard to services on education sector, PDSSP will collaborate with \nthe  International  Development  Association  funded  Punjab  Education  Sector  Reforms  Program  (PESRP)  which  has \nbuilt in participatory planning for making school councils/SMCs efficient. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?                 \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No          \n\n \nD. \nGender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n\n \nThere  is  little  evidence  of  narrowing  down  of  gender  gaps  among  various  socioeconomic  status  in  the  province  of \nPunjab.  Women  do  not  have  adequate  access  to  health,  literacy  and  education  services.  According  to  Pakistan \nIntegrated Household Survey (PIHS) only 10% women in Punjab received postpartum care, 15% in urban areas and \n8% in rural areas. They are given a limited role in decision-making in the public sphere. Improvement is insignificant in \npolicy  formulation,  monitoring  of  policy  implementation,  and  participating  in  conceptualizing  development  programs, \nespecially at local level. Women\u2019s share in employment opportunities is far below their share in population. Pakistan \nranks 129th out of 146 countries on the gender-related development index and 92nd in gender empowerment measures \nout  of  94  countries.  Women  are  subjected  to  discriminatory  laws,  violence,  and  lack  of  employment  opportunities. \nAccountability of public sector entities on gender equity is negligible. \n \nMaternal mortality is high in the range 350 per 100,000 live births. The antenatal coverage is extremely low. Only 21% \nof deliveries at national level took place in health institutions during 2000/01. About a third of all pregnant women are \nanemic. About one third of girls never enroll in primary school compared with one quarter of boys. The main reasons \nfor lower enrolment for girls are poverty, restricted mobility, cultural barriers, household barriers, and physical access. \n\n\f \n70\n\nAppendix 12 \n\n   No \n\n    Yes \n\n \nDuring the field visits the following were observed: (i) maternal mortality rate in rural areas is high. In some places, out \nof 10 pregnant women, two die during delivery; (ii) side effect management of contraceptive is lacking; (iii) there are \nhigh rates of communicable diseases and water- borne diseases; (iv) malnutrition among children is common; and (v) \npoor women have little access to government heath facilities.  With regard to the SMC, in cases where female elected \nrepresentatives  and  mothers  are  involved,  the  SMC  is  active  in  monitoring  of  school  performance,  mobilization  of \nfunds,  placement  of  teachers  in  school,  enrollment  of  children  in  school,  and  ensuring  teaching  of  mathematics  and \nEnglish. The field visits suggested that, woman councilors with leadership qualities are effective in providing the poor \nwith access to health services where government service providers are reluctant to provide services to poor.  \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nGender Action Plan: \n \nThe following interventions will be incorporated in the various components of the PDSSP to address gender issues: \n \nCapacity Building of Service Providers. Training program and awareness raising activities of the male and female \nofficials of line agencies and Local Government, male and female representatives of the union council and the health \nservice  providers  (doctors,  paramedics,  education  officers)  will  include  subjects  on  gender  sensitization,  pro-gender \nand  pro-poor  planning,  implementation  of  services  for  the  poor  and  gender  mainstreaming  to  ensure  benefit  to  the \nwomen, and the poor communities.  \n \nHealth  Services  for  Women  and  Children.  Health  sector  intervention  will  include  (i)  implementation  of  essential \npackage of services in the district hospitals, tehsil hospitals, rural health centers, and basic health units (BHUs) with a \nfocus on women and children; (ii) recruitment of additional trained midwives, female health workers for expansion of \nservice  delivery,  especially  for  family  planning,  midwifery,  and  emergency  services;  (iii)  recruitment  additional  lady \nhealth visitors (LHVs) for BHUs and incentive packages for them; and (iv) ensuring placement and attendance of the \nexisting LHVs at BHUs.  \n \nStrengthening the Role of Women Councilors of Union Council (UC) for Service Delivery. The elected women \ncouncilors  of  UC  will  be  provided  with  training  on  leadership,  negotiating  skills,  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the \ncouncilors, planning processes; the functions of the three tiers of local government, linkages of line agencies, role of \nmonitoring committees at the union and facility level such as SMC and health committees; and existing development \nprojects/programs  on  the  social  sectors.  The  training  of  the  councilors  will  enhance  their  capacity  for  effective \nimplementation and monitoring of social service delivery at the local level.  \n \nSecondary  School  Facilities  for  Girls.  In  secondary  school  up  gradation,  it  will  be  ensured  that  textbook, \nscholarships, and expansion of education facilities for handicapped children should include schools from the deprived \ndistricts.  School  councils  of  the  primary  and/or  middle  school  will  include,  female  teachers,  mothers,  and  elected \nrepresentatives  of  the  UCs.  Community  mobilization  activities  will  be  undertaken  to  increase  enrolment  of  the  girls. \nThe  role  of  education  field  officers  and  school  councils  will  be  strengthen  to  undertake  community  mobilization  for \nenrollment  of  girls.  Toilet  facilities,  school  boundaries,  and  educational  aid  materials  will  be  available  for  girls  at \nsecondary school.    \n \nSteering  Committee  and  Program  Support  Unit  (PSU).  Representation  of  women  professionals  in  the  steering \ncommittee  and  provincial  support  unit  and  district  support  unit  will  be  ensured.  Any  capacity  building  of  the \ngovernment  officials  (national  and  international)  will  include  at  least  20%  of  female  officials  from  the  relevant \ngovernment  agencies.  Gender  sensitization  training  will  be  provided  to  the  members  of  steering  committee,  and \nofficials from the line agencies at the district level.  \n \nPSU will provide support at the district level to facilitate the process of implementation of \u201cGender Reform Action Plan \n(GRAP)\u201d which has implications of representation of women in various sector recruitment committees, preparation of \nsocial sectors specific quota profiles, and ongoing monitoring of gender-disaggregated data of human resource in the \nsocial sectors. The GRAP implementation  will be monitored  using gender-based monitoring indicators comprising (i) \nannual  collection  and  analysis  of  gender  disaggregated  data  of  social  sectors,  (ii) increased  number  of  women  in \ndecision making, and (iii) gender-sensitive training sessions for civil servants in the social sectors.   \n \nGender  and  Development  Consultant.  The  consulting  service  package  will  include  a  gender  and  development \n(GAD)  specialist  for  a  period  of  30  person  months.  The  GAD  specialist  will  work  closely  with  the  community \ndevelopment experts to ensure that gender based grassroots level development schemes are planned by CBOs/CCBs \nunder the conditional grant and public-private partnership program. The GAD consultant will operationalize the gender \naction plan based on the above gender strategy. The gender action plan will include a budget for activities, time frame \n\n\ffor implementation of activities, and monitoring indicators. The management information system (MIS) system of the \nPDSSP will include gender disaggregated monitoring indicators by different socioeconomic groups. \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n71\n\nSocial Safeguards and other Social Risks \n\n \n\nE. \n  \nItem \n\nResettlement \n\n Not significant \n\n Not significant \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone  \n Significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \nPlan Required \n\n \nPunjab  Government  will  ensure \nthat  unoccupied \ngovernment land is used for any social infrastructure.
