The project \nwill strengthen regional cooperation and integration by implementing regional tourism standards, \npromoting  multi-country  tour  circuits,  and  facilitating  policy  dialogue  to  reduce  nonphysical \nbarriers to travel. The project investment plan is in line with the GMS Tourism Sector Strategy, \n2005\u201320153 and Cambodia\u2019s Tourism Development Strategic Plan, 2012\u20132020.4 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nSubregional context. Among country groupings in Asia and the Pacific, the GMS has a \n3. \nstrong  comparative  advantage  in tourism  as  a result  of  its  diverse  cultural  and natural  assets, \ngood  international  air  and  land  transport  connectivity,  and  surging  demand  for  intraregional \nleisure  travel.  International  tourist  arrivals  are  growing  by  12.4%  per  year  and  reached  an  all-\ntime high of 44.8 million in 2012, generating $44.3 billion in receipts. Tourism sustains 7 million \njobs  and  creates  significant  positive  economic  spillovers  in  other  sectors.  About  one-third  of \ninternational  arrivals  visit  at  least  two  countries  while  travelling  in  the  GMS,  and  millions  of \nresidents cross borders for day trips. GMS countries are keen to strengthen subregional tourism \ncooperation  and  recently  reaffirmed  their  commitment  to  promote  cross-border  tourism  under \nthe  GMS  Economic  Cooperation  Program  Strategic  Framework,  2012\u20132022. 5 Nevertheless, \nunderinvestment  in  public  infrastructure  beyond the major gateways  holds back the  expansion \nof private tourism enterprises and the dispersal of benefits to less-developed areas.6 \n \n4. \nNational priorities. Cambodia received 3.58 million international tourists in 2012, a 24% \nincrease  compared  with  2011  but  only  8%  of  total  GMS  arrivals.  Tourism  directly  contributes \n11.5% to gross domestic product and sustains 780,000 jobs (12.4% of total employment).7 The \ngovernment\u2019s  Tourism  Development  Strategic  Plan  2012\u20132020  is  consistent  with  the  GMS \nTourism  Sector  Strategy,  prioritizing  transport  and  urban  infrastructure  upgrades,  human \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance.

Travel and Tourism Economic Impact 2013: Cambodia. London. \n\n\f2     \n\nresource development, and policy enhancements to improve the business enabling environment \nfor  tourism.  The  2009  Law  on  Tourism  provides  the  legal  basis  for  the  plan,  directing  the \nMinistry  of  Tourism  (MOT)  to  lead  development  of  a  quality  and  sustainable  tourism  industry \nthat  contributes  to  job  creation  and  poverty  reduction.  Strategic  objectives  are  to  (i)  diversify \ntourism  products  and  services  with  a  focus  on  the  coastal  zone  and  northeast,  (ii)  improve \ninternal  transportation  networks  and  regional  connectivity,  (iii)  enhance  marketing  and \npromotion,  and  (iv)  minimize  negative  tourism  impacts.  Targets  for  2020  are  7  million \ninternational arrivals, 10 million domestic trips, and $5 billion equivalent in tourism receipts. \n \n5. \nKey  issues.  Although  Cambodia  has  long  stretches  of  pristine  beaches,  a  protected \narea network  covering  24%  of the  country,  and widely  dispersed  cultural  attractions  with good \ndevelopment potential, tourism is highly concentrated in Siem Reap and the temples of Angkor, \nwhich account for 58% of international arrivals, 30% of hospitality investment, and the majority \nof  tour  operations. 8  Women  comprise  about  60%  of  tourism  workers;  however,  many  are \nemployed  in  lower-skilled  jobs  paying  lower  wages,  and  women  are  underrepresented  in \ntourism  management.  The  key  impediments  to  more  inclusive  and  geographically  balanced \ngrowth are insufficient transport infrastructure in secondary destinations, weak market linkages \nbetween the tourism supply chain and other economic sectors, and limited institutional capacity \nto  promote tourism-related  enterprise  development  in lagging areas.  Consequently,  up to  40% \nof  tourism  receipts  leave  the  country  to  purchase  tourism-related  imports  such  as  food, \nsouvenirs,  and  manufactured  goods,  and  as  little  as  11%  of  destination  spending  reaches  the \npoor. 9 Low  service  standards  and  inadequate  environmental  services  also  suppress  tourist \nspending and length of stay, limiting average receipts per visitor to about $620\u2014less than half \nthe benchmark $1,390 in Asia and the Pacific.10 \n \n6. \nTo  engender  a more  equitable  pattern  of tourism  development,  the  project  will  develop \nan international marine passenger pier in Kampot to facilitate the movement of tourists into the \nsouthern  coastal  zone.  This  will  establish  a  new  gateway  between  southern  Cambodia,  Viet \nNam, and other destinations in the Gulf of Thailand, helping to unlock the area\u2019s clear potential \nfor  tourism  growth.  Complementary  project  investments  will  improve  wastewater  management \nand sanitation  in  neighboring Kep  province  and strengthen  the  capacity of  local  entrepreneurs \nand  destination  management  organizations.11 This  integrated  approach  will  catalyze  additional \nprivate  investment  in  tourism  superstructure  and  services,  and  ensure  that  tourism  growth  is \nenvironmentally and socially sustainable.12 \n \n7. \nRelated  policies  and  strategies.  The  project  is  in  line  with  the  government\u2019s \nRectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity, and Efficiency, Phase III, which aims to \naccelerate  economic  growth,  create  jobs,  and  reduce  inequality. 13 Project  outputs  align  with \nstrategic  thrusts to  (i)  develop  physical  infrastructure  in areas  with high economic and tourism \npotential, (ii) promote private sector development and employment, and (iii) accelerate capacity \nimproving  subregional \nbuilding  and  human  resource  development.  The  emphasis  on \nconnectivity, improving the quality and coverage of environmental services, strengthening value \nchains, and creating jobs for unskilled and semiskilled workers supports the overarching aim of \n\n                                                \n8  Ministry of Tourism, Cambodia. 2012.

The  GMS  Tourism  Working  Group  is  the  forum  for \n8. \ncoordinating  regional  tourism  sector  assistance.15 Senior  GMS  tourism  officials  and  ADB  co-\nchair semiannual working group meetings to guide implementation of the GMS Tourism Sector \nStrategy  and  identify  policy  issues  for  elevation  to  the  annual  GMS  tourism  ministers  meeting \nand the triennial GMS summit. In Cambodia, sector coordination is led by the MOT and Council \nfor  the  Development  of  Cambodia.  Other  development  partners  engaged  in  tourism  are  the \nGerman  development  cooperation \nInternationale \nZusammenarbeit,  the  Government  of  New  Zealand,  the  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency,  and  the  Wildlife  Conservation  Society.  The  Pacific  Asia  Travel  Association  is  the \nleading industry group with over 1,100 members. \n \n9. \nLessons.  ADB\u2019s  GMS  tourism  sector  assistance  program  and  completed  tourism \nprojects in Cambodia are rated successful.16 Lessons from past projects include the need to (i) \nanalyze tourism demand in project areas to guide the selection of infrastructure investments, (ii) \nimprove  cross-sector  coordination  and  build  synergies  with  other  ADB  assistance,  (iii)  provide \ncapacity building for project management and infrastructure operation and maintenance (O&M), \nand  (iv)  promote  private  enterprise  development  alongside  infrastructure  to  expand  income-\ngenerating  opportunities  for  local  residents.  Applying  these  lessons,  the  project  has  selected \nrelevant infrastructure subprojects based on robust market analysis and complementarities with \nother  ADB  and  development  partner  assistance  for  urban  development,  water  supply  and \nsanitation, vocational training, and tourism.17 Capacity building for entities responsible for O&M \nand parallel support for micro and small enterprises that are mainly led by women will enhance \nthe  sustainability  of  project  outputs  and  ensure  benefits  reach  vulnerable  groups.  The  project \ndeliberately focuses on improving infrastructure and capacity to connect lower-income groups to \nmarkets,  and  enabling  lower-educated  residents  to  access  salaried  employment  and  other \neconomic opportunities. \n \n10. \nSpecial features. The project will (i) strengthen collaboration between the government, \nthe  private  sector,  civil  society,  and  local  communities  to  improve  tourism  destination \nmanagement;  (ii)  demonstrate  how  tourist  entry  fees  and  charges  can  help  finance  the \nmaintenance  of  public goods  such  as  water  transport terminals  and  wastewater  treatment;  (iii) \nstrengthen  knowledge  partnerships  among  GMS  and  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian \nNations  members;  and  (iv)  leverage  service  sector  opportunities  to  accelerate  widening  of  the \nGMS transport corridors into economic corridors by linking secondary tourism destinations with \nincreasingly affluent regional markets. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  increased  tourism  employment  for  people  living  in \nunderdeveloped  segments  of  the  GMS  Southern  Coastal  Corridor.  The  outcome  will  be \nincreased  tourism  receipts  in  the  three  project  provinces  of  Kampot,  Kep,  and  Koh  Kong.  By \n2019, aggregate annual international tourism receipts in the three project provinces will increase \n\n                                                \n14 ADB. 2014.

Contract  packaging  will  attract  contractors  with  suitable \nqualifications  and  ensure  efficient  procurement.  Capacity  building  programs  will  improve  the \nbusiness enabling environment and help small entrepreneurs to become more competitive. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n22. \nAn  economic  analysis  was  conducted  for  infrastructure  subprojects  following  ADB \nguidelines.24 Benefits  quantified  are  (i)  increased  tourism  receipts  arising  from  an  incremental \nincrease  in  tourist  arrivals  (1%\u20137%  annually)  and  length  of  stay  (0.5  days)  in  the  project-\nsupported  destinations,  and  (ii)  tourism  loss  avoidance  arising  from  better  environmental \nmanagement  of  the  Kep  crab  market  and  adjacent  public  beaches.  Economic  benefits  not \nquantified  are  transport  time  savings,  increased  land  values  for  property  owners,  and  health \n                                                \n21 ADB.  2002.

The base case results indicate all subprojects \nare  economically  viable,  with  estimated  economic  internal  rates  of  return  exceeding  the \nassumed economic opportunity cost of capital of 12.0%. Returns are 23.6% for the Kampot pier \nand  15.2%  for  the  Kep  crab  market.  Findings  of  the  analysis  are  consistent  with  the  past \nperformance  of  other  ADB-financed  public  tourism  infrastructure  in  Cambodia,  which  applying \nsimilar  assumptions,  generated  economic  internal  rates  of  return  exceeding  29.0%. 25  The \nsubprojects  are  most  sensitive  to  a  reduction  in  tourist  arrivals  but  remain  viable  under  all \nadverse scenarios tested. 26  \n \nThe financial analysis followed ADB guidelines.27 The financial internal rate of return for \n23. \nthe Kampot pier is 4.2%, higher than the weighted average cost of capital, calculated at 0.9%. A \npier  management  authority  will  be  established  to  recover  O&M  costs  through  passenger \nterminal fees, berthing fees, and other income streams. The Kep DPWT will recover the cost of \nmaintaining  the  wastewater  treatment  system  at  the  Kep  crab  market  by  collecting  an \nenvironmental fee from businesses  in the  market. The  access  road  component  of  the  Kampot \npier subproject was identified as nonrevenue generating, thus a financial sustainability analysis \nof  the  DPWT  that  will  be  responsible  for  O&M  of  the  asset  was  undertaken.  The  financial \nsustainability analysis found that there will be sufficient funds to maintain the road.28 \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n24. \nAn  assessment  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies\u2019  capacity  to  undertake \nprocurement  and  financial  management  envisaged  under  the  project\u2014including  the  use  of \nstatement of expenditure and imprest fund procedure\u2014determined that pre-mitigation financial \nmanagement  risks  are  high.  Measures  to  mitigate  identified  risks,  such  as  the  potential  for \ncorruption  from  weak  procurement  oversight  and  the  shortage  of  financial  management  skills, \nwill  be  addressed  by  applying  standard  ADB  bidding  documents,  developing  a  financial \nmanagement  training  manual  and  suitable  accounting  systems,  and  embedding  long-term \nconsultants in the PCU and PIUs to provide on-the-job training for project staff and counterparts. \nCompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  financial  management  and  external  audit  requirements  will  be \nmonitored  by  review  missions  and  normal  project  supervision.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy \n(1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  MOT. \nThe  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures,  including  the  MOT-endorsed \ngood governance framework, are described in the project administration manual (footnote 18). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n25. \nThe  project  will  directly  benefit  about  30,000  people  in  the  three  participating \nprovinces.29 Poverty rates in project areas range from 16% in Kampot to as high as 42% in Koh \nKong, mainly due to a lack of access to economic opportunities, underdeveloped human capital, \nand a lack of enterprise support services. The project\u2019s complementary investments to improve \naccess  infrastructure  and  environmental  services,  build  capacity  to  strengthen  tourism \nmanagement,  and  provide  micro  and  small  enterprises  with  training  and  business  support \nservices  are  designed  to  overcome  these  constraints  and  expand  economic  opportunities  to \nbenefit  the  poor  and  low-income  households.

A gender action plan has been prepared specifying women will comprise 50% \nof  participants  in  community  consultations,  60%  of  participants  in  hospitality  training,  40%  of \nleadership positions in destination management organizations, and 25% of project management \nand  technical  staff. 30  The  project  will  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  women  and  children  to \nHIV/AIDS  transmission,  human  trafficking,  and  other  forms  of  exploitation  by  conducting \nawareness programs and promoting collaboration between private enterprises, nongovernment \norganizations, and law enforcement agencies.31 \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n26. \nAll  safeguards  documents  were  prepared  following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009) and are posted on the ADB website in compliance with disclosure requirements (Public \nCommunications  Policy  2011).  The  safeguards categorization for  environment  and  involuntary \nresettlement  is  B,  and the  categorization for  indigenous  peoples is  C. Initial  consultations  with \nmen and women residents, government officials, and civil society confirm broad support for the \nproject.  Consultation  with these groups  will  continue throughout  the  project  cycle following  the \nconsultation  and  participation  plan  and  stakeholder  communications  strategy.  The  project \nincludes  resources  to  effectively  implement  social  and  environmental  safeguards.  Monitoring \nrequirements and appropriate grievance redress mechanisms are in the safeguards documents. \n \n27. \nInitial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  were  prepared  in  the  context  of  the  project\u2019s \narea of  influence  and  based  on  current  information.32 The  potential  environmental  impacts  are \nnot  irreversible,  diverse,  or  unprecedented.  Expected  impacts  and  risks  are  site-specific,  and \nappropriate  mitigating  measures  are  incorporated  into  environmental  management  plans \n(EMPs) prepared for each infrastructure subproject. The Kampot pier will be developed a safe \ndistance  upstream  of  seagrass  conservation  areas  in  Kampot  bay.  Mitigating  measures  are \ndesigned  in  accordance  with  international  good  practice  and  applicable  national  laws  and \nregulations. The IEEs and EMPs will be updated and finalized at the detailed design stage. The \nupdated  documents  will  be  cleared  by  the  government  and  ADB,  posted  to  the  ADB  website, \nand  form  part  of  bidding  and  contract  documents.  The  final  IEEs  and  EMPs  will  guide  the \npreparation of site management plans with environmentally sensitive O&M guidelines. \n \n28. \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  involve  only  temporary  disruption  of  33 \nbusinesses in the Kep crab market during construction of the wastewater treatment system, with \nno  permanent  impacts,  no  land  acquisition,  and  no  physical  dislocation  or  severely  affected \npersons.  Due  diligence  undertaken  confirms  that  there  is  no  past  or  present  involuntary  land \nacquisition  for  either  infrastructure  subproject,  there  are  no  pending  resettlement  issues  for \nexisting facilities, and the process of voluntary land donation for the Kampot pier is legitimate. A \nresettlement plan has been prepared for the Kep crab market subproject that is commensurate \nwith  the  extent  and  degree  of  the  expected  impacts. 33 The  initial  cost  of  compensation  for \nbusiness  losses  is  estimated  at  $11,000.  This  amount  is  considered  adequate,  based  on  the \ncensus  and  inventory  of  losses  prepared  in  consultation  with  affected  persons  and  the \ngovernment\u2019s  interministerial  resettlement  committee.  Project  information  was  disclosed  to  all \naffected persons, and a cutoff date for inclusion in the resettlement plan was established during \n\n                                                \n30 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 The  project  will  collaborate  with  the  Child  Safe  Tourism  Campaign  in  cooperation  with  World  Vision,  the  United \n\nNations Office on Drugs and Crime, and Interpol.  \n\n32 Initial Environmental Examinations (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 Resettlement Plan: Kep Crab Market Environmental Improvements (accessible from the list of linked documents in \n\nAppendix 2).  \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10     \n\nresettlement  consultations.
