Each \nsucceeding  subprogram  is to  be  processed  sequentially  upon \ncompletion of the preceding subprogram. \n \nTargeting classification: General intervention \nSector (subsector): Finance (finance sector development) \nThemes (subthemes): Economic growth (promoting economic \nefficiency and enabling business environment), governance \n(economic and financial governance) \nLocation impact: National (high impact) \n \nCategory C \n\n \nInvoluntary resettlement: Category C \nImpact on indigenous people: Category C \nNo  involuntary  resettlement  or  impact  on  indigenous  people  is \nexpected from program implementation. \n \nWith  a  rapidly  growing  commercial  economy  that  requires  a  sound \nfinancial system to sustain its rate of growth, the Government needs \nto  develop  the  financial  sector  by  mobilizing  financial  resources\u2014\nchanneling  them  to  productive  investments,  and  managing  the \ninherent  risks\u2014if  it  is  to  achieve  long-term  sustainable  economic \ngrowth  and  poverty  reduction.  The  Asian  financial  crisis  of  1997\u2013\n1998  and  the  global  financial  crisis  that  began  in  2008  have \nprovided  many  examples  of  the  devastating  impact  that  financial \ncrises  can  have  on  countries,  wiping  out  several  years  of  growth \nwithin  a  very  short  time.  To  promote  economic  growth,  reduce \npoverty,  and  help  countries  prepare  to  mitigate  shocks  emanating \nfrom  external  financial  crises,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nplays an important role in supporting financial sector development in \nits developing member countries, including Cambodia.  \n \nThe program loan cluster is supporting the Government\u2019s continued \nefforts \nfinancial  sector  by  supporting  a \ncombination  of  legal  and  regulatory  reforms,  targeted  capacity \nbuilding, improved disclosure standards and financial transparency, \nand establishment of key financial infrastructure. A sound, efficient, \nand integrated financial system is crucial for achieving broad-based \nsustainable  economic  growth.  It  helps  to  reduce  poverty  by \nincreasing job opportunities, lowering transaction costs of economic \nactivities,  and  extending  the  outreach  of  the  formal  financial  sector \nto  poor  and  rural  areas.  An  efficient  financial  system  will  promote \nprivate  sector  development  and  foreign  direct  investment.  A  robust \n\nto  strengthen \n\nthe \n\n\f \n\nii \n \n\n \nObjective and Scope \n\n \nLoan Amount  \nand Terms \n \n \n\n \nProgram Period  \nand Tranching \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n\nthe  economy \n\nfrom  unfavorable \nin \n\nfinancial  sector  will  protect \nexogenous  shocks,  which  are  becoming  more  common \nincreasingly global financial markets.     \n \nThe  FSP  II  aims  to  promote  the  development  of  a  sound,  market-\nbased  financial  system  to  support  resource  mobilization  and \nsustainable  economic  growth.  With  a  growing,  resilient,  and  more \nefficient  financial  system  as  the  expected  outcome,  subprogram  3 \nwill continue the following reform activities: \n \n\n(i) \n\nImprove  financial  intermediation  by  upgrading  the  payments, \nclearance, and settlement system to support growing financial \nservices;  enhance  market  confidence  by  improving  public \nfinancial  disclosure  and  establishing  a  credit  information \nbureau;  support  market  development  by  establishing  an \ninterbank  market  and  tradable  government  securities;  and \nimproving the outreach of microfinance institutions (MFIs) in a \nsustainable manner.  \n\n(ii)  Enhance  resilience  of  the  financial  sector  by  revising  and \nupdating  the  law  on  banking  and  financial  institutions,  and  by \nfinancial \nintroducing  supportive  regulations \nactivities;  tighten  prudential  supervision  and  regulations  of \nbanks and microfinance institutions; and build on the legal and \nregulatory  foundation  by  adopting  a  new  law  on  commercial \ncontracts  that  includes  specific  sections  on  agencies  and \nfranchising. \n\nto  strengthen \n\n(iii)  Promote  good  governance  by  implementing  international \ninitiatives on combating money laundering and the financing of \ncorporate  governance  and \nterrorism,  by  enhancing \ntransparency \nindustry,  by  establishing \ncommercial dispute resolution mechanisms, and by improving \nthe  capability  and  increasing  the  number  of  qualified  national \naccountants and auditors. \n\ninsurance \n\nthe \n\nin \n\n(iv)  Enhance  efficiency  by  computerizing \n\nthe  management \ninformation  system  of  the  National  Bank  of  Cambodia  (NBC), \nas well as by upgrading the skills and capacity of microfinance \nagencies\u2019 staff.   \n\n \nA  loan  of  $10,000,000  equivalent  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s\nSpecial  Funds  resources  for  subprogram  3.  The  loan  will  have  a \n24-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years.  The  interest  rate \nwill be 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter.  \n \nThe implementation period for subprogram 3 is January\u2013December \n2009. The loan will be released in a single tranche upon completion \nof specific tranche conditions and following loan effectiveness. \n \nThe  Government  will  use  the  local  currency  counterpart  funds \ngenerated by the loan proceeds to meet program expenditures and \nassociated  costs  of  reform  and  additional  budgetary  allocation  to \nhelp ease the effects of the global economic downturn. \n\n\fiii \n\nNBC will be the Executing Agency, and the Ministry of Economy and \nFinance  (MEF)  and  Ministry  of  Commerce  (MOC)  will  be  the \nImplementing  Agencies.  The  financial  sector  steering  committee, \nchaired by the governor of NBC and comprising senior officers from \nMEF,  MOC,  and  NBC,  will  meet  as  required  to  review  progress \nreports  from  the  technical  working  group,  consider  pending  issues, \nand  propose  concrete  actions  to  resolve  issues.  A  senior  NBC \nofficer has been appointed as program director to assist NBC, MEF, \nand  MOC  in  coordinating  day-to-day  program  implementation.  The \nprogram  director  will  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  to  ADB  on \nprogram implementation. \n \nThe loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \ncosts  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and \nprocured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and \nimports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  All \nprocurement  of  goods  and  services  produced  in,  and  originating \nfrom, ADB member countries will be made with due consideration to \neconomy  and  efficiency, \nin  accordance  with  standard  public \nprocedures  in  Cambodia  and  normal  private  sector  commercial \npractices  acceptable  to  ADB.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of \nADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans (1998), the loan proceeds will be \ndisbursed to the Kingdom of Cambodia as the Borrower.  \n \nProgram  implementation  could  face  a  number  of  risks,  for  which \nmitigation measures have been put in place, as appropriate.  \n \n\n(i)  External  challenges  to  sustaining  economic  growth. \nCambodia\u2019s  economic  prospects  must  be  viewed  against  a \nnumber of adverse developments in the external environment. \nThe unexpected surge in international energy and food prices \ntoward the end of 2007 fueled higher domestic inflation in the \nearly  part  of  2008  with  knock-on  effects  on  consumption, \ngrowth,  and  poverty.  The  Government \nintroduced  a \ncombination  of  fiscal  and  monetary  measures  to  moderate \ninflation,  resulting  in  a  slowdown  in  lending  since  late  2008. \nFalling  energy  and  commodity  prices  helped  to  ease  the \ninflation  rate,  which  reached  a  single  digit  in  early  2009. \nAlthough  inflation  was  contained,  other  economic  conditions \nwere  affected  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2008  because  of  the \nspillover  effects  of  the  financial  crisis  that  originated  in  the \nUnited  States  and  Europe,  causing  the  global  economic \nslowdown.  The  global  economic  downturn  has  negatively \naffected  Cambodia\u2019s  growth  rate,  as  demand  for  Cambodia\u2019s \ngarments has reduced, tourist arrivals have fallen, and foreign \ninvestments \nlarge-scale  construction  projects  have \ndeclined. As the garment, tourism, and construction industries \nare  three  of  the  four  main  drivers  of  growth,  the  economy  is \nprojected to slow down to \u20131.5% (from 2.5%) in 2009 from an \nestimated  6.7%  in  2008.  The  Government  has  further  eased \n\nfor \n\nExecuting and \nImplementing Agencies \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nRisks and  \nSafeguards \n\n \n\n\f \n\niv \n \n\n \nTechnical Assistance  \n\nmonetary  policy  since  February  2009.  The  fiscal  deficit  is \nforecast  to  be  above  the  2009  approved  budget  to  create \nspace  for  fiscal  stimulus.  Because  of  uncertainty  about  the \nduration  of,  and  depth  of  impact  of  this  global  economic \ndownturn, the Government and ADB will continue to undertake \nperiodic \nfinancial \ndevelopments  to  assess  potential  risks  to  the  financial  sector \nthroughout subprogram 3. These reviews will continue through \nthe  program  period  for  subprogram  4.  Budget  assistance \nthrough  program \nthis \nin  2009, \nprogram, is being provided to bolster the economy\u2019s resilience. \n\nof  macroeconomic \n\nincluding \n\nthrough \n\nreviews \n\nloans \n\nand \n\n \n(ii)   Corruption  and  weak  governance.  Weak  governance  and \nincidents  of  corruption  could  erode  investor  confidence  and \nprevent  the  attainment  of  expected  sector  outcomes.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  National  Strategic  Development  Plan  2006\u2013\n2010  views  corruption  as  a  threat  to  sustained  growth  and \ndevelopment  of  the  country  in  general.  Backed  by  an  active \ndevelopment  community,  the  Government  is  increasingly \ntaking  a  tougher  stance  against  corruption.  The  consensus  is \nthat good governance and measures to address corruption are \nneeded for a successful partnership between the Government \nand the development community. This was considered during \ndesign  of  the  program  cluster,  and  there  will  be  continuous \ninstitutional  governance \npursuit  of \nstructure, \nfinancial \ndisclosure \ntransparency,  complementary  legislation,  regulatory  updates \nand enforcement, supervision, and surveillance of the financial \nsector.  \n\nimprovements \naccounting \n\nstandards, \n\nthe \n\nto \n\n \n(iii)  Weak  institutional  and  human  capacity.  Some  of  the \nfinancial sector risks are associated with weak institutional and \nhuman capacity. The same applies to the implementation and \nenforcement  of  new  laws  and  regulations.  To  mitigate  those \nrisks, training programs have been initiated at various training \ninstitutions  established  during \nfirst  Financial  Sector \nProgram.  Subprogram  3  provides  financial  support  to  the \ninstitutions  to  help  update  their  curricula.  The  proposed  TA \nthat  is  being  processed  separately  will  help  reduce  the  risks \narising from weak capacity, especially in the implementation of \nall  prudential  regulations  and  in  addressing  new  challenges \nemerging from the lower domestic growth caused by the global \neconomic  downturn.  With \nthe \nintegrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to  far  outweigh \nany costs.  \n\nthese  design  safeguards, \n\nthe \n\n \nIn  connection  with  the  implementation  of  the  fourth  and  final \nsubprogram  of  the  Financial  Sector  Program  II  Cluster,  the \nGovernment  has  asked  ADB  for  a  capacity  development  technical \nassistance  (CDTA)  grant.  The  proposed  CDTA  is  being  processed \nseparately.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n\n1. \nto the Kingdom of Cambodia for subprogram 3 of the Financial Sector Program II (FSP II).  \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\n \n2. \nADB has supported reforms in Cambodia\u2019s financial sector since 1999, beginning with a \ndiagnostic  assessment  of  the  financial  sector  and  formulation  of  the  Financial  Sector \nDevelopment  Blueprint  2001\u20132010.  The  blueprint,  updated  as \nthe  Financial  Sector \nDevelopment Strategy (FSDS) 2006\u20132015, was adopted by the Government in February 2007. \nThe  FSDS  provides  the  long-term  objectives  and  development  framework  to  guide  and  shape \nmedium-term policy design and implementation. The Government has, since 2001, been able to \nimplement important reforms in the financial sector with ADB assistance under the first Financial \nSector  Program1  (FSP  I)  that  concluded  in  August  2007  and  with  complementary  assistance \nfrom the International Monetary Fund (IMF) poverty reduction and growth facility that ended in \n2003.  Since  implementation  of  the  blueprint,  there  have  been  some  notable  achievements  as \nwell  as  lessons  from  both  domestic  and  international  experience.  Those  experiences,  coupled \nwith  the  need  to  support  continuing  development  of  the  financial  sector  to  meet  the  new \nchallenges, prompted the Government to request further support from ADB to enable continuing \nreforms  in  the  sector.  This  led  to  design  and  approval  of  the  FSP  II  cluster2  on  6  December \n2007. \n \n3. \nThe  FSP  II  comprises  a  series  of  four  single-tranche  subprograms,  to  be  implemented \nfrom  September  2006  to  December  2010,  within  a  well-defined  medium-term  framework \ninvolving  fundamental  reforms  to  be  completed  prior  to  consideration  by  ADB\u2019s  Board  of \nDirectors  of  each  subprogram.  Subprograms  are  linked  by  key  actions  (triggers)  deemed \nessential  for  the  success  of  the  medium-term  program.  The  overall  goal  of  the  FSP  II  is  to \npromote  the  development  of  a  sound,  market-based  financial  system  to  enhance  resource \nmobilization  and  support  sustainable  economic  growth.  The  expected  outcome  is  a  growing, \nresilient, and efficient financial system. (The design and monitoring framework for the Program \nis  in  Appendix  1,  including  the  achievements  of  subprograms  1  and  2  with  TA  support  from \nADB. The policy matrix and medium-term program are in Appendix 2.)  \n \n4. \nSubprogram 1 with 14 key reform actions was approved together with the FSP II cluster \nconcept on 6 December 2007. The loan agreement for subprogram 1 (footnote 2) was signed \non 18 February 2008 and the single tranche equivalent of SDR6,381,000 was fully disbursed in \nApril 2008. Subprogram 2 with 14 key reform actions (triggers) was approved on 5 December \n2008 after all policy triggers were completed.3\n The loan agreement was signed on 8 December, \ndeclared  effective  on  22  December,  and  the  single  tranche  equivalent  to  SDR6,618,000  was \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.

Manila (Loan 2479-CAM). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n2 \n \n \nreleased  on  23  December  2008.  ADB  provided  a  TA  grant  of  $300,000  to  support  the \nimplementation of key policy triggers of subprogram 3. With 11 policy triggers and 11 expected \nmilestones, implementation of subprogram 3 began in January 2009.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT  \n\n \n5. \nGlobal  economic  crisis  impact  economic  growth.  Cambodia  has  recorded  real \neconomic growth of over 9% throughout 2001 to 2008 (country economic indicators for 2004\u2013\n2009 in Table 1). With this continuous high economic growth, indications are that the incidence \nof overall poverty declined from 35% in 2004 to an estimated 30% in 2007. However, this gain \nmay  be  reversed  if  the  effect  of  the  global  economic  slowdown  on  Cambodia\u2019s  economy  is \nprolonged  and  the  country\u2019s  garment  exports,  tourism  receipts,  and  foreign  funding  for  large-\nscale  construction  projects  continue  to  fall,  as  these  are  three  of  the  four  key  engines  for \nCambodia\u2019s economic growth. Exports of garments to the US and Europe, tourist arrivals, and \nforeign  direct  investment  have  fallen  off  sharply  since  the  last  quarter  of  2008,  contributing  to \nthe slowdown in gross domestic product (GDP) growth to 6.7% in 2008. Garment export, which \naccounts for 16% of GDP, declined by 27% in the first 5 months of 2009; receipts from tourism, \nrepresenting 15% of GDP, declined by around 3%; and construction, which accounts for 7% of \nGDP,  has  slowed  down  because  of  the  decline  in  foreign  direct  investment.  Only  agricultural \noutput (27% of GDP) is expected to show relatively strong growth (estimated at 4.3%) in 2009. \nADB has revised down economic growth for 2009 to \u20131.5% (from 2.5%) and projected economic \ngrowth to pick up moderately to around 3.5% (from 4%) in 2010. As a result, state revenues are \nexpected  to  shrink  by  about  1 percentage  point  of  GDP  in  2009,  from  11.9%  in  2008, \ncontributing  to  a  larger  budget  deficit.  On  a  positive  note,  the  inflation  rate,  which  peaked  at \n25.1%  in  June  2008,  declined  into  the  single  digits  early  this  year  (7.5  at  the  end  of  August \n2009) in line with lower fuel and food prices and easing domestic demand pressures (Figure 1). \nThis provides room for macroeconomic stimulus measures. \n \nStrong  but  vulnerable  external  sector.  With  the  projected  slowdown  in  exports  and \n6. \nservices, the external current account deficit widened to 16.5% of GDP in 2008 and is projected \nto narrow to 11.8% of GDP in 2009. The current account deficit will narrow as declining exports \nare expected to be partially offset by lower imports from the reduction in related inputs (fabrics, \nfood  items,  construction  materials)  and  by  lower  fuel  prices,  resulting  in  an  estimated  overall \ntrade balance of \u201313%. Gross foreign reserves that reached a high of $2.2 billion at the end of \n2008  (4 months  of  import  cover)  have  remained  at  the  same  level  in  June  2009.  In  the \nmeantime, the authorities will continue to monitor the situation closely. \n \n7. \nPro-growth fiscal policy. The Government has maintained a prudent fiscal stance over \nrecent years and built up its deposits in the banking system to around 6% of GDP. The overall \nbudget  deficit  for  2008  was  2.7%  of  GDP  compared  to  2.8%  in  2007,  mainly  financed  by \noverseas  sources.  The  2009  budget,  prepared  before  the  onset  of  the  global  financial  crisis, \nprojects an overall deficit of 3%\u20134% of GDP to be financed from foreign sources combined with \na  drawdown  of  the  accumulated  fiscal  reserve  within  the  banking  system.  The  Government \npositively considered the IMF\u2019s recommendation to allow the deficit to increase to 4.8% of GDP \nto provide added fiscal stimulus, especially in the wake of lower government revenues in 2009. \nGiven  the  projected  economic  contraction  for  Cambodia  in  2009,  an  expansionary  budget  is \nappropriate to maintain social expenditures, and to stimulate economic growth including through \nhigher levels of capital spending. No new fiscal measures were introduced in 2009, and since \nAugust the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) started receiving proposals from ministries \nfor the 2010 budget. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nItem \n\nTable 1: Country Economic Indicators, 2004\u20132009 \n2004 \n  2007 \n \n\n  2005 \n \n\n   2006 \n\n \n\n \n\n  2008 \n \n\n1.

Fueled  by  rising  foreign \ncapital inflows and bank deposits, broad money growth accelerated sharply, peaking at 63% in \nDecember  2007.  This  contributed  to  an  unsustainable  rate  of  growth  in  bank  credit,  which \nreached 102% year-on-year in May 2008. It also stoked inflation, which had been subdued until \n2007.  Inflation  was  also  sparked  by  supply-side  shocks  and  surged  from  an  annual  rate  of \n10.8% in December 2007 to peak at 25.1% in June 2008. The monetary authorities responded \nby imposing a 15% limit on bank credit to the real sector in June 2008 (subsequently removed in \nJanuary  2009),  by  doubling  the  minimum  reserve  requirement  on  foreign  currency  deposits  to \n16% in July of the same year (subsequently reduced to 12% in January 2009), and by easing \nrestrictions  on  placement  of  excess  reserves  offshore.

However,  Cambodia\u2019s  financial  sector  is  moderately \nvulnerable  because  of  its  exposure to  the  real  sectors,  which  are  being  affected  by  the  global \neconomic  downturn,  and  also  through  the  decline  in  foreign  direct  investments.  The  National \nBank of Cambodia (NBC), early in the year, took substantive actions in response to emerging \nstrains  on  the  banking  system  caused  by  tighter  liquidity  conditions  and  the  slowdown  in \neconomic growth. In particular, the removal of the 15% limit on banking credit to the real sector, \nreduction  of  the  minimum  reserve  requirement  from  16%  to  12%,  the  creation  of  an  overdraft \nfacility  to  manage  temporary  liquidity  risk  from  individual  banks,  improvements  to  the \nmanagement  of  the  reserve  requirement  system,  adoption  of  the  revised  regulation  to \nstrengthen  asset  classification  and  provisioning,  and  the  strong  commitment  to  improving  the \nregulatory regime, bank surveillance, and enforcement of prudential regulations. Total liquidity is \ngradually  improving  and  in  August  2009  broad  money  supply  recovered  to  31%  growth  (year-\non-year)  while  growth  of  credit  to  the  private  sector  is  still  declining.  NBC  is  monitoring  the \nliquidity  position  of  banks  and  financial  institutions  on  a  daily  basis  and  nonperforming  loans \n(NPLs) on a monthly basis.   \n \n\na The figures for 2009 are as of end-August 2009.  \nSource: National Bank of Cambodia, National Institute of Statistics, ADB estimates.  \n \n\nYear\n\n-10\n\n \n\n \n                                                \n4  A new consumer price index methodology was adopted in April 2009 using 2006 as the base year.

Cambodia\u2019s economy is vulnerable to a number of \nadverse developments in the external environment. The sharp slowdown in the US, European, \nand  major  Asian  economies  together  with  recent  turbulence  in  international  financial  markets \nhas  indirectly  affected  growth  conditions  in  Cambodia.  Maintaining  macroeconomic  stability, \nincluding  a  low  rate  of  inflation,  is  a  necessary  condition  for  the  economy\u2019s  diversification  and \ngrowth recovery. Equally important is to limit the adverse impact of the economic slowdown on \nvulnerable segments of society. Cambodia has reserves sufficient for 4 months of imports, and, \nwhile these are normally adequate against external shocks, close monitoring of macroeconomic \nand financial developments is needed. Beyond the near-term, complementary structural reforms \nwill  be  required  to  address  Cambodia\u2019s  longer-term  development  challenges,  especially  in \nreducing poverty (particularly in rural areas) and narrowing urban\u2013rural income disparities. As a \ncontribution  to  the  financial  sector,  NBC  and  MEF  are  considering  ways  to  fast-track  the \nadoption of market-based instruments to help absorb excess liquidity whenever required and to \nbegin  the  development  of  interbank  and  capital  markets.  This  is  consistent  with  FSDS  2006\u2013\n2015 objectives. \n\nIV. \n\nLINK BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND ADB STRATEGIES \n\n \n\n11. \nCambodia\u2019s  5-year  National  Strategic  Development  Plan  2006\u20132010  was  prepared  in \nthe  context  of  a  falling,  but  still  high,  incidence  of  overall  poverty  and  a  growing  urban\u2013rural \ndivide.  The  plan  aims  to  give  effect  to  the  Government\u2019s  Rectangular  Strategy  (phase  2), \nadopted  in  October  2008,  that  sets  out  the  Government\u2019s  reform  agenda  as  a  series  of  four \ninterlocking strategies with enhanced governance at its core. One of the four strategies focuses \non  the  preconditions  required  to  promote  economic  growth  through  agriculture,  infrastructure, \nresource \nand  private  sector  development  while  enhancing  employment  and  human \ndevelopment. \n \n12. \nADB\u2019s  overarching  goal  in  Cambodia  is  sustainable  poverty  reduction.  In  line  with  the \npriorities  and  strategies  identified  in  the  Government\u2019s  Rectangular  Strategy  (phase  2),  ADB\u2019s \ncountry  strategy  and  program 5   focuses  on  three  strategic  pillars:  (i)  broad-based  economic \ngrowth  through  investments  in  physical  infrastructure,  development  of  the  financial  sector, \nsupport  for  greater  regional  integration,  sustainable  development  of  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises  (SMEs),  and  investments  in  agriculture  and  irrigation;  (ii)  inclusive  social \ndevelopment through basic education, empowerment of vulnerable groups such as women and \nethnic  minorities,  control  of  communicable  diseases,  provision  of  rural  water  supply  and \nsanitation facilities, and community-based sustainable management and conservation of natural \nresources  in  the  Tonle  Sap  basin;  and  (iii)  good  governance  through  improvements  in  public \nfinancial  management  to  enhance  the  development  effectiveness  of  public  expenditures  and \ndecentralization  initiatives  to  strengthen  local  participation  in  government  and  improve  public \nservice delivery.   \n \n13. \nADB\u2019s country strategy and program specifically states that ADB will continue its leading \nrole  in  supporting  financial  sector  development  and  that  ADB\u2019s  future  involvement  in  the \nfinancial sector would depend on the successful update of the FSDS. The updated FSDS 2006\u2013\n2015  states  that  financial  sector  development  is  not  an  end  in  itself;  rather,  it  is  one  aspect \nsupporting the development and reduction of poverty in Cambodia (Figure 2). While much work \nis  needed  to  achieve  this  difficult  goal,  accelerating  and  diversifying  growth  is  generally \naccepted  as  the  key.  Financial  sector  development  must  support  this  objective.  Reform  and \nchange are essential for growth. At the same time, expanding finance brings risks. Hence, the \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program (2005\u20132009): Cambodia.

At  the  end  of  July  2009,  the  formal  financial  system  comprised  NBC, \n27 private  commercial  banks,  6  specialized  financial  institutions,  2  representative  offices  of \nforeign-based  banks,  20  licensed  and  25  registered  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs),  and \n7 insurance  companies.  Cambodia  also  has  the  objective  of  developing  bond  and  securities \nmarkets  in  the  near  future.  The  predominantly  rural  nature  of  the  economy,  high  transaction \ncosts,  and  low  creditor  confidence  have  been  the  main  factors  resulting  in  low  formal \nintermediation  and  outreach  within  the  financial  sector.  There  has  also  been  a  slow \ndevelopment  of  nonbank  financial  institutions,  with  a  limited  range  of  products  and  services \nbeing offered. A sector analysis is in Appendix 3.  \n \nThe  performance  of  Cambodia\u2019s  financial  sector  has  been  satisfactory,  though \n15. \nchallenging (refer to key financial data in Table 2). With a relatively strong banking subsector, \nfinancial  deepening  has  accelerated  with  increased  financial  services  promoted  through  the \nprogressive reforms implemented under the FSP I and II. The broad money supply (M2) to GDP \nhas risen from 20.5% of GDP in 2006 (before the FSP II) to 29.3% of GDP in 2008 (Figure 3). \nCredit to the private sector has correspondingly risen from 12.2% of GDP in 2006 to 23.6% of \nGDP in 2008. Total deposits to GDP was around 22.8% of GDP in 2008 compared to 17.9% of \nGDP  in  2006.  Despite  these  positive  developments,  policy  gaps,  implementation  challenges, \nand capacity constraints still need to be addressed in each of the subsectors.

Most  of  the  recent  performance \nindicators  suggest  that  the  banking  system  is  reasonably  profitable,  efficient,  has  adequate \nliquidity, and is well capitalized. On average, banks have maintained overall solvency at above \n25% since 2001 (33% in June 2009) compared to the minimum prudential requirement of 15% \n(Figures 4 and 5). Furthermore, the capital requirement for banks that are owned  by nonbank \nentities was recently tripled from $13 million equivalent as a precaution against potential shocks. \nThe reported NPL ratio of banks has increased from 3.7% in December 2008 to 5.2% in June \n2009. Banks have been free to set their own interest rates since 1995 and the average annual \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\ninterest  rate  spread  declined  from  15.3%  in  2004  to  9.8%  in  June  2009.  While  substantial \nprogress  has  been  made  in  the  banking  supervision  area,  further  work  is  required  to  upgrade \nprudential requirements fully to international standards and best practices, recruit and upgrade \nthe  skills  of  new  NBC  supervision  staff,  and  enhance  proper  surveillance  and  uniform \nenforcement  of  regulations  to  maintain  the  safety  of  public  deposits  and  the  integrity  of  the \nbanking system. \n \n\nFigure  4: C onfide nce  in the  B anking Syste m, 2001\u20132009\nFigure 4:  Confidence in the Banking System, 2001\u20132009 \n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nN u m b e r o f R e g is te re d  Ba n ks\n \n\nTo ta l D e p o s its /GD P (% )\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2002\n\n2001\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2005\nYe a r\n\nPriva te  Se cto r C re d it/GD P (% )\n\nGDP = gross domestic product. \nThe figures for 2009 are as of end June 2009.  \nSource: National Bank of Cambodia. \n \n\nFigure 5:  Soundness of Banking System, 2001\u20132009 \nFigure 5:  Soundness of Banking System, 2001\u20132009\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                    \n\n70\n\n50\n\n60\n\n%\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2005\nYear\n\nAverage CAR \n\nNPLs/Total Loans\n\n CAR = capital adequacy ratio, NPL = nonperforming loan. \n   The figures for 2009 are as of end June 2009.  \n   Source: National Bank of Cambodia. \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n10 \n \n \n17.  Microfinance.  Microfinance  has come a long way since licensing commenced in 2002, \nwith 20 licensed MFIs and 25 registered nongovernment-operated MFIs at the end of July 2009. \nThe microfinance industry is expanding rapidly, providing the link between the formal financial \nsector  and  rural  households  and  microenterprises  (Figure  6).  The  number  of  active  borrowers \navailing  of  rural  household  credits,  credit  for  agriculture,  and  small-business  loans  increased \nfrom 624,000 clients in 2007 to more than 807,335 clients (6% of the total population) in June \n2009,  with  potential  for  further  growth.  Microfinance  lending  also  grew  from  $160.1  million  in \n2007  to  $262.5  million  in  June  2009,  with  reported  NPLs  rising  from  below  1%  in  December \n2008 to 3% in June 2009. Voluntary savings remain very small and access to local finance by \nMFIs  has  been  very  limited.  With  TA6  from  ADB,  NBC  issued  a  prakas7  in  December  2007 \nsetting out the criteria for MFIs that are eligible to mobilize voluntary public savings. Two MFIs \nhave  been  granted  license  to  mobilize  savings  from  the  public  and  two  other  applications  are \nbeing  processed.  Through  NBC\u2019s  encouragement,  five  commercial  banks  are  now  providing \ncredit facilities to MFIs and other commercial banks are being encouraged to provide this facility \nto help MFIs at a time when the global financial crisis is affecting offshore funding sources. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nf\no\n\n100\n\n400\n\n200\n\n500\n\n600\n\n800\n\n700\n\n900\n\n300\n\n)\n0\n0\n0\n'\n(\n\n1,000\n\ns\nr\no\nt\ni\ns\no\np\ne\nD\nd\nn\na\ns\nr\ne\nw\no\nr\nr\no\nB\n\nFigure 6: Development of Microfinance Institutions\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInsurance.

Divesting government shares continues to be an important \nreform  agenda  item  to  allow  MEF  to  perform  its  regulatory  functions  equitably.  In  November \n2008,  the  Government  successfully  sold  75%  of  its  shares  in  Cambodian  National  Insurance \nCompany (Caminco). The insurance industry is very small, with a total premium income of $20.7 \nmillion in 2008 compared to $17.5 million in 2007 (Figure 7). Growing the industry would require \na  more  comprehensive  legal  and  regulatory  framework  (comparable  to  those  used  in \n\nMFI = microfinance institution. \na The figures for 2009 are as of end June 2009.  \nSource: National Bank of Cambodia. \n \n\nNo. of  Licensed and Registered MFIs\n\nNo. of  MFI Depositors \n\nNo. of  MFI Borrow ers\n\n2005\nYe ar\n\n2003\n\n2006\n\n2001\n\n2009\n\n2008\n\n2007\n\n2002\n\n2004\n\no\nN\n\n0\n\n \n.\n\n \n\n \n                                                \n6 ADB. 2005.

Significant commercial legislation enacted since  \n2001  includes  laws  on  insurance,  accounting,  commercial  enterprises,  negotiable  instruments \nand  payment  transactions,  commercial  arbitration,  secured  transactions,  government  and \nnongovernment  securities,  insolvency,  and  combating  money  laundering  and  the  financing  of \nterrorism. Most of the enacted laws have been implemented and training curriculum introduced \nat  selected  legal  faculties  to  train  legal  practitioners  and  judges  on  these  new  principles.  The \njudicial  system,  including  the  commercial  court  in  Cambodia,  is  being  developed  through \nassistance  from  other  development  partners  led  by  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme  (UNDP).  The  draft  law  on  commercial  courts  that  is  being  considered  by  the \nCouncil  of  Ministers  is  based  on  the  UNDP  model.  With  the  enactment  of  the  Law  on \nCommercial  Arbitration  in  2006  under  the  FSP  I,  the  establishment  of  the  national  arbitration \ncenter is supported by subprogram 3 with TA8 provided by ADB. \n \nAccounting  development.

To  improve  accounting  and \nauditing  capacity,  the  Government  has  been  funding  a  scholarship  scheme  to  assist  at  least \n70 candidates annually to meet the required certified public accountant (CPA) accreditation. In \nJanuary  2009,  MEF  issued  a  prakas  on  the  promulgation  of  Cambodian  Financial  Reporting \nStandards  based  on  the  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards.  In  addition,  the  National \nAccounting  Council  is  working  on  developing  accounting  standards  for  SMEs  based  on \ninternational  standards  and  best  practice.  The  World  Bank  is  providing  TA  to  the  National \nAccounting  Council  to  help  revise  and  update  the  accounting  law,  and  review  the  accounting \nframework to help improve the enforcement of the accounting and auditing standards.  \n \nB. \n \n21. \nGlobal  financial  and  economic  crisis.  The  turmoil  in  international  financial  markets \nintensified  in  September  2008  following  the  failure  of  important  financial  institutions  in  the  US \nand Europe, which froze interbank and credit markets around the world and pushed the price of \nrisk  upward\u2014triggering  a  global  liquidity  shortage  worldwide.  Cambodia\u2019s  banks  have  limited \ndirect  exposure  and  the  domestic  capital  and  money  markets  have  not  been  fully  developed. \nThe  indirect  impact  of  the  global  economic  slowdown  on  Cambodia\u2019s  financial  sector  has \nmanifested in two ways: (i) on the liquidity of the banking system, as a result of declining foreign \ndirect  investments  and  export  receipts;  and  (ii)  on  the  quality  of  credit  exposure  to  the  real \nsector,  which  are  being  affected  by  declining  international and  domestic  demands.  Banks  that \nhave substantially increased their lending since 2007 are affected. The authorities have eased \nmonetary  policy  by  reducing  the  minimum  reserve  requirement  from  16%  to  12%,  and  made \navailable  an  overdraft  facility  to  individual  banks  since  January  2009.  The  reported  NPLs \nincreased  from  3.7%  in  December  2008  to  5.2%  in  June  2009  and  are  expected  to  rise \ngradually during the year. The banking system has been resilient, with a strong overall solvency \nposition  of  33%  in  June  2009  compared  to  the  minimum  prudential  requirement  of  15%. \nFurthermore, the capital requirement for banks that are owned by nonbank entities was recently \ntripled from $13 million equivalent as a precaution against potential shocks. The authorities and \nADB  will  continue  to  monitor  financial  and  macroeconomic  developments  closely  during \nsubprogram 3.  \n \n22.          Underdeveloped  commercial  and  institutional  framework.  As  in  other  developing \neconomies,  the  fundamental  weaknesses  that  stifle  financial  sector  development  in  Cambodia \nstem  mainly  from  its  underdeveloped  commercial  and  institutional  framework,  low  formalized \nenterprise development, and limited human capacity and technical expertise. Previous decades \nof  conflict  that  destroyed  institutional  structures  and  drained  or  in  some  instances  wiped  out \nqualified  human  resources,  followed  by  a  period  of  international  isolation,  resulted  in  weak \ngovernance  and  very  low  public  confidence.  The  transition  from  a  centrally  controlled  to  a \nmarket-led economy and the speedy implementation of changes creates new forms of risk and \naccompanying opportunities for corruption. The commercial court system is being developed by \nother  development  partners  to  help  enforce  contracts  and  resolve  commercial  disputes.  This \nshould  increase  public  and  investor  confidence  in  the  sector.  Enterprises  that  have  enjoyed \nmany  years  of  operating  without  an  established  rule  of  law  prefer  to  remain  informal.  The \nmajority of participants in the real sector are reluctant to enter into any form of formal financial \ntransactions  for  fear  of  being  exposed  to  the  tax  authorities.  To  help  mitigate  these  issues, \nefforts  are  under  way  to  get  the  National  Assembly  to  adopt  the  remaining  commercial  laws, \nhave  the  Government  establish  a  commercial  court  with  supporting  dispute  resolution \nmechanisms, and enhance institutional and technical capacity. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\nBank  supervision  capacity \n\nRapid  expansion  of  bank  lending.  Starting  from  a  relatively  small  base,  credit  to  the \n23. \nprivate sector has been expanding very rapidly, from a total stock of 12.2% of GDP in 2006 to \n23.6%  in  2008.  The  year-on-year  growth  rate  reached  102%  at  the  end  of  June  2008  but \ndeclined to 54% at the end of December 2008. Credit, which is concentrated in a few banks, is \nalmost  entirely  collateralized  against  the  real  estate  market.  Some  banks\u2019  assets  are \nincreasingly  vulnerable  to  real  estate  risks.  In  early  2008,  NBC  issued  guidelines  to  help \nimprove banks\u2019 classification and reporting of exposure to housing, construction, and real estate \nloans.  While  reported  system-wide  NPLs  remain  below  10%,  there  are  concerns  about  the \nquality of asset classification and reporting. NBC issued in February 2009 a revised regulation \non loan grading and provisioning by banks, based on the Basel 1 requirements, to help improve \nloan classification and reporting. The rapid credit expansion reinforces the critical importance of \nstrong  banking  supervision  and  enforcing  compliance  with  prudential  regulations  while  giving \npriority to assessing asset quality. ADB provided TA (footnote 8) to help introduce procedures \nfor on-site supervision and provide on-the-job guidance to NBC staff during the comprehensive \nreview of the six largest banks under subprogram 3.  \n \nto  sustain  bank  soundness.  The  progressive \n24. \ndevelopment  of  bank  supervision  capacity  through  knowledge  transfer  is  an  ongoing  process. \nThis  is  expected,  given  that  the  financial  sector  has  had  to  be  rebuilt  over  the  past  10  years \nfollowing the internal conflict that destroyed institutional structures and either drained or wiped \nout  human  resources  in  most  sectors.  NBC  continues  to  strengthen  the  supervisory  and \nregulatory  framework  as  it  strives  to  maintain  its  primary  objective  of  ensuring  a  safe,  sound, \nand  stable  financial  system.  Specialized  technical  support  is  an  ongoing  requirement  as  the \nfinancial  sector  takes  on  new  products,  services,  and  adopts  new  international  standards  and \npractices.  Regulatory  standards  have  been  gradually  improved  and  relevant  prudential \nregulations added since the establishment of the Bank Supervision Department under FSP I. All \nbanks  adopted  a  uniform  chart  of  accounts  in  2004  and  commenced  publishing  their  annual \naudited financial reports since 2005. An early warning system (Cambodia Off-Site Bank Report \nfor  Prompt  Corrective  Action)  was  introduced  in  2007.  Additional  regulations  were  added  in \n2008  and  early  2009  to  (i)  promote  the  proper  identification  of  NPLs;  (ii)  allocate  sufficient \nprovisions for NPLs, internal governance, and fit and proper tests relating to the competencies \nof bank management and board members; and (iii) combat money laundering and financing of \nterrorism.  NBC  has  requested  external  auditors  of  each  bank  to  undertake,  in  addition  to  the \nannual external audits, a comprehensive review of loan portfolios to June 2008 and provide their \nopinions  on  the  quality  of  those  portfolios  and  the  application  of  prudential  regulations  by  the \nend  of  September.  These  developments  are  evidence  that  NBC  is  serious  about  bank \nsoundness and has made significant progress to promote market transparency and establish a \nsound  regulatory  and  supervisory  regime  to  enhance  the  integrity  of  the  banking  system. \nAlthough enforcement of prudential regulations is improving, compliance with those regulations \nremains uneven. In June 2009, the Bank Supervision Department had 61 staff with a minimum \nqualification of a bachelor\u2019s degree in accounting, commerce, economics, or law\u201425 have been \nassigned  to  bank  off-site  and  15  to  bank  on-site  supervision.  NBC  intends  to  increase  the \nnumber of supervision staff and enforce compliance during FSP II implementation with TA from \nADB and the IMF.  \n \nC. \n\nLessons \n\nKey lessons from the FSP I, subprograms 1 and 2 of the FSP II, and the associated TA \n\n25. \nprojects to the sector include the following: \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n \n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\nin \n\nflexibility \n\nto  program \n\nimplementation.

Adoption of the medium-term blueprint for the financial \nsector meant that the Government had a set of long-term objectives to guide and \nshape  medium-term  policy  design  and \nthe \nunderlying  policy  environment  necessitated  an  update  of  the  blueprint.  In \nFebruary 2007, the updated blueprint, known as the FSDS for 2006\u20132015, was \nadopted.  The  close  consultative  process  involving  the  Government,  ADB,  and \nother  development  partners  strengthened  the  Government\u2019s  ownership  and \nincreased the potential for funding agency buy-in.  \nFlexibility  in  design.  Financial  sector  reforms  are  complex  and  involve  major \nchanges  to  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  institutional  arrangements, \nfinancial  infrastructure,  and  human  capacity.  Hence,  sufficient  time  must  be \nallocated \nis  also  a  key \nconsideration. The use of the program cluster approach under the FSP I provided \nthe opportunity to refine the proposed policy actions for succeeding subprograms \nto  reflect  the  Government\u2019s  achievements,  changes  in  the  policy  environment, \nand  lessons  from  the  previous  subprograms.  The  FSP  II  has  also  adopted  the \ncluster  approach,  with  each  of  the  four  subprograms  to  be  processed  annually. \nThis  provides  the  flexibility  to  address  new  macroeconomic  developments  and \nemerging risks to the financial sector.  \nTime lag between adoption of reforms and effective enforcement. The 2009 \nindependent  program  performance  evaluation  review  covering  the  FSP  I  noted \nthe  time  lag  between  the  implementation  of  reforms  and  actual  enforcement  or \ncomprehensive compliance. The delays in enforcement of commercial laws and \ncomprehensive  application  of  compulsory  insurance,  the  credit  information \ninterbank  market,  and  accounting  and  auditing  standards  were \nsystem, \nspecifically  mentioned  as  these  could  weaken  the  effectiveness  of  the  overall \nFSP  I  program.  The  enforcement  of  commercial  laws,  however,  relates  to  the \ndevelopment of the judicial system as a whole and involves projects funded and \nimplemented by other multilateral and bilateral development partners. The design \nof  the  FSP  II  has  taken  into  account  the  progressive  enforcement  of  the \nremaining reforms toward wider compliance within the sector and has identified a \nprogram of TA projects to support their implementation.  \nTA  resources.  Under  the  FSP  I,  the  Government  adopted  legal,  policy,  and \ninstitutional measures, many of which were relatively new concepts and therefore \nrequired  extensive  coordination  and  consultation  to  ascertain  stakeholders\u2019 \nunderstanding,  acceptance,  and  adoption  of  the  new  measures.  Substantial  TA \nsupport was necessary to ensure that best practices were incorporated and then \nconsolidated  throughout  implementation  to  achieve  the  intended  results.  The \nFSP  II  has  also  identified  a  program  of  TA  projects  to  help  implement  the \nmedium-term  program  and  enhance  compliance  with  completed  activities. \nIndividual  consultants  have  been  selected  not  only  on  merit  but  also  on  their \nperceived  ability  to  work  well  with  local  counterpart  staff  and  sensitivity  to  the \nlocal  culture.  These  criteria  are  considered  essential  for  successful  transfer  of \nknowledge. \nEmerging  risks.  The  transition  from  a  centrally  controlled  to  a  market-led \neconomy  creates  new  forms  of  risk.  The  presence  of  international  banks,  the \noffer  of  more  sophisticated  services  to  depositors  (credit  and  debit  cards  for \nautomatic  teller  machines  and  electronic  funds  transfer  systems),  and  the \nincrease  in  lending  demonstrate  increasing  investor  confidence  in  Cambodia\u2019s \nfinancial  system.  With  these  encouraging  developments,  however,  come  new \nrisks and challenges\u2014such as lack of discipline over the use of credit cards, lax \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\napplication  of  credit  underwriting  and  portfolio  management  policies,  and \ninappropriate safety nets for users of electronic cards. Strengthening awareness \nof  potential  risks  within  both  the  public  and  the  financial  sectors  is  therefore \nimportant. Similarly, new ways of mitigating risks must be pursued.  \n\nVI. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SUBPROGRAM \n\nin  January  2009.  All  have  been  completed  prior \n\n26. \nLinks  between  subprograms.  Following  approval  of  the  FSP  II  cluster  in  December \n2007,  the  momentum  of  implementing  the  policy  reforms  within  the  FSP  II  medium-term \nframework  has  been  maintained.  As  a  continuation  of  reforms  initiated  under  subprograms  1 \nand  2,  subprogram  3  has  11  key  reform  actions  (triggers)  that  the  Government  began \nimplementing \nto  Board  circulation. \nDisbursement will follow loan effectiveness. Subprogram 4 has been designed with nine triggers \nand six milestones to continue the policy reforms initiated under subprograms 1, 2, and 3 within \nthe  four  broad  objectives  of  the  medium-term  framework  that  are  intended  to  (i)  improve \nconfidence  and  financial  intermediation,  (ii)  maintain  financial  stability,  (iii)  promote  good \ngovernance,  and  (iv)  enhance  the  efficiency  of  the  financial  sector.  Implementation  of \nsubprogram  4  will  commence  in  January  2010  and  will  be  processed  for  Board  approval  and \ndisbursement  in  December  2010.  Reform  measures  may  be  added  to  subprogram  4  as \nnecessary  within  the  medium-term  framework  after  duly  considering  the  Government\u2019s  social \nand economic achievements and changes in the macro policy environment.   \n \nRefined  subprogram  3  policy  triggers.  With  changing  domestic  circumstances  and \n27. \ndevelopmental  priorities, \nrequested  minor \nmodifications to three of the triggers. These minor changes are within the medium-term program \nframework and were endorsed by ADB Management (Table 3).  \n \n\nimplementing  agencies \n\nthe  executing  and \n\nTable 3: Refined Subprogram 3 Triggers \n\nOriginal Trigger \n\nRevised Trigger \n\nReasons for the Proposed Change \n\ni.

These are to be \nundertaken in 2008\u20132010 to help upgrade the \nnational payment and settlement system in \nCambodia. \n\nThe overall aim is to facilitate MFIs\u2019 access to \ndomestic funds. The arrangement with the \ncommercial banks to form a private sector \nwholesale institution will require a longer time to put \ntogether since foreign donor input is required. NBC \nconsiders that opening up voluntary public deposits \nfor qualified MFIs is a good starting point in addition \nto encouraging individual commercial banks to lend \ndirectly to MFIs and has pursued both. \n\nNBC requires additional time to ensure the \nprovisions of the draft revised law are compatible \nwith several existing laws before it is submitted to \nthe Council of Ministers. These laws include the \nInsolvency Law (2008), Government and Private \nSector Securities Laws (2007), Civil Code (2007), \nCivil Procedures (2006). \n\nMEF = Ministry of Economy and Finance; MFI = microfinance institutions; NBC = National Bank of Cambodia. \nSource: National Bank of Cambodia. \n\n \n \n\n   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n16 \n \n \nA. \n\nProgress in the Implementation of Policy Actions under Subprograms 1, 2, and 3 \n\n1. \n\nImprove Confidence and Financial Intermediation \n\na. \n\n1.1: Improve Financial Services and the Payments, Clearance, and     \nSettlement System \n\n28. \nA  modernized  payment,  clearance,  and  settlement  system  (PCSS)  is  necessary  to \nimprove  and  expand  service  outreach,  develop  money  and  interbank  markets,  and  support \nmacroeconomic  policy  implementation.  The  vast  majority  of  transactions  in  Cambodia  are \nconducted in cash rather than by check, and cash transactions are mainly in US dollars. Checks \nare mainly  used  by  companies  and  a  few  individuals  who  maintain  bank  accounts  and  are \nmanually  cleared  and  settled  through  clearinghouses  operated  by  NBC  (in  Phnom  Penh, \nSiem Reap,  and  Sihanoukville,  with  no  electronic  link  between  them).  Checks  are  presented \neach  morning  at  9:30  a.m.  and  dishonored  checks  flow back  through  the  system  at  3:00  p.m. \nSettlement from clearing operations is recorded in the NBC books at each branch office. In view \nof the  archaic  and  inefficient  way  that  the  current manual  system  operates,  NBC  places  high \npriority on upgrading the payment and settlement system because it will help build confidence, \nenhance  growth  in  financial  intermediation  and  outreach,  and  encourage  product  and  service \ninnovation.  Further,  the  rapidly  growing  economy  is  straining  the  current  manual  system;  an \nupgraded  system  is  required  to  support  the  larger,  more  complex  financial  transactions  in  the \neconomy; and moving from the cash-based to a check-based treasury accounts system would \nenhance public financial management capacities throughout government.  \n \nIn  2005,  Cambodia  enacted  the  Law  on  Negotiable  Instruments  and  Payment \n29. \nTransactions,  which  provides  a  legal  basis  for  negotiable  instruments  such  as  checks,  bills  of \nexchange,  and  promissory  notes,  plus  regulation  of  payment  systems.  The  process  for \nmodernizing  the  national  PCSS  started  in  2006  when  NBC  established  the  Payments  Policy \nUnit (PPU). With technical support from ADB, NBC developed a road map for modernizing the \nnational  PCSS.  Staff  of  the  PPU  consulted  with  banks  to  obtain  their  input  on  the  unit\u2019s \ninitiatives and to garner support for implementing the proposed road map. Under subprogram 1, \nNBC  signed  a  memorandum  of  understanding with  each  commercial  bank  endorsing  the  road \nmap to modernize the national PCSS. NBC implemented key actions of phase I of the road map \nto  modernize  the  national  PCSS  under  subprogram  2  in  2008.  A  prakas  on  check \nstandardization was issued by NBC in September 2008 after it was reviewed by all banks. An \ninterbank switch was launched in August 2008 between four banks and the shared visa switch \nwas  considered  a  positive  beginning  and  may  develop  into  a  more  inclusive  and  beneficial \nsystem in the future. \n \n30.  With a long-term payment expert funded by ADB, the road map to modernize the PCSS \nwas updated and adopted under subprogram 3. In addition, NBC has submitted a proposal to \nMEF for funds (about $3.6 million) under FSP II loan proceeds to upgrade the PCSS. An interim \nsoftware  solution  for  check  clearance  was developed  by  the  NBC  IT  Division.  Following \npreliminary tests with banks, the software went live in May 2009, accompanied by a set of rules \nand  procedures  to  regulate  clearance  and  settlement  of  checks.  Since  Cambodia  presently \noperates a decentralized system, with every bank maintaining both riel and US dollar settlement \naccounts  at  each  provincial  NBC,  this  interim  solution  is  considered  pragmatic.  The  PPU  staff \nwill  continue  discussions  with  commercial  banks  on  ways  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  check \nclearance  and  settlement,  on  issues  regarding  retail  mobile  phone  payments,  on  an  interbank \nswitch to handle retail electronic payments, and to identify practical solutions to enhance funds \ntransfer and faster bank settlement during subprogram 4. To enhance funds transfer and early \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\nsettlement,  the  PPU  is  developing  a  credit  remittance  payment  instrument  designed  with \nsuitable flexibility to be used as a direct funds transfer instrument; as a direct credit; and as a \ndirect debit instrument for government salary payment, utility payments, and settlement between \nbanks. The project preparatory TA consultants\u2019 advice on the importance of establishing a real-\ntime  gross  settlement  (RTGS)  system  has  been  deferred  because  a  core  requirement  of  any \nRTGS  is  that  bank  settlement  accounts  are  centralized  so  that  the  central  RTGS  has  a  total \nview, and total management, of the respective commercial bank\u2019s credit and liquidity exposure \non a real-time basis. Centralization of commercial bank settlement accounts is being planned for \nimplementation when the new core banking system is successfully implemented and rolled out \nto all branches near the end of 2010.  \n \n\nb. \n\n1.2: Enhance Consumer Access to Credit and Market Confidence \n\n31. \nTo  improve  the  quality  of  credit  underwriting  and  portfolio  management,  and  to  boost \nconfidence  in  the  banking  system,  a  credible  credit  information  system  and  supporting \nregulations are needed. With close cooperation between NBC and the Bankers Association, a \npilot  online  credit  information  sharing  system  (CIS),  using  negative  data,  was  established  in \nAugust 2006 to support the credit appraisal processes of participating banks. Rules, regulations, \nprocedures,  and  a  governing  structure  are  in  place,  but  implementation  has  not  met \nexpectations. Participating banks have reported that since introduction of the CIS they have had \ndifficulty uploading data and accessing the information online. A number of actions have been \ntaken under the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Program9 to improve the software \nsystem and build steering committee capacity to understand how the system operates. Several \nadditions  have  been  made  to  the  system  to  allow  \u201cno  cases  to  report\u201d  as  a  quick  option  for \nparticipating  banks,  which  can  then  trigger  a  more  focused  follow-up  by  the  CIS  steering \ncommittee.  Subprogram  1  helped  familiarize  stakeholders  with  the  system  and  addressed \nimportant  changes  to the  CIS  and  its management  structure to  enhance  effectiveness.  During \nsubprogram  2,  NBC  continued  to  help resolve  systematic  issues related  to  the CIS  and  at  the \nsame  time  strengthen  bank  compliance which  is  a  key  factor  in  the  effectiveness of  the  CIS. \nUnder subprogram 3, NBC added MFIs into the negative CIS system and plans to upgrade the \nsoftware to include other sources of credit data and explore the possibility of corporatizing the \nCIS during subprogram 4.  \n \n32. \nThe orderly development and expansion of the financial market requires knowledgeable \ncustomers as well as competent providers of financial services. It requires customers to be able \nto make informed decisions about the services they require and the type of financial institutions \nbest suited to oversee their financial transactions. Since 2005, all banks have been required to \npublish  their  audited  financial  statements  to enable  the  public  to  make  informed  judgments \nregarding where to place their deposits and with which banks to transact. Several banks have \npublished  these  annual  audited  financial  reports  on  their  own  websites.  Following  recent  high \ncredit  growth  in  the  banking  system,  NBC  requested  all  bank  auditors  to  undertake  a \ncomprehensive  portfolio  review  as  of  the  end  of  December  2007  and  June  2008.  These  audit \nreports  were  completed  by  the  end  of  June  and  September  2008.  Subprograms  2  and  3 \nsupported  NBC  in  its  efforts  to  promote  bank  transparency  by  requiring  all  audited  financial \nstatements of banks as well as new prudential regulations to be published on the NBC website.   \n \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB.  2004.

This market will \nin turn ensure that the Government\u2019s financing requirements and payment obligations are met at \nthe  lowest  possible  cost,  and  it  will  provide  key  information  to  financial  sector  participants \nthrough the development of a yield curve. NBC has been assigned the role of maintaining the \nregistry \nregistry  was \nestablished, with TA under  subprogram  2,  NBC  was  able  to  train  the  relevant  staff  in  the \nfunctions and operation of the registry. NBC and MEF jointly discussed ways to develop a short-\nterm  money  market  during  subprogram  3.  As  an  initial  step  and  for  liquidity  support,  NBC  is \ndeveloping  regulations  covering  an  interbank  repurchase  master  agreement  that  will  use \ngovernment  securities,  to  be  issued  to  all  commercial  banks  for  implementation  during \nsubprogram 4.  \n \n\nissuance  of  government \n\nsecurities.  Once \n\nthe \n\nthe \n\nd. \n\n1.4: Promote Outreach in the Formal Sector  \n\n34. \nBanking activities in rural areas, although not fully developed, are improving\u2014with MFIs \nproviding most of the formal financial services. The formal microfinance industry has undergone \na transition from the development model to a fully commercial model, although some funding is \nstill channeled from aid organizations and their affiliates. Nevertheless, by some estimates, the \ninformal sector still has a greater share by value and number of transactions undertaken within \nthe  economy  (especially  among  the  poor  and  remote  rural  population)  than  the  formal  sector, \nwhich  comprises  registered  banks  and  both  licensed  and  registered  MFIs.  To  help  obtain \nreliable data on the actual size and scale of the informal financial sector and an understanding \nof  the  size  and  depth  of  the  informal  sector  outside  of  the  formal  financial  sector,  a  national \nsurvey  was  jointly  undertaken  by  NBC  and  MEF  during  subprogram  2.  The  survey,  which \nconcluded in October 2008, provided useful information on nonlicensed MFIs and moneylenders \noutside the formal sector and their impact on the economy. It concluded that, while the informal \nsector  was  much  smaller  in  aggregate  size  than  the  formal  sector,  the  informal  financial \ninstitutions have the advantage of engaging in small-scale financial transactions on account of \nlower  transaction  costs  and  effective  recovery.  The  survey  results  have  helped  MEF  in \nformulating  policies  to  encourage  growth  in  MFI  services  and  products  while  NBC  improves \npolicies covering licensing and supervision.  \n \n35. \nThe  microfinance  industry  is  growing  rapidly,  with  assets  expanding  at  more  than  75% \nover the last 3 years. Rapid expansion of assets has put pressure on the source of funding for \nMFIs, as most of their capital and debts are generated from overseas sources. A recent review \nundertaken by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor also identified that the development of \ndeposit  services  by  MFIs  has  lagged  behind  credit  services  and  with  declining  liquidity  from \ninternational sources caused by the global financial crisis, NBC has decided to make domestic \nfinance  more  accessible  to MFIs  during  subprogram  3.  Firstly,  a  regulation  was  adopted \ncovering the minimum financial, institutional, and managerial requirements for MFIs wishing to \ncollect,  and  intermediate,  voluntary  public  deposits.  The  regulation  has,  among  others, \nincreased  the  minimum  capital  requirement  from  $62,000  to  $2.5  million.  Two  qualified  MFIs \nhave been granted licenses and two applications are being processed. MFIs without this license \ncan  only  raise  compulsory  deposits  from  members  up  to  5%  of  total  loans.  NBC  has  also \nencouraged  individual  commercial  banks  to  lend  directly  to  MFIs  and  five  banks  have \ncommenced lending (one in local currency and the other four in US dollars) to MFIs since early \n2009. NBC will continue to enhance growth in the number of deposit taking MFIs and encourage \nmore commercial banks to lend in riels to MFIs during subprogram 4. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nMaintain Stability in the Financial Sector \n\na. \n\n2.1: Update the Legal and Regulatory Framework for Banks \n\n36. \nAs  part  of  Cambodia\u2019s  efforts  to  strengthen  prudential  supervision,  update  regulations, \nand  ensure  stability,  NBC  issued  regulations  (i)  on  large  exposures  of  banks  and  financial \ninstitutions,  and  (ii)  to  amend  the  prakas  on  licensing  of  commercial  and  specialized  banks \nunder  subprogram  1.  Under  subprogram  2,  NBC  continued  to  review  and  update  existing \nregulations  and  introduced  new  prudential  regulations  to  ensure  banks  comply  with  the \napplicable Basel 1 core principles for effective bank supervision. Under subprogram 3, NBC has \nissued regulations on (i) corporate governance for banks and financial institutions, (ii) updated \nasset  classification  and  provisioning  for  banks  and  financial  institutions,  and  (iii) commenced \nwork on  the  internal  control  regulation  that  will  include  conflict  of  interest  rules  for  banks  and \nfinancial  institutions.  Further,  because  the  Law  on  Banking  and  Financial  Institutions  was \nenacted  in  1999,  a  comprehensive  review  of  this  law  is  needed  to  effectively  address  the \nfeatures  of  a  changing  domestic  market  and  the  reality  of  increasing  international  economic \nintegration.  The  review,  with  TA  from  ADB  (footnote  8)  under  subprogram  2,  took  into \nconsideration  consumer  protection  in  connection  with  the  use  of  debit  and  credit  cards,  bank \nsecrecy provisions to support development of the CIS, procedures for administering distressed \nand  insolvent  banks,  and  protection  or  immunity  of  bank  regulators.  Based  on  the  findings  of \nthis  review,  a  revised  and  updated  law  was  submitted  to  the  Council  of  Ministers  during \nsubprogram 3 and then to the National Assembly during subprogram 4.  \n \n\nb. \n\n2.2: Strengthen Bank Supervision Capacity and Adopt Measures to \nSustain Financial Stability \n\n37. \nUpdating  and  upgrading  skills  is  a  priority  area  that  must  be  an  ongoing  feature  of \ndevelopment  and  the  deepening  of  the  financial  system.  New  risks  will  emerge,  requiring  that \nskills  development  and  training  be  pursued  in  tandem  with  these  developments.  NBC  will \ncontinue  to  strengthen  and  upgrade  the  capacity  of  its  own  supervision  staff  to  be  able  to \nmanage  these  developments  effectively.  At  the  same  time,  NBC  recognizes  that  the  financial \nsector  is  still  in  an  early  stage  of  development  and  thus  will  strengthen  its  surveillance \nmechanisms.  The  IMF  has  been  providing  a  resident  adviser  to  help  develop  the  off-site \ncapability of the bank supervision staff and will continue to provide support until 2010. With TA \nof $1.7  million  (footnote  8)  that  was  approved  together  with  subprogram  1,  ADB  has  been \nproviding  technical  support  to  help  improve  bank  on-site  examination  procedures  and  skills  of \nthe  NBC  staff  concerned.  During  subprogram  2,  NBC  evaluated  staff  capacity  for  bank \nsupervision and underscored the need for extended  ADB support for bank on-site supervision. \nThis is very important in view of the rapid increase in the number and size of loans, and concern \nwith the quality of information reported by these banks. To continue supporting NBC\u2019s work in \nthis very important area, ADB approved TA10 together with subprogram 2 in 2008 that provided \non-the-job guidance to bank on-site supervision teams to undertake a detailed review of the six \nlargest  commercial  banks  during  subprogram  3.  The  results  of  the  on-site  inspections  have \nbeen  very  useful in  recent  analysis  of the  impact  of  the  global  economic  crisis  on Cambodia\u2019s \nbanking system and have provided important data to the off-site supervision team for follow-up.  \n \n                                                 \n10  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  Implementation  of  Key  Policy  Triggers  of  Subprogram  3 \n(TA 7185-CAM) attached to ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on \na  Proposed  Loan  for  Subprogram  2  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Financial  Sector  Program  II  Cluster. \nManila (Loan 2479-CAM). \n\n\f \n\nidentified  capacity  building  needs \n\n20 \n \n \nNBC  has  formulated  remedial  measures,  broadly  anchored  on  the  policy  matrix  and \n38. \nprogram policy framework, covering stronger sanctions to address potential vulnerabilities in the \nbanking  system.  NBC  will  closely  monitor  progress  with  implementation  of  the  remedial \nmeasures,  and  ADB  will  regularly  review  progress  reports.  Under  subprogram  1,  NBC  has \nfor  banking  supervision,  and \n(i) assessed  and \n(ii) strengthened surveillance and undertaken prompt corrective measures for banks that are not \nconforming  to  the  laws  and  prudential  regulations.  NBC  continues  to  require  nonconforming \nbanks  to  provide  progress  reports  and  promptly  undertake  corrective  measures,  and  these \nreports have been discussed with ADB missions. Further, NBC has reviewed its regulations to \nstrengthen  good  corporate  governance,  including  the  requirement  for  fit  and  proper  testing  of \nkey  bank  management  positions  in  terms  of  technical  qualifications  and  experience  under \nsubprogram  2.  The  regulation  on  corporate  governance,  including  the  requirements  for  fit  and \nproper  test  of  key  bank  management  personnel,  was  formally  issued  as  a  prakas  in \nOctober 2008. NBC continues to monitor the implementation of the above regulations as well as \nthe prompt corrective measures that need to be taken following an on-site inspection. NBC has \nassessed the feasibility of introducing rating agencies for the major banks under subprogram 3, \nand  concluded  that  it  is  too  early  to  introduce  rating  agencies  as  there  are  a  number  of \nprudential and disclosure standards yet to be adopted and implemented.  \n \n39. \nAs a reflection of rapid economic growth up to 2007, domestic liquidity has been rising \nrapidly, from a very small base, partly fueled by the surge in capital inflows from foreign direct \ninvestments and by the rapid growth of credit to the private sector. The inflation rate, sparked by \nsupply-side shocks, surged from an annual rate of 10.8% in December 2007 to 25.1% in June \n2008.  To  mop  up  excess  liquidity  and  avoid  an  inflationary  spiral,  NBC  doubled  the  minimum \nreserve requirement from 8% to 16% in July 2008, and favorably considered applications from \ncommercial  banks  to  place  excess  reserves  abroad  with  prudentially  approved  counterparties \nduring subprogram 2. Prior to introducing the above measures, NBC consulted the IMF in March \n2008  and  the  Bankers  Association  in  April  2008,  neither  of  which  had  any  objection  to  the \nmeasures. The above measures helped return bank lending growth to sustainable levels. With \nfood  and  fuel  prices  coming  down  in  the  later  part  of  2008,  combined  with  the  above  policy \nmeasures, the inflation rate has been reduced to single digit in early 2009. Since the beginning \nof 2009, NBC has taken substantive actions in response to emerging challenges on the banking \nsystem  from  the  indirect  effects  of  the  global  economic  slowdown.  They  include  the  easing  of \nmonetary policy by reducing the minimum reserve requirement from 16% to 12%, availing of an \noverdraft  facility  for  individual  banks  to  meet  temporary  liquidity  needs,  and  encouraging  the \nBankers  Association  to  support  the  development  of  an  interbank  market  under  subprogram  3. \nNBC will continue to provide periodic macroeconomic and financial data for ADB to monitor the \nperformance of the financial sector during subprogram 4.  \n \n\nc. \n\n2.3: Strengthen Prudential Supervision and Regulations for \nMicrofinance Institutions \n\n40. \nAppropriate financial regulation and supervision are essential to build resilience against \nfinancial crisis. Similarly, providing incentives and guidance to financial institutions could further \nenhance their operations. NBC made significant progress in building the regulatory framework \nfor licensing and supervising registered MFIs. It established a division for prudential supervision \nof MFIs within the Banking Supervision Department and issued several prudential regulations in \nthe form of prakas. Division staff has had some training through technical support11 from ADB to \n\n \n                                                \n11 Technical Assistance to the  Kingdom of Cambodia for  Financial Sector  Program Implementation (TA 4656-CAM) \nattached  to  ADB.  2005.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed \n\n\f \n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n\nundertake off-site and, to a limited  extent, on-site supervision. Under subprogram  1, NBC has \nissued  regulations  to  amend  the  prakas  on  the  licensing  of  microfinance  institutions.  The \naccompanying  TA  (footnote  8)  for  subprogram  1  also  provided  technical  support  to  help \nstrengthen  NBC\u2019s  supervision  of  MFIs.  NBC  issued  additional  regulations  covering  MFIs  that \ncan  mobilize  voluntary  savings  (December  2007)  and  management  of  foreign  exchange  risks \n(early 2008). The accompanying TA for subprogram 2 (footnote 10) continued ADB\u2019s support to \nstrengthen  off-site  and  on-site  supervision  of  the  growing  MFI  subsector.  With  the  growing \nnumber  and  overall  size  of  activities  generated  by  registered  money  changers,  NBC  is \ndeveloping a code of conduct for adoption during subprogram 3  and to be implemented during \nsubprogram 4.  \n  \n \n\nd. \n\n2.4: Enhance Legal Foundation to Support Financial and \nCommercial Transactions \n\n41. \nFor  financial  transactions  to  develop  beyond  basic,  short-term,  and  mainly  cash-based \ntransactions,  a  legal  framework  for  commerce  and  finance  must  be  developed,  updated,  and \nimplemented.  Progress  in  preparing  and  enacting  a  number  of  components  of  the  legal \nframework  for  financial  and  commercial  transactions  has  been  significant.  This  includes laws \non insurance,  accounting  and  auditing,  commercial  enterprises,  negotiable  instruments  and \npayment transactions, commercial arbitration, secured transactions, nongovernment securities, \ncombating money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and insolvency. Under subprogram \n1,  MEF successfully  facilitated  the  adoption  of  the  Law  on  Government  Securities by  the \nNational Assembly in September 2007. Most of the enacted laws have been implemented, and \ntraining curricula have been introduced at selected legal faculties to train legal practitioners and \njudges on these new principles. The Ministry of Commerce (MOC) continues to promote public \nawareness of new commercial laws at the provincial level and has been monitoring the progress \nof  training  provided  by  selected  legal  faculties  for  judges,  lawyers,  and  legal  clerks  during \nsubprogram 3.  \n \n42. \nLaws that were recently enacted require the adoption of implementing sub-decrees. The \nGovernment  has  developed  the  sub-decree  for  the  secured  transactions  law.  ADB  has  also \nprovided technical support to assist MOC with the drafting of a new law on commercial contracts \nunder subprogram 2. The new law would supplement the Civil Code provisions, include general \nprovisions  relating  to  agencies  and  franchising,  and increase public  confidence  in  the  use  of \nwritten  commercial  contracts  in  Cambodia  for  a  variety  of  business  transactions.  ADB  TA \n(footnote  8)  continued  supporting  the  Government  in  its  efforts  to  review  Cambodia\u2019s \nrequirements  for  a  detailed  set  of  rules  for  commercial  transactions,  review  relevant \ninternational models and approaches, and draft a new harmonized law on commercial contracts \nfor submission to the Council of Ministers during subprogram 3. Submission of the draft law to \nthe National Assembly is expected during subprogram 4.  \n \n\n3. \n\nPromote Good Governance \n\na. \n\n3.1: Promote International Initiatives on Combating Money \nLaundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n\n43.  Work toward combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism in Cambodia is \nsupporting  international  deterrence  efforts  and  standard  governance  principles.  This  will  help \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \nLoan  and  Technical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  Subprogram  III  of  the  Financial  Sector \nProgram. Manila (Loan 2185-CAM). \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n22 \n \n \nbuild  market  confidence  and  discipline.  Throughout  2005  and  2006,  NBC  and  the  Australian \nTransaction  Reports  and  Analysis  Centre  conducted  joint  training  workshops  on  combating \nmoney  laundering  and  the  financing  of  terrorism  in  general,  including  procedures  to  assess \nsuspicious  transactions  reports  and  the  roles  of  compliance  officers  at  banks  and  financial \ninstitutions.  They  also  conducted  an  assessment  on  combating  money  laundering  and  the \nfinancing  of  terrorism.  Subprogram  1  supported  the  Government  in  its  successful  efforts  to \nadopt the Law on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism in 2007. This \nwas followed by adoption of sub-decrees covering the appointment of the board of directors, the \nsecretary general to head the Cambodian Financial Intelligence Unit (CAFIU), and the authority \nto  establish  the  CAFIU  during  subprogram  2.  NBC  formally  established  the  Cambodian \nFinancial  Intelligence  Unit  (CAFIU)  with  five  staff  and  adequate  budget  allocation  during \nsubprogram  3.  ADB,  Asia  Pacific  Group  on  Money  Laundering,  the  Australian  Transaction \nReports  and  Analysis  Centre,  the  Bank  Negara  Malaysia,  the  World  Bank,    and  other \ndevelopment  partners  continue  to  provide  TA  that  has  helped  CAFIU  prepare  the  following \nregulations:  (i) internal  rules  and  code  of  conduct  for  CAFIU;  (ii)  CAFIU\u2019s  business  plan  for \n2009\u20132011; (iii) strategy and implementation plan for initiatives on combating money laundering \nand  the  financing  of  terrorism;  and  (iv)  sub-decree  on  combating  money  laundering  and  the \nfinancing of terrorism, covering all other reporting entities not regulated by NBC. NBC will assist \nin  adopting  the  above  regulations  to  help  enhance  the  role  of  the  CAFIU  and  coordination \namong supervisory authorities during subprogram 4. \n \n\nb. \n\n3.2: Enhance Corporate Governance and Transparency in the \nInsurance Industry \n\nBuilding  consumer  confidence  in  insurance  as  a  service  will  first  require  public \n44. \nunderstanding  of  the  insurance  business  and  the  services  it  can  provide.  Business  must  be \nconducted  as  transparently  as  possible  to  protect  consumers  and  ensure  that  information \nprovided to the public and the regulator is accurate. The goal for all participants in the industry is \nto  raise  their  operations  to  international  standards,  which  the  reinsurer  and  regulator  are \nresponsible for reinforcing. The Government and the insurance association can contribute to the \ninsurance  industry\u2019s  development  by  increasing  public  awareness  about  how  the  industry \noperates. The regulator can take a leadership role by ensuring transparency within the industry, \nas well as among the public and other government ministries. Under subprogram 1, MEF issued \nregulations on (i) premium rates for fire insurance, and (ii) licensing of general and life insurance \ncompanies. MEF also issued prakas covering corporate governance and solvency for insurance \ncompanies  in  early  2008.  A  prakas  on  accounting  guidelines  for  general  insurance  was \ndiscussed  with  international  accounting  firms,  the  National  Accounting  Council,  and  the \ninsurance  firms,  and  this  has  been  adopted  under  subprogram  2.  With  technical  support  from \nADB,  MEF  worked  closely  with  the  association  of  insurance  companies  to  ensure  smooth \nimplementation of the reporting standards, and revised the insurance law for submission to the \nCouncil of Ministers during subprogram 3. MEF will assist with the clearance of the revised law \nby the Council of Ministers, following which it will be submitted to the National Assembly. MEF \nwill  also  require  the  publication  of  audited  financial  statements  of  insurance  companies  during \nsubprogram 4. \n \n\nc. \n\n3.3: Establish Commercial Dispute Resolution Mechanism \n\nTo  promote  good  governance  and  boost  public  confidence  in  the  financial  system,  the \n45. \nGovernment enacted the law on commercial arbitration in 2006. The draft sub-decree is being \nreviewed by the Council of Ministers and once adopted, a national arbitration center (NAC) will \nbe  established.  The  arbitration  center  will  improve  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  the \n\n\f \n\n \n\n23 \n\n \n\ncommercial  and  financial  systems,  as  well  as  provide  the  commercial  community  with  a  cost-\neffective non-judicial process for dispute resolution. With greater public awareness of the NAC\u2019s \nfunctioning, confidence in the financial sector should increase. Before the center can commence \noperation, however, members of the judiciary, legal profession, and management personnel will \nneed to be trained. The TA under subprogram 2 supported MOC\u2019s efforts to establish a national \narbitration  center  by  developing  and  adopting  the  implementing  sub-decree  for  commercial \narbitration.  ADB  TA  support  continued  to  help  MOC  in  selecting  and  training  the  founding \nmembers,  establishing  the  Board  and  Management  structure,  formulating  the  rules  and \nadministrative  procedures,  and  adopting  a  code  of  conduct  and  operating  budget  for  the  NAC \nduring subprogram 3. MOC will continue to provide the necessary support during subprogram 4 \nto  ensure  the  NAC  functions  effectively,  and  will  also  ensure  that  programs  to  promote  public \nawareness of NAC\u2019s roles and responsibilities are implemented. \n \n\nd. \n\n3.4: Strengthen the Accounting Institutions and Professional \nCapacity of Members \n\nFor  efficient  financial  intermediation,  financial  market  infrastructure  needs  to  be \n46. \ndeveloped\u2014particularly accounting and auditing systems, with qualified personnel to implement \nthem.  In  2005,  only  10  locally  qualified  accountants  were  working  in  Cambodia.  In  a  move  to \nstrengthen  and  increase  accounting  and  auditing  capacity  and  standards,  MEF  introduced  a \ngovernment-funded  scholarship scheme  to  assist  at  least  70 recipients annually to acquire  the \nqualification  needed  to  become  members  of  the  Kampuchea  Institute  of  Certified  Public \nAccountants  and  Auditors.  These  scholarships  were  initially  awarded  to  government  civil \nservants only, but poor performance and a high dropout rate in the initial phase caused ADB to \npersuade the Government to open the scholarships to the public in the second half of 2006, with \nselection  strictly  on  merit.  Results  have  greatly  improved  since  then,  and MEF  continued  to \nsupport this public scholarship scheme under subprograms 2 and 3. The last batch of 70 CPA \nscholarship awardees was recruited in 2009, so there will be sufficient program funds to ensure \nintroduce \nthat  current  awardees  successfully  complete \n35 scholarships for the 2-year certified accounting technician program during subprogram 4. \n \n\nthe  CPA  program.  MEF  will \n\n4. \n\nEnhance Efficiency in the Financial Sector \n\na. \n\n4.1: Computerize and Integrate Key Operating Functions of NBC  \n\n47. \nNBC\u2019s current IT system is not well integrated across the bank, resulting in duplication \nand inefficiency. NBC would gain considerable benefits in terms of its ability to provide a more \nefficient  service  to  the  banking  sector  by  implementing  an  integrated  system  that  initially  links \nthe  accounting  department  to  the  cash  management  functions  in  the  issues  department,  the \ncustomer  account  management  in  the  banking  operations  department,  and  the  foreign \nexchange  transactions  in  the  exchange  management  department.  Under  subprogram  1,  NBC \nreviewed and adopted the information technology architecture model for a total estimated cost \nof  $4.0  million.  MEF  has  allocated  a  $4.0  million  grant  to  NBC  to  finance  the  new  system, \nincluding the required hardware, and ADB provided two international consultants to assist NBC \nin  procuring,  designing,  and  installing  the  system.  Under  subprogram  2,  NBC  reviewed  its \nmanagement  information  system  and  commenced  the  procurement  process  to  acquire  the \nsoftware  and  hardware  for  an  integrated  accounting  system.  The  procurement  process  using \ninternational  bidding  was  concluded  in  February  2009  following  the  successful  conclusion \nof contract negotiations.  \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n24 \n \n \nImplementation  under  subprogram  3  commenced  with  a  kick-off  meeting  on  23  March \n48. \n2009 for NBC, the representatives of the three contracted suppliers, and the IT consultants to \nfinalize the implementation schedule. Installation of the hardware commenced in late April 2009 \nfollowed by the core software system upon completion of the gap analysis, product walkthrough, \nand  the  initial  functional  and  technical  training.  Final  testing  of  the  hardware  and  sign-off  was \ncompleted  in  July  2009.  The  operating  system,  Oracle  software,  and  database  were  installed \nand  signed  off  for  acceptance  in  July  2009.  The  product  walkthrough  and  functional  training \nhave  been  completed. The  go-live  target  has  been  set  for  February  2010,  followed  by  branch \nrollout  during  subprogram  4.  Expected benefits  from  an  integrated  accounting  system  include \nimproved application software for other parts of the bank, in particular departments that do not \nneed  to  link  to  the  core  banking  system  in  real  time,  such  as  banking  supervision,  personnel, \nand  economic  research  and  statistics.  Eventually,  the  system  should  also  link  the  accounting \ndepartment to the NBC branches, thus promoting financial deepening and operating efficiency. \nWide area network infrastructure will be established at NBC to facilitate real-time clearing and \nsettlement operations.  \n \n\nb. \n\n4.2: Upgrade the Capacity of Microfinance Institution Staff \n\n49. \nFinding  adequately  trained  and  skilled  people  to  meet  the  needs  of  a  growing \nmicrofinance  industry  is  an  ongoing  challenge.  Growth  puts  pressure  on  the  delivery  and \ncustomer  sides  of  the  business.  Capacity  development  structures  are  needed  within  MFIs.  In \nconsultation with the association of MFIs, the Center for Banking Studies will undertake a review \nof  its curriculum  with  the  objective of  expanding  the  scope  of  training  to  include  all  aspects  of \nMFI  business  and  to  increase  management  awareness  of  liquidity  risk,  interest  rate  risk, \nconcentration  of  credit  risk,  and  foreign  exchange  risk.  TA  under  subprogram  2  has  helped \nreview  and  upgrade  the  Center  for  Banking  Studies  curriculum,  and  added  two  specialized \ntraining  curricula  for  MFIs.  Under  subprogram  3,  NBC  evaluated  the  progress  on  capacity \nbuilding for MFIs, including supervision, and this will determine the nature of additional capacity \nsupport that is required for implementation during subprogram 4.  \n \nB. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $10  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \n50. \nFunds  resources  for  subprogram  3.  The  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  a  single  tranche  upon \nsatisfactory compliance with specific conditions indicated in the policy matrix. The loan will have \na  24-year  term,  including  an  8-year  grace  period.  The  interest  rate  will  be  1.0%  per  annum \nduring  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  thereafter.  The  ADB  funds  are  to  help  defray  the  costs \nincurred by the Government to implement the reforms outlined in the development policy letter \nof 26 October 2007 and the policy matrix as updated.  \n \nC. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management  \n\nNBC  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  and  MEF  and  MOC  will  be  the  Implementing \n51. \nAgencies for subprogram 3 and the TA. The financial sector steering committee will continue to \ncoordinate  program  implementation  among  government  ministries,  agencies  and  development \npartners  concerned  (Development  Coordination  Matrix  in  Appendix  4).  To  ensure  timely \nprogram implementation, the committee, comprising senior officers from MEF, MOC, and NBC, \nwill meet as required to review progress reports from the technical working group and consider \npending issues. The committee will propose concrete actions to resolve those issues. A senior \n\n\f \n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n\nNBC  officer  has  been  appointed  as  program  director  to  assist  MEF,  MOC,  and  NBC  in \ncoordinating  day-to-day  program  implementation.  The  program  director  will  be  required  to \nsubmit quarterly progress reports on subprogram 3 implementation. \n\n \n2. \n\nPeriod of Implementation  \n\n52. \nThe  implementation  period  for  subprogram  3  is  from  January  to  December  2009.  The \nGovernment  aims  to  complete  implementation  of  all  policy  actions  before  approval  of  the \nsubprogram 3 loan. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement  \n\nThe loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange cost (excluding local \n53. \nduties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  a \nnegative  list  of  ineligible  items  (Appendix  5)  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources. All procurement of goods and services produced in, and originating from, \nADB member countries will be made with due consideration to economy and efficiency, as well \nas in accordance with standard public sector procedures in Cambodia and normal private sector \ncommercial practices acceptable to ADB. In accordance with provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification \nof  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans  (1998),  the  loan \nproceeds will be disbursed to the Government as the Borrower. The Government will certify that \n(i)  the  value  of  the  country\u2019s  eligible  imports  is  equal  to,  or  exceeds,  the  amount  of  ADB\u2019s \nprojected  disbursements  under  the  loan  in  a  given  period;  and  (ii)  the  loan  proceeds  will  be \nutilized  in  a  manner  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  based  on  the \ncertification  provided  by  the  Government,  which  confirms  that  the  requirements  for  the  loan \nhave been met. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the \naccuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification. Subprogram 3 will provide for retroactive financing for \nexpenditures incurred by the Government up to 180 days prior to loan effectiveness.  \n \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption and Fiduciary Issues \n\n54. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  and  the  Policy  on  Combating \nMoney Laundering (2003) were explained to the Government. All relevant ADB guidelines and \nthe  loan  regulations  were  specifically  brought  to  the  attention  and  notice  of  the  Government. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire the Government to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls \nfollowing international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. All contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Program shall \ninclude provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of \nthe Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, and service providers as they relate to the \nProgram. \n \n55. \nAn assessment of the country\u2019s public financial management systems was carried out to \nbetter  understand  the  fiduciary  risks  and  determine  appropriate  arrangements  for  the  fiduciary \narrangements  of  subprogram  3.  Discussions  were  held  with \nthe  Government  during \nimplementation of subprogram 3 on the funds flow from NBC to MEF and the contribution of the \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n26 \n \n \nongoing public financial management reform program12 to the administration of loan proceeds.13 \nVery  satisfactory  progress  has  been  noted  in  revenue  collections,  with  greater  use  of  the \nbanking  system  to  streamline  revenue  collection  and  payment  processes.  The  redesign  of  an \nintegrated  chart  of  accounts  and  budget  classification  has  been  substantially  completed  to \nimprove  expenditure  tracking  and  reporting.  As  part  of  efforts  to  improve  governance  and \nreduce corruption, the Government continues to place significant emphasis on strengthening the \noverall  public  financial  management  system,  internal  systems  (including  internal  audit \nfunctions),  and  the  functions  of  the  National  Audit  Authority.  The  ongoing  public  financial \nmanagement  program,  which  started  in  2004  and  is  supported  by  10  development  partners \nincluding ADB,14 has helped lower the fiduciary risk of the system. \n \n56. \nA  core  component  of  the  FSP  II  focuses  on  promoting  good  governance,  deterring \nmoney  laundering  and  financing  of  terrorism,  and  implementing  measures  that  will  help  deter \ncorruption  in  the  overall  economy  (a  good  governance  framework  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix A). Subprogram 3 includes measures to improve the management information system \nand reporting standards within NBC, banks, insurance firms, and MFIs; promote transparency of \ninformation released by banks and MFIs; improve compliance with and usefulness of the credit \ninformation  sharing  system;  support  implementation  of  anti-money-laundering  regulations;  and \ndeter  activities  that  could  support  the  financing  of  terrorism.  Increasing  use  of  payment \ninstruments  other  than  cash  will  particularly  help  discourage  corruption  at  central,  provincial, \nand  district  treasuries.  These  reforms  will  help  keep  savers  and  investors  informed,  empower \ncivil society to monitor the weaknesses in these financial institutions, and deter those who are \nvulnerable to corrupt activities. \n \n\n5. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting  \n\n57. \nThe  Government  will  open  or  nominate  an  account  with  NBC  to  receive  the  loan \nproceeds  for  subprogram  3.  It  will  manage,  operate,  and  liquidate  the  account  in  accordance \nwith  terms  satisfactory  to  ADB.  ADB  will  retain  the  right  to  audit  any  account  and  records \nrelating to utilization of the loan proceeds.  \n \n\n6. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n58.        The  Government  will  use  the  local  currency  counterpart  funds  generated  by  the  loan \nproceeds  to  meet  program  expenditures  and  associated  costs  of  reform  and  additional \nbudgetary allocation to help ease the effects of the global economic downturn. \n \n\n7. \n\nProgram Performance Monitoring and Review \n\n59. \nThe program director (para. 51) will coordinate and submit quarterly progress reports on \npolicy  and  institutional  reform  implementation  to  the  financial  sector  steering  committee  and \nADB.  The  reports  will  be  submitted  in  such  form  and  detail  as  ADB  may  request,  and  include \n(i) progress  made  and  problems  encountered  during  the  review  period,  (ii)  steps  taken  or \n\n                                                \n \n12  ADB.  2008.

The Government and ADB will continue to \nengage  in  active  policy  dialogue  throughout  subprogram  3  implementation  on  macroeconomic \nissues  that  may  affect  financial  sector  development  and  on  additional  reforms  that  may  be \nnecessary  or  desirable  for  sustainable  development  of  the  financial  sector.  Not  later  than \n4 months after completion of subprogram 3, the Government will prepare and submit to ADB a \nprogram completion report. \n \n\nVII. \n\nSUBPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA.  \n\nBenefits \n\n61.  With  a  rapidly  growing  commercial  economy  that  requires  a  sound  financial  system  to \nsustain  economic  growth,  the  Government  needs  to  develop  the  financial  sector  by  mobilizing \nfinancial resources, channeling them to productive investments, and managing inherent risks if it \nis to achieve long-term sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. The Asian financial \ncrisis  of  1997  and  the  2008  global  financial  crisis  have  provided  many  examples  of  the \ndevastating  impact  that  financial  crises  can  have  on  countries,  wiping  out  several  years  of \ngrowth  within  a  very  short  time.  Thus,  to  promote  economic  growth,  reduce  poverty,  and  help \nCambodia avoid financial crises, subprogram 3 of the FSP II will support the Government in its \ndevelopment agenda. \n \nThe  policies  supported  by  subprogram  3  of  the  FSP  II  will  help  reduce  information \n62. \nasymmetry,  improve  governance,  enhance  financial  stability,  and  improve  efficiency  in  the \nfinancial  sector.  These  factors  will  contribute  to  a  more  conducive  environment  for  continued \nfinancial market development. Subprogram 3 of the FSP II is expected to help boost confidence \namong market participants and, with improvements to the payments, clearance, and settlement \nsystem,  financial  intermediation  will  grow.  That  will  result  in  a  wider  offering  of  products  and \nservices  in  urban  and  rural  areas.  A  sound,  more  efficient,  and  diversified  financial  sector  will \nsupport  higher  investments  and  productivity  in  the  private  sector.  Together  with  broader \neconomic reforms, reforms in the financial sector will contribute to higher economic growth. \n\n \nB.        Social and Environmental Safeguards \n\nSubprogram  3  of  the  FSP  II  will  not  entail  any  involuntary  resettlement  or  have  a \n63. \nnegative  impact  on  indigenous  people  or  the  environment.  It  is  classified  category  C  for \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  impact  on  indigenous  people,  and  impact  on  the  environment. \nSubprogram 3 of the FSP II is a general intervention aimed at supporting sustainable economic \ngrowth. In that respect, it is expected to have an indirect positive effect on poverty reduction. A \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 6. \n \nC.    Assumptions and Risks \n\n64. \nSubprogram  3  of  the  FSP  II  assumes  political  stability  in  Cambodia  and  sustained \nimplementation  of  sound  macroeconomic  policies  by  the  Government.  Given  Cambodia\u2019s \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n28 \n \n \nencouraging  results  in  the  past  decade,  both  these  assumptions  are  valid  and  defensible. \nImplementation  of  subprogram  3  could  face  a  number  of  risks,  however,  for  which  mitigation \nmeasures have been put in place.  \n \n\n(i) \n\nExternal  challenges  to  sustaining  economic  growth.  Cambodia\u2019s  economic \nprospects  must  be  viewed  against  a  number  of  adverse  developments  in  the \nexternal  environment.  The  unexpected  surge  in  international  energy  and  food \nprices toward the end of 2007 fueled higher domestic inflation in the early part of \n2008,  with  potential  knock-on  effects  on  consumption,  growth,  and  poverty. \nThrough a combination of fiscal and monetary measures that were introduced by \nthe  Government,  inflation  has  been  moderated  and  lending  has  slowed  down \nsince  late  2008.  Falling  energy  and  commodity  prices  have  helped  ease  the \ninflation  rate  to  a  single  digit  in  early  2009.  Conditions  changed  in  the  third \nquarter  of  2008  because  of  the  spillover  effects  of  the  financial  crisis  that \noriginated  in  the  US  and  Europe  causing  the  global  economic  slowdown.  The \neffects  of  the  global  economic  downturn  have  negatively  affected  Cambodia\u2019s \ngrowth  rate  since  the  last  quarter  of  2008,  through  reduced  demand  for \nCambodia\u2019s  garments,  falling  tourist  arrivals,  and  decline in  foreign  investments \nfor  large-scale  construction  projects.  As  the  garment,  tourism,  and  construction \nindustries are three of the four main drivers of growth, the economy is projected \nto slow down to \u20131.5% (from 2.5%) in 2009 from an estimated 6.7% in 2008. The \nGovernment has further eased monetary policy since February 2009. The fiscal \ndeficit  is  forecast  to  be  above  the  2009  approved  budget  to  create  space  for \nfiscal stimulus. Because of the uncertainty about the length and depth of impact \nof  this  global  economic  downturn,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  continue  to \nundertake  periodic  reviews  of  macroeconomic  and  financial  developments  to \nassess  potential  risks  to  the  financial  sector  throughout  subprogram  3.  These \nreviews  will  continue  through  the  program  period  for  subprogram  4.  Budget \nassistance through other program loans in 2009, including through this program, \nis being provided to bolster the economy\u2019s resilience.  \n\n \n\n \n\n(ii)    Weak  governance  and  corruption  in  the  sector.  Weak  governance  and \nincidents  of  corruption  could  erode  investor  confidence  and  prevent  the \nattainment  of  expected  sector  outcomes.  The  Government\u2019s  National  Strategic \nDevelopment  Plan  2006\u20132010  views  corruption  as  a  threat  to  sustained  growth \nand  development  of  the  country  in  general.  Backed  by  an  active  development \ncommunity,  the  Government  is  increasingly  taking  a  tougher  stance  against \ncorruption.  The  consensus  is  that  good  governance  and  measures  to  address \ncorruption are needed for a successful partnership between the Government and \nthe development community. This was considered during design of the program \ncluster, and there will be continuous pursuit of improvements to the institutional \ngovernance  structure,  accounting  disclosure  standards,  financial  transparency, \ncomplementary  legislation,  regulatory  updates  and  enforcement,  supervision, \nand surveillance of the financial sector.  \n\n(iii)  Weak institutional and human capacity. Some of the financial sector risks are \nassociated with weak institutional and human capacity. The same applies to the \nimplementation  and  enforcement  of  new  laws  and  prudential  regulations.  To \nmitigate  those  risks,  training  programs  have  been  initiated  at  various  training \ninstitutions established during the FSP I. Subprograms 2 and 3 provide financial \nsupport  to  the  institutions  to  help  update  their  curricula.  The  proposed  capacity \n\n\f \n\n \n\n29 \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\ndevelopment  TA  that  is  being  processed  separately  will  help  reduce  the  risks \narising  from  weak  capacity,  especially  in  the  implementation  of  all  prudential \nregulations and in addressing new challenges emerging from the lower domestic \ngrowth caused by the global economic downturn. With these design safeguards, \nthe integrated benefits and impacts are expected to far outweigh any costs.  \n\nVIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nA  program  of  annual  TA  projects  was  identified  to  help  implement  the  FSP  II  medium-\n65. \nterm program. TA for $1.7 million was approved with subprogram 1 (footnote 8) to support NBC, \nMEF,  and  MOC  in  implementing  the  policy  and  institutional  reforms  under  subprogram  2  and \nsome of the reform triggers and milestones for subprogram 3. A TA (footnote 10) for $300,000 \nwas also approved together with subprogram 2 (i) to further strengthen on-site supervision and \nsurveillance  of  the  banking  system,  (ii)  to  help  strengthen  off-site  and  on-site  supervision  of \nMFIs,  and  (iii)  to  strengthen  the  supervision  and  surveillance  of  the  insurance  industry.  In \nresponse  to  the  Government\u2019s  request,  ADB  is  processing  a  separate  TA  project  to  support \nNBC,  MEF,  and  MOC  in  implementing  key  reform  triggers  for  subprogram  4  and  thereby \ncomplete most of the FSP II outputs initiated under subprograms 1 and 2.  \n \n\nIX. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n66. \nIn addition to complying with and implementing the actions specified in the subprogram 3 \npolicy  matrix  and  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following  specific \nassurances, which are incorporated in the Loan Agreement: \n \n\nThe  Government  will  (a)  implement  the  policy  triggers  and  milestones  in \naccordance  with  the  schedule  of  policy  reforms  contained  in  the  medium-term \npolicy framework and as described in the development policy letter, and ensure \nsustainability of the reforms beyond the subprogram 3 period; and (b)  carry out \nall of its obligations as stipulated under the Loan Agreement in a timely manner.  \nThe  Government  will  undertake  all  reasonable  measures  to  implement  the \ntriggers  (reform  actions)  set  out  in  the  medium-term  policy  framework,  which  is \nthe prerequisite for processing subprogram 4. \nThe Government will keep ADB informed of, and will at least semiannually, and \nmore  frequently  as  requested,  exchange  views  on  the  progress  made  in \nimplementing  subprogram  3.  Furthermore,  the  Government  will  continue  timely \npolicy dialogue on this same frequency with ADB on macroeconomic policies and \nconstraints,  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other  multilateral \nand  bilateral  agencies \nimplementation  of \nsubprogram  3  and  the  overall  program  cluster,  and  will  provide  ADB  with  an \nopportunity  to  comment  on  any  resulting  policy  proposals. The  Government  will \ntake ADB\u2019s views into consideration before finalizing and implementing any such \nproposals. \n\nimplications \n\nthat  have \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\nX. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n67. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  6,286,000  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for \nsubprogram 3 of the Financial Sector Program II from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an \ninterest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n30 \n \n \nthereafter;

The era was marked \nby  a  rapid  rise  in  the  number  of  joint  ventures,  locally  incorporated  family-owned  banks, \nbranches of foreign banks, and state-owned financial institutions. This resulted in most financial \ninstitutions  being  poorly  managed  and  almost  half  being  considered  technically  insolvent. \nSupported  by  an  International  Monetary  Fund  poverty  reduction  and  growth  facility  that  was \nphased out in 2003, the banking system relicensing program (i) introduced a legal framework for \nbanks  and  financial  institutions,  (ii)  successfully  closed  all  nonviable  banks,  (iii) relicensed  the \nremaining  banks  under  strengthened  National  Bank  of  Cambodia  (NBC)  supervision \nrequirements, and (iv) initiated restructuring and privatization of the major state-owned foreign \ntrade  bank.  Cambodia\u2019s  financial  sector  remains  shallow  and  fragile,  with  limited  financial \nintermediation and outreach. \n \n2. \nAt  the  end  of  July  2009,  the  formal  financial  system  comprised  NBC,  27  commercial \nbanks,  6  specialized  banks,  and  2  representative  offices  of  foreign-based  banks;  20  licensed \nand 25 registered microfinance institutions (MFIs); and 7 insurance companies. Cambodia also \nhas  the  objective  of  developing  bond  and  securities  markets  in  the  near  future.  The \npredominantly rural nature of the economy, high transaction costs, and low creditor confidence \nhave  been  the  main  factors  resulting  in  low  formal  intermediation  and  outreach  within  the \nfinancial sector. There has also been a slow development of nonbank financial institutions, with \na limited range of products and services being offered. \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  vision  for  the  financial  sector  is  for  a  sound,  market-based  system \n3. \nthat  will  enhance  resource  mobilization,  ensure  the  effective  allocation  of  financial  resources, \nand  contribute  to  broad-based  sustainable  economic  growth  as  embodied  in  the  Financial \nSector  Development  Strategy  (FSDS)  2006\u20132015.  The  FSDS  recognizes  that,  for  equitable \ngrowth to occur, a diversified, competitive, but prudentially sound financial system would play an \nimportant  role  in  national  development  by  ensuring  efficient  accumulation  and  effective \nallocation of financial resources. At the same time, expanding finance brings risks. Hence, when \npursuing  financial  development,  a  focus  on  prudential  risk  management,  transparency,  and \nuniform application of rules and regulations is needed. \n \n4. \nDominated  by  the  banking  system,  the  financial  sector  has  gone  through  major \nrestructuring  and  reforms  since  the  mid-1990s.  In  1996,  NBC  was  established  as  the  central \nbank following promulgation of the Law on the Organization and Conduct of the National Bank \nof Cambodia. In 1999, the Government enacted the Law on Banking and Financial Institutions, \nenabling NBC to undertake a relicensing program that brought about the closure of 16 nonviable \nbanks  in  2002,  raised  capital  requirements  for  the  remaining  banks  to  $13  million  equivalent, \nand set the minimum capital adequacy requirement at 20% of risk-weighted assets (which was \nthen  appropriately  reduced  to  15%  in  2004).  In  an  effort  to  further  strengthen  and  consolidate \nthe banking system, NBC issued a directive in September 2008 requiring commercial banks that \nare owned by nonbank entities or individuals to increase their minimum capital to the equivalent \nof $36.5 million by 2010. The Financial Sector Development Blueprint,1 formulated and adopted \nin 2001, provided a clear set of objectives and a sequenced program of reforms in the financial \nsector.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  the  lead  development  partner  in \nsupporting the Government\u2019s efforts to implement the blueprint to improve financial soundness \nand  efficiency,  restore  confidence,  attract  a  broader  base  of  high-quality  financial  institutions, \nand broaden the sector\u2019s outreach within the blueprint framework. \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2001. Cambodia Financial Sector Blueprint for 2001\u20132010. Manila \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n45\n\n \n5. \nThe  economy  is  largely  cash-based  and  highly  dollarized.  Dollarization  emerged  in \nCambodia because public confidence in the local currency eroded following a series of shocks \nduring the conflict and financial mismanagement prior to 1989. In some instances, dollarization \nhas assisted development of the financial sector,  but, in other respects, dollarization limits the \ntools  the  Government  can  use  in  its  monetary  policies.  With  recent  improvements  in \nmacroeconomic  stability  and  measures  taken  by  the  authorities  to  restore  confidence  in \ninstitutions and in the banking system, public confidence is growing but slowly, and dollarization \nremains  high.  In  the  absence  of  reliable  data,  the  amount  of  US  dollars  and  other  foreign \ncurrencies  circulating  in  Cambodia  cannot  be  verified.  Thai  baht  and  Vietnamese  dong \nbanknotes are also widely used in some of the provinces bordering Thailand and Viet Nam. The \ncash nature of the economy means that even major transactions are settled in cash outside of \nthe banking system and paper trails are minimal.  \n \n6. \nThe private sector is characterized by a high degree of informality, and it is dominated by \nthe informal sector. Enterprises that have enjoyed years of operating without established rule of \nlaw prefer to remain informal. The tax regime is still very open to negotiation and the majority of \nparticipants  in  the  real  sector,  especially  in  rural  areas,  are  reluctant  to  enter  into  any  form  of \nformal financial transactions for fear of being exposed to the tax authorities. Private enterprises \nare generally family-owned with no separation between management and owners who usually \ndo not maintain proper records, including financial reports that can be considered reliable.  \n \n7. \nBanking system. No legal barriers are in place for the entry of foreign banks. At the end \nof  December  2008,  17  commercial  banks  had  majority  foreign  ownership.  The  commercial \nbanking subsector at the end of July 2009 consists of 27 commercial banks, 6 specialized banks, \nand  2  representative  offices  of  foreign-based  banks.  With  the  increased  number  of  banks, \ncompetition is starting to pick up and there is some evidence of market segmentation emerging. \nWith the exception of the Rural Development Bank, the banking system is almost entirely owned \nby  the  private  sector.  Most  banks  have  established  branches  in  other  urban  centers  and  are \nplanning to open additional offices in those areas.  \n \n8. \nAt the end of March 2009, bank branches reached a total of 355 throughout Cambodia \nand are mostly concentrated in large urban centers, but are gradually changing. ACLEDA Bank, \na former MFI, currently has branches in every province and a total of 226 sites provide banking \nservices.  Canadia  Bank  has  17  branches  outside  Phnom  Penh.  Five  other  banks  have  more \nthan  three  branches  outside  Phnom  Penh,  including  ANZ  Royal  Bank  (12  branches)  with \nautomated teller machines at each of its branches. At the end of March 2009, bank staff totaled \nmore than 10,012\u2014an increase of almost 45% from the end of 2007, with one bank (ACLEDA) \nemploying  65%  and  other  banks  employing  the  balance.  Technical  capacity  is  still  weak  and \nmost banks provide their own in-house training to complement the training programs offered by \nthe Bankers Association.  \n \n9. \nCommercial  banking  is  relatively  small  but  growing  quickly.  The  more  aggressive  and \nprogressive  banks  attained  average  year-on-year  growth  rates  of  57%  for  credit  and  4%  for \ndeposits  at  the  end  of  2008.  The  number  of  commercial  bank  loans  increased  by  127%  from \n2002  to  total  243,835  at  the  end  of  May  2009.  If  these  loans  were  all  to  individual  borrowers, \nthen  it  would  be  the  equivalent  of  providing  loans  to  1.8%  of  Cambodia\u2019s  population.  Total \nbanking assets represented about 40% of the estimated gross domestic product (GDP) in May \n2009.  The  banking  system  is  fairly  concentrated,  with  about  74%  of  deposits  held  by  the  six \nlargest commercial banks. These six also accounted for about 84.6% of total loans at the end of \n2007.   \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nCommercial  banks  mainly  offer  simple  services  to  retail  and  corporate  customers  in \n10. \nurban areas (time and term deposits, savings accounts, basic loans, domestic and cross-border \nwire  transfers,  foreign  exchange,  letters  of  credit,  etc.).  Specialized  banks  are  not  allowed  by \nlaw to accept deposits, and commercial banks had about 765,569 depositors (about 6% of the \ntotal population) at the end of May 2009. Most deposit products are short-term in nature and, as \na  consequence,  loan  terms  are  also  short  (average  3  years)  with  high  interest  rates.  Banks \ncontinue to rely on physical collateral and personal guarantee as loan security. More advanced \nbanking  services  are  being  introduced,  such  as  electronic  banking  and  private  banking.  By \nMarch  2009,  the  number  of  automated  teller  machines  increased  to  345  and  will  continue  to \ngrow as the number of debit cards issued reaches 377,871 (53% increase from the same period \nin  2008)  since  its  introduction  to  Cambodia  in  2006.  As  of  March  2009,  3,383  point-of-sale \nterminals  (21%  increase  from  the  same  period  in  2008),  which  accepted  international  credit \ncards,  have  also  been  installed  at  various  commercial  centers\u2014improving  direct  access  to \nfunds.  \n \n11. \nThe  noncash  payment  system  is  very  small  and  of  limited  sophistication.  It  is \npredominantly  paper-based  and  manual.  NBC  runs  the  clearinghouse,  which  operates  in  both \nriels and dollars. The riel clearinghouse as of June 2009 has 25 members (NBC, and 24 banks) \nand the US dollar clearinghouse has 29 members (NBC and 28 banks). Daily amounts passing \nthrough the clearinghouses average about $36 million, of which riel clearances represent only \naround  3%.  The  number  of  US  dollar-denominated  checks  cleared  per  day  has  steadily \nincreased from 1,640 in the first quarter of 2008 to more than 1,880 during the first quarter of \n2009. The first clearance is at 9:30 a.m., with a second clearance at 3:00 p.m. to handle returns. \nUnder  ADB  technical  assistance  (footnote  8),  NBC  has  modernized  its  clearinghouse.  Banks \ncan  send  their  balances  to  the  clearinghouse  electronically  through  a  web-based  network. \nInterbank settlement is by check drawn on the banks\u2019 accounts with NBC. The enactment of the \nnegotiable  instruments  and  payment  transactions  law  in  late  2005  and  the  issuance  of  key \nregulations  in  December  2006  provided  the  legal  framework  for  developing  the  payments \nsystem, introducing new negotiable instruments, and promoting the development of money and \ninterbank markets.  \n \n12. \nNBC\u2019s  principal  mission  is  to  formulate  and  implement  monetary  policy  aimed  at \nmaintaining  price  stability  and  economic  development.  Its  main  functions  are  to  (i)  act  as  the \nmonetary authority and conduct monetary policy (NBC has intervened in the foreign exchange \nmarket to deliver a stable exchange rate and ensure price stability in riels), (ii) act as the sole \nissuer  of  the  national  currency  (as  such  NBC  has  increased  the  number  of  currency \ndenominations and replaced worn and dirty bank notes), (iii) act as the supervisory authority of \nthe  banking  and  financial  system,  (iv)  oversee  the  payments  system  in  Cambodia,  and  \n(v) manage the international reserves of the country.    \n \nThe banking supervision program and standards have greatly improved since 2001 and \n13. \nhave been extended to cover all banks\u2014a move made possible with the addition of skilled staff. \nPrudential supervision was enhanced with the adoption of the uniform chart of accounts by all \nbanks in 2004, and by the same banks making their annual audited financial statements publicly \navailable since 2005. Most banks have published these annual audited financial statements on \ntheir  own  websites.  In  2006,  NBC  enhanced  its  regulatory  and  supervisory  system  by \nimplementing  an  off-site  supervision  system  known  as  Cambodian  Bank  Reporting  for  Prompt \nCorrective Action. The system enables staff to perform a regular analysis of off-site reports, to \nidentify  risks  faced  by  banks  and  infringements  caused  by  banks,  and  then  for  the  staff \nconcerned  to  recommend  immediate  actions  to  NBC  management.  The  development  and \nimplementation of the system has been supported by a resident adviser from the International \nMonetary Fund. NBC continues to undertake on-site inspection of each bank once a year. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n47\n\ntransitioned \n\nlicensing  commenced \n\nin  2002.  A  number  have \n\n \n14. \nBanking,  along  with  other  financial  and  commercial  subsectors,  continues  to  face  high \ntransaction  costs  attributable  to  the  high  costs  of  funds  and  absence  of  reliable  information  to \nassess risks. The establishment of the credit information sharing system in 2006 should improve \nthe  situation,  but  some  time  will  be  required  to  build  a  sufficient  database.  Dispute  settlement \nremains a concern and, if unresolved, will continue to affect the degree of certainty associated \nwith  financial  and  commercial  transactions.  Financial  sector  stakeholders  would  undoubtedly \nwelcome  the  operations  of  a  commercial  court  that  is  being  developed  by  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme and other bilateral development partners and a commercial arbitration \ncenter being established by ADB, to provide a greater degree of certainty. \n \n15.  Microfinance  subsector.  Microfinance  is  growing  rapidly,  with  assets  expanding \ngenerally  at  around  87%  in  2008  and  some  institutions  expanding  at  143%  per  annum.  The \nexpansion  is  allowing  microfinance  to  support  and  grow  the  economy,  especially  in  its  target \nmarket of the poor and remote rural population. The microfinance subsector at the end of July \n2009  comprises  20  licensed  MFIs,  25  registered  rural  credit  operations,  and  around \n60 nongovernment organizations operating unrestricted across the whole country.  Registration \nand \nfrom  aid-focused \nnongovernment organizations to commercial MFIs, and some were set up as commercial, profit-\noriented  MFIs  from  the  outset.  Most  MFIs  have  plans  to  continue  rapid  expansion,  with  the \nestablishment of additional branches and increased lending activities at existing branches. \n \n16. \nAs  of  the  end  of  May  2009,  MFIs  had  around  807,335  clients  (about  6%  of  the  total \npopulation)  and  loans  outstanding  with  an  average  size  of  $305.  The  expansion  in  the  net \nnumber of loans is currently around 23% per annum. Voluntary savings of MFIs are very small. \nLicensed MFIs have adopted a wide range of business models with good corporate governance \nand orderly market development to deliver their services and products. This was highlighted in \n2007,  when  Cambodian  MFIs  won  4  of  20  financial  transparency  awards  presented  by  the \nConsultative Group to Assist the Poor.    \n \n17.  MFIs  face  major  challenges  to  expanding  their  services,  such  as  competition  from \ninformal operators in their markets. The scale of this competition is anecdotally said to exceed \nthe  size  of  the  formal  financial  sector.  However,  a  survey  that  was  jointly  undertaken  by  the \nMinistry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and NBC in October 2008 concluded that the informal \nsector was much smaller in aggregate size than the formal sector. Further, the informal financial \ninstitutions have the advantage of engaging in small-scale financial transactions on account of \nlower  transaction  costs  and  effective  loan  recovery.  A  number  of  costs  and  challenges  are \nimposed on the MFI industry, such as nonresident withholding tax, lack of a reliable method to \ntrack  the  use  of  certificates  of  title  for  collateral  between  institutions,  and  extremely  limited \naccess  to  domestic  funding  sources.  Other  challenges  include  the  ability  to  control  business \nprocesses  when  the  scale  of  operations  begins  to  outstrip  the  capabilities  of  current  systems \nand processes. Foreign borrowing brings growth and benefits in terms of improved governance \nand  transparency,  but  foreign  borrowing  brings  growing  foreign  exchange  risk  as  institutions \nincrease their lending in the riel-based rural areas. \n \n18.  Money  changers.  In  addition  to  banks,  the  Law  on  Foreign  Exchange,  1997,  allows \nindividuals and legal entities to undertake currency exchange if they register with NBC. They are \nnot allowed to undertake any other financial activity. As of the end of May 2009, the country had \n650 registered money changers. Statistics on the transactions undertaken by money changers \nare not available. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nInsurance  subsector.  The Department of Financial Industry within MEF is responsible \n19. \nfor prudential regulation and supervision of the insurance industry, which consists of one state-\nowned  (Caminco)  and  four  private  nonlife  insurance  companies  plus  a  reinsurance  company \nthat is 80% state-owned. The sale of 75% of Caminco\u2019s shares to a joint venture comprising an \ninsurance firm from Thailand and a Cambodian investor was concluded in November 2008. The \ninsurance  industry  is  young  and  small.  It  has  gone  through  a  turbulent  period,  but  with  the \nintroduction of regulations and the enforcement of those regulations, stability and growth have \nreturned. The regulator requires the capital of each company to be distributed as follows: 10% \ndeposited with NBC, 50% deposited in commercial banks, with the decision on how to invest the \n40%  balance  left  to  the  insurance  company  concerned.  Insurance  companies  have  indicated \nthat  they  would  like  these  ratios  to  be  changed,  and  the  40%  increased.  A  revision  of  the \ninsurance  law  has  been  initiated  by  MEF  with  technical  support  from  ADB.  The  draft  revised \ninsurance law will be submitted to the Council of Ministers in 2009. \n \n20. \nGrowth has been steady (averaging 11%\u201315% in the last 3 years) from a limited range \nof insurance products. The total gross premiums increased from $17.5 million at the end of 2007 \nto  $20.6  million  at  the  end  of  2008.  The  three  nonlife  categories  of  insurance  products \n(commercial  vehicles,  construction  sites,  and  passenger  vehicle  liabilities)  underwritten  in  this \nmarket are compulsory by regulation. Growth has been steady since 2003, with commercial fire \nand  miscellaneous  policies  making  up  63%  of  the  market  and  motor  vehicle  insurance  19%. \nOther  products  sold  include  hospital  and  surgical,  personal  and  accident,  marine  cargo,  and \ntravelers  insurance.  The  insurance  companies  operating  in  Cambodia  are  conservatively \nmanaged.   \n \nThe  insurance  industry  requires  a  number  of  specialist  skills  that  are  not  required  in \n21. \nother industries. As insurance is a fairly new concept in Cambodia, these specialist skills are not \navailable and need to be acquired (e.g., the skills of underwriters, actuaries, loss adjustors, and \nfund  managers).  The  framework  for  insurance  supervision  has  been  developed,  but  some \ndeficiencies in terms of capacity for supervision remain and ADB TA during the FSP II has been \nprogressively building staff capacity.  \n \n22. \nCapital  market.  Cambodia  has  no  bond  and  securities  markets.  The  Law  on \nGovernment  Securities  was  promulgated  by  the  King  on  10  January  2007  and  the  Law  on \nIssuance  and  Trading  of  nongovernment  securities  was  subsequently  promulgated  on \n19 October  2007.  Two  sub-decrees  have  been  adopted  to  help  implement  the  latter  law:  the \nSubdecree  on  Organization  and  Functioning  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  of \nCambodia  (SECC)  dated  23  July  2008,  and  the  Subdecree  on  Implementation  of  the  Law  on \nTrading  of  nongovernment  securities  dated  8  April  2009.  The  most  recent  short-term \ngovernment  securities  were  issued  in  2005.  The  placement  of  government  securities  is  jointly \norganized  by  NBC  and  the  commercial  banks.  MEF  in  April  2007  signed  a  memorandum  of \nunderstanding with the Korea International Cooperation Agency for $1.8 million worth of TA to \nhelp  with  the  initial  training  and  preparation  for  establishing  a  securities  market.  The \nGovernment  has  established  the  SECC  on  29  April  2009  to  oversee  the  preparations  for  the \neventual establishment of the securities market in the near future. SECC signed a memorandum \nof understanding on 31 July 2009 with the Australian Business Volunteers to provide TA to staff \nof SECC. \n \n23. \nAccounting  and  auditing  infrastructure.  The  continuing  growth  of  the  commercial \nsector  and  the  plan  for  a  Cambodia  stock  market  in  the  near  future  are  creating  significant \nchallenges to improving the quality of accounting and auditing, as well as to producing sufficient \nnumbers of qualified accountants. Cambodia has established a legal and regulatory framework \nfor accounting and auditing, but there are implementing weakness still to be overcome such as \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n49\n\nthe  enforcement  of  the  accounting  and  auditing  standards.  As  of  May  2008,  20  Cambodian \naccounting  standards  and  10  Cambodian  auditing  standards  have  been  introduced  based  on \ninternational  standards.  A  standards  advisory  body  and  a  local  institute  of  accountants  have \nbeen  established  to  oversee  the  implementation  of  these  standards.  In  January  2009,  MEF \nissued a prakas (footnote 7) on the promulgation of Cambodian Financial Reporting Standards \nbased on the International Financial Reporting Standards. In addition, the National Accounting \nCouncil is working on developing accounting standards for small and medium-sized enterprises \n(SMEs) based on international standards and best practice. The World Bank is providing TA to \nthe National Accounting Council to help revise and update the accounting law, and review the \naccounting  framework  with  the  intention  to  improve  the  enforcement  of  the  accounting  and \nauditing standards. \n \nThe  accounting  profession  is  in  its  infancy.  As  of  June  2009,  the  27  public  accounting \n24. \nand auditing firms employed 82 resident qualified accountants\u201425 of whom are locally qualified. \nCurrently,  more than 20,000 companies are registered and the number  is growing. The public \naccounting firms have few, if any, local clients. To date, more than 1,300 students have enrolled \nin the international certified public accountant (CPA) qualification course and almost 400 in the \ncertified  accounting  technician  course,  but  about  30%  of  the  total  CPA  intake  and  20%  of  the \ntotal  certified  accounting  technician  intake  have  dropped  out  for  various  reasons.  The  World \nBank is providing the Kampuchea Institute of Certified Public Accountants and Auditors with TA \nto  help  develop  an  accounting  degree  curriculum  benchmarked  on  international  standards  for \nlocal  universities,  and  review  the  current  method  of  assessing  accounting  and  auditing  firms \nwith  the  intention  of  formulating  a  quality  assurance  framework  for  assessing  accounting  and \nauditing firms. \n \n25. \nLegal  infrastructure.  An  enabling  legal  framework  for  financial  and  commercial \ntransactions  could  be  achieved  by  continuing  support  for  Cambodia\u2019s  process  of  law  reform, \nincluding  for  the  adoption  and  implementation  of  core  financial  and  commercial  laws  that  are \nharmonized  and  aligned  with  the  legal  system.  The  law  reform  process  in  financial  and \ncommercial  areas  aims  to  create  an  enabling  environment  for  the  financial  sector  and  for \neconomic growth in general. The Government has taken important steps to prepare, adopt, and \nimplement  certain  major  laws.  The  second  stage  of  development  is  for  additions  and \nrefinements to be made to the legal framework. \n \n26. \nThe  process  for  enacting  a  new  law  is  subject  to  several  documented  steps.  In  a \ncommon situation, where an international legal expert has provided assistance and produced a \ndraft document in English, the translation into Khmer would take a minimum of 2\u20133 weeks. Then \nthe  process  of  internal  debate  and  consultation  is  held  within  the  ministry  responsible  for \nintroducing the new law. Following these steps, the procedures pertaining to passage of the law \nthrough  the  Council  of  Ministers  and  National  Assembly  are  usually  lengthy:  approval  by  the \nCouncil  of Ministers  typically  takes  at  least  6 months  (but  usually  longer),  and  the  process  for \nsubmission  to  the  National  Assembly  and  the  approval  process  within  the  assembly  itself  are \nestimated to take about 1 year. Consequently, delay is always a risk at any given stage of the \nlegislative process. \n \nThe current court process for the enforcement of collateral is seen as lengthy, uncertain, \n27. \nand subject to delays (including for the appeals process). The current situation calls for urgent \nstrengthening  of  Cambodia\u2019s  dispute  resolution  system,  as  this  is  a  critical  element  of  the \nemerging financial and commercial legal framework. The introduction of commercial arbitration \nunder  the  new  Law  on  Commercial  Arbitration  will  be  a  key  mechanism  to  enforce  contracts \nconsistently and resolve commercial disputes fairly. A new commercial court law sponsored by \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nthe United Nations and other bilateral development partners, still in the planning stages, has the \npotential to improve transparency and finality under clearly established court procedures. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n51\n\nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX \n \nCapital Markets, Corporate \nGovernance, and Public Financial \nManagement \n\nBanking and Formal Credit \n(including SME and dispute \nresolution reforms) \n\nAsian Development Bank \n \nFSP I  \nBudget: $30 million program loan \nTime frame: 2001\u20132007 \n \nLegal and regulatory foundation for \nbanking, insurance, and commercial \ndevelopment;

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Financial Sector Program (FSP) II will support the Government\u2019s continued efforts to strengthen the financial sector via a \ncombination  of  legal  and  regulatory  reforms,  targeted  capacity  building,  improved  disclosure  standards  and  financial \ntransparency,  and  establishment  of  key  financial  infrastructure.  By  promoting  the  development  of  a  sound,  market-based \nfinancial  system  to  enhance  economic  growth  and  the  creation  of  employment  opportunities,  the  FSP  II  will  be  pivotal  in \nimproving  financial  intermediation  in  Cambodia.  A  sound,  efficient,  and  integrated  financial  system  is  crucial  for  achieving \nbroad-based sustainable economic growth; it will help reduce poverty by increasing job opportunities, lowering the transaction \ncosts  of  economic  activities,  and  extending  the  outreach  of  the  formal  financial  sector  to  poor  and  rural  areas.  An  efficient \nfinancial system will promote private sector development and foreign direct investment. Beneficiaries are expected to include \nthe  poor  and  near-poor.  A  robust  financial  sector  will  protect  the  economy  from  unfavorable  exogenous  shocks  that  are \nbecoming more common in increasingly global financial markets and which have serious implications for the poor. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \nThe reform measures proposed under subprogram 3 of the FSP II have no direct impact on the poor or the vulnerable. No \nspecific element requiring poverty analysis was identified in the Program.  \n\nDesign  Features.  The  policies  supported  by  the  FSP  II  will  help  increase  financial  intermediation,  improve  governance, \nenhance  financial  stability,  and  improve  efficiency  in  the  financial  sector.  These  factors  will  contribute  to  a  more  conducive \nenvironment for continued financial market development. Subprogram 3 of the FSP II is expected to boost confidence among \nmarket participants and, with improvements to the payments, clearance, and settlement system, financial intermediation will \ngrow.  That  will  result  in  a  wider  offering  of  products  and  services  in  urban  and  rural  areas.  A  sound,  more  efficient,  and \ndiversified  financial  sector  will  support  higher  investments  and  productivity  in  the  private  sector.  Together  with  broader \neconomic reforms, the reforms in the financial sector will contribute to higher economic growth and poverty reduction. \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \nA sound, efficient, and integrated financial system is crucial for achieving broad-based sustainable economic growth; it will help \nreduce poverty by increasing job opportunities, lowering transaction costs of economic activities, and extending the outreach of \nthe formal financial sector to poor and rural areas. An efficient financial system will promote private sector development and \nforeign direct investment. Beneficiaries are expected to include the poor and borderline poor. \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nSubprogram 3 of the FSP II has no specific component that requires direct social analysis. \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nAll reform measures have undergone substantive stakeholder consultations before implementation and the Government  will \ncontinue to host the biannual government-private sector forum, which provides an opportunity for the private sector to raise \npolicy  issues  and  for  the  Government  to  respond  and  address  them.  Regular  policy  dialogue  with  stakeholders  is  to  be \nconducted during Asian Development Bank (ADB) review missions. \n\n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.
