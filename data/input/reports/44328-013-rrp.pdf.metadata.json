Subprojects  will  be  undertaken  to  (i)  enhance  the  efficiency  and \nclimate resilience of irrigation systems, and (ii) improve water resource management by building \nthe  capacity  of  government  agencies  and  of  farmer  water  user  communities  (FWUCs)  so  that \nthey  can  operate  and  manage  the  irrigation  systems  better. 2 The  project  will  contribute  to \nachieving  targets  defined  in  the  government\u2019s  strategy. 3 The  strategy  aims  to  develop  and \nexpand  the  country\u2019s  irrigated  land  and  manage  its  water  resources  more  effectively  by \nimproving  existing  irrigation  systems,  making  water  user  communities  more  efficient,  and \nreducing the vulnerability of the Cambodia\u2019s people to disasters caused by natural hazards.4 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nImproved  macroeconomic  stability  and  public  financial  management  reforms  have \n3. \nhelped Cambodia\u2019s economy grow during 2004\u20132014. Gross domestic product grew by 7.0% in \n2014  and is  expected  to  expand  by  7.4%  during  2015\u20132016.5 Agriculture accounts for  29% of \ngross  domestic  product  and  employs  72.3%  of  the  country\u2019s  work  force,  or  about  5  million \npeople. The livelihoods of 80.0% of Cambodians depend on the sector.6 Farming in Cambodia \nis  mostly  subsistence-level,  rain-fed,  and  devoted  to  paddy  rice  production.  Even  though \nCambodia  has  become  self-sufficient  in  rice  and  a  rice  exporter,  its  rice-based  farming \ngenerates low incomes for its people. Nearly one-quarter of its provinces have food deficits due \nto low agricultural productivity, and 16.1% of the population is undernourished, even though the \nannual paddy surplus now stands at 3.3 million tons.7 \n \n4. \nRainfall  distribution  and  river  discharges  vary  significantly  from  season  to  season  in \nCambodia,  which  makes  sustained  year-round  agricultural  production  difficult  and  increases \nvulnerability  of  the  farmers\u2019  livelihood  and  rural  economy.  The  timely  availability  and  efficient \nmanagement of water is of prime importance to enhancing agriculture productivity and achieving \ndiversification  in  agriculture  production  and  the  rural  economy.  The  deterioration  of  existing \nirrigation infrastructure is seriously compromising the government\u2019s plans to achieve these goals. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  the  Uplands  Irrigation  and  Water  Resources \n\nManagement Sector Project (TA 8702-CAM). \n\n3  Government of Cambodia. 2013. Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity, and Efficiency, Phase III. \nPhnom  Penh.  The  document  presents  the  5-year  policy  agenda  of  the  government  and  forms  the  basis  of  the \nNational Strategic Development Plan, 2014\u20132018. \n\n4   This  loan  meets  all  three  ADB  eligibility  requirements  for  approval  as  a  sector  loan.  The  borrowing  developing \nmember  country  has  a  sector  development  plan  to  meet  the  priority  development  needs  of  the  sector.  The \nborrowing developing member country has the institutional capacity to implement the sector development plan. The \npolicies  applicable  to  the  sector  are  appropriate  and  will  be  improved,  if  warranted.  ADB.  2003.  Sector  Lending. \nOperations Manual. OM D3/BP. Manila. \n\n5  ADB. 2015.

For  this  reason, \nirrigation scheduling, water gauging, and the designing of joint reservoir operations have been \nincluded in the project scope.  \n \n5. \nThe government\u2019s national strategy prioritizes the development of irrigated agriculture to \nensure  food  security  and  to  build  up  the  rural  economy.  Of  the  3.98  million  hectares  (ha)  of \nagricultural  land  in  Cambodia,  about  1.3  million  ha  are  within  the  command  area  of  2,730 \nirrigation  systems.8 Most  of  these  systems  are  either  dysfunctional  or  underperforming  due  to \nthe  deterioration  and  aging  of  infrastructure,  a  lack  of  resources  to  rehabilitate  them,  and \ninadequate  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M).  The  two  core  irrigation  systems  selected  for \nimprovement by the project have a total command area of 20,301 ha,  but only 11,935 ha of this \nland is currently being cultivated\u20141,015 ha in the dry season and 10,920 ha in the wet season.  \nThis is due to water not reaching the farms because design life of main and distribution canals is \nalready exhausted and they need rehabilitation. By ensuring that this land is better irrigated, the \nproject will increase the cultivated area of these two subprojects to 28,083 ha\u201410,912 ha in the \ndry season and 17,171 ha in the wet season. \n \n6. \nIrrigation  consumes  about  70%  of  Cambodia\u2019s  water. Water  availability  in  the  future  is \nexpected  to  have  significant  seasonal  variability  with  few  months  of  floods  and  long  spells  of \ndrought.  Efficient,  effective,  and  sustainable  management  of  the  country\u2019s  water  resources \nlargely  depends  upon  how  smartly  irrigation  systems  are  managed  to  match  the  use  of  water \nwith  the  seasonal  crop  requirements  and  minimize  the  losses  in  conveying  this  water  to  and \napplying it in the fields. Increasing public investments in irrigation infrastructure and introducing \nmodernized  operational  management  will  make  the  country\u2019s  irrigation  systems  more  efficient \nand  productive.  The  proposed  project\u2019s  interventions  will  enhance  agricultural  and  rural \neconomic  productivity  through  increased  efficiency  of  irrigation  systems  and  improved \nmanagement  of  water  resources  in  upland  areas  of  Kampong  Thom  and  Battambang \nprovinces.9 The  project  will  complement  existing  ADB  and  the  government\u2019s  investments  on \ndeveloping agriculture value chains in these provinces to maximize the returns from agricultural \nproduce to the farmers and rural economy.     \n \nThe  project  will  capitalize  on  policy  and  legal  reforms  and  institutional  strengthening \n7. \ncarried  out  under  the  ADB-financed  Water  Resources  Management  Sector  Development \nProgram.10 A  government  order  issued  in  March  2015  on  farmers\u2019  participation  in  the  O&M  of \nirrigation systems  will provide the basis for forming FWUCs  in the project areas and involving \nthem in the design, implementation, and subsequent O&M of the subprojects.11 This will ensure \nthe  sustainability  of  the  project  investments.  The  subprojects  will  be  selected  on  the  basis  of \ncriteria  outlined in  the  project  administration manual  (PAM)  that  aim to ensure their  economic, \nfinancial, social, technical, and environmental viability.12  \n \n8. \nThe  project  will  also  develop  synergies  with  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  Climate-Resilient  Rice \nCommercialization  Sector  Development  Program  (CRRCSDP)  and  its  Greater  Mekong \n                                                \n8  Government of Cambodia, Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology.

The  project  will  collaborate  with  the \nCRRCSDP  by  giving  farmers  access  to  the  improved  seed  supplies,  land  levelling,  and \nagriculture  value  chain  facilities  that  this  project  is  establishing  in  the  project  area.  The \ninstallation  of  hydrometeorological  stations  in  the  project  area  to  improve  water  resource \nmanagement will be done in collaboration with the GMSFDRMMP. The Ministry of Agriculture, \nForestry,  and  Fisheries  (MAFF)  is  the  implementing  agency  for  the  CRRCSDP,  and  the \nDepartment  of  Hydrology  and  River  Work  (DHRW)  is  the  implementing  agency  for  the \nGMSFDRMMP.  The  staff  from  both  agencies  are  included  in  the  project  management  unit \n(PMU)  of  the  project  for  coordinating  their  respective  activities.  The  project  will  also  explore \nlinkages  with  the  work  being  done  under  the  additional  financing  of  the  ADB-financed  Flood \nDamage  Emergency  Reconstruction  Project,  which  includes  irrigation  rehabilitation  and  flood \nthree  river \nmanagement  and  pilot  development  of  a  hydrometeorological  system \ncatchments.14 \n \n9. \nADB  has  provided  extensive  support  for  irrigation  rehabilitation  in  Cambodia  through \nindividual and sector projects, including some that incorporated policy development. It has also \nemphasized flood and drought management and mitigation in recognition of the potential threat \nfrom  climate  change.  ADB  provided  emergency  loans  to  rehabilitate  rural  infrastructure \ndamaged  by  extreme  flooding  in  2000,  2001,  2010,  2011,  and  2013.  Agriculture  and  natural \nresources,  particularly  agriculture  commercialization  and  irrigation  support,  has  been  one  of \nADB\u2019s  priority  sectors.  ADB  has  joined  in  the  cofinancing  of  many  projects  in  the  sector  with \nseveral  of  Cambodia\u2019s  other  development  partners, \nincluding  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement,  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  the  Australian  Department  of \nForeign Affairs and Trade, the Nordic Development Fund, and the Global Agriculture and Food \nSecurity Program.15 \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe  impact  will  be  inclusive  economic  growth  through  agriculture  and  irrigation,  in  line \nwith  phase  3  of  the  government\u2019s  Rectangular  Strategy  on  Growth,  Employment,  Equity,  and \nEfficiency  for  2014\u20132018  (footnote  3).

MOWRAM will be the executing agency. MOWRAM\u2019s DFWUC will be the implementing \nagency.  A  PMU  was  established  in  the  DFWUC  before  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance began. The PMU is headed by a project director, who is the deputy director-general \nfor technical affairs of the DFWUC. A project manager, who is the director of DFWUC, will assist \nthe project director. The PMU was fully involved in the preparation of the project. During project \nimplementation, the PMU will have 24 designated staff members from MOWRAM, the DFWUC, \nthe  MAFF,  the  DHRW,  and  the  PDWRAMs  of  Kampong  Thom  and  Battambang  provinces. \nMAFF staff will coordinate the land levelling and other activities to be provided in support of the \nproject  by  the  CRRCSDP.  The  CRRCSDP  will  give  the  project  access  to  quality  seed  and \nagriculture  value  chain  facilities  and  services.  The  PDWRAMs  will  be  responsible  for \ncoordinating  all  field  activities  with  the  FWUCs  and  the  DFWUC.  The  DHRW  will  coordinate \ninstallation,  operation,  and  data  collection  of  the  hydrometeorological  stations.  It  will  also  be \nresponsible for providing guidance to the PMU on operational challenges during implementation. \n \n17. \nA  steering  committee  will  oversee  the  project\u2019s  implementation  and  management  and \nprovide policy guidance. It will be chaired by the minister of the MOWRAM and comprise senior \nofficials from MOWRAM, the MAFF, the Ministry of Economy and Finance, and the offices of the \ngovernors  of  the  two  project  provinces.  Any  resettlement  and  land  acquisition  will  be \nimplemented  by  and  under  the  management  of  an  interministerial  resettlement  committee  of \nrepresentatives  from  the  relevant  line  ministries,  which  will  be  chaired  by  the  Ministry  of \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nEconomy  and  Finance.  The  committee  will  cooperate  closely  with  the  Kampong  Thom  and \nBattambang  provincial  resettlement  subcommittees.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  project \nimplementation, planning, organization, monitoring, and reporting and will be supported by the \nproject management and implementation consultants. The project will require 58 person-months \nof international consultant services and 610 person-months of national consultant services. The \nconsultant  firms  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Procurement  is  expected  to  involve  small \nand  large  works  contracts  and  goods  and  will  be  done  using  ADB\u2019s  national  and  international \ncompetitive bidding and shopping methods. An imprest account will be maintained at the PMU \nlevel  for  ADB  loan  funds.

Topographic  and  geotechnical  surveys \nwere  conducted  to  complete  the  feasibility  study  of  the  two  core  subprojects\u2014the  Taing \nKrasaing irrigation system with a command area of about 9,869 ha in Kampong Thom Province \nand  the  Prek  Chik  irrigation  system  with  a  command  area  of  about  10,432  ha  in  Battambang \nProvince.  Project  preparation  considered  (i)  various  technical  options  and  their  economic \nviability;  (ii)  the  rationale  for  the  proposed  design,  outcome,  and  outputs;  (iii)  options  to \nmaximize  the  irrigated  area  and  the  benefits  to  farmers;  (iv)  measures  to  minimize  adverse \nenvironmental and social impacts; and (v) past experience of ADB projects to make the project \nimplementation arrangements robust. The project will use a participatory development approach \nunder  which  the  beneficiary  farmers  will  be  organized  into  the  FWUCs  and  take  part  in  the \ndesign  and  implementation  of  the  subprojects.  The  FWUCs  will  also  take full  responsibility  for \nO&M of the secondary and tertiary canals. \n \nB. \n \nEconomic  and  financial  analysis  was  carried  out  for  the  two  core  subprojects.  The \n19. \nresulting estimated economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) were 22.7% for the Taing Krasaing \nirrigation  system  and  24%  for  the  Prek  Chik  irrigation  system,  both  higher  than  the  assumed \n12%  cut-off  rate  for  economic  viability. 18  Sensitivity  analyses  indicated  that  the  economic \nviability  of  both  subprojects  is  highly  robust  and  would  withstand  adverse  changes  in  key \nvariables, such as (i) an increase in the project\u2019s projected capital cost by 10%, (ii) an increase \nin the O&M cost of 10%, (iii) a decrease in overall benefits by 10%, (iv) a decrease in cropping \nintensity by 10%, (v) a 10% drop in the price of rice, and (vi) a decrease in yield increment by \n10%.  Since O&M  or the  lack  of  it  has  been  a  crucial factor  in  determining  the  sustainability  of \nirrigation investments, the EIRR was stress-tested further by assuming potential results of poor \nO&M: (i) a decline in the cultivated area by 10%, and (ii) a reduction in the life of the subprojects \nby 5 years. The EIRR dropped below 12% when these two negative factors were combined in \nsensitivity  testing.  Although  this  scenario  is  highly  unlikely,  the  project  will  place  special \nemphasis  on  ensuring  that  the  FWUCs  and  MOWRAM  provide  the  appropriate  O&M  for  the \nsubprojects.  In  addition  to  the  loan  covenants  for  having  O&M  plans  prepared  for  the \nsubprojects,  the  required  funds  allocated,  and  a  mechanism  put  into  place  for  collecting  the \nirrigation  service  fees,    the  project  will  conduct  a  study  to  determine  the  gap  between  O&M \nbudget  allocations  and  requirements  for  irrigation  systems  in  the  country.  The  study  will  also \nconsider such other aspects of O&M as staff capacity, contractor capacity, and O&M planning. \nThe study will form the basis for policy dialogue with the government. \n \nC. \n \n20. \nAll procurement to be financed by ADB loan funds will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). Project implementation, \nprocurement,  and  financial  management  will  be  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  standard \noperating procedures for externally financed projects. The overall procurement classification for \nthe  project  is  assessed  as  medium  risk  (category  medium).  A  financial  management \nassessment  concluded  that  the  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  level  for  the  project \nwas  moderate.  This  was  mainly  due  to  the  limited  capacity  of  the  PMU  to  deal  with  financial \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n18 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nmanagement issues, including delays in preparation of financial management reports, a lack of \nan accounting software, weak internal audit unit, internal control issues, and quality of external \naudit. ADB has provided support to strengthen internal and external audit capacity of the PMU \nthrough  a  TA  financed  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction.  The  existing  organizational \nstructures of the executing and implementing agencies are generally suitable for implementing \nthe  project.  The  fund  flow  arrangements  are  clear.  The  executing  agency  is  currently \nimplementing  four  ADB  projects.19 It  has  also  implemented  ADB-financed  projects  in  the  past. \nThe  experience  gained  from  the  ongoing  and  completed  projects  will  help  in  the  financial \nmanagement  of the  project. In  addition,  ADB  will  provide  specific  support  under  the  project  by \nengaging  consultants  to  build  capacity  in  project  financial  management.  The  project  design \nincludes mitigating measures especially related to internal controls and internal auditing that are \nsufficient to address the risks and are measurable. \n \n21. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  MOWRAM.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 12). \n \nD. \n \n22. \nBy improving irrigation systems and providing a reliable supply of irrigation water to the \nfarms,  the  project  will  substantially  increase  farm  productivity  and  enhance  the  incomes  and \nlivelihoods of beneficiaries. Only one rice crop is currently grown in the project areas each year, \nduring the wet season. This is because irrigation canal water does not reach the farms in the dry \nmonths. The project will ensure water supplies for cultivating a second crop in the dry season of \nrice,  vegetables,  and  fruits.  That  will  increase  agricultural  production  and  household  farm \nincomes almost twofold. \n \n23. \nThe project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. Total number of beneficiary \nfarming families is  18,349  comprising  88,075  persons,  of  which  51%  are women.  About  2,569 \n(14%)  farming  families  are  headed  by  women.  The  project  will  enhance  women\u2019s  role  in \ndecision-making  for  water  and  agriculture  management  at  the  community  level  through  a \nminimum  representation  of  30%  women  in  the  FWUC  membership  and  in  the  FWUC \nmanagement committees, and developing women\u2019s leadership skills. Their capacity will also be \nbuilt  in  improving  on-farm  water  management,  agriculture  practices  and  coping  with  climate \nchange.  At  least  25%  of  unskilled  laborers  employed  in  project  civil  works  construction  will  be \nwomen who will be paid the same wages as men for similar work. The project will also provide \ntraining for women in administering FWUC affairs, carrying out O&M, and managing water.  \n \nE. \n \n24. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment.  The  details  of \nprocedures  to  ensure  that  potential  environmental  impacts  are  mitigated  are  provided  in  the \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF). 20  The  EARF  and  the  initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  for  the  two  core  subprojects  have  been  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s \nwebsite.21 An  environmental  management  plan  has  been  prepared  for  the  core  subprojects  to \nmitigate the impacts during construction and will be made part of any civil works contracts. The \nEARF will be followed for an environmental assessment of any additional subprojects prepared \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n19 (i)  Water  Resources  Management  Sector  Development  Program;  (ii)  Climate-Resilient  Rice  Commercialization \nSector Development Program; (iii) Greater Mekong Subregion Flood and Drought Risk Management and Mitigation \nProject; and (iv) Flood Damage Emergency Reconstruction Project-Additional Financing.  \n\n20 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fduring  implementation,  and  an  IEE  will  be  carried  out  for  each.  This  will  ensure  that  these \nsubprojects  are  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  In  the  event  of \nadditional  subprojects,  environmental  management  plans  will  be  included  in the  IEEs  and  civil \nworks  contracts.  Adequate  resources  have  been  allocated  for  environmental  safeguards \npreparation, implementation, monitoring, and reporting. \n \n25. \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement. Because screening of the Taing Krasaing and Prek Chik irrigation systems\u2019 main \ncanals  revealed  no  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement  impacts, no  resettlement  plans \nwere drawn up during project preparation. However, distribution canals for the two systems are \nto be identified during project implementation and may require the acquisition of small strips of \nland.  To  ensure  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  government \nregulations, a resettlement framework has been prepared in close consultation with the national \nand  local  governments  to  guide  screening  and  preparation  of  resettlement  plans  for  these \ndistribution canals and for other subprojects that may be added to the project. If subprojects are \nidentified but assessed as category A for involuntary resettlement, they will not be financed by \nthe  project.  Adequate  resources  have  been  allocated  for  preparation,  implementation, \nmonitoring, and the reporting of any necessary resettlement plans.  \n \n26. \npeople live in the project area, and none are expected to be impacted by the project.  \n \nF. \n \n27.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.22 The  overall  benefits  and  impacts  of  the \nproject are expected to outweigh the risks and costs. \n \n\nIndigenous  peoples. The project is category C for indigenous people.  No indigenous \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures  \n\nRisks \nEffects of climate \nchange may damage \nproject outputs and \nassets in the future. \n\nThe planning and \nfunding of the O&M of \nthe project irrigation \nsystems may be \ninadequate. \n\nThe project design includes improvement of drainage facilities to protect \nagricultural land and canals from flooding that may be caused by high-\nintensity long-duration rain events in the future related to climate change. \nIrrigation scheduling will be done to reduce impacts of future droughts on \nwater availability, and water flow measurement instruments will be installed \nin the canals to control supply and meet crop water requirements during dry \nspells. Farmers will be trained to grow low-delta, high-value crops and in \nclimate change adaptation. Joint reservoir operations will be designed and \nadopted. \nMOWRAM has established a sustainable funding mechanism for O&M. A \ncomprehensive O&M plan was prepared and integrated with the policy and \nimplementation manual for O&M of irrigation schemes prepared under the \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s Water Resources Management Sector \nDevelopment Program.a The plan was approved by the MEF, and the MEF \nsubsequently allocated the equivalent of $8.0 million for O&M of irrigation \nschemes in 2015. Training to build the capacity of the staff of MOWRAM and \nthe PDWRAMs to plan budgets and O&M was also provided under the \nprogram in 2014 and 2015. O&M budgeting has been mainstreamed into the \nannual budget planning of MOWRAM. \nO&M cost of the subprojects will be estimated, and maintenance plans will \nbe prepared by the implementing agency with support of the PMIC and \ninvolvement of FWUCs at the time of the design and cost estimates of the \n\n                                                \n22 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \n\nCommunication between \nMOWRAM, the \nPDWRAMs, and the \nFWUCs may be weak, \nadversely affecting \nproject implementation. \n\n \n\nMitigating Measures  \n\nsubprojects. Based on that, an average annual irrigation service fee per \nhectare will be determined. FWUCs will take responsibility for collecting \nthese fees and will use this revenue for the O&M of distribution canals. The \ngovernment will allocate funds in the annual budget for the O&M of the main \ncanals, and the PDWRAM will carry out the O&M. FWUCs will oversee the \nO&M of the main canals. The project will conduct a study to assess the gap \nbetween the O&M budget allocations and requirements for irrigation systems \nin Cambodia. \nThe DFWUC of MOWRAM has been assigned the role of implementing \nagency. The central and provincial departments of MOWRAM and the \nPDWRAMs have been made part of the PMU. Staff of the PDWRAMs and \nMOWRAM are included in the PMU in DFWUC. Therefore, the project will be \nmanaged and implemented under one roof. This will ensure that there are no \ngaps in communication or failures in coordination and that all implementation \ndecisions will be made by one coherent team. \nThe capacity of the PMU and PDWRAM staff involved in the project will be \nstrengthened by providing support from the PMIC and on-the-job training on \nproject implementation. \n\nWeak capacity of the \nMOWRAM PMU and the \nPDWRAMs could \nweaken implementation. \nDFWUC = Department of Farmer Water User Communities, FWUC = farmer water user community, MEF = Ministry of \nEconomy  and  Finance,  MOWRAM  =  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Meteorology,  O&M  =  operation  and \nmaintenance,  PDWRAM  =  provincial  department  of  water  resource  and  meteorology,  PMIC  =  project  management \nand implementation consultant, PMU = project management unit. \na  ADB.  2010.
