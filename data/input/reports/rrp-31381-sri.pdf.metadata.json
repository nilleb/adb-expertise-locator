These  PAs  are\nsome of the most species-rich and endemic-rich ecosystems in\nAsia, and are important catchments for major hydropower and\nirrigation  systems.    Surrounded  by  some  of  the  country\u2019s\nthey  have  come  under\npoorest  communities,  however, \nincreasing  risk  of  encroachment  and  exploitation.  To  protect\nthese  ecosystems,  the  Project  embraces  a  reform  of  the\nsector\u2019s  legal  and  institutional  framework  in  conjunction  with\nthe\ncapacity  building,  ecotourism  development,  and \nestablishment  of  a  sustainable  financing  mechanism  for  PA\nmanagement.    By  developing  and  pilot-testing  decentralized\nand people-oriented approaches to PA management, including\ncommunity improvement and benefit sharing, the Project will be\ninstrumental  in  establishing  a  PA  system  in  Sri  Lanka  that\nprotects  wildlife  biodiversity  effectively  and  generates\nemployment and income.\n\nPrimary:\nSecondary:\n\nEnvironment\nPoverty reduction\n\nCategory  B\nAn initial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken.\n\nthrough \n\necotourism, \n\nSri  Lanka\u2019s  high  population  density,  levels  of  poverty  and\nunemployment,  and  widespread  dependence  on  subsistence\nagriculture  have  exerted  considerable  pressure  on \nthe\ncountry\u2019s PAs. The PA system is central to conserving wildlife\nbiodiversity.  It is also important in supporting rural economies\nthrough  watershed  protection,  and  adds  to  the  economic  and\nthe  provision  of\ncultural  values  of  Sri  Lanka \nrecreational, \neducational\nand \nopportunities.  The  PAs  and  the  services  and  benefits  they\nprovide  are  currently  not  effectively  protected  due  to  weak\ninstitutions, lack of resources, inadequate managerial skills and\ntechnical capacity throughout the sector institutions, and lack of\ncooperation between conservation agencies. To address these\nweaknesses  will  require  efforts  particularly  in  the  areas  of\nhuman  resource  development,  improvement  of  managerial\nsystems and technical skills, and the provision of infrastructure\nis\nand \nfundamental  to  this  strengthening  and  the  development  of  a\nmore strategic approach to addressing conservation priorities in\n\nequipment.  Greater \n\ncooperation \n\ninteragency \n\nscientific, \n\n\fObjectives and Scope\n\niii\n\nSri  Lanka.  Effective  PA  management  cannot  take  place  in  the\nlong  term  without  the  involvement  and  support  of  the  local\ncommunities.  Similarly,  rural  livelihoods  are  dependent  on  a\nflow  of  natural  resource  benefits,  many  of  which  cannot  be\nsustained  without  active  protective  measures.  To  build  these\npartnerships requires a greater capacity within the conservation\nagencies  to  understand  and  work  with  local  communities.\nFundamentally, \nis\nnecessary to allow the communities to plan for their own future\nand interact with Government agencies and the private sector.\nPart  of  this  vision  will  involve  low-impact  use  of  PAs  and  the\ncapturing  of  benefits  by  communities  and  the  private  sector\nto\nthrough  ecotourism  development.  The  key  need \nstrengthen the sector institutions to manage PAs, in partnership\nwith and in the interests of local stakeholders.\n\nempowerment \n\ncommunity \n\neffective \n\nis \n\nThe Project aims at assisting the Government to conserve the\nnation\u2019s  valuable  natural  resources  and  preserve  its  wildlife\nbiodiversity for the well-being of current and future generations.\nMore  specifically,  by  addressing \nlegal\ndeficiencies  in  PA  management  and  pilot-testing  participatory\nadaptive management in priority PAs, the Project is expected to\nstimulate  nature-based \nthe\ndevelopment  of  a  sustainable  PA  management  and  wildlife\nconservation system for Sri Lanka.\n\ninstitutional  and \n\nto  contribute \n\ntourism  and \n\nto \n\nThe Project comprises four components.

The  PMU  will  be\nresponsible  for  day-to-day  administration  and  implementation\nof  project  activities \nin  cooperation  with  other  key\nimplementation  agencies,  civil  society  organizations,  and\nbusiness interests. A branch PMU will be established at each of\nthe  pilot  sites.

Given that\nthe  value  of  each  civil  works  contract  is  estimated  to  be  less\nthan  $1  million  and  in  view  of  the  competitive  nature  of  the\nconstruction  sector  in  Sri  Lanka,  civil  works  contracts  are  not\nexpected  to  be  of  interest  to  international  bidders.    Thus,  all\ncivil  works  contracts  will  be  awarded  to  prequalified  private\nsector  contractors  under  local  competitive  bidding  procedures\nacceptable to ADB. Contracts for supply of materials, vehicles,\nand  equipment  costing  $100,000-$500,000  will  be  awarded\nthrough international shopping procedures acceptable to ADB,\nwhereas those that are below $100,000 will be procured on the\nbasis of direct purchase.\n\nIt is anticipated that a total of 172 person-months of domestic\nand  128  person-months  of  international  consulting  services\nwill  be  required  in  addition  to  a  consortium  of  international\nNGOs.

Most  of  the\ndirect  project  benefits  relate  to  the  generation  of  income  and\nemployment opportunities in the impact zone of the seven pilot\nPAs.    It  is  anticipated  that,  initially,  40,000  households  or\n180,000  people  living  in  192  villages  near  the  pilot  PAs  will\ndirectly benefit from the Project.  With poverty levels in excess\nof  50  percent,  these  communities  belong  to  the  country\u2019s\npoorest.    Through  improved  PA  management,  the  Project  will\naddress  the  human-elephant  conflict  and  thereby  reduce  the\nconsiderable losses of crops and lives that the conflict causes\nevery year. With focus on natural beauty and wildlife diversity in\nthe PAs for the development of ecotourism, employment will be\ngenerated.  The development of ecotourism is also expected to\naid the conservation effort by providing an economic alternative\nto overexploitation of the natural resources of PAs. As a result\nof  project  activities  such  as  the  upgrading  of  park  facilities,\nestablishment  of  visitor  centers,  and  promotion  of  ecotourism,\nmore  tourists  will  be  attracted  to  the  project  areas.  Therefore,\nthe demand for nature guides and locally produced handicrafts\nwill increase.  The Project will also generate significant benefits\nthat  cannot  be  quantified.    For  example,  by  strengthening  the\ninstitutional  capacity  for  PA  management,  mechanisms  to  be\n\n\fvi\n\nput  in  place  will  ensure  that  the  country\u2019s  large  numbers  of\nnative, endemic, and endangered species and ecosystems will\nbe  preserved  sustainably  for  the  benefit  of  present  and  future\ngenerations.    Other  non-quantifiable  benefits  relate  to  the\ncarbon  sequestration  value  of  forests,  the  conservation  of\nbiodiversity,  microclimate  amelioration,  nutrient  recycling,  and\nscientific  research  and  education.    Further,  both  male  and\nfemale community members will acquire the capacity to better\narticulate  their  development  priorities  through  a  participatory\naction planning process.\n\n\fvii\n\n\f1.\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  a  proposed\nloan to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Protected Area Management and\nWildlife Conservation Project.\n\nI.      THE PROPOSAL\n\nII.      INTRODUCTION\n\nIn 1997, the Government requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for assistance\n2.\nto formulate a project to conserve wildlife biodiversity, to develop nature-based tourism, and to\nstrengthen  community  participation  in  protected  area  (PA)  management.  In  response,  ADB\napproved in December 1997 technical assistance (TA) to assist the Government in preparing an\ninvestment project.1 The final report was submitted in February 1999, and an ADB Fact-Finding\nMission  visited  Sri  Lanka  in  April  1999.  Subsequently,  the  Project  was  found  to  be  eligible,  in\nprinciple, for cofinancing by the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The World Bank, as a GEF\nimplementing  agency,  agreed  to  jointly  process  the  Project  with  ADB.    To  modify  the  project\ndesign to be consistent with GEF eligibility criteria and to initiate a policy and institutional reform\nagenda  that  was  identified  during  fact-finding,  additional  TA,2  to  be  financed  by  GEF,  was\nmobilized. A 15-member multisectoral Project Task Force that was appointed by the Minister of\nPublic  Administration  and  Home  Affairs  (MPAHA)  guided  TA  implementation.    The  task  force\nalso  took  the  lead  in  developing  a  new  National  Wildlife  Policy.  Consistent  with  GEF  public\ninvolvement  policy,  the  TA  was  implemented  in  a  participatory  process  involving  stakeholder\nconsultation through 15 facilitated workshops at the community, provincial, and national levels.\nSix  additional  workshops  were  held  for  policy  makers  and  Government  staff  involved  in  PA\nmanagement. A joint ADB and World Bank Appraisal Mission3 visited Sri Lanka from 17 April to\n3 May 2000, and reached an understanding with the Government on the Project\u2019s design and\naccompanying policy dialogue. The project framework is attached as Appendix 1.\n\nIII.      BACKGROUND\n\nA. \n\nSector Description\nSri Lanka is a tropical island of 65,610 square kilometers (km2), considered to be one of\n3.\nthe most biologically rich per unit area. Government policies and programs have resulted in high\nindices of human development; however, civil conflict has drained resources from the economy\nand  inhibited  growth  in  international  tourism  since  the  early  1980s.    In  1998,  the  average  life\nexpectancy  was  73  years,  infant  mortality  rate  was  15  per  1,000  live  births,  the  adult  literacy\nrate  was  91  percent,  and  the  primary  school  enrollment  rate  was  close  to  100  percent.  The\npopulation  growth  rate  at  1.2  percent  annually  is  low  by  world  standards;  however,  the  1998\npopulation,  estimated  to  be  18.8  million,  represents  an  average  population  density  of  299\npersons per km2 that is forecast to reach 371 in 2025.\n\n4.\nThe  population  is  78  percent  rural,  about  a  third  of  the  land  area  is  under  permanent\ncultivation, and marginal lands are increasingly brought into production.  Natural forest cover is\nless  than  22  percent  of  the  land  area,  and  deforestation  continues  at  an  annual  rate  of  1.1\n\n                                                \n1\n2 \n\n3\n\nTA 2942-SRI: Biodiversity Conservation Project, for $800,000, approved on 12 December 1997.\nTA  3273-SRI:  Protected Area Management and Wildlife Conservation Project,  for  $330,000,  approved  on  13\nOctober 1999.\nThe Mission comprised A. Ruthenberg, Sr. Sector Specialist/Co-Mission Leader; Sumith Pilapitiya, Sr. Engineer\nWorld  Bank/Co-Mission  Leader;  H.  Du,  Sr.  Programs  Officer;  E.  Fischer,  Sr.  Counsel;  R.  Dobias,  Sr.\nEnvironment  Specialist;  S.  Tanaka,  Social  Development  Specialist;  S.  Ranawana,  Project  Implementation\nSpecialist, SLRM; and Wandert Benthem, Consultant provided by the Government of the Netherlands.\n\n\f2\n\npercent  of  forest  cover  due  to  a  high  demand  for  fuelwood4,  timber,  farmland,  infrastructure\nprojects,  and  agricultural  land-clearance  schemes.  Local  authorities  are  predicting  catchment\ndamage, which means that serious water shortages are emerging and the trend is expected to\nworsen.\n\n1.\n\nSignificance of Protected Areas\n\nSri  Lanka  is  a  global  biodiversity  hot  spot.5  About  half  of  its  species  are  endemic,\n5.\nincluding  all  freshwater  crabs,  90  percent  of  amphibians,  25-75  percent  of  reptiles  and\ninvertebrates, around 50 percent of freshwater fishes, 26 percent of flowering plants, 14 percent\nof mammals and at least as many nonmigrant birds.  Species richness is extreme and, although\nlittle  studied,  there  are  known  to  be  over  3,368  species  of  flowering  plants,  314  ferns,  575\nmosses, 190 liverworts, 896 algae, 1,920 fungi, 400 arachnids, 242 butterflies, 117 dragonflies\nand  damselflies,  139  mosquitoes,  525  carabid  beetles,  266  land  snails,  78  fresh-water  fishes,\n250 amphibians, 92 snakes, 35 freshwater crabs, 21 geckos, 21 skinks, 322 nonmigrant birds,\nand  86  mammals.  The  island  also  provides  critical  habitat  for  internationally  mobile  species,\nincluding  5  species  of  endangered  marine  turtle,  about  100  species  of  waterfowl,  and  many\nother migratory birds.\n\n6.\nThe  PA  system  represents  the  ecosystems  that  support  these  species.    It  therefore\nprovides  (i)  global  benefits  by  maintaining  endemic  lineages,  species,  and  higher  taxa  that\nwould  otherwise  go  extinct,  ecosystems  that  are  under  threat  elsewhere,  and  populations  of\nmigratory species; and (ii) national and local benefits by maintaining biodiversity resources and\nall  the  use,  option,  bequest,  and  existence  values  associated  with  them.    By  safeguarding\necosystems  that  protect  important  economic  infrastructure  against  floods,  landslides,  soil\nerosion, and siltation, the PA system also generates substantial indirect use values.  The PAs in\nthe Mahaweli Development Area, for example, sustain 25 percent of the country\u2019s rice harvest,\nwhile 17 percent of the national energy supply comes from hydropower facilities that depend on\nprotected catchments and are fed by rivers arising in the PA system.\n\nThe  PA  system  contributes  to  enriching  the  lives  of  hundreds  of  thousands  of  Sri\n7.\nLankans  and  smaller  numbers  of  overseas  visitors \nthrough  provision  of  recreational\nopportunities.6  The  system  also  provides  the  resource  base  for  developing  the  globally\ncompetitive ecotourism7 potential of Sri Lanka. Development of ecotourism can generate greater\nsupport  for  conservation  and  build  partnerships  between  government  agencies,  the  private\nsector, and communities that help reduce rural poverty by providing employment and increasing\ntourism revenues. PAs also provide the prime outdoor laboratories for scientists and students to\nlearn more about the functioning of natural ecosystems. They also have the capacity to sustain\nfar  greater  use  as  a  resource  for  education  and  scientific  research  aimed  at  documenting  the\nnation\u2019s biological wealth.  By these means, the wildlife resources of the PA system can be used\nsustainably in diversifying the Sri Lankan economy and further enriching its culture.  Managing\nPAs sustainably will generate locally captured values that help improve the quality of life of local\npeople who currently have on average the least secure livelihoods in the country.\n\n                                                \n4  Wood provides about 57 percent of all energy consumed in Sri Lanka.\n5  Myers, N., R.A.

Nature 403:853-858.\nIn 1999, there were about 369,000 local and 79,000 international paying visitors to national parks.\nEcotourism  is  nature  tourism  that  includes  environmental  education  and  supports  conservation,  often  by\nenhancing the quality of life of local people so that they will not be obliged to extract PA resources in order to\nsurvive.\n\n\f3\n\n2.\n\nPoverty Around Protected Areas\n\n8.\nCurrent estimates of poverty indicate 21 percent of all Sri Lankans have incomes below\nthe current Government poverty criteria.8 Although abject poverty is rare9, current figures from\nthe  UNICEF  show  more  than  two  million  Sri  Lankan  children  exhibit  signs  of  growth  stunting,\none third are underweight for their age, and one half of all pregnant women are malnourished\nand  anemic.  Government  poverty  programs  have  focused  on  improving  rural  livelihoods  by\ndeveloping skills with extension and credit support, and providing infrastructure and marketing\nsupport. Despite these efforts, the incidence of poverty in rural areas remains high, and at about\n25 percent is higher than the 15 percent in urban areas. Previous poverty studies indicated only\nlimited  regional  variation  in  poverty,  but  preliminary  analyses10  of  more  recent  data  indicate\nlarge disparities in the incidence and intensity of poverty between regions.  All social indicators,\nincluding  access  to  electricity,  safe  water,  and  sanitation,  vary  widely  between  provinces,  and\nare  considerably  worse  in  the  plantation  and/or  rain-fed  agriculture  provinces  of  Uva,\nSabaragamuwa, North Central, and North West.\n\nAmong the estimated 1.5 million rural people who live close to a PA boundary, average\n9.\npoverty  incidences  are  typically  much  higher  than  the  national  average.    The  median  among\nvillages  studied  during  project  preparation  was  52  percent,  more  than  double  the  national\naverage  based  on  Samurdhi  participation  rates.    The  de  facto  official  poverty  line,  which  is\nmeasured  by  the  percentage  of  the  population  receiving  the  Government\u2019s  Samurdhi  welfare\npayments whose calculation is based on household income levels, is much higher in the villages\nclose to PAs.  Poverty is associated with not only low level of incomes but also lack of secure\nincomes  and  employment.  Such  insecurity  can  be  traced  to  an  unstable  resource  base,\nincluding  landlessness.  Landless  households  are  dependent  on  insecure  tenurial  agreements\nwith landowners; lack recognized land titles, limiting them to informal moneylenders; and obtain\nlow  prices  for  farm  produce  as  a  result  of  dependence  on  middlemen  and  lack  of  alternative\nmarket access. Thus, the overall pattern among communities near the PAs is one of significant\npoverty.\n\n10.\nLow  and  unpredictable  incomes  are  key  features  of  poverty.  The  resulting  insecurity\nmeans  that  many  households  have  at  least  one  member  who  is  searching  for  work\nopportunities,  formal  or  otherwise.    These  individuals  are  used  as  casual  labor  by  wealthier\nneighbors and outsiders, and are vulnerable to being co-opted in support of livestock grazing,\nlogging,  poaching,  and  gemstone  mining  within  the  PAs.  Demand  for  land,  tenure  insecurity,\nand lack of income all make the poorer and more marginalized members of communities close\nto  PAs  particularly  likely  to  use  protected  ecosystems  as  subsistence  resources,  for  farmland,\ncattle grazing, and fuelwood in particular. The institutions mandated with PA management has\nnot yet developed an effective capacity to respond to this situation, so there is steady erosion of\nthe  PA  system  and  the  wildlife  and  floral  resources  it  contains.    A  scenario  of  continually\nincreasing demand outside the PAs implies that protected ecosystems will be increasingly under\npressure in the future.  This highlights the vicious circle that unites human poverty with resource\nimpoverishment.\n\n                                                \n8 \n\nSri Lanka does not have an official poverty indicator.  For policy purposes, those eligible to receive SLRs500 or\nmore per month under the Government\u2019s Samurdhi program are classified as being in poverty.\n\n9  Defined as an income below one\u2018s \u201cpurchasing-power parity dollar\u201d per day, which applies to about four percent\n\nof Sri Lankans.\n\n10  World Bank . 2000. Sri Lanka - Poverty Update. (draft)\n\n\f4\n\n3.\n\nThe Protected Area System\n\n11.\nThree Government agencies are directly involved in protecting ecosystem resources: the\nDepartment  of  Wildlife  Conservation  (DWLC)  in  MPAHA,  the  Forestry  Department  (FD)  in  the\nMinistry of Forests and Environment (MFE), and the Coast Conservation Department (CCD) in\nthe Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and Development.  Other concerned agencies\ninclude  the  Central  Environmental  Authority,  the  Department  of  Agriculture,  and  the  Land\nCommissioner.  The  primary  responsibility  for  protecting  wildlife  resources,  however,  lies  with\nDWLC.    Under  the  authority  of  the  Fauna  and  Flora  Protection  Ordinance  of  1937,  DWLC\nmanages 73 national reserves and sanctuaries, covering 8,218 km2 or 12.4 percent of the total\nland area.11  Additional DWLC functions include (i) issuing permits and collecting fees related to\nPAs  or  pertaining  to  wildlife  generally;  (ii)  reviewing  environmental  impact  assessments  for\nactivities that may affect a PA; (iii) operating elephant rehabilitation and reintroduction facilities;\nand  (iv)  managing  bungalows,  campsites,  and  other  visitor  facilities  in  the  PAs.    These\nmanagement activities, however, do not effectively respond to the main threat to the PA system,\nwhich is the encroachment pressure that results from a strong demand for land and subsistence\nresources -  especially fuelwood and other resources for consumption or sale - and such illegal\nand commercial resource exploitation as grazing, logging, poaching, and gemstone mining. The\nresult  is  frequent  conflicts  of  interest  between  local  people  and  PA  managers,  and  a  steady\nerosion of the PA system and its wildlife and floral resources.\n\n4.\n\nKey Sector Issues\n\na.\n\nLegislative Framework\n\n12.\nThe  Fauna  and  Flora  Protection  Ordinance  (FFPO)  of  1937  governs  the  protection  of\nwildlife  throughout  the  country.    Despite  various  amendments,  the  FFPO  is  outdated  and\nineffective  as  a  tool  with  which  to  address  pressures  on  the  country\u2019s  ecological  resources.\nNew  legislation  is  needed  to  support  new  standards  for  ecosystem  and  habitat  management,\nthe role of communities living in the buffer zones, and the role of the private sector in supporting\nPA  management  and  ecotourism  development.    Multiple  and  overlapping  responsibilities  are\nalso assigned to government departments under current laws, with 12 separate laws to govern\nforest management implemented by 10 separate agencies, and another 12 laws to govern land\nmanagement, which are also implemented by 10 separate agencies.  Thus, there is a need to\nharmonize  wildlife-related  law,  especially  the  National  Forestry  Policy  and  National  Wildlife\nPolicy  and  the  law  in  line  with  both,  to  respond  effectively  and  comprehensively  to  the\nConvention on Biological Diversity, and to develop a comprehensive Biodiversity Conservation\nAction Plan (BCAP) to consolidate all other initiatives within a consistent framework.\n\nb.\n\nInstitutional Framework\n\nMultiple  and  overlapping  responsibilities  in  the  wildlife  and  biodiversity  sector  requires\n13.\nclose  interagency  cooperation.  However,  such  cooperation  has  proved  hard  to  accomplish\nalthough  a  number  of  coordinating  bodies  have  been  established,  including  a  Biodiversity\nConservation Secretariat within MFE, a National Committee on Sustainable Development, and a\nCommittee  on  Integrating  Environment  and  Development.  FD,  within  MFE,  has  an  important\nportfolio  of  biodiversity-related  responsibilities  at  various  levels  of  decision  making,  the\nintegration of which with those of DWLC is identified as critical priority by intersectoral studies\nincluding  the  National  Environmental  Action  Plan  (1991,  revised  in  1994  and  1997),  National\n\n                                                \n11  FD manages an additional 70 PAs covering 1,486 km2 or 2.4 percent of the land area.\n\n\f5\n\nConservation  Review  (1997),  and  Biodiversity  Conservation  in  Sri  Lanka:  a  Framework  for\nAction (1998).\n\nc.\n\nInstitutional Capacity\n\nDWLC  has  been  transferred  repeatedly  to  different  ministries,  and  has  experienced  a\n14.\nhigh  turnover  of  directors.    Its  operations  and  culture  follow  largely  a  reactive,  centralized,\n\u201ccommand and control\u201d model that is no longer able to deal with the complexities it faces.  It is\ninward  looking  in  its  thinking  and  procedures,  when  most  challenges  are  best  met  by  looking\noutward in a strategic and proactive manner.  It needs to be able to work more effectively with\nother  stakeholders,  including  other  Government  agencies,  nongovernment  organizations\n(NGOs), the private sector, and local communities.  The management systems of DWLC require\na stronger technical and managerial capacity at all levels, transparent and responsive budgetary\nsystems,  clear  lines  of  accountability  and  reporting,  mechanisms  for  performance  monitoring,\nand  incentives  to  maximize  staff  motivation.  The  current  system  for  managing  conservation\nfinances  is  also  inadequate,  since  PA  revenues  are  variously  directed  in  many  small\ntransactions  to  the  Wildlife  Preservation  Fund  and  the  national  consolidated  fund,  providing\nopportunities  for  leakage  along  the  way.  There  is  a  need  for  greater  transparency  and\naccountability in all aspects of financial management. In summary, DWLC needs to embrace a\nculture  of  quality  public-sector  management,  which  includes  a  commitment  to  promote  a\nforward-looking  professional  ability  to  use  transparent  and  effective  managerial  systems  and\nmodern  technology,  while  developing  public  confidence  in  its  operations  and  addressing\ncomplex multi-stakeholder issues using adaptive processes.\n\nd.\n\nPoverty, Encroachment, and Community Relations\n\n15.\nThe  underlying  causes  of  unsustainable  use  of  protected  ecosystems  include  the\npoverty and deprivation common in many villages surrounding PAs although the majority of the\nhouseholds  do  not  entirely  depend  on  the  PA  resources  for  their  main  source  of  livelihood.\nPeople living near PAs, and others with their connivance, harvest timber, fuelwood, wild meat,\nand  other  forest  products  for  subsistence  use  and  sale.  Gemstone  mining  and  agricultural\nencroachment are widespread.  An estimated total of 150,000 cattle and buffaloes graze within\nthe  PA  system,  competing  with  wild  herbivores  for  food,  trampling  native  ecosystems,  and\nspreading  alien  and  invasive  weeds.  Solutions  are  likely  to  include  clear  demarcation  of  PA\nboundaries,  enhanced  and  coordinated  enforcement,  and  the  building  of  more  cooperative\nrelationships with surrounding villagers. However, relations between the local communities and\nPA  managers  often  are  tense  as  a  result  of  conflicts  of  interest  over  encroachment  and  the\nillegal  use  of  PA  resources.    Further  conflicts  arise  because  DWLC  has  a  mandate  to  protect\nelephants,  yet  these  animals  often  enter  settled  areas  and  cause  serious  damage  to  property\nand life,12 for which current compensation arrangements are inappropriate. This situation makes\nit  hard  to  base  conservation  on  the  understanding  and  support  of  local  people,  and  there  is  a\nneed  for  a  fundamental  change  in  how  DWLC  staff  see  their  role  and  interact  with  local\ncommunities.\n\ne.\n\nPrivate Sector Involvement\n\nPrivate  sector  involvement  is  a  national  priority  reflected  most  recently  in  the  National\n16.\nWildlife Policy of 2000, which commits the Government to encourage the private sector to join\nas  a  full  partner  in  wildlife  conservation.    Private  sector  involvement  in  wildlife  and  PA\nmanagement  is  largely  inhibited,  however,  by  public  concern  that  it  should  not  undermine  the\nlegitimate  and  necessary  role  of  DWLC  as  the  chief  regulator  of  wildlife  and  PA  use.    This\n\n                                                \n12  An estimated average of 50 people and 120 elephants die each year as a result of human-elephant conflict.\n\n\f6\n\nreflects an appreciation of the fragility of natural ecosystems and a suspicion that the short-term\nperspective  of  private  enterprise  might  cause  irreversible  damage  to  natural  systems.    This\nresistance  to  change  is  based  partly  on  a  lack  of  public  familiarity  with  the  way  in  which\nnumerous  public-private  partnerships  already  exist  in  Sri  Lanka  and  contribute  significantly  to\nsocial progress.  In the context of the wildlife sector, areas of current practice include the use of\nprivate  contractors,  contractual  labor,  and  the  charging  of  user  fees,  while  imminent\nexperimentation is foreseen in the development of private insurance for elephant damage and\nconcessions for ecotourism services.\n\nf.\n\nEcotourism Development\n\n17.\nTourism is an important industry in Sri Lanka, but it is narrowly focused on inexpensive\npackage tours of beach resorts and cultural attractions.  This product mix has low profit margins\nper  tourist  and  limited  potential  for  future  growth.    In  1999,  15  percent  of  the  436,000  foreign\nvisitors  included  PAs  in  their  itineraries,  a  very  low  figure  by  international  standards.    The\nreasons for this low PA visitation rate include lack of publicity, security concerns, and a narrow\nrange  of  tourism  products  and  services.  Legal  constraints  within  the  1937  FFPO  on  private-\nsector  involvement  in  tourism  development  in  and  around  the  PAs  further  compound  these\ndifficulties.    Little  attention  has  been  paid  to  the  ecotourism  potential  of  the  PA  system  in\nmarketing  the  country\u2019s  tourism  products.  As  a  result,  opportunities  to  link  biodiversity\nconservation  with poverty reduction  in some of the poorest areas of the country, and to make\nuse of private-sector skills to enhance economic growth and diversification are being lost.\n\ng.\n\nThe Challenge of Implementation\n\nA notable weakness in the sector is inadequate implementation of national policies or PA\n18.\nmanagement  plans,  including  the  difficulty  that  underresourced  agencies  experience  in\nenforcing  related  laws.    For  this  reason,  for  example,  the  1990  National  Policy  on  Wildlife\nConservation was never implemented, and neither were most of the numerous PA management\nplans  prepared  by  various  funding  agencies  in  association  with  FD,  Central  Environmental\nAuthority, or DWLC. This implies that written policies and plans should never be seen as ends in\nthemselves,  and  that  far  more  attention  should  be  given  to  (i)  embedding  consensus-based\npolicies within a network of committed institutions; (ii) introducing adaptive managerial systems,\nincentive  structures,  and\nbased  on  dialogue, \ntransparent and accountable monitoring and evaluation procedures; and (iii) providing adequate\nresources  for  agencies  to  identify,  intercept,  process,  prosecute,  and  sanction  violators  of  the\nlaws  that  are  envisioned  by  policies  and  assumed  by  management  plans.    Such  a  change  of\nemphasis, however, will require a willingness by the Government and its development partners\nto  invest  more  design  effort  in  institutionalizing  new  arrangements  by  which  policies  and\nmanagement plans are created and used, and more resources in the agencies responsible for\ncontrolling and managing these resources.\n\nforums,  conflict-management  processes, \n\nB. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n19.\nSri  Lanka  is  a  signatory  to  the  1971  Ramsar  Convention  on  Wetlands  of  International\nImportance,  the  1973  Washington  Convention  on  International  Trade  in  Endangered  Species,\nthe 1991 Bonn Convention on Migratory Species, and the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Convention on\nBiological  Diversity  (CBD).    Anticipating  the  CBD  in  many  ways,  the  1990  National  Policy  on\nWildlife  Conservation  envisioned  reassessing  the  objectives  of  PA  management  according  to\nthe  principles  of  protection,  sustainable  use,  efficient  management,  and  regulation  based  on\nscientific knowledge and the needs of multiple stakeholders.\n\n\f7\n\nThe National Forestry Policy and Forestry Sector Master Plan of 1995-1996 recognized\n20.\nthe rapid dwindling and increasing fragmentation of natural forests, especially in the wet zone.\nThe 1997 National Conservation Review identified priority sites for inclusion in the PA system.\nThese initiatives by MFE, which are in line with the CBD, refocused the FD on forest protection\nand  the  sustainable  use  of  forest  resources,  including  biodiversity.    A  national  Coastal  Zone\nManagement Plan was prepared in 1990 and revised in 1996, and together with the 1994 report\nCoastal 2000, gave strategic direction to the CCD, identifying needs, and ways and means to\nprotect \nthe  National\nEnvironmental  Action  Plan  of  1991  was  revised  in  1994  and  1997,  and  policy  dialogue\ncontinued  among  the  main  concerned  institutions.    This  led  to  the  1998  analysis,  Biodiversity\nConservation in Sri Lanka: a Framework for Action.\n\nthe  country\u2019s  coastal  resources.  Consolidating \n\nthese  processes, \n\nThese  various  analyses  have  made  the  Government  aware  of  the  extent  to  which  its\n21.\npoverty-reduction efforts are linked to problems faced in the management of PAs, and have led\nto  a  recognition  of  the  value  of  a  more  integrated  and  participatory  approach  to  resource\nmanagement.  The  Government  is  conscious  that  to  operationalize  its  policies  will  require\nspecific  programs  for  skills  upgrading,  extension,  credit,  and  savings  mobilization,  combined\nwith targeted welfare schemes, and that environmental degradation should be addressed at the\nsame time, by educating and involving the communities in all aspects of development decision\nmaking.    These  measures  are  consistent  with  the  need  to  develop  the  capacity  to  formulate\nlocal plans, especially where resource availability are very limited and declining.\n\n22.\nEarly 2000 saw the development of a new National Wildlife Policy, led by a multisectoral\nTask Force with support provided by ADB. The policy articulates the Government\u2019s conclusions\nin relation to the sustainable and participatory management of wildlife resources in the context\nof  the  national  poverty-eradication  agenda.    In  so  doing,  it  sets  the  scene  for  amending  the\nFFPO to remove inconsistencies with policy, for the preparation of a BCAP, and ultimately for\ncomplete harmonization of biodiversity-related policy, law, and conservation action in Sri Lanka.\nThis  would  allow  all  aspects  of  biodiversity  to  be  developed  consistently,  fairly,  and  equitably,\nand thereby to contribute more effectively to the overriding aim of poverty elimination.\n\nC. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n23.\nHistorically,  ADB  assistance  in  the  natural  resources  and  environment  sectors  focused\non  increasing  production  in  agriculture,  forestry,  and  fisheries;  improving  water  supply  and\nsanitation;  and  urban  development.  More  recently,  ADB  assistance  has  shifted  to  address  the\nresource  conservation-poverty  nexus  more  strategically  by  emphasizing  the  protection  and\nsustainable use of natural resources and the environment as a means to reduce poverty and as\na  vehicle  for  sustainable  development.  The  first  ADB  project  with  a  strong  focus  on  natural\nresource  management  was  the  Upper  Watershed  Management  Project13 approved  in  1997.\nThree other ADB natural resource management projects have since been approved or are being\nprocessed:  (i)  Coastal  Resource  Management  Project,14  (ii)  Forest  Resource  Management\nSector Project,15 and (iii) Water Resources Management Project. ADB has also supported policy\nformulation  and \nthe\nImplementation  of  Environmental  Impact  Assessment,16  and  Institutional  Strengthening  for\n\ninstitution  building  by  providing  advisory  TA \n\nfor  Strengthening \n\n                                                \n13  Loan 1545-SRI: Upper Watershed Management Project, for $16.6 million, approved on 24 September 1997.\n14  Loan 1716-SRI: Coastal Resource Management, for $40 million, approved on 3 December 1999.\n15  Loan 1744-SRI: Forest Resources Management Sector, for $27.0 million, approved on 28 June 2000.\n16  TA  2765-SRI: Institutional Strengthening for Environmental Impact Assessment,  for  $600,000,  approved  on  10\n\nMarch 1997.\n\n\f8\n\nComprehensive  Water  Resources  Management.17  ADB  is  also  providing  TA18  for  institutional\ncapacity building, and a review of the policy and legal framework regarding the management of\nnatural resources and the environment.\n\nThe  Netherlands  Government  is  supporting  innovative  management  planning  and\n24.\nimplementation  in  wetlands  through  two  projects  at  the  Central  Environmental  Authority  with\nclose linkages to DWLC and other organizations. Management  planning for 25 wetland areas,\nsome  of  which  belong  to  DWLC\u2019s  PA  system,  was  undertaken.  Valuable  lessons  drawn  from\nthese activities have been incorporated in the project design. The Norwegian Government has\nsupported  mangrove  protection,  integrated  coastal  zone  planning  in  Hambantota  District,  and\nmanagement  planning  for  two  forest  reserves.    Two  projects  were  recently  approved  by  the\nGEF Medium Grants Program: one to conserve globally threatened species in the rain forests of\nthe  southwest,  and  the  other,  to  be  implemented  by  CCD,  DWLC,  and  International\nConservation  Union  (IUCN),  with  focus  on  coastal  wetlands.    The  World  Bank,  Britain\u2019s\nDepartment  for  International  Development,  and  the  Finnish  International  Development  Agency\nhave  supported  FD  in  developing  the  Forestry  Sector  Master  Plan  and  the  National  Forestry\nPolicy.  The  Canadian  International  Development  Agency  has  concentrated  on  working  with\nNGOs  at  the  community  level  in  coastal  and  highland  plantation  environments.  The  ongoing\nConservation  and  Sustainable  Use  of  Medicinal  Plants  Project  financed  by  GEF  and\nimplemented  by  the  World  Bank  is  another  important  undertaking  in  the  sector,  as  close\ncoordination  of  activities  is  envisaged  at  Ritigala  Strict  Nature  Reserve,  which  has  been\nincluded as a pilot PA under the proposed Project.\n\n25.\nEfforts  to  strengthen  DWLC  in  the  last  two  decades  involved  two  major  externally-\nassisted  projects:  (i)  through  the  Mahaweli  Environment  Project,  the  United  States  Agency  for\nInternational  Development  provided  assistance  in  the  1980s  to  develop  basic  institutional\ncapacity  for  biodiversity  conservation  and  PA  management,  especially  in  the  Mahaweli\ndevelopment  area;  and  (ii)  through  the  Development  of  Wildlife  Conservation  and  Protected\nArea  Management  Project,  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  and  GEF\nprovided assistance during the 1990s, which, among others, built capacity through staff training;\nestablished a geographic information system (GIS) unit; and prepared management plans for 10\nPAs. Details on external assistance in the sector are in Appendix 2.\n\nD. \n\nLessons Learned\n\n1. \n\nStrengthening Institutions and Communities\n\nFinal  evaluation  of  the  UNDP/GEF  Project19  concluded  that  future  GEF  support  should\n26.\nbe  conditional  on  DWLC  being  restructured  and  decentralized  under  new  leadership,  and  the\nintroduction of process mechanisms to allow better planning and budgeting.  Other lessons from\nthis project are that (i) training sources should be diversified to ensure the transfer of a variety of\nappropriate skills; (ii) institutional capacities to perform routine management and planning tasks,\nsuch  as  PA  management  planning,  should  be  developed  internally;  (iii)  measures  should  be\ntaken to improve work effectiveness of all levels of the organization; (iv) intangible management\nconstraints,  such  as  staff  morale,  are  highly  influential  in  improving  operational  effectiveness;\n\n                                                \n17  TA 2422-SRI: Institutional Strengthening for Comprehensive Water Resources Management, for $1.570 million,\n\n18  TA  3271-SRI:  Sustainable Natural Resource Management for Development, for  $800,000,  approved    on  10\n\n19  UNDP  and  FAO.  Final  Evaluation,  Development  of  Wildlife  Conservation  and  Protected  Area  Management\n\napproved on 12 October 1995.\n\nOctober 1999.\n\n(SRL/92/G31). (August 1999).\n\n\f9\n\nand  (v)  all  levels  of  staff  should  be  consulted  in  the  process  of  project  design  and\nimplementation.\n\nADB\u2019s forestry projects20 and the ongoing Upper Watershed Management Project (para.\n27.\n23)  hold  lessons  of  more  general  relevance:  (i)  local  authorities  should  be  involved  early  in\nproject  design;  (ii)  local  communities  should  be  involved  in  project  planning,  implementation,\nand monitoring; (iii) trained facilitators are needed to promote involvement by local communities;\nand (iv) Government institutions must actively support participation.  Lessons from the wetland\nconservation projects supported by the Netherlands include the following: (i) action plans must\nnot be considered as rigid sets of measures; (ii) preparation and implementation of community\naction  plans  are  unlikely  to  be  successful  without  the  involvement  of  local  leaders  and  clearly\nvisible  benefits \nin  conservation\nmanagement requires high-level support.  From these experiences, the most important factors\nin  achieving  sustainability  are  (i)  developing  awareness  in  local  communities  of  the  need  to\nprotect  resources  for  sustainable  use  by  themselves  and  others,  (ii)  empowering  them  to  act\naccordingly, and (iii) treating them as equal partners throughout the process.  Such processes\nare inherently slow, but have yielded outcomes that are both equitable and sustainable.\n\nthe  community;  and  (iii) \n\ninteragency  coordination \n\nto \n\n28.\nGovernment  attempts  to  promote  local  participation  in  the  development  process  have\nhad limited success due to (i) poorly defined methods and processes, (ii) inadequately trained\nstaff,  (iii)  an  inability  to  mobilize  adequate  technical  and  financial  support,  (iv)  an  unrealistic\nexpectation  of  quick  results,  (v)  suspicion  by  local  people  of  Government  efforts  to  influence\nevents  on  private  lands,  and  (vi)  a  perception  of  inequality  between  the  community  and  the\nGovernment.  This  suggests  that  Government  agencies  may  not  be  the  most  appropriate\ninstitutions  to  lead  a  process  of  community  strengthening  that  necessarily  involves  trust  and\npartnership  building.  Successes  have  been  achieved,  however,  by  strengthening  communities\ndirectly. For example, at Rekawa, a local stakeholder committee was encouraged to prepare a\nplan for resource management and aided to accomplish its own institutionalization as a means\nto guide and finance the plan\u2019s implementation. An ADB evaluation21 noted the positive role of\nNGOs and community based organizations (CBOs) in five projects in Sri Lanka, but observed\nthat  the  organizations  were  most  effective  when  they  were  involved  early,  were  adequately\nfunded, and in the case of small and local ones, were provided with capacity strengthening.\n\n29.\nThis  experience  suggests  that  NGOs  are  more  effective  in  building  local  relationships\nand  partnerships,  and  are  far  more  likely  to  be  perceived  as  allies  and  equals  by  local\ncommunities.    The  effectiveness  of  such  a  process  comes  from  the  way  that  participatory\nplanning  and  environmental  education  empower  the  community,  and  generate  capacity  to\nmobilize  technical  and  other  resources  from  government  agencies  and  elsewhere.    The  main\nconstraint on the widespread adoption of this approach in Sri Lanka is limited funding.  Funding\nis often available only through projects that are limited in duration and are therefore associated\nwith  abrupt  endings  and  attempts  to  speed  up  the  process  of  community  strengthening  and\npartnership building, with limited effectiveness as a consequence.\n\n                                                \n20  Loan  568-SRI:  Community Forestry Project, for  $10  million,  approved  on  25  March  1982;  Loan  1183-SRI:\n\nParticipatory Forestry Project, for $10.5 million, approved on 5 November 1992.\n\n21  SST  99027-REG:  Special  Evaluation  Study  of  the  Role  of  Nongovernmental  and  Community-Based\n\nOrganizations in Asian Development Bank Projects.\n\n\f10\n\n2. \n\nIntegrating Conservation and Community Development\n\nLessons drawn from ADB\u2019s integrated conservation-development projects (ICDPs)22 are\n30.\nthe following: (i) there is a complex and indirect relationship between the provision of income-\nearning alternatives for local communities and the achievement of conservation objectives; (ii) it\nis important to develop a local institutional capacity to implement stakeholder participation; and\n(iii) the project should develop an understanding within local communities regarding their roles,\nrights,  and  responsibilities  with  respect  to  natural  resources  and  biodiversity  conservation.\nThese findings were supported by a recent review of 21 ICDPs in Indonesia,23 which concluded\nthat  only  a  minority  of  the  projects  could  claim  that  biodiversity  conservation  has  been\nsignificantly  enhanced  by  project  activities.    Those  that  had  a  significant  impact  shared  high-\nlevel political and administrative support, strong but adaptive and flexible PA management, and\nclose communication with the local government.\n\n31.\nMany of the same lessons can be drawn from the GEF portfolio of stand-alone projects.\nA  feature  of  the  GEF,  however,  is  its  emphasis  on  establishing  sustainable  financing\nmechanisms of various kinds to conserve biodiversity of global significance and it has actively\nexplored  the  use  of  trust  funds  and  trust-like  mechanisms  in  many  countries.    A  review  of  13\nsuch  trusts24  concluded  that  there  are  four  essential  conditions:  (i)  the  issue  to  be  addressed\nrequires  a  commitment  of  at  least  10-15  years;  (ii)  there  is  active  government  support  for  a\npublic-private sector mechanism outside direct government control; (iii) there is a critical mass\nof  people  from  diverse  sectors  of  society  who  can  work  together  to  achieve  biodiversity\nconservation and sustainable development; and (iv) there is a basic fabric of legal and financial\npractices  and  supporting  institutions  (including  banking,  auditing,  and  contracting)  in  which\npeople have confidence.  Where these circumstances exist, as they do in Sri Lanka, formation\nof  a  trust-like  sustainable  financing  mechanism  will  be  an  efficient  way  to  achieve  long-term\naims  that  depend  on  slow  processes,  such  as  community  strengthening  and  partnership-\nbuilding with conservation agencies.\n\nE. \n\nThe ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\nAccording  to  ADB\u2019s  Country  Operational  Strategy  for  Sri  Lanka  (1999),  sustainable\n32.\nnatural resources management is one of the key areas for ADB involvement to ensure long-term\nsustainability  of  economic  growth  and  reduce  poverty.  A  strong  emphasis  on  forestry,  natural\nresources, and environmental management as a key feature of ADB\u2019s country operations was\nderived from the recognition that some parts of the agriculture sector are experiencing a decline\nin productivity, while intersectoral competition for water and other natural resources is emerging\nas  a  serious  issue.  Indicators,  such  as  the  incidence  of  human  encroachment  on  the  PAs,\ndecline in forest cover, and soil degradation indicate the growing and unsustainable imbalance\nbetween  the  supply  of  and  demand  for  the  use  of  natural  resources.  The  criteria  that  guide\nADB\u2019s  interventions  include  (i)  achieving  a  balance  between  the  economic  and  ecological\nfunctions  of \nthe  environment,  (ii)  addressing  poverty-related  causes  of  environmental\ndegradation,  and  (iii)  minimizing  environmental  damage.  These  are  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s\n\n                                                \n22  Loan  1187-INO: Biodiversity Conservation in Flores and Siberut, for  $24.5  million,  approved  on  12  November\n1992;  Loan  1605-INO:  Central  Sulawesi  Integrated  Area  Development  and  Conservation,  for  $32  million,\napproved  on  27  January  1998;  and    Loan  1351-INO:  Sulawesi Rainfed Agriculture Development,  for  $30.36\nmillion, approved on 31 January 1995\n\n23  Wells, M., S.

Key  areas  of  ongoing  policy  dialogue  related  to\nPA  management  and  biodiversity  conservation  systematically  encourage  and  enable  the\nGovernment \ntransparency,\ndecentralization,  cooperation,  and  coordination  among  government  and  nongovernment  public\nand private institutions, so as to rationalize the management of the PA system and maximize its\ncontribution to the reduction of poverty in Sri Lanka.\n\nissues  of  good  governance,  accountability, \n\nresolve \n\nto \n\n1. \n\nStrengthening the Legislative Framework\n\nThe  new  National  Wildlife  Policy,  prepared  with  support  from  ADB,  commits  the\n34.\nGovernment  to  amend  legislation,  as  necessary,  to  support  the  implementation  of  this  policy.\nThus, the FFPO of 1937 will be amended to make specific provision for several policy priorities,\nincluding  participatory  PA  management  and  benefit  sharing,  ecotourism  development,\ninvolvement of the private sector, and ex situ conservation activities.  The amended FFPO will\nbe  superseded  by  entirely  new  legislation  before  the  end  of  project  year  5,  which  will  be\ncollaboratively developed in the light of the Biodiversity Conservation Action Plan, which will be\nprepared according to best practices during the Project.\n\n2. \n\nStrengthening the Institutional Framework\n\n35.\nBiodiversity  conservation  and  PA  management  are  currently  hampered  by  weak\ncooperation among the concerned institutions, and by unclear separation of responsibilities and\njurisdictions  between  them.  A  number  of  coordinating  bodies  have  been  established,  but  they\nare of limited effectiveness and lack formal mechanisms to coordinate Government operations.\nTherefore,  ADB  is  stressing  the  need  to  reform  current  arrangements,  and  the  2000  TA\nprogram, especially the ongoing TA on Sustainable Natural Resource Management, will support\nthe  Government  doing  so.    The  new  National  Wildlife  Policy  commits  MFE,  MPAHA,  and  the\nBiodiversity  Conservation  Secretariat  to  monitor  events  and  take  actions  needed  to  maintain\nconsistency  between  the  National  Wildlife  Policy  and  other  sector  and  intersector  policies.    It\nalso  commits  the  Government  to  promote  cooperation  among  all  stakeholders  through  joint\ndecision making at all levels.  These policy statements reflect a strong consensus among key\ninstitutions  of  the  Government,  as  well  as  national  NGOs,  universities,  and  representatives  of\nthe private sector.  This provides a strong basis for ADB, in dialogue with Government, to take\nthe process of institutionalizing interagency cooperation to unprecedented levels, providing the\nbasis  that  all  the  country\u2019s  PAs  may  one  day  be  consolidated  under  the  management  of  one,\neffective Government agency.\n\n3. \n\nStrengthening Institutional Capacity\n\n36.\nThe new National Wildlife Policy commits the Government to provide adequate support\nto wildlife resource management, and to reorient, strengthen, and decentralize their institutions.\nThis  mandate  complements  the  Project\u2019s  aim  to  strengthen  DWLC\u2019s  ability  to  collaborate  with\n\n                                                \n25  R232-94:  ADB\u2019s Policy on Forestry  (Revision 1), February 1995.\n\n\f12\n\nother institutional stakeholders.  The implementation of the Project will (i) effect organizational\nchanges within DWLC to address issues related to good governance such as greater integration\nand  transparency;  (ii)  remove  some  of  the  key  constraints  on  staff  effectiveness  and\naccountability,  including disincentives that undermine morale; (iii) facilitate the decentralization\nof operational responsibilities to the regional and field unit level, including annual work planning,\nbudgetary  responsibility,  and  accountability  for  performance;  and  (iv)  ensure  DWLC\u2019s\nparticipation  in  partnership-building  with  local  communities  and  the  local  government.    These\nmeasures  are  consistent  with  the  decentralizing  thrust  of  other  Government  policies,  and  will\nrelocate significant responsibilities away from the center to encourage PA managers to operate\nin a web of partnerships with surrounding society.\n\n4. \n\nImproving Protected Area-Community Relations\n\n37.\nThe National Wildlife Policy commits the Government and DWLC to (i) conserve wildlife\nresources through protection, study, education, sustainable use, and participatory management;\n(ii) value the traditional knowledge of sustainable ecosystem use possessed by the people of Sri\nLanka,  and  incorporate  this  within  wildlife  management  systems;  and  (iii)  ensure  that  local\npeople are consulted in the process of decision making, actively participate in implementation,\nand receive direct benefits from the management of PAs.  The clear intention is to relieve the\noften-adversarial  relationship  between  PA  managers  and  the  communities  around  PAs.  This\nintention  has  resulted  in  the  acceptance  of  a  revenue-sharing  agreement  in  which  DWLC  will\nretain 50 percent of all revenue collected from PAs, to be used for specified purposes including\ncommunity outreach that will be channeled through the existing Wildlife Preservation Fund.  The\nGovernment and DWLC recognize that effective protection of wildlife will not be possible without\ncommunity  involvement  in  PA  management,  benefit  sharing,  and  poverty  reduction.  ADB\ntherefore aims to encourage and enable the Government to (i) improve the quality and integrity\nof public sector management in the wildlife sector; (ii) mobilize and empower user groups; (iii)\nencourage and enable communities to obtain new and incremental resources to meet their own\ndevelopment priorities; (iv) establish lines of communication and formal agreements to allow for\nthe use of local resources to combat poverty and deprivation, and to promote the protection of\nwildlife  habitats;  and  (v)  promote  community  and  local  government  cooperation  in  local\ndevelopment planning.\n\n5. \n\nStrengthening Private Sector Involvement\n\n38.\nPolicy  dialogue  in  this  area  aims  to  build  systematically  upon  existing  public-private\nrelationships  through  active  experimentation  and  learning,  while  removing  obsolete  legislative\nbarriers  and  installing  effective  safeguards  against  abuse.    The  main  areas  of  progress  are\nexpected to be in developing guidelines and rational structures for a greater range of user fees\nand concessions, especially in the area of ecotourism, in the contracting of a greater range of\nservices,  and  in  establishing  more  benefit-sharing  arrangements  with  local  communities.    It  is\nexpected  that  steady,  knowledge-based  evolution  of  best  practices,  followed  by  their  more\nwidespread  adoption,  will  be  a  feature  of  this  field  in  the  coming  years.  Until  experience  and\ngood  practices  are  sufficiently  mature,  the  Government  will  continue  to  move  cautiously  in\ninvolving the private sector inside PAs.\n\n6. \n\nPromoting Ecotourism Development\n\nIn this area of policy dialogue, ADB is emphasizing the need for (i) strategic planning; (ii)\n39.\njoint  activities  between  the  public  and  private  sectors,  including  the  community-based  private\nsector;  (iii)  diversification  and  improvement  of  products  and  services  offered  within  PAs;  (iv)\n\n\f13\n\nbroader distribution of the benefits obtained; and (v) development of a greater variety of niche\nofferings  to  satisfy  a  wider  range  of  potential  visitors.  The  Government  meanwhile,  with  ADB\nencouragement, has agreed to end DWLC management of tourist bungalows. Their subsidized\nprices  inhibit  private  investment,  managing  them  distracts  DWLC  from  its  primary  role  as  the\nregulator  of  PA  use,  and  DWLC  is  subject  to  pressure  to  provide  use  of  the  bungalows  at\ncommercially  nonviable  rates  to  those  with  influence.    Other  policy  alternatives  such  as\ncommunity  leasing  of  bungalows  are  being  explored.  ADB  and  the  Project  will  promote\necotourism development through such measures as planning, training, concession agreements,\nand infrastructure investments within the PAs and outside in conjunction with local communities.\nThe  Project  also  allows  for  the  sharing  of  PA  revenues  with  cooperating  communities  through\noutreach grants from the Wildlife Preservation Fund.\n\nG. \n\nThe Global Environment Facility\n\n40.\nThe GEF provides grants to activities that resist global climate change, loss of biological\ndiversity, pollution of international waters, and depletion of the ozone layer.  It aims to meet the\nincremental  costs  of  achieving  global  benefits,  meaning  the  difference  between  the  costs  of  a\nproject  achieving  global  environmental  benefits  over  and  above  the  costs  of  an  alternative\nproject that a country would have undertaken in its own interests. The GEF contribution to the\nProject  is  based  on  current  understanding  of  the  distribution  of  likely  benefits  relative  to  the\npriorities  of  the  Government  and  its  partners  in  development  (Appendix  3).    Hence,  the  GEF\nsupports  only  those  areas  where  global  benefits  are  obtainable.  The  grant  will  be  deployed\nespecially to support the full participation of all stakeholders in the development of community\naction plans and agreements with DWLC relating to PA and wildlife management.  It will also be\ndirected to the building of international links as a contribution to the emergence of global best\npractice  and  the  spread  and  improvement  of  replicable  models  worldwide,  and  on  the\nindependent monitoring of project impacts on wildlife survival and ecosystem integrity.\n\nIV.      THE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.    Rationale\n\nSri  Lanka  has  globally  significant  biodiversity  values  that  are  currently  threatened  by\n41.\ndeforestation,  land  degradation,  and  unregulated  exploitation  of  natural  resources.  The  PA\nsystem is central to conserving wildlife biodiversity. PAs also play a significant role in supporting\nrural economies through watershed protection, and add to the economic and cultural values of\nSri  Lanka  through  the  provision  of  recreational,  ecotourism,  scientific,  and  educational\nopportunities. The PAs are currently unable to provide effective protection for these values due\nto several reasons, including the need for legislative and institutional reform; lack of resources,\nmanagerial  skills,  and  technical  capacity  in  DWLC,  the  government  agency  primarily  charged\nwith  administering  the  PA  system;  and  lack  of  cooperation  among  the  conservation  agencies.\nTo  address  these  deficiencies  will  require  significant  efforts,  particularly  in  human  resource\ndevelopment,  improvement  of  managerial  systems  and  technical  skills,  and  the  provision  of\ninfrastructure  and  equipment.  The  development  of  greater  interagency  cooperation \nis\nfundamental  to  this  strengthening  and  the  growth  of  a  more  strategic  approach  to  addressing\nconservation  priorities  in  Sri  Lanka.  Key  tasks  such  as  the  preparation  of  a  BCAP,  achieving\ngreater representation of native ecosystems within the PA system, preparing recovery plans for\nendangered  species,  and  establishing  national  conservation  priorities  can  only  be  achieved\nthrough collaborative and coordinated approaches.\n\n\f14\n\nTo address the threats and opportunities the PA system faces demands a reorientation\n42.\nof  conservation  thinking  that  acknowledges  the  mutual  dependence  of  conservation  agencies\nand  local  communities  on  each  other  to  achieve  their  respective  goals.  Effective  PA\nmanagement cannot take place in the long term without the involvement and support of the local\ncommunities. Similarly, rural livelihoods depend on a flow of natural resource benefits, many of\nwhich  cannot  be  sustained  without  active  protective  measures.  To  build  these  partnerships\nrequires  greater  capacity  within  conservation  agencies  to  understand  and  work  with  local\ncommunities in designing programs to realize joint benefits. It also requires effective community\nempowerment  to  allow  the  communities  to  plan  for  their  own  future  and  interact  with\ngovernment  agencies  and  the  private  sector  as  equal  partners.  Part  of  this  vision  will  involve\nlow-impact use of PAs and their buffer zones, and the capturing of benefits by communities and\nthe private sector through ecotourism development. The key need is to strengthen the ability of\nDWLC to manage the largest part of the national system of PAs, in partnership with and in the\ninterests of local stakeholders.  Experience in many countries has shown that this is likely to be\na long process, and the Project is therefore considered the first or pilot phase of a sequence of\ninterventions  that  will  provide  the  capacity  and  management  experience  to  be  extended\nthroughout the PA system and the sector as a whole.\n\nB.   \n\nPilot Project Areas\n\nThe  Project\u2019s  pilot  PAs  represent  a  comprehensive  selection  of  threats  to  biodiversity\n43.\nand  ecosystem  integrity,  and  opportunities  for  more  effective  PA  management.  They  were\nidentified  in  close  consultation  with  major  stakeholders  in  wildlife  conservation.  The  key\nselection  criteria  considered  the  areas\u2019  significance  in  terms  of  biodiversity,  ecological  values,\ndegree of unsustainable and illegal exploitation, and potential for ecotourism development. The\nroot cause of most threats the selected PAs face is poverty and associated deprivation among\npeople  living  close  to  PA  boundaries.  The  poorer  households  specifically  pose  the  greatest\ndirect  threat  to  PA  resources,  either  by  acting  on  their  own  needs  for  subsistence  and  other\nlivelihood resources, or else by being co-opted into illegal activity by outsiders.  The pilot PAs\ncan  be  grouped  for  descriptive  purposes  into  wet-zone  highland,  dry-zone  lowland,  and  arid-\nzone coastal wetland ecological regions. A detailed description of the threats and root causes in\nthe pilot PAs is presented in Appendix 4.\n\n44. Wet-Zone  Highlands.  Peak  Wilderness  Sanctuary  (224  km2)  is  located  in  the  Central\nHighlands and rises steeply from about 50 meters (m) to about 600 m from which Adam\u2019s Peak\nrises to 2,238 m.  It is one of the most valuable conservation areas in Sri Lanka, with the highest\nnumber of endemics, notably birds,  reptiles, and amphibians.  Adam\u2019s Peak itself is sacred to\nfour world religions and attracts about two million pilgrims each year. Encroachment, extraction\nof timber and nontimber forest products, and gemstone mining - promoted by the lack of clear\nboundaries in harsh terrain - are continuing problems, while pilgrim visitation has a strong local\nimpact along the main access trails.  Horton Plains National Park (32 km2) includes two of Sri\nLanka\u2019s three highest peaks, but is mostly a gently undulating highland plateau at about 2,100\nm.  Most of the park is covered by dense cloud forest, with 50 percent endemism among woody\nplants including wild relatives of cultivated pepper, guava, tobacco, and cardamom.  Among the\nmammals  are  two  monotypic  kinds  of  endemic  shrews,  while  the  birds  include  numerous\nmontane  endemics  and  wintering  migrants.    Exotic  plant  species  including  gorse  and  black\nwattle are colonizing rapidly.\n\nDry-Zone  Lowlands.  Ritigala  Strict  Nature  Reserve  (15  km2)  is  an  isolated  mountain\n45.\n(766 m) that supports over 400 plant species, 20 percent of them endemic.  More than 100 plant\nspecies are used in Ayurvedic medicines, and there are elaborate ruins of an ancient hospital\n\n\f15\n\nand  monastery  complex.    Mammals  include  endemic  and  endangered  purple-faced  leaf\nmonkeys and three endemic species of birds.  Logging and poaching are common, along with\nencroachment, and human-elephant conflict is increasing around the boundaries.  Wasgamuwa\nNational Park (394 km2) contains one of the largest remaining native forests in Sri Lanka, with\n150 known tree species, at least 10 of them endemic.  About 70,000 cattle and buffalo graze the\npark,  even  encroaching  on  the  southern  boundary.  Invading  woody  species  have  become\nwidespread,  and  hunting,  gemstone  mining,  and  firewood  collection  are  common.    Minneriya\nNational  Park  (89  km2)  comprises  low-forested  hills  that  feed  the  third-century  Minnerya\nreservoir and the modern Giritale reservoir.  The core of the park is one of the most biodiverse\nparts of the country outside the wet zone, with a unique concentration of intact ecosystem types.\nAbout  4,000  cattle  and  buffalo  graze  the  park,  and  firewood  collection  and  poaching  are\ncommon.  Human-elephant  conflicts  occur  around  at  least  five  nearby  villages.    Uda  Walawe\nNational  Park  (308  km2)  contains  diverse  old  growth  forest  in  the  northern  part,  within  which\nriverine  stands  contain  the  endemic,  endangered  tree  Hopea  cordifolia.    Among  the  rich\nmammal fauna are the endemic golden palm civet, herds of resident and migratory elephants,\nand  a  full  suite  of  low-country  birds.    About  30,000  cattle  graze  the  park,  exotic  plants  have\ninvaded many areas, and fishing and poaching are widespread.\n\nArid-Zone  Coastal  Wetlands.  Bundala  National  Park  (62  km2)  is  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  only\n46.\nWetland of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention.  It contains key nesting sites\nfor  five  species  of  marine  turtle.    Arid  and  semiarid  terrestrial  habitats  shelter  a  wide  range  of\nspecies,  including  elephants  and  many  other  native  mammals,  star  tortoise,  and  an  endemic\nflying  snake.    The  marshes  and  channels  contain  populations  of  an  endemic  toad,  and  both\nmugger and estuarine crocodiles. The biological productivity of the lagoons is being undermined\nby the intrusion of fresh (and polluted) irrigation water, while the park is being invaded by alien\nweeds such as prickly pear cactus, and is grazed by some 6,000 cattle and buffalo.\n\n C.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n47.\nThe Project will support the Government to conserve the country\u2019s natural resources and\nbiodiversity  for  the  well-being  of  current  and  future  generations  and  assist  the  Government  in\nmeeting  the  country\u2019s  international  commitments  and  other  policy  goals  for  conservation  of\nbiodiversity.    By  strengthening  the  institutional  capacity  of  DWLC  through  the  development  of\nstrategic  management  capacity  and  staff  skills,  provision  of  equipment  and  infrastructure,  and\ndevelopment of adaptive field management, PA security will be enhanced. As part of securing\nthe  resource,  the  economic  potential  of  PA-based  ecotourism  will  be  stimulated  through\nincreased technical capacity, formation of public-community and public-private linkages, and a\nprogram of ongoing product and service development that will contribute to raising the quality of\nvisitor  experiences.    Durable  improvement  to  the  security  of  PA  resources  requires  social\nsupport  for conservation objectives. Buffer zone community empowerment along with revenue\nsharing between PAs and stakeholders will support a process of ongoing change  (Appendix 5).\n\n48.\nUltimately, the potential value of Sri Lanka\u2019s biological resources will be achieved only if\npolicies  and  operational  strategies  are  coordinated  across  sectors.    The  Project  will  support  a\nrange of joint forums as well as the completion of a BCAP and a cross-sector review of the total\nconservation  system  including  potential  roles  for  the  private  sector  to  assist  in  filling\nconservation  system  gaps.  The  development  and  financial  support  of  joint  forums  at  the\noperational  and  national  levels  will  provide  a  platform  for  the  future  growth  of  sector\ncoordination.  Sector coordination will also be promoted through the provision of a sustainable\nfinancing  mechanism  that  will  develop  social  mobilization  and  empowerment  for  buffer  zone\ncommunities  irrespective  of  sector  authority  (Appendix  6).  The  establishment  of  a  Protected\n\n\f16\n\nArea  Conservation  Trust  (PACT)  outside  of  Government  to  empower  communities  in  local\ndevelopment initiatives will ensure ongoing support to conserving PAs after project completion.\n\n1.\n\nProject Components\n\na.\n\nEnhancing Institutional Capacity for Protected Area Management26\n(Component A)\n\nDWLC\u2019s  capacity  will  be  enhanced  through  the  provision  of  international  and  domestic\n49.\nconsulting services, internal and external training courses and study tours, provision/upgrading\nof  facilities  such  as  the  Wildlife  Education  and  Training  Center  at  Giritale  and  DWLC\u2019s\nheadquarter in Colombo, as well as materials, vehicles, and equipment. DWLC will be provided\nresources  to  build  international  partnerships  with  institutions  in  other  countries  that  have\novercome  similar  challenges,  including  Costa  Rica\u2019s  National  Biodiversity  Institute,  the  South\nAfrican National Parks Authority, and the Smithsonian Institution. Thus, it will have direct access\nto  global  best  practices  in  ecotourism,  decentralized  and  participatory  PA  management,  and\nbiodiversity and environmental inventories.  Component A comprises four subcomponents.\n\n50.\nEnhancing  Management  Systems.  The  Project  will  strengthen  human  resources,\nfinancial and administrative capacity and systems to permit transparent management of DWLC.\nWork plans will be developed and implemented at the park level, within a manager line control\nsystem  reporting  through  regional  managers  directly  to  DWLC  management.  Procedures  for\nmonitoring  work  plan  performance,  increasing  incentives  and  removing  disincentives  for  staff\nperformance,  resolving  conflicts  of  interest,  as  well  as  accounting  and  budgeting  will  be\ndeveloped and training provided. The systems under this subcomponent will allow DWLC to (i)\nmonitor planned inputs and outputs at all levels of the operation on a monthly basis; (ii) achieve\naccountability  for  expenditure  and  revenue  flows;  (iii)  decentralize  decisions  about  work\nobjectives,  resource  needs,  and  work  programs  with  agreed-upon  decentralized  budgets;  (iv)\nprovide  access  to  a  custom-built  management  and  knowledge  information  system  via  an\ninternet  and  radio-based  communication  system;  (v)  access  quality  information  both  in-house\nand from other sources including the Internet; and (vi) strengthen the skills of the management\nteam through a program of change management, team building, and leadership training.\n\n51.\nStrengthening Technical Capacity. The Project will (i) provide technical training within\nDWLC  in  areas  such  as  ecology  and  habitat  management,  communications,  enforcement,\nconflict  resolution,  GIS,  remote  sensing  etc.;  (ii)  establish  a  strong  monitoring  and  evaluation\nteam that will focus on field operations and adaptive management of field programs; (iii) develop\na  participatory  research  agenda  involving  outsourcing  of  contracts  with  natural  and  social\nscientists working in tandem on wildlife biodiversity; and (iv) provide technical strengthening to\nthe  Wildlife  Health  and  Management  Unit  through  the  use  of  an  international  partnership\nprogram.    The  Project  will  also  establish  and  support  a  community  outreach  and  extension\ntechnical team to address community and public interactions with DWLC to (i) establish at each\nof  the  field  sites  trained  capacity  to  work  with  local  communities;  (ii)  develop  operational\nprotocols  for  social  assessment,  participation,  and  local  partnerships;  (iii)  develop  public\neducation and awareness programs; and (iv) supervise local plans as an integral component of\nadaptive field management.\n\n                                                \n26 Component A builds on the institutional strengthening measures that were undertaken with assistance provided\n\nby UNDP/GEF.\n\n\f17\n\nEstablishing Ecotourism Capacity. The Project will support capacity building in DWLC\n52.\nto  assist  in  the  future  development  of  ecotourism  in  Sri  Lanka.    Additional  capacity  will  be\nachieved through establishing incremental staff positions, training, intersectoral workshops, and\ntechnical  assistance.  The  Project  will  support  DWLC  in  (i)  working  with  other  Government\nagencies  and  the  private  sector  to  develop  a  coordinated  strategy  for  ecotourism;  (ii)\ncoordinating  the  development  of  an  ecotourism  system  plan  and  policies  in  support  of  such\nplan; (iii) providing technical and supervisory inputs to the management plans of individual PAs\non  all  aspects  of  visitor  management;  (iv)  developing  nature  interpretation  facilities;  (v)\ndeveloping  concession  agreements  with  both  the  private  sector  and  local  communities  for  the\nprovision  of  selective  products  and  services  within  PAs;  (vi)  developing  policies,  procedures,\nand monitoring standards for assessing the performance of private sector and community-based\nconcessions;  (vii)  arranging  for  visitor  satisfaction  surveys  to  be  undertaken  on  individual\nfacilities (e.g., visitor centers), PAs, and the PA system as a whole; and (viii) reviewing pricing\nstructures for entry fees and services provided in PAs.\n\n53.\nStrengthening Wildlife Biodiversity Monitoring and Evaluation. This subcomponent\nwill  strengthen  DWLC\u2019s  capacity  to  systematically  monitor  biodiversity  in  the  PAs  under  its\nmandate.  A  management-driven  impact  monitoring  program,  established  under  the  Project,  is\nultimately  expected  to  track  overall  national  trends  in  wildlife  resources  and  their  utilization\nthrough site-specific monitoring. Recognizing the complex interactions between human society,\nthe  economy,  and  the  wildlife  ecosystem,  the  monitoring  program  will  concentrate  on  the\ngeneration  of  information  that  is  directly  applicable  to  the  planning  and  management  of  PAs.\nInitially,  the  monitoring  program  will  concentrate  on  developing  appropriate  monitoring  and\nevaluation  protocols  in  the  pilot  PAs  and  harmonizing  these  with  the  Project\u2019s  management\ninformation system (MIS). Institutional development and DWLC staff training in the management\nof  the  wildlife  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  are  integral  activities  of  this  subcomponent.\nAssistance  in  implementing  this  subcomponent  will  be  provided  by  a  consortium  of  reputable\ninternational NGOs with expertise in conservation and community mobilization, and substantial\nfield-based experience in Asia.\n\nb. \n\nParticipatory Adaptive Management of Pilot Protected Areas\n(Component  B)\n\n54.\nComponent  B  will  support  participatory  management  programs  that  address  strategic\nthreats  and  opportunities  at  each  of  the  seven  pilot  sites  (Appendix  4).    To  achieve  this,  the\nProject  will  support  the  (i)  consolidation  and  revision  of  existing  management  plans  into\noperational  work  plans  and  implementation  of  an  adaptive  management  program  to  mitigate\nstrategic threats and develop opportunities; (ii) provision of new skills, infrastructure, equipment,\nand  vehicles  to  support  program  implementation;  and  (iii)  development  of  quality  ecotourism\nproducts and services. The activities of this component are split into three subcomponents.\n\n55.\nConsolidation and Revision of Existing Management Plans and Implementation of\nAdaptive Management.  The Project will develop multistakeholder processes for reviewing the\nexisting management plans to establish priorities and work programs.  The plans developed will\n(i)  specify  the  control  of  the  management  of  PA  resources;  (ii)  specify  acceptable  use  of  PAs\nand their resources through the application of management zoning; and (iii) outline a program of\nnecessary  facilities  and  infrastructure  required  to  support  management  and  ecotourism\ninitiatives.  Further, the plans will be used to create a rolling three-year work plan with budget\napprovals.  The  activities  are  designed  to  institutionalize  the  implementation  of  adaptive\nmanagement approaches to strategic threats at each of the pilot sites. The Project will provide\nsupport  to  (i)  prioritize  threats  to  each  PA  with  involvement  of  local  staff  and  stakeholders;  (ii)\n\n\f18\n\nundertake an option analysis to specify the need for change and the range of alternative options\nto  achieve  it;  (iii)  prepare  an  action  plan  that  identifies  the  tasks,  time  lines,  critical  success\nfactors and indicators, and reporting requirements; (iv) design a formal evaluation program; (v)\nreformulate  the  plan  as  outcomes  and  effects  that  need  refocusing  are  identified;  and  (vi)\ndevelop  a  second  full  cycle  to  apply  the  technique  to  either  reinforce  the  existing  issues  or\nalternately  redirect  toward  the  next  set  of  priorities.  Plan  implementation  in  the  selected  pilot\nareas will be financed under the Project.\n\nFacilitating  Management  of  Pilot  Protected  Areas.  Under  this  subcomponent,  the\n56.\nProject  will  provide  the  necessary  inputs  for  implementation  of  field  programs.  Unmarked  PA\nboundaries  will  be  delineated  and  demarcated  using  a  participatory  process.  Enforcement\ncapacity will be enhanced through (i) provision of training, (ii) developing techniques to increase\nthe  probability  of  violators  being  intercepted,  (iii)  increasing  the  success  rate  of  prosecutions\nwith  appropriate  sanctions,  and  (iv)  integrating  enforcement  with  community  participation  and\nthe  sharing  of  revenues  to  provide  positive  support  for  boundary  integrity.  Furthermore,  the\nProject  will  (i)  provide  equipment,  vehicles,  and  facilities;  (ii)  support  necessary  infrastructure\nincluding low-impact access roads, tracks, and park entry facilities such as gates and reception\nareas; and (iii) extend greater field staff support including warden offices, staff quarters and beat\nbuildings. Improved community relations are central to maintaining the integrity of PAs and will\nbe supported by (i) the development of social assessment and participatory community scoping\nskills among the field unit staff; (ii) the implementation of a field-based action research program\nbased  on  community  mobilization;  (iii)  the  development  of  plans  and  strategies  that  have  a\ncommunity  outreach  and  education  component;  and  (iv)  the  provision  of  community  outreach\ngrants through DWLC staff for environmental activities, such as small-scale tree planting, local\nenvironment monitoring, and local awareness programs.\n\n57.\nEcotourism Development. Activities under this subcomponent are designed to (i) raise\nthe  capabilities  of  DWLC  staff  in  visitor  planning  and  management,  (ii)  enhance  the  quality  of\nthe visitor experience, (iii) increase the involvement and capabilities of other stakeholders in the\nprovision  of  ecotourism  opportunities,  and  (iv)  increase  local  opportunities  for  benefit  sharing\nwithout  consumption  of  park  resources.  For  each  park,  a  visitor  services  and  ecotourism  plan\nwill be developed specifying (i) infrastructure requirements including visitor centers, interpreted\ntrails, observation platforms, wildlife watching hides; (ii) new recreational activities; and (iii) the\npotential  for  public-private  and  public\u2013community  operations.  The  plan  will  be  developed  in  a\nparticipatory manner as part of the park management plan. Courses will be offered in each park\nfor  upgrading  tracker  and  volunteer  guide  skills,  and  in  local  communities  for  developing\nbusiness skills for ecotourism.\n\nc.\n\nCollaborative Conservation Planning (Component C)\n\nComponent  C  will  establish  a  platform  on  which  to  develop  increased  collaborative\n58.\nconservation planning among the involved institutions and other stakeholders.  The Project will\nstrengthen  the  Biodiversity  Conservation  Secretariat  (BCS)  to  prepare  a  BCAP  using  a\nfacilitated  participatory  process  that  develops  a  consensus  on  national  priorities  and  a\nmechanism  through  which  increasing  numbers  of  joint  operational  programs  and  program\noverviews  can  be  implemented.  Specifically,  the  Project  will  undertake  the  following  range  of\nactivities.\n\nNational Biodiversity Conservation Action Plan. The Project will strengthen the BCS\n59.\nwithin  MFE  to  provide  the  focal  point  for  completing  the  BCAP  through  provision  of  (i)  office\nequipment, computers, and a vehicle; and (ii) access to support staff contracted for the purpose\n\n\f19\n\nof completing the BCAP.  The Project will also support the BCS to develop a wide participation\nprocess  using  the  following  steps:  (i)  developing  an  implementation  plan;  (ii)  organizing  a\ncommitted professional team to lead and coordinate implementation; (iii) adapting international\nguidelines  to  Sri  Lankan  circumstances;  (iv)  selecting  representative  sites  and  stakeholder\nparticipants;  (v)  using  innovative  procedures  to  optimize  public  participation;  (vi)  fostering  the\nsharing  of  scientific  and  other  knowledge;  (vii)  promoting  capacity  building;  (viii)  developing\neffective  communications  to  expand  awareness;  (ix)  building  linkages  with  other  initiatives;  (x)\nusing  local,  national,  and  regional  expertise;  (xi)  integrating  the  process  with  sustainable\ndevelopment initiatives; and (xii) facilitating the sharing of knowledge and experience with other\ninstitutions and countries.\n\n60.\nConservation System Review. The Project will support a process to identify lands that\nhelp fill critical gaps in the current PA system and link existing sites together.  Planning teams at\nDWLC and FD will review existing materials and jointly identify important gaps in the PA system\nand  potential  links  between  PAs.    The  joint  planning  team  will  (i)  formulate  an  action  plan  to\nprovide  conservation  benefits  in  the  target  areas,  (ii)  identify  and  evaluate  institutional\nconstraints  to  private  sector  provision  of  conservation  goods  and  services,  (iii)  undertake\nstakeholder  workshops  in  the  target  areas  to  identify  opportunities  for  public  land  to  be\nintroduced  in  the  estate  if  such  habitat  fills  one  of  the  gaps,  (iv)  rationalize  land  out  of  the\nconservation system wherever the land is considered to have inadequate value for conservation\npurposes, and (v) develop the necessary legal documentation for private sector initiatives with\npromotional  materials  and  a  media  awareness  campaign.    Further,  the  Project  will  investigate\nthe potential to use public and private land to link fragmented habitats.\n\nJoint  Priority  Setting  and  Endangered  Species  Recovery.  Numerous  agencies  are\n61.\nundertaking development activities in the PA buffer zones without sufficient coordination. Thus,\nthe  Project  will  support  the  BCS  to  lead  a  process  of  joint  priority  setting  across  the  major\nstakeholders  involved  in  the  biodiversity  conservation  sector  with  respect  to  buffer  zone\ncommunity support. This will involve (i) operational staff from DWLC, FD, CCD, in conjunction\nwith local authorities and other stakeholders, reviewing the existing conservation programs; (ii) a\nsector  workshop  to  establish  appropriate  criteria  for  identification  of  priority  sites;  and  (iii)  joint\nassessments  of  priorities.  These  priorities  will  be  used  for  evaluating  funding  requests  under\ncomponent  D.  Under  this  subcomponent,  the  Project  will  also  support  a  collaborative\nassessment  of  the  current  status  of  endangered  species  and  the  preparation  of  endangered\nspecies recovery plans. This will involve (i) a collaborative assessment by all interested parties\nof  the  relative  endangerment  of  species  based  on  the  IUCN  red  book  classification,  (ii)\nidentification  of  species  at  risk,  (iii)  preparation  of  species  recovery  plans  for  priority  species,\nand (iv) dissemination of the plan for consultation and sponsorship by the private sector.\n\nd.\n\nSustainable Financing for Community Partnership Building\n(Component D)\n\n62.\nThe  Project  will  establish  a  trust  to  finance  community  and  participatory  benefits  from\nconservation  and  the  PAs,  with  priority  assigned  to  projects  that  support  PA  management  by\nreinforcing the link between biodiversity conservation and the local communities. The trust aims\nto empower buffer zone communities to develop increased governance over local development\nprocesses  through  the  establishment  of  participatory  local  community  plans  followed  by\nintegrated area-wide plans that assist in their implementation and thereby establish the basis for\nincreased  sustainability  of  natural  resource  management.  These  will  lead  to  agreements  with\nPA  managers  on  local  resource  use.  For  purposes  of  this  component,  a  Protected  Area\nConservation  Trust  (PACT)  will  be  established  outside  of  Government  as  a  new  entity  with  a\n\n\f20\n\ncapital  protected  endowment  of  initially  $8  million  equivalent,  the  revenue  from  which  will  be\nused  to  finance  the  trust\u2019s  objectives  relating  to  conservation  of  biodiversity.  The  size  of  the\nendowment was determined from an extensive participatory needs analysis in conjunction with\na financial sustainability analysis. The PACT will be endowed under the Project over a period of\nthree years. The PACT will fund activities that will enhance the well-being of the communities in\nthe buffer zone communities while respecting the conservation function of the PAs.  Consultants\ncontracted  through  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  assist  in  establishing  the  PACT\n(Appendix 6).  Once established, the PACT will be self-executing as a stand-alone entity.\n\n 63.\nThe  PACT  will  support  the  empowerment  process  in  PA  periphery  communities  by  (i)\nfunding  training  to  NGOs  and  community-level  institutions  to  enable  them  to  compete\nsuccessfully for funds from the PACT, (ii) managing a competitive grants process for contractors\nwith proven abilities to facilitate the community strengthening process, (iii) providing grants with\nwhich to initiate community action plan implementation where a proposed investment is likely to\ncontribute  to  resolving  conflicts  of  interest  with  conservation  priorities,  and  (iv)  to  undertake\ncapital  investments  to  deliver  the  objectives  of  the  trust.    Besides reinvestment  of  a  portion  of\nthe  PACT\u2019s  income,  the  income  will  be  used  to  finance  administrative  expenses,  consulting\nservices, training, workshops, civil works, equipment and materials.\n\n2.\n\nThe Role of the Global Environment Facility\n\n64.\nThe Project is consistent with the strategies and principles of the GEF with respect to (i)\nconservation of biodiversity and its sustainable use, (ii) conservation of tropical forests and their\nsustainable  use,  (iii)  maintenance  of  genetic  resources,  (iv)  empowerment  of  the  principal\ngroups  and  local  participation  in  environmental  management,  (v)  national  capacity  building\nrelated  to  the  mainstreaming  of  biodiversity  conservation,  and  (vi)  international  linkage  for\ndeveloping  best  practices  and  promoting  their  worldwide  replication.    The  project  components\nare, however, interlinked and mutually dependent, and all must be advanced simultaneously to\nachieve  significant  global,  national,  and  local  benefits.    The  GEF  will  contribute  to  the  most\nsignificant  global  benefits,  specifically,  (i)  certain  consulting  services  provided  to  PMU  and  for\nthe establishment of the PACT; (ii) a portion (50 percent) of the PACT endowment; (iii) regular\nimpact  assessments  of  the  Project  as  a  whole  by  international  NGOs;  (iv)  partnering\narrangements  between  the  PACT  and  international  NGOs;  (v)  twinning  between  DWLC  and\noverseas  institutions;  (vi)  biodiversity-related  research  contracts;  (vii)  collaborative  sector\nplanning  including  completion  of  a  BCAP  and  plans  for  endangered  species,  pilot  actions  to\nexpand and/or link the PA system; and (viii) development of adaptive management processes\nthat  address  specific  threats  in  pilot  PAs.  Details  of  the  role  of  GEF  and  the  incremental  cost\nanalysis are in Appendix 3.\n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates\n\n65.\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project,  including  taxes  and  duties,  physical  contingencies,  price\nescalation,  and  interest  charges,  is  estimated  at  $34.7  million  equivalent,  comprising  about\n$17.6 million (51 percent) in foreign exchange and $17.1 million equivalent (49 percent) in local\ncurrency  cost.  Table  1  summarizes  the  cost  estimates;  details  of  the  project  costs  are  in\nAppendix 7.\n\n\f21\n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nComponent\n\nA. Base Cost\n\n1.

A loan from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources\n66.\nin  the  amount  of  $12.0  million  equivalent  is  proposed  to  finance  approximately  $6.6  million  in\nforeign exchange costs (38 percent of total foreign exchange costs), and $5.4 million equivalent\nof  local  currency  costs  (32  percent  of  total  local  currency  costs),  with  a  term  of  32  years,\nincluding  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  with  an  interest  charge  of  1  percent  per  year  during  the\ngrace period and 1.5 percent per year thereafter. The GEF will cofinance the Project through a\ngrant  that  will  be  administered  by  ADB.27  A  memorandum  of  agreement  will  be  drawn  up\nbetween  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  (acting  as  Implementing  Agency  for  the  GEF  grant).  The\nGEF  grant  will  be  for  $10.2  million  equivalent:  $7.0  million  in  foreign  exchange  (40  percent  of\ntotal  foreign  exchange  costs)  and  $3.2  million  equivalent  in  local  currency  (19  percent  of  total\nlocal currency costs). GEF financing amounting to $4 million will be allocated to the PACT and\nthe  remaining  $6.2  million  will  finance  the  protection  of  global  benefits  in  each  of  the  other\ncomponents.    The  Government  of  the  Netherlands  has  indicated  interest  in  cofinancing  the\nPACT  in  an  amount  of  $4.0  million  subject  to  successful  bilateral  negotiations  with  the\nGovernment.  Board  approval  for  administering  the  amount  will  be  obtained  as  soon  as  the\ncofinancing  arrangements  are  firmed  up.  The  Government  will  finance  45  percent  of  the  local\ncurrency costs by contributing the equivalent of $7.7 million (22 percent of total project costs).\nThe  remaining  local  currency  costs  amounting  to  $0.9  million  will  be  financed  in  kind  by  the\nparticipating  NGOs/CBOs  and  beneficiaries  as  part  of  their  equity  contribution  for  the  income-\ngenerating activities.\n\n                                                \n27  Cofinancing is subject to the final approval of the Project by the GEF.\n\n\f22\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nSource\n\nAsian Development Bank\nGlobal Environment Facilitya\nGovernment of the Netherlandsb\nGovernment of Sri Lanka\nBeneficiaries\n      Total\nNote:  Figures may not add up to totals due to rounding.\na\nb\n\nForeign\nExchange\n6.6\n7.0\n4.0\n-\n-\n     17.6\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n5.4\n3.2\n-\n7.7\n0.9\n         17.1\n\nTotal\nCost\n12.0\n10.2\n  4.0\n  7.7\n  0.9\n34.7\n\nPercent\n35.0\n28.0\n12.0\n22.0\n  3.0\n     100.0\n\nFinancing is subject to the final endorsement by the GEF.\nSubject  to  the  final  agreements  reached  between  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  and  the  Government  of  the\nNetherlands\n\nThe proposed level of local currency financing by ADB takes into account the uncertain\n67.\nmedium-term economic prospects of the country and the Government\u2019s inability to self-finance a\nsubstantial  proportion  of  the  investment  program  required  to  enable  Sri  Lanka  to  undergo  the\neconomic  and  social  transition  to  a  higher  level  of  development  and  reduce  poverty.  The\nGovernment has recognized that there are severe limits to the extent of public sector financing\nof  the  country\u2019s  investment  program  and  has  taken  a  number  of  important  actions:  (i)\nimplementing  an  ambitious  privatization  program;  (ii)  counter-guaranteed  private  sector\nborrowing  on  the  international  capital  market  under  ADB\u2019s  guarantee  scheme;  (iii)  securing\nsubstantial private investment in capital-intensive industries such as power supply and ports; (iv)\ninitiating  an  ambitious  private  sector  development  program  in  2000,  aiming  to  further  privatize\nand restructure state-owned enterprises and address labor market rigidities. The proceeds from\nthe  privatization  program  are  expected  to  amount  to  about  2  percent  of  the  Gross  Domestic\nProduct (GDP) in 2000.\n\n68.\nDespite these actions and achievements, the overall capacity of the Government to self-\nfinance  the  public  investment  program  in  the  coming  years  is  expected  to  remain  limited.  The\n1999 budget deficit was 8.0 percent of GDP, an improvement on the 9.2 percent in 1998. This\noutcome  was  largely  due  to  the  lower  than  anticipated  tax  receipts  in  the  initial  years  of\noperation  of  the  goods  and  services  tax  that  was  introduced  in  1998,  and  the  larger  than\nanticipated outlays on capital investment. While the Government intends to reduce the budget\ndeficit  to  5  percent  of  GDP  by  2002,  in  2000,  it  has  been  projected  at  7.6  percent  of  GDP,  a\nslight  improvement  over  1999.  Therefore,  continued  ADB  support  for  local  cost  financing  is\nconsidered justified in view of the prevailing difficult country circumstances and the need for a\nsubstantial program of rehabilitation and replacement and improvement of the country\u2019s capital\nstock for it to successfully undergo the transition to a higher growth path. The proposed level of\nlocal  cost  financing  for  the  Project  is  considered  justified  especially  in  view  of  the  positive\nenvironmental  impact  that  the  Project  is  expected  to  have  and  the  associated  sustainable\nreduction in the level of poverty in the areas adjacent to the PAs.\n\nF.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nCoordination Arrangements\n\n69.\nThe Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWLC) will be the Executing Agency (EA) for\ncomponents  A  and  B.  DWLC  has  enhanced  its  financial  management  capacity  since  it\n\n\f23\n\nintroduced  expenditure  controls  in  end-1999.  The  Project  will  assist  in  the  strengthening  of\norganizational  systems  to  enable  work  program  and  budget  allocation  decision  making  to  be\ndecentralized to the new regional offices and field units with on-site management (Appendix 8).\nA  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  be  established  within  DWLC.  The  PMU  will  be\nresponsible  for  administering,  implementing,  monitoring,  reporting,  and  coordinating  all  project\nactivities  under  components  A  and  B.    It  will  be  headed  by  the  director  of  DWLC  acting  as\nproject  director;  supported  by  the  additional  director,  technical  of  DWLC  acting  as  project\ncoordinator; a full-time administration officer; and by clerical, financial, and other support staff on\na  full-time  basis.  A  Protected  Areas  Management  and  Wildlife  Conservation  Advisory\nCommittee  will  assist  the  minister  responsible  for  DWLC  on  the  development  of  policy  and\nlegislation,  with  the  PMU  acting  as  its  secretariat.    The  Advisory  Committee  will  comprise\nselected members of the existing Fauna and Flora Protection Advisory Committee, the existing\nTask Force on Wildlife Conservation, the PACT board of trustees, BCS, and others chosen to\ncomplete the representation of all key stakeholders. Within the national PA system, DWLC will\nestablish seven regions, each led by a deputy director who will have the delegated authority to\nnegotiate the work programs with the managers of each field unit along with the responsibility\nfor negotiating an agreed-upon budget with each field unit in the region.  In line with increased\nautonomy, the regional and field unit managers will be held responsible for both the work plan\noutputs and the budgetary performance. At the pilot PAs, a local coordinating committee will be\nestablished,  jointly  chaired  by  the  divisional  secretary  and  the  deputy  director  of  wildlife\n(regional)  with  representatives  from  the  local  government,  other  government  agencies,  local\nNGOs,  tourist  operators,  women\u2019s  groups,  and  other  stakeholders.    This  committee  will  be\nprogressively  institutionalized  into  the  PA  stakeholders  planning  forum  and  will  hold  quarterly\nmeetings  to  discuss  planned  activities  and  explore  the  potential  for  synergy  with  other  local\ndevelopment and conservation initiatives.\n\n70.\nMFE  as  the  country\u2019s  biodiversity  focal  point  will  be  the  EA  for  component  C,  the\nBiodiversity Conservation Secretariat (BCS) will be the Implementing Agency to undertake the\ncross-  sector  activities  including  development  of  the  BCAP.  The  BCS  will  form  a  multisectoral\nBCAP Task Force comprising all major stakeholders including representatives from civil society,\nprivate  sector,  and  academia.    This  task  force  will  lead  and  coordinate  the  preparation  of  the\nBCAP,  with  assistance  from  the  BCS  and  technical  support  from  the  Project  through  what  is\nenvisioned  to  be  a  2-3  year  process.    The  conservation  system  review  will  be  under  the\nsupervision of the BCS and implemented by a task force led by DWLC, comprising the existing\nplanning teams at DWLC and FD.  The task force will (i) use all existing information to identify\nimportant  gaps  in  the  PA  system  and  potential  links  between  PAs,  including  those  under  the\nmanagement  of  separate  agencies,  (ii)  formulate  an  action  plan  to  address  the  provision  of\nconservation benefits in the target areas, and (iii) play an active role in analyzing the strengths\nand weaknesses of the PA system.\n\nThe  PACT  will  be  operated  by  an  independent  board  of  trustees  and  its  assets  will  be\n71.\nmanaged  by  a  commercial  fund  manager.    The  board  will  comprise  six  independent  eminent\npersons  and  three  Government    members  representing  DWLC,  FD,  CCD,  respectively.  The\nboard  will  establish  a  secretariat,  headed  by  a  chief  executive  officer  with  qualifications  in\nadvanced  financial  management,  who  will  be  responsible  for  administering,  implementing,\nmonitoring,  reporting,  and  coordinating  all  PACT  activities.    An  overseas  commercial  fund\nmanager  or  management  company  will  be  contracted  by  the  board  to  invest  and  to  manage\nPACT\u2019s endowment and investment portfolio according to standards agreed upon by the board\nand  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  PACT  secretariat  will  prepare  detailed  operational  protocols  to\ngovern  contracts  between  the  PACT  and  NGOs/CBOs.  The  NGOs/CBOs  will  facilitate\npreparation of community action plans that will be used to mobilize resources.  The PACT will\n\n\f24\n\nprovide  technical  support  to  the  NGO/CBO  community  along  with  funds  for  completing  a\ncomprehensive community- and area-wide planning process. The PACT will also provide grants\nfor implementing the local planning proposals selectively. The focus of the grants made under\nthe PACT will be on the achievement of biodiversity outcomes through the contracting process,\nand  contractors  will  be  assessed  according  to  the  achievement  of  key  performance  indicators\n(KPIs).  The  KPIs  are  (i)  poverty  analysis,  including  participation  by  and  empowerment  of  the\npoorest  members  of  each  community;  (ii)  environmental  education  leading  to  a  consensus\nwithin the target community that environmental integrity and biodiversity are vital resources for\nits own development; (iii) analysis of conflicts of interest, facilitated negotiation of a settlement,\nand  formulation  of  an  agreement  between  the  community  and  PA  managers  concerning  their\nroles,  rights,  and  responsibilities  in  wildlife  and  PA  management;  and  (iv)  identification  of\ninvestments  that  address  the  threats  to  the  individual  PA.  A  more  detailed  description  of  the\noperating and implementing procedures of component D is in Appendix 6.\n\n72.\nAn  interagency  project  coordinating  committee  will  be  established  within  six  months  of\nloan  effectiveness,  to  be  chaired  by  the  secretary  of  MPAHA  for  cooperation  and  liaison  with\nother  agencies  relevant  to  implementation.    The  committee  will  have  representatives  from  the\nMinistry  of  Finance,  National  Planning  and  Development,  Ministry  of  Local  Government  and\nProvincial Councils, Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Agriculture and Lands, MFE, and Ministry of\nFisheries and Aquatic Resources Development.\n\n2.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n73.\nThe Project will be implemented over six years. During the first year, project activities will\nconcentrate  on  (i)  planning  all  measures  to  strengthen  DWLC,  including  the  preparation  of  a\ndetailed work plan; (ii) recruiting consultants to work with the PMU, including partner NGOs to\nundertake baseline surveys, and consultants to establish the PACT; (iii) beginning the training\nprograms;  (iv)  screening  and  identifying  all  potential  suppliers  of  goods  and  services;  and  (v)\nscreening  NGOs  for  training  funded  by  the  PACT.  Most  of  the  procurement  of  civil  works  and\nother goods and services will be undertaken in the second and third years of the Project. The\nPACT will train NGOs in the second and third years.  The first NGO contracts will be awarded at\nthe end of the second year. Upon successful pilot testing of the PACT activities in the selected\npilot  PAs,  its  operations  will  be  extended  to  cover  communities  adjacent  to  other  priority\nconservation areas as identified under the BCAP. A project implementation schedule is given in\nAppendix 9.\n\n3.\n\nProject Review\n\n74.\nThe project design will be subject to a constant review throughout implementation, and\nmechanisms have been incorporated to ensure that the design is sufficiently flexible to adapt to\na changing environment and to incorporate lessons that are being learned.  The Project will be\nreviewed twice annually.  These reviews will be undertaken jointly by the Government and ADB\nto (i) determine whether expected implementation is on track; (ii) determine whether the design\nis still appropriate; (iii) see whether outputs, effects, impacts, and benefits are being or will be\nrealized; (iv) assess the outputs and results achieved and consolidate lessons to improve their\nrealization during the remaining project period; (v) provide analytic feedback to the EAs and the\nPACT,  where  necessary,  to  justify  modifications  in  policies,  immediate  objectives,  institutional\narrangements,  areas  of  special  emphasis  and  resource \nthe  remaining\nimplementation  period;  and  (vi)  examine  whether  the  assumptions  made  in  the  project\nframework  remain  valid  or  whether  adjustments  are  required  to  ensure  achievement  of  the\noverall objectives.\n\nflows  during \n\n\f25\n\n4.\n\nProcurement of Goods and Services\n\na.\n\n Civil Works, Materials, and Equipment\n\nAll  procurement  of  civil  works,  materials,  and  equipment  will  be  in  accordance  with\n75.\nADB's Guidelines for Procurement.  Given that the value of each civil works contract will be less\nthan $1 million and in view of the competitive nature of the construction sector in Sri Lanka, civil\nworks contracts are not expected to be of interest to international bidders.  Thus, all civil works\ncontracts  will  be  awarded  to  prequalified  private  sector  contractors  under  local  competitive\nbidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Contracts  for  supply  of  materials,  vehicles,  and\nequipment  costing  $100,000-$500,000  will  be  awarded \ninternational  shopping\nprocedures acceptable to ADB, whereas those that cost below $100,000 will be procured on the\nbasis of direct purchase.\n\nthrough \n\nb.\n\nConsulting Services, NGO Services, and Training\n\nThe  Project  will  require  172  person-months  of  domestic  and  128  person-months  of\n76.\ninternational  consulting  services.    The  GEF  grant  will  fund  54  person-months  of  domestic  and\n85  person-months  of  international  consulting  services.    To  simplify  project  start-up,  all\nconsultants  will  be  recruited  by  the  Government  through  a  single  contracting  process  in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements  for  the\nuse  of  domestic  consultants  satisfactory  to  ADB.  Consultants  will  be  used  to  strengthen  the\ntechnical  and  managerial  capacity  of  DWLC  working  mostly  through  the  technical  units  in  the\nhead  office,  especially  the  Protected  Area  Management  Unit  within  which  the  monitoring  and\nteam  receive  considerable\nevaluation \nstrengthening. \ntechnical\nbackstopping,  reflecting  the  paucity  of  current  skills  and  lack  of  experience  of  the  field  staff  in\nthis  area.  The  consortium  of \nthe  monitoring  and  evaluation\nsubcomponent will be selected by the Government from a shortlist agreed upon between DWLC\nand  ADB,  on  the  basis  of  proposals  submitted  by  the  shortlisted  organizations.  A  similar\narrangement will be adopted in recruiting the international NGO with experience in conservation\ntrust funds for the twinning arrangement with the PACT. Training will be provided by the Giritale\nTraining  Center  with  specialist  training  procured  both  locally  and  internationally  (Details  in\nAppendix 10).\n\n  The  Community  Outreach  Unit  will  also  receive  significant \n\nthe  visitor  services  and  ecotourism \n\ninternational  NGOs \n\nteam  and \n\nfor \n\n5.\n\nAccounts, Audits, and Reports\n\na.\n\nAccounts and Audits\n\n77.\nAll agencies involved in implementation will prepare and maintain separate accounts for\nproject-related  disbursements.    The  PMU  will  consolidate  the  accounts  from  all  sources  and\nthen submit them to DWLC, which will review and then submit them to the Ministry of Finance\nand  ADB.  All  project  accounts  will  be  independently  audited  on  an  annual  basis.    The  audit\nreport will include, among others, a statement verifying that funds disbursed by ADB against the\nstatement of expenditures (SOE) have been used as claimed.  Project accounts, together with\ndisbursement documentation, will be audited annually with all reports forwarded to ADB and the\nGovernment  within  12  months  of  the  end  of  each  financial  year.    Imprest  accounts  will  be\nestablished  by  both  DWLC  and  MFE,  which  will  take  direct  responsibility  for  all  administrative\nand  accounting  requirements  relating  to  the  operation  and  use  of  such  funds.    The  SOE\nprocedures  will  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  with  a  total  contract  value  not\nexceeding the equivalent of $100,000 and to liquidate advances covered in the imprest account.\n\n\f26\n\nDWLC and MFE will establish an imprest account with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.  The initial\nadvance for each imprest account will be based on the estimated expenditures for six months.\nThe  imprest  account  and  SOE  procedure  will  be  established,  operated,  and  maintained  in\naccordance  with  ADB  procedures.  Both  will  be  audited  as  part  of  the  regular  audit  of  the\nProject\u2019s  account,  with  financial  statements  and  audit  opinion  set  out  separately  within  12\nmonths from the end of the fiscal year. The PACT, once formed, will maintain separate financial\naccounts  that  will  be  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors.    The  audited  PACT  financial\nstatements and annual report will be submitted to ADB and the Government within six months of\nthe end of each financial year.\n\nb.\n\nReports\n\nThe  PMU  will  furnish  ADB  and  the  Government  with  quarterly  and  annual  progress\n78.\nreports, and a publicly available project completion report within three months of the end of the\nProject.   The  PACT  secretariat  will  furnish the board with quarterly progress reports on PACT\nactivities,  and  will  prepare  and  publish  for  sale  to  the  public,  at  cost,  an  annual  report  that\noutlines the achievements of the previous year and proposed future activities.  Complimentary\ncopies  of  the  annual  report  will  go  to  ADB,  the  Government,  and  all  members  of  the  board  of\ntrustees.    The  PACT  and  DWLC  will  furnish  ADB  with  annual  reports  on  the  progress  of  the\npartnership  with  NGOs,  the  effectiveness  of  such  partnerships,  and  problems  faced  including\nrecommendations  regarding  such  problems.  GEF  grant  reporting  will  comply  with  GEF\nrequirements and will be undertaken by ADB as agreed upon by ADB and the World Bank and\ndetailed in the memorandum of agreement signed by the respective parties.\n\n6.\n\nBenefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n\nto \n\nintegral \n\nMonitoring  systems  are \n\nthe  MIS,  reporting  arrangements, \n\n79.\nlines  of\naccountability, and incentive mechanisms to be established by the Project within DWLC.  They\nwill generate a database of organized knowledge on the performance of all aspects of DWLC.\nMonitoring and reporting arrangements will be complemented by impact assessments every two\nyears of the Project as a whole, with assistance from a consortium of two NGOs, one oriented to\nconservation  and  one  to  community  development.  Impact  assessment  will  assess  the  status\nand trends applicable to all major resources of the pilot PAs, the suitability and sustainability of\nPA  management  and  community  strengthening  and  partnership-building  arrangements,  the\nintegrity of PA managers and the degree of stakeholder participation in resource management\ndecisions.    A  publicly  available  report  will  be  prepared  within  two  months  of  the  end  of  each\nassessment.\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1. \n\nEnvironment\n\n80.\nThe  Project  is  classified  as  environment  category  B.    An  initial  environmental\nassessment  (IEE)  undertaken  during  project  preparation  concluded  that  the  Project  would  be\noverwhelmingly  beneficial  from  both  an  environmental  and  a  social  perspective.    The  benefits\nwould  come  primarily  from  DWLC\u2019s  improved  capacity  to  plan  and  manage  activities  in  and\nadjacent to PAs, in response to international and national biodiversity protection imperatives as\nwell  as  to  local  development  needs.  Few  potentially  adverse  environmental  impacts  were\nidentified.    Most  are  localized  and  of  minor  significance,  for  which  mitigation  measures  are\nreadily available.  No project components are expected to result in major adverse environmental\nimpacts.    Adverse  impacts  due  to  the  development  and  implementation  of  ecotourism\n\n\f27\n\nconcession agreements were considered of potentially moderate significance.  The concessions\nwill  be  of  a  modest  scale,  and  with  the  envisaged  broad-based  participatory  planning,  strong\nenforcement, and regular monitoring, the actual impacts during implementation are expected to\nbe insignificant.  The Project actively supports regular site evaluations involving both DWLC and\nwider  stakeholders,  which  will  provide  an  audit  of  local  impacts.  The  preparation  of  plans  to\nexpand  the  PA  system  to  incorporate  important  new  sites  will  follow  ADB  and  Government\npolicies  on  compensation.    Support  for  local  development  proposals  in  buffer  zones  will  be\ncontingent  on  the  proposals  demonstrating  that  conservation  is  a  primary  or  secondary\nobjective,  and  that  they  meet  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  assessment  requirements.\nReliance  on  the  \u201cprecautionary  principle\u201d  and  on  adaptive  management  practices  with  close\nstakeholder participation is expected to help ensure that all project activities are environmentally\nsound.  A checklist of the environmental parameters and potential impacts is in Appendix 11.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Assessment28\n\n81.\nAn  estimated  1.5  million  people  live  adjacent  to  the  PAs.  Project  pilot  sites  are\nassociated  with  some  192  villages  with  40,000  households  and  an  estimated  180,000  people.\nMany  of  these  communities  developed  from  in-migration,  resulting  in  heterogeneous  social\nstructures  in  terms  of  ethnicity  and  religious  affiliations,  while  many  have  limited  historical\nintrafamilial links. Poverty based on the Samurdhi poverty line for the pilot sites falls within the\n40-70  percent  range:  22-32  percent  in  eastern  Ude  Walawe,  48-100  percent  in  Western  Ude\nWalawe,  75  percent  in  Wasgamuwa,  65  percent  in  Ritigala,  58-90  percent  in  Southern  Peak\nWilderness,  70 percent  in Bundala,  and 36-52 percent at Minneriya.   These are much higher\nthan the national average of 21 percent.  Villagers identified poverty as the root cause of illegal\nand unsustainable exploitation of resources in the PAs.\n\n82.\nThe underlying cause of PA-community interaction is poverty in both direct and indirect\nterms.  Through  participatory  rapid  appraisals,  the  following  issues  were  identified:  (i)  limited\naccess  to  land  with  secure  use  rights;  (ii)  continued  fragmentation  of  land  resources;  (iii)\nreduced access to resources including nontimber forest products, irrigation water, and drinking\nwater; (iv) limited access to markets and formal credit; (v) limited access to social infrastructure\nand services; (vi) lack of employment opportunities, which remain highly seasonal with the result\nthat many join the armed forces; (vii) increased dependence on Government welfare, resulting\nin greater opportunity for political interference; and (viii) reduced choices, leading to increased\nillegal  activities.    The  Project  addresses  these  issues  through  the  development  of  microplans,\narea  plans,  and  the  financing  of  seed  grants  with  a  strong  emphasis  on  developing  lasting\nparticipatory  processes  that  establish  collaborative  decisions  both  within  and  between  the  PA\ncommunities.    The  provision  of  ongoing  financing  of  this  activity  through  the  PACT  and  the\ndevelopment of local NGO capacity are inputs that previous projects were unable to establish.\n\nPoverty  is  also  strongly  linked  to  the  insecure  resource  basis  and  unstable/casual\n83.\nemployment, leading the poor to work as casual laborers. They are vulnerable to co-optation in\nsupport  of  illicit  activities  such  as  livestock  grazing,  logging,  poaching,  and  gemstone  mining\nwithin  the  PAs,  acting  for  low  wages  on  behalf  of  organized  gangs  and  businessmen  from\nelsewhere.  Through  PRA  exercises,  villagers,  especially  the  youth,  were  convinced  that  unity\nand cohesion among the community members to be vigilant against such illicit jobs are crucial\nto their sustainable livelihoods.\n\n                                                \n28  A two-phased social analysis was completed during project preparation.  Phase one involved consultations with\n30 communities to identify socioeconomic characteristics and their development aspirations.  This was followed\nby a series of detailed participatory rapid appraisal processes involving nine villages from the pilot PAs.\n\n\f28\n\nThe  social  assessment  also  found  that,  while  there  are  no  significant  gender  gaps  in\n84.\nterms of either social indicators or child labor issues, women still bear the burden of poverty due\nto  their  multiple  roles  as  economic  producers  and  family  caretakers.  Depletion  of  natural\nresources, especially fuelwoods, significantly affects their workload.  In several villages, women\nobserved that  the  amount of time needed to collect one bundle of fuelwood has doubled over\nthe  last  10  years.    Although  the  number  of  female-headed  households  in  the  studied  villages\nwas,  on  average,  marginal,  it  was  high  among  Muslim  communities  as  husbands  abandon\nwives  due  to  polygamy.    Female-headed  households  were  identified  as  among  the  most\ndisadvantaged  groups,  as  they  are  sole  income  earners  and  have  very  limited  access  to\nresources and information.  Further, liquor addiction, mainly of men, leads to family conflict and,\nin some cases, domestic violence. While women represent more than 90 percent of the savings\ngroup  members,  their  participation  in  community  decision-making  bodies  is  still  limited.  A\ndetailed social analysis is presented in Appendix 5.\n\nA.   \n\nFinancial Analysis and Sustainability\n\nV.      PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\n85.\nProject  sustainability  is  determined  in  part  by  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  support  the\nrecurrent  costs  of  the  project-related  activities.  The  Project  will  increase  the  operating  cost  of\nDWLC  by  $235,000  per  annum  simply  as  a  result  of  the  increased  provision  for  staff,  and\noperation and maintenance for vehicles and other equipment.  This cost is offset by the increase\nin  Government  revenues  from  tourism  visitation  derived  from  entrance  fees,  service  charges,\nand  vehicle  fees  and  the  payment  of  the  goods  and  services  tax.    Of  all  income-generating\nopportunities offered by the Project, the most significant are those related to ecotourism, which\nis a strong theme in components A, B, and D.  Revenue from ecotourism is expected to have a\nsignificant impact on the Government treasury and potentially on incomes of local communities.\nThe  financial  analysis  of  the  ecotourism-related  components  assumes  that  the  Government\u2019s\nprojections  of  foreign  visitor  arrivals  will  be  achieved  and  maintained  throughout  the  project\nperiod.  However, this component is financially viable even with a more conservative projection\nof foreign visitor arrivals.  The incremental benefits of the Project are derived from an increase\nin  the  number  of  foreign  visitors  to  PAs  (beginning  with  a  1  percent  increase  in  year  6  of  the\nProject,  to  a  maximum  of  5  percent  by  year  10  and  thereafter),  and  in  entrance  and  service\ncharges  (10  percent  increase  beginning  in  year  6).    National  visitors  to  PAs  and  the\ncorresponding entrance and service charges are also expected to increase from year 6 of the\nProject.    In  addition  to  the  direct  revenue  from  incremental  visitors  and  charges  of  PAs,  the\nGovernment  will  earn  revenue  from  taxes  and  levies  on  the  sale  of  incremental  goods  and\nservices  developed  by  communities  in  the  support  zones  that  benefit  from  the  Project\ninterventions.  Overall, it is anticipated that the direct incremental revenue just from ecotourism\nalone could be between $1.0 and $2.3 million each year as a result of the Project.\n\n86.\nThe  sustainability  of  project  interventions  financed  by  the  PACT  will  depend  on  the\nextent  to  which  communities  adopt  alternative  income-generating  activities.  Examples  of\nactivities  that  will  benefit  local  communities  are  fenced  cattle  grazing,  community  fuelwood\nproduction,  production  of  buffalo  curd,  and  operation  of  rice  storehouses.    Individual  financial\nmodels  of  several  such  typical  activities  illustrate  their  financial  viability.    For  example,  the\ncommunity fuelwood model suggests a financial rate of return of 60 percent; the cattle grazing\nmodel  has  a  35  percent  rate  of  return,  and  the  community-operated  rice  storehouse  model\nwould have a return of 16 percent.\n\n\f29\n\nThe Government has agreed to a revenue-sharing policy that allows DWLC to retain 50\n87.\npercent  revenue  derived  from  PAs.    Based  on  the  expected  increase  in  tourism  numbers  and\nthe associated revenue, the recurrent costs will be covered by the end of year 6. As such, the\nadditional  recurrent  costs  of  the  Project  are  significantly  less  than  the  DWLC  share  of  the\nrevenues.    From  the  perspective  of  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal  position,  the  Project  will  have  a\npositive impact based on conservative tourism growth data.\n\nB.   \n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n88.\nThe  Project  will  generate  significant  economic  benefits  (Appendix  12).    Above  all,  the\nprotection  provided  to  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  rich  and  largely  endemic  biodiversity  provides  benefits  to\nsociety  at  local,  national,  and  global  levels.    At  the  local  level,  communities  will  benefit  from\nemployment and improvement in living standards generated by the demand for ecotourism and\nrelated services.  Benefits at the national level include (i) the ability to cater to the ecotourism\nniche  market  and  generate  significant  forward  linkages  within  the  national  economy;  (ii)  the\nability  to  attract  foreign  direct  investment  in  ecotourism  and  biodiversity-related  areas;  (iii)  the\nability  to  comply  with  international  commitments  on  protection  of  biodiversity;  (iv)  the  option\nvalue  of  preserving  biological  resources  for  future  exploitation,  particularly  for  bio-prospecting\nand  research;  and  (v)  the  opportunity  to  demonstrate  effective  and  decentralized  governance\nthrough a strengthened and better trained DWLC.  Global society will benefit from (i) enhanced\ncarbon sequestration potential of the PAs; (ii) protection of endemic species; (iii) maintenance of\nhabitats  used  by  internationally  mobile  species,  especially  turtles  and  waterfowl;  and  (iv)  less\ntangibly, from the existence value of better managed PAs in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe  community  partnerships  developed  with  assistance  provided  by  the  PACT  will\n89.\ngenerate substantial economic benefits to initially about 180,000 people living in the vicinity of\nthe PAs, more than 50 percent of whom are poor.  The project interventions will benefit them in\nseveral ways, giving them (i) the ability to undertake collective planning and decision making, (ii)\nthe  ability  to  exercise  empowerment  by  obtaining  financing  for  community  development\ninitiatives, and (iii) new employment opportunities through the income-generating activities.  The\noverall  impact  will  be  an  improvement  in  the  standard  of  living  of  these  people  and  mutually\nreinforcing  and  sustainable  interactions  with  the  PAs  and  buffer  zones  adjacent  to  their\ncommunities.\n\n90.\nThe  preceding  benefits  are  largely  nonquantifiable.  A  partial  economic  analysis  was\nconducted  focusing  on  the  project  interventions  associated  with  ecotourism  development  -\nmainly the activities covered in components A and B of the Project.  All costs were broken into\ntheir  traded,  nontraded,  labor,  and  tax  factors  and  converted  to  import  parity  prices.  For\nnontradables,  a  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.9  was  applied  to  derive  economic  prices.  A\nshadow wage rate factor of 0.81 was used to derive the economic cost of labor. Only the direct\nrevenues from ecotourism and Government taxes accruing from the sale of goods and services\ndeveloped  by  support  zone  communities  were  considered  in  the  analysis.  The  benefit  stream\nfrom  national  tourists  was  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  willingness  to  pay  for  wildlife-based\nrecreational opportunities, derived from a study conducted in Sri Lanka29 in 1997. The data gave\nan economic internal rate of return estimated at 18 percent.\n\n                                                \n29  Silva,  K.A.D.I.,  and  H.  B.  Kotagama.  1997.

Res. 9:317-329.\n\n\fC.   \n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n30\n\n91.\nThe  Project  will  positively  affect  the  lives  of,  initially,  40,000  households  or  180,000\npeople living in 192 villages near the seven selected pilot PAs.30 The people living in rural areas\naround  PAs  have,  on  average,  the  least  secure  livelihoods  in  Sri  Lanka.    They  also  have  the\nleast influence on public investment, and the fewest opportunities to participate fairly in rewards\nflowing  from  private  investment.  The  Project  will  establish  mechanisms  that  will  systematically\nassist these people.  Its strategy for social progress is both participatory and flexible, based on\nan approach that is process oriented and will be developed adaptively during the Project.  The\nProject will strengthen the target communities, and by so doing encourage and enable them to\nbecome agents of their own development and equal partners in benefit-sharing arrangements.\n\nBenefits  will  flow  from  the  capture  of  incremental  resources  by  communities  that  are\n92.\nbetter able to articulate their development priorities to potential funding agencies and investors.\nAbout 200 communities in the pilot areas will undergo the PACT action-planning process during\nthe Project, with a steady increase in scope and impact thereafter due to the permanent nature\nof  the  PACT  and  the  irreversible  effects  of  environmental  education,  partnership  building,  and\ncommunity  empowerment.    Other  local  benefits  will  arise  from  project  activities  that  promote\necotourism, attract additional visitors, and increase the demand for accommodation, guides, and\nother goods and services.  The resulting, cumulative social benefits in the areas around PAs will\nbe  widespread,  and  targeted  to  the  most  needy.  While  the  Project  does  not  include  a\ncomponent  specifically  targeting  women,  the  facilitating  NGOs/CBOs  will  be  trained  in  such  a\nway  as  to  ensure  equal  benefits  and  participation  for  men  and  women.    Female-headed\nhouseholds will be targeted as part of the most needy groups.\n\n93.\nThe  interests  of  broader  society  will  be  served  by  the  Project  in  several  more  general\nways.  First, the Project will promote the grassroots skills and relationships that are needed to\nmake decentralized systems of governance work for people, thus reinforcing and improving the\neffect of a wide range of Government policies.  Second, nature-based recreational opportunities\nwill multiply and directly benefit the hundreds of thousands of Sri Lankans who currently crowd\nthe tiny number of available facilities each year.  Third, better-run and better-equipped PAs will\nprovide many new opportunities for educational visits by schoolchildren and university students.\nFinally,  improved  arrangements  for  ecological  and  biodiversity  research  will  allow  more  of  the\nnation\u2019s  biological  wealth  to  be  documented  and  used  sustainably  to  diversify  the  Sri  Lankan\neconomy and further enrich its culture.\n\nD.   \n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n94.\nThe  Project  is  not  intended  directly,  quickly,  and  on  its  own  to  lift  large  numbers  of\npeople out of poverty. Instead, it will complement direct transfers to the poor by strengthening\nthe  ability  of  their  communities  to  mobilize  and  use  new  resources  from  a  wide  range  of\ngovernment and nongovernment grant, credit and public investment programs, and those from\nother  funding  agencies.    By  promoting  the  cohesion  and  articulacy  of  target  communities,\nproviding them with a powerful governmental ally through partnership with DWLC, and forums\nfor making their case to divisional secretaries and other powerful decision makers, it is expected\nthat  both  their  overall  economic  efficiency  and  ability  to  capture  investments  will  increase\nmarkedly.   This will be added to the effect of some direct employment, but more significantly to\nthe  impact  of  extra  opportunities  for  employment  and  self-employment  associated  with\n                                                \n30  The surveys undertaken in the pilot PAs during project processing did not detect any communities living within\nthe  PAs.    Therefore,  no  resettlement  is  envisaged  under  the  Project.    Should,  however,  resettlement  become\nnecessary during project implementation, ADB safeguard policies in this regard will apply.\n\n\f31\n\nincreased  visitor  flows,  and  investment  by  the  Project  and  the  private  sector  in  ecotourism\ndevelopment.\n\n95.\nThe  Project\u2019s  beneficial  impacts  on  poverty  and  deprivation  among  local  people  are\nexpected to flow mainly from (i) 25,000 person-days of direct employment at DWLC as laborers;\n(ii)  increased  employment  from  private-sector  investment  in  ecotourism  operations  in  and\naround  PAs;  (iii)  increased  opportunities  for  self-employment  by  local  people  in  providing\necotourism  services;  (iv)  increased  income  from  the  sale  of  handicrafts  and  other  goods  and\nservices to visitors; (v) implementation of environmentally sound community activities funded by\noutreach grants from PA managers and grants from the PACT; (vi) relief of the human-elephant\nconflict, including reduced incidence of damage to life and property and speedier settlement of\ncompensation  claims;  and  especially  (vii)  increased  social  cohesion  and  communal  ability  to\nmobilize  resources  that  are  available  from  the  Government  and  other  sources  to  meet  newly\narticulated community development needs.  The overall effect of the Project is expected to be\nprofoundly enriching for the poorest and least powerful members of local society.\n\nE.    Risks\n\n96.\nThe Project risks are (i) prolonged implementation delay due to inadequate availability of\na counterpart budget and the limited capacity of the EAs, (ii) inadequately addressed beneficiary\ninvolvement,  (iii)  inadequate  law  enforcement  within  PAs,  and  (vi)  lack  of  political  and\nbureaucratic support.  To minimize these risks, the project design (i) takes into account the fact\nthat DWLC has already been strengthened by UNDP/GEF; (ii) promotes benefit-sharing, direct\nand  indirect  employment,  and  capacity  building  in  and  partnerships  with  local  society;  (iii)\ncontains  a  pilot  investment  process;  (iv)  promotes  interagency  cooperation  to  reduce  planning\nfailure,  and  will  address  underlying  ecological  and  social  problems  whatever  their  origin;  (v)\npromotes strong, adaptive, and flexible PA management and stronger enforcement capabilities;\n(vi)  promotes  consistent  national  support  by  DWLC  and  other  agencies,  including  policy  and\nlegislative  development;  (vii)  allows  for  exposure  to  international  experience  among  selected\ngovernment  and  nongovernment  institutions;  and  (viii)  mandates  regular,  independent,\ncomprehensive, and public impact assessments.\n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVI.      ASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n97.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nWithin  one  year  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  have  prepared  and\nsubmitted to Parliament a bill for wildlife conservation, amending the Fauna and\nFlora  Protection  Ordinance  in  accordance  with  the  National  Wildlife  Policy  of\n2000.\n\nThe  BCS  within  MFE  will  form  a  multisectoral  task  force  comprising  expert\nmembers to develop a BCAP, consistent with the National Wildlife Policy of 2000\nand  reflecting  the  concerns  of  all  relevant  government  and  nongovernment\nstakeholders.    The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  BCAP  will  have  been\nprepared and published within three years of loan effectiveness.\n\n\f32\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nNo  disbursements  for  component  D  of  the  Project  will  be  made  until  (a)\narrangements  satisfactory \nto  ADB  have  been  made  with  one  or  more\ncofinanciers, in addition to GEF, for the contribution of an amount equivalent to at\nleast $4.0 million to the Protected Area Conservation Trust (PACT), and (b) the\nPACT  will  have  been  established  in  a  form  satisfactory  to  ADB  and  the\nGovernment and a board of trustees and/or board of directors, as the case may\nbe, acceptable to ADB will have been appointed.\n\nThe  Government  will  refrain  from  any  action  that  may  interfere  with  the\nindependence of the PACT.\n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that,  to  the  extent  allowed  under  the  laws  of  Sri\nLanka, relief from any taxes and levies will be granted in respect of the funds of\nthe PACT, including income earned on such funds, and any assets of the PACT.\nIn  the  event  of  a  change  in  the  law  that  would  adversely  affect  the  tax  regime\napplicable  to  the  PACT,  the  Government  will  make  its  best  efforts  to  assist  in\nrestructuring  the  PACT  in  such  a  way  that  its  holdings  and  income  earned\ntherefrom will not be subject to any taxes and levies.\n\nThe  Government  will  cause  at  least  50  percent  of  the  revenues  generated  by\nDWLC\u2019s PAs to be transferred to the Wildlife Preservation Fund for the purpose\nof  (a)  capital  expenditures  of  DWLC,  (b)  community  awards  and  outreach\nprograms  of  those  communities  that  reside  in  the  PAs  impact  zone;  (c)  DWLC\nstaff incentives and awards; (d) casual wages and field staff allowances; and (e)\nfinancing the elephant damage compensation program, until it has been replaced\nby an appropriate insurance scheme.\n\n(vii)  DWLC  will  maintain  one  separate,  interest-bearing  account  for  the  Wildlife\nPreservation  Fund  and  will  channel  all  revenues  for  and  expenditures  from  the\nWildlife  Preservation  Fund  exclusively  through  this  account.    The  Government\nwill have this account audited annually by independent auditors.\n\n(viii)  Within  one  year  of  loan  effectiveness,  DWLC  will  establish  and  commence\nimplementation  of  a  system  to  delegate  the  authority  and  responsibility  for  the\npreparation  and  management  of  annual  work  plans  and  related  budgets  for  the\nfield  programs  to  the  regional  offices  and  protected  area  field  units,  under  the\nsupervision  of  the  additional  director,  technical.  Within  three  years  of  loan\neffectiveness, the heads of regional offices will have the level of deputy director.\n\n (ix)\n\nThe  Government  will  appoint  all  new  permanent  wildlife  guards  and  temporary\nlaborers  to  be  stationed  in  a  pilot  PA  from  among  people  residing  within  five\nkilometers of the boundaries of the same area.\n\n (x)\n\nThe Government will ensure that annually, DWLC prepares a report on national\nwildlife status and trends and that this report will be publicly available.\n\n(xi) Within  six  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  have  engaged  a\nconsortium  of  international  NGOs  acceptable  to  ADB  to  undertake  baseline\nsurveys  in  the  first  year  and  independent  impact  assessments  in  the  third  and\nsixth years of the Project.\n\n\f33\n\n(xii) Within  two  years  of  loan  effectiveness,  DWLC  will  have  commenced  the\nimplementation  of  contracts  with  local  communities/private  sector  for  their\nenvironmentally low-impact operation of all DWLC tourist bungalows retained for\ntourist purposes.  Such contracts will be on an arm\u2019s-length basis and on terms\nand conditions satisfactory to the Government and ADB.\n\n(xiii)  DWLC  will  prepare,  through  a  fully  participatory  process  involving  the  local\ncommunities - both men and women -  an operational plan to survey, delineate,\ndemarcate,  and  map  the  boundaries  of  the  pilot  PAs.  The  boundaries  will  be\nestablished  in  such  a  way  that  no  existing  villages  would  lie  within  the  PA\nboundaries.  To  the  extent  that  there  would  be  a  need  to  relocate  people  living\nwithin  the  boundaries  of  a  pilot  PA,  DWLC  will  prepare  and  implement  a\nresettlement  plan  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Handbook  on  Resettlement  and\nsatisfactory to ADB.\n\nB.\n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness\n\n98.\n\nPrior to loan effectiveness, the following will be completed:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  Government  will  have  established  the  PMU  with  the  director  of  DWLC  as\nproject director, and the additional director, technical as project coordinator; and\nappointed  administrative,  financial,  clerical,  and  other  support  staff  required  to\noperate the PMU.\n\nThe  Government  will  have  established  a  separate,  interest-bearing  account  for\nthe  operation  of  the  Wildlife  Preservation  Fund  and  will  have  transferred  all\nmonies belonging to the Wildlife Preservation Fund into that account.\n\n(iii) \n\nThe GEF grant will have been approved by the GEF.\n\nVII.      RECOMMENDATION\n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\n99.\nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  (i)  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to\nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  8,997,000  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the\nProtected  Area  Management  and  Wildlife  Conservation  Project,  with  a  term  of  32  years,\nincluding  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1  percent  per\nannum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter and such other terms and\nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement\npresented  to  the  Board;  and  (ii)  if  GEF  approves  the  provision  to  the  Government  of  the\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka of a grant in an amount not exceeding the equivalent\nof  $10,200,000  for  the  Protected  Area  Management  and  Wildlife  Conservation  Project,  the\nadministration by ADB of this grant.\n\n04 September 2000\n\nTADAO CHINO\nPresident\n\n\fPage\n\nCited on\n(page, para.)\n\n35\n\n38\n\n39\n\n44\n\n49\n\n56\n\n59\n\n61\n\n62\n\n63\n\n69\n\n71\n\n1, 2\n\n8, 25\n\n13, 40\n\n14, 43\n\n15, 47\n\n15, 48\n\n20, 65\n\n22, 69\n\n24, 73\n\n25, 76\n\n26, 80\n\n28, 88\n\n34\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNumber\n\nTitle\n\nProject Framework\n\nExternal Assistance\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\nF\n\nG\n\nH\n\nI\n\nJ\n\nK\n\nThe Role of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) in the\nProject\n\nPilot  Protected  Areas,  Analysis  of  Threats  and  Root\nCauses, and the Adaptive Threat Management Process\n\nSocial Assessment and Strategy\n\nProtected Area Conservation Trust\n\nDetailed Cost Summary\n\nDepartment  of  Wildlife  Conservation  Organizational\nDiagram\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nConsulting  Services,  Partnerships,  Project \nMonitoring, and Capacity Building\n\nImpact\n\nChecklist of Environmental Parameters and Potential\nImpacts\n\nFinancial, Sustainability and Economic Analyses\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIXES\n(available on request)\n\nDetailed Terms of Reference for Consultants\n\nPartnership Building Processes\n\nProject Alternatives Considered and Rejected\n\nEcotourism\n\nSummary Initial Environmental Examination\n\nInitial Environmental Examination\n\nSynthesis of Issues from Social Assessments\n\nDetailed Cost Tables\n\nRevenue Sharing\n\nSTAP Review and Response\n\nGEF Project Brief\n\n\f35\n\nAppendix 1, page 1\n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\n\nDesign Summary\n\nPerformance Targets\n\nMonitoring Mechanisms\n\nAssumptions and Risks\n\n1.

The protected area (PA) system comprises 143 units totaling 9,700 km,2 or\n15 percent of land area, of which 73 units (85 percent by area) are managed by the Department\nof  Wildlife  Conservation  (DWLC).    The  Project\u2019s  development  objective  is  to  conserve  wildlife\nbiodiversity  and  to  help  protect  the  key  elements  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  environmental  infrastructure,\nand  thus  avert  national  economic  losses  and  improve  local  livelihoods.    Key  performance\nindicators  (KPIs)  include  (i)  reduced  rates  of  ecosystem  exploitation,  depletion  and  loss  of\nbiodiversity; and (ii) establishment of strong and adaptive systems to reduce poverty, strengthen\ncommunities  near  PA  boundaries,  manage  PAs,  and  build  and  maintain  interinstitutional\npartnerships.\n\nB. \n\nRationale for GEF Involvement\n\nSri Lanka is considered to be the most biodiverse country in Asia per unit area, and is\n2.\npart of a global biodiversity hot spot.  About half of all its native species are endemic, including\nall  freshwater  crabs,  90  percent  of  amphibians,  25-75  percent  of  reptiles  and  invertebrates\ndepending on taxon, around 50 percent of freshwater fishes, 26 percent of flowering plants, 14\npercent of mammals, and at least as many nonmigrant birds.  Species richness is extreme, and\nthe  island  also  provides  critical  habitat  for  many  internationally  mobile  species,  including  5\nspecies of endangered marine turtle, about 100 species of waterfowl, and many other migratory\nbirds. This wild biodiversity is complemented by genetic resources of cultivated and other useful\nplants, with hundreds of distinct varieties of rice, pepper, cardamom, betel, grain legumes, root\nand  tuber  crops,  vegetables  of  the  Cucurbitaceae  and  Solanaceae,  and  fruit  crops  including\nbanana, mango, and citrus.\n\nThe  Project\u2019s  global  biodiversity  objective  is  to  protect  ecosystems  with  high  levels  of\n3.\nspecies richness and endemicity by relieving the threats to them and associated root causes of\npoverty, planning failure, alien weed invasions, and institutional weakness, and hence to avert\nsignificant erosion of global biodiversity.  Relevant KPIs include (i) establishment of an effective\nprocess  to  encourage  and  enable  rural  communities  close  to  PA  boundaries  to  seek\nenvironmentally sustainable development; (ii) enhancement of DWLC\u2019s institutional capacity to\nmanage  PAs;  and  (iii)  institutionalization  of  new  processes  for  dialogue,  partnership-building,\nand benefit sharing among PA communities, PA managers, and natural resource management\ninstitutions.\n\n4.\nGlobal benefits from the Project will flow from (i) survival of endemic lineages, species,\nand higher taxa that would otherwise go extinct; (ii) survival of ecosystems that are under threat\nelsewhere;  (iii)  maintenance  of  populations  of  internationally  mobile  species,  including  migrant\nbirds  throughout  Eurasia  and  marine  turtles;  (iv)  development  and  testing  of  replicable\nconservation process models1 of direct relevance to other GEF-supported initiatives throughout\nthe  world;  and  (v)  enhanced  international  linkage  and  shared  learning  among  conservation\nagencies and nongovernment organizations (NGOs).\n                                                \n1  Sri Lanka is the most densely populated country among the biodiversity hot spots.\n\n\f40\n\nAppendix 3, page 2\n\nThese global benefits are mostly unquantifiable, but are highly significant owing to (i) the\n5.\nhigh prevailing levels of species richness and endemicity within Sri Lankan ecosystems; (ii) the\ndiversity of these ecosystems and the relatively soluble nature of threats to them; (iii) the large\nnumbers  of  migrating  birds  and  nesting  turtles  observed  routinely  in  Sri  Lanka;  (iv)  the\ninnovative and holistic nature of the project design, and its integration with emerging policy and\nlaw;  and  (v)  the  eagerness  of  Sri  Lankan  conservationists  to  interact  with  selected  foreign\ninstitutions and the mutual relevance of their experience.\n\nThe  Project  is  compliant  with  the  GEF  Operational  Strategy  in  the  focal  area  of\n6.\nbiodiversity, and will contribute positively to all relevant operational programs, specifically those\non  arid  and  semiarid  ecosystems  (OP1),  coastal,  marine  and  freshwater  ecosystems  (OP2),\nforest  ecosystems  (OP3),  and  mountain  ecosystems  (OP4).    The  Project  fully  agrees  with  the\nGEF  aims  of  (i)  conserving  biodiversity  and  tropical  forests,  (ii)  reducing  net  greenhouse  gas\nemissions,  (iii)  maintaining  genetic  resources,  (iv)  empowering  the  principal  groups  and\npromoting  local  participation  in  environmental  management,  (v)  building  national  capacity  to\nmainstream  biodiversity  conservation,  and  (vi)  developing  international  best  practices  and\npromoting  their  worldwide  replication.    The  various  components  of  the  Project  are,  however,\ninterlinked  and  mutually  dependent,  and  need  to  be  advanced  simultaneously  to  achieve\nsignificant  global,  national,  and  local  benefits.    The  GEF  will  therefore  contribute  to  all  project\ncomponents,  but  GEF  resources  will  be  allocated  to  investments  linked  directly  to  the  most\nsignificant global benefits and where intergenerational equity is expected to be derived.\n\n7.\nThe GEF grant will finance (i) consulting services to the Project Management Unit and\nthe  Protected  Area  Conservation  Trust  (PACT);  (ii)  50  percent  of  the  trust  endowment;  (iii)\npartnering arrangements for capacity building and performance monitoring between the PACT,\nDWLC,  international  NGOs,  and  overseas  institutions;  (iv)  biodiversity-related  research\ncontracts;  (v)  pilot  actions  to  expand  and  de-fragment  the  PA  system;  and  (vi)  pilot  actions  to\nestablish adaptive management as the norm to address specific threats. The Project addresses\nserious  threats  to  globally  important  ecosystems  and  biodiversity  resources.    Although\ncommitted  to  conserving  these  resources,  the  main  priority  of  the  Government  is  economic\ndevelopment  to  fund  a  fiscal  deficit  and  generate  additional  employment  opportunities.  In\naddition,  it  is  in  the  national  interest  to  attain  sustainable  levels  of  natural  resource  use  within\nPAs and benefit sharing with local populations to reduce the incidence of poverty. The GEF will\nsupport  activities  that  are  incremental  to  these  objectives.    In  particular,  it  will  contribute  to\nstrengthening DWLC to the point where protected ecosystems can be managed effectively and\nconsistently  with  global  biodiversity  objectives  in  mind,  thus  enabling  the  Government  to\nstrengthen its long-term capacity for biodiversity management.  Within the seven pilot PAs, GEF\nsupport will help ensure the consolidation and protection of ecosystems that include areas with\nthe  highest  possible  priority  from  a  global  biodiversity  perspective.    The  pilot  sites  will  also  be\nused,  with  GEF  support,  to  validate  and  field-test  new  management,  partnership  building,  and\nbenefit-sharing arrangements for replication throughout the PA system, including a strategically\nvital,  long-term  process  of  environmental  education,  community  strengthening,  and  conflict\nresolution that is required to address the root causes of biodiversity loss in Sri Lanka.\n\nOutside  the  pilot  sites,  GEF  support  will  help  ensure \n\nthat  global  biodiversity\n8.\nconsiderations are incorporated within a range of strategic activities, including innovative efforts\nto  expand  and  de-fragment  the  PA  system  in  the  highly  biodiverse  wet  zone,  to  prepare  and\nimplement plans for the recovery of endangered species and to undertake an inclusive process\nto prepare a Biodiversity Conservation Action Plan.  These will be the first processes, agreed to\nby  both  sides,  to  build  operational  partnerships  between  DWLC  and  the  Forest  Department.\nThus,  GEF  support  will  allow  full  participation  of  all  stakeholders  in  finding  the  best  ways  to\n\n\f41\n\nAppendix 3, page 3\n\nconserve  biodiversity  while  maximizing  sustainable  resource  use.    Finally,  GEF  will  support  a\nmonitoring  and  evaluation  system  that  operates  at  the  two  independent  levels  of  project\nspecificity  and  PA  specificity.    Most  global  benefits  of  the  Project  are  consequences  of  the\nnational and local benefits being achieved, but by themselves the latter do not necessarily justify\na  loan  for  a  project  of  the  scale,  priority  and  duration  that  is  needed.    This  dilemma  can  be\nresolved through partnership, in which the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) involvement will\nunlock global environmental benefits that would not otherwise be available to the GEF project\nportfolio  of  national  and  local  benefits,  and  vice  versa.    Despite  the  commitment  of  the\nGovernment  to  biodiversity  conservation,  it  is  unlikely  that  complementarity  of  national  and\nglobal concerns and investments can be mobilized against current threats without a direct GEF\ngrant.\n\nC. \n\nQuantification of GEF Contribution\n\n9.\nBusiness as Usual (BAU) Baseline.  The BAU baseline assumes continued investment\nat  approximately  current  levels  by  Government  and  aid  agencies  in  DWLC  and  ecosystem\nprotection.  It assumes continued institutional weakness and isolation by DWLC, so there is no\nreason  to  expect  that,  without  the  Project,  the  Fauna  and  Flora  Protection  Ordinance  of  1937\nwill  be  amended  or  replaced,  that  the  National  Wildlife  Policy  of  2000  will  be  implemented,  or\nthat  DWLC  will  decentralize  genuinely  or  begin  to  cooperate  with  other  government  agencies,\ncommunities,  NGOs,  or  with  private  enterprise.    Under  these  circumstances,  there  would  be\ncontinuing  erosion  of  ecosystem  resources  within  PAs,  and  continuing  erosion  of  support  for\nPAs  among  the  people  living  around  them.  DWLC  would  continue  in  a  demoralized,  reactive\nmode.  Meanwhile,  irreversible  damage  would  be  done  to  the  ecosystem  and  biodiversity\nresources.  Implementation of the BAU baseline over the six years of the Project is expected to\ncost approximately $46 million.\n\n10.\nSustainable Development (SD) Baseline.  The SD baseline adds to the BAU baseline\ncontinued  investment  by  Government  and  aid  agencies  in  environmental  education  and\ncommunity  development  around  protected  areas,  and  sustainable  development  initiatives  in\nsupport of this.  The level of such additional investment is assumed to include the relevant ADB\nloan  component  of  the  Project,  since  this  is  justified  by  the  national  interest  and  would  be\nexpected to attract Government financing.  Under the circumstances, there would be only weak\ncapture  of  global  benefits  owing  to  the  failure  to  interlink  local,  national,  and  global  concerns,\nand  priorities  and  interests,  with  a  consequent  loss  of  complementarity,  synergy,  and\ninternational relevance.  Implementation of the SD baseline over the six years of the Project is\nexpected to cost approximately $64 million\n\n11.\nGEF  Alternative.    The  GEF  alternative  scenario  adds  to  the  BAU  and  SD  baselines\nthose activities that are designed to achieve the Project\u2019s global biodiversity objectives, and that\nare expected to generate global benefits.  Implementation of the GEF alternative scenario over\nthe six years of the Project is expected to cost approximately $80 million.\n\n12.\nIncremental  Cost  of  GEF  Alternative.    The  estimated  cost  of  the  BAU  baseline  is\n$46.31  million,  that  of  the  SD  baseline  is  $64.19  million,  and  that  of  the  GEF  alternative  is\n$79.96 million, resulting in an incremental cost of $15.77 million (Table A3).  The GEF is asked\nto fund $10.2 million of the project cost.\n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 3, page 4\n\nTable A3:  Incremental Cost Matrix\n\nArea Relevant to the\nProject\n\nCost\nCategory\n\nCost ($\nmillion)\n\nDomestic\nBenefit\n\nGlobal\nBenefit\n\nComponent 1: Enhancing Institutional Capacity for Protected Area Management\n\nA.

The analysis of PA threats follows with\na  description  of  root  causes,  and  the  project  response  to  them.  The  flow  chart  describes  the\nadaptive threat management process that will be applied by the Project.\n\nB. \n\nPilot Protected Areas\n\n2.\nPeak Wilderness Sanctuary (22,380 hectares [ha]).  Located in the Central Highlands,\nPeak Wilderness rises steeply from about 50 meters (m) in the southern lowlands, to 600 m from\nwhich  Adam\u2019s  Peak  rises  to  2,238  m.    It  is  one  of  the  most  valuable  conservation  areas  in  Sri\nLanka, with the high numbers of endemics, notably birds, reptiles, and amphibians.  Adam\u2019s Peak\nis  sacred  to  four  world  religions  and  attracts  about  2  million  pilgrims  each  year.  Management\npriorities  include  marking  the  remaining  boundary  and  defending  against  encroachment,  and\nestablishing infrastructure in response to the long shape and divided access of the PA.  Access\npaths  and  the  summit  of  Adam\u2019s  Peak  need  interpretation  materials  and  supervision  by  DWLC\nstaff.  Biodiversity inventories are needed to support education, monitoring, and bioprospecting.\n\n3.\nHorton Plains National Park (3,160 ha).  The park has two of Sri Lanka\u2019s three highest\npeaks, but is mostly a gently undulating plateau at about 2,100 m.  Most of the park is covered by\ndense cloud forest, with 50 percent endemism among woody plants, and including wild relatives\nof cultivated pepper, guava, tobacco, and cardamom.  Among the mammals are two monotypic\ngenera  of  endemic  shrews.    The  birds  include  numerous  montane  endemics  and  wintering\nmigrants.  The  park  is  a  popular  destination  for  visitors,  and  represents  a  major  opportunity  for\npublic  education.  Exotic  plant  species  including  gorse  and  black  wattle  are  colonizing  the  park.\nManagement priorities include managing visitors to reduce their impacts and increase the value\nof their presence to the park and themselves.  Equipping the park\u2019s visitor center is a high priority,\nand interpretation facilities will be provided along the paths to World\u2019s End and Baker\u2019s Fall, and\non new, signed nature trails.\n\n4.\nRitigala  Strict  Natural  Reserve  (1,528  ha).    Ritigala  is  an  isolated  mountain  that  rises\nfrom  the  north-central  lowlands  to  766  m.    Varied  growing  conditions  support  over  400  plant\nspecies, 20 percent of them endemic, 3 known only from this site, and at least another 8 being\nextinct elsewhere.  More than 100 plant species are used in Ayurvedic medicines, and there are\nelaborate  ruins  of  an  ancient  hospital  and  monastery  complex.    Mammals  include  endemic  and\nendangered  purple-faced  leaf  monkeys,  while  the  birds  include  three  endemic  species.    The\ncombination  of  ecosystem  diversity,  species  richness  and  endemism,  ethnobiological  and\narchaeological interests, and location within the Cultural Triangle all make Ritigala SNR a unique\nresource  for  education  and  ecotourism,  with  good  potential  for  developing  village-based\necotourism.  Logging and poaching are common, and there are areas of encroachment.  Human-\nelephant  conflict  is  increasing  near  the  boundaries,  and  the  large  numbers  of  visitors  create\nlittering  and  other  problems  as  well  as  opportunities  for  more  productive  management.\nManagement priorities include providing better services for visitors, and facilities and equipment\nfor DWLC staff.\n\nBundala National Park (6,216 ha).  The park is Sri Lanka\u2019s only site designated Wetland\n5.\nof International Importance under the Ramsar Convention.  It contains key nesting sites for five\nspecies  of  marine  turtle.    Arid  and  semiarid  terrestrial  habitats  shelter  a  wide  range  of  species,\nincluding  elephants,  many  other  native  mammals,  star  tortoise,  and  an  endemic  flying  snake.\nThe marshes and channels host populations of an endemic toad, and both mugger and estuarine\n\n\f45\n\nAppendix 4, page 2\n\ncrocodiles.    Given  its  concentration  of  waterbirds  and  turtle  nesting  activities,  there  is\nconsiderable scope for ecotourism at the park.  Waterbirds depend on the biological productivity\nof the lagoons, but that, however, is being undermined by the intrusion of freshwater. The park is\nalso  being  invaded  by  exotic  species,  and  is  subject  to  grazing  by  6,000  cattle  and  buffalo.\nManagement priorities include solving the underlying ecological problem of freshwater intrusion,\nturtle  nesting  beaches.\neradicating \nEcotourism interventions include improving visitor infrastructure and further development of local\nnongovernment organization and villager interest in turtle conservation.\n\ninvasive  weeds,  excluding \n\nlivestock,  and  protecting \n\nWasgamuwa  National  Park  (39,385  ha).    The  park  lies  in  the  central  lowlands,  and\n6.\ncontains one of the largest remaining native forests in Sri Lanka, with 150 known tree species, at\nleast  10  of  them  endemic  and  3  of  these  being  economically  important.    The  known  fauna\ncomprises  23  species  of  large  mammals,  163  birds  (8  endemic),  35  reptiles  (7  endemic),  15\namphibians,  17  freshwater  fishes,  and  52  butterflies  (9  endemic).    The  park  probably  contains\nmore wildlife, in terms of species richness, than any part of the Mahaweli region, and offers major\nopportunities for tourism use.  Gem fields left numerous deep pits.  An estimated 60,000 domestic\ncattle and 7,500 buffalo graze in the park. Encroachment of the southern boundary is heavy, and\nabout  2,400  ha  of  natural  habitat  has  been  lost  as  a  result.    Invading  woody  species  have\nbecome widespread.  Local incomes are supplemented by fishing, livestock, and sale of firewood,\nand all parts of the park are under pressure from about 30 villages that settled near the park in\n1980 .  Gemstone mining and encroachment create enforcement issues. Other priorities include\neliminating livestock grazing, eradicating invasive plants, and resolving human-elephant conflicts.\n\n7.\nMinneriya  National  Park  (8,889  ha).    The  park  lies  in  the  dry  northern  plain,  and\ncomprises low forested hills that feed the third-century Minnerya reservoir and the modern Giritale\nreservoir.  The core of the park is one of the most biodiverse parts of the country outside the wet\nzone.  It  contains  a  unique  concentration  of  intact  ecosystem  types  that  support  populations  of\nmost  dry-zone  mammals,  including  elephants  and  leopards,  while  the  lakes  support  a  wide\nvariety  of  waterfowl  and  at  least  31  species  of  native  fish.    There  is  considerable  potential  for\ntourism as the park is located along a high visitor flow route in the cultural triangle. The park has\nan elephant population and scenic landscape around the reservoirs. It is grazed by an estimated\n4,000 cattle and buffalo (owned by 15-20 families). Some firewood collection and poaching take\nplace in the park, and human-elephant conflicts occur around at least five villages.  Management\npriorities  include  a  process  to  eliminate  livestock  grazing  that  takes  the  park\u2019s  history  of  legal\ngrazing into account, and development of tourism facilities.\n\n8.\nUda Walawe National Park (30,821 ha).  Located in the southern lowlands, much of the\noriginal  semideciduous  monsoon  forest  was  cleared  by  shifting  cultivation.  Diverse  old  growth\nforest  is  restricted  to  the  northern  part  of  the  park,  within  which  riverine  stands  contain  the\nendemic,  endangered  tree  Hopea cordifolia.    Among  a  rich  mammal  fauna  are  the  endemic\ngolden palm civet, herds of resident and migratory elephants, and a full suite of low-country birds.\nSome  30,000  cattle  graze  in  the  park,  thus  complicating  the  resolution  of  the  human-elephant\nconflict and impacting the park\u2019s ecosystems and tourism potential.  Exotic plants have invaded\nmany areas, and fishing and poaching are widespread.  A priority is to fence an elephant corridor\nto allow secure migration between Uda Walawe and Lunugamvehera National Park.  The Project\nwill  also  support  the  development  of  ecotourism  facilities  at  the  existing  elephant  rehabilitation\nand reintroduction facility at Uda Walawe.\n\n\fC. \n\nIndicative Threat Analysis and Project Response Matrix\n\n46\n\nAppendix 4, page 3\n\nArea Characteristics\n\nThreats/Constraints\n\nRoot Causes\n\nProject Response\n\nNational (6,561,000 ha, rainfall 600-4,000 mm)\n\nGlobal value: extreme (ca 50% endemicity)\n\n(1) Relatively small island with high\nlandscape \ndistinctive\ndiversity, \nagro-ecological  zones:  wet,  inter-\nmediate,  dry,  arid. \n  (2)  Global\nbiodiversity hot spot: Provides criti-\ncal  habitat  for  migratory  species,\nmost  biologically  rich  country  in\nAsia per unit area.

The objectives were to (i) identify the socioeconomic characteristics of the villages near\nthe  PAs;  (ii)  understand  the  nature  of  the  relationship  between  the  villages  and  the  PAs;  (iii)\nidentify the vulnerable groups within the villages who are either dependent or have an impact on\nthe PAs; (iv) identify the development priorities of the villagers in relation to wildlife management\nwithin  and  outside  the  PAs;  and  (v)  identify  stakes  and  perceptions  of  key  stakeholders\nregarding  PA  management  (e.g.,  Department  of  Wildlife  Conservation  (DWLC)  officers,\nadministrative  officers  at  Divisional  Secretariat,  Pradeshiya  Sabha  or  a  political  body  at\ndivisional level, and nongovernment organizations [NGOs]) including perceptions of the conflicts\nof  interest  between  the  villagers  and  the  PA  managers  (DWLC).  A  series  of  consultative\nworkshops were held with DWLC staff  at headquarters and the regional offices.\n\nB. \n\nSocioeconomic Profiles of the Communities Near the Project PAs\n\n1. \n\nDemographic Profiles\n\n2.\nThe communities surrounding (i.e., within 5 kilometers of PA boundaries) the seven pilot\nPAs  under  the  Project  include  192  villages  (Grama  Nilahari  Divisions)  in  17  divisions,  eight\ndistricts covering five provinces, inhabited by about 40,000 households or 180,000 people. This\ncovers  more  than  10  percent  of  a  1.5  million  population  living  near  the  PAs  nationwide.    For\neach  PA,  more  than  one  division,  district  and  sometimes  province  are  involved;  hence  close\ncoordination is required across different administrative boundaries.\n\nin \n\nThe  average  households \n\n3.\nthe  villages  have  4.0-4.6  members.  Sociocultural\ncharacteristics  vary  across  villages.    District-level  data  shows  that  ethnic  and  religious\ncompositions  are  diverse.  The  eight  project  PA  districts  comprise  six  Buddhists  majority\ndistricts,  one  Hindu  majority  district,  and  one  Muslim  majority  district.  The  male/female\ncomposition of the population is near equal.  The female-headed households are few, except for\nthe Muslim village (Palupitiya) in Wasgamuwa where 15 percent of households are headed by\nwomen  mainly  because  of  polygamous  relationships.    The  educational  levels  of  males  and\nfemales are generally equal, with relatively high enrollment rates. Child labor does not appear to\nbe a crucial issue in the areas.\n\n2. \n\nPoverty and Livelihood\n\n4.\nSocioeconomic  characteristics  vary  significantly  between  villages.    However,  the\nincidence  of  poverty  in  villages  near  PAs  is  higher  than  the  national  average.    The  1996/97\nConsumer Finance Survey shows poverty incidence as 19 percent at the national level and 20\npercent rural, 18 percent estate and 11 percent urban. Most villages near PAs are rural, with a\nfew in the estate sector. From the number of recipients of the Government\u2019s poverty alleviation\nassistance in the form of Samurdhi, often used as a de facto poverty line, poverty incidence is\n                                                          \n1 \n\nThe nine villages are Mapalana (Peak Wilderness), Seethagangula (Peak Wilderness), Pattipola (Horton Plains),\nMinihrigama  (Minneriya),  Palupitiya  (Wasgamuwa),  Hinukkiriyawa  (Ritigala),  Panahaduwa  (Uda  Walawe),  and\nPallemalala (Bundala)  included in the seven pilot PA sites and Gallella (Flood Plains) outside the pilot sites.\n\n\f50\n\nAppendix 5, page 2\n\nmuch  higher:  22-32  percent  in  eastern  Uda  Walawe,  48-100  percent  in  western  Uda  Walawe,\n75 percent in Wasgamuwa, 65 percent in Ritigala, 58-90 percent in southern Peak Wilderness,\n70 percent in Bundala, and 36-52 percent in  Minneriya.\n\nThe  PRA  exercises  showed,  however,  that  community  perceptions  of  poor/very  poor\n5.\nhouseholds differ from those of official Samurdhi recipients, which are purely based on income\nlevels. Communities assessed poverty on a wider set of criteria including ownership of assets,\nlivelihoods, and family dynamics and report figures that differ significantly from Samurdhi-based\ndata.  The respective figures for community assessment and Samurdhi are 51 and 44 percent in\nMapalana (Peak Wilderness), 94 and 58 percent in Seethagangula (Peak Wilderness), 25 and\n87 percent in Pattipola (Horton Plains), 26 and 50 percent in Minihirigama (Minneriya), 97and 75\npercent in Palupitiya (Wasgamuwa), 65 and 10 percent in Hinukkiriyawa (Ritigala), and 55 and\n13 percent in Pallemalala (Bundala).2 These discrepancies indicate a major targeting implication\nfor the village-level microplanning during project implementation.\n\n6.\nResource endowments and livelihood sources are site specific. Most villagers living near\nthe PAs engage in subsistence rain-fed agriculture often involving shifting cultivation (chena) in\nthe dry zone. Other income sources are inland fishing (Bundala, Uda Walawe, Minneriya), cattle\ngrazing  (Uda  Walawe,  Bundala,  Wasgamuwa,  Minneriya),  and  smallholder  tea  near  Peak\nWilderness.    Cash  incomes  from  horticultural  crops  are  mostly  limited  to  farmers  around\nWasgamuwa,  while  elsewhere,  crops  are  generally  grown  for  subsistence  purposes  only.  At\nsome sites, distilling and selling of illicit liquor is the most lucrative source of income on which\n43 percent of villagers in Hinukkiriyawa (Ritigala) depend.\n\nThe  land  tenure  situation  is  complex.    There  are  three  types  of  land  according  to\n7.\nownership: temple land, private land (Nindagam) inherited by descendents of the old rulers, and\nGovernment  land.    Most  of  the  population  around  the  PAs  fall  under  the  categories  of  those\nunder private lease, permit holders allowed to use Government land, sharecroppers, and those\nwithout permits. Many do not possess any legal title or claim to land they use - which had been\nencroached upon - and as such are not eligible for formal bank lending for lack of collateral. The\nnumber  of  illegal  encroachers  on  Government  land,  without  titles,  varied  between  18  percent\n(Hiinukkiriyawa-Ritigala) and 78 percent (Minihirigama-Minneriya).  Small landholdings and land\nfragmentation were identified as contributing to encroachment by paddy farmers whose average\npaddy size is about 0.2 ha compared with the national average of 0.5 ha.\n\n8.\nCauses  of  poverty  identified  by  the  communities  through  the  PRAs  include  (i)\nlandlessness, lack of legal land titles, and poor-quality marginal lands leading to encroachment;\n(ii) fragmentation of land, reducing the viability of production; (iii) inadequate irrigation facilities;\n(iv)  dependence  on  seasonal  agricultural  production  and  labor,  resulting  in  insecure  incomes;\n(v)  dependence  of  low-income  fishers  working  inside  PA  boundaries  on  licensed  boat  owners\nfor their livelihood; (vi) declining availability of forest products for collection; (vii) human-elephant\nconflict  leading  to  loss  of  life  and  damage  to  crops  and  properties;  (viii)  lack  of  employment\nopportunities,  especially  among  the  educated  youth,  hence  dependence  on  casual  and\nseasonal labor,  out-migration, or the armed forces; (ix) dependence on moneylenders for credit\nneeds  at  high  interest  rates  and  being  trapped  by  continued  indebtedness;  (x)  poor  access  to\nmarket for agricultural produce and exploitation by middlemen; (xi) abuse of illicit liquor (PAs are\nused for hiding it) and consequent domestic violence and expenditure drain on family income;\n\n                                                          \n2\n  A full-scale PRA was not conducted in Panahaduwa (Uda Walawe).\n\n\f51\n\nAppendix 5, page 3\n\n(xii)  poor  access  to  drinking  water;  and  (xiii)  limited  access  to  social  and  communication\ninfrastructure.\n\n9.\nPoverty and deprivation are exacerbated by dependence on those who have access to\nassets, such as landowners, moneylenders, middlemen, traders, boat and fishing gear owners,\nand  owners  of  large  herds  of  cattle.    Such  asset  owners  come  not  only  from  the  better-off\ngroups  in  local  communities  but  also  from  cities  such  as  Hambantota  (Uda  Walawe),\nPolonnaruwa,  Kandy  (Flood  Plains),  Anuradhapura  (Ritigala),  and  even  Colombo.    Lack  of\nemployment  opportunities  leads  the  poor  into  casual  labor  offered  by  these  asset  owners  and\noutsiders. The poor of the community members are, therefore, vulnerable to being co-opted in\nsupport  of  livestock  grazing,  logging,  poaching  and  gemstone  mining  within  the  PAs,  often\nacting for low wages on behalf of organized gangs and business people from elsewhere.\n\n3. \n\nCommunity Dependence on PAs\n\n10.\nAbout  90  percent  of  the  communities  near  the  PAs  depend  to  varying  degrees  on  the\nPAs\u2019  natural  resources  and  spaces.    The  activities  engaged  in  include  (i)  poaching;  (ii)  timber\nfelling; (iii) fuelwood collection; (iv) fishing; (v) brewing of illicit liquor and using the PAs as hiding\nplaces; (vi) cattle grazing; (vii) collection of nontimber products (honey, medicinal herbs, fruits,\nand  berries);  and  (viii)  land  encroachments.    They  are  common  to  all  pilot  PAs,  although  the\ndegree of occurrence may vary.\n\n11.\nDespite extensive use of PA resources and the acute resource depletion in many buffer\nzones,  the  earlier  surveys  under  the  social  assessment  found  that  the  majority  of  households\nnear the PAs have diversified sources of income and do not entirely depend on the PAs for their\nmain source of livelihood.  This can be attributed to, first, overexploitation in some PAs, leading\nto  declining  dependence  on  PAs.  Second,  middle-  and  upper-income  households  with  more\nassets control the use of resources.  This points to the importance of raising awareness among\nthe community members, especially the poor, on the necessity for resisting the pressure to be\nco-opted for illegal exploitation of  PA resources.  The empowerment of the poor to gain access\nto resources and manage these is a critical step in overcoming some of the strategic threats.\n\n4. \n\nGender\n\n12.\nThe social assessment found no significant gender gaps in social indicators nor gender\ndiscrimination.  Within Muslim communities, the situation was less equal, with the women\u2019s orbit\nrestricted  to  household  activities  and  home-based  industries.    A  clear  gender  division  of  labor\nwas  observed  elsewhere.  Fuelwood,  water  collection,  and  extraction  of  nontimber  products\n(berries,  fruits,  yams)  are  usually  associated  with  females  while  in  the  Muslim  community\n(Gallella-Flood Plains, though outside the scope of the Project), those are man\u2019s jobs.  Fishing\nis  considered  a  male  occupation.    Agriculture  activities  are  shared.  Activities  requiring  heavy\nphysical  labor  are  reserved  for  men,  while  women  and  children  engage  in  activities  such  as\nweeding,  transplanting,  harvesting,  and  winnowing  and  dehusking  of  grain,  which  require\ncontinuous application.\n\n13. Women  at  large  bear  the  burden  of  poverty  due  to  their  multiple  roles  as  economic\nproducers  and  family  caretakers.  Many  of  them  seek  casual  employment  or  emigrate  to  other\ncountries  or  districts  for  employment.    Depletion  of  natural  resources,  especially  fuelwood,\nsignificantly affects their workload.  In several villages, women observed that the amount of time\nneeded to collect one bundle of fuelwood has doubled over the last 10 years. Female-headed\nhouseholds are among the most disadvantaged groups, as they are sole income earners with\n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 5, page 4\n\nvery poor access to resources and information.  Further, liquor addiction, mainly of men, leads\nto family conflict and, in some cases, domestic violence where women suffer.  While women\u2019s\nrepresentation  in  the  Samurdhi  program  implementation  and  the  group  savings  schemes  is\nhigh, their participation in community decision-making bodies is still limited.  Under the Project,\nNGOs/community  based  organizations  (CBOs)  will  receive  training  to  make  sure  that  gender\nissues are addressed through the process of village microplanning.\n\nC. \n\nNeeds, Perceptions, and Capacity of Stakeholders\n\n1. \n\nCommunity Perceptions of PAs and the PA Management\n\n14.\nThrough  the  PRAs,  the  communities\u2019  knowledge  of  resource  use  and  availability,\nperceptions  of  problems  regarding  PAs  and  PA  management,  and  potential  solutions  to  them\nwere  elicited.  The  social  mapping  and  wealth  ranking  exercises  identified  the  spatial\nrelationships between the communities and the nearby PAs (e.g., how elephants enter the field,\nwhere  cattle  grazing  inside  the  PA  occurs)  and  the  geographical  location  of  the  poor\nhouseholds.    A  Venn  diagram  was  prepared  to  identify  the  local  stakeholders  and  their\nimportance  to  village  life.    Through  the  preparation  of  problem  trees,  the  communities  also\nidentified the causes and effects of resource depletion and the potential solutions to them. After\nthe PRAs, many villagers, especially the youth, became aware of the importance of organizing\nthemselves to take strong actions against the temptation to engage in illegal wildlife exploitation\nin the PAs.\n\n15.\nCommunities near the PAs are aware of the negative ecological impact of deforestation,\nencroachment  on  PA  land,  shifting  cultivation,  uncontrolled  grazing,  and  erosion  caused  by\ncultivation along slopes.  They are also aware of the importance of PAs, conservation of wildlife\nand its sustainable use.  Further, they agreed that resource depletion is to a large extent driven\nby poverty (para. 8).  In addition to poverty and lack of alternative livelihood, the following were\nhighlighted as major issues leading to wildlife-related conflicts and problems: (i) lack of clear PA\nboundaries;  (ii)  inadequate  law  enforcement  in  PA  management  and  poorly  equipped  and\nmanned beat stations; (iii) political influence on law enforcement activities, creating a sense of\nsocial injustice; (iv) inadequate compensation schemes for crop damages caused by elephants;\nand  (v)  lack  of  communication  between  the  communities  and  PA  managers.    At  some  sites,\ntense  relations  are  observed  between  the  communities  and  PA  managers  as  a  result  of  a\nhistory of conflict, including the past wrong handling of villagers by the PA managers which has\nled to loss of human lives.\n\n16.\nThe  suggested  solutions  include  (i)  development  of  alternative  livelihood  sources  (e.g.,\necotourism) for the economically marginalized groups and for the educated youth who see no\nfuture  in  traditional  livelihood  patterns;  (ii)  clear  delineation  of  PA  boundaries,  based  on  the\nagreement  between  the  villagers  and  the  PA  administrators;  (iii)  electrified  fence  to  prevent\nelephant  encroachments;  (iv)  creation  of  buffer  zones  or  zoning  of  the  PAs  to  allow  space  for\nhuman-wildlife  interaction  and  minimize  the  negative  impact  of  human-wildlife  conflicts;  (v)\nstronger and fairer enforcement of park rules, particularly against resource extractors from the\nbetter-off  inside  and  outside  the  communities;  (vi)  more  community  participation  in  PA\nmanagement; and (vii) raising public awareness on wildlife conservation.\n\n2. \n\nPerceptions of Field Staff and Local Administrative Officers\n\n17.\nDWLC  field  staff  (including  the  park  officers  and  beat  officers)  generally  shared  the\ncommunities\u2019  perceptions  of  the  problems  and  solutions.    They  also  identified  inadequate\n\n\f53\n\nAppendix 5, page 5\n\ninfrastructure  and  equipment  and  lack  of  personnel  as  major  constraints  to  functioning\neffectively.  Some showed frustration with not being able to take action against illegal poachers\nand loggers from outside the communities due to political and other pressures.  There were also\nsome cases of self-reflection on the policing approach of the DWLC that ignores the needs of\nthe  people.  Some  also  expressed  fear  of  dealing  with  local  communities  that  show  hostility\nagainst PA managers.\n\n18.\nThe  perceptions  of  the  local  administrative  officers  including  those  from  Divisional\nSecretariat,  Grama  Niladharis,  and  Pradeshiya  Sabha  were  in  general  patronizing  and\nhighlighted a lack of awareness and knowledge of the communities near PAs and the traditional\nlivelihood problems.  The interesting similarity, however, was the helplessness and incapacity to\ndeal with illegal wildlife exploitation by organized groups and politicians.  Difficulties and hence\nneeds  in  coordination  among  relevant  departments/authorities  in  conservation  and  law\nenforcement were also identified.\n\n3. \n\nAbsorptive Capacity of Stakeholders\n\n19.\nEvidence  from  the  Project\u2019s  PRAs  clearly  shows  that  communities  are  fully  capable  of\ncommitting  themselves  to  sustainable  wildlife  management  both  within  and  outside  the  PAs  if\nthey  are  empowered  and  have  strong  leadership.  But  with  the  low  community  acceptance  of\nGovernment officers and the limited capacity of the local administrative officers and the wildlife\nofficers,  it  is  crucial  to  engage  capable  NGOs/CBOs  in  facilitating  (i)  social  assessment  and\ncommunity  mobilization;  (ii)  village-level  microplanning;  and  (iii)  coordination  between  the\ncommunities, the field unit of DWLC, and local public administrations.\n\n20.\nVillage-level institutional assessment documented an inventory of existing NGOs/CBOs\nand  their  capacity.    The  types  of  CBOs  are  location  specific,  but  the  Funeral  Aid  Society\nappears to be the best functioning one in all villages. In general, CBOs have limited functions\nand  are  not  usually  capable  of  comprehensive  planning  or  stakeholder  coordination.    A  small\nnumber of domestic NGOs with strength in community mobilization for specific activities operate\nin  the  communities  near  the  project  PAs,  but  they  have  limited  capacity  in  facilitating\ncomprehensive  planning  and  coordination.  There  is  potential,  however,  that  locally  based\nNGOs/CBOs could be strengthened by capable and reputable international NGOs or institutes\nwith experience in PRAs, community planning, and stakeholder coordination.\n\n21.\nIn the longer term, the field unit staff from DWLC should also have better communication\nand management skills in working directly with the communities and understanding their needs\nthrough training provided by the international/domestic NGOs/institutes, so that such skills are\nsustained at the local level of DWLC.\n\nD. \n\nProject Strategy and Mechanism for Beneficiary Participation\n\n1. \n\nProject Strategy\n\n22.\nsocial strategy:\n\nThe  findings  of  the  social  assessment  have  been  translated  into  the  following  project\n\n(i) \n\nfacilitate community access to technical know-how, new knowledge, skills training, credit\nfacilities,  and  alternative  means  of  livelihood  that  will  build  its  absorptive  capacity  to\nparticipate effectively in PA management;\n\n\f(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n54\n\nAppendix 5, page 6\n\nimprove community-PA managers (i.e., DWLC staff) relationships, which would result in\ncommitment to a common objective of PA management and wildlife conservation;\n\nfacilitate,  through  the  services  of  capable  NGOs/CBOs,  the  creation  of  an  enabling\nenvironment  for  the  community  members,  both  men  and  women,  to  engage  in\ninformation  generation,  problem  analysis,  and  microplanning  for  which  the  community\ntakes ownership in implementing, monitoring, and evaluation;\n\nallow  the  community  and  PA  managers  to  jointly  develop  sustainable  livelihood  and\nwildlife management using an adaptive learning process on a case-by-case basis;\n\nsustain the capacity of the community to access productive resources and contribute to\nPA management and wildlife conservation beyond the project time frame.\n\n23.\nThe above social strategy has been incorporated into the design of component D of the\nProject,  in  which  community  participation  is  promoted  under  the  sustainable  financing\nmechanism  of  the  Protected  Area  Conservation  Trust  (PACT)  (Appendix  6).    The  following\nprocess for community empowerment will take place:\n\nsocial mobilization within a forum that represents the target community;\n\nproblem  analysis  where  community  members,  through  a  range  of  participatory\ntechniques, identify and prioritize the problems and opportunities that members of each\ncommunity face;\n\ncommunity-based resource assessments that identify and describe the demand for and\nsupply  of  resources,  the  holders  of  ownership  or  use  rights,  season  of  use,  and  the\ncommunity  users  of  these  resources;    the    assessment  will  also  evaluate  necessary\nchanges;\n\nformulating  community  microplans,  where  all  community  members  agree  on  the\ndevelopment  objectives  and  construct  strategies  with  technical  inputs  from  a  range  of\ngovernment sectors including irrigation, agricultural services, livestock, forestry, wildlife,\neducation, tourism, and health;\n\ndeveloping  community  (or  subcommunity)  resource  agreements  with  the  DWLC  based\non the community microplans, including the delineation of PA boundaries;\n\nimplementing microplans using local resources, local government resources, NGO input,\nGovernment  programs,  seed  grants  from  the  PACT,  community  outreach  grants,  and\ntechnical assistance from component B of the Project, as necessary;\n\n(vii) \n\ndeveloping  areawide  planning  processes  in  which  plans  from  contiguous  communities\nare integrated;\n\n(viii) \n\nestablishing a joint decision-making mechanism for involving community representatives\nfrom  the  areawide  planning  process  that  would  include  local  DWLC  staff  and  other\nrelevant agencies; and\n\n(ix)  monitoring  and  evaluating  the  implementation  and  impact  of  microplans  by  the\ncommunities,  local  DWLC  staff,  and  relevant  local  authorities,  using  key  performance\n\n\f55\n\nAppendix 5, page 7\n\nindicators  (KPIs)  on  which  the  performance  of  the  contracted  NGOs/CBOs  will  be\nassessed.  The KPIs are (a) the level of poverty impact and the participation of the poor,\n(b) increased community knowledge of environmental issues, and (c) the level of conflict\nresolution achieved.\n\n2. \n\nRisks and Safeguards\n\n24.\nMajor  social  risks  include  the  following.    First,  political  interference  in  the  movement\nagainst  illegal  wildlife  exploitation  and  the  PACT  is  expected.    Minimizing  this  risk  is  difficult;\nhowever, community empowerment and DWLC field staff capacity building will foster vigilance\nagainst such interference, while the PACT will have transparent and accountable structures and\nprocedures  that  sit  outside  of  Government.    Second,  there  is    concern  about  the  overall\nNGO/CBO  capacity  on  which  the  long-term  success  of  community  empowerment  depends.\nExtensive training will be conducted by far more capable NGOs under the Project to minimize\nthe  risks.    To  ensure  that  women\u2019s  needs  (e.g.,  measures  against  domestic  violence,  better\naccess  to  drinking  water)  and  participation  are  incorporated  into  the  microplanning,  gender\ntraining will be included as part of capacity building.\n\n25.\nThe  overall  principle  of  the  Project  is  to  avoid  relocation  of  households.  Therefore,  it\ndoes  not  envisage  significant  resettlement  or  land  acquisition.    The  Project  will  make  every\neffort to avoid social relocation through boundary alignment and, if necessary, zoning inside the\nPA  to  allow  inhabitation.    Decisions  on  the  boundaries  will  be  made  in  a  fully  participatory\nmanner  involving  all  key  stakeholders.  If  relocation  is  unavoidable,  a  resettlement  plan  will  be\nprepared for each PA after a detailed census, social assessment, and PRA, according to ADB\u2019s\nHandbook on Resettlement  and  will  be  agreed  upon  by  ADB  and  the  Government  before\nboundaries are set and any other actions are taken.\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 6, page 1\n\nPROTECTED AREA CONSERVATION TRUST\n\nA. \n\nIntroduction\n\nConservation  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  protected  areas  (PAs)  will  only  succeed  if  support  of  the\n1.\ncommunities in the vicinity of the PAs can be mobilized for maintaining the integrity of the PA\nboundaries and the resources the PAs contain. Without such support, the outcome of protection\nefforts  and  management  inputs  into  PAs  are  more  than  offset  by  the  continued  impact  of\nexpanding  human  activity.  Several  approaches  have  been  initiated,  starting  from  public\nawareness and extension activities to direct income support. Most of these attempts have had\nonly  mixed  success  and  limited  impact.  From  international  experience  and  as  a  result  of  the\nconsultation,1  the  consensus  was  that  there  is  need  for  a  process  that  allows  buffer  zone\ncommunities to become an integral part of PA conservation through a program of empowerment\nthat leads toward a set of agreed-upon goals, rights, and responsibilities in relation to PAs. The\nconsultations  confirmed  that  this  process  would  require  a  wider  landscape  planning  and\nmanagement  approach  supported  by  investments  and  benefit-sharing  arrangements  that\ndirectly address the root causes and threats to the PA system. It was universally felt that such\nempowerment requires a financing vehicle and support mechanism that can sustain it over the\nlong term. The proposed Protected Area Conservation Trust (PACT) is designed to be such a\nvehicle.  The  PACT\u2019s  design,  size,  and  operating  mechanisms  are  based  on  an  extensive\nconsultation  process,  and  are  consistent  with  best  practices  and  experiences  learned\ninternationally  with  conservation  trust  funds.  Detailed  financial  analysis,  based  on  a  needs\nassessment,  indicates  that  the  PACT  is  ex  ante  financially  sustainable.  Furthermore,  (i)  the\nGovernment  has  expressed  its  support  for  a  public-private  sector  mechanism  outside  direct\ngovernment control to support a buffer zone community empowerment process; (ii) the country\u2019s\nbasic  fabric  of  legal  and  financial  practices  including  supporting  institutions  such  as  banking,\nauditing, and contracting are sufficiently developed to provide the services needed for the PACT\nto  operate  effectively;  and  (iii)  there  is  a  critical  mass  of  stakeholders  from  diverse  sectors  of\nsociety that can work in partnership to conserve biodiversity sustainably.\n\nB. \n\nDeed\n\nThe deed of the PACT will be prepared under a Sri Lankan ordinance for establishing a\n2.\ncharitable trust. The liability of the trustees will be limited. It is axiomatic that the trust does not\npay tax on its income or on any of its investments.  The deed will describe the principles under\nwhich  the  trust  will  operate  and  its  bylaws.  The  trustees  will  ensure  that  they  seek  the  best\npossible return on their endowment and any gifts through a professional asset manager.\n\nC. \n\nObjectives\n\n3.\n\nThe objectives of the PACT are as follows:\n\n(i) \n\nFacilitate  professional  management  of  a  capital  endowment \nfinance\ncommunity  and  participatory  benefits  from  conservation  and  protected  areas  in\nSri Lanka.  The settlor will assign the capital endowment or investment structure,\nand  the  trust  will  adopt  an  appropriate  investment  portfolio  consonant  with  the\nobjectives  of  the  trust.    An  experienced  trust  manager  of  excellent  track  record\n\nto \n\n                                                \n1 \n\nAn  extensive  stakeholder  consultation  process  that  lasted  over  2.5  years  involved  over  30  workshops  at  the\nlocal,  provincial,  and  national  levels.  The  consultation  was  complemented  by  detailed  social  assessments  in\neach of the pilot PAs using rapid rural appraisal techniques.\n\n\f57\n\nAppendix 6, page 2\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nwill professionally manage the trust portfolio. The trust manager will be appointed\nby board of trustees in consultation with the Asian Development Bank (ADB).\n\nFinance  any  appropriate  entity  that  will  best  meet  the  objectives  of  the  trust  to\nundertake  any  of  the  following:  (a)  social  mobilization,  (b)  community  resource\nassessments, (c) community natural resource management, (d) community/micro\nlevel  planning,  (e)  areawide  planning \nframeworks,  (f)  community-based\nconservation agreements, and (g) capital investments to deliver the objectives of\nthe trust.\n\nto  conservation  benefits \n\nProvide investment capital for implementation of community initiatives with direct\nlinks \n(e.g.  community  woodlots  establishment,\ncommunity  fodder  production,  etc.),  the  capital  to  be  provided  as  grants  to\ncommunities  (or  their  stated  contractor),  with  in-kind  contributions  from  the\nbeneficiaries.\n\nthe  capacity  of  community  groups  and  associations.  Once\nStrengthen \nstrengthened, these groups will be able to prove their implementation capability\nand thereby compete successfully for proceeds of the PACT.\n\nManage annual trust revenues according to the following: (a) adopting a growth\nstrategy  for  the  endowment  through  reinvestment  of  25  percent  of  the  annual\nrevenue;  (b)  using  a  maximum  of  20  percent  of  annual  revenues \nfor\nadministrative  costs;  (c)  applying  the  remaining  funds  to  the  objectives  of  the\ntrust, using a competitive grant-making process on an annual basis.\n\nD. \n\nEndowment and Trust Management\n\n4.       A  total  initial  endowment  of  $8  million  is  targeted.    This  would  provide  approximately\n$0.5\u20130.6  million  per  annum  to  invest  in  local  community  initiatives.    It  is  expected  that  the\nendowment will be funded with a GEF grant of $4 million and another $4 million from bilateral\ngrant  sources.    The  endowment  will  not  receive  any  Government  funds  and  will  be  operated\nindependently from the Government. Trust programs will be developed to raise funds from other\nbilateral sources and the corporate sector.  This will be the responsibility of the chief executive\nand  the  trustees.  The  endowment  will  be  entrusted  to  a  commercial  trust  manager  for\ninvestment  with  a  conservative  risk  profile  determined  by  the  board  of  trustees,  and  which  is\nenvironmentally benign. The endowment fund will be invested offshore to capture the benefits of\nglobal markets and to protect against any possible devaluation of the domestic currency.\n\nE. \n\nTrustees\n\n5.\nThe trustees will be limited to nine: six eminent people acceptable to ADB and three ex\nofficio  representatives,  one  each  from  the  Department  of  Wildlife  Conservation,  Forest\nDepartment,  and  Coast  Conservation  Department.  A  search  committee  comprising  a  wide\nrepresentation  of  stakeholders  will  identify  the  trustees  in  a  transparent  and  participatory\nprocess.  No decision of the board of trustees can be executed unless the board meeting has a\nquorum  of  six.    Every  three  years,  one  trustee  will  step  down  and  a  new  trustee  will  be\nappointed.  The board of trustees, excluding ex officio trustees, will decide the appointment of\nall new trustees.  A trustee is limited to serve no more than nine years.  The board chairman will\nbe elected by the board of trustees.  The chairmanship will be open for election every year and\nthe sitting chairperson can be reelected.\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 6, page 3\n\nF. \n\nExecutive and Operational Procedures\n\n6.        The  trust  will  establish  an  appropriately  staffed  secretariat  under  the  trustees  for\nmanagement including the appointment of a chief executive officer. Trust establishment and the\noperational  expenses  of  the  PACT  for  the  first  two  years  will  be  borne  by  the  Project.  The\nsecretariat,  under  the  guidance  of  the  board  and  with  assistance  provided  by  an  international\nnongovernment  organization  with  experience  in  conservation  trust  funds  as  well  as  domestic\nand  international  consulting  services,  will  be  charged  with  the  preparation  of  a  detailed\noperations/procedures manual, and monitoring mechanisms in addition to the principles set out\nin  the  trust\u2019s  bylaws  and  deed.  The  funding  priority  of  the  trust  is  to  support  projects  that\nreinforce  the  linkage  between  PA  management  and  biodiversity  conservation  and  the  project\nconcerned.  The project pilot PAs will receive priority during the project implementation phase.\nThe application procedures will be published on an annual basis in the form of guidelines as a\npublic document, and the trustees will determine these.  Project eligibility will be founded on the\nprinciple  that  the  direct  or  indirect  effect  or  objectives  will  enhance  the  connection  between\nbiodiversity conservation and community benefit. Project eligibility is dependent on sustainability\nat  the  end  of  the  project  period.  The  trustees  will  be  expected  to  apply  at  least  50  percent  of\nannual  revenues  to  sustainable  projects  for  the  support  of  communities  in  biodiversity\nconservation.  The board of trustees is expected to meet monthly during the first two years of\nPACT establishment and thereafter as required. The board will review all proposals prepared by\nthe  applicants  and  management  officers,  and  decide  on  project  acceptability  and  the  level  of\nfunding offered (or any other conditionalities applied).\n\nG. \n\nReporting and Auditing\n\n7.\nThe  trust  has  a  number  of  reporting  responsibilities.  The  board  of  trustees  will  be\nresponsible for publishing annual and audited accounts for publication.  The board will appoint\ntrust accountants and auditors from a reputable accounting firm.\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 7, page 1\n\nTable A7.1: Summary of Costs\n($\u2019000)\n\nEnhancing\nInstitutional\nCapacity for Management Collaborative Community\nProtected Area of Protected Conservation Partnership\n\nParticipatory\nAdaptive\n\nSustainable\nFinancing\nfor\n\nManagement\n\nAreas\n\nPlanning\n\nBuilding\n\nTotal\n\n1,026\n64\n-\n98\n113\n1,300\n\n-\n1,300\n1,703\n\n301\n68\n369\n\n24\n-\n393\n\n2,278\n485\n2,763\n\n632\n463\n427\n510\n2,032\n-\n901\n-\n\n259\n362\n\n621\n\n567\n2,998\n3,565\n13,280\n569\n13,849\n-\n13,849\n\n-\n1,293\n365\n39\n-\n1,697\n\n2,049\n3,746\n-\n\n405\n-\n405\n\n62\n8\n474\n\n1,311\n67\n1,378\n\n255\n1,667\n-\n-\n1,922\n-\n519\n-\n\n98\n232\n\n329\n\n-\n-\n-\n8,367\n546\n8,913\n-\n8,913\n\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\n-\n-\n-\n\n47\n-\n47\n\n-\n-\n47\n\n19\n10\n29\n\n-\n1,071\n-\n-\n1,071\n-\n-\n-\n\n31\n238\n\n270\n\n-\n-\n-\n1,416\n35\n1,451\n-\n1,451\n\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\n-\n-\n-\n\n138\n-\n138\n\n-\n-\n138\n\n42\n27\n70\n\n60\n41\n-\n-\n101\n1,124\n217\n8,000\n\n-\n9\n\n9\n\n-\n-\n-\n9,659\n423\n10,082\n-\n10,082\n\n1,026\n1,358\n365\n137\n113\n2,997\n\n2,049\n5,046\n1,703\n\n890\n68\n958\n\n86\n8\n1,052\n\n3,651\n589\n4,240\n\n947\n3,242\n427\n510\n5,126\n1,124\n1,637\n8,000\n\n388\n841\n\n1,229\n\n568\n2,998\n3,566\n32,723\n1,573\n34,295\n426\n34,721\n\nItem\n\nInvestment Costs\nA.

In many cases, data does not exist for\n27.\nmanagement problems confronting DWLC. Good research skills exist in several universities and\nallowance has been made to provide for seven research grants to address key research topics\nannually.  The  DWLC  Research  Advisory  Committee  in  association  with  the  wildlife  NGO  will\nprioritize  and  coordinate  this  research  agenda.  The  research  will  be  undertaken  mainly  by\ngraduate-level students, thereby adding to future domestic capacity building.\n\nE. \n\nStudy Tours and Exchanges\n\n28.\nA  wealth  of  global  experience  relating  to  many  of  the  challenges  currently  faced  by\nDWLC  exists  and  provides  excellent  opportunities  for  learning.  Costa  Rica,  for  example,  has\nhad over 20 years of growth with ecotourism developments and offers a wide range of private\nand  public  models  for  examination.  Similarly,  the  PA  system  in  South  Africa  has  a  lot  of\nexperience  in  wildlife  habitat  management,  control  of  alien  species,  and  environmental\ninventories. New Zealand pioneered the development of electric fences and has continued to be\nan  innovator  in  this  field.  Allowance  has  been  made  for  visits  to  such  locations  for  small\nnumbers of DWLC staff and, in some cases, other personnel annually.\n\nF. \n\nInformation Technology Contracts\n\nA  local  company  will  be  contracted  to  provide  the  technical  inputs  to  the  design  and\n29.\ndevelopment  of  the  DWLC  information  technology  requirements.    This  will  include  web  page\ndevelopment, local area networks for Giritale and the head office, systems installation, training\nin the use of the operational systems, design and development of MIS modules and reporting\nsystems from these, and software assessment and purchase.\n\nG. \n\nCapacity Building\n\nHuman resource development - from administrative and managerial through to technical\n30.\nand  field-based  skills  -  is  central  to  updating  sector  capacities.  A  range  of  activities  has  been\nproposed, including workshops, courses, study tours, local and international short courses, and\ngraduate  fellowships  at  national,  regional,  and  international  institutions.  Within  DWLC,  training\nat  headquarters  will  be  directed  at  the  technical  units  and  the  outreach  section,  and  at\nupgrading  financial  and  accounting  offices,  and  raising  general  managerial  and  computer\nliteracy skills. Substantial training inputs will also be devoted to training at the regional and site\nlevels  of  operation.  Overall,  DWLC  accounts  for  51  percent  of  the  training  beneficiaries.  The\nremainder will include other conservation agencies and/or the private sector, communities, and\nNGOs.\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 10, page 6\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\nTotal\n\nTable A10.2: Summary of Capacity Building\n\nUnit\n\n2004\n\n2003\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n7\n8\n-\n5\n2\n2\n2\n\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n6\n1\n-\n7\n\n2\n5\n7\n2\n8\n70\n\n-\n3\n2\n-\n3\n44\n\n4\n5\n7\n1\n8\n70\n\n4\n-\n-\n1\n8\n39\n\n9\n8\n4\n-\n5\n10\n10\n\n7\n8\n4\n3\n5\n10\n8\n\n4\n-\n2\n-\n-\n20\n10\n\n2\n-\n1\n1\n1\n6\n1\n5\n17\n\n2\n2\n1\n1\n1\n6\n1\n5\n19\n\n2\n-\n1\n1\n1\n6\n1\n5\n17\n\ncourse\ncourse\ncourse\ncourse\ncourse\ncourse\ncourse\n\ncourse\ncourse\nworkshop\nworkshop\nworkshop\n\ncourse\ncourse\ncourse\ncourse\ncourse\ncourse\nworkshop\nworkshop\n\nItem\n1.

SUSTAINABILITY, AND ECONOMIC ANALYSES\n\nin \n\ninvestment \n\ninterventions  ranging \n\n1.\nThe  Project  will  generate  significant  local,  national,  and  global  returns,  many  of  which\nare  indirect  or  nonuse  benefits  that  in  all  likelihood  exceed  the  direct  benefits.    Methods  to\nquantify and value such benefits do exist and could be adopted to illustrate the full impact of the\nProject. In the context of this analysis, however, where the objective is to assess the rationale\nfor \nto  community\nfrom \nempowerment,  quantification  and  valuation  of  indirect  or  nonuse  benefits  are  less  meaningful.\nFurthermore,  given  the  resource  constraints  of  project  preparation,  the  verification  and\nmodification  of  existing  information  to  be  adapted  to  the  project  sites  were  considered\nimpractical.  Hence, the following economic and financial analyses are partial and relate only to\nspecific activities of the Project.  A qualitative description of the indirect and nonuse benefits is\nincluded to illustrate their significance.  Typically, global impacts generated by the Project would\nnot be included; however, they are mentioned here to highlight their significance, and hence the\njustification for cofinancing by the Global Environment Facility.\n\ninstitutional  strengthening \n\n2.\nThe  financial  and  economic  analyses  are  limited  to  the  Project  activities  that  relate\nspecifically to direct revenue-generating outcomes.  From a national perspective, the activities\nrelated  to  ecotourism  development  are  the  primary  focus  of  the  analysis.    From  a  local\nperspective  of  support  zone  communities,  the  focus  is  on  typical  income-generating  activities\nthat could be undertaken with the assistance of the Protected Area Conservation Trust (PACT)\nor other sources of funding.  The viability of several such activities is discussed to indicate the\nlikelihood of participation by beneficiaries.\n\nA. \n\nFinancial and Sustainability Analyses\n\n1.\n\nFiscal Impact\n\n3.\nA financial analysis was undertaken to ascertain the impact of the project interventions\non  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal  position  and  to  assess  their  financial  sustainability.    The  analysis\nincludes with- and without-Project scenarios, with the incremental effects being attributed to the\nProject.  The interventions related to ecotourism development are mainly in components A and\nB.  The cost of the interventions accounts for about 10 percent of the total investment cost, or\nabout $3.1 million.\n\nThe  revenue  stream  is  derived  mainly  from  entrance  fees  and  service  charges  at\n4.\nprotected  areas  (PAs).    In  addition,  the  Government  will  generate  revenue  from  taxes  on\nincremental goods and services (GST) developed by the support zone communities as a result\nof  project  interventions.    The  stream  of  revenue  is  estimated  on  the  basis  of  several  key\nassumptions:\n\n(i) \n\nForeign  visitor  arrivals  to  the  country  are  projected  under  three  scenarios:  high-,\nmedium-  and  low-growth.  From  historical  trends  (1995-1999),  it  is  assumed  that  11\npercent of foreign tourists will visit PAs. With the Project, it is assumed that visitors to the\nPAs  will  increase  by  1  percent  in  year  6,  increasing  up  to  5  percent  by  year  10  and\nthereafter.  Accordingly, the number of foreign visitors to PAs by year 2010 will be about\n110,000, or about 15 percent of total visitors.  The Project is likely to have a bearing on\nthe overall foreign visitor arrivals in Sri Lanka as well (as the country earns a reputation\nfor ecotourism); however, this is not taken into account in the analysis.\n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 12, page 2\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nNational  visitors  to  PAs  are  expected  to  increase  according  to  historic  trends  (1995-\n1999). With the Project, the rate of increase is assumed to be higher.  Three scenarios\nof  growth  (high,  medium,  and  low)  are  considered.    Accordingly,  in  year  2010,  about\n604,000 nationals will visit PAs.\n\nExpenditure on park entrance and services applicable to foreign tourists will increase by\n10 percent with effect from year 6 of the Project.  The corresponding increase applicable\nto  national tourists  will be 15 percent.  These are incremental effects, not counting the\naverage increase in expenditure by both categories on the basis of historical trends.\n\nIncremental  revenue  from  GST  is  calculated  on  the  assumption  that  average  daily\nexpenditure  by  foreign  tourists  (other  than  expenditure  on  park  entrance  and  services)\nwill  increase  by  5  percent  beginning  in  year  6  of  the  Project.    Correspondingly,\nexpenditure  by  national  visitors  will  increase  by  15  percent.    Expenditure  by  both\ncategories will increase, according to historic trends, in the without-Project case as well.\n\nBased on the assumptions, the analysis suggests that direct revenue to the Government\n5.\nfrom the Project will be in the range of $400,000 to $1.1 million by year 2010.  By year 2020, the\nrevenue  is  expected  to  be  $1-$2.3  million.  From  the  point  of  view  of  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal\nbalance,  therefore,  revenues  will  more  than  cover  the  Project\u2019s  operating  and  maintenance\ncosts, which are estimated to be approximately $233,000 per year.\n\n2.\n\nFinancial Sustainability\n\nThe Project extends the range of the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWLC) field\n6.\nactivities,  which  will  require  additional  resources  if  they  are  to  be  sustained.    Primary  among\nthese are the community outreach and adaptive management programs.  Whereas community\npartnerships  are  financed  through  the  PACT,  which,  due  to  the  nature  of  endowment  trusts,\nrepresents a self-sustaining input, the DWLC community outreach program is reliant on project\nfunding.    To  address  this,  the  Government  has  agreed  to  introduce  a  revenue-sharing  policy\ninvolving the transfer of a minimum of 50 percent of PA revenues to DWLC for capital works and\noperating costs.  This program is forecast to add more than SLRs100 million per annum to the\nDWLC  budget  within  a  6  year  timeframe,  which  is  earmarked  for  the  DWLC  capital  budget\ncurrently  costing  SLRs40-50  million  per  annum  and  for  the  community  outreach  and  adaptive\nmanagement  operating  programs.  Therefore,  resources  will  be  available  on  an  ongoing  basis\nfor maintaining these programs beyond the life of the Project\n\n7.\nFinancial analyses were conducted of typical income-generating projects that are likely\nto  be  financed  either  through  seed  grants  from  the  PACT  or  by  communities  accessing  other\ngovernment and nongovernment sources of funding. Typical projects include (i) woodlots owned\nor  managed  by  local  community  members,  (ii)  fenced  grazing  of  cattle,  (iii)  operating  a  rice\nstorehouse, and (iv) production of buffalo curd or honey. The models proved financially viable,\nconfirming the positive beneficiary participation in the activities to be undertaken by the PACT.\nHowever,  the  results  are  not  extrapolated  into  a  broader  analysis  of  the  Project  due  to  the\nprocess  orientation  of  the  interventions  -  resulting  in  a  potentially  wide-ranging  set  of\ninvestments - and dispersed set of beneficiaries with benefits diffused over time and space.\n\nB. \n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n8.\nThe economic analysis covers only the ecotourism-related activities of the Project and is\na  direct  extension  of  the  financial  analysis  described  above.  It  represents  a  conventional\n\n\f73\n\nAppendix 12, page 3\n\neconomic  analysis,  which  does  not  include  the  significant  positive  environmental  and  social\neffects that will be generated by the Project.  Many of these externalities cannot be meaningfully\nincluded in quantitative terms in the economic analysis and are therefore illustrated in qualitative\nterms in the following section.\n\n9.\nEconomic  border  prices  (world  price)  are  used  in  the  economic  analysis.      Costs  are\nbroken  into  traded,  nontraded,  labor  and  tax  factors  and  converted  to  world  prices.  For\nnontradables, a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.9 was applied to derive economic prices\nconsistent  with recent SCFs applied in Asian Development Bank and World Bank projects.  A\nshadow  wage  rate  factor  of  0.81  and  the  SCF  were  used  to  adjust  the  labor  component  to\neconomic prices.  The costs of local materials (nontradables) were based on prevailing market\nprices, which were assumed to remain unchanged in real terms (in constant 2000 prices).\n\n10.\nTourism  revenues  are  first  adjusted  down  to  represent  foreign  exchange  leakages\n(considered to be approximately 35 percent) and then adjusted up (by a factor of 1.35) to reflect\nthe  economic  effects  of  forward  linkages  from  tourism  within  the  national  economy.    Revenue\nfrom  national  tourism  is  stated  in  terms  of  willingness  to  pay  for  wildlife  recreational  facilities.1\nProject interventions will be ongoing over six years beginning in year 2001, and the effects will\nbe realized over a period of 20 years.\n\nC. \n\nEconomic Rates of Return and Sensitivity Analysis\n\n11.\nUsing  the  assumptions  on  costs  and  benefits,  the  base  case  economic  internal  rate  of\nreturn was calculated.  The sensitivity analysis includes three variations to the base case:  (i) a\nreduction in benefit stream by 10 percent, which is indicative of lower mean annual incremental\ntourism revenue; (ii) a 10 percent increase in costs reflecting increased costs due to site factors\nand cost overruns; and (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii).  The cash flows and the rates of return\nfor the medium-growth scenarios are shown in Table A12.\n\nD. \n\nNonquantifiable and Indirect Benefits\n\n12. While  the  focus  of  the  economic  analysis  is  on  the  direct  and  quantifiable  benefits\nresulting  from  ecotourism  and  related  services,  the  Project  has  other  significant  economic\nbenefits that are either indirect or nonquantifiable.\n\n13.\nAbove  all,  the  protection  provided  to  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  rich  and  largely  endemic  biodiversity\nprovides benefits to local, national, and global levels of society.  At the local level, communities\nwill benefit from employment and improvement in living standards generated by the demand for\necotourism-related  services.    Benefits  at  the  national  level  include  the  ability  to  cater  to  the\necotourism niche market and generate significant forward linkages within the national economy;\nability to attract external assistance and foreign direct investment in ecotourism and biodiversity-\nrelated areas; ability to comply with international commitments on protection of biodiversity; the\noption  value  of  preserving  biological  resources  for  future  exploitation,  particularly  for  bio-\nprospecting  and  research;  and  the  opportunity  to  demonstrate  effective  and  decentralized\ngovernance through a strengthened and better trained DWLC.  Global society will benefit from\n(i) the enhanced carbon sequestration potential of the PAs; (ii) protection of endemic species;\n(iii)  maintenance  of  habitat  used  by  internationally  mobile  species,  especially  turtles  and\nwaterfowl; and (iv) less tangibly, from the existence value of better managed PAs in Sri Lanka.\n\n                                                    \n1 \n\nSilva,  K.A.D.I.  and  H.  B.  Kotagama.  1997.  An  Optimal  Fee  for  Entrance  to  Uda  Walawe  National  Park:  An\nAssessment. Tropical Agric. Res. 9:317-329.\n\n\f74\n\nAppendix 12, page 4\n\nThe  community  partnerships  developed  under  component  D  will  generate  substantial\n14.\neconomic benefits to civil society, particularly in the support zones of the PAs:  192 communities\nrepresenting 180,000 people, 50 percent of whom are recipients of Samurdhi welfare payments.\nThe  project  interventions  will  benefit  them  in  several  ways,  enabling  them  to  undertake\ncollective planning and decision making, and to exercise empowerment by obtaining financing\nfor community development initiatives and new employment opportunities through the income-\ngenerating  activities.    The  overall  impact  will  be  an  improvement  in  the  standard  of  living  of\nthese  people,  and  mutually  reinforcing  and  sustainable  interactions  with  the  PAs  and  buffer\nzones adjacent to their communities.\n\n15.\nSeveral project interventions will serve to reduce the prevailing human-elephant conflict.\nReaching an exact figure on the cost of this conflict avoided by the Project is difficult.  However,\nan approximate figure can be calculated from the fact that from 1996 to 1999, DWLC paid out\nan  average  of  SLRs2.5  million  per  year  in  compensation  fund.    Assuming  that  the  amount\ncovers  only  5  percent  of  the  true  cost  of  the  human-elephant  conflict,  given  the  low  payment\nlevels and low claims, the cost can be estimated at about SLRs50 million per year. The Project\nis expected to reduce damages related to human-elephant conflict by 75 percent, leading to an\nannual estimated benefit of SLRs37.5 million or about $0.5 million.  This figure is conservative,\nsince it does not include the costs to farmers of constant night guarding and purchasing torch\nbatteries and thunder flashes during the crop season.  Nor does this figure include the impact\non  the  quality  of  life  from  constant  stress,  anxiety,  and  fear.    In  the  most  affected  villages,\nhuman-elephant conflict is listed as the most pressing problem facing the community.\n\n16.\nPAs  cover  a  substantial  portion  of  the  upper  catchments  of  several  major  rivers  and\nreservoirs, particularly Peak Wilderness Sanctuary and Horton Plains National Park since four\nmajor rivers (Mahaweli, Kelani, Walawe and Kalu) originate in these wet-zone highlands.  It is\nestimated that encroachment on the PAs is currently at a rate of over 1 percent per year; this is\nassumed  to  reduce  to  zero  with  the  project  interventions.    Encroachment  typically  implies  a\nconversion of land from its current state of degraded forest and scrub to degraded grassland, a\ntransformation  that  is  estimated  to  increase  soil  losses  by  5  tons  per  hectare  per  year.2  Apart\nfrom the cost of replacing topsoil, erosion has a significant bearing on the hydropower potential\nof downstream reservoirs, which provide over 80 percent of the nation\u2019s total electricity supply.\nThe cost of one cubic meter of siltation in terms of lost hydropower potential has been estimated\nat  $180.3    Accordingly,  the  cost  of  siltation  avoided  through  project  interventions  in  Peak\nWilderness and Horton Plains is estimated at SLRs6.2 million per year.4\n\n17.\nFinally, least tangible are the in situ ecosystem benefits such as the value of protecting\nspecies  for  future  generations  and  the  value  of  habitat  for  migratory  species.  One  study\nestimated  that  the  total  economic  value  of  biodiversity  conservation  achieved  by  Sri  Lanka  is\nabout SLRs660 per ha/yr (1994 prices). 5   Similarly, the value of biodiversity conservation from\nan international perspective has been estimated in many studies.6 No attempt is made to assign\nan  economic  value  to  the  incremental  benefits  of  biodiversity  conservation  that  will  arise  from\nthis Project; however, it is noted as significant.\n\n                                                    \n2 \nForestry Sector Master Plan, July 1995.\n3 \nLoan 1545-SRI: Upper Watershed Management Project , for 16.6 million, approved on 24 September 1997.\n4   Horton Plains and Peak Wilderness cover a total area of 25,500 hectares, and 2.7 tons of silt is required to fill 1\n\n5  Ekanayake,  E.R.M.  and  P.
