The Program will\nbe implemented over five years (FY2001-FY2005).\n\nis  designed \n\nto  assist \n\nAs  a  small  landlocked  country,  Bhutan  faces  constraints  because  of\nits mountainous  terrain;  high population growth rate, but limited pool\nof  skilled  human  resources;  and  economy  that  is  still  basically\nagricultural despite signs of industrial growth and diversification. The\nto  human\nGovernment  has  always  accorded  high  priority \ndevelopment and has achieved remarkable progress in improving the\ncountry\u2019s  social  indicators,  particularly  in  education  and  health.\nHowever,  investment  in  human  development  will  remain  critical  to\nthe  predominantly  rural\n(i) improving \npopulation,  which  is  widely  dispersed  across  the  country;  and\n(ii) providing  the  much-needed  human  capital  to  support  a  growing\neconomy. When viewed in this context, the development of a healthy\npopulation  provides  the  key  to  the  country\u2019s  sustained  economic\ngrowth and poverty reduction.\n\nthe  social  well-being  of \n\nis  seeking \n\nWith  human  development  serving  as  the  primary  objective  of  its\ndevelopment  strategy, \nto  ensure\nthe  Government \ncontinued  progress  in  improving  the  health  status  of  the  population.\nThe  Government  recognizes  the  need  to  develop  a  comprehensive\npolicy framework to address the structural weaknesses in the health\nsector,  and  new  challenges  and  demands  that  are  expected  to\nemerge from an evolving economy. Specifically, the reform agenda is\naimed  at  enhancing  efficiency  in  resource  allocation;  ensuring\nequitable  access  to  primary  health  care  (PHC)  services;  and\nstrengthening the planning and management capacity, and regulatory\nframework for the health sector.\n\nThe  Program  encompasses  major  policy  measures \nthat  will\ncollectively promote a more enabling environment for the Government\nto pursue its ongoing and future health programs. The Program was\ndesigned  in  consultation  with  other  major  aid  agencies  and  its\nimplementation  is  expected  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  their\nvarious health programs. Sustainability of health sector financing is a\nkey  feature  of  the  Program  as  other  sectors  are  bound  to  claim  an\nincreasing share of the Government budget as the economy expands\nand the population continues to grow at a rapid pace. It is inevitable\nthat the Government must explore innovative and sustainable ways of\nfinancing  a  potential  resource  gap  in  the  health  sector  and  help\nreduce  its  dependence  on  external  assistance.  In  addition,  the\n\n\fiii\n\nGovernment  must  protect  and  strengthen  its  core  health  program,\nwhich  specifically  addresses  PHC  needs  of  vulnerable  groups,\nparticularly women and children. A key feature of the Program is the\nestablishment of the Bhutan Health Trust Fund (BHTF) to help ensure\nlong-term  sustainable  financing  of  vaccines  and  essential  drugs.\nThus,  by  incorporating  policy  initiatives  to  ensure  a  more  focused\napproach \ntargeting  specific\nvulnerable groups, the Program will put into practice the forthcoming\nthe\nfor  poverty \npartnership  agreement \nGovernment and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).\n\nin  addressing  equity  aspects  and \n\nreduction  between \n\nThe  principal  objective  of  the  Program  is  to  provide  support  for  the\nGovernment\u2019s  comprehensive  reform  agenda  for  strengthening  the\nhealth sector. Its scope includes five policy priority areas: (i) develop\nsustainable financing for the health sector; (ii) strengthen capacity in\nhealth  sector  management;  (iii)  strengthen  quality  assurance  and\npublic  health  regulatory  functions;  (iv)  adjust  imbalances  in  human\nresources for health; and (v) strengthen PHC through selective PHC\ninterventions and expansion of priority services.\n\nObjectives and\nScope\n\nClassification\n\nPrimary Objective:  Human Development\nSecondary Objective: Poverty Reduction\n\nEnvironmental\nAssessment\n\nCategory C\nEnvironmental  implications  of  the  Program  were  reviewed  and  no\nsignificant environmental impacts were identified.\n\nThe ADB Loan\n\nLoan Amount and\nTerms\n\nProgram Period\nand Tranching\n\nA  loan  of  $10.0  million  is  proposed  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds\nresources.  The  loan  will  have  a  repayment  period  of  24  years,\nincluding a grace period of 8 years. An interest rate of 1 percent will\nbe  charged  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per\nannum thereafter, and other terms and conditions in accordance with\nthe Loan Agreement.\n\nThe  Program  will  cover  five  years  (FY2001-FY2005).  The  proposed\nloan  is  to  be  disbursed  in  two  tranches.  The  first  tranche  of  $5.0\nmillion  will  be  made  available  upon  loan  effectiveness,  while  the\nsecond tranche, also for $5.0 million, will be made available following\nthe  Government\u2019s  compliance  with  the  conditions  set  for  its  release.\nThe Program will be completed by June 2005.\n\nExecuting Agency Ministry of Health and Education (MOHE)\n\nProcurement\n\nThe loan will finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding local\nduties  and  taxes)  of  imports  procured  in  and  from  ADB\u2019s  member\ncountries, other than those specified in the list of ineligible items and\nthose  items  financed  by  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  official\nsources.  Procurement  of  eligible  items  under  the  loan  will  be  based\non  normal  commercial  practices  for  procurement  by  the  private\n\n\fiv\n\nsector, or standard Government procurement procedures acceptable\nto  ADB  for  procurement  by  the  public  sector.  In  the  case  of  goods\ncommonly  traded  on  international  commodity  markets,  procurement\nwill be undertaken in accordance with procedures appropriate to the\ntrade and acceptable to ADB.\n\nCounterpart Funds The proceeds of the proposed loan will help the Government meet the\ncapital funding requirements of the BHTF. Any local currency proceeds\ngenerated  by  the  loan  will  be  used  to  support  the  implementation  of\nspecific policy initiatives of the Program and to meet other expenditures\nin the health sector.\n\nRisks and\nSafeguards\n\nThe  Program  was  formulated  on  the  basis  of  the  Government\u2019s\ncontinued  commitment  to  accord  priority  to  the  health  sector,\nincluding  budgetary  and  human  resources.  Any  major  change  in  the\npolicy  direction  of \nthe  Government,  caused  by  weakening\nmacroeconomic and fiscal position could delay the implementation of\npolicy actions as originally intended. Policy discussions between ADB\nand  the  Government  at  the  ministerial  level  have  revealed  that  the\ncountry\u2019s  development  policy,  anchored  on  the  principles  of  social\njustice  and  equity,  will  continue  to  accord  budgetary  priority  to  the\nsocial  sectors,  including  health.  Continuing  support  from  the  major\nsources  of  external  assistance  in  Bhutan\u2019s  health  programs  will\nprovide another safeguard against any derailment of the Program due\nto an economic downturn.\n\nits \n\nintersectoral  nature.

The  TA  also  assessed  the  options  for  promoting  sustainable\nfinancing  for  health  services  including  the  introduction  of  a  Bhutan  Health  Trust  Fund  (BHTF)\nthat would enable the Government to meet the demands of economic growth and diversification.\nDuring  TA  implementation,  field  surveys,  focus  group  discussions,  and  consultations  with  key\nstakeholders, including major aid agencies, were conducted and the results were used to design\nthe Health Care Reform Program. A poverty impact assessment of the Program was prepared,\nwhich  was  improved  by  the  Fact-Finding  Mission  from  20  March-5  April  2000.  The  Appraisal\nMission,2 which visited Bhutan from 24 May-2 June 2000, held further consultations with major\nstakeholders  and  conducted  an  information-sharing  workshop  in  which  various  Government\nministries,  district  and  health  workers,  and  major  aid  agencies  participated.  The  Program\nframework was subsequently updated and refined as shown in Appendix 1.\n\nIII.\n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT\n\nA.\n\nDevelopment Objectives, Strategy and Plans\n\n3.\nThe  Human  Development  Index  of  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  ranks\nBhutan  142nd  of  174  countries.3  Over  85  percent  of  the  population  reside  in  rural  areas,  and\nmost  of  the  population  depend  on  subsistence  agriculture.  There  are  wide  variations  in\nhousehold  income  depending  on  the  geographic  area.  Although  the  low  Bhutanese  income\ngenerally reflects widespread income poverty, the kind of abject poverty seen in some parts of\nAsia as a result of such low incomes is not evident in Bhutan. The Government\u2019s social welfare\npolicies over many years have focused on promoting human development and have resulted in\nrelatively widespread social well-being. Women in Bhutan generally have a much higher status\nthan their counterparts in many other countries in South Asia. Coverage of the population with\nclean water and access to latrines continues to increase concomitant with the integration of rural\nwater  and  sanitation  projects  as  part  of  the  country\u2019s  health  program.  As  such,  the  entire\npopulation is expected to gain access to potable water by the end of the Eighth Five-Year Plan\nor the Eighth Plan (FY1998-FY2002).\n\n4.\nRecent investments in the education sector have resulted in significant improvements in\neducational  status  and  literacy,  especially  for  girls,  and  given  ongoing  investments,  this  trend\nwill continue. The primary school enrolment rate is 72 percent and has been increasing steadily.\n\n1 TA 3186-BHU: Health Care Financing and Reform Program, for $150,000, approved on 16 April 1999.\n2 The Mission comprised E.A. Cua, Senior Project Specialist and Mission Leader and R. Vankina, Counsel, and was\n\nassisted by S.W. Handayani, Social Development Specialist.\n\n3 UNDP, Human Development Report, 2000.\n\n\f2\n\nAdult  literacy  has  significantly  improved  from  23  percent  in  1980  to  54  percent  in  1996;\nhowever, this conceals the much lower literacy rate of 28 percent for women. Moreover, limited\ntertiary  education  opportunities  and  few  job  openings  in  the  service  and  Government  sectors\nhave led to increasing concerns regarding employment opportunities for high school graduates.\n\n5.\nDemographic  factors  also  play  a  significant  role  in  determining  patterns  of  health  and\ndisease. In 1997, the population of Bhutan was estimated at 618,000 and growing at an annual\nrate  of  3.1  percent.  This  high  rate  of  population  growth,  which  increased  from  2.0  percent  in\n1984,  is  primarily  attributed  to  a  rapid  decline  in  mortality.  This  rate  of  growth  will  result  in  a\ndoubling of the population in 20 years, and will have a major impact on the demand for health\nservices. The Government has identified population growth as a major development issue and\nis active in population planning activities. Recent intensification of family planning activities has\nprobably  resulted  in  a  significant  increase  in  the  contraceptive  prevalence  rate  and  should\nreduce fertility and population growth rates.\n\n6.\nThere has been a significant increase in internal rural-to-urban migration during the past\n20  years  as  shown  by  the  declining  share  of  rural  population  from  95  percent  in  1980  to  the\ncurrent  85  percent  of  the  total  population.  This  migration  is  likely  to  continue  and  will  affect\ndemand  for  health  services.  Unofficial  immigration  and  traffic  across  the  relatively  porous\nsouthern and eastern borders may affect utilization of services and patterns of disease as well\n(communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS4 are of primary concern).\n\n7.\nDevelopment efforts in Bhutan have also usually involved the participation of the various\nsectors  of  society.  This  approach  has  been  instrumental  in  promoting  good  governance  and\nimproving social development. In line with the development philosophy of the Government, the\nhealth and education sectors comprise over one quarter of public spending. Health alone is now\nover  11  percent  of  the  total,  an  increase  from  6.5  percent  in  1992/93.  Total  health  care\nexpenditures  represent  about  4.0  percent  of  GDP,  comparing  favorably  with  other  DMCs  in\nSouth and South East Asia.\n\nB.\n\nRecent Economic Performance and Prospects\n\nBhutan\u2019s  traditional  economy,  which  is  based  on  subsistence  agriculture  and  barter\n8.\ntrade, began to diversify in the 1980s when gross domestic product (GDP) growth accelerated,\nreaching  8  percent  per  year.  Economic  growth  and  prudent  fiscal  management  have  enabled\ndomestic  revenues  to  adequately  cover  all  recurrent  costs  in  almost  every  year  since  1993.\nHowever  the  tax  base  is  still  limited,  and  the  country  relies  heavily  on  external  assistance  to\nfund  its  development  programs,  particularly  capital  expenditures.  Although  the  Government\nplans to introduce a personal income tax in 2001 once the required legislation is completed, the\ngains from this new tax mechanism are not expected to be realized for some time.\n\n9.\nThe  key  source  of  growth  in  Bhutan\u2019s  economy  has  been  hydroelectric  power,  the\ndevelopment  of  which  has  been  largely  funded  by  assistance  from  India.  Revenues  from  the\nhydroelectric  power  plants  comprise  40  percent  of  total  Government  current  revenues;  the\nexpected  tripling  of  production  should  eventually  reduce  the  Government\u2019s  dependence  on\ninternational  assistance.  The  trade  balance  shows  a  significant  dependence  on  India,  for  both\ntrade  and  assistance.  Over  90  percent  of  exports  are  normally  to  India,  and  70  percent  of\nimports originate from India. India provides more than half of the country\u2019s total grant assistance\nand a third of its total public external debt in 1999.\n\n4 HIV/AIDS refers to human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\n\n\f3\n\n10.\nPrudent  fiscal  management  notwithstanding,  Bhutan  will  need  to  address  certain\nfundamental issues and potential risks: (i) the fragile dependence on energy exports to India as\nthe  single  most  important  source  of  Government  revenue;  (ii)  limited  and  structurally  weak\ndomestic revenue base that may not be able to cover rising recurrent expenditures to maintain\nphysical  and  social  infrastructure,  and  specific  programs;  (iii)  the  possible  slowdown  of  the\ninflow of grants and concessional loans; and (iv) increasing debt-service requirements for loans\nused to finance new power projects. Key socioeconomic indicators are presented in Appendix 2.\n\nA.\n\nBackground and Recent Performance\n\nIV.\n\nTHE SECTOR\n\n11.\nThe  development  of  modern  health  systems  and  health  infrastructure  in  Bhutan\ncommenced during the early 1960s. Prior to this, access to western medical services, provided\nby  a  few  Indian-trained  Bhutanese  physicians,  was  limited.  The  majority  of  the  population\nutilized  traditional  medical  services  and  obtained  spiritual  assistance  offered  by  religious\ninstitutions  for  treatment  of  illness.  While  allopathic  medical  services  continue  to  expand,\ntraditional medicine is still recognized as the official medical tradition in Bhutan and is included\nin the national health system.\n\n12.\nThe Government provides essentially all modern medical services in the country, apart\nfrom that provided by a few private pharmacy outlets in the main towns. The health system is\nbased  on  the  principles  of  primary  health  care  (PHC),  and  provides  integrated  curative,\npreventive, and promotive services. This approach targets vulnerable groups (the poor, women,\nchildren,  and  rural  populations)  through  the  establishment  of  basic  health  units  (BHUs)\nnationwide,  and  through  the  delivery  of  services  appropriate  for  these  groups  (communicable\ndisease  control;  reproductive  health  services  including  family  planning,  immunization,  water,\nand sanitation; and provision of essential drugs). This focus on basic health services is a critical\naspect of social development and poverty reduction, and has proved to be an effective strategy\nfor reaching out to the thinly scattered settlements throughout the country\u2019s mountainous terrain.\nSelected data on Bhutan\u2019s health sector are shown in Appendix 3.\n\n1.\n\nHealth Status\n\nHuge strides have been made, especially since the 1980s, in improving the health status\n13.\nof the Bhutanese population. Life expectancy at birth, 48 years in 1984, rose dramatically to 66\nyears  in  1994.  Marked  improvement  is  evident  in  infant  and  under-five  mortality  rates,  and\nsignificantly, there is no gender disparity in these rates. Childhood immunization coverage has\nbeen  generally  sustained  at  over  80  percent  since  1990.  No  cases  of  poliomyelitis  have  been\ndiagnosed  since  1986  and  the  last  neonatal  tetanus  death  occurred  in  1994.  No  other  deaths\nfrom  vaccine-preventable  diseases  have  been  reported  since  1994.5  The  maternal  mortality\nrate, 770 per 100,000 live births in 1984, dropped to 380 in 1994. Iodine deficiency disorder, a\nmajor problem a decade ago is now virtually eliminated, and leprosy is almost eradicated. The\nremarkable  improvement  in  health  indicators  has  been  attributed  to  the  Government\u2019s\n\n5 Mortality reporting is of questionable completeness and quality in Bhutan; nevertheless, that there have been no\nreported deaths is a significant improvement over past performance. In addition, using data on mortality rates for\ncomparative purposes should be done with caution, given the country\u2019s small population base.\n\n\f4\n\ncontinuing  commitment  to  provide  universal  access  to  a  package  of  minimum  essential  health\nservices under its health-for-all objective.\n\n2.\n\nHealth Infrastructure\n\n14.\nHealth  services  are  delivered  through  a  four-tier  network  consisting  of  the  national\nreferral hospital, the regional referral hospitals, the district hospitals, and BHUs. The BHU is a\nprimary  level  institution  in  the  health  care  system  and  caters  to  a  population  of  about  2,500-\n5,000. The standard staff complement of a BHU comprises a health assistant, an auxiliary nurse\nmidwife, and a basic health worker. Each BHU has an average of 3-6 outreach clinics (ORCs)\nthrough which services to the most distant villages are delivered, at present on a once-a-month\nbasis.  These  ORCs,  to  a  large  extent  funded  by  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF),\nhave  been  instrumental  in  increasing  access  to  services;  it  is  anticipated  that  activities  will  be\ncarried out in these posts more frequently in the future. To date, there are 145 BHUs across the\ncountry; together with their ORCs, they enable the Government to provide basic health services\nto about 90 percent of the population. The Government intends to consolidate and strengthen its\nhealth  infrastructure  during  the  Eighth  Plan  with  an  additional  15  BHUs  to  be  constructed  by\n2002.\n\n15.\nDistrict  hospitals  are  the  first-level  referral  institutions  and  are  equipped  to  provide\ncurative,  promotive,  preventive,  and  emergency  services.  There  are  currently  28  district\nhospitals  (including  the  three  regional  referral  hospitals),  14  of  which  have  indigenous  units.\nRegional  referral  hospitals  are  the  second-level  referral  hospitals  and  provide  specialist\nservices.  At  the  national  level  is  the  Jigme  Dorji  Wangchuck  National  Referral  Hospital\n(JDWNRH), which also serves as the regional referral hospital for the western region.\n\n3.\n\nHuman Resources for Health\n\n16. While the Government continues to need the services of expatriate physicians, there is a\ngradual shift to reliance on nationals. At present, only 8 of the 98 physicians practicing in Bhutan\nare expatriates. The Government is committed to providing a totally Bhutanese health staff as\nsoon  as  possible.  The  establishment  of  the  Royal  Institute  of  Health  Sciences  (RIHS)  in  1974\nwas the first step in the development of self-reliance in human resources. Apart from physicians,\nthe very few baccalaureate-educated health workers, and certain specialized health personnel,\ntraining  of  health  staff  in  Bhutan  is  carried  out  by  RIHS.  In  addition  to  the  clinical  staff,  RIHS\ntrains X-ray, pharmacy, laboratory, dental, and physiotherapy technicians, as well as opticians\nand ophthalmic assistants.\n\n17.\nThe foundation of the health system is the nurse and other paramedic staff: the general\nnurse  midwife,  health  assistant,  auxiliary  nurse  midwife,  assistant  nurse,  and  basic  health\nworker.  They  are  generally  attached  to  the  BHUs  and  assisted  by  village  health  workers,\nvolunteers  who  motivate  the  communities,  provide  a  link  between  the  health  services  and  the\ncommunity, and provide simple treatments.\n\nThe  Royal  Civil  Service  Commission  (RCSC)  is  responsible  for  human  resource\n18.\nplanning, and for selecting candidates for both national and international training. The number of\ntraining  positions  is  determined  based  on  the  Master  Plan  for  Human  Resources,  which  was\ndeveloped in FY1995. Since then, the master plan has not been updated, and there is no recent\nofficial report on projected staffing needs.\n\n\f5\n\n4.\n\nHealth Services Management and Planning\n\n19.\nThe  Government  has  adopted  the  policy  of  decentralization  as  a  major  objective  in\nmanaging  the  delivery  of  health  services.  Commencing  in  1981,  the  district  (dzongkhag)\nadministrations  were  made  entirely  responsible  for  all  health  services,  excluding  referral\nhospitals  and  training  institutions.  In  addition,  management  of  health  services  is  anchored  on\ntwo strategic approaches: the integration of health services and the empowerment of peripheral\nhealth  workers.  Thus,  disease-specific  activities  are  being  addressed  in  an  integrated  fashion\nnot through vertical health programs requiring separate health workers and facilities. BHU staff\nhelp  determine  the  relevance  of  national  programs  in  the  local  context  and  set  their  program\npriorities in consultation with the district health supervisory officer.\n\nPlanning  in  the  health  sector  comprises  three-linked  stages:  the  five-year  plan,  the\n20.\nannual plan, and the planning of day-to-day activities. It follows a bottom-up process with local\nadministrations  preparing  proposals  that  are  submitted  to  the  Policy  and  Planning  Division\n(PPD)  of  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Education  (MOHE).  Health  workers  actively  participate  in\ndeveloping annual operational plans. This participatory planning process culminates every year\nwith the annual health conference which is attended by all district health medical officers, and\nsupervisors,  engineers,  and  concerned  staff  of  MOHE  and  national-level,  health-related\ninstitutes.  The  annual  health  conference  has  become  a  very  useful  forum  for  sharing\nexperiences,  reviewing  progress  of  health  programs,  receiving  feedback  from  the  field,\nidentifying  problems  and  issues,  and  providing  inputs  for  the  preparation  of  health  sector\nprogram strategies and plans. This annual interaction between policymakers and field workers\nin  Bhutan  has  substantially  contributed  to  the  development  of  a  health  system  based  on\ntransparency  and  accountability,  and  demonstrates  the  priority  the  Government  accords  to\nimproving the health status of the people.\n\n5.\n\nHealth Expenditures and Financing\n\n21.\nHealth  services  and  drugs  are  generally  provided  free-of-charge  for  nationals,  and\nnonnationals  with  work  permits.  The  Government  also  shoulders  the  costs  of  tertiary  care\nincurred  by  patients  who  cannot  be  treated  within  the  country  and  are  referred  for  treatment\neither in India or Thailand. The public health system is largely financed by the Government and\ninternational aid and to a small extent, by a contribution by civil servants representing 1 percent\nof  their  salaries  (estimated  to  meet  only  1.2  percent  of  total  health  expenditures).  Recently,\nsome direct user charges were introduced for private cabins, medical certificates, some dental\nprocedures  and  diagnostics  in  hospital  facilities.  On  the  average,  external  assistance  has\naccounted  for  43  percent  of  total  health  expenditures  annually  during  1995-1998,  and  was\nestimated to meet 65 percent of public expenditures in health care in FY1999. Although most of\nthis assistance is for capital expenditures, a considerable portion is for recurrent expenditures,\ncausing concern for sustained financing of the sector.\n\n22. Within  the  public  health  sector,  the  major  expenditure  has  been  in  capital  investment\n(over  45  percent  of  total  expenditures)  reflecting  the  ongoing  investment  in  expanding  health\nservice  infrastructure.  Recurrent  expenditures  have  been  increasing  each  year,  although  their\nshare  of  total  health  expenditures  has  been  declining  with  the  recent  surge  in  capital\nexpenditures. By component, personnel cost is the most important area of recurrent expenditure\nin the health sector. Total personnel costs are equal to 36 percent of recurrent costs, and are\nrising  in  both  absolute  and  relative  terms  as  the  Government  fills  human  resources  gaps  still\nfaced  by  the  sector.  Another  major  expenditure  item,  drug  and  nondrug  medical  supplies  (9.5\npercent of total expenditures) has been shrinking in real terms in recent years.\n\n\f6\n\nB.\n\nConstraints and Issues\n\n23.\nThe  huge  strides  made  in  improving  health  status  notwithstanding,  there  are  evident\ndeficiencies.  Although  investments  in  infrastructure  development  could  partially  address\ngeographic  and  other  physical  constraints,  capacity-building  efforts  and  policy  reforms  are\ncritically  needed  to  enhance  efficiency  and  quality  of  health  care  delivery,  and  to  ensure\nsustainable  financing  of  the  sector.  The  high  population  growth  rate  will  place  additional\npressure on health care financing, where recurrent expenditures have been rising substantially.\nIn  addition,  the  demographic  transition  (a  shift  to  an  older  population  structure)  will  result  in  a\nshift from a pattern of morbidity and mortality dominated by infectious diseases, to a pattern in\nwhich  chronic  degenerative  diseases  predominate.  Economic  development  will  also  lead  to\ngreater  demand  for  a  wider  range  of  services  currently  not  available.  These  imply  that  new\ndemands  will  be  put  on  existing  human  resources,  which  currently  are  critically  inadequate  in\nmany  areas.  Public  health  concerns  have  also  emerged  on  the  use  of  alcohol  and  betel,\nincreased smoking, and the potential spread of HIV/AIDS. For the Government to continue its\nsignificant progress in improving the health status of the population, reforms will be needed to\naddress  current  weaknesses  and  to  prepare  for  emerging  and  future  challenges.  These  will\nnecessarily  involve  measures  to  ensure  financial  strength,  improve  management  practices,\nstrengthen  human  resources  for  health,  and  strengthen  the  regulatory  framework  for  public\nhealth including the development of sound environmental policies.\n\n1. \n\nHealth Sector Financing\n\nHealth in Bhutan is an import-intensive sector that requires substantial foreign currency\n24.\nto finance essential drugs, vaccines, equipment, other medical supplies and training. In addition,\nthere  is  a  growing  concern  about  the  accelerated  rise  in  number  and  cost  of  out-of-country\nreferrals,  mainly  because  of  the  increase  of  noncommunicable  diseases  such  as  cancer.  For\ninstance, the cost of out-of-country treatment increased by more than three times during 1994-\n1999;  out-of-country  referrals  now  account  for  5  percent  of  total  health  care  expenditures.  As\nthis  trend  and  the  increase  in  personnel  costs  continue,  without  increasing  budgetary\ncommitments,  other  areas  of  the  budget,  such  as  medical  supplies,  will  continue  to  contract.\nCurrent  health  expenditure  patterns  have  also  revealed  inefficiencies  in  the  use  of  health\nservices  due  to  the  non-compliance  with  the  referral  system,  with  patients  bypassing  primary\nhealth facilities and referring themselves to district and national hospitals. In certain cases, this\npractice  is  exacerbated  by  the  poor  prescription  and  extensive  use  of  free,  nonessential,  and\nlow-impact drugs, such as paracetamol and antacids and the irrational use of antibiotics. Such\npractices have contributed to the increase in health expenditures on nonessential drugs.\n\n25.\nThe dependence on international aid to meet rising health expenditures is considerable,\nbut  cannot  be  taken  for  granted  over  the  long  term.  Although  the  Government  expects  to\ngenerate additional revenues through the export of hydropower and levy of personal income tax,\nthe health sector will still have to compete with other sectors for its share of the national budget.\nThus,  longer  term,  sustainable  solutions  to  financing  health  sector  import  requirements  are\nessential and should now be explored by the Government. In addition, measures to improve the\nefficient  use  of  resources  and  to  contain  costs  should  be  introduced  to  promote  more  rational\nuse  of  health  services  and  reduce  wastage.  The  adoption  of  a  social  insurance  scheme  has\nbeen deemed inappropriate at this stage given current conditions, such as low GDP per capita,\nlack  of  a  large  enough  formal  wage  and  private  sector,  and  the  still  predominantly  rural  and\ndispersed population. The costs of administering a scheme with limited population coverage are\nhigh.  However,  the  Government  is  pursuing  several  financing  options  including  (i)  the  recent\n\n\f7\n\ncreation of a BHTF as a sustainable financing mechanism to meet future import requirements of\nvaccines,  essential  drugs,  and  new  technologies;  and  (ii)  the  expansion  of  selected  user\ncharges for other nonessential services.\n\n2. \n\nHealth Management and Planning\n\n26.\nAlthough  the  health  management  system  has  been  strengthened  and  participatory\nplanning processes firmly established particularly with external assistance, there remains room\nfor  improvement  to  ensure  the  equity  and  quality  aspects  of  health  care.  Decentralized  health\nmanagement  could  become  even  more  effective  when  this  is  accompanied  by  strong\ninstitutional  capacity,  integrated  program  reporting,  and  monitoring  mechanisms  at  the  central\nlevel. The existing health management information system (HMIS) functions well in comparison\nwith information systems in many other countries. However, the HMIS, which has evolved over\nthe years in an ad hoc fashion, suffers from duplication, complexity, lack of qualitative data and\nanalysis,  and  other  inconsistencies.  While  health  programs  and  plans  have  objectives  with\nmeasurable and time-limited targets, deficiencies in the HMIS have undermined MOHE\u2019s ability\nto track progress in achieving these targets.\n\n27.\nIn  addition,  reports  on  some  health  programs,  such  as  the  expanded  program  for\nimmunization, tuberculosis, and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are separately prepared.\nData  need  to  be  disaggregated  by  age,  gender,  and  economic  and  minority  group,  and  if\npopulation size warrants, by geographic area. A comprehensive strategic framework is needed\nto guide policy planning and monitoring functions, and to update the HMIS for better targeting of\nhealth  programs  and  beneficiaries.  There  is  also  a  need  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  PPD,\nwhich  currently  lacks  adequate  staff  to  carry  out  its  planning,  monitoring  and  evaluation\nfunctions.\n\n28.\nExpenditure  reporting  requirements  are  also  numerous  due  to  the  various  funding\nagencies in the health sector; however, the current system for financial reporting does not link\nexpenditures  to  output  of  the  programs  and  delivery  system.  The  current  budgetary  reporting\nsystem is based on actual cash flows and does not cover the in-kind assistance of aid agencies.\nIt needs to be improved to take account of the magnitude of such a component and to enable a\nmore accurate evaluation of program delivery based on total investments, including donations in\nkind.  Streamlining  sector  financial  management  would  complement  capacity-building  efforts  in\nthis area.\n\n3. \n\nHuman Resources for Health\n\n29.\nThe shortage of human resources is a problem that affects all sectors in Bhutan. Despite\nGovernment  efforts  to  provide  out-of-country  training  since  the  1960s,  there  remain  critical\nshortages  in  many  areas;  this  is  particularly  evident  in  the  health  sector  where  there  is  a\ncontinued  reliance  on  expatriates  and  out-of-country  treatment  for  specialist  care.  RCSC  has\nprepared  a  human  resource  development  (HRD)  master  plan  for  the  Eighth  Plan  period  with\ninputs  from  the  various  sectors.  These  sector  plans  were  to  be  updated  annually,  but  this\nrevision  has  yet  to  be  completed  by  MOHE.  As  personnel  are  the  key  component  of  health\nexpenditures, changes in human resource planning have major impacts on overall expenditures.\nThe  master  plan  is  also  used  by  RCSC  to  plan  investments  in  out-of-country  undergraduate\neducation. If the plan does not present an accurate reflection of the goals of the health sector,\nresources  can  be  wasted  by  investing  in  the  wrong  areas.  Updating  of  the  HRD  plan  for  the\nhealth sector is long overdue.\n\n\f8\n\nCertain gender bias exists in the selection and career structure of paramedical workers.\n30.\nBy definition, the health assistant, who has the supervisory role at the BHU, is male. This policy\nwas adopted due to difficulty assigning female health assistants in remote areas where travel to\nisolated  villages  is  required.  Thus,  at  present  females  cannot  apply  for  training  as  a  health\nassistant;  therefore  they  are  automatically  prevented  from  advancing  to  the  next  position  of\ndistrict health supervisory officer. This lack of equal opportunity in career and training needs to\nbe addressed when revising the HRD plan for the health sector. At the community level, there is\na need to promote the role of village health worker to help prevent its numbers from declining\nand to encourage more community participation.\n\n4. \n\nQuality Assurance and Public Health Regulations\n\nMOHE  has  a  well-established  system  of  supervision  of  BHUs  and  district  hospitals.\n31.\nHowever a significant weakness is evident in the lack of standardized guidelines and checklists.\nApart from this system for health facility supervision, quality assurance is lacking for the health\nsystem as a whole. There is a need, therefore, to develop the institutional capacity for promoting\nquality assurance.\n\n32.\nBhutan\u2019s traditional and consensual society relies on a relatively informal system of rules\ngoverning  all  aspects  of  comportment  of  the  population.  Bhutan\u2019s  legal  system  is  evolving  a\nsystem of formal and objective law. A number of laws, regulations, resolutions, endorsements,\nand  circulars  with  relevance  to  the  health  sector  exist;  they  are  promulgated  by  various\nministries, including MOHE, and more peripheral levels of government. However, little regulation\nexists for several issues of great public health importance. For instance, it is well known that the\nmost  effective  intervention  to  ensure  the  health  of  the  newborn  and  infant  is  exclusive  breast-\nfeeding.  While  breast-milk  substitutes  are  occasionally  required,  their  indiscriminate  use\ninvariably  results  in  increased  rates  of  diarrhea  and  increased  infant  mortality.  In  Bhutan,\ndiarrhea  remains  the  second  leading  cause  of  infant  mortality.  Marketing  of  these  products\nneeds to be regulated to ensure that breast-feeding is promoted, and that caregivers are aware\nof the dangers of using substitutes.\n\n33.\nTraining  of  health  professionals  both  in  Bhutan  and  out-of-country  is  a  top  priority.\nHowever, to date, there is no system of regulation of professional competence (including basic\ntraining  and  continuing  education)  of  health  workers  at  any  level;  nor  are  there  guidelines\nrelated to the ethical standards of the professions. Standardization of professional competence\nand conduct is crucial to the safe and effective functioning of a health system.\n\n34.\nOther  specific  areas  of  great  public  health  importance  for  which  little  regulation  exists\ninclude occupational health and safety, substance abuse (alcohol, tobacco, and betel), disposal\nof medical waste, environmental health related to urban development, and regulation of private\nsector  health  services  (pharmacies,  diagnostic  facilities,  and  dental  and  eye  services).  The\nMinistry of Trade and Industry has promulgated some regulations regarding the sale of alcohol\nand pharmaceuticals, but these are of relatively limited scope.\n\nUntil recently, laws, regulations, and other legal documents, although widely understood,\n35.\nhave  not  been  compiled,  catalogued  and  maintained.  Also,  while  these  legal  documents  may\nhave  significant  health  ramifications,  there  is  no  system  in  place  to  ensure  the  participation  of\nthe health sector in their formulation. Nor is there a formal mechanism to ensure that MOHE is\naware  of  their  existence.  The  Government  needs  to  overcome  this  institutional  weakness  in\norder to strengthen its regulatory function in the health sector.\n\n\f9\n\n5. \n\nGaps in Primary Health Care\n\n36.\nThe huge program of infrastructure development over the past decade has resulted in a\nnear  optimum  level  of  health  infrastructure  at  the  primary  level.  The  number  of  district  and\nregional  referral  hospitals  has  significantly  increased  and  their  capacity  improved.  However,\nthere  are  certain  gaps  and  other  weaknesses  in  PHC6  which  the  Government  must  overcome\nsince  PHC  is  the  most  effective  and  direct  intervention  for  protecting  the  poor  and  other\nvulnerable  groups.  The  high  population  growth  rate  implies  that  reproductive  health  and\nimmunization  programs  deserve  particular  attention  to  benefit  women  and  children.  Currently,\nPHC  accounts  for  about  50  percent  of  total  recurrent  health  expenditures  (by  level),  and\nbudgetary  support  must  not  be  allowed  to  fall  below  this  level  if  future  gains  are  to  be\naccomplished. It is thus crucial for the Government to address some of the specific weaknesses\nidentified  in  the  PHC  system.  The  maternal  mortality  rate,  halved  between  1984  and  1994,  is\nstill too high at 380; much of this mortality is due to the lack of adequate obstetrical care. Access\nto reproductive health services including essential obstetrical care and clinical family planning is\ncurrently  limited  by  the  lack  of  staff  trained  in  surgery  and  anesthesia.  Improvements  in  these\nservices  would  help  to  reduce  maternal  morbidity  and  mortality.  Recent  investigations  by  the\nEpidemiology and Research Unit have found that about 15 percent of hospital deliveries are of\nlow  birth  weight,  and  just  under  20  percent  of  under-fives  exhibit  moderate  to  severe\nmalnutrition.  Also,  there  is  a  high  prevalence  of  iron  deficiency  and  subclinical  vitamin  A\ndeficiency.\n\n37.\nAs  in  most  developing  countries,  the  burden  of  infectious  disease  is  high.  Acute\nrespiratory  tract  infections  (ARI)  and  diarrhea  continue  to  be  the  most  frequent  diagnoses  at\nBHUs  and  hospitals.  In  addition,  the  expanded  program  on  immunization  (EPI),  already  a\nsignificant factor in the reduction of childhood morbidity and mortality, is considering introducing\na vaccine against Haemophilus influenza b but the role of this pathogen in the etiology of ARI in\nBhutan is unknown. Because of the cost of the vaccine, understanding the significance of this\npathogen is crucial prior to introducing the new vaccine.\n\n38. While  access  to  allopathic  services  is  relatively  high,  access  to  traditional  medical\nservices  is  currently  limited  by  the  lack  of  indigenous  units  in  six  district  hospitals.  Improving\naccess to traditional medical services promotes social inclusion; those preferring these services\ntend to be the poorer, older and more rural sectors of the population. Also, timely referral and\nconsultations  are  critical  to  providing  quality  care  including  access  to  higher  level  professional\ncare.  However,  in  Bhutan,  equitable  access  to  specialist  services  is  restricted  by  the  difficult\nterrain  and  poor  transport  system.  Telecommunications  and  Internet  facilities  to  allow\nconsultation between the peripheral facility and the national referral hospital should be pursued\nto  benefit  vulnerable  groups,  including  the  less  mobile,  old,  rural  population,  women,  and\nchildren.\n\n6. \n\nOther Emerging Challenges\n\n39.\nThe  National  STD/AIDS  program  was  introduced  in  1988.  Alert  to  the  threat  of  AIDS,\ndespite the absence of known cases in the country, Bhutan developed its first medium-term plan\nin  1990,  with  a  second  plan  in  1995.  By  the  end  of  1998,  there  were  only  nine  known  HIV-\n\n6 PHC,  the  first  level  of  health  care  for  a  community,  generally  includes  preventive  services,  health  education  and\npromotion, reproductive health services, efforts to improve nutrition, and basic curative care such as treatment for\ndiarrhea, acute respiratory tract infection, and tuberculosis. The World Health Organization also considers the first-\nlevel referral hospital as part of the primary health care system.\n\n\f10\n\npositive cases, all but one were contracted outside of the country and four had died. Although\nthe incidence of HIV/AIDS has remained relatively low, many of the prerequisite conditions for\nthe  introduction  and  spread  of  the  disease  are  in  evidence.  There  are  a  number  of  factors\nsuggesting that the potential for spread is significant: (i) Bhutan is surrounded by countries that\nare experiencing an alarming spread of AIDS, and there is significant human traffic through its\nporous  borders,  (ii)  STD  rates  are  at  least  7  percent;  much  of  this  is  in  the  adolescent  age\ngroup, (iii) there is relatively low awareness of AIDS in the general population, (iv) commercial\nsex workers and intravenous drug users appear to be increasing in number.\n\n40.\nGiven the potential for a rapid spread in Bhutan now that the virus has been introduced,\nthe Government is implementing an aggressive prevention and control program. However, the\nHIV/AIDS  surveillance  system,  a  crucial  component  of  any  control  program  is  weak,  and  the\nmultisectoral task force, which oversees the effort has been relatively inactive.\n\n41.\nIn addition to the rate of growth, aging of the population will have a significant impact on\nthe demand for health services and the type of health services required. As the population ages\nand  economic  development  continues,  there  will  be  a  shift  from  a  pattern  of  predominantly\ninfectious diseases to a pattern of chronic degenerative diseases. This shift will be exacerbated\nby shifts in social and economic patterns, which will likely result in dietary changes, increased\nconsumption of alcohol and tobacco, and decreased physical activity. Chronic diseases such as\ncancer,  diabetes,  heart  and  lung  disease,  stroke,  and  cirrhosis  will  therefore  become  more\nprevalent with time. A recent report of the JDWNRH noted that 125 of the 545 patients sent for\nout-of-country  treatment  during  the  financial  year  1998/1999  were  cancer  patients.  Cervical\ncancer, the most common cancer among women in Bhutan, accounted for 7 percent of out-of-\ncountry  referrals  in  1998.  Thus,  Bhutan  is  faced  with  the  dual  challenges  of  overcoming  the\nresidual  burden  of  communicable  diseases  and  the  growing  burden  of  noncommunicable\ndiseases, with its relatively limited financial resources.\n\nC.\n\nGovernment Objectives and Strategy\n\n42.\nDuring the Eighth Plan, the Government accords high priority to improving health care,\nwhich  is  seen  as  the  key  to  promoting  the  country\u2019s  social  and  economic  development.\nSpecifically,  the  Government  aims  to  (i)  intensify  population  planning  activities,  (ii) consolidate\nand strengthen existing health infrastructure, (iii) promote self-reliance and sustainability in the\nhealth  sector,  (iv)  strengthen  human  resource  development  for  effective  implementation  of\nhealth  services,  (v)  enhance  the  quality  of  health  care  services,  and  (vi) extend  health  care\nservices  to  unreached  areas.  The  midterm  review  of  the  health  sector  during  the  Eighth  Plan\nrecommended that the Government continue its efforts to develop additional sources of health\nfinancing, address the acute shortage of specialist doctors and technicians, and strengthen the\ncurative  and  diagnostic  capacity  for  timely  treatment  following  the  significant  achievements  in\npreventive  care.  As  the  physical  expansion  of  health  infrastructure  is  consolidated,  the\nGovernment is emphasizing improvements in the quality of health care.\n\n43.\nThe  Government\u2019s  long-term  vision  of  a  Bhutan  with  gross  national  happiness  as  the\nultimate  objective  is  articulated  in  the  document, Bhutan 2020, A Vision for Peace, Prosperity\nand Happiness. Within this vision, the Government is committed to establishing a relevant and\ncost-effective  health  care  delivery  system  based  on  the  PHC  approach,  which  effectively\ndelivers  health  care  services  to  all.  While  constant  efforts  will  be  made  to  deliver  free  health\ncare services on a cost-effective basis, the possibility of introducing some kind of cost-sharing\nwill be explored. The integrated PHC system will continue, with aspects of traditional medicine\ncomplementary to formal health care phased into the system. The establishment of innovative\n\n\f11\n\nsources  of  health  financing,  including  the  proposed  BHTF  is  seen  as  a  strategic  approach  to\nensuring sustainable financing of the Government\u2019s vaccinations and essential drugs program.\nTraining  to  ensure  adequate  Bhutanese  personnel  are  available  to  staff  the  health  system  is\ngiven  high  priority.  The  Government  highlights  population  growth  as  one  of  its  greatest\nchallenges; the centerpiece of its policies to address this challenge is reproductive health care,\nincluding family planning.\n\nD.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n44.\nExternal assistance to the health sector is primarily provided by Denmark, India, United\nNations  Population  Fund  (UNFPA),  UNICEF,  and  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)\n(Appendix  4).  Under  the  current  five-year  plan,  Denmark,  through  the  Danish  International\nDevelopment  Agency,  supports  human  resource  development,  infrastructure  development,\nhealth  systems  management  (support  to  planning,  the  HMIS,  epidemiology  and  research,\ndistrict management, and the framework for multisectoral collaboration), strengthening of health\nservices  (public  health  programs,  maintenance,  and  logistics),  information,  education  and\ncommunication, and community participation. Extrabudgetary support is provided in the form of\nthree health advisers and funding of postgraduate training.\n\n45.\nIndia provides important assistance to the health sector. Its major contributions include\nfunding  for  the  National  Hospital  Program,  particularly  the  construction  and  expansion  of\nJDWNRH, and the Mongar, Trashi Yangtse and Lhuentse hospitals. India provides funding for\nthe National Malaria Control Program. Off-budget funding consists of assistance to its hospitals,\nand the financing and running of the India Bhutan Friendship Hospital. In addition India finances\nundergraduate training through RCSC in the fields of medicine, nursing, and dentistry.\n\n46.\nUNICEF,  UNFPA,  and  WHO  support  is  largely  directed  to  public  health  programs.\nUNICEF contributes for the construction and strengthening of ORCs, the EPI, safe motherhood,\nnutrition, diarrheal disease and ARI control, the VHW program and preservice training of PHC\nstaff.  UNFPA  has  cofinanced  the  reproductive  health  program  and  the  information,  education\nand  communication  for  health  program.  Although  providing  less  than  10  percent  of  total\nfinancing in the health sector, WHO\u2019s support is wide ranging and covers the areas of nutrition,\nreproductive  health,  communicable  diseases,  mental  health,  community-based\nEPI, \nrehabilitation,  human  resource  development,  health  promotion,  essential  drugs,  and  quality\nassurance.\n\nSupport from the Japan International Cooperation Agency is provided in kind in the form\n47.\nof  equipment  and  vaccines.  It  contributes  between  $100,000  and  $120,000  worth  of  vaccines\nand  cold  chain  equipment  to  the  health  sector,  through  UNICEF,  each  year.  The  European\nUnion  has  also  contributed  to  the  development  and  improvement  of  quality  assurance  for\ntraditional  and  indigenous  medicine.  The  German-Bhutan  Hospital  Foundation  financed  the\nconstruction of the Punakha District Hospital and continues to provide TA through an expatriate\nphysician.\n\nConsultations were held with major aid agencies at various stages of processing of the\n48.\nProgram,  and  information  obtained,  especially  on  lessons  learned,  was  used  to  design  the\nProgram\u2019s  policy  agenda.  Consequently,  the  proposed  loan  will  complement  assistance\nprovided  by  other  major  aid  agencies,  and  help  provide  an  enabling  policy  environment  to\nenhance  the  effectiveness  of  the  various  health  programs  that  are  being  assisted  by  these\nagencies.\n\n\f12\n\nE.\n\nADB\u2019s Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n\n1.\n\nStrategy\n\ninclusiveness \n\nThe  country  operational  strategy  aims  to  support  poverty  reduction  in  Bhutan  by\n49.\npromoting  economic  growth  and  social \nin  human\ndevelopment.  Therefore,  the  main  thrust  of  poverty  reduction  efforts  under  the  strategy  is  to\nenable the Government\u2019s commitment to be realized under the strategic theme of improving the\nquality  of  life  for  all.  An  important  element  is  to  help  the  Government  create  a  more  enabling\nenvironment  to  encourage  and  support  private  sector-led  development.  Within  this  framework,\nspecific ADB interventions will address constraints in physical infrastructure, particularly in road\ntransport  and  rural  energy,  financial  intermediation,  and  human  development  including  the\nshortage of skilled human resources.\n\ninvestments \n\nthrough \n\n50.\nInvestments in human development will be accompanied by policy support and capacity-\nbuilding activities to strengthen the Government\u2019s capacity to expand the scope and quality of\ntraditional social services in line with the demands of an evolving economy. ADB\u2019s strategy also\nrecognizes the need for the Government to strengthen its financial capacity to sustain its social\nsector  programs.  In  the  health  sector,  there  is  a  need  to  put  the  long-term  financing  of  health\nservices  on  a  sustainable  footing  and  to  improve  the  quality  of  health  care  as  well  as  the\nefficiency  with  which  such  health  care  is  provided.  The  proposed  ADB  loan  will  support  the\nintroduction  of  crucial  sector  reforms  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  the  country\u2019s  health\nprograms  and  strengthen  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  address  emerging  challenges  and\nissues in the health sector. By facilitating the development of alternative approaches to ensure\nsustainable financing in the health sector, the Program will contribute to improved governance,\nparticularly  in  domestic  resource  mobilization,  and  ultimately  contribute  to  overall  poverty\nreduction  efforts.  More  focused  targeting  of  beneficiaries  will  be  facilitated  by  the  poverty\nassessment study to be jointly conducted by the Government and ADB in 2000.\n\n2.\n\nHealth Policy\n\n51.\nADB\u2019s  overall  approach  to  the  health  sector  is  to  assist  its  DMCs  ensure  their  citizens\nhave  broad  access  to  basic  preventive,  promotive,  and  curative  services  that  are  efficacious,\ncost-effective,  and  affordable.  Drawing  upon  previous  ADB  interventions  in  the  health  sector\nand  empirical  evidence  from  recent  research  and  observations,  the  strategy  will  focus  on\n(i) improving  the  health  status  of  vulnerable  groups,  including  the  poor,  women,  children,  and\nindigenous  peoples  with  an  emphasis  on  PHC;  (ii) investing  in  projects  and  programs  with\ntangible  and  measurable  results;  (iii)  supporting  innovative  approaches,  including  new\napproaches  to  health  care  financing  and  deployment  of  new  technologies;  (iv)  encouraging\nDMC  governments  to  take  an  appropriate  and  activist  role  in  the  health  sector  through  much-\nneeded structural reforms; and (v) increasing the efficiency of health sector investments through\ncapacity-building, economic and sector work, and improved intersectoral linkages.\n\n52.\nStrong Government commitment and ownership are key to successful implementation of\nstructural reforms in the health sector. Pilot studies should be conducted to assess the impact of\nsuch  user  charges  on  vulnerable  groups.  The  effective  delivery  of  health  programs  can  be\nenhanced  through  more  efficient  planning  and  the  use  of  monitoring  systems  that  can  track\nperformance  targets.  New  institutional  mechanisms  for  quality  assurance  and  improved\nmanagement  information  systems  are  also  critical  for  strengthening  management  capacity  at\nthe central level, particularly when health services are decentralized.\n\n\f13\n\nADB still has limited experience in the use of a trust fund approach as a mechanism for\n53.\nensuring  sustainable  financing  of  social  development  projects.7  However,  trust  fund  approach\nwas used to establish the Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation (BTFEC) in 1992;\nthis was supported by a grant from the Global Environmental Fund and supervised by the World\nBank.  The  BTFEC  was  rated  as  satisfactory  in  the  Implementation  Completion  Report  of  the\nWorld  Bank.  Key  lessons  learned  from  BTFEC  implementation  confirmed  that  the  successful\nevolution  of  the  trust  fund  would  depend  on  (i)  the  existence  of  a  legal  framework  to\ninstitutionalize  collaboration  between  financiers  and  recipients,  and  make  management\naccountable  and  implementation  more  transparent;  (ii)  multistakeholder  or  aid  participation;\n(iii) adequate start-up funding separate from investment income; (iv) relevant expertise in trust\nfund  management;  and  (v)  the  recipient  government\u2019s  strong  reputation  for  integrity  in\ngovernance and demonstrated commitment to the program. Such lessons from the BTFEC have\nbeen  used  by  the  Government  to  prepare  the  BHTF  as  an  innovative  sustainable  financing\nfacility.\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nV.\n\nTHE PROGRAM\n\nBhutan,  a  small  landlocked  country,  is  characterized  by  its  mountainous  terrain,  high\n54.\npopulation  growth  rate  and  limited  pool  of  skilled  human  resources,  and  economy  that  is  still\nbasically agricultural despite signs of industrial growth and diversification.  The Government has\nalways accorded high priority to human development and has achieved remarkable progress in\nimproving  the  country\u2019s  social  indicators,  particularly  in  education  and  health.  Investments  in\nhuman  development  will  however  remain  critical  to  (i) improving  the  social  well-being  of  its\npredominantly rural population, which is widely dispersed across the country; and (ii) providing\nthe  much-needed  human  capital  to  support  a  growing  economy.  When  viewed  in  this  context,\nthe development of a healthy population provides the key to the country\u2019s sustained economic\ngrowth and poverty reduction efforts.\n\n55. With human development serving as the primary objective of its development strategy,\nthe Government is seeking to ensure continued progress in improving the health status of the\npopulation.  The  Government  recognizes  the  need  to  develop  (i)  a  comprehensive  policy\nframework  to  address  structural  weaknesses  in  the  health  sector,  and  (ii)  a  more  forward-\nlooking blueprint to tackle new challenges and demands expected to emerge from the evolving\neconomy.  Specifically,  the  reform  agenda  is  aimed  at  enhancing  efficiency  in  resource\nallocation;  ensuring  equitable  access  to  PHC  services;  and  strengthening  the  planning  and\nmanagement capacity, and regulatory framework for the health sector.\n\nSustainability  of  health  sector  financing  is  a  key  feature  of  the  Program;  other  sectors\n56.\nare bound to claim an increasing share of the Government budget as the economy expands and\nthe  population  continues  to  grow  rapidly.  It  is  inevitable  that  the  Government  must  explore\ninnovative and sustainable ways of financing a potential resource gap in the health sector and to\nhelp reduce dependence on external assistance. In addition, the Government must protect and\nstrengthen  its  core  health  program  to  address  PHC  needs  of  vulnerable  groups,  particularly\nwomen  and  children.  Thus,  in  this  connection,  the  Government  is  setting  up  the  BHTF  as  a\nsustainable  financing  mechanism  to  meet  the  requirements  of  vaccines  and  essential  drugs,\n\n7 The  trust  fund  approach  is  used  in  Loan  1693-TUV: Island Development Program,  for  $4  million,  approved  on\n\n13 July 1999.\n\n\f14\n\nwhich  are  key  components  of  PHC.  By  incorporating  policy  initiatives  that  will  ensure  a  more\nfocused  approach  in  addressing  equity  aspects  and  targeting  specific  vulnerable  groups,  the\nProgram  will  strengthen  the  partnership  between  the  Government  and  ADB  on  poverty\nreduction.\n\n57.\nThe  Health  Care  Reform  Program  encompasses  major  policy  measures  that  will\ncollectively promote a more enabling environment for the Government to pursue its ongoing and\nfuture  health  programs.  The  Program  was  designed  in  consultation  with  other  major  aid\nagencies,  and  its  implementation  is  expected  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  their  various\nhealth programs. ADB\u2019s timely intervention through the proposed program loan has already laid\nthe groundwork for institutionalizing a more coordinated approach among aid agencies, which at\npresent  rely  on  an  informal  monthly  luncheon  meeting  for  networking  to  coordinate  their\nactivities.8  With  its  sectorwide  coverage  and  inputs  from  other  aid  agencies,  the  Program  has\ninitiated  the  process  for  advancing  a  more  structured  and  coordinated  approach  among  aid\nagencies  for  addressing  health  sector  issues,  which  are  expected  to  become  more  complex\nover time in view of changing social, cultural, and economic circumstances.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n58.\nThe  principal  objective  of  the  Program  is  to  provide  support  for  the  Government\u2019s\ncomprehensive reform agenda for strengthening the health sector. Its scope includes five policy\npriority areas: (i) develop sustainable financing for the health sector; (ii) strengthen capacity in\nhealth  sector  management;  (iii)  strengthen  quality  assurance  and  public  health  regulatory\nfunctions; (iv) adjust imbalances in human resources for health; and (v) strengthen PHC through\nselective  PHC  interventions  and  expansion  of  priority  services.  The  Government\u2019s  intention  to\nimplement the Program is summarized in the development policy letter (DPL), as presented in\nAppendix  5.  Discussions  were  held  between  the  Government  and  the  ADB  on  the  various\nspecific policy reform measures that will be implemented as part of the Program. These policy\nactions,  together  with  the  indicative  timing  of  their  implementation  are  highlighted  in  the\nsupporting policy matrix attached to the DPL in Appendix 5.\n\nC.\n\nPolicy Framework and Actions\n\n59.\nThe  policy  framework  and  its  specific  actions  included  in  the  Program  was  designed\nthrough  a  participatory  process  that  involved  field  surveys,  focus  group  discussions,  and\nconsultations with other stakeholders, including the major aid agencies for the health sector in\nBhutan.  As  a  result,  the  reforms  and  specific  policy  initiatives  detailed  in  the  policy  matrix  are\nconsistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  own  development  objective,  and  will  complement  the  health\nprograms  of  the  international  aid  community  in  Bhutan.  In  formulating  the  Program,  particular\nattention was paid to equity and gender issues, and to the needs of specific vulnerable groups.\nA  multisectoral  approach  was  used  to  identify  and  develop  some  of  the  intended  policy\nmeasures, in view of the linkages between sectors and their impact on health.\n\n8 The current practice has proved to be inadequate for coordinating the various discrete programs of the different aid\nagencies as it falls short of addressing Bhutan\u2019s health sector issues on a sectorwide or systemwide basis. This\nshortcoming in aid coordination is highlighted in Report on the Evaluation of Danish Support to the Health Sector in\nBhutan 1990-1998 by Danish International Development Agency.\n\n\f15\n\n1. \n\nDevelop Sustainable Financing for the Health Sector\n\n60.\nThe  high  population  growth  rate,  competing  global  and  domestic  demands  for  funding,\nan economy in transition, and rising costs in the provision of social services, including health are\nchallenging the capacity of Bhutan to continue to provide free health and other medical services\nto its citizens. The Government is aware that the lack of sustainable financing would derail its\nvarious  health  programs  and  undermine  the  quality  of  health  care  in  the  country.  In  this\nconnection, it is adopting a two-pronged strategy to develop alternative sources of financing and\nimprove efficiency of resource use including cost containment.\n\n61.\nBhutan\u2019s current stage of economic development does not make privatization of health\ncare  delivery  feasible  given  its  limited  and  nascent  private  sector.  The  Government  remains\ncommitted to make free health care accessible to all segments of society, and is responsible for\nthe  training  of  health  workers.  However,  the  Government  expects  a  wider  scope  for  private\nfinancing  of  health  care  to  promote  sustainable  financing  and  to  encourage  rational  use  of\nhealth  services.  It  intends  to  introduce  more  user  fees.  As  part  of  the  Program,  surveys  on\nhousehold  health  care  expenditure  and  attitudes  user  payment  will  be  conducted,  and\nconsultations with stakeholders on health services will be held initially to determine the scope of\nhealth services to be deemed essential services. The findings of these surveys will be used as\nthe basis for designing a pilot study that will assess the feasibility of introducing user charges in\na phased manner, while ensuring that there will be no impact on access to such essential health\nservices (including those under traditional health care services) identified by the surveys. Based\non the information from this study, a user charge policy including a proposed fee structure will\nbe drawn up for public discussions prior to its implementation in the Ninth Five-Year Plan or the\nNinth  Plan  (FY2003-FY2007).  This  will  include  the  clear  identification  of  services  that  will  be\nsubject  to  user  charges;  their  respective  prices  (based  on  a  combination  of  analyses  of  cost,\nand willingness and ability to pay); and, individuals or groups, who are to be exempt (partially or\nfully)  from  paying  charges.  In  addition,  the  study  will  provide  an  assessment  of  the  potential\nrevenues,  the  impact  on  the  behavior  of  those  seeking  health  care,  and  the  capacity  to\nimplement the scheme.\n\n62.\nThe  Program  will  also  explore  the  possibility  of  introducing  some  market  mechanisms\nwithin the publicly financed system to secure additional efficiency gains. One option is to assess\nthe  feasibility  of  contracting  health-related  services  to  the  private  sector.  This  will  involve  a\nmarket  analysis  for  the  private  sector  of  ancillary,  pharmaceutical,  and  other  medical-related\nservices to assess their ability to carry out services for the Government under contract, and will\ninclude a close examination of capacity, licensing, regulation, and incentive structures.\n\n63.\nThe Program will also assist the Government in mobilizing additional resources through\ninnovative  financing  mechanisms  for  the  health  sector.  The  Government  recently  established\nthe BHTF on the basis of a Royal Charter (Appendix 6). The trust fund mechanism for the health\nsector was conceived with technical advice from WHO, following the Government\u2019s experience\nwith the successful BTFEC, which was launched in 1992 with multi-donor funding support and\nTA  from  several  external  sources.  The  BHTF  will  be  developed  as  a  sustainable  financing\nmechanism  that  is  expected  to  generate  funds  to  cover  the  annual  expenditures  on  essential\ndrugs,  vaccines,  and  new  technologies,  which  are  expected  to  increase  from  $0.9  million  in\n1999  to  $2.3  million  in  2008  (Appendix  7).  The  Government  has  given  its  assurance  that  the\nBHTF  will  adopt  internationally  acceptable  practices  in  fund  administration  and  investment\nmanagement.\n\n\f16\n\nIn  addition,  the  Government  will  adopt  specific  policy  initiatives  to  improve  allocative\n64.\nefficiency  and  contain  costs,  while  ensuring  equity  in  the  provision  of  health  services.  Initially,\nthe Government will adopt a policy advocating the use of poverty incidence as one of the criteria\nfor  resource  allocation  to  ensure  equity  in  public  financing  of  health  services.  The  poverty\nindicators  and  other  data  to  be  generated  by  a  new  HMIS  and  the  findings  of  the  joint\nGovernment  and  ADB  poverty  assessment  exercise  will  then  be  used  to  allocate  health\nresources  during  the  Ninth  Plan.  To  meet  future  challenges,  a  situation  analysis  of  chronic\ndegenerative  diseases  will  be  conducted  in  2001  to  gain  an  understanding  of  their  financial\nimplications for the health budget. A study of the projected need for and cost implications of out-\nof-country training and medical treatment will also be carried out in 2001.\n\n65.\nThe  Government  will  also  improve  its  financial  and  budgeting  procedures  to  address\ninefficient  use  of  resources  in  the  health  sector.  This  will  involve  the  use  of  recurrent  cost\nanalysis on major capital investment as a standard planning tool in the health sector to facilitate\npriority setting and decision making on the basis of cost-effectiveness.\n\n2.\n\nStrengthen Capacity in Health Sector Management\n\n66.\nThe Government\u2019s capacity to effectively manage, plan, and monitor its multiple health\nprograms  under  a  decentralized  system  has  been  constrained  by  shortage  of  staff  to  conduct\nresearch  and  by  the  deficiencies  in  its  management  information  system.  To  overcome  these\nshortcomings,  capacity-building  efforts  will  be  carried  out  through  the  introduction  of  a\ncomprehensive  strategic  planning  framework  for  relevant  health  programs.  For  instance,  the\nGovernment has already taken steps to assess the relevance of integrating separately managed\nhealth  programs  on  ARI  and  control  of  diarrheal  diseases  under  the  purview  of  a  program  for\nintegrated  management  of  childhood  illness.  In  addition,  the  Government  has  developed  a\nrestructuring  plan  to  strengthen  MOHE\u2019s  PPD  through  the  proposed  creation  of  a  new\nmonitoring and evaluation section. This will follow the restructuring of MOHE into two separate\nministries in 2002. However, as part of the Program, the process of recruiting qualified staff will\nbe  started  as  soon  as  possible  to  ensure  that  such  staff  will  be  available  in  a  timely  manner\nunder  the  country\u2019s  civil  service  system.  The  proposed  monitoring  and  evaluation  section  is\nexpected to play an important role in ensuring that the data and other reports submitted by the\ndistrict and village health offices are consistent and discrepancies are minimized.\n\n67. While current MOHE plans have measurable, time-based indicators, there is difficulty in\ntracking them due to deficiencies within the HMIS. Hence, the Program seeks to address these\nproblems  to  make  more  reliable,  useful,  and  timely  information  available.  The  Government  is\ncurrently  reviewing  the  HMIS  with  the  assistance  of  the  Government  of  Denmark  and  it  is\nexpected  that  an  upgraded  HMIS  will  be  installed  by  2001.  This  improved  HMIS  will  help\n(i) identify program beneficiaries more clearly and (ii) design appropriate programs to meet their\nneeds. With an upgraded HMIS, the Government will be able to ensure that its existing health\ninfrastructure will continue to serve a catchment area of an appropriate population size.\n\n68.\nPast  capital  investments  have  resulted  in  a  broad  network  of  hospitals  and  BHUs.\nHowever, little attention was paid to developing a maintenance program to support the existing\nhealth infrastructure. The Program will develop a routine inspection and maintenance program\nfor  health  facilities.  This  policy  initiative  is  particularly  important  as  the  Government  moves  to\nconsolidate  its  capital  investment  program;  promote  a  more  rational  use  of  health  facilities,\nincluding  the  referral  system;  and  contain  overall  costs.  The  maintenance  program  should  be\nincorporated  as  part  of  the  new  financial  management  and  planning  procedures  that  will  be\n\n\f17\n\nadopted \naccountability.\n\nto  enhance  management  efficiency,  and  promote  greater \n\ntransparency  and\n\n3.\n\nStrengthen Quality Assurance and Public Health Regulatory Functions\n\n69.\nUntil recently, the organizational structure of MOHE did not include a central or focal unit\nthat  is  responsible  for  ensuring  the  quality  of  health  care  services  and  the  management  of\nprograms  and  activities.  Under  the  Program,  the  Government,  on  the  basis  of  a  review  of  its\nmanagement approach, created a quality assurance focal point within MOHE that will have the\nmandate  to  promote  a  shift  to  more  results-based  management.  One  of  the  key  tasks  of  this\nquality assurance center is to introduce the logistics system for the proper inventory of essential\ndrugs to monitor their availability, and usage, and expiration date.\n\n70.\nRegulatory function, an essential component of public health systems, remains relatively\nundeveloped  in  Bhutan  and  hence  needs  to  be  strengthened.  As  part  of  the  Program,  a  focal\npoint  was  recently  established  within  MOHE  to  assume  responsibility  for  coordinating  public\nhealth  regulation.  This  focal  point  will  (i)  ensure  that  health  sector  input  is  obtained  in  the\ndrafting  of  legislation  and  regulations  related  to  health,  and  enforcement  of  legislation  is\nstrengthened;  and  (ii)  be  responsible  for  disseminating  all  appropriate  public  health  legal\ninstruments. To achieve this task, a central repository was recently set up to compile, catalogue,\nand update all existing and future legal instruments with a bearing on the health sector.\n\n71.\nThe  creation  of  focal  points  for  quality  assurance  and  public  health  regulations  will\nenable MOHE to draft important laws and regulations for public health in a more timely manner.\nIt will also help ensure that relevant health inputs are incorporated in other important legislation\ndrafted for other sectors such as industry. For instance, the lack of a focal point has hampered\nthe  legislation  for  creating  a  professional  body  for  accrediting  and  regulating  the  health\nprofession  with  a  goal  of  raising  professional  standards  and  enforcing  professional  codes  of\nethics. In this connection, the Program will facilitate the drafting of the legislation for the creation\nof the Bhutan medical and health council for approval by the Council of Ministers in 2001. The\nGovernment will also complete a situation analysis on the health-related and safety issues in the\nindustry and business sectors in 2001. This study will serve as the basis for future legislation for\nan  Occupational  Health  and  Safety  Act  in  the  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan,  and  contribute  to  the\ndevelopment  of  the  legal  framework  that  is  needed  in  line  with  economic  growth  and\ndiversification.\n\nSpecific regulations to regulate the marketing of breast-milk substitutes, and for tobacco,\n72.\nand  alcohol  control  will  also be put  in place. Currently, the Government itself has not enacted\nany stringent regulation on the control of tobacco, and alcohol sales in the country, except for\nsubjecting  such  imports  (except  those  from  India)  to  the  maximum  duty  and  sales  tax  rates.\nHowever,  many  districts  and  villages,  on  their  own  initiative,  have  banned  the  sale  of  tobacco\nand discouraged its use in line with Buddhist religious belief. These regulations are expected to\npromote  healthier  lifestyles  and  will  complement  the  Government\u2019s  continuing  use  of\nappropriate taxation policies to reduce the consumption of tobacco and alcohol, and to promote\npublic health.\n\n73.\nEnvironmental  health  will  also  be  strengthened  through  the  Program.  Residents,\nparticularly children, living close to health facilities, are exposed to health hazards arising from\nthe disposal of hospital waste. The Government will strictly enforce an improved system for the\nproper  disposal  of  medical  waste  in  hospitals  and  other  health  facilities.  Environmental\n\n\f18\n\nguidelines for urban and community development projects will also be adopted to contain their\nadverse developmental impact on health.\n\n4.\n\nAdjust Imbalances in Human Resources for Health\n\n74.\nOne of the major limitations to the provision of adequate health services in Bhutan has\nbeen the lack of sufficient health workers of all categories. The Government has exerted efforts\nto train more Bhutanese nationals to staff the various categories, including specialist positions\nthat are currently filled by expatriates. The Government recently carried out a review of gender\nequity  to  address  the  concerns  of  female  health  staff  and  patients.  The  Government  will  also\nencourage community participation in the delivery of basic health services by optimizing the role\nof village health workers, who have made significant contributions.\n\n75.\nA major undertaking to adjust imbalances in human resources for health is to revise and\nupdate the current Master Plan for Human Resources in Health (MPHRH) to reflect current and\nprojected personnel requirements in various disciplines, grade levels, and geographic areas. An\nupdated MPHRH will also address personnel issues more effectively, as personnel are the key\ncomponent  of  health  expenditures.  RCSC  also  uses  the  MPHRH  for  planning  investments  in\nout-of-country  education;  thus  the  MPHRH  needs  to  present  a  more  accurate  assessment  of\nhealth personnel requirements to ensure that resources are efficiently used. In this connection,\nthe  MPHRH  will  be  reviewed  and  updated.  The  Government  will  also  adopt  a  policy  to  help\nensure that all BHUs include female staff who can provide services to female patients. Female\nstaffing  in  health  units  is  particularly  critical  to  address  the  high  maternal  mortality  rate  in\nBhutan.\n\n5. \n\nStrengthen  PHC  Through  Selective  Interventions  and  Expanding  Priority\nServices\n\nTo demonstrate its continuing commitment to PHC, the Government will adopt policies to\n76.\nstrengthen  PHC  through  selective  interventions  and  expanding  priority  services  to  benefit\nvulnerable  groups  and  underserved  areas.  The  Government  has  reactivated  the  Multisectoral\nTask  Force  on  STD/HIV  issues,  which  has  not  met  since  its  establishment  in  1998.  This  will\nensure  its  active  participation  in  promoting  political  and  social  awareness  on  such  issues  and\nhelp strengthen the HIV/AIDS surveillance system. Additional resources will also be committed\nto intensify information, education and communication activities on substance abuse, including\nalcohol, \ninvolvement,\ncollaboration  with  the  media,  and  development  of  health  promotion  materials  for  wider\ndissemination to target groups.\n\ntobacco,  and  betel  nut.  This  will \n\nincreased  community \n\ninvolve \n\nTo  ensure  effective  delivery  of  PHC, \n\n77.\nthe  Government  will  maintain  recurrent\nexpenditures,  as  a  percentage  share  of  total  health  sector  budget,  at  or  above  the  level  of\n1998/99 during the Program period. Within the total health recurrent expenditures, the share of\nrecurrent  budget  allocated  to  PHC  will  not  be  allowed  to  fall  below  50  percent  to  facilitate  the\nimplementation and expansion of selected PHC interventions, such as (i) increasing the number\nof  hospitals  providing  comprehensive  reproductive  health  services,  including  emergency\nobstetrical  care  and  clinical  family  planning  in  underserved  areas  from  four  to  eight;  and  (ii)  a\ntelemedicine pilot project that links the Mongar District Hospital with the JDWNRH in Thimphu.\n\nIn addition, the expanded immunization program may need to be strengthened. As part\n78.\nof  the  Program,  the  Government  will  carry  out  a  study  to  determine  the  importance  of\nHaemophilus influenza b in the epidemiology of acute respiratory tract infections. In recognition\n\n\f19\n\nof  the  cultural  aspects  of  traditional  medicine  in  Bhutan,  six  more  indigenous  units  will  be\nestablished  so  that  all  district  hospitals  will  have  such  units  by  2002.  This  is  in  line  with  the\npolicy  objective  to  provide  traditional  health  care  to  segments  of  society  seeking  this  health\ncare.\n\nD.\n\nSocial and Environmental Issues\n\n79.\nThe Program will support the Government to continue its PHC program, which has the\npoor,  women,  and  children  as  major  beneficiaries.  A  considerable  emphasis  on  provision  of\nservices to these vulnerable groups is demonstrated through the Government\u2019s commitment to\nmaintain the share of recurrent expenditures on PHC at about 50 percent of total health sector\nrecurrent  expenditures.  The  commitment  of  the  Government  to  develop  the  traditional  health\ncare  system  as  part  of  publicly  provided  services  shows  their  concern  to  meet  the  perceived\nneeds and demands of the population. The Program will ensure that Government commitment\nto both PHC and traditional health care will continue.\n\nThe  Program  includes  reform  measures  that  will  improve  resource  allocation,  while\n80.\nefficiency gains derived from the reforms will free up resources to address increasing access to\nservices  in  unserved  areas,  and  unmet  demands  for  health  care  such  as  maternal  and  child\nhealth care. Appropriate policy measures through budgetary allocation have been incorporated\nto ensure that any negative impact on the poor will only have a short-term effect of the reform\nprocess. The policy reform to strengthen human resources will ensure gender equity in training\nand  career  opportunities.  This  policy  will  lead  to  an  increase  in  the  number  of  female  health\nworkers,  help  break  down  barriers  to  women\u2019s  access  to  health  care,  and  thus  improve  the\nhealth status of women and children. The emphasis on reproductive health services, including\nthe establishment of more emergency obstetrical care facilities at district hospitals, will reduce\nmaternal mortality.\n\nThe  Program  will  also  yield  positive  environmental  benefits.  As  part  of  the  Program,\n81.\nenvironmental codes of practice will be developed to improve urban sanitation and solid waste\nmanagement, including medical waste from hospitals and health facilities. The Government will\nstrictly  enforce  regulations  covering  the  proper  disposal  and  treatment  of  medical  waste.  The\nincorporation  of  environmental  health  aspects  in  the  preparation  of  urban  development\nguidelines will lead to improved environmental quality.\n\nA. \n\nAmount of Loan and Source of Funds\n\nVI.\n\nTHE PROPOSED LOAN\n\nThe  Government  has  requested  that  the  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  $10.0  million  from  its\n82.\nSpecial  Funds  resources.  The  cost  of  implementing  the  necessary  key  policies  and  reform\nmeasures is estimated at $10.0 million over five years (FY2001-FY2005), which will run through\nthe  first  half  of  the  Ninth  Plan  (FY2003-FY2007).  This  covers  mainly  the  development  of\nsustainable health sector financing mechanisms excluding the capitalization requirements of the\nBHTF;  budgetary  commitment  to  PHC;  capacity  building  for  health  sector  management,\nincluding  the  adoption  of  new  management  planning  tools  and  techniques;  capacity-building\nactivities  in  quality  assurance  and  public  health  regulations;  and  improved  human  resource\ndevelopment programs. The Government confirmed that the cost of the Program, to be incurred\nover  five  years,  will  not  seriously  impair  its  comfortable  fiscal  position,  where  prudent  fiscal\nmanagement has enabled the Government to keep the budget deficit at a minimum. Moreover,\n\n\f20\n\nsome  funds  have  already  been  set  aside  to  help  capitalize  the  BHTF,  while  revenues  from\nhydroelectric  projects  and  the  introduction  of  user  fees  for  nonessential  health  services  will\nsupport its sound fiscal position.\n\nB.\n\nInterest, Maturity, and Utilization Period\n\n83.\nThe proposed loan will have a repayment period of 24 years, including a grace period of\n8 years. An interest rate of 1 percent will be charged per annum during the grace period and 1.5\npercent per annum thereafter. The proposed loan is to be disbursed in two tranches. The first\ntranche of $5.0 million will be made available upon loan effectiveness, while the second tranche\nof $5.0 million will be made available following the Government\u2019s compliance with the conditions\nset  out  in  the  Loan  Agreement.  The  policy  matrix  in  Appendix  5  lists  the  conditions  for  the\nrelease of the two tranches.\n\nC.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\nMOHE will be the Executing Agency for the Program.9 MOHE will organize and chair an\n84.\ninterministerial  steering committee (ISC) with representation from other Government ministries\nand  offices  that  have  a  stake  in  the  policy  matrix.  These  will  include  the  Ministry  of  Finance,\nPlanning  Commission  Secretariat,  Ministry  of  Trade  and  Industry,  National  Environment\nCommission,  and  Royal  Civil  Service  Commission.  The  ISC  will  serve  as  a  coordinating  and\nmonitoring mechanism, provide policy oversight in program implementation, and meet not less\nthan  once  every  quarter  before  all  second  tranche  conditions  are  satisfied.  The  ISC  will  be\nsupported by a program management unit (PMU) to be established within MOHE. It was agreed\nthat a director will head the PMU as program director. The PMU will be responsible for the day-\nto-day monitoring of progress in meeting the policy actions required for the release of the two\ntranches.  The  PMU  will  prepare  program  implementation  progress  reports  for  the  ISC.  The\nprogress  reports  will  be  provided  to  ADB  on  a  quarterly  basis.  The  organizational  structure  of\nMOHE (Department of Health) is shown in Appendix 8.\n\nD.\n\nProcurement\n\nThe loan will finance the full foreign exchange costs, excluding local duties and taxes, of\n85.\nimports procured in and from ADB\u2019s member countries, other than those specified in the list of\nineligible  items  and  those  items  financed  by  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  official  sources.\nProcurement of eligible items under ADB\u2019s loan will be based on normal commercial practices\nfor  procurement  by  the  private  sector,  or  standard  Government  procurement  procedures\nacceptable to ADB for procurement by the public sector. In the case of goods commonly traded\non  international  commodity  markets,  procurement  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with\nprocedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB.\n\nE.\n\nDisbursement\n\n86.\nThe proceeds of the loan will be disbursed against a broad range of imports, subject to a\nnegative list of items, shown in Appendix 9. The loan will be disbursed until 30 September 2002\nand  can  be  used  to  finance  eligible  expenditures  incurred  up  to  180  days  prior  to  the  date  of\nloan  effectiveness.  On  the  basis  of  ADB\u2019s  simplified  procedures  for  the  disbursement  of\nprogram  loans,  the  Borrower  will  be  required  to  submit  with  each  withdrawal  request  a\n\n9 Under the Government restructuring plan, MOHE is expected to be restructured into the Ministry of Health and the\n\nMinistry of Education by 2002.\n\n\f21\n\ncertification  confirming  the  Borrower\u2019s  compliance  with  the  following  formula  for  the  period\ncovered by the withdrawal request: for each year in which the proceeds of the loan are expected\nto  be  disbursed,  the  value  of  the  country\u2019s  total  imports  minus  (i) imports  from  nonmember\ncountries,  (ii)  ineligible  imports,  and  (iii)  imports  financed  under  other  official  development\nassistance. This must be equal to or greater than the amounts expected to be disbursed during\nthe year. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy\nof the Borrower\u2019s certification.\n\nF.\n\nCounterpart Funds\n\n87.\nThe  Government  has  indicated  that  the  proceeds  of  the  proposed  loan  will  be  used  to\nhelp  meet  the  funding  requirements  of  the  BHTF.  The  Government  has  agreed  that  any  local\ncurrency proceeds generated by the proposed loan (counterpart funds) will be used to support\nthe development of the health sector in general and the reforms to be initiated or implemented\nunder the policy framework of the Program.\n\nG.\n\nMonitoring and Tranching\n\n88.\nThe proceeds of ADB\u2019s loan will be released in two tranches when ADB is assured that\nthe  conditions  for  their  release  are  satisfied.  As  the  Government  has  complied  with  the  initial\nactions designed as part of the Program, the first tranche of $5.0 million will be made available\nupon  loan  effectiveness.  It  is  envisaged  that  the  second  tranche  for  $5.0  million  will  be\ndisbursed about one year after the release of the first tranche, subject to the fulfillment by the\nGovernment of the specific conditions for its release, as detailed in the policy matrix, including\nsatisfactory progress in implementing the overall Program.\n\n89.\nProgram  implementation  will  be  monitored  closely  by  the  Government  by  the  ISC\nthrough its meetings and progress reports, and by ADB through its regular loan review missions.\nSpecific  performance  indicators,  based  on  existing  available  data,  have  been  developed  to\nassist with monitoring; these will be improved as soon as the findings of the April 2000 health\nsector  survey  are  compiled,  analyzed,  and  officially  released.  The  Government  has  agreed  to\nuse the annual health conference as part of the feedback mechanism for assessing the impact\nof the Program on beneficiary groups, including the poor. Poverty and other socioeconomic data\ngenerated by the Government-ADB poverty assessment study will be used to develop baseline\nindicators to monitor the poverty impact of the Program.\n\nA midterm review of the Program, including its impact on poverty and vulnerable groups,\n90.\nwill be carried out jointly by the Government and ADB in 2003. A program completion report will\nbe  prepared  by  the  Government  not  later  than  three  months  following  program  completion  in\n2005. The report will include an evaluation of the benefits of the Program based on the baseline\nindicators developed through the data generated by the April 2000 health sector survey and the\nGovernment-ADB poverty assessment study.\n\nVII.\n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS\n\nA.\n\nBenefits and Beneficiaries\n\nThe  Program  provides  a  long-term  strategic  vision  for  the  Government  to  improve  the\n91.\nhealth  status  of  the  Bhutanese  population  and  strengthen  its  capacity  to  cope  with  emerging\nchallenges  and  issues  in  the  health  sector  of  an  evolving  economy.  The  Program  focuses  on\n\n\f22\n\ndeveloping the software aspects of the health system in Bhutan to enhance the efficiency and\nquality  of  health  care.  This  will  complement  the  massive  capital  investment  program  that  has\nenabled  the  Government  to  provide  health  services  to  at  least  90  percent  of  the  population.\nConcurrently,  the  Program  accords  continued  emphasis  to  the  PHC  system,  as  it  covers  a\npackage of basic services that have been proven to provide significant benefits to the vulnerable\ngroups,  including  the  poor,  women,  and  children.  Investments  in  health  enhance  human  well-\nbeing,  and  will  generate  benefits  that  extend  to  increased  productivity,  increased  learning\ncapacity of school children, and increased efficiency in resource allocation; these free up limited\nresources  that  would  otherwise  be  used  for  the  more  costly  treatment  of  disease.  Adoption  of\nrecurrent  cost  analysis  and  improved  financial  management  and  reporting  procedures  will\ncontribute  to  overall  efficiency  in  health  expenditures.  The  Program  is  thus  justified  on  the\ngrounds of efficiency and equity.\n\n92.\nInstitutional  strengthening  is  another  major  benefit  that  will  be  generated  by  the\nProgram.  The  Program  will  accelerate  the  development  of  human  resources  needed  for  the\nmanagement and delivery of health services to the dispersed population. The Program will raise\nthe professional standards of health workers, strengthen the capacity to improve the quality of\nhealth  care,  and  introduce  a  more  efficient  way  to  target  beneficiaries  of  the  various  health\nprograms. The Program will effectively address concerns over the increasing cost of health care\nin  Bhutan.  The  Program  includes  specific  policy  measures  to  develop  more  sustainable  and\ninnovative mechanisms for health financing and to contain costs, which have been increasing at\nan alarming rate and threaten the Government\u2019s capacity to ensure adequate resources for its\nhealth programs.\n\nThe  Program  also  directly  supports  the  development  of  a  policy  and  regulatory\n93.\nframework  to  strengthen  public  health  and  promote  healthy  behavior.  This  will  help  the\nGovernment  reduce  the  burden  of  disease  through  more  public  regulations  and  an  intensified\ninformation campaign aimed at reducing substance abuse (e.g., tobacco and alcohol) and use\nof  betel  nut,  promoting  breast-feeding,  and  preventing  the  spread  of  STD/HIV.  Influencing\npeople\u2019s choice of healthy behavior would have community-wide advantages and yield specific\nbenefits to specific vulnerable groups. For example, regulating the proper marketing of breast-\nmilk substitutes (or alternatively promoting breast-feeding) can have dramatic benefits for child\nhealth  through  the  reduced  incidence  of  diarrhea.  The  introduction  of  occupational  health  and\nsafety guidelines will reduce the incidence of industrial accidents in the workplace.\n\n94.\nAlthough  the  Program  will  generally  lead  to  improved  health  status  of  the  entire\nBhutanese  population,  there  will  be  benefits  that  will  directly  accrue  to  specific  groups.  The\nemphasis on PHC will directly benefit the poor, women, children, and rural communities that still\nrely on indigenous or traditional medicine. Bhutan\u2019s labor force will generally benefit with a safer\nwork  environment,  while  female  health  workers  will  be  granted  equal  opportunities  in  career\nadvancement and training.\n\nB.\n\nPoverty Reduction\n\nInvestments in health promote human development and help advance the goals of social\n95.\nand economic development. Improved health status of the population is an essential component\nof  any  strategy  to  reduce  poverty.  For  the  poor  who  are  most  likely  to  be  involved  in  physical\nlabor as their main source of livelihood and income, good health is a most important asset and\nthe major determinant of earning capacity. However, the burden of disease is disproportionately\nborne by the poor, who are more at risk to communicable diseases. In addition, the income of\nthe  poor  is  significantly  reduced  once  they  become  ill.  Economic  gains  from  investments  in\n\n\f23\n\nhealth programs will thus be greater for the poor than for the nonpoor. This general observation\nis also relevant in the case of the Program wherein policy measures and specific interventions in\nPHC  will  contribute  to  the  improved  health  status  of  the  poor  and  accompanying  rise  in\nproductivity  and  income.  The  World  Bank  estimated  that  a  decrease  in  under-five  mortality  of\n1.0 percent is associated with a 1.24 percent increase in per capita income growth.10\n\n96.\nThe  poverty  impact  assessment  indicates  that  the  Program  was  developed  with\nconsideration  to  the  plight  of  vulnerable  groups  in  Bhutan  (Appendix  10).  The  assessment\nconcludes that the overall impact on the poor is strongly positive. The use of poverty indicators\nas one of the criteria in resource allocation to ensure equity in public health financing will enable\nthe  Government  to  adopt  a  more  focused  approach  in  targeting  poverty  groups  in  its  health\nprograms. Specific PHC policy interventions will also reap substantial benefits for the poor. For\ninstance,  improving  access  to  emergency  obstetrical  care  centers  in  underserved  areas  and\nassigning female health workers to BHUs will greatly benefit poor women who face higher risk\nof  maternal  mortality.  Establishing  more  indigenous  medicine  units  at  district  hospitals  will\nimprove access to health care for the rural poor who continue to embrace traditional medicine.\nStrengthening  of  the  HIV/AIDS  surveillance  system  will  be  of  advantage  to  women  who  are\nbiologically more vulnerable to STD and HIV infection, and to the poor who are generally more\nlikely  to  be  involved  in  commercial  sex.  The  study  on Haemophilus influenza b vaccine  for  its\npossible inclusion in the EPI is a move that will eventually benefit children since ARI is one of\nthe leading causes of infant mortality in Bhutan.\n\nC.\n\nRisks and Safeguards\n\nThe Program was formulated on the basis of the Government\u2019s continued commitment\n97.\nto  accord  priority  to  the  health  sector,  including  budgetary  and  human  resources.  Any  major\nchange  in  the  policy  direction  of  the  Government,  caused  by  weakening  macroeconomic  and\nfiscal  position  could  delay  the  implementation  of  policy  actions  as  originally  intended.  Policy\ndiscussions  between  ADB  and  the  Government  at  the  ministerial  level  have  revealed  that  the\ncountry\u2019s  development  policy,  anchored  on  the  principles  of  social  justice  and  equity,  will\ncontinue  to  accord  budgetary  priority  to  the  social  sectors,  including  health.  The  continuing\nsupport  from  the  major  external  funding  in  Bhutan\u2019s  health  programs  will  provide  another\nsafeguard against any derailment of the Program due to an economic downturn.\n\n98.\nVarious  Government  ministries  and  offices  are  involved  in  implementing  the  Program,\ngiven its intersectoral nature. The lack of coordination of these ministries could delay program\nimplementation.  The  creation  of  the  ISC  with  representation  from  all  concerned  ministries  to\nprovide  policy  oversight  and  coordination  will  help  minimize  this  risk.  The  PMU  at  MOHE  will\nprovide  technical  support.  Regular  ADB  review  missions  will  also  support  these  coordination\nefforts.\n\n99.\nThere  will  be  some  risks  associated  with  implementing  specific  policy  measures.  The\nintroduction of user fees may serve as a barrier and deter would-be patients, including the poor,\nfrom  seeking  health  services.  To  minimize  this  risk,  the  Government  has  agreed  to  conduct  a\npilot study, including a willingness-to-pay component, to ensure that such a policy measure will\nbe  limited  to  nonessential  services  and  will  have  no  adverse  impact  on  access  to  essential\nservices.  Prior  to  the  introduction  of  such  user  fees,  the  Government  will  conduct  intensive\nmarketing  and  educational  campaigns  to  explain  the  need  to  develop  sustainable  financing\n\n10 Cited in ADB. 1999. Policy for the Health Sector. Manila.\n\n\f24\n\nmechanisms.  Various  media  will  be  used  and  public  discussions  will  be  held  with  community\ngroups.  Full  information  on  the  proposed  fee  structure  will  be  provided  during  the  information\ncampaign. In addition, exemption and adjustment mechanisms and monitoring methods will be\nincorporated in the user fee policy.\n\n100.\nFinally,  there  is  the  risk  that  the  BHTF  may  not  be  able  to  achieve  its  revenue  targets\ndue  to  poor  market  performance,  a  risk  that  applies  to  all  trust  funds.  In  addition  to  the\nengagement  of  a  professional  fund  manager,  the  Government  will  adopt  other  prudent\nmeasures  to  safeguard  its  investment  in  the  BHTF.  These  include  (i)  the  setting  of  clear\nguidelines in the Royal Charter and in its contract with the fund manager to govern the permitted\nlevel of risk and nature of investments, (ii) the use of appropriate international benchmarks as\nthe  basis  for  measuring  the  fund  manager\u2019s  performance,  and  (iii)  the  setting  of  limits  on  the\nextent for drawing down the principal of the BHTF.\n\nVIII.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n101.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe policies adopted and actions taken before the date of the Loan Agreement,\nas described in the DPL and the policy matrix, will continue to be in effect for at\nleast the duration of the Program.\n\nThe Government will adopt the policies and take such other actions included in\nthe  Program  and  as  specified  in  the  DPL  and  the  policy  matrix  in  a  timely\nmanner, and will ensure that such policies and actions will continue to be in effect\nfor  the  duration  of  the  Program  and,  where  appropriate,  under  the  Ninth  Five-\nYear Plan.\n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  (a)  initial  capitalization  of  the  BHTF  of  at  least  $5\nmillion  within  3  months  after  the  release  of  the  first  tranche  and  (b)  continued\ncoordination with other donor agencies to further mobilize its capital to reach the\nrequired  target  of  $24  million  and  the  matching  of  such  donor  contribution  on  a\none-to-one  basis.  The  Government  will  meet  any  shortfall  in  meeting  the\nexpenditures under the program activities of the BHTF either from its budgetary\nsources or other sources.\n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  BHTF  will  be  exempted  from  income  tax,\npayment  of  customs  and  import  duties,  and  excise  duty  on  vaccines,  drugs,\nneedles,  syringes,  cold  chain  equipment,  and  other  related  drugs/equipment\npurchased for carrying out the program activities of the BHTF.\n\nThe Government will ensure that, for the duration of the Program, any changes to\nthe BHTF Royal Charter will be carried out after prior consultation with the ADB.\nIn the event of termination or dissolution of the BHTF, the remaining assets of the\ntrust fund under the BHTF will be utilized, first to meet the objectives of the BHTF\nunder the BHTF Royal Charter and thereafter for financing related development\nactivities under the health sector.\n\n\f25\n\n(vi) \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  BHTF  is  professionally  managed  through\nthe  services  of  an  international  fund  manager  using  investment  guidelines,\nauthorized  relationships  and  reporting  modalities  provided  by  the  Board  of  the\nBHTF, to achieve the objectives of the BHTF in an efficient manner.\n\n(vii) \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  annual  reports  of  the  BHTF,  including  its\naudited  financial  statements  will  be  provided  to  the  Bank  not  later  than  six\nmonths after the close of the financial year to which they relate.\n\n(viii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  in  implementing  expanded  user  fees  on\nservices  under  the  health  sector,  these  will  not  adversely  impact  on  access  to\nessential services for the people.\n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nThe Government will ensure that the draft of the proposed schedule on user fees\nas prepared on the basis of the pilot study on user fees, will be discussed under\npublic discussions prior to their introduction in the Ninth Five-Year Plan.\n\nThe  Government  will  coordinate  with  nongovernment  or  community-based\norganizations as appropriate to enhance the impact of the development activities\nunder  the  Program,  in  particular  in  those  areas  of  Bhutan  with  inadequate\ncoverage of health services.\n\nThe Government will ensure that recurrent expenditures, as a percentage share\nof  total  health  sector  budget  will  not  fall  below  the  level  of  1998/99  during\nimplementation  of  the  Program.  Within  the  total  health  recurrent  expenditures,\nthe share of recurrent budget allocated to PHC will not be allowed to fall below\n50 percent during implementation of the Program.\n\n(xii) \n\nThe  Government  will  use  the  latest  data  generated  by  the  April  2000  health\nsurvey  to  develop  baseline  performance  indicators  to  assess  the  Program\u2019s\nimpact on the health sector.\n\n(xiii)  The  Government  will  use  the  data  generated  by  the  joint  Government-ADB\npoverty  assessment  exercise  to  develop  the  baseline  indicators  for  monitoring\nthe impact on poverty reduction under the Program.\n\n(xiv)  The  Government  will  use  the  annual  health  conference  as  a  feedback\n\nmechanism to assess the impact of the Program on the health sector.\n\n\f26\n\nIX.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n102.\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to\nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  7,614,000  to  the  Kingdom  of  Bhutan  for  the  Health  Care  Reform\nProgram,  with  a  term  of  24  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years  and  with  an  interest\ncharge at the rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum\nthereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those\nset forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board.\n\n28 August 2000\n\nTADAO CHINO\nPresident\n\n\f27\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNumber\n\nTitle\n\nPage\n\nCited on\n(page, para.)\n\nProgram Framework\n\nKey Socioeconomic Indicators\n\nSelected Health Indicators\n\nExternal Assistance to the Health Sector\n\nDevelopment Policy Letter\n\nRoyal Charter of the Bhutan Health Trust Fund\n\nBhutan Health Trust Fund\n\nOrganizational Structure of the Department of\nHealth (Ministry of Health and Education)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nIneligible Items\n\n10\n\nPoverty Impact Assessment\n\n28\n\n32\n\n34\n\n36\n\n37\n\n47\n\n60\n\n63\n\n64\n\n65\n\n1, 2\n\n3, 10\n\n3, 12\n\n11, 44\n\n14, 58\n\n15, 63\n\n15, 63\n\n20, 84\n\n20, 86\n\n23, 96\n\n\f28\n\nAppendix 1, page 1\n\nPROGRAM FRAMEWORK\n\nDesign Summary\n\nPerformance Indicators\nand Targets\n\nMonitoring Mechanisms\n\nAssumptions/Risks\n\nGoal\n\nTo improve the\nhealth of the\npopulation of\nBhutan\n\n1.1\n\nLife expectancy at birth\nincreased from 66 in\n1994\n\n1.1  Health management\ninformation system\n(HMIS)\n\n(cid:129)  Political will to improve the\nstandard of living of the\npopulation of Bhutan\nremains at current high\nlevel\n\n1.2  Intermittent population-\n\n(cid:129)  No major disease\n\nbased surveys\n\noutbreak;

This  high  population  growth  rate  will  eventually  erode  economic\ngrowth  and  poverty  reduction  by  restricting  savings  and  investment.  Public  health\nconcerns  have  also  emerged  with  regard  to  use  of  alcohol  and  betel  nut,  increased\nsmoking and the potential spread of HIV/AIDS. Effectively addressing these challenges\nwill require adequate financial resources, improved management practices, strengthened\nhuman resources for health and effective public health regulations to be enforced.\n\nAs stated in the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1997-2002), the RGoB accords high priority to\nimproving  health  care,  which  is  seen  as  the  key  to  promoting  the  social  and  economic\ndevelopment of the country. Specifically, the Government aims to (i) intensify population\nplanning  activities;  (ii)  consolidate  and  strengthen  existing  health  infrastructure;\n(iii) promote  self-reliance  and  sustainability  in  the  health  sector;  (iv)  strengthen  human\nresource  development  for  effective  implementation  of  health  services;  (v)  enhance  the\nquality  of  health  care  services;  and  (vi)  extend  health  care  services  to  those  unreached\nareas.  It  is  the  intention  of  the  RGoB  to  address  long-term  strategic  issues  through  a\nhealth care reform program.\n\nThe  proposed  health  care  reform  program  (the  Program),  which  will  run  during  a  five-\nyear period (2000-2005) has five key objectives: (i) developing sustainable financing in\nthe  health  sector,  (ii)  strengthening  capacity  for  health  management,  (iii)  strengthening\nquality  assurance  and  public  regulatory  functions,  (iv)  adjusting  imbalances  in  human\nresources for health, and (v) strengthening primary health care (PHC). The Program will\ninclude  specific  reform  measures  to  address  priority  issues  in  health  service  planning,\nmonitoring and implementation as shown in the attached Policy Matrix. We believe that\nthe  proposed  program  will  contribute  to  the  realization  of  the  vision  of  a  Bhutan  2020\nwhen  access  to  health  care  is  no  longer  an  issue  and  when  a  strong  and  self-financing\nhealth  system  has  been  developed  to  promote  human  development  objectives  including\nincreased productivity and poverty reduction.\n\n1.\n\nDeveloping Sustainable Financing for Health Care\n\nGiven  the  recent  substantial  investment  in  health  infrastructure  and  expected  rise  in\nrecurrent expenditures, the RGoB is aware of the urgent need to put long term financing\nof health care services on a sustainable footing and ensure that the expansion of primary\nhealth care services for all Bhutanese continues. In this connection, the RGoB is adopting\na  two-pronged  strategy  of  increased  resource  mobilization  and  increased  efficiency  in\nresource use including cost containment. On the basis of our timetable for reform agenda,\nthe following major policy initiatives will be implemented in 2000.\n\n(i)\n\nThe  Government  will  initially  approve  a  policy  paper  advocating  the  need  to\nexpand  user  charges  for  selected  health  care  services  through  a  pilot  study.  The\npolicy  paper  will  be  based  on  the  findings  of  surveys  on  current  user\n\n2\n\n\f(ii)\n\n(v)\n\n39\n\nAppendix 5, page 3\n\ncharges  in  hospitals  and  household  income  and  expenditure  patterns  on\nhealth  care  and  discussions  with  stakeholder  groups.  The  policy  paper  will\nbe  the  basis  for  launching  a  pilot  study  by  end  of  2000  that  will  assess  the\nfeasibility  of  the  expansion  of  user  charges  on  selected  nonessential  health\nservices.  In  carrying  out  the  pilot  study,  the  Ministry  of  Health  and\nEducation (MOHE) will assess their impact on use of health services as well\nas  studying  health-seeking  behavior  to  identify  other  mechanisms  to\nencourage rational use of health services and to ensure that there will be no\nimpact on the access to essential services, particularly among the poor.\n\nThe  Bhutan  Health  Trust  Fund  (BHTF)  will  be  legally  established  through\nthe  issuance  of  a  Royal  Charter.  The  BHTF  will  be  developed  as  a\nsustainable  financing  mechanism  that  is  expected  to  generate  funds  to\ncover  the  annual  expenditure  on  essential  drugs,  vaccines  and  new\ntechnologies.  It  is  important  to  note  that  the  focus  of  the  BHTF  is  on\nprimary  health  care  (PHC)  and  will  support  the  expanded  program  on\nimmunization and reproductive health, of which women and children are the\nprime beneficiaries.\n\n7.\n\nIn  addition,  more  policy  initiatives  will  be  adopted  in  2001.  Some  of  these\nwill be based on the findings of the studies mentioned above. These include\nthe following:\n\nA  policy  paper  advocating  the  use  of  poverty  incidence  as  one  of  the\ncriteria  for  resources  allocation  to  ensure  more  equitable  access  to  health\nservices  will  be  completed.  Subsequently,  poverty  indicators  based  on\nthe  data  generated  by  a  new  health  management  information  system\n(HMIS)  and  the  findings  of  the  joint  RGoB/ADB  poverty  assessment\nexercise  will  be  used  as  one  of  the  planning  inputs  for  allocating\nresources in the health sector during the Ninth Five-Year Plan.\n\n(vi)\n\nSituation  analysis  completed  on  chronic  degenerative  diseases.  To  the\nextent  possible,  we  will  attempt  to  project  the  burden  of  disease  and  its\nfinancial implications for the health budget.\n\n(vii) On the basis of the pilot study, we will develop a proposed structure of user\ncharges  on  additional  health  services  and  the  institutional  mechanisms\nneeded  to  administer  these  user  charges.  Public  discussions  will  be  held\nin  order \nfor  cost-sharing\nmechanisms  in  health  services  prior  to  their  introduction  in  the  Ninth\nFive-Year Plan.\n\nto  sensitize  communities \n\nthe  need \n\nto \n\n(viii) Completion  of  a  market  review  of  ancillary  services  for  the  hospital  with\n\na view to contracting out these services.\n\n3\n\n\f40\n\nAppendix 5, page 4\n\n(ix)\n\n(x)\n\nUndertake  a  study  on  projected  need  for  and  cost  implications  of  overseas\ntraining and service provision.\n\nTo enhance the efficient use of resources in the health sector, the MOHE will\nnow be using recurrent cost analysis in order to project the impact of major\ncapital investment projects on recurrent budget. This will become a standard\nplanning tool to improve the priority setting and decision-making process on\nthe basis of cost-effectiveness.\n\n2.\n\nStrengthening Capacity for Health Sector Management\n\n8.\n\n9.\n\nThe  RGoB  also  recognizes  the  need  to  overcome  weaknesses  that  relate  to\ndeficiencies  in  planning,  management,  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  of  public\nhealth  policies  and  programs.  Capacity-building  efforts  will  be  carried  out  through\nthe  introduction  of  a  comprehensive  strategic  planning  framework  for  health\nprograms in 2000. The MOHE has also developed a restructuring plan for its Policy\nand Planning Division, which will be strengthened through the proposed creation of\na new M&E section. The identification and training of adequate staff for recruitment\nwill  also  be  completed  in  2001  in  order  to  ensure  that  qualified  staff  will  be  made\navailable  under  our  civil  service  system  for  the  restructured  Policy  and  Planning\nDivision immediately after the bifurcation of the MOHE into the Ministry of Health\nand the Ministry of Education which is proposed to take place in 2002.\n\nManagement  and  planning  of  health  facilities  will  also  be  enhanced  through  the\nadoption  of  a  standard  health  facility  maintenance  program.  The  adoption  of  new\nfinancial management procedures in 2001 will also promote greater transparency and\naccountability.\n\n10. Monitoring  and  research  capacity  of  the  MOHE  will  also  be  strengthened.  While\ncurrent  plans  in  the  MOHE  have  measurable,  time-based  indicators,  there  is\ndifficulty  in  tracking  them  due  to  deficiencies  within  the  Health  Management\nInformation  System  (HMIS).  Hence,  the  problems  with  HMIS  will  be  addressed\nunder  the  program  such  that  more  reliable,  useful  and  timely  information  will  be\nmade  available.  The  RGoB  expects  to  install  an  upgraded  HMIS  by  2001.This\nimproved  HMIS  will  help  in  identifying  program  beneficiaries  more  clearly  and  in\ndesigning appropriate programs to meet their needs.\n\n3.\n\nStrengthening  Quality  Assurance  and  Public  Health  Regulatory\nFunctions\n\n11.\n\nThe  RGoB  also  recognizes  the  need  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  MOHE  to\nensure  the  quality  of  health  care  services.  In  view  of  this,  the  RGoB  has\nreviewed  its  management  approach  and  will  soon  establish  a  \u201cfocal  point\u201d\n\n4\n\n\f12.\n\n13.\n\n14.\n\n41\n\nAppendix 5, page 5\n\nwithin the MOHE which has the responsibility for \u201cQuality Assurance\u201d with respect\nto both the delivery of services and the management of activities and programs. This\n\u201cfocal point\u201d, will have the mandate to promote a shift towards more \u201cresults based\u201d\nmanagement.  A  review  of  the  logistics  for  the  proper  inventory  of  essential  drugs\nwill be carried out as part of this exercise.\n\nRegulatory  function,  an  essential  component  of  public  health  systems,  remains\nrelatively undeveloped in Bhutan and hence needs to be strengthened. A focal point\nwill  also  be  established  within  the  MOHE  in  2000  to  assume  responsibility  for\ncoordination  of  public  health  regulation.  This  focal  point  will  ensure  that  health\nsector  input  is  obtained  in  the  drafting  of  legislation/regulation  that  is  related  to\nhealth  and  enforcement  of  regulations  is  strengthened  and  will  also  be  responsible\nfor  the  dissemination  of  all  appropriate  public  health  legal  instruments.  To  achieve\nthis  task,  a  central  repository  will  be  set  up  to  compile,  catalogue  and  update  all\nexisting and future legal instruments with a bearing on the health sector.\n\nThe creation of focal points for quality assurance and public health regulations will\nenable  the  MOHE  to  facilitate  the  drafting  of  important  laws  and  regulations  for\npublic health. We expect that the draft legislation on the Bhutan Medical and Health\nCouncil will be approved by the Council of Ministers in 2001 and submitted to the\nNational  Assembly  for  its  consideration  soon  after.  We  also  intend  to  complete  a\nsituation  analysis  on  occupational  health  and  safety  issues  as  the  basis  for  future\nlegislation  in  the  ninth  Five-Year  Plan.  Specific  regulations  on  the  marketing  of\nbreast milk substitutes and for tobacco and alcohol will also be put in place in 2001.\nEnvironmental  codes  of  practice  to  improve  urban  sanitation  and  solid  waste\nmanagement, including an improved system for the proper disposal of medical waste\nin hospitals and other health facilities will also be adopted in 2001.\n\n4.\n\nAdjusting Imbalances in Human Resources for Health\n\nOne of the major limitations to the provision of adequate health services in Bhutan\nhas  been  the  lack  of  sufficient  health  workers  of  all  categories.  The  RGoB  has\nexerted  efforts  to  train  more  Bhutanese  nationals  to  staff  the  various  categories,\nincluding specialist positions that are currently filled in by expatriates. A review of\ngender equity to address the concerns of female health staff and patients is expected\nto  be  completed  by  September  2000.  The  RGoB  will  also  review  the  existing\npractices  with  regard  to  the  training  and  use  of  village  health  workers.  The  RGoB\nwill  continue  to  encourage  community  participation  in  the  delivery  of  basic  health\nservices by optimizing the role of village health workers who have made significant\ncontributions.\n\n15.\n\nA  major  undertaking  to  adjust  imbalances  in  human  resources  for  health  is\nto  revise  and  update  the  current  Master  Plan  for  Human  Resources  in  Health\n\n5\n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 5, page 6\n\nissues  more  effectively,  as  personnel  are \n\n(MPHRH)  to  reflect  more  current  and  projected  personnel  requirements  in\nvarious  disciplines,  grade  levels  and  geographic  areas.  An  updated  MPHRH  will\nalso  address  personnel \nthe  key\ncomponent  of  health  expenditures.  The  Royal  Civil  Service  Commission\n(RCSC)  also  uses  MPHRH  for  planning  investments  in  overseas  education;  thus,\nthe  MPHRH  needs  to  present  a  more  accurate  situation  of  the  health  personnel\nrequirements  to  ensure  that  resources  are  efficiently  used.  In  this  connection,  the\nMPHRH  will  be  reviewed  and  updated  in  2001.  The  RGoB  will  also  implement\na  policy  to  ensure  that  all  basic  health  units  will  include  female  staff  who  can\nprovide  services  to  female  patients.  This  will  also  help  promote  more  antenatal\nvisits  to  health  centers  and  reduce  the  high  maternal  mortality,  particularly  in  the\nrural areas.\n\n5.\n\nStrengthening Primary Health Care (PHC)\n\nTo  demonstrate  our  continuing  commitment  to  primary  health  care,  the  RGoB\nwill  adopt  policies  to  strengthen  PHC  through  selective  interventions  and  the\nexpansion  of  priority  services  to  benefit  vulnerable  groups  and  underserved  areas.\nAmong  these  initiatives  is  to  reactivate  the  Multisectoral  Task  Force  on  STD/HIV\nissues  to  ensure  its  active  participation  in  promoting  political  and  social\nawareness on such issues and help strengthen the HIV/AIDS surveillance system.\n\nIn order to ensure effective delivery of PHC, the RGoB will ensure that for each of\nthe  fiscal  year  during  Program  period  (2000-2005),  the  recurrent  expenditures  as  a\npercentage  share  of  total  health  budget  will  not  fall  below  the  level  of  1998/1999.\nWithin  the  total  health  recurrent  expenditures,  the  share  of  recurrent  budget\nallocated  to  PHC  throughout  the  Program  duration  will  not  be  allowed  to  fall\nbelow  50  percent  to  support  the  implementation  and  operations  of  selected  PHC\ninterventions.  These  will  include  (i)  increasing  the  number  of  hospitals  providing\ncomprehensive  reproductive  health  services,  including  emergency  obstetric  care\nand clinical family planning, from four to eight, in under-served areas and (ii) a tel\n-medicine  pilot  project  that  links  the  Mongar  Regional  Referral  hospital  with  the\nJDWNRH in Thimphu. It is hoped that these measures will make health care more\naccessible.\n\nIn addition, to strengthen our expanded immunization program, we will carry out a\nstudy to determine the importance of Haemophilus influenza b in the epidemiology\nof  acute  respiratory  tract  infections.  The  RGB  will  also  establish  six  more\nindigenous  units  so  that  all  district  hospitals  will  have  such  units  by  2002.  This  is\nin  line  with  the  policy  objective  to  provide  traditional  health  care  to  the  segment\nof society seeking such type of health care.\n\nIn  order  to  implement  the  Program  in  a  timely  and  effective  manner,  we  have  set\nup  an  inter-ministerial  steering  committee  (ISC)  to  provide  policy  oversight  and  to\nmonitor  and  co-ordinate  the  implementation  progress  of  the  various  policy\ninitiatives.  The  ISC  will  be  supported  by  a  Program  Management  Unit  (PMU)  to\n\n16.\n\n17.\n\n18.\n\n19.\n\n6\n\n\f43\n\nAppendix 5, page 7\n\n7\n\n\f44\n\nAppendix 5, page

HEALTH TRUST FUND\n\nI.\n\nObjectives and Strategy\n\nThe  Bhutan  Health  Trust  Fund  (BHTF)  is  a  Government  initiative  to  support  the\n1.\nsustainability  of  primary  health  care  services  through  the  continued  supply  of  vaccines  and\nessential  drugs.  For  the  most  part,  the  immunization  program  is  currently  financed  through\ndonations  in  kind  from  the  international  community.  The  Japan  International  Cooperation\nAgency  has  committed  over  half  of  the  required  funding  each  year  until  2002.  After  this  date\nthere  is  no  committed  funding  for  the  expanded  program  for  immunization  (EPI)  program  and\nalternative, sustainable sources of funding were explored to ensure its ongoing implementation.\nOne  of  the  options  considered  was  the  creation  of  a  trust  fund  with  investment  sufficient  to\ngenerate  funds  to  cover  the  annual  expenditure  on  essential  drugs  and  vaccines.  Technical\nadvice was initially provided by the World Health Organization (WHO); the existing Bhutan Trust\nFund for Environmental Conservation (BTFEC) was used as a model for setting up the BHTF.\n\nII. \n\nStatus of the BHTF\n\n2.\nIn drawing lessons from the successful BTFEC, the BHTF was legally established under\na  Royal  Charter  in  August  2000,  following  which  a  board  of  directors  and  a  secretariat  were\nconstituted.  The  Government  has  been  actively  promoting  the  BHTF  among  potential  donors\nand is committed to match all aid grants to the BHTF. To date, the Government has been able\nto  raise  a  total  of  about  $2.94  million  (including  interest  earnings)  for  the  BHTF  from  its  own\nresources and from contributions from other sources as indicated in Table A7.1.\n\nTable A7.1: Contributions to the Bhutan Health Trust Fund (Excluding interest earned)\n\nSources\n\nGovernment\n\nNew Zealand\n\nBill and Melinda Gates Foundation\n\nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund\n\nSave the Children Fund\n\nAmount\n(US$)\n1,760,177\n\n1,000,000\n\n53,374\n\n15,000\n\n5,000\n\n3.\nThe Government has committed to further deposit $239,823 to the BHTF, the balance of\nits initial $2.0 million commitment. The proposed ADB program loan will assist the Government\nin  augmenting  its  contribution  to  the  BHTF,  by  initially  achieving  the  minimum  capital\nrequirements  of  at  least  $5.0  million,  for  which  the  BHTF  can  become  operational.  The\nGovernment plans to have the BHTF attain a desired capitalization target of $24 million through\nadditional external contributions, which will be matched by the Government on one-to-one basis\nfrom  its  own  resources  and  income  generated  by  the  BHTF  as  appropriate.  The  $24  million\ncapitalization would enable the Government to help cover the projected total requirements of the\nvaccinations and essential drugs programs estimated to reach $2.3 million in 2008 (Table A7.2).\n\n\f61\n\nAppendix 7, page 2\n\nIII.\n\nManagement and Administration of the BHTF\n\n4.\nA secretariat, comprising a project director, and required staff, is responsible for the day-\nto-day activities, and for implementing board decisions. In addition, an advisory committee will\nbe established to provide advice to the board and the secretariat, and will be convened on an ad\nhoc basis when it is considered necessary to review the progress of the BHTF.\n\n5.\nThe BHTF will be established as a 501(c)4 or similar status in the United States (US) or\nhost nation to ensure its exemption from tax on earnings. The feasibility of this must be explored\nfurther.  It  is  believed  that  as  a  social  welfare  organization,  the  BHTF,  like  the  BTFEC,  should\nfulfill the necessary criteria to achieve this status. An annual audit of the BHTF will be carried\nout  by  the  Royal  Audit  Authority  and  an  international  accounting  firm,  on  request  of  the\nmanagement board.\n\n6.\nAn  international  fund  manager  will  be  contracted  to  manage  the  investments  to\nguarantee  an  income  of  a  certain  level  above  US  inflation,  taking  into  account  international\nbenchmarks  for  investment  revenues  in  similar  funds.  Board  members  will  include  individuals\nwith the requisite skills to review the progress of the BHTF. The quarterly reports to be provided\nby the program monitoring unit to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will include a report on\nthe performance of the BHTF and its investments, including the use of proceeds of income from\nits  investment.  Any  changes  proposed  to  the  Royal  Charter  during  the  Program  period  will  be\ncarried  out  after  prior  consultation  with  ADB.  In  the  event  of  termination  or  dissolution  of  the\nBHTF,  the  remaining  assets  of  the  trust  fund  will  be  used  first  to  meet  the  objectives  of  the\nBHTF, any remaining balance will be used to finance related development activities under the\nhealth  sector  in  Bhutan.  Annual  reports  of  the  BHTF,  which  will  include  audited  financial\nstatements, will be submitted to ADB.\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 7, page 3\n\n \n\n8\n0\n0\n2\n-\n9\n9\n9\n1\n

This  is  the  lowest  ranking  of  all  South  Asian  developing\nmember countries. Gross national product per capita is $586 and 85 percent of the Bhutanese\npopulation  still  reside  in  rural  areas.  The  dependence  on  subsistence  agriculture  is  evident  in\nthe  low  level  of  monetization  and  the  large  contribution  agriculture  plays  in  gross  domestic\nproduct. The Government is committed to economic development with an emphasis on equity;\nthis has led to commendable investments in health and education. The program goals fall in line\nwith  these  tenets,  looking  to  reform  to  strengthen  health  care  delivery  and  ensure  sustainable\nsources of financing for primary health care (PHC) in the long term. Implicit in development of\nthe  Program  has  been  concern  for  the  poor,  and  each  of  the  program  outputs  serves  this\nvulnerable  group.  The  main  program  outputs  therefore  contain  measures  aimed  at  improving\naccess  to  health  services  and  contributing  to  bettering  health  status  for  all.  A  description  of\nimpact on poverty of each of the program elements follows.\n\nA.\n\nDevelop Sustainable Financing for the Health Sector\n\n2.\nFinancing reform of the health sector will be achieved by developing additional methods\nof  finance\u2014user  charges  and  the  Bhutan  Health  Trust  Fund  (BHTF).  The  net  increase  of\nresources will be translated into an increased subsidy for the poor if the commitment to PHC is\nmaintained  and  the  user  charge  strategy  is  defined  in  a  way  that  does  not  have  an  adverse\nimpact on health service utilization by the poor. Increased efficiency and cost containment in the\nhealth  sector,  within  the  context  of  maintained  expenditures,  will  free  up  resources  for  more\ncost-effective allocation and an increased ability to meet the needs of unserved areas, currently\nunmet demands and human resource strengthening. This will lead to a net increase in subsidy\nto the poor.\n\nB.\n\nStrengthen Capacity in Health Sector Management\n\n3.\nImproved  quality  and  management  capacity  will  lead  to  better  health  services  for  all,\nincluding the poor. Thus as long as the budget allocation is maintained, there will be a net gain\nfor  the  poor.  Management  capacity  improvements  may  also  lead  to  efficiency  gains,  in  which\ncase the net transfer of subsidies to the poor will also increase.\n\nC.\n\nStrengthen Quality Assurance and Public Health Regulatory Functions\n\n4.\nIf  the  cost  of  new  regulations  are  in  excess  of  the  cost  savings,  this  will  translate  to\nhigher prices for goods and services. In addition, if regulation is too costly, production may shift\nto  other  countries  in  the  region,  having  an  adverse  affect  on  economic  growth  and\ndiversification.  In  terms  of  impact  on  the  poor,  this  is  partially  offset  by  increased  access  to\nquality, well-regulated health and other services. In the long run, regulation, if appropriate, will\nlead  to  economic  growth  through  cost  savings  due  to  better  health  status  and  resulting\nincreased  production  levels.  In  addition,  these  gains  to  the  poor  include  reduction  in\noccupational  and  environmental  health  hazards,  and  related  ill  health  and  associated  costs.\nStrengthening of quality assurance of health programs will also translate to improved quality of\nhealth care for the poor.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\nD.\n\nAdjust Imbalances in Human Resources for Health\n\n5.\nRevising  and  updating  the  human  resources  master  plan  and  ensuring  equal\nopportunities for men and women in the health care career path will strengthen human resource\ndevelopment. The former is expected to lead to increased efficiencies in the health care system.\nThe latter will result in increased numbers of women working at the basic health unit (BHU) level\nand  below.  In  turn,  this  will  break  down  barriers  to  women\u2019s  access  to  health  care,  improving\nhealth status, and hence, financial stability.\n\nE.\n\nStrengthen  PHC  Through  Selective  Interventions  and  Expansion  of  Priority\nServices\n\nEnsuring equity in health service delivery will be achieved by maintaining the budgetary\n6.\ncommitment to health services, and in particular PHC. Alongside this financing, regulatory and\nmanagement reform must ensure that the poor are protected by ensuring essential services are\nstill free of cost, and where charges are introduced appropriate exemption mechanisms are in\nplace  to  protect  the  poor.  Selective  PHC  interventions  are  especially  designed  to  meet  the\nhealth needs of vulnerable groups, including the poor, women, and children. Thus, emphasis on\nPHC will have substantial benefits for the poor.\n\nIn summary, the Program will benefit the poor as long as conditions to protect the poor\n7.\npopulation are met with regards to the user charge strategy. Any negative impact on the poor,\nresulting  from  other  elements  of  the  Program,  is  predicted  to  be  a  short-term  effect  of  reform\nand caused by higher prices as a result of indirect taxation and public health regulation. As well\nas increasing the direct subsidy to the poor through improved resource allocation, the efficiency\ngains derived from the reforms will free up resources to increase access to services in unserved\nareas;  meet  unmet  demands  for  health  care,  such  as  maternal  and  child  health  care;  and\nstrengthen human resources. Thus, the overall impact is strongly positive.\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 10, page 3\n\nn\na\nt\nu\nh\nB\n\ni\n\n \n;\ne\ne\nr\nf\n \nn\na\nm\ne\nr\n \ns\ne\nc\nv\nr\ne\ns\n\ni\n\nh\nt\nl\na\ne\nh\n
