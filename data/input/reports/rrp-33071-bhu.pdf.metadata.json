RECOMMENDATION 26\nAPPENDIXES 27", "LOAN AND PROGRAM SUMMARY\nBorrower Kingdom of Bhutan\nThe Proposal The  Health  Care  Reform  Program  is  designed  to  assist  the\nGovernment implement policy reforms in the health sector with the\nsupport of the proposed program loan of $10 million. The Program will\nbe implemented over five years (FY2001-FY2005).\nThe Program\nRationale As a small landlocked country, Bhutan faces constraints because of\nits mountainous terrain; high population growth rate, but limited pool\nof  skilled  human  resources;  and  economy  that  is  still  basically\nagricultural despite signs of industrial growth and diversification. The\nGovernment  has  always  accorded  high  priority  to  human\ndevelopment and has achieved remarkable progress in improving the\ncountry\u2019s  social  indicators,  particularly  in  education  and  health.\nHowever, investment in human development will remain critical to\n(i) improving  the  social  well-being  of  the  predominantly  rural\npopulation,  which  is  widely  dispersed  across  the  country;  and\n(ii) providing the much-needed human capital to support a growing\neconomy. When viewed in this context, the development of a healthy\npopulation  provides  the  key  to  the  country\u2019s  sustained  economic\ngrowth and poverty reduction.\nWith  human  development  serving  as  the  primary  objective  of  its\ndevelopment  strategy,  the  Government  is  seeking  to  ensure\ncontinued progress in improving the health status of the population.\nThe Government recognizes the need to develop a comprehensive\npolicy framework to address the structural weaknesses in the health\nsector,  and  new  challenges  and  demands  that  are  expected  to\nemerge from an evolving economy. Specifically, the reform agenda is\naimed  at  enhancing  efficiency  in  resource  allocation;  ensuring\nequitable  access  to  primary  health  care  (PHC)  services;  and\nstrengthening the planning and management capacity, and regulatory\nframework for the health sector.\nThe  Program  encompasses  major  policy  measures  that  will\ncollectively promote a more enabling environment for the Government\nto pursue its ongoing and future health programs. The Program was\ndesigned  in  consultation  with  other  major  aid  agencies  and  its\nimplementation  is  expected  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  their\nvarious health programs. Sustainability of health sector financing is a\nkey feature of the Program as other sectors are bound to claim an\nincreasing share of the Government budget as the economy expands\nand the population continues to grow at a rapid pace. It is inevitable\nthat the Government must explore innovative and sustainable ways of\nfinancing  a  potential  resource  gap  in  the  health  sector  and  help\nreduce  its  dependence  on  external  assistance.  In  addition,  the", "iii\nGovernment must protect and strengthen its core health program,\nwhich  specifically  addresses  PHC  needs  of  vulnerable  groups,\nparticularly women and children. A key feature of the Program is the\nestablishment of the Bhutan Health Trust Fund (BHTF) to help ensure\nlong-term  sustainable  financing  of  vaccines  and  essential  drugs.\nThus, by incorporating policy initiatives to ensure a more focused\napproach  in  addressing  equity  aspects  and  targeting  specific\nvulnerable groups, the Program will put into practice the forthcoming\npartnership  agreement  for  poverty  reduction  between  the\nGovernment and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).\nObjectives and The principal objective of the Program is to provide support for the\nScope Government\u2019s comprehensive reform agenda for strengthening the\nhealth sector. Its scope includes five policy priority areas: (i) develop\nsustainable financing for the health sector; (ii) strengthen capacity in\nhealth  sector  management;  (iii)  strengthen  quality  assurance  and\npublic health regulatory functions; (iv) adjust imbalances in human\nresources for health; and (v) strengthen PHC through selective PHC\ninterventions and expansion of priority services.\nClassification Primary Objective:  Human Development\nSecondary Objective: Poverty Reduction\nEnvironmental Category C\nAssessment Environmental  implications  of  the  Program  were  reviewed  and  no\nsignificant environmental impacts were identified.\nThe ADB Loan\nLoan Amount and A  loan  of  $10.0  million  is  proposed  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds\nTerms resources.  The  loan  will  have  a  repayment  period  of  24  years,\nincluding a grace period of 8 years. An interest rate of 1 percent will\nbe charged per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per\nannum thereafter, and other terms and conditions in accordance with\nthe Loan Agreement.\nProgram Period The Program will cover five years (FY2001-FY2005). The proposed\nand Tranching loan is to be disbursed in two tranches. The first tranche of $5.0\nmillion  will  be  made  available  upon  loan  effectiveness,  while  the\nsecond tranche, also for $5.0 million, will be made available following\nthe Government\u2019s compliance with the conditions set for its release.\nThe Program will be completed by June 2005.\nExecuting Agency Ministry of Health and Education (MOHE)\nProcurement The loan will finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding local\nduties and taxes) of imports procured in and from ADB\u2019s member\ncountries, other than those specified in the list of ineligible items and\nthose  items  financed  by  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  official\nsources. Procurement of eligible items under the loan will be based\non  normal  commercial  practices  for  procurement  by  the  private", "iv\nsector, or standard Government procurement procedures acceptable\nto ADB for procurement by the public sector. In the case of goods\ncommonly traded on international commodity markets, procurement\nwill be undertaken in accordance with procedures appropriate to the\ntrade and acceptable to ADB.\nCounterpart Funds The proceeds of the proposed loan will help the Government meet the\ncapital funding requirements of the BHTF. Any local currency proceeds\ngenerated by the loan will be used to support the implementation of\nspecific policy initiatives of the Program and to meet other expenditures\nin the health sector.\nRisks and The  Program  was  formulated  on  the  basis  of  the  Government\u2019s\nSafeguards continued  commitment  to  accord  priority  to  the  health  sector,\nincluding budgetary and human resources. Any major change in the\npolicy  direction  of  the  Government,  caused  by  weakening\nmacroeconomic and fiscal position could delay the implementation of\npolicy actions as originally intended. Policy discussions between ADB\nand the Government at the ministerial level have revealed that the\ncountry\u2019s development policy, anchored on the principles of social\njustice and equity, will continue to accord budgetary priority to the\nsocial sectors, including health. Continuing support from the major\nsources  of  external  assistance  in  Bhutan\u2019s  health  programs  will\nprovide another safeguard against any derailment of the Program due\nto an economic downturn.\nVarious Government ministries and offices are involved in program\nimplementation, given  its  intersectoral  nature.  The  lack  of\ncoordination of these ministries could delay program implementation.\nThe  creation  of  an  interministerial  steering  committee  with\nrepresentation  from  all  concerned  ministries  to  provide  policy\noversight and coordination will help minimize this risk. The program\nmonitoring unit to be established within MOHE will provide technical\nsupport.  Regular  ADB  review  missions  will  also  support  this\ncoordinating mechanism.", "v", "I. THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Kingdom of Bhutan for the Health Care Reform Program.\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. In response to a request of the Royal Government of Bhutan, the Asian Development\nBank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance (TA) in 1999 to help develop a\npolicy reform agenda that would strengthen the overall efficiency of the health sector in Bhutan.1\nThe TA reviewed the health sector in Bhutan, including its key issues and constraints, to identify\npriority areas for development. The TA also assessed the options for promoting sustainable\nfinancing for health services including the introduction of a Bhutan Health Trust Fund (BHTF)\nthat would enable the Government to meet the demands of economic growth and diversification.\nDuring TA implementation, field surveys, focus group discussions, and consultations with key\nstakeholders, including major aid agencies, were conducted and the results were used to design\nthe Health Care Reform Program. A poverty impact assessment of the Program was prepared,\nwhich was improved by the Fact-Finding Mission from 20 March-5 April 2000. The Appraisal\nMission,2 which visited Bhutan from 24 May-2 June 2000, held further consultations with major\nstakeholders and conducted an information-sharing workshop in which various Government\nministries,  district  and  health  workers,  and  major  aid  agencies  participated.  The  Program\nframework was subsequently updated and refined as shown in Appendix 1.\nIII. THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT\nA. Development Objectives, Strategy and Plans\n3. The Human Development Index of the United Nations Development Programme ranks\nBhutan 142nd of 174 countries.3 Over 85 percent of the population reside in rural areas, and\nmost  of  the  population  depend  on  subsistence  agriculture.  There  are  wide  variations  in\nhousehold income depending on the geographic area. Although the low Bhutanese income\ngenerally reflects widespread income poverty, the kind of abject poverty seen in some parts of\nAsia as a result of such low incomes is not evident in Bhutan. The Government\u2019s social welfare\npolicies over many years have focused on promoting human development and have resulted in\nrelatively widespread social well-being. Women in Bhutan generally have a much higher status\nthan their counterparts in many other countries in South Asia. Coverage of the population with\nclean water and access to latrines continues to increase concomitant with the integration of rural\nwater and sanitation projects as part of the country\u2019s health program. As such, the entire\npopulation is expected to gain access to potable water by the end of the Eighth Five-Year Plan\nor the Eighth Plan (FY1998-FY2002).\n4. Recent investments in the education sector have resulted in significant improvements in\neducational status and literacy, especially for girls, and given ongoing investments, this trend\nwill continue. The primary school enrolment rate is 72 percent and has been increasing steadily.\n1 TA 3186-BHU: Health Care Financing and Reform Program, for $150,000, approved on 16 April 1999.\n2 The Mission comprised E.A. Cua, Senior Project Specialist and Mission Leader and R. Vankina, Counsel, and was\nassisted by S.W. Handayani, Social Development Specialist.\n3 UNDP, Human Development Report, 2000.", "2\nAdult  literacy  has  significantly  improved  from  23  percent  in  1980  to  54  percent  in  1996;\nhowever, this conceals the much lower literacy rate of 28 percent for women. Moreover, limited\ntertiary education opportunities and few job openings in the service and Government sectors\nhave led to increasing concerns regarding employment opportunities for high school graduates.\n5. Demographic factors also play a significant role in determining patterns of health and\ndisease. In 1997, the population of Bhutan was estimated at 618,000 and growing at an annual\nrate of 3.1 percent. This high rate of population growth, which increased from 2.0 percent in\n1984, is primarily attributed to a rapid decline in mortality. This rate of growth will result in a\ndoubling of the population in 20 years, and will have a major impact on the demand for health\nservices. The Government has identified population growth as a major development issue and\nis active in population planning activities. Recent intensification of family planning activities has\nprobably resulted in a significant increase in the contraceptive prevalence rate and should\nreduce fertility and population growth rates.\n6. There has been a significant increase in internal rural-to-urban migration during the past\n20 years as shown by the declining share of rural population from 95 percent in 1980 to the\ncurrent 85 percent of the total population. This migration is likely to continue and will affect\ndemand  for  health  services.  Unofficial  immigration  and  traffic  across  the  relatively  porous\nsouthern and eastern borders may affect utilization of services and patterns of disease as well\n(communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS4 are of primary concern).\n7. Development efforts in Bhutan have also usually involved the participation of the various\nsectors of society. This approach has been instrumental in promoting good governance and\nimproving social development. In line with the development philosophy of the Government, the\nhealth and education sectors comprise over one quarter of public spending. Health alone is now\nover  11  percent  of  the  total,  an  increase  from  6.5  percent  in  1992/93.  Total  health  care\nexpenditures represent about 4.0 percent of GDP, comparing favorably with other DMCs in\nSouth and South East Asia.\nB. Recent Economic Performance and Prospects\n8. Bhutan\u2019s traditional economy, which is based on subsistence agriculture and barter\ntrade, began to diversify in the 1980s when gross domestic product (GDP) growth accelerated,\nreaching 8 percent per year. Economic growth and prudent fiscal management have enabled\ndomestic revenues to adequately cover all recurrent costs in almost every year since 1993.\nHowever the tax base is still limited, and the country relies heavily on external assistance to\nfund its development programs, particularly capital expenditures. Although the Government\nplans to introduce a personal income tax in 2001 once the required legislation is completed, the\ngains from this new tax mechanism are not expected to be realized for some time.\n9. The key source of growth in Bhutan\u2019s economy has been hydroelectric power, the\ndevelopment of which has been largely funded by assistance from India. Revenues from the\nhydroelectric power plants comprise 40 percent of total Government current revenues; the\nexpected tripling of production should eventually reduce the Government\u2019s dependence on\ninternational assistance. The trade balance shows a significant dependence on India, for both\ntrade and assistance. Over 90 percent of exports are normally to India, and 70 percent of\nimports originate from India. India provides more than half of the country\u2019s total grant assistance\nand a third of its total public external debt in 1999.\n4 HIV/AIDS refers to human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.", "3\n10. Prudent  fiscal  management  notwithstanding,  Bhutan  will  need  to  address  certain\nfundamental issues and potential risks: (i) the fragile dependence on energy exports to India as\nthe single most important source of Government revenue; (ii) limited and structurally weak\ndomestic revenue base that may not be able to cover rising recurrent expenditures to maintain\nphysical and social infrastructure, and specific programs; (iii) the possible slowdown of the\ninflow of grants and concessional loans; and (iv) increasing debt-service requirements for loans\nused to finance new power projects. Key socioeconomic indicators are presented in Appendix 2.\nIV. THE SECTOR\nA. Background and Recent Performance\n11. The  development  of  modern  health  systems  and  health  infrastructure  in  Bhutan\ncommenced during the early 1960s. Prior to this, access to western medical services, provided\nby a few Indian-trained Bhutanese physicians, was limited. The majority of the population\nutilized  traditional  medical  services  and  obtained  spiritual  assistance  offered  by  religious\ninstitutions  for  treatment  of  illness.  While  allopathic  medical  services  continue  to  expand,\ntraditional medicine is still recognized as the official medical tradition in Bhutan and is included\nin the national health system.\n12. The Government provides essentially all modern medical services in the country, apart\nfrom that provided by a few private pharmacy outlets in the main towns. The health system is\nbased  on  the  principles  of  primary  health  care  (PHC),  and  provides  integrated  curative,\npreventive, and promotive services. This approach targets vulnerable groups (the poor, women,\nchildren,  and  rural  populations)  through  the  establishment  of  basic  health  units  (BHUs)\nnationwide, and through the delivery of services appropriate for these groups (communicable\ndisease control; reproductive health services including family planning, immunization, water,\nand sanitation; and provision of essential drugs). This focus on basic health services is a critical\naspect of social development and poverty reduction, and has proved to be an effective strategy\nfor reaching out to the thinly scattered settlements throughout the country\u2019s mountainous terrain.\nSelected data on Bhutan\u2019s health sector are shown in Appendix 3.\n1. Health Status\n13. Huge strides have been made, especially since the 1980s, in improving the health status\nof the Bhutanese population. Life expectancy at birth, 48 years in 1984, rose dramatically to 66\nyears in 1994. Marked improvement is evident in infant and under-five mortality rates, and\nsignificantly, there is no gender disparity in these rates. Childhood immunization coverage has\nbeen generally sustained at over 80 percent since 1990. No cases of poliomyelitis have been\ndiagnosed since 1986 and the last neonatal tetanus death occurred in 1994. No other deaths\nfrom vaccine-preventable diseases have been reported since 1994.5 The maternal mortality\nrate, 770 per 100,000 live births in 1984, dropped to 380 in 1994. Iodine deficiency disorder, a\nmajor problem a decade ago is now virtually eliminated, and leprosy is almost eradicated. The\nremarkable  improvement  in  health  indicators  has  been  attributed  to  the  Government\u2019s\n5 Mortality reporting is of questionable completeness and quality in Bhutan; nevertheless, that there have been no\nreported deaths is a significant improvement over past performance. In addition, using data on mortality rates for\ncomparative purposes should be done with caution, given the country\u2019s small population base.", "4\ncontinuing commitment to provide universal access to a package of minimum essential health\nservices under its health-for-all objective.\n2. Health Infrastructure\n14. Health  services  are  delivered  through  a  four-tier  network  consisting  of  the  national\nreferral hospital, the regional referral hospitals, the district hospitals, and BHUs. The BHU is a\nprimary level institution in the health care system and caters to a population of about 2,500-\n5,000. The standard staff complement of a BHU comprises a health assistant, an auxiliary nurse\nmidwife, and a basic health worker. Each BHU has an average of 3-6 outreach clinics (ORCs)\nthrough which services to the most distant villages are delivered, at present on a once-a-month\nbasis. These ORCs, to a large extent funded by United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF),\nhave been instrumental in increasing access to services; it is anticipated that activities will be\ncarried out in these posts more frequently in the future. To date, there are 145 BHUs across the\ncountry; together with their ORCs, they enable the Government to provide basic health services\nto about 90 percent of the population. The Government intends to consolidate and strengthen its\nhealth infrastructure during the Eighth Plan with an additional 15 BHUs to be constructed by\n2002.\n15. District  hospitals  are  the  first-level  referral  institutions  and  are  equipped  to  provide\ncurative,  promotive,  preventive,  and  emergency  services.  There  are  currently  28  district\nhospitals (including the three regional referral hospitals), 14 of which have indigenous units.\nRegional  referral  hospitals  are  the  second-level  referral  hospitals  and  provide  specialist\nservices.  At  the  national  level  is  the  Jigme  Dorji  Wangchuck  National  Referral  Hospital\n(JDWNRH), which also serves as the regional referral hospital for the western region.\n3. Human Resources for Health\n16. While the Government continues to need the services of expatriate physicians, there is a\ngradual shift to reliance on nationals. At present, only 8 of the 98 physicians practicing in Bhutan\nare expatriates. The Government is committed to providing a totally Bhutanese health staff as\nsoon as possible. The establishment of the Royal Institute of Health Sciences (RIHS) in 1974\nwas the first step in the development of self-reliance in human resources. Apart from physicians,\nthe very few baccalaureate-educated health workers, and certain specialized health personnel,\ntraining of health staff in Bhutan is carried out by RIHS. In addition to the clinical staff, RIHS\ntrains X-ray, pharmacy, laboratory, dental, and physiotherapy technicians, as well as opticians\nand ophthalmic assistants.\n17. The foundation of the health system is the nurse and other paramedic staff: the general\nnurse  midwife,  health  assistant,  auxiliary  nurse  midwife,  assistant  nurse,  and  basic  health\nworker. They are generally attached to the BHUs and assisted by village health workers,\nvolunteers who motivate the communities, provide a link between the health services and the\ncommunity, and provide simple treatments.\n18. The  Royal  Civil  Service  Commission  (RCSC)  is  responsible  for  human  resource\nplanning, and for selecting candidates for both national and international training. The number of\ntraining positions is determined based on the Master Plan for Human Resources, which was\ndeveloped in FY1995. Since then, the master plan has not been updated, and there is no recent\nofficial report on projected staffing needs.", "5\n4. Health Services Management and Planning\n19. The Government has adopted the policy of decentralization as a major objective in\nmanaging  the  delivery  of  health  services.  Commencing  in  1981,  the  district  (dzongkhag)\nadministrations  were  made  entirely  responsible  for  all  health  services,  excluding  referral\nhospitals and training institutions. In addition, management of health services is anchored on\ntwo strategic approaches: the integration of health services and the empowerment of peripheral\nhealth workers. Thus, disease-specific activities are being addressed in an integrated fashion\nnot through vertical health programs requiring separate health workers and facilities. BHU staff\nhelp determine the relevance of national programs in the local context and set their program\npriorities in consultation with the district health supervisory officer.\n20. Planning in the health sector comprises three-linked stages: the five-year plan, the\nannual plan, and the planning of day-to-day activities. It follows a bottom-up process with local\nadministrations preparing proposals that are submitted to the Policy and Planning Division\n(PPD) of the Ministry of Health and Education (MOHE). Health workers actively participate in\ndeveloping annual operational plans. This participatory planning process culminates every year\nwith the annual health conference which is attended by all district health medical officers, and\nsupervisors,  engineers,  and  concerned  staff  of  MOHE  and  national-level,  health-related\ninstitutes.  The  annual  health  conference  has  become  a  very  useful  forum  for  sharing\nexperiences,  reviewing  progress  of  health  programs,  receiving  feedback  from  the  field,\nidentifying  problems  and  issues,  and  providing  inputs  for  the  preparation  of  health  sector\nprogram strategies and plans. This annual interaction between policymakers and field workers\nin  Bhutan  has  substantially  contributed  to  the  development  of  a  health  system  based  on\ntransparency and accountability, and demonstrates the priority the Government accords to\nimproving the health status of the people.\n5. Health Expenditures and Financing\n21. Health  services  and  drugs  are  generally  provided  free-of-charge  for  nationals,  and\nnonnationals with work permits. The Government also shoulders the costs of tertiary care\nincurred by patients who cannot be treated within the country and are referred for treatment\neither in India or Thailand. The public health system is largely financed by the Government and\ninternational aid and to a small extent, by a contribution by civil servants representing 1 percent\nof their salaries (estimated to meet only 1.2 percent of total health expenditures). Recently,\nsome direct user charges were introduced for private cabins, medical certificates, some dental\nprocedures  and  diagnostics  in  hospital  facilities.  On  the  average,  external  assistance  has\naccounted for 43 percent of total health expenditures annually during 1995-1998, and was\nestimated to meet 65 percent of public expenditures in health care in FY1999. Although most of\nthis assistance is for capital expenditures, a considerable portion is for recurrent expenditures,\ncausing concern for sustained financing of the sector.\n22. Within the public health sector, the major expenditure has been in capital investment\n(over 45 percent of total expenditures) reflecting the ongoing investment in expanding health\nservice infrastructure. Recurrent expenditures have been increasing each year, although their\nshare  of  total  health  expenditures  has  been  declining  with  the  recent  surge  in  capital\nexpenditures. By component, personnel cost is the most important area of recurrent expenditure\nin the health sector. Total personnel costs are equal to 36 percent of recurrent costs, and are\nrising in both absolute and relative terms as the Government fills human resources gaps still\nfaced by the sector. Another major expenditure item, drug and nondrug medical supplies (9.5\npercent of total expenditures) has been shrinking in real terms in recent years.", "6\nB. Constraints and Issues\n23. The huge strides made in improving health status notwithstanding, there are evident\ndeficiencies.  Although  investments  in  infrastructure  development  could  partially  address\ngeographic  and  other  physical  constraints,  capacity-building  efforts  and  policy  reforms  are\ncritically  needed  to  enhance  efficiency  and  quality  of  health  care  delivery,  and  to  ensure\nsustainable  financing  of  the  sector.  The  high  population  growth  rate  will  place  additional\npressure on health care financing, where recurrent expenditures have been rising substantially.\nIn addition, the demographic transition (a shift to an older population structure) will result in a\nshift from a pattern of morbidity and mortality dominated by infectious diseases, to a pattern in\nwhich chronic degenerative diseases predominate. Economic development will also lead to\ngreater demand for a wider range of services currently not available. These imply that new\ndemands will be put on existing human resources, which currently are critically inadequate in\nmany areas. Public health concerns have also emerged on the use of alcohol and betel,\nincreased smoking, and the potential spread of HIV/AIDS. For the Government to continue its\nsignificant progress in improving the health status of the population, reforms will be needed to\naddress current weaknesses and to prepare for emerging and future challenges. These will\nnecessarily involve measures to ensure financial strength, improve management practices,\nstrengthen human resources for health, and strengthen the regulatory framework for public\nhealth including the development of sound environmental policies.\n1.  Health Sector Financing\n24. Health in Bhutan is an import-intensive sector that requires substantial foreign currency\nto finance essential drugs, vaccines, equipment, other medical supplies and training. In addition,\nthere is a growing concern about the accelerated rise in number and cost of out-of-country\nreferrals, mainly because of the increase of noncommunicable diseases such as cancer. For\ninstance, the cost of out-of-country treatment increased by more than three times during 1994-\n1999; out-of-country referrals now account for 5 percent of total health care expenditures. As\nthis  trend  and  the  increase  in  personnel  costs  continue,  without  increasing  budgetary\ncommitments, other areas of the budget, such as medical supplies, will continue to contract.\nCurrent  health  expenditure  patterns  have  also  revealed  inefficiencies  in  the  use  of  health\nservices due to the non-compliance with the referral system, with patients bypassing primary\nhealth facilities and referring themselves to district and national hospitals. In certain cases, this\npractice is exacerbated by the poor prescription and extensive use of free, nonessential, and\nlow-impact drugs, such as paracetamol and antacids and the irrational use of antibiotics. Such\npractices have contributed to the increase in health expenditures on nonessential drugs.\n25. The dependence on international aid to meet rising health expenditures is considerable,\nbut cannot be taken for granted over the long term. Although the Government expects to\ngenerate additional revenues through the export of hydropower and levy of personal income tax,\nthe health sector will still have to compete with other sectors for its share of the national budget.\nThus, longer term, sustainable solutions to financing health sector import requirements are\nessential and should now be explored by the Government. In addition, measures to improve the\nefficient use of resources and to contain costs should be introduced to promote more rational\nuse of health services and reduce wastage. The adoption of a social insurance scheme has\nbeen deemed inappropriate at this stage given current conditions, such as low GDP per capita,\nlack of a large enough formal wage and private sector, and the still predominantly rural and\ndispersed population. The costs of administering a scheme with limited population coverage are\nhigh. However, the Government is pursuing several financing options including (i) the recent", "7\ncreation of a BHTF as a sustainable financing mechanism to meet future import requirements of\nvaccines,  essential  drugs,  and  new  technologies;  and  (ii)  the  expansion  of  selected  user\ncharges for other nonessential services.\n2.  Health Management and Planning\n26. Although  the  health  management  system  has  been  strengthened  and  participatory\nplanning processes firmly established particularly with external assistance, there remains room\nfor improvement to ensure the equity and quality aspects of health care. Decentralized health\nmanagement  could  become  even  more  effective  when  this  is  accompanied  by  strong\ninstitutional capacity, integrated program reporting, and monitoring mechanisms at the central\nlevel. The existing health management information system (HMIS) functions well in comparison\nwith information systems in many other countries. However, the HMIS, which has evolved over\nthe years in an ad hoc fashion, suffers from duplication, complexity, lack of qualitative data and\nanalysis, and other inconsistencies. While health programs and plans have objectives with\nmeasurable and time-limited targets, deficiencies in the HMIS have undermined MOHE\u2019s ability\nto track progress in achieving these targets.\n27. In  addition,  reports  on  some  health  programs,  such  as  the  expanded  program  for\nimmunization, tuberculosis, and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are separately prepared.\nData need to be disaggregated by age, gender, and economic and minority group, and if\npopulation size warrants, by geographic area. A comprehensive strategic framework is needed\nto guide policy planning and monitoring functions, and to update the HMIS for better targeting of\nhealth programs and beneficiaries. There is also a need to strengthen the capacity of PPD,\nwhich  currently  lacks  adequate  staff  to  carry  out  its  planning,  monitoring  and  evaluation\nfunctions.\n28. Expenditure  reporting  requirements  are  also  numerous  due  to  the  various  funding\nagencies in the health sector; however, the current system for financial reporting does not link\nexpenditures to output of the programs and delivery system. The current budgetary reporting\nsystem is based on actual cash flows and does not cover the in-kind assistance of aid agencies.\nIt needs to be improved to take account of the magnitude of such a component and to enable a\nmore accurate evaluation of program delivery based on total investments, including donations in\nkind. Streamlining sector financial management would complement capacity-building efforts in\nthis area.\n3.  Human Resources for Health\n29. The shortage of human resources is a problem that affects all sectors in Bhutan. Despite\nGovernment efforts to provide out-of-country training since the 1960s, there remain critical\nshortages in many areas; this is particularly evident in the health sector where there is a\ncontinued reliance on expatriates and out-of-country treatment for specialist care. RCSC has\nprepared a human resource development (HRD) master plan for the Eighth Plan period with\ninputs from the various sectors. These sector plans were to be updated annually, but this\nrevision has yet to be completed by MOHE. As personnel are the key component of health\nexpenditures, changes in human resource planning have major impacts on overall expenditures.\nThe master plan is also used by RCSC to plan investments in out-of-country undergraduate\neducation. If the plan does not present an accurate reflection of the goals of the health sector,\nresources can be wasted by investing in the wrong areas. Updating of the HRD plan for the\nhealth sector is long overdue.", "8\n30. Certain gender bias exists in the selection and career structure of paramedical workers.\nBy definition, the health assistant, who has the supervisory role at the BHU, is male. This policy\nwas adopted due to difficulty assigning female health assistants in remote areas where travel to\nisolated villages is required. Thus, at present females cannot apply for training as a health\nassistant; therefore they are automatically prevented from advancing to the next position of\ndistrict health supervisory officer. This lack of equal opportunity in career and training needs to\nbe addressed when revising the HRD plan for the health sector. At the community level, there is\na need to promote the role of village health worker to help prevent its numbers from declining\nand to encourage more community participation.\n4.  Quality Assurance and Public Health Regulations\n31. MOHE has a well-established system of supervision of BHUs and district hospitals.\nHowever a significant weakness is evident in the lack of standardized guidelines and checklists.\nApart from this system for health facility supervision, quality assurance is lacking for the health\nsystem as a whole. There is a need, therefore, to develop the institutional capacity for promoting\nquality assurance.\n32. Bhutan\u2019s traditional and consensual society relies on a relatively informal system of rules\ngoverning all aspects of comportment of the population. Bhutan\u2019s legal system is evolving a\nsystem of formal and objective law. A number of laws, regulations, resolutions, endorsements,\nand  circulars  with  relevance  to  the  health  sector  exist;  they  are  promulgated  by  various\nministries, including MOHE, and more peripheral levels of government. However, little regulation\nexists for several issues of great public health importance. For instance, it is well known that the\nmost effective intervention to ensure the health of the newborn and infant is exclusive breast-\nfeeding.  While  breast-milk  substitutes  are  occasionally  required,  their  indiscriminate  use\ninvariably  results  in  increased  rates  of  diarrhea  and  increased  infant  mortality.  In  Bhutan,\ndiarrhea remains the second leading cause of infant mortality. Marketing of these products\nneeds to be regulated to ensure that breast-feeding is promoted, and that caregivers are aware\nof the dangers of using substitutes.\n33. Training of health professionals both in Bhutan and out-of-country is a top priority.\nHowever, to date, there is no system of regulation of professional competence (including basic\ntraining and continuing education) of health workers at any level; nor are there guidelines\nrelated to the ethical standards of the professions. Standardization of professional competence\nand conduct is crucial to the safe and effective functioning of a health system.\n34. Other specific areas of great public health importance for which little regulation exists\ninclude occupational health and safety, substance abuse (alcohol, tobacco, and betel), disposal\nof medical waste, environmental health related to urban development, and regulation of private\nsector health services (pharmacies, diagnostic facilities, and dental and eye services). The\nMinistry of Trade and Industry has promulgated some regulations regarding the sale of alcohol\nand pharmaceuticals, but these are of relatively limited scope.\n35. Until recently, laws, regulations, and other legal documents, although widely understood,\nhave not been compiled, catalogued and maintained. Also, while these legal documents may\nhave significant health ramifications, there is no system in place to ensure the participation of\nthe health sector in their formulation. Nor is there a formal mechanism to ensure that MOHE is\naware of their existence. The Government needs to overcome this institutional weakness in\norder to strengthen its regulatory function in the health sector.", "9\n5.  Gaps in Primary Health Care\n36. The huge program of infrastructure development over the past decade has resulted in a\nnear optimum level of health infrastructure at the primary level. The number of district and\nregional referral hospitals has significantly increased and their capacity improved. However,\nthere are certain gaps and other weaknesses in PHC6 which the Government must overcome\nsince  PHC  is  the  most  effective  and  direct  intervention  for  protecting  the  poor  and  other\nvulnerable  groups.  The  high  population  growth  rate  implies  that  reproductive  health  and\nimmunization programs deserve particular attention to benefit women and children. Currently,\nPHC  accounts  for  about  50  percent  of  total  recurrent  health  expenditures  (by  level),  and\nbudgetary  support  must  not  be  allowed  to  fall  below  this  level  if  future  gains  are  to  be\naccomplished. It is thus crucial for the Government to address some of the specific weaknesses\nidentified in the PHC system. The maternal mortality rate, halved between 1984 and 1994, is\nstill too high at 380; much of this mortality is due to the lack of adequate obstetrical care. Access\nto reproductive health services including essential obstetrical care and clinical family planning is\ncurrently limited by the lack of staff trained in surgery and anesthesia. Improvements in these\nservices would help to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality. Recent investigations by the\nEpidemiology and Research Unit have found that about 15 percent of hospital deliveries are of\nlow  birth  weight,  and  just  under  20  percent  of  under-fives  exhibit  moderate  to  severe\nmalnutrition.  Also,  there  is  a  high  prevalence  of  iron  deficiency  and  subclinical  vitamin  A\ndeficiency.\n37. As  in  most  developing  countries,  the  burden  of  infectious  disease  is  high.  Acute\nrespiratory tract infections (ARI) and diarrhea continue to be the most frequent diagnoses at\nBHUs and hospitals. In addition, the expanded program on immunization (EPI), already a\nsignificant factor in the reduction of childhood morbidity and mortality, is considering introducing\na vaccine against Haemophilus influenza b but the role of this pathogen in the etiology of ARI in\nBhutan is unknown. Because of the cost of the vaccine, understanding the significance of this\npathogen is crucial prior to introducing the new vaccine.\n38. While  access  to  allopathic  services  is  relatively  high,  access  to  traditional  medical\nservices is currently limited by the lack of indigenous units in six district hospitals. Improving\naccess to traditional medical services promotes social inclusion; those preferring these services\ntend to be the poorer, older and more rural sectors of the population. Also, timely referral and\nconsultations are critical to providing quality care including access to higher level professional\ncare. However, in Bhutan, equitable access to specialist services is restricted by the difficult\nterrain  and  poor  transport  system.  Telecommunications  and  Internet  facilities  to  allow\nconsultation between the peripheral facility and the national referral hospital should be pursued\nto  benefit  vulnerable  groups,  including  the  less  mobile,  old,  rural  population,  women,  and\nchildren.\n6.  Other Emerging Challenges\n39. The National STD/AIDS program was introduced in 1988. Alert to the threat of AIDS,\ndespite the absence of known cases in the country, Bhutan developed its first medium-term plan\nin 1990, with a second plan in 1995. By the end of 1998, there were only nine known HIV-\n6 PHC, the first level of health care for a community, generally includes preventive services, health education and\npromotion, reproductive health services, efforts to improve nutrition, and basic curative care such as treatment for\ndiarrhea, acute respiratory tract infection, and tuberculosis. The World Health Organization also considers the first-\nlevel referral hospital as part of the primary health care system.", "10\npositive cases, all but one were contracted outside of the country and four had died. Although\nthe incidence of HIV/AIDS has remained relatively low, many of the prerequisite conditions for\nthe introduction and spread of the disease are in evidence. There are a number of factors\nsuggesting that the potential for spread is significant: (i) Bhutan is surrounded by countries that\nare experiencing an alarming spread of AIDS, and there is significant human traffic through its\nporous borders, (ii) STD rates are at least 7 percent; much of this is in the adolescent age\ngroup, (iii) there is relatively low awareness of AIDS in the general population, (iv) commercial\nsex workers and intravenous drug users appear to be increasing in number.\n40. Given the potential for a rapid spread in Bhutan now that the virus has been introduced,\nthe Government is implementing an aggressive prevention and control program. However, the\nHIV/AIDS surveillance system, a crucial component of any control program is weak, and the\nmultisectoral task force, which oversees the effort has been relatively inactive.\n41. In addition to the rate of growth, aging of the population will have a significant impact on\nthe demand for health services and the type of health services required. As the population ages\nand economic development continues, there will be a shift from a pattern of predominantly\ninfectious diseases to a pattern of chronic degenerative diseases. This shift will be exacerbated\nby shifts in social and economic patterns, which will likely result in dietary changes, increased\nconsumption of alcohol and tobacco, and decreased physical activity. Chronic diseases such as\ncancer, diabetes, heart and lung disease, stroke, and cirrhosis will therefore become more\nprevalent with time. A recent report of the JDWNRH noted that 125 of the 545 patients sent for\nout-of-country treatment during the financial year 1998/1999 were cancer patients. Cervical\ncancer, the most common cancer among women in Bhutan, accounted for 7 percent of out-of-\ncountry referrals in 1998. Thus, Bhutan is faced with the dual challenges of overcoming the\nresidual  burden  of  communicable  diseases  and  the  growing  burden  of  noncommunicable\ndiseases, with its relatively limited financial resources.\nC. Government Objectives and Strategy\n42. During the Eighth Plan, the Government accords high priority to improving health care,\nwhich  is  seen  as  the  key  to  promoting  the  country\u2019s  social  and  economic  development.\nSpecifically, the Government aims to (i) intensify population planning activities, (ii) consolidate\nand strengthen existing health infrastructure, (iii) promote self-reliance and sustainability in the\nhealth  sector,  (iv)  strengthen  human  resource  development  for  effective  implementation  of\nhealth services, (v) enhance the quality of health care services, and (vi) extend health care\nservices to unreached areas. The midterm review of the health sector during the Eighth Plan\nrecommended that the Government continue its efforts to develop additional sources of health\nfinancing, address the acute shortage of specialist doctors and technicians, and strengthen the\ncurative and diagnostic capacity for timely treatment following the significant achievements in\npreventive  care.  As  the  physical  expansion  of  health  infrastructure  is  consolidated,  the\nGovernment is emphasizing improvements in the quality of health care.\n43. The Government\u2019s long-term vision of a Bhutan with gross national happiness as the\nultimate objective is articulated in the document, Bhutan 2020, A Vision for Peace, Prosperity\nand Happiness. Within this vision, the Government is committed to establishing a relevant and\ncost-effective  health  care  delivery  system  based  on  the  PHC  approach,  which  effectively\ndelivers health care services to all. While constant efforts will be made to deliver free health\ncare services on a cost-effective basis, the possibility of introducing some kind of cost-sharing\nwill be explored. The integrated PHC system will continue, with aspects of traditional medicine\ncomplementary to formal health care phased into the system. The establishment of innovative", "11\nsources of health financing, including the proposed BHTF is seen as a strategic approach to\nensuring sustainable financing of the Government\u2019s vaccinations and essential drugs program.\nTraining to ensure adequate Bhutanese personnel are available to staff the health system is\ngiven  high  priority.  The  Government  highlights  population  growth  as  one  of  its  greatest\nchallenges; the centerpiece of its policies to address this challenge is reproductive health care,\nincluding family planning.\nD. External Assistance to the Sector\n44. External assistance to the health sector is primarily provided by Denmark, India, United\nNations  Population  Fund  (UNFPA),  UNICEF,  and  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)\n(Appendix 4). Under the current five-year plan, Denmark, through the Danish International\nDevelopment  Agency,  supports  human  resource  development,  infrastructure  development,\nhealth  systems  management  (support  to  planning,  the  HMIS,  epidemiology  and  research,\ndistrict management, and the framework for multisectoral collaboration), strengthening of health\nservices  (public  health  programs,  maintenance,  and  logistics),  information,  education  and\ncommunication, and community participation. Extrabudgetary support is provided in the form of\nthree health advisers and funding of postgraduate training.\n45. India provides important assistance to the health sector. Its major contributions include\nfunding  for  the  National  Hospital  Program,  particularly  the  construction  and  expansion  of\nJDWNRH, and the Mongar, Trashi Yangtse and Lhuentse hospitals. India provides funding for\nthe National Malaria Control Program. Off-budget funding consists of assistance to its hospitals,\nand the financing and running of the India Bhutan Friendship Hospital. In addition India finances\nundergraduate training through RCSC in the fields of medicine, nursing, and dentistry.\n46. UNICEF,  UNFPA,  and  WHO  support  is  largely  directed  to  public  health  programs.\nUNICEF contributes for the construction and strengthening of ORCs, the EPI, safe motherhood,\nnutrition, diarrheal disease and ARI control, the VHW program and preservice training of PHC\nstaff. UNFPA has cofinanced the reproductive health program and the information, education\nand  communication  for  health  program.  Although  providing  less  than  10  percent  of  total\nfinancing in the health sector, WHO\u2019s support is wide ranging and covers the areas of nutrition,\nEPI,  reproductive  health,  communicable  diseases,  mental  health,  community-based\nrehabilitation, human resource development, health promotion, essential drugs, and quality\nassurance.\n47. Support from the Japan International Cooperation Agency is provided in kind in the form\nof equipment and vaccines. It contributes between $100,000 and $120,000 worth of vaccines\nand cold chain equipment to the health sector, through UNICEF, each year. The European\nUnion  has  also  contributed  to  the  development  and  improvement  of  quality  assurance  for\ntraditional and indigenous medicine. The German-Bhutan Hospital Foundation financed the\nconstruction of the Punakha District Hospital and continues to provide TA through an expatriate\nphysician.\n48. Consultations were held with major aid agencies at various stages of processing of the\nProgram, and information obtained, especially on lessons learned, was used to design the\nProgram\u2019s  policy  agenda.  Consequently,  the  proposed  loan  will  complement  assistance\nprovided by other major aid agencies, and help provide an enabling policy environment to\nenhance the effectiveness of the various health programs that are being assisted by these\nagencies.", "12\nE. ADB\u2019s Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n1. Strategy\n49. The  country  operational  strategy  aims  to  support  poverty  reduction  in  Bhutan  by\npromoting  economic  growth  and  social  inclusiveness  through  investments  in  human\ndevelopment. Therefore, the main thrust of poverty reduction efforts under the strategy is to\nenable the Government\u2019s commitment to be realized under the strategic theme of improving the\nquality of life for all. An important element is to help the Government create a more enabling\nenvironment to encourage and support private sector-led development. Within this framework,\nspecific ADB interventions will address constraints in physical infrastructure, particularly in road\ntransport  and  rural  energy,  financial  intermediation,  and  human  development  including  the\nshortage of skilled human resources.\n50. Investments in human development will be accompanied by policy support and capacity-\nbuilding activities to strengthen the Government\u2019s capacity to expand the scope and quality of\ntraditional social services in line with the demands of an evolving economy. ADB\u2019s strategy also\nrecognizes the need for the Government to strengthen its financial capacity to sustain its social\nsector programs. In the health sector, there is a need to put the long-term financing of health\nservices on a sustainable footing and to improve the quality of health care as well as the\nefficiency with which such health care is provided. The proposed ADB loan will support the\nintroduction  of  crucial  sector  reforms  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  the  country\u2019s  health\nprograms  and  strengthen  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  address  emerging  challenges  and\nissues in the health sector. By facilitating the development of alternative approaches to ensure\nsustainable financing in the health sector, the Program will contribute to improved governance,\nparticularly  in  domestic  resource  mobilization,  and  ultimately  contribute  to  overall  poverty\nreduction  efforts.  More  focused  targeting  of  beneficiaries  will  be  facilitated  by  the  poverty\nassessment study to be jointly conducted by the Government and ADB in 2000.\n2. Health Policy\n51. ADB\u2019s overall approach to the health sector is to assist its DMCs ensure their citizens\nhave broad access to basic preventive, promotive, and curative services that are efficacious,\ncost-effective, and affordable. Drawing upon previous ADB interventions in the health sector\nand  empirical  evidence  from  recent  research  and  observations,  the  strategy  will  focus  on\n(i) improving the health status of vulnerable groups, including the poor, women, children, and\nindigenous peoples with an emphasis on PHC; (ii) investing in projects and programs with\ntangible  and  measurable  results;  (iii)  supporting  innovative  approaches,  including  new\napproaches to health care financing and deployment of new technologies; (iv) encouraging\nDMC governments to take an appropriate and activist role in the health sector through much-\nneeded structural reforms; and (v) increasing the efficiency of health sector investments through\ncapacity-building, economic and sector work, and improved intersectoral linkages.\n52. Strong Government commitment and ownership are key to successful implementation of\nstructural reforms in the health sector. Pilot studies should be conducted to assess the impact of\nsuch user charges on vulnerable groups. The effective delivery of health programs can be\nenhanced through more efficient planning and the use of monitoring systems that can track\nperformance  targets.  New  institutional  mechanisms  for  quality  assurance  and  improved\nmanagement information systems are also critical for strengthening management capacity at\nthe central level, particularly when health services are decentralized.", "13\n53. ADB still has limited experience in the use of a trust fund approach as a mechanism for\nensuring sustainable financing of social development projects.7 However, trust fund approach\nwas used to establish the Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation (BTFEC) in 1992;\nthis was supported by a grant from the Global Environmental Fund and supervised by the World\nBank. The BTFEC was rated as satisfactory in the Implementation Completion Report of the\nWorld Bank. Key lessons learned from BTFEC implementation confirmed that the successful\nevolution  of  the  trust  fund  would  depend  on  (i)  the  existence  of  a  legal  framework  to\ninstitutionalize  collaboration  between  financiers  and  recipients,  and  make  management\naccountable and implementation more transparent; (ii) multistakeholder or aid participation;\n(iii) adequate start-up funding separate from investment income; (iv) relevant expertise in trust\nfund  management;  and  (v)  the  recipient  government\u2019s  strong  reputation  for  integrity  in\ngovernance and demonstrated commitment to the program. Such lessons from the BTFEC have\nbeen used by the Government to prepare the BHTF as an innovative sustainable financing\nfacility.\nV. THE PROGRAM\nA. Rationale\n54. Bhutan, a small landlocked country, is characterized by its mountainous terrain, high\npopulation growth rate and limited pool of skilled human resources, and economy that is still\nbasically agricultural despite signs of industrial growth and diversification.  The Government has\nalways accorded high priority to human development and has achieved remarkable progress in\nimproving the country\u2019s social indicators, particularly in education and health. Investments in\nhuman development will however remain critical to (i) improving the social well-being of its\npredominantly rural population, which is widely dispersed across the country; and (ii) providing\nthe much-needed human capital to support a growing economy. When viewed in this context,\nthe development of a healthy population provides the key to the country\u2019s sustained economic\ngrowth and poverty reduction efforts.\n55. With human development serving as the primary objective of its development strategy,\nthe Government is seeking to ensure continued progress in improving the health status of the\npopulation.  The  Government  recognizes  the  need  to  develop  (i)  a  comprehensive  policy\nframework to address structural weaknesses in the health sector, and (ii) a more forward-\nlooking blueprint to tackle new challenges and demands expected to emerge from the evolving\neconomy.  Specifically,  the  reform  agenda  is  aimed  at  enhancing  efficiency  in  resource\nallocation; ensuring equitable access to PHC services; and strengthening the planning and\nmanagement capacity, and regulatory framework for the health sector.\n56. Sustainability of health sector financing is a key feature of the Program; other sectors\nare bound to claim an increasing share of the Government budget as the economy expands and\nthe population continues to grow rapidly. It is inevitable that the Government must explore\ninnovative and sustainable ways of financing a potential resource gap in the health sector and to\nhelp reduce dependence on external assistance. In addition, the Government must protect and\nstrengthen its core health program to address PHC needs of vulnerable groups, particularly\nwomen and children. Thus, in this connection, the Government is setting up the BHTF as a\nsustainable financing mechanism to meet the requirements of vaccines and essential drugs,\n7 The trust fund approach is used in Loan 1693-TUV: Island Development Program, for $4 million, approved on\n13 July 1999.", "14\nwhich are key components of PHC. By incorporating policy initiatives that will ensure a more\nfocused approach in addressing equity aspects and targeting specific vulnerable groups, the\nProgram  will  strengthen  the  partnership  between  the  Government  and  ADB  on  poverty\nreduction.\n57. The  Health  Care  Reform  Program  encompasses  major  policy  measures  that  will\ncollectively promote a more enabling environment for the Government to pursue its ongoing and\nfuture  health  programs.  The  Program  was  designed  in  consultation  with  other  major  aid\nagencies, and its implementation is expected to enhance the effectiveness of their various\nhealth programs. ADB\u2019s timely intervention through the proposed program loan has already laid\nthe groundwork for institutionalizing a more coordinated approach among aid agencies, which at\npresent  rely  on  an  informal  monthly  luncheon  meeting  for  networking  to  coordinate  their\nactivities.8 With its sectorwide coverage and inputs from other aid agencies, the Program has\ninitiated the process for advancing a more structured and coordinated approach among aid\nagencies for addressing health sector issues, which are expected to become more complex\nover time in view of changing social, cultural, and economic circumstances.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n58. The  principal  objective  of  the  Program  is  to  provide  support  for  the  Government\u2019s\ncomprehensive reform agenda for strengthening the health sector. Its scope includes five policy\npriority areas: (i) develop sustainable financing for the health sector; (ii) strengthen capacity in\nhealth  sector  management;  (iii)  strengthen  quality  assurance  and  public  health  regulatory\nfunctions; (iv) adjust imbalances in human resources for health; and (v) strengthen PHC through\nselective PHC interventions and expansion of priority services. The Government\u2019s intention to\nimplement the Program is summarized in the development policy letter (DPL), as presented in\nAppendix 5. Discussions were held between the Government and the ADB on the various\nspecific policy reform measures that will be implemented as part of the Program. These policy\nactions,  together  with  the  indicative  timing  of  their  implementation  are  highlighted  in  the\nsupporting policy matrix attached to the DPL in Appendix 5.\nC. Policy Framework and Actions\n59. The policy framework and its specific actions included in the Program was designed\nthrough  a  participatory  process  that  involved  field  surveys,  focus  group  discussions,  and\nconsultations with other stakeholders, including the major aid agencies for the health sector in\nBhutan. As a result, the reforms and specific policy initiatives detailed in the policy matrix are\nconsistent with the Government\u2019s own development objective, and will complement the health\nprograms of the international aid community in Bhutan. In formulating the Program, particular\nattention was paid to equity and gender issues, and to the needs of specific vulnerable groups.\nA  multisectoral  approach  was  used  to  identify  and  develop  some  of  the  intended  policy\nmeasures, in view of the linkages between sectors and their impact on health.\n8 The current practice has proved to be inadequate for coordinating the various discrete programs of the different aid\nagencies as it falls short of addressing Bhutan\u2019s health sector issues on a sectorwide or systemwide basis. This\nshortcoming in aid coordination is highlighted in Report on the Evaluation of Danish Support to the Health Sector in\nBhutan 1990-1998 by Danish International Development Agency.", "15\n1.  Develop Sustainable Financing for the Health Sector\n60. The high population growth rate, competing global and domestic demands for funding,\nan economy in transition, and rising costs in the provision of social services, including health are\nchallenging the capacity of Bhutan to continue to provide free health and other medical services\nto its citizens. The Government is aware that the lack of sustainable financing would derail its\nvarious  health  programs  and  undermine  the  quality  of  health  care  in  the  country.  In  this\nconnection, it is adopting a two-pronged strategy to develop alternative sources of financing and\nimprove efficiency of resource use including cost containment.\n61. Bhutan\u2019s current stage of economic development does not make privatization of health\ncare delivery feasible given its limited and nascent private sector. The Government remains\ncommitted to make free health care accessible to all segments of society, and is responsible for\nthe training of health workers. However, the Government expects a wider scope for private\nfinancing of health care to promote sustainable financing and to encourage rational use of\nhealth services. It intends to introduce more user fees. As part of the Program, surveys on\nhousehold  health  care  expenditure  and  attitudes  user  payment  will  be  conducted,  and\nconsultations with stakeholders on health services will be held initially to determine the scope of\nhealth services to be deemed essential services. The findings of these surveys will be used as\nthe basis for designing a pilot study that will assess the feasibility of introducing user charges in\na phased manner, while ensuring that there will be no impact on access to such essential health\nservices (including those under traditional health care services) identified by the surveys. Based\non the information from this study, a user charge policy including a proposed fee structure will\nbe drawn up for public discussions prior to its implementation in the Ninth Five-Year Plan or the\nNinth Plan (FY2003-FY2007). This will include the clear identification of services that will be\nsubject to user charges; their respective prices (based on a combination of analyses of cost,\nand willingness and ability to pay); and, individuals or groups, who are to be exempt (partially or\nfully) from paying charges. In addition, the study will provide an assessment of the potential\nrevenues,  the  impact  on  the  behavior  of  those  seeking  health  care,  and  the  capacity  to\nimplement the scheme.\n62. The Program will also explore the possibility of introducing some market mechanisms\nwithin the publicly financed system to secure additional efficiency gains. One option is to assess\nthe feasibility of contracting health-related services to the private sector. This will involve a\nmarket analysis for the private sector of ancillary, pharmaceutical, and other medical-related\nservices to assess their ability to carry out services for the Government under contract, and will\ninclude a close examination of capacity, licensing, regulation, and incentive structures.\n63. The Program will also assist the Government in mobilizing additional resources through\ninnovative financing mechanisms for the health sector. The Government recently established\nthe BHTF on the basis of a Royal Charter (Appendix 6). The trust fund mechanism for the health\nsector was conceived with technical advice from WHO, following the Government\u2019s experience\nwith the successful BTFEC, which was launched in 1992 with multi-donor funding support and\nTA from several external sources. The BHTF will be developed as a sustainable financing\nmechanism that is expected to generate funds to cover the annual expenditures on essential\ndrugs, vaccines, and new technologies, which are expected to increase from $0.9 million in\n1999 to $2.3 million in 2008 (Appendix 7). The Government has given its assurance that the\nBHTF  will  adopt  internationally  acceptable  practices  in  fund  administration  and  investment\nmanagement.", "16\n64. In addition, the Government will adopt specific policy initiatives to improve allocative\nefficiency and contain costs, while ensuring equity in the provision of health services. Initially,\nthe Government will adopt a policy advocating the use of poverty incidence as one of the criteria\nfor resource allocation to ensure equity in public financing of health services. The poverty\nindicators  and  other  data  to  be  generated  by  a  new  HMIS  and  the  findings  of  the  joint\nGovernment  and  ADB  poverty  assessment  exercise  will  then  be  used  to  allocate  health\nresources during the Ninth Plan. To meet future challenges, a situation analysis of chronic\ndegenerative diseases will be conducted in 2001 to gain an understanding of their financial\nimplications for the health budget. A study of the projected need for and cost implications of out-\nof-country training and medical treatment will also be carried out in 2001.\n65. The Government will also improve its financial and budgeting procedures to address\ninefficient use of resources in the health sector. This will involve the use of recurrent cost\nanalysis on major capital investment as a standard planning tool in the health sector to facilitate\npriority setting and decision making on the basis of cost-effectiveness.\n2. Strengthen Capacity in Health Sector Management\n66. The Government\u2019s capacity to effectively manage, plan, and monitor its multiple health\nprograms under a decentralized system has been constrained by shortage of staff to conduct\nresearch and by the deficiencies in its management information system. To overcome these\nshortcomings,  capacity-building  efforts  will  be  carried  out  through  the  introduction  of  a\ncomprehensive strategic planning framework for relevant health programs. For instance, the\nGovernment has already taken steps to assess the relevance of integrating separately managed\nhealth programs on ARI and control of diarrheal diseases under the purview of a program for\nintegrated management of childhood illness. In addition, the Government has developed a\nrestructuring  plan  to  strengthen  MOHE\u2019s  PPD  through  the  proposed  creation  of  a  new\nmonitoring and evaluation section. This will follow the restructuring of MOHE into two separate\nministries in 2002. However, as part of the Program, the process of recruiting qualified staff will\nbe started as soon as possible to ensure that such staff will be available in a timely manner\nunder the country\u2019s civil service system. The proposed monitoring and evaluation section is\nexpected to play an important role in ensuring that the data and other reports submitted by the\ndistrict and village health offices are consistent and discrepancies are minimized.\n67. While current MOHE plans have measurable, time-based indicators, there is difficulty in\ntracking them due to deficiencies within the HMIS. Hence, the Program seeks to address these\nproblems to make more reliable, useful, and timely information available. The Government is\ncurrently reviewing the HMIS with the assistance of the Government of Denmark and it is\nexpected that an upgraded HMIS will be installed by 2001. This improved HMIS will help\n(i) identify program beneficiaries more clearly and (ii) design appropriate programs to meet their\nneeds. With an upgraded HMIS, the Government will be able to ensure that its existing health\ninfrastructure will continue to serve a catchment area of an appropriate population size.\n68. Past capital investments have resulted in a broad network of hospitals and BHUs.\nHowever, little attention was paid to developing a maintenance program to support the existing\nhealth infrastructure. The Program will develop a routine inspection and maintenance program\nfor health facilities. This policy initiative is particularly important as the Government moves to\nconsolidate its capital investment program; promote a more rational use of health facilities,\nincluding the referral system; and contain overall costs. The maintenance program should be\nincorporated as part of the new financial management and planning procedures that will be", "17\nadopted  to  enhance  management  efficiency,  and  promote  greater  transparency  and\naccountability.\n3. Strengthen Quality Assurance and Public Health Regulatory Functions\n69. Until recently, the organizational structure of MOHE did not include a central or focal unit\nthat is responsible for ensuring the quality of health care services and the management of\nprograms and activities. Under the Program, the Government, on the basis of a review of its\nmanagement approach, created a quality assurance focal point within MOHE that will have the\nmandate to promote a shift to more results-based management. One of the key tasks of this\nquality assurance center is to introduce the logistics system for the proper inventory of essential\ndrugs to monitor their availability, and usage, and expiration date.\n70. Regulatory function, an essential component of public health systems, remains relatively\nundeveloped in Bhutan and hence needs to be strengthened. As part of the Program, a focal\npoint was recently established within MOHE to assume responsibility for coordinating public\nhealth regulation. This focal point will (i) ensure that health sector input is obtained in the\ndrafting  of  legislation  and  regulations  related  to  health,  and  enforcement  of  legislation  is\nstrengthened;  and  (ii)  be  responsible  for  disseminating  all  appropriate  public  health  legal\ninstruments. To achieve this task, a central repository was recently set up to compile, catalogue,\nand update all existing and future legal instruments with a bearing on the health sector.\n71. The creation of focal points for quality assurance and public health regulations will\nenable MOHE to draft important laws and regulations for public health in a more timely manner.\nIt will also help ensure that relevant health inputs are incorporated in other important legislation\ndrafted for other sectors such as industry. For instance, the lack of a focal point has hampered\nthe  legislation  for  creating  a  professional  body  for  accrediting  and  regulating  the  health\nprofession with a goal of raising professional standards and enforcing professional codes of\nethics. In this connection, the Program will facilitate the drafting of the legislation for the creation\nof the Bhutan medical and health council for approval by the Council of Ministers in 2001. The\nGovernment will also complete a situation analysis on the health-related and safety issues in the\nindustry and business sectors in 2001. This study will serve as the basis for future legislation for\nan Occupational Health and Safety Act in the Ninth Five-Year Plan, and contribute to the\ndevelopment  of  the  legal  framework  that  is  needed  in  line  with  economic  growth  and\ndiversification.\n72. Specific regulations to regulate the marketing of breast-milk substitutes, and for tobacco,\nand alcohol control will also be put in place. Currently, the Government itself has not enacted\nany stringent regulation on the control of tobacco, and alcohol sales in the country, except for\nsubjecting such imports (except those from India) to the maximum duty and sales tax rates.\nHowever, many districts and villages, on their own initiative, have banned the sale of tobacco\nand discouraged its use in line with Buddhist religious belief. These regulations are expected to\npromote  healthier  lifestyles  and  will  complement  the  Government\u2019s  continuing  use  of\nappropriate taxation policies to reduce the consumption of tobacco and alcohol, and to promote\npublic health.\n73. Environmental  health  will  also  be  strengthened  through  the  Program.  Residents,\nparticularly children, living close to health facilities, are exposed to health hazards arising from\nthe disposal of hospital waste. The Government will strictly enforce an improved system for the\nproper  disposal  of  medical  waste  in  hospitals  and  other  health  facilities.  Environmental", "18\nguidelines for urban and community development projects will also be adopted to contain their\nadverse developmental impact on health.\n4. Adjust Imbalances in Human Resources for Health\n74. One of the major limitations to the provision of adequate health services in Bhutan has\nbeen the lack of sufficient health workers of all categories. The Government has exerted efforts\nto train more Bhutanese nationals to staff the various categories, including specialist positions\nthat are currently filled by expatriates. The Government recently carried out a review of gender\nequity to address the concerns of female health staff and patients. The Government will also\nencourage community participation in the delivery of basic health services by optimizing the role\nof village health workers, who have made significant contributions.\n75. A major undertaking to adjust imbalances in human resources for health is to revise and\nupdate the current Master Plan for Human Resources in Health (MPHRH) to reflect current and\nprojected personnel requirements in various disciplines, grade levels, and geographic areas. An\nupdated MPHRH will also address personnel issues more effectively, as personnel are the key\ncomponent of health expenditures. RCSC also uses the MPHRH for planning investments in\nout-of-country education; thus the MPHRH needs to present a more accurate assessment of\nhealth personnel requirements to ensure that resources are efficiently used. In this connection,\nthe MPHRH will be reviewed and updated. The Government will also adopt a policy to help\nensure that all BHUs include female staff who can provide services to female patients. Female\nstaffing in health units is particularly critical to address the high maternal mortality rate in\nBhutan.\n5.  Strengthen PHC Through Selective Interventions and Expanding Priority\nServices\n76. To demonstrate its continuing commitment to PHC, the Government will adopt policies to\nstrengthen  PHC  through  selective  interventions  and  expanding  priority  services  to  benefit\nvulnerable groups and underserved areas. The Government has reactivated the Multisectoral\nTask Force on STD/HIV issues, which has not met since its establishment in 1998. This will\nensure its active participation in promoting political and social awareness on such issues and\nhelp strengthen the HIV/AIDS surveillance system. Additional resources will also be committed\nto intensify information, education and communication activities on substance abuse, including\nalcohol,  tobacco,  and  betel  nut.  This  will  involve  increased  community  involvement,\ncollaboration  with  the  media,  and  development  of  health  promotion  materials  for  wider\ndissemination to target groups.\n77. To  ensure  effective  delivery  of  PHC,  the  Government  will  maintain  recurrent\nexpenditures, as a percentage share of total health sector budget, at or above the level of\n1998/99 during the Program period. Within the total health recurrent expenditures, the share of\nrecurrent budget allocated to PHC will not be allowed to fall below 50 percent to facilitate the\nimplementation and expansion of selected PHC interventions, such as (i) increasing the number\nof  hospitals  providing  comprehensive  reproductive  health  services,  including  emergency\nobstetrical care and clinical family planning in underserved areas from four to eight; and (ii) a\ntelemedicine pilot project that links the Mongar District Hospital with the JDWNRH in Thimphu.\n78. In addition, the expanded immunization program may need to be strengthened. As part\nof  the  Program,  the  Government  will  carry  out  a  study  to  determine  the  importance  of\nHaemophilus influenza b in the epidemiology of acute respiratory tract infections. In recognition", "19\nof the cultural aspects of traditional medicine in Bhutan, six more indigenous units will be\nestablished so that all district hospitals will have such units by 2002. This is in line with the\npolicy objective to provide traditional health care to segments of society seeking this health\ncare.\nD. Social and Environmental Issues\n79. The Program will support the Government to continue its PHC program, which has the\npoor, women, and children as major beneficiaries. A considerable emphasis on provision of\nservices to these vulnerable groups is demonstrated through the Government\u2019s commitment to\nmaintain the share of recurrent expenditures on PHC at about 50 percent of total health sector\nrecurrent expenditures. The commitment of the Government to develop the traditional health\ncare system as part of publicly provided services shows their concern to meet the perceived\nneeds and demands of the population. The Program will ensure that Government commitment\nto both PHC and traditional health care will continue.\n80. The Program includes reform measures that will improve resource allocation, while\nefficiency gains derived from the reforms will free up resources to address increasing access to\nservices in unserved areas, and unmet demands for health care such as maternal and child\nhealth care. Appropriate policy measures through budgetary allocation have been incorporated\nto ensure that any negative impact on the poor will only have a short-term effect of the reform\nprocess. The policy reform to strengthen human resources will ensure gender equity in training\nand career opportunities. This policy will lead to an increase in the number of female health\nworkers, help break down barriers to women\u2019s access to health care, and thus improve the\nhealth status of women and children. The emphasis on reproductive health services, including\nthe establishment of more emergency obstetrical care facilities at district hospitals, will reduce\nmaternal mortality.\n81. The Program will also yield positive environmental benefits. As part of the Program,\nenvironmental codes of practice will be developed to improve urban sanitation and solid waste\nmanagement, including medical waste from hospitals and health facilities. The Government will\nstrictly enforce regulations covering the proper disposal and treatment of medical waste. The\nincorporation  of  environmental  health  aspects  in  the  preparation  of  urban  development\nguidelines will lead to improved environmental quality.\nVI. THE PROPOSED LOAN\nA.  Amount of Loan and Source of Funds\n82. The Government has requested that the ADB provide a loan of $10.0 million from its\nSpecial Funds resources. The cost of implementing the necessary key policies and reform\nmeasures is estimated at $10.0 million over five years (FY2001-FY2005), which will run through\nthe  first  half  of  the  Ninth  Plan  (FY2003-FY2007).  This  covers  mainly  the  development  of\nsustainable health sector financing mechanisms excluding the capitalization requirements of the\nBHTF;  budgetary  commitment  to  PHC;  capacity  building  for  health  sector  management,\nincluding the adoption of new management planning tools and techniques; capacity-building\nactivities in quality assurance and public health regulations; and improved human resource\ndevelopment programs. The Government confirmed that the cost of the Program, to be incurred\nover five years, will not seriously impair its comfortable fiscal position, where prudent fiscal\nmanagement has enabled the Government to keep the budget deficit at a minimum. Moreover,", "20\nsome funds have already been set aside to help capitalize the BHTF, while revenues from\nhydroelectric projects and the introduction of user fees for nonessential health services will\nsupport its sound fiscal position.\nB. Interest, Maturity, and Utilization Period\n83. The proposed loan will have a repayment period of 24 years, including a grace period of\n8 years. An interest rate of 1 percent will be charged per annum during the grace period and 1.5\npercent per annum thereafter. The proposed loan is to be disbursed in two tranches. The first\ntranche of $5.0 million will be made available upon loan effectiveness, while the second tranche\nof $5.0 million will be made available following the Government\u2019s compliance with the conditions\nset out in the Loan Agreement. The policy matrix in Appendix 5 lists the conditions for the\nrelease of the two tranches.\nC. Implementation Arrangements\n84. MOHE will be the Executing Agency for the Program.9 MOHE will organize and chair an\ninterministerial steering committee (ISC) with representation from other Government ministries\nand offices that have a stake in the policy matrix. These will include the Ministry of Finance,\nPlanning  Commission  Secretariat,  Ministry  of  Trade  and  Industry,  National  Environment\nCommission, and Royal Civil Service Commission. The ISC will serve as a coordinating and\nmonitoring mechanism, provide policy oversight in program implementation, and meet not less\nthan once every quarter before all second tranche conditions are satisfied. The ISC will be\nsupported by a program management unit (PMU) to be established within MOHE. It was agreed\nthat a director will head the PMU as program director. The PMU will be responsible for the day-\nto-day monitoring of progress in meeting the policy actions required for the release of the two\ntranches. The PMU will prepare program implementation progress reports for the ISC. The\nprogress reports will be provided to ADB on a quarterly basis. The organizational structure of\nMOHE (Department of Health) is shown in Appendix 8.\nD. Procurement\n85. The loan will finance the full foreign exchange costs, excluding local duties and taxes, of\nimports procured in and from ADB\u2019s member countries, other than those specified in the list of\nineligible items and those items financed by other multilateral and bilateral official sources.\nProcurement of eligible items under ADB\u2019s loan will be based on normal commercial practices\nfor  procurement  by  the  private  sector,  or  standard  Government  procurement  procedures\nacceptable to ADB for procurement by the public sector. In the case of goods commonly traded\non  international  commodity  markets,  procurement  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with\nprocedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB.\nE. Disbursement\n86. The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed against a broad range of imports, subject to a\nnegative list of items, shown in Appendix 9. The loan will be disbursed until 30 September 2002\nand can be used to finance eligible expenditures incurred up to 180 days prior to the date of\nloan  effectiveness.  On  the  basis  of  ADB\u2019s  simplified  procedures  for  the  disbursement  of\nprogram  loans,  the  Borrower  will  be  required  to  submit  with  each  withdrawal  request  a\n9 Under the Government restructuring plan, MOHE is expected to be restructured into the Ministry of Health and the\nMinistry of Education by 2002.", "21\ncertification confirming the Borrower\u2019s compliance with the following formula for the period\ncovered by the withdrawal request: for each year in which the proceeds of the loan are expected\nto be disbursed, the value of the country\u2019s total imports minus (i) imports from nonmember\ncountries,  (ii)  ineligible  imports,  and  (iii)  imports  financed  under  other  official  development\nassistance. This must be equal to or greater than the amounts expected to be disbursed during\nthe year. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy\nof the Borrower\u2019s certification.\nF. Counterpart Funds\n87. The Government has indicated that the proceeds of the proposed loan will be used to\nhelp meet the funding requirements of the BHTF. The Government has agreed that any local\ncurrency proceeds generated by the proposed loan (counterpart funds) will be used to support\nthe development of the health sector in general and the reforms to be initiated or implemented\nunder the policy framework of the Program.\nG. Monitoring and Tranching\n88. The proceeds of ADB\u2019s loan will be released in two tranches when ADB is assured that\nthe conditions for their release are satisfied. As the Government has complied with the initial\nactions designed as part of the Program, the first tranche of $5.0 million will be made available\nupon  loan  effectiveness.  It  is  envisaged  that  the  second  tranche  for  $5.0  million  will  be\ndisbursed about one year after the release of the first tranche, subject to the fulfillment by the\nGovernment of the specific conditions for its release, as detailed in the policy matrix, including\nsatisfactory progress in implementing the overall Program.\n89. Program  implementation  will  be  monitored  closely  by  the  Government  by  the  ISC\nthrough its meetings and progress reports, and by ADB through its regular loan review missions.\nSpecific performance indicators, based on existing available data, have been developed to\nassist with monitoring; these will be improved as soon as the findings of the April 2000 health\nsector survey are compiled, analyzed, and officially released. The Government has agreed to\nuse the annual health conference as part of the feedback mechanism for assessing the impact\nof the Program on beneficiary groups, including the poor. Poverty and other socioeconomic data\ngenerated by the Government-ADB poverty assessment study will be used to develop baseline\nindicators to monitor the poverty impact of the Program.\n90. A midterm review of the Program, including its impact on poverty and vulnerable groups,\nwill be carried out jointly by the Government and ADB in 2003. A program completion report will\nbe prepared by the Government not later than three months following program completion in\n2005. The report will include an evaluation of the benefits of the Program based on the baseline\nindicators developed through the data generated by the April 2000 health sector survey and the\nGovernment-ADB poverty assessment study.\nVII. PROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS\nA. Benefits and Beneficiaries\n91. The Program provides a long-term strategic vision for the Government to improve the\nhealth status of the Bhutanese population and strengthen its capacity to cope with emerging\nchallenges and issues in the health sector of an evolving economy. The Program focuses on", "22\ndeveloping the software aspects of the health system in Bhutan to enhance the efficiency and\nquality of health care. This will complement the massive capital investment program that has\nenabled the Government to provide health services to at least 90 percent of the population.\nConcurrently, the Program accords continued emphasis to the PHC system, as it covers a\npackage of basic services that have been proven to provide significant benefits to the vulnerable\ngroups, including the poor, women, and children. Investments in health enhance human well-\nbeing,  and  will  generate  benefits  that  extend  to  increased  productivity,  increased  learning\ncapacity of school children, and increased efficiency in resource allocation; these free up limited\nresources that would otherwise be used for the more costly treatment of disease. Adoption of\nrecurrent  cost  analysis  and  improved  financial  management  and  reporting  procedures  will\ncontribute to overall efficiency in health expenditures. The Program is thus justified on the\ngrounds of efficiency and equity.\n92. Institutional  strengthening  is  another  major  benefit  that  will  be  generated  by  the\nProgram. The Program will accelerate the development of human resources needed for the\nmanagement and delivery of health services to the dispersed population. The Program will raise\nthe professional standards of health workers, strengthen the capacity to improve the quality of\nhealth care, and introduce a more efficient way to target beneficiaries of the various health\nprograms. The Program will effectively address concerns over the increasing cost of health care\nin Bhutan. The Program includes specific policy measures to develop more sustainable and\ninnovative mechanisms for health financing and to contain costs, which have been increasing at\nan alarming rate and threaten the Government\u2019s capacity to ensure adequate resources for its\nhealth programs.\n93. The  Program  also  directly  supports  the  development  of  a  policy  and  regulatory\nframework  to  strengthen  public  health  and  promote  healthy  behavior.  This  will  help  the\nGovernment reduce the burden of disease through more public regulations and an intensified\ninformation campaign aimed at reducing substance abuse (e.g., tobacco and alcohol) and use\nof betel nut, promoting breast-feeding, and preventing the spread of STD/HIV. Influencing\npeople\u2019s choice of healthy behavior would have community-wide advantages and yield specific\nbenefits to specific vulnerable groups. For example, regulating the proper marketing of breast-\nmilk substitutes (or alternatively promoting breast-feeding) can have dramatic benefits for child\nhealth through the reduced incidence of diarrhea. The introduction of occupational health and\nsafety guidelines will reduce the incidence of industrial accidents in the workplace.\n94. Although  the  Program  will  generally  lead  to  improved  health  status  of  the  entire\nBhutanese population, there will be benefits that will directly accrue to specific groups. The\nemphasis on PHC will directly benefit the poor, women, children, and rural communities that still\nrely on indigenous or traditional medicine. Bhutan\u2019s labor force will generally benefit with a safer\nwork environment, while female health workers will be granted equal opportunities in career\nadvancement and training.\nB. Poverty Reduction\n95. Investments in health promote human development and help advance the goals of social\nand economic development. Improved health status of the population is an essential component\nof any strategy to reduce poverty. For the poor who are most likely to be involved in physical\nlabor as their main source of livelihood and income, good health is a most important asset and\nthe major determinant of earning capacity. However, the burden of disease is disproportionately\nborne by the poor, who are more at risk to communicable diseases. In addition, the income of\nthe poor is significantly reduced once they become ill. Economic gains from investments in", "23\nhealth programs will thus be greater for the poor than for the nonpoor. This general observation\nis also relevant in the case of the Program wherein policy measures and specific interventions in\nPHC  will  contribute  to  the  improved  health  status  of  the  poor  and  accompanying  rise  in\nproductivity and income. The World Bank estimated that a decrease in under-five mortality of\n1.0 percent is associated with a 1.24 percent increase in per capita income growth.10\n96. The  poverty  impact  assessment  indicates  that  the  Program  was  developed  with\nconsideration to the plight of vulnerable groups in Bhutan (Appendix 10). The assessment\nconcludes that the overall impact on the poor is strongly positive. The use of poverty indicators\nas one of the criteria in resource allocation to ensure equity in public health financing will enable\nthe Government to adopt a more focused approach in targeting poverty groups in its health\nprograms. Specific PHC policy interventions will also reap substantial benefits for the poor. For\ninstance, improving access to emergency obstetrical care centers in underserved areas and\nassigning female health workers to BHUs will greatly benefit poor women who face higher risk\nof  maternal  mortality.  Establishing  more  indigenous  medicine  units  at  district  hospitals  will\nimprove access to health care for the rural poor who continue to embrace traditional medicine.\nStrengthening of the HIV/AIDS surveillance system will be of advantage to women who are\nbiologically more vulnerable to STD and HIV infection, and to the poor who are generally more\nlikely to be involved in commercial sex. The study on Haemophilus influenza b vaccine for its\npossible inclusion in the EPI is a move that will eventually benefit children since ARI is one of\nthe leading causes of infant mortality in Bhutan.\nC. Risks and Safeguards\n97. The Program was formulated on the basis of the Government\u2019s continued commitment\nto accord priority to the health sector, including budgetary and human resources. Any major\nchange in the policy direction of the Government, caused by weakening macroeconomic and\nfiscal position could delay the implementation of policy actions as originally intended. Policy\ndiscussions between ADB and the Government at the ministerial level have revealed that the\ncountry\u2019s  development  policy,  anchored  on  the  principles  of  social  justice  and  equity,  will\ncontinue to accord budgetary priority to the social sectors, including health. The continuing\nsupport  from  the  major  external  funding  in  Bhutan\u2019s  health  programs  will  provide  another\nsafeguard against any derailment of the Program due to an economic downturn.\n98. Various Government ministries and offices are involved in implementing the Program,\ngiven its intersectoral nature. The lack of coordination of these ministries could delay program\nimplementation. The creation of the ISC with representation from all concerned ministries to\nprovide policy oversight and coordination will help minimize this risk. The PMU at MOHE will\nprovide technical support. Regular ADB review missions will also support these coordination\nefforts.\n99. There will be some risks associated with implementing specific policy measures. The\nintroduction of user fees may serve as a barrier and deter would-be patients, including the poor,\nfrom seeking health services. To minimize this risk, the Government has agreed to conduct a\npilot study, including a willingness-to-pay component, to ensure that such a policy measure will\nbe limited to nonessential services and will have no adverse impact on access to essential\nservices. Prior to the introduction of such user fees, the Government will conduct intensive\nmarketing and educational campaigns to explain the need to develop sustainable financing\n10Cited in ADB. 1999. Policy for the Health Sector. Manila.", "24\nmechanisms. Various media will be used and public discussions will be held with community\ngroups. Full information on the proposed fee structure will be provided during the information\ncampaign. In addition, exemption and adjustment mechanisms and monitoring methods will be\nincorporated in the user fee policy.\n100. Finally, there is the risk that the BHTF may not be able to achieve its revenue targets\ndue  to  poor  market  performance,  a  risk  that  applies  to  all  trust  funds.  In  addition  to  the\nengagement  of  a  professional  fund  manager,  the  Government  will  adopt  other  prudent\nmeasures  to  safeguard  its  investment  in  the  BHTF.  These  include  (i)  the  setting  of  clear\nguidelines in the Royal Charter and in its contract with the fund manager to govern the permitted\nlevel of risk and nature of investments, (ii) the use of appropriate international benchmarks as\nthe basis for measuring the fund manager\u2019s performance, and (iii) the setting of limits on the\nextent for drawing down the principal of the BHTF.\nVIII. ASSURANCES\n101.

This high population growth rate will eventually erode economic\ngrowth  and  poverty  reduction  by  restricting  savings  and  investment.  Public  health\nconcerns  have  also  emerged  with  regard  to  use  of  alcohol  and  betel  nut,  increased\nsmoking and the potential spread of HIV/AIDS. Effectively addressing these challenges\nwill require adequate financial resources, improved management practices, strengthened\nhuman resources for health and effective public health regulations to be enforced.\n4. As stated in the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1997-2002), the RGoB accords high priority to\nimproving health care, which is seen as the key to promoting the social and economic\ndevelopment of the country. Specifically, the Government aims to (i) intensify population\nplanning  activities;  (ii)  consolidate  and  strengthen  existing  health  infrastructure;\n(iii) promote self-reliance and sustainability in the health sector; (iv) strengthen human\nresource development for effective implementation of health services; (v) enhance the\nquality of health care services; and (vi) extend health care services to those unreached\nareas. It is the intention of the RGoB to address long-term strategic issues through a\nhealth care reform program.\n5. The proposed health care reform program (the Program), which will run during a five-\nyear period (2000-2005) has five key objectives: (i) developing sustainable financing in\nthe health sector, (ii) strengthening capacity for health management, (iii) strengthening\nquality assurance and public regulatory functions, (iv) adjusting imbalances in human\nresources for health, and (v) strengthening primary health care (PHC). The Program will\ninclude specific reform measures to address priority issues in health service planning,\nmonitoring and implementation as shown in the attached Policy Matrix. We believe that\nthe proposed program will contribute to the realization of the vision of a Bhutan 2020\nwhen access to health care is no longer an issue and when a strong and self-financing\nhealth system has been developed to promote human development objectives including\nincreased productivity and poverty reduction.\n1. Developing Sustainable Financing for Health Care\n6. Given the recent substantial investment in health infrastructure and expected rise in\nrecurrent expenditures, the RGoB is aware of the urgent need to put long term financing\nof health care services on a sustainable footing and ensure that the expansion of primary\nhealth care services for all Bhutanese continues. In this connection, the RGoB is adopting\na two-pronged strategy of increased resource mobilization and increased efficiency in\nresource use including cost containment. On the basis of our timetable for reform agenda,\nthe following major policy initiatives will be implemented in 2000.\n(i) The Government will initially approve a policy paper advocating the need to\nexpand user charges for selected health care services through a pilot study. The\npolicy  paper  will  be  based  on  the  findings  of  surveys  on  current  user\n2", "39 Appendix 5, page 3\ncharges  in  hospitals  and  household  income  and  expenditure  patterns  on\nhealth care and discussions with stakeholder groups. The policy paper will\nbe the basis for launching a pilot study by end of 2000 that will assess the\nfeasibility of the expansion of user charges on selected nonessential health\nservices.  In  carrying  out  the  pilot  study,  the  Ministry  of  Health  and\nEducation (MOHE) will assess their impact on use of health services as well\nas  studying  health-seeking  behavior  to  identify  other  mechanisms  to\nencourage rational use of health services and to ensure that there will be no\nimpact on the access to essential services, particularly among the poor.\n(ii) The Bhutan Health Trust Fund (BHTF) will be legally established through\nthe  issuance  of  a  Royal  Charter.  The  BHTF  will  be  developed  as  a\nsustainable  financing  mechanism  that  is  expected  to  generate  funds  to\ncover  the  annual  expenditure  on  essential  drugs,  vaccines  and  new\ntechnologies.  It  is  important  to  note  that  the  focus  of  the  BHTF  is  on\nprimary  health  care  (PHC)  and  will  support  the  expanded  program  on\nimmunization and reproductive health, of which women and children are the\nprime beneficiaries.\n7. In addition, more policy initiatives will be adopted in 2001. Some of these\nwill be based on the findings of the studies mentioned above. These include\nthe following:\n(v) A  policy  paper  advocating  the  use  of  poverty  incidence  as  one  of  the\ncriteria for resources allocation to ensure more equitable access to health\nservices  will  be  completed.  Subsequently,  poverty  indicators  based  on\nthe  data  generated  by  a  new  health  management  information  system\n(HMIS)  and  the  findings  of  the  joint  RGoB/ADB  poverty  assessment\nexercise  will  be  used  as  one  of  the  planning  inputs  for  allocating\nresources in the health sector during the Ninth Five-Year Plan.\n(vi) Situation  analysis  completed  on  chronic  degenerative  diseases.  To  the\nextent possible, we will attempt to project the burden of disease and its\nfinancial implications for the health budget.\n(vii) On the basis of the pilot study, we will develop a proposed structure of user\ncharges  on  additional  health  services  and  the  institutional  mechanisms\nneeded to administer these user charges. Public discussions will be held\nin  order  to  sensitize  communities  to  the  need  for  cost-sharing\nmechanisms  in  health  services  prior  to  their  introduction  in  the  Ninth\nFive-Year Plan.\n(viii) Completion of a market review of ancillary services for the hospital with\na view to contracting out these services.\n3", "40 Appendix 5, page 4\n(ix) Undertake a study on projected need for and cost implications of overseas\ntraining and service provision.\n(x) To enhance the efficient use of resources in the health sector, the MOHE will\nnow be using recurrent cost analysis in order to project the impact of major\ncapital investment projects on recurrent budget. This will become a standard\nplanning tool to improve the priority setting and decision-making process on\nthe basis of cost-effectiveness.\n2. Strengthening Capacity for Health Sector Management\n8. The  RGoB  also  recognizes  the  need  to  overcome  weaknesses  that  relate  to\ndeficiencies in planning, management, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of public\nhealth policies and programs. Capacity-building efforts will be carried out through\nthe  introduction  of  a  comprehensive  strategic  planning  framework  for  health\nprograms in 2000. The MOHE has also developed a restructuring plan for its Policy\nand Planning Division, which will be strengthened through the proposed creation of\na new M&E section. The identification and training of adequate staff for recruitment\nwill also be completed in 2001 in order to ensure that qualified staff will be made\navailable under our civil service system for the restructured Policy and Planning\nDivision immediately after the bifurcation of the MOHE into the Ministry of Health\nand the Ministry of Education which is proposed to take place in 2002.\n9. Management and planning of health facilities will also be enhanced through the\nadoption of a standard health facility maintenance program. The adoption of new\nfinancial management procedures in 2001 will also promote greater transparency and\naccountability.\n10. Monitoring and research capacity of the MOHE will also be strengthened. While\ncurrent  plans  in  the  MOHE  have  measurable,  time-based  indicators,  there  is\ndifficulty  in  tracking  them  due  to  deficiencies  within  the  Health  Management\nInformation System (HMIS). Hence, the problems with HMIS will be addressed\nunder the program such that more reliable, useful and timely information will be\nmade  available.  The  RGoB  expects  to  install  an  upgraded  HMIS  by  2001.This\nimproved HMIS will help in identifying program beneficiaries more clearly and in\ndesigning appropriate programs to meet their needs.\n3. Strengthening  Quality  Assurance  and  Public  Health  Regulatory\nFunctions\n11. The RGoB also recognizes the need to strengthen the capacity of the MOHE to\nensure  the  quality  of  health  care  services.  In  view  of  this,  the  RGoB  has\nreviewed  its  management  approach  and  will  soon  establish  a  \u201cfocal  point\u201d\n4", "41 Appendix 5, page 5\nwithin the MOHE which has the responsibility for \u201cQuality Assurance\u201d with respect\nto both the delivery of services and the management of activities and programs. This\n\u201cfocal point\u201d, will have the mandate to promote a shift towards more \u201cresults based\u201d\nmanagement. A review of the logistics for the proper inventory of essential drugs\nwill be carried out as part of this exercise.\n12. Regulatory  function,  an  essential  component  of  public  health  systems,  remains\nrelatively undeveloped in Bhutan and hence needs to be strengthened. A focal point\nwill also be established within the MOHE in 2000 to assume responsibility for\ncoordination of public health regulation. This focal point will ensure that health\nsector input is obtained in the drafting of legislation/regulation that is related to\nhealth and enforcement of regulations is strengthened and will also be responsible\nfor the dissemination of all appropriate public health legal instruments. To achieve\nthis task, a central repository will be set up to compile, catalogue and update all\nexisting and future legal instruments with a bearing on the health sector.\n13. The creation of focal points for quality assurance and public health regulations will\nenable the MOHE to facilitate the drafting of important laws and regulations for\npublic health. We expect that the draft legislation on the Bhutan Medical and Health\nCouncil will be approved by the Council of Ministers in 2001 and submitted to the\nNational Assembly for its consideration soon after. We also intend to complete a\nsituation analysis on occupational health and safety issues as the basis for future\nlegislation in the ninth Five-Year Plan. Specific regulations on the marketing of\nbreast milk substitutes and for tobacco and alcohol will also be put in place in 2001.\nEnvironmental  codes  of  practice  to  improve  urban  sanitation  and  solid  waste\nmanagement, including an improved system for the proper disposal of medical waste\nin hospitals and other health facilities will also be adopted in 2001.\n4. Adjusting Imbalances in Human Resources for Health\n14. One of the major limitations to the provision of adequate health services in Bhutan\nhas been the lack of sufficient health workers of all categories. The RGoB has\nexerted efforts to train more Bhutanese nationals to staff the various categories,\nincluding specialist positions that are currently filled in by expatriates. A review of\ngender equity to address the concerns of female health staff and patients is expected\nto  be  completed  by  September  2000.  The  RGoB  will  also  review  the  existing\npractices with regard to the training and use of village health workers. The RGoB\nwill continue to encourage community participation in the delivery of basic health\nservices by optimizing the role of village health workers who have made significant\ncontributions.\n15. A  major  undertaking  to  adjust  imbalances  in  human  resources  for  health  is\nto  revise  and  update  the  current  Master  Plan  for  Human  Resources  in  Health\n5", "42 Appendix 5, page 6\n(MPHRH)  to  reflect  more  current  and  projected  personnel  requirements  in\nvarious disciplines, grade levels and geographic areas. An updated MPHRH will\nalso  address  personnel  issues  more  effectively,  as  personnel  are  the  key\ncomponent  of  health  expenditures.  The  Royal  Civil  Service  Commission\n(RCSC) also uses MPHRH for planning investments in overseas education; thus,\nthe MPHRH needs to present a more accurate situation of the health personnel\nrequirements to ensure that resources are efficiently used. In this connection, the\nMPHRH will be reviewed and updated in 2001. The RGoB will also implement\na policy to ensure that all basic health units will include female staff who can\nprovide services to female patients. This will also help promote more antenatal\nvisits to health centers and reduce the high maternal mortality, particularly in the\nrural areas.\n5. Strengthening Primary Health Care (PHC)\n16. To  demonstrate  our  continuing  commitment  to  primary  health  care,  the  RGoB\nwill  adopt  policies  to  strengthen  PHC  through  selective  interventions  and  the\nexpansion of priority services to benefit vulnerable groups and underserved areas.\nAmong these initiatives is to reactivate the Multisectoral Task Force on STD/HIV\nissues  to  ensure  its  active  participation  in  promoting  political  and  social\nawareness on such issues and help strengthen the HIV/AIDS surveillance system.\n17. In order to ensure effective delivery of PHC, the RGoB will ensure that for each of\nthe fiscal year during Program period (2000-2005), the recurrent expenditures as a\npercentage share of total health budget will not fall below the level of 1998/1999.\nWithin  the  total  health  recurrent  expenditures,  the  share  of  recurrent  budget\nallocated  to  PHC  throughout  the  Program  duration  will  not  be  allowed  to  fall\nbelow 50 percent to support the implementation and operations of selected PHC\ninterventions. These will include (i) increasing the number of hospitals providing\ncomprehensive  reproductive  health  services,  including  emergency  obstetric  care\nand clinical family planning, from four to eight, in under-served areas and (ii) a tel\n-medicine pilot project that links the Mongar Regional Referral hospital with the\nJDWNRH in Thimphu. It is hoped that these measures will make health care more\naccessible.\n18. In addition, to strengthen our expanded immunization program, we will carry out a\nstudy to determine the importance of Haemophilus influenza b in the epidemiology\nof  acute  respiratory  tract  infections.  The  RGB  will  also  establish  six  more\nindigenous units so that all district hospitals will have such units by 2002. This is\nin line with the policy objective to provide traditional health care to the segment\nof society seeking such type of health care.\n19. In order to implement the Program in a timely and effective manner, we have set\nup an inter-ministerial steering committee (ISC) to provide policy oversight and to\nmonitor  and  co-ordinate  the  implementation  progress  of  the  various  policy\ninitiatives. The ISC will be supported by a Program Management Unit (PMU) to\n6", "43 Appendix 5, page 7\n7", "44 Appendix 5, page 8\nOther Actions(with their indicative timing ofimplementation) The Council of Ministers approvesthe proposed pilot study forexpansion of user fees no laterthan November 2000; study isundertaken immediately thereafter.Use of poverty indicators based onthe findings of the Government-Asian Development Bank povertyassessment study and Healthmanagement information system(HMIS) data in health resourceallocation during the Ninth Five-Year PlanComplete a market review ofancillary services for the hospitalsector in 2001, with a view tocontracting out of these services.Conduct a study in 2001 onprojected need for and costimplications of out-of-countrytraining and medical treatment.Complete a situation analysis in2001 on chronic degenerativediseases with projections of theburden of disease and financialimplications for the health budgetmade to the extent possible.Use recurrent cost analysis formajor capital investment as astandard tool for the health sectorin 2001.\n(cid:129)  (cid:129)  (cid:129)  (cid:129)  (cid:129)  (cid:129) \nCY MATRIX ctions for Second Tranche Release Based on findings of the pilot study,draft a proposed structure of userfees for additional health servicesfor public discussions prior to theirintroduction in the Ninth Five-YearPlan.Complete policy paper advocatingthe use of poverty indicators as oneof the criteria for resource allocationto ensure more equitable access tohealth services.\nLI A (cid:129)  (cid:129) \nO\nP Actions Taken for First TrancheRelease Submit pilot study to assess thefeasibility of expansion of user feesto the Council of Ministers for itsconsideration.

Objectives and Strategy\n1. The  Bhutan  Health  Trust  Fund  (BHTF)  is  a  Government  initiative  to  support  the\nsustainability of primary health care services through the continued supply of vaccines and\nessential drugs. For the most part, the immunization program is currently financed through\ndonations  in  kind  from  the  international  community.  The  Japan  International  Cooperation\nAgency has committed over half of the required funding each year until 2002. After this date\nthere is no committed funding for the expanded program for immunization (EPI) program and\nalternative, sustainable sources of funding were explored to ensure its ongoing implementation.\nOne of the options considered was the creation of a trust fund with investment sufficient to\ngenerate funds to cover the annual expenditure on essential drugs and vaccines. Technical\nadvice was initially provided by the World Health Organization (WHO); the existing Bhutan Trust\nFund for Environmental Conservation (BTFEC) was used as a model for setting up the BHTF.\nII.  Status of the BHTF\n2. In drawing lessons from the successful BTFEC, the BHTF was legally established under\na Royal Charter in August 2000, following which a board of directors and a secretariat were\nconstituted. The Government has been actively promoting the BHTF among potential donors\nand is committed to match all aid grants to the BHTF. To date, the Government has been able\nto raise a total of about $2.94 million (including interest earnings) for the BHTF from its own\nresources and from contributions from other sources as indicated in Table A7.1.\nTable A7.1: Contributions to the Bhutan Health Trust Fund (Excluding interest earned)\nSources Amount\n(US$)\nGovernment 1,760,177\nBill and Melinda Gates Foundation 1,000,000\nNew Zealand 53,374\nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund 15,000\nSave the Children Fund 5,000\n3. The Government has committed to further deposit $239,823 to the BHTF, the balance of\nits initial $2.0 million commitment. The proposed ADB program loan will assist the Government\nin  augmenting  its  contribution  to  the  BHTF,  by  initially  achieving  the  minimum  capital\nrequirements  of  at  least  $5.0  million,  for  which  the  BHTF  can  become  operational.  The\nGovernment plans to have the BHTF attain a desired capitalization target of $24 million through\nadditional external contributions, which will be matched by the Government on one-to-one basis\nfrom its own resources and income generated by the BHTF as appropriate. The $24 million\ncapitalization would enable the Government to help cover the projected total requirements of the\nvaccinations and essential drugs programs estimated to reach $2.3 million in 2008 (Table A7.2).", "61 Appendix 7, page 2\nIII. Management and Administration of the BHTF\n4. A secretariat, comprising a project director, and required staff, is responsible for the day-\nto-day activities, and for implementing board decisions. In addition, an advisory committee will\nbe established to provide advice to the board and the secretariat, and will be convened on an ad\nhoc basis when it is considered necessary to review the progress of the BHTF.\n5. The BHTF will be established as a 501(c)4 or similar status in the United States (US) or\nhost nation to ensure its exemption from tax on earnings. The feasibility of this must be explored\nfurther. It is believed that as a social welfare organization, the BHTF, like the BTFEC, should\nfulfill the necessary criteria to achieve this status. An annual audit of the BHTF will be carried\nout  by  the  Royal  Audit  Authority  and  an  international  accounting  firm,  on  request  of  the\nmanagement board.\n6. An  international  fund  manager  will  be  contracted  to  manage  the  investments  to\nguarantee an income of a certain level above US inflation, taking into account international\nbenchmarks for investment revenues in similar funds. Board members will include individuals\nwith the requisite skills to review the progress of the BHTF. The quarterly reports to be provided\nby the program monitoring unit to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will include a report on\nthe performance of the BHTF and its investments, including the use of proceeds of income from\nits investment.

The United Nations Development Programme rank Bhutan 142nd among 174 countries\nin terms of human development. This is the lowest ranking of all South Asian developing\nmember countries. Gross national product per capita is $586 and 85 percent of the Bhutanese\npopulation still reside in rural areas. The dependence on subsistence agriculture is evident in\nthe low level of monetization and the large contribution agriculture plays in gross domestic\nproduct. The Government is committed to economic development with an emphasis on equity;\nthis has led to commendable investments in health and education. The program goals fall in line\nwith these tenets, looking to reform to strengthen health care delivery and ensure sustainable\nsources of financing for primary health care (PHC) in the long term. Implicit in development of\nthe Program has been concern for the poor, and each of the program outputs serves this\nvulnerable group. The main program outputs therefore contain measures aimed at improving\naccess to health services and contributing to bettering health status for all. A description of\nimpact on poverty of each of the program elements follows.\nA. Develop Sustainable Financing for the Health Sector\n2. Financing reform of the health sector will be achieved by developing additional methods\nof finance\u2014user charges and the Bhutan Health Trust Fund (BHTF). The net increase of\nresources will be translated into an increased subsidy for the poor if the commitment to PHC is\nmaintained and the user charge strategy is defined in a way that does not have an adverse\nimpact on health service utilization by the poor. Increased efficiency and cost containment in the\nhealth sector, within the context of maintained expenditures, will free up resources for more\ncost-effective allocation and an increased ability to meet the needs of unserved areas, currently\nunmet demands and human resource strengthening. This will lead to a net increase in subsidy\nto the poor.\nB. Strengthen Capacity in Health Sector Management\n3. Improved quality and management capacity will lead to better health services for all,\nincluding the poor. Thus as long as the budget allocation is maintained, there will be a net gain\nfor the poor. Management capacity improvements may also lead to efficiency gains, in which\ncase the net transfer of subsidies to the poor will also increase.\nC. Strengthen Quality Assurance and Public Health Regulatory Functions\n4. If the cost of new regulations are in excess of the cost savings, this will translate to\nhigher prices for goods and services. In addition, if regulation is too costly, production may shift\nto  other  countries  in  the  region,  having  an  adverse  affect  on  economic  growth  and\ndiversification. In terms of impact on the poor, this is partially offset by increased access to\nquality, well-regulated health and other services. In the long run, regulation, if appropriate, will\nlead  to  economic  growth  through  cost  savings  due  to  better  health  status  and  resulting\nincreased  production  levels.  In  addition,  these  gains  to  the  poor  include  reduction  in\noccupational and environmental health hazards, and related ill health and associated costs.\nStrengthening of quality assurance of health programs will also translate to improved quality of\nhealth care for the poor.", "66 Appendix 10, page 2\nD. Adjust Imbalances in Human Resources for Health\n5. Revising  and  updating  the  human  resources  master  plan  and  ensuring  equal\nopportunities for men and women in the health care career path will strengthen human resource\ndevelopment. The former is expected to lead to increased efficiencies in the health care system.\nThe latter will result in increased numbers of women working at the basic health unit (BHU) level\nand below. In turn, this will break down barriers to women\u2019s access to health care, improving\nhealth status, and hence, financial stability.\nE. Strengthen  PHC  Through  Selective  Interventions  and  Expansion  of  Priority\nServices\n6. Ensuring equity in health service delivery will be achieved by maintaining the budgetary\ncommitment to health services, and in particular PHC. Alongside this financing, regulatory and\nmanagement reform must ensure that the poor are protected by ensuring essential services are\nstill free of cost, and where charges are introduced appropriate exemption mechanisms are in\nplace to protect the poor. Selective PHC interventions are especially designed to meet the\nhealth needs of vulnerable groups, including the poor, women, and children. Thus, emphasis on\nPHC will have substantial benefits for the poor.\n7. In summary, the Program will benefit the poor as long as conditions to protect the poor\npopulation are met with regards to the user charge strategy. Any negative impact on the poor,\nresulting from other elements of the Program, is predicted to be a short-term effect of reform\nand caused by higher prices as a result of indirect taxation and public health regulation. As well\nas increasing the direct subsidy to the poor through improved resource allocation, the efficiency\ngains derived from the reforms will free up resources to increase access to services in unserved\nareas; meet unmet demands for health care, such as maternal and child health care; and\nstrengthen human resources. Thus, the overall impact is strongly positive.", "67 Appendix 10, page 3\ns n\nMitigation/Compensationor Enhancement Measure Pilot study to ensureexpansion of user fees willnot have adverse impact onaccess to essential services Basic and essential healthservices remain free; BhutaHealth Trust Fund (BHTF)ensures sustainablefinancing of vaccines andessential drugs; povertyindicators and povertyassessment study will beused in health resourceallocation to ensure equityand pro-poor approach inhealth services ed cost-effectivenessnd an improved referral\nva\nros \nTable A10.1: Develop Sustainable Financing for Health SectorDirect ImpactIndirect ImpactMacroeconomic andImpact on NonpoorFiscal Impactn.a.Growth in jobNot applicable (n.a.)Possible net increaseopportunities in thein private sectorprivate sectoractivity and jobs withcontracting out ofservicesHigher prices forEfficiency in healthFiscal positionHigher prices forsome goods andservice use; improvedstrengthened throughsome goods andservices; increase inhealth statusincreased revenuesservices; increase inprices for non-from private sectorprices for non-essential servicesservices and selectedessential healthuser charges;servicesimproved allocation orresourcesWider range andImproved healthImproved healthBetter access throughimproved quality ofstatus leads tostatus andimproved referralhealth servicesimproved productionproductivity leading tosystem and outreachimproved financialprogramsstability and henceless poverty Net increasen.a.n.a.Net increaseEnsured stable funding of reproductive health programs.(i)Commitment leads to increased resources for health services(ii)The BHTF is capitalized and fully covers cost of vaccines and essential drugs(iii)Continued expansion of health services to outlying areas(iv)All essential services are still priced at zero at point of use(v)Price elasticity of demand for priced health services is less than one(vi)Improved financial planning leads to lower unit costs in delivery of health services and imp(vii)Charging for nonessential services and nonreferrals leads to rational use of health servicesystem(viii)Budget allocation to health sector maintainedPositive\nt\nc\nt sal e\nChannel Labor Marke Prices Access forPoor TransfersGenderAssumptionAbout CruciVariables Total Net Eff", "68 Appendix 10, page 4\nFinancing reform in the health sector will be achieved by increasing or maintaining the allocation to health sector expendituresand developing additional methods of finance, including increased taxation (direct and indirect), user charges, and the BHTF.The increase of resources will be translated into a net increase of the subsidy for the poor if the commitment to PHC ismaintained and the user-charge strategy is defined in such a way as to not have an adverse impact on health service utilizationby the poor.The increase in resources for the health sector will assist in expanding health services for the poor by funding the recurrent costsof new facilities, and, if the BHTF is successful, the introduction of new primary health care technologies. In turn, increasedaccess to health services leads to a reduced incidence of sick days and enhanced productivity resulting in improved financialsecurity and less poverty.The user-charge strategy may have the added advantage of increasing efficiency in resource use in the health sector. Bylowering unit costs, resources are freed up, enabling an increase in the level of transfer to the poor.Increased efficiency and cost containment in the health sector, within the context of maintained expenditures, will free upresources for more cost-effective allocation leading to a net increase in subsidy to the poor.At the same time, prices of some nonessential health services, which, in some cases, may be used extensively by the poor, willbe increased. If the price elasticity of demand for these services is less than one and the incentives are set right, there will bemore rational use of these services through better prescribing practices and improved gate-keeping in the referral system. This,in turn, will lead to lower unit costs and more efficient allocation of resources at the household level.If these conditions are met and efficiency increases, the net impact on the poor will be positive leading to improved health status,improved production, and therefore reduced rural poverty.\ne\nv\nti\na\nr\nr\na\nN\nf \ne\nri\nB", "69 Appendix 10, page 5\nn eo\nMitigation/Compensatioor EnhancementMeasuresRecruitment and trainingprograms of healthpersonnel ss to services for all he poor.

Occupational safety regulations affect the cost oflabor in the industry sector, which is translated into higher prices and could divert production from Bhutan to countries wherethe cost of is less. Alternatively, in the long run, it may be found that the regulations lead to cost-savings due to reducedaccidents/sickness and associated costs, as well as increased productivity due to better health.If the cost to production of regulation is in excess of the cost savings, the net effect is that demand for unskilled labor isreduced due to the higher effective cost, and the poor face higher prices for goods and services. This is partially offset byincreased access to quality, well-regulated health and other services.If regulation leads to cost savings, the opposite is true\u2014with the poor benefiting from increased economic growth, throughproductivity gains, lower prices, and improved quality of goods and services.Indirect taxation of betel, tobacco, and alcohol will lead to higher prices faced by the poor. However, the benefits includereduction in illness associated with use of these substances, and if demand for such products does not drop below the volumebefore which taxes were increased, increased government revenues with which to help finance the deficit.Negative impact on the poor will be felt through indirect taxation and public health regulation leading to higher prices faced bythe poor. In addition if regulation is too costly, production may shift and have an adverse affect on economic growth anddiversification. However, the benefits include reduction in occupational and environmental health hazards and illnessassociated with substance use, and in the long-term, cost savings.\nt\nce\nt sal ev\nChannel Labor Marke Prices Access forPoorTransfersGenderAssumptionAbout CruciVariablesTotal Net EffBrief Narrati", "71 Appendix 10, page 7\nTable A10.4: Adjust Imbalances in Human Resources for HealthDirect ImpactIndirect ImpactMacroeconomic andImpact on NonpoorMitigation/CompensationFiscal Impactor EnhancementMeasuresMore focused healthShift between healthIncrease recurrentVillage health workersIncrease in thetraining programsand nonhealthexpenditures forwill be encouraged tonumber of healthworkforcesalaries and wagescontinue theirworkers to providevolunteer work;better health caregreater careerservices; increasedopportunities foropportunities forhealth professionalsfemale health workersIncreased efficiencyn.a.not applicableMore womenmay lead to reducedpractitioners; leads tohealth care costsbetter access to freepublic health services,therefore lower pricesfor health careImproved access toIncreased productivityImproved healthImproved access toall levels of healthleads to better incomestatus leads tohealth care for ruralcare servicesand reduced povertyimproved productionwomenNet transfer increasedn.a.n.a.Increased jobprospects andremuneration forfemale health workersGender bias in training and career will be removed; more female workers will be stationed in basic health units (BHUs) toattend to needs of female patients.(i) Revised Human Resources Master Plan leads to improve management of HR and HRD and efficiency gains.(ii) Budget allocation to health sector is maintained.(iii) Number of women working as health practitioners at the BHU level is increased.(iv) Female health workers are willing to be assigned to BHUs in remote areas.PositiveStrengthening human resources will be carried out through two major channels.
