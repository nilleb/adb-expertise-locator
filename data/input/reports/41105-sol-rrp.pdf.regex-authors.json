An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was \nAssessment  undertaken. The summary IEE is in Appendix 9.  \nProject Description  The Project will rehabilitate essential infrastructure that was damaged \nby the earthquake and tsunami in Choiseul and Western provinces, \nincluding (i) about 35 kilometers (km) of rural and town roads, along \nwith about 19 bridges and 35 culverts; (ii) about five wharves and \njetties; and (iii) the Gizo town water supply and sanitation system. \nThese estimates are subject to detailed damage assessments and \ncost estimates. The Project will be implemented via a sector approach. \nRationale  On 2 April 2007, a massive undersea earthquake triggered a tsunami \nthat  struck  Western  and  Choiseul  provinces.  Islands  in  these  two \nprovinces  suffered  widespread  damage  to  housing,  infrastructure, \nschools, and medical facilities; and several villages were destroyed. An \nestimated 20,000 people of a total population of 90,000 have been \naffected,  with  about  5,000  people  displaced  and  52  dead.  The \nGovernment\u2019s damage and loss assessment, prepared with support \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB), World Bank, and United \nNations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n \nThe  affected  area  generates  a  disproportionate  share  of \nSolomon Islands\u2019 national output and almost all of its tourism. The \neffects  of  the  disaster  thus  have  national  economic  implications. \nRecovery and rehabilitation will depend on restoring access to affected \nareas  and  maintaining  public  health.  However,  the  disaster  has \nworsened the ability of major producers and rural people to export \nagricultural  and  fisheries  products,  access  markets  and  social \nservices, support tourism, and enjoy safe water supplies. Negative \nimpacts on growth, poverty, and social indicators are expected. The \ndisaster  also  revealed  the  need  to  reduce  the  vulnerability  of \ninfrastructure to climate change and future disasters. ", "ii   \n \nPro-poor economic growth, as well as improvements in social and \nhealth indicators, depends on recovery of the rural economy. Better \ntransportation infrastructure and services are essential to removing \nbarriers to market access, promoting rural production, strengthening \npublic capacity to deliver services, promoting tourism, and reducing \npoverty.  Improved  infrastructure  will  also  be  less  vulnerable  to \nchanging climatic conditions. \n \nThe Government has requested ADB to help facilitate the recovery \nprocess and prepare the Project for reconstruction and rehabilitation. \nADB  has  also  provided  a  disaster  recovery  adviser  to  assist  the \nGovernment  in  managing  the  transition  phase.  The  Government\u2019s \ninitial recovery strategy is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  update  (2007\u20132009)  for \nSolomon Islands  identifies  the  development  of  transportation \ninfrastructure and services as one of the two main areas for ADB \nassistance. Through other projects and technical assistance (TA), ADB \nis also addressing cross-sectoral infrastructure issues and technical \ncapacity building. Existing and proposed projects will be prioritized and \nsequenced as appropriate to respond to the emergency, complement \nactivities, and maximize benefits. \n \nAs a post-conflict and heavily indebted country, Solomon Islands is \neligible for grant financing from the Asian Development Fund (ADF). \nAn  ADF  grant  will  leverage  cofinancing  from  the  European \nCommission (EC). \nImpact and Outcome  The goal of the Project is to restore economic and social activities and \naccessibility in affected areas to pre-disaster levels. The purpose is to \nassist  the Government  in  rehabilitating  damaged  infrastructure  and \nmake it less vulnerable to climate change and natural hazards. The \nrehabilitation  of  damaged  infrastructure  is  expected  to  restore \naccessibility in rural areas, allow a resumption of economic activities \nand social services, and safeguard public health. \nProject Investment  The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $9.75 million. \nPlan \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \n     \nSource  Total  Percent \nAsian Development Bank          4.95  50.75 \nEuropean Commission          4.00  41.03 \nGovernment of Solomon Islands          0.80  8.22 \n       Total          9.75  100.00 \n \n ", "  iii\nGrant Amount and  ADB  will  provide  a  grant  of  $4.95  million  from  the  ADF.  The \nTerms  Government  of  Solomon  Islands  will  provide  $0.80  million  in \ncounterpart  contributions.  The  EC  will  provide  grant  cofinancing  of \n$4.00  million  equivalent,  to  be  administered  by  ADB,  for  the  road \nrehabilitation component. ADB and the Government will finance the \nremaining components and related costs \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2009 \nEstimated Project  31 December 2009 \nCompletion Date \nImplementation  The Project will be implemented over 2 years. The pre-rehabilitation \nArrangements  activities  of  detailed  design,  preparation  of  bidding  documents, \ntendering, and awarding of contracts will start in August 2007. Civil \nworks are expected to begin in December 2007, physical completion \nby 31 July 2009, and grant closing by 31 December 2009. \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Infrastructure Development \nProcurement  Procurement under the Project, including for ADB and Government-\nfinanced packages, will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, \nas  amended  from  time  to  time),  with  the  flexible  interpretation \npermitted for emergency assistance in accordance with ADB\u2019s Disaster \nand  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  (2004)  to  ensure  maximum \nexpediency in implementing the recovery program. Major civil works \nwill be procured using international and national competitive bidding \nprocedures.  Minor  civil  works  will  be  procured  using  national \ncompetitive  bidding,  shopping,  and  community  procurement \nprocedures. \nConsulting Services  International  and  domestic  consulting  services  will  be  required  for \n(i) engineering  design  and  preparation  of  bidding  documents, \n(ii) construction supervision, and (iii) project management. The Project \nwill fund 18 person-months of international consulting services and \n54 person-months of national consulting services. Consulting services \nwill  be  engaged  through  a  firm  using  the  single  source  selection \nmethod,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \nProject Benefits and  The Project will restore the capacity of infrastructure in the affected \nBeneficiaries  provinces, using appropriate methods and standards to reduce future \nvulnerability. This will support rural development, economic growth, \nand poverty reduction by facilitating access to markets and services, \nexport of agricultural and fisheries products, and allow a resumption of \ntourism.  \n ", "iv   \n  Subprojects will be assessed based on their contribution to national \ndevelopment  objectives  and  priorities.  Selection  criteria  will  require \nsubprojects to be economically viable, with an appropriate economic \ninternal  rate  of  return.  The  Project  will  be  proactive  in  ensuring \nwomen\u2019s involvement. Poverty and social analysis at the subproject \nlevel  will  be  gender-disaggregated,  taking  into  account  (i)  the \ndifferential project impacts and risks facing women, (ii) gender-specific \nmeasures to mitigate adverse impacts and manage risks, and (iii) the \ninterests  and  capacities  of  women  to  participate  in  community \ncontracts.  \nRisks and  The project design considers potential risks associated with project \nAssumptions  management,  rehabilitation  quality,  and  financial  management.  The \nProject will be implemented through an existing ADB-supported project \nmanagement and capacity building unit to continue strengthening the \nGovernment\u2019s  capacity.  Environmental  impacts  will  be  monitored \nthrough  construction  supervision  and  mitigated  at  the  rehabilitation \nstage. \nTechnical  ADB will provide TA for Strengthening Disaster Recovery Planning and \nAssistance  Coordination  to  assist  Government  in  (i)  establishing  coordination \ncapability  to  administer  the  current  and  future  recovery  response \noperations;  (ii)  preparing  and  monitoring  an  integrated  and \nenvironmentally sustainable recovery action plan, and (iii) providing \nspecialist technical services for design and capacity building to reduce \nvulnerability to natural hazards. The total cost of the TA is $950,000. \nThe TA will be financed on a grant basis by the ADB TA funding \nprogram,  which  will  contribute  $800,000.  The  Government  will \ncontribute $150,000. \n  The TA will fund 14 person-months of international consulting services \nand  72  person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  Consulting \nservices  will  be  engaged  through  a  firm  using  the  single  source \nselection method, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. \n ", "156 o 00'E 150 o 00'E 170 o 00'W\nN o r t h     P a c i f i c     O c e a n\nP2h0io Sl i0ep0ap'Nine MARSHALL  ISLANDS International  D PACIFIC  REGION 20o  00'N\nREPUBLIC ateline\nOF PALAU FEDERATED STATES OF\nMICRONESIA\nONTONG JAVA 0o 0o\n(Lord Howe Atoll) NAURU\nKe Loma K     I     R     I     B     A     T     I\nLuaniua INDONESIA PAPUA\nNEW GUINEA SOLOMON\nISLANDS TUVALU\n6 o 00'S 6 o 00'S SAMOA\nRoncador Reef C o r a l   S e a VANUATU ISCLOAONKDS\nREPUBLIC\nTaro CHOISEUL 20o  00'S OFF ITJHIE TONGA 20o  00'S\nISLANDS\nPROVINCE\nA U S T R A L I A\nS o u t h     P a c i f i c     O c e a n\nPapara\nShortlandVella KoloVmagbhaenMngaaanrnaing Straits Kia SANTA ISABEL 150 o 00'E 1661 o7 00 o0 0'0E'W\nMaravar DAI\nNoro NEW GEORGIA Buala\nRanongga Gizo Munda Susubona Sepi Malu'u Sikaiana SOLOMON ISLANDS\nPWREOSVTIENRCNERendovaBlanche ChannelVVaAnNguGnUuYNanUdinRausseSllavoFlorTidualIandgehpeinAdenucek SitraitsMAOLteAoIMTteAAaRAMASIKE EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE PROJECT\nHONIARA Aola Liwe\nUlawa\nAvu Avu\nDuff\nGUADALCANAL Hauratarata\nKira Kira\nS  o  l  o  m  o  n         S  e  a Reef \nN Lata\nNendo\nSAN CRISTOBAL SANTA CRUZ ISLANDS\nBELLONA\n0 20 40 60 80 100 Tinggoa Utupua\nAnuta\nPeou\n12 o 00'S Kilometers (MRUENNNGEALVLA) Vanikolo 12 o 00'S\nFataka\nProject Area\nTikopia\nNational Capital\nProvincial Capital\nTown S  O  U  T  H      P  A  C  I  F  I  C      O  C  E  A  N\nInternational Boundary\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n0\n7\n-1\n5\n5\n3 H 156 o 00'E 166 o 00'E\nR", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto Solomon Islands for the Emergency Assistance Project. The report also describes proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for Strengthening Disaster Recovery Planning and Coordination and if \nthe Board approves the proposed grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, will approve the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  RATIONALE: ANALYSIS, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Disaster Overview \n2.  On  2  April  2007,  a  massive  undersea  earthquake  triggered  a  tsunami  that  struck \nWestern and Choiseul provinces. Islands1 in these two provinces suffered widespread damage \nto housing, infrastructure, schools, and medical facilities; and several villages were destroyed. \nAn  estimated  20,000  people  of  a  total  population  of  90,000  in  both  provinces  have  been \naffected. About 5,000 people were displaced and 52 people died.  \n3.   Islands in the affected provinces suffered damage to housing, infrastructure, schools, \nand medical facilities. The disaster has had a negative effect on tourism in the affected areas, \nand will impede growth of the industry by worsening access to tourism centers. It has also \naffected fisheries and agricultural production, and made export of local products more difficult. \n4.  The force of the earthquake was such that the physical environment of the islands and \nreefs have changed, leaving a small number of islands and reefs tilted and causing concern \nabout the impact on coastal vulnerability, ground water access and levels, drainage systems \n(both natural streams and wetlands and constructed drains), agriculture, and livelihoods. \n5.   Emergency  humanitarian  relief  by  development  partners  and  nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs)  has  provided  temporary  shelter  and  subsistence  needs,  while \ngovernment  and  externally  funded  programs  are  working  to  rebuild  education  and  health \nfacilities and reinstate livelihoods. Recovery and rehabilitation will depend on restoring access \nto affected areas and maintaining public health. However, the disaster has worsened the ability \nof rural people to access markets and social services, and reduced access to safe water \nsupplies. Negative impacts on growth, poverty, and social indicators are expected. \n6.   In  recognition  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  long  experience  and \nimplementation of ongoing projects and TA in Solomon Islands, the Government requested ADB \nto  prepare  the  Project  for  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  and  to  assist  with  overall \ncoordination. To help facilitate the recovery process, ADB immediately provided a disaster \nrecovery adviser to assist the Government with initial coordination of the relief phase. ADB will \nalso  provide  TA  to  strengthen  coordination,  prepare  an  integrated  and  environmentally \nsustainable  recovery  action  plan, and  implement  the  Project  through  technical design  and \nsupervision. \nB.  Damage Assessment \n7.  Solomon  Islands  is  a  large  Melanesian  island  country,  with  a  land  area  of  about \n28,000 square kilometers (km2), comprising six large islands, dozens of smaller islands, and \nhundreds of islets and atolls. More than 80% of the population of 475,000 is rural, living in \n                                                 \n1 Including the islands of Choiseul, Gizo, Kolombangara, Mono, New Georgia, Ranongga, Rendova, Shortlands, \nSimbo, and Vella Lavella.  ", "2 \nwidely dispersed villages of a few hundred persons. The country, especially in rural areas, lacks \nadequate infrastructure and services. The disaster has worsened this situation. \n8.  The national road network is sparse, reaching only 23% of rural villages with about 20% \nof the national population, mostly on the islands of Guadalcanal and Malaita. Western and \nChoiseul  provinces  have  relatively  short  coastal  segments  of  gravel  or  earth  roads  near \nprovincial centers. The damaged condition of the network in the affected areas has further \nreduced rural accessibility, thus restricting the contribution of road transport to economic growth, \npoverty reduction, and social development.   \n9.  Damage to land transport infrastructure has been extensive. The tsunami has cut off \nvillages from the main centers on the islands. In the worst affected areas, roads and coastal \nareas have been heavily scoured and covered with debris. Roadside drains and culverts are \nblocked or damaged because of seismic and tsunami action. Bridge abutments, which were not \ndesigned for seismic impacts, have been completely destroyed. A few bridges appear to be in \nsatisfactory  condition  but  will  require  investigation  as  the  earthquake  tremors  may  have \ndestabilized their foundations. In total, about 70 kilometers (km) of roads, 48 bridges, 0.7 km of \nseawalls, and 0.7 km of protection works were severely damaged or destroyed. In addition, \nminor damages have been incurred to other roads, bridges, and retaining walls. Most of the \ndamage has been on the islands of Gizo and Choiseul.  \n10.  Because  of  the  archipelagic  nature  of  the  country,  the  dispersion  of  population,  a \npredominance of coastal settlements, and the sparse road network, the main form of transport \nin rural areas is often by small  boat around coastal areas and by coastal ships between \nprovinces. However, earthquake tremors have destabilized the substructure of many wharves \nand jetties, and the tsunami has mostly destroyed their superstructures, leaving them unusable. \nSome wharves are completely destroyed, while some are repairable. A total of 19 wharves, \n14 jetties,  and  52  causeways  were  damaged  or  destroyed  in  the  areas  affected  by  the \nearthquake and tsunami. In addition, the earthquake raised parts of some islands and lowered \nothers, which has dramatically impaired physical access and rendered some wharves unusable. \n11.  In the main town of Gizo, the water supply is operational but damaged. Following the \ndisaster,  water  flows  have  slowed  and  there  is  significant  supply  loss  from  the  intake  to \nreservoirs and storage tanks. The distribution main from the intake to the storage reservoir was \nbroken in several locations. The water supply is contaminated and unsuitable for drinking. Given \nthe growing population of Gizo, the intake, purification, distribution, and storage systems need \nupgrading to meet the growing demand. Sanitation facilities also require improvement.  \n12.  An assessment team led by ADB, with participation from the Australian Agency for \nInternational  Development  (AusAID)  and  the  New  Zealand  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment (NZAID), conducted a rapid damage assessment of transport infrastructure and \nwater supply and sanitation in the affected areas. Based on the damage assessments and a \nstandardized methodology developed with the World Bank and the United Nations Development \nProgramme (UNDP), the cost of damage to transport infrastructure and the water and sanitation \nsector is estimated at about $7.2 million. The estimated reconstruction cost of all damaged \ninfrastructure is about $40 million. The complete assessment is in Supplementary Appendix A. \nC.  Economic Impact \n13.  Solomon Islands is a weakly performing country emerging from several years of conflict, \nand is one of the least developed of ADB\u2019s Pacific developing member countries. The economy \nis  based  on  primary  commodities  from  agriculture,  forestry,  and  fishing.  Production  of \ncommodities is based primarily in rural areas. During the conflict, real gross domestic product \n(GDP) per capita declined by 35% to about $500. From 2003 to 2005, GDP growth averaged  \n ", "3 \n4\u20135% per year, but the International Monetary Fund and Central Bank of Solomon Islands \nestimate that the growth rate will fall to about 3% for the next few years. The socioeconomic \nsituation is characterized by high unemployment (with only about a quarter of the population \nformally employed) and rapid population growth of nearly 3% per year. In the United Nations\u2019 \nHuman  Development  Index,  Solomon  Islands  ranks  second  lowest  among  Pacific  island \ncountries. It is unlikely to meet most of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.  \n14.  The  affected  area  generates  a  disproportionate  share  of  Solomon  Islands\u2019  national \noutput through forestry, fisheries, and agriculture, and almost all of its tourism. These activities \nare highly dependent on transport infrastructure, particularly for exports. The effects of the \ndisaster thus have national economic implications.   \n15.  In  addition  to  carrying  export  cargo  and  providing  passenger  services,  roads  and \nwharves provide connectivity to rural areas. As a result of the recent damage to transport \ninfrastructure, many villages are without access to transport. Communities are not able to \nmarket their produce or access social services. These constraints will adversely affect rural \neconomic development, poverty reduction, and social services within the two provinces. \n16.  The immediate economic impacts of the disaster relate to the (i) opportunity costs to \nboth the public and private sectors to finance recovery that redirects funding from productive \nassets to rehabilitation; (ii) lost revenues while private and public services are not functional, \nwith related employment and socioeconomic impacts; and (iii) loss of tourism, fisheries, and \nagricultural production. These losses will decrease productivity and economic growth as long as \nkey facilities are not rehabilitated. Longer-term negative impacts on the national economy would \nbecome serious if production and exports remain restricted by transport problems.  \nD.  Government\u2019s Response  \n17.  The  Government  quickly  mobilized  relief  and  rescue  operations  and  took  over  the \nprovincial administration in Gizo, which is the most populous center in the affected areas. The \nGovernment  distributed  emergency  food  relief  while  NGOs  responded  with  provision  of \ntemporary shelter and nonfood relief supplies. \n18.  Solomon Islands\u2019 overall disaster response is guided by a National Disaster Plan (NDP) \nauthorized under legislation. The NDP facilitates the effective utilization of existing government \nstructures, complemented by a system to mobilize the response of other stakeholders. The \nNational Disaster Council (NDC) headed by the Ministry of Home Affairs has been activated as \nthe oversight authority. The National Disaster Management Office (NDMO), under NDC, acts as \nsecretariat and coordinates assistance. Disaster committees chaired by provincial secretaries \nimplement the NDP at provincial level. However, in the case of Western Province, the disaster\u2019s \nimpact rendered the provincial government inoperative. With assistance from ADB and UNDP, a \nmechanism has been created to improve coordination between levels of government. The \nGovernment also convenes regular meetings of development partners and NGOs. \n19.  An initial damage assessment was undertaken by NDMO, and refined by line ministries. \nA technical advisory team (TAT) comprising all relevant ministries has been established and is \nled by the Ministry of Development Planning and Aid Coordination with assistance from UNDP \nand ADB to identify needs and issues arising from the disaster, and prepare a recovery action \nplan (RAP). Given the extent of damage and remoteness of affected areas, the emergency \nphase has extended beyond a month. As the transition to recovery gathers pace, NDMO and \nTAT  are  collaborating  to  ensure  relief  and  recovery  activities  continue  effectively.  The \nGovernment\u2019s initial recovery strategy is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n ", "4 \n20.  The Government\u2019s development vision, priorities, and strategies are articulated in the \nNational Economic Recovery, Reform, and Development Plan (NERRDP).2 This identifies key \nstrategic  areas  for  revitalizing  the  productive  sector  and  rebuilding  infrastructure,  and  for \nrestoring basic social services and fostering social development. The NERRDP recognizes the \nimportance of transport infrastructure as an enabling input for community development. The \nNational Transport Plan3 (NTP) provides the framework and action plan for developing and \nmaintaining  physical  infrastructure,  facilitating  transport  services,  improving  the  capacity  of \ngovernment agencies, and enhancing private sector participation. An official transport task force \n(TTF)  including  representatives  of  the  Government,  transport  users,  and  transport  service \nproviders advises the Government on key issues, development options, and priorities.  \n21.  The RAP is the Government\u2019s reconstruction and rehabilitation program for the medium \nand longer term. It includes the overall damage and loss assessments, prioritized actions and \ninvestments, a plan to monitor program implementation and report progress to NDC, and a plan \nfor donor coordination. The RAP has been developed consistently with the NDP, NTP, and \nNERDDP. The RAP has been reviewed by ADB, endorsed by the TAT and NDC, and will be \napproved by the Government to officially guide the reconstruction and rehabilitation program. \nThe RAP serves as the sector development plan to guide project implementation to ensure that \nactivities are complementary and sequenced in accordance with recovery priorities. \nE.  Development Partners\u2019 Response \n22.  Government, development partners, NGOs, and the private sector provided immediate \nassistance in response to the disaster. Estimates of emergency humanitarian relief\u2014including \nfood and nonfood items, water supply and sanitation, shelter, health, medical care, and logistics \nsupport\u2014that were provided in the first month after the disaster are shown in Table 1. \nTable 1: External Assistance for Emergency Relief \n($ million) \n \nSource  Purpose  Cash  Goods/Services \nGovernment  Humanitarian assistance contributions,  0.71  Not assessed \nrelief aid, transport etc. \nBilateral partners  Humanitarian assistance contributions,  3.21  0.86 \nrelief aid, transport etc. \nMultilateral agencies  Humanitarian aid, response and  0.01  0.34 \nassessment support, emergency and \nfamily kits \nNongovernment organizations  Disaster kits, emergency supplies,  0.4  0.6 \nmedical teams, family kits, water tanks \nand filtration/purification systems, \noutboard motors and relief and \nassessment staff. \nBusiness, community, and  Money and goods for relief efforts  0.17  0.23 \nprivate donations \n      Total   4.50  2.03 \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n                                                 \n2 Government of Solomon Islands. 2003.

The United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination Team (UNDAC) mobilized \nthree days after the disaster to assist NDC in coordinating the response to the emergency, \nfollowed by a joint UNDAC/NDC team which arrived two days later with a team in Gizo to \nsupport the Provincial Disaster Council and coordinate the relief effort. NDMO has also been \nsupported by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA). \nEarly in the emergency phase, cluster working groups on shelter, health, water and sanitation, \nnon-food item distribution, and child protection were facilitated by UNDAC. \n24.  UNDP is continuing to assist the Government, through the NDC-NDMO-TAT structure, in \nthe  recovery  phase  to  (i)  augment  on-going  emergency  assistance  operations  through \nmeasures that foster the self-reliance of the affected population and help rebuild livelihoods, (ii) \npromote spontaneous recovery initiatives by the affected population and mitigate the rebuilding \nof risk, and (iii) establish the foundations for longer-term recovery.  \n25.  Several development partners are planning to provide assistance in the affected areas. \nAlthough details of sites and activities are not yet available, civil works could be included. The \nProject  will  coordinate  civil  works  with  all  partners  to  complement  activities  and  avoid \nduplication. ADB will also provide TA for coordination, to assist government and development \npartners in finalizing assistance through a process of consultation and joint review. \nF.  ADB\u2019s Proposed Response \n26.  To provide immediate disaster response, ADB dispatched staff to support infrastructure \nassessments, communications, programming, and donor coordination. Staff visited the affected \nareas,  supported  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  Development  (MID)  in  carrying  out  initial \ninfrastructure damage and needs assessment, and provided strategic advice to the Ministry of \nDevelopment Planning and Aid Coordination in defining and establishing the process toward \nrecovery and rehabilitation. The team engaged with the Government to determine the role ADB \ncould play in the recovery and rehabilitation phases. \n27.  The Government has requested ADB, on the basis of a Cabinet decision, to coordinate \nthe  overall  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  process.  Staff  specialized  in  disaster  risk \nmanagement have been fielded to assist Government in the management of the transition \nphase and planning toward recovery. In addition, ADB has agreed to assist the Government in \nthe reconstruction and rehabilitation of infrastructure damage. This effort will be closely aligned \nwith ongoing ADB-supported infrastructure projects in Solomon Islands.  \n28.  To support recovery and rehabilitation of the affected areas, a three-part approach is \nproposed. First, ADB will continue to provide technical support to assist in the coordination and \ndrafting of a comprehensive damage assessment and rehabilitation plan. Second, ADB will \nprioritize and sequence activities within existing projects to respond to urgent needs. Third, the \nproposed Project has been processed and will be implemented under ADB\u2019s Disaster and \nEmergency Assistance Policy (2004) to restore essential infrastructure as efficiently as possible. \n29.  ADB  is  implementing  the  Post-Conflict  Emergency  Rehabilitation  Project,4  which  is \nnearly complete, and the Solomon Islands Road Improvement Project5 (SIRIP), which is just \nbeginning. Both are implemented through project management units under the direction of MID \n                                                 \n4 ADB. 2000.

To  avoid  duplication  the  Project  will  be \nimplemented through the SIRIP project management and capacity building unit (PMCBU). \n30.  Infrastructure investments are needed to support economic growth, employment, poverty \nreduction, and social development. ADB\u2019s current country strategy and program update for \nSolomon Islands6 prioritizes two major areas for ADB assistance: transportation infrastructure \nand services, and an enabling business environment. It also identifies institutional capacity \ndevelopment as central to all activities. These three themes are complementary. \nG.  Lessons Learned in Disaster Management  \n31.  Unlike  most  other  countries  that  have  recently  experienced  natural  disasters,  the \nrebuilding situation in Solomon Islands is far more sensitive given the post-conflict environment. \nThere are four major challenges and lessons, drawn from other recent natural disasters in the \nAsia  Pacific  region,  and  implementation  of  previous  ADB  emergency  projects  in  Solomon \nIslands, which have guided the design of ADB support.   \n32.  First,  extensive  but  diverse  forms  of  support,  especially  from  NGOs,  mean  that \ncoordination is vital. The Government needs to outline principles and practices to guide the \nsupport from the private sector, NGOs and public-private partnerships, and it ought to effectively \ncoordinate among different donors. ADB will support these activities but given the likely lead \ntime involved in finalizing a medium-term programmatic framework and the complexities in \nchanneling fund flows effectively to finance its components, a hybrid approach of supporting \nproject and sector-based modalities will be adopted. Integrated and multisectoral programming \nis needed to significantly facilitate planning and implementation. Needs assessment should be \ndone jointly by development partners active in the country, with responsibility for implementation \ndivided by sector. Coordination groups should be kept manageable with a regular forum where \npartners can interact with Government on policy issues and project design. ADB and other \ndevelopment partners have agreed to work through the TAT for these purposes. \n33.  Second, dealing with a natural disaster in a post-conflict environment calls for a well-\nrounded approach to rebuilding with participatory mechanisms and equitable distribution of \nresources  across  affected  areas  in  a  transparent  and  accountable  manner.  Allocation  of \nresources to different areas needs to be in line with assessed damages and losses. A conflict-\nsensitive  approach  is  more  likely  to  improve  prospects  of  genuine  improvement  through \nrehabilitation and reconstruction. Phasing of response/recovery should follow where possible \nthe expressed needs of the affected population. Careful poverty targeting and sensitive project \ndesign can lead to major poverty reduction impacts even under difficult circumstances. \n34.  Third, the rebuilding process will take place in an environment with depleted public \nadministration systems, yet one that is decentralized down to the district level. Even in normal \ncircumstances, local government capacity has generally been weak. Now, the disaster has \nfurther  weakened  the  capacity  in  the  affected  provinces.  It  is  vital  that  the  provinces  are \nrespected and credibility and trust are built up among the affected local officials and the citizens. \nWeak local capacity requires support of the national Government in the first phase to facilitate \nand develop local capacities for implementation programs, including through NGOs, while not \nundermining the responsibilities of provincial and local governments. ADB will continue to work \nwith UNDP to support capacity of local governments that are being revived and establish \nworking groups parallel to the ones at the central level.  \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132007): Solomon Islands. Manila. \n ", "7 \n35.  Fourth, geological changes in many areas may have caused shifts in the demographic \nand  social composition  of  communities.  In  the  mainly  coastal communities,  the  rebuilding \nprocess will not be initiated until spatial plans are finalized. The Government has proposed \nrezoning of some coastal areas and resettlement of coastal communities. In the most affected \ncoastal zones, rebuilding infrastructure and public facilities will be based on the environmental \nassessment process and consultations with the affected communities. If families have to move \nfrom their customary land, resolution of land allocation may prove to be one of the most \ncomplex  and  time-consuming  issues.  A  serious  challenge  is  to  develop  participatory \nmechanisms to truly enable the people to determine issues such as those related to spatial \nlocation. A consistent policy framework needs to be adopted on land titling and spatial planning \nthat takes into account the likelihood of sea level rise and future natural disasters. Consultation \nand participatory processes will be addressed under TA as described in Appendix 7. \nH.  Rationale for the Project \n36.  Pro-poor economic growth and improvement in social and health indicators depend on \nthe revitalization and decentralization of the rural economy, made more urgent by the disaster. \nThe damaged condition of the transport network is a constraint to the movement of people and \ngoods, a disincentive to productive rural activity, and an impediment to the recovery and growth \nof tourism. Improved transportation infrastructure and services, which would restore access to \ndomestic  and  international  markets  for  agricultural  and  fisheries  products,  are  critical  to \nrestarting and rebuilding rural economies in the affected areas. The focus on restoring rural \naccessibility will therefore enhance poverty reduction. \n37.  Prior to the disaster, deteriorating rural infrastructure and lack of access to rural services \nand markets hampered rural production and constrained the development of tourism. Damage \nto the transport network has exacerbated the situation. Economic restoration and employment \ngrowth,  therefore,  is  severely  constrained.  A  rehabilitated  and  sustainable  rural  transport \nnetwork can enhance rural economic development significantly by restoring access, which will \nraise rural incomes and stimulate production and employment. \n38.  The disaster is also evidence of the Solomon Islands\u2019 increased vulnerability to changes \nin climatic conditions. Climate change is expected to increase extreme weather events, and to \ncause sea level to rise. Roads, bridges, and wharves require improved environmental protection \nand higher construction standards to withstand potential future natural events. The Project will \nbe designed to withstand a projected increased likelihood of such effects within the expected life \nof  rehabilitated  infrastructure.  While  design  criteria  for  climate  change  adaptation  are  not \navailable for the Solomon Islands the methodology to incorporate climate proofing within design is \ndetailed in an ADB publication.7 \n39.  Communities  have  a  clear  interest  in  a  good  transport  network,  which  creates  an \nopportunity to involve them actively in rehabilitation and maintenance. Contracting maintenance \nthrough community participation and labor-based methods will generate income for the rural \npopulation. Consultations allow them to determine how they will contribute, and on what terms \n(e.g., by contributing labor or local materials). A participatory approach to rehabilitation and \nmaintenance  allows  the  capacities  and  contributions  of  communities,  including  the  large \nnumbers of unemployed, to be utilized proactively. A gender-aware approach to community \nliaison and consultations can ensure that the perspectives and capabilities of women are taken \ninto account, and that an appropriate participation strategy is devised.  \n                                                 \n7 ADB. 2005. Climate Proofing: A Risk Based Approach to Adaptation. Pacific Studies Series. Manila. \n ", "8 \n40.  The Project and TA have incorporated the lessons described above by emphasizing \nimproved designs to reduce vulnerability, enhancing coordination, and providing for community \nparticipation. The Project will preserve the gains being made under ADB\u2019s strategy for Solomon \nIslands  by  (i)  restoring  transportation  infrastructure,  (ii)  facilitating  expanded  transportation \nservices, and (iii) providing opportunities for direct private sector and community participation. \nFurther, TA attached to the Project will guide external assistance through better aid coordination \nand consistent development planning. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT   \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n41.  The goal of the Project is to restore economic and social activities and accessibility in \naffected areas to pre-disaster levels. The purpose is to assist the Government in rehabilitating \ndamaged infrastructure and make it less vulnerable to climate change and natural hazards. The \nrehabilitation of damaged infrastructure is expected to restore accessibility in rural areas, allow \na resumption of economic activities and social services, and safeguard public health. The \nDesign and Monitoring Framework for the Project is in Appendix 1. \nB.  Components and Outputs  \n42.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  via  a  sector  approach.  Each  subproject  will  be \nprioritized and selected in accordance with the process and eligibility criteria in Appendix 3. A \nsystematic and consultative approach will be established for subproject appraisal, covering (i) \nsocial,  economic,  and  environmental  evaluation;  (ii)  design;  (iii)  procurement;  (iv) \nimplementation;  and  (v)  monitoring.  Each  subproject  feasibility  study  will  provide  sufficient \nevidence of its eligibility under the agreed criteria, and will be in accordance with the detail and \nquality  required  to  enable  ADB  to  assess  the  viability  and  suitability  of  the  subproject. \nImplementation will incorporate HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention and general health and \nsafety activities, as appropriate.  \n43.  Component A: Road Rehabilitation. The Project will finance rehabilitation of damaged \nland transport infrastructure. This will include repair of about 35 km of unsealed roads and about \n35 watercourse crossings (culverts and wet crossings), and replacement of about 19 bridges. \nThe proposed bridge structures will be designed and constructed in accordance with seismic \nstandards to withstand earthquakes of similar or larger magnitude. Designs will incorporate \nlateral movement of the structure compatible with earthquake and tsunami forces. Similarly, \nprotection works and sea walls will be also be designed and constructed to withstand tsunami or \ncyclone-generated forces. \n44.  Component B: Wharf and Jetty Rehabilitation. The Project will finance rehabilitation \nof damaged water transport infrastructure. This will include reconstruction of about five wharves \nand jetties. The proposed wharves and jetties will be designed and constructed in accordance \nwith seismic standards to withstand against an earthquake of similar or larger magnitude. \nDesigns will incorporate lateral movement of the structure compatible with earthquake and \ntsunami forces. Wharves and jetties will be constructed and protected to withstand against \ntsunami or cyclone-generated forces. \n45.  Component C: Gizo Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation. The Project will \nfinance rehabilitation of the Gizo town water supply and sanitation system. This will include (i) \nrepairs to the distribution main and restoring flows to pre-disaster level; (ii) cleaning, repairs and \nimprovements to intake and reservoirs; (iii) upgrade existing water supply systems with more \nreliable source development; (iv) shipment and installation of storage tanks; (v) procurement of \n ", "9 \nelectrical components and cables of the submersible pump; (vi) installation of a purification \nsystem for safe drinking water; and (vii) repairs to the sanitation system. \n46.  Component D: Maintenance via Community Participation. During implementation the \nProject will finance minor routine maintenance on rehabilitated infrastructure through community \nparticipation  and  labor-based  methods.  Small  specialized  maintenance  equipment  will  be \nprocured  for  future  sustainability  of  labor-based  methods  and  ongoing  road  maintenance \ncontracts by the community. \nC.  Special Feature \n47.  ADB, AusAID, NZAID, and the European Commission prepared the Project through a \njoint mission to draw on their existing partnerships in the Solomon Islands transport sector. This \ncollaboration has ensured incorporation of the experience, perspectives, and lessons learned by \nthe Government and its development partners.  \nD.  Project Investment Plan  \n48.  The Project is estimated to require an investment of $9.75 million. A detailed cost \nestimate is in Appendix 2. The costs of the components are summarized in Table 2. \nTable 2: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Total Cost \nA.  Base Cost    \n       1.  Civil Works   \n          a.

The Government has requested a grant of $4.95 million from ADB\u2019s Asian Development \nFund to help finance the Project. The Government of Solomon Islands will provide $0.80 million \nin counterpart contributions. The EC will provide grant cofinancing of $4 million equivalent, to be \nadministered by ADB, for the road rehabilitation component. ADB and the Government will \n ", "10 \nfinance  the  remaining  components  and  related  costs.  The  detailed  financing  plan  is  in \nAppendix 2, and is summarized in Table 3.  \nTable 3: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total Cost  Percent \nAsian Development Bank  4.95  50.75 \nEuropean Commission  4.00  41.03 \nGovernment of Solomon Islands  0.80  8.22 \n    Total  9.75  100.00 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \nF.  Cofinancing \n50.  An  underlying  objective  of  ADB's  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  is  to \ncoordinate  with  development  partners,  minimize  duplication,  encourage  cofinancing,  and \ncatalyze the provision of additional resources. It is likely that a number of these partners may be \nwilling to complement  ADB\u2019s funds for this Project through cofinancing. ADB has typically \nsought approval from its Board of Directors for the administration of loan or grant funds from \ncofinanciers  only  when  cofinancing  commitments  are  in  place.  In  light  of  the  need  for \nexpediency and efficiency in ADB's response to the disaster, Management requests Board \napproval of the administration of any cofinanced funds obtained from development partners \nsubsequent to the date of Board approval. Approval of such cofinanced funds will be confirmed \nand  approved  by  Management,  and  reported  to  the  Board  in  accordance  with  standard \nprocedures. This procedure will be adopted only to the extent that the additional funds provided \nby cofinanciers will not materially alter or fundamentally affect the objectives, purposes, and \nscope  of  the  Project.  Any  proposed  cofinancing  that  will  materially  affect  the  objectives, \npurpose, or scope of the Project would be processed as a major change of scope and circulated \nto the Board in accordance with the usual procedures under ADB's Project Administration \nInstructions, section 5.04. \n51.  As described above, the EC has committed to provide joint cofinancing in the amount of \n$4 million equivalent, allowing ADB to catalyze additional resources for the Project. For the EC \nto participate, it requires nondiscrimination in procurement processes against legal persons, \nfirms, and goods established in EC-recognized official candidate countries, member states of \nthe European Economic Area, and developing countries as specified in the Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee rules.8 \nManagement requests Board approval to allow procurement in, and procurement of eligible \ngoods and services from, the above mentioned entities. \n52.  The request for Board approval is being made pursuant to Article 14(ix) of the ADB \nCharter, which states that the Board may, by vote of the Directors representing not less than \ntwo  thirds  of  the  total  voting  power  of  the  members,  approve  procurement  from  ADB \nnonmember  countries  in  appropriate  circumstances.9  The  EC  cofinancing  of  $4  million \n                                                 \n8 Regulation (EC) No. 2110/2005 of the European Council and Parliament, 14 December 2005. \n9 The Charter provides one, nonexclusive example of what may constitute \"appropriate circumstances\" for allowing \nprocurement in non-ADB member countries or procurement of goods and services produced in ADB nonmember \ncountries. It states that the Charter's requirement that procurement occur only in member countries may be lifted \n\"in the case of a nonmember country in which a significant amount of financing has been provided to the Bank\". \nThis example is similar to the current proposal. \n ", "11 \nequivalent will finance the road rehabilitation component. The Board\u2019s approval for lifting the \nprocurement restriction is requested only in support of this component of the Project. \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n53.   The Executing Agency (EA) for the Project will be MID. The Government\u2019s TTF10 will \nserve  as  the  project  steering  committee,  overseeing  and  monitoring  all  aspects  of  project \nimplementation, including (i) policy guidance and coordination, (ii) subproject feasibility study \nand selection, (iii) project progress reports and other project documentation, and (iv) audited \naccounts and financial statements. \n54.  The existing PMCBU for SIRIP, directed by the permanent secretary of MID, will be \nresponsible for implementation. The PMCBU will (i) conduct subproject feasibility assessments, \ndesign, and supervision; (ii) manage tendering processes; (iii) manage contracts; (iv) prepare \nwithdrawal applications; (v) prepare project progress reports and a project completion report; \n(vi)  maintain  project  accounts  for  auditing;  (vii)  monitor  the  Project\u2019s  socioeconomic  and \nenvironmental impacts; and (viii) complete related project management activities, as necessary \nto implement the Project successfully and comply with ADB policies and guidelines.  \n55.  Although the PMCBU is fully integrated with MID professional and technical staff as \ncounterparts, the volume and schedule of existing activities under SIRIP and MID\u2019s limited \ntechnical staff resources mean that the PMCBU needs to be supplemented with additional \ntechnical support for these services as described below and in Appendix 7. \n2.  Implementation Schedule \n56.  The Project will be implemented over 2 years. Recruitment of the PMCBU consultants, \ninitiated  under  advance  procurement,  will  be  completed  by  July  2007.  Other  preparatory \nactivities for initial works will be completed by December 2007, including feasibility studies, \ndetailed  design,  tender  documentation,  award  of  contract,  and  mobilization.  Rehabilitation \nactivities will be physically completed by 30 June 2009. The grant is scheduled to close by \n31 December 2009. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 4.   \n3.  Procurement \n57.  Procurement  under  the  Project,  including  packages  financed  by  ADB  and  the \nGovernment, will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \nCivil works will be divided into packages to be procured using international competitive bidding \n(ICB), national competitive bidding (NCB), shopping, or community procurement procedures as \nappropriate.  A  number  of  packages  for  maintenance  contracts,  to  be  determined  during \nimplementation,  will  also  be  procured  using  NCB,  shopping,  or  community  procurement \nprocedures. Before the commencement of any procurement activity under NCB, ADB and the \nGovernment will review the Government\u2019s procurement procedures to ensure consistency with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Any  necessary  modifications  or  clarifications  to  the \nGovernment's procedures will be documented in the procurement plan. Technical and financial \nqualifications of contractors will be reviewed in conjunction with the review of the bid proposals. \n                                                 \n10 The TTF is chaired by the permanent secretary of the Department of Planning and includes the permanent \nsecretaries of the departments of infrastructure and development, provincial development, and finance and \ntreasury as members. The MID Transport Policy and Planning Unit acts as the TTF secretariat. AusAID and NZAID \nare also members by invitation of the Government in recognition of their key role. \n ", "12 \nContractors  might  be  awarded  more  than  one  contract  package  based  on  the  least-cost \ncombination of contracts. Evaluation of ICB contracts will include a margin of preference for \ndomestic contractors as specified in ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The procurement plan is in \nAppendix 5. \n4.  Advance Procurement Action \n58.  Given the urgency of the recovery activities, ADB approved advance action for the \nprocurement of goods and services, and recruitment of consultants by direct selection. The \nGovernment has been advised that approval of such advance action does not commit ADB to \nfinance any part of the recovery program.  \n5.  Consulting Services \n59.  Consulting  services  will  be  required  to  supplement  the  PMCBU,  which  will  handle \n(i) engineering design and preparation of bidding documents, (ii) construction supervision, and \n(iii) project management. The Project will fund approximately 18 person-months of international \nconsulting services and 54 person-months of national consulting services, provided by a firm. \nConsultants will be supervised by the current PMCBU project manager. The outline terms of \nreference are in Appendix 6.  \n60.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). At the request of the Government, ADB will \nrecruit  the  PMCBU  consultants.  Given  the  emergency  nature  of  the  Project,  the  critical \nrequirement  to  ensure  continuation  and  integrate  activities  with  ongoing  projects,  and  the \nsatisfactory performance of the existing firm, engagement of consultants through a firm using \nADB\u2019s single source selection method is justified.   \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n61.  The grant will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  disbursement  procedures  will  include  direct \npayments and reimbursements. The PMCBU will open and maintain dedicated imprest accounts \nfor each funding source in a domestic bank. The maximum amount in each account will be 10% \nof the eligible funding from each source, or the equivalent of 6 months of expenditures from \neach source, whichever is lower. The initial amount deposited in each imprest account will not \nexceed $250,000 equivalent. Withdrawals from the grant accounts will be made on the basis of \n100% of eligible expenditures for each claim received, up to the total amount to be financed by \nthe grant. The statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure may be used for reimbursement of \neligible expenditures and liquidation of imprest account expenses, and is applicable to individual \npayments  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $50,000,  upon  review  and  approval  by  ADB. \nPayments in excess of the SOE ceiling will be reimbursed based on the normal process with full \nsupporting  documentation.  Direct  payments  will  be  encouraged  for  most  civil  works  and \nconsulting services. \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n62.  Reports. MID will submit to ADB quarterly progress reports on preconstruction activities \nand construction of civil works, including (i) physical and financial progress, (ii) status of land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  (if  required),11  (iii)  environmental  management,  (iv)  public \n                                                 \n11 Since all work will involve rehabilitation of existing facilities within existing rights-of-way, neither land acquisition nor \nresettlement is expected to be necessary. \n ", "13 \ncommunication campaigns, and (v) other activities critical to project implementation. To facilitate \nperformance monitoring and post-project review, the Government has agreed to provide ADB, \nwithin  3  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  a  completion  report  that  will  cover \nimplementation details, costs and benefits, and any other information that ADB might require.  \n63.  Accounts and Audits. MID will maintain separate records and accounts that will identify \nthe goods and services financed from the grant, the expenditures incurred for the Project, and \nthe  use  of  counterpart  funds.  The  project  accounts  will  be  established  and  maintained  in \naccordance  with  sound  accounting  principles  and  practices  that  will  follow  internationally \naccepted accounting standards. External auditors acceptable to ADB may be used to audit the \naccounts and annual financial statements annually. The audit reports will include an auditor\u2019s \nopinion on the use of the grant proceeds, compliance with the financial covenants included in \nthe grant and project agreements, the use of the SOE procedure, and use of imprest accounts. \nThe Government will provide ADB with the annual audited financial statements, audited project \naccounts,  audit  reports,  management  letters,  and  other  related  statements  no  later  than \n6 months after the end of each fiscal year throughout the implementation period.  \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n64.   MID will establish a project performance and monitoring system within 3 months of grant \neffectiveness.  ADB  and  the  Government,  in  consultation  with  the  Project\u2019s  development \npartners, will agree on a set of indicators for monitoring and evaluating project performance in \nachieving its goals and purposes. These indicators will be refined and monitored during project \nimplementation. The indicators will include data for monitoring economic development, social \ndevelopment,  environmental  impacts,  and  maintenance.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be \nbased on gender-disaggregated data for social and poverty impact indicators. MID will monitor \nand evaluate the Project\u2019s progress annually, and provide a final report within 6 months of the \nend of the contract period. Guidelines for baseline values for subprojects, data collection and \nanalysis, and periods for future monitoring are in Appendix 10.  \n9.  Project Review \n65.  ADB, together with the EC and the Government, will undertake regular review missions \napproximately every 6 months. Reviews will evaluate the scope, implementation arrangements, \nand other relevant aspects of the Project (including administrative, organizational, technical, \nenvironmental, social, poverty reduction, resettlement, economic, and financial aspects) that \nmight affect project performance, viability, and achievement of scheduled targets. \n10.  Anticorruption \n66.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  the  EA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \ngrant  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  ADB-financed \ncontracts  for  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. \n ", "14 \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n67.  The disaster has revealed a need to improve the Government\u2019s capacity to manage \nemergency response, improve infrastructure analysis and planning, and develop an effective \nframework  for  mitigating  vulnerability  to  climate  change.  TA  can  strengthen  disaster \nmanagement,  infrastructure  planning,  and  mitigation  capacity  to  ensure  that  (i)  future \ninfrastructure  designs  incorporate  adaptation,  and  (ii)  mitigation  strategies  and  are  less \nvulnerable to climate change and potential future disasters. \n68.  The TA will (i) strengthen disaster and emergency management; (ii) analyze, plan, and \nmonitor infrastructure rehabilitation in the affected areas; and (iii) design and build capacity for \npreparation of environmentally sustainable infrastructure subprojects that reduce vulnerability to \nclimate change and natural hazards in the recommendations for future development. The TA \nwill also help the Government establish an effective response capability by coordinating across \nrelevant ministries to administer current and future recovery response operations. To improve \nplanning,  the  TA  will  help  the  Government  adopt  a  systematic  approach  to  mitigating  the \ncountry\u2019s  vulnerability  to  adverse  weather  conditions  through  design  of  environmentally \nsustainable infrastructure. Although some TA activities are related to project implementation, a \nflexible approach to the use of TA is justified to leverage ADF resources and build capacity for \nimplementation of an emergency response in a weakly performing country. \n69.   ADB will provide TA for Strengthening Capacity Building for Disaster Recovery Planning \nand Coordination. The total cost of the TA is $950,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis \nby the ADB TA funding program, which will contribute $800,000. The Government will contribute \n$150,000 equivalent in counterpart contributions through the provision of counterpart staff, office \nspace and administrative support, and logistics and local transport. ADB will engage consulting \nservices for the TA as specified in Appendix 7 in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants for the selection and engagement of international and national consultants.  \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n70.  The Project will directly benefit the rural population in affected areas, many of whom are \npoor or extremely poor, by restoring access to economic opportunities and social services and \nsafeguarding public health. Government agencies and private sector companies that use the \ntransport network to deliver products and services will benefit similarly. The estimated benefits \nto these groups, as well as other impacts, assumptions, and risks, are based on overall project \nanalysis and on the sample subproject documented in Supplementary Appendix D. \nA.  Economic Impacts \n71.  Rehabilitation  of  roads  and  bridges,  wharves,  and  water  supplies  is  essential  to \nrestoration of economic activities\u2014including agricultural exports from the affected areas and \naccess for tourism\u2014and will thus improve the prospects for economic growth and poverty \nreduction. In the affected areas, efficient and effective transport infrastructure is essential for \naccess to economic opportunities and social services by rural people who are disproportionately \npoor and disadvantaged. Damage to the transport network is restricting the delivery of food, \nfuel, and building materials necessary for recovery. The rehabilitation program will mitigate the \npotentially extended negative impacts of the disaster and enable the country to recover with \nonly a temporary setback.  \n72.  Project activities will be technically sound, cost-effective, and represent a least-cost \nalternative with appropriate adjustment for climate-resistant design. Economic evaluations of \nsubprojects will be carried out using methods appropriate to the context, including economic \n ", "15 \ninternal rates of return and sensitivity analyses. The evaluations will be required to demonstrate \nthat subprojects are economically justifiable and will be used to prioritize individual subprojects. \nThe economic criteria are in Appendix 3.  \nB.  Poverty Reduction Impact  \n73.  The Project will restore the country\u2019s efforts to reduce poverty by reinstating people\u2019s \naccess to local and provincial markets for agricultural and fisheries products, thereby restoring \nincome  generation  opportunities.  The  Project  also  will  reduce  poverty  by  offering  direct \nemployment on the Project. During implementation, employment will be created in construction \nand maintenance for civil works. Following completion, employment opportunities will arise for \nroutine maintenance conducted through community contracts.  \n74.  During the poverty and social analysis of the subprojects, the economic impacts of the \nProject on the poor and nonpoor will be assessed using secondary and field data. Distributional \nanalysis will not be needed unless the initial assessment is considered insufficient, and if the \nextra data collection and analysis required for distributional analysis is considered worthwhile. A \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 8. A social and poverty impact \nanalysis of the sample subproject is in Supplementary Appendix E. \nC.  Social Impacts \n75.  The Project will restore access to social services and safe water for Gizo town residents. \nPositive social impacts include restoration of access to education facilities, which will help \nmaintain school enrolment and retention rates, and restoration of access to health services, \nwhich will promote more frequent use and facilitate rapid care during medical emergencies. \nOther  social  benefits  include  restoration  of  access  to  administrative  and  service  centers, \nincluding communication facilities. \n76.  As  part  of  the  poverty  and  social  analysis  of  subprojects,  consultations  will  be \nundertaken in each subproject location with (i) resource owners, (ii) households, (iii) the poor \nand nonpoor, (iv) females and males, (v) young and old, (vi) the disabled, (vii) community-based \norganizations and NGOs, (viii) transport service providers and users, (ix) local contractors, and \n(x) provincial and district governments. The TTF is expected to establish local consultative \ngroups that will be the primary contact point between the Project and communities on project-\nrelated matters, including recruitment of labor and access to aggregates. \n77.  Poverty  and social analysis at the subproject level will  be gender-disaggregated to \ndetermine  (i)  the  differential  project  impacts  and  risks  facing  women,  (ii)  gender-specific \nmeasures to mitigate adverse impacts and manage risks, and (iii) the interests and capacities of \nwomen  to  contribute  to  infrastructure  rehabilitation  and  maintenance.  The  Project  will  be \nproactive in ensuring the involvement of women.  \n78.  While the reported number of HIV/AIDS infections remains low across the country, \nSolomon  Islands  is  vulnerable  to  HIV/AIDS.  Appropriate  education  and  prevention  will  be \nintegrated to the Project. Construction contractors will be required to provide their crews and \ncommunities access to education and control programs.  \n79.  The  rehabilitation  subprojects  are  not  expected  to  require  resettlement  or  land \nacquisition, as all works are expected to be undertaken on existing facilities within existing \nrights-of-way. If changes in conditions require land acquisition or resettlement for civil works, the \nGovernment will inform ADB and prepare a resettlement plan according to relevant laws and \nregulations, the resettlement framework in Appendix 11, and ADB guidelines. \n ", "16 \n80.  Native  Melanesians,  who  comprise  the  vast  majority  of  the  population,  are  the \nindigenous  people  of  Solomon  Islands.  For  the  indigenous  population,  the  rehabilitation \nsubprojects will improve access to health, education, livelihood, and social services. The Project \nis not expected to have a differential impact on indigenous peoples.  \nD.  Environmental Impacts \n81.  The  Project  is  classified  environmental  category  B,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines.12  Field  surveys  of \nsample subprojects were conducted to help assess environmental impacts of the Project. All \nactivities are expected to be confined to existing locations and rights-of-way, and neither land \nacquisition nor resettlement should be required. An initial environmental examination (IEE) \nincorporating an environmental management and monitoring plan (EMMP) has been prepared \nand is in Supplementary Appendix C. A summary IEE (SIEE) is in Appendix 9. Environmental \nAssessment and Review Procedures are in Supplementary Appendix F. ADB\u2019s assessment \nprocedure  is  aligned  with  the  environmental  impact  assessment  requirements  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s Environment Act, 1998. \n82.  The Project will be designed to withstand the increased likelihood of future disasters and \nnatural  hazards.  The  environmental  impact  of  the  disaster  has  altered  the  coastline  and \nchanged surface and undersea conditions in some areas. Some zones near former wharves, \njetties, and sea walls may be more vulnerable to erosion, wave removal of sand, and projected \nsea level rises. The design process will include analysis of alternatives for construction that will \nbe reviewed for potential environmental impacts and enhanced environmental sustainability. \n83.  Subproject  environmental  selection  criteria  will  ensure  that  the  Project  will  not \npermanently harm any ecologically or culturally sensitive areas and that all negative impacts \nidentified will be avoided or mitigated through the design. The construction of improved drainage \nstructures, stabilization of slopes through bioengineering, and other measures undertaken by \nthe Project will have long-term beneficial impacts on the environment. Short-term impacts will be \nunavoidable during construction. These might include noise, dust, and other temporary impacts \nsuch as loss of vegetation due to earth moving; and minor sedimentation of waterways and the \ncoastal environment near the shore. These impacts will be addressed, and methods specified in \nthe EMMP will mitigate them.  \n84.  Each subproject will be subject to an IEE, which will include a detailed, site-specific \nEMMP prepared under the responsibility of the PMCBU. The EMMP will specify the required \nmitigation  measures  and  monitoring  activities  to  ensure  their  effectiveness.  Environmental \nassessment review procedures (EARP) have been prepared that will guide the environmental \nmanagement  of  the  sector  project  and  preparation  of  environmental  assessment  of  the \nsubsequent subprojects. \nE.  Project Risks and Mitigation  \n85.  The risks and mitigation related to the Project include:  \n(i)  Technical risks. Weak capacity within the EA could lead to implementation \nproblems.  Underestimation  of  resource  allocation  and  improper  construction \nmethods  and  equipment  might  cause  delays  and  increase  costs.  Limited \navailability  of  aggregates  in  some  areas  could  pose  difficulties.  The  project \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila. \n ", "17 \ndesign will mitigate these risks by (a) managing the Project through the existing \nPMCBU,  which  has  demonstrated  satisfactory  performance,  (b)  incorporating \nprovisions in tender documents for evidence of satisfactory past performance by \ncontractors in similar conditions; (c) requiring a minimum level for provision of \nphysical plant at mobilization, detailed quantification of engineering risks, and \nadequate  contingencies  for  unforeseen  items;  and  (d)  holding  community \nconsultations in advance, with government support, on subproject selection and \naccess to resources.  \n(ii)  Financial risks. Grant-financed budgetary allocations for the Project could be \ninadequate as a result of underestimated construction costs, more-than-routine \nsupervision of contractors, inflation during implementation, and the potential cost \nof defending construction claims lodged by contractors. To mitigate these risks, \nthe PMCBU will (a) use conservative cost estimates; (b) use strict and effective \ncontract  conditions  to  mitigate  slow  contractor  performance;  (c)  develop \nmeasures  to  mitigate  uninsurable  risks  during  preparation  of  the  contract \ndocumentation  to  limit  the  employer\u2019s  exposure,  including  requirements  for \nforeign exchange hedging by contractors; and (d) require a guarantee by the \ncontractor  for  1  year  following  rehabilitation  to  ensure  construction  quality. \nGovernment  budgetary  allocations  for  counterpart  contributions  could  be \ninadequate because of poor national financial management. Ongoing programs \nsupported  by  development  partners  are  strengthening  the  Government\u2019s \nbudgetary processes, financial management systems, and provincial governance \nand will thus improve the environment for project implementation and institutional \ncapacity  building.  ADB  project  and  TA  review  missions,  as  well  as  country \nconsultation missions, will engage in regular dialogue to maintain support and \ncommitment. ADB also will continue to work closely with development partners to \npromote sector governance improvements. \n(iii)  Environmental risks. Civil works, including material acquisition, could create \nnegative  impacts  on  the  environment.  Although  the  high  rainfall  climate, \necologically  sensitive  coastal  and  forested  landscapes,  and  high  level  of \nbiodiversity and endemism provide a high potential for environmental impacts, \nactivities will be undertaken in a narrow corridor. The Project will not disturb \nmajor  habitats,  most  activities  will  be  in  areas  previously  used  for  similar \ninfrastructure, and an environmental management plan will be put in place for \neach  set  of  subprojects.  Adherence  to  best  engineering  practices  during \nrehabilitation,  and  strict  enforcement  of  the  EMMP,  will  avoid  or  adequately \nmitigate all of the rehabilitation-related impacts. There are increasing risks of a \ngreater frequency or severity of natural events caused by climate change. The \nrisks to rehabilitated infrastructure are mitigated by using higher engineering \nstandards for construction.  \n(iv)  Land and material acquisition risks. Landowners and rural populations are \nexpected to welcome rehabilitation for social and economic benefits. The existing \npractice in Solomon Islands is for local landowners to grant access to local \nmaterials as their counterpart contribution. Existing policies of the Government \nand development partners supporting counterpart contributions will mitigate the \nrisk of demands for compensation.  \n(v)  Social  and  post-conflict  environment  risks.  Social  risks  occur  through \npossible  encroachment  of  project  activities  onto  customary  land  or  areas  of \ncultural significance; and through demand for resources such as water, gravel, \n ", "18 \nand sand, without prior discussion with local land or resource owners. The post-\nconflict  environment  is  stable,  particularly  in  the  affected  areas  which  were \nrelatively uninvolved in the original conflict, and the economy is recovering. The \nbusiness environment is increasingly positive, as contractors and consultants \nrespond to business opportunities. If political instability increases or the peace \nand order situation deteriorates, prospective bidders might have less interest in \nthe Project, increasing tender prices. This also could reduce community support \nfor the Project. These risks can be managed in each subproject through prior \ndiscussions  with  local  landowners,  in  cooperation  with  ongoing  community \ndevelopment assistance provided by development partners. \n(vi)  Governance risks. Civil works and consulting contracts implemented by EAs are \nsubject to risks of inappropriate procurement and potentially corrupt practices. \nThe Government has well-documented procedures that require all contracts to be \nprocured  through  a  ministerial  tender  board.  ADB  TA  has  also  helped \nGovernment  develop  a  contract  procedures  manual  for  major,  minor,  and \ncommunity contracts. All procedures are advertised and implemented publicly.  \n86.  An analysis of the project risks shows the potential adverse social and environmental \nimpacts not to be significant and capable of mitigation. Cost and implementation risks will be \nmanaged through the proposed approach to contractor selection, contract conditions, financial \nincentives, and penalties to avoid the late performance problems of previous projects. The risks \nare manageable and do not constitute barriers to successful project implementation.  \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n87.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the Grant Agreement: \n(i)  Counterpart contributions. The Government shall allocate, on a timely basis, \nadequate counterpart funds in accordance with its disaster recovery action plan. \nThe Government shall ensure that MID has adequate budget to maintain staffing \nand  support  its  routine  operations,  including  transport  and  subsistence \nallowances for staff participating in field activities.   \n(ii)  Cofinancing. The Government shall take all necessary measures to facilitate the \ntimely mobilization of the necessary cofinancing required for implementing the \nProject. In the event that cofinancing from the EC does not become available, the \nGovernment shall consult ADB to reduce the scope of the Project, or make other \narrangements acceptable to ADB to cover the funding shortfall. \n(iii)  Subproject  selection.  Prior  to  the  detailed  design  of  any  subproject,  the \nGovernment shall obtain ADB\u2019s concurrence on the inclusion of the subproject \nfor financing under the Project, based on the appraisal and selection criteria \nagreed between the Government and ADB. \n(iv)  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  Government  shall  ensure  that  all \nproject rehabilitation works are undertaken within existing rights-of-way. In the \nevent of any unforeseen land acquisition or resettlement needs, the Government \nshall inform ADB and prepare a resettlement plan according to applicable laws \nand  regulations,  the  resettlement  framework,  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995). The Government, through the PMCBU, shall ensure \nthat no construction activities begin until ADB has reviewed and approved such \nresettlement plan. \n ", "19 \n(v)  Environment. The Government shall ensure that (a) the Project is carried out in \naccordance with applicable laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy, \n(b)  no  civil  works  under  the  sector  project  shall  commence  until  the \nGovernment\u2019s environment agency has cleared the environmental assessment of \nany subproject, (c) the IEE and preliminary EMMP are prepared in accordance \nwith the EARP, reviewed and updated at the engineering design stage, and \nsubmitted to ADB for approval, (d) the Project complies with the EMMP reflected \nin the updated IEE, (e) the EMMP is reflected as part of bidding documents and \ncivil works contracts, (f) civil works contractors are closely supervised to ensure \nthat adverse environmental impacts arising from the Project are minimized by \nimplementing the agreed mitigating measures and standard operating practices \nare changed to avoid their recurrence. \n(vi)  Gender  and  employment.  The  Government  shall:  (a)  encourage  project \ncontractors to employ women in rehabilitation and labor-intensive maintenance; \n(b) provide equal pay to men and women for work of equal type, in accordance \nwith national laws and international treaty obligations; (c) provide safe working \nconditions for male and female workers; and (d) ensure that project contractors \ncomply  with  applicable  labor  laws  and  abstain  from  child  labor.  Specific \nprovisions to this effect shall be included in the bidding documents.  \n(vii)  Health risks. The Government, through the PMCBU, shall ensure that all civil \nworks  contractors  engaged  under  the  Project  participate  in  an  HIV/AIDS \nprevention program to be funded under the Project in construction campsites. In \naddition, the PMCBU shall ensure that information on the risk of transmission of \nHIV/AIDS  and  other  sexually  transmitted  diseases  is  disseminated  to  local \ncommunities in coordination with national agencies working on the issue. The \nPMCBU shall also include specific provisions to this effect in civil works contracts \nand strictly monitor compliance. \n(viii)  Project performance monitoring and evaluation. Within 3 months of the grant \neffectiveness date, the Government, through the EA, shall finalize and adopt a \nproject  performance  and  monitoring  system  acceptable  to  ADB,  based  on \nindicators and procedures agreed between the Government and ADB. The EA \nshall monitor the indicators according to the agreed framework on a quarterly \nbasis to determine the efficiency and effectiveness of the Project, and shall \nprovide  to  ADB  monitoring  reports  from  the  commencement  of  project \nimplementation until completion. \n(ix)  Anticorruption  measures.  The  Government  shall:  (a)  undertake  necessary \nmeasures to create and sustain a corruption-free environment; (b) ensure that its \nanticorruption laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are strictly \nenforced and are being complied with during project implementation, and that \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in all bidding \ndocuments for the Project; (c) facilitate ADB\u2019s exercise of its right to investigate, \ndirectly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive  or \ncoercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project;  (d)  ensure  that  the  EA  conducts \nperiodic inspections on the contractors\u2019 activities related to fund withdrawals and \nsettlements; and (e) ensure that all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe Project include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine \nthe records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants \nand other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n ", "20 \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n88.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve: \n(i)  the  grant  of  $4,950,000  to  Solomon  Islands  for  the  Emergency  Assistance \nProject from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources on terms and conditions that are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Grant Agreement \npresented to the Board herewith, and;  \n(ii)  the administration by ADB of loans or grants in accordance with the proposal set \nforth  in  paragraph  50 of  this  Report  to  Solomon  Islands  for  the  Emergency \nAssistance Project, to be provided by any development partner or cofinancier on \na loan or a grant basis after the date of the Board's approval for such Project. \n89.

The  Solomon  Islands  Emergency  Assistance  Project  will  rehabilitate  essential \ninfrastructure that was damaged by the earthquake and tsunami in Choiseul and Western \nprovinces, including (i) approximately 35 km of rural and town roads, (ii) about 19 rural bridges \nand 35 culverts and water crossings, (iii) about five wharves and jetties, and (iv) the Gizo town \nwater supply and sanitation system. Subprojects will be selected based on agreed eligibility \ncriteria (section B).  \n2.  Roads to be rehabilitated are gravel and earthen roads, which have been damaged due \nto seismic and tsunami action. Road surfaces are heavily scoured and covered with debris. \nRoadside drains and most culverts are silted or blocked and a number of culverts have been \ndamaged.  \n \n3.  Many bridges and their foundations and abutments, which were not designed for seismic \nactivities, have been completely destroyed. A few bridges appear to be in satisfactory condition \nor in need of minor repairs but will require thorough investigation for seismic loading as the \nearthquake destabilized their foundations and they may no longer be sound for heavy loads.  \n \n4.  Similarly,  many  wharves  were  damaged.  In  some  cases  only  the  superstructure  is \ndamaged and in need of repairs.  In others, the gabions, abutments, and foundations have \nsuffered major damage, and in a few cases the structures have been completely destroyed. \nPotential underground and underwater damages will require further investigation \n \n5.  The Gizo water supply is operational but damaged. The distribution main from the intake \nto  the  storage  reservoir  was  broken  in  several  locations,  the  intake  capacity  needs \nimprovement,  the  distribution  main  upgraded,  and  water  storage  capacity  and  purification \nincreased. Sanitation facilities also require attention. \n \n6.  Rehabilitation subprojects will be subject to investigation and design criteria, though a \nrange of engineering solutions will be considered. Assessments will include analysis of least \ncost alternatives including full life cycle costs, potential environmental impact, and sustainability \nto natural hazards. \nB.  Subproject Eligibility Criteria  \n7.  Subprojects will meet the following general eligibility criteria: \n(i)  The subprojects will rehabilitate infrastructure assessed as high development \npriorities  based  on  their  contribution  to  the  objectives  of  the  NERDDP, \nparticularly: \n(a)  improved  accessibility  to  social  services  among  poor  and  rural \nhouseholds,  including  schools,  health  facilities,  and  Government \nextension services; \n(b)  restored  opportunities  for  employment  and  income  generation  among \npoor and rural households; and  \n(c)  contribution to economic growth and poverty reduction among poor and \nrural households. \n ", "  Appendix 3  25 \n(ii)  The  Government  will  endorse  the  subprojects  through  the  project  steering \ncommittee. \n8.  Subprojects will be economically viable, and will demonstrate an appropriate economic \ninternal rate of return. An economic analysis will be conducted in accordance with the Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects (1997). In addition \nto standard parameters1 of analysis, subprojects will be assessed for their contribution to: \n(i)  potential for restoration of agricultural production; \n(ii)  potential for restoration of exports of agricultural and marine products;  \n(iii)  potential for restoration of tourism; \n(iv)  employment of local communities and contractors for maintenance and small \nscale works;  \n(v)  restoration of incomes, particularly among poor and rural households; and \n(vi)  contribution to economic growth. \n9.  Environmental screening will be conducted for all subprojects in accordance with ADB's \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). In selecting subproject sites, including extraction \nsites for materials to be imported to construction sites, the following environmental criteria will \nbe used for the first level of screening. If any of these criteria are found applicable to the site, \nthen  the  subproject  will  require  the  production  and  approval  of  an  environmental  impact \nassessment (EIA), following the procedures and requirements of an environmental category A \nproject according to ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines: \n(i)  sites in or adjacent to areas classified as ecologically sensitive; \n(ii)  requirement for major re-alignment of an existing road or complete relocation of \nan existing bridge or wharf that may cause significant environmental impacts; \n(iii)  significant  adverse  impacts  on  natural/primary  forest  or  near-shore  marine \nenvironments such as reefs, mangroves, or other sensitive coastal areas; \n(iv)  permanent negative effect on a known rare or endangered species; and \n(v)  permanent damage to irreplaceable cultural relics and archaeological sites. \n10.  Screening  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  will  be  conducted  for  all \nsubprojects.  Any  subproject  that  would  entail  involuntary  resettlement,  according  to  ADB's \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995) will require production of a resettlement plan according \nto relevant laws and regulations, the Resettlement Framework, and ADB guidelines.2 \n                                                 \n1 Such as assessments of alternative modes of transport, full life cycle costs of rehabilitation and maintenance, traffic \nforecasts based on forecast economic growth and income elasticity of travel demand in project areas, and use of \nappropriate shadow pricing and conversion factors for economic benefits. \n2 \u201cInvoluntary resettlement\u201d addresses social and economic impacts that are permanent or temporary and are (i) \ncaused by acquisition of land and other fixed assets, (ii) by change in the use of land, or (iii) restrictions imposed on \nland as a result of an ADB operation. An \u201caffected person\u201d is one who experiences such impacts. The term affected \nperson includes any people, households, firms, or private institutions who, on account of changes that result from \nthe project will have their (i) standard of living adversely affected; (ii) right, title, or interest in any house, land \n(including residential, commercial, agricultural, forest, and/or grazing land), water resources, or any other moveable \nor fixed assets acquired, possessed, restricted, or otherwise adversely affected, in full or in part, permanently or \ntemporarily; and/or (iii) business, occupation, place of work or residence, or habitat adversely affected, with or \nwithout displacement. \n \n ", "26   Appendix 3 \n \nC.  Subproject Assessment Process \n11.  A long list of potential subprojects will be identified and prioritized based on high-level \nassessments of (i) existing networks and levels of usage; (ii) technical feasibility of providing \naccess by alternative modes; (iii) positive and negative economic, social, and environmental \nimpacts;  (iv)  the  need  for  connecting  infrastructure,  and  (v)  implications  of  any  proposed \nchanges to spatial planning or land use rezoning. Subprojects will be restricted to facilities \ndamaged in the disaster. \n12.  The Executing Agency, assisted by the Project Management and Capacity Building Unit \n(PMCBU), will conduct and document an assessment of each subproject based on the criteria \ndescribed in Section B. Each assessment will involve collecting and analyzing baseline data to \ndetermine the detailed feasibility and impacts expected, using generally accepted planning \nmethods. Community consultations will be conducted to (i) validate baseline data; (ii) identify \npositive and negative impacts; and (iii) evaluate technical, social, and environmental risks. \nThroughout the process, particular attention shall be paid to data collection to enable benefit \nmonitoring, according to the performance indicators described in Appendix 10. \n13.  Each subproject assessment will include (i) a technical feasibility assessment; (ii) an \neconomic impact analysis; (iii) a social and poverty analysis; and (iv) an initial environmental \nexamination and a full EIA if warranted, in accordance with the environmental assessment and \nreview procedures. Each component of the assessment will confirm acceptable ratings against \nthe criteria, or recommend further work to complete the assessment.  \n14.  The transport task force, in its capacity as the project steering committee, will endorse \nthe subprojects that meet all the eligibility criteria. Before the detailed design of any subproject, \nand its inclusion for financing under the Project, proposed subprojects are subject to approval \nby ADB.  \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 4  27 \n27 \nIMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE \n \n2007  2008  2009 \nProject Component \nQ1  Q2  Q3  Q4  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4 \nGrant Effectiveness                                  \nJul \n                         \nProject Management                                     \nPMCBU recruitment                                     \nPre-feasibility, \nsubproject \nidentification                          \nPublic consultations                         \nFeasibility studies                          \nDetailed design and \npreparation of bidding \ndocuments \n                                   \nTendering, evaluation, \nand mobilization                                     \n                         \nCivil Works                                 \nRehabilitation of roads                                     \nRehabilitation of \nbridges                         \nRehabilitation of \nwharves                         \nRehabilitation of water \nsupply and sanitation                         \n                         \nRoad maintenance                         \n                         \nTechnical Assistance                         \nRecruitment                         \n \n                       \nMID = Ministry of Infrastructure Development, PMCBU = Project Management and Capacity Building Unit  \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n ", "28  Appendix 5 \nMASTER PROCUREMENT PLAN \n \nTable A5.1: Project Information \nCountry  Solomon Islands \nName of Grantee  Government of Solomon Islands \nProject Name  Emergency Assistance Project \nProject Reference  SOL 41105 \nDate of Effectiveness  July 2007* \nAmount  $9.75 million \nOf which, Committed   \u2014 \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Infrastructure Development \nApproval Date of Original Procurement Plan  June 2007* \nApproval of Most Recent Procurement Plan  June 2007* \nPublication for Local Advertisements  Expressions of Interest: August 2007* \nGeneral Procurement Notice: August 2007* \nInvitation for Bids: November 2007* \nPeriod Covered By This Plan  July 2007\u2013December 2007  \n* = estimated date \n\u2014 = not applicable \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \nTable A5.2: Procurement Thresholds for Works, Goods, and Related Services \nProcurement Method   Value To Be Used Above  \n($) \nICB Works  $1,000,000\nICB Goods  $500,000\nNCB Works  Less than $1,000,000\nNCB Goods  Less than $500,000\nShopping Works  Less than $100,000\nShopping Goods  Less than $100,000\nExceptional Methods: \nCommunity participation in procurement will be  Less than $50,000\nemployed for small scale works and \nmaintenance, in which local groups are \ncontracted for routine road maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "  Appendix 5  29 \nTable A5.3: Procurement Thresholds for Consulting Services \nProcurement Method   Value To be Used Above  \n($) \nQuality- and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) \u2014\nConsultants Qualifications Selection   \u2014\nLeast-Cost Selection   \u2014\nExceptional Methods  \u2014\nSingle source selection will be used to  Less than $650,000\nselect consulting services due to the \nemergency nature of the Project. \n\u2014 = not available. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \nTable A5.4: Contract Packages Exceeding $100,000 for Goods, Works, and Consulting \nServices \nRef  Contract  Estimated  Procurement  Expected Date  Prior  Comments \nDescription  Cost  Method  of  Review \nAdvertisement  Y/N \n($) \n1  Civil Works \u2013  4,000,000  ICB / NCB  November 2007*  Y  The number \nroads  and size of \ncontracts to  \n2  Civil Works \u2013  2, 150,000  ICB / NCB  November 2007*  Y  be finalized \nwharves  once \nsubprojects \n3  Civil Works \u2013  1, 010,000  ICB / NCB  November 2007*  Y \nare appraised \nwater supply \nand selected \n/sanitation \n3  Civil Works -  250,000  CC  January 2007*   \nmaintenance \n5  Consultants  650,000  Direct  \u2014     \nServices  selection \nCP = community procurement, ICB = international competitive bidding, km = kilometer, LBES = Labor-Based \nEquipment Supported, NCB = national competitive bidding, S = shopping. \n* = estimated date \n\u2014 = not available. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "30  Appendix 6 \nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR  \nTHE PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND CAPACITY BUILDING UNIT \nA.

The PMCBU will be tasked with providing similar project management \nfor the Solomon Islands Emergency Assistance Project (SIEAP), as necessary to implement the \nProject successfully and comply with ADB policies and guidelines.  \n2.  Although the PMCBU is fully integrated with MID professional and technical staff as \ncounterparts, the volume and schedule of existing activities under SIRIP and MID\u2019s limited \ntechnical staff resources mean that the PMCBU needs to be supplemented with additional \nsupport for these services. Consultants will be selected through a firm using ADB\u2019s single \nsource selection procedure. At the request of the Government, ADB will recruit the consultants.1  \nB.  Scope of Work \n3.

Rationale \n1.  On 2 April 2007 a massive undersea earthquake triggered a tsunami that struck Western \nand  Choiseul  provinces.  Islands  in  these  two  provinces  suffered  widespread  damage  to \nhousing, infrastructure, schools, and medical facilities, and several villages were destroyed. An \nestimated 20,000 people of a total population of 90,000 in both provinces have been affected. \nAbout 5,000 people were displaced and 52 people died. \n2.  The  Emergency  Assistance  Project  will  restore  economic  and  social  activities  and \naccessibility in the affected area to the pre-disaster level and make it less susceptible to future \nnatural disasters. The Project will assist the government in rehabilitating damaged infrastructure \nand make it less vulnerable to climate change.  \n3.  The disaster has revealed a need to improve the Government\u2019s capacity to manage \nemergency response, improve infrastructure analysis and planning, and develop an effective \nframework for mitigating vulnerability to climate change. Developing a reconstruction strategy \nrequires vision, the focus and involvement of the communities affected, strong implementation \narrangements  and  monitoring  systems.  In  devising  a  strategy  to  guide  the  reconstruction \nprocess,  decision  makers  should  build  on  the  damage  assessment  by:  (i)  developing  a \nreconstruction strategy through a consultative process; (ii) rapidly mobilizing of reconstruction \nfunds and activities; (iii) focusing on the needs of the local population; (iv) establishing the \nhighest fiduciary standards and efficient system managing the funds, and (v) updating and \nmonitoring needs and results. Community consultation is imperative to devising the plan for \nreconstructing. \n4.  Implementing  that  plan  and  coordinating  all  elements  of  what  will  be  an  extremely \ncomplex undertaking is just as crucial. Rebuilding the affected areas will involve all levels of \ngovernment from national to village as well as domestic and international organizations, bilateral \nand multilateral institutions, donors and community groups. Coordinating these organizations \nwithin the overall recovery and reconstruction process is a major task. One international advisor \nand two local coordinators will be required to meet this challenge. \nB.  Impact and Outcomes \n5.  The goals of the technical assistance (TA) are to strengthen disaster management, \ninfrastructure planning, and capacity to ensure that infrastructure designs incorporate adaptation \nand  mitigation  strategies  and  are  less  vulnerable  to  climate  change  and  potential  future \ndisasters.  \n6.  The outcomes will (i) strengthen disaster and emergency management by establishing \nan effective coordination process across relevant ministries to administer the current and future \nrecovery  response  operations,  and  (ii)  improve  assessment,  analysis,  and  subproject \npreparation in the affected areas that incorporate climate change adaptation, thereby helping \nGovernment develop an effective approach to mitigating the country\u2019s vulnerability to adverse \nweather conditions. \n ", "34  Appendix 7 \nC.  Outline Terms of Reference \n7.  Approximately 32 person-months of international consulting services and 126 person-\nmonths of national consulting services are required in total. Consulting services will be required \nfor two components as described below. \n1.  Component 1\u2014Disaster Recovery Coordination \n8.  Component 1 of the TA for disaster management will provide technical support to the \nGovernment\u2019s newly-established Finance and Economic Development Unit (FEDU) to develop \nand  maintain  the  coordination  process  in  Honiara  and  the  affected  areas  in  Western  and \nChoiseul  provinces.  The  component  will  improve  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  manage \nemergency response and develop an effective framework for mitigating vulnerability to climate \nchange by establishing an effective response capability through efficiently coordinated networks \nacross relevant ministries to administer the current and future recovery response operations. \nImplementation will require a transition from ongoing arrangements and responsibilities of the \nNational  Disaster  Management  Office  (NDMO),  and  the  Ministry  of  National  Development \nPlanning and Aid Coordination\u2014Technical Assessment Team (MDP/TAT).  \n9.  Consultants for Component 1 will be selected as individuals. Three consultants are \nrequired as follows \nAdviser for Disaster Reconstruction and Rehabilitation (International, 4 person months) \n10.  The adviser will be in a facilitating role supporting the transition of responsibilities from \nthe NDMO and MDP/TAT to the FEDU, in direct support of Government and involving all \nstakeholders through the reconstruction and rehabilitation process. The adviser will work closely \nwith MOF and the Director of the FED and in coordination with all relevant stakeholders.

Links to the Country Poverty Analysis \n   \nIs the sector identified as a national priority in  Is the sector identified as a national priority in \ncountry poverty analysis?  Yes  country poverty partnership agreement?  Yes \nContribution of the sector and/or subsector to poverty reduction in Solomon Islands:  \nOn 2 April 2007 a massive undersea earthquake measuring 8.1 on the Richter scale triggered a tsunami \nthat struck the islands of Choiseul, Gizo, Kolombangara, Mono, New Georgia, Ranongga, Rendova, \nShortlands, Simbo, and Vella Lavella in Western and Choiseul Provinces. There is concern on the impact \nof this natural disaster on coastal vulnerability, ground water levels, agriculture, fisheries and livelihoods.  \nAll islands in the two affected provinces suffered widespread damage from the earthquake and tsunami to \nhousing, infrastructure, schools, and medical facilities. Several villages were completely destroyed. Most \nof the people from the affected areas have been traumatized by the event and have fled to higher ground \nwhere they are being housed in makeshift camps.  Health conditions in the camps are inadequate with \nregard to water, food, sanitation and medical support. Immediate food availability is also a concern and  \naccess for food security issues must be addressed. \nThe Solomon Islands Emergency Assistance Project (SIEAP) will restore access to the highest priority \ntransport infrastructure, social services and provide safe water. It will also facilitate positive social impacts \nincluding the restoration of access to education facilities, which will help maintain school enrolment and \nretention rates, and restoration of access to health services, which will promote more frequent use and \nfacilitate rapid care during medical emergencies. Other indirect social benefits include restoration of \naccess to administrative and service centers, including communication facilities. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                 Proposed Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nPoverty and Human Development in Western and Choiseul Provinces: \nA recent ADB participatory poverty assessment identified that poverty of opportunity exists in the country. \nThere is also rural poverty in terms of access to basic needs and infrastructure. To a certain extent, \npoverty of opportunity has resulted from \u201cmisuse\u201d whereby the resources available to the country are used \nto satisfy the wants of a few while many do not have even their basis needs met.  The role of government \nin poverty reduction is in the area of provision of basic infrastructure that the poor and disadvantaged \ncannot be excluded from.   \nPeople from the Choiseul Provinces are socio-economically and environmentally vulnerable poor due to \nthe low coverage of basic transport infrastructure and water supply facilities. Western Province is slightly \nbetter off than Choiseul through having more transport infrastructure coverage resulting in more economic \nactivities especially in terms of tourism.   \nFor example, Western Province has an adult literacy rate of 94%, the highest in the country (including \nHoniara) and considerably greater than the national average of 76.6%1. A major contributing factor is the \nnumber of schools, with Western Province having the highest number of schools in the country, and their \nrelatively even distribution among populated areas. Enrolment rates (5\u201319 year olds) in Western Province \nare 65.4%, well above the national average of 56.3%2.  \nPrior to the disaster, Western province was second only to Honiara in terms of accessibility to health \n                                                 \n1 1999 Population and Housing Census.  \n2 1999 Population and Housing Census. \n ", "  Appendix 8  41 \nservices, when accessibility is defined as being within one hour or less of health services using the \nprevailing mode of transport. Some 73.1% of WP\u2019s population enjoyed such access. Gizo is also well \nserviced,  having  two  of  the  three  hospitals  in  the  \u201cNorth  Solomon  region\u201d  (Western  and  Choiseul \nProvinces), with the other one being located in Munda. \nHuman development refers to development that improves peoples\u2019 lives and livelihood, and places people \nat the heart or centre of all other development efforts. It refers to the process of enlarging the range of \npeople\u2019s choices \u2013 increasing their opportunities for education, health care, income and employment, and \ncovering a full range of human choices, from a sound physical environment to economic and political \nfreedom.  It also involves an accumulation of material wealth as well as social capital.  The SIEAP is \ndesigned to rehabilitate transport infrastructure which addresses the real root causes of poverty and \nhuman deprivation.   \nHuman development in the Solomon Islands calls for a basic needs approach.  The basic needs identified \ninclude two elements: (a) minimum requirements of a family for private consumption\u2014adequate food, \nshelter and clothing, as well as certain household equipment and furniture. (b) Essential services provided \nby and for the community\u2014 such as safe drinking water, sanitation, public transport, health, education and \ncultural facilities. This approach relies on the participation of people.   \nThe initial social assessment (ISA) of SIEAP focused on the population affected directly or indirectly by the \nearthquake and tsunami in Western and Choiseul Provinces. The ISA was carried out in two stages. The \nfirst stage involved gathering and analyzing secondary data on the population living within the affected \nareas,  including  information  on  poverty,  human  development,  livelihoods,  and  accessibility  of  social \nservices. Sources of preliminary secondary data include the 1997 census, United Nations Development \nProgram Provincial Development Profiles, the 2002 Solomon Islands Human Development Report, and \nNational  Household  Income  and  Expenditure  Survey  and  the  most  recently  completed  Participatory \nPoverty Assessment. More in-depth secondary data possibly may be obtained from line ministries.  \nThe second stage of the ISA involved direct engagement with appropriate stakeholders within the two \naffected provinces. The impact assessment involved a combination of key informant interviews and where \nappropriate, focus group discussion with a range of stakeholders, social networks (such as church \nwomen\u2019s groups identified by leaders of affected communities), and disadvantaged groups including \nwomen, old people, and transport providers.  \nDamages, Losses and Earthquake/Tsunami impacts: \nThe loss of human lives due to the earthquake and tsunami was amplified by the destruction of properties, \nlivelihoods and social and transport infrastructure. The poverty impact of the disaster is localized and \nexperienced more severely at the village and community levels, especially for households involved in \nfishing, gardening and village-based micro-enterprises. This destruction added to their hardship and \nincreased their poverty of opportunity. \nDestruction of roads, bridges, wharves, jetties, water sources and water supply facilities has disrupted \nmobility and accessibility of the affected communities to essential social, economic and relief services. \nSince damage is largely confined to rural areas, the incidence and severity of rural poverty is likely to \nincrease among affected communities. \nThe most damage was sustained on Gizo and Choiseul islands.  About 20,000 people of a total population \nof 90,000 in Western and Choiseul Provinces have been affected, with about 5,000 people displaced and \n52 dead.  Infrastructure damages are described in Supplementary Appendix A. \nProject Benefits and Impacts: \nThe goal of the project is to restore economic and social activities and accessibility in affected areas to \npre-disaster levels and increase sustainability. The purpose is to assist the government in rehabilitating \ndamaged  infrastructure  and  make  it  less  vulnerable  to  climate  change  and  natural  hazards.  The \nrehabilitation  of  damaged  infrastructure  is  expected  to  restore  accessibility  in  rural  areas,  allow  a \nresumption of economic activities and social services, and safeguard public health. \nThe project will address the repair and re-construction of physical infrastructure including; rural and town \nroads, bridges and culverts, wharves and jetties, and the Gizo town water supply.  Reconstruction will be \n ", "42  Appendix 8 \nrequired for (i) existing facilities in their present locations and (ii) where facilities are so badly damaged \nnew facilities may be erected in their present location. \nRestored water supply in Gizo town will improve overall public health. It will also reduce women\u2019s drudgery \non  collecting/storing  water  and  accrue  improved  health,  hygiene  and  productivity  benefits  to  the \ncommunity, especially women and children. Reconstruction of localized wharves and jetties will improve \nrural market and fish landings as well as commercially important products such as copra and cocoa. It will \nalso improve local access to essential services and support local livelihoods through labor opportunities \nduring implementation. The transportation component will restore provincial roads and bridges, thereby re-\nconnecting the loss networks which will enable affected population to resume social and economic \nactivities.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? Yes \nThe  SIEAP  preparation  involved  the  identification  and  consultation  of  key  primary  and  secondary \nstakeholders,  especially  during  the  joint  assessment  of  needs  and  damages.    The  key  primary \nstakeholders are the earthquake and tsunami affected communities in Western and Choiseul Provinces. \nOther primary stakeholders are small farmers, women engaged in village-based micro-enterprises and \nvulnerable groups such as the disabled and old people. \nThe secondary or institutional stakeholders include the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO), the \nprovincial  governments  of  Western  and  Choiseul  Provinces,  international  relief  and  reconstruction \nagencies and other donor agencies such as NZAID and AusAID.   \nThese  same  stakeholders  also  will  have  opportunity  to  provide  inputs  and  comments  during  the \nimplementation stage, which is being led by the NDMO.  \nIs there a participation strategy? Yes \nA community participation strategy is integrated into the overall project design.  The reconstruction and \nrecovery strategy emphasizes (i) utilizing decentralized and transparent decision making and community \nparticipation  processes;  (ii)  providing  employment  opportunities  to  earthquake  and  tsunami  affected \ncommunities; (iii) building good working relationships with implementing agencies, church networks, and \ncommunity-based institutions; (iv) strengthening sustainable operation and maintenance capacity of the \nprovincial  governments.  Participatory  approaches  will  be  encouraged  in  designing  subprojects, \nimplementation, operation and maintenance, and monitoring and evaluation arrangements.  The process \nwill involve information sharing, consultations, interviews, focus group discussions, collaborative decision \nmaking. The subproject selection criteria include targeting of most affected groups, especially women and \nthe newly vulnerable groups, community consultations on subprojects, practical and feasible mechanisms \nsuch as labor based equipment supported (LBES) reconstruction works, preferential use of local labor and \nlocal procurement for livelihood support. \n \nD.  Gender and Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe SIEAP will restore and improve women\u2019s access to income generating activities, essential social \nservices,  community  structures,  decision-making  mechanisms  and  other  local  recovery  and \nreconstruction-related information. Improved water supply infrastructure and other public health and health \ncare benefits to women and their families and provide more time for productive income-generating \nactivities by reducing the drudgery of collecting water. \nThe SIEAP will be proactive in ensuring that women are involved in suitable infrastructure reconstruction \nand rehabilitation works. \nHas an output been prepared?

Introduction \n1.  On 2 April 2007 a massive undersea earthquake measuring 8.1 on the Richter scale \ntriggered a tsunami that struck the islands of Gizo, Simbo, Ranongga, Rendova, Shortlands, \nNew  Georgia,  Mono,  Vella  Lavella,  Kolombangara  and  Choiseul  in  Western  and  Choiseul \nProvinces of the Solomon Islands. The force of the earthquake was such that the physical \nenvironment of the islands and reefs changed. One side of Ranongga Island lifted some 3 \nmeters and some of the adjacent islands and reefs of Simbo and Rendova sunk, causing \nconcern about the impact on coastal vulnerability, ground water levels, agriculture, fisheries and \nlivelihoods.  \n2.  All  islands  in  the  affected  provinces  suffered  widespread  damage  to  housing, \ninfrastructure, schools, and medical facilities. Several villages were completely destroyed. Most \npeople from the affected areas have been traumatized by the events and have fled to higher \nground where they are being housed in makeshift camps.  Health conditions in the camps are \ninadequate with regard to water, food, sanitation and medical support.  \n3.  The Government formally requested ADB, on the basis of a Cabinet decision, to help \ncoordinate the reconstruction and rehabilitation process. To assist in planning its response, ADB \nrequires that the interventions be assessed for their possible impact on environmental values. \nThis Summary Initial Environment Examination (SIEE) report aims to (i) describe the Solomon \nIslands  Emergency  Assistance  Project  (SIEAP),  (ii)  describe  the  potential  environmental \nimpacts and corresponding mitigation measures, and (iii) explain the environmental assessment \nand review procedures that will be adopted during project implementation. The SIEE procedure \nfollows ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003) as \nwell as the Australian Government\u2019s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation \n(EPBC) Act.  \nB.  Description of Project \n4.  The goal of the project is to restore economic and social activities and accessibility in \naffected areas to pre-disaster levels and increase sustainability. The purpose is to assist the \ngovernment in rehabilitating damaged infrastructure and make it less vulnerable to climate \nchange and natural hazards. The rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure is expected to restore \naccessibility in rural areas, allow a resumption of economic activities and social services, and \nsafeguard public health., including: \n(i)  approximately 35 km of rural and town roads. Road rehabilitation is expected to \ninclude reshaping and resurfacing, repair of drains, and repair of culverts and \nother drainage structures. \n(ii)  About 19 rural bridges, include repair of foundations and abutments, and 35 \nculverts and water crossings. \n(iii)  About  five  wharves  and  jetties.  Wharf  and  jetty  rehabilitation  is  expected  to \ninclude repairs to above-water structures in about half the locations and complete \nreplacement in the other half. \n(iv)  The Gizo town water supply and sanitation system. Water supply rehabilitation is \nexpected  to  include  repairs  to  the  reservoir,  intake  structure,  pumps,  and \ndistribution system. Sanitation rehabilitation requires minor repairs. \n ", "Appendix 9  45 \n5.  All structures will be designed with the aim of ensuring that they can withstand future \nhigh levels of seismic activities, ocean waves and adverse climatic conditions.  \nC.  Description of the Environment \n1.  Physical Resources \n6.  Solomon Islands is an archipelago in the Southwest Pacific about 1,900 km northeast of \nAustralia comprising some 992 islands stretching over a 1,450 km chain southeast from Papua \nNew Guinea across the Coral Sea to Vanuatu. The terrain ranges from rugged mountainous \nvolcanic islands to low coral atoll islands and covers a total land area of 28,370 km2 with an \nExclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of about 1.3 million km2. The six major island groups form two \nroughly parallel island chains, with Choiseul, Isabel, and Malaita in the northern group and New \nGeorgia, Guadalcanal, and Makira in the south.  \n7.  The  affected  islands  of  Western  and  Choiseul  Provinces  include  Choiseul,  Gizo, \nKolombangara,  Mono,  New  Georgia,  Ranongga,  Rendova,  Shortlands,  Simbo,  and  Vella \nLavella. The large islands of Choiseul, New Georgia, Ranongga, Rendova, Kolombangara and \nVella Lavella have rain-forested mountain ranges of mainly volcanic origin, deeply entrenched \nnarrow valleys, and coastal belts fringed by reefs and lined with coconut palms. The smaller \nislands are low coral-based islands fringed with reefs. Western Province has an active volcano \non Simbo Islands and a marine volcano known as Kavachi. The country is geologically active, \nand earth tremors are frequent. The previous last major earthquake recorded was in 1977 when \nmore than 1,000 people were evacuated from the Weather Coast of Guadalcanal and resettled \non West Guadalcanal in the Aruligo area. Soil quality ranges from extremely rich volcanic soils \nto relatively infertile limestone-derived soils. \n8.  The islands' ocean-equatorial climate is extremely humid throughout the year, with a \nmean temperature of 27\u00b0C and few extremes of temperature or weather. June through August is \nslightly cooler. From April to October, the southeast trade winds blow, gusting at times to over \n30 knots. November to March is the wet season which is typically warmer and is accompanied \nby the northwest monsoon. The Solomon Islands experiences adequate rainfall throughout, with \nHoniara recording an annual average rainfall of 3,100 mm. Rainfall is well distributed throughout \nthe year with the maximum and minimum monthly rainfall being 11% (Feb and March) and 6% \n(June) of the total annual rainfall respectively. Cyclones have been recorded in the Solomon \nIslands in 1986 (Namu); 1993 (Nina); 1996 (Fergus); 2003 (Zoe) which have caused loss of life \nand resulted in heavy economic cost.  \n2.  Ecological Resources \n9.  The Solomon Islands State of the Environment (SOE) Report1 indicates that there is \ngreater animal diversity in Solomon Islands than anywhere else in the Pacific, especially in \navifauna. The plant life of the Solomon Islands also shows great diversity and endemism. Many \nunique species occur on only one or two islands making their populations vulnerable. \n10.  Western and Choiseul Provinces have two provincially designated marine protected \nareas or Locally Managed Marine Areas (LMMA), and the World Wide Fund for Nature\u2019s (WWF) \nGizo Marine Protected Areas. WWF also included the Western and Choiseul Provinces under \nits Bismack Solomon Seas Programme. \n                                                 \n1 Leary, T. 1993. Solomon Islands State of the Environment Report. Strategic Action Programme for International \nWaters, South Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP). Apia, Western Samoa \n ", "46  Appendix 9 \n3.  Economic Development \n11.  Most of the Western and Choiseul populace live in rural areas and derive their income \nfrom  a  mix  of  subsistence  and  semi-commercial  agricultural  activities,  however  these  two \nprovinces also contribute to the export earning for the country from its copra, tuna cannery and \nlogging activities. Soltai Ltd, the Solomon Islands Government and Western Province joint \nventure tuna fishing and cannery company at Noro, is the largest employer in the region with up \nto 200 personnel. Tourism, particularly diving, is also an important service industry for Western \nProvince.  However  growth  in  tourism  is  hampered  by  lack  of  infrastructure  and  transport \nlimitations. Much of the limited infrastructure in place has been destroyed by the earthquake and \ntsunami leaving even less basis for growth than before. \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n12.  The main objective of the Project is to put in place an emergency rehabilitation project to \nurgently  restore  physical  infrastructure  and  the  livelihoods  of  communities  that  have  been \ndevastated by the tsunami and earthquake. The Environmental Management and Monitoring \nPlan (EMMP) has been prepared so as to create awareness and provide guidance within the \nreconstruction teams. The adoption of the EMMP within the reconstruction process will ensure \nthat future environmental risks are lessened.  \n13.  The most damage was sustained on Gizo and Choiseul islands. Infrastructure damage \nincludes: \nRoads and bridges: On Gizo, about 17km of road, 11 bridges and 24 cross culverts were \ndestroyed with major scouring and wash-out of road pavement materials. On Choiseul \nabout 23km of road in south Choiseul, 24 bridges and 24 culverts were completely \ndestroyed. On New Georgia island, 14.5km of roads suffered major damage and 5 \nbridges were completely destroyed. On Kolombangara island, one bridge was destroyed \nand a few isolated road sections suffered major damage. On Vella Lavella island, while \nthere  has  been  no  major  damage  to  the  road,  two  bridges  have  been  completely \ndestroyed. \nWharves and jetties: Ranongga\u2019s two wharves were totally destroyed. The earthquake \nlifted the island by about three meters and the formerly productive reef surrounding the \nisland which provided the main source of sea food is exposed, and the ecosystem will \ntake decades to re-establish.  On New Georgia and Kolombangara islands, the two main \nwharves at Munda and Ringi Cove were completely destroyed, and the jetty at Nusa \nTupe island, which provided the main link and services for tourists to Gizo has also been \ncompletely destroyed. Munda wharf which provided services to populations on the south \nis no longer serviceable. On Rendova, the two main wharves, Ughele and Kokelo have \nbeen completely destroyed. On Vella Lavella two main wharves servicing the north east \npopulations at Lambulabu and Boro have also been completely destroyed. The wharf at \nVonunu did not sustain any major damage but the concrete apron to the deck and the \nprotection works to the causeway sustained major damage.  On Simbo Island, the 50 m \nbridge connecting the road to Nusa Simbo has been completely destroyed. Simbo island \nhas sunk by about 2 m. The wharf and the causeway at Legana Station have subsided \nand are under water during high tides and barely exposed during low tides. Other \nwharves  destroyed  include  the  Korovou  and  Nila  wharves  on  Shortlands  and  the \nFalamae wharf on Mono Island. Three major wharves located in Choiseul have been \ntotally destroyed. These include Taro, Katurasele and Posaare wharves.  \nWater Supply: The Gizo water supply suffered extensive damage from the earthquake \nand tsunami. The earthquake caused ruptures and loosened joints of the water pipes, \n ", "Appendix 9  47 \ndestabilized foundations and walls of reservoirs, intakes, and storage tanks, blocked \nintake sources with landslide debris and boulders, and destabilized the foundations of \nthe pump-house. The tsunami scoured the pipe trenches eroding the beddings and \nbroke the water pipes at several locations. \n14.  The  project  will  address  the  repair  and  re-construction  of  physical  infrastructure \nincluding: rural and town roads, bridges and culverts, wharves and jetties, and the Gizo town \nwater supply. Reconstruction will be required for: (i) existing facilities in their present locations \nand (ii) where facilities are so badly damaged new facilities may be erected in the same \nlocations, or they may be relocated. Where reconstruction activities are to be undertaken at pre-\nexisting locations there will be few environmental concerns as the facility has an established \nfootprint in the area and the conditions outlined within the EMMP can be applied. Where new \nlocations are required and depending on the magnitude and the location of the facility to be \nreconstructed, additional environmental assessment may be necessary.   \n15.  In designing the rehabilitation activities and in the conduct of actual construction works, \nlocal communities will be consulted and their concerns will be incorporated in the plans and \nprograms of activities.  \nE.   The Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan \n16.  Impacts  have  been  identified  for  the  various  project  activities  for  pre-construction, \nconstruction and operation. The activities mainly relate to design measures and construction \nimpacts. While many different types of infrastructure reconstruction will be addressed by the \nproject, the activities that have been identified within the SIEE and EMMP are considered \nrepresentative of the expected range of activities. Within the EMMP, mitigation and monitoring \nmeasures are developed for each activity and responsibilities allocated for these. The EMMP is \ndescribed in the following sections for the activities according to pre-construction, construction \nand operation. A matrix of the EMMP is attached as Table A9.1.  \n1.  Pre-construction \n17.  Pre-construction activities address design and planning issues and include (i) siting of \ninfrastructure, (ii) land and property acquisition (when necessary) and social concerns, (iii) \nsourcing construction materials, and (iv) inclusion of seismic risk and projected climate change \nin the design. These issues will be transferred to a design brief which identifies the Design \nEngineer as being responsible for addressing these issues. All of these issues will need to be \naddressed before reconstruction activities commence: \nSourcing construction materials: Sources of rock, gravel and sand will be required for \nreconstruction activities. Where existing sources are available with some form of proxy \napproval, they can be used. Where new extraction sites are to be opened, approval will \nneed to be obtained from the relevant authority or landowner. Compensation will be \npayable  for  any  new  material  sites  that  are  located  on  private  land.  Selection  and \napproval of quarries and borrow pits will be the responsibility of the Design Engineer with \nassistance from the EMC. Ensuring operation follows approved quarries plans will be the \nresponsibility of the Supervising Engineer. \nInclusion of seismic risk in design: Assessment of the seismic risk and inclusion within \nthe design will be addressed by the Design Engineer. \nInclusion of climate proofing in design: Climate change is expected to increase extreme \nweather events, in particular intense rainfall and wave surges, and to cause sea level \nrise. While climate change influenced design criteria are not available for the Solomon \nIslands the methodology to incorporate climate proofing within design is detailed in an \n ", "48  Appendix 9 \nADB  publication.2  The  Design  Engineer  will  be  responsible  for  incorporating  climate \nchange requirements within the structural designs. \n2.  Construction \n18.  Construction related activities include (i) removal and disposal of debris, (ii) controlling \nerosion  and  sediment  movement,  runoff  and  storm  water,  (iii)  excavation  of  sites  and \nmanagement of spoil and stockpiles, (iv) storage and handling of materials including fuel and \nlubricants,  (v)  siting  and  management  of  construction  camps,  (vi)  noise  and  dust  from \nconstruction activities, (vii) worker and local community health and safety, (viii) vehicle and \nmachinery  hazards  to  communities  and  other  road  users,  (ix)  solid  and  liquid  waste \nmanagement, and (x) rehabilitation and closing of construction sites. Re-construction impacts \nwill be short term and can be readily mitigated by addressing the EMMP requirements. The \noverall responsibility for the completion of the work and direction of the contractor or labor to \nmeet the EMMP requirements will be the responsibility of the Project Supervising Engineer (SE) \nwho will be supported by the Environment Management Consultant (EMC). \n3.  Operation  \n19.  The only issue that has been identified for operation is to ensure that the infrastructure is \nnow adequately maintained. Maintenance will be supported by an adequate budget allocation \nand the development of awareness within the responsible ministry to undertake this on a timely \nbasis. Maintenance will be undertaken by community groups who could do this under the \ndirection of local government councils. \nF.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring \n20.  The  Environment  Act  of  1998  defines  the  responsibilities  of  the  Environment  and \nConservation  Division  and  establishes  a  framework  for  environmental  assessment.  The \nprincipal national government agency charged with environmental policy, management and \nmonitoring responsibilities is the Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) of the \nMinistry of Natural Resources. However the capacity for project environmental management is \nbeing built within the MID and particularly in this situation, which is one of emergency relief, the \nSolomon Islands Government will allow the requirements of the IEE to be used as the basis for \nestablishing environmental compliance.  \n21.  In the event that a subproject design undergoes changes following the approval of the \nSIEE and the new design has elements that impinge on the environmental impacts identified \nand addressed in the original SIEE/EMMP, or introduces new potential environment impacts, \nthe  SIEE/EMMP  must  be  revised  and  be  subjected  to  reapproval,  to  address  these  new \nimpacts. \n22.  The National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) will be the implementing agency for \nthe Project. A Project Management Unit (PMU) will be created within the NDMO to administer \nand coordinate daily activities of the project. An Environment Management Consultant (EMC) \nwill be appointed to the PMU who will report to the PM and will organize the implementation of \nthe EMMP together with the Supervising Engineer (SE).  \n                                                 \n2 ADB. 2005. Climate Proofing A Risk Based Approach to Adaptation, Pacific Studies Series, Manila \n ", "Appendix 9  49 \nG.  Public Information and Information Disclosure \n23.  A second ADB and MID engineers team, together with an environmental consultant as \nwell  as  a  social  and  poverty  impact  assessor  have  evaluated  these  damaged  areas  and \ndetermined the initial reconstruction requirements.  Further consultations were held with national \nand provincial government officials as well as the communities of the affected areas.  \n24.  Public consultation will be an essential part of the relief effort so as to ensure that the \ncommunity  requirements are being addressed within the project design and reconstruction \nactivities. Public consultation will be undertaken by the NDC with support from the PMU so as to \nallow the community to identify with the reconstruction process.  \nH.  Findings, Recommendations, and Conclusion \n25.  The activities outlined in the project are mainly clean up, repair and rehabilitation of \ndamaged infrastructure along narrow infrastructure corridors. These activities are expected to \nhave no significant negative impacts on the environment, and mitigating measures can be put in \nplace.  \n26.  The activities identified in the EMMP will allow damaged infrastructure to be repaired \nand reconstructed providing it is not located within any environmentally sensitive area. The \nEMMP provides realizable mitigation measures that are Best Construction Practices and that \nwill enhance the environmental sustainability of the relief operation. Compliance monitoring of \nthe mitigation measures will be the responsibility of the Site Engineer who will be supported in \nthis role by an Environment Management Consultant.  \n27.  It is recommended that the project proceeds as planned and that the mitigating and \nmonitoring measures that have been identified within the EMMP are implemented during the \npre-construction,  operation  and  maintenance  phases  of  the  project\u2019s  implementation  by \nincorporation into contracts of services. Based on the IEE findings it is concluded that there are \nno outstanding environmental issues remaining and no further environmental assessment is \nrequired for the project. If any work is required within environmentally sensitive areas these \nactivities will need to be assessed according to ADB environmental safeguards. \n \n ", " \nTable A9.1: ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING PLAN  5\n0\n \n \nA\n  IMPACT MITIGATION  IMPACT MONITORING  p\np\ne\nProject  Potential  Proposed Mitigation Measure  Implementing  Mitigation  Parameter  to  Frequency  Monitoring  Monitoring  n\nd\nActivity  Environmental  Responsibility  Cost   be monitored  and means of  responsibility  ix\nCost    9\nImpact  Verification    \nPRE-CONSTRUCTION               \nSiting of re- Intrusion into  a.

A project performance and monitoring system will be established within 3 months of \ngrant  effectiveness.  Performance  indicators  to  be  monitored  before,  during,  and  after \nconstruction  should  include  those  for  (i)  economic  development,  (ii)  transport  sector \nperformance,  (iii)  socioeconomic  development,  (iv)  environmental  impacts,  and  (v) \nmaintenance.  Based  on  these  guidelines  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  and  the  Project \nManagement  and  Capacity  Building  Unit  (PMCBU)  will  develop  quantitative  indicators  for \nmonitoring and evaluating project performance in relation to its goals and purposes before \nproject commencement, and will refine these indicators during project implementation. \n2.  Baseline data for these indicators, which will be collected during the subproject feasibility \nanalysis, will be monitored after subproject completion. Some baseline data might become \navailable  from  two  national  surveys\u2014of  household  income  and  expenditure,  and  of \ndemographics and health\u2014to be conducted in 2006\u20132007. Monitoring and evaluation will be \nbased on gender-disaggregated data where feasible. The PMCBU will monitor and evaluate \nprogress on these indicators annually, and provide a final report within 6 months of the end of \nthe contract. \nA.  Economic Development \n3.   Improved accessibility is expected to increase output volume and prices of agricultural \ncommodities in the subproject areas. Baseline data on the production and prices of copra, \ncocoa, and market produce should be collected and updated. \n4.  Baseline data on formal and informal employment, disaggregated by sector or activity, \nshould be collected and updated. During and after rehabilitation, data should be kept on the \namount of employment created in rehabilitation and regular maintenance. \n5.  Indicators for annual household income and sources of income should be developed, \nbaseline data collected, and updated annually. The percentage of poverty or hardship of the \npopulation or households in the project area also should be estimated. \nB.  Transport Sector Performance \n6.  Subproject feasibility studies will document the conditions of roads, and measure and \nforecast  a  range  of  technical  performance  indicators  (Table  A10.1).  Appropriate  indicators \nshould be developed for rural conditions, which can be used during feasibility surveys, updated \nafter rehabilitation, and monitored before and after annual maintenance. In addition, because \ntransport demand is linked to gross domestic product (GDP), the real annual GDP growth rates \nfor the country (and for the provinces, where available) should be reported with the results.   \n \nTable A10.1: Transport Sector Performance Indicators \nItem  Indicators  Remarks \nCondition  \u2022  Roughness  \u2022  Poor/fair/good \n\u2022  Accessibility  \u2022  All weather/seasonal \nPerformance  \u2022  Traffic volumes  \u2022  AADT \n\u2022  Traffic growth  \u2022  % per year \n\u2022  Travel times to key destinations  \u2022  Average  \n ", "64  Appendix 10 \nItem  Indicators  Remarks \n\u2022  Vehicle ownership  \u2022  By vehicle type \n\u2022  Frequency of public transport services  \u2022  Number per day \n\u2022  Cost of passenger transport services  \u2022  SBD per kilometer \n\u2022  Cost of freight transport services  \u2022  SBD per kilometer \n\u2022  Accident rates  \u2022  Number per year \nAADT = average annual daily traffic, SBD \u2013 Solomon Islands dollar. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \nC.

Indicators  should  be  developed  on  access  to  social  services,  including  school \nenrollment, visits to health facilities, and visits to government centers. \n8.  In addition to the economic development indicators specified above, information on \ngender-specific impacts of the Project should be developed, including increased employment \nand income for women and youth.  \nD.  Environmental Impacts \n9.  The summary initial environmental examination for the Project includes environmental \nmanagement plans that identify specific environmental impacts that must be monitored during \nand after rehabilitation.  \nE.  Road Maintenance Inputs \n10.  All road maintenance work, including routine and periodic work carried out by traditional \nand labor-based equipment supported methods, should be recorded, including (i) nature of the \nwork; (ii) physical quantities of work performed; (iii) cost of the work; (iv) form of execution (by \ndirect labor, small contract, or large contractor); and (v) location and extent of the work.   \n \n ", "  Appendix 11  65   \nRESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \nA.  Project Background \n1.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate  infrastructure  that  was  damaged  by  the  2  April  2007 \nearthquake and tsunami in Choiseul and Western provinces, including (i) approximately 35 \nkilometers of rural and town roads, along with about 19 bridges and 35 culverts, (ii) about four \nwharves and one jetty, and (iii) the Gizo town water supply and sanitation system. The Project \nwill be implemented via a sector approach.  \n2.  All civil works are expected to be conducted on existing facilities within existing rights of \nway, therefore they will most likely not require land acquisition or involuntary resettlement. \nHowever it is possible that construction clearing to original designs and minor realignments \nnecessitated by disaster damage could cause resettlement impacts. Therefore, this framework \nprovides a screening mechanism, which will identify possible resettlement impacts for each \nrehabilitation activity before the commencement of civil works, and provides guidelines on how \nto address them if they occur. In any case, the number of potentially affected households is \nsmall and within the category of \u201cinsignificant resettlement impacts\u201d under ADB\u2019s policy on \nInvoluntary Resettlement (1995).  \n3.  In  the  rare  event  that  an  activity  requires  physical  or  economic  displacement, \nResettlement Plans (RP) will be prepared. This Resettlement Framework (RF) outlines the \nresettlement  policy  principles,  procedures,  and  institutional  arrangements  to  ensure  that  if \nresettlement needs are identified, the project Executing Agency (EA) follows the procedures for \ninvoluntary resettlement in compliance with the Government\u2019s applicable laws and regulations, \nand ADB\u2019s policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and Handbook on Resettlement (1998), \nand the agreed resettlement framework for the Project.    \nB.  Land Tenure and Management \n4.  Traditional land and resource management in Solomon Islands is community based. \nSome 87 per cent of land is under customary resource tenure and all natural resources i.e. \nforests, minerals, reefs, and islets belong to customary land owners.1 The remaining land, \nincluding that of Gizo town, is considered \u201calienated\u201d and is subject to registration under the \nLand and Titles Act 1988. The Act covers customary land rights which includes land owned, \nused or occupied by a person or community in accordance with current customary usage. \n5.  Access to land and resources is bound in social relationships and expressed as \u201crights\u201d \nto exploit resources. Small kin-ship based groups living in villages manage their own resources \nand exercise the right to exploit them. The clan or kin group, known as a \u2018line\u2019, is made up of \n\u201cprimary right holders\u201d - the leaders of the clan or group - who collectively have the authority to \nallocate use rights through the spokesman of the line. The rest of the line holds \u201csecondary\u201d \nrights. Such rights may be inherited or gained through marriage to a primary rights holder.  The \ntransfer of rights differ with custom from island to island, some islands (Guadalcanal, Central \nand Western provinces) typically practice matrilineal inheritance and the remaining provinces \npractice patrilineal inheritance.2 \n                                                 \n1  Exemptions being the lands of the federal capital area (Honiara) and provincial headquarters. \n2  A small area on Guadalcanal \u2013 Marau \u2013 practices patrilineal inheritance due to influence of customs of Malaita \nthrough Malaitans which have relocated to Guadalcanal. \n ", "66  Appendix 11 \n6.  Acquisition of customary land is usually only undertaken for non-public works such as \ngold mines, oil palm plantations, or hotels. For public works requiring location on customary \nland, MID, Solomon Islands Electricity Authority, and Solomon Islands Water Authority (SIWA) \ntypically consult with the members of a line and any other person who claims an interest in the \nland. For public works the land is not acquired as such, it is gifted or contributed following an \nextensive  period  of  consultation  and  agreement  through  signing  of  a  Memorandum  of \nUnderstanding (MOU). The MOU waives the customary interest in the land in lieu of the public \ninfrastructure (wharves, roads, schools, clinics and other public utilities). \n7.  A recent exception is the land set aside for the Koguli Reservoir in Honiara, which has \nbeen leased by SIWA from the customary land owners. Other exceptions are projects funded \nthrough international aid assistance where the donor agency has insisted on registration of the \nland, which in effect alienates the land from customary ownership and must go through both a \ncustomary process for identifying those with an interest in the land as well as the process \nestablished in the Land and Titles Act. This process involves: \n\u2022  Commissioner of Lands or Provincial Secretary appointing an Acquisition Officer; \n\u2022  The  Acquisition  Officer,  who  has  the  power  of  a  Magistrate,  after  a  series  of \nmeetings  and  hearings,  identifies a  group  of  trustees  (of  between  two  and  five \npeople) who will represent the line in the acquisition process; \n\u2022  A notice is published specifying the date of the next hearing and listing the people \ninitially identified as trustees; \n\u2022  Following the hearing, a second notice is published and posted in public places \nnominating the trustees. The notification process is three months during which time \nappeals as to the nomination of trustees can be made; \n\u2022  If there is an appeal, adjudication can be a two step process (as described in Item C. \nbelow); \n\u2022  If there are no appeals as to the trustees, the area is surveyed and a Land Officer \nprepares a valuation report and certificate. Discussions are held with the trustees \nabout  whether  the  transaction  will  be  through  lease  arrangements  or  complete \nacquisition, as well as initial discussions about the price; \n\u2022  Final negotiations are held with the trustees based on the valuation report and their \nown determination of the price for the land; \n\u2022  According to the Act, agreement to the compensation award must be obtained from \nthe \u201cmajority\u201d of persons with an interest in the land; and \n\u2022  Following agreement on the price the payment is made, a one-off payment (known \nas the premium) for acquired land or a premium plus rent for leased land.  The Lands \nand  Titles  Act  specified  the  term  of  a  lease  as  33  years  unless  an  alternative \nagreement is reached. \n\u2022  Acquisition  of  alienated  land  follows  the  procedure  for  acquiring  alienated  or \nregistered land established in the Land and Titles Act. The process is more straight-\nforward  than  that  of  dealing  with  customary  land.  This  process  is  essentially  a \ntransaction between the Commissioner of Lands, through an Acquisition Officer and \nValuation Officer and the land-owner. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 11  67   \nC.  Resolving Disputes over Land Ownership \n8.  Any  disputes  arising  over  alienated  land,  usually  in  relation  to  compensation  as \nownership is clear, are referred to the Magistrates Court and follow the procedure set out in the \nLand and Titles Act and civil code. \n9.  For disputes over customary land, there is a two-step process; (i) the civil procedure \nthrough the Magistrates Court, and (ii) the customary procedure. \n10.  The hearing in the Magistrates Court will determine whether the case can be dealt with \nthrough civil proceedings or whether the case is better handled through the customary process. \n11.  The customary process starts with Chief Hearings, proceeds to the Local Court if not \nsettled, and if still not resolved after is presented as a case before the Customary Land Appeal \nCourt (CLAC), which usually settles the case.  In the event that the appellant is not satisfied with \nthe ruling of the CLAC, appeals may be brought before the High Court but only on points of law \nrather than disputes about ownership.  In some cases the CLAC will refer the case back to the \nChief Hearings where the CLAC is of the view that the Chiefs can adequately determine \ngenealogy and therefore ownership of, or interest in, the land under dispute. \nD.  Policy Framework and Entitlements \n12.  As  noted  above  the  current  legislation  governing  land  acquisition  for  public  or \ndevelopment purposes is the Land and Titles Act. Sections 71 through 85 of the Act deal with \nland acquisition for public purposes and sections 184 through 190 set out the requirements for \npublic rights-of-way. \n13.  The  legislation  does  not  cover  project-affected  people  without  titles  or  ownership \nrecords, such as informal settlers/squatters (non-titled APs), while they are covered under \nADB\u2019s policy.   \n14.  The Act provides for compensation to be paid (i) in the form of rental for any land used \nor occupied on a temporary basis or (ii) for permanent acquisition of the land.  Compensation is \nassessed on such things as the condition of the land, use of the land and impact on the value of \ncontiguous land, and while the Act includes a provision for interest to be paid it is not free of \ntaxes or other deductions and does not necessarily constitute market or replacement value, as \nrequired under ADB\u2019s policy.  \n15.  Furthermore,  the  legislation  does  not  take  account  of  the  social  and  economic \nconsequence in terms of restoration of livelihoods and incomes. Thus, owing to the absence of \na policy consistent with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and poverty reduction, the \nprovisions in this project-specific RF will be adopted. The RF and resettlement procedural \nguideline stipulations contained in this document will apply to all subprojects to be prepared and \napproved under the Project. \n16.  The RF reflects the Government\u2019s land acquisition laws/regulations and ADB\u2019s policy on \ninvoluntary resettlement and guidelines. It stipulates eligibility and provisions for compensating \nall types of losses (land, crops/trees, structures, business/employment, workdays/wages and \naccess to assets). All affected people (APs) and households, including non-titled or informal \ndwellers, will be compensated for lost assets (crops, structures, trees) and will receive (i) \ncompensation at replacement value in cash or kind , and (ii) other resettlement assistance such \nas  shifting  allowance,  assistance  to  rebuild  structures  and  compensation  for  loss  of \nworkdays/income due to dislocation. Lost livelihoods and incomes will be replaced by new \nincomes sources and livelihoods, which ensure that the living conditions of the affected people \n ", "68  Appendix 11 \nare equal or higher the pre-project levels. Titled APs will receive compensation for land acquired \nby the project at replacement cost, this will be in cash at replacement value or land-for-land (of \nequal size and/or productive value and be satisfactory to the AP). Non-titled APs are not eligible \nfor compensation for land but will receive compensation for assets attached to land and other \nassistance as required (especially in the case of poor or vulnerable APs) and will be assisted to \nhave a legal and affordable access to land (through leasing agreements etc.). Households \nheaded by women and other vulnerable households such as those with handicapped and \nelderly people will be eligible for further assistance to fully mitigate project impacts.

Screening of subprojects \n17.  Subproject screening is  used  to  identify  the types  and nature  of  potential  impacts \nrelated to the activities proposed under the Project, and to provide adequate measures to \naddress these impacts which ensure that potential APs are: \n\u2022  Informed about their options and rights pertaining to resettlement; \n\u2022  Included in the consultation process and given the opportunity to participate in the \nselection of technically and economically feasible alternatives; and \n\u2022  Provided with prompt and effective compensation at full replacement cost for losses \nof land, assets and access to assets and livelihoods attributable to the subproject(s). \n18.  On the basis of the screening, the EA proposes which of the following option should be \nput in place: \n\u2022  an  option  assessment  of  alternative  subproject  designs  in  view  to  avoid  and/or \nreduce displacement risks; \n\u2022  the  elaboration  of  an  RP  to  address  all  resettlement  risks  (see  draft  terms  of \nreference in Annex C); \n\u2022  For projects not anticipated to result in displacement, and where loss of assets are \nanticipated  to  be  negligible,  then  this  information  shall  also  be  indicated  in  the \nsubproject application form along with a request to waive the requirement for a RP.  \n19.  The screening process is described in annex A. It is based on the screening checklist \n(Annex B), which will be completed by the PMCBU. The screening form will be approved by \nADB, which will advise whether an additional assessment should be done to avoid or reduce the \nphysical or economic displacement or whether the argument of the subproject proposal provides \nsufficient evidence for the decision proposed and confirm the best course of action. \n ", "70  Appendix 11 \nF.  Procedure for Resettlement Plan Preparation \n20.  If the screening identifies possible resettlement impacts, a Resettlement Plan (RP) will \nbe prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and the \nHandbook on Resettlement (1998) and in close collaboration with those affected. The RP must \ncomply with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement and other social safeguard policies (such \nas its policy on indigenous peoples) and establish a safety net mechanism and assist in the \nidentification of appropriate livelihood restoration measures. Detailed terms of reference (based \non the draft in Annex C), approved by ADB, will be given to the consultants to ensure that RPs \nmeet ADB\u2019s policy requirements. RPs will be reviewed by the EA and submitted to ADB for \nreview and approval. \n21.  If impacts on indigenous people are identified, and these impacts are likely to be \nsignificant, then either a specific action will need to be included in the RP or a stand-alone \nindigenous peoples development plan (IPDP) must be prepared according to ADB\u2019s Policy on \nIndigenous Peoples (1998).  In the event that an IPDP is required detailed TOR, approved by \nADB, will be given to the consultants to ensure that the IPDP meets ADB\u2019s policy requirements. \nThe IPDP will be reviewed by the EA and submitted to ADB for review and approval. \n22.  For subprojects, the EAs will carry out social impact assessment surveys (census and \n20% socioeconomic survey of those affected), based on preliminary technical designs. An \ninventory of losses (IOL) will be completed for all APs losing land or assets to the Project.  The \nRP will also include measures to ensure that socioeconomic conditions, needs, and priorities of \nwomen  are  identified,  and  to  ensure  that  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  does  not \ndisadvantage women. Consultants preparing the RPs must be familiar with ADB\u2019s requirements \nand have a track record of preparing satisfactory RPs. \n23.  The RP will include a budget for RP implementation identifying where the funds will \ncome from and an implementation schedule linked with the civil works. Construction civil works \nwill  not  commence  until  compensation  has  been  paid  to  APs  (see  paragraph  24  below). \nCompensation will be determined based on published rates from relevant government agencies \n(as set out in Item G) with additional grants as required to ensure compensation at replacement \nvalue  and livelihood restoration. \nG.  Institutional Responsibilities \n24.  The Ministry of Infrastructure Development, as EA of the Project, will implement any \nrequired  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  program  with  the  assistance  of  the  Project \nManagement and Capacity Building Unit (PMCBU) for the Project. The EA will undertake a land \nacquisition survey, census, and the IOL survey, and prepare the RP and proposals for land \nacquisition with the help of a qualified social scientist. During the process, the EA will ensure \nthat entitlements and mitigation measures are established in the RP consistent with this RF; and \nsuitable budgetary provisions are made for timely RP implementation. The EA will also ensure \nthat the RP is submitted to ADB for approval, and that funds for entitlements under the RP are \nfully provided by the Government to people affected prior to the award of the civil work contract \nand before acquiring any land, changing land use patterns or restricting people\u2019s access to \ncommon land for the purposes of the Project. \n25.  Depending on the nature of assets to be acquired other government agencies will be \ninvolved in establishing compensation rates.  Based on scheduled rates the replacement value \nwill be determined in consultation and negotiation especially in respect of assets on customary \nland. \n ", "  Appendix 11  71   \n26.  For removal of crops and trees, compensation will be based on the published schedules \nof Ministry of Agriculture (Agricultural Extension Division) for root crops and tree crops and \nMinistry of Forests, Environment and Conservation (Forestry Division\u2014Commercial Section) for \nplantation trees and wood/timber trees. The rates for root crops are based on value of product \nper m2 and tree crops are valued according to age, size and productivity of individual trees.  The \ncrop rate schedule has recently been updated but has not been gazetted as yet. The rates for \ntimber or wood trees are based on size and grade (quality) of logs per m3. The August 2006 \nschedule was updated in April 2007. \n27.  Structures  (houses  and  commercial  structures)  are  valued  through  the  Ministry  of \nLands,  Housing  and  Survey  (Housing  Division).  Government  or  state  buildings  are  valued \naccording to condition and vary from $700/m2 for poor condition buildings to $2,800/m2 for good \ncondition buildings. Private buildings are valued at replacement rate plus relocation expenses. \n28.  Land is also valued through Ministry of Lands, Housing and Survey (Commissioner of \nLands).  A valuation report is prepared based on the size and condition of land and closest \ncomparable values that are obtainable. This can be difficult in respect of customary land or land \nlocated on remote islands as there is little exchange of land and often the closest value land can \nbe \u201crated\u201d land which is urban or township land.  The negotiation process to arrive at an agreed \nprice for customary land can be lengthy. Alienated land is easier to value because it is has been \nregistered and effectively exists within a functioning real estate market. \n29.  All  scheduled  rates  should  be  verified  through  a  market  appraisal  undertaken  by \nPMCBU which will undertake a brief survey of market rates and comparison with the scheduled \nrates.  Additional  grants  may  be  needed  to  \u201ctop-up\u201d  the  rates  of  some  assets  where  the \npublished rates do not reflect market or replacement value. \nH.  Consultation, Information Disclosure, and Grievance Redress \n30.  The RPs will be prepared and implemented in close consultation with affected persons \nand communities. The PMCBU will consult affected households, leaders, and representatives of \ncommunity  associations  to  ascertain  their  needs  and  concerns  about  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement.  The  PMCBU  will  inform  affected  people  of  their  entitlements  through  public \nconsultations.  A resettlement booklet containing the entitlement matrix, measurement of losses, \ndetailed  asset  valuations,  grievance  procedures,  timing  of  payments  and  displacement \nschedules will be distributed to the affected people and read in pigin or any other local language \nto those, who have problems to read English, while the RPs will be made available for further \nreference in public places in the vicinity of the Project. The EA will ensure the participation of \nAPs in the implementation of the RP, and consultation will be detailed in the RP.  \n31.  The PMCBU will establish an independent grievance redress mechanism to receive and \naddress concerns that are raised by affected persons and provide for recourses to resolve \ndisputes in an impartial manner. Through public consultations, those affected will be informed \nthat they have a right to grievance resolution and where they can voice them. Other than \ndisputes  relating  to  land  ownership  rights  under  the  appropriate  court  of  law,  grievance \nprocedures will address all resettlement benefits, relocation, and other assistance. It will be \nimportant the grievance redress mechanism reflects the existing process for resolving land \ndisputes, especially in respect of customary land. Beside this grievance redress mechanism \ndirectly related to the project, people who are directly, materially and adversely affected by ADB \noperations during formulation, processing, or implementation can also file a complaint under \nADB\u2019s Accountability Mechanism. According to ADB\u2019s Communication Policy the approved RP \nwill be uploaded to ADB\u2019s website and disclosed to the affected people.   \n ", "72  Appendix 11 \nI.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n32.  The RP will contain a monitoring framework and the EA will establish a monitoring \nsystem within the PMCBU to monitor reconstruction and livelihood restoration of all affected \npersons  on  a  quarterly  basis.  The  PMCBU  will  monitor  the  progress  of  all  aspects  of \nresettlement and land acquisition, if any. It will particularly monitor the delivery of resettlement \nentitlements  to  displaced  and  affected  households.  The  PMCBU  will  involve  leaders  and \nrepresentatives of community associations to monitor the programs. The PMCBU will submit a \nquarterly review on resettlement and land acquisition through EA to ADB for review. ADB review \nmissions will specifically check the progress of resettlement and land acquisition programs. \n \n ", "    \nAnnex A: Decision Tree for Sub-project Preparation and Approval \n \n \n \nADB: APPROVE,   \nIdentify monitoring \nrequirements   \n \nRefer to Form 1:   \nScreening Checklist, \nRefer to Form 2: Project Report Form  Refer to Chapters 7 and 8   \n \n1.
