THE PROPOSAL \n  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the additional financing of the  Rural Connectivity \nImprovement Project. The additional financing is required to scale up the current project by adding \napproximately 930 kilometers (km) of rural roads. \n  To improve the road network connecting the rural population to agriculture value chain \ndevelopment zones, the Rural Connectivity Improvement Project  (i) upgrades about 1,700 km of \nrural roads to all-weather standards with climate resilience and safety features in 34 districts in \nfive divisions, (ii) improves the capacity of the rural infrastructure agency, and (iii) finances \nenhancements to the national rural road master plan using a geographic information system.1 \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n  The project meets the eligibility criteria for additional financing and is performing well.  \n(i)  Implementation progress is satisfactory. Works packages comprise 80% of \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) financing. To date, bids have been received for \n60 out of the 67 packages (totaling $163 million); of these 48 works contracts have \nbeen signed ($139 million), two packages are pending approval by the ministry ($6 \nmillion), and ten packages are being evaluated. The remaining seven packages \nare at preparation or rebidding stage. Contract awards amount to $115.3 million \n(139% of baseline projections) and disbursements amount to $20.8 million (151% \nof baseline).  \n(ii)  Delivery of expected outputs is rated  successful. The Local Government \nEngineering Division (LGED) is making progress toward achieving the expected \noutputs by 2023. For output 1, works have started for 37 packages and the \nremaining  procurement  is  ongoing.  For  outputs  2  and  3,  the  recruitment  of \nconsultancy firms is ongoing and mobilization is anticipated in the third quarter of \n2020.  The  mobilization  of  the  project  implementation  support  consultant  is \nexpected in June 2020. The project is on track to achieve the project outcome. \n(iii)  Safeguards policy requirements. All safeguard covenants are being complied \nwith. \n(iv)  Management  of  risks  is  rated  successful.  All  risks  detailed  in  the  risk \nassessment and risk management plan are being managed successfully.2 \n(v)  Project performance. The project has been rated on track since its effectiveness.  \n  In 2017, LGED in the Local Government Division of the Ministry of Local Government, \nRural Development and Cooperatives prepared the detailed design of a loan project totaling $300 \nmillion and covering 2,672 km of rural roads in 34 districts.3 The project amount was subsequently \napproved by ADB for $200 million with a reduced scope.4 The additional financing is to scale up \n \n1  ADB. 2018.

Manila \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n2  Bids for the eight works packages as pilot contracts, including a 5-year maintenance component, have been received. \nThree contracts were awarded in 2019, and the remaining packages are expected to be awarded by 31 May 2020.  \n3  ADB. 2016. Project Design Advance for Bangladesh: Rural Infrastructure Maintenance Program. Manila. \n4  ADB Board approved the current project for a regular loan of $100 million (Loan 3731-BAN) and a concessional loan \nof $100 million (Loan 3732-BAN) on 5 November 2018. The loan agreements were signed on 13 January 2019 and \ndeclared effective on 13 February 2019. The current project is to be implemented over 5 years and both loans will \n \n ", "2 \nthe first output of the current project from 1,700 km to 2,630 km of rural roads in 16 districts, and \nis  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2020\u20132022. 5  The  design  and \nimplementation arrangements for the current project will be used to expedite results, while the  \nimpact and outcome of the overall project will be enhanced by covering additional geographic \nareas and increasing beneficiaries.6 The overall project scope remains (i) technically feasible and \neconomically viable; (ii) aligned with the government\u2019s priorities under the Seventh Five Year \nPlan, FY2016\u2013FY2020;7 (iii) consistent with the project\u2019s development objectives and ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020;8 and (iv) aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational \npriorities of (a) promoting rural development and food security, (b) tackling climate change, \nbuilding climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; and (c) \nstrengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity.9 The  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19) \npandemic has significantly reduced the growth prospects of Bangladesh, and the pandemic will \nultimately impact the rural poor who are the most vulnerable and the least resilient. Increased \ngovernment spending is necessary to jump-start the economy. Infrastructure spending in rural \nroads improvements will generate local employment, increase access by rural communities to \nhealth services and medical supplies, and enhance the long-term growth prospects of the \neconomy.  \nB.  Project Description \n  The additional financing will increase the current output 1 from 1,700 km to 2,630 km of \nrural roads in 16 districts of the 34 districts covered by the current project, and support LGED to \nproduce a design project report for a possible follow-on loan. The impact and outcome of the \noverall project will remain unchanged from those of the current project.10 \nC.  Value Added by ADB  \n  The  Seventh  Five  Year  Plan  aims  to  expand  the  rural  road  capacity  to  increase \nconnectivity, provide greater access to social services and markets, and promote the agriculture \nsector. The government has embarked on a sustained effort to improve the rural road network, \nusing its own resources and with assistance from international development partners. The overall \nproject will provide a foundation for future investments and post-pandemic recovery in rural areas \nin Bangladesh, including a possible follow-on loan, and a possible ADB-financed project (which \nis in preparation), for which LGED will select subprojects that have benefited from recent \nimprovements  to  the  rural  road  network.11 ADB\u2019s  value  addition  focuses  on  applying  a \ncomprehensive approach to building climate and disaster resilience, and transferring knowledge \nand advanced technologies and practices for asset management. The project builds on the \nsuccess of ADB-supported rural road programs in India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. To enhance \noperational efficiency and reduce the ensuing burden of road maintenance, the project has \nadopted climate-resilient designs, quality control, bioengineering approaches, rigid pavements of \n \nclose on 31 May 2024. The government kept the original loan amount of $300 million in their Development Project \nProposal approved in 2018, anticipating that ADB would process the additional financing of $100 million in 2019. \n5  ADB. 2019.

Summary Due Diligence Results \n  A summary of the due diligence assessments carried out for the proposed additional \nfinancing is presented in Table 3.14 \nTable 3: Summary of Due Diligence Assessments \nArea of   \nAssessment  Summary of Assessment \nTechnical  The designs incorporate key climate-resilient rural road construction measures\u2014i.e., \ndesigned  enhancements  and  bio-engineering  techniques\u2014to  ensure  that  road \nimprovements consider lessons from pilot projects on climate adaptation.  \nEconomic  The updated analysis showed that the economic internal rate of return of the additional \nand financial  financing  is  18.3%,  and  that  of  the  overall  project  is  17.1%,  indicating  they  are \nviability  economically viable. \nSustainability  LGED has a well-established maintenance planning and budget allocation system. Its \nbudget allocation for rural road maintenance has increased by an average of 16% per \nyear since 2013. However, it is unlikely that LGED will fully secure the funds required for \nsustainable maintenance, and there is a risk that upgraded roads may not be safely usable \nfor their entire expected economic life. The draft loan agreement includes assurances that \nthe government will provide the required financing to maintain the upgraded roads. \nGovernance  The updated financial management assessment indicates that the financial management \nrisk is substantial. The financial management arrangements established under the current \nproject, including the staffing arrangement in the project management unit and LGED\u2019s \ndistrict offices, will be followed. A financial management action plan is in the project \nadministration manual.a \nThe procurement of works and recruitment of consultants will be in accordance with the \nADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). The procurement \nclassification is category B. LGED will continue publishing information on their website. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to the government. \nThe policy requirements  and measures are described in the  project administration \nmanual. \nPoverty and  The current project covers 34 districts with 51.5 million inhabitants.b The additional \nsocial  financing will cover 16 of these districts, with 40.2 million inhabitants. The major sources \nof income are agricultural produce, trade and business, services, and overseas workers\u2019 \nremittances. The percentage of the population that is poor ranges from 27% in Cumilla to \n57% in Gopalganj, but the economic shocks resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic will \ndeepen the poverty of those who are already poor. The assessment consulted 3,114 \npeople, who indicated that the additional financing project will increase economic and \nemployment opportunities, through 1.73 million person-days of employment over the \nconstruction and maintenance periods. \nThe project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. The updated poverty and \nsocial analysis included a gender assessment that consulted 753 women.

Gender experts to be hired as part of the current project will ensure the \neffective implementation of the revised gender action plan. \nSafeguards  The additional financing is classified category B for the environment in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The 96 additional rural roads are already in \nexistence, and no bypasses nor land acquisitions are anticipated. They are not located \nwithin any cultural heritage regions, protected areas, buffer zones, or special areas for \nbiodiversity protection. Mitigation measures are integrated into the works through an \nenvironmental management plan in the bidding documents. A social and environmental \ngrievance redress mechanism has been established to receive feedback and complaints \nfrom  affected  parties  and  address  these  during  construction  and  operation.  The \ngovernment\u2019s environmental clearance certificate covers the scope of the overall project. \nThe previously  disclosed  initial environmental  examination report  was updated and \ndisclosed in March 2020. \nThe additional financing is classified category C for involuntary resettlement, as is the \ncurrent project, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The construction \nwill be carried out mostly within existing road corridors and rights-of-way, with minor \nwidening for road safety in some cases, which will require narrow strips of land (less than \n5% of total holdings) to be made available. Similar to the current project, voluntary land \ndonation may be used when land is required. The community participation framework of \nthe current project, which has been disclosed on ADB\u2019s website, will be used. Community \nparticipation  plans  were  prepared.  Assessment  of  institutional  capacities  and \narrangements confirmed that the agencies are capable to effectively implement the \nframework, community consultations, and monitoring. \nThe additional financing is classified category C for indigenous people in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. It will have not impact the culture, human rights, or \nlivelihood systems of indigenous peoples. \nEnvironmental and social safeguards experts will be engaged as part of the current project \nto continue community consultations, redress grievances, and monitor environmental and \nsocial safeguards during the implementation of the project. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, LGED = Local Government Engineering Department. \na  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nb  Government of Bangladesh, Bureau of Statistics. 2019.
