The  project  area  covers \nfour  oblasts \n(provinces)\u2014Chui,  Jalal-Abad,  Osh,  and  Batken.  The  Project  was \ndesigned to provide basic infrastructure services in 730 villages and \nseven  small \nto  about  1.5  million  persons,  of  whom \napproximately 70% were living below the poverty line. \n\ntraining  programs \n\nimproved \n\ntowns \n\nThe proposed supplementary grant is required to meet the financing \ngap  that  has  emerged  due  to  significant  increases  in  construction \ncosts during the implementation period. As a result, the water supply \nsystems  in  118  subprojects  were  prioritized  out  of  the  originally \nplanned  240  subprojects.  The  proposed  supplementary  grant  will \nfinance  the  implementation  of  the  remaining  122  subprojects  by \nproviding  much-needed  water  supply  and  sanitation  services  for  the \nrural  population  as  prioritized  by  the  Government.  Based  on  the \nlessons from the Project, proposed changes include (i) simplification \nof  the  subproject  selection  criteria  to  ensure  the  selection  of \ncommunity-owned, demand-driven, and cost-effective subprojects; (ii) \nimprovement  of  technical  design  criteria  for  implementing  simple, \n(iii) \ntechnically  sound,  and  cost-effective  subprojects;  and \nimprovement  of  implementation  arrangements  to  achieve  efficiency \nand quality during project implementation. \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention\nSector: Water supply, sanitation, and waste management \nSubsector: Water supply and sanitation \nTheme: Inclusive social development \nSubtheme: Human development \n \nCategory B. An initial environmental examination was undertaken. \n\nThe increase in construction costs are attributed to two things. Firstly, \nan unexpected surge in the price of the following commodities\u2014steel, \ncement,  pipes,  and  petroleum  products.  Consequently,  the  average \ninfrastructure \nper  capita  cost  of  construction  of  water  supply \nincreased  from  $20  to  $80  between  the  period  of  the  initial  project \ndesign  and  contract  awards.  Secondly,  climatic  changes  and \ndroughts limited the use of springs and groundwater sources located \nclose  to  villages,  and  thus  the  networks  had  to  be  connected  to \ndistant  water  sources.  Consequently,  the  overall  scale  and  cost  of \n\nClassification \n\nEnvironmental \nAssessment \n\nRationale for \nSupplementary Grant \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nsubprojects increased dramatically. \n\nfrom  many \nin-kind  contributions  solicited \nDespite  cash  and \ncommunities, \nthe  Project  was \nfunding  provided  under \ntotal \ninadequate  to  meet  the  original  target.  Unless  additional  funding  is \nprovided,  many  communities  which  had  high  expectations  of \nbenefiting from the Project will remain without safe water supply and \nsanitation.   \n\nThe proposed supplementary grant will finance the implementation of \nthe  remaining  122  subprojects  and  address  the  critical  water  supply \nand  sanitation  problems  of  about  300,000  people  who  could  not  be \ncovered  under  the  initial  Project.  The  supplementary  grant  will  also \ncover all the identified rectification works and include the procurement \nof  much-needed  operation  and  maintenance  tools  for  sustainable \noperations.  \n\nThe World Bank and Department for International Development of the \nUnited  Kingdom  (DFID)-assisted  Rural  Water  and  Sanitation  Project \nfor the remaining three provinces of the Kyrgyz Republic is scheduled \nfor  completion  by  the  end  of  2008.  That  project  also  experienced \nlarge  price  escalations  and  the  World  Bank  and  DFID  are  jointly \nconsidering additional financing in order to meet the planned benefits \nand impacts. \n\nThe  Project  was  scheduled  to  close  in  December  2006  but,  due  to \nstart-up delays of about 2 years, the loan closing date was extended \nto 31 December 2008. Overall progress of the Project until 2005 had \nbeen slow and, due to weak performance of the project management \nunit  and  the  consultants,  the  quality  of  works  in  some  subprojects \nneeded  improvement.  The  Government  rectified  the  situation  by \nreplacing  the  entire  project  team.  The  new  team  streamlined  the \nproject  implementation  by  working  on  the  rectification  of  previous \nsubprojects,  which  is  currently  ongoing,  and  also  completing  the \nremaining  new  subprojects.  To  further  ensure  the  quality  of  all  the \nsubprojects  in  line  with  the  communities\u2019  requirement,  in  2008  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) conducted an extensive field survey \nof  a  large  number  of  completed  and  ongoing  subprojects  and \nprovided specific solutions to the Government for rectifying all major \nor minor problems. The Project will be completed by the end of 2008. \n\nBased  on  the  lessons  learned,  both  from  ADB  and  the  World  Bank \nand  DFID-assisted  projects,  subproject  selection  criteria  and \nengineering  design  criteria  have  been  improved,  which  will  ensure \nselection  of  strictly  demand-driven  subprojects,  and  use  of  simple, \ntechnically  sound,  and  cost-effective  approaches.  The  improved \nimplementation  arrangements  include  mandatory  steps  to  ensure \ncommunity \nidentification, \nselection,  planning,  design,  and  implementation  of  subprojects.  A \nnew team of technical supervision consultants will finalize the detailed \nengineering design of the subprojects in light of the modified selection \n\ninvolvement  at  all  stages, \n\nincluding \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nand  design  criteria,  and  provide  project  management  and \nimplementation support. In addition to safe drinking water supply, the \nsupplementary  grant  will  (i)  focus  on  rural  sanitation,  (ii)  expand  the \nhygiene  education  program,  and  (iii)  ensure  intensive  training  of \nfinancial  management  and \ncommunity  organizations  on  sound \noperation and maintenance practices is undertaken. \n\nThe  revised  cost  for  the  Project,  including  the cost  of  the  initial loan \n($36 million), the proposed supplementary grant ($30 million), and the \ntotal counterpart sharing ($16.5 million), is estimated at $82.5 million \nincluding  taxes  and  duties,  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and \nfinancing charges during implementation.  \n\nRevised Investment \nPlan \n\nRevised Financing \nPlan \n\nUnder  the  revised  financing  arrangements,  the  total  ADB  financing \nwill  cover  80%  of  the  investment  costs.  The  Government  and \ncommunities will jointly finance 20% of the project cost. \n\nSupplementary Grant \nAmount and Terms \n\nADB  will  provide  a  grant  of  $30 million  from  its  Special  Funds \nresources.  Based  on  debt  sustainability  analysis  and  the  revised \nAsian  Development  Fund  grants  framework,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  is \neligible for 100% grant financing during 2007\u20132008. \n\nProject Completion \nDate \n\n31 December 2012 \n\nUtilization Date \n\n30 June 2013 \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nimplementation  arrangements  have  been  modified \n\nto \nExisting \nimprove project implementation by shifting the responsibility from the \nMinistry  of  Agriculture, Water  Resources  and  Processing  Industry  to \nthe Department of Rural Water Supply (DRWS), which will now serve \nas  the  executing  agency.  The  existing  project  management  unit \n(PMU)  at  DRWS  will  continue  to  provide  overall  coordination.  The \nNational  Agency \nthe  project \nimplementation  units  already  established  at  oblast  level  will  jointly \nimplement the activities under the supplementary grant.  \n\nfor  Local  Self-Government  and \n\nThe  supplementary  grant  is  expected  to  benefit  about  200  villages \nwith an estimated population of about 300,000 people. It will finance \nimprovements to living standards, the environment, and public health. \nRelated  benefits  include  time  and  cost  savings  from  purchasing, \nfetching,  treating,  and  storing  water;  improved  hygiene  and  health; \nreduced  medical  outlays;  and  increased  productive  days.  It  will  also \nsupport  improvements  in  operational  efficiency  of  the  community-\nbased organizations. \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\nFour  possible  project  risks  have  been  identified:  (i)  turnover  of \nexisting  staff  of  the  PMU  can  adversely  affect  the  quality  and \nefficiency of work and thus delay the project implementation, (ii) poor \nselection  of contractors at  any  time  during  the  implementation  could \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nhamper  the  project  quality  and  consequently  community  members \nmight withdraw from their commitment to take over the operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) of the subprojects, (iii) selected sources of water \nsupply  might  turn  out  to  be  unsustainable,  and  (iv)  the  Project  may \nbecome  unsustainable  if  tariffs  are  not  periodically  increased.  The \nProject includes the following measures to mitigate these risks.   \n\nto  qualify  only \n\nThe  Government  shall  endeavor  that  no  staff  transfers  take  place \nduring  the  project  implementation  and  the  PMU  and  PIUs  capacity \nwill  be  further  strengthened  as  per  agreed  staffing  strength.  To \nensure  the  selection  of  qualified  contractors,  the  performance  of \nexisting  contractors  will  be  reevaluated \nthose \ncontractors  who  have  performed  well  during  the  initial  project \nimplementation. Further, a more stringent criterion will be applied for \nthe  prequalification  of  new  contractors.  For \nthe  selection  of \nsustainable  water  sources,  improved  guidelines  for  undertaking \ncomprehensive investigations have been agreed that will ensure the \ndesired  water  yield \nthe  selected  water  supply  sources. \nInvolvement  of  communities  in  the  identification  and  selection  of \nsources  and  the  overall  implementation  will  ensure  their  ownership \nand  minimize  the  risk  of  subprojects  being  unsustainable.  The \nGovernment  has  also  assured \nthe  ayil  okmotus  (village \nadministrations)  as  mandated  by  law,  will  ensure  the  community \ndrinking  water  users\u2019  unions  (CDWUUs)  revise  tariffs  periodically  to \nmeet  operation  and  maintenance  costs  of  subprojects.  Where \nrequired,  the  ayil  okmotu  will  provide  financial  support  to  CDWUUs \nand  ensure  that  service  is  efficiently  delivered  and  the  system  does \nnot experience breakdown. \n\nfrom \n\nthat \n\n\f \n\nKyrgyz Republic Map \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nsupplementary  grant  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  for  the  Community-Based  Infrastructure  Services \nSector Project. \n\nII. \n\nTHE APPROVED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Rationale \n\nPrior  to  1991,  the  Soviet  Union  provided  sufficient  subsidies  to  construct,  rehabilitate, \n2. \nand maintain infrastructure services throughout the country. While preparing the Project, it was \nrecognized that the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic does not have the financial capability to \nprovide  the  necessary  funds,  nor  the  institutional  arrangements  to  make  the  best  use  of \navailable limited resources; infrastructure in both urban and rural areas had deteriorated. \n\n3. \nRural water supply had been particularly badly affected. Formerly, an estimated 70% of \nrural villages had a clean, healthy piped water supply. This coverage officially dropped to 60% \nduring the preparation of the Project. The southern poor oblasts (provinces) of Jalal-Abad and \nOsh were badly affected, and only about 25% of the villages had reliable water supply. Statistics \non morbidity and mortality in the Kyrgyz Republic indicated that, while the mortality rate declined \nsomewhat  because  of  improvements  in  basic  health  services,  the  morbidity  rate  continued  to \nincrease. Diarrheal diseases strongly associated with unsafe water supply and poor sanitation \nand hygiene were among the leading causes of morbidity, with an incidence rate of about 425 \nper 100,000 people in 1998. Similarly, cases of typhoid increased each year since 1995, and in \n1998  an  outbreak  in  Osh  and  around  Bishkek  due  to  polluted  water  sources  resulted  in  an \nalmost fourfold increase over 1997. \n\n4. \nThe lack of adequate water supply and sanitation services has a large negative impact \non  the  social  economy  of  the  country,  and  especially  on  the  poor.  There  exists  a  direct  link \nbetween the deterioration of these services and the increase of waterborne and excreta-related \ndiseases during the 1990s. Having to cope with poor and unsafe water and sanitation services \nresults  in  large  financial  and  social  costs  for  the  poor  population.  Some  can  afford  to  spend \nresources  on  alternative  methods  to  provide  a  centralized  water  supply,  but  in  rural  areas \npeople  often  walk  long  distances  only  to  obtain  contaminated  water  from  untreated  sources. \nMany  villages  contain  banyas  (communal  bathhouses),  which  have  now  largely  fallen  into \ndisuse due to lack of water supply. One of the results is an increase in skin complaints caused \nby  lack  of  proper  cleanliness.  There  is  no  wastewater  collection  system  in  rural  areas  or  an \nacceptable  level  of  human  waste  disposal.  Improving  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  sector\u2019s \nperformance is an integral part of the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy. \n\nThe  Community-Based  Infrastructure  Services  Sector  Project  (the  Project)1  follows  a \n5. \nsector lending approach and supports the Government\u2019s objectives of decentralization, poverty \nreduction, and human development.  \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB,  2000.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  and \nTechnical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  for  the  Community-Based  Infrastructure  Services  Sector \nProject. Manila.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n7. \nbuilding: \n\n(i) \n\n6. \nThe  main  objective  of  the  Project  was  to  improve  the  living  and  health  conditions  in \nselected rural and urban communities, in particular for the poor, through the provision of basic \ninfrastructure services. The Project aimed to achieve its objective by (i) assisting the central and \nlocal  governments  in  delivering  infrastructure  services;  (ii)  supporting  sanitation  and  hygiene \neducation;  (iii) improving  the  technical  and  financial  capacity  of  local  governments  in  the \nplanning, implementation, and operation and maintenance (O&M) of facilities; and (iv) promoting \nownership and community management of both rural and urban community-based infrastructure \nservices.  The  project  impact  and  outcome  was  to  improve  public  health  and  environment  in \nproject  villages  and  focus  on  (i)  increasing  safe  water  coverage  from  the  existing  32%  of  the \npopulation  to  100%,  and  (ii)  reducing  the  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases  from  30%  of  the \npopulation to 5% over the project period. \n\nThe  Project  included  two  parts:  part  A,  physical  infrastructure;  and  part  B,  capacity \n\nPart A included about 240 subprojects in about 730 villages, and 7 subprojects in \n7  towns.  The  rural  subprojects  were  to  cover  the  rehabilitation  and  upgrade  of \npiped  drinking  water  supply  systems,  the  establishment  and  upgrade  of \nsanitation facilities and flood control and drainage facilities, and the rehabilitation \nof  local  roads  in  conjunction  with  investments  in  water  supply.  The  urban \nsubprojects  were  to  cover  rehabilitation  and  extension  of  piped  water  supply \nservices,  and  improved  sewerage  systems  including  wastewater  collection  and \ntreatment. \n\n(ii) \n\nPart  B  included  an  institutional  development  program,  a  hygiene  and  sanitation \neducation program, and consulting services for project management support.  \n\nC. \n\nInitial Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nThe total cost of the Project was estimated at $45 million equivalent, including taxes and \n8. \nduties, as well as physical and price contingencies. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan \napproved  for  the  Project  was  $36.0  million  equivalent  to  finance  80%  of  the  total  project  cost. \nThe  balance  of  $9.0  million  equivalent,  or  about  20%  of  the  total  cost,  was  financed  by  the \nbeneficiary  communities  ($3.0  million),  the  oblast  and  rayon  (district)  administrations  ($0.5 \nmillion),  and  the  central  Government  ($5.5  million).  Government  financing  covered  local \nexpenditures  including  taxes  and  duties.  The  foreign  exchange  risk  was  borne  by  the \nGovernment. The loan was provided from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources and had the following \nterms:  an  amortization period  of  32  years  including  a  grace  period  of 8  years,  and  an  interest \ncharge of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. A summary of \nthe cost estimates is provided in Table 1 and the financing plan is in Table 2. \n\n\f3 \n\n53 \n6 \n2 \n2 \n13 \n11 \n86 \n\n2 \n1 \n\n6 \n\n9 \n4 \n100 \n\n80 \n80 \n \n12 \n1 \n\n7 \n20 \n100 \n\nTable 1: Summary of Initial Project Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nForeign \nCurrency \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \nCost \n\nShare of Total \n(%) \n\nItem \n\nA.

The  other  subcomponents\u2014such  as  flood  control  and  drainage  facilities,  local \nroads,  and  urban  subprojects\u2014were  not  undertaken  as  originally  planned;  the  Government \nallocated separate funds for these.  \n\n10. \nThe  Project  was  scheduled  to  close  in  December  2006  but,  due  to  start-up  delays  of \nabout 2 years, the loan closing date was extended to 31 December 2008. Overall progress of \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nthe Project up until 2005 was slow and, due to lack of performance of the project management \nunit (PMU) and the consultants, the quality of works in some subprojects needed improvement. \nThe  Government  rectified  the  situation  by  taking  drastic  action  and  replaced  the  entire  project \nteam.  The  new  team  streamlined  the  project  implementation  by  working  on  the  rectification  of \nprevious  subprojects,  which  is  currently  ongoing,  and  also  completing  the  remaining  new \nsubprojects.  The  new  team,  through  the  project  performance  monitoring  system,  monitors  the \nperformance of community drinking water users\u2019 unions (CDWUUs) at the subproject level and \ndevelops commensurate mitigation plans based on a biannual review addressing inter alia tariff \ncollection, subproject system operations, and sustainability.  \n\n11.  With  regard  to  developing  the  capacity  of  the  CDWUUs,  the  PMU  through  the  four \nproject implementation units (PIUs) at the oblast level, undertook a structured program of social \nmobilization  to  ensure  that  the  CDWUUs  adequately  manage  the  assets  created  through  the \nProject.  Problems  noted  on  several  post-2005  subprojects,  such  as  inadequate  training  for \nCDWUUs  in  preventive  maintenance  and  financial  management  and  lack  of  coordination  with \nthe ayil okmotus, (village administrations)2 were the main institutional challenges when the new \nPMU  team  assumed  the  charge.  The  social  mobilization,  CDWUU  training  on  asset \nmaintenance, and the hygiene and sanitation education program, were coordinated by the PMU \nthrough  two  coordinators  and  two  specialists  for  institutional  development  and  hygiene  and \nsanitation education. At each PIU, five staff members were responsible for CDWUU training and \ninstitutional development for long-term service sustainability. Based on the successful outcome, \nthe  PMU  is  now  conducting  exchange  programs  between  CDWUUs  to  improve  the  working \nknowledge  of  CDWUU  members  to  provide  efficient  services.  Building  on  these  lessons,  the \nPMU and PIUs will continue developing the capacity of CDWUUs and the local self-government.   \n\n12. \nTo  ensure  the  quality  of  all  the  subprojects  was  in  line  with  the  communities\u2019 \nrequirements, in 2008 ADB conducted an extensive field survey of a large number of completed \nand  ongoing  subprojects  and  provided  detailed  specific  solutions  to  the  Government  for \nrectifying  all  the  identified  problems.  The  action  plan  of  rectification  works  is  detailed  in \nSupplementary Appendix C. The initial Project will be completed by the end of 2008.  \n\n13. \nA detailed review of the completed and ongoing subprojects, and consultations with the \nbeneficiaries, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), various agencies of the Government, and \nthe PMU revealed several lessons. This warrants improvement in the subproject selection and \ntechnical  design  criteria,  and  overall  implementation  arrangements.  The  following  are  the  key \nlessons learned: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nFormation  of  the  community-based  organization,  and  community  mobilization \nwith  intensive  awareness  generation  on  the  subproject  selection  criteria  and \npost-implementation  requirements,  should  be  carried  out  before  selection  of \nsubprojects and commencement of designs. \n\nIn-kind  community  contribution  of  15%  of  the  subproject  cost,  where  the \ncommunity had to provide labor to contractors, was found to be unworkable, and \nthis  caused  considerable  implementation  delays,  conflict  with  contractors,  and \neventually poor quality of construction. Therefore, it should be excluded from the \nsubproject selection criteria.  \n\n                                                 \n2 Ayil okmotu \u2013 a village administration consisting of several (usually from 3 to 8) villages and settlements. The body, \nunder the overall control of National Local Self Government Agency, is responsible for promotion of economic and \nsocial development (including water supply and sanitation) on a related territory.  \n\n\f(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n5 \n\nA cash contribution of 5% of the subproject cost was found generally acceptable \nby communities, subject to a ceiling to be determined based on the communities\u2019 \nability to pay. In some cases, due to the high cost of a subproject, this 5% share \nbecame  unaffordable  and  eventually  communities  had  to  omit  some  very \nimportant components, such as rehabilitation of main pipelines. Such omissions \nin  certain  subprojects  led  to  continued  leakages  from  installed  pipes,  causing \nwater  shortages,  public  unrest,  lack  of  tariff  collection,  and  eventually  led  to  an \nunsustainable  service.  Therefore,  an  affordability  analysis  is  mandatory  for \nelaborate and costly subprojects. \n\nTo ensure successful community-based operations, it is essential that the size of \na subproject should be compatible with the community's management capacities. \nSome subprojects were planned and implemented by including a large number of \nvillages  with  a  total  population  of  more  than  30,000,  where  the  geographic \nspread  was  over  80  kilometers.  Communities  in  such  villages  are  struggling  to \nproperly maintain and operate the system.  \n\nNone of the communities were provided with maintenance equipment. Therefore, \nthe  CDWUUs  had  to  rely  on  rented  equipment,  which  in  many  cases  was \nunaffordable.  The  majority  of  the  communities  expressed  their  willingness  to \nprocure  such  equipment  on  installments  and  requested  the  Project  to  facilitate \nthe  creation  of  a  revolving  fund.  Under  this  fund,  O&M  equipment  would  be \nprocured  for  a  group  of  close  CDWUUs  which  could  jointly  repay  the  cost  in \ninstallments. \n\nStand-alone  water  supply  subprojects  without  sanitation  caused  serious \nenvironmental  problems  and  created  health  hazards.  No  subproject  should  be \nimplemented  without  adequate  disposal  and  treatment  of  sewage.  Simplified, \ncost-effective  waste  disposal  and  treatment  techniques  should  be  adopted  for \nrural areas. \n\n(vii)  CDWUUs\u2019  training  in  O&M  of  the  infrastructure  with  user-friendly  operation \nmanuals  in  the  local  language  is  essential  to  ensure  sustainable  operations  by \nCDWUUs.  \n\n(viii)  To ensure sustainability of subprojects, involvement of the ayil okmotus from the \nstage  of  identification  to  post-implementation  should  be  made  mandatory  for \nback-up support to CDWUUs in (a) facilitating efficient tariff collection, particularly \nfrom  nonpayers;  (b)  helping  in  case  of  major  breakdown  of  machinery;  and  (c) \nresolving social conflict within CDWUU members or the community. Similarly, the \nrole of oblast rural water department officials is important for providing technical \nguidance to CDWUUs.   \n\nCDWUUs are subject to various taxes usually applicable to commercial entities, \nwhich  are  major  risks  affecting  the  financial  sustainability  of  subprojects.  To \nensure  sustainable  community-based  operations,  the  tax  structure  needs  to  be \nreviewed so that it reflects that the CDWUUs are performing a public service on \nbehalf of the ayil okmotu and are not commercial enterprises. \n\nSeveral  communities  demanded  water  meters  due  to  misuse  of  drinking  water \nfacilities  for  irrigation  by  some  individual  households,  which  adds  to  water \nexpenditure,  particularly  on  pumping.  Further,  uncontrolled  use  of  water  has \nbeen  shown  to  cause  environmental  problems.  Several  CDWUUs  expressed \n\n\f6 \n\ntheir  willingness  to  pay  for  meters  if  the  Project  facilitates  procurement  and \nrecovers the cost through installments.  \n\n(xi) \n\nOutdated Soviet design criteria must immediately be replaced with the improved \ntechnically  sound,  and  cost-effective \nguidelines \ntechnologies are adopted.  \n\nthat  simple, \n\nto  ensure \n\n(xii)  Community exchange visits on successful subprojects and dissemination of good \nlessons  of  the  regional  projects  should  be  promoted  to  motivate  project \ncommunities to follow good practices. \n\nIII.  \n\nTHE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY GRANT \n\nA. \n\nProposed Changes and Impacts on the Project \n\n14. \nThe  proposed  supplementary  grant  is  required  to  meet  the  cost  overruns  due  to \nsignificant increases in construction costs during the implementation period, and the change in \nscope of the Project as set out below: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nService  coverage.  Physical  infrastructure  financed  under  the  supplementary \ngrant  will  be  limited  to  meeting  the  desperately  needed  water  supply  and \nsanitation services for the rural population as prioritized by the Government. The \nother subcomponents\u2014such as flood control and drainage facilities, local roads, \nand  urban  subprojects\u2014will  be  excluded  from  the  original  scope,  and  for  which \nthe Government has allocated separate funds. Based on the improved selection \ncriteria,  which  excludes  unsustainable  costly  subprojects,  it  is  envisioned  that \n122 subprojects in about 200 villages with a total population of about 300,000 will \nbe  covered  by  the  supplementary  grant.  Sanitation  will  be  the  integral  part  of \neach  subproject.  The  World  Bank  and  the  Department  for  International \nDevelopment of the United Kingdom (DFID) also plan to expand their assistance \nto  the  project  oblasts  for  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  services  in  uncovered \nareas  following  the  same  selection  criteria.  For  the  villages  not  meeting  the \nselection  criteria,  the  Government  will  make  separate  arrangements  through  its \nown resources.  \n\nSubproject  selection  and  technical  design  criteria.  Based  on  lessons  from \nongoing  and  completed  projects,  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  and  DFID  have  jointly \nimproved  the  criteria  for  subproject  selection  and  technical  design,  which  have \nbeen approved by the Government. Improvements in subproject selection criteria \ninclude:  (a)  excluding  the  unworkable  in-kind  community  contribution  of  15%  of \nthe  total  subproject  cost;  (b)  ensuring  the  up-front  collection  of  5%  cash \ncontribution  from  communities  before  the  award  of  contract;  (c)  ensuring  the \nsigning  of  a  memorandum  of  understanding  (MOU)  by  CDWUUs,  ayil  okmotu, \nand  the  Department  of  Rural  Water  Supply  (DRWS)  regarding  the  agreements \non  the  role  and  responsibilities  of  all  parties  during  identification,  preparation, \nimplementation,  and  post-implementation  stages  of  subprojects;  (d)  ensuring \ncompliance  with  the  resettlement  framework  for  voluntary  land  donations  for \ncommunity  development  works;  and  (e) setting  the  limits  for  per  capita  capital \ncost  of  the  pump-based  and  gravity-based  subprojects  to  control  selection  of \nhigh-cost subprojects. The outdated technical design criteria has been replaced \n\n\f7 \n\n(iii) \n\nwith  improved  guidelines  to  ensure  that  simple,  technically  sound,  and  cost-\neffective technologies are adopted. \n\nImplementation  arrangements.  Existing  implementation  arrangements  will  be \nmodified  to  improve  project  implementation,  by  shifting  responsibility  from  the \nMinistry  of  Agriculture,  Water  Resources  and  Processing  Industry  to  DRWS, \nwhich  will  serve  as  the  executing  agency  (EA).  In  line  with  the  country\u2019s \nlegislative and regulatory framework, ayil okmotu\u2019s involvement has been made \nmandatory from the stage of identification to post-implementation to ensure long-\nterm  sustainability  of  the  community-based  service  provisions.  With  such \narrangement, ayil okmotu will continue to provide back-up support to CDWUUs in \nfacilitating  efficient  tariff  collection,  disconnecting  connections  of  nonpayers, \nhelping  in  case  of  major  machinery  breakdown,  and  resolving  social  conflict \nwithin  CDWUU  members  or  the  community.  DRWS  will  involve  its  oblast  rural \nwater  supply  professionals  for  providing  technical  guidance  to  CDWUUs.  To \nensure  third-party  quality  assurance  during  the  project  implementation  and  also \nprovide  project  management  and  administration  support  to  the  PMU,  a  team  of \ntechnical  supervision  consultants  will  be  appointed.  These  consultants,  in  close \ncoordination  with  CDWUUs,  will  prepare  and  disseminate  monthly  progress \nreports  for  transparency  and  good  governance.  With  the  help  of  consultants, \ninstitutional  capacities  will  be  developed  for  DRWS,  the  ayil  okmotus,  and \nCDWUUs.  For  CDWUUs,  particular  focus  will  be  in  the  areas  of  operation  and \nmaintenance  of  water  supply  and  sanitation  systems;  financial  management \nincluding  budgeting,  accounting,  billing  and  collection,  and  hygiene  and \nsanitation education. \n\n15. \n\nThe revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n\nB. \n\nRationale \n\n16. \nThe  proposed  activities  and  components  under  the  supplementary  grant  (i)  are \nconsistent with the priorities of the Government and ADB; (ii) comply with the requirements for \nassessment  of  impact  due  to  physical  changes  in  the  context  of  current  ADB  policies;  (iii)  are \ntechnically  feasible,  economically  viable,  and  financially  sustainable;  and  (iv)  comply  with  the \nrequirements of ADB safeguards policies.  \n\nThe increases in construction costs are attributed to (i) an unexpected surge in the price \n17. \nof  steel,  cement,  pipes,  and  petroleum  products;  and  (ii) limitations  of  water  sources  located \nclose  to  the  villages  and  communities.  An  assessment  of  the  summary  price  indices  (an \nindicator of construction commodity prices) in the country for 2000\u20132008 indicated a 120% price \nincrease.  Further,  an  assessment  of  quoted  prices  of  specific  commodities  such  as  steel  and \nasbestos  cement  pipes  indicate  a  240%  variation  for  2002\u20132007.  Consequently,  the  average \nper capita cost of construction of water supply infrastructure increased from $20 to $80 between \nthe  period  of  the  initial  project  design  and  contract  award.  The  net  effect  was  that,  during  the \nimplementation period, the water supply systems in 118 subprojects were prioritized out of the \noriginally  planned  240  subprojects.  The  other  subcomponents\u2014such  as  flood  control  and \ndrainage  facilities,  local  roads,  and  urban  subprojects\u2014were  not  undertaken  as  originally \nplanned, and for which the Government has allocated separate funds. Appendix 2 summarizes \nthe key outcomes of the cost overrun analysis. Climatic changes and droughts limited the use of \nsprings  and  groundwater  sources  located  close  to  villages,  and  thus  the  networks  had  to  be \nconnected  to  more  distant  water  sources.  Consequently,  the  overall  scale  and  cost  of \n\n\f8 \n\nsubprojects increased dramatically. Despite cash and in-kind contributions solicited from many \ncommunities,  total  funding  provided  under  the  Project  was  inadequate  to  meet  the  original \ntargets. Unless additional funding is provided, many communities which had high expectations \nof benefiting from the Project will remain without safe water supply and sanitation.  \n\nThe  World  Bank  and  DFID-assisted  project3  for  the  remaining  three  provinces  of  the \n18. \nKyrgyz Republic is scheduled for completion by the end of 2008. That project also experienced \nprice escalations and the World Bank and DFID are jointly considering additional financing for \nmeeting the planned benefits and impacts. \n\n19. \nThe proposed supplementary grant will finance the implementation of the remaining 122 \nsubprojects,  providing  much-needed  water  supply  and  sanitation  services  for  about  300,000 \npeople in 200 villages who could not be covered under the Project. The supplementary grant will \nalso  cover  all  the  identified  rectification  works  and  include  the  procurement  of  much-needed \nO&M tools for sustainable operations. \n\nto \n\nfinancing  provision  of \n\nthe  uncovered  population.  By \n\n20. \nSocial  analysis  and  the  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  derived  for  the \nsupplementary  grant  (Appendix  3)  indicate  the  need  for  providing  water  supply  and  sanitation \nservices \nthe \nsupplementary  grant  will  contribute  to  improvements  in  health  and  provide  an  opportunity  to \nstrengthen the role of women in the community. It will also lessen the burden on women as the \nmain collectors of water. Based on lessons from both ADB and World Bank and DFID-assisted \nprojects, the improved subproject selection and technical design criteria will ensure selection of \nstrictly  demand-driven  subprojects,  and  use  of  simple,  technically  sound,  and  cost-effective \napproaches. Through the improved implementation arrangements and a robust consultative and \nparticipation plan, the Project will include mandatory steps to ensure community involvement at \nall  stages, \nimplementation  of \nsubprojects.  In  addition  to  safe  drinking  water  supply,  the  Project  will  (i)  focus  on  rural \nsanitation,  (ii)  expand  the  hygiene  education  program,  and  (iii)  ensure  intensive  training  of \ncommunity organizations on sound financial management and O&M practices is undertaken.  \n\nidentification,  selection,  planning,  design,  and \n\nthese  services, \n\nincluding \n\nC. \n\nSafeguards \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental \n\nThe Project is expected to have a significant positive impact on the improvement of the \n21. \nenvironment.  Based  on  the  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  prepared  for  the  initial \nproject, mitigation and monitoring measures are being taken. This IEE including environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) will continue to be the basis for the implementation of environmental \nmitigation and monitoring measures. Since the project scope and design will not change, a new  \nenvironmental  assessment  is  unnecessary.  The  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework to guide the implementation of subprojects under the supplementary grant is detailed \nin Appendix 4 and takes into account project experience and lessons learned under the Project. \nThe environmental assessment and review framework also ensures updating the IEEs and the \nEMPs  for  the  Project,  considering  modified  activities  to  reflect  mitigation  measures  for \nsubprojects  covered  under  the  supplementary  grant.  To  ensure  and  further  improve  project \nenvironmental management the EA and the PMU will: (i) engage an environmental expert at the \n\n                                                 \n3 World Bank. 2001.

Washington, DC. \n \n\n\f9 \n\nPMU  to  oversee  and  approve  IEEs  prepared  by  the  PIUs  (with  assistance  from  the  technical \ndesign  consultant);  (ii)  develop  a  groundwater  quality  testing  program  to  monitor  groundwater \nquality at treated sewage discharge points; and (iii) train the PIUs and contractors in the use of \noccupational  health  and  safety  and  environmental  monitoring  checklists.  The  EMPs  will  be \nincluded in the civil works contracts.     \n\n2. \n\nResettlement \n\nSmall-scale water  supply  and  sanitation  subprojects financed  under  the  supplementary \n22. \ngrant  will  consist  primarily  of  a  network  of  underground  pipelines,  water  intake,  storage \nreservoirs, and wastewater disposal. By their very nature these works will be constructed in the \npublic  rights-of-way.  However,  land  will  be  required  in  small  parcels  for  the  purposes  of  water \nsource  development,  overhead  reservoirs,  water  transmission  lines,  and  wastewater  disposal \nworks. It is expected that communities or individuals will volunteer their land (such as unutilized \ncommunity-owned  land)  for  these  small  facilities  that  benefit  them  directly.  Therefore,  no \nresettlement will be required, and this was also confirmed during the special loan review mission \nin  May  2008  through  a  study  of  45  selected  subprojects.  Any  voluntary  land  donation  will  be \ncarried out in accordance with the resettlement framework for community development works as \nset out in Appendix 5. In case of any grievance, the Government has agreed that the grievance \nredress mechanism in the resettlement framework will apply.  \n\n3. \n\nIndigenous People \n\n23. \n Subprojects under the Project have not encountered any issues relating to indigenous \npeople.  Further  research  and  extensive  field  visits  conducted  during  the  processing  of  the \nsupplementary grant confirmed that all people living in the project areas are ethnic Kyrgyz, so \nthere are no indigenous people issues.  \n\nD. \n\nAsian Development Fund IX Grant  \n\n24. \nBased  on  the  debt  sustainability  analysis  and  the  revised  Asian  Development  Fund \n(ADF)  grants  framework,4  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  eligible  for  100%  grant  financing  and  is \nclassified  under  the  high-risk  category  of  debt  distress.  The  ADF  IX  grant  program  aims  to \nprovide development assistance to help countries tackle development issues in an environment \nof  debt  vulnerability,  and  assist  countries  to  develop  the  private  sector,  create  employment \nopportunities,  and  achieve  sustainable  economic  growth,  without  increasing  external  debt \nburdens.  The  grant  effectiveness  will  be  assessed  within  the  broader  context  of  the  project \nperformance. The project design and monitoring framework has clear indicators to measure the \ninputs, activities, and outputs (Appendix 1). \n\nE. \n\nRevised Cost Estimates  \n\n25. \nRevised  cost  for  the  Project,  including  the  cost  of  the  initial  loan  ($36  million),  the \nproposed  grant  ($30  million),  and  the  total  counterpart  sharing  ($16.5  million),  is  estimated  at \n$82.5  million  including  taxes  and  duties,  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  financing \ncharges during implementation.

With  the \nsupplementary grant of $30 million, the total available loan and grant amount will be $66 million. \nUnder the revised financing arrangements, the total ADB funding will cover 80% ($66 million) of \nthe  total  investment  cost  of  $82.5 million.  The  proposed  supplementary  grant  will  also  cover \n80%  ($30  million)  of  the  additional  financing  requirement  of  $37.5  million,  which will  finance a \nportion  of  the  civil  works,  equipment,  capacity  building,  and  project  management  and \nadministration  costs.  Counterpart  funds  from  the  Government  will  account  for  16.4%  ($6.15 \nmillion)  of  the  additional  financing  requirement,  which  will  include  incremental  administration, \nfinancing  charges,  taxes  and  duties,  land,  and  a  portion  of  civil  works,  equipment,  and \nconsulting services costs. The communities will contribute 3.6% ($1.35 million) of the additional \nfinancing  towards  civil  works  and  equipment,  which  is  5%  of  the  capital  expenditure  on  water \nsupply and sanitation works of new subprojects, i.e., excluding the rectification works.

The  underlying  legal,  regulatory,  and  service \nsustainability  frameworks  are  in  Appendix  7.  Financial  management  assessment  of  DRWS \n(Supplementary Appendix A) confirmed its capacity to implement and manage the Project. The \nexisting  PMU  at  DRWS  will  continue  to  provide  overall  coordination.  The  National  Agency  of \nLocal  Self-Government  (NALSG)  and  the  PIUs  already  established  at  oblast  level  will  jointly \nimplement the Project. The PMU and the PIUs will ensure asset creation and capacity building \nof  the  CDWUUs  in  asset  management  and  strengthening.  NALSG  will  ensure  ayil  okmotu \nparticipation  in  the  project  cycle  and  commitment  to  meet  WSS  service  delivery  obligations. \nWith the help of the PMU, NALSG will elicit ayil okmotu and CDWUU participation through the \ncommunity  awareness  and  participation  program,  hygiene  and  sanitation  education  program, \nand  asset  management  and  strengthening  program.  A  project  coordination  committee\u2014\ncomprising representatives from DRWS, NALSG, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Health, \nand  the  Ministry  of  Economic  Development  and  Trade\u2014will  meet  at  6-monthly  intervals  (or \nearlier if needed) to oversee project implementation and provide decision-making support on all \naspects of the Project. Appendix 8 provides the project implementation arrangements. \n\n28. \nThe  current  PMU  will  continue  to  manage  and  administer  the  Project  with  structural \nchanges  to  facilitate  efficient  project  management.  A  project  director  will  head  the  PMU  and \nthree  specialists\u2014one  each  for  technical  and  engineering,  institutional  development,  and \nfinancial  management\u2014will  support  the  project  director.  The  PMU  will  recruit  four  additional \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  specialists,  an  environment  specialist,  and  a  translator  and/or \ninterpreter. Four PIUs situated in each of the four oblasts will oversee project implementation in \nthe  villages.  Supplementary  Appendix  D  provides  a  schematic  representation  of  the  PMU  and \nPIU composition. \n\n\f12 \n\n2. \n\nRevised Implementation Period \n\n29. \nThe revised project completion date is 31 December 2012 and the grant closing date is \n30  June  2013.  An  implementation  period  of  4  years  is  estimated  due  to  the  scale  and  wide \nspread  of  subprojects  in  the  four  oblasts.  A  revised  implementation  schedule  is  included  in \nAppendix 9.  \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n30. \nAll  procurement  financed  under  the  supplementary  grant  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nContracts for civil works that are estimated to cost more than $1 million equivalent will be issued \nusing  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Contracts  for  civil  works  estimated  to  cost \n$1 million equivalent or less will be carried out through national competitive bidding procedures \nacceptable to ADB, and as set out in the procurement plan. To the extent possible, procurement \nof  goods  will  be  grouped  into  packages  larger  than  $500,000  to  be  suitable  for  international \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures.  Miscellaneous  goods  that  cannot  be  grouped  into  larger \ncontracts, and are estimated to cost less than $500,000 per contract, will be procured through \nnational  competitive  bidding.  Minor  items  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $100,000  equivalent  per \ncontract may be purchased through shopping. Appendix 10 provides the procurement plan for \nthe  Project.  Bid  documents  under  the  supplementary  grant  will  follow  ADB  standard  bidding \ndocuments. The procurement plan will be updated at least annually covering the next 18 months \nof procurement activity. \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nSixty  eight  person-months  of  international  and  1,080  person-months  of  national \n31. \n(package  A)  consulting  services  will  be  provided  for  technical  supervision  consultancy  to \nsupport  the  PMU  on  (i)  third-party  quality  assurance;  (ii)  innovative  technology  support;  (iii) \noversight  of  subproject  construction  management  and  supervision;  (iv)  information,  education, \nand  communication  support;  and  (v)  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Consulting  services  of  840 \nperson-months  (package  B)  will  be  provided  for  technical  design  consultancy  to  support  the \nPIUs\u2014one  team  located  at  Chui  for  Chui  oblast  and  one  team  located  at  Osh  for  Osh,  Jalal-\nAbad, and Batken oblasts. The technical design consultancy will be responsible for conducting \nfeasibility  studies,  preparing  detailed  designs  and  drawings,  and  providing  bid  process \nmanagement  support.  The  technical  design  consultancy  will  be  supported  by  a  national \nconsulting firm or NGO (324 person-months) on community mobilization, hygiene and sanitation \neducation, and information, education, and communication addressing the long-term institutional \nand  financial  sustainability  of  the  WSS  service.  All  consulting  services  will  be  selected  and \nengaged  in accordance with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  Package  A  and  B  consultants  will  be  hired  as  a  firm  based  on  the  quality- \nand cost-based selection method. International consultants (68 person-months) under package \nA  may  be  hired  as  individual  or  as  part  of  the  firm.  Provisions  for  consulting  services  are \nsummarized  in  the  procurement  plan  (Appendix  10)  and  the  terms  of  reference  for  the  three \nconsultancy assignments are detailed in Supplementary Appendix E. \n\n\f13 \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Procurement Action \n\n32. \nADB has approved the use of advance action to recruit consultants. The advance action \nwill entail issuance of expressions of interest and request for proposals. The advance action is \nnecessary  to  sustain  the  ongoing  Project  and  continue  with  its  smooth  implementation.  The \nGovernment  has  been  advised  that  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  advance  procurement  action  does  not \nconstitute a commitment to finance the Project. \n\n6. \n\nSubproject Selection \n\nimpacts;  (v) \n\n33. \nEach  subproject  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with  the  criteria  agreed  with  the \nGovernment (Appendix 11): (i) the subproject is primarily located in an area where there is an \nacute shortage of water or the existing system of water supply and sanitation is dilapidated and \nrequires  major  rehabilitation  or  replacement;  (ii)  the  community  does  not  currently  have  an \norganized  water  supply  system;  (iii)  the  beneficiary  community  is  willing  to  form  a  CDWUU  to \nundertake  O&M  of  the  subproject  and  to  share  its  capital  cost  and  a  scheme-specific  tariff  to \ndefray  the  O&M  costs;  (iv)  the  subproject  complies  with  ADB  safeguard  policies  and  has  no \nsignificant  environmental \ninvoluntary \nresettlement\u2014for any small parcel of land donated by any community individual for purposes of \nwater  source  development,  overhead  reservoir,  water  transmission  line,  and  wastewater \ndisposal works\u2014if there is no livelihood from or occupation of the land or if the land is barren, \nand it has no impact on the livelihood of any individual; (vi) the PMU will prepare an IEE and, as \nrequired, an environmental impact assessment; and (vii) the CDWUU will sign two agreements \nsubstantially in line with the samples agreed upon between DRWS and ADB (Appendix 12 and \n5). The first agreement relates to the community\u2019s commitment to take over the subproject with \nfull  responsibility  for  O&M;  the  second  agreement  refers  to  voluntary  transfer  of  ownership  of \nsmall  parcels  of  land  for  the  subproject.  Implementation  of  any  subproject  estimated  to  cost \nmore than $300,000 will require ADB's approval, to ensure the use of simple and cost-effective \ntechniques.  Other  subprojects  will  require  DRWS  approval,  but  ADB  will  also  review  these \nsubprojects selectively to ensure compliance with the selection criteria.  \n\nthe  subproject  will  not \n\ninvolve  any \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement \n\n34. \nThe  Project  will  continue  to  disburse  funds  based  on  the  existing  ADB  procedures  in \naccordance  with  the  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  A \nnew imprest account will be established at a bank to be agreed upon by the Government and \nADB  to  facilitate  the  timely  release  of  grant  funds.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  will  supervise  the \nimprest  account  operations.  The  individual  payments  that  may  be  reimbursed  or  liquidated \nunder the statement of expenditure procedure will not exceed $50,000 equivalent.  \n\n8. \n\nProject Review, Accounts, and Audits \n\n35. \nThe PMU and PIU will continue to maintain separate records and accounts adequate to \nidentify  financing  resources  received  and  expenditure  made  on  the  Project,  including \nexpenditure  for  works,  equipment,  and  services  financed  out  of  the  grant  proceeds  and  local \nfunds.  The  grant  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  in \naccordance with  sound  auditing  standards  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  EA  will  submit \nannual audited reports, including separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest account and \n\n\f14 \n\nthe  statement  of  expenditure  procedures,  and  audited  financial  statements  to  ADB  within  6 \nmonths after the end of each fiscal year.  \n\n9. \n\nGovernance and Anticorruption \n\n36. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA,  implementing  agency,  PMU,  PIU,  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n\n37. \nUnder  the  Project,  there  have  been  allegations  of  possible  fraud  by  contractors  in \n10 subprojects.  These  are  being  currently  investigated  by  ADB.  In  the  meantime,  the \nGovernment  has  agreed  to  take  the  following  measures  to  strengthen  financial  controls  and \nprevent misuse of funds. It will  \n\noversee financial management of the Project based on the approved Guidelines \non  Administrative  and  Finance  Management  of  the  PMU  through  the  DRWS \norder no. 9 of 22 February 2007;  \n\ninstitute  a  system  of  controls  to  ensure  that  all  cash  and  banking  transactions \nundergo  four  levels  of  checks\u2014accountant,  financial  manager,  director  of  the \nPMU, and director general of DRWS;  \n\nsubmit monthly and quarterly financial reports to the Ministry of Finance and ADB \nto confirm compliance with accounting standards and fund utilization;  \n\nsubmit  all  withdrawal  applications  for  replenishment  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance \nand ADB with detailed information on current expenditures for the related period \nwith supporting documents confirmed by the director of the PMU after verification \nby the financial manager and PMU consultants;  \n\nmanage  and  tally  financial  data  periodically  on  the  Software-1C  system  at  the \nPMU; \n\nhave the project accounts audited annually by  the chamber of accounts and by \nan \nthe  audit \nrecommendations;  \n\nfirm,  and  promptly  comply  with \n\nindependent  auditing \n\nensure  that  the  technical  supervision  consultant  (a)  provides  third-party  quality \nassurance  on  construction  practices  and  appropriate  equipment  and  material \nusage  by  contractors,  and  (b)  applies  adequate  quality  assurance  and  control \nmeasures during project implementation; and \n\nensure that the PMU staff and project consultants (a) undergo training on ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy,  (b)  understand  how  and  where  fraud  and  corruption  may \noccur, and (c) learn possible measures to reduce such occurrences. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n \n\n\f15 \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS  \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n38. \nThe  supplementary  grant  is  expected  to  benefit  about  200  villages  with  an  overall \npopulation of about 300,000 people. It will improve living standards, the environment, and public \nhealth. Related benefits include time and cost savings from purchasing, fetching, treating, and \nstoring water; improved hygiene and health; reduced medical outlays; and increased productive \ndays.  The  grant  will  also  support  improvements  in  operational  efficiency  of  the  community-\nbased organizations.   \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial Analysis \n\n39. \nThe  analysis  of  the  three  core  samples  have  been  updated  in  consideration  of  the \nsubstantial price hikes that were unforeseen during the initial project preparation stage. For the \nfinancial analysis, the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) was estimated at 3% and the \nfinancial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  in  the  base  case  ranged  between  7.5%  and  9.4%.  The \neconomic  analysis  indicates  that  the  subprojects  are  economically  viable  with  the  economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) exceeding the economic opportunity cost of capital (EOCC) in all \ncases. The EOCC was assumed at 12% and the EIRRs in the base case range between 23.4% \nand  28.8%.  The  resulting  benefit\u2013cost  ratios  for  the  subproject  range  between  1.35  and  1.5, \nalso  denoting  feasibility.  Sensitivity  analysis  conducted  to  test  the  robustness  of  the  financial \nsustainability and economic viability of subprojects when subject to change (a 20% increase in \ncapital  cost,  a  20%  increase  in  O&M  cost,  a  20%  reduction  in  benefits,  and  a  1-year  delay  in \nbenefits) indicate that in all cases subproject FIRRs surpass the WACC and EIRRs surpass the  \nEOCC.  Details  of  the  financial  and  economic  analysis  are  in  Appendixes  13  and  14,  and  in \nSupplementary Appendix B.  \n\n40. \nReassessment  of  the  financial  sustainability  and  economic  viability  suggests  that  the \nintegrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  increased  costs.  For  higher \nfinancial  and  economic  returns,  the  planned  coverage  needs  to  be  achieved  and  a  smooth \ntransition undertaken from completion of works to operations. Analysis findings indicate that the \nsample subprojects are financially viable on two measures: (i) required periodic tariff increases \n(herewith  assumed  every  2  years),  and  (ii) tariff  subsidization  based  on  cost  recovery  with \nregard  to  consumer  affordability.  For  these  measures  to  be  relevant  to  the  succeeding \nsubprojects  under  the  supplementary  financial  assistance,  they  would  be  incorporated  when \npreparing  subproject  financial  operational  plans.  These  plans  and  related  issues  have  been \ndiscussed and agreed with DRWS for achieving financial sustainability of the overall investment. \nIssues  pertaining  to  subsidization,  the  manner  of  implementation,  and  funds  sourcing,  are \nspecifically relevant. Affordability is a major factor in determining subsidy requirement, and thus \nhousehold  income  bases  may  need  to  be  reviewed  periodically.  There  is  an  ongoing  effort  by \nthe CDWUUs and the PMU for improved tariff collection. This includes improvements in service \ndelivery, introducing consumer services to register complaints and urgently rectify the situation, \nand the proposed involvement of the ayil okmotu for helping the CDWUUs in bill collection and \ndisconnecting the services of nonpayers. The ayil okmotu also have funds in case of revenue \nshortfall  for  addressing  major  breakdowns  in  the  water  supply  system,  which  are  beyond  the \nfinancial capacity of the CDWUUs. \n\n\f16 \n\nC. \n\nRisks \n\n41. \nFour possible project risks have been identified: (i) turnover of existing staff of the PMU \ncan adversely affect the quality and efficiency of work and thus delay project implementation; (ii) \npoor  selection  of  contractors  at  any  time  during  the  implementation  could  hamper  the  project \nquality  and  community  members  might  consequently  withdraw  from  their  commitment  to  take \nover  the  O&M  of  the  subprojects;  (iii)  selected  sources  of  water  supply  might  turn  out  to  be \nunsustainable;  and  (iv)  the  Project  may  become  unsustainable  if  tariffs  are  not  periodically \nincreased. The Project includes the following measures to mitigate these risks. \n\n42. \nThe  Government  shall  endeavor  that  no  staff  transfers  take  place  during  the  project \nimplementation period and the capacity of the PMU and/or PIUs will be further strengthened as \nper agreed staffing strength. To ensure the selection of qualified contractors, the performance of \nexisting  contractors  will  be  reevaluated  to  qualify  only  those  contractors  who  have  performed \nwell during the initial project implementation. Further, a more stringent criterion will be applied \nfor  the  prequalification  of  new  contractors.  For  the  selection  of  sustainable  water  sources, \nimproved  guidelines  for  undertaking  comprehensive  investigations  have  been  agreed  that  will \nensure  the  desired  water  yield  from  the  selected  water  supply  sources.  Involvement  of \ncommunities  in  the  identification  and  selection  of  sources  and  the  overall  implementation  will \nensure  their  ownership  and  minimize  the  risk  of  subprojects  being  unsustainable.  The \nGovernment has also assured that the ayil okmotu, as mandated by law,5 will ensure CDWUUs \nrevise tariffs periodically to meet O&M costs of subproject.

The price escalations in construction material over the project period \nhave affected the overall impact of the Project.1  \n\n2. \nThe civil works and equipment component of the Project constituted 71.5% of the total \nproject  cost.  Civil  works  comprised  supply  and  laying  of  pipes  (steel,  asbestos  cement,  and \npolyethylene  pipes),  valves  and  appurtenances,  fuel  for  operation  of  heavy  machinery  and \nfreight, steel, and cement concrete for construction of storage reservoirs. Equipment comprised \npumping  machinery  for  deep  boreholes  and  for  discharging  water  to  households  in  elevated \nareas of the villages. The cost overrun analysis was carried out on (i) construction material price \nvariation, and (ii) price indices for construction commodities over the project period from 2002 to \nthe end of the second quarter of 2008. \n\nB. \n\nPrice Variation Analysis \n\n3. \nConstruction Material Price Variation. Supply and laying of pipes (steel and asbestos \ncement)  were  the  major  constituents  in  the  construction  contracts  awarded  during  the  initial \nproject  period.  Evaluation  of  quoted  prices  for  seven  contracts  on  the  above  items  between \n2002  and  2007  indicates  a  238%  rise  in  unit  rates  of  supply  and  laying  of  steel  pipes  (220 \nmillimeters  [mm]  diameter)  and  asbestos  cement  pipes  (150  mm  diameter).  On  average,  the \naforesaid items constitute 10%\u201350% of the total contract value, based on the subproject design. \nTable  A2  provides  details  of  variation  in  construction  material  unit  price  drawn  from  contracts \nawarded during the period. \n\n4. \nConstruction  Commodity  Price  Index.  The  summary  price  index  (SPI,  or  the \nconstruction  price  coefficient)  for  construction  commodities  generated  by  Gosstroi  (the  State \nCommittee  for  Architecture  and  Construction  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic)  is  an  indicator  of  the \nmarket rates of construction materials. The SPI is derived based on the price index adopted by \nproducers  of  construction  materials  (for  civil  works),  for  vehicles  and  equipment  used  in \nconstruction,  and  other  capital  expenditure,  and \nthe \nabovementioned elements in the total volume of investment in the base cost of the works. \n\nis  weighted  by \n\nthe  share  of \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB,  2000.

It is based on \nthe  Soviet  system  of  determining  prices  based  on  a  baseline  cost  in  1991;  the  Gosstroi  then \nadjusts  the  prices  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  context.  Figure  A2  indicates  the  variation  in \nconstruction  price  coefficients  (or  SPI)  over  the  initial  project  period  along  with  the  status  of \ncumulative contract awards and utilization. \n\n(i) \n\nPrice  index  for  construction  materials  (civil  works)  is  computed  on  the  basis  of \ncommodity  prices,  the  cost  of  spare  parts,  and  the  cost  of  structures  procured  by \nmajor  contracting  organizations  throughout  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.

Reviewing the SPI rise in light of a 238% rise \nin  pipe  material  cost,  it  is  evident  that  the  Project  could  not  cover  the  proposed  population. \nFurther,  the  executing  agency  was  forced  to  limit  the  subcomponent  to  water  supply  alone \ninstead  of  the  originally  planned  subcomponents  of  water,  sanitation,  and  the  roads  sector  in \nboth villages and urban centers. \n\n7. \nFactoring  for  unanticipated  rises  in  construction  commodity  prices,  the  supplementary \ngrant will cover approximately 300,000 persons with water and sanitation infrastructure to meet \nthe project objectives. The Project will therefore cover 75% of the originally designed population \ncoverage on completion in 2012. \n\n \n\n\f24         Appendix 3           \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry/Project Title: Kyrgyz Republic: Community-Based Infrastructure Services Sector Project \n\nLending/Financing \nModality:  \n\nSector \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision \n\nCentral and West Asia Department \nSocial Sectors Division \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n\nThe Joint Country Support Strategy (2007\u20132010)a for the Kyrgyz Republic supports the Government\u2019s country development \nstrategy  2007\u20132010  (approved  in  May  2007),  which  focuses  on  four  strategic  pillars\u2014economic  development,  governance \nand transparency in public administration, human development, and environmental sustainability\u2014and builds on the strategy \nlaid out in the national poverty reduction strategy 2003\u20132005.  \n\nThe  joint  country  support  strategy  will  focus  programs  on  (i)  improving  economic  management  consistent  with  strong  and \nsustained  pro-poor  growth,  reducing  corruption,  improving  governance,  and  ensuring  effective  public  administration;  (ii) \nbuilding  sustainable  human  and  social  capital  through  improved  health  and  education  outcomes;  and  (iii)  ensuring \nenvironmental sustainability and natural resource management. \n\nThe Project is consistent with the joint country support strategy, the Government\u2019s country development strategy 2007\u20132010, \nand the national poverty reduction strategy. The supplementary grant to the Project will focus on addressing water supply and \nsanitation  services  in  200  villages  covering  approximately  300,000  beneficiaries.  Direct  benefits  will  be  providing  the \ncommunity access to safe drinking water and improved sanitary conditions through safe disposal of night soil. Further, treated \nwastewater disposal will ensure that contamination of surface and groundwater sources is prevented.  \n\nThe  facilities  built  under  the  supplementary  grant  will  reduce  the  burden  on  women,  who  are  the  main  collectors  of  water. \nImprovements  in  the  quality  of  water  and  disposal  of  treated  wastewater  will  lead  to  public  health  improvements  and \nconsequent reductions in the burden of  diseases, treatment costs, and  productive losses, the impact of  which is felt  by the \npoor in particular. Women, especially poor women, will benefit from the reduction in the time and energy spent in fetching and \nstoring water, and in the work associated with cleaning and family health care.  \n\nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n\nPoverty remains high in the Kyrgyz Republic, although extreme poverty is moderate. According to official government data for \n2005, on the basis of consumption per capita, an estimated 43% of the population lived below the poverty line and 11% were \nin extreme poverty. The national poverty line is determined on the basis of the food and nonfood consumption pattern of the \nlower  income  group  of  the  Kyrgyz  population,  and  not  on  international  poverty  lines.  The  unit  of  observation  for  poverty \nstatistics  is  the  individual.  Almost  three  quarters  of  poor  and  extremely  poor  people  live  in  rural  areas  due  not  only  to  the \nhigher proportion of the population living in this sector but also to the higher prevalence of poverty: 51% of the rural population \nlived  in  poverty  compared  with  30%  of  the  urban  population.  The  incidence  of  poverty  is  over  50%  in  five  out  of  the  eight \noblasts (provinces)\u2014Batken, Naryn, Osh, Jalal-Abad, and Issyk-Kul\u2014in both the northern and southern parts of the country. \nPoverty  and  low  incomes  are  prevalent  in  those  areas  where  geography  (i.e.,  mountains),  poor  infrastructure,  and  cross-\nborder issues constrain access to markets. A large number of the poor live in rural Osh and Jalal-Abad, which are the most \npopulous oblasts and fall within the Project\u2019s jurisdiction.  \n\nEconomic  growth  has  resulted  in  falling  poverty  over  the  last  half-decade.  In  2000,  according  to  official  Government \nestimates,  poverty  affected  63%  of  the  population  and  over  the  next  5  years  fell  by  a  remarkable  20  percentage  points; \nhowever, that finding may in part be a reflection of a change in surveys. Even over the last 3 years, for which comparable data \nare  available,  poverty  responded  strongly  to  economic  growth:  for  every  1%  increase  in  gross  domestic  product  per  capita \nduring 2003\u20132005, extreme poverty fell by 5% and overall poverty fell by 2%. The reduction in poverty has also been assisted \nby  the  decline  in  the  real  prices  of  utilities,  which  continue  to  be  heavily  subsidized  and  are  far  below  their  cost-recovery \nlevels.  Much  of  the  decline  in  poverty  stems  primarily  from  the  fall  in  extreme  poverty,  especially  in  rural  areas.  Moderate \npoverty (the difference between overall poverty and extreme poverty) declined marginally from 33% to 32% and largely due to \na decrease in urban moderate poverty rates. \n\nSince  human  development  indicators  are  closely  correlated  with  income,  economic  recovery  is  highly  relevant  to  the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals, which the Project directly addresses by reducing the proportion of people \nwithout sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. \n\naADB,  Swiss  Cooperation,  United  Kingdom  Department  for  International  Development,  United  Nations  Agencies,  and  World  Bank  Group. \n2007.

Manila.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3          25 \n\n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA. \n\nFindings of Social Analysis  \n\nIncome  and  Living  Standards.  The  survey  conducted  suggests  that  poverty  in  the  southern  urban  areas  is  far  more \nwidespread than in the northern urban areas. In the surveyed towns, over 38% would appear to be living in extreme poverty, \nwhile  over  70%  are  living  in  poverty.  The  figures  for  the  southern  towns    may  be  exaggerated  by  the  use  of  the  national \npoverty  level,  as  food  prices  in  particular  are  considerably  lower.  In  the  rural  areas,  for  all  the  villages  surveyed,  52%  of \nexpenditure  was  on  food,  12%  on  utilities,  and  13%  on  education.  While  the  villages  chosen  for  the  survey  all  suffer  from \nsubstantially nonfunctioning or no water supply systems, there would appear to be a close connection between this fact and \nthe  prevalence  of  poverty.  The  figures  do  suggest,  however,  that  care  will  need  to  be  taken  to  allow  some  cross-subsidy \nwithin the individual systems, from those who are better off and may request individual connections and those who will collect \ntheir water from public standpipes. \n\nWater  Supply.  In  the  villages  surveyed,  only  32%  of  households  had  access  to  a  piped  water  supply  system.  Thirty-three \npercent use the river and a further 9% irrigation channels; 15% had water delivered by truck and the remainder used private \nwells or other sources. Twenty-seven percent of all households had to travel more than a kilometer to the source, while less \nthan  half  were  within  200 meters of their main source  of  water. About  57% thought their  water tasted, looked, and smelled \ngood, while around 15% thought they had bad water, and the remainder were ambivalent. Sixty percent complained that their \nmain  source  of  water  was  not  available  all  year,  with  the  main  reasons  given  being  the  poor  state  of  the  equipment  and \nfreezing of the source. \n\nSanitation. In all the villages surveyed, almost all households use simple pits, which, once full, are covered and a new one is \ndug. The most frequent form of wastewater disposal is to throw it in the yard or into an open pit in the garden. Only 2% have \nseptic tanks. The majority (about two-thirds) bathe at home, while 32% use public or private bathhouses. When asked where \nthey  would  prefer  to  bathe,  68%  mentioned  public  bathhouses.  However,  in  many  places  the  bathhouse  no  longer  works, \neither because it has broken down or because of the lack of water. \n\nPerceived Needs for Services. Water was perceived as the highest priority for all the villages surveyed; it was mentioned by \nover  95%  of  all  households.  Sanitation  was  not  recognized  as  a  priority  by  many  people.  Less  than  7%  sought  improved \nindividual toilets, and 13% wanted improved school toilets. Bathhouses were, however, a perceived need for about 60% of all \nhouseholds surveyed. \n\nWillingness to Pay. Twenty-three percent expressed a willingness to pay in advance for the development or improvement of \nthe  water  supply  system.  All  those  who  wanted  to  improve  their  wastewater  disposal  system  (about  25%)  said  they  were \nwilling to pay; of these, approximately 84% mentioned an initial cost contribution of about Som200 per capita. The willingness-\nto-pay  analysis  in  the  core  communities  shows  that  about  60%  of  the  households  have  monthly  incomes  of  less  than \nSom1,000  and  the  average  household  consists  of  five  to  six  family  members.  The  surveyed  households  stated  that  water \nsupply in their community was insufficient and a 45% increase of the existing supply is needed. Fifty-one percent expressed \ntheir willingness to have their own house connection. They are willing to pay an average Som1,000 for a connection and to \nspend an average  of Som30\u2013Som50 (or Som5\u2013Som10 per person) for  monthly  water  bills;  on  average, this represents the \nactual average expected connection fee and monthly water bills of the subprojects. \n\nSocial  Impact.  The  supplementary  grant  will  contribute  to  improvements  in  health  and  will  provide  an  opportunity  to \nstrengthen the role of women in the community and thereby raise their status. It will also lessen the burden on women as the \nmain collectors of water and the nursing of the sick affected by unsanitary conditions. Time will be saved and improved health \nshould  result  in  improvements  in  greater  productive  capacity  of  the  whole  population.  The  subprojects  will  provide \nemployment opportunities for residents, both in the construction or repair of water supply and sanitation systems, as well as in \nthe  management  of  the  systems.  All  the  community  drinking  water  users\u2019  unions  (CDWUUs)  will  require  some  accounting \nservices and there is a strong tradition for women to enter this profession. It is expected that women, by being involved in the \nCDWUU boards, will be empowered, and that this will result in further initiatives being developed by them. \n\nB. \n\nConsultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n\nExtensive  consultations  have  been  undertaken  with  stakeholders  including  beneficiary  communities,  nongovernment \norganizations  and  community-based  organizations,  elected  representatives  (such  as  village  councils),  administrative \ndepartments,  oblast  and  rayon  (district)  administrations,  and  representatives  of  various  central  Government  ministries. \nConsultation workshops, meetings, focus group discussions, and structured interviews were undertaken with stakeholders.  \n\n \n\n\f26         Appendix 3           \n\n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n\n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n\nExtensive  information  dissemination  and  consultations  have  been  undertaken  to  ensure  stakeholder  participation  in  the \nproject  design.  During  the  supplementary  grant  design,  it  was  noted  that  a  key  factor  in  the  nonperformance  of  many \nsubprojects  in  the  initial  Project  was  lack  of  participation  from  the  community  in  general  and  the  poor  in  particular.  The \nconsultation  and  participation  plan  comprises  three  distinct  components:  (i)  the  community  awareness  and  participation \nprogram, (ii) the hygiene and sanitation education program, and (iii) the asset management and strengthening program. \n\nA major feature of the training and capacity-development subcomponent of the Project is enabling the local self-governments \n(ayil okmotus) to take a more participatory approach to water supply and sanitation development and service delivery. Along \nwith  the  CDWUU,  the  ayil  okmotu  will  play  a  key  role  in  detailed  planning,  design,  and  implementation  of  the  Project. \nImplementation support includes the provision of social and community development experts  within the PMU and the PIUs, \nand the conduct of community awareness programs by nongovernment organizations. \n\nOngoing  consultation  and  participatory  monitoring  will  help  ensure  that  the  Project  meets  the  needs  of  the  community.  The \nconsultations may take the form of annual surveys, combined with community forums or focus group discussions. The media \nfor this public information mechanism will include local television, newsletters, and community meetings.  \n\nC. \n\nGender and Development \n\nKey Issues.  \n\nPrimary and secondary information was analyzed to assess the status of women in the project villages. There are significant \ndifferences in the status of women in the project villages, especially between those villages in the north and south. Women \nare  most  frequently  the  household  member  most  affected  by  the  lack  of  adequate,  clean,  and  safe  water.  In  the  surveyed \nvillages, women were the most frequent primary collectors of water (40%). However, in over a fifth of all households it was the \nadult males; children collected water in 15% of cases. Overall, adult women were the main collectors of water when there was \nno individual connection (in 45%). In the south, in 50% of the cases it was the women and only 9% cases the men, while in \nthe northern town, men and women shared this task equally, also relying less on the help of children.  \n\nThese  figures  suggest  a  clear  need  to  ensure  women  are  involved  in  the  design  of  water  supply  systems  and  in  the \nmanagement of the system. In most villages, women are severely underrepresented on the village councils. From the reports \nof  the  social  organizations  of  the  core  subproject  villages,  women  expressed  a  clear  desire  to  play  a  central  role  in  the \nplanning and management of water systems. \n\nKey Actions.  \n\nMeasures  included  in  the  design  to  promote  gender  equality  and  women\u2019s  empowerment\u2014access  to  and  use  of  relevant \nservices, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n\n \n\n  Gender plan       \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\nThe Project responds to the key issues above in the design of its subprojects.  \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nIssue \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \n\nStrategy to Address \nIssue \n\nPlan or Other Measures \nIncluded in Design \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement\n\nNo Impact \n\nNo impacts.

This  environmental  assessment  and \nenvironmental \nthe \nsubproject selection criteria, requirements for consultants, and disclosure, monitoring, reporting, \nand  institutional  arrangements  for  preparing,  reviewing,  and  clearing  subproject  environmental \nassessment reports, staffing, and budget. \n\nframework  document  details \nreview \nimpacts  and  recommended  mitigation  and  management  measures, \n\n2. \nThe  Community-Based  Infrastructure  Services  Sector  Project  (comprising  water  supply \nand  sanitation  services)  is  classified  under  ADB  guidelines  as  a  category  B  project.  For  this \nProject,  selection  criteria  for  future  subprojects  mandates  that  only  category  B  or  C  projects, \nwhich have no water or wastewater treatment components, will be considered for funding. The \nKyrgyz  Republic  Law  on  Ecological  Expertise  requires  infrastructure  upgrading  projects  to  be \nsubjected  to  environmental  assessment.  Under  the  ADB  Environment  Policy  (2002),  the  first \nstage in developing an environmental assessment is an initial environmental examination (IEE) \nand if the IEE concludes that a more comprehensive environmental impact assessment is not \nrequired,  then  the  IEE,  incorporating  an  environmental  management  plan,  becomes  the  final \nenvironmental  assessment  document.  The  IEE  will  be  prepared  taking  into  account  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines. \n\nB. \n\nEnvironmental Description \n\n3. \nAll subproject sites are rural villages and small towns which are primarily agricultural in \nnature.  Because  of  the  low  income  levels,  social  services  and  infrastructure  are  mostly \ninadequate.  On  account  of  numerous  watershed  areas,  snow-covered  mountains,  and  large \nriver basins, many villages and towns are located near rivers and water courses. Groundwater, \nwhich is available throughout the country in adequate quantities, is used for drinking purposes \nand  is  generally  of  high  quality,  meeting  the  national  drinking  water  quality  standards  with \nrespect to physical, chemical, and bacteriological parameters. \n\n4. \nBeing  a  mountainous  country  with  numerous  rivers  and  valleys,  floods  are  common  in \nthe  Kyrgyz  Republic.  Major  floods  occur  particularly  in  the  south.  The  drainage  systems  are \nusually inadequate to deal with floods and overflows carrying dirt and polluted waters. \n\n5. \nLack  of  proper  sanitation  in  rural  areas  is  reflected  in  the  increased  incidence  of \nwaterborne and excreta-related diseases. Disposal of human wastes in the villages is through \nrudimentary pit latrines, which are odorous  and unhygienic. Every household has a temporary \npit latrine where the superstructure is made of materials such as wood, corrugated asbestos, or \nother  materials.  Planks  of  wood  are  used  to  squat  on,  and  when  the  unlined  pit  is  full  the \nstructure  is  shifted  to  another  location.  Likewise,  the  school  toilets,  which  have  rudimentary \nseptic  tanks,  are  also  in  poor  condition.  Pit  latrines  and  septic  tank  overflows  are  allowed  to \npercolate  into  the  ground.  Other  wastewater  from  the  rural  houses  is  disposed  of  into  the \ndrainage ditches.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4          29 \n\nC. \n\nImpacts and Measures \n\n6. \nOverall,  the  supplementary  grant  will  improve  health  through  financing  the  provision  of \nsafe water supply and the improvement of sanitation systems. Identified negative impacts during \nconstruction  are  moderate  in  extent  and  can  be  mitigated.  Potential  environmental  impacts \nassociated  with  the  design,  construction,  and  operation  of  the  water  supply  and  sanitation \nsystem  include  (i)  location-specific  impacts  related  to  the  pipeline  routes,  (ii)  risk  of \ncontamination  of  the  sources,  and  (iii)  rehabilitation  and  construction  of  sewer  pipelines  and \nsanitation facilities. All potential environmental impacts and respective mitigation measures are \nlisted in Table A4.3. \n\nD. \n\nImplementation Framework and Staffing \n\n7. \nThe government institutions responsible for the implementation of the proposed Project \ninclude the Department of Rural Water Supply (DRWS) as the executing agency and the project \ncoordination committee comprising representatives from DRWS, the National Agency for Local \nSelf-Government  (NALSG),  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  the  Ministry  of  Health.  The \nsupplementary grant will be implemented by the project management unit (PMU), NALSG, and \nthe  Republican  Centre  for  Health  Promotion\u2014the  implementing  agencies.  Locally  the \ncommunity  drinking  water  users\u2019  unions  (CDWUUs),  village  health  committees,  and  the  ayil \nokmotu  (village  administration)    will  oversee  the  project  planning,  design,  and  implementation. \nInstitutional  responsibilities  are  summarized  in  Table  A4.1.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for \noverseeing  preparation  of  the  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  and  respective \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMPs).  The  PMU  will  seek  the  clearance  of  the  IEEs  and \nEMPs  from  the  Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection  or  ADB,  as  appropriate,  prior  to  bid \nissuance.  \n\nE. \n\nEnvironmental Monitoring and Reporting \n\n8. \nWater quality sampling will be conducted seasonally at time of discharge, commencing 1 \nyear  before  construction  to  establish  a  baseline.  During  operation,  a  water  quality  monitoring \nplan  shall  be  implemented.  All  samples  must  adhere  to  the  sanitary  and  epidemiological \nservices  of  the  Ministry  of  Health\u2019s  guidelines.  Environmental  management  shall  include \nprocedures for (i) workers\u2019 health and safety, and (ii) waste disposal and chemical handling for \nconstruction  wastes.  The  PMU  assisted  by  the  domestic  environment  consultant  will  oversee \nEMP  implementation,  and  prepare  and  submit  the  annual  environmental  monitoring  report  to \nADB. \n\n \n\n\f30 \n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nOrganization \nPrimary \nProject \nManagement \nUnit (PMU) \n\nSecondary \nDRWS (Chair) \nand Project \nCoordination \nCommittee \n \n\nPMU \n\nDRWS \n\nPMU \n\nDRWS \n \n\nTable A4.1: Institutional Responsibility Matrix \n\n \n\nResponsibilities \n\nReview environmental clearance of physical investments \n\nProvide guidance for upholding environmental policy requirements \n\nSubmit annual environmental performance report during project implementation \n\nUndertake overall coordination with government entities and supervision \n\nSubmit initial environmental examinations (IEEs), environmental management plans \n(EMPs), and environmental clearance contracts to the Ministry of Environmental \nProtection (represented by the State Agency on Environmental Protection and Forestry) \n\nEstablish environmental classifications of subprojects and determine when subproject \nIEEs are required \n\nEnsure environment-related information is disclosed to affected people in accordance \nwith ADB Public Communications Policy (2005) before or during the consultation \n\nPrepare and submit subproject IEEs to the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP)  \n\nPrepare subproject environmental monitoring and management plans for MEP approval \n\nEnsure environmental clearance approval and compliance with regulations \n\nOversee  water quality monitoring and reporting to MEP and local governments \n\nImplement environmental mitigation and monitoring measures  \n\nUndertake civil work surveys \n\nConsult the public and/or convene community focus groups \n\nUndertake remedial action when unexpected environmental impacts occur \n\nPrepare the annual environmental monitoring report and submit to ADB \n\nPMU \nConsultant \n\nDomestic Social \nand \nEnvironmental \nSpecialist and \nEnvironmental  \nEngineer \n\nAssist the PMU in classifying the project and preparing IEEs and EMPs  \n\nEnsure environmental clearance conditions for MEP approval \n\nIncorporate environmental requirements in civil work contracts \n\nUpdate and implement environmental mitigation measures \n\nProvide environmental training and oversee information disclosure and public \nconsultation \n\nAssist the PMU in preparing the annual environmental monitoring report for submission \nto ADB \n\nCoordinate with PMU and make key decisions on behalf of the community and \ncommunity drinking water users\u2019 unions \n\nReview IEE and EMP for subprojects costing more than $300,000 and undertake post-\nfacto review for any other subprojects \n\nEnsure that the EMPs form a part of the contract document for civil works \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, DRWS = Department of Rural Water Supply, EMP = environmental management plan, IEE = \ninitial environmental examination, MEP = Ministry of Environmental Protection, PMU = Project Management Unit \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nLocal \nGovernments \n\nADB \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4          31 \n\nF. \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\n9. \nAccording  to  the  fundamentals  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  Law  on  Ecological  Expertise, \nevery citizen has a right to request complete information concerning the environmental situation \nwith  regards  to  new  construction  projects.

The  project  area  covers  four  oblasts  (provinces)\u2014Chui,  Jalal-\nAbad,  Osh,  and  Batken.  The  Project  was  designed  to  provide  basic  infrastructure  services  in \n730  villages  and  7  small  towns  to  about  1.5  million  persons,  of  whom  about  70%  were  living \nbelow the poverty line. \n\n2. \nThe  proposed  supplementary  grant  is  required  to  meet  the  financing  gap  that  has \nemerged due to significant increases in construction costs during the implementation period. As \na  result,  the  scope  of  the  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  component  was  reduced  from  the \noriginally planned 240 subprojects to 118 subprojects, and the balance dropped. The proposed \nsupplementary  grant  will  implement  the  remaining  122  subprojects  within  the  original  scope, \nproviding  much-needed  water  supply  and  sanitation  services  for  the  rural  population  as \nprioritized  by  the  Government.  Based  on  the  lessons  learned  from  the  Project,  proposed \nchanges  include  (i)  simplification  of  the  subproject  selection  criteria  to  ensure  the  selection  of \ncommunity-owned, demand-driven, and cost-effective subprojects; (ii) improvement of technical \ndesign  criteria  for  implementing  simple,  technically  sound,  and  cost-effective  subprojects;  and \n(iii)  improvement  of  implementation  arrangements  to  achieve  efficiency  and  quality  during \nproject implementation. \n\n3. \nThe  objective  of  the  supplementary  grant  is  to  improve  living  standards,  environment, \nand public health by financing safe, reliable piped water supply and sanitation (WSS) facilities in \nabout  200  villages  in  four  oblasts,  which  is  expected  to  benefit  about  300,000  people.  The \nDepartment  of  Rural  Water  Supply  (DRWS)  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  Project.  The \nexisting project management unit (PMU) at DRWS will continue to provide overall coordination. \nThe National Agency for Local Self-Government (NALSG) and the project implementation units \n(PIUs) already established at oblast level will jointly implement the Project.   \n\n4. \nSmall-scale  WSS  subprojects  will  consist  primarily  of  a  network  of  underground \npipelines, water intake, storage reservoirs, and wastewater disposal. By their very nature these \nworks  will  be  constructed  in  the  public  rights-of-way.  However,  land  will  be  required  in  small \nparcels  for  the  purposes  of  water  source  development,  overhead  reservoirs,  the  water \ntransmission lines, and wastewater disposal works. Experience from the Project has shown that \ncommunities  or  individuals  always  volunteered  their  land  (e.g.,  unutilized  community-owned \nland)  for  these  small  facilities  that  benefit  them  directly.  This  was  also  confirmed  during  the \nspecial  loan  review  mission  in  May  2008  through  a  study  of  45  selected  subprojects.  Further, \nthe subproject selection criteria also require that there is no occupation on the land and it has no \nsevere impact to any individual.   \n\nSubproject Selection. Each subproject will be selected in accordance with the criteria \n\n5. \ndetailed in the main text of this report.  \n\n                                                 \n1    ADB,  2000.

Manila.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5     37 \n\nB. \n\nPurpose of the Resettlement Framework \n\n6. \nSince no legal and policy frameworks of the Kyrgyz Republic exist for land donation, this \nresettlement framework sets out the procedure for land donation from individuals who are willing \nto contribute their lands voluntarily.     \n\nC. \n\nVoluntary Contributions \n\nWhere local communities or individuals elect to make voluntary contribution of affected \n7. \nland without compensation in accordance with traditional practices, this shall be acceptable only \nif the following safeguards are in place: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nConfirming  that  a  full  consultation  with  landowners  and  any  non-titled  affected \npeople on site selection was conducted; \nEnsuring  that  voluntary  donations  do  not  severely  affect  the  living  standards  of \naffected  people,  and  are  linked  directly  to  benefits  for  the  affected  people,  with \ncommunity  sanctioned  measures  to  replace  any  losses  that  are  agreed  to \nthrough verbal and written record by affected people; \nConfirming any voluntary donation through written record and notarized such as \nthrough a designated nongovernment organization or legal authority; \nIndicating the time period of effectiveness and the conditions of the servitude; \nAttaching the location of the servitude to the contract; and  \nPlacing adequate grievance redress mechanisms. \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n \nInstitutional Arrangements \n\nD. \n\n8. \nFor compliance with the Asian Development Bank's (ADB\u2019s) social safeguard policies in \nthe  project  activities,  the  Project\u2019s  executing  agency,  DRWS  through  its  PMU,  will  have  the \noverall  coordination  and  responsibility  for  land  donation  activities  under  the  Project.  A  project \ncoordination  committee\u2014comprising  representatives  from  DRWS,  NALSG,  the  Ministry  of \nFinance,  and  the  Ministry  of  Health\u2014will  meet  at  6-monthly  intervals  (or  earlier  if  needed)  to \noversee  project  implementation  and  provide  decision-making  support  on  all  aspects  of  the \nProject.  A  district  project  implementation  review  committee  will  monitor  compliance  of  the  laid \ndown  procedures  for  land  donations  from  individuals  who  are  willing  to  contribute  their  land \nvoluntarily. \n\nThe  implementation  of  land  donation  activities  in  the  subprojects  will  be  supported  by \n9. \nsocial  safeguard  specialists  of  the  technical  design  consultancy  at  PIU  level  and  facilitated  by \nthe  ayil  okmotu  (Village  Administration).  Community  facilitators  of  the  PIUs  will  also  assist  the \nsocial safeguard specialist in the land donation activities, when required.   \n\n10. \nCommunity  drinking  water  users\u2019  unions  (CDWUU)  will  be  established  with  assistance \nand  support  by  community  facilitators  in  every  village  of  the  project  sites.  The  CDWUUs  will \nreceive  support  from  community  facilitators  to  increase  their  social  awareness  and  technical \ncapacity for implementing the project activities. \n\n11. \nInstitutional assessment of DRWS and the PIUs have concluded that DRWS is capable \nof  dealing  with  resettlement  issues, since  it  has  accumulated  resettlement  experience  through \ncurrent  and completed  rural  water  supply  improvement  and  construction  works  throughout  the \ncountry.  DRWS  has  access  to  lawyers  experienced  in  resolving  resettlement  issues  with \ncommunity heads and community members.  \n\n \n\n\f 38  \n\nAppendix 5       \n\nE. \n\nDisclosure, Consultation, and Grievances \n\n12. \nLand  donations  would  be  carried  out  in  close  consultation  with  all  stakeholders  and  in \nline  with  the  resettlement  framework.  It  will  involve  focus  group  discussions  and  community \nmeetings especially, with the individuals who are willing to contribute their land voluntarily. The \nPIUs and ayil okmotu will be responsible for disseminating the information on the status of land \ndonations to all stakeholders including all the beneficiaries of the subproject. The resettlement \nframework  will  be  included  in  the  project  implementation  guidelines  to  be  used  by  social \nsafeguard  specialists,  community  facilitators,  CDWUUs,  PIUs,  and  ayil  okmotu.  Copies  of  the \nresettlement framework will be available in the local government and CDWUU\u2019s offices and will \nbe posted on the ADB and Project websites.   \n\nAny affected person will have the right to file complaints and/or queries on any aspects \n13. \nof the land donation activities of the subprojects. At the village level, complaint from any affected \nperson can be filed with the CDWUU\u2019s members and/or ayil okmotu for an immediate solution. If \nthe  problem  cannot  be  solved,  the  CDWUU\u2019s  members  and  ayil  okmotu  staff  will  facilitate  the \naffected persons to submit their complaints to the Project\u2019s grievance and redress committee at \nthe  district  level.  Community  facilitators  will  record  the  complaint  and  report  to  the  PIUs.  The \nProject  will  dedicate  district  staff  to  be  in  charge  of  handling  and  following  up  on  affected \npersons\u2019 complaints.  \n\n14. \nThe  grievance  redress  committee  will  comprise  one  representative  each  from  the \nrespective PIU, CDWUU, and ayil okmotu; affected persons; and relevant government officials \nwith  functional  and  legal  authority.  The  committee  will  review  grievances  involving  all  issues. \nGrievances  will  be  redressed  within  2\u20134  weeks  from  the date  of  lodging  the complaints  at  the \ndistrict level.   \n\n15. \nComplaint  and  grievance  procedures  and  guidelines  will  be  included  in  the  project \nimplementation  guideline  to  be  disseminated  by  the  community  facilitators  to  the  affected \ncommunities during the facilitation process and project implementation.  \n\nF. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n16. \nThe project monitoring and evaluation mechanism for land and social safeguard issues \nwill  be  included  in  the  internal  monitoring  and  evaluation  report  prepared  by  the  executing \nagency. One section of the regular internal monitoring report will be dedicated to reporting and \ndiscussing issues related to social safeguards in project activities.  \n\n17. \nThe  district  multistakeholder  steering  committees  will  serve  as  the  external  monitoring \nagencies of the Project. The external monitoring activities specifically focusing on this issue will \nbe conducted twice a year during the project implementation period. Monitoring reports will be \nposted on ADB\u2019s website. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5     39 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLETTER OF CONSENT FOR VOLUNTARY LAND DONATION \n\nBy \n\nIn favor of \n\nMr/Ms/Mme. _____________ resident of village  ______, Oblast ______ herein after called the \nparty No. 1 and  transferor, the owner of the land plot sized ___ Sq. meter, Plot No__________, \naccording to the revenue record of _____ Oblast \n\nthe  ayil  okmotu  of  village  ______  Oblast    ________  herein  after  called    the  party  No.2  and \ntransferee  of    the  land  plot  sized  ___  Sq.  meter,  Plot    Number  ________,  according  to  the \nrevenue  record  of  Village    _______    Rayon  ________  and  Oblast    __________,    for  the \nsubproject  under  Community-Based  Infrastructure  Services  Sector  Project  for  the  village, \nregistered  under  number  _________  dated  ________,  represented  by  the  Chairman  and \nsecretary by designation. \n\n1. \nI,  the  party  No.1  and  the  transferor,  hereby    provide  certification  regarding  my  true \nownership of the land and agree to voluntarily transfer by way of donation the ownership of  land \nor portion of the land, plot sized ___  , Number _________ according to the revenue record of  \n_____ Rayon ________ and Oblast  ________, in the name of ayil okmotu, the party No.2 and \nthe transferee, for any community development purpose including the construction of overhead \nreservoir (OHR), oxidation pond/s  and pump house under the said subproject.

The  Constitution,  the  Water  Code,  and  other \nlegislation  related  to  drinking  water  supply  and  local  self-governments  provide  the  basis  for \nlong-term  sustainability  of  water  and  sanitation  services  in  the  country\u2014in  the  above  order  of \npriority. \n\nChapter  4  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  Water  Code  (2005)  lays  down  the  legal  and \nregulatory  framework  for  abstraction  and  use  of  water  resources,  which  prescribes \nthe  use  of  water  for  drinking  and  domestic  purposes  and  the  use  of  sewage  and \nwastewater for irrigation.  \n\nArticle  5  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  Drinking  Water  Law  (1999)  prescribes  the \nresponsibility of local administration bodies and the local state administration in the \nareas of water supply to the population. The local bodies are inter alia responsible for \nplanning,  financing,  implementing,  and  overseeing  works  related  to  development  of \nwater  and  sanitation  services,  and  setting  tariffs  to  recover  operation  and \nmaintenance costs.  \n\nArticle  18  of  the  Law  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  on  Local  Self-Government  and  Local \nState  Administration  (2008)  defines  the  role  of  local  bodies  and  indicates  that  the \naffairs  of  local  significance  inter  alia  comprise  drinking  water  supply,  and  ensuring \noperations of sewerage systems and treatment plants.  \n \n\n2. \nService  Sustainability.  Service  sustainability  under  the  supplementary  grant  financing \nis  determined  by  the  technical,  institutional,  and  financial  sustainability  of  the  proposed \nimplementation  arrangement.  Under  the  initial  project,  the  Department  of  Rural  Water  Supply \n(DRWS) provided project management and implementation support to multilateral-funded rural \nwater supply projects for water supply and sanitation (WSS) asset creation; there is no mandate \nfor  DRWS  to  ensure  WSS  service  delivery.  Asset  management,  service  delivery,  and  asset \nstrengthening  post-construction  were  the  responsibility  of  the  community  drinking  water  users\u2019 \nunion  (CDWUU).  Being  a  nonprofit organization  with  limited  financial capacity  and  absence  of \nan accountable relationship with the local self-government,  reliance on the CDWUU to ensure \nlong-term service delivery is not likely to provide a sustainable solution in the long term. Based \non  the  prevailing  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  the  WSS  service  is  more  likely  to  be \nsustainable over the long term based on the following: \n\nTechnical sustainability. Involvement of the community and the ayil okmotu (village \nadministration)  along  with  the  DRWS  project  management  unit  (PMU)  in  project \nplanning,  designing,  financing,  and  implementation  is  more  likely  to  result  in  locally \nacceptable  and  sustainable  technical  solutions.  The  ayil  okmotu\u2019s  participation \nthrough  the  project  period  will  ensure  that  the  asset  handover  at  subproject \ncompletion is smooth, and system component and condition is acknowledged by the \nayil okmotu. \n\nInstitutional  sustainability.  While  asset  ownership  will  rest  with  the  ayil  okmotu \n(notwithstanding the equity contribution in capital expenditure by the community), a \nservice delivery agreement between the ayil okmotu and the CDWUU is more likely \nto  result  in  efficient  services  with  a  financial  commitment  by  the  ayil  okmotu  to \nprovide  financial  support  for  any  major  breakdown  in  the  system  and  long-term \ncapital  investment  planning.  DRWS  would  provide  technical  solutions  and  asset \ncreation oversight in the long-term, subject to the ayil okmotu\u2019s demand for system \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n\f42          Appendix 7 \n\nexpansion and capital investment plans. Delegating service delivery to the CDWUUs \nis  a  pragmatic  option  considering  the  geographical  spread  of  the  villages  thereby \navoiding  the  need  to  strengthen  the  ayil  okmotu  with  additional  human  resources \ncentrally and incurring additional expenditure on personnel management. \n\n(iii) \n\nFinancial  sustainability.  The  current  tariffs  cover  various  taxes  levied  on  the \nCDWUU  and  the  debt-servicing  component  towards  capital  expenditure.  By \ndelegating  the  service  delivery  responsibility  to  the  CDWUU,  the  ayil  okmotu  may \napprove a tariff to ensure cost recovery for operation and maintenance but continue \nto be responsible for service delivery. The tariffs are likely to be more affordable and \nthe ayil okmotu may then limit its role to strategic and financial planning for system \nbreakdown maintenance and long-term capital investment planning. \n\nGiven  the  underlying  legal,  regulatory,  and  service  sustainability  frameworks,  project \n3. \nexecution  under  the  supplementary  grant  financing  will  be  through  DRWS  with  a  long-term \nmandate for WSS sector development, providing the policy directive and financial support to the \nsector.  The  existing  joint  PMU  at  DRWS  will  continue  to  provide  overall  coordination.  The \nNational  Agency  for  Local-Self-Government  (NALSG)  and  the  project  implementation  units \nalready  established  at  oblast  (province)  level  will  jointly  implement  the  Project.  The  PMU  and \nthe  project  implementation  units  will  ensure  asset  creation  and  capacity  building  of  the \nCDWUUs in asset management and strengthening. NALSG will ensure ayil okmotu participation \nin the project cycle and commitment to meet WSS service delivery obligations. With the help of \nthe  PMU,  NALSG  will  elicit  ayil  okmotu  and  CDWUU  participation  through  community \nawareness  and  participation,  and  hygiene  and  sanitation  education  programs.  A  project \ncoordination  committee,  comprising  representatives  from  DRWS,  NALSG,  the  Ministry  of \nFinance, and the Ministry of Health, will (i) meet at 6-monthly intervals (or earlier if needed), (ii) \noversee project implementation, and (iii) provide decision-making support on all aspects of the \nProject. As a long-term sector development strategy, the Kyrgyz Republic is actively reviewing \nthe  water  policy  (prepared  by  the  Department  for  International  Development  of  the  United \nKingdom)  where  a  strong  emphasis  is  laid  on  local  self-government  involvement  in  service \ndelivery. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fREVISED PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS \n\n \n\nDepartment of

procedures  to  be  followed  for  national  competitive  bidding  shall  be  for  tendering  with \nunlimited participation and the two-stage tendering set forth in Law of the Kyrgyz Republic on \nPublic  Procurement  of  Goods,  Works  and  Services  effective  on  April  2004  with  the \nclarifications and modifications described in the following paragraphs required for compliance \nwith the provisions of the ADB Procurement Guidelines. \n\n2. \n\nEligibility \n\nADB:  The  eligibility  of  bidders  shall  be  as  defined  under  section  I  of  ADB's  Procurement \nGuidelines, published by ADB in April 2006; accordingly, no bidder or potential bidder should be \ndeclared  ineligible  to  ADB-financed  contracts  for  other  reasons  than  the  ones  provided  by \nsection  I  of  ADB\u2019s  guidelines.  Bidders  must  be  nationals  of  member  countries  of  ADB,  and \noffered goods, works and services must be produced in and supplied from member countries of \nADB. \n\n3. \n\nPrequalification \n\nNormally,  post-qualification  shall  be  used  unless  explicitly  provided \nloan \nagreement/procurement  plan.  Irrespective  of  whether  post  qualification  or  prequalification  is \nused, eligible bidders (both national and foreign) shall be allowed to participate. \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\nin \n\n4. \n\nRegistration and Licensing \n\n(a) \n\nBidding shall not be restricted to pre-registered/licensed firms. \n\n(b)  Where  registration  or  licensing  is  required,  bidders  (i)  shall  be  allowed  a \nreasonable  time  to  complete  the  registration  or  licensing  process;  and  (ii)  shall \nnot  be  denied  registration/licensing  for  reasons  unrelated  to  their  capability  and \nresources  to  successfully  perform  the  contract,  which  shall  be  verified  through \npost-qualification. \n\n(c) \n\nForeign bidders shall not be precluded from bidding. If a registration or licensing \nprocess  is  required,  a  foreign  bidder  declared the  lowest  evaluated  bidder  shall \nbe given a reasonable opportunity to register or to obtain a license. \n\nThe minimum bidding period is twenty-eight (28) days prior to the deadline for the submission \nof bids. \n\n5. \n\nBidding Period \n\n6. \n\nBidding Documents \n\nProcuring  entities  should  use  standard  bidding  documents  for  the  procurement  of  goods, \nworks and services acceptable to ADB. \n\nNo domestic preference shall be given for domestic bidders and for domestically manufactured \ngoods. \n\n7. \n\nPreferences \n\n8. \n\nAdvertising \n\nInvitations  to  bid  shall  be  advertised  in  at  least  one  widely  circulated  national  daily \nnewspaper  or  freely  accessible,  nationally-known  website  allowing  a  minimum  of  twenty-\neight  (28)  days  for  the  preparation  and  submission  of  bids.  Bidding  of  NCB  contracts \nfor  goods  and  related  services  or \nestimated  at  US$500,000  equivalent  or  more \nUS$1,000,000  equivalent  or  more  for  civil  works  shall  be  advertised  on  ADB\u2019s  website  via \nthe posting of the Procurement Plan. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10         49 \n\n9. \n\nBid Security \n\nWhere required, bid security shall be in the form of a bank guarantee from a reputable bank. \n\n10. \n\nBid Opening and Bid Evaluation \n\nBids shall be opened in public. \nEvaluation of bids shall be made in strict adherence to the criteria declared in the \nbidding documents and contracts shall be awarded to the lowest evaluated bidder. \n\nBidders  shall  not  be  eliminated  from  detailed  evaluation  on  the  basis  of  minor, \nnon-substantial deviations. \n\nNo  bidder  shall  be  rejected  on  the  basis  of  a  comparison  with  the  employer's \nestimate and budget ceiling without the Bank\u2019s prior concurrence. \n\nA  contract  shall  be  awarded  to  the  technically  responsive  bidder  that  offers  the \nlowest evaluated price and who meets the qualifying requirements set out in the \nbidding documents.  \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n(g) \n\nNo negotiations shall be permitted. \n\nPrice verification shall not be applied.  \n\n11. \n\nRejection of All Bids and Rebidding \n\nBids shall not be rejected and new bids solicited without ADB\u2019s prior concurrence. \n\n12. \n\nParticipation by Government-owned enterprises \n\nGovernment-owned  enterprises  in  Kyrgyz  Republic  shall  be  eligible  to  participate  as  bidders \nonly  if  they  can  establish  that  they  are  legally  and  financially  autonomous,  operate  under \ncommercial law and are not a dependent agency of the contracting authority. Furthermore, they \nwill be subject to the same bid and performance security requirements as other bidders. \n\n13. \n\nRight to Inspect/Audit \n\nA provision shall be included in all NCB works and goods contracts financed by ADB requiring \nsuppliers  and  contractors  to  permit  ADB  to  inspect  their  accounts  and  records  and  other \ndocuments relating to the bid submission and the performance of the contract, and to have them \naudited by auditors appointed by ADB. \n\n14. \n\nFraud and corruption \n\na.  The  Government  shall  reject  a  proposal  for  award  if  it  determines  that  the  bidder \nrecommended  for  award  has,  directly  or  through  an  agent,  engaged  in  corrupt, \nfraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices in competing for the contract in question. \n\nb.  ADB  will  declare  a  firm  or  individual  ineligible,  either  indefinitely  or  for  a  stated \nperiod, to be awarded a contract financed by ADB, if it at any time determines that \nthe  firm  or  individual  has,  directly  or  through  an  agent,  engaged  in  corrupt, \nfraudulent,  collusive,  coercive  or  obstructive  practices  in  competing  for,  or  in \nexecuting, an ADB-financed contract. \n\n15. \n\nNational Sanctions List \n\nNational sanctions lists may be applied only with prior approval of ADB. \n \n\n \n\n\f50          Appendix 11 \n\nA. \n\nGeneral Procedure \n\nSUBPROJECT SELECTION CRITERIA \n\nUsing  applications  for  improved  water  supplies  from  communities  in  the  project  area,  the \n1. \nconcerned  ayil  okmotu  will  draw  up  priority  lists  of  subproject  communities.  The  project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  will  then  assess  the  needs  and  demands  of  the  listed communities  and \ntheir  willingness  to  participate  in  development,  management,  and  maintenance.  The  PMU  will  (i) \nrefine the priority list; (ii) through its community development unit (CDU), hold a series of meetings \nin  each  community  on  the  refined  list;  and  (iii)  prepare  feasibility  studies  in  consultation  with  the \ncommunities. Where a feasibility study meets the selection criteria, DRWS will seek approval of the \nrelated ayil okmotu to proceed with detailed design and construction. \n\nThe departmental subcommittee chaired by the director general of DRWS will approve all \n\n2. \nsubprojects.  \n\nB. \n\nProposed Selection Criteria \n\n3. \nThe  preparation  of  the  list  of  communities  requiring  assistance  will  be  based  on  current \npractice,  to  which  new  steps  have  been  added  to  assess  the  willingness  of  the  communities  to \nparticipate in the Project and sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with advance deposit of \ntheir specified cash share. Three selection and screening phases have been devised to arrive at \nthe final list of about 122 subprojects to be financed under the supplementary grant. \n\n1. \n\nPreselection of Subprojects \n\nAccording  to  needs,  ayil  okmotus  will  list  the  communities  applying  for  water  supply  and \n4. \nsanitation  within  the  four  oblasts  (provinces)  covered  by  the  Project,  and  forward  the  list  to  PMU \nand DRWS. The main criteria are that \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n2. \n\nthe  community  is  primarily  located  in  an  area  where  there  is  an  acute  shortage  of \nwater  or  the  existing  system  of  water  supply  and  sanitation  is  dilapidated  and \nrequires major rehabilitation or replacement, and \n\nthe community does not have a water supply and sanitation scheme. \n\nSelection of Subprojects \n\n5. \nDuring  this  phase,  the  CDU,  in  consultation  with  each  community,  will  assess  the  needs \nand  demands  as  well  as  the  willingness  to  accept,  manage,  and  maintain  the  proposed  water \nsupply and sanitation schemes. The main criterion for preparing the refined list will be the desire \nexpressed  by  the  community  for  a  water  supply  and  sanitation  scheme  and  their  acceptance  of \ncapital  cost  sharing  and  responsibility  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  the  scheme \n(including  costs)  upon  completion.  In  this  respect,  the  community  drinking  water  users\u2019  unions \n(CDWUUs)  will  sign  an  MOU  and  deposit  in  the  joint  bank  account  with  the  PMU  an  amount \nequivalent to an estimated 2 months O&M expenditure of the scheme, as an initial commitment.   \n\n6. \nTrained  CDU  staff,  comprising  a  team  of  one  community  development  officer  and  two \ncommunity-based motivators (one male and one female), will conduct needs assessment in each \ncommunity. The actual needs and expressions of interest in the scheme will be assessed through \nparticipatory socioeconomic surveys. The CDU staff will survey each community using participatory \ntechniques  to  determine,  among  other  things,  population  and  number  of  households,  household \nincome  levels,  present  sources  of  water,  who  collects  the  water,  how  much  time  is  spent  in \ncollecting water, any cost associated with the present source, as well as residents' willingness to \npay for O&M of the scheme. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11        51 \n\nThe CDU staff will also conduct open-ended interviews with key respondents to identify (i) \n7. \nethnic groups and community leadership, institutions, and organizations; (ii) the community's self-\nhelp  development  experience;  (iii)  the  residents'  perceptions  of  the  success  or  failure  of  the \nProject; and (iv) the community\u2019s willingness to assume O&M responsibility. \n\nThe likelihood of the scheme\u2019s success will be assessed based on the residents' ability and \n8. \nwillingness  to  operate  and  manage  the  scheme,  the  level  of  social  cohesion,  and  evidence  of  a \nspirit of self-reliance. The existence of local organizations that could undertake the responsibility, \nand a level of knowledge and skills related to water supply and sanitation systems, will be positive \nfactors  in  determining  whether  the  community  can  be  expected  to  be  successful.  Training  needs \nfor scheme maintenance will be assessed and recommendations made for training the community \nmembers before and during subproject construction and subsequent commissioning. \n\nFor  a  village  or  cluster  of  villages  under  a  subproject  where  a  pump-based  water  source \n9. \nwould  be  involved,  the  minimum  population  should  be  1,000  (2007  census).  This  is  required  to \nensure that the per household tariff remains affordable to the communities.  \n\nRegarding rehabilitation, only those schemes that have been abandoned for reasons such \n10. \nas nonavailability of canal, river, ground, or spring water source failure, or completed its designed \nlife will be selected. However, schemes abandoned due to nonpayment of electricity bills will not be \nconsidered  unless  the  community  pays  for  the  arrears.  Priority  will  be  given  to  schemes  that \nrequire  minor  rehabilitation  or  benefit  a  large  population,  or  where  per  capita  cost  is  minimal. \nProject consultants will determine the components of the schemes requiring rehabilitation. \n\n11. \nFor gravity-based schemes and cost-effective small-pump schemes, selection will be based \non all conditions defined in paras. 5\u201310. With regard to the population threshold, selection will be \nbased not on the minimum population size but on the capital cost ceiling as reflected in para. 15. \n\n3. \n\nFinal Approval of Subprojects \n\n12. \nThe  PMU  will  carry  out  feasibility  studies  and  prepare  cost  estimates  for  communities  for \nwhich the need assessments indicate that schemes built under a community-based approach are \nlikely  to  be  sustainable.  The  PMU  will  assist  these  communities  to  form  CDWUUs,  jointly  plan \nsubprojects with their CDWUUs, and finalize the MOU with them. Final selection will be based on \nthe findings of the feasibility studies and compliance with the following criteria: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nSuitable  technical  options  have  been  explored  and  the  availability  of a  sustainable \nwater  source  is  confirmed  through  adequate  investigation  and  field  tests  for  the \nappropriate location, required quantity, and sustained supply of water of acceptable \nquality. \nA least-cost comparison of technically feasible options has been prepared and the \nleast-cost option is selected. \nThe subproject indicates an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 12% and/or a \nbenefit\u2013cost ratio (BCR) greater than unity. \nThe community is willing to share in the capital cost of the subproject in cash as per \nestablished  criteria  of  5%  of  the  capital  cost  of  the  subproject.  For  very  costly \nschemes  the  socioeconomic  profile  of  the  villages  will  be  worked  out  to  determine \nan affordability level.  \nThe community is willing to accept responsibility for O&M and is willing to pay for all \nO&M expenses. \n\n(vi)  Maps, plans, and typical sections and details have been prepared to scale, showing \nthe  location,  scope,  and  scale  of  the  subproject;  a  preliminary  cost  estimate  has \nbeen prepared; and the CDWUU has signed on the agreed-upon layout and this is \ncountersigned by ayil okmotu. \n\n \n\n\f52          Appendix 11 \n\nAnnual O&M costs have been estimated and tariffs to recover the costs established. \n(vii) \n(viii)  Service affordability and householders' willingness to pay the established tariff have \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nbeen confirmed. \nAn  implementation  plan  has  been  prepared  showing  the  procedures  for  land \ndonation, construction, and O&M. \nNecessary rights-of-way, water rights, and land requirements have been, or can be, \nfinalized; and an MOU has been signed by the communities with regard to voluntary \ntransfer  of  land  to  CDWUU  (Appendix  12)  for  the  development  of  an  overhead \nreservoir  (if  required),  water  source  development,  or  water  transmission  lines  for \nwastewater disposal. \nEnvironmental impacts have been examined, an initial environmental examination or \nan environmental impact assessment has been prepared, and mitigating measures \nhave been proposed.  \n\n \n13. \nIf  a  subproject's  feasibility  study  meets  requirements  (i)\u2013(xi),  the  relevant  authorities  will \napprove the subproject and the PMU will proceed with design and construction of the water supply \nand sanitation subproject in consultation with the local community. Only subprojects for which land \nrequirements have been satisfied will be included in the program. \n14. \nAffordability to the community and willingness to pay for its scheme's O&M costs will be an \nimportant factor in scheme design and service level. For gravity-based schemes, which are located \nmostly in mountainous areas and where houses are spread out, standposts and water tanks will be \nprovided  in  the  villages  instead  of  household  connections,  to  make  cost-effective  subprojects.  In \ncase  of  pump  subprojects,  however,  individual  household  connections  will  be  viable  in  terms  of \ntariff collection and should be preferred; however, communities may opt to have community tanks \nand  standposts  instead.  Further,  to  ensure  that  only  cost-effective  schemes  are  built  and  capital \ncosts of subprojects remain within certain limits, on the basis of extensive analysis during project \npreparation,  it  was  agreed  that  the  per  capita  capital  cost  of  different  types  of  schemes  will  not \nexceed the following ceilings (2008 prices): \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nFor new pumping water supply and sanitation (WSS) schemes: Som2,800 ($80). \nFor new gravity-based WSS and minor schemes: Som1,800 ($50). \n\nC. \n\nADB Involvement in the Approval of Subprojects \n\n15. \nThe feasibility studies (including cost estimates and economic and financial justification) of \neach subproject for which the estimated total cost exceeds $300,000 equivalent will be forwarded \nto  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  approval  before  implementation.  All  other  schemes, \nprovided they meet the selection criteria, will be constructed without prior ADB approval, but ADB's \nreview missions will audit these schemes on a post-facto basis. ADB's approval must be obtained \nbefore implementing any subproject that is substituted for a subproject already approved by ADB. \n\nD. \n\nOperation and Maintenance \n\n16. \nOn completion of the construction and commissioning phase, the consultants will prepare a \ncompletion certificate after verifying that the subproject has been constructed as per agreed-upon \nscope and specifications, and there are no shortcomings in terms of leakages or water pressure at \nterminal  points.  Following  the  signing  of  this  certificate  by  the  CDWUU  and  the  related  project \nimplementation  unit  and  ayil  okmotu,  and  confirmation  of  the  community's  satisfaction  with  the \nsubproject works, the certificate will be issued to the contractor. During project implementation and \nbefore  handing  over  of  the  subproject,  the  PMU  will  train  CDWUUs  on  technical  and  financial \noperations  and  provide  preventive  O&M  manuals  in  the  local  language  and  a  set  of  booklets \nrelated to budgeting and accounts.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12       53 \n\nTRIPARTITE AGREEMENT \n\nMemorandum of Understanding (MOU) \n\n \n\nbetween \n\nAyil Okmotu of -----------  and \n\nthe Department of the Rural Water Supply (DRWS) \n\nKyrgyz Republic \n\nthe Community Drinking Water Users\u2019 Union (CDWUU) of (Name of subproject, Oblast), \n\n1. \nThis MOU records the agreements of the CDWUU, ayil okmotu, and the DRWS, through \nits  project  management  unit  (the  PMU),  relating  to  the  CDWUU's  subproject  proposal  for  the \nconstruction  of  water  supply  and  sanitation  scheme  (the  subproject)  under  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)-assisted  Community-Based  Infrastructure  Services  Sector  Project \n(the Project). \n\n2. \nUpon signing the MOU, CDWUU will with the assistance of the PMU (i) is established;

Although financial and economic justifications were found sufficient for the \neight  community  water  and  sanitation  representative  subprojects  under  the  Community-Based \nInfrastructure  Services  Sector  Project,1  the  recent  developments  affecting  prices  calls  for  an \nupdated  analysis  of  new  core  samples.  Three  samples  subprojects  have  been  chosen  from \namong 38 operational subprojects in Chui oblast (province): Archaly, supplied through a spring \ncapture  system;  Kosnovka,  supplied  through  surface  water;  and  Krasnaya  Rechka,  supplied \nthrough  a  deep  borehole.  A  review  of  the  operational  subprojects  under  the  Project  also \nindicates the need to set up a basis for a revised financial operational plan that will help ensure \nthe  sustainability  of  these  subprojects  and  the  potential  subprojects  undertaken  through  the \nsupplementary grant. \n\n2. \nComparative  Assessment.  The  review  reveals  three  specific  issues  that  need  to  be \nresolved through an analysis of the core subprojects. These are (i) low collection rates that stall \ngrowth, (ii) insufficient tariffs that fail to cover rising operating costs, and (iii) the fact that there \nhave  been  substantial  increases  in  unit  operating  and  capital  investment  costs.  Based  on \nproject  management  unit  (PMU)  information  as  of  June  2008,  of  38  operational  Chui \nsubprojects,  11  (29%)  collect  less  than  20%  of  expected  tariff  revenue  and  four  (10%)  show \ncollection greater than 70% of the expected tariff revenue. Only 29 reportedly collect enough to \nrecoup operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, with 13 earning some excess to also cover a \nportion of depreciation or maintenance reserves. Subproject Archaly reports a 51% current tariff \nrevenue  collection  rate  with  O&M  coverage  at  only  35%,  and  subproject  Krasnaya  Rechka \nshows  a  60%  current  tariff  revenue  collection  rate  with  O&M  coverage  at  58%.  Subproject \nSosnovka  reports  a  high  102%  tariff  revenue  collection  rate,  including  past  year\u2019s  arrears. \nSubproject  Sosnovka  current  tariff  revenue  collection  covers  only  32%  of  O&M.  The  review \nfindings points to the need for an updated analysis of the three sample subprojects following the \nmethodology  applied  in  the  project  preparation  under  the  Project,  and  as  prescribed  by  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). The approach to the analysis, revised assumptions, analysis \nresults, and conclusion are discussed in the following sections. \n\n3. \nMethodology. The three core subprojects were analyzed following the Handbook for the \nEconomic  Analysis  of  Water  Supply  Projects2  and  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of \nProjects.3  The  main  financial  viability  parameters  analyzed  are  (i)  the  financial  internal  rate  of \nreturn (FIRR), with the financial net present value as proxy; and (ii) tariff affordability. Details of \nthe analysis are provided in Supplementary Appendix B. \n\n4. \nAssumptions.  The  key  assumptions  used  are  (i)  investment  costs  at  base  July  2008 \nprices; (ii) physical contingencies at 10%; (iii) local inflation at 10% annually and foreign inflation \nat 2.5% annually; (iv) O&M costs covering salaries, chemicals, power, repair and maintenance, \nand administration based on estimates by design institutes (domestic engineering firms involved \nin  preparing  detailed  engineering  designs  and  estimates)  for  the  technology  used;  (v)  asset \neconomic  life  assumed  at  15  years  for  equipment  and  50  years  for  civil  works;  (vi)  population \ngrowth at 1.6% annually; and (vii) foreign exchange at Som36 = $1. \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2000.

The  investment  cost  has  three  major  components:  (i)  physical \n5. \ninfrastructure,  consisting  of  civil  works,  materials  and  equipment,  and  development  costs \nincluding  design  engineering  and  construction  supervision  and  taxes  and  duties;  (ii)  capacity \nbuilding, including institutional strengthening, hygiene and sanitation education, and consulting \nservices; and (iii) project management support. The three subprojects require an investment of \nSom21.14  million  ($0.59  million),  including  contingencies.  The  capital  costs  for  the  three \nsubprojects are summarized in Table A13.1. \n\nTable A13.1: Subproject Capital Cost  \n\nTotal\n\nArchaly\n\nSosnovka \n\nin Som '000\nKrasnaya R\n\nComponent\n\nA.

Subproject  O&M  costs  include  community  drinking  water \nusers\u2019  union  (CDWUU)  staff  salaries,  power,  chemical  treatment,  administration,  and  repairs \nand  maintenance,  and  are  based  on  PMU  data  on  actual  sample  operations.  Depreciation  is \nassumed at 2% annually for civil works (calculated on a 50-year economic life of components) \nand 6.7% for materials and equipment (calculated on a 15-year economic life). Replacement of \nfully depreciated assets is provided for and assumed to be financed either through net operating \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13        57 \n\nincome  (when  financially  feasible)  or  by  Government,  to  keep  future  tariffs  within  affordable \nlevels. \n\n8. \nService Delivery Assumptions. The analysis is based on the design demand of about \n70  liters  per  capita  day  (lpcd)  for  yard  connection  and  40  lpcd  for  public  standpost  users. \nWatering livestock is provided for in demand measurement, and is assumed to be 10% of total \ndemand for yard and public standpost demand. Lower income households and those remote to \nthe  piped  distribution  are  assumed  to  resort  to  public  standposts  for  their  water  needs.  About \n50%  of  households  are  assumed  to  tap  piped  distribution.  The  demand  forecast  assumes  all \nwater from existing alternative sources will be replaced with subproject water supply. This has \nfeatured as nonincremental water in the economic analysis.  \n\nCost Recovery Analysis. The tariff is established by dividing all cash requirements by \n9. \nthe  volume  of  water  sold.  It  was  assumed  that  the  collection  rate  would  improve  as  service \nimproves. In the analysis, from actual collection rates of below 70% for Archaly and Krasnaya \nRechka and about 80% for Sosnovka, collection rates would reach 95% by year 5. The analysis \ndetermines the level of tariffs required to satisfy the cost recovery options to include: (i) full O&M \ncost  coverage;  (ii)  O&M  cost  plus  depreciation;  (iii)  O&M  plus  debt  payments;  and  (iv) \nbreakeven,  i.e.,  O&M  plus  depreciation  and  debt  payments.  The  required  subsidy  levels  have \nbeen assessed where tariffs are insufficient to attain full cost recovery.  \n\n10. \nTariff Basis and Forecast. The tariffs follow current practice that differentiates tariffs for \nyard connections and public standposts. For yard connections, the tariffs are volume-based and \nstructured  to  prevent  wastage.  Yard  connections  are  charged  three  times  more  than  public \nstandposts. This allows the poor within the community who have lower disposable income to be \nable  to  at  least  cover  their  basic  water  needs.  The  higher-income  households,  generally \nrequiring more water and consequently incurring higher marginal costs, are made to pay more. \nLivestock  water  consumption  is  attached  to  tariff  estimation  for  public  standposts.  In  the \nfinancial  projections,  where  costs  are  given  in  nominal  terms,  the  tariffs  are  projected  to \nincrease  biannually  to  cope  with  cost  inflation.  In  the  FIRR  cash  flows,  the  tariffs  are  given  in \nreal terms. \n\n11.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital. The WACC is calculated in real terms and used as \nthe  hurdle  rate  for  FIRR  to  measure  subproject  viability.  Funding  sources  are  the  ADB  grant \n(80%) and Government contribution (20%). Inflation is estimated at 2.5% for foreign costs and \n10% for local costs. The rates are computed on an after-tax basis, resulting in the WACC in real \nterms  being  estimated  at  3.0%.  The  WACC  calculation  for  the  three  sample  subprojects \ncombined is presented in Table A13.3. \n\nTable A13.3: Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n\nParticulars \n\nADB \nGovernment \nTotal Capital Investment \n\nCapital \n  \n16,909\n  \n4,227\n  \n21,137\n\n \n \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n%\n\nTotal\n \n80.0\n \n20.0\n \n100.0\n\n%Cost of\nCapital\n\n1.5\n13.3\n\nNominal % \n\nWeighted WACC\nCapital\n \n254\n \n562\n \n816\n\n1.5 \n13.3 \n\n  \n  \n  \n\nInflation \nrate % \n2.5 \n10.0 \n\nWACC = weighted average cost of capital \nSource: Project Management Unit estimates. \n \n\nin Com '000\n\nWACC\n\nReal %\n0.00\n3.00\n3.00\n\n \n\n\f58          Appendix 13 \n \n\nAffordability Analysis. Affordability analysis was undertaken to check the level of water \n12. \nexpenditure against average household income. Table A13.4 presents the affordability levels in \neach subproject for year 1 (2009), year 5 (2013), and year 15 (2023). The number of persons \nper  household  and  the  unit  consumption  are  based  on  field  survey.  The  average  household \nincomes are from the social survey conducted in Chui oblast under the project preparation and \nhave  been  escalated  to  account  for  inflation.  Based  on  the  tariff  increases  required  to  satisfy \nviability parameters, water expenditure will eventually overtake average income, and thus tariffs \nwill exceed consumer affordability. To keep tariffs at affordable levels, subsidy infusions during \nspecific periods when tariffs are relatively high will need to be considered. Table A13.4 indicates \nthat the monthly charges under yard connections for Archaly and Krasnaya Rechka exceed the \ngenerally  accepted  limit  of  5%  of  household  income  in  all  specified  periods.  Likewise,  the \ncharges  for  public  standpost  usage  in  Krasnaya  Rechka  substantially  exceed  the  5%  of \nhousehold  income  limit.  Water  expenditure  under  both  service  types  for  Sosnovka  are  within \nacceptable limits. The main factors are Sosnovka\u2019s large customer base relative to the system \ntype, which is also cheaper to operate. In future, selection of subprojects for inclusion under the \nProject would give due consideration to such technical factors. \n\nTable A13.4: Tariff Affordability \n\nSubproject Archaly\nYear 5\n5.6\n\nYear 1 \n5.6 \n\nYear 15\n5.6\n\nSubproject Sosnovka\nYear 5\n3.8\n\nYear 1\n3.8\n\nYear 15\n3.8\n\nSubproject Krasnaya Rechka\nYear 1 \nYear 15\nYear 5\n4.7 \n4.7\n4.7\n\nParticulars\n\nPersons per household \nConsumption, lpcd \nYard connection\nPublic standpipe \n\nAverage monthly consumption, m3\n\nYard connection\nPublic standpipe \n\n70 \n47 \n\n12 \n8\n\nMonthly charge, Som\n\nYard connection, Som/month \nPublic standpipe, Som/month \n\nIncome spent for water (%) \nYard connection  (%) \nPublic standpipe  (%) \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n1,650 \n  \n\n180 \n  \n129 \n  \n58 \n  \n11 \n8\n4\n\n70\n47\n\n12\n\n88\n\n286\n \n205\n \n92\n \n\n12\n9\n4\n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n70\n47\n\n12\n\n910\n \n651\n \n292\n \n\n23\n17\n7\n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n73\n47\n\n8\n5\n\n44\n \n30\n \n30\n \n\n3\n2\n2\n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n73\n47\n\n88\n55\n\n77\n \n54\n \n52\n \n\n3\n2\n2\n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n73\n47\n\n322\n \n223\n \n218\n \n\n8\n6\n6\n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n67 \n41 \n\n9\n6\n\n187 \n \n128 \n \n271 \n \n\n11 \n8\n16\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n67\n41\n\n9\n6\n\n283\n  \n194\n  \n410\n  \n\n12\n8\n18\n\n67\n41\n\n9\n6\n\n3,934\n \n\n796\n \n546\n \n1,155\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n 20\n 14\n 29\n\nHousehold income/mo, Som \n\n2,318\n \n\n3,934\n \n\n1,650\n \n\n2,318\n \n\n3,934\n \n\n1,650 \n  \n\n2,318\n  \n\n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \nFinancial Viability Approach. The subproject is considered viable if the resulting FIRR \n13. \nis greater than the WACC, and the tariff applied to recover cost is affordable to the consumer. \nThe  affordability  analysis  shows  that  for  subprojects  Archaly  and  Krasnaya  Rechka,  the \nprojected  tariffs  required  for  the  FIRR  to  exceed  the  WACC  would  go  beyond  consumer \naffordability.  Thus,  to  satisfy  both  viability  parameters,  tariffs  will  need  to  be  subsidized.  To \nmeasure the subsidy requirements, tariffs have been set at different cost-recovery options that \nwould  result  in  (i)  the  FIRR  exceeding  the  WACC;  (ii)  maximum  affordability,  i.e.,  within  the \ngenerally  accepted  5%  of  household  income;  (iii)  full  O&M  cost  recovery;  (iv)  full  O&M  plus \ndepreciation;  (v)  full  O&M  plus  debt  servicing;  and  (vi)  full  O&M  plus  depreciation  and  debt \nservicing  (the  break-even  level).  Table A13.5  presents  the  tariffs  for  these  options  and  the \nsubsidies  needed  to  attain  financial  sustainability.  Based  on  the  analysis,  all  cost  recovery \noptions  will  require  a  certain  level  of  tariff  subsidization  for  the  subproject  to  attain  viability. \nDetailed analysis is provided in Supplementary Appendix B and is summarized below: \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13        59 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nIf tariffs are set so that the FIRR exceeds the WACC, Archaly and Krasnaya Rechka \nwill require annual subsidies until year 4, while Sosnovka will require subsidies until \nyear 5. \n\nArchaly and Krasnaya Rechka need annual subsidies until year 32 if tariffs are set at \nmaximum affordability. Sosnovka would require subsidies until year 4. \n\nIf  tariffs  are  set  to  attain  breakeven,  some  subsidization  will  still  be  required  until \nyear 5 for all subprojects. \n\n14. \nSensitivity  Analysis.  Sensitivity  tests  were  performed  to  determine  the  effects  of  (i)  a \n20%  increase  in  investment  cost,  (ii)  a  20%  increase  in  O&M  cost,  (iii)  a  20%  decrease  in \nrevenue, and (iv) a 1-year delay in  project revenue generation. In all sensitivity scenarios, the \nFIRR  for  the  three  subprojects  surpasses  the WACC.  All  the  subprojects  remain  robust  under \nadverse  circumstances.

The  three  core  subprojects  are  found  to  be  financially \nviable,  but  will  require  operational  subsidies  to  attain  full  cost  recovery  (O&M,  debt,  and \ndepreciation). At tariffs set for the FIRR to exceed the WACC, the FIRR for subproject Archaly is \n9.4%, for subproject Sosnovka it is 7.5%, and for subproject Krasnaya Rechka it is 8.1%. Tariff \nincreases  every  2  years  are  required  to  attain  a  level  of  self-sufficiency.  However,  to  attain \nfinancial viability throughout the study period, subsidies are required to soften the burden on the \nusers of both yard connections and public standposts. To minimize operational subsidy needs, \ntariffs may be further increased by larger increments and more frequently. However, consumer \naffordability  may  be  compromised,  especially  as  the  current  tariffs  are  already  beyond  the \ngenerally accepted 5% limit. \n\nBenefits  Capital a\n22.0 \n23.3 \n21.5 \n\n134.2\n73.9\n77.7\n\n \n\nthe \n\nConclusion.  The  analysis  of \n\nthree  core  samples  have  been  updated \n\n16. \nin \nconsideration  of  the  substantial  cost  hikes  that  were  unforeseen  during  the  initial  project \npreparation  stage.  Analysis  findings  indicate  that  the  sample  subprojects  are  financially  viable \non  two  measures:  (i)  required  periodic  tariff  increases  (herewith  assumed  every  2  years),  and \n(ii) tariff  subsidization  based  on  cost  recovery  with  regard  to  consumer  affordability.  For  these \nmeasures  to  be  relevant  to  the  succeeding  subprojects  under  the  supplementary  grant,  they \nwould be incorporated when preparing subproject financial operational plans. These plans and \nrelated issues have been discussed and agreed with the Department of Rural Water Supply for \nachieving financial sustainability of the overall investment. Issues pertaining to subsidization, the \nmanner of implementation, and funds sourcing are specifically relevant. Income affordability is a \nmajor factor in determining subsidy requirement, and thus household income bases may need \nto be reviewed periodically. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nREVISED ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\n1. \nObjectives.  Under  the  initial  project  appraisal  for  the  Community-Based  Infrastructure \nServices  Sector  Project,1  economic  and  financial  analyses  were  carried  out  for  eight \nrepresentative  rural  subprojects  for  the  water  supply  component,  with  resulting  indicators \nshowing  all  subprojects  to  be  viable  with  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  ranging \nbetween  13%  and  38.2%,  averaging  28.5%,  and  average  financial  internal  rates  of  return \n(FIRRs)  ranging  between  4.7%  and  14.4%,  and  averaging  11%.  Of  240  subprojects  planned, \nonly  118  have  been  undertaken,  of  which  85  are  reportedly  completed  as  of  the  end  of  2007. \nThe  proposed  supplementary  grant  will  finance  the  completion  of  unfinished  works  and  the \nremaining  subprojects.  The  following  discussions  present  the  economic  viability  analysis  of \nthree  operational  subprojects  chosen  to  represent  the  completed  subprojects  under  the  initial \nProject  and  those  included  under  the  proposed  supplementary  grant.  This  would  ensure  that \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  the  existing  and  completed  subprojects  and  the  new \nassets  under  the  supplementary  grant  reflecting  both  the  costs  of  construction  delays  and  the \nrise in component prices can be adequately covered. As there is no variation in project scope \nand benefits level, the revised economic and financial analyses follow through from the original \nappraisal  approach,  except  for  the  benefit\u2013cost  analysis  that  requires  revisiting.  Similar  to  the \nrevised financial analysis, three core subprojects from Chui oblast (province) were considered to \nrepresent  the  range  of  supply  sources,  population  coverage,  and  system  O&M  within  the  four \noblasts under the supplementary grant (Appendix 13). \n\nMethodology.  The  economic  analysis \n\n2. \nfollows  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nguidelines, including the  Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects2 and the Handbook \nfor  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Water  Supply  Projects.3  The  analysis  describes  the  economic \nrationale  and  target  beneficiaries  and  undertakes  a  viability  analysis  of  the  core  subprojects. \nBased  on  sector  review,  demand  analysis,  and  subproject  beneficiary  assessment,  the \neconomic  benefit\u2013cost  and  sensitivity  analyses  were  carried  out.  The  analysis  compares  the \ncalculated  EIRR  with  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  (EOCC),  assumed  to  be  12%. \nWith  the  EIRR  greater  than  the  EOCC,  the  subproject  proposal  is  deemed  economically \nfeasible. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to see the effects of certain adverse conditions on \nsystem  capital  investment  and  O&M  cost,  revenue  generation,  and  overall  subproject  viability. \nThe  analysis  uses  the  domestic  price  numeraire,  as  benefits  are  nontradable  in  nature.  The \nanalysis  was  undertaken  at  constant  June  2008  price  levels  and  assesses  the  project  effects \nover a 25-year period. \n\nEconomic  Rationale  and  Goals.  The  project  rationale  results  from  the  increasing \n3. \nconcern  over  the  worsening  water  supply  situation  in  the  rural  communities  as  a  result  of \nimplementation delays in ongoing interventions. Without urgent investments to pursue the long-\nterm  objective  of  providing  sufficient  and  secure  water  supply  in  the  selected  regions,  the \nnegative  impacts  on  the  health  of  the  poor  and  their  economic  condition  would  only  tend  to \nnullify  any  efforts  already  undertaken.  The  Project  is  considered  a  high  priority  by  the \nGovernment  and  is  well-integrated  with  other  investment  activities  in  the  four  regions  covered \nunder the supplementary grant. \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2000.

The subprojects were selected based on the design and selection \n4. \ncriteria for rural communities detailed in volume I of the main report prepared under TA 3048-\nKGZ.4  The  selection  process  required  (i)  consistency  with  demand  based  on  community \nwillingness  to  participate  and  contribute;  (ii)  the  least-cost  approach  of  meeting  effective \ndemand in terms of location, scale, and appropriate technology; and (iii) that economic benefits \nwere likely to exceed economic costs. Preference is also given to communities with high water-\nrelated health risks and multiple communities served by single integrated systems. \n\nProject  Components.  The  project  focuses  on  the  secure  and  sustainable  supply  of \n5. \ngood  quality  potable  water  to  rural  communities  within  the  four  regions.  The  physical  works \ncomprise  source  development  for  individual  and  integrated  supply  systems,  to  include \nboreholes,  spring  captures,  and  surface  water  structures.  The  physical  plant  consists  of  trunk \nmains, pumping stations, reservoirs, and treatment facilities. The local distribution networks will \ninclude metered yard connections and public standpipes. The Project will also provide technical \nassistance and capacity building and sanitation and health awareness education. \n\nEconomic  Costs.  The  economic  capital  investment  and  annual  O&M  costs  were \n6. \ncalculated  from  the  financial  cost  estimates  given  in  Appendix  13.  Taxes  and  duties  are \nexcluded  from  the  financial  costs  as  they  represent  transfer  payments.  Price  inflation  and \nmarket distortions are also excluded. The subproject capital and O&M costs are distributed into \ntraded  and  nontraded  components  and  labor.  For  traded  and  nontraded  components,  the \nshadow exchange rate factor is assumed at 1.0 based on rural projects undertaken by ADB and \nthe World Bank in the Kyrgyz Republic. Unskilled labor is available in the rural economy which \nmeans the opportunity cost is lower than the wage rate. The shadow wage rate is assumed to \nbe 0.7 for unskilled labor following estimates made for agricultural and highway projects in the \nKyrgyz  Republic.  The  economic  costs  are  given  in  real  terms  and  phased  over  the  project \ndesign period at 15 years. The cost streams are assessed over 25 years.

Prior to and without the Project, the village communities in the \nsubprojects  relied  on  water  vendors,  trucked  service,  distant  irrigation  canals,  springs,  and \nrivers  as  their  main  water  sources.  With  the  Project,  piped  water  will  replace  all  supplies  from \nthese  sources  that  now  comprise  nonincremental  demand.  The  water  system  in  Archaly \nsupplies about 80% of the population; in Sosnovka and Krasnaya Rechka the systems supply \nabout  90%.  The  supply  situation  is  projected  to  rise  with  population  growth  at  1.6%,  and \nincrease  annually  to  reach  the  design  target  population  served  of  90%  by  year  5.  Current \ndemand averages 70 liters per capita per day (lpcd) for yard connections and 40 lpcd for public \nstandposts. Demand is based on actual survey and assumed to remain at the same level with \nthe  Project  in  place.  In  Chui  oblast  (province),  where  all  three  subprojects  are  located, \nhouseholds  without  yard  connections  spend  about  an  hour  daily  covering  a  distance  of  500\u2013\n1,000 meters to collect water from unsafe rivers or open irrigation canals. Poor maintenance of \nthe  existing  piped  and  nonpiped  systems  (with  effects  seen  more  with  the  latter  type5)  due  to \nlack of operational funds resulting from inadequate tariffs and low collection rates, has also led \nyard  connection  users  to  supplement  their  current  needs  in  the  same  manner,  with  some \n\n                                                 \n5 This  was one of the reasons cited in the social survey  why, even in the rural communities in most regions  where \npiped  systems  exist,  preference  for  yard  connection  is  high.  In  Archaly,  86%  opt  for  direct  yard  connections.  In \nSosnovka  and  Krasnaya  Rechka,  yard  connection  is  even  higher  (96%  in  Sosnovka  and  98%  in  Krasnaya \nRechka). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f64 \n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nreverting to more expensive supplies from trucks and vendors. With available supplies mitigated \nthrough the financial operational plans outlined in the financial analysis (Appendix 13), current \ndemand  levels  will  be  met.  However,  in  more  developed  subproject  communities,  there  are \nconsumers who exceed design demand levels and have the capacity and are willing to pay for \nthe excess. This induced demand arises with the lower price offered with the piped service. The \nsituation leads to the depletion of supply sources earlier (by about 5 years) than the projected \ndesign horizon of 15 years. In this instance, sufficient funds will have been generated from the \nimproved  financial  operational  plans  to  finance  development  of  additional  supply  sources  to \naugment increased demand.6 Table A14.3 presents the current and future demand situation in \nthe  three  samples  subprojects.  For  purposes  of  the  analysis,  year  0  is  taken  as  the  without-\nproject scenario, for although the systems are partially operational, any reported improvements \nto the system and service prior to project interventions remain insignificant. Year 1 represents \nthe  first  year  of  full  or  improved  system  operation,  when  all  facilities,  including  financial \noperational plans, are in place. \n\n9. \nSubproject  Beneficiaries.  Subproject  beneficiaries  comprise  households  with  existing \nconnections  and  those  that  are  yet  to  receive  direct  house  or  yard  connections  but  who \npreviously  obtained  water  from  public  standposts  or  other  sources.  The  beneficiaries  also \ninclude households that will continue to depend on public standposts as the main supply source \nfor economic and technical reasons. In Archaly, the number of beneficiaries is seen to increase \nby  63%  by  year  5  from  the  without-project  situation;  in  Kosnovka  and  Krasnaya  Rechka, \nbeneficiaries  will  increase  by  43%  in  the  same  period.  The  total  beneficiaries  in  the  sample \nsubprojects will reach 14,000 (90% of the total population) by year 15. \n\nTable A14.3: Current and Projected Demand \n\n \n\n \n\nParticulars\n\nYear 0\n1,938\nPopulation\n \n% served population \n 70\nServed population \n1,356\n \n% served - yard connection \n 86\n% served - public standpost \n 14\nLpcd - yard connection \n70\n \n \nLpcd - public standpost \n47\n \n \nLpcd - livestock, % yard + ps lpcd \n 10\nAnnual production, m3 '000 \n36\n \n \nUFW, % production \n 10\nVolume sold, m3 '000 \n33\n \nYard connection \n27\n \n3\nPublic standpost\n \n3\nLivestock\n \n 100 \nTechnical loss, % production \nNon-technical loss, m3 '000 \n 0\nIncremental water, % volume sold \n 15\nNon-incremental water, % volume sold 85\nPersons per household (PPH) \n6\n \nNumber of households \n243\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n  \n  \n\nSubproject Archaly\nYear 1\n1,969\n \n 80\n1,575\n \n 86\n 14\n70\n \n47\n \n 10\n42\n \n 10\n37\n \n31\n \n3\n \n3\n \n 100\n 0\n 15\n 85\n6\n \n282\n \n\nYear 5 Year 15 Year 0\n5,420\n 80\n4,336\n 96\n 4\n73\n \n47\n \n 10\n126\n \n 10\n113\n \n100\n \n3\n \n10\n \n 100\n 0\n 20\n 80\n4\n \n1,148\n\n2,098\n \n 90\n1,888\n \n 86\n 14\n70\n \n47\n \n 10\n51\n \n 10\n45\n \n37\n \n4\n \n4\n \n 100\n 0\n 15\n 85\n6\n \n338\n \n\n2,458\n \n 90\n2,213\n \n 86\n 14\n70\n47\n 10\n59\n 10\n54\n44\n5\n5\n1 00\n 0\n 15\n 85\n6\n396\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n  \n  \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n  \n\nSubproject Sosnovka\n\nSubproject Krasnaya Rechka\n\nYear 1\n5,507\n \n 90\n4,956\n \n 96\n 4\n73\n \n47\n \n 10\n144\n \n 10\n130\n \n115\n \n3\n \n12\n \n 100\n 0\n 20\n 80\n4\n \n1,312\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nYear 5 Year 15 Year 0\n4,724\n \n 80\n3,780\n \n 98\n 2\n67\n \n41\n \n 10\n101\n \n 10\n91\n \n82\n \n1\n \n8\n \n 100 \n 0\n 15\n 85\n5\n \n813\n \n\n5,868\n \n 90\n5,281\n \n 96\n 4\n73\n47\n 10\n153\n \n 10\n139\n \n122\n \n4\n \n13\n 100\n 0\n 20\n 80\n4\n \n1,398\n \n\n6,878\n 90\n6,190\n 96\n 4\n73\n \n47\n \n 10\n180\n \n 10\n162\n \n143\n \n4\n \n15\n \n 100\n 0\n 20\n 80\n4\n \n1,638\n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nYear 1\n4,800\n \n 90\n4,320\n \n 98\n 2\n67\n \n41\n \n 10\n115\n \n 10\n104\n \n94\n \n1\n \n9\n \n 100\n 0\n 15\n 85\n5\n \n929\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nYear 5 Year 15\n5,994\n \n 90\n5,395\n \n 98\n 2\n67\n \n41\n \n 10\n144\n \n 10\n130\n \n117\n \n1\n12\n \n 100\n 0\n 15\n 85\n5\n1,160\n \n\n5,115\n \n 90\n4,603\n \n 98\n 2\n67\n \n41\n \n 10\n123\n \n 10\n111\n \n100\n \n1\n \n10\n \n 100\n 0\n 15\n 85\n5\n \n990\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nlpcd  = liter per capita per day, PPH = persons per household, UFW = unaccounted-for water. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n\n10. \nEconomic  Benefits.  The  main  benefits  would  arise  from  resource  cost  savings  from \nincremental  water  demand  that  arise  from  existing  levels  of  piped  consumption  and  replaced \n\n                                                 \n6   In  this  manner,  additional  costs  arising  from  financing  new  development  will  be  cancelled  out  by  the  benefits \n\nresulting from user willingness to pay for higher consumption. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14        65 \n\nsupplies  from  other  sources.  The  with-project  and  without-project  scenarios  were  evaluated  to \ndetermine the benefits effects.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  project  benefits  were  quantified  based  on  collection  time  and  cost  savings  for \nnonincremental water supply. The cost of time used for collecting water is estimated \nat 50% of the average hourly wage rate in the area and using average distance and \ncollection time. This was multiplied by the shadow wage rate of 0.7, and the number \nof hours spent annually on water collection. To this, the cost of in-house storage and \ntreatment  was  added.  These  benefits  account  for  the  costs  that  households  would \nhave incurred in a without-project situation. The total cost to the household was then \ndivided  by  the  total  water  consumption  to  arrive  at  the  nonincremental  benefit  per \nunit  consumption.  Existing  supplemental  supplies  through  water  vendors,  trucked \nservice,  etc.,  will  be  replaced  by  the  new  piped  system  and  also  form  part  of \nnonincremental inputs.  \n\nInduced demand would comprise incremental benefits, which were valued using the \naverage of the willingness to pay (WTP) based on the contingent valuation method \napplied in the 1999 social survey conducted in the regions, and the long-run marginal \ncost  proxied  by  the  average  incremental  economic  cost  in  the  analysis.7  The \nincremental  benefits  that  accrue  from  induced  demand,  estimated  at  15%\u201320%  of \ntotal projected demand, is due to lower costs associated with piped service with the \nproject. \n\n(iii) \n\nThere  are  no  benefits  assumed  from  nontechnical  loss,  e.g.,  pilferage,  meter \ntampering, and illegal connections, as the systems are small and easily monitored. \n\nEconomic  Benefit\u2013Cost  Analysis.  The  benefit\u2013cost  ratio  (BCR)  is  utilized  in  the \n11. \nanalysis  to  assess  whether  project  benefits  outweigh  costs,  thus  making  the  Project \neconomically  feasible.  The  main  economic  costs  evaluated  in  the  analysis  comprise  capital \ninvestment  and  O&M  costs.  The  major  economic  benefits  include  nonincremental  water \nassessed using resource cost savings approach. The annual cost streams are set against the \nannual benefit streams and discounted using the EOCC at 12% as the hurdle rate. The resulting \npresent  value  of  benefits  is  divided  by  the  present  value  of  costs  and,  if  the  resulting  ratio  is \ngreater  than  or  equal  to  1.0,  the  project  is  deemed  acceptable.  Table  A14.4  summarizes  the \nresults for the three samples, all of which show BCRs above 1.0. \n\nTable A14.4: Benefit\u2013Cost Analysis \n(Som \u2018000) \n\nArchaly\n\nSosnovka\n\nKrasnaya R\n\nSubproject\nPresent Value of Benefits \n\nIncremental \nNon-incremental \n\nPresent Value of Costs \n\nTotal \n\nCapital \nO&M \n\nTotal \n\nBenefit\u2013Cost Ratio \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n618\n \n6,168\n \n6,786\n \n\n1,910\n \n3,054\n \n4,964\n \n1.37\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n1,905 \n \n12,950 \n \n14,854 \n \n\n4,866 \n \n4,116 \n \n8,983 \n \n1.65 \n \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n1,940\n \n21,826\n  \n23,765\n  \n\n8,634\n \n7,974\n \n16,608\n  \n1.43\n \n\n \n\nO&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n                                                 \n\n7   Induced  demand  is  expected  with  the  lower  price  of  piped  water  from  the  new  system  relative  to  the  existing \nprice of delivered water at Com15\u2013Com25/cubic meter (m3). Comparatively, average incremental economic cost \nfor Archaly  is  Com13.21/ m3, for Sosnovka  Com7.69/ m3, and for Krasnaya Rechka  Com17.74/m3. Noted also \nwas  the  dissatisfaction  of  villagers  who  do  not  receive  delivery  on  time  or  at  regular  intervals,  and  with  water \nalways at risk of contamination. Collected water from distant sources was not deemed completely safe to drink. \n\n \n\n\f66 \n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n \n12. \nThe  BCR  is  a  stronger  indicator  of  the  variance  in  the  economic  viability  of  the \nsubprojects under the supplementary grant in comparison to those under the initial Project. For \nsimilar schemes (spring, surface, and borehole water sources), the BCR for subprojects in the \ninitial Project ranged from 3.27 to 4.72; the BCR for subprojects under the supplementary grant \nranged  from  1.37  to  1.65.  The  economic  costs  have  obviously  increased  over  time  with  the \nbenefits  remaining  the  same.  Considering  that  the  BCR  in  all  sample  subprojects  remains \ngreater than unity, the subprojects are economically viable. \n\n13. \nEconomic  Internal  Rate  of  Return.  The  benefits  streams  from  resource  cost  savings \nare compared with the cost streams of capital and O&M costs to determine the discounted net \ncash  flows  and  the  resulting  EIRR  for  each  core  subproject.  Following  ADB  guidelines,  the \nEOCC is set at 12%. The results show all EIRRs exceeding the EOCC. The average EIRR is \n29.7%. For the individual subprojects, the EIRR ranges between 26.6% and 33.9%. Table A14.5 \nindicates EIRRs at base and under stress conditions. \n\n \n\nSubproject \n\nTable A14.5: Economic Analysis Summary Results (%) \nBase \nCase \n28.5 \n33.9 \n26.6 \n\n1-yr Delay \nin Benefit\n18.6\n23.0\n18.8\n\nCapital + \n20% \n22.8 \n26.8 \n21.2 \n\nArchaly \nSosnovka\nKrasnaya Rechka \na At this level of capital cost increase, EIRR will be equal to EOCC at 12%.\n\nBenefit\n-20%\n16.2\n22.4\n16.8\n\nO&M +\n20%\n22.9\n30.5\n23.3\n\nCosts \n32.0 \n45.4 \n35.7 \n\nSwitching Value\nBenefits\n26.7 \n38.2 \n29.9 \n\nCapital a\n94.8\n119.9\n82.3\n\nEIRR  =  economic  internal  rate  of  return,  EOCC  =  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital,  O&M  =  operation  and \nmaintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n14. \nEIRRs  are  tested  for  sensitivity  using  the  following  parameters:  (i)  a  20%  increase  in \ncapital cost, (ii) a 20% increase in O&M cost, (iii) a 20% reduction in benefits, and (iv) a 1-year \ndelay in benefits. Likewise, switching values are applied to the costs and benefits parameters. \nThe  schemes  are  found  to  be  generally  robust  and  insensitive  to  changes  in  capital  cost,  and \nless so to changes in O&M cost. A decrease in benefits would affect Archaly marginally, but the \nrest  of  the  subprojects  will  remain  robust.  A  1-year  delay  in  benefits  would  have  only  slight \neffects. The switching values represent the change in costs and benefits that sets the EIRR at \n12%. The results show the subprojects can absorb changes in costs of between 29% and 39% \nand  remain  economically  viable.  Decreases  in  benefits  of  between  24%  and  33%  are  also \nmanageable.  On  a  constraint  situation,  to  determine  the  maximum  capital  costs,  the  analysis \nindicated  that  the  subproject  capital  cost  may  increase  by  as  much  as  82%\u2013120%  with  EIRR \nstill equal to EOCC.  \n\n15. \nConclusion.  The  economic  analysis  indicates  that  the  subprojects  are  economically \nviable with EIRR values exceeding the EOCC in all cases. It should be noted that this analysis \nexcludes  the  significant  health  and  environmental  benefits  from  these  quantified  results.  The \nsensitivity analysis demonstrates the results to be robust even when tested under unfavorable \neconomic conditions. The resulting BCRs for the subproject range between 1.4 and 1.71, also \nindicating feasibility. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 25 August 2008) \n", "Currency Unit\nCom1.00\n$1.00\n", "som (Som) \n\u2013 \n$0.028 \n= \n=  Som34.69 \n \n", " \n", "The  exchange  rate  for  the  som  is  determined  at  regular  auctions  for  foreign  exchange \nconducted by the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic.
