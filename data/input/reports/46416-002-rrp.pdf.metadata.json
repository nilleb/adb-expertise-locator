The project includes three main components: (i) \nexpansion  of  the  supervisory  control  and  data  acquisition  (SCADA)  system  and  energy \nmanagement  system  (EMS);  (ii)  rehabilitation  of  two  220-kilovolt  (kV)  substations  in  Agarak  2 \nand  Shinuhayr;2 and  (iii)  support  for  institutional  development,  capacity  building,  and  project \nmanagement. The project will increase the supply of electricity to urban and rural consumers to \nsupport inclusive and sustainable economic development.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nArmenia  has  no  proven  oil  or  natural  gas  reserves.  It  imports  most  of  its  fossil  fuel \nresources  from  the  Russian  Federation  (through  Georgia)  and  has  begun  importing  gas  from \nIran. Imports account for about 77% of the total primary energy supply,4 and natural gas imports \nfrom  the  Russian  Federation  account  for  81%  of  total  energy  imports.  Strengthening  energy \nsecurity  and  improving  energy  efficiency  are  the  country\u2019s  top  priorities.  Development  of \nindigenous  energy  resources  and  rehabilitation  of  old  and  inefficient  generation,  transmission, \nand distribution infrastructure are critical to the country\u2019s energy security and more importantly \nto sustainable economic growth. \n \n4. \nArmenia\u2019s  power  system  has  a  total  installed  generation  capacity  of  4,100  megawatts \n(MW), 74% (3,047 MW) of which is operating. Power generation comprises 31% nuclear, 28% \nhydropower,  and  41%  thermal  power  (using  imported  natural  gas).  The  country  produces \nenough  electricity  to  meet  the  annual  domestic  demand  of  about  6.0  billion  kilowatt-hours \n(kWh).  With  a  population  of  3.3  million,  it  has  an  electrification  ratio  of  100%.  It  also  trades \nelectricity  with neighboring countries,  with  exports  of  electricity  exceeding  its  imports.  In  2013, \ntotal electricity output was 7.70 billion kWh. The country exported 1.31 billion kWh, and imported \n0.15  billion  kWh.  Armenia  has  a competitive advantage in electricity  production because of  its \ncheap generation resources and excess capacity, particularly during summer months.5 \n \n5. \nSince  2000,  the  Government  of  Armenia  (the  government)  has  introduced  a  series  of \nenergy  sector  reforms,  which  have  significantly  improved  performance.  The  reforms  involved \nunbundling of the vertically integrated electricity subsector, and privatization of the entire power \nand  gas  distribution  networks  and  most  generation  companies.  The  Ministry  of  Energy  and \nNatural  Resources  (MENR)  is  responsible  for  the  power  subsector,  which  comprises  Electro \nPower  Systems  Operator  (EPSO)  Closed  Joint-Stock  Company,  a  privatized  distribution \ncompany;  the  state-owned  High  Voltage  Electric  Networks  (HVEN)  Closed  Joint-Stock \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Government of Armenia proposed the rehabilitation of four substations: the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nwill  finance  the  rehabilitation of  two  substations,  and  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development is \nexpected  to  finance  and  administer  rehabilitation  of  two  substations  at  Ararat  2  and  Yeghegnadzor  on  a  parallel \nbasis. \n\n3  The  ADB  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  Preparing  the  Power  Transmission  Rehabilitation \n\nProject (TA 8198-ARM). \n\n4  Excluding generation from the nuclear power plant, which is considered a domestic energy source. \n5  Electricity demand in the region is large and growing. Turkey and  the southern regions of the Russian Federation \n\n(bordering Georgia) currently have an electricity deficit that is expected to grow. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nCompany, the state-owned system operator; and more than 50 generation companies, most of \nwhich are privatized. \n \n6. \nKey  challenges.  The  core  problems  in  the  energy  sector  are  the  low  efficiency  of \nenergy  resource  utilization,  and  the  deteriorating  and  aging  power  infrastructure.  These  are \nevidenced  by  the  very  limited  utilization  of  substantial  renewable  energy  resources, 6  low \nefficiency  of  thermal  and  hydropower  plants,  relatively  large  electricity  transmission  and \ngeneration losses, and incomplete realization of electricity export potential. \n \n7. \nMuch of the sector\u2019s infrastructure was built during  the Soviet era and has deteriorated \nsignificantly because of insufficient funding for rehabilitation and maintenance. About 70% of the \ninstalled equipment at power generation plants has been operating for more than 30 years, and \n50%  for  more  than  40  years.  The  average  age  of  power  transmission  assets  including \nsubstations  is  45  years,  and  distribution  assets  32  years.  Much  of  the  existing  transmission \ninfrastructure  has  reached  the  end  of  its  useful  life  and  requires  major  rehabilitation  or \nreplacement  to  continue  reliable  operation.  Nearly  90%  of  220  kV  overhead  lines  require \nrehabilitation, and about 42% of low-voltage substations are in deficient technical condition. \n \n8. \nThe  poor  condition  of  these  assets  leads  to  a  higher  risk  of  system  outages,  high \nmaintenance  costs,  and reduced  production  efficiency. The  inefficiency  of  power  infrastructure \nresults  in  higher  consumption  of  imported  fuels  and  reduced  competitiveness.  If  the  existing \ntransmission  network  fails,  a  large  power  deficit  will  be  incurred  in  populated  areas  with \nconsiderable  social  and  economic  impacts.  Additionally,  a  reliable  transmission  network  with \nmodern equipment is essential to ensure the safe and stable operation of the Armenia Nuclear \nPower Plant (400 MW),7 and to enhance power export to neighboring countries. \n \n9. \nTo  reduce  such  impacts,  substantial  investments  in  power  infrastructure  including \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution are ongoing. Private sector investment focuses on the \nrehabilitation  of  power  generation  plants  and  distribution  networks,  which  are  owned  and \noperated by the private sector. A part of the high-voltage transmission lines and substations has \nbeen  partially  rehabilitated,  and  development  partner  investment  for  high-voltage transmission \nlines  will  continue.8 The  first  stage  of  the  SCADA  system  and  EMS  is  in  place  in  the  control \ncenter.9 The  systems  currently  only  achieve  basic  functions  and  need  to  be  upgraded  and \nexpanded to achieve full functionality and efficiency.10 Investments in substations have not been \nsufficient  given  the  system  rehabilitation  requirements,  thus  limiting  system  operation  and \nreliability.  Expansion  of  the  SCADA  system  and  rehabilitation  of  the  remaining  aging \ntransmission assets are urgently required. \n \n10. \nPriority  areas.  The  government\u2019s  target  is  to  achieve  average  annual  real  gross \ndomestic  product  growth  of  6.5%  through  2025,  and  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  energy \n\n                                                \n6   Namely, the small hydropower plants with capacity of less than 10 MW and the wind-power plant. \n7  The Armenia Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) was built in the 1970s\u20131980s. The government committed to replace the \nexisting capacity of the plant by building a new NPP of about 1,100 MW. As per the government\u2019s plan, a new NPP \ncould be operating by 2021, which means that the existing plant will be retired after completion of the new unit. In \nAugust 2010, the governments of Armenia and the Russian Federation signed an agreement on construction of a \nnew nuclear power unit in Armenia. \n\n8  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  Financed jointly by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation and the World Bank in 1999\u20132004.  \n10 SCADA system hardware should be upgraded and supplemented to support enhanced performance and to provide \nprerequisites for enhanced functionality. Software should be upgraded to the latest release to meet state-of-the-art \nEMS \ninternational  standard \ninter-control-center  communication  capability  based  on \nfunctionality  and \ncommunication protocols. \n\n\f3 \n\n \n\nutilization.11 The  sector\u2019s  development  priority  is  to  upgrade  and  rehabilitate  the  transmission \nnetworks. A reliable and efficient power supply system is an essential precondition for ensuring \nachievement  of  socioeconomic  development  goals.  The  government\u2019s  energy  policy  strongly \nsupports increased energy security and greater energy efficiency. \n \n11. \nAssistance  and  sector  strategy.  The  interim  operational  strategy  for  Armenia  of  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  identified  the  energy  sector  as  a  priority  sector 12 for  ADB \nintervention.13 ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  Armenia  is  expected  to  be  finalized  in \n2014.  ADB  operations  in  the  sector  have  been  based  on  government  priorities,  aligned  with \nADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020,  and  Energy  Policy  2009. 14  They  include  (i) \nrehabilitation of large hydropower generation assets, (ii) rehabilitation of aging transmission and \ndistribution  assets,  (iii)  improvement  of  cross-border  interconnection  of  power  systems,  (iv) \ndevelopment  of  renewable  energy,  and (v)  policy  and institutional  development. The  project  is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2014\u20132016 for Armenia.15 \n \n12. \nThe  project  will  increase  the  efficiency  of  power  system  operation  and  reduce \ntransmission losses, which are essential to improve energy security and reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions.16 Rehabilitation of existing substations will improve the reliability and quality of power \nsupply  to  urban  and  rural  consumers,  reduce  regional  disparities  within  Armenia,  and  support \ninclusive  and  sustainable  economic  development.  An  efficient  and  reliable  power  system  will \nfacilitate the expansion of cross-border power trade in the region. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n13. \nThe  expected  impact  will  be  improved  reliability  and  efficiency  of  power  supply  in \nArmenia.  The  outcome  will  be  increased  operating  efficiency  of  the  domestic  transmission \nnetwork. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n \n\n14. \n\nThe project will have three outputs: \n(i) \n\nExpansion  of  the  Supervision  Control  and  Data  Acquisition  (SCADA) \nsystem  and  Energy  Management  System  (EMS).  This includes installation of \nSCADA  hardware  and  software,  communication  equipment,  and  optical  ground \nwire;  improvement  and  upgrading  of  the  load  dispatch  centers,  and  training  on \nSCADA and the EMS. \nRehabilitation  of  220  kilovolt  substations  in  Agarak  2  and  Shinuhayr. \ninstrument \nReplacement  of  aging  power \ntransformers,  disconnectors,  and  control  and  protection  equipment  with  modern \ntechnology in Agarak 2 and Shinuhayr. \n\ntransformers,  circuit  breakers, \n\n(ii) \n\n                                                \n11 To meet the economic growth targets, electricity demand is expected to grow 2%\u20133% annually in 2015\u20132025. \n12  ADB. 2006.

The turnkey \ncontracts  are  expected  to  be  awarded  during  the  second  quarter  of  2015.  MENR  and  the \nimplementation  consultants  will  prepare  a  detailed  implementation  schedule  during  the \npreconstruction phase of the project and submit it to ADB. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n24. \nExpansion  and  rehabilitation  of  the  SCADA  system,  the  EMS,  and  substation  facilities \nthrough the installation of modern digital control and protection systems will significantly improve \nsystem reliability and security. Rehabilitation of substation facilities not only helps HVEN deliver \npower  reliably  and  safely  to  customers  but  also  reduces  transmission  losses  and  lowers \noperating  costs.  ADB  conducted  technical  due  diligence  on  the  investment  proposal  and  is \nsatisfied with the quality of the cost estimates, operating cost structures, appropriateness of the \ntechnology, and the execution plan. The readiness level is high and the technical solutions are \nassessed to be more cost-effective than the alternatives. Use of the SCADA system and EMS is \nan international standard practice for power system operators based on proven technology and \nis  considered  appropriate  in  this  case.  EPSO  and  HVEN  operation  and maintenance  staff  are \nfamiliar with the proposed design concepts. EPSO and HVEN have sufficient technical capacity \nand experienced staff to undertake project implementation. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n25. \nRehabilitation  of  the  substations  and  expansion  of  the  SCADA  system  and  EMS  are \nexpected to increase the reliability of the transmission system thereby ensuring energy security. \nThe  project  adopts  a  least-cost  approach  to  resolve  the  issue  of  aging  transmission \ninfrastructure  and  envisaged  increase  in  system  outages  and  shutdowns.  The  project  is  both \nfinancially and economically viable. \n\n\f7 \n\n \n\nThe  incremental  benefits  arising  from  the  project  include  the  avoidance  of  energy-flow \n26. \ninterruption  through  the substations.  The  without-project  scenario assumes that the  number of \noutages  and  shutdowns  will  increase  as  the  equipment  ages  and  is  eventually  beyond  repair. \nAlso, as the substations are part of the overall transmission network, a system approach takes \ninto  account  the  potential  impact  of  outages  and/or  stoppage  of  operation  of  other  overused \nsystem assets on the energy flow. To value the project benefits, the current transmission tariff of \nAMD1.28/kWh  and  operator  tariff  of  AMD0.23/kWh  were  considered,  and  the  projected  tariff \nwas  estimated  based  on  projected  operation  of  business  and  servicing  of  existing  and  new \nloans  for  investment  projects.  Incremental  operation  and  maintenance  cost  is  assumed  to  be \n2% of the total capital cost. The financial internal rate of return for the substations rehabilitation \ncomponent  of  the  project,  which  is  to  be  carried  out  by  HVEN,  is  estimated  to  be  12.8%, \nexceeding the weighted average cost of capital of 3.0%. The SCADA system and EMS upgrade \ncomponent  is  expected  to  enhance  overall  system  control  and  improve  efficiency.  A  tariff \nincrease, following the application to the regulator, is expected to cover the investment cost and \nloan repayment. An incremental recurring cost sustainability assessment found this part of the \nproject, which is to be implemented by EPSO, financially viable with a financial internal rate of \nreturn of 3.6%, exceeding the weighted average cost of capital of 2.1%. \n \n27. \nThe  economic  analysis  provides  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  18.3%,  which \ncompares  favorably  with  the  benchmark  rate  of  12.0%  for  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of \ncapital.  The  project\u2019s  assessed  economic  viability  is  based  on  expected  streams  of  benefits \narising from avoided interruption of energy flow and incremental costs resulting from the project \nover 25 years. Benefits arising from the steady delivery of electricity and avoided outages were \ncalculated  based  on  the  cost  of  unserved  energy  at  $0.02/kWh  as  a  conservative  measure. \nEnvironmental mitigation costs, as part of the investment costs, were considered. No additional \nland  will  be  required  as  the  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  will  be  conducted  in  the  existing \nsubstations and load center. \n \n28. \nrobustness even under unfavorable circumstances. \n \nC. \n\nThe sensitivity analysis supports the project economic and financial viability, and shows \n\nGovernance \n\n29. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  MENR,  EPSO,  and  HVEN.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 18). \n \n30. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  of  EPSO  and  HVEN  assessed  the  institutional \nsetup  of  the  companies  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines. 21  It  established  that  both \ncompanies  have  adequate  financial  management  arrangements  in  place  to  process  and \nimplement  the  project.  Both  EPSO  and  HVEN  have  experience  in  implementing  aid-financed \ninfrastructure projects22 and have undergone capacity-building programs associated with those \nprojects on project account management, financial reporting, and internal control. \n \nThe  procurement  capacity  of  EPSO  and  HVEN  is  assessed  to  be  low.  The  inherent \n31. \nprocurement  risks  are  high  due  to  the  contract  value  and  technical  complexity.  However,  this \n\n                                                \n21  ADB. 2005. Guidelines on Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n22 These development partners include EBRD, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, German development \ncooperation through KfW, the United States Agency for International Development, and the World Bank. Refer to \nDevelopment Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nrisk  can  be  mitigated  to  average,  with  the  support  of  project  implementation  consultants  and \nclose coordination and guidance provided by ADB. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n32. \nBy increasing the supply of efficient and reliable electricity to the system, the project will \nincrease  the  reliability  of  the  power  supply  nationwide,  benefiting  the  poor  and  neglected \nregions.  Since  the  rural  poor  are  the  first  to  be  cut  off  from  supply  during  winter  power \nshortages, system loss reduction and stronger supply reliability will particularly benefit the poor \nand  the  socially  excluded.  The  project  will  enhance  regional  power  trade  with  neighboring \ncountries, which will stimulate economic growth and increase employment opportunities. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n33. \nEnvironmental assessment. The project is categorized B for environment under ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  An  initial  environmental  examination  was  prepared, \nincluding two separate environmental management plans (one each for EPSO and HVEN). The \ninitial environmental examination was disclosed on 14 May 2014 as per ADB public disclosure \nrequirements.23 EPSO  and  HVEN  have staff responsible  for  safety  but  will  be  assisted  by  and \nreceive on-the-job environmental training from the project implementation consultants. The ADB \nloan will cover the cost of implementing the environmental management plans. \n \n34. \nThe  project\u2019s  main  environmental  impacts  would  occur  mainly  during  construction  as  a \nresult  of  waste  generated  during  equipment  replacement  and  construction  for  earth-wire \nreplacement. The  issues  will  be  related to  (i) management  of the  used  oil  and grease  wastes, \nincluding  identification  and  special  disposal  of  polychlorinated  biphenyls  containing  oils;  \n(ii)  disposal  of  scrap  metal,  old  batteries,  and  other  solid  wastes;  (iii)  occupational  health  and \nsafety measures at the project sites; (iv) proper handling and monitoring of sulfur hexafluoride \ncircuit breakers; and (v) limited air and noise pollution, as well as tree cutting within the rights-of-\nway.  Potential  negative  environmental  impacts  during  operation  include  sulfur  hexafluoride \nleakage  and  electromagnetic  fields.  The  Environmental  Management  Plan  specifies  adequate \nmitigation  measures  and  monitoring  plans  to  cover  these  impacts.  Adequate  storage  facilities \nwill be constructed at each substation for safe temporary storage of released oils and batteries. \nNonpolychlorinated biphenyl oils will be refined for on-site reuse by a licensed company. \n\n35. \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  project  will  have  no  land  acquisition  issues,  as \nrehabilitation works  will  be  limited  to the  substation.  The  project  is  therefore  categorized  C for \ninvoluntary resettlement under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \n36. \nIndigenous  peoples.  The project is categorized C for indigenous peoples. The project \nis  not  expected  to  affect  indigenous  peoples  as  defined  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009). \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n37. \nThe  project  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs.  The \ngovernment fully supports the project. MENR will coordinate the work of government agencies \n                                                \n23 Efforts  were  made  to  collaborate  with  EBRD  to  meet  ADB\u2019s  and  EBRD\u2019s  safeguard  requirements.  That  includes \nsharing with EBRD the original initial environmental examination prepared to cover all proposed substations, and a \nletter  exchange  with  EBRD  explaining  how  ADB\u2019s  and  EBRD\u2019s  responsibilities  for  safeguard  preparation  and \nimplementation are allocated. \n\n\f9 \n\n \n\nto  ensure  that  issues,  if  any,  are  resolved  promptly,  and  that  technologies  adopted  under  the \nproject conform to international standards and best practices that are commercially proven and \nwidely  used  internationally.  EPSO  and  HVEN  have  accumulated  substantial  experience  in \nmanaging projects in cooperation with international financial institutions. However, each agency \nremains  resource-constrained  and  its  ability  to  manage  multiple  large  projects  is  uncertain \nwithout  the  support  of  external  international  expertise.  Risks  were  analyzed  and  deemed \nacceptable  or  mitigated.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and \ndescribed in the risk assessment and risk management plan.24  \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nEPSO and HVEN have weak financial \nmanagement capacity      \n\nMitigating Measures \nSeparate accounting will be established and maintained for the project \nin order to minimize risk.  \n \nProject supervision consultants will be recruited to assist EPSO and \nHVEN in supervising the project implementation, recording project \ncosts, preparing withdrawal applications and progress reports. Staff \ntraining will be provided to retain institutional knowledge. \n \nLoan and project agreements require financial statements and project \naccounts to be audited in accordance with international standards of \nauditing by an auditor acceptable to ADB. \nInternational consultants will undertake project design, bidding \npreparation support, and evaluation. Project supervision consultants \nwill be recruited to help EPSO and HVEN with project implementation \nand management. \nProcurement is at an advanced stage so delay risks are minimized. \n\nJointly with other development partners, ADB will continue policy \ndialogue with the government to ensure strong commitment to energy \nsector development. \n \nThe government has adopted the Armenia Development Strategy \n2025, which addresses physical and nonphysical investments. The \ngovernment has committed to keep ADB informed of policy reforms \nincluding tariff methodologies and implementation progress of its \ninvestment plan. \nThe present cost-plus-tariff methodology addresses immediate term \nneeds and existing conditions in Armenia. The tariff regime allows \nEPSO and HVEN to apply to the independent tariff regulator\u2014the \nArmenia Public Services Regulatory Commission\u2014to review the tariff \nmethodology periodically. However, tariffs do not cover the full cost of \nservice delivery. Through policy dialogue and analytical work, ADB will \ncontinue to encourage the government to raise tariffs to full cost-\nrecovery. \n\nEPSO and HVEN have limited project \nmanagement capacity and lack \nexperience with turnkey contract \nmanagement \nUnexpected delays for procurement due \nto governmental approvals \nThe government is unable to address \nthe targets of the sector development \nplan \n\nCash flow from EPSO and HVEN \noperations is unsustainable to cover \ncapital expenditure, debt obligations, \nand operation and maintenance costs \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, EPSO = Electro Power Systems Operator, HVEN = High Voltage Electric Networks. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nThe  government,  EPSO,  and  HVEN  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the \n38. \nproject  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n\n                                                \n24 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe government, EPSO, and HVEN have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \n\n39. \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \n \n40. \nNotwithstanding  any  other  provision  in  the  loan  agreement,  no  withdrawals  shall  be \nmade  from  the  loan  agreement  until  ADB  has  received  the  relending  agreements  executed \nbetween the government, EPSO, and HVEN. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n41. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove the loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR24,022,000 to Armenia for the Power \nTransmission  Rehabilitation  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with  an  interest \ncharge at the rate of 2.0% per annum during the grace period and thereafter; for a term of 25 \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \n \n \n\n \n\nBindu Lohani \nVice-President \n\n8 July 2014 \n \n \n\n\f                \n\n \n\n      Appendix 1             11 \n\n    \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n \nEPSO and HVEN annual \nreports \n \nNational statistics on per \ncapita power consumption \nand annual electricity \nsupply published by the \nMinistry of Energy and \nNatural Resources \n \n\nEPSO and HVEN project \ncompletion reports \n\n \n\nAssumptions and \nRisks  \n\nAssumption \nGovernment policy will \ncontinue to support \nenergy infrastructure \nmodernization. \n \nRisk \nLimited financial support \nmay delay the expansion \nof power generation and \ndistribution assets. \n\n \nEPSO and HVEN annual \nreports \n \nEPSO and HVEN project \ncompletion reports \n\nAssumption \nTimely implementation of \ntransmission \nrehabilitation projects \nfinanced by other \nfinanciers \n\nAssumption \nAccess to competent \ncontractors and high-\nquality equipment and \nmaterial \n\n \nEPSO and HVEN annual \nreports \n \nEPSO and HVEN records \nof commissioning \n \nEPSO and HVEN annual \nreports \n \nEPSO and HVEN records \nof commissioning \n \n\nEPSO and HVEN project \ncompletion reports \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \nImproved reliability and \nefficiency of power \nsupply in Armenia \n\nOutcome \nIncreased operating \nefficiency of the \ndomestic transmission \nnetwork \n\nOutputs \n1.
