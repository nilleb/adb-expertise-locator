THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan and (ii) the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Urban Climate Change \nResilience Trust Fund (UCCRTF)1 under the Urban Financing Partnership Facility (UFPF), both \nto  the  Republic  of  the  Union  of  Myanmar  for  the  Mandalay  Urban  Services  Improvement \nProject.2 \n \n2.  The project will help Mandalay further grow as the cultural, educational, and economic \nhub  of  Upper  Myanmar  and  act  as  a  national  economic  center. This  approach  will  foster \nbalanced  national  development  by  reducing  the  concentration  of  population  and  economic \nactivities in Yangon and promoting economic growth in Mandalay Region and its surroundings.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Urban sector context. Although 70% of Myanmar\u2019s population resides in rural areas, \nthe urban population has grown 2.3% per year, faster than the country\u2019s total population (1.8% \nper year). The urban population in Myanmar increased from 14.6 million or 29% of the total \npopulation in 2000 to 18.4 million or 31% of the total population in 2010. Currently, 10% of \nMyanmar\u2019s population lives in two major cities, Yangon and Mandalay, contributing to 30% of \ngross domestic product (GDP), and this share is expected to rise rapidly. It is estimated that by \n2030, 25% of Myanmar\u2019s population will live in urban areas, accounting for roughly 50% of \nMyanmar\u2019s GDP.4 Once ongoing and planned tax reform in Myanmar result in a functioning tax \nregime, the majority of tax revenue will also likely come from cities. However, to ensure that \nurbanization will be a driving force for economic growth and social development, urban planning \nand management need to be modernized and investments in urban infrastructure need to be \nincreased. \n \n4.  Climate  change  impacts.  Myanmar  was  considered  to  be  the  second-hardest  hit \ncountry (after Honduras) by climate-change-related extreme weather events during 1991\u20132010; \nits  overall  climate  change  vulnerability  factor  up  to  2030  is  classified  as  \u201cacute.\u201d5 The \ngovernment\u2019s records confirm this trend in Mandalay Region, reflected in shorter monsoon \nperiods, longer premonsoon droughts, and higher daily rainfall depths: the four highest peak \nannual  daily  rainfall  depths  during  1949\u20132013  were  recorded  after  2003.  These  changing \nclimatic conditions, in tandem with the expanding urban area, are increasing the demand for \nreliable  water  resources,  wastewater  collection  and  treatment,  and  urban  drainage \nimprovements. \n \n5.  Mandalay city profile and issues in urban services delivery.6 Mandalay city, with a \npopulation of about 1.25 million, is the country\u2019s second-largest city and the capital of Mandalay \n                                                \n1  Financing partners: the Rockefeller Foundation and the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States. \nFor the purpose of the Mandalay Urban Services Improvement Project, only financing from the Government of the \nUnited Kingdom will be utilized. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for Preparing the Mandalay \nUrban Services Improvement Project (TA 8472-MYA). \n4  H. Chhor et al. 2013. Myanmar's moment: Unique opportunities, major challenges. McKinsey Global Institute.  \n5  Germanwatch. 2014. Global Climate Risk Index 2015. Bonn. \n6  Sector Assessment (Summary): Water and Other Urban Infrastructure and Services (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "2 \nRegion. The city\u2019s population is about 2% of the national population and its contribution to GDP \nis approximately 8%. It is located in the Greater Mekong Subregion Northern Economic Corridor \nlinking the People\u2019s Republic of China and India. The Mandalay Regional Government (MRG) \ndoes  not  directly  intervene  in  urban  management  matters  in  Mandalay  City,  but  it  has  a \nsignificant role in approving infrastructure projects and urban service tariffs. The Mandalay City \nDevelopment  Committee  (MCDC)  is  tasked  with  urban  service  delivery  and  infrastructure \ndevelopment. However, it does not effectively carry out its responsibilities because it lacks staff, \nskills, funds, and data. The piped-water supply system serves only 55% of the city population \nand only for 10 hours per day on average. The remaining residents use mainly private shallow \nwells.  Nonrevenue  water  is  estimated  at  52%.  Neither  a  piped  sewerage  system  nor  a \ncentralized  wastewater treatment  plant  exists. Sanitation  provision  consists  of  septic  tanks \ndraining largely into the roadside drains and of latrines of varying designs. Although Mandalay is \nlocated in the heart of the Central Dry Zone, rainstorms can be very intense during the wet \nseason. Seasonal floods are caused mainly by a lack of maintenance of canals and storage \nponds, and insufficient capacities of the existing pumping stations. Although MCDC collects \nabout 780 tons of domestic solid waste per day, large amounts are disposed in the drains and \ncanals. Primary collection uses the bell system and the waste is transported to the final disposal \nsites via transit stations.7 \n \n6.  Strategic alignment. The project is in line with the government\u2019s proposed National \nComprehensive  Development  Plan,  2016\u20132021,  which  designates  Mandalay  as  a  bipolar \ndevelopment  center  to  act  as  a  national  economic  center  that  would  counterbalance  the \nattraction of Yangon and distribute economic growth to Mandalay Region and its surroundings. 8 \nThe project is also in line with the interim country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132014 of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth in support of \nthe government\u2019s objectives of poverty reduction and national reconciliation.9 Tackling urban \nenvironmental problems resulting from rapid urbanization through investment in water supply, \nsanitation, and waste management is one of the core areas of ADB operation identified in its \nStrategy 2020.10 The project is in line with the guiding purpose of ADB\u2019s urban operational plan, \n2012\u20132020,  which  is  to  catalyze  a  new  form  of  climate-friendly  and  resilient,  inclusive, \ncompetitive, and environmentally sustainable urban development.11 The approach focuses on \nimproving  urban  systems,  making  them  financially  sustainable,  and  maximizing  the  urban \ncontribution to such development. \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s sector experience. The water supply projects in Yangon, approved in 1973,12 \nand in Mandalay, approved in 1982,13 achieved their objectives. The project completion report \nfor  Mandalay  recommended  to  reduce  the  number  of  contracts  and  to  examine  the \nappropriateness  of  entrusting  the  civil  works  to  a  parastatal  organization  because  a  large \nnumber of procurement packages (49 contracts) and civil works carried out by force account \n                                                \n7  Primary waste collector rings bell and waits at specified locations for residents to bring waste. \n8  Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development. 2015.

Thorough project preparation and coordination. Before the project preparatory TA \nstarted, a small team of consultants was engaged under a capacity development TA to conduct \na scoping study for a strategic development plan for Mandalay.18 Its outcome provided valuable \ninformation for project preparation. Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) expressed its \ninterest  in  parallel  financing  for  the  project  at  an  early  stage  of  project  preparation  and \ncofinanced the project preparatory TA. This arrangement enabled close coordination between \nADB and AFD as well as effective joint policy dialogue with the government throughout project \npreparation. Coordination with the European Union through AFD resulted in grant cofinancing \nfrom the European Union. A consulting firm mobilized under aid from the Government of France \nfor the private sector, in parallel with ADB\u2019s project preparatory TA, provided technical inputs on \nwater supply, solid waste management, and urban transport that have been fully incorporated in \nthe project design. ADB has also closely coordinated with grant projects for water supply in \nMandalay being proposed by AFD and the Japan International Cooperation Agency to avoid \noverlap and ensure complementarity. \n \n9.  Special  features.  The  project  integrates  a  biogas-generating  system  with  sludge \nstabilization as part of the wastewater treatment plant. Biogas generated in the sludge-digesting \nprocess will be used to produce electricity, which will power the wastewater treatment plant. The \nwastewater treatment plant is expected to be carbon-neutral and at least 50% energy self-\nsufficient. Sludge from the digester will be stabilized for potential reuse in agriculture and/or \nmaterial reuse in cement works. Training will be conducted for MCDC to ensure effective \noperation of this system. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact will be improved urban environment and public health in Mandalay. The \noutcome will be improved access to sustainable urban services in Mandalay. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  Outputs of the project are (i) improved water supply systems, (ii) improved wastewater \nand drainage management, and (iii) strengthened capacity for urban services management. The \ndetails are summarized below. Output 1 will build a new water treatment plant, rehabilitate the \nexisting water supply networks, and extend the networks to new urban areas. A comprehensive \nnonrevenue water reduction program will be implemented including the rehabilitation of pipes, \n                                                \n14 ADB. 1991.

Output 2 \nwill provide the first centralized wastewater collection and treatment system in Mandalay. The \nwater quality of major creeks and canals will be improved through reducing direct discharge of \nwastewater to receiving waters; and enhancing septage removal, treatment, and disposal. A \nsubstantial amount of funds have been allocated to implement output 3 considering that the \nproject will be the first major externally financed project for Mandalay since the ADB\u2019s previous \nwater supply project (footnote 13). Output 3 will cover the project implementation support, \ncapacity development for the MRG and MCDC in urban services management, and awareness \nprograms for the residents on health and environment. \n \nD.

Interest during construction for the Asian Development Bank loan is 1% per year and will be \ncapitalized. There are no commitment charges. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n13.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR42,547,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project. The loan will \nhave a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as \nset forth in the draft loan, grant, and project agreements.19 The UCCRTF (footnote 1) under the \nUFPF will provide grant cofinancing equivalent to $4 million, to be administered in parallel by \nADB.20 Parallel financing is proposed for a \u20ac40.0 million loan from AFD and a \u20ac5.9 million grant \nfrom the European Union\u2019s Asian Investment Facility administered by AFD. The financing plan \nis in Table 2. \n \n                                                \n19 The loan will include financing charges during implementation. Local transportation and insurance charges may be \nfinanced under the loan and grant. \n20 In case that the government is unable to finance taxes and duties, ADB loan can finance taxes and duties given \nthat the amount financed (i) is within the threshold identified in the interim country partnership strategy, (ii) does not \nrepresent an excessive share of the project investment plan, (iii) applies only to ADB-financed expenditures, and \n(iv) is material and/or relevant to the success of the project. \n ", "          5 \n14.  The Government of the United Kingdom agreed to provide the $4 million grant through \nthe UCCRTF (footnote 1) under the UFPF to be used exclusively for the project and such \nallocation constitutes an additional condition permitting the earmarking of that grant for the \nproject. While the loan received Parliament approval, due to unforeseen circumstances, the \ngrant has not yet received formal approval from the government. The first ADB project for \nMyanmar financed by a combination of a loan and grant, synchronizing approvals for the loan \nand the grant presented a challenge. However, the process for government approval of the \ngrant has been initiated, and it is expected that such approval will be provided before the end of \n2015.  The  project\u2019s  design  and  implementation  arrangements  include  the  grant  on  the \nassumption that such approval will be received. \n \n15.  The borrower will be the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, which will relend the loan \nproceeds to MCDC. Relending will carry the same terms and conditions as the ADB and AFD \nloans, including the foreign exchange and interest rate variation risks.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  MRG will be the executing agency and MCDC will be the implementing agency. MRG \nwill be responsible for major decision making in relation to project implementation. MCDC will \ncoordinate and monitor the project activities of the project management office (PMO). The PMO \nwill be established under MCDC to undertake day-to-day project implementation activities. The \nproject implementation and coordination committee led by the chief minister of MRG will be \nresponsible for providing policy guidance, coordination with relevant ministries at the central \nlevel,  and  interdepartmental  coordination  at  MRG  and  MCDC.  The  implementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the project administration \nmanual (PAM).21 \n \n17.  To  strengthen  project  readiness,  a  project  management  team  has  already  been \nestablished under MCDC to undertake preparatory activities. It will be upgraded to a PMO upon \ngovernment approval of the project. The project preparatory TA was extended with additional \n                                                \n21 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nfunds from AFD to conduct surveys and prepare technical specifications for the new wastewater \ntreatment plant, and to engage a financial management specialist to provide training and help \nestablish the project accounting system. MCDC requested ADB\u2019s assistance in selecting the \nproject implementation support consultant so as to expedite its mobilization.22 Since the project \nis financed with ADB-administered cofinancing resources as well as Asian Development Fund \nresources, universal procurement will apply to all contract packages under the project.23 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  April 2016\u2013March 2023 \nEstimated completion date  31 March 2023 (estimated loan closing date: 30 September 2023) \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  The project implementation and coordination committee will be chaired by \nthe chief minister, MRG.

Accordingly, goods and works, and consulting services to be financed and \nadministered by ADB under the project will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as \namended from time to time) and ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \nSource: ADB. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n18.  Since  reliable  population  data  and  projections  were  not  available  when  project \npreparation started, a methodology for population projections was developed using assumptions \non population densities and speed of new development by ward. MCDC will be able to monitor \nand adjust both assumptions over time. Alternative technical options were analyzed for each \nproject facility, and the optimum design solutions were identified. In reviewing the alternatives, \nconsideration was given to improvement of the overall efficiency of capital investment and \noperational expenditure, and to reduction of negative social and environmental impacts.

The economic analysis assesses the economic viability of the \nproject through standard cost\u2013benefit analysis.24 Conducted for each output as well as for the \noverall project, the analysis confirms the economic viability. Since most of the project benefits \ncannot be valued within traditional markets, they are assessed in terms of willingness to pay for \nthe improved services. Average incremental willingness to pay compared with existing amounts \nis estimated at (i) MK50,820 per household per year for improved water supply, (ii) MK129,500 \nper household per year for piped-water connections, (iii) MK39,000 per household per cleaning \nfor  improved  septage  services,  and  (iv)  MK48,360  per  household  per  year  for  improved \nwastewater and drainage services. The economic internal rate of return was estimated at 20.2% \nfor the improved water supply (with an economic net present value of MK38.4 billion), at 23.4% \nfor improved wastewater and drainage management (net present value: MK48.1 billion), and \n19.9% for the overall project (MK 76.8 billion). Sensitivity tests indicated that each output and \nthe  overall  project  are  highly  robust:  a  10%  cost  increase  combined  with  a  10%  benefit \ndecrease would reduce the economic internal rate of return of the overall project to 17%. \n \n20.  Financial analysis.25 The proceeds of the loans from ADB and the Asian Development \nFund will be relent via the Ministry of Finance to MCDC in US dollars, and at the same terms as \nADB and AFD loans. MCDC did not need any financial transfers from the central government \nduring  the  last  fiscal  years,  as  revenues  from  toll  fees,  rentals,  taxes,  tariffs,  and  land \ndevelopment  were  sufficient  to  cover  expenses,  although  MCDC  did  underspend  on  the \noperation and maintenance of urban infrastructure. A fiscal analysis and evaluation of MCDC, a \ngovernment  agency,  was  undertaken  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Management,  Cost \nEstimates, Financial Analysis and Financial Performance Indicators to assess its capacity to \nservice all incremental recurrent costs related to the project (i.e., debt service on the ADB and \nAFD loans, and operation and maintenance costs).26 To ensure MCDC\u2019s financial sustainability, \nMCDC, MRG, and the government will have to take measures to increase MCDC\u2019s current \nrevenues;  for  example,  through  water  and  wastewater  tariff  increases,  and  updates  and \nincreases of the rental value of properties to generate more housing and lighting tax revenues, \nand implement tight operating cost controls. The fiscal analysis assumes that MCDC, MRG, and \nthe government will make sure that MCDC has sufficient funds to cover operating expenses and \ndebt  service  by  jointly  undertaking to  balance  MCDC\u2019s  budget through  increased financial \nsupport  to  MCDC;  for  example,  additional  transfers  from  the  MRG  and/or  the  central \ngovernment, as required. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n21.  The risk  rating for financial  management  is  high. The  public financial  management \nsystems in Myanmar are relatively weak  because of limited exposure to international best \npractices and low capacity and computerization. The major risks are (i) limited capacity of \nMCDC staff to (a) conduct project financial management, (b) prepare financial management \nreports, and (c) implement an internal audit; and (ii) weak financial management systems and \n                                                \n24 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Financial analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 ADB. 2014. Financial Management, Cost Estimates, Financial Analysis, and Financial Performance Indicators. \nOperations Manual. OM G2. Manila. \n ", "8 \ncontrols,  including  the  current  internal  audit  setup,  which  does  not  provide  the  requisite \nindependence. This poses significant constraints for development effectiveness in Myanmar. \nThe proposed risk mitigation measures involve capacity development through the engagement \nof international and national accounting and financial management consultants to (i) provide \ntraining,  including  on-the-job-training,  for  the  PMO  on  ADB\u2019s  disbursement  policies  and \nprocedures, and international best practices; and (ii) improve project budgeting and accounting \nsystems,  including  computerization  of  the  accounting  system.  Although  the  executing  and \nimplementing  agencies  do  not  have  recent  experience  in  implementing  externally  funded \nprojects, two key staff at MCDC and the PMO participated in the implementation of a previous \nADB-financed project. To mitigate procurement risks, (i) the number of contracts has been \nreduced  to  a  minimum;  (ii)  MCDC  has  requested  ADB  to  assist  in  selecting  the  project \nimplementation support consultant, provided that MCDC will negotiate and sign the consulting \nservice contract; and (iii) ample training on ADB\u2019s procurement requirements will be conducted \nunder the project. \n \n22.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, MRG, and MCDC. Relevant policy sections will be included in all project \ndocuments and contracts relating to procurement. The policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 21). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n23.  The project will cover all poor and vulnerable households in the project area, including \nhouseholds  headed  by women,  with  individual  water  connections  and improved  sanitation, \nwhich is anticipated to yield health and economic benefits. The framework for inclusion of the \npoor and vulnerable will ensure that targeted coverage of all poor and vulnerable households is \npart of the gender equality and social inclusion action plan.27 The project is categorized as \neffective gender mainstreaming. The water connection subsidy will ensure affordability and \naccess to better service, while a lifeline tariff subsidy for water supply and wastewater will \nensure  continuous  affordability  of  user  charges  by  poor  households.  Participation  of  the \ncommunity, especially of women and those from socially excluded groups, is elicited by raising \nawareness of the project. The stakeholder strategy and participation plan for the project will \nmaximize the participation of stakeholders, particularly women, the poor, and vulnerable groups. \nA gender equality and social inclusion action plan will ensure that gender equality and social \ninclusion are implemented and monitored at regular intervals. Data, disaggregated by sex and \nsocial and economic background, will be collected within 1 year of the regular intervals to help \nestablish baseline figures to track social and gender equality results as the project progresses. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n24.  Environment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination was prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and \nthe applicable environment regulations of the government.28 The project is not expected to \ncause irreversible adverse environmental impacts. Mitigation measures for identified impacts \nare included in the environmental management plan (EMP). In addition, potential impacts of \nclimate change and natural hazards (mainly floods and earthquakes) are recommended for \nintegration into the detailed engineering design in terms of location and structure of the facilities. \nAt the detailed engineering design stage, the EMP will be updated and finalized. The final EMP, \n                                                \n27 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "          9 \ncleared by ADB, will form part of the contract bidding documents. Effective environmental \nmonitoring at all stages of subproject implementation will be ensured. In compliance with ADB\u2019s \ninformation disclosure and consultation requirements, the safeguard documents will be posted \non ADB\u2019s website. \n \n25.  Involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B.  The  proposed \nacquisition  of  5.253  hectares  of  land  for  the  wastewater  treatment  plant  will  affect \n17 households (58 persons), including 8 landowners, 3 tenants, and 6 seasonal workers. A \nresettlement  plan  was  prepared  and  includes a  review  of  local  laws  and  regulations, gap \nanalysis, and proposed gap-filling measures.29 The resettlement plan is in compliance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and takes into consideration provisions of local laws and \nregulations. The resettlement plan includes an internal and external monitoring framework. \nConsultations with the affected households were conducted during project preparation and will \ncontinue throughout resettlement planning and implementation. The project information booklet \nwill be distributed and a grievance redress mechanism will be established. Effective internal and \nexternal  monitoring  at  all  stages  of  subproject  implementation  will  be  ensured.  MCDC  is \ncommitted to implementing the resettlement plan and allocating sufficient counterpart funds for \nland acquisition. Capacity development of MCDC for social safeguards was conducted during \nproject preparation and will continue during project implementation. The resettlement plan will \nbe updated at the detailed engineering stage and cleared by ADB. In compliance with ADB\u2019s \ninformation disclosure and consultation requirements, the safeguard documents will be posted \non ADB\u2019s website. \n \n26.  Indigenous peoples. The safeguard category for indigenous peoples is C. Some 96.4% \nof the city population is Barmar by ethnicity. However, no communities of ethnic minorities or \ngroups live separately in the urban area. As the project will benefit all residents in the project \narea equally, no adverse impact on indigenous peoples is anticipated. In accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement, no separate indigenous peoples plan is required. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n27.  The project is categorized as high risk because of (i) the limited capacity of the executing \nand implementing agencies for administering externally funded projects, and (ii) ADB\u2019s limited recent \nexperience in the country. However, the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the \ncosts. Major risks and mitigation measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.30 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nPMO staff do not have sufficient  Consultant will be engaged to support project implementation \nknowledge and experience in  and train PMO staff on ADB\u2019s requirements and procedures for \nimplementation of externally funded  procurement, funds disbursement (including use of imprest fund \nprojects, thus risks for financial  and state of expenditure procedures), and financial \nmanagement and procurement are  management procedures. \nrated high.  The number of procurement packages has been minimized. \nMCDC revenue is insufficient to cover  MRG and MCDC will ensure that MCDC secures in a timely \noperation and maintenance of project  manner a subsidy, fiscal transfer, or any other financial support \nfacilities and repay loans.  from MRG or the Government of Myanmar to cover the shortfall. \n                                                \n29 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInadequate subsidies are provided to  Consultant will assist MRG and MCDC in estimating shortfalls \nmeet shortfall in water supply and  during construction to allow them to allocate sufficient budget \nwastewater revenues.  for operation and maintenance. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, MCDC = Mandalay City Development Committee, MRG = Mandalay Regional \nGovernment, PMO = project management office. \nSource: ADB. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n28.
