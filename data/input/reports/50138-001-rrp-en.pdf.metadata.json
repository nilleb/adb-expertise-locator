Project Identification and Description \n \n2. \nProject identification. Sri Lanka is an island nation with 1,340 kilometers of coastline. \nIt  is strategically located in the center of the Indian Ocean, near the main east\u2013west international \nmaritime trade route connecting the People\u2019s Republic of China and East Asia to Europe, Africa, \nand the Middle East. More than 60,000 ships travel this route annually, carrying two-thirds of the \nworld\u2019s oil and half of all container shipments.1 The Government of Sri Lanka\u2019s 2008\u20132010 and \n2010\u20132014  port  development  plans  call  for  liberalization  and  strengthening  of  the  rules  and \nregulations  to  promote  the  country\u2019s  shipping  and  maritime  businesses.  A  7-year  port \ndevelopment plan is  being prepared and will be completed by 2020. By that time Sri Lanka is \nexpected  to  handle  200 million  tons  in  deadweight  tonnage  capacity  and  achieve  $1  billion  in \nrevenue  from  the  port  industry  annually,  which  may  require  up  to  $10  billion  in  incremental \ninvestment.2 Significant investment in ports and shipping-related infrastructure has resulted in the \ngrowth of support industries, such as ship repair. However, the current capacity for ship repairs \nhas not kept  pace with the  investment in  port and shipping capacity. Colombo Dockyard PLC \nis  the  only  operational  shipyard  in  Sri  Lanka  that  performs  work  of  international  quality  with \ncapacity,  but it focuses primarily on building new ships.  \n \nMTD Walkers  PLC,  established  in  1854,  is  one  of  Sri Lanka\u2019s  leading conglomerates \n3. \ninterests  in  engineering,  construction,  and  infrastructure.  (Confidential  information \nwith \nredacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy). MTD Walkers\u2019  ship  repair \nbusiness  will  be  undertaken in the three locations through its wholly owned subsidiary Walkers \nShipyards Limited  (WSL), which is in the final stages of being incorporated to manage all of MTD \nWalkers\u2019 maritime-related businesses. \n \n(Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy). \n \n4. \nSponsor and borrower. WSL will be the sponsor, while WCS will implement the project \nand be the borrower of the ADB loan. (Confidential  information  redacted  under  para.  97(v)  of \nADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy). \n  \n5. \nSponsor\u2019s  parent  company.  Once  established,  WSL  will  be  wholly  owned  by  MTD \nWalkers, Sri Lanka\u2019s 46th-largest company in terms of turnover (2015).1 It has a track record in \nSri  Lanka  in  (i)  civil,  mechanical,  and  electrical  engineering;  (ii)  pile  construction;  (iii)  power \ngeneration;  and (iv) real estate development services.  MTD Walkers\u2019 largest  subsidiary,  CML- \nMTD Construction Ltd. (CML), was involved in the construction of several ADB-funded projects in \nSri  Lanka.2  MTD  Walkers  is  publicly  listed  on  the  Colombo  Stock  Exchange  with  a  market \ncapitalization  as  of  28  August  2017  of  SLRs5.5  billion.

The successful implementation of the project will help develop Sri Lanka into \na  competitive  hub  for  maritime  activities  in  South  Asia.  The  proposed  financing  will  help \nincrease  jobs in fisheries and related industries, and improve the socioeconomic status of the \ncountry\u2019s  fishing community. Furthermore, improvements in fishing vessel repairs are expected \nto increase  national  fisheries  production  and  benefit  the  nutritional  status  and  food  security \nof  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  population. \n \n7. \nOutcome. The outcome will be improved operations of the local marine industry. For \nthe  Colombo  yard,  the  outcome  indicators  will  be  the  number  of  small  and  medium-sized \nfishing  vessels with access to ship repairs and the number of merchant vessels up to  70 meters \nlong with access to ship repairs by 2020. During operations, the  project is expected to provide \nat least 100 jobs by 2020. \n \nOutputs.  The  outputs  will  be  (i)  small  vessel  repair  capacity  commissioned,  (ii) \n8. \nlocal  employment  generated,  and  (iii)  growth  of  the  local  economy  supported.  The  output \nindicators will be the number of piers with shiplift and transfer system capacity commissioned in \nthe Colombo  yard  by  2019.  The  project  will  ensure  that  environment  and  safeguards \nstandards  are  well  maintained and fully met. WCS\u2019s expansion will lead to direct jobs during \nconstruction. \n \nC. \n \n9. \nConsistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nthe Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, which includes a focus on private sector development and \noperations, as well as infrastructure development.8  ADB\u2019s support for the project is in line with its \ncountry partnership strategy for Sri Lanka, 2018\u20132022 and upholds two key aspects of the first \npillar  for  ADB\u2019s  focus  areas:  expanding  the  provision  of  growth-orientated  infrastructure  and \nlogistics,  particularly  improving  connectivity  in  the  transport  sector  such  as  ports,  and \nstrengthening the infrastructure of the economic corridor, especially in the transport sector.9\n \n \n10. \nConsistency with  sector  strategy and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is  in \nline  with  ADB\u2019s  Sustainable  Transport  Initiative,  which  recognizes  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration as an emerging need and challenge that should receive more ADB support.10 This is \nto be done by addressing constraints to trade growth, such as the indirect costs associated with \nunreliable transport times, border-crossing delays, and handling and storage costs that result from \npoor terminal infrastructure. The project is also in line with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Regional \nCooperation and Integration, 2016\u20132020, which emphasizes the need to strengthen connectivity \nbetween economies by improving cross-border physical connectivity.11\n \n \n11. \nLessons  from  previous  operations.  The  proposed  loan  will  be  the  first  ADB \nnonsovereign infrastructure loan in Sri Lanka since 2000. In October 2014, ADB approved up to \n$40 million for a senior loan in a related sector to Ocean Sparkle Limited (a company from India) \nfor  funding the acquisition of tugboats and platform service vessels to be deployed in India\u2019s and \nSri  Lanka\u2019s  ports.  12  Lessons  from  similar  projects  include  (i)  the  need  for  robust  market \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nassessments and conservative revenue projections, (ii) the need for robust transaction structures \nthat  could  absorb  temporary  disruptions  in  the  market,  and  (iii)  the  importance  of  engaging \nsponsors with demonstrated technical and management capability to execute such projects. \n \nD. \n \n(Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy). \n \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n(Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy). \n \n \n\nF. \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\n \n12. \nThe project is financially viable because its expected financial internal rate of return \nis  9.7%,  higher  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  9.0%.  The  project  is \neconomically  sustainable as the economic internal rate of return is 12.1%, higher than the social \ndiscount rate  of  9.0%.3 Sensitivity analysis shows the project  is financially and economically \nviable  under  adverse scenarios. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \n13. \nADB\u2019s  proposed  assistance  is  a  direct  loan  of  up  to  $4.0  million  to  WCS  from \nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  a  tenor  of  8  years,  including  a  1-year  grace  period. \nWSL,  the  sponsor, and MTD Walkers, the sponsor\u2019s parent company, will jointly guarantee \nthe ADB loan. \n \nB. \n \n14. \n\nADB\u2019s assistance to the project will add substantial value in the following ways: \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nADB  is  filling  a  critical  market  gap  by  funding  a  project\u2014the  first  to  cater  to \nsmaller  vessels\u2014to  serve  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  shipping  industry.  Long-term  dollar \nfinancing of the  kind proposed to be provided by ADB is not readily available in \nSri Lanka. \nADB\u2019s  participation  will  further  strengthen  the  project\u2019s  environmental  and \nsocial  standards,  as  well  as \nimprove  corporate  governance  and \ntransparency  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s ship repair industry. \nADB\u2019s assistance, an essential source of financing for the project, will support \nthe  government\u2019s  initiative  to  promote  the  country\u2019s  shipping  and  maritime \nbusinesses  by  developing  a  high-quality  service  operation  to  sustain  the \ngrowth  and  maintenance of key private sector infrastructure. \n\nRisks \n\n \nC. \n \n(Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy). \n \n \n\n                                                           \n3 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n\f4  \n\n \n\nA. \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nThe  project is  classified as  category  B  for  environment, category  C  for involuntary \n15. \nresettlement,  and category  C for  indigenous  peoples  in  accordance  with the  ADB  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009). The potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been \nidentified, and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts are incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. WCS\u2019s capacity and commitment \nto  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and  environmental  impacts  are  adequate.  The  shipyard  is \nin  a  fisheries harbor and has a lease arrangement with the harbor authority. Project activities \nwill be  in areas earmarked within the premises of the harbor, free from any non-titleholders, and \nwill have  no  involuntary resettlement  or  indigenous peoples  impacts. Key issues  include the \nmanagement  of  dredging  activities  and  disposal  of  dredged  materials,  mitigation  of  noise \nassociated  with  activities during construction and operation, treatment of wastewater effluent, \ndisposal  of  solid  waste,  and  occupational  health  and  safety  management.  An  initial \nenvironmental  examination,  including an environmental management and monitoring plan, an \naudit of the existing facility, and  a  corrective  action  plan,  has  been  prepared  for  the  shipyard \nand  will  be  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website upon receipt of Board approval. \n \nThe  company  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social \n16. \nProtection  Strategy (2001), will comply with internationally recognized core labor standards.4 \nThe borrower  will  report  regularly  to  ADB  on  (i) their  compliance  with  such  laws  and  (ii)  the \nmeasures  taken  to  comply  with  the  international  standards.  A  project-specific  grievance \nredress mechanism will be  adopted, and information disclosure and consultations with affected \npeople will be conducted in  accordance with ADB requirements.5 The project is categorized as \nhaving no gender elements. \n \nB. \n \n17.  WCS (the borrower), WSL (the sponsor), and the sponsor\u2019s parent company were advised \nof  ADB\u2019s  policy  of  implementing  best  international  practice  relating  to  combating  corruption, \nmoney  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  ADB  will  ensure  that  the  investment \ndocumentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the \nfinancing of terrorism, as well as remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n \n18. \nexposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \n\nThe proposed loan is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single-project \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nD. \n\nAssurances \n\n \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,24  6ADB  will \n19. \nproceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of Sri Lanka has \n\n                                                           \n4  ADB. 2003.
