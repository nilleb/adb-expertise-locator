The  Project  will  provide \nsupport for (i) cost-effective and prioritized rehabilitation of the Amu \nZang  irrigation  system,  (ii)  improved  water  management  and \nenhanced capacities for water management agencies, (iii) improved \nagricultural  support  services  for  newly-emerging  private  farms \nthrough  development  of  rural  institutions  such  as  water  users \nassociations  (WUAs)  and  agriculture  service  centers  (ASCs),  and \n(iv)  farm  demonstration  and  training  programs  to  introduce  new \ntechnologies \nimprovement,  and  crop \ndiversification.  The  Project  will  facilitate  the  policy  and  institutional \nreforms  by  helping  the  Government  in  (i)  developing  a  sustainable \ncost  recovery  policy,  (ii)  enhancing  the  procedures  for  developing \nWUAs  at  the  national  level,  (iii)  improving  the  procurement  quota \nsystems for cotton and grain, and (iv) introducing water delivery fees \nin the project area. \n \nSome  400,000  people  live  in  the  five  districts  covered  by  the  Amu \nZang  irrigation  system.  The  people  within  the  project area depend \nprimarily on irrigated agriculture for their livelihood, since the industry \nand service sectors are less developed than they are in other parts \nof  Uzbekistan.  Poverty  incidence  in  Amu  Zang  area  is  estimated  to \nbe 31.4% compared with the national average of 27.5%.  \n \nThe Amu Zang irrigation system was built in 1973 and is now at the \nend of its useful life. The reliability and capacity of the aging pumping \ncascade  has  significantly  declined  and  high  sediment  levels  in  the \npumped water damaged the pumping equipment. A large amount of \nsediments  in  canals  and  drains  is  reducing  their  capacities  and \nincreasing  the  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs.  Due  to \ncanals\u2019  deteriorated  condition  and  a  high  level  of  seepage,  only \nabout 50% of water reach farmers' fields. Unless a major overhaul is \ndone,  some  of  the  key  components  of  the  main  system  could \ncollapse in less than 5 years. Any collapse of the system would have \ndevastating effects on a large number of the rural population, whose \nlivelihood are directly dependent on the system. There are only very \nfew employment alternatives in the area.  \n \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nGoal and Objective \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing plan \n\nissues  such  as  strengthening \n\nThe negative environmental impacts of the sudden decommissioning \nof  large-scale  irrigation  would  be  significant  and  are  likely  to \nexacerbate land degradation. \n \nThe  proposed  Project  offers  valuable  opportunities  for  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to help the Government address important \nreform \nirrigation  and  water \nmanagement,  formulating  and  implementing  irrigation  cost  recovery \npolicy and further expanding to a larger scale the agreed agriculture \nreform initiatives.  \n \nThe project goal is to maintain and improve agricultural productivity \nand farm income on a sustained basis. The project objectives are to \n(i)  increase  the  reliability,  efficiency,  and  sustainability  of  irrigation \nwater supply of the Amu Zang irrigation system; and (ii) facilitate and \naccelerate agriculture sector reforms in the project area.  \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $112.6  million  equivalent, \ncomprising  $64.1  million  equivalent  (57%)  in  foreign  exchange  and \n$48.5  million  equivalent  (43%)  in  local  currency.

The  loan  will  have  a  term  of  25  years,  including  a \ngrace  period  of  5  years;  an  interest  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  fixed  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.75%  per  annum;  a  front-end  fee  of  0.5%;  and  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. \n \nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF), on behalf of the Borrower, will relend \n$3.2  million  of  the  loan  proceeds  to  eligible  private  companies  and \nindividuals  to  establish  ASCs  in  the  five  project  districts.  The \nsubsidiary  loans  will  be  channeled  through  participating  financial \ninstitutions  (PFIs),  which  will  be  identified  during  the  first  year  of \nproject  implementation  based  on  criteria  agreed  upon  by  ADB  and \nthe  Borrower.  Subsidiary  loans  from  MOF  to  PFIs  will  be  for  10 \nyears, including a grace period of 3 years. \n \nInterest  for  the  subsidiary  loans  will  be  market-based interest rates \ntaking  into  account  the  cost  of  funds,  administrative  costs  of \nproviding  the  loans;  credit  risk;  and  reasonable  amount  of  profit  for \n\n \n\n\fv \n\nproviding  the  loans;  credit  risk;  and  reasonable  amount  of  profit  for \nthe PFIs. The PFIs will bear the sub-loan credit risks.  \n  \nUntil 30 September 2009 \n \n \n31 March 2009 \n \nThe Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (MAWR) \n \nA  high-level  project  steering  committee  (PSC),  chaired  by  a  deputy \nprime  minister  will  be  established  to  provide  policy  guidance,  and \nfacilitate  interministerial  coordination,  and  advise  the  Executing \nAgency (EA) in implementing the Project. The first deputy minister of \nagriculture and water resources in charge of water management will \nbe  appointed  as \nto  oversee  project \nthe  project  director \nimplementation.  A  project  management  office  (PMO),  led  by  a  full-\ntime  project  manager  has  been  established  within  MAWR  to \nimplement  the  Project  and  liaise  with  ADB  and  other  coordinating \nbodies.  \n \nA project implementation unit (PIU) has also been established within \nthe  Amu-Surkhan  Basin  Irrigation  Organization  as  part  of  PMO  in \nTermez.  The  PIU  will  be  managed  by  a  site  manager,  who  is \nresponsible  for  project  implementation  at  the  field  level.  The  site \nmanager  and  other  key  staff  of  PMO  and  PIU  will  be  selected  by \nMAWR and endorsed by ADB. \n \nThe Project will procure equipment, civil works, consulting services, \nvehicles and materials. All procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor  Procurement.  ADB,  upon  Government\u2019s  request,  approved \nadvance  action  on  the  procurement  of  civil  works,  construction \nmaterials,  and  equipment.  The  Government  will  also  take  the \nnecessary actions to recruit the consultants on advance basis.  \n \nThe Project will provide 156 person-months of international and 767 \nperson-months  of  domestic  consulting  services to assist MAWR in \nproject management, preparation of designs and bidding documents, \naward  of  contracts,  construction  supervision,  and  monitoring  and \nevaluation.  The  consulting  services  will  be  provided  by  an \ninternational consulting firm in association with domestic consultants. \nMAWR will engage consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to \nADB for engaging domestic consultants, using the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method.   \n \nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  some  400,000  people  of \nSurkhandarya  Province.    The  main  quantifiable  project  benefit \ncomes from the reversal of production decline and modest increases \nin  crop  yields  and  cropping  intensity.  The  average  cotton  yield  is \nexpected  to  increase  from  2.8  to  3.4  tons  per  ha  (t/ha),  average \nwheat yield from 3.1 to 3.9 t/ha, and cropping intensity from 110% to \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n\n\fwheat yield from 3.1 to 3.9 t/ha, and cropping intensity from 110% to \n123%.  Without  the  Project,  declining  irrigation  supplies  will  have  a \nnegative  impact  on  crop  yields.  The  average  yield  of  cotton  is \nprojected  to  decline  from  2.7  t/ha  to  2.3  t/ha  and  average  cropping \nintensity in the project area would fall from the present 110% to 91%. \n \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project is 19.5%. \nThe sensitivity analysis suggests that the EIRR is robust to adverse \neffects  of  price  and  yield  declines,  project  benefit  delays,  and \ninvestment cost increases.  \n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions  Besides  institutional  and  policy  risks,  the  main  risks  affecting  the \nProject  are  those,  which  relate  to  O&M  financing  and  to  delays  in \nproject  implementation.  To  mitigate  the  risks  related  to  O&M \nfinancing, the Project is proposing a range of activities including: (i) \ndevelopment of a national policy on cost recovery, (ii) improved O&M \npractices at the Amu Zang irrigation system and Amu Surkhan Basin \nIrrigation  Organization  (ASBIO),  (iii)  introduction  of  water  delivery \nfees  in  the  project  province,  and  (iv)  support  to  development  of \nWUAs to address on-farm and interfarm O&M.  \n \nThe  risk  of  implementation  delays  arising  from  MAWR\u2019s  limited \nfamiliarity  with  ADB  procedure  has  been  mitigated  by  involving \nMAWR  staff  during  project  preparation  and  processing.  The  PMO \nand PIU have been established. Also, ADB approved advance action \non procurement of civil works, construction materials, and equipment \nto  expedite  the  project  implementation.  Provisions  have  also  been \nmade  for  adequate  project  management,  construction  supervision, \nand  monitoring  and  evaluation.  MAWR  gave  the  assurance  that \nqualified  and  experienced  staff  acceptable  to  ADB  will  be  assigned \nto these offices on merit.  \n \nSustainable benefits and fair returns to agricultural producers will be \nachieved  by  reducing  Government\u2019s  mandatory  cotton  and  wheat \nquota,  giving  private  farmers  improved  access  to  key  agriculture \ninputs,  and  promoting  modern  water  saving  and \nfarming \ntechnologies. These issues will be addressed through the policy and \ninvestment interventions proposed under the Project.  \n \nAn associated grant-financed TA will be provided to complement the \nproposed loan\u2013funded Project. The TA will assist the Government in \ndeveloping  and  carrying  out  policy  and  institutional  reforms  in  the \nwater  sector  through  (i)  support  at  the  national  level  to  enhance \nMAWR\u2019s  policy  development  capacity  and  prepare  key  policy  and \nstrategy documents on cost recovery and WUA development; and (ii) \nsupport  at  the  basin  and  provincial  levels  to  develop  detailed \noperational procedures for the newly established ASBIO, strengthen \nits  water  management  and  planning  capacities,  implement  cost \nrecovery  policy,  introduce  water  delivery  fees,  and  promote  WUA \ndevelopment in Surkhandarya Province. \n \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n\nvi \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fvii \n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $740,000  equivalent,  of \nwhich $500,000 equivalent will be financed on a grant basis from the \nJapan  Special  Fund  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.    The  TA \nwill  provide  for  10  person-months  of  international  and  38  person-\ninternational \nmonths  of  domestic  consulting  services.  The \nconsultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Procedures  acceptable  to \nADB  will  be  used  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  The  TA  will \nbegin  during  the  first  year  of  project  implementation  and  will  be \ncompleted in 18 months. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\ni\ni\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Amu Zang Irrigation Rehabilitation Project. The report also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) for  Support to Policy and Institutional Reforms in \nthe  Water  Sector,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. The project framework is in Appendix 1.  \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nWith  an  average  annual  rainfall  of  100\u2013200  millimeters,  crop  farming  in  Uzbekistan  is \n2. \nheavily dependent on irrigation.  About 88% of the country\u2019s 4.8 million hectares (ha) of arable \narea  is  irrigated.  Irrigation  water  supplies  come  almost  entirely  from  the  Amu  Darya  and  Syr \nDarya rivers. Irrigated agriculture accounts for 35% of the gross domestic product (GDP), 45% \nof  employment,  and  60%  of  export  revenues.  Uzbekistan  has  a  comparative  advantage  in \ngrowing  cotton,  making  it  currently  the  world\u2019s  fifth  largest  producer  and  the  second  largest \nexporter of cotton. Cotton is grown on about 42% of the total cultivated area, and accounts for \nclose to 40% of Uzbekistan\u2019s export earnings. Uzbekistan has used foreign exchange proceeds \nfrom cotton exports to support its import substitution policy and continues to depend on these \nearnings to sustain its industrial production. Wheat is also regarded as a strategic crop and is \ngrown on 33% of the total cultivated area. As a landlocked country with limited physical access \nto international markets and with food security as a major concern, Uzbekistan has put wheat \nproduction at the center of the Government\u2019s policy of food security.  \n\n3. \nSince  independence  in  1991,  the  overall  performance  of  agriculture  sector  has  been \ndisappointing. Continued declines were observed in the production and productivity of the main \ncash  crop\u2014cotton.  While  the  total  national  output  of  cotton  was  4.6  million  tons  in  1991,  it \ndropped  to  3.17  million  tons  in  2002  because  of  declines  in  both  area  and  per  ha  yield.    The \ndecline in cotton production also coincided with the Government\u2019s active promotion of policy of \nfood  security  through  state-controlled  pricing  and  procurement  systems.  Between  1991  and \n2002, wheat production increased from 0.6 million tons to around 4.7 million tons. Much of the \nincreases  in  wheat  production  was  achieved  by  expanding  the  land  area  previously  used for \ncotton and by increasing inputs on a per ha basis.  \n\nThe overall poor performance of agriculture and the relatively low international prices of \n4. \ncotton in recent years have caused widespread farm losses, accumulated debts, and declining \nincomes  for  agricultural  producers.  As  a  result,  the  livelihood  of  the  rural  population  has \nseriously deteriorated.  There is at present no official definition of poverty line in the country. A \nrecent  (2003)  assessment  conducted  by  the  World  Bank1 using 2,000  household  survey  data, \nestimated  the  food  poverty  line  at  SUM3,601  per  capita  per  month  and  the  national  poverty \nincidence  at  27.5%.  Most  of  the  poor  reside  in  the  rural  areas.  It  was  noted  that  seasonal \nunemployment in the rural areas reduced the  income and consumption of the rural population \nby 50% on average. About 35% of the unemployed are from poor households. \n\n                                                 \n1\n  World Bank. 2003. Uzbekistan Living Standards Assessment. Washington, D.C. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n5. \nMost  of  the  country\u2019s  extensive  irrigation  and  drainage  (I&D)  infrastructure  that  was \ndeveloped in the 1960s and 1970s, has now reached the end of their useful life. Deterioration \nhas  accelerated  since  independence  due  to  large  transfers  out  of  the  agriculture sector and \nlimited  allocation  of  funds  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  and  rehabilitation.  The \nGovernment\u2019s capacity  to  plan,  design,  and  operate  I&D  systems  is  also  inadequate  as  the \ndesign institutes, once responsible for developing water and I&D systems in Uzbekistan as  well \nas  in  whole  Central  Asia,  have  lost  most  of  their  technical staff. Water  users  have  virtually  no \nparticipation  in  managing  I&D  systems.  As  a  result,  the  O&M  of  the  I&D  system  is  below \nacceptable standards. The consequences are excessive water losses, low irrigation efficiencies, \nwaterlogging  and  widespread  soil  salinization,  and  declining  crop  yields.  The \ndeterioration/losses  of  the  resource  base  for  agricultural  production  is  estimated  to  cost  the \ncountry about $1.0 billion annually in economic prices. \n\n6. \nRehabilitation of the  I&D infrastructure is key to ensuring a secure supply of water and \nstimulating growth for the entire communities of hundreds of thousands people, who came into \nbeing solely because of irrigation development and settlement schemes. If not rehabilitated, the \ndeteriorating  schemes  will  either  become  dysfunctional  or  lose  a  significant  part  of  irrigated \nfarms,  causing  major  negative  socioeconomic  impacts.  The  poor  operational  status  of  I&D \ninfrastructure also exacerbates the already high water application rates and rapidly reduces the \nquality  of \ntables  and  salinization.  The  environmental \nconsequences of land degradation are already substantial and are likely to matter considerably \nunless more is invested in the maintenance of I&D infrastructure.   \n\nthrough  rising  water \n\nfarmland \n\n7. \nRecognizing  these  problems,  the  Government  places  the  rehabilitation  of  key  water \ninfrastructure  facilities  as  a  top  national  priority.  At  the  same  time,  the  Government  is \nincreasingly aware that the rehabilitation of I&D facilities must be planned and implemented with \ngreat care\u2014not to repeat or extend the social and environmental damage caused by the rapid \nexpansion  of  irrigation  systems  in  the  past.  The  Government  also  recognizes  that the current \npractice  of  irrigation  management  is  wasteful  and  does  not  promote  conservation,  or  higher \nproductivity of water.  In 2001 the Government, with the assistance of the World Bank, prepared \na  strategy2  to  rehabilitate  and  improve  the  basic  irrigation  infrastructure  of  the  country.  This \nstrategy consists of a two-phase approach, involving a public investment program to rehabilitate \nand  modernize  selected  main  and  interfarm  (i.e.,  secondary)  irrigation  systems  as  the  first \nphase, and gradually shifting to  improvement of the remaining interfarm and on-farm irrigation \nsystems driven by private investment as a second phase.  \n\n8. \nMore  recently,  the  Government  initiated  several  important  reforms  in  the  water  sector. \nThe  recent  Presidential  decree 3  promotes  the  reorganization  of  the  country\u2019s  irrigation \nmanagement  system  from  the  current  administrative  and  territorial  base  to  the  river-basin \nsystem , and also calls for  the introduction of market principles in the water delivery services in \nthe  country.  The  Presidential  Decree  of  March  2003  also  set  a  clear  priority  on establishing \nwater  users  associations  (WUAs)  for  delivering  water  and  managing  local  irrigation  works.  It \nrecognizes  the  need  to  improve  the  legal  framework  and  implementation  mechanisms  for \n\n                                                 \n2\n  Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources and World Bank. 2001. Irrigation and Drainage Sector Strategy Study. \n\n3\n  Republic of Uzbekistan. 2003.  On the Most Important Directions for Deepening Reforms in Agriculture. Decree of \n\nthe President, 24 March 2003, hereafter referred to as Presidential Decree of March 2003. \n\nTashkent. \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nWUAs.  In  a  follow-up  resolution  of  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  (COM), 4 the Government took a \nfurther  step  in  this  direction  by  elaborating  the  new  roles  and  structure  of  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture  and  Water  Resources  (MAWR).    This  reflects  the  streamlining  of  the  overall \nstructure and decentralization of functions to local levels.  According to the new resolution, the \nresponsibility  of  MAWR  focuses  more  on  policy  development,  regulation,  and  other  priority \nareas of irrigation and water resources management, and the water management organizations \nat province and district levels have been reorganized into 10 river basin irrigation management \norganizations.  To  implement  these  reform  initiatives,  however,  the  Government  requires \nsubstantial financial and technical support from aid agencies. The detailed agriculture and water \nsector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n\n9. \nFarm privatization  is another high priority in the  Government\u2019s  reform  agenda.  Despite \nsubstantial assistance provided by the Government in the form of subsidized inputs, credit lines, \nand  farm  debt  relief,  shirkats 5  in  the  past  few  years  had  a  disappointing  performance\u2014they \nfailed  to  increase  crop  yields  and  output  and  incurred  financial  losses.  During  1996\u20132001, \nvirtually  no  output  growth  was  observed  in  shirkats,  whereas  dekhan  and  private  farms \nexperienced  significant  output  growth. 6  Shirkats  could  not  provide  sufficient  incentives  to \nfarmers to achieve higher productivity and efficiency and improve their living standards. Despite \nbetter  performances  of  private  and  dekhan  farms,  the  Government  has  been  conservative in \naccelerating farm privatization. For instance, the Government carried out complete privatization \nonly  on  loss-incurring  shirkats;  moreover,  individual  applicants  for  private  land  from  shirkats \noften received low quality marginal land. Thus far,  only about 8% of over 2,000 shirkats in the \ncountry  have  been  fully  privatized.  The  Government  maintained  that  its  policy  of  gradual  and \nselective  privatization  is  justified  because  it  avoids  the  large  social  costs  associated  with  high \nunemployment that may be caused by large-scale privatization.  \n\n10. \nThe  situation  can  rapidly  change  as  the  Government\u2019s  recent  initiatives  gave  a  new \nimpetus  to  farm  privatization  and  the  restructuring  process.  The  Presidential  Decree  of  March \n2003 (footnote 3) for the first time explicitly recognized private farming as the model for future \nfarming and expanded the private farmers\u2019 status by awarding long-term land lease and formal \nregistration.  The  most  recent  presidential  decree 7 approves  the  accelerated  privatization  of \nshirkats, which would eventually increase the share of private farms from the current 12.5% to \n63.3% of total cropland by 2007.  \n\n11. \nA  crucial  constraint  in  accelerating  farm  privatization  and  restructuring  is  the  farm \nsupport services for private farming. The existing agricultural support services do not meet the \nneeds  of  an  increasing  number  of  private  farmers\u2014in  both  quantity  and  quality,  including \naccess  to  input  supply,  and  farm  machinery.  As  a  result,  private  farms  remain  dependent  on \nshirkats.  Currently,  most  of  machinery  services  are  provided  by  the  so-called machinery and \ntractor  pools,  the  joint  stock  companies  with  significant  Government  shares.  These  pools \nprovide services that are often costly, of poor quality, and not tailored to the needs of the newly \n\n                                                 \n4\n  Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers. 2003.  Improvement of Activity Arrangements of the Ministry of Agriculture \n\nand Water Resources of the Republic of Uzbekistan, 28 June.  \n\n5\n  The  farming  sector  features  three  types  of  farms:  shirkats,  private  farms,  and  dekhan  farms.  Shirkats  are  large \n(1,500\u20132,500 hectares [ha]) cooperative farms converted from state farms under the central planning system. The \nnewly emerging private farms (5\u2013500 ha) are run by either individuals or family partnerships. Dekhan farms are \nbackyard household plots (0.20\u20130.35 ha) given by the State to each urban and rural household. \n\n6\n  World Bank. 2002. Country Economic Memorandum. Washington, DC. During 1996\u20132001, 30% of total agricultural \n\noutput growth was supplied by private farms and 70% by dekhan farms. \n\n7\n  Republic of Uzbekistan. 2003.  On  the  Concept  of  Development  of  Farms  for  2004\u20132006.  Presidential  Decree,        \n\n27 October.     \n\n \n\n\femerging  private  farmers.  The  Government,  with  the  assistance  of  externally  supported \ninvestment projects, recently started promoting alternative service providers such as agriculture \nservice centers (ASCs) on a limited scale. ASCs are private sector-driven initiatives that provide \nessential  machinery  services  to  farmers  and  additional  services  such  as  input  supply,  agro-\nprocessing, and output marketing.  \n\n12. \nAnother  significant  barrier  in  reforming  the  agriculture  sector  is  the  Government\u2019s \nrestrictive policies on pricing and procurement for cotton and wheat that continue to adversely \naffect  farmers\u2019  incentives  to  increase  farm  productivity  and  efficiency.  The  Government\u2019s \npolicies  require  both  shirkats  and  private  farmers  to  sell  a  significant  part  of  their  cotton  and \nwheat  produce  to  the  State  at  fixed  prices,  which  are  lower  than  market  prices.8 The Ak Altin \nAgricultural Development Project of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)9 played a catalytic role \nin changing the Government\u2019s policies toward reducing the mandatory procurement quota, and \nintroducing  more  market-oriented  pricing  systems  that  favor  farmers.  As  a  result,  prices  of \ncotton and wheat increased by 57% and 72%, respectively. Similar reforms in the procurement \nsystem  are being pursued under the World Bank\u2019s Rural Enterprise Support Project. In addition, \nthe Government issued a resolution in December 2002, allowing the private sector to participate \nin the wholesale purchase and export of cotton. The implementation and the impacts of this new \nresolution remain to be seen, however.  \n\nLastly,  Uzbekistan\u2019s  narrow  base  of  crop  farming  that  essentially  centers  on  only  two \n13. \ncrops\u2014cotton  and  wheat\u2014needs  attention.  During  the  Soviet  period,  the  practice  to  rotate \ncotton with alfalfa was common,10 as the latter provided the necessary additional nutrients to the \nsoil and high-protein fodder for the livestock industry. After independence, this cropping practice \npractically  ceased  because  of  the  Government\u2019s  policy  of  food  security  in  wheat  production11 \nand the downturn of the livestock industry.12  Now cotton-winter wheat is the main crop rotation \npractice  in  Uzbekistan.  From  an  economic  and  agronomic  perspective  the  current  cropping \npattern that is based on cotton and wheat is likely sub-optimal. However, at present the options \nfor  crop  diversification  are  limited.  Given  prevailing  market  conditions,  farmers\u2019  know-how, \ngovernment  policies  and  agro-ecological  conditions  it  is  unlikely  that  the  current  cropping \npattern  will  change  significantly  over  the  short  to  medium  term.  Shift  to  higher  value  crops  is \nconstrained  by  the  absence  of  production,  processing  and  marketing  chains  and  is  further \ncomplicated by transportation infrastructure bottlenecks and the country\u2019s physical isolation. The \nGovernment is exploring diversification to other field crops such as oilseeds, groundnuts, lentils, \nbeans and maize as part of a program to develop alternative cropping patterns and water saving \ntechnologies. International agriculture research institutes with assistance provided by ADB are \nhelping the Government in this regard.13 \n\n14. \nADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy  and  Water  Policy.  ADB\u2019s  operations  in  Uzbekistan  are \nguided  by  the  Country  Operational  Strategy  of  March  2000  and  the  Country  Strategy  and \n                                                 \n8\n  At  present,  farmers  are  required  to  sell  about  50%  of  their  cotton  and  wheat  outputs  at  fixed  prices  to  the \n\nGovernment. \n\n9\n  ADB. 2001.

Manila. \n Ratio between cotton and alfalfa was 5:3, i.e., cotton was grown for 5 years in 8 years rotation. \n Because of the policy of food security, the Government, through its procurement quota and farm credit and input \nsupply systems, increased the area under wheat considerably.  \n The  effective  demand  for  livestock  output  fell  dramatically  mainly  because  of  sharp  declines  in  the  purchasing \npower of the population. \n ADB. 1999.

In both documents, agriculture is recognized as the key sector \nfor  ADB\u2019s  assistance.  ADB\u2019s  water  policy  promotes,  among  other  things,  basin  management \nprinciples,  developing  and  strengthening  the  capacities  of  national  water  management \ninstitutions  and  WUAs,  as  well  as  developing  sustainable  O&M  policies  by  introducing  water \ndelivery  fees  and  greater  participation  of  beneficiaries  in  maintaining  and  managing  basic \nirrigation  infrastructure.  Since  the  proposed  Project  aims  to  assist  the  Government  in \nimplementing its recent reform initiatives in irrigation sector (paras 30 and 82), it is in line with \nthe strategic thrusts of ADB\u2019s key policy and strategy documents. \n\n15. \nExternal  Assistance.  The  World  Bank  supports  (i)  privatization  of  state-owned farms, \nincluding improving managerial capacity, providing agricultural support services and equipment, \ncreating  off-farm  employment,  and  extending  rural  credit;  and  (ii)  improvement  of  water \nresources management. Two projects are ongoing: Cotton Subsector Improvement Project ($66 \nmillion)  and  Rural  Enterprise  Support  Project  ($36  million).  The  European  Union  Technical \nAssistance for the Commonwealth of Independent States (EU-TACIS) program supports private \nfarms,  pilot  integrated  development,  training  and  education  for  farmers,  on-farm pilot irrigation \nmanagement,  land  registration,  and  crop  forecasting  by  remote  sensing.

The  major \nexternal assistance in the agriculture and water sectors of Uzbekistan is in Appendix 3. \n\nimplementing \n\nis \n\n16. \nLessons  Learned. Since ADB\u2019s project portfolio in the agriculture and water sectors of \nUzbekistan  is  relatively  new,  ADB\u2019s  project  implementation  experience  in  other  sectors  of \nUzbekistan  and  its  experience  in  water  sector  operations  in  similar  countries  of  the  region \nprovided  useful  lessons  during  the  design  of  the  Project.  ADB\u2019s  experience  highlighted  the \nimportance of (i) a strong Government ownership of the Project, (ii) proper assessment of the \ninstitutional  capacities  of  the  implementing  agency,  and  (iii)  close  monitoring  of  project \nimplementation. These lessons have been incorporated in the Project design. The senior staff \nand  experts  of  MAWR  have  been  closely  involved  in  preparing  the  feasibility  study.  All  key \ngovernment agencies and ministries including COM, Ministry of Finance (MOF), and Ministry of \nEconomy  (MOE)  were  consulted  frequently  during  project  design.  The  province  and  district \nauthorities  in  Surkhandarya  and  the  direct  project  beneficiaries  have  also  been  closely \nconsulted.14  The  project  feasibility  study  evaluated  the  capacity  of  MAWR  to  implement the \nProject.  In  view  of  MAWR\u2019s  limited  capacity, 15  the  Project  and  the  associated  technical \nassistance (TA) provide adequate resources for institutional development and capacity building. \nThe  Project  also  provides  an  elaborate  mechanism  for  monitoring  project  progress  through  a \nproject  steering  committee  (PSC),  a  project  management  office  (PMO),  and  a  project \nimplementation unit (PIU). \n\n                                                 \n14\n\n15\n\n  During  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  study,  three  major  workshops  were  organized  to \nconsult with all key stakeholders on main design features of the project design. \n The institutional assessment undertaken under the PPTA concluded that the capacity of MAWR and Amu Surkhan \nBasin Irrigation Organization needs to be strengthened especially in project implementation, policy analysis, and \ndevelopment of sustainable O&M systems.  \n\n \n\n\fProject  Rationale.  The  Amu  Zang  irrigation  system  is  located  in  the  Surkhandarya \n17. \nProvince,  and  comprises  a  cascade  of  pumping  stations  and  the  network  of  irrigation  canals \nconveying  water  from  the  Amu  Darya  River  to  a  command  area  of  96,800  ha.16   The  system  \nwas built in 1973 and is the third largest irrigation system17 in the country. The system is at the \nend of  its  useful  life,  and  the  reliability  and  capacity  of  the  aging  pump  cascade  has  declined \nseriously. Some 400,000 people live in the five districts covered by Amu Zang irrigation system, \nand  their  livelihood  depends  primarily  on  irrigated  agriculture  since  the  industry  and  service \nsectors are less developed than  they are  in other parts of Uzbekistan.  Poverty incidence in the \nproject  area  is  estimated  at  31.4%,  compared  with  the  national  average  of  27.5%.  Unless  a \nmajor overhaul occurs, some of the key components of the main system could collapse in less \nthan  5  years.  The  people  in  the  project  area  are  caught  in  a  vicious  cycle  of  deteriorating \nirrigation service, falling income, and land degradation. If the system is not rehabilitated, it would \nlose much of its operational functions, reducing its irrigation service area by as much as 50% in \n10  years.  Most  villagers  would  then  be  forced  to  abandon  cultivation,  without  prospects  of \nfinding alternative livelihood.  This  will  also  have  major  environmental  consequences such as \nlarge-scale land degradation and desertification.  \n\n18. \nThe  proposed  Project  will  help  the  villagers  in  the  Surkhandarya  Province  break  free \nfrom  the  persisting  vicious  cycle  of  worsening  poverty\u2014by  providing  them  with  an  improved \nirrigation  system,  and  also  by  stimulating  growth,  and  promoting  sustainable  and  profitable \nagriculture  through  a  range  of  interventions,  such  as  farm  privatization,  choice  of  cropping \npatterns,  and  marketing  of  outputs.  ADB  is  well  placed  to  capture  this  opportunity,  as  it  has \nplayed a catalytic role in introducing the first major agriculture reform in Uzbekistan through the \nAk Altin Agricultural Development Project.18 The proposed Project also offers an opportunity for \nADB  to  help  transform  the  present  irrigation  management  style  to  a  demand-driven  and \nbeneficiary-led irrigation operation, and promote stronger accountability and efficiency of water \ninstitutions. Altogether, these initiatives will help Uzbekistan move toward achieving sustainable \nand  more  efficient  use  of  land  and  water  resources.  Replication  of  pilot  initiatives  proposed \nunder the Project will also bring about significant positive impacts on the management of shared \nwater in the Amu Darya Basin as a whole.  \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nGoal and Objective \n\n19. \nThe Project goal is to maintain and improve agricultural productivity and farm income on \na  sustained  basis.  The  Project  objectives  are  to  (i)  increase  the  reliability,  efficiency,  and \nsustainability of the water supply of Amu Zang irrigation system; and (ii) facilitate and accelerate \nthe ongoing agriculture sector reforms in the project area.  \n\nB. \n\nComponents and Output \n\n17\n\n20. \nThe  Project  has  the  following  components:  (i)  rehabilitation  of  the  Amu  Zang  irrigation \nsystem; (ii) support to improve irrigation management; (iii) support to private farm development; \n                                                 \n16\n\n The detailed description of the project area is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n The two other systems are the Karshi pumping cascade and Amu Bukhara irrigation system; both of them tap the \nAmu Darya river water within the territory of Turkmenistan, making the launch of rehabilitation work subject to the \nconcurrence of the Turkmenistan Government.  \n Under this project (footnote  9),  the  Government  agreed  to  relax  the  quota  of  mandatory  state  procurement  of \ncotton  and  wheat  for  the  first  time.  A  similar  relaxation  was  replicated  under  the  World  Bank's  Rural  Enterprise \nRestructuring Project.  \n\n18\n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nand (iv) project management, monitoring, and evaluation. The Project will also facilitate ongoing \npolicy and institutional reforms by promoting alternative procurement quota systems for cotton \nand  grain  and  introducing  water  delivery  fees  in  the  project  area;  and  by  assisting  the \nGovernment to develop the national cost recovery policy and improve the operational guidelines \nfor WUA development (paras. 30 and 49). \n\n21. \nThe key project outputs are (i) a more reliable and efficient Amu Zang irrigation system \nthat  allows  yield  increase;  (ii)  enhanced  management  capacity  for  water  systems, resulting in \nconservation  of  irrigation  water;  and  (iii)  better  access  to  agricultural  inputs  (farm  machinery, \nfertilizers, and seeds), together with introduction of modern farming technologies that enhance \nincomes. The project components are briefly described here; and the detailed descriptions are \nin Supplementary Appendix B. \n\n1. \n\nRehabilitation of Amu Zang Irrigation System \n\n22. \nThe Project will support the cost-effective and prioritized rehabilitation of the Amu Zang \nirrigation system by (i) constructing a new sediment control facility; (ii)  selectively rehabilitating \nthe  pumps,  motors,  and  other  auxiliary  facilities  in  the  three  main  pumping  stations;  (iii) \nimproving  the  maintenance  facilities;  and  (iv)  rehabilitating  selected  sections  of  the  main \nirrigation and drainage network.  \n\n23. \nA new sediment  control  facility  will  be  constructed  to  reduce  the  amount  of  sediment \nentering the canal network and to extend the operational life of the pumping stations. The works \non  the  main  pumping  stations  will  include  replacement  of  two  pumps/motor  units  of  pumping \nstation Amu Zang I, rehabilitation of the auxiliary systems of pumping stations Amu Zang I and \nII, and comprehensive rehabilitation of the Babatag pumping station to improve the performance \nof  pump  stations.  Further,  the  Project  will  support  the  refurbishment  of  four  maintenance \nworkshops to facilitate the continued operation of the pumping stations after the rehabilitation. \nThe Project will also  rehabilitate selected sections  of  the  main  irrigation  canals  to  restore  the \nsystem \u2019s  original  water  conveyance  capacity  and  ensure  efficient  and  timely  distribution  of \nirrigation water.  \n\n2. \n\nSupport to Improve Irrigation Management \n\n24. \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  management  systems  of  Amu  Zang  irrigation  system  and \nAmu-Surkhan  Basin  Irrigation  Organization  (ASBIO)  by  (i)  strengthening  their  capacities;  (ii) \nintroducing  improved  O&M  procedures,19 (iii) supporting the establishment of WUAs, and (iv) \ndeveloping and installing a decision support system comprising a supervisory control and data \nacquisition (SCADA) system and an optimized water resources management model.  \n\nThe  Project  will  support  capacity  building  for  ASBIO  by  organizing  training  for \n25. \nmanagerial  staff  on  the  new  procedures  for  effective  O&M  of  the  system  and  on  WUA \ndevelopment.  The  Project  will  also  provide  direct  support  to  formation  and  operation  of  seven \nWUAs in five project districts and training and advisory services to more than 50 WUAs in the \nproject  province.  The  SCADA  system  will  be  installed  to  monitor,  control,  and  automate the \noperation of the system.  Also, a computer model will be developed to improve the planning and \nefficient use of the basin\u2019s water resources. The model will simulate and optimize the operation \nof reservoirs, pumping stations, and the distribution of water to canals and various users.  \n\n                                                 \n19\n\n The detailed analysis of current and future O&M arrangements proposed under the Project are in Supplementary \nAppendix C. \n\n \n\n\f3. \n\nSupport to Private Farm Development \n\n26. \nThe Project will support private farms in the five project districts by (i) rehabilitating I&D \ninfrastructure of selected pilot areas to improve on-farm water use efficiencies and ensure fair \ndistribution  of  water;  (ii)  implementing  a  farm  demonstration  and  training  program  to  introduce \nnew  technologies  on  water  saving,  soil  improvement,  and  crop  diversification;  and  (ii) \nestablishing ASCs to provide access to essential input supply and output marketing services. \n\nRehabilitation  of  on-farm  irrigation  and  drainage  systems  will  include  (i)  provision  of \n27. \nmeasuring  devices  and  control  structures,  (ii)  improvement  of  irrigation  and  drainage  canals, \nand (iii) refurbishment of essential canal lining. Within each pilot area, the farm demonstrations \nand  training  program 20  will  undertake  activities  designed  to  illustrate  the  benefits  of  (i) \nagronomically sound, financially viable, and environmentally sustainable crop diversification and \ncrop  intensification  technologies;  (ii)  soil  fertility  treatment;  and  (iii)  improved  on-farm water \nmanagement. The program will be organized and implemented by the PIU through subcontracts \nwith  national  research  institutes  and,  where  possible,  supported  by  international  agricultural \nresearch institutes.  \n\n28. \nThe  establishment  of  around  five  private  ASCs  will  be  supported  by  providing  a  credit \nline  for  a  total  of  $3.2  million  equivalent  to  qualified  borrowers  through  participating  financial \ninstitutions  (PFIs).  The  ASCs  will  provide  urgently  needed  rental  farm  machinery,  supply  of \ninputs,  and  output  marketing  services.  The  participating  enterprises  will  use  the  subloans  to \nprocure  much  needed  machinery,  equipment,  and  other  capital  investments.  The  PFIs  will \nscreen the subborrowers, as they will bear the credit risks. The proceeds of the subsidiary loans \nwill  be  onlent  by  PFIs  to  ASCs  at  market-based  interest  rates  to  take  into  account  the  cost  of \nfunds,  administrative  costs  of  providing  the  subloan,  credit  risk,  and  a  reasonable  margin  of \nprofit for PFIs. The detailed relending and onlending arrangements and  the criteria for selecting \nASCs are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n\n4. \n\nProject Management, Monitoring, and Evaluation \n\n29. \nThe PMO has been established within MAWR in Tashkent and a PIU within the ASBIO \nin  Termez  as  part  of  PMO.  The  team  of  international  and  domestic  consultants  will  train  and \nadvise  PMO  and  PIU  staff  and  provide  additional  support  during  project  implementation. The \norganizational arrangements of the PMO and the PIU are discussed in paras. 35 and 36.  Within \nthe  PMO,  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  unit  will  be  established  to  monitor  project \nperformance,  including  environmental  and  social  impacts  as  specified  in  the  summary  initial \nenvironmental  examination  and  the  poverty  and  social  assessment,  and  the  progress  and \nperformance of various reform measures introduced under the Project, according to the specific \nmonitoring indicators described in the project framework (Appendix 1). \n\n                                                 \n20\n\n This  program  has  been  developed  in  close  collaboration  with  an  ADB-financed  RETA  (footnote  13),  which \nsuccessfully developed a number of new technologies on water saving, soil improvement, and crop diversification \nin Central Asia. In November 2003, ADB also approved the follow-on RETA (2004-2006) to advance the research \nworks  started  under  the  first  phase  of  the  RETA  and  disseminate  the  results  to  wider  areas.  The  farm \ndemonstration subcomponent of the proposed Project will be implemented in close collaboration with the follow-on \nRETA.  \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n30. \nTo  advance  ongoing  reforms  in  the  agriculture  and  water  sectors,  the  Project  will \npromote several policy and institutional measures. These relate to (i) relaxing the Government\u2019s \nmandatory procurement quotas for cotton and wheat in the five project districts; (ii) supporting \nthe development of a national policy on cost recovery and improved operational procedures for \nWUA  development;  (iii)  developing,  testing,  and  introducing  water  delivery  fees in the project \nprovince; and (iv) supporting the establishment of a water sector reform support unit within the \noverall structure of MAWR.  \n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\nThe total project cost is estimated at $112.6 million equivalent, comprising $64.1 million \n31. \nequivalent (57%) in foreign exchange and $48.5 million equivalent (43%) in local currency. The \nestimates  include  $20.6  million  equivalent  in  taxes  and  duties,  and  $11.1  million  equivalent  in \nphysical  and  price  contingencies.    The  cost  estimates  are  summarized  in  Table  1.  Further \ndetails are in Appendix 4 and Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\n \n\nComponent \n\nA.

After the grace period, interest will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility. \n\nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n32. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $73.2  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  to  help  finance  the  Project.    The  loan  will  have  a  25-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years;  an  interest  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.75%; a front-end fee of 0.5% of the loan amount; and such \nother  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement.    The  Government  has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices \n\n \n\n\fwere its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice \nfrom ADB. \n \n33. \nThe Borrower will be the Republic of Uzbekistan. The requested level of financing will be \n65% of the total project cost and will cover most of the foreign exchange costs21 including the \nfront-end fee, interest, and other charges during construction. The beneficiaries and the private \nsector will contribute about  $2.4  million  toward  the  project  costs  for  land  preparation  and  civil \nworks  of  on-farm  rehabilitation  work  and  demonstration  plots,  equity  investment,  and  working \ncapital for the ASCs.

MAWR  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  of  the  Project.    The  first  deputy  minister  of \nMAWR  in  charge  of  water  management  will  be  appointed  as  the  project  director  to  oversee \nproject  implementation.  A  high-level  project  steering  committee  (PSC),  chaired  by  a  deputy \nprime  minister,  will  be  established  to  provide  policy  guidance  and  facilitate  interministerial \ncoordination  at  the  central  and  provincial  levels.  The  PSC  will  comprise  representatives  from \nCOM,  MAWR,  MOF,  MOE,  State  Committee  on  Land  Resources,  and  State  Committee  for \nNature  Protection.  The  PSC  will  meet  quarterly  to  review  implementation  progress  and  major \nissues, and determine corrective measures.  \n\n35. \nThe  PMO  has  been  established  in  MAWR  to  manage  the  daily  project  activities  and \nliaise with the PSC, ADB, and other coordinating bodies. A full-time project manager, nominated \nby the Government, will lead the PMO. The project manager will have the authority to carry out \nfinancial  transactions,  sign  contracts,  and  endorse  financial  statements.  The  PMO  staff  will \ncomprise  full-time  planning,  financial,  irrigation/drainage,  procurement,  M&E  specialists  and \nsupport  staff  including  administrative  assistants,  interpreters,  and  secretaries  with  experience \nand qualifications acceptable to ADB.  \n\n36. \nThe  PIU  has  also  been  established  within  ASBIO  in  Termez  as  part  of  PMO.  The  PIU \nwill be responsible for project implementation activities at the field level and will have a full-time \nsite  manager,  who  will  be  supported  by  irrigation,  drainage,  and  mechanical  engineers;  an \nagronomist;  a  WUA  specialist;  an  accountant;  and  support  personnel.  MAWR  will  select  and \n\n                                                 \n21 The Government will finance the foreign exchange costs related to procurement of Russian pump spare parts in \n\nthe amount of $2.4 million. \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\nADB  will  endorse  the  site  manager  and  other  key  staff  of  the  PMO  and  the  PIU.  The \nGovernment  and  ADB  will  jointly  conduct  annual  reviews  of  project  implementation,  including \nproject  organization  and  staffing  arrangements,  and  make  the  necessary  adjustments.  The \norganization chart for project implementation is in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n37. \nThe Project will be implemented over 5 years, starting in 2004.  Project activities during \nthe  first  year  will  concentrate  on  selecting  and  fielding  consultants,  procuring  equipment, \ndeveloping operational systems for the PMO and the PIU, and training their staff. The civil works \ncomponent  will  be  implemented  in  separate  packages.  Field  surveys,  investigations,  and \npreparation  of  designs  and  bidding  documents  will  take  place  in  the  first  year.  WUAs  will  be \nestablished and their training initiated also in the first year, with most activities occurring during \nthe second and third years. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 5.  \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n38. \nAll  machinery,  equipment,  and  civil  works  for  rehabilitating  the  system;  plus  vehicles, \noffice  equipment,  and  materials  to  be  financed  by  ADB\u2019s  loan  proceeds  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  To  the  extent  possible,  the  Project  will \nprocure  similar  items  in  groups  to  optimize  volume  discounts.  Equipment  and  materials \nprocurement contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $500,000 or more will be awarded on \nthe basis of international competitive bidding (ICB). Contracts costing less than $500,000 will be \nawarded  on  the  basis  of  international  shopping  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Small  supply \ncontracts  costing  less  than  $100,000  will  be  procured  through  direct  purchase.  The  award  of \ncontracts will be subject to approval by ADB. \n\n39. \nEach civil works contract estimated to cost the equivalent  of $1.0 million or more will be \nawarded on the basis of ICB among prequalified contractors as described in ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement. Civil works packages costing less than $1.0 million will be carried out on the \nbasis  of  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  For  minor  rehabilitation  and \nmaintenance  works  whose  size,  nature,  and  location  make  them  unsuitable  for  competitive \nbidding,  and  if  MAWR  has  the  facilities  and  capacity  to  implement  these  works  expeditiously \nand at a reasonable cost, ADB may agree to force account procedures. The specific works to be \nimplemented  through  force  account  will  be  determined  during  implementation.  The  upper  limit \nfor a force account works package will be $50,000. The award of all civil works contracts will be \nsubject to approval by ADB. The contract packages are in Appendix 6.  \n\n40. \nTo  procure  goods  and  services  with  the  loan  proceeds,  the  Borrower  will  need  to \ndemonstrate that the local procurement procedures adopted are transparent and efficient, and \nconform to ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy.  The PFIs will certify to ADB that the goods and services \nfinanced by the loan are procured from ADB member countries. In addition, where the value of \ngoods  financed  by  the  loan  exceeds  $1,000,000,  a  preshipment  inspection  certificate  from  a \nreputable agency, acceptable to ADB, will be required.   \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n41. \nThe  Project  will  provide  156  person-months  of  international  and  767  person-months of \ndomestic  consulting  services.  The  consultants  will  assist  MAWR  in  (i)  institutional  capacity \nbuilding;  (ii)  design;  (iii)  procurement  support,  including  pre-qualification  of  contractors, \npreparation  of  bidding  documents,  and  bid  evaluation;  (iv)  construction  supervision;  and  (v) \n\n \n\n\fproject  M&E.  The  details  of  consulting  services  inputs  and  terms  of  reference  are  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  F.  The  consulting  services  will  be  provided  by  an  international \nconsulting  firm  in  association  with  domestic  consultants.  MAWR  will  engage  consultants  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nacceptable  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants,  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection method. \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Action \n\n42. \nTo  expedite  project  implementation,  ADB,  upon  Government\u2019s  request,  approved \nadvance action on the procurement of civil works, construction materials, and equipment. The \nGovernment  will  also  take  the  necessary  actions  to  recruit  the  consultants  on  advance  basis. \nThe  Government  has  been  informed  that  (i)  advance  action  will  cover  actions  up  to,  but  not \nincluding, contract signing; and (ii) approval of advance action does not commit ADB to finance \nthe Project. \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n43. \nAfter loan effectiveness, an imprest account will be established at a bank acceptable to \nADB, to facilitate the timely release of loan funds for making payments in local currency. During \nthe first year of implementation, the ceiling of the imprest account will be set at $1,000,000. The \nimprest  account  will  be  established  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook. \nADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure  procedures  will  be  used  to  reimburse  expenditures  and \nliquidate the imprest account for payments not exceeding $100,000 equivalent per payment. \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n44.  MAWR will keep separate accounts and financial statements for the Project, which will \nbe audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB.  Loan proceeds will be used \nfor engaging auditors acceptable to ADB. Certified copies of the audited financial statements will \nbe  submitted  to  ADB  within  9  months  after  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year  to  which  they  relate. \nInternal audit procedures will be developed in the PMO to improve financial management. The \nGovernment  was  informed  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  submission  of  audited  accounts,  which  covers \nfailure  in  submitting  audited  accounts  and  financial  statements  on  the  due  date.  A  formal \nwarning  will  be  issued  for  accounts  more  than  6  months  overdue  and  disbursements  will  be \nsuspended for accounts that are more than 12 months overdue. \n\n45.  MAWR, through the PMO, will submit quarterly and annual reports to ADB. The reports \nwill  indicate  progress  made  and  problems  encountered  during  the  period  under  review,  steps \ntaken  to  remedy  the  problems,  the  proposed  program  of  activities,  and  expected  progress \nduring  the  remaining  implementation  period.  MAWR  will  also  provide  other  reports  and \ninformation  relating  to  the  Project  as  ADB  may  reasonably  request,  including  the  Project\u2019s \nenvironmental impacts, dialogue with beneficiaries, and any social issues relating to the Project. \nWithin  3  months  after  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  MAWR  will  submit  to  ADB  a  project \ncompletion  report  detailing,  among  others,  information  on  project  implementation,  use  of  the \nloan proceeds, and the extent to which the objectives of the Project have been accomplished. \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n46. \nThe  comprehensive  performance  M&E  will  be  introduced  and  implemented  for  the \nProject. To monitor the social impact, the M&E unit will compile a benchmark database on basic \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\f13 \n\neconomic  and  social  conditions  during  the  first  year  of  project  implementation  to  have  a \nsocioeconomic  profile  of  the  beneficiaries.  Key  indicators  will  be  tracked  during  project \nimplementation  and  a  comparison  made  between  the  benchmark  and  project  completion \nsituations.  The  database  will  be  analyzed  to  give  an  assessment  of  the  Project\u2019s  impact  on \ndifferent social groups, including women and the lower income households. The M&E unit will \nalso  monitor  the  progress  and  performance  of  various  sector  reforms  implemented  under  the \nProject,  including  the  impacts  of  the  reforms  in  State  procurement  of  crops,  irrigation  cost \nrecovery, crop diversification, gender actions, and actual savings in abstraction of river water.  \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n47. \nADB  loan  review  missions  will  review  the  Project  regularly.  During  the  second  year  of \nimplementation, the Government and ADB will jointly carry out a midterm review to assess the \nachievement of project objectives and implementation milestones. The criteria for assessing the \nimplementation  milestones  will  include  (i)  progress  in  policy  measures  reflected  in  the \nGovernment assurances, (ii) implementation status, (iii) design and construction standards, (iv) \nphysical  progress  made  and  disbursements  in  relation  to  the  implementation  schedule,  (v) \nperformance  of  the  consultants  and  contractors,  and  (vi)  status  of  compliance  with  the  loan \ncovenants.  The  financial  and  economic  viability  of  the  Project  will  also  be  reassessed.  The \nmidterm  review  will  determine  the  need  for  any  additional  works  or  changes  in  the  project \nscope. \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n An associated grant-financed TA22 will assist the Government in carrying out policy and \n48. \ninstitutional  reforms  in  the  water  sector  by  strengthening  the  newly  reorganized  institutions  at \nnational,  basin,  and  provincial  levels;  providing  policy  advice;  and  developing  a  number  of \nimportant policy and legal documents related to water sector management.  \n\n49. \nThe  TA  will  have  two  components:  (i)  policy  and  institutional  reform  support  at  the \nnational level, and (ii) policy and institutional reform support at the basin and provincial levels. \nThe  first  component  will  comprise  assistance  to  MAWR  to  (i)  enhance its policy development \ncapacity; (ii) develop key policy and strategy documents on cost recovery, water delivery fees, \nand WUA developments; (iii) advise the Government on broader institutional and policy reform \noptions; and (iv) establish a new unit to support and regulate WUA developments nationwide.   \n\nThe  second  component  will  comprise  assistance  to  ASBIO  and  the  Surkhandarya \n50. \nProvince  Agriculture  and  Water  Department  (SPAWD)  to  (i)  develop  the  detailed  functional \nprocedures  of  the  newly  established  ASBIO;  and  (ii)  strengthen  the  capacity  of  ASBIO  and \nSPAWD to develop basin water management plans, implement the cost recovery policy at the \nbasin  level,  and  promote  WUA  developments  in  Surkhandarya.  These  components  will \ncomplement and support the activities proposed under the loan project, which will include direct \nassistance for strengthening WUAs in the project districts.23  \n\nThe total cost of the TA is estimated at $740,000 equivalent, of which $500,000 will be \n51. \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan \n\n                                                 \n22\n\n23\n\n The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities  (Internet edition) on 13 June 2003. \n The loan project will provide the WUAs in the project districts: (i) technical and legal advisory services, (ii) WUA \nstaff training, and (iii) equipment and tools necessary for WUA operations during project implementation. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f(Appendix 7). The TA will provide for 10 person-months of international and 38 person- months \nof  domestic  consulting  services.  An  international  consulting  firm  in  association  with  domestic \nconsultants  will  provide  the  services.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other procedures acceptable \nto  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  The  TA  will  begin  during  the  first year of project \nimplementation and will be completed in 18 months.  \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT  BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nExpected Impacts \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Impacts \n\n52. \nAnalyses  were  carried  out  to  assess  the  economic  viability  of  the  Project  and  financial \nviability of the participating farms. The main quantifiable benefits of the investment come from (i) \nprotection from production losses that may occur due to further deterioration and possible failure \nof  the  system  in  case  the  Project  does  not  materialize,  and  (ii)  modest increases in yield and \ncropping intensity resulting from a more reliable irrigation water supply and the ongoing reform \nin the agriculture sector. While the proposed reform measures (paras. 30, 82 and 83) will have a \npositive  impact  on  economic  returns,  these  have  not  been  quantified  due  to  methodological \ndifficulties and data uncertainties.  \n\n53.  Without  the  Project,  a  declining  water  supply  from  increasingly  inefficient  pumps  will \nhave a negative impact on crop yields and the cultivated area. The impact will be greater for the \nBabatag canal than for canals above Amu Zang I and II pumping stations. Overall, the average \nyield  of  cotton  will  decline  from  the  present  2.7  tons  per  hectare  (t/ha)  to  2.3  t/ha,  but  wheat \nyield will remain unchanged at 3.1  t/ha since it is grown during winter and spring when the total \ndemand for irrigation is low.  The average cropping intensity over the whole project area will fall \nto 91% from the present 110%, equivalent to a decline in cultivated area of 18,400 ha per year.  \nWith the Project, the average cotton yield will increase from 2.8 to 3.4 t/ha, the wheat yield from \n3.1 to 3.9 t/ha, and the overall cropping intensity to 123%, equivalent to an additional 13,500 ha \nof crops grown each year. The output of cotton will increase from 114,000 tons to 136,000 tons \nand  wheat  production  will  rise  from  128,000  tons  to  165,000  tons  in  year  10.  These  are \nconservative assumptions compared with the best practice found among project area farmers. \n\n54. \nBenefits  also  accrue  from  the  reduced  pumping  costs  for  water  and  savings  of  O&M \ncosts  for  maintaining  the  system.  The  greater  efficiency  of  new  pumps  will  reduce  the  cost  of \nenergy for pumping by an estimated $495,000 per year (in economic prices). Implementation of \nthe facility to reduce the intake of sediments to the system will reduce wear and tear on pumps \nand lower the cost of desilting main canals by $250,000 per year. O&M costs for the pumping \nstations are estimated to decline by $95,000 per year with the Project. \n\n55. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  the  Project  is  19.5%  and  the  economic \nnet  present  value  (NPV)  at  the  discount  rate  of  12%  is  $51.7  million.  Sensitivity  analysis  was \ncarried out on the effects of key variables on the economic viability of the Project. Overall, the \nEIRR was robust and well above the acceptable minimum (12%) despite the adverse effects of \nprice and yield declines, project benefit delays, and investment cost increases. A risk analysis of \nkey sensitivity variables gave a standard deviation of 3.1% from the base EIRR and a less than \n1% probability of the EIRR falling below 12%. \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\f15 \n\nTo illustrate the financial viability of farms in the project area, farm budget analysis was \n56. \ncarried  out  for  three  types  of  farms:  shirkats,  private  farms,  and  dekhan  farms.  The  results \nsuggest that the Project will lead to increased incomes for farm households.  The project impact \nis expected to be least on shirkats and greatest for private farms.  Net incomes for shirkats will \nrise from about $180 per ha now to $210 per ha by year 5 and $260 by year 10.  Incomes for \nprivate  farms,  with  crop  diversification  and  improved  productivity  will  increase  from  less  than \n$125  per  ha  now,  to  $250  ha  in  year  5  and  $360  per  ha  in  year  10.    For  dekhan  farms, the \nexpected increase is from around $740 per ha now to $970 per ha in year 10. \n\n57. \nThe  financial  sustainability  of  the  proposed  ASCs  was  also  analyzed.  The  result \nsuggests  that  ASCs  are  expected  to  yield  a  robust  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR) of \n25.9%. Over 25 years the NPV of income streams would be $478,000 at a discount rate of 12%. \nThe  benefit  distribution  and  poverty  impact  analysis  was  also  carried  out  for  the  Project.  It \nyielded a poverty impact ratio of 0.46.  Since this is above the poverty incidence ratio of 0.31, \npoor households will benefit relatively more from the Project than the other stakeholder groups. \nFurther information on economic and financial analyses is in Appendix 8 and in Supplementary \nAppendix G. \n\n58. \nThe  irrigated  agriculture  operations  in  the  Amu  Zang  area\u2014as  in  most  other  irrigated \nsystems  in  Uzbekistan\u2014are  heavily  distorted  by  implicit  taxes  as  well  as  subsidies.  The \nGovernment,  through  its  mandatory  state  procurement  system  for  cotton  and  wheat  at  lower \nprices,  imposes  heavy  implicit  taxes  on  farmers  surrounding  the  Amu  Zang  irrigation  system.   \nOn the other hand, the Government also provides direct and indirect subsidies to farmers in the \nform  of  cheap  electricity,  O&M  of  pumps  and  main  canals,  subsidized  fuel,  fertilizers  and \nmachinery  operations,  and  low  interest  credits  on  farm  operations.  The  comparisons  of  taxes \nand  subsidies  involving  the  Amu  Zang  irrigation  system  shows  that,  on  the  whole,  the  total \namount  of  taxes  imposed  on  the  farming  community  in  the  Amu  Zang  area  ($33.2  million) \nexceeds  the  total  subsidies  ($24.4  million)  provided  by  the  Government.  This  finding  is \nconsistent with World Bank\u2019s recent analysis that the net resource transfer out of the agriculture \nsector over the past decade has been significant.24 \n\nAccording  to  ADB\u2019s  subsidies  policy, 25  the  existing  subsidies  are  justifiable  on  the \n59. \nground  that  they  have  offsetting  effects  on  the  Government\u2019s  heavy  implicit  taxing  system  on \nfarmers in the Amu Zang area, and also that the market institutions are weak in this transition \neconomy.  However,  ADB\u2019s  subsidies  policy  also  encourages  the  systematic  phasing  out  of \nsubsidies  as  they  create  sector  inefficiency  and  farm  disincentives. The Government\u2019s recent \npolicies of reducing both subsidies and implicit taxes through continuous increases in key input \nprices as well as in outputs are important26 and should be encouraged. The reform measures \u2014\nintroduction  of  water  delivery  fees,  implementation  of  sustainable  cost  recovery  policies,  and \npromotion of private sector-driven rural institutions such as ASCs and WUAs \u2014proposed in the \nProject are expected to further reduce the farming subsidies in the Amu Zang area. Meantime \nthe  proposed  reductions  in  the  Government  procurement  quota  for  cotton  and  wheat  in  the \nProject  districts  are  also  expected  to  reduce  the  implicit  taxes  imposed  on  farmers  through \nhigher farmgate prices. Subsidies and taxes are discussed in detail in Appendix 8. \n                                                 \n24\n\n World Bank. 2003.  Uzbekistan Country Economic Memorandum \u2014Agriculture and the Rural Sector. Washington, \nDC. It is estimated that the net transfer of resources out of the agriculture sector until 2001 varied between $500 \nand $1 billion annually. \n ADB. 1996. ADB's Subsidies Paper. Manila. \n For instance, in 2002, the Government increased the procurement prices for cotton (by 57%) and wheat (by 72%) \nand  further  relaxed  the  state  procurement  quota  for  cotton  and  wheat  in  selected  districts.  Also,  in  2002  the \nGovernment substantially increased the prices of electricity for pump irrigation (by 60%), fuel and fertilizer.  \n\n26\n\n25\n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n2. \n\nImpact on the Environment \n\n60. \nThe  Project  will  have  a  significant  positive  environmental  impact  on  the  areas \nsurrounding  the  Amu  Zang  irrigation  system.  The  new  sediment  control  facility  will  reduce  by \n50% the sediments entering the system by 50% and the rehabilitated main canals and control \nstructures will reduce water losses and infiltration and improve water availability. Improvements \nto the drainage system will reduce waterlogging and soil salinity.   \n\n The project rehabilitation works will be concentrated around the existing large pumping \n61. \nstations  and  the  contractors  will  use  the  existing  buildings.  Special  clauses  in  the  contract \ndocuments  will  ensure  that  the  technical  operations  (replacement  of  pumps,  motors,  and \nconstruction activities) are carried out according to the standard Government procedures for the \nappropriate  disposal  of  waste,  minimization  of  nuisances  during  construction,  and  proper \naftercare of the construction sites.  The contractors will also comply with national health, safety, \nand hygiene requirements, which will be incorporated in the contract documents. Attention will \nbe paid to social discipline, control, and safeguards on wastewater and solid waste.  \n\n62. \nThe  Project  will  not  build  new  canals.  Neither  will  it  expand  pumping  capacity  or  the \nirrigated area. Therefore, no resettlement or land acquisition will be required.  The Project is not \nexpected  to  give  rise  to  significant  negative  environmental  impacts.    Measures  have  been \nproposed to mitigate the minor potential negative impacts identified in the initial environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  and  costs  for  implementing  the  measures  were  included  in  the  project \nbudget.  The main mitigating measures include (i) monitoring the morphology of the Amu Darya \nRiver, (ii) studying the need for fish exclusion devices at the intake, (iii) building safeguards into \nthe  contract  documents  to  cover  the  handling  and  disposal  of  hazardous  materials 27  by \ncontractors, and (iv) preparing a plan to clean up existing stockpiles of obsolete agrochemicals.  \n\n63. \nAt  present  the  riparian  states  have  no  formal  multilateral  water-sharing agreements on \nAmu  Darya  River.  The  only  existing  agreement  between  Uzbekistan  and  Turkmenistan  is  to \nequally  share  the  water  flow  of  Amu  Darya  River  between  the  two  countries  at  point  Kerk \ndownstream of the Amu Zang irrigation system. The Project will not increase the intake of river \nwater; instead, rehabilitation of the irrigation system and the resultant improvement in water use \nefficiency will allow about 5% reduction in the consumption of irrigation water28 and reduce the \namount of drainage effluent going back to the river system. Thus, the proposed Project will not \nhave  any  impact  on  the  neighboring  (upstream  and  downstream)  countries  in  terms  of  water- \nsharing arrangements, water intake limits, and transboundary environmental consequences. \n\n64. \nIn accordance with the recommendations of the IEE, an M&E Unit will be established in \nthe PMO during the first year of project implementation.  Supported by consultants, the unit will   \n\n                                                 \n27\n\n28\n\n These  are  the  materials  of  disassembled  old  pumps  that  may  contain  some  oil  products  and  other  polluting \nsubstances. \n The feasibility study estimates the saving of about 60 million cubic meters per year. The Amu Darya River received \nan  average  annual  inflow  of  74  cubic  kilometers  (km 3).  Uzbekistan  accounts  for  48%  of  the  water  used, \nTurkmenistan  36%,  and  Tajikistan  15%.  Present  flows  to  the  southern  Aral  Sea  and  its  delta  are  only  8  km 3 \nannually, compared with a minimum of 12 km 3 needed to maintain the delta ecosystems. Despite the water-sharing \nagreement between Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, water flow is hardly being monitored due to the inadequate flow \nmeasurement  stations.  Turkmenistan  has  diverted  the  larger  quantity  of  water,  leaving  less  for  Uzbekistan.  The \nreduction  in  Amu  Zang's  abstraction  of  river  water,  therefore,  will  lessen  the  potential  conflicts  between  the  two \ncountries. More importantly, the Project signifies the fact that improved irrigation could achieve water conservation. \nThe  World  Bank's  recent  Water  and  Environmental  Management  Project  (May  2003)  concluded  that  5\u201310% \nreduction  in  water  use  in  all  major  irrigation  systems  will  produce  significant  positive  impacts  on  the  Aral  Sea \necosystems. \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\ndevise a monitoring system, select key indicators, and monitor the project impacts. The SIEE is \nin Supplementary Appendix H.  \n\n3. \n\n    Impact on Living Standards \n\na. \n\nPoverty Reduction \n\n65. \nSome 400,000 people live in the area of the Amu Zang irrigation system, 88% of whom \nlive in the rural areas. The detailed description of the project area is in Supplementary Appendix \nA.  A  World  Bank  poverty  study  (2003)  estimated  that  in  2000,  28.4%  of  the  population  of \nSurkhandarya  Province  had  incomes  below  the  poverty  line.29 The feasibility study carried out \nthe  detailed  project  area-specific  social  and  poverty  analysis  (using  a  methodology  similar  to \nthat in the World Bank study). The details on the approach used are in Appendix 9. The result \nsuggests that poverty incidence in the project area was 31.4%. This percentage is equivalent to \n130,000 people or about 16,500 households. 30 About 44% of the poor in the project area reside \nin Djarkurgan and Kumkurgan districts; 39% in the remote Muzrabad district; and 22% and 23% \nin  Angor  and  Termez  districts,  respectively.31 The poor comprise 43% of shirkat workers and \n31.6%  of  dekhan  farmers.  There  are  no  poor  among  private  farmers  although  many  are \nvulnerable  in  the  sense  that  their  incomes  are  just  above  the  poverty  line  and  even  minor \nshocks can cause them to easily slide down to poverty.   \n\n66. \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  in  the  project  sites  by  improving  the \nreliability  of  irrigation  water  supplies  to  96,800  ha  of  irrigated  land.  This  benefit  will  accrue  to \nsome 400,000 people of whom 126,000 are poor. Because of the poor condition of the irrigation \nsystems,  only  cotton  fields  are  provided  about  100%  of  their  irrigation  water  quota.  Farms \nproducing wheat are given 70\u201390% of their irrigation water quota, while other cash crops grown \non  household  plots  receive  only  40\u201370%  of  their  quota.  Poor  farmers  who  often  grow  crops \nother than cotton thus get less water. With overall improvement in irrigation system as a result \nof the Project, the poor farmers will benefit directly.  \n\n67. \nIn  Uzbekistan,  rural  income  and  poverty  are  related  to  availability  of  irrigation  water. \nFindings  of  a  2003  World  Bank  study32  show  that  due  to  the  arid  conditions  of  the  country, \nconverting  its  irrigated  agriculture  land  to  nonirrigated  land  can  reduce  the  income  of  farm \nhouseholds  by  more  than  30%.  The  study  compared  the  farm  profitability  of  an  irrigated  and \nrain-fed land. The income effect would be more severe in steppe zones. The study also noted \nthat in south Uzbekistan, a 10% decrease in farm income would increase poverty incidence by \n14.3%. Thus, if the Amu Zang irrigation system is not rehabilitated and is left to deteriorate at its \npresent pace, poverty incidence in the area could increase from the current 31.4% to 44%. In \nthe  Babatag  canal  command  area  where  alternative  sources  of  irrigation  are  unavailable, \npoverty  rate  would  rise  to  more  than  50%.  With  the  Project,  however,  irrigation  water  will  be \nsupplied  to  a  large  number  of  farmer-beneficiaries,  including  the  poor  and  vulnerable  farm \nhouseholds  (headed  by  women  and  minorities).  This  would  reduce  poverty  incidence  from \n31.4% to 25%. \n                                                 \n29\n\n The  2003  Word  Bank  study  (footnote  1)  defined  the  poverty  threshold  based  on  the  expenditure  approach  to \nensure the required calories of 2,100 kcal per person per day. The food-based poverty line for Uzbekistan would \namount to SUM3,601 per month in October 2000 prices. The poverty head count rate was 30.5% for rural regions \nof Uzbekistan. The details of poverty definitions  used by World Bank an United Nations Development Programme \nare in Supplementary Appendix 1. \n The project area covers five districts: Angor, Djarkurgan, Kumkurgan, Muzrabad, and Termez. \n PPTA estimates of the proposed Project. \n The 2003 Word Bank study (footnote 1), Vol. 2, Chapter 2, Table 3. \n\n32\n\n31\n\n30\n\n \n\n\fInterruptions  in  irrigation  water  supply  adversely  affect  households  working  on  dekhan \n68. \nand household plots. These households depend mainly on those plots for their income (about \n60% of their income is from farming) and food needs (50\u201360% of the food they consume comes \nfrom household plots). Not improving the irrigation system would reduce the irrigated area and \nlower  crop  productivity  by  15%,  thus  threatening the main income and food sources of these \nfarm  households.  The  income  of  poor  households  employed  in  shirkats  will  also  be  adversely \naffected  by  not  rehabilitating  the  irrigation  system.  Conservative  estimates  indicate  that  if  the \nirrigation system is not rehabilitated, the yields of cotton and wheat\u2014the two main crops grown \nby large private and shirkats in the project sites\u2014would decline from 10% in 5 years to 25% in \n10 years. With lower revenues from crop production, the income of shirkat workers from wage \nwork may not only be delayed and reduced their jobs may also be threatened. \n\nThe  Project  will  not  have  any  adverse  impact  on  ethnic  minorities  and  will  not  activate \n69. \nADB\u2019s policy on indigenous peoples. The Project will ensure access to irrigation supply for and \nparticipation  of  Turkmens  in  Termez  district,  where  most  of  the  poor  Turkmens  reside,  and \nensure that they participate in the privatization process.  \n\n70.  With improved yields and increase in cropping intensity resulting from a larger irrigated \narea,  a  regular  and  stable  supply  of  water  for  irrigation,  and  improved  land  condition  due  to \nbetter drainage systems, employment opportunities will expand in the crop sector. A joint study \nof MAWR and the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection showed that a 10% increase in cotton \nyield  would  lead  to  a  1%  increase  in  employment.  On  small  farms,  a  similar  increase  in  yield \nwould increase the demand for manual labor by 2%. The summary poverty reduction and social \nstrategy is in Appendix 9 and the detailed social and poverty assessment is in Supplementary \nAppendix I. \n\nb. \n\nGender and Development \n\nThe Project will be beneficial to women. For women who serve as heads of family and \n71. \nwho  own  land,  access  to  a  more  regular  supply  of  water  for  irrigation  will  improve  their  yield, \nencourage  more  cropping  intensity,  and  increase  their  income.  Production  in  their  household \nplots will also improved. Women who take care of these plots will produce more cash crops to \nincrease  their  purchasing  power  and  enable  them  to  pay  for  more  nutritious  food  and  other \nessential  needs  of  their  household.  Moreover,  improved  access  to  machinery  through  more \neffective ASCs will significantly reduce the agricultural work performed by women and children \nmanually in the fields. Women can therefore devote more time to their household plots for cash \ncrop  production;  the  children,  on  the  other  hand,  will  be  able  to  attend  school  more  regularly. \nWith  40%  of  the  respondents  stating  that  women  should  not  participate  in  agriculture \nmanagement, the Project will develop measures that will increase the capacity of women to get \nmore  involved  in  project  activities,  especially  in  the  development  of  the  WUAs.  The  gender \naction plan is in Supplementary Appendix J. \n\nc. \n\nInstitutional Development \n\nThe Project will contribute to institutional development by establishing WUAs that will be \n72. \nmanaged and operated by the local communities. While the objective of the WUA is to ensure \nthe  sustainable  use  and  management  of  the  rehabilitated  irrigation  systems,  in  the  long  term \nsuccessful  WUAs  can  serve  as  models  for  community-driven  activities  that  capitalize  on  the \nsocial capital networks to address and resolve local issues, especially those that will impact on \npoverty. \n\n18 \n\n \n\n\f19 \n\nThe  TA  associated  with  the  loan  will  help  strengthen  the  capacities  of  national  and \n73. \nprovincial water departments.  The staff of MAWR\u2019s water resources management department \nwill  be  trained  in  policy  analysis.    At  the  basin  level,  the  new  ASBIO  will  be  supported  to \ncoordinate management of irrigation water delivery and support for WUAs.  The TA project will \nalso assist ASBIO to investigate and respond to a wider range of water resource management \nissues and needs in the basin.  \n\nd. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n74. \nAll the  project works are expected to take place  on Government buffer strips, land that \nhas  been  reserved  for  operation  and  protection  of  the  system\u2019s canals.  The  feasibility  study, \nhowever,  identified  that  1.1  ha  of  Government  land  has  been  encroached  upon  and  one \nresidential house  have been  built  on  land  where  the  project  rehabilitation  work  is  expected  to \ntake place.33 The Government assured that it would make maximum efforts to avoid reacquiring \nthe occupied land or relocating the house. Should the acquisition of land and/or relocation of the \nhouse  become  unavoidable, the Government assured that  the  EA  will  prepare  an  appropriate \nresettlement plan according to  ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy, and submit it to ADB for \napproval before any civil works contract is awarded. As the buffer strips are State-owned lands, \nthe  PIU  will  ensure  that  they  are  restored,  where  required,  and  maintained  according  to \nregulations.  \n\nB. \n\nRisks and Safeguards  \n\n75. \nA number of risks may affect project implementation. Achieving sustainable O&M lies at \nthe heart of the project rationale and design, and remains the main risk in achieving objectives. \nFailure may result from an inadequate operation framework for WUAs, insufficient organization \nand  training  of  WUAs,  lack  of  proper  water  delivery  fee  systems,  or  limited  capacity  of  the \nbeneficiaries  to  pay.  To  mitigate  these  risks,  the  Project  is  proposing  a  range  of  activities:  (i) \ndeveloping of a national policy on cost recovery and improved operational procedures for WUAs \ndevelopment,  (ii)  improved  O&M  practices  at  the  Amu  Zang  irrigation  system  and  ASBIO,  (iii) \nintroducing water delivery fees in the project province, and (iv) developing WUAs to address the \non-farm  and  interfarm  O&M.  These  cost  recovery  measures  will  be  accompanied by reduced \nGovernment  procurement  quotas  on  cotton  and  wheat  for  farmers  in  the  Project  area.  The \nincreased  farm  incomes  from  such  a  measure  will  enable  farmers  to  pay  their  water  delivery \nfees.  Progress  in  developing  an  adequate  cost  recovery  framework  will  be  closely  monitored \nunder the Project. Notwithstanding such development, the Government also recognized that its \nbudget  allocation  has  not  been  adequate,  and  assured  the  timely  and  full  provision  of  O&M \nbudget for the irrigation system.  \n\n76. \nLack  of  participation  by  farmer  beneficiaries  in  the  development  of  the  cost-recovery \nscheme may lead to default in farmers\u2019 payments. To minimize this risk, close consultations with \nfarmer  beneficiaries  were  conducted  at  every  stage  of  project  preparation, \nincluding \npresentation of the estimated per hectare costs of on-farm rehabilitation. \n\nPolicy deficiencies remain in the overall economy and in the agriculture sector including \n77. \nState  involvement  in  fixing  prices,  and  the  remaining  (although  in  a  substantially  reduced \nvolume)  and  mandatory  State  procurement  quota  for  cotton  and  wheat.  The  farm  budget \n\n                                                 \n33\n\n According to Government Decree No. 174 issued in 1992, construction of farm buildings is allowed in the buffer \nzones. \n\n \n\n\fanalysis is based on the assumption that these policy deficiencies will be removed within a 10-\nyear period.  \n\n78. \nThe  proposed  Project  will  be  ADB\u2019s  first  major  investment  in  the  water  sector  and  the \nthird  with  MAWR.34  The  risk  of  implementation  delays  arising  from  MAWR\u2019s  limited  familiarity \nwith  ADB  procedures  has  been  partly  mitigated  by  involving  MAWR  staff  during  project \nprocessing.  Their  knowledge  of  ADB\u2019s  procedures  will  be  enhanced  through  seminars  and \nduring  the  administration  missions.  In  addition,  international  and  domestic  consultants  will  be \nrecruited  to  (i)  help  the  PMO  and  the  PIU  to  set  up  appropriate  operational  systems, and (ii) \nprovide hands-on training to the project staff. \n\n79. \nIncorporating  lessons  learned,  the  Project  will  establish  its  implementation  structure  at \nan  early  stage.  Staff  of  the  offices  that  will  be  involved  in  project  implementation  have \nparticipated in project design to foster a sense of ownership of the Project and strengthen their \ncommitment to project implementation. Since MAWR has a sufficient number of technical staff \nexperienced  in  designing  and  constructing  such  infrastructure,  the  risk  of  the  EA\u2019s  lack  of \ntechnical competence is judged as insignificant. Furthermore, MAWR gave the assurance that \nqualified and experienced staff acceptable to ADB will be assigned to these offices; measures \nwill be taken to avoid staff turnover; and additional MAWR staff will be assigned to the PMO and \nthe PIU to support project implementation, whenever necessary. \n\n80. \nPotential delays in the release of counterpart funds, slow internal approval procedures of \nthe  Government  for  the  use  of  loan  proceeds,  and  lack  of  cooperation  among  Government \nagencies  may  delay  procurement  and  consultant  recruitment.  These  systematic  issues  have \nbeen  brought  to  the  attention  of  top  Government  officials,  and  the  Government  gave  the \nassurance  that  counterpart  funds  will  be  adequate  and  timely  during  the  project  period.  The \ninterministerial  PSC  will  identify  and  resolve  issues  that  need  coordination  among  multiple \nGovernment agencies. The authority to approve for project implementation has been delegated \nto  the  project  manager.  ADB\u2019s  loan  review  missions  will  closely  monitor  the  actual \nimplementation of these arrangements and develop remedial measures accordingly. \n\n81. \nAt  the  project  level,  the  benefits  of  the  investment  will  be  much  reduced  if  (i)  the  farm \nprivatization process is delayed, (ii) old farm management practices and administrative controls \nover production and marketing are not eliminated, or (iii) the marketing arrangements for cotton \nare not improved.  In general, the informal barriers to trade and to a fair return to the producer \nmust  be  significantly  reduced  if  farmers  are  to  achieve  any  measurable  benefit  from  growing \ncotton.

WATER SECTOR ANALYSIS \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nIn Uzbekistan 10% of the land area is cultivable and of the cultivable area of 4.8 million \n1. \nhectares  (ha),  88%  is  irrigated.  Irrigated  agriculture  accounts  for  35%  of  the  gross  domestic \nproduct, 35% of foreign exchange receipts, and 45% of employment. The most important crop is \ncotton,  which  accounts  for  about  30%  of  export  earnings  or  about  $1  billion  annually.  Since \nindependence from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Government has found it difficult \nto  allocate  sufficient  resources  for  irrigation  system  maintenance.  However,  it  is  now  taking \nsteps  to  increase  investment  in  the  sector,  rehabilitate  irrigation  and  drainage  (I&D) \ninfrastructure, and improve farm sustainability. \n\n2. \nThe  agriculture  development  strategy  centers  on  three  strategic  goals  to:  (i)  generate \nforeign  exchange  earnings,  (ii)  improve  food  security,  and  (iii)  promote  rural  employment  and \nimprove  living  standards.  Achievement  of  these  goals  depends  on  the  transformation  to  a \ncompetitive, market-oriented rural economy. In 2000 the Government outlined an action plan for \n2001\u20132003 for economic reforms in agriculture that emphasizes promoting farm and enterprise \nprivatization,  improving  agricultural  financial  systems,  building  central  and  local  institutional \ncapacity, improving irrigation and drainage infrastructure, and relaxing Government restrictions \non  pricing  and  state  crop  procurement.  A  recent  presidential  decree  reaffirmed  these  goals,1 \nincluding  recognition  of  the  important  role  of  private  farms,  improved  technology,  institutional \nrestructuring  focusing  on  a  new  basin-oriented  irrigation  management  system,  and  greater \ndependence on market principles in agriculture and irrigation at all levels. \n\nB. \n\nAgriculture and Land Policies \n\n1. \n\nProcurement and Pricing  \n\n3. \nSeveral regulations remaining from the former centrally planned system have distorted \nagricultural  production.  Of  these,  the  most  important  has  been  the  system  of  annual  State \norders to agricultural enterprises and farms for the production of cotton and wheat.  In 2001 the \nGovernment  agreed  to  test  reforms  to  this  system2  centered  on  (i)  abolishing  or  easing  \nproduction  targets,  (ii)  reducing  the  mandatory  crop  procurement  quotas,  (iii)  abolishing  joint \nresponsibility  for  procurement  quotas,  (iv)  adjusting  of  state  procurement  prices  based  on \nchanges  in  international  prices  and  domestic  inflation,  and  (v)  gradually  reducing  in  the  state \nprocurement of wheat and cotton. In 2002 the Government extended these reforms nationwide \nand  also  limited  wheat  and  cotton  procurement  by  the  state  purchasing  agencies  to  50%  of  a \nfarm\u2019s production, with the producer being able to sell the remainder at will.3 Further, the March \n2003  Presidential  decree  (footnote  1)  abolishes  the  State-directed  crop  production  targets \nbeyond the 2003 season and confirms that the mandatory State procurement of raw cotton and \ngrain will not exceed 50% of actual production.    \n\n4. \nUnder  the  State  order  system,  farmgate  prices  were  based on expenditure norms for \ncrop  production  rather  than  on  world  market  prices.  Combined  with  an  overvalued  currency, \n\n                                                 \n1\n  Republic of Uzbekistan. 2003. On the Most Important Directions for Deepening Reforms in Agriculture, Decree of \n\nthe President, 24 March 2003. \n\n2\n  The reforms were tested in six districts under the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Ak Altin Development Project \n\nand World Bank\u2019s Rural Enterprise Support Project. \n\n3\n  An established market for wheat exists, but in many areas Government agencies are still the only buyers of cotton. \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nthese policies taxed exported agricultural commodities\u2014resulting in lower returns to farmers\u2014 \nand  subsidized  imported  inputs.  Although  a  previous  policy  overvalued  the  sum,  since \nSeptember 2001 the official exchange rate has been more closely aligned with the commercial \n(unofficial) rate, the effect of which has been to raise the price of agricultural commodities and to \nmake imported inputs more  accessible.  In  2002  prices  for  wheat  and  cotton  rose  by  72%  and \n57%, respectively, as domestic prices were aligned more closely with international prices. On 15 \nOctober  2003,  the  Government  introduced  the  convertibility  of  local  currency,  which  will  have \nfurther positive effects on farm income. Future prices will be calculated in a transparent manner \nbased on work by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) with assistance from the World Bank and the \nInternational Monetary Fund. \n\n2. \n\nPrivatization of Agricultural Enterprises \n\n5. \nThere  are  at  present  three  main  types  of  agricultural  producers:  (i)  cooperative \nagricultural  enterprises  (shirkats),  (ii)  private  farms,  and  (iii)  dekhan  farms  (household  plots). \nThe  shirkats  and  private  farms  are  State  regulated  and  have  been  subject  to  the  State  order \nsystem.  Despite  substantial  financial  assistance  provided  by  the  Government,  shirkat  farms \nhave performed rather poorly, failing to increase yields and output and incurring financial losses. \nPrivate farms have generally performed better. The Government is therefore strengthening the \nlegal and enabling environment for the development of private and dekhan farms. Private farms \nwere first created in 1992, but most date from 1996 or later. This number is increasing rapidly. \nThe  establishment  of  private  farms  within  shirkat  farms  is  a  district-level  decision,  but  the \nconversion of a whole shirkat to private farms requires a decision from the Cabinet.  When this \noccurs, the water management activities are taken over by water users associations (WUAs). \n\n6. \nThe Government has supported private farming with 50\u2013year inheritable land use rights, \nlow-interest  loans,  exemption  from  value  added  tax  (VAT)  for  fuel  and  fertilizer,  and  favorable \nterms  for  machinery  purchase.  However,  private  farms  have  often  been  formed  from  loss-\nincurring shirkats or by allocation of marginal land and they must often rely on shirkats for their \ninput supply, farm machinery rental, and irrigation water.  State orders for cotton and grain and \nlack  of  access  to  Government\u2019s  advance  credit  system  have  hampered  the  performance  of \nprivate  farms.    Furthermore,  land  cannot  be  used  as  collateral  with  the  banks.    By  the  end  of \n2002, 155 shirkats had been converted to private farms, while 1,877 remained.  This slow pace \nof privatization has not been consistent with the Government\u2019s own long-term strategic objective \nof  increasing  agricultural  efficiency  and  output.  However,  the  Presidential  decree  of  24  March \n2003  explicitly  recognizes,  for  the  first  time,  the  importance  of  private  farms  and  market \nprinciples and should result in expanding the privatization process. \n\n7. \nSupport  services,  especially  for  private  farms,  are  inadequate  at  present.  There  is  a \nneed  to  strengthen  the  provision  of  support  services  for  private  farms,  especially  regarding \naccess to crop inputs, machinery, irrigation services, credit, and markets. \n\nC. \n\nWater Resource Policies \n\n1. \n\nWater Resources and Irrigation \n\n8. \nUzbekistan is situated in the basins of the Syrdarya and Amudarya rivers, which together \nform  the  Aral  Sea  basin.  The  annual  limit  of  water  available  to  Uzbekistan  under  international \nagreements is 63.02 cubic kilometers (km\u00b3), which is more than 5 times the 11.53 km\u00b3 annual \ninternal renewable water resources of the country. The reliable flow available to Uzbekistan in \nyears of low water is 54.2 km\u00b3,  of which 49.0 km\u00b3 is available for irrigation. \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n29 \n\nInefficient use of water compounds the problems of limited availability.  Although official \n9. \nfigures  indicate  over  60%  irrigation  efficiency,  in  many  cases  as  little  as  40%  of  the  water \ndiverted by irrigation systems reaches the plants. The rest is lost in the irrigation system and in \nthe  field.  As  a  result,  drainage  flows  amount  to  half  of  the  water  taken  in.  Drainage  water  is \nreused in some cases \u2014particularly where irrigation water supply shortages occur\u2014even though \nthis may lead to salinization of land. \n\n10. \nBetween  1970  and  1990,  irrigation  in  Uzbekistan  underwent  spectacular  development \nwith the total irrigated area  increasing from 2.6 to 4.2 million ha. This rate of increase was only \npossible under a strong set of institutions in the field of design and construction and an equally \nstrong  institutional  framework  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  the  system. \nMaintaining I&D infrastructure of this magnitude requires substantial expenditures for both O&M \nand capital replacement. Since independence Uzbekistan has not been able to keep up with the \nannual financial requirements, and expenditures in the water sector  have been declining in real \nterms. Furthermore, due to the low profitability of  farming, on-farm I&D systems are also in poor \ncondition.  \n\nOne  estimate4  has  placed  the  minimum  cost  of  an  irrigation  rehabilitation  investment \n11. \nprogram in the next  15  years  at  $3.9  billion  or  $260  million  annually.  This  amounts  to  about   \n$920  per  ha  over  15  years,  with  about  54%  of  all  investment  requirements  being  for  on-farm \ninfrastructure. Since the farms are responsible for maintaining most of the on-farm irrigation and \npart of the drainage infrastructure, this implies an additional farm income requirement of up to \n$140 million annually. \n\nTwo thirds of all irrigated areas in the country require pumping to heights in the range of \n12. \n5\u2013150 meters. As the price of electricity is increased toward its long-run marginal cost, the rising \ncost  of  pumping  water  will  need  to  be  counterbalanced  by  policies  to  sustain  the  long-term \nfuture of irrigated agriculture through reduced consumption.  \n\n2. \n\nOperation and Maintenance and Cost Recovery \n\n13. \nThe  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Water  Resources  (MAWR)  is  responsible  for  preparing \nthe annual budget for irrigation O&M. In the final budget allocations, salaries and electricity have \npriority over other cost components. There are no specific water delivery charges at present, but \nshirkats  and  private  farmers  are  responsible  for  on-farm  O&M  costs.  The  State  does  levy  a \n\u201cunified tax\u201d on  farms, which in theory includes a small charge for water use. This tax averages \nabout $9 per ha in the project area.  \n\n14. \nGovernment budget expenditures for irrigation O&M in 2002 were about $130 million. By \nMAWR estimates, however, the annual requirement for O&M and depreciation is $550 million. \nOf  this  about  46%,  or  about  $48  per  ha,  on  average,  is  estimated  to  be  on-farm costs. These \nestimates  do  not  fully  consider  energy  prices  and  with  an  economic  price  for  energy  3  times \ngreater than its current financial cost, this may add $200 million per year to O&M. \n\nThe  Government  intends  to  gradually  implement  a  system  of  payment  for  water  along \n15. \nwith the establishment of WUAs, but at present there are no detailed cost recovery and water \ndelivery  policy  and  implementation  plans.  A  cost  recovery  policy  and  implementation  plan \nshould  be  developed  after  further  economic  analysis  of  costs  and  farmers\u2019  ability  to  pay  and \nshould be based on sound principles regarding (i) which costs are the responsibility of farmers, \n\n                                                 \n4\n  World Bank. 2002.

A \nprogressive strategy may be needed in which farmers take on increasing levels of support for \nlocal and major works in parallel with improving farm financial conditions and increasing levels \nof water delivery service. \n\nD. \n\nWater Sector Legal and Institutional Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nLegal Basis for Water Use  \n\nThe  most  important  legal  document  governing  water  use  is  the  Law  of  the  Republic  of \n16. \nUzbekistan  on  Water  and  Water  Usage,  6  May  1993,  with  later  amendments. Water is State \nproperty, subject to rational use and protected by the State. Off-farm irrigation infrastructure is \nowned by the State. On-farm facilities are owned by the shirkats, or by associations that have \nassumed their rights and obligations. Entities that have been granted isolated (primary) usage of \nwater  have  the  obligation  to  permit  other  entities  and  citizens  secondary  water  usage,  by \nagreement  with  MAWR  and  the  State  Committee  on  Nature  Conservation.  This  appears  to \nprovide a legal basis for the regulation of water deliveries between a WUA and its members.  \n\n17. \nThe  Cabinet  of  Ministers  has  jurisdiction  to  establish  a  procedure  for  paying  for  water \nusage  and  compensation  for  polluting  and  exhausting  water  resources.  Water  users  are \nencouraged to carry out irrigation and land improvement work and the Land Code provides for \ntax,  loan,  and  other  advantages  to  those  who  introduce  efficient  and  resource-saving \ntechnologies.  \n\n2. \n\nNational Institutions \n\n18. \nThe  most  important  central  institution  in  the  field  of  irrigation  and  drainage  is  MAWR.   \nMAWR was formed in 1997 by the merger of the Ministry of Melioration and Water Management \nand the Ministry of Agriculture. MAWR  has offices at central, province, and district levels. It is \ncurrently being restructured and reorganized and its new role 5 includes (i) formulating policies, \n(ii)  improving  and  introducing  modern  technology,  and  (iii)  coordinating  agencies  and  service \nenterprises that should perform on market-based principles. In addition, a fundamental change \nis  being  made  at  the  local  level  with  the  introduction  of  a  basin-based  water  resources \nmanagement system and market principles in irrigation water management (para. 15). Also, the \noverall structure will be streamlined and decentralized to provincial, district, and basin levels.  \n\n19. \nThe water resource management department of MAWR is expected to refocus its efforts \nand be more effective in policy development, regulation, and other priority areas of irrigation and \nwater resource management.6 Eventually, MAWR may need to clearly separate between water \nresources management activities and irrigation service activities to carry out these functions in a \nprofessional and neutral manner.  \n\n                                                 \n5\n  The  most  recent  definition  is  in  the  Presidential  Decree  of  24  March  2003.    The  details  are  in  Republic  of \nUzbekistan. 2003. Improvement of Activity Arrangements of the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources of the \nRepublic of Uzbekistan. Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers, 28 June. \n\n6\n  In many countries the following functions are typically recognized as part of overall water resource management: (i) \npolicy  and  legislation,  (ii)  water  resource  assessment  and  information  management,  (iii)  integrated  planning  and \nstrategy  development,  (iv)  water  allocation  and  water  quality  management,  (v)  international  water  issues,  (vi) \nconflict resolution, and (vii) public awareness and education. \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n31 \n\n20.  MAWR  will  need  to  establish  a  unit  at  either  the  central  or  provincial  level  to  monitor, \nsupport, and regulate local WUAs. These WUAs will be set up nationally and some oversight is \nrequired to register them, to establish official performance criteria and monitor performance, to \nresolve issues and complaints, and to provide or coordinate training and other support. Specific \nobjectives, roles, and procedures of such a unit will have to be defined and tested. \n\n3. \n\nLocal Institutions \n\nUntil  June  2003,  the  institutional  structure  of  water  management  was  essentially  the \n21. \nsame as before independence, except that the provincial and district authorities now dealt with \nshirkats and a growing number of private farms. This institutional structure had, however, been \nweakened  by  the  reduced  investment  in  O&M  and  irrigation  development.  Water  resources \ndecision  making  and  management  were  inefficient  and  sometimes  governed  by  administrative \nrather than technical concerns. \n\n22. \nTo address the various inefficiencies in the water management system, the Government \nhas  begun  restructuring  the  irrigation  subsector.  Following  reorganization,  the  local  water \nmanagement  structure  will  be  based  on  10  river  basins  (hydrological  units)  rather  than  on  the \ncurrent  administrative  boundaries.  The  change  will  help  rationalize  the  planning  and \nimplementation  of  water  allocation  among  both  irrigation  systems  and  other  water  users.  The \nformation  of  basin  irrigation  system  organizations  will  result  in  (i)  better  and  more  efficient \ndecision making for water management, (ii) reduced administrative and management costs, (iii) \nimproved water use efficiency, and (iv) a greater capacity to introduce integrated water resource \nmanagement.  Although  basin  irrigation  system  organizations  will  focus  primarily  on  irrigation \nmanagement,  they  will  also  be  responsible  for  allocating  of  water  to  other  uses  and  for  water \nquality.  Consideration  is  being  given  to  the  formation  of  two  councils  for  each  basin \norganization:  a  water  allocation  council  with  representatives  from  various  sectors  (to  ensure \ntransparency  in  water  allocation),  and  a  technical  council.  Basin  organizations  would  be \nresponsible  for  implementing  the  national  water  allocation  priorities  for  (i)  domestic  use,  (ii) \npower generation, (iii) industrial use, and (iv) irrigation.  \n\n23. \nUnder  the  new  arrangements,  issues  that  will  need  to  be  addressed  will  include  (i) \nsupporting the development of policies and regulations for WUAs, (ii) investing in off-farm and \non-farm systems to improve water management, (iii) developing policies and procedures for the \nbasin irrigation organizations, (iv) introducing integrated water management in the river basins \nalong  with  setting  up  the  basin  irrigation  organizations,  and  (v)  developing  a  strong  extension \nservice and research and development programs to support improvements in on-farm irrigation. \n\n24. \nThe Government plans to use this reorganization as an opportunity for major corporate \nrestructuring in the irrigation sector and it is now in the process of reducing the number of water \nsector  institutions  to  70.  After  the  reorganization,  the  provincial  and  district  water  and \nagricultural  departments  will  still  play  a  limited  role  as  water  service  providers,  although  their \nultimate role remains unclear. A critical need in the reorganization  will be to coordinate the new \norganizations after reorganizing local water management responsibilities.  \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n4. \n\nWater User Associations \n\n25. \nAn  important  aspect  of  the  reforms  and  reorganization  in  the  water  sector  is  the \npromotion of WUAs to assume responsibility for on-farm7 water management and O&M.  WUAs \nare developing rapidly as they are seen as the only option for managing water resources at this \nlevel. \n\nUnder  a  decree  of    5  January  20028  on  the  reorganization  of  unprofitable  agricultural \n26. \nenterprises,  provision  is  made  for  establishing  self-supporting  WUAs.  WUAs  are  joint  stock \norganizations  owned  by  the  farmers  and  are  exempt  for  2  years,  from  payment  of  VAT  and \nincome and property taxes.  Under this decree, irrigation infrastructure on the reorganized farm \nbecomes the property of the WUA and the inter-farm irrigation structures are transferred to the \nterritorial divisions of MAWR.   \n\n27. \nThe Government has a clear priority to establish WUAs to ensure sound water resource \nmanagement, rational use of water, and O&M management of local I&D infrastructure. To date \n268 WUAs are in operation. A number of issues need to be clarified regarding their operations, \nand in due time the legal basis for WUAs may need to be strengthened. Issues that  need to be \nclarified  include  (i)  the  status  of  WUAs  with  regard  to  water  rights  and  taxation;  (ii)  area  of \noperation, size and definition of infrastructure and equipment for which WUAs are responsible; \n(iii) status and organization of various farm types and other water users within the WUA area; \n(iv)  responsibility  for  collecting  and  using  water  charges;  (v)  transfer  of  ownership  of \ninfrastructure; and (vi) the necessary conditions for establishing WUA federations. \n\nVarious developments favor the establishment of WUAs. In 2000 and 2001, which were \n28. \ndrought years, the main focus of  MAWR\u2019s activities was on improving water delivery services \nand promoting the idea of WUAs. Starting from 2000, every region established a demonstration \nfarm to model an effective WUA for the purpose of training regional irrigation engineers. Drought \nalso  exposed  problems  with  water  distribution  and  measurement.  As  a  result,  MAWR \nrehabilitated a large number of water measuring hydroposts at the on-farm level and established \non-farm water accounting practices. MOF also relaxed the arrangements for  financing the crops \nprocured  for  State  needs  to  make  an  explicit  provision  for  allowing  farms  to  use  allocated \nadvances to finance the activities of their water user groups.   \n\nE. \n\nSummary and Project Implications \n\nin \n\nto \n\nfurther \n\nimplement  reforms \n\nThis  review  makes  clear  that  the  Government  has  already  achieved  considerable \n29. \nprogress toward a more liberalized and sustainable set of agricultural and land policies.  It has \nmade  commitments \nterms  of  agricultural  commodity \nprocurement  and  pricing,  farm  restructuring,  and  macroeconomics.  The  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB) and other international organizations are engaged in policy dialogue in these areas \nand should continue to assist the Government to achieve agreed-upon objectives. Although the \nAmu Zang project is not expected to have a direct impact on the achievement of these overall \nagricultural  and  land  policy  reforms,  the  Project  will  assist  the  Government  in  furthering  a \nnumber  of  important  water  sector  reform  issues,  including  (i)  the  development  of  a  national \nO&M  policy,  (ii)  institutional  development  of  WUAs,  and  (iii)  the  development  of  a  mechanism \n                                                 \n7\n  WUA is usually formed with responsibility for the area of a former (or existing) shirkat, and \u201con-farm\u201d refers to all \nthe I&D infrastructure in the territory of the shirkat, including channels and drains connecting individual private and \ndekhan farms. \u201cInterfarm\u201d refers to the infrastructure connecting farms at the shirkat level. \n\n8\n  Republic  of  Uzbekistan.  2002.

Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers No.8,  5 January. \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n33 \n\nfor  and  the  introduction  of  water  delivery  fees.  In  addition  the  Project  should continue ADB\u2019s \nearlier  policy  reform  dialogue  with  the  Government  on  issues  relating  to  the  procurement  of \nwheat and cotton. \n\nThe Government has made a general commitment to adopt a market orientation in water \n30. \nresource  management.  As  indicated,  the  policy  should  be  developed  on  the  basis  of  sound \nprinciples and guidelines that are acceptable to the Government at the outset and on financial \nanalysis of water users\u2019 ability to pay and consultation with stakeholders.  \n\n31. \nThe  Government  has  already  taken  steps  toward  reform  of  water  sector  institutional \narrangements,  and  the  orientation  and  role  of  MAWR  are  being  updated  to  emphasize  policy \nand  regulation.  The  establishment  of  basin  irrigation  organizations  will  help  rationalize  water \nallocation  within  hydrological  units.  These  organizations  will  give  an  opportunity  to  reform  and \ndownsize  the  administrative  structure  in  the  irrigation  sector.  These  changes  also  present  the \nopportunity to introduce a more integrated water resource management approach.   \n\nThe  Government  is  also  emphasizing  the  establishment  and  strengthening  of  WUAs.   \n32. \nThese associations have a key role to play in delivering water to farm fields and maintaining the \nlocal irrigation works system. The Project will support WUA establishment and strengthening on \na pilot basis within the project area. The Project should help the Government to clarify the roles \nand  relationships  of  the  various  agencies.  These  will  be  important  steps  in  implementing \nsustainable development of water resources in the project area and beyond. \n\n33. \nImproving  water  allocation  and  other  policies  for  economic,  social,  and  environmental \nobjectives may be needed. Topics such as water rights and licensing, coordinated (conjunctive) \nmanagement  of  groundwater  and  surface  water,  water  resources  information  management, \nwater conservation and demand management, and coordination and conflict resolution could be \nimportant topics for improving future water resource management. \n\n \n\n\f34\n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \nProject \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMAJOR EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE IN AGRICULTURE AND WATER SECTORS \n \n\nCotton Subsector Improvement \nRural Enterprise Support Project (Appraisal) \n\nFunding \nSource \n\n \n\nAmount \n($\u2019000) \n\n \n\n \nYear \n\n \n\n \nLocation \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n66.0 \n36.0 \n\n1995\u20132005  National \n2001\u20132006  5 districts \n\nKarshi Pumping Cascade Rehabilitation \n\n40.0 \n\n2002\u20132007  Kashkadarya \n\nDrainage and Irrigation Wetland Improvement \n\nWB \n\n40.0 \n\n2003\u20132008  Karakalpakstan \n\nADB \nADB \nEU \n\n50.0 \n72.0 \n4.0 \n\n1996\u20132001  National \n2000\u20132005  Ak Altin \n1995\u20131999  Tashkent \n\n \n\n \n \n\nWB \nWB \n\nWB \n\nEU \n\nEU \nEU \n\nEU \nEU \nEU \nEU \n\nUSAID \nUSAID \nUSAID \nUSAID \nGTZ \nGTZ \nJapan \n\nDFID \n(UK) \nIsrael \nTurkish \nEximBank \n \n\n \n\n \n\nDevelopment \n\nFergana and Syrdarya \n\nRural Enterprise Development \nAk Altin Agricultural Development \nFood and Agriculture Policy Unit Advisory \nUnit \nSupport Services to Private Farmers in \n \nFood Production and Distribution \nIntegrated Agriculture and Food Industry \n \nTraining and Education of Farmers \nRegional Agricultural Development \nOn-Farm Irrigation \nBulungur Pilot Integrated Development \n \nSmall-Scale Private Agriculture Development \nFarmer-to-Farmer Training \nModern Farming \nRegional Special Initiative Water Program \nPilot Project on Diversification \nResource-Saving Land Utilization \nRice Collecting Machines for Karakalpakstan \n \nBulungur Institutional Strengthening and \n \nConstruction of Dairy Farms and Mini- Factory \nConstruction of Khorezm Sugar Refinery \n\nand Khorezm \n\nProgramme \n\nMicrocredit \n\n              Total \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.4 \n\n1994\u20131996  Fergana and \n\nSyrdarya \nNational \n1997\u20132001  National \n\n1995 \n\n0.35 \n1.6 \n\n2.8 \n2.4 \n1.1 \n2.6 \n\n0.3 \n0.6 \n3.4 \n\n0.7 \n2.7 \n7.0 \n\n10 \n\n1996\u20131998   \n1997\u20132001   \n1998\u20131999  Syrdarya \n1995\u20131997  Samarkand \n\n1992\u20131997   \n1994\u20131995   \n1993\u20131997   \n2002\u20132005   \n1995\u20131997   \n1995\u20131999   \n1996\u20131997  Karakalpakstan \n\nand Khorezm \n\n0.8 \n\n1997\u20131999  Samarkand \n\n1.1 \n25.0 \n\n1997\u20131998  Tashkent \nKhorezm \n\n1998 \n\n370.9 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, DFID = Department for International Development, EU = European Union, \nGTZ = German Technical Cooperation, USAID = United States Agency for International Development, WB = World Bank. \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n\fSUMMARY OF COST ESTIMATES\n\nTable A4.1: Expenditure Accounts, by Financiers\n($ '000)\n\nGovernment\n\nADB\n\nPrivate\nBeneficiaries Sector\n\nTotal\n\n    Appendix 4            35       \n\nItem\n\nA.

The  main  feature  of  the  Project  is  the \npumping of  water  from  the  Amu  Darya  River  through  a  cascade  of  three  pumping  stations  to \nirrigate  farms  in  an  area  where  agriculture  would  otherwise  not  be  possible.  The  main \nquantifiable benefits of the investment come, first, from the prevention of losses of production in \nthe future without the project and, second, from modest increases in production with the assured \nsupply of water to farms in the future with the Project. While the proposed reform measures will \nhave  a  positive  impact  on  the  economic  viability  of  the  Project,  these  measures  were  not \nincorporated  in  the  analysis  as  the  actual  benefits  accruing  from  them  are  difficult  to  quantify. \nImplementation  of  the  Project  will  allow  farmers  to  take  advantage  of  other  changes  in  the \nagriculture sector, including the relaxation of mandatory production quotas for wheat and cotton, \nand active promotion of private and dekhan farms. \n\n2. \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  primarily  on  agricultural  production.  Estimating  the \nproject  benefits  was  based  on  crop  and  farm  budgets  drawn  up  to  reflect  the  conditions \nprevailing in the area. Without the Project, reductions in water supplied by the irrigation system \nwill  have  significant  negative  impacts  on  yields  and  the  area  cultivated.  With  the  Project, \nchanges  in  farm  production  depend  on  farmers\u2019  responses  to  changes  in  the  farm \nenvironment\u2014reliable  water  supply,  more  efficient  and  effective  use  of  water,  more  open \nmarkets  and  higher  returns,  opportunities  for  crop  diversification,  and  reduced  costs  through \nincreased productivity. Project implementation will benefit the livelihoods of all households in the \nproject  area;  without  the  Project,  livelihoods  will  be  adversely  affected  because  of  the  lack  of \nalternative employment in the area.     \n\nB. \n\nLand Area, Cropping Pattern, and Farms \n\n3. \nThe total cultivated project area is 96,800 hectares (ha). Three main canals\u2014Amu Zang, \nZang,  and  Babatag\u2014have  command  areas  of  10,933  ha,  66,855  ha  and  19,012  ha, \nrespectively. The major crops are cotton and wheat, which are grown in around 43% and 36% of \nthe cultivated area. Fruit, vegetables, and fodder crops are grown in about 30% of the cultivated \narea, to give an average cropping intensity of 110%.  \n\nProduction  is  divided  among  three  types  of  farms:    shirkats  (cooperative  farms with an \n4. \naverage  area  of  1,230  ha),  private  farms  (average  24.3  ha),  and  dekhan  farms  (individual \nhousehold  plots  averaging  0.234  ha).    There  are  50  shirkats  with  a  total  area  of  61,470  ha  or \nalmost two thirds of the total cultivated area.  Private farms currently occupy 22,370 ha, but their \nnumber  is  increasing  as  the  process  of  privatizing  shirkats  continues.  After  10  years,  private \nfarms  will  occupy  50,000\u201355,000  ha  (with  a  corresponding  decrease  in  shirkat  area).    The \nremaining area (55,307 ha) is cultivated as dekhan farms. \n\nIn the past, the State order system controlled the cropping pattern on shirkat and private \n5. \nfarms to ensure the production of wheat and cotton, and imposed compulsory procurement of \nvarying percentages of the production of these crops at controlled prices. In 2002, procurement \npercentages  for  Surkhandarya  were  50%  for  both  cotton  and  wheat.1  State  control  of  the \n\n                                                 \n1\n  A single procurement price was applied for cotton, but 25% of the wheat crop was purchased at the procurement \n\nprice and 25% at a premium of 20%. \n\n\f46\n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\ncropping  pattern  will  be  abolished  after  the  2003  cropping  season2  and  will  be  replaced  by \nmutually  agreed-upon  production  contracts  between  farmers  and  the  State  purchasing \nagencies.  This  development  will  allow  private  farmers  more  flexibility  to  diversify  crop \nproduction. While cotton and wheat will remain the most important crops, increased production \nof  fruit,  vegetables  and  fodder  will  intensify  overall  production  and  enhance  private  farm \nincomes.  \n\nC. \n\nMajor Assumptions of Economic and Financial Analysis \n\n6. \nThe  major  assumptions  in  the  economic  analysis  are  in  2003  constant  prices.  The \nproject life is 25 years with year 1 assumed to be 2004. The official exchange rate is Sum 975 to \n$1.00 and  the shadow exchange rate factor is 1.30.3 \n\n7. \nEconomic  and  financial  prices  for  traded  goods  (wheat,  cotton,  and  fertilizers)  are \nderived  from  World  Bank  commodity  price  projections  for  the  years  up  to  2015.    Prices  were \nconverted  to  2003  constant  prices  using  the  manufacturing  unit  value  (MUV)  index  and  are \nadjusted  for  insurance,  freight,  and  handling  to  derive  border  prices.    Prices  for  wheat  and \nfertilizers were derived on an import parity basis. Cotton prices were derived on an export parity \nbasis since Uzbekistan is a major cotton exporter. \n\nPrices for nontraded goods and services and labor are based on market prices for mid\u2013\n8. \n2003.  Financial prices for these goods and services were converted to economic prices using a \nconversion  factor  of  1.0,  but  in  view  of  the  significant  levels  of  unemployment  and \nunderemployment in rural areas, a shadow wage rate factor (SWRF) of 0.8 was used.4 \n\n9. \nThe  most  important  crops  are  cotton  and  wheat.  Present  yields  are  based  on  project \nsurveys and data from local government agencies in Surkhandarya Province. Present yields of \ncotton in the project area average 2.8 tons per ha. Average yields of wheat are 3.0 tons per ha \nfor private and shirkat farms and 3.8 tons per ha for dekhan farms. \n\n10.  Without  the  Project,  yields  are  expected  to  decline.  With  no  rehabilitation,  pumping \nefficiency and the volumes of water delivered during peak pumping period from June to August \nat  Amu  Zang  I  and  II  stations  will  decline  over  time5  although  outside  the  peak  period,  water \ndelivery  will  be  little  affected.  Reductions  in  the  water  available  to  farmers  during  the  main \ncropping season will lead to reductions in area planted or to water stress, causing reductions in \ncrop yields. To estimate the impact of water reductions on yields,  a crop yield\u2013water response \nratio of 0.85 for cotton and wheat was assumed.6 Since specific ratios for other crops were not \navailable, the same ratio was assumed for these crops as well. \n\n11. \nFor Amu Zang I and II stations, a decline in pumping efficiency of half the potential level \nwas assumed on average over the next 10 years.  Reduced deliveries during the peak season \n\n                                                 \n2\n  This is one of the measures in the Republic of Uzbekistan. 2003.  On the Most Important Directions for Deepening \n\nReforms in Agriculture, Decree of the President. 24 March 2003. \n\n3\n  This is the same as that used in the analysis for the proposed Grain Productivity Improvement Project.   \n4\n  The  same  SWRF  was  used  for  the  Grain  Productivity  Improvement  Project  and  the  Ak  Altin  Agricultural \n\nDevelopment Project. \n\n5\n  If maintenance continues at present levels, the potential rate of decline at Amu Zang I and II stations is about 5% \nper year during the peak pumping season.  The pumping data for these stations  indicates that the decline is not yet \nso high, but on technical grounds these levels are expected in the coming years. \n\n6\n  This ratio was used for the World Bank  Karshi Pumping Cascade Rehabilitation Project. Similar conditions apply in \n\nSukhandarya province. \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n47 \n\n(June\u2013August) will affect all crops except wheat, which is grown through the winter and spring \nand has a relatively low water requirement. Furthermore, on the Zang canal (which accounts for \ntwo  thirds  of  the  whole  command  area),  wheat  is  principally  irrigated  by  gravity  flow from the \nSurkhandarya  River.  Cotton  yields  in  the  areas  dependent  on  these  two  pumping  stations  will \nfall from 2.8 tons to 2.3 tons per ha over 10 years. Wheat yields will be unchanged. \n\n12. \nThe  decline  in  efficiency  at  Babatag  will  be  higher  than  at  the  other  stations  and  is \nexpected to be 10% per year or higher.  Wheat will also be affected to some extent as there is \nno alternative gravity flow available and the condition of the pumps is poor. Without the Project, \ncotton yields will fall from 2.7 to 1.8 tons per ha and wheat yields from 3.0 to 2.5 tons for private \nand shirkat farms and from 3.8 to 3.2 tons per ha for dekhan farms. \n\n13.  With the Project, increases in yield and cropping intensities throughout the project area \nwill  result  from  dependable  irrigation  supplies,  improved  drainage,  and  adoption  of  improved \ntechnologies  following  full  rehabilitation  of  the  system.  Average  yields  will  increase  gradually, \nbut will not exceed an upper limit defined by the yield potential of each crop,  derived from the \naverage Bonitet (fertility) rating for the project area. Cotton yields are assumed to increase from \n2.8 to 3.4 tons per ha for private farms and  from 2.8 to 3.1 tons for shirkats.  Wheat yields will \nincrease  from  3.8  to  4.7  tons  per  ha  for  dekhan  farms,  from  3.0  to  3.7  tons  per  ha  for  private \nfarms  and  from  3.0  to  3.4  tons  per  ha  for  shirkats.  These  are  conservative  assumptions \ncompared with the best practice among project area farmers. \n\nThe present overall cropping intensity is 110%.7 This will fall to 91% without the Project, \n14. \nequivalent to a reduction in cultivated area of 18,400 ha. About half of this reduction in cultivated \narea is on the Babatag canal. With the Project, cropping intensity increases to 123% overall as a \nresult  of  crop  diversification  and  increased  production  of  fruit,  vegetables,  and  fodder.  This  is \nequivalent to an additional 12,600 ha of crops grown each year. \n\nto \n\nThe  pumping  cost  of  water  is  a  significant  resource  cost  in  agriculture  and  is  directly \n15. \nproportional \nis \nSUM13.2/kilowatt-hour (kWh), the price applied for the water sector in mid-2003. The economic \nprice is $0.03/kWh which is the estimated long-run marginal cost used by energy analysts at the \nCountry Office of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in Tashkent.  \n\nthe  price  of  electricity.  The \n\nfinancial  price  used \n\nthe  analysis \n\nin \n\n16. \nAt present the Government imposes a high implicit tax on the agriculture sector through \ncontrolled  procurement  prices  for  cotton  and  wheat, which are around 50% below their border \nprices  at  equilibrium  exchange  rates.  Implicit  taxes  are  achieved  through  an  overvalued \nexchange rate regime, failure to rebate value added tax on cotton fiber exports, and high trade \ncommissions  and  transport  deductions  set  by  the  State  enterprises,  which  monopolize  both \ndomestic and export cotton trade. Farmers also pay the so-called \u201cunified tax\u201d at nominal rate.  \nThe actual rates of the unified tax depends on land type and the tax is different for irrigated and \nnonirrigated  lands.  The  rates  of  the  unified  tax  are  annually  approved  by  the  Cabinet  of \nMinistries  for  each  district.  The  average  unified  tax  for  irrigated  land  is  estimated  at \nSUM9,000/ha or $9.2/ha.  \n\n17. \nThe  Government  also  gives  substantial  amounts  of  subsidy  to  agriculture.  The  main \nsubsidies are for (i) fertilizer, (ii) fuel, (iii) hire charges for tractors and combines, and (iv) credit \nfor state-procured commodities.  \n\n                                                 \n7\n  This is the average for the project area.  For dekhan farms, the average is 140%. \n\n\f48\n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nAccording  to  the  World  Bank,8  the  agriculture  sector  has  been  more  taxed  than \n18. \nsubsidized on the whole and net transfer of resources from agriculture to other sectors has been \ntaking place. The World Bank estimated that the net taxation of the agriculture sector until 2001 \nvaried between $500 million and $1 billion annually. In 2001, however, this amount was reduced \nsubstantially mainly because of a one-time write-off of farm debts by the Government.  In 2000, \nthe net taxation of the agriculture sector was around 10% of the gross domestic product, which \ndeclined to around 1%.  \n\nIn the Amu Zang irrigation system area, the Government imposes high implicit taxes on \n19. \nfarms through procurement and pricing systems for cotton and wheat. The implicit tax9 on farm \nproduction is estimated at $33.2 million per annum.  \n\nOn  the  other  hand,  the  irrigation  system  and  the  related  agriculture  production  also \n20. \ninvolve  high  subsidies.  The  total  subsidies  to  the  Amu  Zang  Irrigation  system  and  related \nfarming  are  estimated  at  $24.4  million  per  annum.  The  breakdown  is  as  follows: (i) electricity, \n$13.6  million;10  (ii)  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  pumps  and  canals,  $1.7  million;  (iii) \ndesilting, $0.4 million; (iv) subsidies related to direct farm operations, $8.6 million (fertilizer, fuel, \nand  hire  charges  for  tractors  and  combines  and  other  subsidies;  or  $140/ha).  Comparing  the \nimplicit taxes and direct and indirect subsidies demonstrates that, on the whole, farmers in the \nAmu  Zang  irrigation  system  area  pay  the  Government  a  net  implicit  tax  of  $8.8  million  (the \ndifference  between  total  annual  tax  of  $33.2  million  and  total  annual  subsidy  of  $24.4  million). \nThis  is  consistent  with  the  overall  finding  that  the  agriculture  sector  has  been  taxed  as  a  net \n(para. 18). \n\nThus, removing the state order system and adjusting the low prices received by farmers \n21. \nto  their  world  price  equivalents  will  have  a  significant  positive  impact  on  the  financial  status  of \nfarmers  in  the  project  area,  even  if  subsidies  on  electricity,  fertilizer,  machinery,  irrigation  and \nother inputs are removed.  Such improved financial returns will be a strong incentive for farmers \nto improve crop yields, thereby further increasing incomes. The Government\u2019s policy is moving \nin  that  direction.  In  recent  years,  the  Government  reduced  the  implicit  taxes  and  subsidies \nsignificantly  and  this  trend  will  continue.  In  2002,  the  Government  increased  the  procurement \nprices  for  cotton  by  57%  and  for  wheat  by  72%.  In  December  2002  the  Government  issued  a \nresolution allowing private sector participation in the wholesale purchases and export of cotton. \nThe procurement quotas for cotton and wheat have also been relaxed in selected districts. The \nGovernment  and  the  International  Monetary  Fund  have  just  made  a  joint  announcement  to \nintroduce currency convertibility starting 15 October 2003. In 2002, the electricity prices for the \nagriculture and irrigation sectors (as for most other users) rose by about 60%. The Government \nhas committed to transfer O&M costs to beneficiaries through the introduction of water delivery \nfees, and to transfer interfarm facilities to water users associations (WUAs). All these measures \nare  expected  to  reduce  the  difference  between  the  economic  and  financial  prices  of \ncommodities and farm inputs and will reduce taxes and subsidies for the agriculture sector.  \n\n                                                 \n8\n  World Bank. 2003. Country-Economic Memorandum for Uzbekistan. \n9\n  Calculated as the difference between the economic and financial prices of cotton (and wheat) and multiplied by the \n\n10\n\nstate-procured production amount and adjusted by market exchange rate. \n This is the full electricity cost of the system at true market rate and derived as follows: the actual electricity cost of \n2002 at $5.9 million multiplied by a factor of 2.3 (ratio between the long-term marginal cost of electricity of $0.03 \nand the current electricity price of $0.013). \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n49 \n\nThe  subsidies  paper11  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  encourages  two  policies: \n22. \n(i)  subsidies  should  be  transparent,  and  (ii)  subsidies  should  be  reduced  or  eliminated  in  a \nsystematic  manner  unless  they  can  be  justified.  The  proposed project interventions are in line \nwith  these  policies.  The  implicit  subsidies  (and  taxes)  involved  in  the  Project  have  been \nquantified and discussed. The specific policy measures promoted under the Project will reduce \nthe  implicit  subsidies  and  taxes  in  the  project  area  and  beyond.  For  instance,  the  proposed \nreductions in the State mandatory quota for cotton and wheat at fixed prices in the five project \ndistricts will reduce the implicit taxes imposed on farmers\u2019 output, which will give the farmers the \nreal opportunity to  pay a significant part of the Amu Zang system\u2019s O&M  costs. This move will \nalso reduce the subsidies on cotton credit, since the cotton output beyond the mandatory quota \nis not eligible for subsidized advanced credit. Also, the proposed introduction of water delivery \nfees in five project districts will reduce the Government\u2019s direct financing of the system\u2019s O&M \ncosts.  The  proposed  loan  project  (through  its  associated  technical  assistance)    is  expected  to \nassist  the  Government  in  developing  a  national  cost  recovery  policy,  which  will  have  a  much \ngreater  impact  in  reducing  the  overall  subsidies  on  irrigated  agriculture  in  the  long  term,  since \nthe  core  of  the  expected  policy  is  to  gradually  shift  O&M  responsibilities  from  the  central \nGovernment  to  regional  authorities  and  eventually  to  beneficiaries  through  the  development  of \nWUAs.  \n\n23. \nADB\u2019s  paper  on  subsidies  discusses  five  conditions  when  subsidies  are  justifiable:  (i) \nwhen  a  project  produces  positive  externalities,  where  social  returns  from  a  project  exceed \nprivate returns; (ii) in decreasing cost sectors, where individual producers need to be subsidized \nto  attain  a  socially  optimal  level  of  output;  (iii)  when  other  distortions  or  the  effects  of  other \ngovernment interventions have to be offset through subsidies; (iv) a case of redistribution, where \nsubsidies  are  targeted  at  reducing  poverty;  and  (v)  in  the  context  of  transitional  economies, \nwhere weakly developed market institutions make the subsidies unavoidable. It can be argued \nthat  conditions  (iii)  and  (v)  above  are  especially  applicable  to  the  Amu  Zang  Project.  The \nGovernment  currently  imposes  heavy  output  taxes  for  farmers  in  the  project  area  through  the \ncotton  and  wheat  procurement  system,  which  will  cause  the  complete  collapse  of  farming \nwithout counterbalancing subsidy schemes. Also, the rural market institutions in the transitional \neconomy of Uzbekistan are weak and often absent (for instance there are no viable rural finance \ninstitutions  or  farm  machinery  services),  a  situation  that  necessitates  to  a  certain  extent \nGovernment  subsidies  and  support.  The  subsidies  involved  in  the  Amu  Zang  Irrigation \nRehabilitation  Project  are  justifiable  on  these  grounds.  However,  the  more  important  aspect  of \nthe  proposed  Project  is  that  it  will  promote  further  reductions  in  subsidies  as  well  as  implicit \ntaxes  in  the  Amu  Zang  area  through  specific  policy  measures.  For  instance,  the  subsidies \nrelated to operating the Amu Zang irrigation system will be reduced through the introduction of \nwater  delivery  fees  and  the  promotion  of  private  sector-driven,  non-subsidized  agriculture \nmachinery  services  and  WUAs.  These  measures  will  be  preceded12  by  reduction  in  implicit \ntaxation of farms in the Amu Zang area by relaxing the Government\u2019s mandatory procurement of \ncotton and wheat to a maximum 25% of historic average compared with the current 50%. \n\nD. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\nThe  Project  will  protect  against  future  losses  of  production  and  will  cause  production \n24. \nincreases  when  the  Project  is  implemented.  Without  the  Project,  cotton  output  will decrease \n\n                                                 \n11\n\n12\n\n ADB. 1996. Bank Criteria for Subsidies. Manila. \n While  the  introduction  of  water  delivery  fees  and  market-based  agricultural  machinery  services and WUAs are \nexpected to take place starting the second year of the Project or later, the reductions in Government quota will take \nplace during the first year of the Project. \n\n\f50\n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nfrom  114,000  tons  to  73,000  tons  in  year  10;  with  the  Project,  it  will  increase  to  136,000  tons, \ngiving a net benefit of 63,000 tons per year. Without the Project, wheat production will fall from \nthe present 128,000 tons to 119,000 tons in year 10; with the Project, it will increase to 165,000 \ntons to give a net benefit of 46,000 tons per year.  \n\n25. \nRehabilitating  the  pumping  stations  will  improve  pumping  efficiencies  and  reduce \npumping  costs.    For  current  pumping  volumes,  this  benefit  amounts  to  $495,000  per  year  in \neconomic prices, with the full benefit accruing from the completion of project implementation. \n\n26. \nThe  sediment  control  facility  will  reduce  requirement  for  annual  desilting  of  the main \ncanals.    This  benefit  is  estimated  at  $250,000  per  year.  The  sediment  control  facility  will  also \nreduce wear and tear caused by coarse silt particles on pumps. Because O&M costs are lower \nfor new pumps, rehabilitation of the pumping stations will lead to estimated savings of $95,000 \nper year.  \n\nE. \n\nEconomic Rates of Return, Sensitivity, and Risk Analyses \n\n27.  With  economic  prices  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  domestic  price  numeraire,  the \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the proposed Project is 19.5% and the economic net \npresent value (NPV) at the discount rate of 12% is $51.7 million.13   \n\n28. \nThe EIRR is robust.  If cotton and wheat prices were to remain 10% below the assumed \nlevels  throughout  the  project  life,  then  the  EIRR  would  be  16.5%  (Table  A8.1).    Similarly,  if \nyields  were  to  fall  10%  throughout  the  Project,  the  EIRR  would  decline  to  18.2%.  A  10% \nincrease in investment costs would lead to an EIRR of 18.2%.  If the accrual of project benefits \nis  delayed  by  1  year,  then  the  EIRR  would  fall  to  17.0%.  In  all  cases,  the  EIRR  remains  well \nabove  ADB\u2019s  acceptable  rate  of  12%.  A  combination  of  10%  increase  in  input  prices  and \ninvestment costs coupled with a 10% fall in output prices would cause the EIRR to fall to 14.5%, \nbut  this  combination  of  events  throughout  the  life  of  the  Project  is  not  likely.  The  switching \nvalues  results  suggest  that  for  the  EIRR  to  fall  to  12%  or  the  NPV  to  zero,  output  prices, \nincluding those of cotton and wheat, would have to fall by 23% or their yields by 46%, or project \ninvestment costs would have to increase by 75%. These are all unlikely scenarios. \n\nTable 8.1:   Sensitivity Analysis \n\nItem \n\nChange \n\n \n\nBase Case \nIncrease in Input Prices \nDecrease in Cotton, Wheat Prices  \nDecrease in Yields \nDelay in Project Benefits \nIncrease in Project Costs  \nInput  Prices, +10%; Output Prices, -10% \nInput  Costs, +10%; Output Prices, -10% \na  Sensitivity indicator for EIRR. \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \n\n+10% \n-10% \n-10% \n1 year \n+10% \n\n \n \n\n                                                 \n13\n\nEIRR \n(%) \n19.5 \n18.8 \n16.5 \n18.2 \n17.0 \n18.1 \n15.7 \n14.5 \n\nNPV \n($) \n51.7 \n46.2 \n29.3 \n41.7 \n37.0 \n44.8 \n23.8 \n16.9 \n\nIndicatora \n\n \n\n(0.36) \n1.54 \n0.67 \n \n(0.72) \n \n \n\nSwitching \nValue (%) \n- \n+94% \n(23%) \n(46%) \n \n+75% \n\n \n \n\n The similar  Karshi  Pumping  Cascade  Rehabilitation  Project  (Phase  I)  prepared  for  World  Bank  funding  had  an \nEIRR of 16.2%. \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n51 \n\nGiven  the  nature  of  the  Project,  an  analysis  was  made  of  the  individual  parts  of  the \n29. \ncascade.14 The EIRR is 29.0% for the Amu Zang I pumping station and 21.8% for Amu Zang II. \nA  similar  analysis  was  made  for  Babatag,  based  on  the  rehabilitation  costs  in  the  proposed \nProject.15 The EIRR is  10.1%.16 \n\n30. \nProject  engineers  estimate  that  if  the  Babatag  pump  station  is  not  rehabilitated,  its \nremaining life is only about 5 years. The original, experimental pumps are difficult to maintain. \nAgriculture  in  the  area  is  completely  dependent  on  irrigation  and  without  it  only  a  very  small \nproportion  of  the  more  than  12,000  households  in  the  area  could  be  supported  by  grazing \nlivestock. With no rehabilitation, most of these households would be without any livelihood within \na  few  years  since  opportunities  for  alternative  employment  in  the  area  are  limited.    Using  a \nmethodology proposed by a recent World Bank study,17 a comparison was made of potential lost \nincome and the cost of rehabilitation. Over 10 years, the NPV of rehabilitation costs is about half \nthe  NPV  of  lost  income,  suggesting  that  rehabilitation  would  be  cheaper  than  compensating \nhouseholds in the event of system failure. \n\nIn addition to the usual sensitivity analysis, use was made of the @Risk software to look \n31. \nin  more  detail  at  the  probable  outcome  of  variations  in  the  key  variables.  Using  triangular \ndistributions, values were defined as follows: \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\ninput and output prices and project costs: \u00b1 20% \n\nelectricity price, yields, and O&M costs: \u00b1 10% \n\nsystem efficiency: minimum 45%, maximum 60% \n\nSERF:  minimum 1.0, maximum 1.8 \n\nThe  result  of  risk  analysis  indicated  that  the  mean  value  of  the  EIRR,  with  these \n32. \nassumptions,  is  20.3%.  The  standard  deviation  is  3.2%  and  the  probability  of  the  EIRR  being \nless than 12% is less than 1%. \n\nF. \n\nFinancial Returns \n\n1. \n\nFarm Budgets \n\nFarm  budget  analysis  was  carried  out  to  determine  the  impact  of  the  Project  on  farm \n33. \nhouseholds and the extent of incentives for farmers to participate in and benefit from the Project. \nDekhan farms are more intensively cultivated and more productive than the larger farms and are \nthe source of most of  fruit and vegetables. The average cropping intensity on dekhan farms is \nover 140%, that on larger farms is less than 110%. Nationally, dekhan farms generated 70% of \n\n                                                 \n14\n\n For  Amu  Zang  I  and  II  pump  stations,  this  analysis  assumed  the  full,  not  partial,  rehabilitation  of  the  pumping \nstations, excluding the capacity required to supply the Babatag canal.  The full cost of the sediment control facility \nwas included and a prorata portion of the costs of the other project components was included. \n Thirty  percent  of  other  infrastructure  costs  were  included  since  Babatag  has  this  percentage  of  system  capacity.   \nCosts for other project components are prorated according to command area. \n ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects notes that, \u201cThe Bank would expect to accept independent \nprojects  and  subprojects  with  an  EIRR  between  10  and  12%  for  which  additional  unvalued  benefits  can  be \ndemonstrated, and where they are expected to exceed unvalued costs.\u201d (para.140 of the Guidelines). \n In World Bank. 2003.  Irrigation in Central Asia: Social, Economic and Environmental Considerations.

The output of shirkats during the same period was more or less unchanged. \n\nFor  each  farm  type,  farm  budgets  were  prepared  for  each  main  canal  to  reflect  the \n\n34. \ndifferent pumping costs of water.  Other assumptions were the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nFarm  size  is  the  present  average  for  each  type  of  farm  for  each  canal;  the \nprivatization  of  shirkats  reduces  the  area  of  shirkats  and  increases  the  number \nand total area of private farms. \n\nPresent  cropping  patterns  are  based  on  provincial  government  data  for  2002. \nShirkat and private farms grow mostly cotton and wheat, and dekhan farms grow \nwheat  and  other  crops.  Future  cropping  patterns  will  reflect  greater  crop \ndiversification.  \n\nThe costs of crop production reflect the use of machinery by private and shirkat \nfarms, generally higher labor usage by shirkat than by private farms, and the use \nof labor-intensive production methods on dekhan farms. \n\nCurrent  yields  are  similar  for  private  and  shirkat  farms  but  generally  higher for \ndekhan farms. Over 10 years, yields will increase by 15\u201320% depending on the \ncrop  and  farm  type,  with  private  farms  having  larger  productivity  increases  than \nshirkats. \n\nthe pumping costs of water are estimated based on farm cropping characteristics \nand the estimated per cubic meter (m3) energy requirements for pumping water \nand its location; future per m3 energy requirements decrease for any rehabilitated \npumping station. \n\nSince  the  Government  is  committed  to  introducing  charges  for  O&M  over  time, \npartial recovery of O&M costs was included in the farm budgets on the following \nbasis: (a) maintenance of on-farm systems at $6 per ha per year; (b) O&M for the \npump  stations,  excluding  energy  costs,  at  $3  per  ha  per  year;  (c)  O&M  of  the \nmain  canal  system  at  $7  per  ha  per  year;  and  (d)  20%  of  estimated  water \npumping costs.  These costs are phased in over 6 years, starting in project year \n2.  \n\n35. \nFarm  net  incomes  for  the  proposed  project  are  given  in  Table  A8.2.  Net  incomes  both \nexcluding and including pumping costs are shown. These are 3\u20134 times higher for farms on the \nBabatag  canal  than  for  those  on  the  Amu  Zang  canal.  On  the  Zang  canal,  pumping  costs  are \nonly  10%  more  than  for  the  Amu  Zang  canal,  despite  the  higher  lift,  since  45%  of  annual \nrequirements are supplied by gravity from the Surkhandarya River. \n\nAs the farm net income analysis shows, the Project leads to increased incomes for farm \n36. \nhouseholds.    Using  the  cost  recovery  measures  described  in  para.  34,  in  terms  of  financial \nprices, the net income for shirkats will increase from about $175 per ha now to $207 per ha by \nyear 5 and $254 by year 10.  Net incomes for private farms will increase from $123 per ha now \nto $242 per ha in year 5 and to $356 per ha in year 10. For dekhan farms the expected increase \nis from $721 per ha now to $806 per ha in year 5 and $936 per ha in year 10.  \n\n37. \nThe recovered O&M costs amount to $22.50 per ha on the Amu Zang canal, $24 per ha \non the Zang canal, and $43 per ha on the Babatag canal.  While the cost for Babatag farms is \nhigher than for other farms, cost recovery at these levels is affordable to farm households and \nthere is scope eventually to increase the percentage of pumping costs recovered from farmers, \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n53 \n\nat least on the Amu Zang and Zang canals.  If a private farm on the Zang canal were to pay the \nfull pumping cost, cost recovery in year 5 would be $42 per ha or 15% of estimated net income \nbefore  water  costs.  On  the  Babatag  canal,  paying  the  full  cost  in  year  5  would  cost  a  private \nfarmer  $136  per  ha  or  close  to  50%  of  net  income.    Due  to  lower  water  requirements,  cost \nrecovery with payment of full pumping costs for a dekhan farmer on the Babatag canal would be \nabout one third of net income. \n\nIn  conclusion,  the  farm  budget  analysis  shows  that  the  Project  will  generate  positive \n\n38. \nfinancial returns for farm households on all three main canals. \n\nTable 8.2:   Farm Net Income in Financial Prices  \n($ per hectare) \n\nPresent \n\nYear 5 \n\nYear 10 \n\nYear 5 \n\nYear 10 \n\nFuture with Project \n\nFuture without Project \n\nExclude \n\nInclude  Exclude  Include  Exclude  Include  Exclude  Include  Exclude  Include \n\n721 \n\n721 \n\n721 \n\n721 \n\n \n123 \n123 \n\n123 \n\n123 \n\n175 \n\n175 \n\n175 \n\n175 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n682 \n\n672 \n\n553 \n\n650 \n\n \n\n \n93 \n85 \n\n(8) \n\n68 \n\n144 \n\n136 \n\n38 \n\n118 \n\n \n\n \n\n810 \n\n796 \n\n838 \n\n806 \n\n \n245 \n243 \n\n239 \n\n242 \n\n210 \n\n207 \n\n207 \n\n207 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n778 \n\n756 \n\n704 \n\n748 \n\n \n217 \n207 \n\n122 \n\n191 \n\n185 \n\n176 \n\n105 \n\n163 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n968 \n\n913 \n\n996 \n\n936 \n\n \n365 \n354 \n\n358 \n\n356 \n\n261 \n\n255 \n\n246 \n\n254 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n936 \n\n875 \n\n860 \n\n879 \n\n \n338 \n320 \n\n247 \n\n308 \n\n239 \n\n226 \n\n153 \n\n213 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n650 \n\n650 \n\n402 \n\n601 \n\n \n171 \n170 \n\n45 \n\n146 \n\n163 \n\n162 \n\n75 \n\n145 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n618 \n\n609 \n\n320 \n\n553 \n\n \n144 \n136 \n\n(17) \n\n107 \n\n137 \n\n128 \n\n7 \n\n105 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n503 \n\n502 \n\n165 \n\n436 \n\n \n134 \n133 \n\n(19) \n\n103 \n\n124 \n\n123 \n\n(9) \n\n97 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n482 \n\n475 \n\n141 \n\n410 \n\n \n116 \n110 \n\n(34) \n\n82 \n\n106 \n\n99 \n\n(28) \n\n75 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWater \nCharges \n\nDekhan Farms \n\n   Amu Zang I \n\n   Amu Zang II \n\n   Babatag \n\n   Average \n\nPrivate Farms \n   Amu Zang I \n   Amu Zang II \n\n   Babatag \n\n   Average \n\nShirkat Farms \n\n   Amu Zang I \n\n   Amu Zang II \n\n   Babatag \n\n   Average \n\n \n\n \n\nExclude  =  energy  costs  of  pumping  excluded  except  for  proposed  cost  recovery;  Include  =  energy  costs  of \npumping fully included. \n\n2. \n\nAgricultural Service Centers \n\n39. \nSince the Project proposes the establishment of five ASCs, an analysis was carried out \nto demonstrate their financial viability. A credit line will be provided through commercial banks to \nqualified borrowers wishing to establish an ASC. The ASCs, which will provide farm machinery \nrental,  input  supply,  and  output  marketing  services,  would  initially  operate  in  the  project  pilot \nareas  and  focus  on  providing  farm  machinery  services.  Much  of  the  machinery  equipment  in \nthese pilot areas is old and there is a demand for combine harvesters for wheat, tractors, and a \nwide  range  of  equipment  for  plowing,  cultivating,  and  other  crop  activities.  The  ASCs  would \npurchase  a  selection  of  harvesters,  tractors,  and  associated  equipment,  depending  on  its \nassessment of demand and the services it can profitably sell in its chosen area of operation. \n\n\f54\n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nEach ASC will have an initial capital of $800,000 of which at least 20% must be provided \n40. \nby the owners and up to 80% will be available from the Project. To assess the financial viability \nof a typical ASC, $650,00018 has been allocated for purchase of equipment, $50,000 for a site \nfor the center and office equipment, and $100,000 as working capital for input supply and output \nmarketing  operations.  Based  on  working  hours  and  charge  rates19  for  each type of equipment \nand  an  assumed  net  10%  return  on  capital  used  for  input  supply,  the  NPV  for  25  years  at  a \ndiscount rate of 12% is $478,000 and the financial internal rate of return is 25.9%. The results \nsuggest  not  only  that  the  proposed  ASCs  will  be  viable  but  that  they  will  also  have  scope  to \nprovide a competitive service to farmers. \n\nG. \n\nBenefit Distribution and Poverty Analysis \n\nirrigated  agriculture  and \n\nPoverty  incidence  in  the  project  area  is  31.4%,  slightly  above  the  national  average.  \n41. \nBecause  of  dependence  on \nlack  of  alternative  employment \nopportunities,  there  is  potential  for  a  sharp  increase  in  the  incidence  of  poverty  if  agriculture \ndeclines.20  Poverty in the area is associated with unemployment, employment in budget-funded \nagencies or on shirkats, and low skill levels. For most poor households the cultivation of dekhan \nplots is important for subsistence, but these households are more likely than others to have poor \naccess to irrigation21 and to lack the resources to maximize output.  Poor households will benefit \nfrom  improved  irrigation  service,  especially  in  the  project  pilot  areas  and  other  areas  where \nWUAs  are  established  and  on-farm  water  management  is  enhanced.  The  Project  will  also \ngenerate a demand for an additional 1.4 million days of labor per year by year 10 and will avoid \nthe  without-project  loss  of  1.9  million  days.  Almost  60%  of  this  additional  labor  will  accrue  to \npoor households as owners of dekhan farms or as laborers on private and shirkat farms. \n\n42. \nBased on the distribution of project effects and the poverty impact analysis, the poverty \nimpact ratio for the Project is 0.41. Since this ratio is above the poverty incidence ratio of 0.314, \npoor households will benefit relatively more from the Project than with other stakeholder groups. \n\n                                                 \n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n The package of equipment includes one secondhand combine harvester, four large tractors, a selection of tractor \ntrailing equipment, two vehicles, and associated spare parts. \n The evaluation used the detailed costs and charge rates developed for the Grain Production Improvement Project. \n The project area, Surkhandarya Province, is located in the southernmost part of Uzbekistan, some 700 kilometers \nfrom Tashkent.  Because of its border with Afghanistan, access to the province has been restricted, thus limiting \nthe development of the economy of the province. \n The  recent  World  Bank  study  Irrigation  in  Central  Asia:  Social,  Economic  and  Environmental  Considerations \n(February 2003) concluded that irrigation is particularly important to poor households, which tend to have irrigation \non a smaller proportion of their land and would suffer disproportionately if irrigation systems contract.   \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n55 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n\n \nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nSector Identified as a National Priority in Country Poverty Analysis \n \nThe  Government  in  coordination  with  international  organizations  has  facilitated  in-depth  poverty analysis, \nthe  most  recent  being  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Living  Standard  Assessment  (LSA),  and  the  United  Nation\u2019s \nDevelopment Programme\u2019s (UNDP\u2019s) study, Linking Macroeconomic Growth Policy to Poverty Reduction \nin  Uzbekistan.  In  addition,  there  is  an  ongoing  Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance (TA) \non formulating a living standard strategy.1 All these undertakings highlight the catalytic role of sustainable \nrural development as key to poverty reduction in the country.  \n \nIn  the  past  decade,  the  Government  introduced  reforms  that  would  increase  growth  in  the  agriculture \nsector  and  reduce  rural  poverty.  The  land  policy  that  allocated  additional  plots  (dekhan)  to  families  for \nprivate  use  and  restructured  collective  and  state  farms  into  agricultural  cooperatives (shirkats) intensified \nthe use of scarce land and demonstrated the efficiency of private-run farms. To promote food security, the \nGovernment undertook measures that increased the crop area devoted to wheat production and reduced \nthe  area  for  cotton  production.  The  development  of  agriculture  remains  among  the  priorities  of  the \nGovernment  in  2003  as  more  reforms  are  planned  for  implementation,  including  liberalization  of \nagricultural  activity  through  the  reduction  of  State  orders  for  cotton  and  grain,  rehabilitation  of  irrigation \nsystems,  institutional  development  through  water  users  associations  (WUAs),  and  the  development  of \nagricultural services in processing and marketing.  \n \nSector Identified as a National Priority in Country Poverty Partnership Agreement \n \nThe  country  does  not  have  a  poverty  partnership  agreement,  but  is  in  the  process  of  formulating  its \nnational  living  standard  strategy  for  improving  the  living  standards  of  the  people.  In  discussions  on  the \nliving  standard  strategy,  rural  development  is  viewed  as  a  key  strategy  for  reducing  poverty  in  the  rural \nareas where most of the poor reside. Productivity-enhancing measures (such as improvement of irrigation \nsystems)  in  existing  agriculture  activities,  institutional  measures  (like  development  of  WUAs  to  ensure \nsustainable and efficient use of irrigation water), and market reforms have been identified as key areas for \ndecreasing rural income poverty. \n \nContribution of the Sector/Subsector to Reduce Poverty in Uzbekistan \n \nAgriculture contributed  34%  of  the  national  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  2002  and  about  40%  of \nexports  in  Uzbekistan.  The  sector  provides  employment  for  approximately  one  third  of  the  country\u2019s \npopulation and about 50% of its rural population.  \n \nThe  contribution  of  Surkhandary a  Province  to  the  national  GDP  was  8%  in  2002.  The  districts  within  the \nproject  area  produced  38%  of  the  agricultural  output  of  the  region,  although  they  have  less  than  30%  of \nthe region\u2019s population. The climate of the region is suitable for producing a variety of cash crops, such as \noff-season  vegetables,  indigenous  fruits,  and  high-quality  fine-fiber  cotton.  Their  production  provided \nadditional jobs and income to the local population.  \n \nIntensive  use  of  irrigated  agriculture  in  the  project  area  can  significantly  contribute  to  reducing  income \npoverty.  A  World  Bank\u2019s  study 2  concluded  that  because  of  the  arid  conditions  in  Uzbekistan,  irrigation  of \nits  agriculture  lands  is  vitally  important  and  access  to  irrigation  water  is  directly  linked  to  rural  incomes. \nSpecifically, conversion of irrigated to non-irrigated land can decrease income by more than 30% (footnote \n2); in South Uzbekistan, a decrease of 10% in rural incomes would increase poverty incidence to 14.3%.3 \nThus,  a  deterioration  of  the  Amu  Zang  system  was estimated to increase poverty rate in the project area \n                                                 \n1\n  ADB. 2001.

Within  the  Babatag  canal  command  area  where  alternative  sources  of  irrigation  are \nunavailable poverty rate would rise to more than 50%. \n \n\nB.   Poverty Analysis                                             Proposed Classification: Pro-poor growth \n\nThe  population  of  the  Amu  Zang  canal  command  area  is  about  400,000.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  LSA  (2003) \nestimated  that  in  2000,  28.4%  of  the  population  of  Surkhandarya  region  had  incomes  below  the  poverty \nline.4  Based on an in-depth survey complemented with intensive interviews conducted in the project area \nin  April  2003,  the  poverty  threshold  was  found  to  be  SUM6,528  per  capita  per  month  and  poverty \nincidence was 31.4%; this is equivalent to 130, 000 people or about 16,500 households. 5 Poor households \nreceive about 61% of their income from agriculture. They have limited opportunity to increase their income \nbecause  they  lack  access  to  means  of  production  such  as  equipment  and  credit  and  have  limited \nresources  for  migration;  their  family  heads,  who  lack  higher  educational  and  vocational  training  and  have \nno other job opportunities, farm their household plots or work on other farms. Of the households surveyed, \n40%  spend  more  than  65%  of  their  total  disposable  income  on  food.  Only  5%  of  the  total  survey \nrespondents met the recommended standard for meat consumption, while 15.3% did not consume meat at \nall  in  the  past  month.  The  average  expenditure  per  family  member  in  a  poor  household  amounts  to \nSUM3,750, which is 3.6 times lower than the average expenses of  nonpoor families (SUM13,423 ). \n  \nAbout  44%  of  the  poor  in  the  project  area  reside  in  Djarkurgan  and  Kumkurgan  districts,  which  are  the \ncommand  area  of  the  Babatag  canal;  39%  in  the  remote  Muzrabad  district;  and  22%  and  23%  in  Angor \nand  Termez  districts,  respectively.  The  poor  comprise  43%  among  shirkat  workers  and  31.6%  among \ndekhan  farmers;  there  are  no  poor  among  private  farmers.  There  are  more  poor  people  who  have  no \nhousehold  plots  (4  times  more  than  nonpoor  families)  or  do  not  farm  their  plots  due  to  lack  of  resources \n(the  number  of  poor  families  that  do  not  cultivate  their  plots  is  1.5  times  more  than  that  of  nonpoor \nfamilies),  or  do  not  sell  agricultural  products  grown  on  their  plots  in  the  market  (two  thirds  of  poor \nhouseholds  do  not  have  money  income  from  their  household  plots  in  contrast  to  30%  of  non-poor \nfamilies). Consumption per person from household plots, translated into money income, is 2.2 times lower \nin  poor  families  than  in  nonpoor  families.  While  the  average  household  plot  size  is  0.2  ha,  among  poor \nfamilies, the plot size is 0.13 ha. \n \nUnemployment  rate  in  the  project  area  is  high  among  poor  families  (17.5%).  Low  income  from  the  farms \nand  limited  job  opportunities  are  the  main  causes  of  rural  income  poverty.  On  shirkat  farms,  low  and \ndelayed  salaries  are  the  cause  of  poverty.  For  the  dekhan  households,  which  are  the  most  efficient  and \nproductive in the use of land among the farm types, incomes are still low due to low total output. Because \nof  uncertain  employment  in  agriculture  and  underemployment  due  to  the  small  sizes  of  family  plots, \nproduction  efficiency  and  labor  productivity  if  the  sector  are  low.  Opportunities  for  self-employment  in \n\n                                                 \n4\n  The  World  Bank.  2003.  LSA  defined  the  poverty  threshold  based  on  the  expenditure  approach  to  ensure  the \nrequired  calories  2,100  cal  per  person  per  day.  The  food-based  poverty  line  for  Uzbekistan  would  amount  to \nSUM3,601 per month in October 2000 prices. Poverty head count rate was 30.5% for rural regions of Uzbekistan. \nIn the UNDP study (2003), the poverty line was based on a per capita family income required to purchase the basic \nfood  items  that  would  be  equivalent  to  2,100  cal  per  person  per  day.  UNDP  used  SUM2,916  in  2001  prices  and \nobtained  a  poverty  incidence  of  16%.  As  of  this  date,  however,  the  Government  has  not  officially  adopted  the \npoverty threshold definition recommended by the World Bank or by UNDP. \n\n5\n  There is no official poverty line in Uzbekistan. One option was to use the World Bank-recommended poverty line by \nemploying  the  same  household  budget  survey  (HBS)  data  for  Surkhandarya  and  adjusting  the  prices  to  2003 \nlevels. This option however, was not possible as the HBS data could not be accessed from the Government and \nthe appropriate consumer price index for the region were not available. The other option was to conduct a small-\nscale household survey and a rapid participatory rural assessment. The consumption expenditure approach of the \nWorld Bank was adopted in defining the poverty line; it was also improved as data on food consumption from the \nhousehold plots were imputed in determining the poverty line. The poverty threshold was verified through in-depth \ninterviews and the amount obtained was SUM6,528 (about $6.50 at April 2003 exchange rate values) per capita \nper  month;  poverty  incidence  in  the  project  area  was  31.4%.  The  poverty  profile  based  on  the  data  of  the \nhousehold survey was consistent with the findings of the World Bank\u2019s LSA. \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n57 \n\nnonagriculture  are  very  limited  because  of  lack  of  capital  resources,  underdeveloped  markets,  and \nlegislative restrictions that inhibit private sector development.  \n \nAs  cited  by  the  survey  respondents,  the  major  problems  encountered  in  crop  production,  by  degree  of \nimportance,  are  (i)  lack  of  irrigation  water,  (ii)  poor  condition  of  drainage  systems,  (iii)  delays  in  obtaining \ngood  quality  seeds  and  fertilizers,  (iv)  poor  soil  fertility  and  high  salinity,  (v)  limited  access  to  new \ntechnologies and farm practices, and (vi) high costs for transporting produce to markets. In addition, 80% \nof  the  private  farmers  surveyed  complained  of  lack  of  farm  machinery.  Moreover,  unlike  dekhan  farmers, \nprivate  farmers  are  discouraged  from  producing  more  due  to  the  State-determined  quotas  for  wheat  and \ncotton production. \n \nAlthough  the  survey  identified  poor  supply  of  drinking  water  as  a  concern  in  the  project  area,  that \ncomponent was not included in the project scope for several reasons. In view of the large investment size \nand  technical  complexity  of  the  Project,  the  Government considered it prudent to keep the project design \nand  implementation  structure  as  simple  as  possible.  The  Government  further  clarified  that  the  problems \nrelated  to  drinking  water  in  the  project  districts  are  being  resolved  through  its  own  program  as  well  as \nthrough  a  number  of  other  aid-financed  projects  including  those  of  the  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational Development (USAID) and Japan Social Development Fund. 6 \n\nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\n  A  rapid  participatory  rural  appraisal  (PRA)  was  conducted  in  April-May  2003.  Key  stakeholders  were \ninvolved in the participation process that included a survey, which covered over 500 households and 182 \nfarmers as respondents, and 57 in-depth interviews of various stakeholder groups.  Special emphasis was \naccorded to vulnerable groups, especially the poor and women. \n \nThe stakeholders of the Project include both poor and nonpoor farmers, women, farm laborers, agricultural \ninputs suppliers, agricultural procurement and financing organizations, construction organizations, national \nand  province  authorities,  land  and  water  resources  management  organizations.  The  vulnerable  groups  in \nthe  project  area  are  women,  the  unemployed,  persons  without  work  experience,  shirkat  workers,  families \nwho  only  have  household  plots,  and  communities  wherein  ethnic  Turkmens  (about  2%  of  the  project \narea\u2019s population), who are the poorest ethnic group, live. \n \nThe  project  monitoring  and  evaluation  and  participation  plans  will  maximize  the  involvement  of  all  groups \nof  stakeholders  (including  representatives \nfrom  national  and  regional  governments,  private-run \nenterprises,  research  and  educational  institutions,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  agricultural \noperators,  and  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups)  especially  in  project  implementation  and  evaluations.  To \nincrease  project  awareness  and  mobilize  the  participation  of  the  stakeholders,  various  participation \nmethods including opinion polls, seminars, consultations, negotiations, and information campaigns will be \nused. \n \nProject  evaluation  will  be  based  on  the  following  sets  of  indicators:  (i)  indicators  on  living  standards  and \nquality of life of the population, (ii) irrigation water supply indicators, (iii) tenure and agricultural production \nperformance,  (iv)  institutional  development,  (v)  employment  indicators,  (vi)  environmental  indicators,  and \n(vii)  stakeholders  participation  indicators.  Each  set  of  indicators  will  take  into  account  gender  and  ethnic \nconsiderations. \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n \n6\n  The  Government  has  ongoing  program  of  $20.2  million  in  the  project  province.  USAID  and  Japan  Social \nDevelopment Fund each has one ongoing grant-based project in the project province with a budget of $1.5 million \n\n\f \n58 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \nD.            Gender Development \n \nWhile  both  men  and  women  seem  to  have  lost  jobs  in  equal  proportion,  women  appear  to  have  had  a \nmore  difficult  time  than  men  do  in  finding  formal  employment.  At  the  national  level,  the  rate  of  women \namong  the  officially  unemployed  was  62%  in  2001.  In  the  project  area  only  34%  of  women  who  seek \nemployment  have  jobs.  Although  women  provide  at  least  37%  of  the  household\u2019s  income,  women  are \noften  employed  in  the  low-paying  jobs  of  the  state-funded  social  sector,  and  manual  and  seasonal \nactivities in the agriculture and informal sectors. The average wage of women in Surkhandarya is 82% the \nwages of men. Women employed in shirkats also have less access to social security benefits. It was also \nnoted  that  40%  of  those  surveyed  were  of  the  opinion  that  women  should  not  be  involved  in  agriculture-\nrelated management activities. \n \nLower  female  participation  rates  in  the  workforce  are  partly  explained  by  high  fertility  rate  and  partly  by \ncultural factors. Women with very young children are less likely to participate in the labor force, as married \nwomen  especially  in  the  rural  areas  are  expected  to  take  care  of  their  offspring.  A  study  noted  that  an \nadditional  child  under  5  years  of  age  reduces  the  female  participation  rate  by  more  than  7%  (footnote  3). \nAside from rearing the young and performing household chores, rural women are in charge of the garden \nplots  and  livestock  as  well  as  of  fetching  water  for  drinking.  Hence,  access  to  regular  supply  of  water  for \nirrigation and for drinking is very important in lessening rural women\u2019s burden of performing multiple roles.  \n \nThe  overall  gender  strategy  of  the  Project  has  a  twofold  objective:  (i)  reduce  the  economic  burden  of \nwomen  in  the  project  area,  and  (ii)  improve  their  capacity  to  participate  in  agriculture  management.  This \nwill done by (i) increasing the household\u2019s access to a regular supply of water for irrigating their household \nplots, (ii) ensuring that women participate in agriculture service centers, (iii) maximizing the participation of \nwomen  in  technical  and  management  skills  training  activities  and  project  designs,  (iii)  providing  gender \nand development training in WUAs, and (iv) ensuring women\u2019s membership in the WUAs.  \n \n \n \nE.  \n \n  \n\nSocial Safeguards and Other Social Risks \n\nSignificant/ \nNon-\nSignificant/ \nNone \n\nResettlement  \n  \n\nNone  \n\nAffordability \n\nNon-\nsignificant \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \nThe Project emphasizes the \nrehabilitation of the existing irrigation \nsystem. \nWater users in general are willing to \npay WUA membership fees and water \ndelivery services provided at an \naverage of $6.60 per ha per year. 7 \nHowever, 15% of those surveyed are \nnot willing to pay.  \n \nA credit line will be opened with \ncommercial banks to establish ASCs \nfor private farmers and private \nfarmers\u2019 associations. \n \n\n \n \nOutput \n\nNone  \n\nThe major reason for some \nrespondents\u2019 unwillingness to \npay is the low income of \nprivate farmers due to low \nprocurement prices for cotton \nand wheat. By November \n2003, the Government will \nissue a resolution reducing the \nmandatory State procurement \nquotas for raw cotton and \nwheat to 25% of their annual \naverage production from 1998 \n\n                                                 \n7\n  $6.6  was  estimated  with  5%  trimmed  mean  method.  This  is  the  usual  method  applied  in  statistical  analysis  to \noptimize  variables  to  obtain  more  reliable  mean,  modal,  and  median  values.  In  this  case,  the mean value was \nestimated with 2.5% range in highest and lowest values. \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n59 \n\nto 2003. This will increase \nsubstantially the private \nfarmers\u2019 income and will \nenable them to pay for the \nservices provided by WUA. \nThe Project will monitor the \nimplementation of this \nresolution in the project area. \n \nThe terms and conditions of \nloans will be agreed upon by \nADB, Ministry of Finance, and \nthe participating commercial \nbanks. \n \nSelection criteria for those to \nbe employed in the \nreconstruction activities will \nensure that the poor (including \npoor Turkmens) will be hired. \nWhere casual labor is required \nby WUAs and ASCs, the poor \nwill be given preference in \nemployment. \n\nAccess to irrigation water of \nTermez district where most of \nthe poor Turkmens reside will \nbe ensured. Turkmens will be \ngiven preference in \nmembership in WUAs and \nASCs. Capacity-building \nactivities will ensure \nTurkmen\u2019s participation. \nProject monitoring and \nevaluation indicators will \nensure ethnic considerations \nare taken into account. \n \nTraining in technical and \nmanagement skills on water \nuse management, cooperative \ndevelopment, and service \nprovision is planned. \n \n\nLabor \n\nNon-\nsignificant \n\nIndigenous \nPeoples \n \n\nNon-\nsignificant \n\n Significant number of people will be \nhired for reconstructing irrigation and \ndrainage facilities; the poor and \nunemployed will be hired for these \nactivities. However, the \nImplementation of the Government\u2019s \nplan to restructure unprofitable \nshirkats to private farms will reduce \nlabor employed in shirkats and \nincrease the number of unemployed. \nOnce irrigation water is ensured \nthrough this Project, household plots, \ndekhan, and private-owned farms will \nhave secure water supply that, in the \nmedium term, will increase yields and \nincrease the demand for labor. In \naddition, several jobs will be created \nas service providers/cooperatives \ndevelop. \n \nAccess to irrigation supply and \nparticipation through representation in \nWUAs and ASCs will be ensured, \nespecially for Turkmens. In the \nprivatization of the shirkats, which will \nbe implemented during project \nimplementation, the Project will ensure \nthat Turkmens participate in the \nprivatization processes. \n\nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities \n \n\nNon-\nsignificant \n\nFarmers groups will be strengthened \nthrough skills training that will enable \nthem to manage and maintain the \nirrigation systems and ASCs.  \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 November 2003) \n \n", "Currency Unit \nSUM1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "sum (SUM) \n$0.00103 \nSUM976 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n \nAk Altin Agriculture Development Project \nAsian Development Bank \nAmu-Surkhan Basin Irrigation Organization \nAgriculture service center \nCentral Asian republic \nCabinet of Ministers \nCotton Sub-sector Improvement Project (World Bank) \nDepartment for International Development \nexecuting agency \neconomic internal rate of return \nFinancial internal rate of return \ngross domestic product \nDeutsche Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit \nhousehold budget survey \nirrigation and drainage \ninternational competitive bidding \ninitial environmental examination \nInternational Monetary Fund \ncubic kilometer \nLondon interbank offered rate \nLiving Standard Assessment \nMinistry of Agriculture and Water Resources  \nmonitoring and evaluation \nMonitoring and Evaluation Unit \nMinistry of Economy \nMinistry of Finance \nnet present value \noperation and maintenance \nProvince Agriculture and Water Department \nproject implementation unit \nparticipating financial institution \nproject management office \nproject steering committee \nRegional technical assistance \nsupervisory control and data acquisition \nproject steering committee \nSurkhandarya Province Agriculture and Water Department \nUnited Nations Development Programme \nUnited States Agency for International Development \nvalue-added tax \nwater users association \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", " \n \n", "AADP \nADB \nASBIO \nASC \nCAR \nCOM \nCSIP \nDFID \nEA \nEIRR \nFIRR \nGDP \nGTZ \nHBS \nI&D \nICB \nIEE \nIMF \nkm3 \nLIBOR \nLSA \nMAWR \nM&E \nMEU \nMOE \nMOF \nNPV \nO&M \nPAWD \nPIU \nPFI \nPMO \nPSC \nRETA \nSCADA \nPSC \nSPAWD \nUNDP \nUSAID \nVAT \nWUA \n", " \n", " \n", "GLOSSARY \n \n", " \n \nNOTES \n \n", "Dekhan farm \n", "Private farm \n", "Shirkat \n", "\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n", "Backyard household plot given by the State to each urban and rural \nhousehold; size: 0.20\u20130.35 hectare  \nNewly emerging private farm owned by either an individual or a \nfamily; size: 5\u2013500 hectares \nLarge cooperative farm (private), converted from collective and state \nfarms under the central planning system; size: 1,500\u20132,500 \nhectares \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December. \nIn this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \n", "This  report  was  prepared  by  a  project  team  consisting  of  T.
