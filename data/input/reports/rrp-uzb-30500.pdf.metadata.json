The Project will provide \nsupport for (i) cost-effective and prioritized rehabilitation of the Amu \nZang  irrigation  system,  (ii)  improved  water  management  and \nenhanced capacities for water management agencies, (iii) improved \nagricultural  support  services  for  newly-emerging  private  farms \nthrough  development  of  rural  institutions  such  as  water  users \nassociations (WUAs) and agriculture service centers (ASCs), and \n(iv)  farm  demonstration  and  training  programs  to  introduce  new \ntechnologies  for  water  saving,  soil  improvement,  and  crop \ndiversification. The Project will facilitate the policy and institutional \nreforms by helping the Government in (i) developing a sustainable \ncost recovery policy, (ii) enhancing the procedures for developing \nWUAs at the national level, (iii) improving the procurement quota \nsystems for cotton and grain, and (iv) introducing water delivery fees \nin the project area. \n   \nRationale  Some 400,000 people live in the five districts covered by the Amu \nZang irrigation system. The people within the project area depend \nprimarily on irrigated agriculture for their livelihood, since the industry \nand service sectors are less developed than they are in other parts \nof Uzbekistan. Poverty incidence in Amu Zang area is estimated to \nbe 31.4% compared with the national average of 27.5%.  \n \nThe Amu Zang irrigation system was built in 1973 and is now at the \nend of its useful life. The reliability and capacity of the aging pumping \ncascade has significantly declined and high sediment levels in the \npumped water damaged the pumping equipment. A large amount of \nsediments  in  canals  and  drains  is  reducing  their  capacities  and \nincreasing  the  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs.  Due  to \ncanals\u2019 deteriorated condition and a high level of seepage, only \nabout 50% of water reach farmers' fields. Unless a major overhaul is \ndone,  some  of  the  key  components  of  the  main  system  could \ncollapse in less than 5 years. Any collapse of the system would have \ndevastating effects on a large number of the rural population, whose \nlivelihood are directly dependent on the system. There are only very \nfew employment alternatives in the area.  \n   \n ", "iv \n  The negative environmental impacts of the sudden decommissioning \nof  large-scale  irrigation  would  be  significant  and  are  likely  to \nexacerbate land degradation. \n   \nThe proposed Project offers valuable opportunities for the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to help the Government address important \nreform  issues  such  as  strengthening  irrigation  and  water \nmanagement, formulating and implementing irrigation cost recovery \npolicy and further expanding to a larger scale the agreed agriculture \nreform initiatives.  \n   \nGoal and Objective  The project goal is to maintain and improve agricultural productivity \nand farm income on a sustained basis. The project objectives are to \n(i) increase the reliability, efficiency, and sustainability of irrigation \nwater supply of the Amu Zang irrigation system; and (ii) facilitate and \naccelerate agriculture sector reforms in the project area.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $112.6  million  equivalent, \ncomprising $64.1 million equivalent (57%) in foreign exchange and \n$48.5  million  equivalent  (43%)  in  local  currency.  The  estimates \ninclude  $20.6  million  equivalent  in  taxes  and  duties,  and  $11.1 \nmillion equivalent in physical and price contingencies.  \n   \nFinancing plan                                                                                                 $ million \nForeign  Local  Total \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Cost  Percent \nAsian Development Bank  61.7  11.5  73.2  65.0 \nGovernment  2.4  34.6  37.0  32.9 \nBeneficiaries  0.0  2.4  2.4  2.1 \n          TOTAL  64.1  48.5  112.6  100.0 \n \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan for $73.2 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility. The loan will have a term of 25 years, including a \ngrace period of 5 years; an interest determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based fixed lending facility; a commitment charge of \n0.75% per annum; a front-end fee of 0.5%; and other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. \n   \nAllocation and   The Ministry of Finance (MOF), on behalf of the Borrower, will relend \nRelending Terms  $3.2 million of the loan proceeds to eligible private companies and \nindividuals  to  establish  ASCs  in  the  five  project  districts.  The \nsubsidiary loans will be channeled through participating financial \ninstitutions (PFIs), which will be identified during the first year of \nproject implementation based on criteria agreed upon by ADB and \nthe Borrower. Subsidiary loans from MOF to PFIs will be for 10 \nyears, including a grace period of 3 years. \n \n  Interest for the subsidiary loans will be market-based interest rates \ntaking  into  account  the  cost  of  funds,  administrative  costs  of \nproviding the loans; credit risk; and reasonable amount of profit for \n ", "v \nproviding the loans; credit risk; and reasonable amount of profit for \nthe PFIs. The PFIs will bear the sub-loan credit risks.  \n    \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 September 2009 \n   \nEstimated Project   \nCompletion Date  31 March 2009 \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (MAWR) \n   \nImplementation  A high-level project steering committee (PSC), chaired by a deputy \nArrangements  prime minister will be established to provide policy guidance, and \nfacilitate  interministerial  coordination,  and  advise  the  Executing \nAgency (EA) in implementing the Project. The first deputy minister of \nagriculture and water resources in charge of water management will \nbe  appointed  as  the  project  director  to  oversee  project \nimplementation. A project management office (PMO), led by a full-\ntime  project  manager  has  been  established  within  MAWR  to \nimplement the Project and liaise with ADB and other coordinating \nbodies.  \n \n  A project implementation unit (PIU) has also been established within \nthe Amu-Surkhan Basin Irrigation Organization as part of PMO in \nTermez.  The  PIU  will  be  managed  by  a  site  manager,  who  is \nresponsible for project implementation at the field level. The site \nmanager and other key staff of PMO and PIU will be selected by \nMAWR and endorsed by ADB. \n   \nProcurement  The Project will procure equipment, civil works, consulting services, \nvehicles and materials. All procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor  Procurement.  ADB,  upon  Government\u2019s  request,  approved \nadvance  action  on  the  procurement  of  civil  works,  construction \nmaterials,  and  equipment.  The  Government  will  also  take  the \nnecessary actions to recruit the consultants on advance basis.  \n   \nConsulting Services  The Project will provide 156 person-months of international and 767 \nperson-months of domestic consulting services to assist MAWR in \nproject management, preparation of designs and bidding documents, \naward of contracts, construction supervision, and monitoring and \nevaluation.  The  consulting  services  will  be  provided  by  an \ninternational consulting firm in association with domestic consultants. \nMAWR will engage consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to \nADB for engaging domestic consultants, using the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method.   \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  Project  will  directly  benefit  some  400,000  people  of \nBeneficiaries  Surkhandarya  Province.    The  main  quantifiable  project  benefit \ncomes from the reversal of production decline and modest increases \nin crop yields and cropping intensity. The average cotton yield is \nexpected to increase from 2.8 to 3.4 tons per ha (t/ha), average \nwheat yield from 3.1 to 3.9 t/ha, and cropping intensity from 110% to \n ", "vi \nwheat yield from 3.1 to 3.9 t/ha, and cropping intensity from 110% to \n123%. Without the Project, declining irrigation supplies will have a \nnegative  impact  on  crop  yields.  The  average  yield  of  cotton  is \nprojected to decline from 2.7 t/ha to 2.3 t/ha and average cropping \nintensity in the project area would fall from the present 110% to 91%. \n   \n  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project is 19.5%. \nThe sensitivity analysis suggests that the EIRR is robust to adverse \neffects  of  price  and  yield  declines,  project  benefit  delays,  and \ninvestment cost increases.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Besides institutional and policy risks, the main risks affecting the \nProject are those, which relate to O&M financing and to delays in \nproject  implementation.  To  mitigate  the  risks  related  to  O&M \nfinancing, the Project is proposing a range of activities including: (i) \ndevelopment of a national policy on cost recovery, (ii) improved O&M \npractices at the Amu Zang irrigation system and Amu Surkhan Basin \nIrrigation Organization (ASBIO), (iii) introduction of water delivery \nfees in the project province, and (iv) support to development of \nWUAs to address on-farm and interfarm O&M.  \n \nThe  risk  of  implementation  delays  arising  from  MAWR\u2019s  limited \nfamiliarity  with  ADB  procedure  has  been  mitigated  by  involving \nMAWR staff during project preparation and processing. The PMO \nand PIU have been established. Also, ADB approved advance action \non procurement of civil works, construction materials, and equipment \nto expedite the project implementation. Provisions have also been \nmade for adequate project management, construction supervision, \nand monitoring and evaluation. MAWR gave the assurance that \nqualified and experienced staff acceptable to ADB will be assigned \nto these offices on merit.  \n \nSustainable benefits and fair returns to agricultural producers will be \nachieved by reducing Government\u2019s mandatory cotton and wheat \nquota,  giving  private  farmers improved access to key agriculture \ninputs,  and  promoting  modern  water  saving  and  farming \ntechnologies. These issues will be addressed through the policy and \ninvestment interventions proposed under the Project.  \n   \nTechnical Assistance  An associated grant-financed TA will be provided to complement the \nproposed loan\u2013funded Project. The TA will assist the Government in \ndeveloping and carrying out policy and institutional reforms in the \nwater sector through (i) support at the national level to enhance \nMAWR\u2019s policy development capacity and prepare key policy and \nstrategy documents on cost recovery and WUA development; and (ii) \nsupport  at  the  basin  and  provincial  levels  to  develop  detailed \noperational procedures for the newly established ASBIO, strengthen \nits  water  management  and  planning  capacities,  implement  cost \nrecovery policy, introduce water delivery fees, and promote WUA \ndevelopment in Surkhandarya Province. \n   \n ", "vii \nThe total cost of the TA is estimated at $740,000 equivalent, of \nwhich $500,000 equivalent will be financed on a grant basis from the \nJapan Special Fund funded by the Government of Japan.  The TA \nwill provide for 10 person-months of international and 38 person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consulting  services.  The  international \nconsultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. Procedures acceptable to \nADB will be used for engaging domestic consultants. The TA will \nbegin during the first year of project implementation and will be \ncompleted in 18 months. \n \n \n ", "    ii \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Amu Zang Irrigation Rehabilitation Project. The report also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Support to Policy and Institutional Reforms in \nthe Water Sector, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. The project framework is in Appendix 1.  \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  With an average annual rainfall of 100\u2013200 millimeters, crop farming in Uzbekistan is \nheavily dependent on irrigation. About 88% of the country\u2019s 4.8 million hectares (ha) of arable \narea is irrigated. Irrigation water supplies come almost entirely from the Amu Darya and Syr \nDarya rivers. Irrigated agriculture accounts for 35% of the gross domestic product (GDP), 45% \nof employment, and 60%  of export revenues. Uzbekistan has a comparative advantage in \ngrowing cotton, making it currently the world\u2019s fifth largest producer and the second largest \nexporter of cotton. Cotton is grown on about 42% of the total cultivated area, and accounts for \nclose to 40% of Uzbekistan\u2019s export earnings. Uzbekistan has used foreign exchange proceeds \nfrom cotton exports to support its import substitution policy and continues to depend on these \nearnings to sustain its industrial production. Wheat is also regarded as a strategic crop and is \ngrown on 33% of the total cultivated area. As a landlocked country with limited physical access \nto international markets and with food security as a major concern, Uzbekistan has put wheat \nproduction at the center of the Government\u2019s policy of food security.  \n3.  Since independence in 1991, the overall performance of agriculture sector has been \ndisappointing. Continued declines were observed in the production and productivity of the main \ncash crop\u2014cotton. While the total national output of cotton was 4.6 million tons in 1991, it \ndropped to 3.17 million tons in 2002 because of declines in both area and per ha yield.  The \ndecline in cotton production also coincided with the Government\u2019s active promotion of policy of \nfood security through state-controlled pricing and procurement systems. Between 1991 and \n2002, wheat production increased from 0.6 million tons to around 4.7 million tons. Much of the \nincreases in wheat production was achieved by expanding the land area previously used for \ncotton and by increasing inputs on a per ha basis.  \n4.  The overall poor performance of agriculture and the relatively low international prices of \ncotton in recent years have caused widespread farm losses, accumulated debts, and declining \nincomes for agricultural producers. As a result, the livelihood of the rural population has \nseriously deteriorated.  There is at present no official definition of poverty line in the country. A \nrecent (2003) assessment conducted by the World Bank1 using 2,000 household survey data, \nestimated the food poverty line at SUM3,601 per capita per month and the national poverty \nincidence at 27.5%. Most of the poor reside in the rural areas. It was noted that seasonal \nunemployment in the rural areas reduced the income and consumption of the rural population \nby 50% on average. About 35% of the unemployed are from poor households. \n                                                 \n1\n World Bank. 2003. Uzbekistan Living Standards Assessment. Washington, D.C. \n ", "2 \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n5.  Most of the country\u2019s extensive  irrigation and drainage (I&D)  infrastructure that was \ndeveloped in the 1960s and 1970s, has now reached the end of their useful life. Deterioration \nhas accelerated since independence due to large transfers out of the agriculture sector and \nlimited  allocation  of  funds  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  and  rehabilitation.  The \nGovernment\u2019s capacity  to plan, design, and operate I&D systems is also inadequate as the \ndesign institutes, once responsible for developing water and I&D systems in Uzbekistan as well \nas in whole Central Asia, have lost most of their technical staff. Water users have virtually no \nparticipation  in  managing  I&D systems. As a result,  the O&M of the  I&D system is below \nacceptable standards. The consequences are excessive water losses, low irrigation efficiencies, \nwaterlogging  and  widespread  soil  salinization,  and  declining  crop  yields.  The \ndeterioration/losses of the resource base for agricultural production is estimated to cost the \ncountry about $1.0 billion annually in economic prices. \n6.  Rehabilitation of the I&D infrastructure is key to ensuring a secure supply of water and \nstimulating growth for the entire communities of hundreds of thousands people, who came into \nbeing solely because of irrigation development and settlement schemes. If not rehabilitated, the \ndeteriorating schemes will either become  dysfunctional or lose  a significant part of irrigated \nfarms, causing major negative socioeconomic impacts. The poor operational status of I&D \ninfrastructure also exacerbates the already high water application rates and rapidly reduces the \nquality  of  farmland  through  rising  water  tables  and  salinization.  The  environmental \nconsequences of land degradation are already substantial and are likely to matter considerably \nunless more is invested in the maintenance of I&D infrastructure.   \n7.  Recognizing these problems, the  Government places the rehabilitation of key water \ninfrastructure  facilities  as  a  top  national  priority.  At  the  same  time,  the  Government  is \nincreasingly aware that the rehabilitation of I&D facilities must be planned and implemented with \ngreat care\u2014not to repeat or extend the social and environmental damage caused by the rapid \nexpansion of irrigation systems in the past. The Government also recognizes that the current \npractice of irrigation management is wasteful and  does not promote conservation, or higher \nproductivity of water.  In 2001 the Government, with the assistance of the World Bank, prepared \na strategy2 to rehabilitate and improve the basic irrigation infrastructure of the country. This \nstrategy consists of a two-phase approach, involving a public investment program to rehabilitate \nand modernize  selected main and interfarm (i.e., secondary) irrigation systems as the first \nphase, and gradually shifting to improvement of the remaining interfarm and on-farm irrigation \nsystems driven by private investment as a second phase.  \n8.  More recently, the Government initiated several important reforms in the water sector. \nThe  recent  Presidential  decree3 promotes  the  reorganization  of  the  country\u2019s  irrigation \nmanagement system from the current administrative and territorial  base to the river-basin \nsystem, and also calls for the introduction of market principles in the water delivery services in \nthe country. The Presidential Decree of March 2003 also set a clear priority on establishing \nwater users associations (WUAs) for delivering water and managing local irrigation works. It \nrecognizes  the  need  to  improve  the  legal  framework  and  implementation  mechanisms  for \n                                                 \n2\n Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources and World Bank. 2001.

Decree of \nthe President, 24 March 2003, hereafter referred to as Presidential Decree of March 2003. \n ", "3 \nWUAs. In a follow-up resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers (COM), 4 the Government took a \nfurther step in this direction by elaborating the new roles and structure of the Ministry of \nAgriculture  and  Water  Resources  (MAWR).    This  reflects  the  streamlining  of  the  overall \nstructure and decentralization of functions to local levels.  According to the new resolution, the \nresponsibility of MAWR focuses more on policy development, regulation, and other priority \nareas of irrigation and water resources management, and the water management organizations \nat province and district levels have been reorganized into 10 river basin irrigation management \norganizations.  To  implement  these  reform  initiatives,  however,  the  Government  requires \nsubstantial financial and technical support from aid agencies. The detailed agriculture and water \nsector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n9.  Farm privatization is another high priority in the Government\u2019s reform agenda. Despite \nsubstantial assistance provided by the Government in the form of subsidized inputs, credit lines, \nand farm debt relief, shirkats5 in the past few years had  a disappointing performance\u2014they \nfailed to increase crop yields and output and incurred financial losses. During 1996\u20132001, \nvirtually  no  output  growth  was  observed  in  shirkats,  whereas  dekhan  and  private  farms \nexperienced  significant  output  growth.6 Shirkats  could  not  provide  sufficient  incentives  to \nfarmers to achieve higher productivity and efficiency and improve their living standards. Despite \nbetter performances of private and dekhan farms, the Government has been conservative in \naccelerating farm privatization. For instance, the Government carried out complete privatization \nonly on loss-incurring shirkats; moreover, individual applicants for private land from shirkats \noften received low quality marginal land. Thus far, only about 8% of over 2,000 shirkats in the \ncountry have been fully privatized. The Government maintained that its policy of gradual and \nselective privatization is justified because it avoids the large social costs associated with high \nunemployment that may be caused by large-scale privatization.  \n10.  The situation can rapidly change as the Government\u2019s recent initiatives gave a new \nimpetus to farm privatization and the restructuring process. The Presidential Decree of March \n2003 (footnote 3) for the first time explicitly recognized private farming as the model for future \nfarming and expanded the private farmers\u2019 status by awarding long-term land lease and formal \nregistration. The most recent presidential decree7 approves the accelerated privatization of \nshirkats, which would eventually increase the share of private farms from the current 12.5% to \n63.3% of total cropland by 2007.  \n11.  A  crucial  constraint  in  accelerating  farm  privatization  and  restructuring  is  the  farm \nsupport services for private farming. The existing agricultural support services do not meet the \nneeds of  an increasing number of private farmers\u2014in both quantity and quality, including \naccess to input supply, and farm machinery. As a result, private farms remain dependent on \nshirkats. Currently, most of machinery services are provided by the so-called machinery and \ntractor  pools,  the  joint  stock  companies  with  significant  Government  shares.  These  pools \nprovide services that are often costly, of poor quality, and not tailored to the needs of the newly \n                                                 \n4\n  Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers. 2003. Improvement of Activity Arrangements of the Ministry of Agriculture \nand Water Resources of the Republic of Uzbekistan, 28 June.  \n5\n The farming sector features three types of farms: shirkats, private farms, and dekhan farms. Shirkats are large \n(1,500\u20132,500 hectares [ha]) cooperative farms converted from state farms under the central planning system. The \nnewly emerging private farms (5\u2013500 ha) are run by either individuals or family partnerships. Dekhan farms are \nbackyard household plots (0.20\u20130.35 ha) given by the State to each urban and rural household. \n6\n World Bank. 2002. Country Economic Memorandum. Washington, DC.

The  Government,  with  the  assistance  of  externally  supported \ninvestment projects, recently started promoting alternative service providers such as agriculture \nservice centers (ASCs) on a limited scale. ASCs are private sector-driven initiatives that provide \nessential machinery services to farmers and additional services such as input supply, agro-\nprocessing, and output marketing.  \n12.  Another  significant  barrier  in  reforming  the  agriculture  sector  is  the Government\u2019s \nrestrictive policies on pricing and procurement for cotton and wheat that continue to adversely \naffect  farmers\u2019  incentives  to  increase  farm  productivity  and  efficiency.  The  Government\u2019s \npolicies require both shirkats and private farmers to sell a significant part of their cotton and \nwheat produce to the State at fixed prices, which are lower than market prices.8 The Ak Altin \nAgricultural Development Project of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)9 played a catalytic role \nin changing the Government\u2019s policies toward reducing the mandatory procurement quota, and \nintroducing more market-oriented pricing systems that favor farmers. As a result, prices of \ncotton and wheat increased by 57% and 72%, respectively. Similar reforms in the procurement \nsystem are being pursued under the World Bank\u2019s Rural Enterprise Support Project. In addition, \nthe Government issued a resolution in December 2002, allowing the private sector to participate \nin the wholesale purchase and export of cotton. The implementation and the impacts of this new \nresolution remain to be seen, however.  \n13.  Lastly, Uzbekistan\u2019s narrow base of crop farming that essentially centers on only two \ncrops\u2014cotton and wheat\u2014needs attention. During the Soviet period, the practice to rotate \ncotton with alfalfa was common,10 as the latter provided the necessary additional nutrients to the \nsoil and high-protein fodder for the livestock industry. After independence, this cropping practice \npractically ceased because of the Government\u2019s policy of food security in wheat production11 \nand the downturn of the livestock industry.12  Now cotton-winter wheat is the main crop rotation \npractice in Uzbekistan. From an economic and agronomic perspective the current cropping \npattern that is based on cotton and wheat is likely sub-optimal. However, at present the options \nfor crop diversification are limited. Given prevailing market conditions, farmers\u2019 know-how, \ngovernment policies and agro-ecological conditions it is unlikely that the current cropping \npattern will change significantly over the short to medium term. Shift to higher value crops is \nconstrained by the absence of production, processing and marketing chains and is further \ncomplicated by transportation infrastructure bottlenecks and the country\u2019s physical isolation. The \nGovernment is exploring diversification to other field crops such as oilseeds, groundnuts, lentils, \nbeans and maize as part of a program to develop alternative cropping patterns and water saving \ntechnologies. International agriculture research institutes with assistance provided by ADB are \nhelping the Government in this regard.13 \n14.  ADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy  and  Water  Policy.  ADB\u2019s  operations  in  Uzbekistan  are \nguided by the Country Operational Strategy of March 2000 and the Country Strategy and \n                                                 \n8\n At present, farmers are required to sell  about 50% of their cotton and wheat outputs at fixed prices to the \nGovernment. \n9\n ADB. 2001.

Manila. \n10\n Ratio between cotton and alfalfa was 5:3, i.e., cotton was grown for 5 years in 8 years rotation. \n11\n Because of the policy of food security, the Government, through its procurement quota and farm credit and input \nsupply systems, increased the area under wheat considerably.  \n12\n The effective demand for livestock output fell dramatically mainly because of sharp declines in the purchasing \npower of the population. \n13\n ADB. 1999.

In both documents, agriculture is recognized as the key sector \nfor ADB\u2019s assistance. ADB\u2019s water policy promotes, among other things, basin management \nprinciples,  developing  and  strengthening  the  capacities  of  national  water  management \ninstitutions and WUAs, as well as developing sustainable O&M policies by introducing water \ndelivery fees and greater participation of beneficiaries in maintaining and managing basic \nirrigation  infrastructure.  Since  the  proposed  Project  aims  to  assist  the  Government  in \nimplementing its recent reform initiatives in irrigation sector (paras 30 and 82), it is in line with \nthe strategic thrusts of ADB\u2019s key policy and strategy documents. \n15.  External Assistance. The World Bank supports (i) privatization of state-owned farms, \nincluding improving managerial capacity, providing agricultural support services and equipment, \ncreating  off-farm  employment,  and  extending  rural  credit;  and  (ii)  improvement  of  water \nresources management. Two projects are ongoing: Cotton Subsector Improvement Project ($66 \nmillion) and Rural Enterprise Support Project ($36 million). The European Union Technical \nAssistance for the Commonwealth of Independent States (EU-TACIS) program supports private \nfarms, pilot integrated development, training and education for farmers, on-farm pilot irrigation \nmanagement, land registration, and crop forecasting by remote sensing.  In the water sector, \nthe  World  Bank  is  implementing  the  Global  Environment  Facility-funded  Water  and \nEnvironmental Management Project, the first phase of Karshi Pumping Cascade Rehabilitation \nProject and the Drainage Improvement Project. The United States Trade and Development \nAgency financed the Feasibility Study for Amu-Bukhara Canal System Rehabilitation. The \nUnited  States  Agency  for  International  Development  is  supporting  the  Natural  Resources \nManagement  Program,  which  covers  water  resource  management,  water  conservation, \nupstream snowmelt forecasting, water quality monitoring, irrigation system automation,  small \nriver basin water management, and capacity building for water supply agencies. The major \nexternal assistance in the agriculture and water sectors of Uzbekistan is in Appendix 3. \n16.  Lessons Learned. Since ADB\u2019s project portfolio in the agriculture and water sectors of \nUzbekistan is relatively new, ADB\u2019s project implementation experience in other sectors of \nUzbekistan and its experience in water sector operations in similar countries of the region \nprovided useful lessons during the design of the Project. ADB\u2019s experience highlighted the \nimportance of (i) a strong Government ownership of the Project, (ii) proper assessment of the \ninstitutional  capacities  of  the  implementing  agency,  and  (iii)  close  monitoring  of  project \nimplementation. These lessons have been incorporated in the Project design. The senior staff \nand experts of MAWR have been closely involved in preparing the feasibility study. All key \ngovernment agencies and ministries including COM, Ministry of Finance (MOF), and Ministry of \nEconomy (MOE) were consulted frequently during project design. The province and district \nauthorities  in  Surkhandarya  and  the  direct  project  beneficiaries  have  also  been  closely \nconsulted.14 The project feasibility study evaluated the capacity of MAWR to implement the \nProject.  In  view  of  MAWR\u2019s  limited  capacity,15 the  Project  and  the  associated  technical \nassistance (TA) provide adequate resources for institutional development and capacity building. \nThe Project also provides an elaborate mechanism for monitoring project progress through a \nproject  steering  committee  (PSC),  a  project  management  office  (PMO),  and  a  project \nimplementation unit (PIU). \n                                                 \n14\n During the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) study, three major workshops were organized to \nconsult with all key stakeholders on main design features of the project design. \n15\n The institutional assessment undertaken under the PPTA concluded that the capacity of MAWR and Amu Surkhan \nBasin Irrigation Organization needs to be strengthened especially in project implementation, policy analysis, and \ndevelopment of sustainable O&M systems.  \n ", "6 \n17.  Project Rationale. The Amu Zang irrigation  system is located in the  Surkhandarya \nProvince, and comprises a cascade of pumping stations and the network of irrigation canals \nconveying water from the Amu Darya River to a command area of 96,800 ha.16  The system  \nwas built in 1973 and is the third largest irrigation system17 in the country. The system is at the \nend of its useful life, and the reliability and capacity of the aging pump cascade has declined \nseriously. Some 400,000 people live in the five districts covered by Amu Zang irrigation system, \nand their livelihood depends primarily on irrigated agriculture since the industry and service \nsectors are less developed than they are in other parts of Uzbekistan. Poverty incidence in the \nproject area is estimated at 31.4%, compared with the national average of 27.5%. Unless a \nmajor overhaul occurs, some of the key components of the main system could collapse in less \nthan 5 years. The people in the  project area are  caught in a vicious cycle of deteriorating \nirrigation service, falling income, and land degradation. If the system is not rehabilitated, it would \nlose much of its operational functions, reducing its irrigation service area by as much as 50% in \n10 years. Most villagers would then be forced to abandon cultivation, without prospects of \nfinding alternative livelihood. This will also have major environmental consequences such as \nlarge-scale land degradation and desertification.  \n18.  The proposed Project will help the villagers in the Surkhandarya Province break free \nfrom the persisting vicious cycle of worsening poverty\u2014by providing them with an improved \nirrigation system, and also by stimulating growth, and promoting sustainable and profitable \nagriculture through a range of interventions, such as farm privatization, choice of cropping \npatterns, and marketing of outputs. ADB is well placed to capture this opportunity, as it has \nplayed a catalytic role in introducing the first major agriculture reform in Uzbekistan through the \nAk Altin Agricultural Development Project.18 The proposed Project also offers an opportunity for \nADB  to  help  transform  the  present  irrigation  management  style  to  a  demand-driven and \nbeneficiary-led irrigation operation, and promote stronger accountability and efficiency of water \ninstitutions. Altogether, these initiatives will help Uzbekistan move toward achieving sustainable \nand more efficient  use of land and water resources. Replication of pilot initiatives proposed \nunder the Project will also bring about significant positive impacts on the management of shared \nwater in the Amu Darya Basin as a whole.  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Goal and Objective \n19.  The Project goal is to maintain and improve agricultural productivity and farm income on \na sustained basis.  The Project objectives are to (i) increase the reliability, efficiency, and \nsustainability of the water supply of Amu Zang irrigation system; and (ii) facilitate and accelerate \nthe ongoing agriculture sector reforms in the project area.  \nB.  Components and Output \n20.  The Project has the following components: (i) rehabilitation of the Amu Zang irrigation \nsystem; (ii) support to improve irrigation management; (iii) support to private farm development; \n                                                 \n16\n The detailed description of the project area is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n17\n The two other systems are the Karshi pumping cascade and Amu Bukhara irrigation system; both of them tap the \nAmu Darya river water within the territory of Turkmenistan, making the launch of rehabilitation work subject to the \nconcurrence of the Turkmenistan Government.  \n18\n Under this project (footnote 9), the Government agreed to relax the quota of mandatory state procurement of \ncotton and wheat for the first time. A similar relaxation was replicated under the World Bank's Rural Enterprise \nRestructuring Project.  \n ", "7 \nand (iv) project management, monitoring, and evaluation. The Project will also facilitate ongoing \npolicy and institutional reforms by promoting alternative procurement quota systems for cotton \nand  grain  and  introducing  water  delivery  fees  in  the  project  area;  and  by  assisting  the \nGovernment to develop the national cost recovery policy and improve the operational guidelines \nfor WUA development (paras. 30 and 49). \n21.  The key project outputs are (i) a more reliable and efficient Amu Zang irrigation system \nthat allows yield increase; (ii) enhanced management capacity for water systems, resulting in \nconservation of irrigation water; and (iii) better access to agricultural inputs (farm machinery, \nfertilizers, and seeds), together with introduction of modern farming technologies that enhance \nincomes. The project components are briefly described here; and the detailed descriptions are \nin Supplementary Appendix B. \n1.  Rehabilitation of Amu Zang Irrigation System \n22.  The Project will support the cost-effective and prioritized rehabilitation of the Amu Zang \nirrigation system by (i) constructing a new sediment control facility; (ii) selectively rehabilitating \nthe  pumps, motors,  and  other  auxiliary  facilities  in  the  three  main  pumping  stations;  (iii) \nimproving  the  maintenance  facilities;  and  (iv)  rehabilitating selected sections  of  the  main \nirrigation and drainage network.  \n23.  A new sediment control facility will be constructed to reduce the amount of sediment \nentering the canal network and to extend the operational life of the pumping stations. The works \non the main pumping stations will include replacement of two pumps/motor units of pumping \nstation Amu Zang I, rehabilitation of the auxiliary systems of pumping stations Amu Zang I and \nII, and comprehensive rehabilitation of the Babatag pumping station to improve the performance \nof pump stations.  Further, the Project will support the refurbishment  of  four  maintenance \nworkshops to facilitate the continued operation of the pumping stations after the rehabilitation. \nThe Project will also rehabilitate selected sections of the main irrigation canals to restore the \nsystem\u2019s original water conveyance capacity and ensure efficient and timely distribution of \nirrigation water.  \n2.  Support to Improve Irrigation Management \n24.  The Project will improve the management systems of Amu Zang irrigation system and \nAmu-Surkhan Basin Irrigation Organization (ASBIO) by  (i) strengthening their capacities; (ii) \nintroducing improved O&M procedures,19 (iii) supporting the establishment of WUAs, and (iv) \ndeveloping and installing a decision support system comprising a supervisory control and data \nacquisition (SCADA) system and an optimized water resources management model.  \n25.  The  Project  will  support  capacity  building  for  ASBIO  by  organizing  training  for \nmanagerial  staff  on  the  new  procedures  for  effective  O&M  of  the  system  and  on  WUA \ndevelopment. The Project will also provide direct support to formation and operation of seven \nWUAs in five project districts and training and advisory services to more than 50 WUAs in the \nproject province. The SCADA system will be installed to monitor, control, and automate the \noperation of the system.  Also, a computer model will be developed to improve the planning and \nefficient use of the basin\u2019s water resources. The model will simulate and optimize the operation \nof reservoirs, pumping stations, and the distribution of water to canals and various users.  \n                                                 \n19\n The detailed analysis of current and future O&M arrangements proposed under the Project are in Supplementary \nAppendix C. \n ", "8 \n3.  Support to Private Farm Development \n26.  The Project will support private farms in the five project districts by (i) rehabilitating I&D \ninfrastructure of selected pilot areas to improve on-farm water use efficiencies and ensure fair \ndistribution of water; (ii) implementing a farm demonstration and training program to introduce \nnew  technologies  on  water  saving,  soil  improvement,  and  crop  diversification;  and  (ii) \nestablishing ASCs to provide access to essential input supply and output marketing services. \n27.  Rehabilitation of on-farm irrigation and drainage systems will include (i) provision of \nmeasuring devices and control structures, (ii) improvement of irrigation and drainage canals, \nand (iii) refurbishment of essential canal lining. Within each pilot area, the farm demonstrations \nand  training  program 20 will  undertake  activities  designed  to  illustrate  the  benefits  of  (i) \nagronomically sound, financially viable, and environmentally sustainable crop diversification and \ncrop intensification technologies; (ii) soil fertility treatment; and (iii) improved on-farm water \nmanagement. The program will be organized and implemented by the PIU through subcontracts \nwith national research institutes and, where possible, supported by international agricultural \nresearch institutes.  \n28.  The establishment of around five private ASCs will be supported by providing a credit \nline for a total of $3.2 million equivalent to qualified borrowers through participating financial \ninstitutions (PFIs). The ASCs will provide urgently needed rental farm machinery, supply of \ninputs, and output marketing services. The participating enterprises will use the subloans to \nprocure much needed machinery, equipment, and other capital investments. The PFIs will \nscreen the subborrowers, as they will bear the credit risks. The proceeds of the subsidiary loans \nwill be onlent by PFIs to ASCs at market-based interest rates to take into account the cost of \nfunds, administrative costs of providing the subloan, credit risk, and a reasonable margin of \nprofit for PFIs. The detailed relending and onlending arrangements and the criteria for selecting \nASCs are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n4.  Project Management, Monitoring, and Evaluation \n29.  The PMO has been established within MAWR in Tashkent and a PIU within the ASBIO \nin Termez as part of PMO. The team of international and domestic consultants will train and \nadvise PMO and PIU staff and provide additional support during project implementation. The \norganizational arrangements of the PMO and the PIU are discussed in paras. 35 and 36.  Within \nthe  PMO,  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  unit  will  be  established  to  monitor  project \nperformance, including environmental and social impacts as specified in the summary initial \nenvironmental examination and the poverty and social assessment, and the progress and \nperformance of various reform measures introduced under the Project, according to the specific \nmonitoring indicators described in the project framework (Appendix 1). \n \n \n                                                 \n20\n This program has been developed in close collaboration with an ADB-financed RETA (footnote 13), which \nsuccessfully developed a number of new technologies on water saving, soil improvement, and crop diversification \nin Central Asia. In November 2003, ADB also approved the follow-on RETA (2004-2006) to advance the research \nworks started under the first phase of the RETA and disseminate the results to wider areas. The afrm \ndemonstration subcomponent of the proposed Project will be implemented in close collaboration with the follow-on \nRETA.  \n ", "9 \nC.  Special Features \n30.  To  advance  ongoing  reforms  in  the  agriculture  and  water  sectors,  the  Project  will \npromote several policy and institutional measures. These relate to (i) relaxing the Government\u2019s \nmandatory procurement quotas for cotton and wheat in the five project districts; (ii) supporting \nthe development of a national policy on cost recovery and improved operational procedures for \nWUA development; (iii) developing, testing, and introducing water delivery fees in the project \nprovince; and (iv) supporting the establishment of a water sector reform support unit within the \noverall structure of MAWR.  \nD.  Cost Estimates \n31.  The total project cost is estimated at $112.6 million equivalent, comprising $64.1 million \nequivalent (57%) in foreign exchange and $48.5 million equivalent (43%) in local currency. The \nestimates include $20.6 million equivalent in taxes and duties, and $11.1 million equivalent in \nphysical and price contingencies.  The cost estimates are summarized in Table 1.

After the grace period, interest will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility. \nE.  Financing Plan \n32.  The Government has requested a loan of $73.2 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project.  The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years; an interest determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.75%; a front-end fee of 0.5% of the loan amount; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement.  The Government has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices \n ", "10 \nwere its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice \nfrom ADB. \n \n33.  The Borrower will be the Republic of Uzbekistan. The requested level of financing will be \n65% of the total project cost and will cover most of the foreign exchange costs21 including the \nfront-end fee, interest, and other charges during construction. The beneficiaries and the private \nsector will contribute about $2.4 million toward the project costs for land preparation and civil \nworks of on-farm rehabilitation work and demonstration plots, equity investment, and working \ncapital for the ASCs.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n34.  MAWR will be the Executing Agency (EA) of the Project.  The first deputy minister of \nMAWR in charge of water management will be appointed as the project director to oversee \nproject implementation. A high-level project steering committee (PSC), chaired by a deputy \nprime minister, will be established to provide policy guidance and facilitate interministerial \ncoordination at the central and provincial levels. The PSC will comprise representatives from \nCOM, MAWR, MOF,  MOE, State Committee on Land Resources, and State Committee for \nNature Protection. The PSC will meet quarterly to review implementation progress and major \nissues, and determine corrective measures.  \n35.  The PMO has been established in MAWR to manage the daily project activities and \nliaise with the PSC, ADB, and other coordinating bodies. A full-time project manager, nominated \nby the Government, will lead the PMO. The project manager will have the authority to carry out \nfinancial transactions, sign contracts, and endorse financial statements. The PMO staff will \ncomprise full-time  planning,  financial,  irrigation/drainage,  procurement,  M&E  specialists  and \nsupport staff including administrative assistants, interpreters, and secretaries with experience \nand qualifications acceptable to ADB.  \n36.  The PIU has also been established within ASBIO in Termez as part of PMO. The PIU \nwill be responsible for project implementation activities at the field level and will have a full-time \nsite manager, who will  be supported by irrigation, drainage, and mechanical engineers; an \nagronomist; a WUA specialist; an accountant; and support personnel. MAWR will select and \n                                                 \n21 The Government will finance the foreign exchange costs related to procurement of Russian pump spare parts in \nthe amount of $2.4 million. \n ", "11 \nADB  will  endorse  the  site  manager  and  other  key  staff  of  the  PMO  and  the  PIU.  The \nGovernment and ADB will jointly conduct annual reviews of project implementation, including \nproject organization and staffing arrangements, and make the necessary adjustments. The \norganization chart for project implementation is in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n2.  Implementation Period \n37.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years, starting in 2004. Project activities during \nthe  first  year  will  concentrate  on  selecting  and  fielding  consultants,  procuring  equipment, \ndeveloping operational systems for the PMO and the PIU, and training their staff. The civil works \ncomponent  will  be  implemented  in  separate  packages.  Field  surveys,  investigations,  and \npreparation of designs and bidding documents will take place in the first year. WUAs will be \nestablished and their training initiated also in the first year, with most activities occurring during \nthe second and third years. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 5.  \n3.  Procurement \n38.  All machinery, equipment, and civil works for rehabilitating the system; plus vehicles, \noffice equipment, and materials to be financed by ADB\u2019s loan proceeds will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. To the extent possible, the Project will \nprocure  similar  items  in  groups  to  optimize  volume  discounts.  Equipment  and  materials \nprocurement contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $500,000 or more will be awarded on \nthe basis of international competitive bidding (ICB). Contracts costing less than $500,000 will be \nawarded on the basis of international shopping procedures acceptable to ADB. Small supply \ncontracts costing less than $100,000 will be procured through direct purchase. The award of \ncontracts will be subject to approval by ADB. \n39.  Each civil works contract estimated to cost the equivalent of $1.0 million or more will be \nawarded on the basis of ICB among prequalified contractors as described in ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement. Civil works packages costing less than $1.0 million will be carried out on the \nbasis of local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. For minor rehabilitation and \nmaintenance works whose size, nature, and location make them unsuitable for competitive \nbidding, and if MAWR has the facilities and capacity to implement these works expeditiously \nand at a reasonable cost, ADB may agree to force account procedures. The specific works to be \nimplemented through force account will be determined during implementation. The upper limit \nfor a force account works package will be $50,000. The award of all civil works contracts will be \nsubject to approval by ADB. The contract packages are in Appendix 6.  \n40.  To procure goods and services with the loan proceeds, the Borrower will need to \ndemonstrate that the local procurement procedures adopted are transparent and efficient, and \nconform to ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy.  The PFIs will certify to ADB that the goods and services \nfinanced by the loan are procured from ADB member countries. In addition, where the value of \ngoods financed by the loan exceeds $1,000,000, a preshipment inspection certificate from a \nreputable agency, acceptable to ADB, will be required.   \n4.  Consulting Services \n41.  The Project will provide 156 person-months of international and 767 person-months of \ndomestic consulting services. The consultants will assist MAWR in (i) institutional capacity \nbuilding;  (ii)  design;  (iii)  procurement  support,  including  pre-qualification  of  contractors, \npreparation of bidding documents,  and bid evaluation; (iv) construction supervision; and (v) \n ", "12 \nproject  M&E.  The  details  of  consulting  services  inputs  and  terms  of  reference  are  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  F.  The  consulting  services  will  be  provided  by  an  international \nconsulting firm in association with domestic consultants. MAWR will engage consultants in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nacceptable  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants,  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection method. \n5.  Advance Action \n42.  To  expedite  project  implementation,  ADB,  upon  Government\u2019s  request,  approved \nadvance action on the procurement of civil works, construction materials, and equipment. The \nGovernment will also take the necessary actions to recruit the consultants on advance basis. \nThe Government has been informed that (i) advance action will cover actions up to, but not \nincluding, contract signing; and (ii) approval of advance action does not commit ADB to finance \nthe Project. \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n43.  After loan effectiveness, an imprest account will be established at a bank acceptable to \nADB, to facilitate the timely release of loan funds for making payments in local currency. During \nthe first year of implementation, the ceiling of the imprest account will be set at $1,000,000. The \nimprest account will be established in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \nADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure  procedures  will  be  used  to  reimburse  expenditures  and \nliquidate the imprest account for payments not exceeding $100,000 equivalent per payment. \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n44.  MAWR will keep separate accounts and financial statements for the Project, which will \nbe audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB.  Loan proceeds will be used \nfor engaging auditors acceptable to ADB. Certified copies of the audited financial statements will \nbe submitted to ADB within 9 months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. \nInternal audit procedures will be developed in the PMO to improve financial management. The \nGovernment was informed of ADB\u2019s policy on submission of audited accounts, which covers \nfailure in submitting audited accounts and financial statements on the due date. A formal \nwarning will be issued for accounts more than 6 months overdue and disbursements will be \nsuspended for accounts that are more than 12 months overdue. \n45.  MAWR, through the PMO, will submit quarterly and annual reports to ADB. The reports \nwill indicate progress made and problems encountered during the period under review, steps \ntaken to remedy the problems, the proposed program of activities, and expected progress \nduring  the  remaining  implementation  period.  MAWR  will  also  provide  other  reports  and \ninformation relating to the Project as ADB may reasonably request, including the Project\u2019s \nenvironmental impacts, dialogue with beneficiaries, and any social issues relating to the Project. \nWithin 3 months after physical completion of the Project, MAWR will submit to ADB a project \ncompletion report detailing, among others, information on project implementation, use of the \nloan proceeds, and the extent to which the objectives of the Project have been accomplished. \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n46.  The  comprehensive  performance  M&E  will  be  introduced  and  implemented  for  the \nProject. To monitor the social impact, the M&E unit will compile a benchmark database on basic \n ", "13 \neconomic  and  social  conditions  during  the  first  year  of  project  implementation  to  have  a \nsocioeconomic  profile  of  the  beneficiaries.  Key  indicators  will  be  tracked  during  project \nimplementation  and  a  comparison  made  between  the  benchmark  and  project  completion \nsituations. The database will be analyzed to give an assessment of the Project\u2019s impact on \ndifferent social groups, including women and the lower income households. The M&E unit will \nalso monitor the progress and performance of various sector reforms implemented under the \nProject, including the impacts of the reforms in State procurement of crops, irrigation cost \nrecovery, crop diversification, gender actions, and actual savings in abstraction of river water.  \n9.  Project Review \n47.  ADB loan review missions will review the Project regularly. During the second year of \nimplementation, the Government and ADB will jointly carry out a midterm review to assess the \nachievement of project objectives and implementation milestones. The criteria for assessing the \nimplementation  milestones  will  include  (i)  progress  in  policy  measures  reflected  in  the \nGovernment assurances, (ii) implementation status, (iii) design and construction standards, (iv) \nphysical progress made and disbursements in relation to the implementation schedule, (v) \nperformance of the consultants and contractors, and (vi) status of compliance with the loan \ncovenants. The financial and economic viability of the Project will also be reassessed. The \nmidterm review will determine the need for any additional works or changes in the project \nscope. \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n48.   An associated grant-financed TA22 will assist the Government in carrying out policy and \ninstitutional reforms in the water sector by strengthening the newly reorganized institutions at \nnational, basin, and provincial levels; providing policy advice; and developing a number of \nimportant policy and legal documents related to water sector management.  \n49.  The TA will have two components: (i) policy and institutional reform support at the \nnational level, and (ii) policy and institutional reform support at the basin and provincial levels. \nThe first component will comprise assistance to MAWR to (i) enhance its policy development \ncapacity; (ii) develop key policy and strategy documents on cost recovery, water delivery fees, \nand WUA developments; (iii) advise the Government on broader institutional and policy reform \noptions; and (iv) establish a new unit to support and regulate WUA developments nationwide.   \n50.  The  second  component  will  comprise  assistance  to  ASBIO  and  the  Surkhandarya \nProvince Agriculture and Water Department (SPAWD) to (i) develop the detailed functional \nprocedures of the newly  established ASBIO; and (ii) strengthen the capacity of ASBIO and \nSPAWD to develop basin water management plans, implement the cost recovery policy at the \nbasin  level,  and  promote  WUA  developments  in  Surkhandarya.  These  components  will \ncomplement and support the activities proposed under the loan project, which will include direct \nassistance for strengthening WUAs in the project districts.23  \n51.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $740,000 equivalent, of which $500,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund funded by the Government of Japan \n                                                 \n22\n The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 13 June 2003. \n23\n The loan project will provide the WUAs in the project districts: (i) technical and legal advisory services, (ii) WUA \nstaff training, and (iii) equipment and tools necessary for WUA operations during project implementation. \n \n ", "14 \n(Appendix 7). The TA will provide for 10 person-months of international and 38 person- months \nof domestic consulting services. An international consulting firm in association with domestic \nconsultants  will  provide  the  services.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other procedures acceptable \nto ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The TA will begin during the first year of project \nimplementation and will be completed in 18 months.  \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Expected Impacts \n1.  Economic Impacts \n52.  Analyses were carried out to assess the economic viability of the Project and financial \nviability of the participating farms. The main quantifiable benefits of the investment come from (i) \nprotection from production losses that may occur due to further deterioration and possible failure \nof the system in case the Project does not materialize, and (ii) modest increases in yield and \ncropping intensity resulting from a more reliable irrigation water supply and the ongoing reform \nin the agriculture sector. While the proposed reform measures (paras. 30, 82 and 83) will have a \npositive impact on economic returns, these have not been quantified due to methodological \ndifficulties and data uncertainties.  \n53.  Without the Project, a declining water supply from increasingly inefficient pumps will \nhave a negative impact on crop yields and the cultivated area. The impact will be greater for the \nBabatag canal than for canals above Amu Zang I and II pumping stations. Overall, the average \nyield of cotton will decline from the present 2.7 tons per hectare (t/ha) to 2.3 t/ha, but wheat \nyield will remain unchanged at 3.1 t/ha since it is grown during winter and spring when the total \ndemand for irrigation is low.  The average cropping intensity over the whole project area will fall \nto 91% from the present 110%, equivalent to a decline in cultivated area of 18,400 ha per year.  \nWith the Project, the average cotton yield will increase from 2.8 to 3.4 t/ha, the wheat yield from \n3.1 to 3.9 t/ha, and the overall cropping intensity to 123%, equivalent to an additional 13,500 ha \nof crops grown each year. The output of cotton will increase from 114,000 tons to 136,000 tons \nand wheat production will rise from 128,000 tons to 165,000 tons in year 10. These are \nconservative assumptions compared with the best practice found among project area farmers. \n54.  Benefits also accrue from the reduced pumping costs for water and savings of O&M \ncosts for maintaining the system. The greater efficiency of new pumps will reduce the cost of \nenergy for pumping by an estimated $495,000 per year (in economic prices). Implementation of \nthe facility to reduce the intake of sediments to the system will reduce wear and tear on pumps \nand lower the cost of desilting main canals by $250,000 per year. O&M costs for the pumping \nstations are estimated to decline by $95,000 per year with the Project. \n55.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project is 19.5% and the economic \nnet present value (NPV) at the discount rate of 12% is $51.7 million. Sensitivity analysis was \ncarried out on the effects of key variables on the economic viability of the Project. Overall, the \nEIRR was robust and well above the acceptable minimum (12%) despite the adverse effects of \nprice and yield declines, project benefit delays, and investment cost increases. A risk analysis of \nkey sensitivity variables gave a standard deviation of 3.1% from the base EIRR and a less than \n1% probability of the EIRR falling below 12%. \n ", "15 \n56.  To illustrate the financial viability of farms in the project area, farm budget analysis was \ncarried out for three types of farms: shirkats,  private farms, and dekhan farms. The results \nsuggest that the Project will lead to increased incomes for farm households.  The project impact \nis expected to be least on shirkats and greatest for private farms.  Net incomes for shirkats will \nrise from about $180 per ha now to $210 per ha by year 5 and $260 by year 10.  Incomes for \nprivate farms, with crop diversification and improved productivity will increase from less than \n$125 per ha now, to $250 ha in year 5 and $360 per ha in year 10.  For dekhan farms, the \nexpected increase is from around $740 per ha now to $970 per ha in year 10. \n57.  The  financial  sustainability  of  the  proposed  ASCs  was  also  analyzed.  The  result \nsuggests that ASCs are expected to yield a robust financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of \n25.9%. Over 25 years the NPV of income streams would be $478,000 at a discount rate of 12%. \nThe benefit distribution and poverty impact analysis was also carried out for the Project. It \nyielded a poverty impact ratio of 0.46.  Since this is above the poverty incidence ratio of 0.31, \npoor households will benefit relatively more from the Project than the other stakeholder groups. \nFurther information on economic and financial analyses is in Appendix 8 and in Supplementary \nAppendix G. \n58.  The irrigated agriculture operations in the Amu Zang area\u2014as in most other irrigated \nsystems  in  Uzbekistan\u2014are  heavily  distorted  by  implicit  taxes  as  well  as  subsidies.  The \nGovernment, through its mandatory state procurement system for cotton and wheat at lower \nprices, imposes heavy implicit taxes on farmers surrounding the Amu Zang irrigation system.  \nOn the other hand, the Government also provides direct and indirect subsidies to farmers in the \nform of cheap electricity, O&M of pumps and main canals, subsidized fuel, fertilizers and \nmachinery operations, and low interest credits on farm operations. The comparisons of taxes \nand subsidies involving the Amu Zang irrigation system shows that, on the whole, the total \namount of taxes imposed on the farming community in the Amu Zang area ($33.2 million) \nexceeds  the  total  subsidies  ($24.4  million)  provided  by  the  Government.  This  finding  is \nconsistent with World Bank\u2019s recent analysis that the net resource transfer out of the agriculture \nsector over the past decade has been significant.24 \n59.  According  to  ADB\u2019s  subsidies  policy,25 the  existing  subsidies  are  justifiable  on  the \nground that they have offsetting effects on the Government\u2019s heavy implicit taxing system on \nfarmers in the Amu Zang area, and also that the market institutions are weak in this transition \neconomy. However, ADB\u2019s subsidies policy also encourages the systematic phasing out of \nsubsidies as they create sector inefficiency and farm disincentives. The Government\u2019s recent \npolicies of reducing both subsidies and implicit taxes through continuous increases in key input \nprices as well as in outputs are important26 and should be encouraged. The reform measures\u2014\nintroduction of water delivery fees, implementation of sustainable cost recovery policies, and \npromotion of private sector-driven rural institutions such as ASCs and WUAs\u2014proposed in the \nProject are expected to further reduce the farming subsidies in the Amu Zang area. Meantime \nthe proposed reductions in the Government procurement quota for cotton  and wheat in the \nProject districts are also expected to reduce the implicit taxes imposed on farmers through \nhigher farmgate prices. Subsidies and taxes are discussed in detail in Appendix 8. \n                                                 \n24\n World Bank. 2003. Uzbekistan Country Economic Memorandum\u2014Agriculture and the Rural Sector. Washington, \nDC. It is estimated that the net transfer of resources out of the agriculture sector until 2001 varied between $500 \nand $1 billion annually. \n25\n ADB. 1996. ADB's Subsidies Paper. Manila. \n26\n For instance, in 2002, the Government increased the procurement prices for cotton (by 57%) and wheat (by 72%) \nand further relaxed the state procurement quota for cotton and wheat in selected districts. Also, in 2002 the \nGovernment substantially increased the prices of electricity for pump irrigation (by 60%), fuel and fertilizer.  \n ", "16 \n2.  Impact on the Environment \n60.  The  Project  will  have  a  significant  positive  environmental  impact  on  the  areas \nsurrounding the Amu Zang irrigation system. The new sediment control facility will reduce by \n50% the sediments entering the system by 50% and the rehabilitated main canals and control \nstructures will reduce water losses and infiltration and improve water availability. Improvements \nto the drainage system will reduce waterlogging and soil salinity.   \n61.   The project rehabilitation works will be concentrated around the existing large pumping \nstations and the contractors will use the existing buildings. Special clauses in the contract \ndocuments  will  ensure  that  the  technical  operations  (replacement  of  pumps,  motors,  and \nconstruction activities) are carried out according to the standard Government procedures for the \nappropriate  disposal  of  waste,  minimization  of  nuisances  during  construction,  and  proper \naftercare of the construction sites.  The contractors will also comply with national health, safety, \nand hygiene requirements, which will be incorporated in the contract documents. Attention will \nbe paid to social discipline, control, and safeguards on wastewater and solid waste.  \n62.  The Project will not build new canals. Neither will it expand pumping capacity or the \nirrigated area. Therefore, no resettlement or land acquisition will be required. The Project is not \nexpected to give rise to significant negative environmental impacts.  Measures have been \nproposed to mitigate the minor potential negative impacts identified in the initial environmental \nexamination (IEE) and costs for implementing the measures were included in the project \nbudget.  The main mitigating measures include (i) monitoring the morphology of the Amu Darya \nRiver, (ii) studying the need for fish exclusion devices at the intake, (iii) building safeguards into \nthe  contract  documents  to  cover  the  handling  and  disposal  of  hazardous  materials27 by \ncontractors, and (iv) preparing a plan to clean up existing stockpiles of obsolete agrochemicals.  \n63.  At present the riparian states have no formal multilateral water-sharing agreements on \nAmu Darya River. The only existing agreement between Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan is to \nequally share the water flow of Amu Darya River between the two countries at point Kerk \ndownstream of the Amu Zang irrigation system. The Project will not increase the intake of river \nwater; instead, rehabilitation of the irrigation system and the resultant improvement in water use \nefficiency will allow about 5% reduction in the consumption of irrigation water28 and reduce the \namount of drainage effluent going back to the river system. Thus, the proposed Project will not \nhave any impact on the neighboring (upstream and downstream) countries in terms of water- \nsharing arrangements, water intake limits, and transboundary environmental consequences. \n64.  In accordance with the recommendations of the IEE, an M&E Unit will be established in \nthe PMO during the first year of project implementation.  Supported by consultants, the unit will   \n                                                 \n27\n These are the materials of disassembled old pumps that may contain some oil products and other polluting \nsubstances. \n28\n The feasibility study estimates the saving of about 60 million cubic meters per year. The Amu Darya River received \nan average annual inflow of 74 cubic kilometers (km3). Uzbekistan accounts for 48% of the water  used, \nTurkmenistan 36%, and Tajikistan 15%. Present flows to the southern Aral Sea and its delta are only 8 km3 \nannually, compared with a minimum of 12 km3 needed to maintain the delta ecosystems. Despite the water-sharing \nagreement between Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, water flow is hardly being monitored due to the inadequate flow \nmeasurement stations. Turkmenistan has diverted the larger quantity of water, leaving less for Uzbekistan. The \nreduction in Amu Zang's abstraction of river water, therefore, will lessen the potential conflicts between the two \ncountries. More importantly, the Project signifies the fact that improved irrigation could achieve water conservation. \nThe World Bank's recent Water and Environmental Management Project (May 2003) concluded that 5\u201310% \nreduction in water use in all major irrigation systems will produce significant positive impacts on the Aral Sea \necosystems. \n ", "17 \ndevise a monitoring system, select key indicators, and monitor the project impacts. The SIEE is \nin Supplementary Appendix H.  \n3.      Impact on Living Standards \na.  Poverty Reduction \n65.  Some 400,000 people live in the area of the Amu Zang irrigation system, 88% of whom \nlive in the rural areas. The detailed description of the project area is in Supplementary Appendix \nA. A World Bank poverty study (2003) estimated that in 2000, 28.4% of the population of \nSurkhandarya Province had incomes below the poverty line.29 The feasibility study carried out \nthe detailed project area-specific social and poverty analysis (using a methodology similar to \nthat in the World Bank study). The details on the approach used are in Appendix 9. The result \nsuggests that poverty incidence in the project area was 31.4%. This percentage is equivalent to \n130,000 people or about 16,500 households. 30 About 44% of the poor in the project area reside \nin Djarkurgan and Kumkurgan districts; 39% in the remote Muzrabad district; and 22% and 23% \nin Angor and Termez districts, respectively.31 The poor comprise 43% of shirkat workers and \n31.6% of dekhan farmers. There are no poor among private farmers although many are \nvulnerable in the sense that their incomes are just above the poverty line and even minor \nshocks can cause them to easily slide down to poverty.   \n66.  The Project will contribute to poverty reduction in the project sites by improving the \nreliability of irrigation water supplies to 96,800 ha of irrigated land. This benefit will accrue to \nsome 400,000 people of whom 126,000 are poor. Because of the poor condition of the irrigation \nsystems, only cotton fields are provided about 100% of their irrigation water quota. Farms \nproducing wheat are given 70\u201390% of their irrigation water quota, while other cash crops grown \non household plots receive only 40\u201370% of their quota. Poor farmers who often grow crops \nother than cotton thus get less water. With overall improvement in irrigation system as a result \nof the Project, the poor farmers will benefit directly.  \n67.  In Uzbekistan, rural income and poverty are related to availability of irrigation water. \nFindings of a 2003 World Bank study32 show that due to the arid conditions of the country, \nconverting its irrigated agriculture land to nonirrigated land can reduce the income of farm \nhouseholds by more than 30%. The study compared the farm profitability of an irrigated and \nrain-fed land. The income effect would be more severe in steppe zones. The study also noted \nthat in south Uzbekistan, a 10% decrease in farm income would increase poverty incidence by \n14.3%. Thus, if the Amu Zang irrigation system is not rehabilitated and is left to deteriorate at its \npresent pace, poverty incidence in the area could increase from the current 31.4% to 44%. In \nthe Babatag canal command area where alternative sources of irrigation are unavailable, \npoverty rate would rise to more than 50%. With the Project, however, irrigation water will be \nsupplied to a large number of farmer-beneficiaries, including the poor and vulnerable farm \nhouseholds (headed by women and minorities). This would reduce poverty incidence from \n31.4% to 25%. \n                                                 \n29\n The 2003 Word Bank study (footnote 1) defined the poverty threshold based on the expenditure approach to \nensure the required calories of 2,100 kcal per person per day. The food-based poverty line for Uzbekistan would \namount to SUM3,601 per month in October 2000 prices. The poverty head count rate was 30.5% for rural regions \nof Uzbekistan. The details of poverty definitions used by World Bank an United Nations Development Programme \nare in Supplementary Appendix 1. \n30\n The project area covers five districts: Angor, Djarkurgan, Kumkurgan, Muzrabad, and Termez. \n31\n PPTA estimates of the proposed Project. \n32\n The 2003 Word Bank study (footnote 1), Vol. 2, Chapter 2, Table 3. \n ", "18 \n68.  Interruptions in irrigation water supply adversely affect households working on dekhan \nand household plots. These households depend mainly on those plots for their income (about \n60% of their income is from farming) and food needs (50\u201360% of the food they consume comes \nfrom household plots). Not improving the irrigation system would reduce the irrigated area and \nlower crop productivity by 15%, thus threatening the main income and food sources of these \nfarm households. The income of poor households employed in shirkats will also be adversely \naffected by not rehabilitating the irrigation system. Conservative estimates indicate that if the \nirrigation system is not rehabilitated, the yields of cotton and wheat\u2014the two main crops grown \nby large private and shirkats in the project sites\u2014would decline from 10% in 5 years to 25% in \n10 years. With lower revenues from crop production, the income of shirkat workers from wage \nwork may not only be delayed and reduced their jobs may also be threatened. \n69.  The Project will not have any adverse impact on ethnic minorities and will not activate \nADB\u2019s policy on indigenous peoples. The Project will ensure access to irrigation supply for and \nparticipation of Turkmens in Termez district, where most of the poor Turkmens reside, and \nensure that they participate in the privatization process.  \n70.  With improved yields and increase in cropping intensity resulting from a larger irrigated \narea, a regular and stable supply of water for irrigation, and improved land condition due to \nbetter drainage systems, employment opportunities will expand in the crop sector. A joint study \nof MAWR and the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection showed that a 10% increase in cotton \nyield would lead to a 1% increase in employment. On small farms, a similar increase in yield \nwould increase the demand for manual labor by 2%. The summary poverty reduction and social \nstrategy is in Appendix 9 and the detailed social and poverty assessment is in Supplementary \nAppendix I. \nb.  Gender and Development \n71.  The Project will be beneficial to women. For women who serve as heads of family and \nwho own land, access to a more regular supply of water for irrigation will improve their yield, \nencourage more cropping intensity, and increase their income. Production in their household \nplots will also improved. Women who take care of these plots will produce more cash crops to \nincrease their purchasing power  and enable them to pay for more nutritious food and other \nessential needs of their household. Moreover, improved access to machinery through more \neffective ASCs will significantly reduce the agricultural work performed by women and children \nmanually in the fields. Women can therefore devote more time to their household plots for cash \ncrop production; the children, on the other hand, will be able to attend school more regularly. \nWith  40%  of  the  respondents  stating  that  women  should  not  participate  in  agriculture \nmanagement, the Project will develop measures that will increase the capacity of women to get \nmore involved in project activities, especially in the development of the WUAs. The gender \naction plan is in Supplementary Appendix J. \nc.  Institutional Development \n72.  The Project will contribute to institutional development by establishing WUAs that will be \nmanaged and operated by the local communities. While the objective of the WUA is to ensure \nthe sustainable use and management of the rehabilitated irrigation systems, in the long term \nsuccessful WUAs can serve as models for community-driven activities that capitalize on the \nsocial capital networks to address and resolve local issues, especially those that will impact on \npoverty. \n ", "19 \n73.  The TA associated with the loan will help strengthen the capacities of national and \nprovincial water departments.  The staff of MAWR\u2019s water resources management department \nwill be trained in policy analysis.  At the basin level, the new ASBIO will be supported to \ncoordinate management of irrigation water delivery and support for WUAs.  The TA project will \nalso assist ASBIO to investigate and respond to a wider range of water resource management \nissues and needs in the basin.  \nd.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n74.  All the project works are expected to take place on Government buffer strips, land that \nhas been reserved for operation and protection of the system\u2019s canals. The feasibility study, \nhowever, identified  that  1.1  ha  of  Government  land  has been  encroached upon and one \nresidential house have been built on land where the project rehabilitation work is expected to \ntake place.33 The Government assured that it would make maximum efforts to avoid reacquiring \nthe occupied land or relocating the house. Should the acquisition of land and/or relocation of the \nhouse become unavoidable, the Government assured that the EA will prepare an appropriate \nresettlement plan according to  ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy, and submit it to ADB for \napproval before any civil works contract is awarded. As the buffer strips are State-owned lands, \nthe  PIU  will  ensure  that  they  are  restored,  where  required,  and  maintained  according  to \nregulations.  \nB.  Risks and Safeguards  \n75.  A number of risks may affect project implementation. Achieving sustainable O&M lies at \nthe heart of the project rationale and design, and remains the main risk in achieving objectives. \nFailure may result from an inadequate operation framework for WUAs, insufficient organization \nand training of WUAs, lack of proper water delivery fee systems, or limited capacity of the \nbeneficiaries to pay. To mitigate these risks, the Project is proposing a range of activities: (i) \ndeveloping of a national policy on cost recovery and improved operational procedures for WUAs \ndevelopment, (ii) improved O&M practices at the Amu Zang irrigation system and ASBIO, (iii) \nintroducing water delivery fees in the project province, and (iv) developing WUAs to address the \non-farm and interfarm O&M. These cost recovery measures will be accompanied by reduced \nGovernment procurement quotas on cotton and wheat for farmers in the Project area. The \nincreased farm incomes from such a measure will enable farmers to pay their water delivery \nfees. Progress in developing an adequate cost recovery framework will be closely monitored \nunder the Project. Notwithstanding such development, the Government also recognized that its \nbudget allocation has not been adequate, and assured the timely and full provision of O&M \nbudget for the irrigation system.  \n76.  Lack of participation by farmer beneficiaries in the development of the cost-recovery \nscheme may lead to default in farmers\u2019 payments. To minimize this risk, close consultations with \nfarmer  beneficiaries  were  conducted  at  every  stage  of  project  preparation,  including \npresentation of the estimated per hectare costs of on-farm rehabilitation. \n77.  Policy deficiencies remain in the overall economy and in the agriculture sector including \nState involvement in fixing prices, and the remaining (although in a substantially reduced \nvolume) and mandatory State procurement quota for cotton and wheat. The farm budget \n                                                 \n33\n According to Government Decree No. 174 issued in 1992, construction of farm buildings is allowed in the buffer \nzones. \n ", "20 \nanalysis is based on the assumption that these policy deficiencies will be removed within a 10-\nyear period.  \n78.  The proposed Project will be ADB\u2019s first major investment in the water sector and the \nthird with MAWR.34 The risk of implementation delays arising from MAWR\u2019s limited familiarity \nwith  ADB  procedures  has  been  partly  mitigated  by  involving  MAWR  staff  during  project \nprocessing. Their knowledge of ADB\u2019s procedures will be enhanced through seminars and \nduring the administration missions. In addition, international and domestic consultants will be \nrecruited to (i) help the PMO and the PIU to set up appropriate operational systems, and (ii) \nprovide hands-on training to the project staff. \n79.  Incorporating lessons learned, the Project will establish its implementation structure at \nan  early  stage.  Staff  of  the  offices  that  will  be  involved  in  project  implementation  have \nparticipated in project design to foster a sense of ownership of the Project and strengthen their \ncommitment to project implementation. Since MAWR has a sufficient number of technical staff \nexperienced in designing and constructing such infrastructure, the risk  of the EA\u2019s lack of \ntechnical competence is judged as insignificant. Furthermore, MAWR gave the assurance that \nqualified and experienced staff acceptable to ADB will be assigned to these offices; measures \nwill be taken to avoid staff turnover; and additional MAWR staff will be assigned to the PMO and \nthe PIU to support project implementation, whenever necessary. \n80.  Potential delays in the release of counterpart funds, slow internal approval procedures of \nthe Government for the use of loan proceeds, and lack of cooperation among Government \nagencies may delay procurement and consultant recruitment. These systematic issues have \nbeen brought to the attention of top Government officials, and the Government gave the \nassurance that counterpart funds will be adequate and timely during the project period. The \ninterministerial PSC will identify and resolve issues that need coordination among multiple \nGovernment agencies. The authority to approve for project implementation has been delegated \nto  the  project  manager.  ADB\u2019s  loan  review  missions  will  closely  monitor  the  actual \nimplementation of these arrangements and develop remedial measures accordingly. \n81.  At the project level, the benefits of the investment will be much reduced if (i) the farm \nprivatization process is delayed, (ii) old farm management practices and administrative controls \nover production and marketing are not eliminated, or (iii) the marketing arrangements for cotton \nare not improved.  In general, the informal barriers to trade and to a fair return to the producer \nmust be significantly reduced if farmers are to achieve any measurable benefit from growing \ncotton. These issues are being addressed under the policy reforms being implemented.  \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n82.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n(i)  The Government, starting with the 2004 cropping season, will ensure the effective \nimplementation  of  agriculture  sector  reform measures stipulated in the Presidential \n                                                 \n34\n The first project is the ongoing Ak Altin Agricultural Development Project (footnote 9).

Introduction \n1.  In Uzbekistan 10% of the land area is cultivable and of the cultivable area of 4.8 million \nhectares (ha), 88% is irrigated. Irrigated agriculture accounts for 35% of the gross domestic \nproduct, 35% of foreign exchange receipts, and 45% of employment. The most important crop is \ncotton, which accounts for about 30% of export earnings or about $1 billion annually. Since \nindependence from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Government has found it difficult \nto allocate sufficient resources for irrigation system maintenance. However, it is now taking \nsteps  to  increase  investment  in  the  sector,  rehabilitate  irrigation  and  drainage  (I&D) \ninfrastructure, and improve farm sustainability. \n2.  The agriculture development strategy centers on three strategic goals to: (i) generate \nforeign exchange earnings, (ii) improve food security, and (iii) promote rural employment and \nimprove living standards. Achievement of these goals depends on the transformation to a \ncompetitive, market-oriented rural economy. In 2000 the Government outlined an action plan for \n2001\u20132003 for economic reforms in agriculture that emphasizes promoting farm and enterprise \nprivatization,  improving  agricultural  financial  systems, building central and local institutional \ncapacity, improving irrigation and drainage infrastructure, and relaxing Government restrictions \non pricing and state crop procurement. A recent presidential decree reaffirmed these goals,1 \nincluding recognition of the important role of private farms, improved technology, institutional \nrestructuring focusing on a new basin-oriented irrigation management system, and greater \ndependence on market principles in agriculture and irrigation at all levels. \nB.  Agriculture and Land Policies \n1.  Procurement and Pricing  \n3.  Several regulations remaining from the former centrally planned system have distorted \nagricultural production. Of these, the most important has been the system of annual State \norders to agricultural enterprises and farms for the production of cotton and wheat.  In 2001 the \nGovernment  agreed  to  test  reforms  to  this  system2  centered  on  (i)  abolishing  or  easing  \nproduction targets, (ii) reducing the mandatory crop procurement quotas, (iii) abolishing joint \nresponsibility for procurement quotas, (iv) adjusting of state procurement prices based on \nchanges in international prices and domestic inflation, and (v) gradually reducing in the state \nprocurement of wheat and cotton. In 2002 the Government extended these reforms nationwide \nand also limited wheat and cotton procurement by the state purchasing agencies to 50% of a \nfarm\u2019s production, with the producer being able to sell the remainder at will.3 Further, the March \n2003  Presidential  decree  (footnote  1)  abolishes the State-directed crop production targets \nbeyond the 2003 season and confirms that the mandatory State procurement of raw cotton and \ngrain will not exceed 50% of actual production.    \n4.  Under the State order system, farmgate prices were based on expenditure norms for \ncrop production rather than on world market prices. Combined with an overvalued currency, \n                                                 \n1\n Republic of Uzbekistan. 2003. On the Most Important Directions for Deepening Reforms in Agriculture, Decree of \nthe President, 24 March 2003. \n2\n The reforms were tested in six districts under the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Ak Altin Development Project \nand World Bank\u2019s Rural Enterprise Support Project. \n3\n An established market for wheat exists, but in many areas Government agencies are still the only buyers of cotton. ", "28  Appendix 2 \nthese policies taxed exported agricultural commodities\u2014resulting in lower returns to farmers\u2014 \nand  subsidized  imported  inputs.  Although  a  previous  policy  overvalued  the  sum,  since \nSeptember 2001 the official exchange rate has been more closely aligned with the commercial \n(unofficial) rate, the effect of which has been to raise the price of agricultural commodities and to \nmake imported inputs more accessible. In 2002 prices for wheat and cotton rose by 72% and \n57%, respectively, as domestic prices were aligned more closely with international prices. On 15 \nOctober 2003, the Government introduced the convertibility of local currency, which will have \nfurther positive effects on farm income. Future prices will be calculated in a transparent manner \nbased on work by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) with assistance from the World Bank and the \nInternational Monetary Fund. \n2.  Privatization of Agricultural Enterprises \n5.  There  are  at  present  three  main  types  of  agricultural  producers:  (i)  cooperative \nagricultural enterprises (shirkats), (ii) private farms, and (iii) dekhan farms (household plots). \nThe shirkats and private farms are State regulated and have been subject to the State order \nsystem. Despite substantial financial assistance provided by the Government, shirkat farms \nhave performed rather poorly, failing to increase yields and output and incurring financial losses. \nPrivate farms have generally performed better. The Government is therefore strengthening the \nlegal and enabling environment for the development of private and dekhan farms. Private farms \nwere first created in 1992, but most date from 1996 or later. This number is increasing rapidly. \nThe establishment of private farms within shirkat farms is a district-level decision, but the \nconversion of a whole shirkat to private farms requires a decision from the Cabinet.  When this \noccurs, the water management activities are taken over by water users associations (WUAs). \n6.  The Government has supported private farming with 50\u2013year inheritable land use rights, \nlow-interest loans, exemption from value added tax (VAT) for fuel and fertilizer, and favorable \nterms for machinery purchase. However,  private farms have often been formed from loss-\nincurring shirkats or by allocation of marginal land and they must often rely on shirkats for their \ninput supply, farm machinery rental, and irrigation water.  State orders for cotton and grain and \nlack of access to Government\u2019s advance credit system have hampered the performance of \nprivate farms.  Furthermore, land cannot be used as collateral with the banks.  By the end of \n2002, 155 shirkats had been converted to private farms, while 1,877 remained.  This slow pace \nof privatization has not been consistent with the Government\u2019s own long-term strategic objective \nof increasing agricultural efficiency and output. However, the Presidential decree of 24 March \n2003  explicitly  recognizes,  for  the  first  time,  the  importance  of  private  farms  and  market \nprinciples and should result in expanding the privatization process. \n7.  Support services, especially for private farms, are inadequate at present. There is a \nneed to strengthen the provision of support services for private farms, especially regarding \naccess to crop inputs, machinery, irrigation services, credit, and markets. \nC.  Water Resource Policies \n1.  Water Resources and Irrigation \n8.  Uzbekistan is situated in the basins of the Syrdarya and Amudarya rivers, which together \nform the Aral Sea basin. The annual limit of water available to Uzbekistan under international \nagreements is 63.02 cubic kilometers (km\u00b3), which is more than 5 times the 11.53 km\u00b3 annual \ninternal renewable water resources of the country. The reliable flow available to Uzbekistan in \nyears of low water is 54.2 km\u00b3,  of which 49.0 km\u00b3 is available for irrigation. ", "Appendix 2  29 \n9.  Inefficient use of water compounds the problems of limited availability.  Although official \nfigures indicate over 60% irrigation efficiency, in many cases as little as 40% of the water \ndiverted by irrigation systems reaches the plants. The rest is lost in the irrigation system and in \nthe field. As a result, drainage flows amount to half of the water taken in. Drainage water is \nreused in some cases\u2014particularly where irrigation water supply shortages occur\u2014even though \nthis may lead to salinization of land. \n10.  Between 1970 and 1990, irrigation in Uzbekistan underwent spectacular development \nwith the total irrigated area increasing from 2.6 to 4.2 million ha. This rate of increase was only \npossible under a strong set of institutions in the field of design and construction and an equally \nstrong  institutional  framework  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  the  system. \nMaintaining I&D infrastructure of this magnitude requires substantial expenditures for both O&M \nand capital replacement. Since independence Uzbekistan has not been able to keep up with the \nannual financial requirements, and expenditures in the water sector have been declining in real \nterms. Furthermore, due to the low profitability of  farming, on-farm I&D systems are also in poor \ncondition.  \n11.  One estimate4 has placed the minimum cost of an irrigation rehabilitation investment \nprogram in the next  15 years at $3.9 billion or $260 million annually. This amounts to about  \n$920 per ha over 15 years, with about 54% of all investment requirements being for on-farm \ninfrastructure. Since the farms are responsible for maintaining most of the on-farm irrigation and \npart of the drainage infrastructure, this implies an additional farm income requirement of up to \n$140 million annually. \n12.  Two thirds of all irrigated areas in the country require pumping to heights in the range of \n5\u2013150 meters. As the price of electricity is increased toward its long-run marginal cost, the rising \ncost of pumping water will need to be counterbalanced by policies to sustain the long-term \nfuture of irrigated agriculture through reduced consumption.  \n2.  Operation and Maintenance and Cost Recovery \n13.  The Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (MAWR) is responsible for preparing \nthe annual budget for irrigation O&M. In the final budget allocations, salaries and electricity have \npriority over other cost components. There are no specific water delivery charges at present, but \nshirkats and private farmers are responsible for on-farm O&M costs. The State does levy a \n\u201cunified tax\u201d on  farms, which in theory includes a small charge for water use. This tax averages \nabout $9 per ha in the project area.  \n14.  Government budget expenditures for irrigation O&M in 2002 were about $130 million. By \nMAWR estimates, however, the annual requirement for O&M and depreciation is $550 million. \nOf this about 46%, or about $48 per ha, on average, is estimated to be on-farm costs. These \nestimates do not fully consider energy prices and with an economic price for energy 3 times \ngreater than its current financial cost, this may add $200 million per year to O&M. \n15.  The Government intends to gradually implement a system of payment for water along \nwith the establishment of WUAs, but at present there are no detailed cost recovery and water \ndelivery policy and implementation plans. A cost recovery policy and implementation plan \nshould be developed after further economic analysis of costs and farmers\u2019 ability to pay and \nshould be based on sound principles regarding (i) which costs are the responsibility of farmers, \n                                                 \n4\n World Bank. 2002.

The policy should be developed through adequate consultation with stakeholders. A \nprogressive strategy may be needed in which farmers take on increasing levels of support for \nlocal and major works in parallel with improving farm financial conditions and increasing levels \nof water delivery service. \nD.  Water Sector Legal and Institutional Arrangements \n1.  Legal Basis for Water Use \n16.  The most important legal document governing water use is the Law of the Republic of \nUzbekistan on Water and Water Usage, 6 May 1993, with later amendments. Water is State \nproperty, subject to rational use and protected by the State. Off-farm irrigation infrastructure is \nowned by the State. On-farm facilities are owned by the shirkats, or by associations that have \nassumed their rights and obligations. Entities that have been granted isolated (primary) usage of \nwater have the obligation to permit other entities and citizens secondary water usage, by \nagreement with MAWR and the State Committee on Nature Conservation. This appears to \nprovide a legal basis for the regulation of water deliveries between a WUA and its members.  \n17.  The Cabinet of Ministers has jurisdiction to establish a procedure for paying for water \nusage  and  compensation  for  polluting  and  exhausting  water  resources.  Water  users  are \nencouraged to carry out irrigation and land improvement work and the Land Code provides for \ntax,  loan,  and  other  advantages  to  those  who  introduce  efficient  and  resource-saving \ntechnologies.  \n2.  National Institutions \n18.  The most important central institution in the field of irrigation and drainage is MAWR.  \nMAWR was formed in 1997 by the merger of the Ministry of Melioration and Water Management \nand the Ministry of Agriculture. MAWR  has offices at central, province, and district levels. It is \ncurrently being restructured and reorganized and its new role5 includes (i) formulating policies, \n(ii) improving and introducing modern technology, and (iii) coordinating agencies and service \nenterprises that should perform on market-based principles. In addition, a fundamental change \nis  being  made  at  the  local  level  with  the  introduction  of  a  basin-based  water  resources \nmanagement system and market principles in irrigation water management (para. 15). Also, the \noverall structure will be streamlined and decentralized to provincial, district, and basin levels.  \n19.  The water resource management department of MAWR is expected to refocus its efforts \nand be more effective in policy development, regulation, and other priority areas of irrigation and \nwater resource management.6 Eventually, MAWR may need to clearly separate between water \nresources management activities and irrigation service activities to carry out these functions in a \nprofessional and neutral manner.  \n                                                 \n5\n The most recent definition is in the Presidential Decree of 24 March 2003.  The details are in Republic of \nUzbekistan. 2003. Improvement of Activity Arrangements of the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources of the \nRepublic of Uzbekistan. Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers, 28 June. \n6\n In many countries the following functions are typically recognized as part of overall water resource management: (i) \npolicy and legislation, (ii) water resource assessment and information management, (iii) integrated planning and \nstrategy development, (iv) water allocation and water quality management, (v) international water issues, (vi) \nconflict resolution, and (vii) public awareness and education. ", "Appendix 2  31 \n20.  MAWR will need to establish a unit at either the central or provincial level to monitor, \nsupport, and regulate local WUAs. These WUAs will be set up nationally and some oversight is \nrequired to register them, to establish official performance criteria and monitor performance, to \nresolve issues and complaints, and to provide or coordinate training and other support. Specific \nobjectives, roles, and procedures of such a unit will have to be defined and tested. \n3.  Local Institutions \n21.  Until June 2003, the institutional structure of water management was essentially the \nsame as before independence, except that the provincial and district authorities now dealt with \nshirkats and a growing number of private farms. This institutional structure had, however, been \nweakened by the reduced investment in O&M and irrigation development. Water resources \ndecision making and management were inefficient and sometimes governed by administrative \nrather than technical concerns. \n22.  To address the various inefficiencies in the water management system, the Government \nhas  begun  restructuring  the  irrigation  subsector.  Following  reorganization,  the  local  water \nmanagement structure will be based on 10 river basins (hydrological units) rather than on the \ncurrent  administrative  boundaries.  The  change  will  help  rationalize  the  planning  and \nimplementation of water allocation among both irrigation systems and other water users. The \nformation of basin irrigation system organizations will result in (i) better and more efficient \ndecision making for water management, (ii) reduced administrative and management costs, (iii) \nimproved water use efficiency, and (iv) a greater capacity to introduce integrated water resource \nmanagement. Although basin irrigation system organizations will focus primarily on irrigation \nmanagement, they will also be responsible for allocating of water to other uses and for water \nquality.  Consideration  is  being  given  to  the  formation  of  two  councils  for  each  basin \norganization: a water allocation council with representatives from various sectors (to ensure \ntransparency  in  water  allocation),  and  a  technical  council.  Basin  organizations  would  be \nresponsible for implementing the national water allocation priorities for (i) domestic use, (ii) \npower generation, (iii) industrial use, and (iv) irrigation.  \n23.  Under the new arrangements, issues that will need to be addressed will include (i) \nsupporting the development of policies and regulations for WUAs, (ii) investing in off-farm and \non-farm systems to improve water management, (iii) developing policies and procedures for the \nbasin irrigation organizations, (iv) introducing integrated water management in the river basins \nalong with setting up the basin irrigation organizations, and (v) developing a strong extension \nservice and research and development programs to support improvements in on-farm irrigation. \n24.  The Government plans to use this reorganization as an opportunity for major corporate \nrestructuring in the irrigation sector and it is now in the process of reducing the number of water \nsector  institutions  to  70.  After  the  reorganization,  the  provincial  and  district  water  and \nagricultural departments will still play a limited role as water service providers, although their \nultimate role remains unclear. A critical need in the reorganization will be to coordinate the new \norganizations after reorganizing local water management responsibilities.  ", "32  Appendix 2 \n4.  Water User Associations \n25.  An  important  aspect  of  the  reforms  and  reorganization  in  the  water  sector  is  the \npromotion of WUAs to assume responsibility for on-farm7 water management and O&M.  WUAs \nare developing rapidly as they are seen as the only option for managing water resources at this \nlevel. \n26.  Under a decree of  5 January 20028 on the reorganization of unprofitable agricultural \nenterprises, provision is made for establishing self-supporting WUAs. WUAs are joint stock \norganizations owned by the farmers and are exempt for 2 years, from payment of VAT and \nincome and property taxes.  Under this decree, irrigation infrastructure on the reorganized farm \nbecomes the property of the WUA and the inter-farm irrigation structures are transferred to the \nterritorial divisions of MAWR.   \n27.  The Government has a clear priority to establish WUAs to ensure sound water resource \nmanagement, rational use of water, and O&M management of local I&D infrastructure. To date \n268 WUAs are in operation. A number of issues need to be clarified regarding their operations, \nand in due time the legal basis for WUAs may need to be strengthened. Issues that need to be \nclarified include (i) the status of WUAs with regard to water rights and taxation; (ii) area of \noperation, size and definition of infrastructure and equipment for which WUAs are responsible; \n(iii) status and organization of various farm types and other water users within the WUA area; \n(iv)  responsibility  for  collecting  and  using  water  charges;  (v)  transfer  of  ownership  of \ninfrastructure; and (vi) the necessary conditions for establishing WUA federations. \n28.  Various developments favor the establishment of WUAs. In 2000 and 2001, which were \ndrought years, the main focus of  MAWR\u2019s activities was on improving water delivery services \nand promoting the idea of WUAs. Starting from 2000, every region established a demonstration \nfarm to model an effective WUA for the purpose of training regional irrigation engineers. Drought \nalso  exposed  problems  with  water  distribution  and  measurement.  As  a  result,  MAWR \nrehabilitated a large number of water measuring hydroposts at the on-farm level and established \non-farm water accounting practices. MOF also relaxed the arrangements for  financing the crops \nprocured for State needs to make an explicit provision for allowing farms to use allocated \nadvances to finance the activities of their water user groups.   \nE.  Summary and Project Implications \n29.  This  review  makes  clear  that  the  Government  has  already  achieved  considerable \nprogress toward a more liberalized and sustainable set of agricultural and land policies.  It has \nmade  commitments  to  further  implement  reforms  in  terms  of  agricultural  commodity \nprocurement and pricing, farm restructuring, and macroeconomics. The Asian Development \nBank (ADB) and other international organizations are engaged in policy dialogue in these areas \nand should continue to assist the Government to achieve agreed-upon objectives. Although the \nAmu Zang project is not expected to have a direct impact on the achievement of these overall \nagricultural and land policy reforms, the Project will assist the Government in furthering a \nnumber of important water sector reform issues, including (i) the development of a national \nO&M policy, (ii) institutional development of WUAs, and (iii) the development of a mechanism \n                                                 \n7\n WUA is usually formed with responsibility for the area of a former (or existing) shirkat, and \u201con-farm\u201d refers to all \nthe I&D infrastructure in the territory of the shirkat, including channels and drains connecting individual private and \ndekhan farms. \u201cInterfarm\u201d refers to the infrastructure connecting farms at the shirkat level. \n8\n Republic of Uzbekistan. 2002.

", "Appendix 2  33 \nfor and the introduction of water delivery fees. In addition the Project should continue ADB\u2019s \nearlier policy reform dialogue with the Government on issues relating to the procurement of \nwheat and cotton. \n30.  The Government has made a general commitment to adopt a market orientation in water \nresource management. As indicated, the policy should be developed on the basis of sound \nprinciples and guidelines that are acceptable to the Government at the outset and on financial \nanalysis of water users\u2019 ability to pay and consultation with stakeholders.  \n31.  The Government has already taken steps toward reform of water sector institutional \narrangements, and the orientation and role of MAWR are being updated to emphasize policy \nand regulation. The establishment of basin irrigation organizations will help rationalize water \nallocation within hydrological units. These organizations will give an opportunity to reform and \ndownsize the administrative structure in the irrigation sector. These changes also present the \nopportunity to introduce a more integrated water resource management approach.   \n32.  The Government is also emphasizing the establishment and strengthening of WUAs.  \nThese associations have a key role to play in delivering water to farm fields and maintaining the \nlocal irrigation works system. The Project will support WUA establishment and strengthening on \na pilot basis within the project area. The Project should help the Government to clarify the roles \nand  relationships  of  the  various  agencies.  These  will  be  important  steps  in  implementing \nsustainable development of water resources in the project area and beyond. \n33.  Improving water allocation and other policies for economic, social, and environmental \nobjectives may be needed. Topics such as water rights and licensing, coordinated (conjunctive) \nmanagement of groundwater and surface water, water resources information management, \nwater conservation and demand management, and coordination and conflict resolution could be \nimportant topics for improving future water resource management. \n ", "34   Appendix 3 \nMAJOR EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE IN AGRICULTURE AND WATER SECTORS \n \n         \n  Funding  Amount     \nProject  Source  ($\u2019000)  Year  Location \n         \n         \nCotton Subsector Improvement  WB  66.0  1995\u20132005  National \nRural Enterprise Support Project (Appraisal)  WB  36.0  2001\u20132006  5 districts \nKarshi Pumping Cascade Rehabilitation  WB  40.0  2002\u20132007  Kashkadarya \nDrainage and Irrigation Wetland Improvement  WB  40.0  2003\u20132008  Karakalpakstan \nRural Enterprise Development  ADB  50.0  1996\u20132001  National \nAk Altin Agricultural Development  ADB  72.0  2000\u20132005  Ak Altin \nFood and Agriculture Policy Unit Advisory  EU  4.0  1995\u20131999  Tashkent \nUnit \nSupport Services to Private Farmers in  EU  0.4  1994\u20131996  Fergana and \n  Fergana and Syrdarya  Syrdarya \nFood Production and Distribution  EU  0.35  1995  National \nIntegrated Agriculture and Food Industry  EU  1.6  1997\u20132001  National \n  Development \nTraining and Education of Farmers  EU  2.8  1996\u20131998   \nRegional Agricultural Development  EU  2.4  1997\u20132001   \nOn-Farm Irrigation  EU  1.1  1998\u20131999  Syrdarya \nBulungur Pilot Integrated Development  EU  2.6  1995\u20131997  Samarkand \n  Programme \nSmall-Scale Private Agriculture Development  USAID  0.3  1992\u20131997   \nFarmer-to-Farmer Training  USAID  0.6  1994\u20131995   \nModern Farming  USAID  3.4  1993\u20131997   \nRegional Special Initiative Water Program  USAID  10  2002\u20132005   \nPilot Project on Diversification  GTZ  0.7  1995\u20131997   \nResource-Saving Land Utilization  GTZ  2.7  1995\u20131999   \nRice Collecting Machines for Karakalpakstan  Japan  7.0  1996\u20131997  Karakalpakstan \n  and Khorezm  and Khorezm \nBulungur Institutional Strengthening and  DFID  0.8  1997\u20131999  Samarkand \n  Microcredit  (UK) \nConstruction of Dairy Farms and Mini- Factory  Israel  1.1  1997\u20131998  Tashkent \nConstruction of Khorezm Sugar Refinery  Turkish  25.0  1998  Khorezm \nEximBank \n       \n              Total    370.9   \n       \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DFID = Department for International Development, EU = European Union, \nGTZ = German Technical Cooperation, USAID = United States Agency for International Development, WB = World Bank. \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates.

Introduction \n1.  Economic and financial analyses were carried out to assess the economic viability of the \nProject and financial viability of the participating farms. The main feature of the Project is the \npumping of water from the Amu Darya River through a cascade of three pumping stations to \nirrigate  farms  in  an  area  where  agriculture  would  otherwise  not  be  possible.  The  main \nquantifiable benefits of the investment come, first, from the prevention of losses of production in \nthe future without the project and, second, from modest increases in production with the assured \nsupply of water to farms in the future with the Project. While the proposed reform measures will \nhave a positive impact on the economic viability of the Project, these measures were not \nincorporated in the analysis as the actual benefits accruing from them are difficult to quantify. \nImplementation of the Project will allow farmers to take advantage of other changes in the \nagriculture sector, including the relaxation of mandatory production quotas for wheat and cotton, \nand active promotion of private and dekhan farms. \n2.  The impact of the Project will be primarily on agricultural production. Estimating the \nproject benefits was based on crop and farm budgets drawn up to reflect the conditions \nprevailing in the area. Without the Project, reductions in water supplied by the irrigation system \nwill  have  significant  negative  impacts  on  yields  and  the  area  cultivated.  With  the  Project, \nchanges  in  farm  production  depend  on  farmers\u2019  responses  to  changes  in  the  farm \nenvironment\u2014reliable  water  supply,  more  efficient  and  effective  use  of  water,  more  open \nmarkets and higher returns, opportunities for crop diversification, and reduced costs through \nincreased productivity. Project implementation will benefit the livelihoods of all households in the \nproject area; without the Project, livelihoods will be adversely affected because of the lack of \nalternative employment in the area.     \nB.  Land Area, Cropping Pattern, and Farms \n3.  The total cultivated project area is 96,800 hectares (ha). Three main canals\u2014Amu Zang, \nZang,  and  Babatag\u2014have  command  areas  of  10,933  ha,  66,855  ha  and  19,012  ha, \nrespectively. The major crops are cotton and wheat, which are grown in around 43% and 36% of \nthe cultivated area. Fruit, vegetables, and fodder crops are grown in about 30% of the cultivated \narea, to give an average cropping intensity of 110%.  \n4.  Production is divided among three types of farms:  shirkats (cooperative farms with an \naverage area of 1,230 ha), private farms (average 24.3 ha), and dekhan farms (individual \nhousehold plots averaging 0.234 ha).  There are 50 shirkats with a total area of 61,470 ha or \nalmost two thirds of the total cultivated area.  Private farms currently occupy 22,370 ha, but their \nnumber is increasing as the process of privatizing shirkats continues. After 10 years, private \nfarms will occupy 50,000\u201355,000 ha (with a corresponding decrease in shirkat area).  The \nremaining area (55,307 ha) is cultivated as dekhan farms. \n5.  In the past, the State order system controlled the cropping pattern on shirkat and private \nfarms to ensure the production of wheat and cotton, and imposed compulsory procurement of \nvarying percentages of the production of these crops at controlled prices. In 2002, procurement \npercentages for Surkhandarya were 50% for both cotton and wheat.1 State control of the \n                                                 \n1\n A single procurement price was applied for cotton, but 25% of the wheat crop was purchased at the procurement \nprice and 25% at a premium of 20%. ", "46   Appendix 8 \ncropping pattern will be abolished after the 2003 cropping season2 and will be replaced by \nmutually  agreed-upon  production  contracts  between  farmers  and  the  State  purchasing \nagencies.  This  development  will  allow  private  farmers  more  flexibility  to  diversify  crop \nproduction. While cotton and wheat will remain the most important crops, increased production \nof  fruit,  vegetables  and  fodder  will  intensify  overall  production  and  enhance  private  farm \nincomes.  \nC.  Major Assumptions of Economic and Financial Analysis \n6.  The major assumptions in the economic analysis are in 2003 constant prices. The \nproject life is 25 years with year 1 assumed to be 2004. The official exchange rate is Sum 975 to \n$1.00 and  the shadow exchange rate factor is 1.30.3 \n7.  Economic  and  financial  prices  for  traded  goods  (wheat,  cotton,  and  fertilizers)  are \nderived from World Bank commodity price projections for the years up to 2015.  Prices were \nconverted to 2003 constant prices using the manufacturing unit value (MUV) index and are \nadjusted for insurance, freight, and handling to derive border prices.  Prices for wheat and \nfertilizers were derived on an import parity basis. Cotton prices were derived on an export parity \nbasis since Uzbekistan is a major cotton exporter. \n8.  Prices for nontraded goods and services and labor are based on market prices for mid\u2013\n2003.  Financial prices for these goods and services were converted to economic prices using a \nconversion  factor  of  1.0,  but  in  view  of  the  significant  levels  of  unemployment  and \nunderemployment in rural areas, a shadow wage rate factor (SWRF) of 0.8 was used.4 \n9.  The most important crops are cotton and wheat. Present yields are based on project \nsurveys and data from local government agencies in Surkhandarya Province. Present yields of \ncotton in the project area average 2.8 tons per ha. Average yields of wheat are 3.0 tons per ha \nfor private and shirkat farms and 3.8 tons per ha for dekhan farms. \n10.  Without the Project, yields are expected to decline. With no rehabilitation, pumping \nefficiency and the volumes of water delivered during peak pumping period from June to August \nat Amu Zang I and II stations will decline over time5 although outside the peak period, water \ndelivery will be little affected. Reductions in the water available to farmers during the main \ncropping season will lead to reductions in area planted or to water stress, causing reductions in \ncrop yields. To estimate the impact of water reductions on yields, a crop yield\u2013water response \nratio of 0.85 for cotton and wheat was assumed.6 Since specific ratios for other crops were not \navailable, the same ratio was assumed for these crops as well. \n11.  For Amu Zang I and II stations, a decline in pumping efficiency of half the potential level \nwas assumed on average over the next 10 years. Reduced deliveries during the peak season \n                                                 \n2\n This is one of the measures in the Republic of Uzbekistan. 2003. On the Most Important Directions for Deepening \nReforms in Agriculture, Decree of the President. 24 March 2003. \n3\n This is the same as that used in the analysis for the proposed Grain Productivity Improvement Project.   \n4\n The  same  SWRF  was  used  for  the  Grain  Productivity  Improvement  Project and the  Ak  Altin  Agricultural \nDevelopment Project. \n5\n If maintenance continues at present levels, the potential rate of decline at Amu Zang I and II stations is about 5% \nper year during the peak pumping season.  The pumping data for these stations indicates that the decline is not yet \nso high, but on technical grounds these levels are expected in the coming years. \n6\n This ratio was used for the World Bank Karshi Pumping Cascade Rehabilitation Project. Similar conditions apply in \nSukhandarya province. ", "Appendix 8  47 \n(June\u2013August) will affect all crops except wheat, which is grown through the winter and spring \nand has a relatively low water requirement. Furthermore, on the Zang canal (which accounts for \ntwo thirds of the whole command area), wheat is principally irrigated by gravity flow from the \nSurkhandarya River. Cotton yields in the areas dependent on these two pumping stations will \nfall from 2.8 tons to 2.3 tons per ha over 10 years. Wheat yields will be unchanged. \n12.  The decline in efficiency at Babatag will be higher than at the other stations and is \nexpected to be 10% per year or higher.  Wheat will also be affected to some extent as there is \nno alternative gravity flow available and the condition of the pumps is poor. Without the Project, \ncotton yields will fall from 2.7 to 1.8 tons per ha and wheat yields from 3.0 to 2.5 tons for private \nand shirkat farms and from 3.8 to 3.2 tons per ha for dekhan farms. \n13.  With the Project, increases in yield and cropping intensities throughout the project area \nwill result from dependable irrigation supplies, improved drainage, and adoption of improved \ntechnologies following full rehabilitation of the system. Average yields will increase gradually, \nbut will not exceed an upper limit defined by the yield potential of each crop, derived from the \naverage Bonitet (fertility) rating for the project area. Cotton yields are assumed to increase from \n2.8 to 3.4 tons per ha for private farms and  from 2.8 to 3.1 tons for shirkats.  Wheat yields will \nincrease from 3.8 to 4.7 tons per ha for dekhan farms, from 3.0 to 3.7 tons per ha for private \nfarms and from 3.0 to 3.4 tons per ha for shirkats. These are conservative assumptions \ncompared with the best practice among project area farmers. \n14.  The present overall cropping intensity is 110%.7 This will fall to 91% without the Project, \nequivalent to a reduction in cultivated area of 18,400 ha. About half of this reduction in cultivated \narea is on the Babatag canal. With the Project, cropping intensity increases to 123% overall as a \nresult of crop diversification and increased production of fruit, vegetables, and fodder. This is \nequivalent to an additional 12,600 ha of crops grown each year. \n15.  The pumping cost of water is a significant resource cost in agriculture and is directly \nproportional  to  the  price  of  electricity.  The  financial  price  used  in  the  analysis  is \nSUM13.2/kilowatt-hour (kWh), the price applied for the water sector in mid-2003. The economic \nprice is $0.03/kWh which is the estimated long-run marginal cost used by energy analysts at the \nCountry Office of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in Tashkent.  \n16.  At present the Government imposes a high implicit tax on the agriculture sector through \ncontrolled procurement prices for cotton and wheat, which are around 50% below their border \nprices  at  equilibrium  exchange  rates.  Implicit  taxes  are  achieved  through  an  overvalued \nexchange rate regime, failure to rebate value added tax on cotton fiber exports, and high trade \ncommissions and transport deductions set by the State enterprises, which monopolize both \ndomestic and export cotton trade. Farmers also pay the so-called \u201cunified tax\u201d at nominal rate.  \nThe actual rates of the unified tax depends on land type and the tax is different for irrigated and \nnonirrigated  lands.  The  rates  of  the  unified  tax  are  annually  approved  by  the  Cabinet  of \nMinistries  for  each  district.  The  average  unified  tax  for  irrigated  land  is  estimated  at \nSUM9,000/ha or $9.2/ha.  \n17.  The Government also gives substantial amounts of subsidy to agriculture. The main \nsubsidies are for (i) fertilizer, (ii) fuel, (iii) hire charges for tractors and combines, and (iv) credit \nfor state-procured commodities.  \n                                                 \n7\n This is the average for the project area.  For dekhan farms, the average is 140%. ", "48   Appendix 8 \n18.  According  to  the  World  Bank,8  the  agriculture  sector  has  been  more  taxed  than \nsubsidized on the whole and net transfer of resources from agriculture to other sectors has been \ntaking place. The World Bank estimated that the net taxation of the agriculture sector until 2001 \nvaried between $500 million and $1 billion annually. In 2001, however, this amount was reduced \nsubstantially mainly because of a one-time write-off of farm debts by the Government.  In 2000, \nthe net taxation of the agriculture sector was around 10% of the gross domestic product, which \ndeclined to around 1%.  \n19.  In the Amu Zang irrigation system area, the Government imposes high implicit taxes on \nfarms through procurement and pricing systems for cotton and wheat. The implicit tax9 on farm \nproduction is estimated at $33.2 million per annum.  \n20.  On the other hand, the irrigation system and the related agriculture production also \ninvolve high subsidies. The total subsidies to the Amu Zang Irrigation system and related \nfarming are estimated at $24.4 million per annum. The breakdown is as follows: (i) electricity, \n$13.6 million;10 (ii) operation and maintenance (O&M) of pumps and canals, $1.7 million; (iii) \ndesilting, $0.4 million; (iv) subsidies related to direct farm operations, $8.6 million (fertilizer, fuel, \nand hire charges for tractors and combines and other subsidies; or $140/ha). Comparing the \nimplicit taxes and direct and indirect subsidies demonstrates that, on the whole, farmers in the \nAmu Zang irrigation system area pay the Government a net implicit tax of $8.8 million (the \ndifference between total annual tax of $33.2 million and total annual subsidy of $24.4 million). \nThis is consistent with the overall finding that the agriculture sector has been taxed as a net \n(para. 18). \n21.  Thus, removing the state order system and adjusting the low prices received by farmers \nto their world price equivalents will have a significant positive impact on the financial status of \nfarmers in the project area, even if subsidies on electricity, fertilizer, machinery, irrigation and \nother inputs are removed.  Such improved financial returns will be a strong incentive for farmers \nto improve crop yields, thereby further increasing incomes. The Government\u2019s policy is moving \nin that direction. In recent years, the Government reduced the implicit taxes and subsidies \nsignificantly and this trend will continue. In 2002, the Government increased the procurement \nprices for cotton by 57% and for wheat by 72%. In December 2002 the Government issued a \nresolution allowing private sector participation in the wholesale purchases and export of cotton. \nThe procurement quotas for cotton and wheat have also been relaxed in selected districts. The \nGovernment and the International Monetary Fund have just made a joint announcement to \nintroduce currency convertibility starting 15 October 2003. In 2002, the electricity prices for the \nagriculture and irrigation sectors (as for most other users) rose by about 60%. The Government \nhas committed to transfer O&M costs to beneficiaries through the introduction of water delivery \nfees, and to transfer interfarm facilities to water users associations (WUAs). All these measures \nare  expected  to  reduce  the  difference  between  the  economic  and  financial  prices  of \ncommodities and farm inputs and will reduce taxes and subsidies for the agriculture sector.  \n                                                 \n8\n World Bank. 2003.

", "Appendix 8  49 \n22.  The subsidies paper11 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) encourages two policies: \n(i) subsidies should be transparent, and (ii) subsidies should be reduced or eliminated in a \nsystematic manner unless they can be justified. The proposed project interventions are in line \nwith  these  policies.  The  implicit  subsidies  (and  taxes)  involved  in  the  Project  have  been \nquantified and discussed. The specific policy measures promoted under the Project will reduce \nthe implicit subsidies and taxes in the project area and beyond. For instance, the proposed \nreductions in the State mandatory quota for cotton and wheat at fixed prices in the five project \ndistricts will reduce the implicit taxes imposed on farmers\u2019 output, which will give the farmers the \nreal opportunity to  pay a significant part of the Amu Zang system\u2019s O&M  costs. This move will \nalso reduce the subsidies on cotton credit, since the cotton output beyond the mandatory quota \nis not eligible for subsidized advanced credit. Also, the proposed introduction of water delivery \nfees in five project districts will reduce the Government\u2019s direct financing of the system\u2019s O&M \ncosts. The proposed loan project (through its associated technical assistance)  is expected to \nassist the Government in developing a national cost recovery policy, which will have a much \ngreater impact in reducing the overall subsidies on irrigated agriculture in the long term, since \nthe core of the expected policy is to gradually shift O&M responsibilities from the central \nGovernment to regional authorities and eventually to beneficiaries through the development of \nWUAs.  \n23.  ADB\u2019s paper on subsidies discusses five conditions when subsidies are justifiable: (i) \nwhen a project produces positive externalities, where social returns from a project exceed \nprivate returns; (ii) in decreasing cost sectors, where individual producers need to be subsidized \nto attain a socially optimal level of output; (iii) when other distortions or the effects of other \ngovernment interventions have to be offset through subsidies; (iv) a case of redistribution, where \nsubsidies are targeted at reducing poverty; and (v) in the context of transitional economies, \nwhere weakly developed market institutions make the subsidies unavoidable. It can be argued \nthat conditions (iii) and (v) above are especially applicable to the Amu Zang Project. The \nGovernment currently imposes heavy output taxes for farmers in the project area through the \ncotton and wheat procurement system, which will cause the complete collapse of farming \nwithout counterbalancing subsidy schemes. Also, the rural market institutions in the transitional \neconomy of Uzbekistan are weak and often absent (for instance there are no viable rural finance \ninstitutions  or  farm  machinery  services),  a  situation  that  necessitates  to  a  certain  extent \nGovernment  subsidies  and  support.  The  subsidies  involved  in  the  Amu  Zang  Irrigation \nRehabilitation Project are justifiable on these grounds. However, the more important aspect of \nthe proposed Project is that it will promote further reductions in subsidies as well as implicit \ntaxes in the Amu Zang area through specific policy measures. For instance, the subsidies \nrelated to operating the Amu Zang irrigation system will be reduced through the introduction of \nwater  delivery  fees  and  the  promotion  of  private  sector-driven,  non-subsidized  agriculture \nmachinery services and WUAs. These measures will be preceded12 by reduction in implicit \ntaxation of farms in the Amu Zang area by relaxing the Government\u2019s mandatory procurement of \ncotton and wheat to a maximum 25% of historic average compared with the current 50%. \nD.  Economic Benefits \n24.  The Project will protect against future losses of production and will cause  production \nincreases when the Project is implemented.  Without the Project, cotton output will decrease \n                                                 \n11\n ADB. 1996. Bank Criteria for Subsidies. Manila. \n12\n While the introduction of water delivery fees and market-based agricultural machinery services and WUAs are \nexpected to take place starting the second year of the Project or later, the reductions in Government quota will take \nplace during the first year of the Project. ", "50   Appendix 8 \nfrom 114,000 tons to 73,000 tons in year 10; with the Project, it will increase to 136,000 tons, \ngiving a net benefit of 63,000 tons per year. Without the Project, wheat production will fall from \nthe present 128,000 tons to 119,000 tons in year 10; with the Project, it will increase to 165,000 \ntons to give a net benefit of 46,000 tons per year.  \n25.  Rehabilitating  the  pumping  stations  will  improve  pumping  efficiencies  and  reduce \npumping costs.  For current pumping volumes, this benefit amounts to $495,000 per year in \neconomic prices, with the full benefit accruing from the completion of project implementation. \n26.  The sediment control facility will reduce requirement for annual desilting of the main \ncanals.  This benefit is estimated at $250,000 per year. The sediment control facility will also \nreduce wear and tear caused by coarse silt particles on pumps. Because O&M costs are lower \nfor new pumps, rehabilitation of the pumping stations will lead to estimated savings of $95,000 \nper year.  \nE.  Economic Rates of Return, Sensitivity, and Risk Analyses \n27.  With economic prices calculated on the basis of the domestic price numeraire, the \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the proposed Project is 19.5% and the economic net \npresent value (NPV) at the discount rate of 12% is $51.7 million.13   \n28.  The EIRR is robust.  If cotton and wheat prices were to remain 10% below the assumed \nlevels throughout the project life, then the EIRR would  be 16.5% (Table A8.1).  Similarly, if \nyields were to fall 10% throughout the Project, the EIRR would decline to 18.2%. A 10% \nincrease in investment costs would lead to an EIRR of 18.2%.  If the accrual of project benefits \nis delayed by 1 year, then the EIRR would fall to 17.0%. In all cases, the EIRR remains well \nabove ADB\u2019s acceptable rate of 12%. A combination of 10% increase in input prices and \ninvestment costs coupled with a 10% fall in output prices would cause the EIRR to fall to 14.5%, \nbut this combination of events throughout the life of the Project is not likely. The switching \nvalues results suggest that for the EIRR to fall to 12% or the NPV to zero, output prices, \nincluding those of cotton and wheat, would have to fall by 23% or their yields by 46%, or project \ninvestment costs would have to increase by 75%. These are all unlikely scenarios. \nTable 8.1:   Sensitivity Analysis \nEIRR  NPV  Switching \nItem  Change  Indicatora \n(%)  ($)  Value (%) \nBase Case    19.5  51.7    - \nIncrease in Input Prices  +10%  18.8  46.2  (0.36)  +94% \nDecrease in Cotton, Wheat Prices  -10%  16.5  29.3  1.54  (23%) \nDecrease in Yields  -10%  18.2  41.7  0.67  (46%) \nDelay in Project Benefits  1 year  17.0  37.0     \nIncrease in Project Costs   +10%  18.1  44.8  (0.72)  +75% \nInput  Prices, +10%; Output Prices, -10%    15.7  23.8     \nInput  Costs, +10%; Output Prices, -10%    14.5  16.9     \na  Sensitivity indicator for EIRR. \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \n                                                 \n13\n The similar Karshi Pumping Cascade Rehabilitation Project (Phase I) prepared for World Bank funding had an \nEIRR of 16.2%. ", "Appendix 8  51 \n29.  Given the nature of the Project, an analysis was made of the individual parts of the \ncascade.14 The EIRR is 29.0% for the Amu Zang I pumping station and 21.8% for Amu Zang II. \nA similar analysis was made for Babatag, based on the rehabilitation costs in the proposed \nProject.15 The EIRR is  10.1%.16 \n30.  Project engineers  estimate that if the Babatag pump station is not rehabilitated, its \nremaining life is only about 5 years. The original, experimental pumps are difficult to maintain. \nAgriculture in the area is completely dependent on irrigation and without it only a very small \nproportion of the more than 12,000 households in the area could be supported by grazing \nlivestock. With no rehabilitation, most of these households would be without any livelihood within \na few years since opportunities for alternative employment in the area are limited.  Using a \nmethodology proposed by a recent World Bank study,17 a comparison was made of potential lost \nincome and the cost of rehabilitation. Over 10 years, the NPV of rehabilitation costs is about half \nthe NPV of lost income, suggesting  that rehabilitation would be cheaper than compensating \nhouseholds in the event of system failure. \n31.  In addition to the usual sensitivity analysis, use was made of the @Risk software to look \nin more detail at the probable outcome of variations in the key variables. Using triangular \ndistributions, values were defined as follows: \n\u2022  input and output prices and project costs: \u00b1 20% \n\u2022  electricity price, yields, and O&M costs: \u00b1 10% \n\u2022  system efficiency: minimum 45%, maximum 60% \n\u2022  SERF:  minimum 1.0, maximum 1.8 \n32.  The  result  of  risk  analysis  indicated  that  the  mean  value  of  the  EIRR,  with  these \nassumptions, is 20.3%. The standard deviation is 3.2% and the probability of the EIRR being \nless than 12% is less than 1%. \nF.  Financial Returns \n1.  Farm Budgets \n33.  Farm budget analysis was carried out to determine the impact of the Project on farm \nhouseholds and the extent of incentives for farmers to participate in and benefit from the Project. \nDekhan farms are more intensively cultivated and more productive than the larger farms and are \nthe source of most of  fruit and vegetables. The average cropping intensity on dekhan farms is \nover 140%, that on larger farms is less than 110%. Nationally, dekhan farms generated 70% of \n                                                 \n14\n For Amu Zang I and II pump stations, this analysis assumed the full, not partial, rehabilitation of the pumping \nstations, excluding the capacity required to supply the Babatag canal.  The full cost of the sediment control facility \nwas included and a prorata portion of the costs of the other project components was included. \n15\n Thirty percent of other infrastructure costs were included since Babatag has this percentage of system capacity.  \nCosts for other project components are prorated according to command area. \n16\n ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects notes that, \u201cThe Bank would expect to accept independent \nprojects and subprojects with an EIRR between 10 and 12% for which additional unvalued  benefits can be \ndemonstrated, and where they are expected to exceed unvalued costs.\u201d (para.140 of the Guidelines). \n17\n In World Bank. 2003.

", "52   Appendix 8 \ntotal growth in farm output between 1996  and 2001 with the remainder coming from private \nfarms. The output of shirkats during the same period was more or less unchanged. \n34.  For each farm type, farm budgets were prepared for each main canal to reflect the \ndifferent pumping costs of water.  Other assumptions were the following: \n(i)  Farm size is the present average for each type of farm for each canal; the \nprivatization of shirkats reduces the area of shirkats and increases the number \nand total area of private farms. \n(ii)  Present cropping patterns are based on provincial government data for 2002. \nShirkat and private farms grow mostly cotton and wheat, and dekhan farms grow \nwheat  and  other  crops.  Future  cropping  patterns  will  reflect  greater  crop \ndiversification.  \n(iii)  The costs of crop production reflect the use of machinery by private and shirkat \nfarms, generally higher labor usage by shirkat than by private farms, and the use \nof labor-intensive production methods on dekhan farms. \n(iv)  Current yields are similar for private and shirkat farms but generally higher for \ndekhan farms. Over 10 years, yields will increase by 15\u201320% depending on the \ncrop and farm type, with private farms having larger productivity increases than \nshirkats. \n(v)  the pumping costs of water are estimated based on farm cropping characteristics \nand the estimated per cubic meter (m3) energy requirements for pumping water \nand its location; future per m3 energy requirements decrease for any rehabilitated \npumping station. \n(vi)  Since the Government is committed to introducing charges for O&M over time, \npartial recovery of O&M costs was included in the farm budgets on the following \nbasis: (a) maintenance of on-farm systems at $6 per ha per year; (b) O&M for the \npump stations, excluding energy costs, at $3 per ha per year; (c) O&M of the \nmain canal system at $7 per ha per year; and (d) 20% of estimated water \npumping costs.  These costs are phased in over 6 years, starting in project year \n2.  \n35.  Farm net incomes for the proposed project are given in Table A8.2. Net incomes both \nexcluding and including pumping costs are shown. These are 3\u20134 times higher for farms on the \nBabatag canal than for those on the Amu Zang canal. On the Zang canal, pumping costs are \nonly 10% more than for the Amu Zang canal, despite the higher lift, since 45% of annual \nrequirements are supplied by gravity from the Surkhandarya River. \n36.  As the farm net income analysis shows, the Project leads to increased incomes for farm \nhouseholds.  Using the cost recovery measures described in para. 34, in terms of financial \nprices, the net income for shirkats will increase from about $175 per ha now to $207 per ha by \nyear 5 and $254 by year 10.  Net incomes for private farms will increase from $123 per ha now \nto $242 per ha in year 5 and to $356 per ha in year 10. For dekhan farms the expected increase \nis from $721 per ha now to $806 per ha in year 5 and $936 per ha in year 10.  \n37.  The recovered O&M costs amount to $22.50 per ha on the Amu Zang canal, $24 per ha \non the Zang canal, and $43 per ha on the Babatag canal.  While the cost for Babatag farms is \nhigher than for other farms, cost recovery at these levels is affordable to farm households and \nthere is scope eventually to increase the percentage of pumping costs recovered from farmers, ", "Appendix 8  53 \nat least on the Amu Zang and Zang canals.  If a private farm on the Zang canal were to pay the \nfull pumping cost, cost recovery in year 5 would be $42 per ha or 15% of estimated net income \nbefore water costs. On the Babatag canal, paying the full cost in year 5 would cost a private \nfarmer $136 per ha or close to 50% of net income.  Due to lower water requirements, cost \nrecovery with payment of full pumping costs for a dekhan farmer on the Babatag canal would be \nabout one third of net income. \n38.  In conclusion, the farm budget analysis shows that the Project will generate positive \nfinancial returns for farm households on all three main canals. \nTable 8.2:   Farm Net Income in Financial Prices  \n($ per hectare) \nFuture with Project  Future without Project \nPresent  Year 5  Year 10  Year 5  Year 10 \nWater \nExclude  Include  Exclude Include Exclude  Include  Exclude  Include Exclude Include \nCharges \nDekhan Farms   \n   Amu Zang I  721  682  810  778  968  936  650  618  503  482 \n   Amu Zang II  721  672  796  756  913  875  650  609  502  475 \n   Babatag  721  553  838  704  996  860  402  320  165  141 \n   Average  721  650  806  748  936  879  601  553  436  410 \n                   \nPrivate Farms                     \n   Amu Zang I  123  93  245  217  365  338  171  144  134  116 \n   Amu Zang II  123  85  243  207  354  320  170  136  133  110 \n   Babatag  123  (8)  239  122  358  247  45  (17)  (19)  (34) \n   Average  123  68  242  191  356  308  146  107  103  82 \nShirkat Farms                     \n   Amu Zang I  175  144  210  185  261  239  163  137  124  106 \n   Amu Zang II  175  136  207  176  255  226  162  128  123  99 \n   Babatag  175  38  207  105  246  153  75  7  (9)  (28) \n   Average  175  118  207  163  254  213  145  105  97  75 \n                   \n \nExclude = energy costs of pumping excluded except for proposed cost recovery; Include = energy costs of \npumping fully included. \n \n2.  Agricultural Service Centers \n39.  Since the Project proposes the establishment of five ASCs, an analysis was carried out \nto demonstrate their financial viability. A credit line will be provided through commercial banks to \nqualified borrowers wishing to establish an ASC. The ASCs, which will provide farm machinery \nrental, input supply, and output marketing services, would initially operate in the project pilot \nareas and focus on providing farm machinery services. Much of the machinery equipment in \nthese pilot areas is old and there is a demand for combine harvesters for wheat, tractors, and a \nwide range of equipment for plowing, cultivating, and other crop activities. The ASCs would \npurchase  a  selection  of  harvesters,  tractors,  and  associated  equipment,  depending  on  its \nassessment of demand and the services it can profitably sell in its chosen area of operation. ", "54   Appendix 8 \n40.  Each ASC will have an initial capital of $800,000 of which at least 20% must be provided \nby the owners and up to 80% will be available from the Project. To assess the financial viability \nof a typical ASC, $650,00018 has been allocated for purchase of equipment, $50,000 for a site \nfor the center and office equipment, and $100,000 as working capital for input supply and output \nmarketing operations. Based on working hours and charge rates19 for each type of equipment \nand an assumed net 10% return on capital used for input supply, the NPV for 25 years at a \ndiscount rate of 12% is $478,000 and the financial internal rate of return is 25.9%. The results \nsuggest not only that the proposed ASCs will be viable but that they will also have scope to \nprovide a competitive service to farmers. \nG.  Benefit Distribution and Poverty Analysis \n41.  Poverty incidence in the project area is 31.4%, slightly above the national average.  \nBecause  of  dependence  on  irrigated  agriculture  and  lack  of  alternative  employment \nopportunities, there is potential for a sharp increase in the incidence of poverty if agriculture \ndeclines.20  Poverty in the area is associated with unemployment, employment in budget-funded \nagencies or on shirkats, and low skill levels. For most poor households the cultivation of dekhan \nplots is important for subsistence, but these households are more likely than others to have poor \naccess to irrigation21 and to lack the resources to maximize output.  Poor households will benefit \nfrom improved irrigation service, especially in the project pilot areas and other areas where \nWUAs are established and on-farm water management is enhanced. The Project will also \ngenerate a demand for an additional 1.4 million days of labor per year by year 10 and will avoid \nthe without-project loss of 1.9 million days. Almost 60% of this additional labor will accrue to \npoor households as owners of dekhan farms or as laborers on private and shirkat farms. \n42.  Based on the distribution of project effects and the poverty impact analysis, the poverty \nimpact ratio for the Project is 0.41. Since this ratio is above the poverty incidence ratio of 0.314, \npoor households will benefit relatively more from the Project than with other stakeholder groups. \n                                                 \n18\n The package of equipment includes one secondhand combine harvester, four large tractors, a selection of tractor \ntrailing equipment, two vehicles, and associated spare parts. \n19\n The evaluation used the detailed costs and charge rates developed for the Grain Production Improvement Project. \n20\n The project area, Surkhandarya Province, is located in the southernmost part of Uzbekistan, some 700 kilometers \nfrom Tashkent.  Because of its border with Afghanistan, access to the province has been restricted, thus limiting \nthe development of the economy of the province. \n21\n The recent World Bank study  Irrigation in Central Asia: Social, Economic and Environmental Considerations \n(February 2003) concluded that irrigation is particularly important to poor households, which tend to have irrigation \non a smaller proportion of their land and would suffer disproportionately if irrigation systems contract.   ", "Appendix 9  55 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector Identified as a National Priority in Country Poverty Analysis \n \nThe Government in coordination with international organizations has facilitated in-depth poverty analysis, \nthe most recent being the World Bank\u2019s Living Standard Assessment (LSA), and the United Nation\u2019s \nDevelopment Programme\u2019s (UNDP\u2019s) study, Linking Macroeconomic Growth Policy to Poverty Reduction \nin Uzbekistan. In addition, there is an ongoing Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance (TA) \non formulating a living standard strategy.1 All these undertakings highlight the catalytic role of sustainable \nrural development as key to poverty reduction in the country.  \n \nIn the past decade, the Government introduced reforms that would increase growth in the agriculture \nsector and reduce rural poverty. The land policy that allocated additional plots (dekhan) to families for \nprivate use and restructured collective and state farms into agricultural cooperatives (shirkats) intensified \nthe use of scarce land and demonstrated the efficiency of private-run farms. To promote food security, the \nGovernment undertook measures that increased the crop area devoted to wheat production and reduced \nthe  area  for  cotton  production.  The  development  of  agriculture  remains  among  the  priorities  of  the \nGovernment  in  2003  as  more  reforms  are  planned  for  implementation,  including  liberalization  of \nagricultural activity through the reduction of State orders for cotton and grain, rehabilitation of irrigation \nsystems, institutional development through water users associations (WUAs), and the development of \nagricultural services in processing and marketing.  \n \nSector Identified as a National Priority in Country Poverty Partnership Agreement \n \nThe country does not have a poverty partnership agreement, but is in the process of formulating its \nnational living standard strategy for improving the living standards of the people. In discussions on the \nliving standard strategy, rural development is viewed as a key strategy for reducing poverty in the rural \nareas where most of the poor reside. Productivity-enhancing measures (such as improvement of irrigation \nsystems) in existing agriculture activities, institutional measures (like development  of WUAs to ensure \nsustainable and efficient use of irrigation water), and market reforms have been identified as key areas for \ndecreasing rural income poverty. \n \nContribution of the Sector/Subsector to Reduce Poverty in Uzbekistan \n \nAgriculture contributed  34% of the national gross domestic product (GDP) in 2002 and about 40% of \nexports in Uzbekistan. The sector provides employment for approximately one third of the country\u2019s \npopulation and about 50% of its rural population.  \n \nThe contribution of Surkhandarya Province to the national GDP was 8% in 2002. The districts within the \nproject area produced 38% of the agricultural output of the region, although they have less than 30% of \nthe region\u2019s population. The climate of the region is suitable for producing a variety of cash crops, such as \noff-season vegetables, indigenous fruits, and high-quality fine-fiber cotton. Their production provided \nadditional jobs and income to the local population.  \n \nIntensive use of irrigated agriculture in the project area can significantly contribute to reducing income \npoverty. A World Bank\u2019s study2 concluded that because of the arid conditions in Uzbekistan, irrigation of \nits agriculture lands is vitally important and access to irrigation water is directly linked to rural incomes. \nSpecifically, conversion of irrigated to non-irrigated land can decrease income by more than 30% (footnote \n2); in South Uzbekistan, a decrease of 10% in rural incomes would increase poverty incidence to 14.3%.3 \nT   h u  s  ,   a    d  e  t e r  io  r a  t i o  n    o f    th  e    A   m  u   Zang system was estimated to increase poverty rate in the project area \n1\n ADB. 2001.

", "   56 Appendix 9 \nThus, a deterioration of the Amu Zang system was estimated to increase poverty rate in the project area \nby as much as 44%. Within the Babatag canal command area where alternative sources of irrigation are \nunavailable poverty rate would rise to more than 50%. \n \nB.   Poverty Analysis                                             Proposed Classification: Pro-poor growth \nThe population of the Amu Zang canal command area is about 400,000. The World Bank\u2019s LSA (2003) \nestimated that in 2000, 28.4% of the population of Surkhandarya region had incomes below the poverty \nline.4  Based on an in-depth survey complemented with intensive interviews conducted in the project area \nin April 2003, the poverty threshold was found to be SUM6,528 per capita per month and poverty \nincidence was 31.4%; this is equivalent to 130,000 people or about 16,500 households.5 Poor households \nreceive about 61% of their income from agriculture. They have limited opportunity to increase their income \nbecause  they  lack  access  to  means  of  production  such  as  equipment  and  credit  and  have  limited \nresources for migration; their family heads, who lack higher educational and vocational training and have \nno other job opportunities, farm their household plots or work on other farms. Of the households surveyed, \n40% spend more than 65% of their total disposable income on food. Only 5% of the total survey \nrespondents met the recommended standard for meat consumption, while 15.3% did not consume meat at \nall in the past month. The average expenditure per family member in a poor household amounts to \nSUM3,750, which is 3.6 times lower than the average expenses of  nonpoor families (SUM13,423 ). \n  \nAbout 44% of the poor in the project area reside in Djarkurgan and Kumkurgan districts, which are the \ncommand area of the Babatag canal; 39% in the remote Muzrabad district; and 22% and 23% in Angor \nand Termez districts, respectively. The poor comprise 43% among shirkat workers and 31.6% among \ndekhan farmers; there are no poor among private farmers. There are more poor people who have no \nhousehold plots (4 times more than nonpoor families) or do not farm their plots due to lack of resources \n(the number of poor families that do not cultivate their plots is 1.5 times more than that of nonpoor \nfamilies), or do not sell agricultural products grown on their plots in the market (two thirds of poor \nhouseholds do not have money income from their household plots in contrast to 30% of non-poor \nfamilies). Consumption per person from household plots, translated into money income, is 2.2 times lower \nin poor families than in nonpoor families. While the average household plot size is 0.2 ha, among poor \nfamilies, the plot size is 0.13 ha. \n \nUnemployment rate in the project area is high among poor families (17.5%). Low income from the farms \nand limited job opportunities are the main causes  of rural income poverty. On shirkat farms, low and \ndelayed salaries are the cause of poverty. For the dekhan households, which are the most efficient and \nproductive in the use of land among the farm types, incomes are still low due to low total output. Because \nof uncertain employment in agriculture and underemployment due to the small sizes of family plots, \nproduction efficiency and labor productivity if the sector are low. Opportunities for self-employment in \n                                                 \n4\n The World Bank. 2003. LSA defined the poverty threshold based on the expenditure approach to ensure the \nrequired calories 2,100 cal per person per day.  The food-based poverty line for Uzbekistan would amount to \nSUM3,601 per month in October 2000 prices. Poverty head count rate was 30.5% for rural regions of Uzbekistan. \nIn the UNDP study (2003), the poverty line was based on a per capita family income required to purchase the basic \nfood items that would be equivalent to 2,100 cal per person per day. UNDP used SUM2,916 in 2001 prices and \nobtained a poverty incidence of 16%. As of this date, however, the Government has not officially adopted the \npoverty threshold definition recommended by the World Bank or by UNDP. \n5\n There is no official poverty line in Uzbekistan. One option was to use the World Bank-recommended poverty line by \nemploying the same household budget survey (HBS) data for Surkhandarya and adjusting the prices to 2003 \nlevels. This option however, was not possible as the HBS data could not be accessed from the Government and \nthe appropriate consumer price index for the region were not available. The other option was to conduct a small-\nscale household survey and a rapid participatory rural assessment. The consumption expenditure approach of the \nWorld Bank was adopted in defining the poverty line; it was also improved as data on food consumption from the \nhousehold plots were imputed in determining the poverty line. The poverty threshold was verified through in-depth \ninterviews and the amount obtained was SUM6,528 (about $6.50 at April 2003 exchange rate values) per capita \nper month; poverty incidence in the project area was 31.4%. The poverty profile based on the data of the \nhousehold survey was consistent with the findings of the World Bank\u2019s LSA. ", "Appendix 9  57 \nnonagriculture  are  very  limited  because  of  lack of capital resources, underdeveloped markets, and \nlegislative restrictions that inhibit private sector development.  \n \nAs cited by the survey respondents, the major problems encountered in crop production, by degree of \nimportance, are (i) lack of irrigation water, (ii) poor condition of drainage systems, (iii) delays in obtaining \ngood quality seeds and fertilizers, (iv) poor soil fertility and high salinity, (v) limited access to new \ntechnologies and farm practices, and (vi) high costs for transporting produce to markets. In addition, 80% \nof the private farmers surveyed complained of lack of farm machinery. Moreover, unlike dekhan farmers, \nprivate farmers are discouraged from producing more due to the State-determined quotas for wheat and \ncotton production. \n \nAlthough the survey identified poor supply of drinking water as a concern in the project area, that \ncomponent was not included in the project scope for several reasons. In view of the large investment size \nand technical complexity of the Project, the Government considered it prudent to keep the project design \nand implementation structure as simple as possible. The Government further clarified that the problems \nrelated to drinking water in the project districts are being resolved through its own program as  well as \nthrough  a  number  of  other  aid-financed  projects  including  those  of  the  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational Development (USAID) and Japan Social Development Fund.6 \nC.  Participation Process \n A rapid participatory rural appraisal (PRA) was conducted in April-May 2003. Key stakeholders were \ninvolved in the participation process that included a survey, which covered over 500 households and 182 \nfarmers as respondents, and 57 in-depth interviews of various stakeholder groups.  Special emphasis was \naccorded to vulnerable groups, especially the poor and women. \n \nThe stakeholders of the Project include both poor and nonpoor farmers, women, farm laborers, agricultural \ninputs suppliers, agricultural procurement and financing organizations, construction organizations, national \nand province authorities, land and water resources management organizations. The vulnerable groups in \nthe project area are women, the unemployed, persons without work experience, shirkat workers, families \nwho only have household plots, and communities wherein ethnic Turkmens (about 2% of the project \narea\u2019s population), who are the poorest ethnic group, live. \n \nThe project monitoring and evaluation and participation plans will maximize the involvement of all groups \nof  stakeholders  (including  representatives  from  national  and  regional  governments,  private-run \nenterprises,  research  and  educational  institutions,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  agricultural \noperators, and the poor and vulnerable groups) especially in project implementation and evaluations. To \nincrease  project  awareness  and  mobilize  the  participation  of  the  stakeholders,  various  participation \nmethods including opinion polls, seminars, consultations, negotiations, and information campaigns will be \nused. \n \nProject evaluation will be based on the following sets of indicators: (i) indicators on living standards and \nquality of life of the population, (ii) irrigation water supply indicators, (iii) tenure and agricultural production \nperformance, (iv) institutional development, (v) employment indicators, (vi) environmental indicators, and \n(vii) stakeholders participation indicators. Each set of indicators will take into account gender and ethnic \nconsiderations. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n \n6\n The Government has ongoing program  of $20.2 million in the project province. USAID and Japan Social \nDevelopment Fund each has one ongoing grant-based project in the project province with a budget of $1.5 million ", "   58 Appendix 9 \n \nD.            Gender Development \n \nWhile both men and women seem to have lost jobs in equal proportion, women appear to have had a \nmore difficult time than men do in finding formal employment. At the national level, the rate of women \namong the officially unemployed was 62% in 2001. In the project area only 34% of women who seek \nemployment have jobs. Although women provide at least 37% of the household\u2019s income, women are \noften employed in the low-paying jobs of the state-funded social sector, and manual and seasonal \nactivities in the agriculture and informal sectors. The average wage of women in Surkhandarya is 82% the \nwages of men. Women employed in shirkats also have less access to social security benefits. It was also \nnoted that 40% of those surveyed were of the opinion that women should not be involved in agriculture-\nrelated management activities. \n \nLower female participation rates in the workforce are partly explained by high fertility rate and partly by \ncultural factors. Women with very young children are less likely to participate in the labor force, as married \nwomen especially in the rural areas are expected to take care of their offspring. A study noted that an \nadditional child under 5 years of age reduces the female participation rate by more than 7% (footnote 3). \nAside from rearing the young and performing household chores, rural women are in charge of the garden \nplots and livestock as well as of fetching water for drinking. Hence, access to regular supply of water for \nirrigation and for drinking is very important in lessening rural women\u2019s burden of performing multiple roles.  \n \nThe overall gender strategy of the Project has a twofold objective: (i) reduce the economic burden of \nwomen in the project area, and (ii) improve their capacity to participate in agriculture management. This \nwill done by (i) increasing the household\u2019s access to a regular supply of water for irrigating their household \nplots, (ii) ensuring that women participate in agriculture service centers, (iii) maximizing the participation of \nwomen in technical and management skills training activities and project designs, (iii) providing gender \nand development training in WUAs, and (iv) ensuring women\u2019s membership in the WUAs.  \n \n \n \nE.
