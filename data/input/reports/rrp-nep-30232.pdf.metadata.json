An  initial  environmental  examination  was  undertaken, \nand the summary is a supplementary appendix. \n  \nThe Project will address the development needs of conflict-affected \ncommunities by promoting inclusive processes that seek to restore \nincomes  and  connect  the  rural  poor,  and  those  that  have  been \ntraditionally  excluded  from  the  development  process,  to  markets \nand  economic  opportunities \nrural \ninfrastructure  and  livelihood  restoration  facilities.  The  Project  will \nextend  the  network  of  improved  rural  transport  infrastructure, \nconsisting \nbridges. \nThe  Project  will  also  invest  in  small,  community  socioeconomic \ninfrastructure,  and  provide  jobs,  empower  conflict-affected  rural \ncommunities  for  development,  increase  institutional  capacity,  and \nimprove \nLabor-based, \nenvironmentally  friendly,  and  participatory  approaches  will  ensure \nrehabilitation  of \nthat \ninfrastructure  results  in  sustainable,  improved  access  to  economic \nand social services, and enhanced social and financial capital. The \nProject  will  improve  the  livelihoods  of  people  in  the  project  areas, \nparticularly the poor, who constitute about 70% of the population in \nthe  subproject  areas.  The  Project  will  be  located  in  18  districts, \nincluding 14 districts in the Western, Midwestern, and Far Western, \nregions  that  are  among  the  poorest  in  the  country  and  most \naffected by the conflict. The districts have been selected on the \nbasis  of  their  high  incidence  and  intensity  of  poverty,  need  to \naddress  causes  of  the  conflict,  need  for  improved  access  and \nimplementation  manageability \nenhanced \nconsiderations.

The \nGovernment  regards  this  as  a  flagship  project  that  addresses \ndevelopment  challenges  posed  by  the  conflict  and  that  will \ncontribute to the operational strategies for poverty reduction in the \nGovernment's  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan.  The  Project  also  addresses \ntwo  key  causes  of  slow  agricultural  growth  and  limited  rural  jobs, \nincluding  (i)  lack  of  an  effective  and  properly  maintained  rural \ntransportation  network;  and  (ii)  weak  institutions,  constrained \ngovernment  service  delivery,  and  lack  of  beneficiary  participation. \nThe  Project  will  also  improve  the  livelihood  opportunities  of \ncommunities  seriously  affected  by  the  conflict,  and  particularly  of \nsocially excluded groups. \n \nThe project goal is to reduce rural poverty in 18 very poor remote \nhill and mountain districts affected by the conflict. The purpose is \nto  achieve  sustainable  increased  access  to  economic  and  social \nservices,  and  enhanced  social  and  financial  capital  for  people  in \nthe project area, particularly poor and disadvantaged groups. \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $62.3  million  equivalent, \ncomprising  foreign  exchange  of  $5.3  million,  and  local  currency  of \n$57.0 million equivalent.

DOLIDAR  has  established  a  project \ncoordination  unit  (PCU)  in  Kathmandu,  headed  by  a  project \ncoordinator  to  coordinate  all  project  activities.  The  PCU  will  be \nresponsible \nfor  guiding  and  monitoring  district  development \ncommittees (DDCs) as they implement project components. At the \ndistrict level, project implementation will be the responsibility of the \ndistrict project office (DPO) within the district technical office of each \nDDC. A local engineering consultant to cover technical issues, and \na  local  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)  engaged  for  social \nmobilization and support for rural infrastructure building groups will \nsupport  the  DPO.  A  working-level  implementation  coordination \ncommittee will be established to guide the PCU.  \n \nGoods,  related  services,  and  civil  works  financed  by  ADB  will  be \nprocured  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  All  civil \nworks  will  be  small  and  widely  dispersed,  and  most  will  be \nundertaken by unskilled community labor. The works will be small, \nwith  an  average  value  of  $10,000\u2013$15,000  equivalent,  and  follow \nADB\u2019s  guidelines  on  community  participation  in  procurement.

Farmers  living  within  the \ninfluence  area  of  rural  transport  infrastructure  subprojects  will \nbenefit from better access to markets, sources of production inputs, \nand extension services. Transport costs and time to procure inputs \nand  market  surpluses  will  be  reduced.  With  better  market  access \nfarmers  will  be  able  to  consider  expanding  production  and \ncultivating  high-value  crops.  Productive  agriculture,  reduced  travel \ncosts, and improved access to services for subproject beneficiaries \nwill create on- and off-farm rural jobs. The Project will also generate \nsignificant,  but  not  easily  quantifiable,  benefits, \nincluding \nlocal  poor  people,  capacity  building, \nconstruction \nrural \nimprovements \ncommunities of health and educational services. \n \nApproximately 2.5 million people live in the selected districts, 1.5 \nmillion  below  the  poverty  line.  About  800,000\u20131,200,00  people, \n65%  (520,000\u2013780,000)  or  more  of  whom  are  poor,  will  directly \ninvestments.  Of  poor \nbenefit \nbeneficiaries,  about  25% \nfrom \ndisadvantaged  castes.  About  780,000  poor  people  will  directly \nbenefit  through  increased  wage  income  of  around  25%  during \nthe  subproject  and  supplementary  investment  construction,  and \n200,000 people will be lifted out of poverty. Employment totaling \n34,700  person-years  is  expected  to  be  created  by  the  project \ninfrastructure investments.  \n \nThe  armed  conflict  and  instability  represent  a  project  risk.  The \nproject  districts  include  those  that  are  active  sites  for  conflict.  In \ngeneral, the experience of development partners working in conflict \nareas  is  that  the  insurgents  have  not  hindered  rural  infrastructure \nproject  implementation,  since  rural  communities  attach  a  high \npriority  to  improving  livelihoods  and  rural  access.  The  Project  will \nseek to work gradually through local people with the assistance of \nlocal NGOs, and emphasize transparency and flexibility. Achieving \ntangible benefits for communities as quickly as possible is also an \nimportant success factor in working in conflict areas. Based on the \nexperience  of  other  ongoing  projects, \nrural \ninfrastructure  and  livelihood  projects  is  possible  in  conflict  areas  if \nthe above approaches are taken. \n\n(130,000\u2013195,000)  are \n\ninfrastructure \n\nimplementing \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\nvii\n\nA  risk  associated  with  achieving  the  intended  long-term  benefits \nfrom  improved  rural  transport  infrastructure  is  that  the  roads  will \nnot  be  maintained \nin  good  condition.  During  project \nimplementation the risk is that DDCs may not be able to mobilize \nto  maintain  project-financed  and  other \nsufficient  resources \nmotorable  links  in  rural  road  networks.  The  project  design \nmitigates  this  risk  by  providing  financing  support  and  by  setting \ntargets  to  be  achieved  by  the  districts  at  different  stages  during \nto  assess  DDCs\u2019 \nimplementation,  which  will  be  monitored \nperformance.  This  approach  will  be  supported  by  measures  to \ncreate  a  maintenance  culture  in  the  project  districts,  and  to \nestablish local capacity for planned maintenance. In the long term \nthe risks are that measures already proposed by the Government \nfor  sustainable  financing  of  rural  road  maintenance,  from  central \nand local resources, will not be put in place nationwide, and that \nDDCs  will  revert  to  investing  limited  funds  in  new  roads  rather \nthan  maintaining  the  network.  The  first  risk  will  be  addressed \nthrough  continuing  policy  dialogue  between  ADB  and \nthe \nGovernment.  The  proposed  institutional  development  technical \nassistance (TA) will help address the second risk by strengthening \nto  provide  maintenance  management \nDOLIDAR\u2019s  capacity \nguidance  and  direction  to  DDCs,  and  to  monitor  rural  road \nmaintenance performance nationwide. \n \nInstitutional  development  TA  will  also  be  provided  for  capacity \nbuilding  of  DOLIDAR,  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA \nfunding  program.  The  TA  will  support  capacity  development  in \nDOLIDAR  in  a  number  of  key  complementary  areas,  but  with  a \nsector  perspective.  The  TA  will  also  continue  to  develop  national \npolicies and strategies that previous ADB technical assistance has \nsupported, particularly to further decentralization. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\ni\n\nx\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe  Kingdom  of  Nepal  for  the  Decentralized  Rural  Infrastructure  and  Livelihood  Project.1  The \nreport  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity  Building  in  Rural \nInfrastructure  Institutions,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nWith  poverty  incidence  estimated  at  38%,  Nepal  is  one  of  the  poorest  countries  in  the \nworld.  Poverty  is  concentrated  in  rural  areas  where  its  incidence  (44%)  is  almost  double  that  in \nurban areas (23%). The incidence of poverty in the Midwestern and Far Western regions (72%) \nand  in  the  mountain  districts  (56%)  is  much  greater  than  the  national  average.  The  hill  and \nmountain  districts  of  the  Midwestern  and  Far  Western  regions  rank  the  lowest  in  terms  of \nsocioeconomic and infrastructure development. They have substantially lower livelihood indicators \nand  road  densities  than  other  areas  of  Nepal,  and  limited  market  access  worsens  their  poverty. \nDisadvantaged  ethnic  groups  and  castes  in  these  districts  are  among  the  poorest  people  in  the \ncountry, with human development indicators significantly lower than those for other caste groups. \nSuch  deprivation,  inequality,  and  discrimination  have  contributed  to  the  spread  of  the  conflict  in \nNepal.  \n \nThe development of the strategic road network (SRN)2 has long been a government priority, \n3. \nresulting  in  around  3,000  kilometers  (km)  of  national  highways  providing  the  main  strategic \nconnections nationwide, and nearly 2,000 km of feeder roads connecting highways to regional and \ndistrict headquarters and to major economic centers. Within about 2 years all but five of the hill and \nmountain  district  centers  should  be  connected  to  the  SRN.  Nepal  has  an  estimated  6,600  km  of \ndistrict roads, most of which are earthen. The Department of Local Infrastructure Development and \nAgricultural  Roads  (DOLIDAR)  has  estimated  that  the  country  has  14,000  km  of  rural  roads  (in \ndistricts and villages), but over 25% are officially listed as not motorable. About 130,000 km of main \ntrails and at least 900 pedestrian suspension bridges are estimated to exist. Most people in remote \nhill and mountain districts live more than a day\u2019s walk from a road, and overall poverty increases with \npoorer physical access. A number of districts have no roads at all, and in most districts road density \nis  0.5\u20131.7  km  per  100  square  km,  and  0.9\u20132.7  km  per  10,000  people.  Only  districts  with  feeder \nroads  have  substantially  higher  figures.  These  data  compare  poorly  with  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan \ntargets of 8 km and 4 km, respectively.3  \n \nWhile considerable efforts have been made in the past decade to strengthen maintenance \n4. \ncapacity for the SRN, maintenance systems for rural roads are poorly developed. The Government \nhas created an independent Road Board with a road maintenance fund. About 30% of the fund\u2019s \nannual  disbursements  must  be  allocated  to  roads  owned  by  local  bodies  (district \n\n                                                 \n1   Project preparatory technical assistance (TA) was provided under ADB. 2001.

Manila. \n\n2   The SRN comprises highways connecting Kathmandu to all the borders and joining the main north-south valleys and \nregional  headquarters.  The  SRN  also  includes  feeder  roads  that  connect  from  highways  to  district  and  zonal \nheadquarters, major places of industry, tourism, public utilities, and power generation. \n\n3   Tenth Five-Year Plan targets have abandoned this approach and aim to increase the overall network by about 1,000 \n\nkm and to reconstruct approximately 2,500 km of roads. \n\n\fAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\ndevelopment  committees  [DDCs],  municipalities,  and  village  development  committees  [VDCs]), \nwhich  must  provide  25%  in  matching  funds.  However,  DDCs  lack  the  funds  to  implement \nDOLIDAR\u2019s  National  Plan  for  Rural  Road  Maintenance  (2000),  and  many  districts  still  have \ninadequate capacity to undertake satisfactory maintenance management. Adequate maintenance \nof the rapidly expanding network of rural roads will need to be prioritized for several years. \n \nB. \n \nThe  conflict  has  displaced  about  400,000  landowners,  and  directly  affected  about  2.4 \n5. \nmillion people, primarily in the three western regions. Infrastructure (primarily government offices, \nand police stations, rather than roads and other infrastructure) has been damaged and economic \nactivity disrupted, with direct impacts on the livelihoods of millions of rural dwellers. Disruption of \nagricultural  activities  and  markets,  and  migration  and  displacement  of  productive  workers  have \nundermined  food  security,  particularly  in  western  Nepal.  Two  key  problems  constraining  poverty \nreduction in rural hill and mountain areas are the adverse terrain and low agricultural productivity. \nThese  are  linked  because  poor  access  to  inputs,  services,  and  markets  due  to  rugged  terrain \nmakes it hard to increase agricultural productivity. Improved physical access is a prerequisite for \nsignificant economic development, mainly through reduced transport costs, leading to (i) increased \nconsumer  spending,  (ii)  diversified  agricultural  production,  (iii)  better  provision  of  services  by \ngovernment  agencies,  (iv)  greater  use  of  services  and  facilities,  and  (v)  better  access  to \ninformation and knowledge of development opportunities. A subsector analysis is in Appendix 1. \n \n6. \nSince  the  1960s  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  has  been  to  develop  the  SRN  linking \nKathmandu  to  the  borders,  main  administrative  centers,  and  major  economic  centers.  The  next \nstage is to reduce poverty through a substantial increase of the SRN. Construction of rural roads \nconnecting to strategic roads is guided by targets in the national 5-year plans, but otherwise is left \nto individual DDCs to plan through district transport master plans (DTMPs). The last 10 years have \nseen a major shift of external funding agency support to rural roads, with increasing emphasis on \npoverty  reduction  as  a  goal  rather  than  economic  growth  stimulated  by  increased  agricultural \nproduction. The pressing need throughout Nepal for basic infrastructure, which is expensive given \nthe  difficult  terrain,  has  led  to  reliance  on  external  assistance  to  provide  the  initial  capital \ninvestment (Appendix 2). Asian Development Bank (ADB), World Food Programme, World Bank, \nUnited Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development, Swiss Agency for Development and \nCooperation  (SDC),  Government  of  Germany\u2019s  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit \n(GTZ), Netherlands Development Organization, and other external funding agencies are active in \nthe sector. Shared experience has led to a convergence of project approaches, and joint initiatives \nare  now  common  and  will  be  used  by  the  Project.  The  project  approaches  all  aim  to  reduce \npoverty  and  improve  livelihoods,  using  local  infrastructure  development  as  a  means  to  an  end \nrather than, as previously, an end in itself. \n \nWhile reliable transport infrastructure is a prerequisite for poverty reduction and economic \n7. \ngrowth, the broader issue of social access is of fundamental importance. Roads have stimulated \neconomic growth and high levels of social well-being in the areas served, but can also contribute \nto polarization between different areas and communities\u2014a factor in the conflict in Nepal. The lack \nof education, depth of poverty, high degree of social exclusion of many groups, and vulnerability of \nmost  subsistence  livelihoods  all  point  to  the  need  for  interventions  much  broader  than  the \nconstruction of roads, bridges, and trails alone. Previous road projects have not always enabled \nmany  disadvantaged  groups  to  benefit  from  the  opportunities  and  services  that  the  roads  were \nassumed to generate or deliver.  \n \n\n2\n\n  \n\n \n\n\f3  \n\nSectoral  programs  have  sought  to  expand  the  delivery  of  services  to  rural  areas  rather \n8. \nthan  concentrate  solely  on  building  infrastructure.  The  strategy  of  providing  roads  has  benefited \nrural people but not adequately raised living standards. Building on lessons learned (Appendix 1), \na different strategy is clearly required if significant poverty reduction is to be achieved in remote \nareas  affected  by  the  conflict.  Lessons  learned  show  that  substantial  infrastructure  investments, \ncombined with community development and livelihood enhancement, are required to improve rural \nincomes and welfare. A specific effort must be made to provide the poorest groups with income-\nearning opportunities. This can be achieved by hiring the poor as unskilled labor to construct roads \nthrough hilly terrain. Methods of mobilizing and managing building groups (BGs) formed by poor \nhouseholds have been developed and tested by a number of projects, including, on a pilot basis, \nADB\u2019s Rural Infrastructure Development Project.4 This approach provides immediate cash income \nbut, perhaps more important, boosts social capital of the most disadvantaged in rural society. The \napproach  also  provides  a  point  of  entry  for  broad  social  development  interventions  to  promote \nother  livelihood  improvements  in  conflict  areas.  When  coupled  with  enhanced  physical  access, \nthis integrated approach leads to a significant positive impact on the rural poor\u2019s living standard.  \n \nImplementing  development  projects  in  conflict  areas  is  difficult  and  subject  to  rapidly \n9. \nchanging conditions that are location specific. However, short- and medium-term interventions to \naddress the immediate consequences of the conflict, such as disruption of livelihoods and damage \nto  infrastructure,  are  urgently  needed.  Recent  experience  in  ADB's  Rural  Infrastructure \nDevelopment  Project,  and  other  development  partners'  rural  infrastructure  projects  in  Nepal \ndemonstrate that the insurgents continue to accept the presence of development programs in all \nareas  that  they  control.  However,  project  interventions  such  as  rehabilitation  of  essential \ninfrastructure,  and  restoration  of  livelihoods  and  essential  services  must  be  undertaken  in  an \ninclusive manner that promotes economic and social equality. The activities must be implemented \nin  a  participatory  and  transparent  manner,  use  traditional  methods  of  social  cooperation, \nincorporate  conflict  sensitivity,  involve  the  cooperation  of  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs) \nand community groups, and provide jobs to local people, particularly through affirmative action to \novercome  economic  and  social  inequalities  and  discrimination  (para.  55).  The  Tenth  Five-Year \nPlan and ADB's new Country Strategy and Program focus on addressing causes of the conflict, \nand support the integrated approach to rural development described in para. 8. \n \nPlanning  and  decision  making  are  being  devolved  to  the  district  level  to  improve  local \n10. \ngovernance,  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  decentralization  policy.  The  Local  Self-\nGovernance Act (1999) and its supporting regulations provide the framework for a decentralized \napproach  and  a  greater  degree  of  autonomy  for  DDCs  and  VDCs.  The  Government  is  now \nimplementing  the  act  and  has  devolved  the  responsibility  for  rural  road  construction  and \nmaintenance  to  the  districts.  A  measurable  outcome  of  the  devolution  of  authority  is  the \nwidespread  adoption  of  DTMPs,  which  have  introduced  a  systematic  process  of  inclusive \nparticipatory  planning  for  rural  infrastructure.  The  technical  aspects  of  local  development  have \nbeen strengthened through the establishment of district technical offices (DTOs) under the control \nof  the  DDC  rather  than  a  central  ministry.  Ownership  and  management  of  local  infrastructure \ndevelopment is vested in the DDCs and VDCs, with guidance from DOLIDAR, all of which have \nresource constraints and require capacity building.  \n \n11. \nThe  Project,  which  the  Government  considers  a  flagship  project  for  development  under \nconflict conditions, supports the poverty reduction objectives and development policies of ADB and \nthe  Government,  including  the  need  to  address  the  underlying  causes  of  the  conflict.  The \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB.  1996.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nKingdom of Nepal for the Rural Infrastructure Development Project. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f4\n\n  \n\n \n\nProject also addresses two key causes of slow agricultural growth and limited rural jobs, including \n(i)  lack  of  an  effective  and  properly  maintained  rural  transportation  network;  and  (ii)  weak \ninstitutions,  constrained  government  service  delivery,  and  lack  of  beneficiary  participation.  The \nproject design is consistent with and applies the ADB country and sector strategies for Nepal. The \nproject  design  incorporates  at  the  project  level  ADB  policies  on  public-private  partnership, \nanticorruption,  and  good  governance.  The  intent  of  national  plans,  views  of  poor  and  conflict-\naffected  communities,  sector  analysis  (Appendix  1),  and  ADB  country  program  strategy  all \nrecognize  the  need  for  additional  support  in  remote  conflict-affected  districts  through  a  poverty \nreduction  project  focusing  on  livelihood  restoration  and  infrastructure.  The  project  design  meets \nthe needs of the poor, effectively improves access to services and markets, creates jobs, provides \ncash  income  to  the  poorest  households,  and  increases  the  national  network  of  basic  rural \ninfrastructure.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nObjective \n\nA. \n \n12. \nThe project goal is to reduce rural poverty in 18 very poor remote hill and mountain districts \naffected by the conflict. The purpose is to achieve sustainable increased access to economic and \nsocial  services,  and  enhance  the  social  and  financial  capital  for  people  in  the  project  area, \nparticularly  the  poor  and  disadvantaged  in  conflict  areas.  The  Project  will  invest  in  small, \ncommunity  socioeconomic  infrastructure;  and  provide  jobs,  empower  rural  communities  for \ndevelopment,  increase  institutional  capacity,  and  improve  accountability  and  transparency.  The \nProject will also extend the network of improved rural transport infrastructure, consisting of roads, \ntrails,  and  pedestrian  bridges.  The  Project  will  improve  the  livelihoods  of  people  in  the  project \nareas,  particularly  the  poor,  who  constitute  about  70%  of  the  subproject  area  population.  The \nProject will be in 18 hill and mountain districts throughout Nepal.5 The districts were selected on \nthe basis of their high incidence and intensity of poverty, need for restoration of incomes affected \nby  the  conflict,  need  for  improved  access  and  enhanced  livelihoods,  and  how  manageable \nimplementation will be. The project framework is in Appendix 3. The project concept and approach \nare in Appendix 4.  \n\n1. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nB. \n \n13. \nThe  Project  comprises  (i)  community  development  and  rural  livelihood  restoration,  (ii) \ncapacity building and decentralized governance, (iii) rural transport infrastructure, and (iv) project \nmanagement services. \n \n \n \n14. \nThe  output  of  this  component  is  intended  to  restore  incomes  and  the  livelihoods  of  rural \npeople,  particularly  the  poor,  in  the  subproject  areas.  The  component  addresses  the  need  for \neffective  beneficiary  participation  in  planning,  implementation,  monitoring,  and  maintenance  that \nare essential to achieve a poverty-targeted impact from the rural infrastructure investments. The \ncomponent, with the support of local NGOs will lead to increased social and financial capital in the \nsubproject  areas  by  (i)  embedding  the  practice  of  participation  in  rural  communities;  (ii)  instilling \nchanges in cultural attitudes that inhibit development; increasing the social inclusion of excluded \n\nCommunity Development and Rural Livelihood Restoration \n\n                                                 \n5 The Far Western districts are Baitadi, Bajhang, Bajura, and Darchula; the Midwestern region districts are Dolpa, Humla, \nJajarkot, Jumla, Kalikot, and Mugu; the Western region districts are Baglung, Gorkha, Lamjung, and Myagdi; and the \nCentral and Eastern region districts are Okhaldhunga, Ramechhap, Solukhumbu, and Taplejung.   \n\n\f5  \n\nCommunity  Development.  Community  development  activities  will  strengthen \n\nand vulnerable groups; and empowering the poor and disadvantaged, including women; and (iii) \nfacilitating  and  supporting  the  initiation  and  operation  of  other  development  activities  in  the \ncommunities through supplementary investments. The Project will implement a social mobilization \nprogram  in  each  district,  delivered  through  local  NGOs\u2014an  approach  that  has  been  working  in \nconflict-affected districts. The component has three aspects: community development, job creation \nand access to development opportunities, and supplementary investments. \n \n15. \nthe \ncapacities  of  communities,  and  develop  the  practice  of  beneficiary  participation,  ensure  the \ninvolvement  and  targeting  of  the  poorest  and  most  disadvantaged  groups,  and  promote  social \ncohesion. These goals will be achieved by support activities that (i) raise awareness of the Project \nand  the  opportunities  it  offers  among  all  social  groups  in  the  target  area;  (ii)  help  communities \npropose possible local infrastructure subprojects; (iii) include social surveys as part of subproject \nfeasibility  studies  to  identify  the  key  target  groups  for  project  support;  (iv)  facilitate  beneficiary \nparticipation  and  community  auditing  of  implementation  through  a  pro-poor  delivery  mechanism; \nand (v) identify, prioritize, implement, and maintain supplementary investments.  \n \n16. \nJob  Creation  and  Access  to  Development  Opportunities.  Unskilled  jobs  on  the  main \nsubproject  construction  works  will  be  reserved  for  people  living  in  the  infrastructure\u2019s  influence \narea.  The  first  priority  for  employment  will  be  the  poor  and  disadvantaged  groups  and  castes, \nfollowed by households affected by conflict, and the acquisition of land and other assets. Workers \nwill be paid in full, promptly, and fortnightly. Building on the participatory activities carried out for \ncommunity  development,  the  social  mobilization  program  will  (i)  identify  poor  households  of  all \ncastes and disadvantaged groups; (ii) encourage these groups, particularly women, to take jobs \non  project  works;  (iii)  support  the  formation  of  BGs  of  15-25  persons;  and  (iv)  train  the  BG  in \nconstruction and life skills, and group leaders in bookkeeping and leadership skills. Women will be \nallocated at least 40% of the unskilled labor where sufficient demand exists, with women-only BGs \nformed,  and  women  encouraged  to  become  group  leaders.  BG  members  will  be  expected  to \nconvert  the  BG  into  a  savings  group,  to  ensure  that  a  proportion  of  construction  wages  are \nretained  to  help  pay  off  household  debts  and  invest  in  small-scale  income-generation  activities. \nThe BGs will also receive useful life-skill training. This process provides a mechanism to translate \nthe short-term benefits from employment on project works into longer-term impacts on livelihoods \nthrough provision of life skills and capital formation (paras. 8 and 24; Appendix 10, para. 13; and \nAppendix 11, para. 3). \n \n17. \ninfrastructure \nsubprojects  will  all  be  accompanied  by  supplementary  investments  to  build  or  rehabilitate \ncommunity-level infrastructure in villages within subproject areas. The supplementary investments\u2019 \ncost will be 15-20% of the main subproject\u2019s cost. Eligible supplementary investments must show \na  clear  access  benefit  related  to  the  main  subproject,  and  may  include  improvement  of  village \ntrails and building of pedestrian bridges; construction of new, and rehabilitation of existing, drinking \nwater  schemes;  rehabilitation  of  small  irrigation  schemes;  construction  of  micro-hydropower \nschemes;  construction  of  a  market  or  community  building;  and  construction  of  new,  or \nrehabilitation  and  improvement  of  existing,  health  facilities  and  primary-school  buildings.  These \nsupplementary investments will be identified and proposed by the beneficiary communities through \na participatory process that involves the poorest and most socially excluded groups, facilitated by \nNGO  social  mobilizers.  The  beneficiary  communities  will  be  required  to  contribute  15%  of  the \ninvestment cost in the form of voluntary labor and local materials, an arrangement that enhances \ncommunity ownership of the investment. Duplication of activities of other development projects will \nbe avoided while synergies are developed. \n \n\nInvestments  to  Restore  Rural  Livelihoods.  The \n\nSupplementary \n\n \n\n\f6\n\n  \n\n \n\n2. \n\nCapacity Building and Decentralized Governance \n\n \n \n \n18. \nThis  component  will  provide  district  and  national  capacity  building  to  promote  improved \ndecentralized  governance.  The  component  outputs  will  (i)  establish  the  capacity  for  sustainable \nmanagement  of  planned  maintenance  of  rural  road  networks,  without  which  the  benefits  from \ninfrastructure investment will be short-lived; (ii) strengthen the decentralized management of rural \ninfrastructure  development,  implementation,  and  monitoring,  and  improve  local  governance \n(including  public  audits),  to  help  reduce  poverty;  and  (iii)  increase  central  capacity  to  provide \nnational direction, guidance, support, and monitoring to local government bodies. The outputs will \ncontribute to long-term impacts on poverty reduction and improve rural livelihoods.  \n \nCreating  the  capacity  for  and  establishing  sustainable  planning,  construction, monitoring, \n19. \nand  maintenance  of  rural  road  networks  by  communities,  VDCs,  and  DDCs  are  central  to  the \nproject design. The Project will provide a variety of training courses to strengthen local rural road \nplanning, construction, and maintenance management capacity, and a movement to sustainable \nfinancing.  Each  district  will  be  required  to  set  up  a  district  road  maintenance  fund  with  limited \nfinancial  support  from  loan  funds  before  construction  works  start  on  the  first  subprojects.  This \ncritical  initiative  will  be  supported  by  intensive  district  capacity-building  activities  for  subproject \nselection, survey, design, site supervision, and maintenance. Skills will also be provided to VDC, \nDTO,  and  DDC  staff  in  accounting,  financial  management,  and  environmental  evaluation.  A  key \nproject output is to create district capacity to contract out services to the private and NGO sectors. \n \n20. \nSimilarly,  at  the  national  level  the  Project  will  reinforce  the  technical  and  management \ncapacities of DOLIDAR by providing TA, transport and office equipment, training, and resources to \ndraw  upon  specialized  services  from  domestic  consultants  and  national  NGOs.  The  Project  will \nalso develop DOLIDAR\u2019s capability to manage increased contracting-out of services to the private \nand NGO sectors as the most effective strategy to strengthen DOLIDAR\u2019s capacity as a modern \npublic  sector  institution.  An  institutional  development  TA  that  supports  broad,  sector-wide \nimprovements  in  DOLIDAR\u2019s  activities  will  supplement  TA  provided  under  the  loan.  Improved \naccountability  and  transparency  are  intended  to  be  among  the  district  and  central  outcomes \n(paras. 44-45). \n      \n \n \n21. \nThe outputs of this component will be (i) construction of new, and rehabilitation of existing, \ndistrict  roads  and  village  roads,6  including  provision  of  small  cross-drainage  structures  and  all \nprotection structures; (ii) rehabilitation and upgrading of existing main trails; and (iii) construction of \nnew  trail  bridges  on  existing  main  trails.  These  outputs  will  be  augmented  by  supplementary \ninvestments  in  minor  village  and  community  infrastructure  within  the  influence  area  of  the  main \nsubprojects (para. 17).  \n \n22. \nInfrastructure will be built through a series of subprojects. Each participating district will be \nallocated a proportion of the project investment funds (about $0.8 million in the first phase of the \nProject),  and  the  subprojects  will  be  selected  and  approved  in  four  stages:  identification, \nprioritization, feasibility study, and approval by DDCs. Underpinned by the initial social mobilization \nand capacity-building activities, the targeted communities in VDC areas and other stakeholders in \neach  district  will  participate  in  identifying  possible  subprojects  following  dissemination  of \n\nRural Transport Infrastructure \n\n3. \n\n                                                 \n6  A  district  road  connects  one  or  more  major  growth  centers  or  villages  with  the  district  headquarters  or  the  SRN.  A   \n\nvillage road connects a VDC center with another VDC, the SRN, a district road, or a major growth center. \n\n\f7  \n\ninformation on eligibility and prioritization criteria (para. 34). Identified possible subprojects will be \nreviewed at the district level to confirm their eligibility and assess their priority in terms of (i) the \noverall  justification,  and  (ii)  specific  cost-effectiveness  criteria  that  compare  the  number  of \nbeneficiaries and of poor beneficiaries with the indicative cost and the change in level of access \nthat will result. Subprojects will be built to DOLIDAR standards using labor-based, environmentally \nfriendly, and participatory (LEP) techniques. This entails maximum use of unskilled local laborers, \nsupplemented  with  skilled  craftsmen  employed  by  the  Project  as  necessary.  For  more  complex \nstructures, small contractors may be required to provide adequate skills, but would be regulated by \nclauses  requiring  most  of  the  workforce  to  be  local.  Road  designs  will  be  based  on  surveyed \nlongitudinal  alignments  and  cross-sections  rather  than  the  traditional  but  costly  office-based  full \ndesign. While this approach maximizes direct benefits to the rural poor in project areas, it requires \na  high  level  of  site  supervision  to  ensure  quality  of  work,  incorporation  of  safety  standards  into \nroad  designs,  and  sustainability  of  infrastructure  built.  Project  implementation  arrangements \nprovide for this. \n \n\n4. \n\nProject Management Services \n\n \n\nSpecial Features \n\n23. \nA  project  coordination  unit  (PCU)  has  been  established  in  Kathmandu  and  staffed  by \nDOLIDAR, and will be assisted by consultants (para. 31). The DDCs will be responsible for project \nimplementation in the project districts. The DDCs will delegate implementation tasks to the DTOs, \nand the Project will support a district project office (DPO), which will include DTO staff, domestic \nconsultants,  and  local  NGO  staff.  The  DDC  will  ensure  that  a  full-time  engineer,  sufficient \noverseers, and accountant staff the DTOs.  \n \nC. \n \n24. \nThe  project  components  are  primarily  focused  on  poverty  reduction  and  livelihood \nrestoration  in  conflict-affected  districts  rather  than  infrastructure  development  alone.  The \ncomponents are integrated, with the infrastructure built using appropriate, labor-based methods as \nthe entry point for rural livelihood-enhancement interventions. Numerous small BGs, formed locally \nfrom the poorest people of the community, will undertake construction work. These BGs form the \ninitial basis of project efforts to boost human and social capital. Disadvantaged castes and ethnic \nminorities are predominantly found in the poorest  groups and will be specifically targeted by the \nProject for BG membership and life-skill training. Poor women from these groups will be directly \ntargeted  to  join  BGs  and  will  receive  full  training  and  a  support  program  aimed  at  the  multiple \ndimensions of poverty. This program will help reduce poverty by addressing the many influences \non  livelihoods  and  poverty,  and  offer  immediate  income-earning  opportunities.  The  community \ndevelopment  component  will  enable  these  groups  to  participate  fully  in  community  decision \nmaking. All of these activities will seek to mitigate the adverse impacts of the conflict and its root \ncauses. \n \n25. \nThe  Project\u2019s  emphasis  on  participation  includes  active  community  involvement  in \nplanning  supplementary  investments  to  enhance  rural  livelihoods  and  restore  incomes  in \nconnection  with  access  improvements  provided  by  road  and  trail  infrastructure.  Much  of  the \ninvestment is, therefore, process based rather than prescriptive, and as a result project planning \nhas  only  provided  indicative  guidelines  for  the  kinds  and  scales  of  investment  that  will  be \ndetermined during implementation. In a wider process that underpins support for construction of \nphysical infrastructure, social mobilizers will ensure that all local people gain access and livelihood \nbenefits from the project activities. \n \n\n \n\n\f8\n\n  \n\n \n\nAnother  special  project  feature  is  the  high  level  of  integration  with  similar  projects \n26. \nsupported  by  other  funding  agencies,  to  ensure  that  DTOs  can  administer  their  responsibilities. \nThe  Project  will  collaborate  closely  with  other  sectoral  initiatives  and  share  technical  support \ncapacity  on  a  district-by-district  basis.  This  will  help  enhance  decentralized  governance  by \npromoting  localized  implementation  without  overloading  developing  institutions,  and  harmonize \nrural infrastructure interventions in conflict-affected districts.7 \n \n27. \nThe  Project  also  accords  with  the  Government\u2019s  emerging  strategy  for  rural  road \nmaintenance,  including  establishment  of  district  road  maintenance  funds,  required  to  provide \nmatching  funds  to  access  money  from  the  central  road fund (para. 39). Linked to DTO capacity \nbuilding, the road funds will for the first time allow a reasonable level of structured maintenance \nmanagement on rural roads, thereby making the investment fully sustainable. \n \nD. \n \n28. \nThe  estimated  project  cost  is  $62.3  million  equivalent,  inclusive  of  physical  and  price \ncontingencies, taxes and duties, and interest and service charges during construction. The foreign \nexchange cost is estimated at $5.3 million, or about 8.5% of the total cost. The local currency cost \nis estimated at $57.0 million equivalent, or about 91.5% of the total cost. The local currency costs \ninclude an estimated $1.3 million equivalent for taxes and duties to be paid by the Government. \nThe  project  cost  estimate  (Table  1)  should  be  regarded  as  indicative  only.  The  detailed  project \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 5. \n\nCost Estimates  \n\n                                                 \n7 The Project will also coordinate closely and avoid duplication with other ADB projects operating in the same districts, \nparticularly the Community-Based Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project, and the proposed gender equality and \nempowerment of women project.    \n\n\f9  \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million)a \n  \n\n \nItem \nA.

The loan will fund $5.3 million (100% of the total foreign \nexchange  cost),  and  $34.7  million  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost  (61%  of  the  total  local \ncurrency cost). The Government has been requested to provide $14.7 million equivalent, or 24% \nof  the  project  cost.  The  Government  of  Switzerland  has  been  requested  to  provide  parallel  and \ntied  grant  cofinancing  through  SDC for financial cooperation of $1.9 million equivalent, or 3% of \nthe project cost to support community development and TA in three districts8 in the Central and \nEastern regions. The purpose is to expand the support through the ongoing District Road Support \nProgram  (DRSP)  to  include  the  Project\u2019s  community  development  and  TA  requirements  in  the \nthree districts. The Government of Germany has been requested to provide parallel and tied grant \ncofinancing through GTZ for financial cooperation of $0.7 million equivalent, or 1% of the project \ncost to support community development and TA in Darchula in the Far Western region, to expand \nthe ongoing support through the World Food Programme\u2019s Rural Community Infrastructure Works \nProject to include the Project\u2019s community development and TA requirements in Darchula. DDCs \nwill contribute $4.2 million equivalent or 7% of the project cost by contributing 10% of the cash cost \nfor  rural  transport  infrastructure,  and  33%  for  its  maintenance.  Households  that  benefit  from \nsupplementary  livelihood-enhancement  investments  will  contribute  $0.8  million  or  1%  of  the \n\n                                                 \n8 Okhaldhunga, Ramechhap,  and Solukhumbu districts.   \n\n \n\n\fproject cost through the households\u2019 labor inputs in constructing the supplementary investments \n(15% of the cost of the supplementary infrastructure).  \n  \n30. \nIf necessary, ADB and the Government will continue to collaborate with, and possibly seek \ncofinancing  from,  various  development  partners.  If  additional  funds  become  available  during \nprocessing  or  implementation,  the  scope  of  infrastructure  funded  from  the  loan  will  be \ncorrespondingly increased. Local cost financing is justified given the poverty-oriented nature of the \nProject, and the country\u2019s tight fiscal situation. The Borrower will be the Government of Nepal. The \nADB loan will have a maturity of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years. The loan will carry \nan  interest  charge  of  1.0%  during  the  grace  period  and  an  interest  charge  of  1.5%  per  annum \nduring amortization.

The  technical  and  project  management  skills  of \nDOLIDAR have developed substantially since its formation, through support from ADB and other \ndevelopment  partners,  and  through  its  experience  of  managing  a  number  of  rural  infrastructure \nprojects.  DOLIDAR  has  established  a  PCU  in  Kathmandu.  The  PCU  will  guide  and  monitor  the \nDDCs  in  implementing  project  components.  It  will  manage  overall  project  planning,  and  fund \nallocation  and  disbursement.  The  existing  DRSP  central  project implementation consultant team \nwill  be  part  of  the  PCU,  advise  DOLIDAR  on  project  management,  and  provide  much  of  the \ncapacity development assistance to the districts. The PCU use of the existing DRSP management \nstructure will lead to substantial resource savings, since the Project will require only incremental \nconsultants.  The  PCU  will  liaise  with  the  coordination  unit  of  the  GTZ-Rural  Community \nInfrastructure Works Project that has technical responsibility for support in Darchula.  \n \n32.  Ministry of Local Development (MLD) has reconstituted existing steering committees to form \na  joint  project  steering  committee  for  all  development  partners\u2019  rural  transport  projects,  in  an \nintegrated sector-wide approach. The steering committee will meet as necessary, but not less than \n\n10\n\n  \n\n \nF. \n\n \n\n\f11  \n\ntwice a year, to review progress, resolve policy issues, and guide DOLIDAR. The MLD secretary \nwill chair the committee. A project implementation coordination committee will be chaired by the \ndirector general of DOLIDAR and include representatives of all other rural infrastructure projects \nworking  in  the  project  districts,  and  of  any  cofinanciers.  Representatives  of  other  stakeholder \norganizations9 will be co-opted as necessary. The committee will meet at least every 6 months. Its \nresponsibility  will  be  to  address  and  resolve  implementation  issues,  and  to  advise  the  PCU  on \ntechnical matters, and the project steering committee on policy matters.  \n \nAt  the  district  level,  project  implementation  will  be  the  responsibility  of  DPOs  within  the \n33. \nDTO  of  each  DDC.  The  DPO  will  prepare  annual  work  programs  based  on  the  agreed-on \nsubprojects,  and  ensure  that  land  acquisition  and  environmental  procedures  are  completed  on \ntime  before  construction.  Road  subprojects  will  be  planned  and  overseen  by  the  district  road \ncoordination  committee,  which  is  effectively  a  DDC  subcommittee.  The  DPO  will  arrange  the \nprocurement of appropriate services and community-level training, and will supervise and monitor \nworks implementation. Village works and road construction committees will form the BGs in each \nVDC  area  and  monitor  implementation.  The  DPO  will  also  coordinate  (i)  application  for,  and \nselection  of,  possible  supplementary  investments  in  the  VDC  areas  in  subproject  areas;  and  (ii) \nimplementation  through  local  NGOs  of  livelihood-enhancement  activities  using  intensive  social \nmobilization.  A  domestic  engineering  consultant  to  cover  technical  issues,  and  a  local  NGO  to \nundertake social mobilization and assist BGs will be engaged by, and support, the DPO.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSubproject Implementation \n\n \n34. \nProject implementation will start with a preconstruction phase of more than 1 year, during \nwhich essential preparatory activities will be carried out. During this time, DDCs will select possible \nfirst-phase  subprojects  following  agreed-on  eligibility  criteria  such  as  size,  improved  access  and \nlivelihoods, connectivity from existing passable rural transport infrastructure network, and priority \nas defined by the DTMP. Subprojects are envisaged to consist mostly of sections of rural district \nroads, to be built or upgraded by local unskilled workers to environmentally sound standards and \nto  provide  a  high-priority  access  link.  The  PCU  will  approve  all  subprojects  and  seek  ADB\u2019s \nconcurrence. While participating DDCs will need to satisfy certain conditions to qualify for an initial \nsubproject,  funds  for  second-phase  subprojects  will  be  allocated  on  a  performance  basis.  To \nqualify for funding for a second-phase subproject, DDCs must have implemented the first-phase \nsubproject,  demonstrated  a  commitment  to  reduce  poverty,  and  established  and  successfully \noperated a district road maintenance fund.  \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n35. \nThe Project will be implemented over 6 years and 8 months. Implementation is expected \nto begin in the first quarter of 2005. Initial activities will include filling any vacant PCU positions, \nrecruiting  consultants,  selecting  local  NGOs,  beginning  social  mobilization  in  the  districts, \nestablishing a project performance monitoring system in DOLIDAR, beginning to plan the outline \ndesign  of  subprojects  to  be  implemented  in  2005,  completing  a  benchmark  survey,  and \nprocuring essential equipment. Physical works may not start before the third quarter of 2005 to \nallow  time  to  complete  social  mobilization,  select  subprojects,  complete  surveys,  and  prepare \ndetailed engineering designs and environmental and resettlement studies. The loan-use period \nwill  terminate  on  29  February  2012.  The  Government  will  not  begin  any  ADB-financed  civil-\nworks  construction  until  after  the  implementation  consultants  have  been  appointed;  land  and \nrights to land, free of encumbrances, are available for construction; and resettlement activities \n\n                                                 \n9 For example, the Association of DDCs, and Association of VDCs. \n\n \n\n\fand  compensation  payments  have  been  completed.  A  project  implementation  schedule  is  in \nAppendix 6. \n \n\nProcurement \n\n4. \n \n36. \nGoods,  related  services,  and  civil  works  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  following \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  All  civil  works  will  be  small  and  widely  dispersed,  with  an \naverage  value  of  $10,000\u2013$15,000  equivalent,  and  most  will  be  undertaken  by  unskilled \ncommunity  labor,  following  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  on  community  participation  in  procurement.  In \nisolated  instances,  small  civil-works  contracts  may  be  required,  which  will  be  procured  by  the \nDPO  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive  bidding  among  contractors  in  accordance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  procurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Prequalification,  selection,  and \nengagement of contractors will be subject to ADB\u2019s approval. Supply contracts for equipment or \nmaterials are not expected to cost $500,000 or more, but should a contract be required it will be \nawarded  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding.  Those  costing  less  than  the \nequivalent  of  $500,000  (other  than  minor  items)  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international \nshopping.  Direct  purchase  will  be  used  for  small  or  off-the-shelf  items  valued  at  less  than \n$100,000. The PCU and DTOs will procure the equipment and vehicles. Indicative procurement \npackages are in Appendix 7. \n \n\nConsulting Services \n\n5. \n \n\n37.  The  PCU  will  select  the  central  implementation  support  consultants.  Other  required \nconsulting services in the districts will be engaged by the DPOs in accordance with Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  by  ADB  and  its  Borrowers  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to \nADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  Quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedures  will  be \nused to recruit the consultants, using full technical proposals. An international firm in association \nwith domestic firms will provide services totaling 515 consultant person-months, consisting of 90 \nperson-months  of  international  and  425  person-months  of  domestic  consultants.  ADB  has \napproved  advance  action  to  begin  recruiting  implementation  consultants  from  the  appraisal \nmission  date  to  the  ADB  loan  effectiveness  date  to  facilitate  the  start-up  of  project \nimplementation.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  approval  of  advance  action  does  not \ncommit ADB to finance the project. The summary terms of reference for the consultants are in \nAppendix  8.  Grant  cofinancing  is  being  sought  for  the  Project.  Should  grant  cofinancing  be \nsecured, the grant will finance project TA elements. \n\n6. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n \n38. \nLand  acquisition  problems  can  be  a  major  source  of  delays  in  implementing \ndevelopment  projects.  Consequently,  land  acquisition  requirements  under  the  Project  will  be \nminimized.  To  curtail  implementation  delays  due  to  land  acquisition,  project  infrastructure \nlocation will be carefully determined. A subproject agreement will be signed by each DDC with \nthe Project. Compensation determination committees will also be convened in each district, and \nvillage works and roads construction committees will ensure that all project-affected people are \nfairly  compensated.  The  DPO,  in  cooperation  with  the  committees,  will  complete  the  preparatory \nwork  for  land  acquisition  before  submitting  subproject  appraisal  reports.  Land  acquisition  will  be \ncompleted within 365 days from the signing of the subproject agreement; otherwise, the subproject \nwill  be  removed  from  the  Project.  Should  a  subproject  require  any  involuntary  resettlement,  the \nsubproject  appraisal  report  will  include  a  short  or  full  resettlement  plan,  in  accordance  with \nframework.  All \nADB\u2019s  guidelines, \n\nresettlement  policy,  and  project \n\nresettlement \n\n12\n\n  \n\n \n\n\f13  \n\ncompensation  and  resettlement  activities  will  be  completed  before  possession  of  land  and \nother assets. The DPO will publicly disclose the resettlement plans in each subproject area after \nsubproject appraisal.  \n\n \n7. \n\nMaintenance \n\n \n39. \nDDCs  are  responsible  for  maintenance,  including  financing,  of  district  roads,  and  main \ntrails  and  their  bridges;  while  VDCs  are  responsible  for  smaller-scale  infrastructure  such  as \nsupplementary infrastructure. Their resources, skills, and maintenance management systems are \nweak. The Project will encourage DDCs to take on their maintenance responsibilities by providing \ninitial  financing  for  district  road  maintenance  funds,  on  a  matching-fund  basis,  and  subject  to \nDDCs  establishing  a  district  rural  road  maintenance  fund,  and  subsequently  adequately \nmaintaining  existing  roads  (para.  57  [x];  and  Appendix  1,  para.  5).  This  will  contribute  to  the \nfinancing  of  maintenance  works  during  the  project  period,  when  management  capacity,  and \nplanning  and  implementation  procedures  are  being  developed  and  tested  with  support  from \nconsultants.  The  Project  will  encourage  the  formation  and  operation  of  user  committees \nrepresenting transport operators and other regular road users. These committees can be valuable \nin representing beneficiary interests, restricting heavy-vehicle use, monitoring road conditions and \nmaintenance  performance,  and  mobilizing  resources  for  essential  maintenance.  At  the  central \nlevel,  the  proposed  institutional  development  TA  (paras.  44-45,  and  Appendix  9)  will  help \nDOLIDAR establish effective planned rural road maintenance practices. The Government\u2019s newly \nestablished Road Board and its associated fund will also bolster the supply of maintenance funds. \nThe  board  is  required  to  allocate  30%  of  its  annual  funds  for  rural  road  maintenance  by  local \nbodies.  \n \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n8. \n \n40. \nThe few civil works contracts to be awarded will generally be small in value. To ensure \neffective  project  implementation  and  timely  disbursement,  the  Government  will  establish  a \nproject  account  at  the  Nepal  Rastra  Bank.  Project  funding  (other  than  DDC  and  beneficiary \ncounterpart funds) comprising counterpart funds provided by the Government, and ADB funds \nwill  be  channeled  to  pay  all costs of the Project (other than those funded by local counterpart \nfunds)  through  the  following  routes:  (i)  to  the  district  development  fund  and  then  into  each \nDDC\u2019s  project  operating  account,  and  (ii)  into  the  PCU  project  operating  account.  From  each \nDDC\u2019s  project  operating  account,  the  funds  will  be  used  to  pay  for  infrastructure  investments \nand  their  maintenance,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs,  NGOs  and  local  consultants, \nand  district  office  equipment  and  vehicles  and  their  operating  costs.  The  PCU  will  prepare \ndisbursement  projections,  request  budgetary  allocations  for  central  counterpart  funds,  collect \nsupporting  documents,  and  prepare  withdrawal  applications  and  send  them  to  ADB  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. ADB project funding will periodically be \ndisbursed from the ADB loan account into a subaccount of the project account. The subaccount \nwill operate as an imprest account for the ADB project funding. Payments for eligible items will \nbe made through this account. The statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure will be adopted \nto facilitate reimbursement and liquidation of small contracts. The imprest account and the SOE \nprocedure  will  be  established,  maintained,  and  audited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook. The ceiling of the imprest account will not exceed the estimated ADB-\nfinanced  expenditures  for  the  next  6  months,  or  $1  million,  whichever  is  lower.  The  SOE \nprocedure  is  applicable  for  reimbursing  eligible  expenditures  for  any  individual  payment  not \nexceeding $50,000 equivalent and liquidating advances provided for in the imprest account. \n \n\n \n\n\fAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n9. \n \n41. \nDOLIDAR  will  submit  to  ADB  trimester  and  annual  progress  reports  on  project \nimplementation. The PCU will prepare the reports, particularly addressing progress in meeting \nproject  targets.  The  reports  will  include  information  on  the Project\u2019s physical progress and the \nproject  components\u2019  status.  Within  3  months  of  the  Project\u2019s  substantial  physical  completion, \nDOLIDAR will submit to ADB a project completion report covering project implementation, cost, \nproject performance management activities, and other information requested by ADB. DOLIDAR \nwill  maintain separate project accounts and records to facilitate identification of project-related \nincome  and  expenditures.  The  PCU  will  be  assigned  sufficient  and  qualified  accounting  staff, \nincluding an accounts officer. An auditor acceptable to ADB will annually audit all project-related \naccounts,  SOEs,  and  revenues.  The  Auditor  General\u2019s  Office  of  Nepal  is  acceptable  for  this \npurpose. The annual audit will cover the imprest account and SOE procedure. The annual audit \nreport  will  include  a  separate  audit  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  SOE \nprocedure.  Audited  financial  statements  and  project  accounts,  together  with  the  report  of  the \nauditor, will be submitted within 9 months of the close of the financial year. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n42. \nThe  PCU  will  use  a  participatory  and  gender-sensitive  project  performance  monitoring \nprogram  to  ensure  that  project  activities  and  facilities  are  managed  efficiently  and  that  target \ngroups receive the intended benefits, modeled on ADB\u2019s monitoring system. Monitoring activities \nwill  assess  whether  the  project  inputs  and  activities  have  delivered  the  expected  outputs  and \nbenefits  to  the  intended  beneficiaries.  Monitoring  will  cover  capacity  building,  planning, \nresettlement  issues,  and  distribution  of  project  benefits  and  evaluation  of  project  impacts.  \nMonitoring will safeguard vulnerable beneficiaries at the community level ensuring that subprojects \nare not distorted and benefits diverted by village and district elites. The monitoring system will also \nbe used to detect at an early stage any discrepancy between the project plan and its execution. \nParticipatory  beneficiary  monitoring  and  public  audits  will  promote  effective  implementation.  The \nPCU will ensure that any required district-level baseline physical and socioeconomic surveys are \nconducted,  and  will  submit  a  detailed  implementation  plan  for  monitoring  performance  and \npreparing gender-disaggregated benchmark information for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence within \n6 months of loan effectiveness. Thereafter, the PCU will submit annual benefit monitoring reports \nto ADB throughout the implementation period. A detailed study will review project progress before \nthe  ADB  midterm  review.  DOLIDAR  will  complete  an  impact  evaluation  study  before  the  PCU \nprepares the project completion report. \n \n\nProject Review \n\n11. \n \n43. \nADB will review the Project at least twice a year, supplemented by a midterm review to \nbe carried out by the Government and ADB in mid-2007. The regular project reviews will cover \nthe  performance  of  DOLIDAR,  PCU,  DDCs,  DTOs,  and  NGOs;  implementation  of  the  loan \ncovenants and gender action plan; physical progress of project implementation; representation \nof the poor and excluded groups in project implementation; and capacity-building activities. The \nmidterm  review  will  allow  the  Government  and  ADB  to  monitor  the  Project  and  to  adjust  the \nproject design and implementation arrangements, if necessary. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n14\n\n  \n\n \n\n\f15  \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n44. \nA  small  institutional  development  TA  will  be  extremely  valuable  in  supporting  capacity \nbuilding in DOLIDAR in a number of key complementary areas, but with a sector perspective. The \nTA  will  also  continue  to  develop  national  policies  and  strategies  that  previous  ADB  TA  has \nsupported,10  and  in  particular  to  further  decentralization.  The  TA  will  promote  the  draft  national \npolicy and strategy on local infrastructure development by strengthening DOLIDAR\u2019s capacity and \neffectiveness, and the development of improved procedures and practices for different aspects of \nrural  infrastructure  management,  particularly  road  maintenance.  The  TA  will  draw  together, \nassess,  and  build  on  the  achievements  and  experience  of  procedures  already  being  used  in \ndifferent programs within the sector. The highest priority is to help DOLIDAR instill a maintenance \nculture  in  DDCs,  and  establish  effective  planned  rural  road  maintenance  practices.  A  range  of \nsubjects require new or revised procedures, and priorities will be agreed on before the TA period, \nbased on a detailed review of ongoing initiatives and with the consensus of key stakeholders. The \nterms of reference, cost estimate, and financing plan for the TA are in Appendix 9. \n \nThe  total  TA  cost  is  estimated  at  $500,000  equivalent.  The  Government  has  requested \n45. \nADB  to  finance  $400,000  equivalent,  covering  all  of  the  foreign  exchange  costs  ($270,000 \nequivalent) and part of the local costs. The TA will be funded by ADB on a grant basis from its TA \nfunding program. The proposed government contribution of $100,000 equivalent will cover office \nand staff costs, field transport, and facilities for seminars and training. The international consultant \nwill be recruited from the International Labour Organization, which supplied the specialist inputs in \nprevious  ADB  TA  to  DOLIDAR  and  has  satisfactorily  provided  such  assistance  to  a  number  of \nother ADB rural infrastructure projects. The international team leader will manage the consultant \nteam and TA output finalization. The TA will be housed in a separate office in DOLIDAR, staffed \nby  a  grade-II  engineer  and  by  support  staff  to  work  as  counterparts  to  the  consultants.  The \ncounterpart  team  will  liaise  closely  with  other  divisions  of  DOLIDAR,  with  other  projects  in  the \nsector and MLD, and with DDCs.  \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nEconomic Impacts \n\nA. \n \n46. \nThe  Project  seeks  to  reduce  rural  poverty  through  increased  access  to  economic \nopportunities and social services. The Project\u2019s economic impacts include increased economic \ngrowth  and  jobs  in  the  project  area.  Communities  living  within  the  influence  area  of  rural \ntransport  infrastructure  subprojects  will  benefit  from  better  access  to  markets,  sources  of \nproduction inputs, and extension services. Transport costs for, and time spent on, input supply \nand marketing of surpluses will be reduced. With better market access farmers will be able to \nconsider expanding production and cultivating high-value crops. Farmers will respond to these \nincentives  through  the  price  mechanism  to  increase  the  value  of  rural  crop  production  and \nreduce  food  insecurity.  Productive  agriculture,  reduced  travel  costs,  and  improved  access  to \nservices for subproject beneficiaries will together create on- and off-farm rural jobs. \n \n47. \nThe  economic  evaluation  analyzes  the  economic  viability  of  five  types  of  transport \ninfrastructure  that  the  Project  will  finance.  Appraised  at  a  12%  discount  rate,  all  the  subprojects \nhave  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  higher  than  12%.  The  district  road  rehabilitation \n\n                                                 \n10  ADB.  1996.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Nepal  for  Institutional  Strengthening  for  Rural  Infrastructure \nDevelopment.  Manila.  ADB  1998.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Nepal  for  Institutional  Reforms  in  the \nAgriculture Sector. Manila \n\n \n\n\fand main trail improvement subprojects show very robust economic viability, with EIRRs greater \nthan 30%. The remaining three types of subproject (new trail bridge, new village road, and village \nroad rehabilitation) have rates of return of around 13%, close to the limit of viability. Their lower \nrate  of  economic  return  is  to  be  expected  given  the  project  focus  on  poor  areas  with  limited \nresource  endowments.  The  subprojects,  however,  will  generate  significant,  but  not  easily \nquantifiable, additional benefits, including direct employment of local poor people on construction \nworks, capacity building, improvements in livelihoods, restoration of incomes, and increased use \nby rural communities of health and educational services. Any roads supported by the Project will \nbe trafficable during the dry season. The period of closure through the monsoon does not have a \nsignificant  impact  on  benefits,  since  there  are  few  agricultural products at that time of year, and \ntravel  is  traditionally  low  during  this  busy  crop-growing  period.  The  summary  project  justification \nand financial and economic analyses are in Appendix 10. \n \nB.  \n \n48. \nApproximately  2.5  million  people  live  in  the  selected  districts,  of  whom  1.5  million  are \nbelow  the  poverty  line.  Assuming  that  subproject  funds  are  invested  primarily  in  motorable \nroads, 800,000\u20131,200,000 direct beneficiaries are estimated, 65% or more of whom (520,000\u2013\n780,000) will be poor. Of these, about 25% (130,000\u2013195,000) are from disadvantaged castes. \nEstimates show that 780,000 poor people will directly benefit from a wage income increase of \naround  25%  over  the  subproject  and  supplementary  investment  construction  period,  and  that \n200,000 people will be lifted out of poverty. A total of 34,700 person-years of employment are \nexpected  to  be  created  by  the  project  infrastructure  investments,  significantly  contributing  to \nincome restoration in conflict-affected districts.  \n\nPoverty Reduction Impacts \n\n49. \nThe  skill  training  received  as  part  of  BG  mobilization  gives  the  very  poor,  particularly \ndisadvantaged  castes  and  ethnic  minorities,  increased  capability  to  benefit  from  other \ndevelopment initiatives and to increase social capital, resulting in a decrease in social exclusion \nand vulnerability. All the people in the subproject zones of influence will benefit from improved \naccess to markets and other service facilities, resulting in improved life choices and increased \nwelfare and income. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 11. \n\nC. \n\nSocial Impacts \n\n50. \nBesides  increasing  income,  the  Project  will  reduce  the  social  exclusion  of  very  poor \nhouseholds,  particularly  disadvantaged  castes  and  ethnic  minorities,  through  a  social \nmobilization program of community workshops focusing on participation, gender, and integration \nof  issues  concerning  women  and  disadvantaged  castes  within  local  communities.  Community \nawareness  training  will  increase  participation  in  decision  making,  raise  social  capital,  reduce \ndiscrimination  of  women,  enable  access  to  other  development  opportunities,  and  increase  the \nuse  of  local  health  and  education  facilities  by  all  social  groups.  Increasing  awareness  will \nreduce  vulnerabilities  and  increase  capacity  building  for  all  individuals  and  communities. \nIncreased  community  participation  by  all  social  groups  will  enable  representative  decision \nmaking and effective planning, and reduce elite control of rural life, thereby addressing one of \nthe causes of the conflict. Increased confidence and participation in community life by the most \nvulnerable  will  provide \nthe \ndisadvantaged  can  lift  themselves  out  of  poverty  and  have  a  more  secure,  less  vulnerable \nfuture.  The  Project  will  also  support  building  capacity  of  local  NGOs  to  deliver  support  and \ntraining to communities and BGs through programs already developed for the selected districts \n\nlong-term  social  benefits,  expanding \n\nlife  choices  so \n\nthat \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n16\n\n  \n\n \n\n\f17  \n\nby  other  agencies.  Enhanced  NGO  capacities  will  produce  long-term  benefits  for  other  NGO \nprogram activities in the project districts. \n\nResettlement \n\nGender and Development Issues \n\nD. \n \n51. \nLack  of  access  and  low  levels  of  human  capital  constrain  poor  rural  women  who  face \nproblems  in  marketing  produce,  using  health  services,  finding  jobs,  obtaining  clean  water, \ncollecting  fodder  and  fuel  wood,  and  traveling  to  district  centers.  The  ongoing  conflict  has \ngenerated  new  challenges  for  women  as  men  either  join  the  conflict  or  migrate  to  escape  it, \nleaving  women  to  manage  daily  family  subsistence  needs.  The  Project  will  increase  (i) \nparticipation of women and disadvantaged ethnic groups and castes in subproject planning, and \n(ii)  capacity  of  policymakers  and  managers  to  promote  good  governance  and  gender \nresponsiveness. The Project will specifically implement a gender action plan with set activities \nand  targets  to  enhance  the  social  and  financial  capital  of  women.  If  significant  indigenous \npeoples  issues  emerge  in  subprojects  during  project  implementation,  an  indigenous  peoples \nplan will be prepared. \n \nE. \n \n52. \nThe main socially negative impacts of infrastructure projects result from permanent land \nacquisition. The Project may require significant land acquisition where new roads will be built. A \nproject  resettlement  framework  was  prepared  to  ensure  compliance  with  ADB's  resettlement \npolicy.  This  framework  and  a  sample  summary  resettlement  plan  for  a  core  subproject  are \nsupplementary appendixes. \n \nF. \n \n53. \nThe  Project  is  not  likely  to  cause  any  significant  negative  environmental  impacts  since \nseveral  safeguards  have  been  incorporated  into  the  project  design.  Subprojects  that  exceed \nthresholds  warranting  environmental  impact  assessments  or  are  in  designated  environmentally \nsensitive areas are excluded from consideration at the subproject selection stage. Subprojects that \nrequire initial environmental examinations (IEEs) will be identified through the subproject selection \ncriteria. The Project will provide technical and financial support to ensure that the IEE is conducted \nand  mitigation  measures  implemented  to  the  standards  of  government  and  ADB  environmental \nregulations. Subprojects are designed and constructed adopting the LEP approach, which aims to \nminimize  environmental  impacts.  Project  activities  will  be  independently  monitored  to  ensure \ncompliance  with  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures.  MLD  will  select \nsubprojects  and  approve  subproject  IEEs.  Subprojects  costing  more  than  $30,000  per  kilometer \nwill also require ADB approval. The above procedures for screening and designing a subproject \nbased  on  an  IEE  were  carried  out  during  project  preparation.  The  procedures  were  considered \nsufficient to ensure compliance with government and ADB environmental regulations.  \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\nRisks \n\nG.  \n \n54. \nThe  armed  conflict  and  instability  represent  a  project  risk.  The  project  districts  include \nthose that are active sites for conflict. In general, the experience of development partners working \nin  conflict  areas \ninfrastructure  project \nimplementation,  since  rural  communities  attach  a  high  priority  to  improving  livelihoods  and  rural \naccess.  The  Project  will  seek  to  work  gradually  through  local  people  and  ongoing  projects  of \ndevelopment  partners  with  the  assistance  of  local  NGOs,  and  to  emphasize  transparency  and \n\ninsurgents  have  not  hindered  rural \n\nthat \n\nthe \n\nis \n\n \n\n\flivelihood \n\ninfrastructure  and \n\nflexibility. Achievement of tangible benefits for communities as quickly as possible is an important \nsuccess  factor  in  working  in  conflict  areas.  Based  on  the  experience  of  ongoing  projects  of \ndevelopment  partners,  rural \nimprovement  projects  can  be \nimplemented  in  conflict  areas  if  the  above  approaches  are  used.  The  Project  will  apply  the  key \nlessons learned, which are to work gradually with the communities, and to take a flexible approach \nin each location. Local conditions will be closely monitored. \n \n55. \nLocal elites could attempt to use the Project\u2019s injection of funds into a district to improve \ntheir personal circumstances, and to use their patronage and influence to divert project resources \nto their own benefit and away from the intended beneficiaries. The project design incorporates a \nwide  array  of  measures  to  mitigate  this  risk.  These  include  awareness  raising  and  information \ndissemination, social mobilization, use of BGs whose members are poor and from disadvantaged \ngroups, community-based auditing, intensive on-site supervision, capacity building for participatory \nand  accountable  operation  of  the  DDCs,  and  emphasis  on  monitoring  project  processes  and \nDDCs\u2019 performance. These measures are intended to prevent improper diversion of funds, and to \nallow  prompt  identification  of  any  misuse  of  funds  so  that  remedial  actions  can  be  taken  and,  if \nappropriate, sanctions imposed.  \n \n56. \nA  risk  associated  with  achieving  the  intended  long-term  benefits  from  improved  rural \ntransport  infrastructure  is  that  the  roads  will  not  be  maintained  in  good  condition.  During  project \nimplementation the risk is that DDCs may not be able to mobilize sufficient resources to maintain \nproject-financed,  and  other  motorable,  links  in  their  rural  road  networks.  The  project  design \nprovides financing support and sets targets for the districts at different stages of implementation. \nAchievement  of  these  targets  will  be  monitored  to  assess  the  DDCs\u2019  performance.  Project \nmeasures will also seek to create a maintenance culture in the project districts, and to establish \nlocal  capacity  for  planned  maintenance.  In  the  long  term  the  risks  are  that  measures  already \nproposed by the Government for sustainable financing of rural road maintenance will not be put in \nplace  nationwide,  and  that  DDCs  will  revert  to  investing  limited  funds  in  new  roads  rather  than \nmaintenance  of  the  existing  network.  The  first  risk  will  be  addressed  through  continuing  policy \ndialogue  between  ADB  and  the  Government.  The  institutional  development  TA  will  address  the \nsecond  risk  by  strengthening  DOLIDAR\u2019s  capacity  to  provide  DDCs  with  maintenance \nmanagement  guidance  and  direction  and  to  monitor  rural  road  maintenance  performance \nnationwide. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nA. \n \n57. \nassurances, which are incorporated into the legal documents.  \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nIf cofinancing by GTZ and SDC has not been obtained by 28 February 2005, the \nscope  of  rural  transport  and  supplementary  infrastructure  and  their  respective \ncomponents will be reduced.  \nThe Government will finalize the national policy and strategy on local infrastructure \ndevelopment  by  31  December  2004,  and  the  rural  infrastructure  subsector  policy \non gender by 31 August 2005. \nThe  approved  annual  budget  allocations  for  the  Project  will  be  sufficient  to  cover \nrequired counterpart funding, including resettlement-related payments. \nFor a district to be eligible for subproject funding, a DTMP must be approved. \n\n18\n\n  \n\n \n\n\f19  \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nfrom \n\nin  kind \n\ntransport \n\nthe  beneficiaries \n\ninfrastructure,  and  15% \n\nBefore  commencing  project  activities  in  any  community,  DOLIDAR  and  the  DDC \nwill enter into a project agreement, regulating (a) DDC counterpart funding of 10% \nfor \nfor \nsupplementary investments; (b) terms and conditions of release of funding from the \nDDC to BGs; (c) establishment and staffing of the DPO; (d) auditing and reporting \nmechanism to PCU; and (e) coordination mechanisms with similar activities under \nother projects in the district. \nFor works to be undertaken in any community, the DDC and VDC, and VDC and \nBGs  will  enter  into  contracts,  acceptable  in  form  and  substance  to  ADB,  before \nworks  start,  regulating \n  (a)  provision  of  VDC  contribution;  (b)  minimum \nspecifications  and  standards  of  construction  works  performed  by  the  BGs;  (c) \nminimum specifications and standards for maintenance of works to be performed \nby  BGs;  (d)  environmental  standards  applicable  to  the  design,  construction,  and \noperation and maintenance of works; and (e) employment terms and conditions for \nBG members, including wage rate and frequency of pay. \n\n(vii)  Recruitment,  training,  and  deployment  to  villages  of  social  mobilizers  will  be \ninitiated  from  the  beginning  of  the  Project  and  before  construction  activities  start. \nSocial mobilization contracts will be only with local NGOs that have a track record \nof  relevant  experience  over  at  least  three  years.  The  social  mobilization  program \nwill facilitate full dissemination of project information to beneficiaries and effective \nparticipation  by  women,  the  poor,  and  disadvantaged  groups  in  project  activities. \nDDCs  will  act  upon  the  findings  and  recommendations  from  performance \nmonitoring  of  social  mobilization  service  delivery  in  respect  of  DDCs\u2019  contractual \narrangements with local NGOs. \n\n(x) \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  Selection and approval of subprojects will be in accordance with agreed-on criteria. \nSubprojects  will  be  technically  suited  for  construction  using  the  LEP  approach, \nwhich will be used for all road and trail construction.  \nUnskilled jobs in subproject BGs will be reserved for beneficiaries living within the \ninfluence  of  the  infrastructure  to  be  constructed.  Workers  will  be  paid  in  full \nfortnightly.  \nDOLIDAR  and  participating  districts  will  take  all  measures  to  increase  rural  road \nmaintenance  funding  to  a  sustainable  level,  including by establishing district road \nmaintenance  funds.  The  Project  will  not  finance  new  roads  unless  adequate \nallocations to maintain existing infrastructure have been made. Before 14 April of \neach  year  during  project  implementation,  DOLIDAR  will  agree  with  ADB  on  the \nannual maintenance program for rural roads in the project districts for the following \nyear.  By  14  March  of  every  year  DOLIDAR  will  submit  to  ADB  for  review  the \nproposed maintenance budget. \nDOLIDAR will ensure that gender issues are considered in project implementation, \nwith  respect  to  project  beneficiaries  and  staff  recruited  by  DOLIDAR,  and \nparticipating  NGOs  and  consulting  firms,  in  accordance  with  the  Project\u2019s  gender \naction plan. \nThe Government will ensure that civil-works contractors comply with all applicable \nlabor  laws.  Bidding  documents  will  include  a  clause  prohibiting  child  labor  for \nconstruction  and  maintenance,  and  a  clause  specifying  equal  pay  for  men  and \nwomen  for  work  of  equal  value.  Compliance  with  these  provisions  will  be  strictly \nmonitored during project implementation.  \nIf involuntary resettlement and land or asset acquisition are required for subprojects \nor supplementary investments, a resettlement plan will be prepared. The DDC will \npublicly  disclose  the  resettlement  plan  in  places  and  using  language \n\n(xiii) \n\n(xii) \n\n(xi) \n\n \n\n\faccessible  to  all  affected  people.  The  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  in \naccordance  with  the  approved  resettlement  framework  and  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  on \nResettlement: A Guide to Good Practice, and will include a complete census and \ninventory  of  losses.  DOLIDAR  will  not  approve  any  construction  unless  a \nresettlement plan, in form and substance acceptable to ADB, has been submitted \nto  and  approved  by  the  PCU,  DOLIDAR,  and  ADB.  Land  acquisition,  including \ncompensation  payments,  will  be  completed  before  possession  of  land  and  other \nassets, in accordance with the agreed-on resettlement plan.  \n\n(xiv)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  subprojects  will  be  identified,  selected, \nimplemented, and reported in accordance with the environmental procedures and \nrequirements  specified  in  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedure, \nsubproject  IEEs,  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003),  and \nnational and local environmental laws and regulations. \n\n(xv)  Within  9  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  PCU  will  conduct  any  required  initial \nbaseline  physical  and  socioeconomic  surveys,  and  submit  a  detailed \nimplementation and monitoring plan for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence. The data \nwill cover income and expenditure, livelihoods, demographic trends, gender issues, \nissues  of  ethnic  and  minority  groups,  nutritional  status,  child  labor,  and \nenvironmental issues. Within nine months of loan effectiveness, the PCU will have \nestablished a gender-segregated project performance monitoring system.  \n\n \nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nA  first-year  work  plan  for  the  Project  will  have  been  prepared  and  submitted  for \nADB approval. \nThe Government will have opened a project account at the Nepal Rastra Bank. \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n58. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  27,328,000  to  the  Kingdom  of  Nepal  for  the \nDecentralized Rural Infrastructure and Livelihood Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \nwith  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per \nannum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms \nand  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreement presented to the Board. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n1 September 2004 \n\n \n\n \n\nTadao Chino \n  President \n\n \n\n20\n\n  \n\nB. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1          21 \n\n \n\nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n \nA. \n \nStrategic  Road  Network.  The  development  of  the  strategic  road  network  (SRN)  has \n1. \nlong been a government priority, resulting in around 3,000 kilometers (km) of national highways \nproviding  the  main  strategic  connections  nationwide,  and  nearly  2,000  km  of  feeder  roads \nconnecting  highways  to  regional  and  district  headquarters  and  to  major  economic  centers,  all \nunder the responsibility of the Department of Roads (DOR). All 20 district headquarters on the \nplains are connected to the SRN, and within about 2 years all but five of the hill and mountain \ndistrict  centers  will  be  connected,  assuming  committed  programs  are  fulfilled.  The  SRN  forms \nthe  national  network  from  which  the  local  transport  infrastructure  system  extends  within  the \ndistricts. \n \n2. \nRural  Roads.  A  system  of  rural  roads  and  trails  provides  access  to  rural  areas  from \nadministrative centers and the SRN. In the last two decades efforts have increased to build rural \nroads to the hills, including initiatives by local authorities (district development committees [DDCs] \nand village development committees [VDCs]); and government agencies such as DOR, Ministry of \nAgriculture  and  Cooperatives,  and,  more  recently,  Department  of  Local \nInfrastructure \nDevelopment and Agricultural Roads (DOLIDAR), using national resources, and through external \nfunding agency-assisted projects. DOLIDAR has designated two categories of rural road. District \nroads are within a district and connect more than one VDC or important economic facilities such \nas  markets  and  tourism  centers  to  the  district  headquarters,  either  directly  or  via  the  SRN. \nTypically these roads carry little or no through traffic and are owned by the DDC. Village roads are \nshort, no-through roads linking VDCs to an economic facility or to a higher class of road to provide \naccess to the district center. These roads are owned by the VDCs. The latest government figures \nsuggest  that  the  country  has  about  6,600  kms  of  district  roads,  two  thirds  of which are earthen, \nand a maximum of perhaps 4,000 km of earthen trafficable village roads. \n \nTrails and Footbridges. Significant efforts have been made to develop local transport \n3. \ninfrastructure  in  the  hills  and  mountains  by  constructing,  or  improving  existing,  nonmotorable \ntrails  and  footbridges.  Government  investments  to  provide  improved  trails  and  bridges  have \nbeen  supplemented  by  external  agency  financing  over  many  years,  including  integrated  rural \ndevelopment programs. Accurate data are not readily available, but some 130,000 km of main \ntrails  are  estimated  to  have  been  built  or  rehabilitated,  and  at  least  900  suspension  bridges \nhave been constructed nationwide.  \n \n4. \nThe  Labor-Based,  Environmentally  Friendly,  and  Participatory  Approach  to  Rural \nRoad  Construction.  The  \u201cgreen  roads\u201d  approach  was  originally  developed  in  Nepal  under  a \nprogram financed by the Government of Germany\u2019s Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit \n(GTZ).  DOLIDAR  has  adopted  the  approach,  formalizing  it  as  labor-based,  environmentally \nfriendly,  and  participatory  (LEP).  It  is  intended  to  (i)  employ  local  people,  rather  than  use  heavy \nequipment, to build roads; (ii) apply design and construction methods that minimize the damage \nto, and where possible, enhance the fragile physical environment in hill areas; and (iii) incorporate \nlocal  interests  and  opinions  in  the  planning,  design,  implementation,  and  management  of  rural \nroad infrastructure. The LEP approach is in stark contrast to uncontrolled rural road construction \nthat  continues  to  be  practiced  by  local  authorities.  Often  unplanned,  badly  excavated, \nunmaintainable  (and  frequently  impassable)  earth  tracks  are  constructed  with  bulldozers, \nsignificantly damaging the environment. \n \n\n \n\n\f22\n\n         Appendix 1 \n\nNational Subsector Policy and Strategy Framework \n\nRural  Road  Maintenance.  Funding  to  maintain  rural  roads  is  inadequate.  The \n5. \nGovernment must ensure that it is increased to sustain existing and new rural road infrastructure \nin the long term. In December 2002 the Government established an independent Road Board with \na separate Road Fund for maintenance. The board must allocate about 30% of the fund\u2019s annual \ndisbursements  to  roads  owned  by  DDCs,  municipalities,  and  VDCs,  which  must  provide  25%  in \nmatching funds. However, DDCs lack the funds to implement DOLIDAR\u2019s National Plan for Rural \nRoad  Maintenance  (2000),  and,  in  any  case,  many  districts  still  have  inadequate  capacity  to \nundertake  satisfactory  maintenance  management.  Therefore,  while  maintenance  of  strategic \nroads  has  improved,  DOLIDAR,  the  Road  Board,  DDCs,  and  VDCs  must  prioritize  adequate \nmaintenance of the rapidly expanding network of rural roads for several years to ensure that local \nbodies maintain rural roads. Before central funds are allocated for new construction projects, strict \nguidelines  are  required  in  plans  and  programs  for  DDCs  to  demonstrate  that  they  can  manage \nexisting  infrastructure  in  a  sustainable  manner.  The  proportions  of  funding  made  available  by \nDDCs must be shifted to increase allocations to maintenance budget lines and decrease amounts \nfor  new  development.  Finally,  areas  from  which  local  bodies  are  permitted  to  raise  significant \nrevenue must be increased. These actions are consistent with national and district policies. The \nProject will support the planning and actions required to improve maintenance planning, financing, \nand implementation. A related institutional development technical assistance (TA) grant will help \nDOLIDAR  develop  an  institutional  culture  and  workable  strategy  to  support  rural  road \nmaintenance.  The  TA  will  also  help  the  Project  strengthen  district-level  capacity  to  undertake \nmaintenance (Appendix 9). \n \nB. \n \nNational Strategy for Rural Infrastructure Development. Issued in 1997, the strategy is \n6. \nderived from and supports the aims of the Agriculture Perspective Plan, and is consistent with the \nnational  policy  of  decentralization.  The  strategy  sets  out  the  objectives  for  rural  infrastructure \ndevelopment.  The  strategy  led  to  the  creation  of  DOLIDAR  and  has  largely  achieved  several \nstrategy objectives. However, others have not been addressed, and the strategy is vague about its \ngoal the development of basic rural infrastructur).  \n \n7. \nDecentralization  Policy.  In  1999  the  Government  approved  the  Local  Self-Governance \nAct (LSGA), following the strategy of the Ninth Five-Year (1997-2002) and Tenth Five-Year (2002-\n2007) Plans. The LSGA gives DDCs responsibility for local infrastructure. Certain responsibilities \nfor local infrastructure are devolved further to VDCs. All DDCs receive an annual block grant from \nthe  Government  for  administrative  and  development  expenditures,  and  a  proportion  of  the \ndevelopment grant is allocated for rural roads. All VDCs receive an equal annual grant from the \nGovernment, part of which should be spent on local infrastructure. These devolved responsibilities \nprovide  the  framework  for  projects  to  work  with  districts  as  a focus for activities, and to achieve \nbetter equity of resource distribution by adopting more participatory approaches, and incorporating \nmeasures to improve local governance. \n \n8. \nNational Policy and Strategy for Local Infrastructure Development. The Government \nis finalizing a national policy and strategy for local infrastructure development to update the 1997 \nstrategy  to  be  consistent  with  the  decentralization  policy.  The  policy  aims  to  support  and \naccelerate  sustainable  development  of  local  infrastructure  in  the  spirit  of  the  LSGA  and  the \nprinciple  of  devolution  of  power,  through  plans  for  pro-poor  development.  The  policy  advocates \ngradual handing over of infrastructure ownership to local bodies, giving DDCs control over VDCs \nand municipalities, and improving procedures.  \n  \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1          23 \n\n \n\nLessons Learned \n\nC. \n \n9. \nPast  rural  infrastructure  projects  experienced  some  problems,  and  the  lessons  learned \nhave  been  incorporated  into  the  project  design.  The  Asian  Development  Bank-funded  Rural \nInfrastructure  Development  Project  was  studied  in  the  greatest  depth.  It  has  built  significant \nphysical  infrastructure,  but  problems  have  occurred  regarding  the  cost  and  sustainability  of \nproject roads, and lack of targeting of poor local people for construction jobs. Some of the most \nimportant lessons learned in the subsector are in Table A1. A key lesson is that often the pro-\npoor  objectives  of  projects  are  not  prioritized  during  implementation,  and  local  elites  benefit \ndisproportionately  from  infrastructure  investments.  Therefore,  the  design  of  recent  rural \ninfrastructure  projects  of  other  development  partners,  and  the  Project  emphasize  careful \ntargeting of the poor and disadvantaged to ensure that they are prioritized to become members \nof  building  groups  (BGs),  and  benefit  from  community  development,  livelihood  interventions, \nand rural infrastructure. \n \n\nTable A1: Key Lessons Learned from the Rural Infrastructure Development Project \n\n \nIssue \nCompliance with the pro-poor aims of \nthe Project. \n\nConstruction methodology and \nsafeguarding of project benefits. \n\nMaintenance and sustainability of \ndistrict-owned infrastructure. \n\nSelection of subprojects for funding. \n\nExtent of benefit to public sector \norganizations from capacity \ndevelopment initiatives. \n\nLack of capacity in the private sector. \n\nSocial mobilization procedures. \n\nAccountability of stakeholder \norganizations. \n\n \n\n \n\nLesson \nInvestments must conform to rigorous \nselection and feasibility criteria, and be \nmonitored to ensure compliance with \nagreed-on project objectives \n(Supplementary Appendix A). \nIntensive supervision is needed to \nensure quality of works through the \nlabor-based, environmentally friendly, \nand participatory construction \napproach.  \nNew infrastructure will only be properly \nmaintained if specific capacity support \nis directed to district development \ncommittees (DDCs).  \nMust be rigorous to ensure that the \nscale of civil works is appropriate to the \ninstitutions involved and to the \nconstruction methodology adopted. \nDistrict technical offices and the \nDepartment of Local Infrastructure \nDevelopment and Agricultural Roads \nstaff positions must be filled according \nto planned levels, and transfers \nminimized. \nPrivate sector organizations require \nsignificant capacity development inputs.\n\nThese need to be upgraded and more \ntime given to preconstruction \npreparatory activities. \nAll organizations involved in project \nexecution and implementation must be \nmade fully accountable. Community \naudits should be used.  \n\nRationale \nStrong political pressure exists to use \ncontracting systems that do not deliver \nthe key benefits and, in some cases, \nappear linked to resource leakage. \n\nWorkers are unskilled and engineering \ndesign is finalized during construction. \nEnsuring safeguards for poor laborers \nand avoiding benefit capture by elites \nrequire careful controls. \nDDCs have inadequate skills and \ncapacity for maintenance, and political \npressure is strong for new construction \nrather than maintenance. \nDDCs will not use strict selection \ncriteria of their own accord, and so \nsafeguards must be in place to ensure \nthis occurs. \nGovernment restrictions on financial \nresources limit staff recruitment and \nimprovement of incentive structures. \n\nThis is essential to enable them to take \non greater responsibilities, even at the \ntechnical level. \nBenefits from civil-works jobs must be \ntargeted at poor local people, and \ngreater accountability achieved. \nOn many projects the local road-user \ncommittees are not accountable. \nAllegations of malpractice usually focus \nmost strongly around these \ncommittees, but other groups also \nshow shortcomings. \nManagement must be informed of \nissues that require attention. \n\nMonitoring of site works. \n\nA strong and independent monitoring \nprocedure is required. \n\n\f24\n\n         Appendix 1 \n\ninstitutional \n\nthat  makes \n\nframework  exists \n\nOverview.  Although  an \n\nInstitutional Framework of the Rural Infrastructure Subsector \n\nD. \n \n10. \ninfrastructure \ndevelopment  appear  straightforward  through  management  by  DDCs  and  supply  of  services  by \nprivate  sector  companies  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  organizations  operating  at \nthe  district  level  have  their  weaknesses.  These  issues  exist  within  a  well-structured  framework, \nwhere  planning  processes  are  laid  out  in  various  legal  provisions,  funding  systems  are  in  place \nthat  give  considerable  control  to  the  local  bodies,  and  procurement  procedures  are  extensively \ndocumented in the Government\u2019s Public Works Directives (2002).1 Subprojects are identified from \nthe district transport master plans, which are prepared based on suggestions put forward by VDCs \nand  communities.  VDCs  make  their  recommendations  after  community  needs  are  identified \nthrough consultative meetings according to the decentralized government planning process. The \nproject  design  recognizes  that  these  local  consultative  meetings  may  not  necessarily  be \nrepresentative, hence the need for the Project\u2019s community development component. The aim is \nto  enable  all  community  groups  to  participate  and  articulate  their  preferences  and  improve  their \ninvolvement  in  community  decision  making.  This  program  is  long  term  in  implementation  and \nimpact  and  operates  in  parallel  with  subproject  selection.  While  the  community  development \ncomponent will enhance subproject decision making, the component\u2019s intended impact will be to \nimprove all forms of community decision making and participation. \n \nCoordination of Rural Infrastructure. Guidelines, procedures, and technical support for \n11. \nrural  infrastructure  development  and  management  are  responsibilities  of  DOLIDAR.  A  new \ndepartment,  it  has  concentrated  on  transport  planning  and  coordinating  rural  road  construction \nand  maintenance,  preparing  manuals  and  guidelines,  and  centrally  managing  external  funding \nagency  and  government-financed  programs.  With  the  establishment  of  the  Road  Board  and  its \nRoad  Fund,  DOLIDAR  is  also  now  responsible  for  coordinating  local  bodies\u2019  road  maintenance \nplans  and  consolidating  them  into  a  nationwide  annual  road  maintenance  plan.  The  Project  will \nsupport  DOLIDAR  in  all  these  activities  through  the  institutional  development  TA.  DOLIDAR\u2019s \nsupport from the center to each district is focused on the district technical offices (DTOs).  \n \n12. \nLocal  Government  Capacity.  Rural  infrastructure  is  owned,  depending  on  the  class  of \nroad,  by  DDCs  and  VDCs.  VDCs  need  substantial  capacity  building  to  allow  them  to  build, \noperate, and maintain infrastructure on any scale. The 75 DDCs have greater resources than the \nVDCs,  including  DTOs.  While  some  DTOs  are  not  fully  staffed,  they  do  have  a  professional \nengineer,  supported  by  a  technical  team.  DDCs  and  VDCs  responsible  for  local  infrastructure \ndevelopment suffer several constraints, including (i) a lack of funds, staff, and logistics resources; \n(ii)  lack  of  organizational  clarity,  since  who  should  take  responsibility  for  many  activities  is \nuncertain; (iii) operational difficulties because of conflicts between more than 20 sectoral acts and \nthe LSGA provisions; (iv) lack of coordination of development activities among the DDCs, central \ngovernment line agencies, and NGOs; (v) limited commitment to, or conceptual clarity in, rational \nplanning for efficient use of scarce resources, with decisions often made to deal with crises and to \nmeet distributional and political imperatives; (vi) lack of participation, and of attention to awareness \nraising  among  the  people;  (vii)  limited  transparency  and  accountability;  and  (viii)  lack  of \nsupervision and monitoring skills and capacity, and little interest in critical evaluation. The Project \nincludes a considerable element of training and capacity building to help tackle these problems. \n \n13. \nPrivate  Sector  Consulting  Company  Capacity.  Local  consultants  tend  to  operate \nnationally,  mostly  from  Kathmandu.  Many  employ  engineers  with  a  considerable  range  of \n\n                                                 \n1 Government of Nepal. 2002. Public Works Directives. Kathmandu \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1          25 \n\n \n\nqualifications and skills, yet output standards are often lower than satisfactory due to some or all of \nthe  following:  (i)  a  poorly  developed  concept  of  professionalism  in  the  engineering  sector;  (ii)  a \nculture that assumes that, once trained, individuals do not need to update their skills; (iii) a lack of \nappropriate  technical skills for low-cost engineering approaches; (iv) a reliance on overdesigned \nand expensive structures to compensate for uncertainties and recriminations if low-cost structures \nfail; (v) conflicting messages from successive changes of approach between different projects; (vi) \nlack of managerial supervision; (vii) an overdeveloped interest in company profits above technical \nissues, frequently leading to poor terms of employment and late salary payments to site staff, and \na reluctance to employ staff between contracts, leading to rapid staff turnover and lack of loyalty; \nand  (viii)  the  effects  of  corruption  in  the  institutional  environment,  leading  to  cynicism  and \ndemoralization  as  to  the  role  of  sound  engineering  practices.  Used  for  many  district  technical \nworks,  consultants  will  be  provided  with  intensive  training  and  guidance  by  the  central  project \nimplementation consultant. \n \n14. \nLocal  Nongovernment  Organization  Capacity.  A  large  number  of  local  NGOs  are \nregistered, with objectives ranging from community development to those more business oriented. \nLocal  NGOs  face  a  number  of  constraints,  including  (i)  lack  of  skills  in  social  interaction  and \nmobilization;  (ii)  political  leanings  that  exclude  many  potential  beneficiaries;  (iii)  overreliance  on \nideological approaches to development that do not take practical factors into account; (iv) lack of \ncontinuity in work, leading to cash-flow problems and the need to lay off staff between contracts; \n(v)  lack  of  managerial  supervision;  (vi)  lack  of  skills  in  financial  management,  and  poor \ngovernment regulation that permits weak corporate control to go unchecked; and (vii) inability to \nresist pressure from the corrupt institutional environment, leading to biased operations. The central \nproject implementation consultant will address these problems through training and guidance. \n \nE. \n \n15. \nDuring project implementation, financial management begins with preparation of an annual \nwork  program  and  budget.  This  originates  in  the  districts  but  is  consolidated  (in  the  case  of  the \nProject) by the project coordination unit. The annual budget program is submitted to the Ministry of \nLocal  Development,  National  Planning  Commission,  and  Ministry  of  Finance  before  approval  by \nParliament. Approval is followed by authority to spend, which is given, in turn, by the secretaries of \nfinance  and  local  development,  and  by  the  director  general  of  DOLIDAR.  Budget  release  is \nsignificantly delayed every year.  \n \n16. \nTimely payment to BGs is important, as they are composed of the poorest laborers. The \non-site  presence  of  project  staff  from  the  district  project  office  will  help  facilitate  prompt \nmeasurement  of  completed  works  and  preparation  of  payment  claims.  However,  in  practice  the \ntime  taken  to  check  and  authorize  these  payments,  issue  checks,  and  complete  payments  to \nlaborers  means  that  a  fortnightly  schedule  cannot  be  met  other  than  in  exceptional  cases.  To \novercome  this  problem,  a  system  of  advances  and  running  bills  must  be  used  to  ensure  that \nlaborers receive their wages without delay.  \n\nFinancial Management \n\n

While access is a \nprerequisite for sustainable improvements in the livelihoods of the poor, specific measures must \nbe  taken  to  ensure  that  interventions  immediately  ameliorate  the  living  conditions  of  the  most \nmarginalized  sections  of  society,  restore  incomes  and  community  infrastructure  affected  by  the \nconflict, and are then translated into long-term, lasting changes to assets, be they financial, social, \nor other capital. This approach can be simply demonstrated by means of the three main project \ncomponents. The project design ensures that the three components are integrally linked to enable \nthe  infrastructure  investments  to  be  used  as  a  sustainable,  long-term  approach  to  poverty \nreduction.  \n \n2. \nCommunity  Development  and  Rural  Livelihood  Restoration.  The  inequalities  in  rural \ncommunities have led to the widespread failure of disadvantaged groups to benefit from previous \ntop-down interventions that have been captured by a small but relatively wealthy elite, except for \nsome  trickle-down  benefits,  one  of  the  causes  of  the  conflict  in  Nepal.  The  Project  will  reduce \npoverty by raising awareness of rights and opportunities among all parts of the communities, and \nensuring  that  project  interventions  provide  direct  practical  support  for  the  poorest  groups.  The \nProject will use a coordinated, intensive, and wide-reaching series of social mobilization actions so \npeople can build assets, revise livelihood strategies, and have a secure and sustainable existence. \n \nCapacity Building and Decentralized Local Governance. As decentralization continues \n3. \n(paras. 8-10), the Project will seek to build the capacity, and clearly define the appropriate level of \nauthority, of local government institutions to enable them to perform their functions efficiently, and \nto  operate  as  effective,  accountable  service  providers.  Central  institutions  are  not  adapted  to  a \nmodern  governance  role  as  facilitators  and  regulators  of  development  activities.  The  Project  will \nseek to reform and build new capacity in the Department of Local Infrastructure Development and \nAgricultural Roads (DOLIDAR) to facilitate and regulate the rural road sector. \n \nRural Transport Infrastructure. This component will depart from the traditional approach \n4. \nused in previous rural infrastructure interventions. Supported by the community development and \ncapacity-building components, the component will be used to promote community development by \nfinancing  subprojects  to  construct  new,  or  rehabilitate  existing,  rural  transport  infrastructure \nplanned using a participatory approach, and built by employing local poor people in labor-based \nconstruction that uses environmentally sound techniques. Long-term livelihood enhancement and \nincome    restoration  depends  on  all  of  these  elements  being  followed,  and  subsequent \nsustainability requires establishment of a maintenance management system based on the same \napproach. \n \n5. \nProcess  Approach.  The  rural  transport  infrastructure  component  cannot  be  achieved \nthrough a prescriptive list of interventions. A process approach will be used that allows the districts \nto select subprojects through participatory planning mechanisms, and, within the subproject areas, \nallows the beneficiary communities to select and design supplementary investments in social and \neconomic infrastructure that, combined with the social mobilization activities, will enable people to \nbetter access services and markets. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4          33 \n\n \n\nLink with Decentralization \n\nthe  activities  of  high-level  committees,  decentralization \n\nAppropriate  Planning  and  Construction  Approach.  All  project \n\ninfrastructure \n6. \ndevelopment is based on participatory planning and the use of labor-based construction methods \nthat  specifically  include  poor  and  disadvantaged  people.  The  designs  and  techniques  are  also \nenvironmentally  sound,  based  on  the  experience  of  previous  projects  such  as  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Rural Infrastructure Development Project, which had problems related \nto poor works quality and governance. Special project measures are required to ensure that the \npoor derive the benefits due to them. \n \nInvolvement  of  Nongovernment  Organizations.  The  Project  will  prioritize  the  use  of \n7. \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  in  raising  stakeholder  awareness  during  implementation; \nmobilizing  building  groups;  delivering  social  development  interventions;  ensuring  delivery  of \nbenefits,  including  wages;  and  guaranteeing  gender  equality.  Community-based  organizations, \nwhich  are  generally  accepted  by  the  insurgents,  will  also  be  used  in  relation  to  supplementary \ninvestments. Some district development committees (DDCs) implementing project works have little \nexperience  in  this  approach,  although  experience  is  widespread  nationally  from  similar  projects. \nConsulting services engaged by DOLIDAR will provide training and capacity building to the DDCs \nand to the NGOs they engage, in line with standard procedures and recognized best practice. This \ndouble approach has been found to be essential in tapping the resources offered by NGOs, which \nprovide a valuable complement to the services of traditional government line agencies. \n \nB. \n \n8. \nThe Local Self-Governance Act (LSGA) of 1999 and its supporting regulations provide a \nsound framework for decentralized local government. However, despite this legislative provision \nis  proceeding  slowly. \nand \nResponsibilities and resources have not been transferred to local levels, and transparency has \nnot  yet  been  increased.  One  practical  issue  that  constrains  progress  is  the  conflict  between \nLSGA  provisions  and  more  than  20  other  acts.  Decentralized  responsibility  exceeds  the \nauthority given to local government bodies. Local and central institutions duplicate each others\u2019 \nfunctions.  \n \n9. \nFor LSGA provisions to be effective, DDCs and central line agencies must coordinate well, \nwith DDCs\u2019 priorities taking precedence in allocation of centrally managed resources. This change \nis  taking  considerable  time  to  implement,  although  the  establishment  of  the  district  technical \noffices (DTOs), answerable to the DDCs, is an important step forward. The creation and operation \nof DOLIDAR and the implementation of the district transport master planning process mean that \nthe  rural  infrastructure  sector  is  more  advanced  than  most  other  sectors  in  the  transfer  of \nresponsibility and authority to the DDCs and village development committees.  \n \n10. \nUnless  they  have  greater  control  over  financial  resources  than  they  do  now,  local \ngovernment  bodies,  particularly  DDCs,  will  have  difficulty  implementing  LSGA  provisions.  Little \nincentive exists for participatory, local-level planning while DDCs lack the resources to implement \nthe plans. The authority to open sectoral offices and hire professional staff means little while DDCs \ncannot finance this additional capacity. Project support of the nature proposed under the capacity-\nbuilding and decentralized governance component (para. 3) therefore provides a basis for DDCs \nto  undertake  the  entire  decentralized  approach  with  adequate  funding.  Coupled  with  the \ncommunity  development  component,  the  capacity  building  component  enables  DTOs  to  be \nstrengthened, with immediate and lasting benefits to the poor. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f34\n\n        Appendix 4 \n\nProject Area \n\nC. \n \n11. \nThe final number of participating districts was assessed by balancing the aim of reaching \nthe  largest  number  of  beneficiaries  over  as  wide  an  area  as  possible,  and  attempting  to  remain \nactively  engaged  in  conflict-affected  districts,  against  considerations  of  ensuring  that  project \nimplementation is manageable and that sufficient funds are invested in each district to achieve a \nsignificant  impact.  The  criteria  applied  in  selecting  the  project  districts  were  (i)  extent  and \ncharacteristics  of  poverty,  impact  of  the  conflict  in  the  district,  population,  and  agricultural \ncharacteristics  and  potential;  (ii)  level  of  access  to  the  districts  provided  by  the  strategic  road \nnetwork,  level  of  provision  of  road  access  within  districts,  and  planning  benefits  in  clustering \nproject  districts;  (iii)  complementarity  with  other  projects  in  the  districts,  continuity  in  the  ADB \ncountry program, and absorptive capacity constraints at district level; and (iv) district capacity and \nperformance. \n \n12. \nBased on the findings, the Government and ADB have agreed on 18 districts, all extremely \npoor by standard poverty indicators (Appendix 11) and with severe access constraints, including \nthe Far Western districts of Baitadi, Bajhang, Bajura, and Darchula; the Midwestern region districts \nof  Dolpa,  Humla,  Jajarkot,  Jumla,  Kalikot,  and  Mugu;  the  Western  region  districts  of  Baglung, \nGorkha,  Lamjung,  and  Myagdi;  and  the  Central  and  Eastern  region  districts  of  Okhaldhunga, \nRamechhap, Solukhumbu, and Taplejung.   \n \n \n13.  Within the selected districts, project funds will be allocated in two phases through a series \nof subprojects. DDCs will be required to bid for these, following guidelines of eligibility, although \nfunds should be spread between all districts, with the four poorest receiving about 20% more than \nthe others. All subprojects must be small and included as priority elements of the district transport \nmaster  plan.  For  example,  a  new  district  road  will  be  about  20  kilometers  (km)  at  most. \nSubprojects must extend the connectivity of the existing network, be owned by the DDC, and not \nimpinge  on  any  environmentally  sensitive  area.  These  conditions  are  required  to  ensure  cost-\neffectiveness  and  meet  the  Project\u2019s  development  objectives,  particularly  with  respect  to  job \ncreation.  Detailed  feasibility  studies  will  ensure  that  subprojects  are  viable.  A  second  series  of \nsubprojects  will  be  funded  in  the  second  phase,  released  two  years  after  the  first  funding \nallocation.  This  phase  involve  the  same  eligibility  criteria  as  for  the  first  phase,  but  performance \ntests  will  also  be  added,  among  others  related  to  compliance  with  selection  criteria;  extent  and \ntimeliness  of  land  compensation;  and  timeliness,  quality,  and  effectiveness  of  rural  road \nmaintenance and subproject implementation. \n \nD. \n \n14. \nThe  Project  will  support  building  rural  infrastructure  to  nationally  approved  standards \n(Supplementary  Appendix  F).  A  modified  form  of  the  \u201cgreen  road  concept\u201d  will  be  applied,  as \ndeveloped  by  DOLIDAR  in  partnership  with  various  external  funding  agencies.  This  concept \nuses a widely known and proven approach of phased construction over 3\u20134 years. All works are \nlabor-based, using methods that require only limited construction skills, such as bioengineering \nand gabions. The approach is environmentally sound since it minimizes disruption to hill slopes, \nand  balances  cut  and \nto  select  subprojects  and \nsupplementary investments. DOLIDAR refers to the approach as labor-based, environmentally \nfriendly,  and  participatory  (LEP).  Safety  standards  (audits)  will  be  incorporated  into  project \ndesigns, and DTO staff trained as required.  \n \n \n\nInfrastructure Specifications \n\nfill.  Participatory  planning \n\nis  used \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4          35 \n\n \n\nWorking in the Conflict Environment \n\nE. \n \n15. \nBecause  of  the  insurgency,  the  most  immediate  project  risk  is  that  carrying  out  activities \nwill  be  unsafe  or  impractical.  How  the  conflict  will  unfold is unpredictable, so violence, fear, and \ninsecurity must be addressed as part of the working environment.  \n \n16. \nThe continuation of the conflict increases the need to implement the Project so that it can \nhelp  address  the  causes  of  the  conflict\u2014continuing  poverty  and  social  exclusion;  lack  of  rural \nfacilities,  infrastructure,  services,  and  opportunities;  lack  of  participation  and  accountability  in \nresource  use;  and  diversion  of  resources  away  from  the  poor.  Similar  projects  in  the  rural \ninfrastructure  subsector  and  other  sectors  have  been  able  to  continue  and  even  to  start  in  new \nareas during the conflict, without being seriously hindered by the insurgents.1 A small number of \nincidents where work was hampered were only temporary.  \n \n17. \nGiven the project objectives, the situation is likely to remain as it is now and the Project to \noperate relatively unhindered. However, the security situation changes frequently and is location \nspecific. Regular monitoring will therefore be required (para. 20). Some projects have been most \neasily  able  to  continue  where  they  are  already  well  known.  To  continue,  the  projects  need  to \nmaintain  an  informal  dialogue  with  the  insurgents;  focus  on  activities  with  a  direct,  visible,  and \nrapid  developmental  and  employment  impact  (construction  of  infrastructure  and  income \nrestoration,  for  example,  rather  than  conduct  of  workshops);  and  heed  periodic  advice  to  avoid \ncertain areas. Transparency in implementation is also an important risk-mitigation strategy. \n \n18. \nThe Project can achieve quick recognition in two ways. One is to enter into partnerships \nwith  ongoing  projects,  which  will  facilitate  implementation  since  these  are  well  known  and \nestablished  at  the  local  level,  and  recognized  as  doing  valuable  work.  In  practice  this  means \nlinkages  with  the  District  Road  Support  Program  in  the  Central  and  Eastern  districts  of \nOkhaldhunga and Ramechhap, and with the Rural Community Infrastructure Works Programme in \nthe Far Western districts of Baitadi, Bajhang, Bajura, and Darchula. For the other districts, where \npartnership  agreements  may  not  be  possible,  the  second  way  is  to  begin  activities  carefully, \nstarting  modestly  and  expanding  the  Project\u2019s  presence  gradually,  in  close  consultation  and \ndialogue with all concerned parties. This will allow the development of operational procedures that \nare practical, acceptable, and safe in a conflict situation, and that will develop the confidence of all \nlocal stakeholders, including those directly involved in the conflict. \n \n19.  Working in a conflict environment inevitably implies an element of risk to the safety of the \nindividuals  involved,  combined  with  risks  of  loss  of  project  property  and  funds,  and  even  of  the \ninfrastructure  that  is  built.  These  risks  must  clearly  be  judged  acceptable  for  the  Project  to \nproceed, but also imply (i) the importance of monitoring the security and risk situation in all project \ndistricts;  (ii)  the  need  to  train  all  project  field  staff  to  be  effective  in  a  conflict  situation,  and  to \nhandle risk situations where staff safety is under threat; and (iii) the need for contingency plans to \nevacuate  field  staff  promptly  if  the  security  risk  becomes  unacceptable.  In  the  context  of  an \nevolving conflict situation, changing strategies of the Government and those leading the conflict, \nand  poor  communications  in  the  field,  the  risk  is  real  and  immediate  that  institutional  and \n\n                                                 \n1  For  example,  the  Rural  Community  Infrastructure  Works  Programme,  a  government  initiative  supported  by  seven \nexternal  funding  agencies,  has  been  active  in  30  districts, including many of those most heavily affected by conflict. \nThe  Rural  Access  Programme,  funded  by  the  United  Kingdom\u2019s  Department  for  International  Development,  has \nestablished operations in two new conflict-affected districts and has been working through other projects in a further \nfour districts. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36\n\n        Appendix 4 \n\nSafeguards to Ensure Poverty Reduction \n\nimplementation  arrangements  might  prove  inappropriate  in  any  particular  place  or  time.  The \nproject  strategy  will  be  to  consider  alternative  arrangements  as  needs  dictate.  The  Project \ntherefore needs to be flexible and proactive in regularly assessing the validity and applicability of \nproject  implementation  arrangements,  and  revising  them  according to location as circumstances \ndictate. \n \nF. \n \nThe Government will ensure that all project road and trail construction works use the LEP \n20. \napproach  of  (i)  employing  unskilled  labor  instead  of  using  construction  equipment;  (ii)  applying \ndesign and construction methods that protect the physical environment; and (iii) incorporating local \ninterests and opinions in works planning, design, and implementation. The LEP approach will (i) \nphase construction of roads over 3 years, (ii) emphasize the careful selection of the horizontal and \nlongitudinal alignment close to the surface of the hill slope, (iii) aim to balance cut and fill, (iv) build \nstructures  based  on  needs  determined  on-site  and  using  the  lowest-cost  option  that  meets  the \nrequirement, and (v) integrate the use of vegetation as bioengineering to ensure slope protection \nand shallow stabilization.  The Government must also ensure that (i) all unskilled labor employed \non subproject construction works is drawn from within the district, (ii) 40% of all the unskilled jobs \nare reserved for women where demand is sufficient, (iii) laborers receive their full wage based on \nthe work norms for completed tasks, (iv) equal pay is given for equal work, (v) no one under 14 \nyears old is employed, and (vi) employment conditions for unskilled laborers include provision for a \nsavings component. \n\n \n\n\f \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n  \n \n\n \n \n \nItem\n\nTable A5.1: Project Cost Summary, by Componenta \n\n \n \n \n\n(NRe Million)\nForeign\n\nTotal\n\nLocal\n\n(US$ Million)\n\nForeign Base\nLocal Foreign Total Exchange Costs\n\n1,095.6\n87.4\n2,285.7\n243.2\n3,711.9\n310.9\n307.0\n4,329.7\n0.0\n4,329.7\n\n15.3\n10.5\n95.3\n162.0\n283.0\n12.0\n18.2\n313.2\n93.1\n406.3\n\n1,110.8\n97.9\n2,381.0\n405.2\n3,994.9\n322.9\n325.2\n4,643.0\n93.1\n4,736.0\n\n14.4\n1.1\n30.1\n3.2\n48.8\n4.1\n4.0\n57.0\n0.0\n57.0\n\n0.2\n0.1\n1.3\n2.1\n3.7\n0.2\n0.2\n4.1\n1.2\n5.3\n\n14.6\n1.3\n31.3\n5.3\n52.6\n4.2\n4.3\n61.1\n1.2\n62.3\n\n%\n\n% Total\n\n1\n11\n4\n40\n7\n4\n6\n7\n100\n9\n\n28\n2\n60\n10\n100\n8\n8\n116\n2\n119\n\nCommunity Development and Rural Livelihood Restoration\nCapacity Building and Decentralized Governance\nRural Transport Infrastructure\nProject Management Services\n\nTotal Baseline Costs\n\nPhysical Contingencies\nPrice Contingencies\n\nTotal Project Costs\n\nInterest During Implementation\n\nTotal Costs to be Financed\n\na Figures may not add up due to rounding. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n \n\ni\n\n5\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3\n7\n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n \n \nItem\n\nI.

The  Department  of  Local  Infrastructure  Development  and  Agricultural  Roads \n(DOLIDAR) has rapidly accumulated experience in managing external funding agency-financed \nrural infrastructure projects, but project implementation will be complex, and DOLIDAR\u2019s human \nresource capacity is limited. District institutional capacities are also limited. Consultant and NGO \ninputs  are  needed  to  (i)  provide  DOLIDAR  with  the  management  and  advisory  support  and \ncapacity  to  execute  the  Project;  (ii)  undertake  a  broad  range  of  tasks  under  contract  to  the \nimplementing agencies to strengthen district capacity; (iii) develop local NGO capacity in staff-\nintensive  social  mobilization  activities;  and  (iv)  ensure  proper  implementation  of  the  labor-\nbased,  environmentally  friendly,  and  participatory  (LEP)  construction  approach  to  cost-\neffectively  achieve  the  required  standards  and  quality.  These  inputs,  which  include  a  major \ntraining  program,  are  essential  if  the  Project  is  to  achieve  its  social,  institutional,  and  physical \nobjectives, and to (i) help DOLIDAR and district agencies become modern, efficient institutions \nthat  contract  out  much  of  their  work  but  are  able  to  manage  effectively  the  services  provided; \nand  (ii)  help  the  private  and  NGO  sectors  become  capable  of  providing  consistent,  high-\nstandard service upon which central and local government institutions can rely. The TA will be \nfinanced from the loan and co-financiers. \n \nB. \n \nAt the central level, consultants will provide advisory support, specialized expertise, and \n2. \nadditional  professional  staff  capacity  needed  by  the  project  coordination  unit  (PCU)  to \ncomplement  DOLIDAR\u2019s  skills  to  execute  and  manage  the  Project.  These  services  will  be \nprovided primarily by the central project implementation consultant, combining international and \ndomestic  inputs.  International  inputs  are  required  to  overcome  limitations  in  capacities  and \ncapabilities  within  Nepal,  and  to  apply  international  experience  and  best  practices  to  project \nimplementation. DOLIDAR will contract separately for national NGO social consultant services. \nDOLIDAR  is  also  expected  to  contract  separately  with  domestic  individual  consultants  or \ninstitutions to carry out specific training, performance monitoring, environmental, and evaluation \nactivities. \n \n3. \nThe  central  project  implementation  consultant  services  will  be  provided  by  an \nassociation  of  international  and  domestic  firms  selected  and  engaged  on  an  internationally \ncompetitive basis using the quality- and cost-based selection procedure, in accordance with the \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  by  ADB  and  its  Borrowers    and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. A total of about \n90 person-months of international and 425 person-months of domestic expertise are required.1 \nNational  NGO  services  to  support  social  mobilization  will  be  engaged  from  among  qualified \nNGOs in Nepal. \n \nThe  services  to  be  provided  include  (i)  project  management,  including  subproject \n4. \nselection,  budget  and  works  planning,  procurement,  administration,  and  monitoring  and \nreporting;  (ii)  institutional  capacity  building  and  training  in  all  administrative  and  technical \naspects  of  the  project  approaches;  (iii)  social  mobilization  and  social  development;  (iv) \nparticipatory  planning;  (v)  aspects  of  technical  engineering  for  the  LEP  approach;  (vi) \n\n                                                 \n1 If suitably qualified domestic consultants are available, they may be substituted for international consultants. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8           43 \n\n \n\ninitial  environmental  examination \nenvironmental  management  and  compliance  with \nrecommendations  and  safeguards;  (vii)  impact  evaluation  of  project  benefits  identified  through \nthe  project  performance  and  monitoring  system;  and  (viii)  monitoring  of  critical  components  of \nsite implementation, including works quality and social safeguards.

District-level  services \nare  to  provide  social  and  technical  inputs  for  awareness  raising,  participation,  mobilization  of \nbeneficiaries,  and  social  development;  and  for  planning,  engineering  design,  construction \nsupervision,  measurement,  and  quality  control  of  subprojects  and  supplementary  investments. \nEach  DTO  will  contract  with  a  domestic  engineering  consulting  firm  and  a  local  NGO  to  help \nprovide these services.  \n \nThe  detailed  arrangements  for  engagement  of  district-level  services  will  be  finalized  at \n6. \nthe  start  of  implementation  and  set  out  in  the  project  procedures  manual.  DOLIDAR,  with  the \nassistance of the central project implementation consultant, will prepare and update a register of \ndomestic consulting firms that have prequalified to provide the engineering services after being \ntrained  in  the  LEP  approach.  DTOs  will  invite  registered  firms  to  bid  to  provide  the  services, \nunder  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  national-level  NGO  and  the  central  project \nimplementation consultant will help DOLIDAR identify, for each district, a shortlist of local NGOs \ncapable  of  providing  social  services  to  the  DTO.  Where  possible  each  DTO  will  contract  with \none  qualified  local  NGO  on  the  basis  of  competitive  procedures.  Where  qualified  local  NGOs \nare scarce, direct selection may be applied with prior ADB approval. \n \n7. \nProcedures  to  engage  national  and  local  NGO  services  may  be  modified  for  some \ndistricts where partnership or cofinancing arrangements are agreed on with other projects and \nexternal funding agencies to allow direct selection. The approach will allow the Project to exploit \nthe  existing  social  mobilization  capacities  developed  under  partner  programs.  For  competitive \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f44\n\n           Appendix 8 \n\nselection of the national and local NGOs, priority must be given to their capability and capacity \nto undertake the tasks assigned.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9          45           \n\nTERMS OF REFERENCE FOR INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT  \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nBackground \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nThe Department for Local Infrastructure Development and Agricultural Roads (DOLIDAR) \nwas  conceived  as  a  small  agency  to  provide  central  coordination,  guidance,  regulation,  and \nmanagement  of  the  sector,  with  the  district  development  committees  (DDCs)  supported  by  the \ndistrict technical offices (DTOs), and the village development committees, directly responsible for \nrural infrastructure planning, implementation, and maintenance. When DOLIDAR was established, \nconfusion as to the nature of the organization required resulted in overlapping of functions such as \nplanning,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  with  those  of  the  parent  Ministry  of  Local  Development \n(MLD).  As  the  Government  streamlines  the  public  sector,  however,  civil  service  numbers  have \nbeen  controlled  and  reduced.  The  full  staffing  complement  allocated  to  DOLIDAR  has,  as  yet, \nnever been assigned, either at the center or in the districts (for example, some districts still lack a \ndistrict engineer).  \n \n2. \nPrivate sector support provided to the public sector for rural infrastructure development is \nweak. Despite their involvement in numerous projects, the many local consulting firms are passive \nin providing services, lacking attention to quality, professionalism, and performance management. \nPrivate  sector  skills  in  social  mobilization  are  weak,  and  most  of  the  numerous  local  and  many \nnational nongovernment organizations (NGOs) produce substandard output. \n \n3. \nDOLIDAR  faces  institutional  constraints  and  weaknesses  in  meeting  the  demands  on  it, \nwith  the  increasing  priority  given  to  rural  infrastructure.  Shortage  of  staff,  vagueness  about \nfunctions,  and  the  uncertainty  of  incomplete  decentralization  are  manifested  in,  for  example,  (i) \nlimited  monitoring  implementation,  (ii)  difficulties  in  meeting  the  differing  needs  of  development \npartners  and  in  assuming  full  government  management  authority  and  coordination  of  rural \ninfrastructure investment programs, (iii) slow progress in generating district transport master plans \n(DTMPs)  for  all  districts,  and  (iv)  limited  adoption  by  local  government authorities of sustainable \nrural road maintenance practices or coordination of road network maintenance priorities.  \n \nDecentralization  has  provided  an  additional  opportunity  for  DOLIDAR  to  evolve  as  a \n4. \nmodern, regulatory government institution, providing direction to DDCs in planning and to DTOs in \nproject implementation. So far, the process is incomplete, and the lack of revised local government \nstaffing  policies  and  fiscal  systems  have  particularly  constrained  progress.  Nonetheless, \ndecentralization  involves  major  restructuring  of  the  sector  and  the  framework  within  which \nDOLIDAR must evolve. \n \n5. \nA national policy and strategy on local infrastructure development is being finalized. Many \nelements  of  the  previous  1997  strategy  have  either  been  completed  or  superseded,  leaving \nDOLIDAR without a guiding policy. Institutional development technical assistance (TA), therefore, \ncan help DOLIDAR develop its new role and adopt and implement the revised policy. \n \nThe  policy  was  drafted  in  light  of  the  1999  legislation  to  promote  decentralization  in \n6. \nmanaging public resources, and considers the phased devolution of local infrastructure ownership \nto local bodies. The policy also supports the Tenth Five-Year Plan and Poverty Reduction Strategy \nPaper, which is based on poverty reduction; and the Agriculture Perspective Plan, which promotes \nagriculture as the basis of rural economic development. The policy broadens the mandate for rural \ninfrastructure  to  include  all  forms  of  infrastructure,  whereas  the  1997  national  strategy  was \nconcerned mainly with roads, and emphasizes technical audits to control public works quality. The \n\n \n\n\f46\n\n          Appendix 9 \n\nStrategy for the Technical Assistance  \n\npolicy may require a partial or total restructuring of DOLIDAR, depending on how MLD implements \nthe accompanying new strategy. \n \nB. \n \n7. \nThe  objectives  of  the  TA  are  to  (i)  strengthen  DOLIDAR\u2019s  capacity  and  effectiveness  in \nmanaging implementation of the national policy and strategy for local infrastructure development; \nand (ii) improve procedures and practices for various aspects of rural infrastructure management, \nparticularly rural road maintenance in a changing environment. This support is needed to enable \nDOLIDAR to reorient its role to better fulfill its mandate. While the organization must have enough \nwell-qualified and experienced staff, the numbers must be kept within strict limits, and additional \nservices  procured  by  contracting  out  many  activities  to  the  private  sector  while  maintaining \nmanagement  control.  The  current  high  level  of  local  infrastructure  development  is  certain  to  be \nreduced,  particularly  as  the  capacity  to  maintain roads becomes saturated and demand for new \nroutes  is  satisfied.  The  private  sector  has  the  flexibility  to  provide  services  without  risking \ndevelopment of too large and unsustainable a regulating department. \n \n8. \nThe TA will concentrate on supporting DOLIDAR to undertake sector-wide reviews of the \nmajor issues and constraints related to effective rural infrastructure development, and of the status \nand  expected  contribution  of  initiatives  already  under  way  or  planned,  to  address  these \nconstraints.  Conflicts  to  be  resolved,  critical  gaps  in  capacities,  and  options  for  addressing  key \nissues  will  be  analyzed  in  detail.  The  TA  will  liaise  closely  with  other  institutional  strengthening \ninitiatives to increase DOLIDAR\u2019s capacity to coordinate institutional strengthening initiatives, and \nto internalize lessons learned from them. \n \n9. \nIf DOLIDAR is to regulate successfully and guide DDCs and DTOs, then its staff must be \nequipped with the skills to pass information on to district colleagues and to convince them of the \nneed to comply with procedures accurately and on time. Traditional top-down, centrally led civil-\nservice  approaches  have  not  always  been  effective.  The  strategy  adopted  is,  therefore,  to \nstrengthen individual staff members as facilitators by training the trainers. \n \n10. \nAlthough there is an extensive scope of work that would benefit from the TA (paras. 20-\n21), other initiatives are ongoing, so the terms of reference must be confirmed when the TA starts. \nIt will, therefore, be initiated through a workshop that uses the TA potential scope as the basis for \na  revised  series  of  activities  and  outputs  that  take  account  of  ongoing  complementary  work  by \nDOLIDAR and other agencies and projects. The workshop will be organized once the Cabinet has \napproved the national policy for local infrastructure development, and MLD has finalized how it will \nimplement the national strategy for local infrastructure development, including any organizational \nchanges. Invitees and resource persons at the workshop will include stakeholders within MLD and \nDOLIDAR,  and  representatives  from  all  external  funding  agency-supported  programs  with \nelements of institutional development, to ensure that the TA complements other initiatives. \n \nC. \n \nThe  TA  scope  is  to  be  defined  at  a  workshop  that  will  take  into  account  the  mode  of \n11. \nimplementation of the new national strategy, and other ongoing sectoral support initiatives when \nthe  TA  starts.  The  TA\u2019s  main  outputs  are  (i)  establishment  of  best-practice  procedures,  (ii)  a \nstructure of service provision, and (iii) a long-term implementation plan. \n \n12. \nEstablishment  of  Best-Practice  Procedures.  The  TA  will  use  the  preparation,  and \nextensive  review  of,  working  papers  on  a  range  of  issues  to  form  the  basis  for  furthering  the \n\nScope of the Technical Assistance \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9          47           \n\nsector\u2019s  aims  as  laid  out  in  the  National  Policy  on  Local  Infrastructure  Development  and  its \naccompanying  strategy.  The  TA  will  help  DOLIDAR  prepare  a  road  map  for  the  time-bound \nimplementation of the strategy to which the TA is committed, thus drawing together the experience \nof DOLIDAR\u2019s development partners and establishing best practices. The working papers will lead \nto the development of systems that can be adopted by the district agencies in accordance with the \nGovernment\u2019s  Local  Body  Financial  Administration  Regulations.  While  these working papers will \nbe  interim  outputs,  the  final  output  will  be  approved  best-practice  procedures  usable  by  local \ngovernment  and  project  partners.  Likely  technical  topics  under  the  TA  output  include  (i) \nprioritization  of  budget  allocations  for  rural  road  maintenance,  (ii)  social  development  and \nmobilization practices, (iii) impact evaluation, and (iv) outsourcing of services. \n \n13. \nStructure  of  Service  Provision.  An  agreed-on  organizational  structure  and  operational \nprocedures for DOLIDAR will be another output, based on a clear division of regulatory activities \nwith MLD, and definition of the roles and functions for each departmental unit. Critical operational \nprocedures include (i) the areas for, and methods of, extensive contracting-out of services to the \nprivate  sector;  (ii)  arrangements  for  delivery  of  capacity-building  services  to,  and  monitoring  of, \nlocal  government  bodies;  and  (iii)  the  mechanism  for  coordination  and  direction  of  development \npartner support.  \n \n14. \nLong-Term  Implementation  Plan.  The  requirements  and  a  program  for  further \ninstitutional development of DOLIDAR will be defined and agreed upon as the third main output. \nThis  will  aim  to  support  implementation  of the new national strategy and may include (i) a long-\nterm  sectoral  training  and  human  resource  development  strategy  (with  accompanying  financing \nplan),  for  central  and  local  levels;  (ii)  measures  to  improve  the  performance  of  the  private  and \nNGO sectors, enhance their skills, and develop a mature approach to quality and professionalism; \nand (iii) key areas for external funding agency support.  \n \nD. \n \n15. \nDOLIDAR  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  with  a  separate  unit  established  to  house  and \nexecute  the TA work. A full-time senior divisional engineer will head this unit, assisted by a full-\ntime  engineer  and  a  clerical  secretary.  The  International  Labour  Organization  will  provide  an \nexperienced international specialist in rural infrastructure institutions to act as the coordinator. The \ninternational specialist will recruit individual domestic consultants as needed to provide services in \ntechnical fields such as road maintenance planning, social development, environmental appraisal, \nplanning  and  monitoring,  and  institutional  and  human  resources  development.  A  total  of  10 \nperson-months of international and 28 person-months of local consultants\u2019 inputs are anticipated. \nThe work will be undertaken intermittently over 3 years, starting after the national policy for local \ninfrastructure development is finalized, and implementation of the policy\u2019s institutional provisions, \nincluding  staffing,  has  been  agreed  upon.  This  should  take  place  by  the  end  of  2004.  The  TA \nwould, therefore, begin about January 2005 and terminate about December 2007. \n \n16. \nThe  director  general  of  DOLIDAR  will  chair  a  coordination  group  to  assist  the  TA  in  its \nwork, review outputs, and seek approval of guidelines and procedures. This group will meet every \nthree months throughout the TA period. Other members will include the deputy director general of \nDOLIDAR as member secretary, and representatives of appropriate sections in MLD, particularly \nin planning, and monitoring and evaluation. The TA unit head and the international coordinator will \nbe observers. \n \n17. \nDOLIDAR will provide and maintain a suitable, fully furnished office space with adequate \ncommunications (two telephone lines). The TA budget will cover the purchase of office equipment \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\n\f48\n\n          Appendix 9 \n\n(photocopier, computers, printers, and accessories). One vehicle will also be rented from the TA \nbudget,  and  DOLIDAR  will  provide  additional  transport  for  the  counterpart  staff  and  for  journeys \ninto the field.  \n \nThe International Labour Organization will select and engage the international advisor and \n18. \ndomestic consultants in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by ADB and its \nBorrowers  and  other  arrangements  on  the  selection  and  use  of  domestic  consultants.  One \ninternational  and  approximately  five  domestic  consultants  will  be  recruited  as  individuals.  The \noutline terms of reference of the consultants are in paras. 20-21. Detailed terms of reference are in \na supplementary appendix. \n \nE. \n \n19. \nThe total cost is estimated at $500,000 equivalent. The Government has requested ADB to \nfinance  $400,000  equivalent,  covering  all  the  foreign  exchange  costs  ($270,000  equivalent)  and \npart  of  the  local  costs.  These  will  be  funded  by  ADB  on  a  grant  basis  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding \nprogram. The proposed government contribution of $100,000 equivalent will cover office and staff \ncosts, field transport, and facilities for seminars and training.

The  subjects  that  require  attention  include  (i)  criteria  for  the \nallocation  of  centrally  and  locally  managed  investment  resources,  based  on  geographical  and \ndevelopmental  priorities  for  poverty  reduction;  (ii)  social  appraisal,  mobilization,  and  monitoring \nprocedures  related  to  rural  infrastructure  development,  including  contracting-out  of  services  in \nthese  areas  to  local  institutions;  (iii)  revision  and  refinement  of  work  norms  for  construction \nactivities  carried  out  using  the  labor-based,  environmentally  friendly,  and  participatory  (LEP) \napproach, based on field analysis, so that they are cost-efficient and equitable; (iv) budgeting and \nimplementation  procedures  for  construction  works  that  incorporate  the  requirement  for  intensive \non-site  supervision  under  the  LEP  approach;  (v)  refinement  of  DTMP  preparation  in  light  of \nexperience  and  of  lessons  from  pilot  applications  of  the  integrated  rural  accessibility  planning \nmethodology, including consideration of the use of a subregional or cluster approach to interdistrict \nintegrated  planning;  (vi)  environmental  appraisal,  mitigation,  and  monitoring  procedures;  (vii) \nproject monitoring and impact evaluation; (viii) fair and equitable compensation for acquisition of \nland  and  other  assets,  and  its  financing;  (ix)  use  of  geographical  information  systems  as  a \nplanning tool, particularly for maintenance, and to monitor rural infrastructure development; and (x) \nmanagement of data for management information systems and planning, at the district and central \nlevels.  \n \n21. \nThe  TA  consultant  will  also  help  DOLIDAR  instill  a  maintenance  culture  among  local \ngovernment bodies, and establish effective, planned rural road maintenance practices. TA tasks \nmight include (i) helping DOLIDAR use its geographic information system capability to establish a \ndatabase of detailed district-by-district inventories of roads and their condition, as a basis for the \nrational national planning and monitoring of rural road maintenance (closely coordinated with other \ngeographic information system initiatives in DOLIDAR); (ii) digital mapping of the existing network \nusing  information  from  DTMPs  and  maps  such  as  those  produced  under  the  Bridge  Building  at \nLocal Level Project, to be used as a source of maintenance planning information for the districts; \n(iii)  drafting  of  procedures  for  the  classification,  inventory,  and  annual  survey  of  rural  road \nconditions; (iv) trial use of these procedures in project-supported or other interested districts; (v) \nfinalization of the procedures and definition of a training program for DDCs; (vi) initial support to \nproject  DDCs  and  DOLIDAR  in  using  the  database  to  plan  and  coordinate  maintenance \ninterventions; (vii) revision and improvement of the National Plan for Rural Road Maintenance, on \nthe basis of international best practice, lessons from experience, and implications of the new Road \nFund. The plan should include a forward program to establish rural road maintenance capacity in \nDDCs nationwide.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50\n\n         Appendix 10 \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \n\nIntroduction \n\nA. \n \n1. \nThe beneficiaries in the Ratnechaur-Bhakimli village road subproject illustrate the Project\u2019s \npoverty  focus.  Disadvantaged  groups  compose  24%  of  households.  Females  head  26%  of \nhouseholds,  and  63%  of  households  have  sent  income-earning  members  to  work  away  from \nhome.  Most  households  (76%)  depend  on  agriculture  for  their  livelihoods.  On  average, \nhouseholds  can  grow  food  sufficient  to  last  only  7.8  months  a  year.  All  agricultural  daily-wage \nworkers  were  from  the  disadvantaged  castes  and  have  little  or  no  land  to  grow  food.  The \ndisadvantaged castes have the smallest average plot sizes and the lowest food security at around \n5.0-6.5 months of the year. Only three households (1% of project-affected families) can produce \nsufficient  food  to  feed  their  households  year  round,  and  no  other  household  can  feed  itself  for \nmore than 8.5 months. The average income per capita of the sample households is NRs12,957, \ncompared  to  the  national  average  income  per  capita  poverty  level  of  NRs13,065  (national  living \nstandard survey figures for poverty in Nepal in 1996, factored to 2004 levels). Household income \nin  the  survey  households  is  boosted  by  pensions  and  remittances,  without  which  these \nhouseholds would be even poorer.  \n \n2. \nThe Project will improve physical access to economic opportunities and social services. \nThe  extension  into  rural  areas  of  a  more  efficient  and  sustainable  transport  network  is  an \nessential  starting  point  and  a  prerequisite  for socioeconomic development. About 52% of total \nproject costs will be allocated to construction of new, and rehabilitation of existing, rural roads to \nmotorable  standard;  improvement  of  main  trails;  and  construction  of  trail  bridges.  The \nsupplementary  investments  in  small,  community  physical  infrastructure  schemes  (about  9%  of \ntotal costs) within the vicinity of the transport infrastructure subprojects will increase the impact \nof the road and trail investments. \n \nThe  Project  will  emphasize  the  critically  important  social  aspects  of  rural  infrastructure \n3. \ndevelopment. First, the Project will give priority to measures to ensure participation of the poor \nand  disadvantaged  in  planning  and  implementation  so  that  they  benefit  directly  from  the \ninvestments  in  improved  physical  access.  Second,  the  Project  will  promote  the  formation  of \nsavings  groups  and  initiation  of  other  development  activities  within  the  influence  areas  of  the \ninfrastructure  investments,  enabling  communities  to  respond  to  the  economic  and  social \nopportunities  offered  by  improved  access,  and  restore  incomes  affected  by  the  conflict.  Third, \nthe  Project  aims  to  empower  the  poor  and  disadvantaged  for  participation  in  development \nactivities. \n \n4. \nThe  Project  will  address  capacity-building  needs  in  the  Government,  private  sector, \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), and community institutions in the districts. This effort is \nintended  to  (i)  ensure  proper,  cost-effective,  and  efficient use of project funds, and counteract \nattempts  to  divert  benefits  through  the  patronage  and  influence  of  local  elites;  (ii)  establish \nplanned maintenance of infrastructure investments so that benefits are sustained over the long \nterm;  and  (iii)  contribute  to  more  transparent  and  accountable,  and  better  integrated,  pro-poor \nlocal management of rural development. \n \nB. \n \n\nEconomic Evaluation \n\n1. \n\nApproach and Methodology \n\nThe  economic  analysis  does  not  attempt  to  capture  all  the  expected  benefits  and \n\n \n5. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10          51            \n\nimpacts.  It  focuses  on  measuring  the  costs  and  benefits  of  providing  improved  rural  transport \ninfrastructure. Because the Project applies a process approach, the rural transport infrastructure \nsubprojects  were  not  identified  during  project  preparation.  However,  a  sample  of  five  typical \npossible subprojects were identified for comprehensive technical, environmental, economic, and \nsocial feasibility study to (i) appraise the viability of the different types of transport infrastructure \nsubproject  envisaged,  and  (ii)  demonstrate  how  they  will  be  prepared  and  appraised  during \nproject implementation. The five sample subprojects were selected to cover the range of types \nof  rural  transport  infrastructure  investment to be made by the Project. They reflect priorities in \nthe  project  districts,  and are geographically distributed across the three district clusters. Table \nA10.1 reports the basic information and data on these five subprojects. \n \n\nTable A10.1: Basic Data for Subprojects \n\nDistrict \n\nSubproject \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRamechhap  Tilpung-Dhobi Road \n\n14 km \n\nin area of \nInfluence \n37,132 \n\nHHs \n\n6,876 \n\nFarm Size  Construction   Maintenance\nCost  \n(ha per HH)\n($\u2019000) \n203 \n\nCost \n($\u2019000/year) \n\n0.99 \n\n13.3 \n\n  \nLength Population Number of\n\nBaglung \n\nMyagdi \n\nBaitadi \n\nDarchula \n\nRehabilitation \nBadhighat Khola New \nTrail Bridge \nRatnechaur-Bhakimli \nNew Village Road \nBaitadi-Sera Village \nRoad Rehabilitation \nKhalang-Byas Main \nTrail Improvement \n\n70 m \nspan \n19 km \n\n18,101 \n\n3,089 \n\n10,375 \n\n1,572 \n\n12 km \n\n13,349 \n\n2,472 \n\n40 km \n\n12,484 \n\n2,116 \n\n0.75 \n\n0.72 \n\n0.72 \n\n0.67 \n\n12 \n\n577 \n\n169 \n\n40 \n\n0.1 \n\n18.1 \n\n11.4 \n\n4.0 \n\nha = hectare, HH = household, km = kilometers, m = meters. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n6. \nEconomic Analysis of Projects. The analytical framework includes the following: \n \n\nThe  analysis  on  the  subprojects  was  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe economic life of the Project is assumed to be 20 years. Sensitivity analyses of \nthe risk of a shorter economic life expectancy have been conducted. \nA world price numeraire is used, with Nepal rupees as the unit of account with a \nconstant price year of 2003. The exchange rate applied is $1.00 = NRs76, the rate \nat loan fact-finding. \nAll  prices,  benefits,  and  costs  were  adjusted  to  2003  constant  values  using  (a)  a \ngross domestic product deflator for all local currency costs and benefits, and (b) the \nG-5 manufacturer\u2019s unit value index for all foreign exchange.  \nA discount rate of 12% was used to calculate the net present value (NPV) and also \nas a cut off point for the economic internal rate of return (EIRR). \nValued  in  2003  constant  prices,  the  project  benefits  and  costs  in  financial  prices \nwere adjusted to economic prices by deducting taxes and duties, and by applying \nan item-specific conversion factor (CF) to non-traded local currency costs. \nSpecific CFs for various project inputs and outputs are derived based on estimated \nshares  of  foreign  exchange  and  labor.  Some  key  CFs  include  0.66  for  vehicles; \n0.72 for porterage cost; 0.7 for local manufactures and extracted materials; 0.7 for \nall road, trail, and bridge maintenance; and 0.93 as the standard CF. \nA shadow wage rate of 0.87 is estimated and applied to unskilled labor to reflect \nun- and underemployment in the rural project area. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f52\n\n         Appendix 10 \n\n2. \n\nQuantified Benefits \n\n \n7. \nProducer and consumer surpluses have increased due to improved access. The balance \nbetween the two types of benefits varies according to the type of improvement appraised. For \nthe economic evaluation, double counting of benefits has been avoided by excluding agricultural \nitems  from  generated  freight  traffic.  Only  nonagricultural  generated freight traffic is included in \nthe calculation of consumer surplus benefits. \n \nProducer Surplus Benefits. Agricultural households will adjust their production activities \n8. \nin  response  to  decreased  access  costs  due  to  improved  transport  infrastructure.  The  key \nassumptions are that farmers will increase their use of agricultural inputs; extend their cultivated \narea; and switch some of their production from low-value cereals to high-value fruits, vegetables, \nand  pulses.  Marketing  costs  will  decrease  due  to  lower  transport  costs.  The  net  benefit  is  the \nchange in total return on production of the different crops.  \n \nConsumer  Surplus  Benefits.  The  key  assumptions  are  that  (i)  vehicle  operating  costs \n9. \n(VOC) for all nonmotorized and motorized transport modes will decrease, (and time will be saved) \nafter access improvement; (ii) motorable roads will see a partial shift from nonmotorized to lower-\ncost motorized modes; and (iii) lower transport costs will generate an increase in passenger and \ngoods movement. The benefits are the savings in VOCs for normal traffic, from modal shift, and \nfor generated traffic, excluding agricultural items. \n \n10. \n \n\nThe appraised economic benefits are summarized in Table A10.2. \n\nTable A10.2: Summary Economic Benefits Net Present Value for Subprojects \n\nDistrict \n\nSubproject \n\n \n\nConsumer Surplus  \n($\u2019000) \n  Normal Traffic  Generated Traffic\n\nProducer Surplus  \n($\u2019000) \n \n\n  \n\n17 \n\n322 \n\n414 \n\n247 \n\nRamechhap  Tilpung-Dhobi Road \n\n1,153 \n\nBaglung \n\nMyagdi \n\nBaitadi \n\nDarchula \n\nRehabilitation \nBadhighat Khola New \nTrail Bridge \nRatnechaur-Bhakimli \nNew Village Road \nBaitadi-Sera Village \nRoad Rehabilitation \nKhalang-Byas Main Trail \nImprovement \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n3. \n\nNonquantifiable Benefits \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n9,790 \n\n3 \n\n3,712 \n\n3,017 \n\n99 \n\n19,808 \n\n503 \n\n21,273 \n\n5,179 \n\n6,661 \n\n \n11. \nBetter mobility for rural people will increase the use of health and education facilities, use \nof  other  government  services,  and  access  to  information.  The  reduction  in  travel  and  transport \ncosts  and  difficulty  is  expected  to  facilitate  extensive  provision  of  high-quality  services  in  rural \nareas  by  the  Government  and  NGOs.  Supplementary  investments  in  community  physical \ninfrastructure  schemes  will  further  increase  use  of  health,  education,  and  social  facilities.  For \nexample,  new  or  rehabilitated  safe  drinking  water  supplies  in  the  communities  will  have  a \nsignificant  impact  on  the  health  status  of  the  users  and,  hence,  on  their  capacity  to  work  and \nimprove  their  livelihoods.  The  community  development  component  will  contribute  to  reduced \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10          53            \n\ntransaction costs for project beneficiaries by increasing their awareness of and access to essential \nservices. \n \n12. \nOne significant project benefit is job creation. Without the Project, rural unemployment is \nhigh, and heightened by the conflict. Most households rely on income from daily agricultural work. \nBusiness  and  trading  activities  are  few  because  of  lack  of  access  and  difficult  mobility.  Family \nmembers  run  local  shops  and  teahouses,  and  few  jobs  exist  for  outsiders.  Project  construction \nwork in building groups (BGs) will offer significant opportunities to local people. Reserving jobs in \nroad BGs for those displaced by land acquisition for a road will also restore their income. Project \nimplementation and road maintenance will increase the incomes of the poor and disadvantaged, \nincluding women, by giving them paid jobs during the agricultural off-season. The impacts of this \nadditional  income  on  the  livelihoods  of  the  beneficiary  households  are  expected  to  include \nreduced indebtedness, increased food security and improved health, and possibly a higher level of \nchildren\u2019s school attendance. \n \n13. \nIn addition to improved welfare, the Project will raise beneficiaries\u2019 awareness. The BGs \nare designed to avoid domination by local elites so that the poor benefit from the Project. The \nBGs  will  receive  technical  training  in  addition  to  useful  life  skills  such  as  training  in  functional \nliteracy, health, hygiene and nutrition, promotion of child welfare, and how to diversify incomes \nand livelihoods. The BGs will lead to greater social cohesion and organized construction works. \nThe  project  social  mobilizers  will  also  implement  savings  schemes  in  collaboration  with  group \nleaders for BG laborers. They will save 20% of their earnings, and thus learn to manage their \nsavings and improve their living conditions. Transforming the BG into a savings group will allow \nbeneficiaries to translate short-term benefits from employment on project works into sustainable \nimpacts  on  livelihoods  through  capital  formation  and  investment  in  small-scale  income-\ngenerating  activities.  The  Project  will  help  savings  groups  access  microfinance  to  invest  in \nincome-generating  enterprises.  The  Project  will \ninitiate  other  development  activities \n(supplementary  livelihood  investments)  within  the  influence  areas  of  the  infrastructure \ninvestments,  so  that  local  communities  are  better  able  to  respond  to  the  economic  and  social \nopportunities  offered  by  improved  access.  The  supplementary  investments  present  another \nopportunity  to  target  project  interventions  to  benefit  the  poor  and  disadvantaged,  and  families \naffected by the conflict, unlike block grant schemes, which often benefit local elites.  \n \n14. \nThe benefits from direct employment of local poor people on construction works\u2014from \ncapacity building, improvements in livelihoods through social mobilization, and increased use of \nhealth and educational services\u2014are expected to be significant but have not been included in \nthe economic evaluation because they are difficult to quantify. \n \n\n4. \n\nCosts \n\n \nTable  A10.1  also  contains  the  appraised  construction  and  maintenance  costs  of  the \n15. \nsubprojects. In the economic analysis, construction costs have been broken down by input type, \nincluding  labor  (skilled  and  unskilled),  tools,  materials,  and  equipment,  and  converted  from \nfinancial to economic values. Provision has been made for survey and design, supervision, and \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs.  The  compensation  on  land  and  resettlement  is  about \n7%  of  civil  work  investment  for  new  construction,  and  about  3%  of  civil  work  investment  for \nrehabilitation.  Planned  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  costs  have  been  annualized,  at \nfinancial  values  of  $950  per  kilometer  (km)  per  year  for  roads,  and  $100  for  the  trails.  These \ncosts have been converted to economic values. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f54\n\n         Appendix 10 \n\n5. \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n\n \n16. \nAppraised  at  a  12%  discount  rate,  the  main  base-case  results  are  summarized  in  Table \nA10.3.  All  the  subprojects  have  EIRRs  higher  than  12%,  positive  NPVs,  and  benefit-cost  (BC) \nratios greater than 1. The district road rehabilitation and main trail improvement subprojects show \nvery  robust  economic  viability,  with  EIRRs  greater  than  30%.  The  remaining  three  subprojects \nhave rates of return around 13%, close to the limit of viability. \n \n\nTable A10.3: Subproject Appraisal Results \n\n \n\n \nDistrict \n\nSubproject \n\n \n\nNPV/Cost \n \n1.34 \n0.02 \n0.07 \n0.03 \n1.16 \n\nEIRR \n(%) \n37.4 \n12.5 \n13.1 \n12.5 \n31.2 \n\nNPV  \n(NRs million)\n20.6 \n0.02 \n2.91 \n0.41 \n3.50 \n\nBC \nRatio \n3.01 \n1.04 \n1.07 \n1.03 \n2.38 \n\nTilpung-Dhobi District Road Rehabilitation \nBadhighat Khola New Trail Bridge \nRatnechaur-Bhakimli New Village Road \nBaitadi-Sera Village Road Rehabilitation \nKhalang-Byas Main Trail Improvement \n\nRamechhap \nBaglung \nMyagdi \nBaitadi \nDarchula \nBC = benefit cost, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present values, NRs = Nepalese rupees. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n17. \nThe  base-case  results  indicate  that  the  project  approach  of  investment  in  rural  transport \ninfrastructure  subprojects  identified  and  prioritized  through  a  local  participatory  process  will \ngenerate  an  economically  viable  rate  of  return.  The  subprojects  appraised  were  selected  from \nlonger  lists  of  proposals  submitted  by  the  districts,  to  ensure  a  representative  sample  of  the \ndifferent  types  of  rural  transport  infrastructure  investment.  The  lower  rate  of  economic  return  to \nsome  of  the  subprojects  is  to  be  expected  given  the  project  focus  on  poor  areas  with  limited \nresources, and should be seen in the context that transport infrastructure subprojects, and other \nproject components, will generate significant, but not easily quantifiable, additional benefits. \n \n\n6. \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\n \n18. \nSensitivity  analysis  was  conducted  to  test  the  significance  of  the  benefit  and  cost \nassumptions.  Table  A10.4  shows  the  test  results  on  the  basis  of  a  20%  increase  in  costs,  the \nsame reduction in benefits, and the two combined. \n\nTable A10.4: Sensitivity Analysis on Benefits and Costs \n\nDistrict \n\nSubproject \n\nSensitivity Test on EIRR \n\n \n\nRamechhap  Tilpung-Dhobi District Road Rehabilitation \nBaglung \nMyagdi \nBaitadi \nDarchula \n EIRR = economic internal rate of return. \n Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nBadhighat Khola New Trail Bridge \nRatnechaur-Bhakimli New Village Road \nBaitadi-Sera Village Road Rehabilitation \nKhalang-Byas Main Trail Improvement \n\nCost Increase \n20% \n(%) \n \n\nBenefit \nDecrease 20% \n(%) \n \n\nCost Increase 20% \n+Benefit Decrease 20%\n(%) \n \n\n32.9 \n10.3 \n11.4 \n10.0 \n26.0 \n\n31.8 \n9.8 \n10.8 \n9.3 \n25.0 \n\n27.1 \n7.6 \n8.2 \n6.3 \n20.8 \n\n \n19. \nThe  tests  indicate  that  viability  is  more  sensitive  to  a  reduction  in  benefits  than  to  an \nincrease in costs. The analysis is extended further by more detailed examination of the sensitivity \n\n  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10          55            \n\nof the results to changes in individual assumptions. The results of changes in two key variables, \nproduction response, and maintenance costs are in Table A10.5. \n \n20. \nAs summarized in Table A10.2, for motorized road investments most benefits will be from \nproducer surplus. The sensitivity tests summarized in Table A10.5 show that if producer surplus \ndoes not materialize, the economic viability of some subprojects will be marginal. \n\nTable A10.5: Sensitivity Analysis on Producer Surplus and Operation and Maintenance \n\n  \n\nDistrict \n\nSubproject \n\n \n\nRamechhap  Tilpung-Dhobi District Road Rehabilitation \nBaglung \nMyagdi \nBaitadi \nDarchula \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nBadhighat Khola New Trail Bridge \nRatnechaur-Bhakimli New Village Road \nBaitadi-Sera Village Road Rehabilitation \nKhalang-Byas Main Trail Improvement \n\nSensitivity Test on EIRR \n\nProducer Surplus \nDecrease 50% \n(%) \n\nMaintenance \ncosts double \n(%) \n\nUnderperformance of \nmaintenance and 8-\nyear life of benefits \n(%) \n \n\n \n\n27.4 \n5.5 \n6.9 \n7.4 \n16.8 \n\n \n\n33.8 \n11.4 \n10.2 \n6.1 \n26.9 \n\n36.4 \n5.5 \n5.6 \n6.8 \n29.7 \n\n \n21. \nTimely maintenance appears to be critical for project benefits and subproject sustainability. \nThe  sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  maintenance  has  a  large  impact  on  subprojects\u2019  economic \nperformance  if  either  (i)  required  maintenance  costs  are  found  to  be  much  higher  than  the \nappraisal  estimate,  or  (ii)  required  maintenance  is  not  performed  and  the  economic  life  of  the \nsubproject is shortened. In the first case, maintenance costs are assumed to double, and in the \nsecond  case,  only  half  of  the  required  maintenance  costs  are  assumed  spent  and  that  project \nbenefits  last  for  only  8  years.  The  test  indicates  the  importance  of  obtaining  good  estimates  of \nmaintenance  requirements,  and  the  need  for  regular  routine  maintenance  to  ensure  subproject \nviability and sustainability. \n \nThe  three  subprojects  with  base-case  EIRRs  close  to  12%  cease  to  be  viable  when  the \n22. \nsensitivity  tests  are  applied,  but  care  has  been  taken  to  (i)  prepare  realistic  estimates  of  the \ninvestment  and  maintenance  costs  for  the  base  case;  and  (ii)  make  conservative  assumptions \nabout benefits from producer and consumer responses. \n \n\n7. \n\nDistribution of Benefits \n\n \n23. \nThe  distribution  analysis  summarized  in  Table  A10.6  shows  that  a  large  portion  of  the \neconomic benefits will go to the poor. Estimating the share of the poor in beneficiary groups as \n90%  of  unskilled  labor,  30%  of  skilled  labor,  60%  of  farmers,  0%  of  vehicle  owners,  60%  of \npassengers  (about  equal  to  the  poor\u2019s  representation  in  the  population),  and  10%  of \ngovernment  (approximately  equal  to  the  poor\u2019s  share  in  gross  domestic  product),  the  poverty \nimpact  ratio  is  calculated  as  the  economic  benefits  to  the  poor  as  a  proportion  of  total  net \neconomic benefits. \n \n24. \nThe direct beneficiaries will be those living within the influence areas of the rural transport \ninfrastructure subprojects. A preliminary assessment of the five sample subprojects indicates that \n500,000\u2013700,000  people  will  benefit  directly,  which  is  about  one  third  to  one  half  of  the  total \npopulation in the project districts. In all cases more than 56% of the beneficiaries would be poor, \nwith a higher proportion living in villages where food supply is insecure. \n\n \n\n\f56\n\n         Appendix 10 \n\n25. \nDepending  upon  the  type  of  subproject,  65\u201370%  of  the  cost  of  civil  works  will  be  for \nunskilled laborers, who are mostly landless or renting land. The Project is expected to inject over \n$10 million directly into the participating districts\u2019 economies. The feasibility study of the proposed \nrural  road  in  Myagdi  shows  that  construction  jobs  will  increase  the  incomes  of  typical  poor \nhouseholds by 20-25% over 3 years. \n\nTable A10.6: Summary of Distribution Analysis Results \n(NPVs in NRs\u2019000 at 12% discount rate) \n\n  \n\nItem \n\nNet Economic Effects \nEconomic Benefits to the Poor \nPoverty impact ratio \n\nNet Economic Effects \nEconomic Benefits to the Poor \nPoverty impact ratio \n\nNet Economic Effects \nEconomic Benefits to the Poor \nPoverty impact ratio \n\nNet Economic Effects \nEconomic Benefits to the Poor \nPoverty impact ratio \n\nUnskilled \nLabor \n\nSkilled \nLabor \n\nFarmers \n\nPassengers \n\nGovernment/ \nEconomy \n\nTotal \n\nPrivate \nVehicle \nowners \n\nTilpung-Dhobi District Road Rehabilitation \n\n3,951 \n3,556 \n \n\n272 \n82 \n \n\n6,304 \n3,782 \n \nBadhighat Khola New Trail Bridge \n\n(2,447) \n0 \n \n\n72 \n65 \n \nRatnechaur-Bhakimli New Village Road \n\n160 \n96 \n \n\n(1) \n0 \n \n\n36 \n11 \n \n\n9,871 \n8,884 \n \nBaitadi-Sera Village Road Rehabilitation \n\n6,770 \n4,062 \n \n\n(928) \n0 \n \n\n539 \n162 \n \n\n1,648 \n3,266 \n989 \n2,940 \n \n \nKhalang-Byas Main Trail Improvement \n\n220 \n66 \n \n\n(754) \n0 \n\n \n\n(288) \n(173) \n \n\n \n\n12,720 \n1,272 \n\n20,512.00\n8,519.00 \n0.42 \n\n(4) \n(3) \n \n\n(81) \n(48) \n \n\n(104) \n(62) \n \n\n(251) \n(25) \n \n\n12.00\n144.00\n12.18\n\n(14,782) \n(1,478) \n\n \n\n1,389.00\n11,581.00\n8.34\n\n(4,113) \n(411) \n \n\n164.00 \n3,521.00 \n21.46 \n\n(25) \n0 \n\n2,352 \n2,117 \n \n\n2,120 \n1,272 \n \n\nNet Economic Effects \n116 \nEconomic Benefits to the Poor \n35 \nPoverty impact ratio \n \nNPV = net present value, NRs = Nepalese rupees. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n26. \nOne possible concern is the extent to which savings in VOCs are passed on by transport \noperators to road users. This will largely depend on the extent to which commercially operated \ntransport services are competitive. In determining the competitiveness of transport services, the \nfollowing factors should be considered: \n \n\n1,145.00 \n3,051.00 \n2.67 \n\n(3,357) \n(336) \n \n\n(62) \n(37) \n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nIn  the  project  area,  transport  charges  for  all  modes  are  nominally  administered \nprices, set by the district development committees (DDCs).  \nAlthough  motor  transport  operators  are  likely  to  have  more  influence  on  DDC \ndecision  making  than  road  users,  informal  services  provided  by  nonmotorized \nmodes that will continue to operate as transport alternatives, will restrain formal \nsector operators from retaining all of the cost savings. \nThe most important factor affecting commercial practices of transport operators is \nthat low per capita incomes make demand for transport price sensitive. \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10          57            \n\n8. \n\nProject-Wide Analysis \n\n \n27. \nThe  Project  adopts  a  process  approach,  therefore  the  analysis  does  not  provide  a \nquantitative economic justification for the Project as a whole, or even derive an overall EIRR for \nthe proposed investment in improved rural transport infrastructure. Rather, the analysis covers the \neconomic viability of examples of the range of types of transport infrastructure that the Project will \nfinance. The economic viability of the overall investment in improved rural transport infrastructure \nwill be ensured during project implementation by the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nusing cost-effectiveness criteria derived from the findings of this economic analysis \nto rank and prioritize potential subprojects; \napplying  the  appraisal  methodology  presented  here  to  the  feasibility  study  of \nprioritized subprojects proposed for financing; and \nthe  incorporation  of  control  mechanisms  for  supervision  and  approval  of  the \nselection  of  subprojects,  in  accordance  with  the  defined  criteria,  into  the  project \ndesign. \n\n \nThe Project does not set out to maximize EIRR in terms of quantifiable benefits. Rather, \n28. \nthe Project sets out to become economically viable while targeting its impacts on the poor and on \npoverty reduction, and devoting significant resources to achieving broader benefits and impacts on \nimproved  rural  livelihoods  that  are  real  but  difficult  to quantify. This approach is appropriate for  a \npro-poor rural infrastructure project that gives priority to the sustainability of its physical and social \nimpacts. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58\n\n         Appendix 11 \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \nSector Identified as a National Priority                     Yes \nIn Country Poverty Analysis                                        \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nSector Identified as a National Priority            Yes     \nIn Country Poverty Partnership \nAgreement                                                            \n\nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Nepal: \nNepal\u2019s poverty ranking is 144th out of 173 countries and the human development index (HDI) of 0.47 is lower than the \nweighted  average  for  South  Asia  (0.57).  A  comparison  of  the  HDI  values  across  the  development  regions  in  Nepal \nhighlights significant differences in human capabilities. The HDI of the Far Western region is 0.385, far lower than for the \nWestern (0.463), Central (0.476), and Eastern (0.465) regions. Poverty is deepest in the mountainous and hill regions, \nwhere  57-80%  of  people  in  the  targeted  districts  live  below  the  poverty  line,  and  is  most  extreme  in  the  most  remote \nareas, which have the poorest access. The people of these districts experience multiple deprivation, suffering low levels \nof literacy, high levels of discrimination against women, and poor access to essential services. The Project will support \nthe Tenth Five-Year Plan targets of reducing poverty, addressing the root causes of the conflict, and increasing access in \nthese districts.  \n \nThe Project covers 18 districts in the country\u2019s five development regions. The project components are (i) community \ndevelopment  and  rural  livelihood  restoration,  (ii)  capacity  building  and  decentralized  local  governance,  (iii)  rural \ntransport infrastructure, and (iv) project management services. The Project will use labor-based methods to employ \npoor people to build rural access infrastructure in their village areas. The infrastructure investments will be identified \nusing a transport planning process that ensures that the village development committee (VDC) participates in district \ndevelopment committee  decisions. Selected subprojects  must  have  beneficiaries  over  50%  of whom are below the \npoverty line as assessed through household surveys. Building groups (BGs) will be formed by local nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) and trained to work on the subproject. The BG members will be selected through transparent \ncommunity meetings that identify the poorest 20% of the households in the wards within 3 hour\u2019s walking distance of \nthe  subproject.  Membership  will  be  offered  to  the  poorest  households  first;  40%  of  the  members  will  be  women. \nWomen-only BGs will be established. The district wage rate (approximately NRs100 per day) will be used, which is \nonly attractive to the poorest families. Social mobilizers\u2019 support will provide a link between support and training to the \npoorest groups, community awareness and participation training, and the provision of rural infrastructure within these \ncommunities.  This  support  is  vital  to  alleviate  the  poverty  of  affected  project  families  and  the  surrounding \ncommunities. \n \nTraining  will  be  given  to  BG  members  in  construction  skills  and  also  in  support  skills  for  working  as  a  group, \nbookkeeping and record-keeping, savings and credit activities, and a range of human development (life skill) needs, \nincluding functional literacy; health and education awareness, including on sexually transmitted diseases; gender and \nvulnerable  group  awareness;  and  social  and  communication  skills.  A  number  of  training  models  are  being \nimplemented  in  many  project  districts.  The Project will  use the  same processes, including  accepted  approaches to \nlocal NGO identification and training. Wherever possible, program sharing with other agencies will be sought. \n \nThe Project will develop the capacity of local NGOs. The project design assumes that local NGOs will require training \nand  supervisory  support  at  the  district  level  to  be  able  to  deploy  and  manage  social  mobilizers  in  the  field.  District \nNGO training will be conducted by experienced national NGOs or development partner programs already operating in \nthe  project  districts.  Additional  training  will  be  required  to  strengthen  capacity.  Training  will  cover  social  mobilizer \nprogram  management,  social  mobilization  and  community  animation  skills,  and  \u201ctraining  the  trainer\u201d  programs  to \nenable the social mobilizers to train BGs and communities. \n \nCommunity  social  mobilization  programs  will  be  conducted  to  raise  awareness  and  encourage  participation  in \ncommunity  decision  making  by  all  community  members.  The  social  mobilizers  will  run  the  programs  and  promote \nawareness  raising,  information  dissemination,  and  other  related  activities  through  meetings  and  workshops  to  (i) \nfacilitate  effective  participation  by  beneficiaries,  including  disadvantaged  and  socially  excluded  groups,  in  planning, \nimplementation, and monitoring; (ii) ensure that construction jobs are targeted at the local poor, who should receive \nthe full financial benefits due to them; (iii) support the formation of savings groups, and facilitate the start-up of other \nsocial and economic development activities in the areas where physical access will be improved, to make livelihoods \nsustainable;  and  (iv)  identify  supplementary  infrastructure  investments  to  be  built  within  the  community.  The  social \nmobilizer will help create BGs to build subproject supplementary infrastructure to enhance rural livelihoods. \n\n \nThe  Project  will  enhance  rural  livelihoods  in  a  number  of  ways,  including  through  (i)  direct  wage  payments  to  the \npoorest  households,  amounting  to  about  70%  of  subproject  construction  costs;  (ii)  training  by  social  mobilizers  for \nBGs and communities to access other development opportunities in the district; and (iii) skill development to reduce \nvulnerability and social exclusion. A total of 34,700 person-years of jobs and seasonal work will be created by road \nimprovement  and  maintenance,  and  other  project  investments.  The  Project  is  also  expected  to  stimulate  more \nproductive agriculture and cultivation of high-value crops, leading to at least a 25% increase in family incomes. \n \nThe  communities  within  3  hours\u2019  round-trip  walking  distance  of  a  road  will  also  directly  benefit  through  increased \naccess,  lower  travel  costs  and  times,  and  increased  access  to  produce  markets.  Assuming  that  funds  for \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11          59            \n\nsubprojects are invested primarily in motorable roads, 800,000\u20131,200,000 direct project beneficiaries are estimated, \n65%  or  more (325,000\u2013450,000) of whom  are poor.  Of these,  25%  (130,000\u2013195,000) are expected to come from \ndisadvantaged castes.  \n \nThe social mobilization activities are designed to be implemented to the maximum extent possible through program \nsharing  with  partner  organizations  already  active  in  the  districts,  and  can  readily  be  adapted  to  close  collaboration \nand parallel cofinancing.  \n \nB.        Poverty Analysis                       Proposed Classification: Core Poverty Intervention  \n                                                                Thematic  Areas:  Sustainable  economic  growth, \n\nInclusive  social \n\ndevelopment \n\n \nIn selecting the project districts poverty indicators included (i) average income per capita per year, (ii) proportion of ethnic \ngroups and disadvantaged castes, (iii) lack of literacy, and (iv) proportion of marginalized and small farm holdings. In the \nfive  districts  where  sample  subproject  area  feasibility  surveys  were  carried  out,  56-76%  of  the  households  in  the \nsubproject zone of influence were poor, with 50% of the households in the Ramechhap subproject area being extremely \npoor. Selected subprojects will meet pro-poor criterion that more than 50% of the beneficiaries are below the poverty line \nas  assessed  through  household  surveys.  In the  Ratnechaur-Bhakimli  village  road core subproject,  average per  capita \nincome of affected people was more than 10% below the national poverty level and only two households earned more \nthan the national average. \n \nIn  the  project  districts,  poverty  is  most  acute  in  the  Far  Western  region,  where  73-80%  of  households  live  below  the \nnational poverty line. In the Eastern and Central project districts poverty is serious. In Okhaldunga and Solukhumbu 58-\n63% of the households are poor. In the Western project districts poverty averages 46%; poverty incidence is polarized, \nwith areas of high income concentrated in urban areas, and acute poverty elsewhere. Isolated areas have higher poverty \nthan others, a high level of food insecurity, few jobs, and no basic social facilities. In the Far Western project districts only \n11-26% households can grow sufficient food to feed their families all year round. In the Western project districts, food-\nsecure households average only 16-19% in Baglung, and 46% in Myagdi. In the Ratnechaur-Bhakimli subproject area \nonly  3%  households  are  able  to  feed  themselves  all  year,  and  97%  averaging  less  than  8.5  months.  Disadvantaged \ncastes  have  enough  food  only  for  6  months  a  year.  Poverty  is  widespread  in  all  social  groups,  highest  among  the \ndisadvantaged castes and the socially excluded, including women. Disadvantaged caste women suffer the highest levels \nof  poverty  and  discrimination.  The  project  districts  have  high  proportions  of  people  in  disadvantaged  castes,  reaching \n20% in the Western project districts. Mountain districts have fewer disadvantaged castes but more ethnic hill tribes than \nother areas. \n \nThe  Project  will  identify  the  most  impoverished  areas  using  district  data  on  food  security  at  the  VDC  level, \nsupplemented by household surveys in VDCs and wards. The surveys include community consultation to inventory \nthe  distribution  of  poorest  households,  disadvantaged  ethnic  groups  and  castes,  and  landless  and  marginalized \nhouseholds. Poverty and gender considerations are an integral part of the project design. The Project will monitor the \ndistribution  of  benefits  to  poor  men  and  women  by  (i)  baseline  surveys;  (ii)  records  of  BGs;  (iii)  records  of  partner \nNGOs, community-based organizations, and savings and credit agencies; (iv) participatory monitoring and evaluation \nemphasizing the involvement of poor men and women, with indicators of well-being, basic needs, assets, and social \nindicators being monitored; (v) process monitoring of social mobilization reports and audits of NGO performance, (vi) \nregular project performance monitoring; and (vii) sharing of subproject experiences and lessons learned. \n \n \nC.

Subprojects  will  be \nidentified through existing VDC participation in finalizing district transport master plans. The Project aims to increase the \nparticipation of the socially excluded and poor in VDC decision making through a community social mobilization program, \nwhich will target vulnerable and excluded groups (women and disadvantaged castes generally). Workshops run by social \nmobilizers  will  help  poor  people  develop  the  confidence  to  speak  at  meetings  and  participate  in  collective  decision \nmaking. Communities will be trained by the social mobilizers to acquire skills to run community consultations that include \nall sections of the community. Within BGs, the capacity of men and women to voice their concerns will be strengthened \nthrough training they will receive from the social mobilization and capacity-building activities. \n  \n \nD.
