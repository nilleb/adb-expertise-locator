Subject to adequate progress in policy reforms and the \nfeasibility  work  sponsored  under  the  PPTAs,  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) will continue to promote trade facilitation and customs reforms across \nthe ECA region through regional and country specific interventions. \n \n \n \nAt  independence,  the  industrial  and  trade  structure  of  the  Central  Asia \nrepublics  (CARs)  was  inward  oriented  and  served  the  countrywide  needs  of \nthe former Soviet Union (FSU). However, this production and trading structure \nbase  was  not  sustainable  in  the  post-Soviet  era,  as  the  captive  domestic \nmarkets within the FSU were lost and no longer economical, and output and \ntrade  collapsed.  The  transition  of  ECA  countries  to  market  economies  has \nopened  up  a  new  era  of  collaboration  and  provided  opportunities  for \ndeveloping mutually beneficial economic relations between them. To achieve \nindustrial  and  trade  growth  and  diversity,  the  ECA  region,  is  increasingly \nrecognizing  the  merits  and  advantages  of  strengthening  the  incentive \nframework  and  infrastructure  to  facilitate  effective  integration  into  the  world \ntrading system.  \n \nA  key  theme  of  the  RTFCCP  is  to  reduce  trade  barriers  between  the  CARs; \nXinjiang,  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC);  and  Mongolia.  Currently,  the \ntrade performance of the region, excluding the PRC, has lagged. Besides the \nlow level of trade flows, there is limited inter- and intra-regional trade. This is \nlargely because of the: (i) narrow export base; (ii) lack of trade diversification; \n(iii) infrastructure  bottlenecks;  (iv)  market  access  difficulties;  (v) weak  border \nand transit facilities; and (vi) weak institutional support, in particular customs \norganizations (COs). \n \nRecognizing these constraints, the region is keen to foster economic alliances \nin the fields of infrastructure, trade, and investment. In 1997, ADB initiated the \nregional  economic  cooperation  program  in  ECA  region  with  the  overall \nobjective of promoting economic growth and reducing poverty. ADB\u2019s regional \nstrategy is three-pronged: (i) development of transport to remove bottlenecks, \n(ii)  cooperation  in  the  energy  sector  to  encourage  rational  use  of  vital \nresources, and (iii) trade facilitation to promote market integration both within \nthe  region  and  with  the  outside  world.  Regional  cooperation  is  viewed  as \ncritical  for  political  and  economic  stability  in  a  region  that  shares  a  common \nhistory and common development challenges, but faces resources constraints \nand a number of geographical disadvantages. \n \n\n \nBorrowers \n \nThe Proposal \n\n \nThe Program \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fObjective   \nand Scope \n\nClassification\n \n\n \n\nPoverty \nClassification \n\nEnvironmental \nAssessment: \n\n \nThe ADB Program \nLoans \n \n\nLoan Amounts \nand Terms \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\niii\n\nThe  RTFCCP,  a  major  pillar  of  the  overall  ECA  economic  cooperation \nprogram  supported  by  ADB,  is  designed  to  better  integrate  the  transition \neconomies  into  the  world  trading  system  by  setting  up  a  regional  framework \nwith an effective cooperation mechanism, providing critical funding for reform \nand  modernization  of  the  two  weakest  customs  systems,  and  organizing  TA \nactivities to strengthen the legal and regulatory frameworks in conformity with \ninternational treaties and agreements.  \n \nWithin this broader agenda, the RTFCCP aims to promote good governance \nof  the  institutional  structure  that  deals  with  trade  facilitation  and  customs \nmodernization with the objective of promoting greater diversification in trade, \nwhich will eventually support the transformation of the weak industrial base in \nthese economies. The two least developed ECA economies, Kyrgyz Republic \nand Tajikistan, have the weakest customs organizations in the region, which \nneed to be reformed and modernized to effectively carry out their mandate of \ntrade facilitation, revenue collection, and combating smuggling. \n \nThe Program will aim to \n \n(i) \n\nStrengthen  governance  and  transparency,  and  improve  institutional \ncapacity of customs organizations, \nstrengthen the legal and regulatory framework for customs in line with \ninternational standards and conventions, \nimprove customs organizations' operational efficiency to facilitate trade \nand enhance revenue collection, and \ndevelop  an  effective  mechanism  for  cooperation  among  the  region's \ncustoms organizations. \n\n(iv) \n\n(iii) \n\n(ii) \n\n \nEconomic growth with key thematic areas including regional cooperation and \ngood governance. \n \nOther \n\n \nCategory  C.  Environmental  impacts  were  reviewed,  and  no  significant \nadverse environmental impacts were identified. \n \n \n\n \nIt is proposed that ADB support the RTFCCP by providing a program loan to \nthe  Kyrgyz  Republic  in  an  amount  of  $15  million  equivalent  and  a  program \nloan  to  Tajikistan  in  an  amount  of  $10  million  equivalent.  The  loans  will  be \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Fund resources and will have a term of 24 years and an \ninterest  charge  of  1%  per  year  during  the  grace  period  of  8  years  and  1.5% \nper year for the remaining period.  \n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nAdjustment \nCosts \n\nProgram \nPeriod and \nTranching \n\nExecuting  \nAgencies \n\nProcurement \nand \nDisbursement \n\nCounterpart \nFunds \n\n \nRegional \nTechnical \nAssistance \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nin  Tajikistan  upon  satisfactory  completion  of \n\nThe  implementation  of  policy  reforms  will  result  in  significant  benefits  from \ntrade facilitation and economic growth, but will involve adjustment costs. The \nadjustment costs will be in the form of severance pay for retrenched customs \nofficers  and  workers  and  associated  social  costs,  costs  related  to  the \nreorganization  of  the  customs  authorities,  costs  related  to  priority  capital \ninvestment  and  capacity  building  of  customs  organization,  and/or  additional \ngovernment  budget  allocation  for  effective  customs  operation  and  adequate \nremuneration  schemes,  and  short-term  revenue  losses  from  tariff  band \nadjustments  under  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  agreement  in  the \nKyrgyz  Republic  and  the  adoption  of  a  flat  5%  tariff  in  Tajikistan.  The  total \nadjustment  cost  is  estimated  to  be  $28  million,  including  $15.5  million  in  the \nKyrgyz Republic and $12.5 million in Tajikistan. \n \nThe  program  will  be  implemented  during  a  period  of  5  years.  The  program \nloans  will  be  released  in  two  equal  tranches  in  both  countries.  The  first \ntranche  will  be  released  upon  loan  effectiveness.  The  release  of  the  second \ntranche is expected before June 2004 in the Kyrgyz Republic and December \nthe  Program\u2019s \n2004 \nconditionalities.  \n \nIn  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the  Executing \nAgency  for  the  program  loan,  and  the  State  Customs  Inspectorate  (SCI)  will \nbe  the  main  implementing  agency.  In  Tajikistan,  the  MOF  will  be  the \nExecuting Agency for the program loan, with the Ministry of State Revenues \nand Duties (MSRD) as the implementing agency. \n \nThe loan proceeds will be utilized to finance the full foreign exchange costs of \ngoods and services procured in and originating from ADB member countries, \nother  than  those  specified  in  the  list  of  ineligible  items  and  those  items \nfinanced  by  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  official  sources.  All  procurements \nunder the loan will be undertaken through normal commercial practices for the \nprivate  sector  or  the  Government\u2019s  prescribed  procurement  procedures \nacceptable  to  ADB,  with  due  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency.  The \nBorrowers will certify that the volume of eligible imports exceeds the amount \nof the projected disbursements under the ADB loan in a given period. ADB will \nhave the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of \nthe Borrowers' certifications. \n \nThe counterpart funds to be generated from the loan proceeds will be used to \nsupport  the  implementation  of  the  Program  and  to  finance  the  costs  of \nstructural adjustment.  \n \nThe  proposed  RETA  amounting  to  $2,000,000  will  address  root  causes  and \nissues that affect cooperation at the regional level covering the CARs, PRC, \nand  Mongolia.  The  key  objective \nto  strengthen  regional  customs \ncooperation  to  establish  efficient  and  effective  customs  systems  to  facilitate \nforeign  trade  and  investment.  The  scope  of  the  RETA  will  include  the \nfollowing: \n \n\nis \n\n\f \n\n \n\n  v\n\nSimplification and harmonization of customs documentation. This \ncomponent will examine the core competence of the region's COs and \nkey  customs  procedures  (transit,  end-use,  import,  export,  economic \nzone,  post-entry,  etc.)  as  well  as  national  initiatives  for  improving \ncustoms  policies,  and  legal  and  institutional  frameworks.  Based  on \nthis,  RETA  will  provide  recommendations  for  improvement  and \nsimplification of customs procedures and will streamline organizational \nstructure of COs to bring them in line with international best practices \nand standards throughout the region, and develop a time-bound action \nplan  for  implementation.  The  recommendations  for  revised  practices \nand procedures will cover (a) harmonization of commodity description \nand  coding  systems;  (b)  WTO  Customs  Valuation  Agreement;  (c) \nWTO  Rules  of  Origin  Agreement;  (d)  adoption  of  standard  and \nrevised  Kyoto \nsimplified  procedures  and  practices  under \nConvention;  (e)  single-window  and  one-stop  solutions  to  expedite \ncustoms transactions; (f) harmonization of practices to encourage the \ndevelopment  of  efficient  customs  service  infrastructure  relating  to \nimprove  enforcement  of  restrictions  and  prohibitions;  and  (g) \ninternational  trade  rules  as  well  as  customs  integrity,  particularly \ntransparency. \n\nthe \n\nDevelopment of border posts and facilities. The RETA will support \nthe  review  and  identification  of  posts  for  joint  border  processing  and \nanalysis of procedures and practices at those border crossings. Based \non this review, the RETA will (a) develop a blueprint for simplified and \nharmonized  procedures  and  documentation  for  border  posts,  (b) \nlaunch  feasibility  studies  for  joint  border  processing,  (c)  provide \nsupport  for  their  implementation,  and  (d)  develop  agreements  among \ncustoms that opt for the pilot project. \n\ntraffic  while \n\nthrough-transit \n\nDevelopment of simplified transit systems. The RETA will help (a) \nassess how simplified transit systems might be introduced to facilitate \ntransport  movements  of \nretaining \nappropriate controls; (b) provide advisory support to enhance the use \nof the transit-under-bond system (TIR carnet), under which trucks are \nsealed  by  customs  upon  departure  and  can  cross  several  borders \nwithout  further  checks  until  they  reach  their  final  destinations;  (c) \nformulate  recommendations  to  improve  the  acceptability  of  the  TIR \ncarnet at border crossings and for removal of arbitrary transit fees on \nkey  transit  routes,  and  develop  modalities  for  improvement  of \ncommunication  and  exchange  of  information  between  border-control \nagencies  and  to  improve  border-crossing  facilities;  and  (d)  evaluate \nthe  potential  in  the  selected  countries  for  upgrading  their  transport \nsystems to multimodal means to facilitate transportation of goods and \nexpedite border crossing. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ntechnology  plan \n\nData  consolidation/information  sharing  and \ninformation  and \ncommunication  technology  (ICT)  development  for  customs \noperations.  The  RETA  will  help  conduct  needs  assessment  for  ICT \ndevelopment and, based on it, prioritize investment requirements and \ndetermine best options for hardware and software from a cost-benefit \nperspective.  The  RETA  will  further  develop  a  comprehensive  and \nflexible \nfor  a  customs  clearance  system  and \nmanagement  information  system,  and  migration  plans  to  replace, \nreuse,  or  relocate  existing  assets  and  develop  a  model  procedural \nmanual  for  customs  staff  to  use  in  daily  operations  involving  ICT.  To \nsupport  information  sharing,  the  RETA  will  conduct  a  survey  of \ndatabases  and  the  level  of  computerization  in  each  country,  and, \nbased on that design a data exchange system taking national security \nneeds  into  account.  Also,  the  RETA  will  help  develop  protocols  for \ncompiling and utilizing advanced electronic commercial manifest data, \nworking  in  partnership  with  industry,  while  coordinating  activities  on \ndata and intelligence gathering. \n\nDevelopment of risk management and post-entry audit. The RETA \nwill  assess  current  practices  adopted  for  risk  management  by  the \nnational  customs  administrations;  formulate  benchmarks  appropriate \nfor each country, derived from international codes and sound practices \n(e.g.,  World  Customs  Organization,  WTO,  and  International  Chamber \nof  Commerce  guidelines,  agreements,  and  protocols;  revised  Kyoto \nConvention);  and  streamline  the  examination  of  documents  and \nmerchandise  at  the  time  of  entry.  It  will  further  support  institution \ncapacity  building  to  adopt  risk-based  post-transit  and  post-entry \ncompliance  audits  and  develop  computerized  models  to  analyze  the \n\u201crisk  profiles\u201d  of  shipments  by  comparing  their  details  with  a  set  of \nindicators and categorizing them as either high-, medium-, or low-risk \ntransactions;  and  establish  standardized  procedures  on  post  entry \naudit according to risk profile of the shipments. \n \nDevelopment  of  a  regional  intelligence  system.  The  RETA  will \nsupport  (a)  analysis  of  the  nature  and  extent  of  illicit  trade,  including \ntypes  of  goods,  production  and \ntrade  volumes,  sources  and \ndestinations, channels, and modes and methods of transport; (b) stock \ntaking  of  existing  regional  programs  for  intelligence  gathering  and \nsharing;  (c)  evaluation  of  performance  of  the  existing  regional \nintelligence  system,  including  capacities,  effectiveness,  equipment, \nintelligence sources, and adaptability; (d) a proposal for strengthening \nthe  regional  intelligence  system  including  funding,  schedule,  and \nhuman  resource  requirements,  and  (e)  training  of  customs  officers  in \ntracking and tracing, etc. \n\n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nProject \nPreparatory TAs \n\nAmounts \n\nExecuting \nAgencies \n\n \n\nRisks and  \nSafeguards \n\n  vii\n\n(vii)  Capacity  building  for  regional  customs  organizations.  This \ncomponent  of  RETA  will  support  a  wide  range  of  training  programs \ncovering  topics  such  as  the  revised  Kyoto  Convention,  customs \nlegislation  and \nregulations,  harmonization  and \nstreamlining of customs procedures, implications of WTO membership, \npost-release  audit,  risk  management,  risk  assessment  selectivity, \ndeveloping  a  database,  use  of  information  technologies,  electronic \ndata  exchange,  institutionalizing  cooperation  mechanisms,  control  of \nillegal  goods  and \nfacilitation  and  public-private  sector \npartnership. \n\nimplementing \n\ntrade \n\n \nThe  customs  organizations  of  participating  governments  will  be \nthe \nimplementing  agencies.  The  Customs  Cooperation  Committee  (CCC)  will \nserve  as  the  policy  coordinating  body  to  provide  oversight  for  the  RETA \nimplementation,  and  technical  work  under  the  RETA  will  be  coordinated  by \nworking groups and the task force set by CCC. \n \nThe  PPTAs  are  to  assess  the  investment  requirements  for  customs \nmodernization and to support the implementation of the policy and institutional \nreforms envisaged under the RTFCCP, specifically to  \n \n(i) \n\nconduct  detailed  due  diligence  and  needs-assessment  of  ICT  and \ninfrastructure investment, including a detailed assessment of customs \ninfrastructure  facilities  and  of  ICT  hardware  and  software  needs;  and \nidentify rational investment strategies from a cost-benefit perspective;  \nperform technology audits;  \nprioritize  investment  activities  based  on  needs  assessment  of  border \ninfrastructure  and  equipment  at  priority  border  posts  and  processing \npoints;  \ndevelop the action plan for modernization;  \ndevelop a comprehensive procedures manual for customs staff to use \nin daily operations; \ndevelop  procedures  for  intelligence  gathering  and  establishment  of \ndatabases of risk profiles; and  \nprovide justification on investments based on cost-benefit analysis and \nfinancial and economic rate of returns. \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n \nThe total costs of the PPTAs are the same in Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, \nestimated  to  be  equivalent  to  $600,000  each,  of  which  ADB  will  finance \n$500,000  each  equivalent  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund  covering  the  entire \nforeign  exchange  cost  of  $335,000  and  $165,000  equivalent  of  the  local \ncurrency cost.  \n \nMOF  in  each  country  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  representing  the \ngovernment  with  SCI  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  MSRD  of  Tajikistan  as \nimplementing agencies. \n \nThe  Program  will  be  subject  to  various  types  of  risks,  including  political, \neconomic  and  financial,  operational,  and  system  risks.  A  carefully  designed \nregional trade facilitation and customs reforms and cooperation program and \nits proper implementation through effective institutional arrangements will to a \nlarge extent manage and reduce these risks. \n \n\n\fviii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\nPolitical risks stem from (i) the resistance of vested and territorial interests of \ndifferent  government  ministries;  (ii)  complexity  in  maintaining  effective \ninteragency  coordination  and  collaboration;  (iii)  difficulties  in  maintaining \nsmooth transition and public confidence in the restructuring and retrenchment \nprocess;  and  (iv)  delays  in  preparing,  reviewing,  and  introducing  legislation. \nPolitical risks can be best mitigated by commitment and support from higher \nauthorities of the respective governments and through the regional Ministerial \nConference  framework.  In  relation  to  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue,  the  Kyrgyz \nGovernment  has  established  a  high-level  Commission  for  Customs  Reform \nand  Modernization,  led  by  the  Prime  Minister,  with  members  from  all  key \ngovernment  agencies  as  well  as  aid  agencies,  to  act  as  the  steering \ncommittee  to  ensure  effective  implementation  of  the  Program.  Similarly,  the \nGovernment of Tajikistan has restructured fiscal agencies and established the \nnew  MSRD  by  combining  the  previously  separate  Customs  Committee  and \nTax  Committee  to  support  the  effective  implementation  of  customs  reforms. \nMSRD  will  be  the  focal  point  for  strategizing  and  implementing  customs \nreform policies. \n \nEconomic and financial risks arise because (i) customs reform measures may \nnot  necessarily  generate  more  collection  in  the  short  term,  which  would \naggravate  fiscal  pressures;  and  (ii) public  finance  stress  may  crowd  out \nIn  addition,  price \nnecessary \nfluctuations  in  the  major  export  commodities  of  these  countries  may  pose \nsignificant difficulties and prompt governments to delay customs reform. While \nthe short-term economic and financial risks can be mitigated through program \nloan support, the broader reform agenda of public finance, and streamlining of \ngovernance  being  supported  by  the  Program  will  have  a  positive  impact  on \nforeign investment flows. \n \nOperational and system risks arise from (i) lack of institutional capability in the \ncustoms  service  in  implementing  the  customs  reform  programs,  (ii)  lack  of \neffective  control \nfor  customs \nmodernization,  (iii)  weak  commitment  to  regional  cooperation  in  developing \nmechanisms  and  agreements  to  facilitate  trade  flows,  and  (iv)  reluctance \nacross borders to share data and information or other intelligence to combat \nand curtail smuggling. These risks are being mitigated by the establishment of \na  project  implementation  system,  a  carefully  designed  regional  TA  program, \nand development of the regional cooperation mechanism supported by ADB. \n\nfor  customs  modernization. \n\ninvestment  activities \n\nin  carrying  out \n\ninvestment \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  proposed  assistance \nfor the Regional Trade Facilitation and Customs Cooperation Program (RTFCCP). The RTFCCP, an \nintegral  component  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank's  (ADB)  overall  regional  economic  cooperation \nprogram for the East and Central Asia (ECA)1 region, includes (i) program loans to Kyrgyz Republic \nand  Tajikistan;  and  (ii)  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  to  Kyrgyz  Republic  and \nTajikistan  for  preparing  the  Customs  Modernization  and  Infrastructure  Development  Project;  and \n(iii) regional  technical  assistance  (RETA)  for  Trade  Facilitation  and  Customs  Cooperation.2  If  the \nBoard approves the proposed program loans and RETA, I, acting under the authority delegated to me \nby the Board, will approve the proposed PPTAs. Subject to full compliance with the reform agendas of \nthe programs, work on PPTAs, and satisfactory regional policy dialogue in trade facilitation, ADB will \ncontinue  to  promote  regional  trade  facilitation  and  customs  reforms  across  the  ECA  region  through \nregional and country specific interventions. \n \n\nII. \n\nREGIONAL DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT \n\n \nTraditionally  in  the  Central  Asian  republics  (CARs),  the  industrial  and  trade  structure  was \n2. \ninward  oriented  to  serve  the  countrywide  needs  of  the  former  Soviet  Union  (FSU).  To  meet  the \nrequirements  of  its  population,  the  FSU  adopted  production  and  price  controls  and  nurtured  them \nthrough the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon)3 trading arrangement and subsidized \ntransport system, which carried goods from one end to the other without commercial considerations. \nHowever, this production and trading structure base was not sustainable in the post-Soviet era, as the \ncaptive domestic markets within the FSU were lost and no longer economical. The CARs experienced \na significant shrinkage in output and trade after independence in 1991.  \n \n3. \nThe  transition  of  ECA  countries  to  market  economies  has  opened  up  a  new  era  of \ncollaboration  and  provided  opportunities  for  developing  mutually  beneficial  economic  relations \nbetween them. They are now positioning themselves to reestablish their historical economic and trade \nrelationships  and  are  looking  at  outside  markets  to  foster  new  trading  arrangements  mutually \nbeneficial  to  the  region,  including  with  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  Mongolia,  and  South \nAsia.  Although  internal  economic  imbalances  and  political  difficulties  have  had  their  impact  on  the \nevolution  of  economic  and  trade  relations  in  the  post-Soviet  era,  the  region  continues  to  enjoy  a \ndegree of economic interdependence in production, given resource diversity. The challenge the region \nfaces is how to reorient its industrial production structure from serving noncommercial objectives to be \nin line with comparative advantages. International trade, based on comparative advantage and market \nforces, would promote efficient resource allocation, productivity, and growth of industry sector, which \nis a necessary condition for long-term and sustainable poverty reduction.  \n \n4. \nTo  achieve  industrial  and  trade  growth  and  diversity,  the  ECA  region  is  increasingly \nrecognizing the merits and advantages of strengthening the incentive framework and infrastructure to \nfacilitate  effective  integration  into  the  world  trading  system.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  for  regional  cooperation \ngives high priority to trade, transport, and energy (para. 7). A key theme of the RTFCCP is to reduce \ntrade  barriers  between  the  CARs;  Xinjiang,  PRC;  and  Mongolia.  The  RTFCCP  scope  extends  to  an \naggregate population of 85.2 million and a gross domestic product (GDP) of $52.3 billion. The ECA \ncountries  can  reach  markets  in  inland  PRC  through  the  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region  in  the \n\n                                                 \n1  ECA  comprises  Azerbaijan,  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Mongolia,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  Uzbekistan,  and  the \n\nXinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\n2  The PPTAs were listed in ADB Business Opportunities on 18 April 2002, and the RETA was listed on 26 June 2002. \n3  Comecon,  now  defunct,  covered  Bulgaria,  the  former  Czechoslovakia,  FSU,  former  German  Democratic  Republic  (East \n\nGermany), Hungary, Mongolia, Poland, and Romania. Cuba and Vietnam also held full membership. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\neast, the Russian Federation to the north, Europe to the west, and the subcontinent to the south. The \nRTFCCP group of countries includes  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nthe  least  developed,  Kyrgyz  Republic  (which  opted  to  liberalize  its  economy  in  1994) \nand Tajikistan (which suffered major setbacks because of civil war until 1996) both of \nwhich exhibit high poverty incidence;  \nKazakhstan, which is the size of Europe, has a population of 15.7 million and a GDP of \n$18.3 billion, and is the most resource rich; \nUzbekistan, with a relatively larger population (25 million) and production close to $13 \nbillion,  which  has  retained  trade  and  investment  protectionism;  though  a  late  starter, \nsince  2001  Uzbekistan  has  adopted  market-oriented  reforms  and  has  begun  a  tariff \nrationalization program; \nAzerbaijan  and  Turkmenistan,  with  a  combined  population  of  13  million,  which  have \nbeen  slower  reformers  but  which  have  a  strong  energy  resource  base  and  a  critical \ngeographic  location  for  oil  and  gas  pipelines  extending  south  to  the  Persian  Gulf  and \nwest via Turkey to the Mediterranean; and  \nMongolia, with a population of 2.5 million and a GDP of $1 billion, which is isolated, has \nthe most difficult terrain, and has its small population spread over a large land area.  \n\n \n5. \nFollowing the abolishment of Comecon, several efforts were launched by the CARs to nurture \nregional trade linkages and cooperation. These included the establishment of the Commonwealth of \nIndependent  States  Customs  Union  (CIS-CU)  comprising  the  CIS  countries,4  and  the  Eurasian \nCustoms Union (ECU) comprising Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Russian Federation, and \nBelarus.  In  parallel,  most  ECA  members  have  bilateral  agreements  among  themselves  and  with \nRussia  and  PRC.5  These  trade  agreements  lack  conformity  with  international  treaties  and \nagreements, as most of the countries have yet to join the World Trade Organization (WTO).6 These \ntrading  arrangements  and  the  implementation  of  bilateral  agreements  have  created  new  trade \ndistortions and have not resulted in tangible results in trade facilitation. For instance, trade between \nKazakhstan  and  Uzbekistan  decreased  by  more  than  half  between  1995  and  2000,  though  trade \nbetween Kazakhstan and the other CARs has remained relatively stable. The trade agreements were \nby  and  large  driven  by  the  Russian  Federation\u2019s  considerations  of  strategic  security  priorities  rather \nthan by economic and social goals. CIS-CU has been ineffective because of its large coverage, and \nECU, though smaller, is not a representative body for the CARs\u2019 interests, since it excludes some of \nthe CARs. None of these bodies has explored trade diversion outside the CIS.  \n  \n6. \nOverall,  the  trade  performance  of  the  region,  excluding  the  PRC,  has  lagged.  Besides  a  low \nlevel  of  trade  flows,  there  is  limited  inter-  and  intra-regional  trade.  This  is  largely  because  of  the \nfollowing factors: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nNarrow export base. Within the CARs, there is a high degree of export concentration \n(see  para.  14  and  Table  1).  Over  80%  of  CAR  exports  constitute  cotton,  energy \nproducts,  and  a  few  minerals  that  face  sharp  international  price  volatility.  New  export \nproducts  have  tended  to  be  in  the  capital-intensive  extractive  industry,  which \ncontributes little to employment and poverty reduction. \nLack  of  trade  diversification.  Being  major  producers  of  raw  materials,7  CAR  trade \nand transit links served to move oil and gas (through pipelines) and other products at \n\n                                                 \n4  CIS  includes  Armenia,  Azerbaijan,  Belarus,  Georgia,  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Moldova,  Russian  Federation, \n\nTajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. \n\n5  The regional cooperation arrangement \u201cShanghai 5\u201d started in 1996 among PRC, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Russian \nFederation, and Tajikistan. Uzbekistan joined the annual summit as an observer in 2000 and as a full member since 2002.  \n\n6   Only PRC, Kyrgyz Republic, and Mongolia have joined WTO. \n7   While  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  have  few  exploitable  resources,  Uzbekistan  is  a  major  supplier  of  cotton, \n\nTurkmenistan of natural gas, and Kazakhstan of grain, and a variety of mineral and energy resources. \n\n\f3 \n\n(iii) \n\nunrealistic low prices to the FSU. These old trade patterns and routes largely remain. \nBut  the  bulk  of  trade  is  limited  to  primarily  one  bloc  of  countries  and  confined  to  one \nproduct. Further more, though exports from Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan to Western \nEurope have grown but they are confined to gold and aluminum, respectively.  \nInfrastructure  bottlenecks.  Infrastructure  constraints,  both  internal  and  external,  are \nhigh.  Internally,  the  existing  infrastructure  has  been  poorly  maintained  because  of \nfinancing constraints. On the external front, the CARs are landlocked, are distant from \nprincipal markets, and have weak transit systems. Substantial efforts are under way to \ndevelop  efficient  transport  corridors,  supported  by  external  assistance  agencies \n(detailed in para. 18).  \n\n(iv)  Market access. While the region enjoys most favored nation status and benefits from \nthe  general  system  of  preferences  in  developed  markets,  the  CARs  are  facing \naggressive  competition  from  large  developing  countries  and  barriers  to  entry  into \ndeveloped markets. Preferential trade agreement among the region is unlikely to have \nthe desired impact particularly in small open economies. \n\n(v)  Weak border and transit facilities. Although there are currently 333 border posts in \nthe  six  CARs  and  another  16  posts  along  Xinjiang\u2019s  border  with  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz \nRepublic,  and  Tajikistan,  these  are  inadequately  equipped.  The  traffic  flows  have  not \noften  been  a  consideration  in  the  development  of  transport  corridors  and  the  trade \ninterest.  Coordination  among  transport  and  customs  authorities  is  quite  weak  also. \nWhile  transit  goods  shipped  through  freight  forwarders,  that  are  registered  with  the \nInternational  Road  Transportation  Union  (IRU)  seem  to  pass  through  borders,  the \ngoods  traded  within  the  region  experience  difficulties.  Transit  rights  and  fees,  high \nfreight rates, and discriminative regulations on foreign trucks add to the cost of trading. \nIn  the  absence  of  adequate  controls,  smuggling  and  unofficial  transactions  of  goods \nand money have been pervasive.  \n\n(vi)  Weak  institutional  support.  Deficiencies  exist  in  trade-related  institutions  including \ninstitutions,  marketing  and  standards \nfinancial \n\ncustoms  organizations \norganizations, and transport and telecommunication authorities. \n\n(COs), \n\n \n7. \nRecognizing these constraints, the region is keen to foster economic alliances in the fields of \ninfrastructure,  trade,  and  investment.  In  1997,  ADB  initiated  the  regional  economic  cooperation \nprogram in ECA area with the overall objective of promoting economic growth and reducing poverty. \nThis program seeks to  address the  long-term development challenge facing transition economies of \nECA.  Operationally,  the  ADB  regional  economic  cooperation  program  has  grown  in  breadth  and \ndepth. On the one hand, this program has a mutually reinforcing three-pronged sector thrust involving \nthe  (i)  development  of  transport  to  remove  bottlenecks,  (ii)  cooperation  in  the  energy  sector  to \nencourage rational use of vital resources, and (iii) trade facilitation to promote market integration both \nwithin the region and with the outside world. On the other hand, ADB has synchronized its country-\nspecific  interventions  (paras.  38-39)  to  reinforce  the  regional  cooperation  program,  and  coordinated \nefforts  on  both  these  fronts  facilitate  synergies  and  more  effective  integration  of  individual  countries \ninto the world economy.  \n \n8. \nBesides  size  differences  and  geographical  diversity,  the  countries  in  region  are  at  different \nstages  of  development,  with  only  three  (PRC,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  Mongolia)  having  acceded  to \nWTO, though all are members of the World Customs Organization (WCO) and plan to accede to the \nRevised Kyoto Convention.8 There are potential benefits from all countries adopting harmonized legal \nand regulatory frameworks for trade, investment, customs, physio-sanitary standards, and intellectual \nproperty  rights.  Irrespective  of  membership  status,  these  economies  (except  Uzbekistan)  have \nadopted  open  trade  and  industrial  regimes,  but  all  need  support  to  conform  to  WTO  and  WCO \nguidelines and principles. Adoption of international standards and best practices cannot be achieved \n                                                 \n8  The  International  Convention  on  Simplification  and  Harmonization  of  Customs  Procedures  of  1973  as  revised  in  June \n\n1999. \n\n\f4 \n\nwithout  adequate  resource  capacities  and  development  of  an  adequate  institutional  setup  that  are \ndependent  on  each  country's  on  overall  political  commitment  and  the  pace  of  public  sector \ngovernance reforms.  \n \n9. \nTrade  facilitation  and  customs  modernization  assumed  new  significance  after  the  11 \nSeptember  2001  events,  calling  for  better  controls  and  vigilance  border  flows  and  transactions  and \nunderscoring  the  need  for  curbing  illegal  trade,  smuggling,  drug  and  arms  trafficking,  and  money \nlaundering.  \n \nThere are good prospects to encourage mutually beneficial cooperation among PRC, Central \n10. \nAsia,  and  Mongolia.  In  2000,  the  PRC  unveiled  its  \u201cGo-West\u201d  strategy,  which  represents  a  shift  in \nfocus  of  development  from  coastal  areas  to  the  country\u2019s  inland  and  western  regions,  including  the \nXinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The strategy aims \nto reduce the development gap between the coastal and other regions through, inter alia, investments \nin both infrastructure and human resources. For the PRC to achieve better results with this strategy, it \nis keen to foster close cooperation with the CARs and Mongolia. \n \nADB  has  worked  steadily  with  its  ECA  members  to  develop  a  common  understanding  of  the \n11. \nobjectives and scope of the regional economic cooperation program (paras. 38-39). This program has \nbeen endorsed by senior officials at the Ministerial Conference on Central Asia Economic Cooperation \nheld  in  Manila  in  March  2002  and  at  the  ADB  Annual  Meeting  in  Shanghai  in  May  2002.  These \nmeetings  have  resulted  in  broad  understandings  that  trade  promotion  requires  sound  infrastructure, \nsimple and transparent policies and procedures; and sound institutions, in particular modern customs \nsystems and border facilities. To steer these programs, the ministers and other senior representation \nhave endorsed the establishment of the Customs Cooperation Committee (CCC). ADB organized two \nmeetings  of  senior  customs  officials  in  January  and  August  2002;  the  participants  agreed  on  the \nmandate for CCC and the need for mutual cooperation in trade facilitation and customs coordination \nthat will be financed and supported by ADB (paras. 84-86).  \n \nIn  parallel  with  these  initiatives,  ADB  has  developed  country-specific  support  that  aims  to \n12. \ntarget the least developed countries facing geographic limitations, high poverty incidence, vulnerable \neconomic  conditions,  and  the  weakest  state  of  governance  and  institutional  development,  which \ntogether have held back development and trade. Based on these criteria and considerations, ADB has \nbeen  engaged  in  policy  dialogue  since  2000  with  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  to  promote  trade \nfacilitation  and  customs  reform  and  modernization.  Given  their  fiscal  and  external  account \nvulnerabilities,  both  economies  relied  on  external  borrowings  to  meet  their  financing  requirements, \nwhich contributed to significant debt accumulation. By mid 2001, external debt was close to 110% of \nGDP in the Kyrgyz Republic and 97% of GDP in Tajikistan, and the debt service ratios to revenue are \nexpected to exceed the crisis threshold by 2004. The Kyrgyz Republic rescheduled about $99 million \nin debt9 in March 2002 with the Paris Club, and debt service due to Paris Club creditors during 2002-\n2004  has  been  reduced  from  $101  million  to  $5.6  million.  As  a  result  of  these  negotiations,  the \nfinancing gap for 2002-2004 has thus been reduced from $221.2 million to $125.8 million. Tajikistan \nalso  needs  to  reschedule  its  debt.10  So  far,  the  Government  has  reached  an  agreement  with  the \nRussian Federation on debt reduction of $49.9 million and plans to develop a privatization program to \nsell off assets and use the proceeds exclusively for debt reduction. The two governments have been \nutilizing  the  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Facility  (PRGF)11  of  the  International  Monetary  Fund \n(IMF), which sets ceilings on public investment programs and external borrowings.  \n\n                                                 \n9  This covers principal and interest falling due from December 2001 to December 2004. \n10 Large creditors are Russian Federation ($330 million of $1.3 billion), Uzbekistan ($130 million), and international financial \n\ninstitutions. \n\n11 In  February  2002,  IMF  recalled  two  tranches  under  the  PRGF  to  Tajikistan  due  to  the  Government\u2019s  misreporting  of \nexternal arrears. As a result, IMF has put Tajikistan under a Staff Monitoring Program and launched a mission in July 2002 \nto discuss a new PRFG. \n\n\f5 \n\n \nBesides  the  programs  in  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan,  in  2002  Mongolia,  Uzbekistan  and \n13. \nAzerbaijan  requested  support  for  trade  policy  review,  aimed  to  access  the  state  of  policy,  legal  and \nregulatory  framework  of  trade  and  investment.  These  reviews  will  be  launched  as  part  of  overall \nregional economic and sector work. \n  \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR  \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n \nA. \n \n14. \nCCC  formed  as  a  part  of  the  RTFCCP,  includes  the  heads  of  the  COs  of  Azerbaijan, \nKazakhstan;  Kyrgyz  Republic;  Mongolia,  Tajikistan;  Turkmenistan;  Uzbekistan;  and  Xinjiang,  PRC. \nTable 1 provides key trade indicators. Of the CARs, Tajikistan followed by the Kyrgyz Republic have \nthe lowest level of trade on a per capita basis. The CARs trade mostly within the FSU (ranging from \n25% to 51%). The concentration ratios both in terms of export commodities and destinations are high. \nAlmost  80%  of  CAR  exports  constitute  primary  products:  oil,  gas,  electricity,  ferrous  and  nonferrous \nmetals,  cotton,  and  textiles.  Russia  is  often  the  most  important  trading  partner  for  most  of  these \ncountries. \n\n \nTable 1: East and Central Asia: Selected Trade Indicatorsa \n\nItem \n\nAzerbaijan  Kazakhstan \n\nTajikistan  Uzbekistan \n\n1,965 \n20% \n15.7% \n\n80% \n\n13,976 \n35.4% \n26.5% \n\n67.5% \n\nKyrgyz \nRepublic\n1,181 \n42.9% \n17.1% \n\n71.3% \n\n595 \n51.2% \n10.7% \n\n80.4% \n\n6,212 \n25% \n13.6% \n\n83% \n\n50% \n\n44.1% \n\n59.6% \n\n68.2% \n\n44.4% \n\n27.4% \n\n22.5% \n\n32.6% \n\n83% \n\n51.2% \n\n43.6% \n\n610 \n8.1 \n242.6 \n40% \n\n54% \n\n1,190 \n15.7 \n890.2 \n74.8% \n\n39.2% \n\n270 \n4.7 \n251.3 \n93.1% \n\n56.4% \n\n170 \n6.2 \n96.0 \n56.5% \n\n35.6% \n\n610 \n25.1 \n263.2 \n43.2% \n\nFSU = former Soviet Union, GNP = gross national product, PRC = People's Republic of China. \na  Export and import statistics are for 1999, total trade statistics are for 2000 and GNP and population statistics are for 2001. \nSources:  Asian  Development  Bank.  2002.

Being a few years old, these COs have \nyet to develop their core infrastructure, capacities, and governance. Most lack an effective organizational \nstructure, modern equipment and technology, and skilled professional staff. The incentive framework for \ncustoms officers is weak, given the low salaries paid. The customs codes and supportive regulations are \nnot consistent with international guidelines and have often been subject to change. Despite some bilateral \nor  other  trading  arrangements,  COs  do  not  utilize  harmonized  procedures  and  standardized  custom \ndocuments for transit, and tend to levy arbitrary fees and charges on transshipments.

PRC  customs  is  a  member  of  most  international  customs  organizations;  it \nhas  representation  in  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN),  Asia  Pacific  Economic \nCooperation (APEC), Greater Mekong Region etc. While there are bilateral and multilateral economic \nagreements between the PRC and the CARs, no specific customs agreements are being effectively \nenforced. \n \n18. \nFollowing the independence of the CARs, new international borders were drawn up, and the \noriginal  transportation  network  was  segmented.  Trade  is  critically  dependent  on  the  transportation \ncorridors, and these need to be rehabilitated and upgraded. Some regional transport and transit policy \nissues  are  being  addressed  under  the  European  Union  (EU)-sponsored  Transport  Corridor  Europe-\nCentral  Asia  (TRACECA).  Project  aimed  at  developing  an  east-west  transport  network  south  of  the \n\n\f7 \n\nRussian  Federation,12  and  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme's  (UNDP)  Silk  Road  Area \nDevelopment  Project.  In  addition,  ADB  has  been  supporting  rehabilitation  of  several  roads  and \nrailways in the CARs13 to facilitate regional transport, and has initiated RETA for a feasibility study of \nthe  road  and  railways  links  from  Uzbekistan  through  Tajikistan  and  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  to  the \nXinjiang  Autonomous  Region.14  The  development  of  transport  corridors  supports  the  RTFCCP. \nAmong  others,  the  RTFCCP  will  seek  to  initiate  more  dialogue  on  the  inadequacies  of  cross  border \nfacilities,  entry  and  transit  procedures,  restrictions  and  charges,  inconsistent  axle  load  limits  and \ncontrol, etc. that have served as trade barriers. \n \nB. \n \n\nIssues and Opportunities15 \n\n1. \n\nWeak Institutional Capacities and Governance of Customs  \n\n \nGiven the historical context and the recent establishment of COs in the CARs, most agencies \n19. \nare young and have limited experience in international trade and customs operations. The COs have \nsignificant economic, fiscal, and social obligations, as they need to promote trade facilitation, generate \nrevenues, and fight smuggling and drug trafficking. Given the lack of policy direction, motivation, and \nresources, the COs have not performed these functions effectively. The principal common issue that \nruns  across  all  these  COs  is  weak  governance.  Despite  their  significant  role  and  function,  they  lack \nstrategic  vision,  direction,  transparency,  and  accountability;  have  low  budgets  that  impede  ability  to \nmodernize; lack profession skills; have inadequate incentive systems; and have yet to conform to the \nemerging guidelines and principles of customs operations of WCO and WTO. \n \n20. \n Of  all  the  regional  COs,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  State  Customs  Inspectorate  (SCI)  under  the \nMinistry  of  Finance  (MOF)  and  former  Customs  Committee  (CC)16  in  Tajikistan  has  more  serious \nproblems.  Both  were  set  up  in  1991.  The  staff  strength  of  SCI  is  1,235,  and  customs  staff  of  the \nMinistry  of  State  Revenues  and  Duties  (MSRD)  1,500,  with  the  former  having  15  regional  offices, \nwhile the latter has 5 regional offices. SCI is in charge of 15 processing centers and 64 border posts, \nand MSRD oversees 28 border posts and 26 clearance points. Of these, only a small number of posts \naccount for the bulk of processing. Annually, SCI processes 60,000 customs declarations manually. \nThe  time-consuming  customs  processing  procedures  and  lack  of  transparency  hamper  trade  and \nraise the costs of doing business. The average salary at both COs is about $40 per month. Though in \nline with the civil service at large, it is too low to attract and retain qualified and capable staff. In 2000, \nthe  turnover  of  SCI  staff  was  estimated  at  13.5%,  an  indication  of  the  difficulty  of  developing  a \nprofessional and effective customs organizations.  \n \n21. \nIn  2001,  government  budget  allocation  for  the  COs  in  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  were \nclose to $1.1 million and $260,000, respectively. Both COs are also allowed to collect the user fee of \n0.15%  from  customs  clearances,  which  generated  close  to  Som70  million  ($1.46  million)  in  Kyrgyz \nRepublic  and  TJS5  million  ($1.8  million)  in  Tajikistan.  These  budgets  largely  finance  staff \nremuneration  or  limited  operational  expenses  and  cannot  finance  growing  investment  requirements. \nThe  former  CC  headquarters  of  Tajikistan  did  not  segregate  functions  effectively,  and  all  activities \nrelated  to  operations,  human  resources,  and  budget  were  carried  out  by  the  Control  Department. \n\n                                                 \n12 TRACECA covers Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Romania, Tajikistan, \n\nTurkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. \n\n13 ADB has supported rehabilitation of regional roads and railways including Loan 1774-KAZ: Almaty Bishkek Regional Road \nRehabilitation,  Loan  1444-KGZ:  Road  Rehabilitation,  Loan  1630-KGZ:  Second  Road  Rehabilitation,  Loan  1775-KGZ: \nAlmaty  Bishkek  Regional  Road  Rehabilitation,  Loan  1853-KGZ:  Third  Road  Rehabilitation,  Loan  1819-TAJ:  Road \nRehabilitation, Loan 1631-UZB: Railway Rehabilitation and Loan 1773-UZB: Railway Modernization.  \n14 ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance for Regional Cooperation Transport Project in Central Asia. Manila. \n15 The problems and constraints analysis (problem tree) is presented in Appendix 1. \n16  CC was an independent agency until January 2002, when it and the Tax Committee were combined to form the Ministry of \n\nState Revenues and Duties. \n\n\f8 \n\nThere  are  no  customs  operation  manuals  and  no  performance  standards,  and  day-to-day  operation \nwas based on an ad hoc set of rules. SCI\u2019s operations are audited externally but there is no internal \naudit function. MSRD lacked both external and internal audit mechanisms to ensure compliance and \naccountability.  Post-entry  audit  functions  have  been  established,  but  in  Tajikistan  so  far  this  is  only \napplied to imports related to humanitarian purposes, and in the Kyrgyz Republic the capacity to carry \nout  audits  is  insufficient.  Staff  limitations  and  the  absence  of  customs  service  information  have \nprevented  COs  from  disseminating  trade  information  and  informing  public  of  customs  activities  on  a \ntimely basis. \n \nStaff morale is affected by low salary, lack of accountability and responsibility for actions, and \n22. \nlack  of  recognition  of  honesty.  Inappropriate  recruitment  and  promotion  policies,  with  no  specific \nperformance  criteria  or  appraisal  system,  have  affected  performance.  Being  part  of  public \nadministration,  customs  officers  who  are  charged  with  valuation  and  inspection  functions  draw \nsubsistence wages while enjoying tremendous powers for clearing consignments. The temptation for \nrent  seeking  as  such  is  therefore  high.  Corruption  often  occurs  in  the  form  of  collusive  or  coercive \npayments.  In  Tajikistan,  the  Government  has  yet  to  install  an  effective  anticorruption  mechanism;  in \nthe  last  3  years,  about  300  government  officials  were  investigated  for  corruption,  but  only  12  were \nsent to the courts.  \n \n\n2. \n\nInadequate Legal and Regulatory Framework  \n\n \n Besides holding membership in WTO and WCO, the Kyrgyz Republic is a member of the IRU, \n23. \nand intends to accede to the Revised Kyoto Convention. But it has not yet fully adopted international \nconventions  and  agreements  in  the  national  legislation,  procedures  and  practices.  The  present \nCustoms Code, enacted in 1997 based on the old Russian Code, was amended in 1998 following the \naccession  to  WTO,  but  this  revised  Code  is  not  fully  aligned  with  international  agreements  and \nstandards and is complex and difficult to enforce. The Customs Tariff Law provides tariffs schedule, \nwhile the Tax Code contains sections on goods that are exempt from duties and taxes. There are no \ncomprehensive procedural and instruction manuals for customs staff to use in their daily operations, \nwhich is one reason for inconsistent application and implementation of laws and regulations, as well \nas tariffs and exemptions, and inefficient procedures and processes.  \n \n24. \nThe legal and regulatory framework evolving in Tajikistan is based on the old Soviet customs \nlegislation.  The  existing  Tajikistan  Customs  Code  is  too  complex  and  ambiguous  and  without  clear \ndistinction between the primary law and secondary regulations, which could provide a perspective on \nimplementing  rules.  In  general,  the  enactment  of  legislation  requires  a  long  lead  period,  and  the \nprocess  is  nontransparent,  prone  to  abuse,  and  lacking  in  public  surveillance.  The  government \ndecrees and regulations are often issued retroactively, and there is no opportunity for line ministries \nand  the  general  public  to  comment.  In  addition,  enacted  regulations  and  decrees  are  often  not \npublished  nor  distributed  to  the  public;  thus  the  general  public  does  not  know  the  content  and \napplicability of relevant laws and regulations.  \n \n\nInadequate Revenue Collection and Low Operational Efficiency  \n\n3. \n \n25.  \nThe  COs  have  a  crucial  role  in  revenue  collection.  SCI  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  contributed \n28.8% of revenues in 2001, or 4.9% of GDP, while the corresponding figures for Tajikistan were 23% \nand  3.2%,  respectively.  The  Kyrgyz  Government\u2019s  main  source  of  revenue  is  the  value-added  tax, \nwhich accounts for 27% of the total revenues, followed by excise taxes, income taxes and road taxes. \nThe  two  main  taxes,  value-added  tax  on  imports  and  excise  tax  on  fuel  and  alcohol,  are  mainly \ncollected  by  SCI.  Improved  revenue  collection  is  crucial  to  meet  expenditure  requirements  and  to \nimprove  fiscal  management.  Each  year  a  revenue  target  is  set  for  SCI  by  the  Parliament,  but  the \ntargets  are  often  not  realistic  due  to  inadequacies  of  the  forecasting  models.  Overall  revenue \ncollection is low by international comparison, caused by underreporting, payment lags, collusion, and \n\n\f9 \n\nrent  seeking.  In  addition,  smuggling  is  a  major  problem  both  in  terms  of  foregone  revenue  on  legal \ngoods  and  social  problems  caused  by  illegal  drugs.  Recent  government  estimates  indicate  that \nsmuggling of goods in the first 10 months of 2001 resulted in revenue losses of close to Som15 billion \n($312  million),  which  is  larger  than  MOF\u2019s  projected  revenues  of  Som12.8  billion  ($266  million)  in \n2001. Revenue losses due to smuggling of alcohol were estimated at Som4 billion, and those due to \noil and gasoline smuggling at another Som4 billion. While SCI has a unit dedicated to antismuggling \nefforts, the shortage of equipment, such as scanners and search equipment, at border crossings and \nprocessing points, as well as inadequate risk profiling and risk assessments, make SCI insufficiently \nequipped to effectively combat smuggling.  \n \n26. \nIn  Tajikistan,  the  revenue  targets  for  customs  are  determined  by  MOF  and  approved  by \nParliament. Operational inefficiencies and inadequate revenue collection stem mainly from the lack of \nautomation,  inspection  equipment,  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  infrastructure, \nand  underdeveloped  customs  service  intermediaries.  The  key  border  posts,  including  that  at  the \nDushanbe international airport, do not have basic examination and search equipment such as X-ray \nmachines.  Customs  inspectors  randomly  perform  luggage  inspection  by  hand,  which  annoys \ntravelers,  poses  security  risks,  and  offers  opportunities  for  corruption.  Tajikistan  customs  does  not \npublish performance indicators; however, based on the calculation of a number of key ratios, such as \nrevenue  collected  or  trade  volume  per  customs  staff,  Tajikistan  customs  has  a  significant  level  of \noverstaffing  compared  with  neighboring  countries.  Weak  coordination  among  government  agencies, \nsuch  as  customs  and  tax  authorities,  also  contributes  to  poor  revenue  collection.  Smuggling  is \nwidespread  through  over  100  unguarded  mountain  passes  to  neighboring  countries.  The  customs \nonly has two specialists in charge of antismuggling, at headquarters. There is also limited exchange of \ninformation  between  customs  and  the  Drug  Control  Agency  (DCA);  thus  there  is  limited  feeding  of \n\u201chot\u201d  information  to  DCA  and  other  law  enforcement  agencies  on  suspected  drug  trafficking  cases, \nand limited response from DCA to customs on profiles of suspected drug traffickers. \n\nLack of Effective Regional Cooperation \n\n \nLack of regional cooperation of customs is a significant impediment for trade facilitation for all \n27. \ncountries  in  the  region  and  particularly  for  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan.  Lack  of  regional  co-\noperation stems from  \n \n\nabsence  of  an  effective  organizing  body  or  a  regional  framework,  and  lack  of \nexperience to implement existing agreements;  \nno cooperation mechanism with trade and external transport entities;  \nlack of funding for regional cooperation activities; \nweak  cooperation  on  legislative  matters,  particularly  relating  to  risk  profiling  and \ninvestigation and management;  \nlack of conformity to international treaties and agreements;  \nno  ICT  interface  between  regional  customs  organizations  leading  to  secrecy  of \ninformation, fear of unequal exchange of information concerns regarding reliability, etc.; \nand  \nlack  of  a  single  combined  database  on  the  movement  of  goods  and  transportation \nacross borders. \n\n \n4. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n \n28. \nThe  CARs  have  signed  bilateral  and/or  multilateral  agreements  at  the  government  level  that \ncontain  certain  commitments  in  relation  to  customs.  These  agreements  have  been  reached  at  the \nhigher  political  level,  and  often  without  the  involvement  and  consultation  of  lower  tiers  of  the \ngovernment  and  COs.  These  agreements  have  not  resulted  in  visible  improvements  in  regional \ncooperation  and  trade  facilitation  due  to  the  lack  of  a  coherent  consultation  process  for  reaching \nagreements,  and  inadequate  institutional  and  financial  support  to  implement  these  arrangements. \n\n\f10 \n\nThere are also too many agreements that either overlap or sometimes contain conflicting clauses with \nother agreements.  \n \n29. \nFurthermore,  the  existing  customs  unions  including  the  ECU  and  CIS-CU  have  failed  to \nenhance  customs  cooperation  effectively.  The  ECU  is  dominated  by  the  Russian  Federation  and \nconsequently lacks the ability to support smaller and weaker CARs. Meanwhile the CIS-CU focuses \non a much larger geographical area. The bilateral agreements with the PRC are either not present or \nnot effective in that cooperation between the CARs and PRC customs is limited. These agreements \nhave  not  been  reflected  in  improved  relationships  and  cooperation  between  individual  COs  in  the \nregion.  \n \n30.  Without  a  coherent  regional  cooperative  framework,  each  country  has  operated  in  isolation, \ndedicated to its own specific customs environment. At a practical level, this problem manifests itself in \nthe form of lack of harmonization and standardization of legislation, documentation, and procedures. \nConstraints  prevail  in  sharing  and  exchanging  information  on  cross-border  flows  and  on  tracking \nmovement  of  prohibited  goods  between  customs  and  external  parties.  Lack  of  cooperation  also \nresults in delays in transit traffic, duplication of documentation and processing activities, and revenue \nleakage, and thus limits antismuggling performance.  \n \n31.  With  the  steady  rise  in  globalization  and  international  movement  of  goods  and  services,  the \ndata  necessary  to  move  such  goods  and  services  across  borders  need  to  be  standardized, \nharmonized,  and  efficiently  processed.  Delays  in  the  entry  of  goods,  and  illegal  activities,  have  cost \nimplications. There is need to upgrade the effectiveness of ICT applications to facilitate data transfer \nand intelligence gathering to combat smuggling. Technological advances, particularly in ICT, make it \neasy  for  customs  to  provide  services,  and  the  public  to  access  relevant  information,  and  allow  for \nfaster release of cargo, lower customs cost, reduced pilferage, and reduced corruption at the borders, \nsince there will be less paper processing and fewer requirements for signatures.  \n \n32. \nlack  of  enforcement  of  regional  agreements  and  acceptance  of  standardized \ndocumentation are illustrated by the problems forwarding agents face in the region. For instance, the \nKyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  International  Carrier\u2019s  Association  is  a  member  of  IRU,  which  seeks  to  facilitate \ninternational shipments. IRU has developed and acts as a guarantor for the Transports Internationaux \nRoutiers  (TIR)  carnet  system,17  under  which  trucks  are  sealed  by  customs  upon  departure  and  can \ncross several borders without further checks until they reach their final destinations. However, the TIR \ncarnet  is  not  always  accepted  at  border  crossings  in  the  CARs  and  trucks  have  to  open  their \nshipments  for  checks  at  borders,  which  delay  shipments.  In  addition,  provinces  in  Kazakhstan  and \nUzbekistan tend to impose a range of arbitrary transit fees on Kyrgyz transports thereby raising costs \nsubstantially.  \n \n33. \nTajikistan suffers from unsatisfactory multilateral and key bilateral relationships, which prevent \nefficient trade flows. Given the geographical and logistical profile, cooperation between Tajikistan and \nUzbekistan is critical. For example, the only road link between the north and south of the Tajikistan in \nwinter  is  through  Uzbekistan,  as  is  the  only  rail  link.  Almost  all  imports  and  exports  have  to  pass \nthrough Uzbekistan. The introduction of a transit charge and road tax by neighboring countries such \nas Uzbekistan and Kyrgyz Republic is reducing trade for Tajikistan. Uzbekistan has also closed some \nof its border posts to all Tajikistan vehicles. \n \nC. \n \nIn  general,  the  trade  regimes  of  the  CARs  have  been  liberalized  in  most  cases  (except  for \n34. \nUzbekistan)  as  a  part  of  overall  IMF  programs  and  associated  structural  reforms.  In  the  region, \n                                                 \n17  Transit under bond. \n18 See Appendix 2 for detailed information on external assistance in the customs area. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector18 \n\n The \n\n\f11 \n\nlevels  has  provided  new  opportunities \n\nbilateral  and  other  development  assistance  has  helped  draft  laws  and  regulations  for  trade  and \ncustoms.  Coordination  of  external  aid  activities  at  the  country  level  in  the  trade  and  customs  areas \nhas  been  an  issue,  though  now  with  ADB\u2019s  growing  role  in  trade  and  customs  at  the  country  and \nregional \nfor  coordination  of  external  assistance.  A \ncomprehensive mechanism has been put in place by ADB to coordinate such activities. First, there is \nan interaction at the ministerial level to agree on a broad agenda of regional development including \ntrade facilitation. Second, the Ministerial Conference in Manila in March 2002 formally approved the \nestablishment  of  the  regional  CCC,  which  will  serve  as  a  focal  body  to  coordinate  ADB\u2019s  advisory \nsupport  and  will  coordinate  other  assistance  to  support  the  overall  trade  and  customs  reforms \nenvisaged under the RTFCCP. Third, pilot programs have been launched in countries with the least \ndeveloped  COs,  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan,  to  upgrade  these  countries'  trade  facilitation  and \ncustoms infrastructure and facilitate their integration with the regional cooperation mechanism.  \n \nTo  start  off  the  process  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  the  Government  with  the  assistance  of  IMF, \n35. \ndeveloped  a  customs  modernization  program  in  1999.  To  support  this  program,  the  Trade  and \nInvestment  Project  of  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  focused  on \nthe revision of Customs Code. The EU TRACECA project seeks to facilitate road transportation and \nharmonization  of  border  crossing  procedures.  Under  the  TRACECA  project,  grant  funds  have  also \nbeen allocated to equip three border posts in the Kyrgyz Republic, including the Ak-Jul border post on \nthe  Bishkek-Almaty  road.  The  Exports  and  Border  Security  program  sponsored  by  the  US \nGovernment  provides  equipment,  tool  kits,  and  training  for  antismuggling  efforts  and  detection  of \nhazardous  materials  to  SCI  and  the  National  Security  Agency  for  guarding  the  border  posts.  The \nSwiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) may provide grant funds of up to $5 million for \ncomputerization of SCI. ADB, as the lead aid agency supporting customs reform and modernization, \nwill coordinate the activities of external agencies. \n \n36. \nA  number  of  bilateral  and  multilateral  agencies  are  currently  involved  in  trade  policy  reform \nand  facilitation  and  customs  reforms  and  modernization  in  Tajikistan.  The  World  Bank,  through  its \nSecond  Structural  Adjustment  Credit  (SAC2),  seeks  civil  service  reforms,  and  budget  and  treasury \noperations  reforms  that,  among  other  agencies,  will  have  impacts  on  customs.  SECO  is  going  to \nimplement a small-scale TA to study selected aspects of customs reform and cofinancing the SAC2 \nloan. In 2001, SECO subcontracted a TA to the United Nations Institute of Training and Research to \nhelp Tajikistan undertake background work for WTO application. \n \n37. \nA  number  of  lessons  have  been  drawn  from  multilateral  and  bilateral  TA  programs.  Many  of \nthese projects focused on technical issues, and did not address issues of policy or institutional reform \nsufficiently,  partly  due  to  lack  of  financial  leverage  and  coherent  regional  focus.  ADB  as  a  regional \ndevelopment bank, can have more leverage on policy and institutional reforms by combining program \nloans  with  targeted  and  coordinated  TA  on  a  regional  basis  to  ensure  effective  implementation  of \nreforms.  In  general,  there  is  a  broad  agreement  that  it  is  premature  to  engage  in  ad  hoc  effort  of \ncomputerization without adequate restructuring of COs, upgrading of customs, and coordinating and \ncooperating between tax and customs administrations.19 Drawing from these lessons, ADB's RTFCCP \nhas been designed to ensure effective sequencing of reforms and investment programs. \n \nD. \n \n38. \nSupporting  regional  economic  cooperation  to  promote  sustainable  economic  growth  and \npoverty reduction is a key objective of ADB\u2019s operations. ADB's country strategy and program papers \nfor  both  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  (2002\u20132004)  recognize  that  political  and  economic  stability \nand  favorable  economic  relations  with  neighboring  countries  are  necessary  preconditions  for  the \nsound development of the landlocked CARs. Facilitating trade, both intra-regional and with other parts \n                                                 \n19 As  reported  in  Brian  Rankin  Staples.  2002.  \u201cTrade  Facilitation:  Improving  the  Invisible  Infrastructure,\u201d  in  Development, \n\nADB\u2019s Operations and Strategy in the Sector \n\nTrade and the WTO: A Handbook. Washington, DC: World Bank. \n\n\f12 \n\nof the world, has been a focus of ADB\u2019s program in the region since 1997. Despite the progress made \nover the past decade, considerable barriers to trade, especially non-institutionalized barriers, continue \nto exist. Since 2000, at the request of the governments in the region, ADB\u2019s effort, in trade facilitation \nhas  concentrated  on  strengthening  cooperation  in  the  region.  ADB  sponsored  a  sector  study  on \nregional customs,20 which aimed at identifying and providing an in-depth diagnosis of the key issues \nand constraints to regional cooperation. The study analyzed issues and their root causes both at the \nregional and national levels in the CARs, and highlighted the main problems facing customs in Kyrgyz \nRepublic and Tajikistan discussed in the Issues and Opportunities section (paras. 19-33). ADB\u2019s focus \non promoting subregional cooperation in Central Asia should strengthen the developmental potential \nof both Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan. \n  \n39. \nAs highlighted earlier, ADB also sponsored a meeting for senior officials of regional customs \norganizations in January 2002 in Manila to discuss the role of enhanced customs cooperation and to \nshare with them the experience of other regional cooperation mechanisms such APEC and ASEAN. \nBased  on  the  background  work  undertaken,  customs  cooperation  is  viewed  as  the  priority  area  of \ntrade facilitation under the broader partnership to foster economic cooperation in the CARs. The First \nCCC  Meeting was  held  from  20-21  August 2002 in Urumqi, PRC, which endorsed the objectives and \nscope of the Common Action Plan (paras. 63-66). \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nObjectives and Scope21 \n\n \nA. \n \n40. \nThe RTFCCP, a major pillar of the overall ECA economic cooperation program supported by \nADB,  is  designed  to  better  integrate  transition  economies  into  the  world  trading  system.  This  is \nproposed by setting up a regional framework with effective cooperation mechanisms, providing critical \nfunding  for  reform  and  modernization  of  the  two  weakest  COs,  and  organizing  TA  activities  to \nstrengthen legal and regulatory frameworks in conformity with international treaties and agreements. \nThe RTFCCP coverage extends to 85.2 million people spread over a land area of 6,768,000 square \nkilometers (slightly smaller than Australia). The region has a fair degree of diversity, with Uzbekistan \nbeing  the  largest  in  population  and  Kazakhstan  having  the  biggest  area  and  strongest  resource \nendowment,  while  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  are  weakest  in  resource  endowment  and  in \ninstitutional capacity, and face difficult economic conditions. Traditionally, the countries that were part \nof  the  FSU  prospered  based  on  interdependencies  that  were  encouraged  irrespective  of  efficiency \nconsiderations.  The  CARs  have  an  extensive  transport  network  totaling  some  220,000  kilometers \n(km)  of  roads  and  22,000  km  of  railways.  Transport  routes  were  oriented  towards  Russia,  however, \nwith few connections to the PRC and other countries. After the dissolution of the FSU, the economies \nhave  been  focusing  on  inducing  more  market  orientation  and  looking  at  new  ways  of  fostering \ninterdependency.  Although  at  different  pace  and  scales,  most  CARs  have  adopted  fairly  liberal \neconomic systems by liberalizing price and tariff regimes.  \n \nIn  parallel,  the  countries  in  the  ECA  region  have  been  entering  into  regional  and  bilateral \n41. \ncooperative  arrangements  to  foster  economic  cooperation  although  these  have  been  driven  by \nsecurity considerations or by desire to regain the interdependency lost following the disintegration of \nthe  Soviet  Union.  Results  of  these  cooperative  arrangements  have  been  mixed.  Emerging  trade \npatterns reflect a narrow export base and high country concentration in trade flows. Trade within FSU \nremains  high,  though  with  peculiarities  (for  instance  trade  between  Uzbekistan  and  Kazakhstan  is \nsmall), and trade between larger and smaller economies of the FSU has been uneven. Trade with the \nPRC has grown, though it does not exhibit a systematic and sustainable trend.  \n \n\n                                                 \n20 ADB. 2001.

Manila. \n21  The Program Framework is presented in Appendix 3. \n\n\f13 \n\n42. \nRecognizing this, ADB launched a regional economic cooperation program that aims to foster \ntrade  and  customs  facilitation  and  development  of  transport  and  energy  in  the  region.  Regional \ncooperation is viewed as critical for political and economic stability in a region that shares a common \nhistory  and  common  development  challenges,  but  faces  resources  constraints  and  a  number  of \ngeographical disadvantages. The proposed RTFCCP aims to support the initial agreements reached \nat  these  forums  to  foster  deeper  regional  cooperation,  and  to  strengthen  governance  of  COs  of  the \ntwo weaker economies in the region so that they can effectively modernize their operations and trade \nfacilitation systems. \n \n43.  Within this broader agenda, the RTFCCP aims to promote good governance of the institutional \nstructure that deals with trade facilitation and customs modernization with the objective of promoting \ngreater  diversification  in  trade,  which  eventually  will  support  a  transformation  of  the  weak  industrial \nbase in these economies. The two least developed economies (Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan) face \na tough internal and external environment. On the one hand, the industry sectors of these countries \nhave not been able to revive and diversify. On the other hand, the countries have limited access to \nboth  regional  and  international  markets.  Stronger  regional  integration  and  access  to  diversified \nmarkets  would  help  in  trade  diversification  and  could  catalyze  industrial  development  in  these \ncountries.  An  efficient  and  effective  customs  system  will  promote  and  facilitate  foreign  trade  and \ninvestment,  encourage  movement  of  goods  and  people,  and  promote  economic  growth.  Increased \nforeign  trade  and  investment  also  help  to  strengthen  the  current  account  and  the  balance  of \npayments. This process can be facilitated by encouraging more collaboration among the CARs, while \nsupporting  the  two  weaker  economies  more  directly  in  upgrading  the  systems  and  mechanisms  to \nposition themselves better for the growing competition.  \n \n44. \nIn  parallel  with  supporting  the  economic  restructuring  programs,  through  its  mandate  of \nregional cooperation under the RTFCCP, ADB will facilitate strengthening the COs' governance with \nthe objective of improving their efficiency and transparency, which are important determinants of the \ncosts  associated  with  trade.  Burdensome  and  redundant  procedures  have  given  rise  to  substantial \nuncertainty  and  are  often  associated  with  rent  seeking  and  corruption.  Minimizing  discretion  by \nsimplifying  the  clearance  process  as  much  as  possible,  including  thorough  adoption  of  international \nstandards  for  classification  of  goods,  elimination  of  most  exemptions,  and  providing  officials  with \ntraining  and  appropriate  ICT,  are  important  dimensions  of  trade  reform.  The  strengthening  of \ngovernance and modernization of customs will deter tax evasion and leakage in revenues as well as \nprovide  a  mechanism  for  monitoring  and  surveillance  of  illegal  flow  of  funds  and  goods  across  the \nborders.  Tightening  security  across  the  region  and  curbing  the  illegal  flow  of  funds  is  critical  for  the \neconomic stability of the region. Fostering adequate regional cooperation and ensuring that national \ngovernments  encourage  uniform  trade  practices  and  harmonized  legal  and  regulatory  trade  and \ncustoms  regimes  is  a  long-term  process.  ADB's  involvement  as  such  has  to  have  a  long-term \ndevelopment perspective, with the proposed RTFCCP making a beginning in setting the agenda for \nregional cooperation, working closely with partner member countries to continue to leverage change, \nand providing assistance to infrastructure development to support this initiative. \n \n45. \nThe  proposed  assistance  will  comprise  (i) loans  to  Kyrgyz  Republic  (SDR  equivalent  of  $15 \nmillion) and Tajikistan (SDR equivalent of $10 million), (ii) PPTAs ($500,000 each for Kyrgyz Republic \nand  Tajikistan),  and  (iii)  RETA  ($2  million).22  The  program  loans  will  assist  the  governments  in \nmeeting  the  structural  adjustment  costs  associated  with  implementing  reform  policies.  The  PPTAs, \nwhich  may  lead  to  investment  loans  in  2004,  will  give  customs  authorities  in  the  two  countries \nincentive  to  support  the  Governments\u2019  overall  reform  program  and  institutional  strengthening \nmeasures.  The  RETA  will  strengthen  regional  customs  cooperation  and  establish  efficient  and \neffective customs systems to facilitate foreign trade and investment. \n \n\n                                                 \n22  A chronology of processing steps is in Appendix 4. \n\n\f14 \n\nB. \n \n\n \n\n \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n1. \n\nObjectives23 \n\n \n46. \nThe  program  loans,  critical  components  of  the  RTFCCP,  aim  to  strengthen  governance  of \ntrade  facilitation  and  customs  through  a  set  of  policy,  regulatory,  and  institutional  reforms.24  Aside \nfrom benefiting from the regional cooperative solutions to governance through TA (see paras. 84-86), \nthe CARs have developed customs reform programs whose focus is being sharpened through CCC \nby  developing  country-specific  action  plans.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic  has  approved  a  Customs  Reform \nand Modernization Plan (2000-2004) based on the 30-point plan endorsed by IMF in 1999 and set up \na  Commission  for  Customs  Reform  and  Modernization  (CCRM)  in  October  2001  to  implement  this \nprogram.  The  Prime  Minister  chairs  the  CCRM,  with  wide  representation  including  aid  agencies. \nTajikistan has developed a 5-year customs reform program, too.  \n \n\n2. \n\nComponents and outputs \n\na.  \n\nCountry Trade Facilitation and Customs Reforms \n\ni. \n\nStrengthen COs and their Governance  \n\nThe RTFCCP supports rationalization of CO structure, strengthening of human resource policies \n\n \n47. \nincluding performance and incentive framework, and transparency of COs. \n \n48. \nReorganization  of  Customs  Organizations.  In  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  the  RTFCCP  focuses \non rationalization of SCI\u2019s organizational strategy and structure, and human resources development. \nIn compliance with the RTFCCP, in May 2002, the SCI developed and submitted for MOF approval an \norganizational plan that involves streamlining its headquarters and regional offices. The restructuring \nof SCI will further benefit from MOF plans to streamline and rationalize the functions of the different \nrevenue agencies including SCI, the State Tax Inspectorate, the Social Fund, and the Finance Police. \nA  working  group  has  been  established  to  examine  options  for  restructuring  and  merging  revenue \nagencies to improve their efficiency while promoting cost effectiveness. The Government will maintain \nthe  institutional  reforms  of  SCI  pursued  under  the  RTFCCP  pertaining  to  the  CO  and  its  inspection \nfunction within the overall restructuring of revenue agencies. \n \n49. \nIn Tajikistan, under the RTFCCP the Government issued a decree in January 2002 to create \nthe MSRD.25 MSRD has set up a task force to develop a corporate strategy to effectively merge the \ntax and customs offices and their functions. This strategy has now been prepared, and it recommends \nan  organizational  structure  for  MSRD  and  an  appropriate  staff  strength.  The  new  organizational \nstructure  segregates  the  functions  systematically  and  introduces  effective  checks  and  balances.  In \nline with the Government decree, the staff of MSRD will be reduced by 20% within 200226 based on \nagreed  upon  eligibility  criteria.  Additional  work  has  started  at  MSRD  to  review  the  system  of \nremuneration and operations budget. In addition to a user fee of 0.15% of customs clearance, there is \na proposal for MSRD to retain a higher percentage of revenue collections for its operational budget. \nThe proposal will be considered by the Government in 2003. \n \n\n                                                 \n23  The objective tree, based on program tree analysis is presented in Appendix 5. \n24 Development policy letters and policy matrixes are in Appendix 6.  \n25  Tajikistan  Government  set  up  the  Ministry  of  State  Revenues  and  Duties  by  combining  the  two  previously  separate \n\nCommittees for Customs and Tax in January 2002. \n\n26  Retrenchment  will  be  at  both  the  central  and  regional  levels  depending  on  specific  functions.  Currently  the  former  Tax \n\nCommittee has over 3,000 employees and the Customs Committee about 1,500. \n\n\f15 \n\n50. \nThe  reorganization  of  customs  in  both  countries  will  benefit  from  the  overall  public  service \nreforms  being  pursued  under  the  World  Bank-led  initiatives.27  Under  these  programs  the  two \ngovernments  are  implementing  reforms  in  public  administration,  civil  service,  and  financial \naccountability.  In  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  EU's  TACIS  sponsored  the  drafting  of  the  Law  on  Civil \nServants  in  1999,  which  will  be  further  strengthened  under  the  World  Bank\u2019s  proposed  Governance \nStructural  Adjustment  Credit  in  2003.  In  Tajikistan,  a  study  sponsored  by  the  World  Bank  has \nrecommended  the  establishment  of  a  new  Department  of  Civil  Service,  introduction  of  a  code  of \nethics,  selection  criteria  for  government  officials,  a  payroll  strategy,  and  a  model  manual  of  civil \nservice policies and procedures. ADB\u2019s governance assessments for the two countries have analyzed \nissues related to public sector reforms. ADB will build upon the substantial amount of work in the area \nof  public  sector  reform  achieved  to  date,  to  facilitate  the  acceptance  and  implementation  of \nappropriate  structures  and  policies,  and  to  integrate  its  recommendation  and  findings  in  the \nreorganization of customs. \n \n51. \nHuman  Resource  Development  of  Custom  Services.  As  a  part  of  the  RTFCCP,  in  the \nKyrgyz  Republic,  SCI  has  taken  a  concrete  set  of  policy  actions.  A  Concept  Paper  For  Customs \nReform  has  been  issued  that  provides  framework  for  human  resource  development,  information \ntechnology,  customs  operation  and  procedures,  etc.  to  implement  the  Customs  Reform  and \nModernization  Plan.  To  support  this  overall  customs  reform  agenda,  SCI  has  proposed  a  paper  on \nImprovement  of  Management  and  Personnel  Policy,  which  advocates  transparent  recruitment,  and \npromotion  policies  based  on  performance  indicators,  service  standards,  and  uniform  performance \nevaluation systems.  \n \n52. \nIn Tajikistan, MSRD has formulated a human resource development policy and based on this, \nintroduced  adequate  recruitment  policies  that  are  transparent  and  fair.  MSRD  is  developing  a  staff \nmanual including codes of ethics and discipline. By 2004, MSRD will have developed an operational \nmanual that lays down good business practices, standard performance, and service indicators. MSRD \nis  to  develop  and  offer  targeted  specialized  training  courses  with  the  support  of  the  PPTA.  To \nstrengthen the staff incentive system and morale as well as to promote integrity and honesty, MSRD \nwill adopt an effective customs staff incentive scheme, which, among others, will include introduction \nof a performance-based bonus system while introducing greater accountability. The Program supports \nthe introduction of a staff appraisal system including a human resources database, supplemented by \njob  descriptions  and  selection  criteria  that  objectively  evaluate  staff  competencies,  and  offer \nopportunities for career development and rewards for outstanding performance. \n \n53. \nTransparency  and  Accountability  of  Customs  Organizations.  To  enhance  transparency \nand  accountability,  in  the  second  phase  of  the  RTFCCP  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  SCI  will  publish  its \nannual  reports  starting  in  2003  and  establish  a  database  for  customs  services  information;  both  of \nthese will be placed on the website, which is already operational. SCI will be developing capacities to \nconduct  internal  audits  by  2003  to  ensure  its  compliance  and  accountability.  Together,  these \nmeasures  will  facilitate  improved  performance,  governance,  and  transparency  of  SCI  and  make  it  a \nstronger institution that can effectively carry out its mandate. \n \n54. \nIn  Tajikistan,  MSRD  has  established  an  internal  audit  department  that  will  conduct  periodic \nand special audits based on standard manuals. This audit will be complemented by a routine external \naudit  to  be  performed  by  the  Government  Audit  Agency,  which  was  set  up  in  April  2001.  Under  the \nRTFCCP,  MSRD  is  further  expected  to  establish  procedures  for  an  annual  customs  survey  and  to \npublish an annual report and make it available to the general public. MSRD will develop procedures \nand  crosschecks  to  detect  corruption  in  the  form  of  collusive  or  coercive  payments  and  will  prohibit \ncustoms officers from acting as customs brokers through regulations and disciplinary action if found \n                                                 \n27  Overall public sector reform is a critical component in the Governance Structural Adjustment Credit and the Governance \nTechnical Assistance Credit in the Kyrgyz Republic. In Tajikistan, the World Bank formulated and implemented a TA loan \nfor the Second Institution Building Technical Assistance Project in 1999. \n\n\f16 \n\nguilty. Lastly, MSRD will establish a transparent system for consideration of appeals and complaints. \nAll  these  steps  will  contribute  to  strengthening  governance  through  enhanced  transparency  and \naccountability. \n \n\nStrengthen the Legal and Regulatory Framework \n\nii. \n \n\n55. \nThe RTFCCP supports simplification of customs legislation and regulations and development \nof  a  harmonized  tariff  structure  along  with  some  adjustment  in  tariff  rates  to  eliminate  outstanding \ndistortions. Under the RTFCCP, the Kyrgyz Republic harmonized and simplified the tariff structure in \naccordance with the WTO agreement. The number of tariff bands has been reduced from six to four \nfor  2002,28  with  the  average  rate  of  5.07%  for  2002.  In  Tajikistan,  the  Government  has  adopted  a \nsingle rate of tariff of 5% except for preferential rates per treaties. \n \nKyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  are  committed  to  introducing  customs  legislation  by  2004 \n56. \n(conforming  to  the  revised  Russian  legislation)  that  is  compliant  with  the  requirements  of  WTO  and \nthe  revised  Kyoto  Convention,  and  unified  within  the  ECU,  and  to  establishing  a  common  external \ntariff by 2010. The customs codes will be simple and brought in line with international agreements and \nconventions. By 2004, both Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan will produce a procedural and instruction \nmanual  (consistent  with  the  new  Customs  Code),  and  regulations  will  be  developed  to  ensure  that \ncustoms officials can operate and process customs declarations efficiently and apply tariffs correctly. \nThe governments will need to establish procedures to ensure proper gazetting of legislation for public \ninformation  and  surveillance.  In  Tajikistan,  the  Government  will  draft  the  Law  on  The  Order  and \nConditions of Customs Services and determine customs legal status and introducing the principle of \nintegrity. \n \nIn  the  case  of  Tajikistan,  substantial  progress  has  been  made  to  identify  necessary \n57. \namendments to laws and regulations in conformity with WTO requirements, and to remove licensing \nrequirement  for  entities  involved  in  foreign  economic  activities.  This  licensing  requirement  was  a \nleftover from the Soviet time and it now serves no obvious purpose. \n \n58. \nThe  Tajik  Government  has  accelerated  the  process  of  negotiation  for  WTO  membership.  A \nworking  committee,  led  by  the  vice-minister  of  economy  and  trade,  is  preparing  a  memorandum  to \nWTO.  The  Government  expects  that  the  advantages  of  acquiring  WTO  membership  will  be  to  (i) \nencourage an inefficient state owned enterprises sector to improve efficiency and competitiveness; (ii) \nseek  a  mechanism  to  resolve  trade  disputes;  (iii)  help  find  a  solution  within  the  WTO  framework  to \ntransit problems with neighboring countries; and (iv) encourage the entry of foreign financial services, \nwhich  will  improve  Tajikistan\u2019s  service  industry.  Moreover,  WTO  membership  will  provide  Tajikistan \nwith a set of international standards and benchmarks for reforming the trade regime and customs. As \npart of the WTO application process, the Government has simplified customs tariff bands from six to \none band of 5%.29 The Government expects that the new tariff structure will be revenue positive in the \nlong term because it will simplify operations and improve transparency at the border. \n \n\niii. \n\nImprove COs\u2019 Operational Efficiency \n\n \n59. \nThis  component  of  the  RTFCCP  includes  a  wide  range  of  measures  that  involve \n(i) modernization of COs through adoption of ICT to effectively process shipments and to be able to \ndetect  and  combat  smuggling;  (ii)  development  of  customs  border \nincluding \nstrengthening  of  border  posts  and  processing  points  along  with  strengthening  of  clearance,  control, \nand  inspection  procedures;  (iii)  development  of  customs  intermediaries  such  as  brokers  and \n\ninfrastructure \n\n                                                 \n28  Four  bands  are  0%,  5%,  10%,  and  17.5%,  which  cover  51.9%,  1.3%,  42.2%  and  4.5%  of  kinds  of  commodities \n\nrespectively. About 0.1% commodities are covered by special bands. \n\n29 There will be exceptions such as for power transmission; countries that have preferential rates; exemption for international \n\norganizations; and imports of alumina, which is dutiable at 2%. \n\n\f17 \n\nwarehouse-cum-transport  operators  as  well  as  declarants;  and  (iv)  improved  coordination  between \nrevenue collecting agencies with the objectives of enhanced information flow and better collection.  \n \n60. \nDevelopment of ICT and Customs Infrastructure. Under the RTFCCP, with the support of \nPPTA  (paras.  76-83),  the  COs  in  both  countries  will  modernize  their  operations  through  developing \nand implementing an ICT strategy and automating customs operations. In addition, they will develop \nelectronic  links  between  revenue  agencies  and  MOF  and  law  enforcement  agencies  (in  the  case  of \nTajikistan)  to  provide  better  data  flow.  In  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  a  single  identification  number  will  be \nissued to enterprises for purposes of tax and duty payments, and the linking of databases will provide \nthe MOF with better information about revenue flows and will facilitate and support a possible merger \nof  the  administrative  functions  of  revenue  agencies  under  MOF.  In  Tajikistan,  MSRD  will  integrate \ncustoms  payment  operations  with  the  operations  of  a  single  national  treasury  account  to  prevent \nrevenue leakage. \n \n61. \nAnti-Smuggling  Drive.  Under  the  RTFCCP,  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  SCI  will  strengthen  its \nantismuggling unit though ICT and will develop databases with risk profiles of traders and enterprises. \nThe  unit  will  be  adequately  equipped,  and  its  staff  trained  in  new  techniques  of  vigilance  and \ninspection.  In  Tajikistan,  the  efforts  to  combat  smuggling  and  drug  trafficking  will  be  strengthened \nthrough  developing  databases,  sharing  information  with  other  agencies,  and  providing  adequate \ntraining and equipment to the anti-smuggling unit within the CO.  \n \nDevelopment of Border Infrastructure. Under the RTFCCP, with the support of PPTA, both \n62. \ncountries  will  develop  a  comprehensive  plan  for  construction  and  installation  of  customs  border \ninfrastructure,  including  basic  search  and  examination  equipment  at  border  posts  and  processing \npoints,  to  be  selected  according  to  criteria  agreed  upon  between  the  governments  and  ADB.  Both \ncountries  will  strengthen  postclearance  audit  procedures  based  on  risk  assessment.  To  further \nfacilitate  trade,  the  Program  supports  development  of  properly  supervised  customs  service \nintermediaries such as brokers and warehouse operators, and regulations and supervisory methods \nfor  intermediaries.  In  the  case  of  Tajikistan,  there  is  a  plan  to  establish  an  Association  of  Customs \nService Intermediaries, which will serve as a self regulatory organization. \n \n\nb. \n\nDevelop an Effective Mechanism for Good Regional Cooperation \n\n \nThe  RTFCCP  supports  the  development  of  regional  cooperation  among  COs  of  CARs, \n63. \nMongolia,  and  Xinjiang,  PRC,  to  improve  harmonization  of  regulations  and  customs  procedures; \nenhance accessibility and quality of information flow and data across borders; develop cross-border \nand  transit  arrangements  to  allow  cost-effective  routing  and  transportation  of  goods;  and  enhance \nsurveillance to address security concerns, drug trafficking, and illegal flow of money and goods. The \nRTFCCP  will  build  on  and  reinforce  the  current  regional  infrastructure  initiatives,  which  aim  at \ndeveloping  cost-effective  and  competitive \nthe  expansion  and \ndiversification  of  trade  and  markets,  which  will  in  turn  eventually  impact  a  change  in  the  industrial \nscene in the region. \n \n64. \nIn  collaboration  with  the  COs  in  the  ECA  region,  ADB  organized  a  CCC  meeting  in  August \n2002 in Urumqi,30 PRC to discuss a comprehensive Common Action Plan.31 The head of COs have \nendorsed  this  action  which  includes  seven  major  components  including:  (i)  simplification  and \nharmonization  of  customs  documentation;  (ii)  development  of  border  posts  and  facilities;  (iii) \ndevelopment  of  simplified  transit  systems;  (iv)  data  consolidation/information  sharing  and  ICT \n\ntransport  modes \n\nfacilitate \n\nto \n\n                                                 \n30  CCC  is  represented  by  heads  of  COs  of  a  larger  regional  economic  cooperation  program  of  East  and  Central  Asian \neconomies  being  coordinated  and  supported  by  ADB.  This  regional  group  includes  eight  participating  countries: \nAzerbaijan, PRC, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. \n\n31  See Board Information Paper, IN. 229-02, 23 September 2002 regarding the Regional Customs Cooperation Meeting and \n\ndetails of the Common Action Plan. \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\ndevelopment for customs operations; (v) development of risk management and post entry audit; (vi) \ndevelopment of a Regional Intelligence System Unit; and (vii) capacity building for regional customs \norganizations. \n \n65. \nThe  action  plan  provides  a  long-term  customs  reform  agenda  for  the  region,  which  is  to  be \nsupported  by  RETA  (paras.  84-86)  to  help  implement  the  first  phase  of  the  plan  over  the  next  two \nyears.  To  facilitate  implementation  on  the  above  components  of  the  plan,  CCC  will  coordinate  (i) \nsurvey of customs organizations to assess the commonalties and distinctions between the institutional \nstructure and legal competence of COs based on a WCO model questionnaire; (ii) survey of database \nand  existing  information-sharing  arrangements  and  the  level  and  type  of  computerization  to  help \ndevelop and pilot-test a model of a data exchange system; and (iii) compilation of number and types \nof  cross-border  posts  and  facilities,  determination  of  their  status,  i.e.  whether  they  are  unilateral  or \nmultilateral,  and  their  scheduled  time  of  operation.  To  implement  this  plan,  CCC  has  agreed  to  the \nfollowing institutional mechanism:  \n \n\n(i) \n\nWorking  Group  on  Simplification  and  Harmonization,  and  Strengthening  of  Customs \nProcesses  and  Procedures.  This  working  group  will  be  in  charge  of  implementing  (a) \nharmonization  and  simplification  and  harmonization  of  customs  documentation;  (b) \ndevelopment of border posts and facilities; and (c) simplified transit systems. \n\n(ii)  Working  Group  on  Customs  Control  Enforcement,  Risk  Management,  and  ICT \nDevelopment.  This  working  group  will  be  in  charge  of  implementing  programs  related \nto  (a)  data  consolidation/information  sharing  and  ICT  development  for  customs \noperations; (b) development  of  risk  management  and  post  entry  audit;  and  (c) \ndevelopment of a Regional Intelligence System Unit. \n\n(iii)  \n\nTask Force on Implementation of Pilot Programs for Development/Facilitation of Border \nPosts.  This  task  force  will  include  officials  of  Customs  organizations  of  member \neconomies  who  deal  with  cross-border  matters.  All  COs  that  are  interested  in  the \ndevelopment of cross-border facilities will join this group. \n\n \n66. \nUnder  the  RTFCCP,  like  other  ECA  members,  both  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  have \nendorsed  the  overall  framework  of  regional  customs  cooperation  initiatives  sponsored  by  ADB,  to \nadopt effective mechanisms for customs cooperation and conflict resolution, and to endorse efforts for \nregional harmonization of customs regulation and procedures in accordance with the Revised Kyoto \nConvention and other international conventions such as WTO valuation standards. Both countries will \nbe  requested  to  establish  standard  formats  for  databases  and  communication  protocols  for  easy \nexchange  of  customs  information  with  other  countries;  to  exchange  information  with  the  regional \ndatabase for the antismuggling and antidrug trafficking campaign; and, within the regional cooperation \nframework,  to  initiate  bilateral  negotiations  with  key  trade  partners  to  improve  bilateral  relationships \nand simplify procedures. \n \nC. \n \n67. \nbroad-ranging and deep implications: \n \n\nThe RTFCCP, ADB\u2019s first comprehensive regional trade and customs facilitation program, has \n\nImportant Features \n\n(i) \n\nFirst, RTFCCP aims to support the overall regional cooperation strategy of ADB and of \nthe  ECA  subregional  cooperation  program,  which  aims \ntransport \ninfrastructure  to  provide  effective  and  simple  corridors  to  facilitate  smooth  and  faster \ntrade  flows.  With  the  new  corridors  will  come  development  of  a  southern  route  from \nCentral  Asia  to  the  South  Asian  subcontinent  and  to  the  sea,  and  improved \ngeographical reach and access of the region to PRC markets, \n\nto  develop \n\n\f \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n19 \n\nSecond,  the  RTFCCP  has  put  in  place  an  institutional  framework  for  regional \ncooperation  among  COs  whereby  CCC,  with \nthe  political  commitment  and \nendorsement of the Ministers, will be coordinating all customs reforms and activities to \nintroduce better consistency among their policies, legal and regulatory frameworks and \ninstitutional  support  to  nurture  efficient  interdependence  in  line  with  their  comparative \nadvantage for better regional integration, \n\nThird,  the  trade  facilitation  and  reforms  being  pursued  are  aimed  to  help  countries  in \nthe  region  to  conform  to  WTO,  WCO,  and  other  declarations  that  prescribe  standard, \nharmonized guidelines and principles to promote open and free trade, \n\nFourth,  the  RTFCCP  aims  to  use  an  integrated  approach  wherein  the  country  policy \nreform initiatives serve national goals and regional cooperation at the same time. This \napproach  will  help  to  reinforce  and  create  synergies  between  country  lending  and \nregional advisory support to maximize economic and welfare gains, \n\nFifth,  the  RTFCCP  and  associated  investment  components  all  are  directed  to \nstrengthen  the  governance  and  integrity  of  COs,  without  which  the  sustainability  of \nreforms  and  investments  would  be  difficult  to  attain.  In  accordance  with  the  1993 \nArusha Declaration,32 the RTFCCP promotes the integrity of customs through a focus \non  introducing  clarity  and  precision  in  laws  and  regulations;  improving  valuation, \nclassification,  inspection,  and  customs  procedural  simplification,  etc.  (which  all  have \nbeen a source of rent seeking), and \n\nFinally, the RTFCCP further emphasizes automation, which is a powerful tool against \ncorruption, as it offers traders direct debiting capability to route duty payments directly \nfrom  declarants  to  the  revenue  banking  system  and  helps  clear  shipments  on  line, \nwhile allowing for detection, quantification, and correction of irregularities in the system. \nTo  reduce  the  opportunities  for  malpractice,  COs  will  be  restructured  to  segregate \nfunctions  and  to  allow  for  rotation  of  assignments  and  random  allocation  of \nexaminations. The larger ongoing public service reforms to strengthen recruitment and \nthe incentive framework in the countries along with the introduction of these integrity-\ninfusing measures will help create a credible custom \u201cesprit de corps.\u201d  \n\n \nD. \n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n1.  \n\nAdjustment Costs33 \n\n \n68. \nThe implementation of policy reforms will result in significant benefits from trade facilitation and \neconomic  growth,  but  not  without  adjustment  costs.  The  adjustment  costs  will  be  in  the  form  of \nseverance  pay  for  retrenched  customs  officers  and  workers,  and  associated  social  costs;  costs \nrelated  to  the  reorganization  of  the  COs;  costs  related  to  priority  capital  investment  and  capacity \nbuilding  of  the  COs,  and/or  additional  government  budget  allocation  for  effective  customs  operation \nand  improvement  of  remuneration  schemes;  and  short-term  revenue  losses  from  realization  of  tariff \nband in line with under the WTO agreement in the Kyrgyz Republic and the adoption of a flat 5% tariff \nin Tajikistan. The estimates in Table 3 show that the total quantifiable adjustment costs is estimated to \nbe close to $28 million\u2014$15.5 million in the Kyrgyz Republic and $12.5 million in Tajikistan. Precise \nidentification and quantification of costs is difficult since certain cost items are indirect or intangible.34 \n                                                 \n32 The Arusha Declaration concerns integrity and governance in COs worldwide. \n33 Excludes the funding required for investment in customs infrastructure, for which the PPTA will provide estimates. \n34 In the Kyrgyz Republic, new transport corridors from Uzbekistan to the PRC are being examined. Development of these \n\nwill add additional adjustment costs, but these costs are yet to be quantified. \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nTable 3: Adjustment Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nItem \nSeverance pay for retrenched customs officers and workers and \n\nKyrgyz Republic \n\nCosts related to the reorganization of the customs authorities \n\nPriority capital investment and capacity building of customs \n\nassociated social costs \n\nother than severance pay \n\norganization \n\nShort-term revenue losses from tariff band adjustments \n\nTotal \n\n0 \n\n3 \n\n2.5 \n\n10 \n15.5 \n\nTajikistan \n0.5 a \n\n  4 \n\n  6 b \n  2 c \n 12.5 \n\na  MSRD has reduced 20% of its custom staff. \nb  In  addition  to  budget  allocation,  Tajikistan  customs  is  allowed  by  the  Government  to  collect  a  user  fee  of  0.15%  form \ncustoms  clearances,  which  amounted  to  $1.8  million  in  2001.  MSRD  put  forward  a  proposal  for  a  higher  user  fee \npercentage to meet capital investment requirements. \n\nc  The average tariff was less than 8% before introducing the single flat rate of 5%. \nSource: ADB staff estimates. \n \n\n2. \n\nAmount of Loan, Terms, and Sources of Funds \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n69. \nTo support the implementation of policy reforms, loans amounting to $15 million equivalent in \nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  and  $10  million  equivalent  in  Special  Drawing  Rights,  respectively  are \nproposed from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, and will have a \nterm of 24 years and an interest charge of 1% per year during the grace period of 8 years and 1.5% \nper year thereafter. \n \nE. \n \n70. \nIn  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  MOF  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  loan,  and  SCI  will  be  the \nmain  implementing  agency.  MOF  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  the  implementation  of  the \nRTFCCP  and  will  ensure  that  policy  measures  are  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  upon \ntimetable, initiate withdrawals, and allocate counterpart funds. SCI will be responsible for institutional \nand organizational reforms. The Program will be overseen and coordinated by CCRM, chaired by the \nPrimer  Minister  and  comprising  representatives  from  MOF,  SCI,  the  Prime  Minister's  Office,  and \ninternational  aid  agencies  (IMF,  USAID,  SECO),  with  ADB  as  the  lead  aid  agency.  In  this  respect \nCCRM and ADB will have access to all documents and reports pertaining to all reform measures, aid \nactivities, and aid contributions. \n \nIn Tajikistan, MOF will be the Executing Agency, with MSRD, as a key policy-making body for \n71. \ncustoms operations, serving as the main implementing agency, supported by the Ministry of Economy \nand  Trade  on  trade  policy  issues.  MOF  will  have  overall  supervision  of  program  implementation, \nensure  that  the  reform  measures  are  undertaken  in  line  with  the  agreed  upon  timetable,  initiate \nwithdrawals under the loans, and allocate and monitor the use of counterpart funds. The Consultative \nGroup  for  Customs  Reform  and  Modernization  (CGCRM)  has  been  established  for  interagency \nconsultation  and  aid  coordination.  The  minister  of  state  revenues  and  duties  will  chair  CGCRM, \ncomprising senior officials from MOF, Ministry of Economy and Trade, the Finance Department of the \nPresidential  Office,  DCA,  Ministry  of  Security,  Ministry  of  Interior,  and  multilateral  and  bilateral  aid \nagencies. A program implementation secretariat will be (i) established within the MSRD to support the \nfunctioning of CGCRM, (ii) coordinate with these implementing agencies, and (iii) to provide periodic \nreports on the progress of the RTFCCP. \n \n72. \nThe implementation period of the program will be 24 months for the Kyrgyz Republic and 30 \nmonths for Tajikistan, and the utilization period will be two and half and three years, respectively. The \ncounterpart fund generated will be directed for budgetary support. The proceeds of the loans will be \n\n\f21 \n\n1. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\nreleased in two equal tranches. The first tranche will be released upon loan effectiveness. The release \nof the second tranche is expected before June 2004 in the Kyrgyz Republic and December 2004 in \nTajikistan  upon  satisfactory  completion  of  the  Program\u2019s  conditionalities.  The  policy  matrixes  list \nactions  that  were  completed  before  Board  consideration,  as  well  as  the  conditions  to  be  completed \nprior  to  second  tranche  release.  Whole  or  part  of  the  counterpart  funds  generated  by  the  second \ntranche release should be used for funding needs for Customs reform identified and recommended by \nthe  PPTAs.  The  specific  investments  will  be  agreed  upon  by  the  governments  and  ADB  upon \ncompletion of the PPTAs, prior to release of the second tranches. \n \n \n \n73. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  program  loans  will  be  withdrawn  in  accordance  with  ADB's  standard \ndisbursement procedures. Prior to submitting the first application to ADB for withdrawal from the loan \naccount, the Borrower will open a deposit account at the central bank into which all withdrawals will be \ndeposited.  The  deposit  account  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with \nADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook dated January 2001. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of \nthe  loan  proceeds  and  to  verify  the  validity  of  the  certification  issued  by  the  governments  with  each \nwithdrawal application. \n \n74. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  utilized  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs  (excluding  local \nduties  and  taxes)  of  goods  and  services  procured  in  and  from  ADB  member  countries,  other  than \nthose  specified  in  the  list  of  ineligible  items,35  and  those  items  financed  by  other  multilateral  and \nbilateral  official  sources,  and  imports  from  non-ADB  member  countries.  All  procurements  under  the \nloan  will  be  undertaken  through  normal  commercial  practices  for  the  private  sector  or  the \nGovernment\u2019s  prescribed  procurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB,  with  due  consideration  given \nto  economy  and  efficiency.  The  Borrower  will  certify  that  the  volume  of  eligible  imports  exceeds  the \namount of the projected disbursements under the ADB loan in a given period. ADB will have the right \nto  audit  the  use  of  loan  proceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  Borrower\u2019s  certification.  The \ngovernments  of  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  will  open  deposit  accounts  with  their  national  banks \nprior  to  loan  effectiveness.  The  deposit  accounts  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated \naccording to terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. \n \n \n \n75. \nADB will undertake semiannual reviews of program implementation and the progress of policy \nreforms.  Approximately  6  weeks  before  the  anticipated  withdrawal  of  the  second  tranche,  or  such \nother time as the borrowers and ADB may agree, a review will be carried out concerning the progress \nmade by the borrowers in implementing the policy reforms described in the Policy Letters and Policy \nMatrixes. \n \n\nReview \n\n2. \n\nV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nPPTAs for Customs Modernization and Infrastructure Development Project36 \n\n \nA. \n \n76. \nThe COs of Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan are inadequately computerized and lack customs \nexamination facilities,37 which inhibits efficient and transparent delivery of service and effective control \nwith  smuggling.  Reliance  on  manual  systems  also  constrains  customs  performance.  It  is  difficult  to \nenvisage significant improvements in performance in COs without the introduction of new procedures \nand controls that will require adoption of customs automation program. Existing limited computerized \n\n                                                 \n35  The list of ineligible items is in Appendix 7. \n36 The PPTAs were first listed on 18 April 2002 in ADB Business Opportunities (internet version). See Appendix 8 for cost \n\nestimates and the outline of terms of reference for the PPTAs.  \n\n37  For example, weigh bridges, examination equipment, and general border post improvement. \n\n\f22 \n\nsystems  have  been  principally  designed  to  provide  information  on  trade  statistics  and  revenue \ncollection for dissemination to other ministries. Neither country has an automatic customs clearance \nsystem and the import and export processing including declaration, inspection, and examination and \ntransit modules are not computerized. As a result, the speed-up of custom clearance is low or direct \ncustoms-trade interface is high. \n \n77. \nThe  COs  lack  funding  and  have  an  acute  shortage  of  professional  ICT  personnel  with \nanalytical  and  programming  skills  or  computer  system  developers.  The  customs'  payscale  is \ninsufficient  to  attract  or  retain  skilled  ICT  personnel.  Lack  of  computerization  is  inhibiting  regional \ntrade due to delays, increased cost of transport and clearance of shipments and inventory.  \n \n78. \nIn  addition  to  the  low  level  of  computerization,  the  communications  systems  in  Kyrgyz \nRepublic and Tajikistan remain poor. Communication with border posts is further implicated due to the \nmountainous terrain and/or to the remoteness of many border facilities. The telephone system does \nnot  provide  on-line  networking  provisions.  Poor  communications  have  limited  the  introduction  of \nmodern  ICT  systems  necessary  to  support  customs  operations  and  also  affect  administration  and \ngovernance because of the isolation of regional and local operations from the center. \n \n\n1. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n \n79. \nThe objectives of the PPTAs are to prepare feasibility and support the implementation of the \nreforms  envisaged  under  the  RTFCCP  and  to  prepare  the  investment  components.  Specifically,  the \nPPTAs will  \n\n  \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nperform  technology  audits,  conduct  needs  assessment  for  infrastructure  and  ICT \ninvestment and associated hardware and software needs, and identify the best options \nfrom a cost-benefit perspective;  \nprioritize  investments  based  on  needs  assessment  of  COs  for  infrastructure  and  ICT \nequipment at priority border posts and processing points;  \ndevelop action plans for COs' modernization;  \ndevelop  comprehensive  procedural  manuals  for  customs  staff  to  use  in  daily \noperations;  \ndevelop  procedures  for  intelligence  gathering  and  establishment  of  databases  of  risk \nprofiles; and  \nprovide  justification  for  investments  based  on  cost-benefit  analyses  and  financial  and \neconomic rates of return. \n\n \n\nCost Estimates and Implementation Arrangement \n\n2. \n \n80. \nThe  costs  of  the  PPTAs  in  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  are  estimated  to  be  $600,000, \nequivalent each, of which $500,000 equivalent is proposed to be financed by ADB on a grant basis \nfrom  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan,  including  the  entire  foreign \nexchange  cost  of  $335,000  and  local  currency  cost  of  $165,000  equivalent.  Each  government  will \ncontribute  in  kind  $100,000  equivalent  through  the  provision  of  counterpart  staff,  office  space,  and \ncontingencies. Details of the cost estimates are provided in Appendix 8.  \n \n81.  MOF in each country will be the Executing Agency representing the government. In the Kyrgyz \nRepublic,  SCI  will  be  the  implementing  agency  for  the  TA,  and  CCRM  will  coordinate  the \nimplementation. In Tajikistan, the MSRD will be the implementing agency for the PPTA, overseen by \nMOF.  Procurement  under  the  PPTAs  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement, and the mode of procurement will be direct purchase, as the total cost of equipment to \nbe procured is less than $100,000. The PPTAs are expected to be completed within 9 months. The \n\n\f23 \n\nGovernments of Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan have been advised that approval of the TAs does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \n82. \nThe TAs will each engage 8 person-months of international and 16 person-months of domestic \nconsulting  services  in  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  respectively.  The  consulting  teams  should \ncomprise  specialists  in  the  fields  of  ICT,  customs  operation,  civil  engineering,  and  financial  and \neconomic analysis. The terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 8. The consultants will \nbe  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  through \nthe  quality  and  cost-based  selection  process,  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  In  view  of  their  specific  and  detailed  nature,  the  simplified \ntechnical proposal format will be used. \n \n83. \nThe PPTAs will be implemented in parallel with the proposed RETA (paras. 84-86). As part of \nthe  regional  effort,  ADB  will  examine  the  existing  policy  environment  and  operational  framework \nrelated to ICT development for customs operations including Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan as pilot \ncases,  and  assess  current  practices  in  the  region  and  formulate  revised  processes  according  to \ninternational  best  practices  including  computerization  and  automation  of  customs  clearance. \nSpecifically, the RETA will provide necessary recommendations for the PPTA implementation teams \nin areas of harmonization of commodity description and coding systems; adoption of WTO valuation \nagreement  and  Rules  of  Origin  Agreement,  adoption  of  standard  and  simplified  procedures  and \npractices  under  the  Revised  Kyoto  Convention,  and  \u201csingle  window\u201d  and  \u201cone-stop\u201d  solutions.  The \nRETA  will  also  provide  recommendations  to  the  PPTA  teams  on  measures  to  facilitate  the \ndevelopment  of  efficient  customs  service  infrastructure,  enforcement  of  restrictions  and  prohibitions, \nenforcement of international trade rules, and increased customs integrity and transparency. Last, the \nRETA  will  help  the  PPTA  teams  to  develop  comprehensive  procedural  and  instruction  manuals  for \ncustoms  staff  to  use  in  the  daily  operations,  and  procedures  for  intelligence  gathering  and \nestablishment  of  a  database  with  risk  profiles  to  be  used  by  postrelease  audit  teams  and \nantismuggling units. \n \nB. \n \n\nRegional Technical Assistance for Trade Facilitation and Customs Cooperation38 \n\n1. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n \nThe  key  objective  of  the  RETA  is  to  strengthen  regional  customs  cooperation  to  establish \n84. \nefficient  and  effective  customs  systems  to  facilitate  foreign  trade  and  investment.  The  scope  of  the \nRETA, as agreed by the CCC,39 include \n \n\n(i) \n\nSimplification and harmonization of customs documentation. This component will \nexamine  the  core  competence  of  the  region's  COs  and  key  customs  procedures \n(transit,  end-use,  import,  export,  economic  zone,  post-entry,  etc.  as  well  as  national \ninitiatives for improving customs policies, and legal and institutional frameworks. Based \non  this,  RETA  will  provide  recommendations  for  improvement  and  simplification  of \ncustoms  procedures  and  will  streamline  the  organizational  structure  of  the  COs  in \norder  to  bring  them  in  line  with  international  best  practices  and  standards  throughout \nthe  region,  and  develop  a \nimplementation.  The \nrecommendations for revised practices and procedures will cover (a) harmonization of \ncommodity  description  and  coding  systems;  (b)  WTO  Customs  Valuation  Agreement; \n(c)  WTO  Rules  of  Origin  Agreement;  (d)  adoption  of  standard  and  simplified \nprocedures and practices under the revised Kyoto Convention; (e) single-window and \none-stop  solutions  to  expedite  customs  transactions;  (f)  harmonization  of  practices  to \n\ntime-bound  action  plan \n\nfor \n\n                                                 \n38  Listed  in  ADB  Business  Opportunities  (internet  version)  on  26  June  2002.  See  Appendix  9  for  cost  estimates  and  the \n\noutline of terms of reference. \n\n39  See Board Information Paper, IN. 229-02, 23 September 2002 regarding the Regional Customs Cooperation Meeting. \n\n\f24 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nencourage  the  development  of  efficient  customs  service  infrastructure  relating  to \nimprove  enforcement  of  restrictions  and  prohibitions;  and  (g)  international  trade  rules \nas well as customs integrity, particularly transparency. \nDevelopment of border posts and facilities. The RETA will support the review and \nidentification  of  posts  for  joint  border  processing  and  analysis  of  procedures  and \npractices at those border crossings. Based on this review, the RETA will develop (a) a \nblueprint  for  simplified  and  harmonized  procedures  and  documentation  for  border \nposts, (b) launch feasibility studies for joint border processing, (c) provide support for \ntheir implementation, and (d) develop agreements among customs that opt for the pilot \nproject. \nDevelopment  of  simplified  transit  systems.  The  RETA  will  help  (a)  assess  how \nsimplified  transit  systems  might  be  introduced  to  facilitate  transport  movements  of \nthrough-transit traffic while retaining appropriate controls; (b) provide advisory support \nto enhance the use of the transit-under-bond system (TIR carnet), under which trucks \nare sealed by customs upon departure and can cross several borders without further \nchecks  until  they  reach  their  final  destinations;  (c)  formulate  recommendations  to \nimprove  the  acceptability  of  the  TIR  carnet  at  border  crossings  and  for  removal  of \narbitrary transit fees on key transit routes, and develop modalities for improvement of \ncommunication  and  exchange  of  information  between  border-control  agencies  and  to \nimprove  border-crossing  facilities;  and  (d)  evaluate  the  potential  in  the  selected \ncountries  for  upgrading  their  transport  systems  to  multimodal  means  to  facilitate \ntransportation of goods and expedite border crossing. \nData  consolidation/information  sharing  and  ICT  development  for  customs \noperations. The RETA will help conduct needs assessment for ICT development and, \nbased  on  it,  prioritize  investment  requirements  and  determine  best  options  for \nhardware and software from a cost-benefit perspective. The RETA will further develop \na  comprehensive  and  flexible  technology  plan  for  a  customs  clearance  system  and \nmanagement  information  system,  and  migration  plans  to  replace,  reuse,  or  relocate \nexisting  assets  and  develop  a  model  procedural  manual  for  customs  staff  to  use  in \ndaily operations involving ICT. To support information sharing, the RETA will conduct a \nsurvey of databases and the level of computerization in each country, and, based on \nthat design a data exchange system taking national security needs into account. Also, \nthe  RETA  will  help  develop  protocols  for  compiling  and  utilizing  advanced  electronic \ncommercial  manifest  data,  working  in  partnership  with  industry,  while  coordinating \nactivities on data and intelligence gathering. \nDevelopment  of  risk  management  and  post  entry  audit.  The  RETA  will  assess \ncurrent  practices  adopted \nthe  national  customs \nadministrations;  formulate  benchmarks  appropriate  for  each  country,  derived  from \ninternational codes and sound practices (e.g., WCO, WTO, and International Chamber \nof Commerce guidelines, agreements, and protocols; revised Kyoto Convention); and \nstreamline the examination of documents and merchandise at the time of entry. It will \nfurther  support  institution  capacity  building  to  adopt  risk-based  post-transit  and  post-\nentry compliance audits and develop computerized models to analyze the \u201crisk profiles\u201d \nof shipments by comparing their details with a set of indicators and categorizing them \nas  either  high-,  medium-,  or  low-risk  transactions;  and  establish  standardized \nprocedures on post entry audit according to risk profile of the shipments. \nDevelopment of a regional intelligence system. The RETA will support (a) analysis \nof the nature and extent of illicit trade, including types of goods, production and trade \nvolumes,  sources  and  destinations,  channels,  and  modes  and  methods  of  transport; \n(b) stock taking of existing regional programs for intelligence gathering and sharing; (c) \nevaluation  of  performance  of  the  existing  regional  intelligence  system,  including \ncapacities,  effectiveness,  equipment,  intelligence  sources,  and  adaptability;  (d)  a \nproposal for strengthening the regional intelligence system including funding, schedule, \n\nrisk  management  by \n\nfor \n\n\f25 \n\nand human resource requirements, and (e) training of customs officers in tracking and \ntracing, etc. \n\n(vii)  Capacity  building  for  regional  customs  organizations.  This  component  of  RETA \nwill  support  a  wide  range  of  training  programs  covering  topics  such  as  the  revised \nKyoto  Convention,  customs  legislation  and  implementing  regulations,  harmonization \nand  streamlining  of  customs  procedures,  implications  of  WTO  membership,  post-\nrelease  audit,  risk  management,  risk  assessment  selectivity,  developing  a  database, \nuse of IT, electronic data exchange, institutionalizing cooperation mechanisms, control \nof illegal goods and trade facilitation and public-private sector partnership. \n\n \n\n2. \n\nCost Estimates and Implementation Arrangements \n\n \n85. \nThe total cost of the RETA is estimated to be $2,400,000 equivalent, of which $2,000,000 is \nproposed to be provided by ADB on a grant basis from the Bank-funded TA Program, including the \nentire  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $1,680,000  and  local  currency  cost  of  $320,000  equivalent.  The \ngovernments  participating  in  the  regional  TA  will  provide  $400,000  equivalent  in  total  through  the \nprovision of counterpart staff, office space, and contingencies on a pro-rata basis. Details of the cost \nestimates are provided in Appendix 9. The COs of participating governments will be the implementing \nagencies.  CCC  will  serve  as  the  policy  coordinating  body  to  provide  oversight  for  RETA \nimplementation, and technical work under RETA will be coordinated by working groups and the task \nforce set by CCC (paras. 63-66). \n \n86. \nThe  RETA  will  engage  international  consultants  for  45  person-months.  Specialist  will  be \nrecruited in the areas of regional cooperation programs, training, ICT and data exchange, transit, joint \nprocessing, and post-entry audit. A team of domestic consultants for a total of 60 person-months will \ncover  the  same  set  of  expertise  as  the  international  consultants.  The  terms  of  reference  for  the \nconsultants  are  in  Appendix  9.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  In  view  of  the  specific  and  detailed  nature  of  the  various \ncomponents  under  the  RETA,  specialists  will  be  engaged  on  an  individual  basis.  The  RETA  will \ncommence  together  with  the  RTFCCP  and  will  be  completed  by  December  2004.  Seminars  and \nworkshops will be organized intermittently during the implementation period to invite comments from \ninternational and domestic experts in the field and to disseminate the findings of the RETA. \n \n\nVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits \n\n \nA. \n \n87. \nCustoms have multifaceted roles and responsibilities. Through its direct control of the flow of \nimports and exports, customs helps to facilitate foreign trade and at the same time acts as the first line \nof defense of the economic interests of the country in efforts to curb smuggling. Customs is also an \nimportant regulatory institution with a key role in trade and investment facilitation and in private sector \ndevelopment, as well as in public finance and governance. \n \n88. \nAn  efficient  and  effective  customs  system  will  promote  and  facilitate  foreign  trade  and \ninvestment,  encourage  movement  of  goods  and  people,  and  promote  economic  growth.  Increased \nforeign  trade  and  investment  help  improve  balance  of  payments.  Proper  application  and  efficient \ncollection  of  tariffs  help  government  budget  and  fiscal  programs,  and  proper  application  of  tariff \nprevents  rent  seeking  and  promotes  market  competition.  Curbing  smuggling  and  drug  trafficking \nimprove  social  stability.  Better  regional  customs  cooperation  helps  realize  comparative  advantage \nthrough gaining access to regional and international markets. \n \n\n\f26 \n\nImpacts  \n\n89. \nThe RTFCCP supports the introduction and implementation of legal and regulatory reforms to \nfacilitate trade flows and to improve the climate for investment. Increased trade and investment, and \nprivate  sector  activity  will  contribute  to  sustainable  economic  growth.  Government  revenues  in  both \ncountries  are  comparatively  low,  and  collection  is  weak,  as  indicated  by  the  build-up  of  arrears  and \nthe low levels of collection. The RTFCCP supports policies and institutional changes that will set clear \nrevenue targets; simplify tariff structure to facilitate proper application of tariffs; and by computerizing \nthe  systems,  make  processing  of  declarations  and  payments  easier  and  more  timely.  Last,  the \nRTFCCP will help strengthen customs institutionally through organizational changes, recruitment and \npromotion  policies,  training,  and  automation  and  computerization  of  customs  operations.  A  more \nprofessional,  better  trained  and  equipped  customs  can  effectively  carry  out  its  mandate  to  promote \ntrade flows, collect revenues, and detect and curb smuggling.  \n \nB. \n \n90. \nThe  classification  of  the  RTFCCP  is  economic  growth  and  regional  cooperation.  It  aims  to \npromote  growth  by  facilitating  trade  and  investment  in  the  region.  The  RTFCCP  also  aims  to \nstrengthen  governance,  one  of  the  three  pillars  of  ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy.  Strengthened \ngovernance  in  one  key  government  agency,  i.e.,  the  customs,  with  which  enterprises  come  into \ncontact  should  bring  increased  public  confidence  in  that  branch  of  the  civil  service.  That  may  also \nhave a demonstration effect for the civil service at large, where reforms will be implemented with the \nsupport of other multilateral and bilateral institutions in both Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan. \n \n91. \nThe  goal  of  the  RTFCCP  is  to  promote  sustainable  economic  growth  and  raise  the  living \nstandards in Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and the rest of ECA through the establishment of an efficient \nand effective customs system to promote and facilitate foreign trade and investment. Supporting the \nobjectives envisaged under the Program will have positive indirect effects on the poor. The summary \npoverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  provided  in  Appendix  10,  and  a  poverty  impact  assessment \nfor the Program is in Appendix 11. \n \nSpecifically,  the  first  objective  of  the  Program\u2014strengthening  governance  and  transparency \n92. \nand  improving  institutional  capability\u2014seeks  to  strengthen  the  customs  authorities  as  institutions, \nmake  them  more  effective  through  rationalization,  and  institute  transparent  human  resources \nregulations.  In  addition,  the  COs  will  become  more  transparent  through  annual  surveys  and  both \ninternal and external audits. The policy actions needed to meet the objective are poverty neutral.  \n \n93. \nThe  actions  to  be  undertaken  under  the  second  objective\u2014strengthening  the  legal  and \nregulatory  frameworks  in  line  with  international  standards  and  conventions\u2014will  have  an  overall \npositive,  indirect  effect  on  poverty.  A  stronger  legal  and  regulatory  framework  harmonized  with \ninternational  conventions  and  standards  will  encourage  more  trade  and  investment,  will  enhance \npublic and investor confidence in these two countries, and will thereby stimulate economic activity and \nbenefit the poor and nonpoor alike. \n \n94. \nThe  third  objective  aims  to  improve  the  operational  efficiency,  promote  trade  facilitation,  and \nimprove  revenue  collection.  This  is  expected  to  have  an  overall  positive  indirect  effect  on  the  poor. \nImproved revenue collection will have a direct positive impact on the government budget and provide \nresources for fiscal programs. An increased flow of trade and investment following simplification and \nautomation  of  customs  procedures  will  also  have  a  positive  impact  on  government  finances.  Less \ncorruption will have a positive impact on prices. \n \nFinally, the fourth objective\u2014to develop a mechanism for enhanced regional cooperation\u2014will \n95. \nalso  have  indirect  positive  effects  in  the  longer  term;  as  trade  will  be  facilitated,  access  to  regional \nmarkets  will  be  improved;  and  the  resulting  increase  in  economic  activity  will  contribute  to  higher \ngovernment revenues and more employment opportunities, which will benefit both poor and nonpoor. \n\n\f27 \n\nRisks \n\n \nC. \n \n96. \nThe  RTFCCP  will  be  subject  to  various  types  of  risks,  including  political,  economic  and \nfinancial,  operational,  and  system  risks.  A  carefully  designed  regional  trade  facilitation  and  customs \nreforms  and  cooperation  program  and  its  proper  implementation  through  effective  institutional \narrangements will to a large extent manage and reduce these risks. \n \n97. \nPolitical risks stems from (i) resistance from vested interests and territorial interests of different \nministries  and  government  at  different  levels;  (ii)  complexity  in  maintaining  effective  interagency \ncoordination and collaboration; (iii) difficulties in maintaining a smooth transition and public confidence \nin the restructuring and retrenchment process; and (iv) delays in preparing, reviewing, and introducing \nlegislation. Political risks can best be mitigated by the commitment and support from higher authority \nwithin  the  government.  The  Kyrgyz  Government  has  established  the  CCRM,  led  by  the  Prime \nMinister,  with  members  from  all  key  government  agencies  as  well  as  aide  agencies  to  act  as  the \nsteering committee to oversee reforms to be undertaken under the RTFCCP. The Tajik Government, \nthrough  consolidation  of  fiscal  agencies  into  the  MSRD  and  through  CGCRM,  has  centralized  and \nstrengthened the functions of strategizing and implementing customs reform policies. \n \n98. \nEconomic and financial risks arise because (i) customs reform measures may not necessarily \ngenerate  more  collection  in  the  short  term  and  may  result  in  more  pressure  on  the  budget,  and  (ii) \npublic  finance  stress  may  crowd  out  necessary  investments  in  customs  modernization.  In  addition, \nprice fluctuations in the major export commodities of these countries may pose significant difficulties \nand  prompt  governments  to  take  drastic  measures  and  delay  customs  reform.  The  mitigation  of \neconomic and financial risks can be better achieved through ADB program loans in supporting budget \npositions of governments and boarder policy reform initiatives of the governments and ADB in areas \nof public finance and governance. While the short-term economic and financial risks can be mitigated \nthrough program loan support, the broader reform agenda of trade liberalization, public finance, and \nstreamlining of governance will have positive impact of investment flows. \n \n99. \nOperational and system risks arise from (i) lack of institutional capability for implementing the \ncustoms  reform  program;  (ii)  loose  control  and  malpractice  in  conducting  investment  activities  for \ncustoms modernization; (iii) lack of commitment to regional cooperation to develop mechanisms and \nagreements  to  facilitate  trade  flows;  (iv)  disagreement  on  and  lack  of  enforcement  of  reasonable \ntransit  fees,  and  sharing  of  data  and  information  for  statistical  purposes  as  well  as  for  efforts  to \ncombat  smuggling.  These  risks  can  be  mitigated  by  carefully  designed  TA  programs  and  project \nimplementation  procedures,  and  the  regional  cooperation  mechanism  developed  and  supported  by \nADB. \n \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the governments have given the following assurances, \n\n \n100. \nwhich are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe governments of Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan will fulfill conditions specified in the \nattached  policy  matrixes  for  the  release  of  tranches  of  the  Program  Loans  and  will \nfurnish  ADB  with  copies  of  all  documents  evidencing  compliance  with  the  conditions \nset forth in the policy matrixes; \nthe governments will ensure that the policies adopted and actions taken as described \nin  the  development  policy  letters  continue  in  effect  during  and  after  the  program \nimplementation period; \n\n\fthe governments will keep ADB informed of, and will exchange views with ADB on, the \nprogress, problems, and constraints encountered during RTFCCP implementation and \non desirable changes to overcome or mitigate such problems and constraints; \nthe  governments  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other  multilateral \nand  bilateral  aid  agencies  that  have  implications  for  implementation  of  the  RTFCCP, \nand will provide with ADB the opportunity to comment on any resulting policy proposal; \nthe  governments  will  take  ADB\u2019s  views  into  consideration  before  finalizing  and \nimplementing such proposals; \nexcept as ADB may otherwise agree, the counterpart funds will be used to finance the \nadjustment  costs  associated  with  the  implementation  of  the  reforms  under  the \nRTFCCP; and \nthe governments will ensure that counterpart funds generated from the second tranche \nrelease  will  be  used  for  investments  needed  for  customs  reform  and  modernization \nidentified  and  recommended  by  the  PPTAs;  the  specific  investments  will  be  agreed \nupon by the governments and ADB upon completion of the PPTAs, prior to release of \nthe second tranche of loan proceeds. \n\nVIII.

ADB  also \nsponsored  a  Central  Asia  Customs  Meeting  in  January  2002  to  discuss  the  role  of  enhanced \ncustoms cooperation. The agenda developed at the meeting has placed emphasis on regional \ncooperation through regional training. \n \n2. \nAgainst  this  broad  background,  the  governments  of  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Republic  of \nTajikistan  requested  ADB\u2019s  assistance  in  2002  to  support  customs  reform  and  modernization \nand strengthen regional cooperation. \n \n3. \nTwo  separate  teams  were  formed  and  the  reconnaissance  missions  were  fielded  in \nKyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  in  December  2001.

We  greatly \nappreciate the assistance from the Asian Development Bank in the ongoing economic reforms \nin Tajikistan. \n \nAs  a  result  of  the  measures  taken  by  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  for \nthe  economic  reforms  with  the  support  from  international  financial  institutions  there  is \ncontinuous tendency of macroeconomic stabilization and trends of economic growth observed in \nlast years.  \n\n \nHowever,  the  geographic  location  of  Tajikistan  and  existing  geopolitical  conditions \n\nrestrains in that or the other way the facilitation and expansion of the international trade. \n\n \nIn  addition  the  inefficient  customs  system  is  impediment  to  trade  facilitation  and \ninvestments,  accordingly.  The  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  recognizes  the \nimportant role of the customs in the development of a market economy and has adopted  reform \nand  modernization  plans  of  the  customs  services  as  part  of  the  overall  program  of  the \nGovernment in the structural reforms. \n\n \n \nA  proposed  special  program  of  customs  development  for  2001  \u2013  2005  is  focusing  on \nimproving  efficiency  of  customs  service  and  control,  strengthening  legislative  framework,  and \noptimizing  tariff  and  non-tariff  measures.  In  this  regards  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of \nTajikistan has already undertaken steps to strengthen legislative framework and to optimize the \ncustoms regime. The special measures recently taken to accelerate the process of restructuring \ngovernment fiscal agencies, which include the customs services, that covers computerization of \nthe  customs  services,  reduction  of  the  ministry  staff  and  development  of  the  mechanism  for \nrevenue collection for customs needs.  \n \n \nTajikistan to WTO membership and the preparation activities are actively done in the republic.  \n \n\nThe  acceleration  of  the  customs  reforms  also  interrelated  with  process  of  applying  by \n\nThe  Government  has  closely  coordinated  with  the  ADB  mission  and  other  donors  in \nformulating  the  Trade  Facilitation  and  Customs  Reform  Program  framework  and  hereby \ncommits to take all measures needed. \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\n47 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n \n \n \nThe  proposed  Program  is  one  of  the  key  pillars  of  the  broader  development  strategy \n \npursued by the Government which aims to foster trade facilitation and customs development, as \nwell  the  development  of  transport  and  energy  sectors.  Within  this  broader  mandate,  the \nProgram aims to promote good governance and the institutional structure that deals with trade \nfacilitation  and  customs  modernization,  and  upgrade  the  systems  and  mechanisms  to  position \nTajikistan better for the growing competition, and promote greater diversification in trade which \nwould eventually support a transformation of Tajikistan\u2019s weak industrial base. \n \nWe  hope  that  implementation  of  the  Regional  Trade  Facilitation  and  Customs \n \nCooperation  Program  (TFCCP),  prepared  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  will  promote \nestablishment  of  efficient  and  effective  customs  system  and  in  general  promote  economic \ngrowth.  \n \n\nHereby, the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan assures you that all the possible \n\nownership on its behalf on Regional Customs Cooperation Program will be adhered to.  \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nYours sincerely, \n \n \nAkil Akilov \n\n\f \n\nTajikistan: Regional Trade Facilitation and Customs Cooperation Program  \nDraft Policy Matrix \n\n \nProgram Goal and Objectives:  \nThe overall goal of the Program is to promote sustainable economic growth and raise the living standards in Tajikistan. An efficient and effective customs system \nwill promote and facilitate foreign trade and investment, encourage movement of goods and people, and promote economic growth. Increased foreign trade and \ninvestment help to strengthen current account and balance of payment. Proper application and efficient collection of tariff help strengthen government budget and \nfiscal programs, and proper application of tariff eliminates rent-seeking opportunities and promotes market competition. Effectiveness in combating smuggling will \nhelp achieve social stability, deter smuggling of narcotics and weapons, and allow domestic industries realize growth potential. Better regional cooperation through \ncustoms helps effective realization of comparative advance while gaining access to regional market and via proper transshipment arrangements. \n \n\nObjective \n\nActions Planned \n\nI.

The  program \nconsists of  (i) loans to Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan to support Trade Facilitation and Customs Reforms (TFCR); \nand (ii) project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) to Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan to support Strengthening \nGovernance  and  Modernization  of  Customs  Organizations;  and  (iii) regional  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Trade \nFacilitation  and  Customs  Cooperation  (TFCC).  The  objectives  of  the  TFCR  loans  are  fourfold:  (i)  strengthen \ngovernance,  transparency  and  improve  institutional  capability,  (ii)  strengthen  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  in \nline  with  international  standards  and  conventions;  (iii)  improve  operational  efficiency  to  facilitate  trade  and  improve \nrevenue collection; and (iv) develop an effective mechanism for good regional cooperation. There will a be significant \npossible conribution to reduce poverty in both countries. \n \n \nB. \nAnalysis: \n \nThe  level  of  poverty  is  high  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  the  trend  in  the  past  decade  has  been  one  of  increasing \npoverty. Since independence, per capita gross domestic product has fallen, standing currently at approximately $255. \nThe transition started with a prolonged recession during 1992-1995. Some reassuring signs of recovery were seen in \n1996 and 1997 as strong, positive growth was recorded. Most recently, the Russian financial crisis of 1998 led to a \nsharp increase in poverty. No data on poverty exists for 2000 or 2001, so it is not clear to what extent the Russian \nfinancial  crisis  has  been  surmounted.  However,  in  1999  it  was  estimated  that  close  to  two  thirds  of  the  population \nlived below the poverty line, and that poverty is largely a rural phenomenon with 80% of the poor living in rural areas.  \n \nThe  Kyrgyz  Government\u2019s  strategy  for  poverty  reduction1  emphasizes  creation  of  an  enabling  environment  for  the \nprivate  sector  to  develop  and  provide  employment  necessary  to  raise  incomes  and  reduce  poverty.  The  state  will \nfocus its efforts in the social sector, and to achieve this a significant improvement of the administration of the state is \nplanned  to  contribute  to  a  favorable  environment  for  private  investment.  The  proposed  Program  fits  well  with  the \npoverty reduction strategy in that it promotes a more efficient and effective customs administration, simplification of \nprocedures  and  processes  thereby  contributing  to  an  environment  conducive  to  trade  and  investments,  enhanced \nrevenue collection for the Government, allowing more resources for fiscal programs, and increased economic activity \nthrough improved regional cooperation.  \n \nPoverty  in  Tajikistan  is  a  multidimensional  phenomenon.  According  to  criteria  developed  by  international  and \ndomestic organizations, the proportion of the population considered poor in Tajikistan varies considerably from 95.7% \nto  16.9%  depending  on  the  poverty  line  used.  In  particular,  60%  of  the  population  consider  themselves  as  poor.  The \noutcome of the Living Standards Survey conducted in 1999 shows that poverty in Tajikistan is a rural phenomenon: 73% of \nthe population reside in countryside. Only 18.6% of urban population is considered as very poor compared with 23.4% of \nthe rural population. In Tajikistan children are more exposed to poverty than are the adults. The problem of street children \nescalated as a result of the last civil war. The probability for elderly population (over 65 years old) to fall into the category of \npoor is higher. Not only is poverty determined on the basis of income very high; poverty displayed by decreased access to \nsuch public services, as education, health care, water supply, etc. is also widespread. Economic and social problems as \npart of the economic transition also led to a weakening of the social protection system.  \n \nThe  official  unemployment  rate  is  3%.  However  a  significant  number  of  people  are  in  the  zone  of  hidden \nunemployment. According to some assessments, the unemployment rate is around 33%. Having a job does not mean \nless poverty because salaries are low and there are arrears in salary payments. However, it is believed that income \nfrom the main source accounts for only one third to one half of the total income. An accelerated privatization process \nis  critically  important  in  creating  employment  opportunities.  The  Government  considers  that  private  sector \n\n                                                 \n1  Interim National Strategy for Poverty Reduction 2001-2003, prepared by Kyrgyz authorities June 2001. \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\ndevelopment  to  a  large  extent  should  foster  efficient  utilization  of  the  labor  force,  and  development  of  small  and \nmedium-size entrepreneurship will have a decisive role in the development of the private sector. \n \nThe impact on poverty of each of the four main objectives is detailed in the Poverty Impact Assessment, but can be \nsummarized  as  follows.  The  actions  for  the  first  objective  to  improve  governance,  transparency  and  institutional \ncapacity in one key branch of the civil service can serve as a model for other state agencies and thereby contribute to \na  more  efficient  civil  service,  which  will  indirectly  benefit  all.  The  second  objective  will  strengthen  the  legal  and \nregulatory framework and if effectively enforced will facilitate trade and investments and through increased economic \nactivity  benefit  the  poor  and  non-poor  alike.  The  third  objective  to  improve  operational  efficiency  and  increase \nrevenue collection will contribute to economic growth, and a stronger government budget and benefit all. The fourth \nobjective  covering  actions  aimed  at  improving  regional  cooperation  in  customs  and  trade  will  in  the  longer  term \nstimulate trade and economic growth, benefiting the poor and non-poor alike. \n \n \nC. \nParticipation Process \nStakeholder analysis prepared:  \n \nExtensive consultations were held with the government agencies concerned, the chambers of commerce, transport \norganizations, private sector representatives, and international assistance agencies during project preparation. \n \n \n  \nParticipation strategy :  No. \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSocial Issues \n\nD. \n \n \nSubject \nResettlement \nGender \nAffordability \nLabor \n\nSignificant,  \nNot Significant, \nNone \n\nNone \nNone \nNone \nNot significant \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \n \nOutput Prepared \n\n \n \n \nIn  Tajikistan,  an  estimated  300  customs \nemployees  will  be  laid  off  as  part  of  the \nrestructuring  plan.

The proposed Regional Trade Facilitation and \nCustoms  Cooperation  Program  is  an  economic  growth  program  with  a  strong  governance \ncomponent that is poor-neutral in direct impact, but has pro-poor indirect effects via the longer term \nbenefits of enhanced trade and investments through an improved legal and regulatory framework, \nenhanced operational efficiency of customs, and stronger governance in one key branch of the civil \nservice. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nAs  of  1999,  the  population  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  stood  at  4.9  million.  Children  and \nteenagers comprised 38% while the retired (above the age of 60) comprised 9.2%. Sixty-five % of \nthe  population  live  in  rural  areas  and  the  rest  live  in  urban  areas.  Average  age  was  67  years. \nOverall, the human development indicators for the Kyrgyz Republic augur well for the future, and \nthe country has been able to maintain much of its social capital despite years of painful economic \ntransformation.  \n \n3. \nThe  level  of  poverty  is  high  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  the  trend  in  the  past  decade  has \nbeen one of increasing poverty. Since independence, per capita gross domestic product has fallen \nand  now  stands  at  about  $255.  The  transition  started  with  a  prolonged  recession  during  1992-\n1995. Some reassuring signs of recovery were seen in 1996 and 1997 as strong, positive growth \nwas recorded. Most recently, the Russian financial crisis of 1998 led to a sharp increase in poverty. \nNo data on poverty exists for 2000 or 2001, so it is not clear to what extent the Russian financial \ncrisis  has  been  surmounted.  In  1999  however,  it  was  estimated  that  close  to  two  thirds  of  the \npopulation lived below the poverty line, and that poverty is largely a rural phenomenon with 80% of \nthe poor living in rural areas.  \n \nThe  Kyrgyz  Government\u2019s  strategy  for  poverty  reduction1  emphasizes  the  creation  of  an \n4. \nenabling environment for the private sector to develop and provide employment necessary to raise \nincomes  and  reduce  poverty.  The  state  will  focus  its  efforts  on  the  social  sector.  To  create  a \nfavorable environment for private investment, a significant improvement in the administration of the \nstate  is  planned.  The  proposed  Program  fits  well  with  the  poverty  reduction  strategy  in  that  it \npromotes  a  more  efficient  and  effective  customs  administration,  simplification  of  procedures  and \nprocesses thereby contributing to an environment conducive to trade and investments, enhanced \nrevenue collection for the Government to have more resources for fiscal programs, and increased \neconomic activity through improved regional cooperation. \n  \n5. \nPoverty  is  not  a  new  phenomenon  for  Tajikistan.  Per  capita  income  in  Tajikistan  was  the \nlowest among the Soviet republics, with the highest percentage of the population living in poverty \nbefore gaining independence. The main reason of such relative poverty was the unfair economic \npolicy of the planning economy that did not take into account the comparative advantages of the \ncountry.  Since  the  collapse  of  economic  ties  with  the  republics  of  the  former  Soviet  Union  (FSU) \nand cessation of budget allocations from Moscow composed of 40% of the budget of Tajikistan and \nthe  lengthy  civil  war,  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  of  the  country  sharply  declined  and  the \n1996  GDP  was  less  than  one  third  that  of  1991.  Economic  contraction  led  to  the  large-scale \nrelease of the labor force, some in hidden form. Hyperinflation brought down the real income of the \npopulation, and increased inequality. \n \n\n                                                      \n1  Interim National Strategy for Poverty Reduction 2001-2003, prepared by Kyrgyz authorities, June 2001. \n\n\f72 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n6. \nPoverty  in  Tajikistan  is  a  multidimensional  phenomenon.  According  to  various  criteria \ndeveloped by international and domestic organizations, the proportion of the population considered \npoor in Tajikistan varies considerably from 95.7% to 16.9% depending on the poverty line used. In \nparticular, 60% of the population consider themselves as poor. The Living Standards Survey conducted \nin 1999 shows that poverty in Tajikistan is a rural phenomenon. About 73% of the population reside in \nthe countryside. Only 18.6% of the urban population is considered as very poor compared with 23.4% \nfor  the  rural  population.  In  Tajikistan,  children  are  more  exposed  to  poverty  than  are  the  adults.  The \nproblem  of  street  children  escalated  as  a  result  of  the  last  civil  war.  The  probability  for  the  elderly \npopulation (over 65 years old) to fall into the category of poor is high. Poverty determined on the basis \nof  income  is  very  high,  but  poverty  displayed  by  decreased  access  to  such  public  services  as \neducation, health care, water supply, and etc. is also widespread. Economic and social problems as \npart of economic transition also led to the weakening of the social protection system.  \n \nThe  official  unemployment  rate  is  3%.  However,  a  significant  number  of  people  is  in  the \n7. \nzone of hidden unemployment. According to some assessments, the unemployment rate is around \n33%.

An  accelerated  privatization  process  is  critically  important  to \ncreate employment opportunities. The Government considers that private sector development to a \nlarge extent should foster efficient use of the labor force, and development of small and medium- \nsize entrepreneurship will have a decisive role in the development of the private sector. \n \nB. \n \nThe  first  objective  -  strengthen  governance  and  transparency,  and  improve  institutional \n8. \ncapability  -  seeks  to  strengthen  the  customs  authorities  as  institutions,  and  make  them  more \neffective  through  rationalization  and  institution  of  transparent  human  resources  regulations.  In \naddition,  the  authorities  will  become  more  transparent  through  annual  surveys  and  internal  and \nexternal audits.  The policy actions needed to meet the objective are poverty-neutral (Table A11.1).  \n \n\nPolicy Actions in the Program and Their Impact on Poverty  \n\nTable A11.1: Poverty Impact of Objective 1:  \nStrengthen Governance, and Transparency, and Improve Institutional Capacity \n \nType of Effect \n\nChannel \n\nDirect Effect \n\nIndirect Effect \n\nMacro \n\nNonpoor \n\nLabor \n \n \n \n\nPossible \nretrenchments \nfollowing \nrationalization of \nresources for \ncustoms \n\n \n\n \n \n\nPrices \nAccess for Poor \n\n \n \n\nTransfers \nCrucial \nAssumptions \nTotal Net Effect \nNarrative \n\nStrengthened governance and \ntransparency in a government \nagency has a positive \ndemonstration effect on other \nbranches of government, and \nshould enhance public \nconfidence in the government. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nImplementation of the corporate strategy, human resources policies, and transparency measures \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIndirect positive effects \nThe actions to improve governance, transparency, and institutional capacity in one key branch of \nthe civil service can serve as a model for other state agencies and thereby contribute to a more \nefficient civil service, which will indirectly benefit all. \n\n \n9. \nThe  actions  to  be  undertaken  under  the  second  objective  -  strengthening  the  legal  and \nregulatory  framework  in  line  with  international  standards  and  conventions  -  have  an  overall  positive, \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n  Appendix 11 \n\n73 \n\nindirect  effect  on  poverty.

It is expected to have an overall positive indirect effect on the poor.  Improved \nrevenue  collection  will  have  a  direct  positive  impact  on  the  government  budget  and  provide \nresources for fiscal programs. An increased flow of trade and investments following simplification \nand  automation  of  customs  procedures  will  also  have  a  positive  impact  on  government  finances.  \nLess corruption will have a positive impact on prices (Table A11.3).   \n \n\nTable A11.3: Poverty Impact of Objective 3:  \nImprove Operational Efficiency to Facilitate Trade and Improve Revenue Collection \n\nChannel \n\nMacro \n\nNon-poor \n\nDirect Effect \n \n\nLikely retrenchment of \nstaff in customs \nfollowing automation \nand computerization \nof processes and \nprocedures \n \n\nLabor \n \n \n \n \n \nPrices \n \n\nAccess for Poor \n\n \n\nType of Effect \nIndirect Effect \n \n\nInitial reduction of \npurchasing power of \nretrenched staff.
