An \nundertaken. \n \nThe  Project  will  build  on  previous  health  sector  development \ninitiatives to continue reform of the Mongolian health sector regarding \nprimary health care (PHC). The Project consists of four components: \n(i)  strengthened  health  services,  (ii)  improved  health  care  financing \nand  health  insurance,  (iii)  improved  human  resources  development, \nand (iv) sector capacity development and management.   \n \nComponent 1 will strengthen health services through improving family \ngroup  practices  (FGPs),  soum  health  centers,  and  aimag  (province) \ngeneral  hospitals  through  infrastructure  upgrades,  equipment,  and \ntraining.  The  Project  will  also  strengthen  aimag  general  and  duureg \n(Ulaanbaatar City district) hospitals in Ulaanbaatar in their supportive \nroles  to  PHC.  Component  2  will  improve  health  financing  policies, \nincrease  health  insurance  coverage  and  effectiveness,  and  improve \nhospital financial management capacity. Component 3 will strengthen \nhuman  resource  planning  and  processes  and  develop  incentive \nsystems  to  increase  key  health  staff  in  areas  of  critical  shortage. \nComponent  4  will  improve  capacity  and  governance  in  the  health \nsector  through  increased  capabilities  in  planning,  monitoring  and \nevaluation, and policy development with a sector-wide focus. \n \nComponent  1  will  focus  on  five  aimags  (Arkhangai,  Dundogov,  Gobi \nAltai,  Sukhbaatar,  and  Tuv)  that  have  been  selected  based  on \npoverty  levels,  health  status,  and  levels  of  development  investment, \nas  well  as \n(Chingeltei  and \nSonginokhairkan)  having  significant  populations  of  poor  and \ndisadvantaged  people \ntent)  areas. \nComponents 2, 3, and 4 will focus on policy change and reform of the \nhealth  sector  system  nationwide,  including  health  financing  and \ninsurance,  human  resources  development,  and  regulation  and \ngovernance.  Assistance  from  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  is \nbeing sought to improve access to health services for disadvantaged \ngroups in Ulaanbaatar.  \n \nPolicy  reform \nimproving  PHC, \nimproving  financial  expenditure  for  increased  system  efficiency,  and \nimproving human resources (HR) capacity requires continued support \nand  attention  to  maintain  momentum.  The  hospital-focused  and \ninefficient  health  system  inherited  from  Soviet  times  needs  to  be \n\ntwo  duuregs  of  Ulaanbaatar \n\nin  expanding  and \n\nin  Mongolia \n\n(traditional \n\nin  ger \n\nliving \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nremodeled.  Long-term  support  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  has  been  successful  in  maintaining  the  momentum,  despite \norganizational, staff, and political changes.  \n \nDespite significant progress, further support is required to build upon \nand  sustain  reforms.  There  is  wide  disparity  in  access  to  health \nservices, quality of services, and health outcomes between urban and \nrural  areas  in  Mongolia.  There  is  a  significant  need  for  further \nupgrading  of  infrastructure  to  improve  rural  health  services,  and \nparticularly  in  aimags  which  have  so  far  received  little  or  no \ninvestment. \n \nThe  Project  will  build  on  the  policy  platform  established  by  previous \nthe \nprojects  and  continue \nGovernment\u2019s Health Sector Master Plan (HSMP) and in tandem with \nrecently  established  intersectoral  coordinating  mechanisms.  These \nnew initiatives indicate renewed commitment in Mongolia and greater \nlikelihood of successful project achievements.   \n \n\nreform  agenda \n\nline  with \n\nthe \n\nin \n\n \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project is improved health status and quality of life \nfor  the  population  of  Mongolia.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  is  PHC \nservices  that  are  more  effective  and  improved  financial  protection \nthrough health insurance. \n \nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $17.6 million equivalent, \nincluding physical and price contingencies, taxes, and duties.  \n \nThe Government has requested grant financing of $14.0 million from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  representing  80%  of  the  Project\u2019s \ntotal  cost.  The  remaining  $3.6  million  equivalent,  or  20%,  will  be \nprovided by the Government. \n \n\n \nProject Investment \nPlan \n \nFinancing Plan \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank  \nGovernment  \n\nTotal \n($ million) \n\n14.0 \n3.6 \n\n17.6 \n\n% \n\n80 \n20 \n\n100 \n\n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTotal \n\n \n \nADB  will  provide  a  grant  of  $14  million  from  its  Special  Funds \nresources. The grant will be subject to conditions set forth in the grant \nagreement.  \n \nUntil 31 December 2013 \n \n30 June 2013 \n\n \nMinistry of Health (MOH)  \n \nA project steering committee (PSC) has been established to provide \noverall  guidance.  It  is  chaired  by  the  State  Secretary  of  MOH  and \ncomposed  of  senior  officials  from  MOH,  Ministry  of  Social  Welfare \nand  Labor,  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  and  other  key  agencies,  as \n\n \nGrant Amount \n\nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nwell  as  private  sector  representatives.  The  five  project  aimags  will \nestablish  aimag  supervisory  groups,  each  chaired  by  the  aimag \ngovernor\u2019s  office  and  composed  of  representatives  of  the  health \ndepartment,  aimag  general  hospitals,  and  soum  health  centers.  The \ntwo Project duuregs will establish duureg supervisory groups, chaired \nby the governor\u2019s office and composed of the district health alliance, \ndistrict  general  hospital,  Ulaanbaatar  city  health  department  and \nFGPs.  The  PSC  and  supervisory  groups  in  project  areas  will  meet \nquarterly  and  be  responsible  for  providing  strategic  orientation, \napproving  the  annual  budget  and  activity  plan,  and  reviewing  and \nadvising on implementation progress.  \n \nA  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  will  be  set  up  in  MOH  and  be \nresponsible for project coordination and day-to-day implementation of \nproject  activities  including  procurement,  disbursement,  review  and \nmonitoring,  and  reporting  on  progress.  The  PIU  will  consult  closely \nwith relevant health facilities, agencies, and international partners. \n \nProcurement  of  ADB-financed  goods,  services  and  works  will  be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, \nas  amended  from  time  to  time)  through  international  competitive \nbidding, national competitive bidding, and shopping procedures. Any \nnecessary modifications or clarifications to the recipient procurement \nprocedures will be documented in the Procurement Plan.  \n \nThe  Project  will  require  a  total  of  57  person-months  of  international \nand  312  person-months  of  national  consulting  services  financed \nunder  the  ADB  grant.  The  international  and  national  consultants  will \nhave  expertise  in  (i)  PHC  services,  (ii)  public  health,  (iii)  civil  works, \ninformation  and  communication \n(iv)  medical  equipment, \ntechnology  network  development,  (vi)  health  care  financing  and \nhealth insurance, (vii) HR management and development, (viii) health \nplanning,  (ix)  private  health  services  planning  and  provision,  and  (x) \nmonitoring  and  evaluation.  Other  national  consultants  will  have \nexpertise  in  (i)  legal  issues  on  the  legal,  tax,  business,  and  social \nstatus  of  FGPs;  (ii)  web  design;  and  (iii)  gender  and  development. \nThe  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime  to  time).  Selected  international  and  national  consultants  will  be \ncontracted  individually.  The  remaining  international  and  national \nconsultants  will  be  selected  and  contracted  through  firms,  using \nADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection procedure (quality-cost ratio \nof 80:20), among short-listed international consulting firms. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  targeted  outcome  is  effective  PHC  and  improved \nfinancial  protection  through  health  insurance,  which  will  positively \nimpact on Mongolians\u2019 health status and quality of life, and especially \nin rural settings and in poor areas of Ulaanbaatar under the Project. \nStrengthening the FGP model will increase urban populations\u2019 access \nto  better  quality  PHC  services,  including  treatment,  prevention,  and \nhealth  education.  FGPs  specifically  benefit  the  poor,  as  more  than \n60%  of  clients  are  below  the  poverty  threshold  and  include  women, \nyoung  children,  and  the  elderly.  By  improving  rural  health  services \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n \n\n\f \nRisks and Mitigation \nMeasures \n \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n\n(health \n\nfinancing  and \n\nthrough infrastructure development, equipment, enhancing staff skills, \nand  increasing  the  number  of  key  health  professionals,  the  Project \nwill  benefit  rural  populations,  for  which  health  outcomes  and  access \nare poorer than for urban Mongolians. The Project will directly benefit \nalmost  700,000  people  in  the  five  aimags  and  two  duuregs  of \nUlaanbaatar (26.8% of the total Mongolian population). \n \nPolicy  measures \ninsurance),  capacity \ndevelopment, and HR development under the Project will benefit the \nentire population through nationwide components aimed at improving \nhealth  system  effectiveness.  The  Project  will  impact  on  population \nhealth  and  Millennium  Development  Goals  and  targets  by  improving \naccess;  increasing  service  quality;  facilitating  financial  protection  for \nhealth  care;  increasing  professional  capacity  development,  policy, \nplanning,  and  implementation  capability;  and  establishing  system \nregulation.  The  Project  yields  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of \n22.8%  and  a  net  present  value  of  MNT11.3  billion  (discount  rate \n12%). \n \nThree  potential  risks  have  been  identified.  The  first  is  reduced \ngovernment  support  and  commitment  to  health  sector  development \nand  reform.  The  Project  will  mitigate  this  risk  through  continuing \npolicy  dialogue  with  the  Government  and  donor  community  in  the \ncontext  of  the  HSMP.  By  building  on  the  established  policy  platform \nand continuing the reform agenda, the risk of diminishing government \nor agency commitment will be managed. Project involvement in such \nintersectoral  processes  as  the  joint  annual  reviews  of  HSMP \nimplementation,  National  Health  Development  Strategy  and  National \nPolicy  Development  initiatives  under  the  HSMP,  and  the  High  Level \nHR  Coordinating  Committee  to  strengthen  national  HR  policy  and \nstrategy will assist in maintaining government support and attention. \n \nThe  second  risk  area  is  related  to  slow  progress  or  resistance  to \nreforms  due  to  two  factors:  (i)  high  turnover  of  officials  and  senior \ntechnical  staff  in  key  agencies  as  a  result  of  frequent  leadership \nchanges;  and  (ii)  resistance  of  key  staff  groups  (e.g.,  hospital \nspecialists),  agencies  (e.g.,  State  Social  Insurance  General  Office), \nsectors (e.g., the private hospitals), and the community to change and \nreform.  The  first  will  be  addressed  through  close  monitoring  and \ndialogue  with  MOH  and  support  to  the  HSMP  Implementation \nCoordination Committee. The second will be mitigated through project \ninformation campaigns, awareness raising, and training. \n \nA  third  risk  is  MOF  resistance  to  single  purchasing  and  pooling  of \nfunds as a major element of financing reform. To mitigate this risk, the \nProject will promote pooling and single purchasing as measures that \nwill  reduce  transaction  costs,  conform  to  the  Public  Sector  Finance \nManagement  Law,  and  be  established  within  the  currently  available \nhuman and institutional capacity. \n\n\f96  00'Eo\n\n111  00'Eo\n\nR U S S I A N     F E D E R A T I O N\n\nM O N G O L I A\nTHIRD HEALTH SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\n\n50  00'No\n\nUlaangom\n\nUVS\n\nTsengel Nogoonnuur\n\nNaranbulag\n\nTes\n\nDayan\n\nBAYAN-\nOLGIY\n\nOlgiy\n\nDzavhan\n\nTudevtey\n\nZAVHAN\n\nHovd\n\nManhan\n\nDariv\n\nHOVD\n\nAltay\n\nYarantay\n\nTayshir\n\nHanh\n\nHatgal\n\nHOVSGOL\n\nTsagaan-Uul\n\nMoron\n\nAltanbulag\n\nSukhbaatar\n\nBULGAN\n\nSelenge\n\nSELENGE\nDarhan\n\nDARHAN-UUL\n\nHutag-Ondor\n\nErdenet\n\n50  00'No\n\nEreentsav\n\nBayan-Uul\n\nDORNOD\n\nHavirga\n\nZhargalant\nARHANGAY\n\nBulgan\n\nORHON\n\nSumber\n\nHENTIY\n\nChoybalsan\n\nTsahir\n\nUliastay\n\nHishig Ondor\n\nBattsengel\n\nAtar\n\nULAANBAATAR\n\nBatnorov\n\nBaganuur\n\nTamsagbulag\n\nTsetserleg\n\nHarhorin\n\nArvayheer\n\nTUV\nZuunmod\n\nNalaih\n\nMaant\n\nChoyr\n\nMandalgovi\n\nOndorhaan\n\nMonhhaan\n\nMatad\n\nGOVISUMBER\n\nBaruun-Urt\n\nErdenetsagaan\n\nBichigt\n\nSUHBAATAR\n\nBayandelger\n\nOVORHANGAY\n\nDUNDGOVI\n\nSaynshand\n\nAltay\n\nBayanhongor\n\nTogrog\n\nBuutsagaan\n\nGOVI-ALTAY\n\nChandman\n\nNariynteel\n\nBurgastay\n\nBAYANHONGOR\n\n42  00'No\n\nN\n\n0\n\n50 100\n\n150\n\n200 250\n\nKilometers\n\n0\n7\n-\n1\n6\n6\n5\n \nR\nM\n\n96  00'Eo\n\nTsogt-Ovoo\n\nDORNOGOVI\n\nZamyn-Uud\n\nSevrey\n\nDalanzadgad\n\nOMNOGOVI\n\nBayan-Ovoo\n\nGashuun Suhayt\n\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\nOF  CHINA \n\nProject Duureg (Chingeltei, Songinokhairkan)\n\n42  00'No\n\nProject Aimag\n\nNational Capital\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nMain Road\n\nProvincial Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\n111  00'Eo\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \n\n \n1. \nto Mongolia for the Third Health Sector Development Project. \n \nIn  2006,  the  Government  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  cooperate \n2. \nwith  the  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH)  and  prepare  the  Third  Health  Sector  Development  Project, \nbuilding on and furthering the results of the Health Sector Development Program  (HSDP) that \nwas  successfully  completed  in  2003  and  the  Second  Health  Sector  Development  Project \n(SHSDP),  which  is  ongoing  and  is  expected  to  be  completed  in  2008. 1  The  Government \nconsiders  improving  the  quality  of  the  health  care  system,  ensuring  access  to  and  quality  of \nprimary  health  care  (PHC),  and  reforming  health  care  financing  to  be  key  instruments  to \nalleviate  poverty,  accelerate  economic  growth,  and  reduce  disparities  in  the  development \nprocess,  particularly  between  rural  and  urban  areas.  The  Project  is  in  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s development strategy, and it is included in the ADB\u2019s Mongolia Country Strategy \nProgram and Update (2007\u20132009). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nIn  the  early  1990s,  Mongolia  inherited  a  Soviet-style  health  system  with  a  large, \n3. \ninefficient  hospital  sector  providing  generally  outmoded  and  low  quality  care  and  further \ncharacterized  by  poorly  developed  PHC,  financing  systems,  human  resources  (HR)  and \nplanning, and regulatory processes. Together, these factors contributed to the health system\u2019s \nrequiring overall reform and realignment. \n \n4. \nADB  has  cooperated  closely  with  the  Government  to  identify  and  implement  reform \npriorities, which are (i) to transform the hospital-dominated system towards PHC; (ii) develop the \ncapacity  to  plan,  finance,  manage,  and  monitor  the  health  system;  and  (iii)  upgrade  health \nservice infrastructure. In 1997, under HSDP, ADB provided initial support for critical changes in \nthe  Mongolian  health  care  system.  Key  initiatives  supported  by  HSDP  include  developing  the \nfamily  group  practice  (FGP)  system  (teams  of  family  doctors  and  nurses  providing  treatment \nand  prevention  services  to  the  population)  as  a  means  of  transforming  the  health  system \ntowards  PHC, \nlicensing  and \naccreditation, HR policy development (through incentive schemes and career support to assist \nin health personnel transfer and redeployment), management training, and emphasizing quality \nimprovement by establishing systematic improvement structures in the health sector.  \n \n5. \nSince  2004,  ADB  support  through  SHSDP  has  focused  on  improving  access  to  quality \nhealth  services  in  rural  areas  (through  infrastructure  improvements  and  providing  equipment) \ninclude \nand  extending  reforms \nconsolidation  of  HR  reforms \nthrough  establishing  career  development  schemes  and \ninstitutionalizing  incentive  mechanisms  for  rural  health  workers,  piloting  such  new  funding \nmodels  as  output  based  budgeting  and  case  mix  funding  to  increase  efficiency  of  the  sector, \nand  strengthening  the  capacity  of  the  MOH  to  undertake  sector  reforms  and  improve  the \nprovision of more effective health services at decentralized levels.  \n \n\ninitiated  under  HSDP.  Policy  reforms  under  SHSDP \n\nintroducing  regulatory  and  monitoring  systems \n\nthrough \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  1997.

Manila. \n\n\f6. \nAs a result of this cooperation, there has been significant progress in a number of areas. \nThis is evidenced by improved health outcomes with continuing decreases in important sector \nindicators,  including  the  infant  mortality  and  maternal  mortality  rates.  However,  major  reform \ninitiatives have yet to be fully implemented and to achieve sustainable impact. The FGP system, \nestablished  nationwide  in  2002,  is  the  cornerstone  of  the  reform  process  and  still  needs \nconsolidation and further investment, the hospital sector is still excessive and attracts the bulk of \nhealth  expenditure,  health  financing  mechanisms  do  not  sufficiently  target  efficiency,  HR \ncapacity and policies are still weak, and lack of governance and regulatory capacity has resulted \nin  unrestricted  private  sector  growth  and  ineffective  monitoring  systems.  An  overview  of  the \nMongolian health sector and performance issues is in Appendix 2. An assessment of the FGP \nsystem in Mongolia is in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n7. \nThe Mongolian health care system is in a critical phase. In many areas, implementation \nof reforms has been incomplete, resulting in initially modest results and transformations. Without \nclear strategic and policy directions and further targeted support, many reform initiatives are in \ndanger of drifting. The Government has endorsed a Health Sector Master Plan (HSMP) to bring \ntogether resources, policies, and strategies to guide the reform agenda, and there is recognition \nby international partners of the need to provide continued support to reforms.  \n \n8. \nThe Government approved the HSMP in April 2005. That plan was developed through a \nconsultative process, and it serves as a comprehensive technical long-term planning document \n(for  2006\u20132015)  in  line  with  Mongolia\u2019s  desire  to  achieve  the  Millennium  Development  Goals \n(MDGs).  Main  strategies  of  the  HSMP  include  (i)  further  increasing  coverage,  access  and \nutilization of health services, and especially for disadvantaged groups, through promoting quality \nPHC; (ii) strengthening health human resources skills and management; (iii) strengthening the \nfinancial  management  system  to  improve  resources  use;  (iv)  improving  the  health  insurance \nsystem; and (v) supporting a sector-wide health care approach to improve coordination of inputs \nand  resources  management.  Donor  support  for  the  Mongolian  health  sector  is  detailed  in \nAppendix 3. A timely opportunity now exists for the Project to consolidate reform initiatives and \nfurther develop and implement strategies to strengthen Mongolia\u2019s health care system. \n \nB. \n \nThe  health  system  continues  to  face  issues  of  low  quality,  inefficiency,  and  insufficient \n9. \nprogress  on  major  health  areas  and  service  delivery  modalities.  Key  problem  areas  and  the \nchanges  required  to  increase  operating  efficiency  and  performance  are  summarized  below. \nAppendix 4 provides detailed analysis of problems, constraints, and improvement opportunities. \n \n10. \nVariation  in  Health  Indicators.  In  important  indicator  areas,  including  infant  mortality, \nunder  5-mortality,  and maternal  mortality,  Mongolia  is  making  good  progress  overall  (although \nthe maternal mortality rate of 93 per 100,000 live births is still considered relatively high) and is \nlikely to achieve the MDGs and targets for child health, maternal health, and universal access to \nreproductive  health.  Within  the  overall  indicators,  however,  there  are  significant  regional \nvariations,  with  some  aimags  (provinces)  recording  rates  2\u20133  times  higher  than  the  national \naverage for maternal mortality. Aimag averages for key indicators are consistently poorer than \nthe  Ulaanbaatar  city  averages,  suggesting  significant  inequity  in  service  provision  between \nurban  and  rural  areas.  In  general,  the  rural  health  system  has  lower  quality  services,  less \nqualified staff, and lower levels of infrastructure and equipment.  \n \nLike  many  post-Soviet  systems,  the  adult  mortality  situation  in  Mongolia,  especially \n11. \namong  males,  is  deteriorating.  This  is  in  part  due  to  poor  lifestyle,  as  alcohol  abuse,  high \ntobacco  consumption,  and  high-fat  diets  are  leading  to  significant  increases  in  cardiovascular \ndisease,  diabetes,  and  cancer.  Male  mortality  is  also  significantly  higher  for  injuries  and \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fpoisoning, and the incidence of tuberculosis is higher in males compared to females after age \n35. Poverty is a major factor affecting poor health outcomes. Despite recent gains in Mongolia\u2019s \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP),  the  proportion  of  people  below  the  poverty  threshold  was  still \n36% nationwide in 2002.2 The links between pervasive poverty and disease are reflected in the \ncontinuing  rise  in  the  incidence  of  tuberculosis,  which  has  doubled  to  175  per  100,000 \npopulation since 1990. The major causes of death in Mongolia are now cardiovascular disease, \ncancer,  injuries,  and  respiratory  disease\u2014all  of  which  are  on  the  rise,  and  especially  in  urban \nsedentary populations. Diseases of the respiratory system are the leading cause of population \nmorbidity. \n \n12. \nLow Quality of Rural Health Services. The quality of rural health services provided by \nbag feldshers (community nurses) and in soum (administrative unit of the aimag) health centers \n(SHCs) is generally worse than are services provided in urban areas. This reflects isolation and \nremoteness,  scarce  HR  capacity  and  skills  in  the  countryside,  problems  in  attracting  and \nretaining staff, reduced training and continuing education opportunities, and lack of professional \nand  clinical  support.  Infrastructure,  equipment,  and  supplies  are  generally  of  a  much  lower \nstandard  in  rural  areas.  The  Government  and  MOH  have  developed  rural  health  programs  to \nupgrade  SHCs,  establish  regional  diagnostic  and  treatment  centers  in  three  aimags  across \nMongolia,  and  improve  communication  and  access  to  remote  consultations  and  specialist \nsupport.  The  Japan  Fund  for  Information  and  Communications  Technology  grant  project 3 \nassociated with SHDSP also focuses on improving technological capacity to link SHCs to aimag \ngeneral  hospitals  (AGHs),  with  an  emphasis  on  maternal  and  child  health  outcomes. \nNevertheless, rural health improvement still lags significantly behind urban health development, \nand Ulaanbaatar still attracts most of development assistance. \n \nPoor  Hospital  Service  Quality.  Services provided in aimag, duureg (Ulaanbaatar City \n13. \ndistrict), and tertiary hospitals are perceived as low quality by much of the population, evidenced \nby the rising numbers of affluent Mongolians (and the less affluent, who often go into debt) who \nseek  medical  care  abroad.  Many  reasons  underlie  poor  health  care  quality  in  Mongolia, \nincluding  limited  resources  for  staff,  underdeveloped  quality  improvement  systems,  poor \nmonitoring  systems,  lack  of  incentives  to  provide  better  quality  care,  weak  organizational \nprocesses, and under trained staff and managers. A range of financial and nonfinancial options \nare  available  for  long-term  systematic  improvement.  These  include  financing  systems  and \nincentives to improve quality and outcomes, strengthening quality improvement mechanisms in \nhospitals, better use of guidelines, strengthening monitoring, training, and more effective quality \nmonitoring and use of data and indicators for evidence-based policy making. Implementation of \nthese  kinds  of  activities\u2014many  of  which  were  proposed  under  HSDP  and  SHSDP\u2014has  been \nsporadic to date. \n \n14. \nInefficient  Hospital  Sector.  Mongolia  has  too  many  hospitals  (23.4  per  100,000 \npopulation,  compared  with  5.78  per  100,000  for  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States \ncountries),4 and  the  hospital  sector  consumes  the  bulk  of  the  Government\u2019s  health  spending. \nPublic hospitals and facilities in the capital city, with a population of around 900,000, include 16 \nclinical and tertiary hospitals and centers and some 46 hospitals of various types. There is also \na  large  and  growing  private  health  sector  of  hospitals,  clinics,  laboratories,  and  pharmacies \nconcentrated in Ulaanbaatar. There has been only limited consolidation of facilities over the past \nfew  years.  In  addition  to  surplus  capacity  and  staff,  other  shortcomings  include  inappropriate \nhospital admissions and clinical practices, an ineffective referral system, ineffective distribution \n\n                                                 \n2  National Statistical Office (NSO). 2004.

European database. 2005. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nof  limited  technology,  fragmentation  of  funding  sources  and  administration,  limited  use  of \ninformation,  and  rigid  planning  and  budgeting.  Adverse  payment  incentives  encourage \ninefficient use of in-patient services and hospital stays are unnecessarily long, averaging 9\u201311 \ndays.   \n \nRationalization.  Combining  hospitals  to  create  a  smaller  number  of  larger  and  more \n15. \nefficient  facilities,  closing  small  redundant  hospitals,  and  reducing  duplication  in  services  is \nnecessary  to  release  operating  savings  to  the  health  sector  and  realign  the  balance  between \nPHC (still underfunded) and secondary and tertiary services. The problem is larger, however, as \nhospitals  need  to  be  managed  more  efficiently  and  be  more  responsive  to  population  health \nneeds  and  morbidity,  with  beds  and  services  linked  to  disease  patterns  and  changing  clinical \npractice. Hospitals need to adopt more effective clinical and service delivery processes (such as \nday only and ambulatory care), admission policies, and treatment guidelines and pathways. This \nentails  a  restructuring  and  optimization  of  the  hospital  sector  that  is  focused  on  a  smaller \nnumber  of  better  equipped  and  functioning  hospitals,  based  on  health  planning  need  and \nassessments,  and  operating  under  modern  management  and  financing  systems  and  clinical \nprotocols.  These  are  considerable  challenges.  There  is  strong  political,  professional,  and \ncommunity sensitivity around reducing the extent of the hospital sector in Mongolia, and this has \nimpeded  efforts  by  MOH  and  international  partners  to  accelerate  optimization.  Nevertheless, \nwith  the  appropriate  emphasis  on  modernizing  and  improving  hospital  services,  and  on \nconsultation  and  participation  with  stakeholders,  negative  perceptions  of  hospital  restructuring \ncan  be  countered.  This  requires  careful  planning  and  organization  and  commitment  from  both \nthe Government and development partners. \n \n16. \nPoorly  Developed  Health  Care  Financing  and  Health  Insurance.  Mongolian  public \nhealth  care  expenditure  is  relatively  low,  at  around  5%  of  GDP,  but  increasing  funding  and \ninvestment  is  only  a  partial  answer.  Mongolian  health  financing  is  inefficient  in  many  ways. \nFinancial arrangements with hospitals are fragmented, funded from the government budget and \nhealth  insurance;  financing  is  not  linked  to  performance  or  efficiency;  incentives  are  perverse, \nencouraging  inappropriate  admissions  and  unnecessary  time  in  the  hospital;  costing  data  is \nlacking;  financial  allocations  favor  larger  hospitals  over  smaller  rural  facilities;  and  there  is \ndisproportionate  spending  overall  on  hospitals  rather  than  on  public  health  or  preventive \nservices.  \n \n17. \nThe  Government  is  currently  improving  health  financing  strategies,  and  a  number  of \ninitiatives are being reviewed with technical assistance support from ADB.5 These include output \nbased  budgeting,  single  purchaser  model,  case  mix  and  per  capita  funding,  and  global \nbudgeting and performance based payment and incentives. Despite relatively low expenditures \non health, the Mongolian health system has the potential to perform much more effectively, with \nimprovements to operating efficiency linked to better financing strategies and targeted funding \nbased on improving performance. \n \n18.  Weak  Human  Resources  Development  (HRD).  The  health  sector  HR  system  is \nmarked  by  oversupply  of  doctors,  low  ratios  of  nurses  to  doctors,  misdistribution  of  key \npersonnel  with  critical  shortages  in  rural  and  remote  areas,  and  poor  career  development \nopportunities. This situation is likely to further reduce quality and performance in the sector. HR \nplanning and policy capacity is weak, and there is little linkage of training and curricula to future \nprofessional requirements.  \n \nA range of HR interventions are needed, including (i) to control future doctor numbers, \n19. \n(ii)  incentive  systems  to  encourage  movement  of  key  staff  to  areas  of  need,  (iii)  career \npathways,  and  (iv)  HR  systems  to  promote  training  and  capacity  development.

Manila. \n\n\festablishment of the intersectoral High Level HR Coordinating Committee to develop integrated \nHR policies and strategies between government agencies and donors is an important first step \nin improving HRD in the health sector, and the potential now exists to address HR on a broader \nsystem basis. ADB is a partner in the High Level HR Coordinating Committee. \n \nLack  of  Capacity,  Oversight,  and  Regulation.  Many  of  the  problems  still  facing \n20. \nMongolian health care are the result of weak implementation of reforms and inadequate policy \ndevelopment. MOH and other agencies have insufficient monitoring and evaluation, regulation, \nand governance capabilities. As a result, overall policy directions are lacking and the regulatory \nenvironment  is  weak,  as  evidenced  by  the  uncontrolled  growth  of  the  private  health  sector. \nPrioritization  and  consistency  are  also  weak  and  limit  the  effectiveness  of  reforms.  The  FGP \nsystem is a case in point. The model has received insufficient priority and attention, resulting in \nunderfunding  and  limited  progress.  More  focused  implementation  and  monitoring  would  have \nobviated many of the problems now facing family doctors.  \n \n21. \nRationale  for  the  Project.  HSDP and SHSDP helped implement initial sector reforms, \ndevelop PHC, and improve infrastructure and service delivery. Nevertheless, further assistance \nis needed to consolidate and continue implementation of health reform in line with HSMP. There \nis wide disparity in access to health services, quality of services, and health outcomes between \nurban and rural areas in Mongolia. There is a need for significant upgrading of infrastructure to \nimprove  rural  health  services,  particularly  in  aimags  which  have  so  far  received  little  or  no \ninvestment. There is also a need to build on the policy reforms advanced under previous health \nsector  development  initiatives:  expanding  and  improving  PHC,  improving  financial  expenditure \nfor  increased  system  efficiency,  expanding  health  insurance  coverage,  and  improving  HR \ncapacity. Policy reform in these areas requires continual support and attention for a number of \nreasons. First, the entrenched structure and processes of health systems like that of Mongolia, \nwhich were strongly influenced by the Semashko model,6 need comprehensive reengineering to \nmake  them  efficient  and  effective  in  addressing  health  needs  generally  and  needs  of \ndisadvantaged7 groups and the poor in particular. Second, rapid and high turnover of staff in key \nroles and positions makes continuity difficult. Third, effective change needs targeted incentives, \nand these are not always available or readily applicable. Finally, change invariably encounters \nresistance  from  affected  or  threatened  parties,  which  impedes  the  progress  of  reforms. \nContinuity of policy reforms among HSDP, SHSDP, and the Project is illustrated in Appendix 5.  \n \n22. \nLessons. Key lessons have been identified from previous assistance activities: (i) health \nfinancing  and  service  delivery  improvements  need  to  be  linked;  (ii)  incentives  are  needed  to \nensure  health  service  quality  and  optimum  staffing  levels  nationwide;  (iii)  financial  allocations \nneed to support reform programs (e.g., adequate investment and funding is needed for PHC); \n(iv) structures and organizational processes need to be institutionalized in the appropriate key \nagencies  (through,  for  example,  dedicated  foci  and  personnel  in  critical  areas  like  FGPs  and \nquality \ninterventions  and  effective \nimplementation  of  reforms;  (v)  rural  health  services  need  to  be  strengthened  and  at  the  same \ntime  refocused;  and  (vi)  public  information  and  awareness  needs  to  be  extended  to  ensure \ncommunity  support  and  promote  healthy  lifestyles.  Lessons  from  HSDP  and  SHSDP  are \nsummarized in Supplementary Appendix B. \n\nto  ensure  consistent  and \n\nimprovement) \n\nfocused \n\n                                                 \n6  The  Semashko  model  was  a  Soviet-style  centralized,  hierarchical  health  system  with  strong  emphasis  on \n\nexpensive curative services and hospital-based physicians in extensive and numerous facilities. \n\n7  The use of the term \u201cvulnerable\u201d has been avoided since according to current government policy \u201cvulnerability\u201d is a \nclassification used for various state benefits and is not necessarily linked to poverty criteria. It includes all citizens \nregardless  of  socioeconomic  status  who  are  under  16  years  of  age,  all  mothers  of  newborn  infants,  all  elderly \npeople,  all  unemployed  people,  and  all  single  parents.  It  excludes  unregistered  urban  residents,  students  (about \ntwo  thirds  of  whom  come  from  outside  Ulaanbaatar),  and  herders.  Disadvantaged  people  include  overlapping \ngroups such as the poor, unregistered migrants, uninsured, informal sector community  members, and individuals \nwith special needs (disabled, single-headed families, elderly without pension, homeless, and street children).  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nA. \n \nThe impact of the Project is improved health status and quality of life for the population \n23. \nof Mongolia. The outcome of the Project is PHC services that are more effective and improved \nfinancial protection through health insurance. \n \nB. \n \n24. \nThe Project has four components: (i) strengthened health services, (ii) improved health \ncare financing and health insurance, (iii) improved HRD, and (iv) sector capacity development \nand  management.  The  four  components  are  in  line  with  specific  strategies  of  the  HSMP  as \noutlined under each component. Component 1 will focus on five aimags (Arkhangai, Dundogov, \nGobi  Altai,  Sukhbaatar,  and  Tuv)  that  have  been  selected  based  on  poverty  levels,  health \nstatus, and levels of development investment, and two duuregs of Ulaanbaatar (Chingeltei and \nSonginokhairkan), each with significant populations of poor and disadvantaged people living in \nger (traditional tent) areas. Profiles of the project aimags are in Appendix 6 and Supplementary \nAppendix C. Components 2, 3, and 4 will focus on policy change and reform of the health sector \nsystem  nationwide,  including  health  financing  and  insurance,  HR,  and  regulation  and \ngovernance.  Service  delivery  and  HR  initiatives  under  Components  1  and  3  will  also  have \nnationwide  impact  on  PHC  policy,  for  example  in  improvements  to  FGPs  and  for  reform \nnationwide (e.g., in improving staffing in rural areas). \n \nThe Project was designed through extensive consultation with stakeholders from public, \n25. \nprivate, and nongovernmental sectors at the central and local levels. The Project will implement \nparticipatory  mechanisms  at  PHC  (e.g.,  community  consultation  in  management  of  health \nfacilities  and  services,  social  workers  linking  disadvantaged  groups  to  health  personnel)  and \nhospital  levels  (e.g.,  establishment  of  hospital  boards,  development  of  complaints  and \ncommunication  processes  between  health  facilities  and  the  population)  to  promote  greater \ncommunity involvement in overseeing health facilities and improve transparency of the sector. \n \n\n1. \n\nComponent 1: Strengthened Health Services \n\n  \n26. \nComponent 1 supports two strategies of the HSMP: (i) increase coverage, access, and \nutilization  of  health  services,  especially  for  mothers  and  children,  the  poor,  and  other \ndisadvantaged  groups;  and  (ii)  strengthen  the  delivery  of  quality  primary  and  general  care \nthrough soum health facilities and FGPs.8 \n \n27. \nStrengthened  FGPs.  The  FGP  system,  established  in  1999\u20132001  under  HSDP, \nrequires further institutional and financial reforms to consolidate the model and to make family \ndoctors attractive and sustainable long term as the first level of PHC. The Project will build two \nnew  FGPs,  and  upgrade  the  equipment  of  60 FGP  clinics.  The  Project  will  analyze  and  make \nrecommendations on issues related to the legal, tax, business, and social status of FGPs. The \nProject  will  study  and  advise  on  how  to  improve  (i)  FGP  gatekeeping  function  (ensuring  that \n\n                                                 \n8  Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction funding is being sought to improve access to health services for disadvantaged \ngroups  in  Ulaanbaatar.  That  proposed  project  has  been  designed  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  HSMP.  It  will \nanalyze constraints and test demand-driven schemes to improve access to health services. The proposed project \nwill  support  the  present  Project  by  demonstrating  improved  health  service  models  to  increase  access  for  urban \ndisadvantaged groups, in particular poor unregistered and uninsured citizens and, hence, will feed into the broader \npolicy objectives of this Project. The poor comprise about 27% of the population of Ulaanbaatar (World Bank 2006) \nand are concentrated in disadvantaged peri-urban areas of the city populated mainly by migrants from rural areas. \nA large proportion of new migrants are unemployed, unregistered, and uninsured for ill health. \n\n\fpatients  will  consult  their  FGPs  prior  to  seeking  care  at  hospital  level),  (ii)  risk-adjusted \ncapitation payment, (iii) basic diagnostic testing, and (iv) drug supply in FGPs. The Project will \nstrengthen  advocacy  and  public  information  on  family  doctors  through  national  information \ncampaigns;  organize  a  study  tour  on  FGPs  for  decision  makers;  and  train  local  government \nagency staff, who interact with the family doctors, on how best to support the FGP model. The \nProject  will  support  the  Department  of  General  Practice  at  the  Health  Sciences  University  of \nMongolia in providing postgraduate education of family doctors and the Ulaanbaatar City Health \nDepartment in providing in-service training to FGPs. \n \nStrengthened  SHCs  in  Providing  Primary  Care.  The  Project  will  construct  15  new \n28. \nSHCs, upgrade infrastructure in four SHCs, and establish 20 wells at SHC level. The Project will \nalso  provide  medical  equipment  to  around  90  SHCs  and  basic  laboratory  technology  to  about \n100  SHCs.  The  Project  will  provide  training  for  SHC  staff  (doctors,  nurses,  feldshers)  in  PHC, \ndisease surveillance, chronic diseases, and health promotion. The Project will study and make \nrecommendations  on  realigning  SHCs  towards  PHC  with  less  reliance  on  in-patient  services \nand  more  emphasis  on  outreach,  home  services,  and  prevention.  The  reorganization  of  soum \nhospitals to improve rural health service delivery is in Supplementary Appendix D. The Project \nwill improve electronic communication between SHCs and AGHs to allow remote consultations \nand  transfer  of  data  and  educational  material  by  providing  hardware,  software,  and  training. \nWith the strengthened focus on SHCs and FGP, per capita expenditures on PHC will increase \nto $17 in 2013. \n \n29. \nDistrict and Aimag General Hospitals. The Project will upgrade infrastructure in three \nAGHs and equip five AGHs and two duureg hospitals. The Project will also renovate and equip \ntraining  facilities  in  five  AGHs  and  two  district  hospitals  to  support  FGPs  and  soum  health \nworkers\u2019 continuous training. The Project will establish linkages between FGPs and district and \naimag  general  hospitals  by  supporting  continuous  medical  education  and  clinical  rotation \nprograms  for  FGPs  and  soum  doctors,  enhancing  electronic  consultation  and  communication \nwith  hospital  specialists,  and  developing  incentive  mechanisms  for  AGHs  and  district  staff  to \nsupport FGPs and SHCs. \n \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2: Improved Health Care Financing and Health Insurance \n\n   \nComponent 2 supports two strategies of the HSMP: (i) strengthen financial management \n30. \nsystem  to  improve  the  efficient  and  effective  use  of  health  sector  financial  and  related \nresources, and (ii) strengthen the health insurance system. \n \nHealth  Resource  Allocation  and  Purchasing.  The  Project  will  design  and  reach \n31. \nconsensus among primarily the MOH, Ministry of Finance (MOF), and Ministry of Social Welfare \nand  Labor  (MSWL)  on  the  status,  organizational  structure,  responsibilities,  management \nsystems,  and  processes  necessary  to  establish  and  operate  a  single  purchaser  and  to  pool \nfunds  from  the  Government\u2019s  budget  and  health  insurance.  The  alignment  of  the  single \npurchaser model with the current budget and health insurance systems will be clarified. Results \nof the new model will be carefully monitored and a contingency plan will be in place in case the \nnew financing system is not successful. The Project will facilitate contracting arrangements with \nhospitals to help raise health care quality standards and efficiency in hospitals. The Project will \nundertake the necessary HRD and institutional capacity development to test and implement the \nsingle purchaser model and organize a study tour on single purchasing for decision makers. \n \nImproved  Financial  Protection  and  Expanded  Health  Insurance  Coverage.  The \n32. \nProject  will  focus  on  expanding  health  insurance  coverage  (to  attain  85%  coverage  by  2013) \nand  benefits.  Currently,  health  insurance  cover  in  Mongolia  is  declining  and  there  are  few \nincentives and programs to extend  health insurance to the informal sector or to the uninsured \npopulation. This presents significant access barriers, especially for the poor and disadvantaged. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fThe Project will study the uninsured population, the extent of financial barriers, and the effects \nimplications  of  out-of-pocket  payments.  The  Project  will  develop  options  and \nand \nimplementation  mechanisms  to  establish  a  financially  independent  health  insurance  system, \nincrease  contributions  (including  from  the  informal  sector),  promote  participation  in  health \ninsurance, subsidize disadvantaged populations, and optimize benefit packages. The potential \nfor  increased  private  health  insurance,  along  with  more  effective  state  regulation,  will  be \nreviewed under the Project. Health care financing and health insurance issues are presented in \ndetail in Supplementary Appendix E. A description of major Mongolian health laws and policies \nand considerations for the Project is in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n33. \nImproved  Hospital  Financial  Efficiency.  Public  hospitals  represent  nearly  60%  of \ngovernment  health  expenditures  and  show  poor  results.  The  Project  will  develop  options  to \nintroduce  market  elements  (management  performance  contracts,  pricing  flexibility,  and \nincentives) in hospital service provision in order to increase competition among hospitals. The \nProject  will  also  review  and  recommend  to  MOH  measures  to  increase  hospital  financial \nautonomy  by,  among  others,  establishing  hospital  and/or  health  boards  for  improving \ngovernance and efficiency while increasing consumers\u2019 participation in line with the HSMP. The \nProject  will  raise  awareness  among  public  financial  specialists  and  managers  on  hospital \nfinancial  efficiency  (e.g.,  linking  budget  and  performance,  incentive  mechanisms)  and  develop \nand conduct training to improve the efficiency of hospital finance and management. \n \n\n3. \n\nComponent 3: Improved Human Resources Development  \n\n \n34. \nComponent  3  supports  two  strategies  of  the  HSMP:  (i)  strengthen  human  resource \nmanagement sector wide, and (ii) further develop the incentives and motivation scheme for all \nhealth workers in the sector. \n \n35. \nImproved Health HR Management. The Project will develop workforce models to guide \nstaff numbers, competencies, and organizational structures; assist in career development; and \ntrain  health  sector  HR  staff  to  institutionalize  HR  capacity.  The  Project  will  provide  technical \nsupport  to  the  secretariat  of  the  High  Level  HR  Coordinating  Committee,  which  is  developing \nstrategic  human  resource  development  initiatives.  These  measures  will  impact  on  the  entire \nhealth sector by increasing training places and numbers of such key personnel as nurses and \nfeldshers,  realigning  nurse-doctor  ratios,  and  enhancing  career  development  opportunities  in \nhealth to achieve a better balanced workforce. The Project will also assist in consolidating family \nmedicine as a clinical specialty. \n \nIncentives  to  Improve  Rural  Health  Care.  There  are  critical  shortages  of  key  health \n36. \npersonnel  in  rural  areas  while  poor  career  development  opportunities  and  incentives  deter \nhealth professionals from working in the countryside. Through applied research, the Project will \nidentify  the  main  drivers  to  recruit  and  retain  health  workers  in  rural  areas\u2014including  salary \nlevels  and  social  welfare  elements\u2014and  assist  the  Government  in  implementing  incentive \npackages to increase the numbers of doctors and nurses in SHCs and specialists in AGHs.  \n \n\n4. \n\nComponent 4: Sector Capacity Development and Management \n\n \n37. \nComponent 4 links to two strategies of the HSMP: (i) strengthen and integrate ongoing \nhealth sector reform using a sector wide approach (SWAp), and (ii) establish an optimal public \nand private mix of health care services. \n \n38. \nImproved Capacity to Implement the HSMP and Engage in Intersectoral Dialogue. \nThe  Government  is  committed  to  the  HSMP  and  to  sector-wide  management  of  the  health \nsystem.  The  Project  will  support  this  process  by  providing  capacity  development  for  MOH, \nincluding the National Center for Health Development, in planning, coordinating, and budgeting \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fto  facilitate  sector-wide  coordination  in  the  short-term  and  management  in  the  midterm.  The \nProject  will  assist  MOH  in  organizing  and  implementing  joint  annual  reviews  of  the  HSMP \nimplementation  with  major  stakeholders  in  the  sector  and  strengthen  the  recently  established \nHSMP  Implementation  Coordination  Committee  and  its  equivalent  at  aimag  level  to  gradually \nbring  health  stakeholders  under  the  umbrella  of  the  HSMP.  This  will  allow  for  an  effective \ndialogue  on  broad  issues  that  require  interministerial  agreements,  such  as  HR  and  health \ninsurance reforms. \n \n39. \nImproved Health Sector Governance. A project focus will be identifying optimal health \nsystem organization and structure with an emphasis on consumer and patient involvement and \ninteractions. The Project will revisit and pilot the hospital/health board concept to provide more \nautonomy to hospitals that was introduced initially under HSDP, and it will organize a study tour \non  hospital  autonomy.  The  Project  will  also  develop,  pilot,  and  implement  participatory \nmechanisms for patients and consumers (e.g., clients\u2019 rights and charters, public reporting, and \ntransparent complaints and communication processes).  \n \n40. \nPrivate  Sector  Policy  and  Guidelines.  The  private  sector  in  health  care  is  poorly \nregulated and regulation is institutionally fragmented. The private sector is rapidly developing in \nan  environment  in  which  the  Government  has  little  experience  in  designing  proper  legal, \nregulatory,  and  contractual  frameworks  to  monitor  performances,  ensure  quality  of  care,  and \nenforce  licensing  and  accreditation  requirements.  The  Project  will  assist  MOH  in  developing \nregulatory frameworks and mechanisms for private health operations, financing, and licensing. \nCriteria  to  improve  the  distribution  of  hospital  services  and  assess  competency,  quality,  and \nstandards  in  the  private  sector  will  be  developed.  The  Project  will  also  review  and  develop \noptions  for  public-private  cooperation  in  providing  health  services,  including  the  potential  for \nmodern technology to be more widely available to the community and for increased access to \nquality treatment and diagnostic services. \n \nC. \n \n41. \nPro-poor  Orientation.  The  Project  is  designed  to  increase  access  to  PHC  while \nimproving  its  quality.  The  poor,  disadvantaged,  women,  and  elderly  are  the  major  users  of \nFGPs, and rural poor populations are the major clients of SHCs. Upgrading and improving FGP \nand SHC services directly benefits the poor. The Project will assist the Government in extending \nhealth  insurance  coverage  to  the  poor  and  uninsured,  to  increase  access  to  services,  and  to \nhelp in preventing impoverishment through unanticipated large health-related payments. \n \nImproving Health Care Financing and Health Insurance. The Project aims to improve \n42. \nhealth  financing  policy  to  increase  allocative  and  technical  efficiency  through  pooling  of  state \nand Health Insurance Funds and the development of a single purchaser of health care services \nunder  the  Public  Sector  Finance  Management  Law.  That  law  emphasizes  funding  based  on \noutputs.  Financing  through  purchasing  and  associated  contracting  arrangements  between \npurchaser and provider that specifies levels and types of care and treatment delivered will help \nto raise standards, quality of care, and efficiency in hospitals. \n \nPrivate  Sector  Regulation  and  Public-Private  Partnership.  The  private  hospital \n43. \nsector in Mongolia has expanded rapidly without regulation or control. Consequences include a \nlack  of  public  assurance  for  the  safety  and  quality  of  care  provided,  public  financing  through \nhealth  insurance  with  little  information  on  outcomes  or  results,  and  mushrooming  of  small \nprivate hospitals adding little value for consumers but increasing health care expenditures. The \nProject will assist MOH in developing regulatory frameworks and mechanisms to review private \noperations,  financing,  and  licensing;  as  well  as  develop  criteria  to  improve  the  distribution  of \nhospital  services  and  assess  competency,  quality,  and  standards  in  the  private  sector.  The \n\nSpecial Features \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nProject  will  also  review  and  develop  options  for  public-private  cooperation  in  providing  health \nservices,  including  the  potential  for  making  modern  technology  more  widely  available  to  the \ncommunity and for increasing access to quality treatment and diagnostic services. The Project \nwill  assist  the  MOH  in  developing  its  private-sector  regulatory  and  monitoring  capacity  to \nimprove private sector performance and better integrate the private and public health sectors. \n \n44. \nSector-Wide Management and Donor Coordination. The Project\u2019s support for sector-\nwide arrangements will strengthen MOH\u2019s capacity to coordinate stakeholder activities in health, \nleading  to  improved  sector  coordination  and  planning  in  the  medium-term  and  improved \nmanagement of sector inputs in the longer term. The Project will (i) support implementation of \njoint  annual  reviews  of  the  sector  with  major  stakeholders;  (ii)  assist  MOH  in  developing \ncommon management arrangements to improve the government-led SWAp; and (iii) strengthen \nthe  HSMP  Implementation  Coordination  Committee,  which  oversees  all  health  activities  of \nnational and international partners in the sector and provides a venue for intersectoral dialogue \non such broad issues as the reform of health insurance. The Project will also support the High \nLevel  HR  Coordinating  Committee  to  promote  intersectoral  collaboration  in  developing  and \nimplementing health sector human resources, policies, and strategic plans. \n \nD. \n \n45. \nestimates is in Table 1.

MOH will be the Executing Agency for the Project and \nwill  be  responsible  for  its  overall  implementation.  To  provide  strategic  orientation  and  overall \nguidance on Project implementation, a project steering committee (PSC) has been established, \nchaired  by  the  state  secretary  of  MOH  and  composed  of  senior  officials  from  MOH,  MSWL, \nMOF,  the  State  Social  Insurance  General  Office,  and  Health  Sciences  University  of  Mongolia, \nUlaanbaatar City, as well as representatives of project aimags and duuregs and the Mongolian \nAssociation  of  Family  Doctors.  The  PSC  will  serve  as  a  mechanism  for  private  sector \nparticipation in the Project. The five project aimags will establish supervisory groups, chaired by \nthe aimag governors\u2019 offices and composed of representatives of the health departments, AGHs, \nand  SHCs.  The  two  project  duuregs  will  establish  supervisory  groups,  chaired  by  the  duureg \ngovernor\u2019s  office  and  composed  of  the  district  health  alliance,  district  general  hospital, \nUlaanbaatar  city  health  department  and  FGPs.  The  PSC  and  supervisory  groups  will  meet \nquarterly and be responsible for approving the annual project budget and activity plan, as well \nas for reviewing and advising on implementation progress. The minutes of PSC meetings will be \nforwarded  to  ADB  on  a  quarterly  basis.  Working  groups  to  advise  and  assist  with  project \nimplementation  will  be  established  centrally  and  in  pilot  areas.  Detailed  implementation \narrangements  are \nin \nthe \nSupplementary Appendix G. \n \n48. \nA  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  will  be  set  up  in  MOH  and  will  be  responsible  for \nproject  coordination  and  day-to-day  implementation  of  project  activities,  including  supervising \nconstruction;  procuring  equipment  and  materials;  disbursement;  providing  support  in  selecting \nconsultants, engaging consultants, and managing their supervision and monitoring of the work \nprogram and project performance; and reporting on progress, including to prepare the quarterly \nand annual project monitoring and progress reports. The PIU will consult closely with relevant \nhealth  facilities,  agencies,  and  international  partners.  The  PIU  will  be  headed  by  a  qualified \nproject  manager  selected  on  a  competitive  basis.  The  PIU  will  comprise  five  staff,  including  a \nplanning  and  human  resources  officer,  administration  and  finance  officer,  civil  works  and \nprocurement officer, secretary, and driver, for the entire implementation period of the Project. In \neach  project  aimag,  a  project  coordinator  will  be  appointed  to  oversee  implementation  of  the \nProject  at  the  local  level.  That  coordinator  will  be  assisted  by  staff  for  training,  quality \nimprovement, procurement, and civil works that is to be engaged intermittently or on a part-time \nbasis,  as  necessary.  Implementation  in  Ulaanbaatar  duuregs  will  be  coordinated  through  the \nPIU.  All  PIU  staff,  including  aimag  level  coordinators  and  their  staff,  whose  salaries  are  paid \nfrom the proceeds of the grant, will be selected and contracted individually in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \n\nfinancial  management  assessment \n\nis \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n49. \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years,  from  2008  to  2013.  The  project \n\n \n50. \nThe  procurement  of  goods  and  works  financed  under  the  grant  will  be  undertaken  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nInternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  will  be  applied  to  supply  contracts  estimated  to  cost \n$500,000  or  more.  Supply  contracts  with  values  less  than  $500,000  will  follow  national \ncompetitive  bidding  (NCB),  and  those  less  than  $100,000  will  follow  shopping  procedures  as \nreflected by particular circumstances of the contract packages. International competitive bidding \nwill be used for civil works contracts valued at $1 million or more. Civil works contracts valued at \nless than $1 million will be procured using NCB procedures. NCB procurement will be done on \nthe  basis  of  NCB  procedures  in  accordance  with  the  Mongolian  Procurement  Law,  subject  to \nmodifications  agreed  with  ADB.  The  internationally  tendered  equipment  packages  will  include \nthe  necessary  technical  support  for  ensuring  proper  installation,  testing,  commissioning,  and \ntraining  of  operational  staff  as  part  of  the  related  contracts.  In  accordance  with  ADB \nrequirements,  foreign  contractors  may  participate  in  bidding  for  NCB  contracts.  External \nmonitoring of quality of civil works will be established. The procurement plan is in Appendix 10. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services  \n\n51. \nThe  Project  will  require  a  total  of  57  person-months  of  international  and  312  person-\nmonths  of  national  consulting  services  financed  under  the  ADB  grant.  The  international  and \nnational consultants will have expertise in (i) PHC services, (ii) public health, (iii) civil works, (iv) \nmedical  equipment,  (v)  information  and  communication  technology  network  development,  (vi) \nhealth care financing and health insurance, (vii) HR management and development, (viii) health \nplanning, (ix) private health services planning and provision, and (x) monitoring and evaluation. \nOther national consultants will have expertise in (i) legal issues on the legal, tax, business, and \nsocial status of FGPs; (ii) web design; and (iii) gender and development. The consultants will be \nselected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, \ninternational  consultants  (information  and \nas  amended \ncommunication  technology,  health  planning  and  management,  monitoring  and  evaluation)  and \nnational  consultants  (legal  expert,  web  designer,  information  and  communication  technology, \nhealth planning and management, gender and development, monitoring and evaluation) will be \nselected  and  contracted  individually  as  the  assignments  are  straightforward  and  MOH\u2019s  main \nrequirements are the consultants\u2019 qualifications and experience. Using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-\nbased selection procedure (quality-cost ratio of 80:20), the remaining international and national \nconsultants  will  be  selected  and  contracted  through  short-listed  international  consulting  firms. \nIndicative  consultancy  requirements  and  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in \nAppendix 11.  \n \n\ntime).  Selected \n\nfrom \n\ntime \n\nto \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n52. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  MOH.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \ngrant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of MOH and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, \n\n \n\n\f13 \n\nand other service providers as they relate to the Project. For the Project, MOH will establish a \nmechanism  for  external  monitoring  of  the  quality  of  civil  works;  and  launch  a  project-specific \nwebsite for disclosing project activities and achievements. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n53. \nThe  grant  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  expedite  project  implementation  through  timely \nrelease  of  grant  proceeds,  the  PIU  will  establish  an  imprest  account  at  a  commercial  bank \nacceptable  to  ADB.  Disbursements  from  the  imprest  account  will  be  supported  by  an \nappropriate  withdrawal  application  and  related  documentation.  Such  documentation  will \ndemonstrate,  among  other  things,  that  the  goods  and/or  services  are  (i)  procured  from  ADB\u2019s \nmember countries, and (ii) eligible for ADB financing. The initial amount to be deposited in the \nimprest account will not exceed the estimated expenditures for the next 6 months, or 10% of the \ngrant  amount,  whichever  is  less.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  may  be  used  to \nreimburse, liquidate, or replenish eligible expenditures that do not exceed $50,000 per individual \npayment. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n54. \nThe  Government,  through  the  PIU,  will  (i)  maintain  separate  financial  accounts  for  the \nProject,  and  (ii)  have  such  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  audited  annually  by \nindependent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Grant \nAgreement and as specified in ADB\u2019s financial reporting and auditing standards.9 The auditors \nshould have qualifications, experience, and terms of reference acceptable to ADB. The use of \nthe imprest accounts and statement of expenditures will also be part of the annual audit and a \nseparate audit opinion will be submitted. The Government will submit to ADB certified copies (in \nEnglish) of such audited accounts and financial statements, as well as the related reports of the \nauditors, within 6 months after the close of each fiscal year. The Government was advised that \nADB requires timely submission of audited projects accounts and financial statements and that \nit  will  suspend  disbursements  of  the  proposed  ADB  grant  in  case  of  noncompliance  with  the \nrequirement. \n \nFor  the  purpose  of  complying  with  the  requirements  for  the  annual  audited  financial \n55. \nstatements, the proceeds of this grant may be used to finance expenditures for private financial \nstatements,  sector  auditors,  and  translations  of  auditor\u2019s  reports  into  English.  The  PIU  will \nsubmit consolidated quarterly progress reports to ADB (in English) and to the Government on all \naspects  of  project  implementation.  The  reports  will  include  details  on  overall  implementation \nprogress, problems encountered during the reporting period, measures taken or proposed to be \ntaken  to  remedy  these  problems,  and  the  proposed  program  of  activities  for  the  following \nquarter.  Within  3  months  of  project  completion,  the  PIU  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB,  in  a \nformat  acceptable  to  ADB,  a  project  completion  report  on  (i)  the  utilization  and  impact  of  the \ngrant;  (ii)  performance  of  the  Project;  (iii)  economic  and  social  benefits  generated;  and  (iv) \ndetails about implementation, costs, and other information requested by ADB. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring System  \n\n56.  MOH  will  establish  a  comprehensive  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS) \nacceptable  to  ADB.  The  PPMS  will  assess  performance  by  (i)  evaluating  delivery  of  planned \nactivities;  (ii)  measuring  Project  impacts;  (iii)  measuring  health,  social,  and  economic  benefits \nwith a focus on the poor, women, and disadvantaged groups; and (iv) monitoring achievement \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 1989. Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the Bank. Manila. \n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nof  MDGs  and  other  Government  targets.  PPMS  indicators  will  serve  as  a  basis  to  prepare \nreports on project implementation and the reform process, improved use of resources, improved \naccess  to  services  (particularly  for  the  poor),  improved  service  quality,  client  satisfaction,  and \nprogress in achieving MDGs. Performance indicators are set out in the  design and monitoring \nframework (Appendix 1) and an indicative list of monitoring and evaluation indicators (based on \nreview  of  the  Mongolian  health  management  information  system)  for  use  in  PPMS  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix H. Some indicators will be monitored through surveys financed under \nthe  Project,  while  others  will  be  monitored  through  routine  administrative  and  financial  data. \nWhere  feasible,  indicators  will  be  disaggregated  by  socioeconomic  level  and  gender.  The \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  consultants  will  assist  MOH  and  PIU  to  determine  Project-specific \nindicators and develop a cost-effective and efficient monitoring and evaluation system.  \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n57. \nADB  and  the  Government  will  jointly  undertake  reviews  of  the  Project  at  least  twice  a \nyear. The reviews will assess progress in each component, identify issues and constraints, and \ndetermine  necessary  remedial  actions  and  adjustments.  A  midterm  review  will  be  conducted \nduring  the  third  year  of  implementation.  The  midterm  review  will  (i)  review  the  scope,  design, \nand implementation arrangements and identify adjustments required; (ii) assess progress of the \nproject  implementation  against  performance  indicators;  and  (iii)  recommend  changes  in  the \ndesign or implementation arrangements, if necessary. \n \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nProject Benefits and Impacts \n\n \nA. \n \n58. \nThe targeted outcome of the Project is effective PHC and improved financial protection \nthrough health insurance, which will positively impact on health status and Mongolians\u2019 quality \nof  life,  especially  in  rural  settings  and  in  poor  areas  of  Ulaanbaatar  under  the  Project.  By \nstrengthening  the  FGP  model,  urban  populations  will  gain  increased  access  to  better  quality \nPHC services, including treatment, prevention, and health education. FGPs specifically benefit \nthe  poor,  as  more  than  60%  of  clients  are  below  the  poverty  threshold  and  include  women, \nyoung  children,  and  the  elderly.  By  improving  rural  health  services  through  infrastructure \ndevelopment,  equipment,  enhancing  staff  skills  and  optimizing  the  number  of  key  health \nprofessionals,  the  Project  will  benefit  populations  in  rural  areas,  where  health  outcomes  and \naccess  are  poorer  than  for  urban  Mongolians.  The  Project  will  directly  benefit  almost  700,000 \npeople in five aimags and the two duuregs of Ulaanbaatar (26.8% of the total population).  \n \nPolicy  measures,  capacity  development,  and  HRD  under  the  Project  will  benefit  the \n59. \nentire  population \nimproving  health  system \neffectiveness. Policy measures under the Project will strengthen health financing policy aimed at \nincreasing population health insurance coverage and benefits packages; focus on payment for \nquality services, which will enhance patient care; and improve technical and allocative efficiency \nin  hospitals,  to  the  direct  benefit  of  patients.  Other  specific  project  benefits  include  improved \ntechnical  capacity  (through  increased  skills  and  capacity  of  FGPs  and  soum  health  staff); \nimproved  guidelines  and  standards  of  care;  increased  financing  capacity  of  MOH  and  local \ngovernment staff; increased planning plus improved budgeting, monitoring, and evaluation skills \nin  the  health  sector;  and  improved  institutional  operations  and  functioning  (through  a \nstrengthened  MOH,  stronger  intersectoral  collaboration,  SHCs  better  aligned  with  rural  health \nneeds, and a more effective referral and networking system). \n \n60. \nThe  Project  will  impact  on  population  health  and  MDG  goals  and  targets  by  improving \naccess;  increasing  service  quality;  facilitating  financial  protection  for  health  care;  increasing \nprofessional  capacity  development,  policy,  planning  and  implementation  capability;  and \n\nthrough  nationwide  components  aimed  at \n\n \n\n\f15 \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Dimensions \n\nestablishing system regulation. Training of rural health staff in PHC and in essential clinical care \nand  management  will  assist  in  addressing  the  burden  of  disease  in  Mongolia  (especially \nmanagement  of  maternal  and  child  health  care;  men\u2019s  health;  and  chronic  diseases  like \ncardiovascular  disease,  tuberculosis,  and  diabetes).  Developing  sound  clinical  guidelines  and \npractices  will  enable  more  effective  and  outcome-based  clinical  services  in  FGPs  and  SHCs. \nImproving  communication  and  networking  among  FGPs,  SHCs,  and  hospital  specialists  will \nallow more rapid and effective diagnosis and treatment for remote and rural populations. \n \nB. \n \nPoverty and health are closely related, and better health services contribute importantly \n61. \nto economic development. Overall, the Project  aims to improve and extend PHC services and \npolicies  to  benefit  the  Mongolian  population,  in  particular,  the  rural  and  urban  poor,  women, \nchildren,  and  the  elderly.  The  Project  will  benefit  the  whole  population  indirectly  through \nnationwide  components  that  support  health  sector  reform  and  sector-wide  and  intersectoral \nmanagement  capacity  development.  Under  the  component  for  strengthening  health  services, \nwhere  most  of  the  Project  funds  are  allocated,  there  are  more  than  700,000  people.  Among \nthese, more than 40% of the population in the project aimags is poor, compared to the national \naverage  of  36%.  The  Project  activities  specifically  target  poor,  marginalized,  and  underserved \ngroups by, for example, improving PHC coverage and service delivery, introducing community \ninvolvement mechanisms, and facilitating financial protection for the poor.  \n \n62. \nThe Project will contribute to achieving MDGs, particularly Goal 4 (reduce the under-five \nmortality rate by two thirds and the infant mortality rate from 63.4 to 22 per thousand live births; \nincrease  the  percentage  of  children  vaccinated  against  measles  from  82.5%  to  96%),  Goal  5 \n(improve maternal health by reducing the maternal mortality rate from 200 to 50 per 100,000 live \nbirths,  increase  the  proportion  of  births  attended  by  skilled  health  personnel  from  96.8  to \n99.8%), and Goal 6 (combat sexually transmitted infections, HIV/AIDS, and such communicable \ndiseases  as  tuberculosis  by  halting  and,  by  2015,  beginning  to  reverse  the  spread  of  these \ndiseases).  The  Project\u2019s  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in  Appendix  12. \nDetailed  poverty  and  social,  and  gender  analyses  are  in  supplementary  appendixes  I  and  J, \nrespectively. \n \nThe Project will help to improve women\u2019s health through its strong focus on PHC, which \n63. \nis predominantly accessed by women. Gender  disaggregated data will be collected to monitor \nthe Project\u2019s effects on women and men. Women will be encouraged to participate in planning \nand implementing the Project. By improving health education and health promotion, the Project \nis expected to impact on declining adult male health outcomes. A gender plan is in Appendix 13.  \n \n64. \nThe project preparation activities were guided by participatory processes undertaken in \nthe project areas. Focus group and stakeholder discussions were held and indicated a range of \nhealth and social concerns in the community, including the needs for (i) increased consultation \nwith local communities, (ii) improved access to rural health services (SHCs are mainly used by \npoorer  people,  women,  and  the  elderly),  and  (iii)  improved  outreach  and  community  health \neducation. A national information campaign on strengthening the role of FGPs will be designed \nand implemented. \n \nC. \n \n65. \nLand  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  The  Project  will  construct  14  SHCs,  one \ninter-SHC and two FGP centers in the five project aimags and two duuregs of Ulaanbaatar. The \nconstruction of SHCs and FGP centers will be on existing government land and will not affect \n\nSocial Safeguards \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nEconomic and Financial Impacts \n\ncommunity members.10 During project implementation, should there be change in the scope or \nother  changes  with  unanticipated  resettlement  impacts,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nactivities will be implemented in accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). \n \n66. \nEthnic Minority Issues. There are over 30 ethnic groups in Mongolia. Most Mongolians \nare  Khalkh  (81.5%),  and  minority  groups  account  for  18.5%  of  the  population.  A  substantial \nethnic minority group (Dariganga) exists in Sukhbaatar, while minority groups are very small in \nother project aimags. Consultation with representatives of the Dariganga ethnic minority group \nin  Sukhbaatar  showed  that  they  are  not  considered  to  be  economically,  socially,  or  legally \nmarginalized or otherwise disadvantaged in a manner which would restrict their access to health \nservices or affect their health status. The Constitution of Mongolia indicates that no person will \nbe discriminated against based on ethnic origin and guarantees equal access to education and \nhealth  for  ethnic  minorities.  The  cultural  distinction,  health,  and  socioeconomic  status  of  this \ngroup,  as  revealed  through  data  collection  during  project  preparation,  are  similar  to  those  of \nother Mongolians. Given the equal levels of social indicators between the Khalkh majority and \nethnic  minorities,  no  indigenous  people\u2019s  development  plan  or  special  actions  in  favor  of  any \nparticular group are needed.  \n \nD. \n  \n67. \nThe Project has a strong focus on improving the institutional, operational, and financial \nefficiency  of  the  Mongolian  health  system.  Economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRR)  were \ncalculated  for  the  Project,  and  main  benefits  quantified  were  resource  cost  savings  and \nproductivity gains.  \n \nResource cost savings consist of reducing out-of-pocket expenses for health care as a \n68. \nresult of reforms in health financing. Productivity gains are the results of less time lost to illness \nthat would have otherwise been utilized in some  economic activity. Productivity gains will also \nbe  realized  through  less  time  being  spent  for  the  care  of  sick  family  members.  Direct  and \nindirect health benefits are potentially significant due to fewer days lost at work and school and \ngeneral  improvement  in  health  status  and  life.  The  analysis  does  not  attempt  to  quantify  all \neconomic  gains  and  provides  only  conservative  estimates  based  on  quantifiable  benefit \nstreams.  Overall  investments  under  the  Project  are  expected,  however,  to  yield  significant \neconomic, social, and institutional benefits. The Project yields a 22.8% EIRR and a net present \nvalue  of  MNT11.3  billion.  The  net  present  value  calculation  discounts  the  cost  and  benefit \nstreams  at  12%  in  real  terms.  The  economic  and  financial  analyses  are  summarized  in \nAppendix 14 and set out in detail in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \n69. \nFinancial  goals  of  the  Project  include  improving  allocative  efficiency  in  health  care \nexpenditure  (shifting  funding  away  from  hospitals  to  PHC)  and  improving  internal  operating \nefficiency  and  financial  management  in  service  delivery,  thus  reducing  health  care  costs  for \nindividuals  and  the  community  overall.  Incremental  recurrent  costs  of  the  Project  are \nmanageable and arise largely from  increased operation and maintenance (O&M)  costs for the \nfacilities constructed and upgraded under the Project. \n  \nThe  financial  analysis  evaluates  the  impact  of  the  Project  on  the  Government  budget. \n70. \nThe Project\u2019s total financing cost, inclusive of taxes, duties, and contingencies, is $17.6 million \nfor around 5 years. The Government\u2019s annual share in Project costs will average approximately \n$719,000  equivalent  (MNT867  million),  or  less  than  1%  of  the  projected  annual  health  sector \nbudget of about $87.2 million. The recurrent costs to be borne by the Government during project \nimplementation  are  estimated  to  be  about  $107,000  equivalent  (MNT128  million)  per  year. \n\n                                                 \n10 The MOH provided a letter, dated 16 May 2007, giving assurance that the new SHCs, inter-SHC and FGPs will be \n\nconstructed on government land that is not currently in use or occupied by anyone. \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\nThese include the operating expenses of the PIU and O&M and replacement costs of new and \nupgraded health facilities and equipment. FGPs under the Project will continue to be funded by \nthe Government during and after project implementation. The budgetary impact of the estimated \nannual  recurrent  costs  during  implementation  of  the  Project  is  considered  minimal.  Soum \ngovernments  will  share  in  the  O&M  costs  for  the  rehabilitated  SHCs.  The  Government  is \ncommitted to providing the funds necessary to ensure the sustainability of the investments.  \n \nE. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\nRisks and Mitigation Measures \n\nAn initial environmental examination (IEE) was carried out in the five project aimags in \n71. \naccordance  with  Government  Laws  and  Regulations  on \nthe  environment  and  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines. 11  Extensive  public \nconsultations,  including  surveys,  meetings  with  stakeholders,  and  focus  group  discussions, \nwere  undertaken  during  preparation  of  the  IEE.  The  project  IEE  was  reviewed  by  the  aimag\u2019s \nenvironment department in accordance with the law on Environment Impact Assessment.  \n \n72. \nThe  Project  will  not  adversely  affect  natural  resources,  the  ecology,  or  cultural  and/or \nhistorical sites. A limited number of specific  environmental and social impacts may result from \nthe  project  implementation,  but  these  can  be  avoided  or  mitigated  by  adhering  to  generally \nrecognized  performance  standards,  guidelines,  and  design  criteria.  The  Project  will  enhance \nenvironmental  features  of  the  hospitals,  provide  safe  water  supply,  and  ensure  appropriate \nmedical  waste  management.  Newly  constructed  and  upgraded  SHC  and  AGH  buildings  will \nenhance energy efficiency and building standards. The Project will have positive social impacts, \nincluding to improve rural health care services and the quality of life for people in project areas. \nCivil works in the Project will ensure that no additional environmental problems are created by \nspecifying  appropriate  design  features,  heating  and  ventilation  systems,  and  wastewater \ncollection  systems.  A  synopsis  of  the  IEE  is  in  Appendix  15  and  the  summary  IEE  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix L. \n \nF. \n \n73. \nThe first risk is that government support and commitment to health sector development \nand  reform  will  diminish.  The  Project  will  mitigate  this  risk  through  continuing  policy  dialogue \nwith  the  Government  and  donor  community  in  the  context  of  the  HSMP.  By  building  on  the \npolicy  platform  established,  and  by  continuing  the  reform  agenda,  the  risk  of  diminishing \nGovernment or agency commitment will be managed. Project involvement in such intersectoral \nprocesses  as  the  joint  annual  reviews  of  the  HSMP  implementation,  National  Health \nDevelopment  Strategy  and  National  Policy  Development  initiatives  under  the  HSMP,  and  the \nHigh Level HR Coordinating Committee to strengthen national HR policy and strategy will assist \nin maintaining the Government\u2019s support and attention. \n \nThe  second  risk  area  relates  to  slow  progress  or  resistance  to  reforms  due  to  (i)  high \n74. \nturnover of officials and senior technical staff in key agencies as a result of frequent leadership \nchanges, and (ii) resistance of key staff groups (e.g., hospital specialists), agencies (e.g., State \nSocial  Insurance  General  Office),  sectors  (e.g.,  the  private  hospitals),  and  the  community  to \nchange and reform. The first will be addressed through close monitoring and dialogue with MOH \nand  support  to  the  HSMP  Implementation  Coordination  Committee.  The  second  will  be \nmitigated through project information campaigns, raising awareness, and training. \n \nA  third  risk  is  MOF\u2019s  resistance  to  single  purchasing  and  pooling  of  funds  as  a  major \n75. \nelement  of  financing  reform.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  the  Project  will  promote  pooling  and  single \npurchasing  as  measures  that  will  reduce  transaction  costs,  conform  to  the  Public  Sector \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines.

Before  grant  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  ensure \nthe establishment of the PIU in MOH, in a manner acceptable to ADB. The PIU will be headed \nby a qualified project manager selected on a competitive basis and will include a planning and \nhuman  resources  officer,  an  administration  and  finance  officer,  a  civil  works  and  procurement \nofficer, a secretary, and a driver. \n\n78. \nFGPs.  Within  18  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  provide  a  plan \nbased  on  research  and  analysis,  acceptable  to  ADB,  detailing  the  major  legal  issues  to  be \naddressed  in  the  health  sector  to  clarify  and  resolve  the  optimal  legal  framework  for  the \noperations of FGPs. The plan will outline the necessary laws, orders, and amendments that will \nneed to be introduced to improve FGPs\u2019 legal, tax, business, and social status, including FGPs\u2019 \nrole as a gatekeeper, the referral arrangements, and the financial requirements. \n\n79.  Within  18  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  establish  a  risk-adjusted \ncapitation process for FGPs set at attractive levels to ensure adequate remuneration for doctors \nand  nurses,  as  well  as  incentives  to  build  up  the  FGP  practice.  The  institutionalized  risk-\nadjusted  capitation  process  will  be  developed  and  agreed  in  consultation  with  MOF  and  the \nMongolian Association of Family Doctors and reviewed and updated regularly on a yearly basis. \n\n \n\n80.  Within  12  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  prepare  a  draft  funding \nplan  for  incentives  for  FGPs  to  allow  additional  (bonus)  funding  for  achieving  quality, \nperformance  and  service  targets.  FGP  performance  contracts  will  be  amended  to  reflect \nimprovement  targets  and  processes  and  will  be  developed  collaboratively  with  FGPs,  MOF, \nlocal health departments, and local government offices.  \n\n \nIncentive  Package  Mechanism.  Within  12  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  the \n81. \nGovernment will prepare a draft plan with identified incentive funding and salary packages, time \nframes, and other required resources to encourage staff transfers to areas of staff shortage in \naimags.  The  incentive  package  mechanism  will  be  a  long  term  commitment  instituted  in \nappropriate  ministries,  including  MOH  and  MSWL,  and  reviewed  annually  and  reported  in \nconnection with Project progress reviews. \n\n82.  Within  18  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  have  researched, \nidentified,  established,  and  supported  additional  training  places  for  rural  staff  including  nurses \nand feldshers. At least 20 funded places in medical/nursing schools per year and per staff group \nwill  be  provided  for  students,  with  additional  incentives,  as  appropriate.  Guaranteed  positions \nwill be available for new graduates, and training schemes advertised and promoted in aimags to \nencourage young students to apply. \n\n83.  Within  9  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  establish  a  process  to \nreview SHC organization and develop a plan within 1 year, acceptable to ADB, for the long term \nstructure,  extent  and  reorganization  of  SHCs  and  the  rural  health  sector.  The  aim  for  SHCs \nshould be to move towards centers of primary care with mainly ambulatory and outreach focus.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n12 The full list of assurances is included in the Grant Agreement. \n\n \n\n\f19 \n\n84. \nCivil  Works  and  Equipment. Within 6 months of grant effectiveness, the Government \nwill  provide  a  civil  works  and  equipment  plan  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  plan  will  (i)  outline  the \nnumber  and  location  of  new  facilities  to  be  renovated  under  the  Project,  and  (ii)  develop  a \nmaster  plan  to  upgrade  the  health  facilities  under  the  Project.    Provision  of  Civil  works  and \nequipment will be prioritized for the improvement of PHC services. \n \n85. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  construction  of  SHCs  and  FGPs  is  carried  out  on \nexisting  Government\u2019s  land.  In  the  event  of  (i)  any  unanticipated  or  unforeseen  involuntary \nresettlement,  (ii)  land  acquisition,  and  (iii)  resettlement  activities  during  project  implementation \nthe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Project  is  implemented  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  Laws  and \nregulations  in  Mongolia.  In  the  event  of  discrepancies  between  the  Government\u2019s  Laws  and \nregulations, ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy shall prevail.  \n\n \n\n86.  Within  12  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  ensure  the  effective \nimplementation of the requirements for monitoring and mitigation included in the summary IEE, \nas agreed between the Government and ADB. \n \n87. \nThe  Government  will  cause  MOH  to  ensure  that  all  civil  works  contractors  (i)  do  not \nemploy child labor for construction and maintenance activities; (ii) encourage employment of the \nlocal  poor  who  meet  the  job  and  efficiency  requirements  for  construction  and  maintenance  of \nproject  infrastructures,  particularly  women;  (iii)  do  not  differentiate  wages  between  men  and \nwomen,  particularly  for  work  of  equal  value;  and  (iv)  provide  timely  payment  of  wages  on  at \nleast  a  monthly  basis  and  safe  working  conditions  to  all  workers.  All  civil  works  contracts  will \ninclude  specific  clauses  on  these  undertakings,  and  compliance  will  be  strictly  monitored  by \nMOH during Project implementation. \n\n \n88. \nHealth  Care  Financing.  Within  12  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  the  Government  will \nprovide  a  preliminary  plan  acceptable  to  ADB,  outlining  the  main  financial  reforms  to  be \nintroduced in the health sector. The plan will cover all current proposed measures, including the \nhealth \ninsurance  scheme,  output  based  budgeting,  case  mix,  single  purchaser,  and \nperformance  payments,  and  will  detail  proposed  implementation  arrangements,  including \npiloting and timeframes. \n \n89.  Within 18 months of grant effectiveness, the Government will cause MOH to enter into a \nMemorandum  of  Understanding  (MOU)  with  MOF  and  the  MSWL  containing  the  detailed \nprocesses  and  milestones  for  the  establishment  of  pooling  of  funds  and  single  purchaser  for \nfinancing the health care. The single purchaser model\u2019s alignment with the current budget and \nhealth insurance systems will be clarified in the MOU. The MOU will ensure that results of the \nnew model are carefully monitored and a contingency plan is in place in case the new financing \nsystem  is  not  successful.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  pooling  of  funds  and  single \npurchaser  for  financing  health  care  is  implemented  on  a  pilot  basis,  acceptable  to  ADB  within \nthe duration of the Project.   \n\n \n90. \nHospital/Health  Boards. Within 18 months of grant effectiveness, the Government will \nprovide to ADB, a preliminary plan for the piloting of hospital/health boards, including the outline \nof their operating arrangements and responsibilities. \n\n \n91. \nPrivate  Health  Sector.  Within  12  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  the  Government  will \nsubmit  to  ADB  a  draft  regulatory  framework  for  private  sector  participation  in  health  services \nprovision, \nfor \ndevelopment,  technology  acquisition,  and  standards  for  safety  and  quality  as  considered \n\nincluding  proposed  monitoring  and \n\nlicensing  processes,  authorizations \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nnecessary.  The  draft  will  be  prepared  in  consultation  with  private  sector  stakeholders  and  an \nagreed final regulatory framework will be established within 24 months of grant effectiveness. \n \n92. \nGender  Plan.  The  Government  will  cause  MOH  to  take  all  necessary  and  appropriate \nmeasures  to  implement  the  gender  plan,  during  the  Project,  including  steps  to  encourage \nwomen to participate in the planning and the implementation of the Project.  \n\n \nFree  Access  to  Health  Service.  The  Government  will  cause  MOH  to  ensure  that  the \n\n93. \npoor continue to receive free access to health services at FGP level.  \n\n \n94. \nGood  Governance  and  Anticorruption.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  project \nfunds are utilized effectively and efficiently to implement the Project and to achieve the Project \nobjectives.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  MOH  (i)  ensures  that  the  Government\u2019s \nAnticorruption Law and ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are strictly enforced and are being complied \nwith during project implementation, and that relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy, \nare included in all bidding documents for the Project; (ii) facilitate in ADB\u2019s exercise of its right to \ninvestigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices  relating  to  the  Project;  (iii)  conduct  periodic  inspections  on  the  project  contractor\u2019s \nactivities related to fund withdrawals and settlements; (iv) ensure that all contracts financed by \nADB in connection with the Project include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and \nother  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project;  (v)  establish  a  mechanism  for  external \nmonitoring  of  quality  of  civil  works;  and  (vi)  launch  a  project  specific  website  for  disclosure  of \nproject  activities  and  achievements.  The  Government  will  cooperate  with  any  audit  and \ninvestigation  and  extend  necessary  assistance,  including  access  to  all  relevant  books  and \nrecords,  as  well  as  engagement  of  independent  auditors  and  experts  that  may  be  needed  for \nsatisfactory completion of such audits and investigations. All external costs related to the audits \nand investigations shall be funded from the Grant. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n95. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  grant  not \nexceeding the equivalent of $14,000,000 to Mongolia, from ADB\u2019s

From the 1920s to the 1990s, Mongolia had centralized the \nhierarchical  health  system.  Health  services  were  fully  financed  and  delivered  by  the \nGovernment, with a strong orientation towards curative services that relied greatly on hospital-\nbased physicians and strong central control. Dismantling this legacy has proved challenging in \nreforming the health care system.   \n \nMongolia\u2019s  health  care  system  is  one  statutory  system  organized  by  administrative \n2. \ndivisions. In addition to the capital city of Ulaanbaatar, there are 21 aimags (provinces), each of \nwhich  is  split  into  smaller  soums  (districts).  Soums  are  further  divided  into  3\u20134  smaller  bags \n(village units), depending on their population sizes. Decentralization of the health care system \nstarted in the mid-1990s in response to reduced central government funding for health.  \n \n3. \nProvision  of  Services.  In  urban  areas,  primary  health  care  (PHC)  services  are \ndelivered  by  family  group  practices  (FGPs),  which  were  initiated  under  the  Health  Sector \nDevelopment  Program  (HSDP)  that  was  financed  by  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  In  rural \nareas,  PHCs  are  provided  by  soum  health  centers  (SHCs)  and  bag  feldshers  (community \nnurses),  who  are  medically  trained  primary  health  care  workers  at  the  smallest  administrative \nunit. Feldshers report to SHCs through regular meetings and visits and, in case of emergencies, \nrefer clients to SHCs or inter-SHCs.  \n \n4. \nSpecialized  care  is  delivered  by  aimag  general  hospitals  (AGH)  and  urban  district \nhospitals,  which  cover  all  major  clinical  specialties  and  typically  have  capacities  of  200\u2013300 \nbeds for delivering inpatient services. The next level of specialized care is provided through the \nstate clinical hospitals and specialized health centers. These are located mainly in Ulaanbaatar, \nbut also through the three regional treatment and diagnostic centers. Private sector provision of \nhealth care is mainly concentrated in Ulaanbaatar.  \n \n5. \nHealth  Indicators. Despite relatively low per capita income, Mongolia has quite strong \nhealth indicators. Since 1994, the trend in both under-five mortality and infant mortality has been \nconsistently downwards. \n \n6. \nOn  average,  Mongolia\u2019s  infant  mortality  rate  is  significantly  less  than  that  of  other \ncountries with similar gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Under-five mortality is below the \naverage of low-income countries and life expectancy at birth (65 in 2003) is higher than average \nfor low-income countries.

After  rising  in  2001,  MMR  has  been \nconsistently going down.1 \n \n9. \nWhile  the  overall  MMR  has  decreased,  there  is  significant  variation  in  mortality  across \nthe  country,  with  some  aimags  recording  rates  three  times  higher  than  the  national  average. \nWhile child and maternal mortality appear to be declining, adult mortality rates are rising. This \nepidemiological transition is similar to those in other post-Soviet countries. Male adult mortality \nis  almost  double  that  of  females  (Table  A2.3).  Major  causes  of  death  are  cardiovascular \ndisease, cancer, and injury. These are partly attributable to high rates of smoking (50% of adult \nmales smoke and the prevalence among women is increasing) and alcohol consumption. \n \n10. \nHigh rates of lifestyle diseases and mortality point to the need for more PHC, prevention, \nand  health  education.  Among  communicable  diseases,  tuberculosis  is  a  major  issue.  Its \nincidence  rose  from  79  to  175  per  100,000  between  1990  and  2005.2 A  major  poverty  related \ncondition  is  malnutrition  in  children,  especially  in  rural  areas.  In  1990,  6%  of  children  were \nunderweight, and this rose to 12% in 2000. In rural areas, fat consumption is high and anemia is \nprevalent in children and pregnant women. These conditions are amendable to primary health \nand health education interventions and public health campaigns targeting healthy lifestyles.  \n  \n11. \nHealth  System  Indicators.  Table  A2.4  compares  Mongolian  health  system  indicators \nwith  similar  transitional  countries.  The  main  points  to  be  inferred  for  Mongolia  are  the  high \nnumber of hospitals, long length of hospitalization relative to developed health systems, and low \nratios of nurses to population (as well as low ratios relative to doctor numbers). \n \n\nTable A2.4: Health System Indicators for Mongolia and Selected Countries in 2004\u20132005 \n \nNurses \nper \n100,000 \n\n \nHospitals \nper \n100,000 \n\nOP \nContacts \nper \nYear \n\n \nDoctors \nper \n100,000 \n\n \nBeds \nper \n100,000 \n\n \nTHE as \n% of \nGDP \n\n \n \nLength \nof Stay \n\n \n \nOcc \nRate \n\n \n \n \nCountry \n\nPublic \nSpending \nas % of \nTHE  \n\n776 \n\n366.5 \n\n644.6 \n\n12.8 \n\n93.2 \n\nKazakhstan \nKyrgyz   \n\nRepublic \n\nLatvia \nLithuania \nTajikistan \nUzbekistan \nRussian \n\nFederation \n\n7.03 \n\n2.85 \n4.47 \n5.07 \n6.9 \n3.7 \n\n6.06 \n2.63 \n5.78 \n \n17 \n23.4 \n\n511 \n768 \n812 \n623 \n519 \n\n974 \n643 \n857 \n \n584 \n663 \n\n252.5 \n315.5 \n399.0 \n203.9 \n269.7 \n\n424.0 \n261.0 \n372.5 \n271.0 \n\n582.8 \n544.6 \n742.8 \n443.8 \n1,023.0 \n\n797.0 \n547.0 \n789.2 \n313.0 \n\n12.1 \n10.0 \n10.2 \n12.0 \n10.2 \n\n13.8 \n8.0 \n12.9 \n9.5 \n\n88.8 \n\u2014 \n78.6 \n58.6 \n86.8 \n\n86.4 \n73.6 \n85.8 \n\u2014 \n\n6.6 \n\n3.9 \n5.2 \n6.7 \n4.2 \n8.7 \n\n8.9 \n7.9 \n8.6 \n2.1 \n\n3.9 \n\n5.4 \n6.4 \n6.5 \n4.5 \n5.4 \n\n5.3 \n6.6 \n5.2 \n4.5  \n\n62.4 \n\n41 \n51.6 \n75.4 \n22.9 \n42.1 \n\n59.8 \n69.8 \n56.9 \n90 \n\n \n\nEU  \nCIS \nMongolia \n     Public \n     Total \nCIS  =  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States,  EU  =  European  Union,  GDP  =  gross  domestic  product,  Occ  = \noccupancy, OP = outpatient, THE = total health expenditure. \nSources: WHO European database, 2004 and 2005; National Center for Health Development Health Indicators 2005. \n \n12. \nHealth  Financing.  Since  the  economic  transition,  Mongolia  has  been  able  to  keep \npublic health spending at a higher level than in most other transition countries (around 4\u20134.5% \n                                                 \n1  National Center for Health Development. 2005.

The Mongolian Health System at a Crossroads: An Incomplete Transition to a Post-Semashko Model. \nWashington, DC: World Bank. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n29 \n\nof GDP, now about 5% in 2007). Health has accounted for some 10\u201312% of total government \nexpenditure.  In  1994,  Mongolia  established  a  Health  Insurance  Fund  (HIF),  which  contributes \n33%  to  overall  health  spending.  The  government  budget  contributes  about  57%  and  the \nremainder  comprises  out-of-pocket expenditures.  Issues  and  problems concerning health  care \nfinancing have been well documented from many sources and reviews are summarized below. \n \n13. \nEfficiency  considerations  include  (i)  fragmented  financing  and  inefficient  financial \narrangements (e.g., hospital funding from different sources, including the HIF and government); \n(ii)  variable and  line item  budgeting  practices that  have  still  to  reviewed  in  line  with  the  Public \nSector  Finance  Management  Law  of  2003;  (iii)  funding  not  linked  to  performance  or  cost \ncontainment (as payment is based on beds, occupancy, and number of outpatient visits, there \nare  perverse  incentives  to  increase  beds,  unnecessary  admissions,  and  visits;  (iv)  HIF\u2019s \ncovering mainly inpatient services and favoring expensive and larger hospitals over smaller and \nrural  hospitals;  (v)  weak  resource  allocation  mechanisms  from  lack  of  government  cost  based \ninformation across the system; and (vi) surpluses not invested back into the system. \n \n14. \nEquity considerations include much of the population\u2019s not receiving care due to lack of \nhealth insurance coverage, limited spending on PHC, informal payments (40% of patients now \npay informally), and co-payments acting as a barrier to access by poor people.  \n \n15. \nQuality considerations include low investment in technology and improved services (one \nreason  why  increasing  numbers  are  seeking  care  outside  of  the  country);  low  remuneration \nleading  to  poor  care;  inability  to  use  efficiency  savings,  resulting  in  lack  of  incentives  for \nmangers to make improvement changes; and automatic reimbursement irrespective of quality. \n \nThe  Government  has  flagged  some  important  areas  to  be  covered  in  future  financing \n16. \npolicies,  including  (i)  equity  directions  (state  to fund  75%  of  health  care,  universal  compulsory \ncoverage of HIF, 100% state funding of PHC, global budgeting for essential services based on \ncase  mix,  and  regulatory  incentives  for  providers);  (ii)  efficiency  directions  (single  purchaser \nmodel;  regulations  for  purchasers;  semiautonomous  hospitals;  output  based  budgeting;  case \nmix  and  global  budgets;  improved  organizational  delivery  systems  to  provide  more  efficient \ncare, such as day only and home care; and contracting out); and (iii) quality directions (standard \ncosts  developed  from  use  of  protocols  and  guidelines;  per  capita  based  funding;  performance \nincentives and contracts for quality; and accreditation linked to financial incentives). \n \n17. \nPlanning  and  Regulation.  At  the  central  level,  the  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH)  sets  the \nhealth  policy  agenda  and  prepares  long-  and  medium-term  plans  and  budget  proposals  while \nmonitoring implementation at the central, capital city, and aimag levels. The Ministry of Finance \ndetermines  the  total  budget  to  be  allocated  to  the  health  sector.  Decisions  on  financial \nallocations are made primarily on the basis of historical expenditure; norms and standards in the \nsector;  plus  government  resolutions,  decrees,  and  national  health  programmes  related  to  the \npriority areas identified. The HIF is regulated through the State Social Insurance General Office \n(SSIGO).  While  there  are  organizational  structures  and  formal  mechanisms  for  coordinating \npolicies  between  MOH  and  SSIGO,  there  is  little  or  no  coordination  of  service  purchasing \npolicies between HIF and MOH. \n \n18. \nHuman Resources Development. Human resources (HR) have been a major concern \nin the health sector since the economic transition. Key problem areas include (i) demonstrated \noverstaffing of doctors; (ii) low ratios of nurses to doctors and other inefficient skills mixes; (iii) \nmisdistribution of key personnel, with critical lack of staff in rural areas; and (iv) low salaries and \nincentives for health workers. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\n \n\nCountry \nCambodia \nChina, People\u2019s Republic of \nJapan \nKorea, Republic of  \nMalaysia \nPhilippines \nSingapore \nViet Nam \nMongolia \n\nTable A2.5: Ratios of Nurses and Doctors \n\nNurses per 1,000 \nPopulation \n0.61 \n1.05 \n7.79 \n1.75 \n1.35 \n1.69 \n4.24 \n0.56 \n3.13 \n\nDoctors per 1,000 \nPopulation \n0.16 \n1.06 \n1.98 \n1.57 \n0.7 \n0.58 \n1.4 \n0.53 \n2.63 \n\nNurse-Doctor \nRatio \n\n3.81 \n0.99 \n3.93 \n1.11 \n1.93 \n2.91 \n3.03 \n1.06 \n1.19 \n\nSource: World Health Organization. 2005. World Health Report 2005. Geneva. \n \n19. \nHR  management  and  processes  are  still  weak  in  Mongolia,  characterized  by  poorly \ndeveloped  recruitment  and  selection,  performance  review,  staff  support,  and  career \ndevelopment,  as  well  as  little  supporting  data.  Career  pathways  and  incentive  packages  are \nrudimentary,  and  salaries  and  working  conditions  for  staff  in  rural  areas  are  insufficient  to \nmotivate movement to the countryside. Other evident long-standing problems include too many \nnew  doctors  being  trained,  as  well  as  clinical  training  programs  that  are  not  linked  with  future \nspecialist needs or guided by clinical curricula. \n \n20. \nThe  suboptimal  HR  situation  has  led  to  deterioration  in  health  service  quality  and \navailability  of  services,  failure  to  meet  population  health  needs,  and  lack  of  confidence  in  the \nhealth  care  system.  A  multisectoral  High  Level  HR  Coordinating  Committee  has  been \nestablished to coordinate development and implementation of HR policies and strategies in the \nhealth  sector.  Major  international  agencies,  including  Asian  Development  Bank,  and  the \nGovernment have committed to improving health care HR in Mongolia. \n \n21. \nThe  Health  Sector  Master  Plan.  To  assist  in  establishing  a  systemic  approach,  a \nHealth Sector Master Plan (HSMP), has been developed and approved by the Government for \nthe  period  2006\u20132015.  The  HSMP  serves  as  a  technical  long-term  planning  document  to \naddress major strategic directions in Mongolian health care.  \n \nB. \n \n22. \nOverextensive Hospital System. The need to restructure hospital services in Mongolia \nis  well  documented.  With  a  large  number  of  hospitals  (mostly  in  Ulaanbaatar),  14,600  public \nsector  hospital  beds  (in  2005),  and  6,448  doctors  for  a  population  of  2.5  million  people,  there \nare  simply  too  many  hospitals,  excess  hospital  beds,  and  overstaffing  of  hospitals.  Public \nhospital  facilities  and  services  in  Ulaanbaatar  include  16  clinical  and  tertiary  hospitals  and \ncenters  and  some  46  hospitals  of  various  types,  in  a  city  of  around  900,000.  In  addition  to \nsurplus capacity and staff, shortcomings include inappropriate hospital admissions and clinical \npractices,  poor  distribution  of  limited  technology,  fragmentation  of  funding  sources  and \nadministrative services, limited use of information, and rigid planning and budgeting.  \n \n23. \nPerverse  payment  incentives  encourage  inefficient  use  of  in-patient  services,  and \nhospital  stays,  at  an  average  of  9\u201311  days,  are  unnecessarily  long.  The  hospital  sector  still \nabsorbs  most  of  government  investment.  There  is  also  a  large  and  growing  private  sector  of \nsmall  hospitals,  clinics,  laboratories,  and  pharmacies.  The  hospital  sector  overall  has  grown \nsignificantly  over  the  last  few  years,  which  has  increased  the  number  of  beds,  admissions, \npersonnel, and costs. Various reviews have pointed to the need for administrative rationalization \n(or  optimization)  of  the  hospital  sector,  and  particularly  in  Ulaanbaatar.  This  should  include \n\nCurrent Issues and Concerns in the Mongolian Health Sector \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n31 \n\nmerging and closing of small specialist hospitals; reducing duplication of services; reorganizing \nservices and hospitals based on defined population needs, and alignment of clinical services. It \nhas  been  estimated  that  7\u201310  hospitals  could  adequately  and  efficiently  serve  Ulaanbaatar\u2019s \npopulation along with rural referrals. Savings from increasing the efficiency of the hospital sector \ncould be used to fund investments in public health and PHC. Potential savings from optimization \nare estimated at MNT1 billion\u2013MNT3 billion annually.3   \n \n24. \nGrowth of the Private Health Sector. In Mongolia, the opening of the market economy \nhas  encouraged  significant  growth  in  the  private  health  sector.  Government  policy  enables \nprivate hospitals to compete with the public sector, and HIF funding allows private hospitals to \nreceive  reimbursement  for  patients  under  public  subsidy.  In  principle,  private  health  care  can \ndeliver quality and efficiency to the health sector, contribute to meeting health system goals, and \ncomplement public provision in an integrated fashion. However, in Mongolia the private sector is \npractically unregulated and has been growing very rapidly. There are no standards to determine \nquality  of  service  and  patient  safety;  no  definitions  or  criteria  for  defining  the  scope  of  clinical \nservices;  and  no  standards  for  premises,  infrastructure,  or  equipment.  Many  private  hospitals \nconsist of only 4\u20138 beds and have no insurance.  \n \n25. \nA functioning institutional and regulatory environment is needed in Mongolia to facilitate \nthe appropriate involvement of the private sector in the planned and strategic delivery of health \nservices. Mongolia needs policies for private sector development, accreditation of hospitals and \nfacilities, and regulatory mechanisms to monitor performance and ensure safety and quality of \ncare. \n \n26. \nInadequate  Support  for  PHC.  Despite emphasizing the importance of PHC in various \nlaws, regulations, and policies, support for public health and for the most significant element of \nPHC  development  in  Mongolia,  the  FGP  system,  has  been  inconsistent.  Since  the  initial \nestablishment  of  FGPs  in  1999\u20132001,  the  situation  for  family  doctors  has  deteriorated,  with \nseverely constrained funding resulting in low and decreasing doctor and nurse incomes, as well \nas a lack of investment in infrastructure, premises, and equipment. Moreover, there are unclear \nlegal and regulatory processes that disadvantage doctors\u2019 status and social standing.  \n \n27. \nLack of Governance, Monitoring, and Regulation. A principal reason for many of the \nhealth  system  problems  is  weakness  in  governance  and  regulation.  Government  and  its \nagencies have paid insufficient attention to monitoring, direction and guidance, as evidenced by \nthe uncontrolled growth of the private sector; lack of a legal basis for FGPs; lack of application \nof routine administrative, financial and clinical data; and, until the recent initiation of  the Master \nPlan process, lack of overall strategic direction. \n \nC. \n \nIn  the  transition  from  a  Soviet-based  health  system  towards  a  mixed  public-private \n28. \nmodel  focusing  on  PHC  with  coordinated  secondary  and  tertiary  services,  Mongolia  has  had \nonly uneven success to date. Overall, health outcomes and indicators are improving, but in the \nhealth system generally there are significant problems of poor quality of care, inefficiency, and \ninadequate  implementation  of  reform  and  improvement  strategies.  The  HSMP,  with  its  sector-\nwide approach, provides a sound basis to make progress on these and other issues. \n \n \n\nConclusions  \n\n                                                 \n3  World Bank. 2006. \n\n \n\n\fEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE HEALTH SECTOR IN MONGOLIA \n \n\nTotal Value of \nProjects \n($ million) \n\n \nPeriod of \nImplementation \n\nMultilateral Agencies \n\n \n \nDescription \n\n2003\u20132008 \n \n \n \n2005\u20132007 \n \n \n2005\u20132007 \n \n \n \n2005\u20132008 \n \n \n2005\u20132008 \n \n \n \n\nHealth sector reform, rural infrastructure development, improved \nprimary  health  care,  capacity  development,  and  policy  reforms \nthrough the Second Health Sector Development Project \n \nGrant  to  improve  nutrition  for  poor  mothers  and  children  and  to \nreduce iodine deficiency and anemia \n  \nGrant  for  Information  and  Communication  Technology  aimed  at \nimproving  rural  communications  and  linkages  to  impact  on \nmaternal mortality and infant mortality rates \n \nGrant  for  Maternal  Mortality  Reduction  aimed  at  reducing \nmaternal mortality and risk \n \nHIV/AIDS Prevention and Human Trafficking.

development to improve population health \noutcomes. Project aimags were selected based on objective criteria, including population health \nstatus and morbidity, infrastructure status, poverty levels, commitment of local authorities, and \nprevious  low  levels  of  investment.  Each  criterion  was  ranked  and  scaled  individually  and  a \nweighted aggregate score derived for each aimag. Aimags for each phase of the Project are set \nout below. The combined population of the five aimags and two duuregs is 688,660 or 26.8% of \nthe total population. Overall, 40% of the covered aimag population is poor. Additional details on \nhealth issues and health services in project aimags are set out in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n\nTable A6.1:  Aimag and District Poverty and Health Indicators \n\n \n\n \n \n \nAimag \n \nAimags \nArkhangai \nDundgobi \nGobi Altai \nSukhbaatar \nTuv \n   Total \n \nDuuregs \nChingeltei \nSonginokhairkhan \n   Total \n \nAimag average \nMongolia \nUlaanbaatar  \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \nPercentage\nPoor \n\n \nInfant Mortality  \nRate per 1,000 \nLive Births \n\nMaternal \nMortality Rate \nper 100,000 Live \nBirths \n \n \n\n \n \n\nVery Poor \n\nPopulation and Poverty \nPoor \n \n36,289 \n11,739 \n19,503 \n10,276 \n16,549 \n94,356 \n \n \n23,662 \n17,286 \n40,948 \n \n\n \n14,167 \n7,482 \n8,087 \n4,543 \n9,687 \n43,966 \n \n \n6,705 \n10,371 \n17,076 \n \n\nTotal \n \n\n90,452 \n49,406 \n63,973 \n52,431 \n88,460 \n344,722 \n \n \n132,883 \n211,056 \n343,939 \n \n \n256,2000 \n946,907 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n           23.4 \n19.2 \n25.2 \n25.9 \n15.9 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n22.5 \n20.7 \n18.1 \n\n56 \n39 \n43 \n28 \n30 \n40 \n \n \n23 \n13 \n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n\n207.0 \n\u2014 \n173.8 \n117.6 \n\u2014 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n105.7 \n93 \n73.3 \n\n  Source: Ministry of Health and National Center for Health Development. 2007. \n   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n37 \n\nPROJECT COST ESTIMATES \n \n\nTable A7.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category  \n($\u2019000) \n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n \n\n \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotala \n\n \n\nInformation, Education, and Communication \n\nInvestment Costs \n1.

Improved  health  care  expands  economic  opportunities  for  people,  including  the  poor  and \ndisadvantaged,  by  building  human  capital,  as  expressed  in  good  health,  well-being  and  capacity  for  work.  Healthy \npeople  actively  engage  in  economic  activities,  thus  increasing  productivity.  Reliable  health  services  reduce  such \nlifecycle risks to the individual as illness, injury, disability, and early death, thereby also preventing impoverishment.  \n \nImproving  health  services  and  the  health  status  of  the  population  will  reduce  government  as  well  as  household \nexpenditure. Mongolia\u2019s extensive system of social safety nets costs about 7% of gross domestic product per year, of \nwhich  40%  is  devoted  to  social  assistance  for  the  poor  and  the  disadvantaged.  Maintaining  and  improving  social \nservice delivery prevents new incidences of poverty that are caused by poor health and educational deprivation.   \n \nIn Mongolia, access and quality of social services is both a push and a pull factor in current migration. Rural people \nwith few adequate skills and experience living in settled areas face problems in coping with urban life. Moreover, they \nhave limited support networks and few income earning opportunities. Therefore, the risk of falling into poverty is high. \nImproving health services in rural and peri-urban areas will significantly slow migration and reduce poverty.  \n \nThe Project will contribute to achieving Mongolia\u2019s Millennium Development Goals, particularly goals 4, 5, and 6 and \ntargets 5, 6, 7, and 8 to (i) reduce by two thirds the under-five mortality rate, (ii) reduce by three quarters the maternal \nmortality  rate,  (iii)  halt  by  2015  and  begin  to  reverse  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS,  and  (iv)  halt  by  2015  and  begin  to \nreverse the incidence of malaria and other major diseases. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nAccording to the HIE/LSM 2002/03 survey,1 around 900,000, or 36%, of Mongolians live in poverty.2 Poverty is higher \nin  rural  areas  than  in  urban  areas  (43%  versus  30%).  The  so-called  poverty  gap  stands  at  11%  and  estimates  the \naverage shortfall in consumption relative to the poverty line. This figure implies that the per person cost of eliminating \npoverty is 11% of the poverty line. \n \nIn contrast to the head count or to the poverty gap, the severity of poverty is 4.7%. Both, the poverty gap and severity \nare higher in rural than in urban areas. At the regional level, the West is the poorest region. The poverty incidence in \nthe  West  represents  more  than  half  of  the  population.  This  figure  is  almost  two  fifths  in  the  Highland  region  and \naround one third in both the Central and East regions.  \n \nUlaanbaatar displays the country\u2019s lowest level of poverty, and slightly more than one quarter of its residents are poor. \nFollowing the capital city by poverty measures are the aimag (provincial) centers and then rural areas. \n \nHealth challenges in Mongolia include maternal mortality rates, a high incidence of tuberculosis, and  poor quality  of \npublic  health  care  services.  Over  the  last  10  years,  Mongolia  has  achieved  certain  progress  in  reducing  infant \nmortality  and  mortality  of  children  under  5  years  of  age.  A  2003  survey  established  that  the  causes  of  maternal \nmortality are associated with decreasing level and quality of medical services (36%), delay in emergency medical aid \n(28%), and living far from medical institutions. \n \nChild  and  maternal  mortality  are  directly  linked  to  poverty.  Infants  and  undernourished  pregnant  women  from  poor \nfamilies are much more likely to die or suffer complications than are well-nourished mothers and their offspring.3 The \ninfant mortality rate per 1,000 live births has fallen from 31.23 in 2000 to 20.8 in 2005. The under-5 child mortality rate \nhas also decreased from 42.4 to 26.1. The rural-urban  gap  remains substantial, however, as those figures are 18.1 \nand 21.7, respectively, in urban areas but 22.5 and 28.9 in rural areas. The  two most frequent and persistent causes  \n\nTargeting Classification: Targeted intervention (TI-M) \n\n                                                 \n1    National  Statistical  Office  (NSO).  2004a.

Gobi-Altai is among the five aimags with the highest infant mortality rates.   \n \nThe  maternal  mortality  rate  steadily  decreased  to  93.0  per  100,000  live  births  in  2005  from  its  highest  level  of  161 \nduring 1996\u20131998.4 In the same period, this measure\u2019s rural-urban gap narrowed from 2 to 1.4 times. In 2005, 13.8% \nof  pregnant  women  had  chronic  anemia,  significantly  lower  than  the  40%  in  2000.  Almost  half  (54.2%)  of  maternal \nmortality  occurs  among  herdswomen  and  30.8%  among  housewives.  Although  home  delivery  has  decreased  since \n2000,  professionally  unassisted  delivery  is  increasing  in  Ulaanbaatar.  That  is  apparently  due  to  the  high  rate  of \nmigration  without  residence  registration.  Primary  causes  of  mortality  are  diseases  not  related  to  pregnancy  (33%), \nfollowed  by  complications  post-delivery  (26%)  and  during  pregnancy  (24%).5 The  Reproductive  Health-2003  survey \nreveals that only 4% of adolescent girls use contraceptives and, as a result, over half (53.6%) of abortions were first-\ntime pregnancies.   \n \nDue  in  part  to  persistent  poverty  and  crowded  family  living  conditions,  the  incidence  of  tuberculosis  is  consistently \nrising (from 8 per 10,000 of population in 1990 to 17.2 in 2005) in both rural and urban areas. The highest rates are in \nDarkhan-Uul, Dornod, and Ulaanbaatar. In 2005, it was the third most common infectious disease (13.6%), preceded \nby  sexually  transmitted  diseases  (17.4%)  and  viral  hepatitis  (19.7%).  Syphilis  and  gonorrhea  are  growing  concerns, \nhaving increased by more than 2.5 times since 1991. There are 30 cases of individuals diagnosed HIV positive and \nfour cases of death from AIDS. \n \nPoor people tend to be more affected by infectious diseases. Mongolia is one of seven Asia-Pacific countries cited by \nWorld  Health  Organization  as  having  high  incidence  of  tuberculosis.  Most  people  with  tuberculosis  are  unemployed \nand either poor or extremely  poor. There are also male health concerns, such as a comparatively  high incidence of \nstroke and heart disease from age 40 onwards. This appears to be linked to poor diet, high levels of tobacco use, and \nalcohol  abuse.  According  to  HIE/LSM  2002/03  survey,  health  spending  averages  5%  of  household  consumption  for \nthe population as a  whole. For poor households, that figure averages 4.5% and for non-poor households it is 5.4%. \nBecause of their inability to pay for the services in cash, medical services consumption of the poor is quite low. The \nincidences  of  major  diseases  causing  morbidity  and  mortality  are  increasing  among  rural  populations.  This \ndemonstrates that the quality and availability of medical services in rural areas is poor and inadequate.  \n \nThe Project will be implemented in five rural aimags (Arkhangai, Dundgovi, Govi-Altai, Sukhbaatar, and Tuv) and two \nduuregs of Ulaanbaatar (Chingeltei and Songinokhairkhan) benefiting client population or more than 700,000. About \n40.4% of the population in the project aimags is poor, compared to the national average of 36%. Overall, the Project \naims to improve and extend primary health care (PHC) services to benefit the Mongolian population, in particular, the \nrural poor, the urban underserved, women, children, and the elderly.                                                                                  \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nIs there a participation strategy? \nThe  project  activities  have  been  guided  by  participatory  research  undertaken  in  proposed  project  areas.  Four \nstakeholder  groups  were  identified  and  consulted  across  a  range  of  issues.  Primary  stakeholders  included  service \nusers  and  service  providers  at  the  bag  (village),  soum  (district),  and  aimag  levels,  and  in  Ulaanbaatar.  About  127 \nbeneficiaries  from  Songinokhairkhan  district,  Baruun-Urt  (aimag  center)  and  Dariganga  soums  of  Sukhbaatar  aimag \nparticipated in the consultation process by assessing the coverage and quality of primary health care. \n \nParticular  emphasis  was  given  to  consulting  with  the  poor  and  women\u2019s  groups  in  the  communities  in  order  to \nunderstand  their  needs  and  demands  of  health  services.  Secondary  stakeholders  consisted  of  national  and  local \npolicy  and  decision  makers.  Consultation  discussions  indicated  a  range  of  health  and  social  concerns  in  the \ncommunity,  but  the  focus  was  strongest  on  the  need  for  increased  collaboration  between  the  communities,  local \ninstitutions, and local authorities for improving access and quality of PHC.  \n \nGreater  involvement  of  stakeholders  on  promoting  health  is  ensured  by  introducing  community  involvement \nmechanisms, such as the following: (i) hospital boards will be established with community members, representatives \nof nongovernment organization, and others, (ii) local social workers and health volunteers will play a significant role in \nlinking the very poor and families with soum doctors, and (iii) health-promoting organizations will enhance cooperation \nbetween institutions and the community. The Project aims to shift people\u2019s attitudes from curative to preventive care, \nwhich  requires  greater  involvement  of  individuals  and  community  organizations.  The  Project    will    also  (i)  undertake \noutreach, health promotion, public health, surveillance, and primary care training programs for soum hospital staff and \nrural and urban family group practices; (ii) raise awareness among the population, health workers, and policymakers \non  the  extent  and  effects  of  catastrophic  payments;  and  (iii)  develop  and  implement  in  project  areas  participatory \nmechanisms and processes for increased community involvement, including complaints procedures, public reporting, \nand advisory bodies. \n                                                 \n4  National Center for Health Development. 2005.

Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nHealth status of the population in the country is highly differentiated by gender. Male adult mortality is nearly double \nthat of females. On the other hand, as women comprise the majority of users and providers of the health care system \nin  Mongolia,  they  will  make  up  the  majority  of  the  Project\u2019s  direct  beneficiaries.  Nevertheless,  there  is  potential  to \nmaximize  project  impact  on  the  health  status  of  the  poor,  women,  and  other  disadvantaged  groups  by  emphasizing \nthe pro-poor orientation of PHC. A gender plan has been prepared and is presented in Appendix 13. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \nA gender plan has been prepared. \n \nE.

The  Project  will  not  initiate \nany user fees or co-financing  of PHC services that affect \naffordability  for  service  users.  In  facilitating  financial \nprotection for the poor\u2014for example, by increasing health \ninsurance  coverage,  and  improving  legal  knowledge  of \nservice  providers  and  service  users  on  health-related \nstate  welfare  provisions\u2014the  Project  will  enhance  poor \nand disadvantaged groups\u2019 utilization of PHC facilities.  \nThe  Project  will  develop  career  development  support  for \nPHC  service  providers.  Providing  incentives  to  work  in \nrural  areas  will  fill  vacant  positions  for  bag  feldshers  and \nsoum doctors. That will increase women\u2019s participation in \nthe labor force.  \n\n(the  Dariganga \n\nOnly  one  of  the  proposed  project  areas  has  a  significant \npresence  of  an  ethnic  group \nin \nSukhbaatar).

There is potential to maximize the \nproject  impact  on  the  health  status  of  the  poor,  women,  and  other  disadvantaged  groups, \nhowever,  by  emphasizing  the  pro-poor  orientation  of  primary  health  care  (PHC).  The  main \nstrategy  of  the  Project  is  to  strengthen  public  health  education,  health  promotion,  and  the \nprevention  aspects  of  PHC,  thus  taking  another  step  towards  a  more  efficient  preventive \napproach.  The  Government\u2019s  Health  Sector  Master  Plan  also  acknowledges  that  the  goal  of \nimproving the health status and lifestyles of Mongolians cannot be achieved by efforts purely in \nthe  health  sector.  Hence,  it  is  necessary  to  undertake  strategies  to  improve  intersectoral \ncollaboration  and  coordination  (between  local  governments,  national-level  health  program \ncommittees and boards, the professional inspection agency, educational institutions, water and \nsanitation  services,  police,  nongovernment  organizations  including  women\u2019s  groups,  schools, \nand other community groups) in order to mobilize local initiatives, responsibility, and ownership. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  proposed  project  has  design  features  that  promote  gender  equity  in  the  health \nsector  that  can  contribute  to  achieving  the  Government\u2019s  and  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s \ncommon goal of poverty alleviation.  \n\nProgram Design \n\n3. \nThe  Project  will  implement  a  gender  plan  that  will  create  opportunities  and  facilitate \naccess  to  health  services  for  men  and  women.  It  will  address  gender  concerns  in  the  four \ncomponents,  namely:  (i)  providing  quality  and  accessible  health  services,  (ii)  improving  health \ncare  financing  and  health  insurance,  (iii)  enhancing  human  resource  development,  and  (iv) \nsector  capacity  development  and  management.  The  gender  plan  will  provide  a  framework  to \nenhance women\u2019s active and equitable participation in Project\u2019s implementation and monitoring. \n \n4. \n \n\nThe Project will address the following gender concerns: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nEnsure the development of pro-poor and gender-sensitive information, education, \nand communication materials, as well as their further replication, adaptation, and \ndistribution  through  family  group  practices  (FGPs)  and  soum  health  centers \n(SHCs) in the country. \nIncorporate  gender  in  health,  domestic  violence,  and  other  relevant  health \npromotion,  education,  and  prevention  modules  in  the  in-service  health  training \n(for doctors, nurses, and feldshers). \nExplore  adoption  of  a  requirement  for  reporting  registration  of  incidents  of \ndomestic violence among women and children. \nExplicitly  target  men\u2019s  and  women\u2019s  needs  for  health-seeking  behavior  and \nhealthy lifestyles by improving outreach to such disadvantaged groups as single-\nheaded  households, \ntemporary  residents,  and \nnonresidents.  \nIncrease the number of poor, disadvantaged, and disabled men and women who \nare insured. \n\nthe  disabled, \n\nthe  elderly, \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 13      51   \n\n \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n(ix) \n\nImprove  monitoring  and  reporting  of  household  expenditures,  out-of-pocket \npayments, and utilization of FGPs and SHCs (with data disaggregated by gender \nof household head). \nSupport  gender  awareness  raising  for  human  resource  development  and \nadvocacy for gender-sensitive human resource policies in the Ministry of Health. \nImprove gender analysis capacity of relevant management. \nInstitutionalize  collection,  analysis,  and  evidence  extraction  for  policy  making  of \nhealth sector data, disaggregated by gender and poverty level. \n\nImplementation Arrangements  \n\n \n5. \nA  detailed  gender  plan  including  monitoring  indicators  and  agencies  responsible  for \nimplementing and monitoring the gender plan is presented in Table A13. The gender analysis of \nthe Project is set out in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \nC. \n \n6. \nThe implementation of the gender plan follows the implementation arrangements for the \nProject.  The  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  will  have  a  project  manager  and  five  staff  for \nplanning and human resources, administration and finance, civil works, secretarial services, and \na  driver.  At  the  aimag  level,  there  will  be  an  aimag  project  coordinator  assisted  by  staff  for \ntraining, quality, and civil works. Project activities in the capital city will be managed by the PIU. \nThe Project will deploy a part time (10 person-months in total) gender specialist in the PIU over \nthe duration of the Project. The gender specialist will ensure implementation of the gender plan \nand will be responsible for gender analysis and aspects of data; adopted policies; standards and \nguidelines;  gender  sensitivity  in  advocacy  and  awareness  rising  within  the  MOH  and  PIU; \ninformation,  education,  and  communication;  resource  materials;  and  health  professionals \ntraining. The terms of reference of the gender specialist are in Appendix 11. \n \nD. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring \n\n7. \nThe activity indicators specified in the gender plan will serve for monitoring gender plan \noutcomes.  In  addition,  a  set  of  gender-disaggregated  indicators  will  be  used  for  the  Project\u2019s \ngender  impact  monitoring.  Strengthening  of  the  gender-disaggregated  data  will  be  included  in \nthe project performance management system to track gender gaps in health outcomes and for \nanalyzing trends discussed in project progress reports. \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\nh\n\nt\nl\n\na\ne\nH\nn\na\n\n \n\ni\nl\n\no\ng\nn\no\nM\nd\nn\na\n\n \n\n \n)\n\nH\nO\nM\n\n(\n \n\nh\n\nt\nl\n\na\ne\nH\n\n \nf\n\no\n

     \n\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES \n \n\nIntroduction \n\nEconomic Parameters and Assumptions \n\nA. \n \n1. \nThe  economic  analysis  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  Asian  Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB) Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects and Handbook for the Economic \nAnalysis  of  Health  Sector  Projects.1 The  analysis  covers  the  review  of  the  project  economic \ncontribution to the health system and effects of the Project on the beneficiaries and long-term \nfiscal position of the Ministry of Health (MOH).  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe economic analysis of the Project was conducted over 20 years, inclusive, of project \nconstruction. Project construction will commence in 2009 and be completed in 2013. Economic \nbenefits and costs were denominated in terms of the domestic price numeraire and expressed \nin  constant  2007  prices.  International  costs  were  converted  to  local  currency  costs  using  an \nexchange  rate  that  started  at  MNT1,200  per  $1.  Tradable  components  were  adjusted  to \neconomic  prices  using  a  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  of  1.017,  and  nontraded  components \nwere valued at domestic market prices.2 Shadow wage rate factors of 1.2 and 0.8 were applied \nto the wages of skilled and unskilled labor, respectively, at the domestic price level. \n \nBase costs plus physical contingencies were estimated and apportioned on the basis of \n3. \ntradable,  nontradable,  and  skilled  and  unskilled \nlabor  costs.  Similarly,  operation  and \nmaintenance  costs  for  each  subproject  were  estimated  on  the  basis  of  skilled  and  unskilled \nlabor valued in economic prices (i.e., using shadow wage rate factors). \n  \nC. \n \n4. \nThe Project supports the Mongolian health system\u2019s efforts to improve the health status \nof  the  population.  Economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  were  derived  for  the  Project.  The \nmain  benefits  quantified  were  resource  cost  savings  and  productivity  gains.  Resource  cost \nsavings consist of reduction in out-of-pocket expenses for health care as a result of reforms in \nhealth  financing.  Productivity  gains  are  the  results  of  less  time  lost  to  illness  that  would  have \notherwise  been  utilized  in  some  economic  activity.  Productivity  gains  are  also  realized  when \nless  time  is spent  for  the  care  of  sick  family  members,  as well  as  better  learning outcomes  of \nchildren  who  will  eventually  join  the  labor  force. 3  Direct  and  indirect  health  benefits  are \nsignificant  due  to  fewer  days  lost  at  work  and  school  and  a  general  increase  in  the  overall \nquality  of  life.  The  analysis  does  not  attempt  to  quantify  all  economic gains  and  only  provides \nconservative estimates based on benefit streams that can be quantified. \n \nD. \n \n5. \nCost  Savings.  These  are  the  annual  benefits  expected  as  a  result  of  savings  from \naverage  out-of-pocket  expenses  expected  to  be  incurred  had  the  patient  been  treated  at  a \nprivate  hospital  rather  than  at  a  public  health  center.  Benefits  are  calculated  based  on \n\nQuantification of Economic Benefits \n\nEconomic Benefit Assumptions \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997.

Manila. \n\n2  Since  the  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  is  so  close  to  unity,  it  does  not  appear  that  project  costing,  which  is \npresently at a preliminary stage, is very sensitive to shadow exchange rates. This assessment is supported by the \nfact  that  the  difference  between  the  official  exchange  rate  and  the  \u201cstreet  rate\u201d  over  the  past  year  has  been  an \naverage of only 3%. \n\n3  ADB Economics and Research Department. 2003. Technical Note No. 6. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14          55 \n\nEconomic Cost Assumptions \n\nMNT120,000  annual  incremental  costs  that  a  patient  will  incur  to  go  to  a  private  facility, \nassuming two4 visits a year. The base case assumes that out-of-pocket spending on health care \nis reduced from MNT120,000 per year to MNT108,000 per year in the target aimag (savings of \nMNT12,000  per  person  per  year).  Given  the  low  level  of  household  income  of  the  poor  in \nMongolia,  this  represents  a  significant  savings  for  many  households.  In  the  calculation  of \nbenefits,  the  target  population  in  the  five  aimags  (provinces)  and  two  duuregs  (districts)  in \nUlaanbaatar were used to calculate the number of patients that will benefit from the Project. The \nannual  number  of  patients  that  will  incur  cost  savings  is  based  on  the  difference  between  the \nhealth incidence with and without the Project. \n \n6. \nProductivity.  Improving  the  health  status  of  the  population  will  lead  to  fewer  days  lost \ndue  to  illness  and  fewer  days  needed  to  take  care  of  ill  relatives  than  without  the  health \ninterventions  introduced  by  the  Project.  Time  is  valued  at  MNT4,133  per  day  based  on \nprevailing wages.5 This value of time is assumed to be constant for the entire population. The \neconomically active population that will require hospital care is assumed to be 60%.6  The base \ncase assumes that an average of 2 days per year will be gained per capita due to more efficient \ntreatment  and  better  availability  of  services.  At  the  prevailing  wage  of  MNT4,133  per  day,  the \nmonetary value of the productivity gain is MNT8,265 per person.    \n \nE. \n \n7. \nEconomic  costs  were  calculated  based  on  the  annual  project  cost  disbursements  and \nincremental recurrent costs. It is assumed that for each MNT spent on investment an additional \nMNT0.10 per year is spent on operation and maintenance of the new health facilities. The cost \nof  administering  the  Project  (including  the  cost  to  MOH  of  administering  the  grant,  the  cost  of \nconsultants, and monitoring and evaluation of the Project) are also included as a component of \nthe recurrent cost.  \n \nF. \n \n8. \nThe basic rates of return for the Project are shown in Table A14. The Project yields an \neconomic internal rate of return of 22.8% and a net present value of MNT11.3 billion. The net \npresent  value  calculation  discounts  the  cost  and  benefit  streams  at  12%  in  real  terms. \nSensitivity  analysis  was  undertaken  to  test  the  sensitivity  of  the  Project  to  less  optimistic \nassumptions.  The  \u201cless  cost  savings\u201d  scenario  assumes  that  the  Project  is  not  successful  in \nreducing  out-of-pocket  expenses.  The  \u201cfewer  sick  days  saved\u201d  scenario  assumes  that  the \nProject does not reduce the number of sick days lost due to illness and the \u201clow participation\u201d \nscenario assumes that the uptake of the Project is slower than expected. The low case scenario \ncombines  \u201cless  cost  savings\u201d  and  \u201clower  productivity\u201d  from  lives  saved.  Even  with  the  most \npessimistic  assumptions,  the  Project  has  a  positive  rate  of  return  of  17.1%.  In  general,  these \nfactors are not enough to overturn the judgment that the Project is socially beneficial.  \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n\n                                                 \n4   The average number of visits per person per year over the past 3 years is 2.5, according to the National Center for \nHealth Development, Ministry of Health. 2005. 2005 Health Indicators.

The  incremental  recurrent  costs  of  the  Project  arise  largely  from \nincreased access to quality health care. \n  \n10. \nThe  financial  sustainability  analysis  evaluates  the  impact  of  the  Project  on  the \ngovernment  budget.  The  total  financing  cost  of  the  Project,  inclusive  of  taxes,  duties,  and \ncontingencies,  is  $17.6  million  for  around  5  years.  The  Government\u2019s  annual  share  in  project \ncosts will average around $719,000 equivalent (MNT863 million), or less than 1% of the health \nsector  projected  annual  budget  of about  $87.2  million. The  recurrent costs  to  be borne  by  the \nGovernment  during  the  implementation  of  the  Project  are  estimated  to  be  about  $107,000 \nequivalent  (MNT128  million)  per  year  and  include  the  operating  expenses  of  the  project \nimplementation  unit;  as  well  as  operation,  maintenance,  and  replacement  costs  of  new  and \nupgraded  health  facilities  and  equipment.  The  family  group  practices  under  the  Project  will \ncontinue  to  be  funded  by  the  Government  during  and  after  the  Project\u2019s  implementation.  The \nbudgetary impact of the estimated annual recurrent costs during implementation of the Project is \nconsidered  minimal.  The  local  government  units  will  share  in  the  costs  of  operation  and \nmaintenance of the rehabilitated soum hospitals. The Government is committed to provide the \nnecessary funds to ensure that the benefits of the investment are not lost. It was concluded that \nthere was a capacity and willingness in the Government to allocate budgetary resources to the \nhealth sector and the proposed project. \n     \nH. \n \n11. \nA  financial  management  assessment  of  MOH  has  been  undertaken  using  the  financial \nmanagement  assessment  questionnaire  provided  by  ADB.  The  completed  questionnaire  is \npresented  in  Supplementary  Appendix  G.  It  determines  the  accounting  and  financial  capacity \nneeds  of  MOH  during  project \nimplementation  and  operations  after  completion.  The \nquestionnaire was administered to the finance department of MOH. The assessment of MOH\u2019s \nprevious  experience  of  managing  ADB  loan  projects  confirms  that  its  financial  management \npractices are fully adequate for the implementation of the Project.  \n \n \n \n\nFinancial Management Assessment  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 15         57 \n\nSYNOPSIS OF THE SUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION  \n \n\nIntroduction  \n\nA.  \n \nAccording  to  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  procedures  for  environmental  and  social \n1. \nreview of projects, the Third Health Sector Development Project is in environmental category B. \nA limited number of specific environmental impacts may result from project implementation but \ncan  be  avoided  or  mitigated  by  adhering  to  generally  recognized  performance  standards, \nguidelines, or design criteria. The following potential environmental, health, and safety impacts \nwere  analyzed:  (i)  comprehensive  waste  management  plan,  including  medical  waste  handling \nand  disposal;  (ii)  liquid  waste  and  sewage  disposal;  (iii)  management  of  construction  impacts \nover the planned building period (sediment and erosion control, emissions, noise, traffic, worker \nhealth  and  safety);  (iv)  hygiene  and  implementation  of  good  hospital  management  practices; \nand (v) employee health and safety training. The summary initial environmental examination is \nin Supplementary Appendix L. \n \n \nB.  \n \n2. \nThe Project impact is to improve Mongolians\u2019 health status and lifestyle. The Project has \nfour components: (i) strengthened health service, (ii) strengthened health sector financing and \nhealth  insurance,  (iii)  improved  human  resource  capacity  in  the  health  sector,  and  (iv) \nstrengthened  sector  capacity  development  and  management.  The  project  rationale  is  to \ncontinue  policy  reforms  advanced  under  previous  health  sector  development  initiatives: \nexpanding  and  improving  primary  health  care,  improving  financial  expenditure  for  increased \nsystem  efficiency,  expanding  health  insurance  coverage,  and  improving  human  resource \ncapacity.

The climate of the project areas is continental, with very hot, \ndry  summers  and  long,  cold  winters.  The  geographical  areas  in  which  the  project  sites  are \nlocated  are  characterized  by  open  landscapes  in  Dundgobi,  Gobi-Altai,  and  Sukhbaatar  with \nminimal vegetation and steppe. In mountain locations of Arkhangai and Tuv aimags (provinces) \nin  the  central  and  northern  part  of  country,  there  is  more  forest  vegetation.  Due  to  different \nclimatic  zones,  the  annual  precipitation  varies  between  400  millimeters  in  Arkhangai  and  Tuv \nand  120\u2013200  millimeters  in  Dundgobi  and  Gobi-Altai.  The  dominant  physical  environment  is \nconsidered  moderate  to  harsh.  Summer  and  winter  temperatures  vary  significantly,  due \nprimarily to differences in elevation (720\u20132,060 meters above sea level). The salient features of \nthe physical environment are given in Table A15.2. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 15           \n\nTable A15.2:  Matrix of Geographical and Meteorological Factors of Project Aimags \n\n \n\nAir Temperature (0C) \n\n \n \n \nAimag \nArkhangai  \nDundgobi \nGobi-Altai \nSukhbaatar \nTuv \nm/s = meters per second, E = east, mm = millimeter, N = north, NW = northwest, W = west. \nSource: Aimag Environment Report. 2002.

No  environmentally  sensitive  areas \n\n4. \nSurface  Water  and  Groundwater.  The  nearest  surface  water  is  located  at  least  20 \nkilometers away in the Tamir River, which is abundant and used to water livestock and irrigate \nvegetables. Surface water quality is acceptable. The city water supply system and solid waste \nmanagement have shifted to the private sector and is currently run by the Undrakh Company. \nThis  company  provides  the  hospital  with  good  and  abundant  cold  water  for  drinking,  washing, \nand  cooking  24  hours  a  day.  No  hot  water  is  supplied,  but  the  hospital  provides  it  through  an \ninstalled  small-scale  heating  system.  As  it  is  located  in  the  northern  part  of  the  country, \ngroundwater is sufficient, suitable, and used for drinking, washing, cooking, and irrigating.   \n \n5. \nwere observed near the soum (district) health centers (SHCs).  \n \n6. \nAir  Quality.  Outdoor  and  indoor  air  quality  are  satisfactory  for  the  hospital  and  health \ncenters.  However,  at  times  airborne  particulates  lower  the  air  quality.  The  movement  of \nlivestock,  pedestrians,  and  vehicles,  as  well  as  strong  winds,  may  at  times  cause  slight \ndeterioration of indoor air quality, but not frequently or severely enough to cause concern.  \n \n7. \nVegetation.  Vegetation  around  the  hospital  and  health  centers  is  typically  in  poor \ncondition due to disturbance by grazing livestock and vehicular and pedestrian traffic. However, \nthe traffic in the vicinity of the hospital complex is low.  \n \n8. \nEndangered Species, Wildlife, and Wildlife Habitat. There are no trees in the hospital \ncomplex. Aside from various domestic animals (dogs, sheep, horses, goats, and cows), wildlife \nin  and  around  the  hospital  is  limited  to  birds,  small  rodents,  and  common  insects  such  as \ngrasshoppers and flies. The presence of endangered species is unlikely.  \n \nD. \n \n9. \nAdministratively  aimags  are  divided  into  soums  and  bags  (villages).  Each  aimag \npopulation  is  around  19,000  (Arkhnagai  and  Tuv)  to  16,000  (Dundgobi  and  Gobi-Altai).  The \ntypical soum has population of 3,000\u20134,000, of which 80% is herder community living away from \nthe soum center and 20% are living in the soum\u2019s center.  \n \n10.  Most households of communities in soum and aimag centers live on khashaa (individual \nplots)  and  only  a  small  percent  of  the  population  live  in  apartments  connected  with  a  central \nwater  network  and  wastewater  system.  The  majority  of  plots  have  a  ger  (traditional  tent)  and \nsome have wood and mud or brick houses. The average plot is about 787 square meters and \nthe average permanent house is about 59 square meters. Wood is the primary building material. \nGers are typically 6 meters in diameter.   \n \n11. \nGer  areas\u2019  access  to  electricity  supplies  are  relatively  positive  and  sustainable  in  all \naimags. For heating and cooking, some 95% of households use a simple stove burning primarily \nwood and about 20\u201380% of households supplement their wood supply with coal. According to \n\nSocioeconomic Description \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 15         59 \n\nhealth statistics, respiratory disease occurrence is predominant among children of 0\u201314 years of \nage and is mainly related to air pollution. \n \n12. \nThe main source of income varies as herders generate their income from sale of dairy \nproducts  and  such  other  materials  as  wool,  cashmere,  and  meat.  People  in  soum  and  aimag \ncenters mainly work for government organizations and the private sector. \n \n13. \nAimag General Hospital. Solid waste collection and disposal are provided by the town \nauthority, but the hospital is responsible for the collection and disposal of its medical waste. This \nwaste is disposed of on the hospital premises by burning in a locally constructed incinerator. \n \n14. \nSoum  Health  Center.  Most facilities under the Project have similar problems, such as \nleaking roofs, structural cracking, limited electrical supplies, inefficient or nonoperating heating \nsystems,  poor  energy  efficient  design,  no  reticulated  water  supplies,  pit  latrines  for  sewerage \ndisposal,  and  unsatisfactory  methods  for  disposing  of  clinical  waste.  Many  buildings  are  more \nthan  30  years  old  and  have  had  little  or  no  maintenance  due  to  a  lack  of  financial  resources. \nExtreme weather conditions exacerbate the condition of the buildings. \n \n15.  Medical  wastes  were  normally  burned  in  a  simple  metal  drum  or  handmade  stove \nwithout  proper  filters.  Thus,  it  has  some  visual  impact  and  release  of  some  toxic  gas.  A  local \ndoctor  interviewed  reported  that  a  typical  SHC  (serving  3,000-4,000  people)  generates  3\u20135 \nkilograms of waste (200\u2013250 syringes, 30\u201340 plastic drip containers, and 100 gloves) per day. \n \nE.  \n \n\nEnvironmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures  \n\n1. \n\nConstruction Phase \n\n \n16. \nAdverse environmental impacts due to civil works will be minimal, of short duration, and \nmitigated  by  design  and  construction  project  management.  There  may  be  relocation  and \nremoval  of  existing  trees  and  plants  during  construction,  mainly  due  to  building  the  water \ndistribution  systems,  but  trees  around  selected  SHCs  and  family  group  practices  will  be \nreplanted  and  other  vegetation  restored.  Some  areas,  like  Tariat  soum,  Arkhangai,  have \npermafrost. These factors should be considered during building design and construction.  \n \nTo enhance energy efficiency, building standards will be applied to ensure that building \n17. \nseals are tight, making them resistant to leaks. The amount of heat required will be drastically \nreduced  by,  for  example,  insulating  foundations,  and  using  extruded  rigid  polyurethane \ninsulation, rigid insulation for roofs, and metal thermally glazed windows and external doors. \n \n\n2. \n\nOperation Phase \n\n \n18. \nSHCs  will  establish  water  use  contracts  with  local  governments.  Raw  water  quality  is \nmonitored  by  the  aimag  professional  inspection  agency  together  with  the  SHC  doctor.  Water \nquality  will  be  measured  against  the  national  water  quality  standards.  To  prevent  potentially \nharmful emissions from incinerators, emission stacks will be located downwind of buildings. The \nremaining  ash  and  residues  should  be  removed  and  transported  and  dumped  in  accordance \nwith established standards. The Project will establish water supply networks with septic sewage \nsystems  and  improve  management  of  hazardous  medical  waste  by  building  small  incinerators \nwith capacity to burn at least 5\u201310 kilograms of waste. \n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 15           \n\nF.  \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan  \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  aimag  environment  department  reviewed  and  approved  the  initial  environmental \n\n19. \nGovernment  procedures  require  that  the  Project\u2019s  Executing  Agency  apply  to  the  local \naimag  environmental  department  for  advice  and  clearance  on  environmental  matters.  That \ndepartment will (i) review the proposed project at the screening stage to determine the category \nof  potential  environmental  impact;  (ii)  review  the  assessment,  including  the  associated \nenvironmental  management  and  environmental  protection  plans;  and  (iii)  coordinate  with  the \nlocal professional inspection department.   \n \n20. \nexamination, including the environmental monitoring plan and impact mitigation measures.  \n \n21. \nThe  post-development  operations  phase  of  the  Project  is  monitored  by  the  aimag \nprofessional  inspection  department,  which  also  has  the  authority  to  require  suspension  of \nactivities if the conditions of environmental protection are not followed. The aimag professional \ninspection department has four main units, including the environment and safety office and the \nhealth  and  sanitation  office.  During  the  construction  period,  the  environment  and  safety \ninspectors will especially monitor use of such locally extracted resources as wood, water, and \nsand.  In  the  operational  period,  health  and  sanitation  inspectors  will  monitor  SHC  activities, \nincluding the operation of incinerators and water quality.     \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure  \n\nG.  \n \n22. \nIn  preparing  the  environmental  examination,  field  visits  and  interviews  were  conducted \non 16\u201317 April 2007 among community members of selected project sites. Local stakeholders, \nincluding  hospital  directors,  nurses,  patients  and  family  members  of  patients,  were  consulted. \nThe focuses of public consultation was to provide an introduction to the proposed project activity \nand assess the general attitude towards improving or building a new SHC, as well as the major \nenvironmental concerns of local affected people.  \n \n23. \nAll  community  members  were  positive  about  rehabilitating  or  building  a  new  SHC  and \nbelieved  that  the  improved  SHC  would  provide  better  primary  health  care.  The  main \nenvironmental concerns regarded noise and dust pollution during construction.  \n \nH.  \n\nFindings and Recommendations  \n\n24. \nBased on screening of possible environmental consequences, it was determined that the \nProject\u2019s  components  will  have  no  significant  environmental  impacts.  The  subprojects  will  not \nadversely affect natural resources and will greatly improve primary health care in rural areas. \n \n25. \nLocal collection of construction materials, such as wood, sand and other materials, will \nbe supervised and monitored by soum environment inspectors. Contractors must pay some fees \nunder the law on fees for use of natural resources adopted by parliament.  \n \n26. \nA water use contract will be established between the SHC and local government office. \nThe  quality  of  the  water  will  be  inspected  by  the  aimag  professional  inspection  department  to \nensure that it meets the national standard for water.  \n \nI.  \n \n27. \nIt  is  concluded  that  the  Project  can  be  classified  as  category  B  for  the  purpose  of \nenvironmental  impact.  It  will  thus  not  require  preparation  of  a  full  environmental  impact \nassessment.  \n\nConclusions  \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 17 October 2007) \n", "Currency Unit\nMNT1.00\n$1.00\n", "togrog (MNT) \n\u2013 \n$0.000848  \n= \n=  MNT1,180  \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \naimag general hospital \nfamily group practice \nhuman resource \nhuman resources development \nHealth Sector Development Program \nHealth Sector Master Plan \ninitial environmental examination \nMillennium Development Goal \nMinistry of Finance \nMinistry of Health \nMemorandum of Understanding \nMinistry of Social Welfare and Labor \nnational competitive bidding \noperation and maintenance \nprimary health care \nproject implementation unit \nproject performance monitoring system \nproject steering committee \nsoum health center \nSecond Health Sector Development Project \n", " \n \nGLOSSARY \n", "ADB \nAGH \nFGP \nHR \nHRD \nHSDP \nHSMP \nIEE \nMDG \nMOF \nMOH \nMOU \nMSWL \nNCB \nO&M \nPHC \nPIU \nPPMS \nPSC \nSHC \nSHSDP \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", " \n", " \n", " \naimag \nduureg \nfeldsher \nger \nsoum \n \n", "administrative unit (provincial) \nadministrative subunit of Ulaanbaatar City (district) \ncommunity-based health nurse \ntraditional tent \nadministrative subunit of the aimag/province (district) \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December. \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "Vice President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n \n", " \n \n \n", " \n", "C.
