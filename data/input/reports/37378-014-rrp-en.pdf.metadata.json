The additional financing is required to fund the \nchanges in project scope that includes design build and operation (DBO) of a desalination plant; \nand meet the cost overruns of the current project,2 whose performance is on track but requires \nrestructuring to deliver the project outcomes. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nAsian Development Bank support for Jaffna. The Jaffna Peninsula, which lies in the \nnorthernmost part of Sri Lanka, was one of the worst-affected areas from years of conflict in the \ncountry, and is an economically lagging region.3 Since the civil  war  ended in 2009, Jaffna has \nbeen growing with the population expected to increase from 610,000 in 2016 to 900,000 by 2030.4 \nThe  demand  for  basic  urban  services,  including  drinking  water,  is  increasing.  The  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  approved  the  Jaffna  and  Kilinochchi  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation \nProject in November 2010 (current project).5 It was the first initiative by a development partner \nto  support  Jaffna\u2019s  post-conflict  development  and  reconciliation  efforts.  The  current  project \naimed to treat, transport, and distribute 27,000 cubic meters (m3) of drinking water per day from \nIranamadu Tank (approximately 30 kilometers away from Jaffna town) to water-scarce Jaffna \nand nearby towns. It also aimed to improve sanitation infrastructure in Jaffna town and water \nresource management in the peninsula. \n \n4. \nPerformance  of  current  project  and  its  importance.  The  current  project  suffered \nsignificant  start-up  setbacks  resulting  in  implementation  delays  and  cost overruns. The  current \nproject was hampered by local farmers\u2019 objection to using Iranamadu Tank\u2019s water for drinking \nwater purposes, despite the consensus reached on water sharing at the loan appraisal stage. The \nremote  project  location  in  a  post-conflict  area  also  aggravated  the  challenges  due  to  weak \nimplementation  capacities.  By  2017,  the  ADB-financed  overhead  water  tanks  and  the  51-\nkilometer water pipes had been constructed under the current project. Considering the ongoing \n\n                                                 \n1  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2010.

Manila  (Loans  2710/2711-SRI).  The  project  title  was  revised  to  Jaffna  and  Kilinochchi  Water \nSupply Project in the project concept paper for additional financing, which ADB approved on 11 March 2016.  \n\n3  The region has high income poverty and income inequality. Poverty incidence in the Northern Province is estimated \nto be 10.9%, compared with 6.7% for the country as a whole. Government of Sri Lanka, Department of Census and \nStatistics. 2015.

Colombo; \n\nand Kilinochchi District Statistical Hand Book 2016. Colombo. \n\n5   The current project is financed by an ADB loan of $90 million, including an Asian Development Fund loan of $70 \nmillion equivalent (Loan 2711-SRI, now concessional loan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources as of 1 January \n2017), and ordinary capital resources of $20 million (Loan 2710 \u2013 SRI), along with \u20ac35 million (approximately $40 \nmillion) cofinancing from Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD), and was declared effective in May 2011. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nand completed works under the current project, and the current project\u2019s critical importance to the \nrehabilitation and reconstruction program of the Northern Province, the benefits of restructuring \nthe current project outweigh those of canceling it. The government is committed to the current \nproject  and  has  dedicated  significant  resources  to  improve  project  implementation,  including \nidentifying a new water supply source and meeting the cost overruns.6 As of 15 October 2017, \nthe cumulative current project contract awards totaled $62 million (75% of the ADB loan amounts), \nand disbursements totaled $35.4 million (43% of ADB loan amounts). The project implementation \nincluding the capacity building is rated as on track, and safeguards compliance has been met.7 \n \n5. \nDesalination  plant  and  other  sources  to  meet  Jaffna\u2019s  drinking  water  needs. \nAlthough  the  annual  rainfall  in  Jaffna  is  around  1,200  millimeters,  surface  water  sources  are \nlimited. The peninsula depends heavily on groundwater for drinking water and agriculture, the \nprimary  economic  activity.  However,  the  groundwater  aquifer  is  at  risk  from  over  extraction, \nresulting in the intrusion of seawater.8 Neither groundwater nor local surface water can meet the \nimmediate drinking water demand in Jaffna. After extensive consultations and review of various \noptions, including environmental assessment, a feasibility study identified production of drinking \nwater  from  seawater  through  a  reverse  osmosis  desalination  process  as  a  necessary  interim \nsolution  to  meet  the  urgent  drinking  water  needs  of  Jaffna.9 The  project  area  is  expected  to \nexperience increase in temperature and rainfall variability due to climate change, leading to higher \nrisk of droughts and worsening of drinking water availability. The desalination plant will directly \naddress water scarcity challenges caused by the climate change. Nevertheless, further efforts to \nuse  surface  water  are  still  needed  to  provide  drinking  water  to  the  entire  population  of  Jaffna, \nwhich  will  include  reaching  consensus  on  using  Iranamadu  Tank  for  both  irrigation  water  and \ndrinking water, an integrated water resource management approach, among others.  \n \n6. \nRestructuring of the current project. The current project needs restructuring primarily \nto accommodate the change of water source from Iranamadu Tank to a desalination plant and to \nstrengthen the water supply component. The following changes are proposed: (i) inclusion of a \ndesalination plant using a DBO contract; (ii) cancellation of a water treatment plant and bulk water \ntransportation  from  Iranamadu  Tank,  originally  cofinanced  by  the  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement  (AFD);  (iii)  exclusion  of  the  sewerage  component; 10  (iv)  inclusion  of  the \nhousehold  water  connections;  and  (v)  inclusion  of  water  resource  management  and  outreach \nactivities. Based on the revised cost estimates and the cancellation of the AFD cofinancing, the \ngovernment has requested additional financing of $120 million from ADB to meet the change in \nproject scope and cost overruns.11 The closing date of the current loan has been extended from \n14 August 2017 to 31 December 2020 to complete the revised project scope through the current \nproject and the proposed additional financing.12 \n \n\n                                                 \n6   Cost overruns of $26.7 million were due to delay in the project implementation, and higher bid prices because of \n\nchallenging working conditions in post-conflict areas.   \n\n7  Summary of Project Performance and the piggyback TA (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n\n8   This had resulted in high salinity of up to 3,000 milligrams per liter in some places. \n9  ADB. 2014.

Manila. \n\n10 The government is in discussions with AFD to fund the sewage management through a separate arrangement. The \nTA under the additional financing will support development of sanitation plans, including septage management. \n11  The  additional  financing  was  included  in  ADB.  2017.

Construction needs to be coordinated, especially pipe laying that needs to be done closer to desalination plant \ncompletion, to ensure integrity of the pipes. \n\n2). \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\fAdditional  financing  and  eligibility  criteria.  Taking  into  account  the  proposed \n7. \nrestructuring, the project meets the eligibility criteria for additional financing.13 The overall project \n(i) remains technically feasible, economically viable, and financially sound; (ii) is accorded high \npriority  by  the government; (iii)  is  consistent  with  the current  project\u2019s  development  objectives; \nand  (iv)  is  consistent  with  the  country  partnership  strategy,  which  prioritizes  inclusive  and \nsustainable economic growth, including providing drinking water in the post-conflict area.14 \n \n8. \nThe project\u2019s value addition. Through the development and efficient management of a \ndesalination plant, the project will preserve groundwater and enhance drinking water quality, and \nprovide access to piped water supply for 300,000 people. It will benefit 12,000 households below \nthe  poverty  line,  and  empower  women  by  eliminating  drudgery  associated  with  fetching  water \nfrom distant sources. By increasing access to good-quality pressurized water, the project will help \nimprove local economic development and the environment in the post-conflict area. The project \nwill introduce and implement a DBO contract covering (i) the design and construction of a high-\nquality  desalination  plant,  and  (ii)  efficient  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  the  assets \nthrough a performance-based contract of 7 years. The DBO contract will give adequate time for \nthe National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) to build its capacity to operate assets \nbefore the end of the O&M contract period. The project will introduce high technology and climate \nresilience  through  the  desalination  plant,  which  will  employ  complex  reverse  osmosis  and \nadvanced computer control systems. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n9. \nThe impact will be improved health and human development in urban areas of the Jaffna \nPeninsula aligned with the government strategy.15 The outcome will be improved access to safe \ndrinking water in targeted urban areas of the Jaffna Peninsula. The original and aggregate targets \nare in the revised design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n10. \nThe  project  supports  the  restructuring  of  the  current  project.  It  will  (i)  finance  the  cost \noverrun under the current project, and (ii) support the additional components of the desalination \nplant and related works under output 1 and water resource management plan under output 3. The \noverall project has the following three outputs (paras. 11\u201313).  \n \n11. \nOutput 1: Water supply infrastructure and service in the Jaffna Peninsula improved. \nThe overall project will (i) install a desalination plant of 24,000 m3 per day capacity, (ii) install 700 \nkilometers  of  water  mains  and  distribution  pipes,  (iii)  install  60,000  metered  new  water \nconnections, and (iv) operate and maintain the desalination plant for 5 years. The desalination \nplant  will  be  designed,  constructed,  operated,  and  maintained  by  a  single  contractor  using  a \nperformance-based DBO contract. The O&M period under the DBO contract will be 7 years, of \nwhich 5 years will be covered by the project and the remaining 2 years will be financed by the \ngovernment.  The  overall  project  will  support  the  monitoring  and  independent  review  of  the \ndesalination plant services and the DBO contractor performance. The DBO contractor will ensure \n(i)  proper  bulk  water  metering,  (ii)  adequate  water  pressure  at  the  turning  point,  and  (iii) \ncompliance of supplied water with national quality standards for drinking water. The NWSDB will \nmanage  the  water  transfer  and  distribution  systems  and  ensure  timely  payments  of  fixed  and \n\n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2010.

The  DBO  contractor  will  train  the \nNWSDB staff in operating the assets during the O&M period and will turn over the desalination \nplant to the NWSDB at the end of 7 years. The NWSDB has committed to the continuity of O&M \nof the desalination plant beyond the contract period. \n \n12. \nOutput  2:  Headworks  at  Iranamadu  Tank  improved.  The  overall  project  will  support \nenhancement and strengthening of headworks at Iranamadu Tank to increase its water storage \ncapacity from 131.4 million m3 to 148.0 million m3. Iranamadu Tank remains an important drinking \nwater resource for Jaffna, especially when the demand for drinking water is expected to increase \nsignificantly in the future. This output is expected to be completed by the end of 2017 under the \ncurrent  project  by  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government  and  Provincial  Council  as  the  executing \nagency; it will not be covered by the additional financing.  \n \n13. \nOutput  3:  Water  resource  management  systems  and  capacity  strengthened.  The \noverall  project  will  support  long-term  water resource  management  and  capacity  building  of the \nNWSDB. This output will include (i) developing a detailed action plan for groundwater and surface \nwater  monitoring  and  rehabilitation  in  Jaffna;  (ii)  conducting  awareness  campaigns  on  water \nconservation  and  water  sharing  from  Iranamadu  Tank;  (iii)  completing  a  water  resources \nmanagement  plan  for  Iranamadu  Tank;  and  (iv)  undertaking  community  development  in \nVadamarachchi village, where the desalination plant will be located. Capacity development will \nalso be carried out under the attached transaction TA as described in para. 18. \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nThe  overall  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $266  million,  with  additional  financing  of  $120 \n14. \nmillion from ADB (Table 1).

All \nprocurement  of  goods  and  civil  works  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as \namended  from  time  to  time),  and  consulting  services  will  be  engaged  following  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  O&M  period  of  the  desalination  plant \nfinanced by ADB (5 out of 7 years) is expected to be completed by 31 December 2025, while all \nother project outputs are expected to be completed by 31 December 2022. The implementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM (footnote 16). \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements  \n\nArrangements \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nEstimated loan closing date   30 June 2026 (OCR regular loan) \n\nJanuary 2018\u2013December 2025 \n31 December 2025  \n\n30 June 2023 (OCR concessional loan) \n\n                                                 \n17  The maturity-based premium of 0.2% is based on the loan terms and the government\u2019s choice of repayment option \n\nand dates. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nAspects \nManagement \n(i) Oversight body \n\n(ii) Executing agency \n(iii) Implementing agency \nProcurement \n\nConsulting services  \n\nRetroactive financing \nand/or advance contracting \n\nDisbursement \n\nArrangements \n\nA national steering committee, chaired by the Secretary of MCPWS and the \nfollowing as members: Senior members of NWSDB, Ministry of Finance, Ministry \nof National Policies and Economic Affairs, and National Planning Department \nMCPWS  \nNWSDB \nInternational competitive bidding \nNational competitive bidding \nDesalination component consultancy \n(QCBS, 90:10) \nEnvironment survey consultancy (CQS) \nIndividual consultant selection \nAdvance contracting will be used for procurement of works and recruitment of \nconsultants.

The  transaction  TA  is  estimated  to  cost \n$600,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nSpecial Fund (TASF 6). The government will provide counterpart staff, office space, workshop \nvenues, and other in-kind contributions. The Ministry of City Planning and Water Supply will be \nthe executing agency for the TA, which will be implemented over 3 years. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n19. \nInitial  technical  due  diligence  included  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  desalination \ncomponent\u2019s pre-feasibility and environmental studies, surveys and site investigations. Based on \nthat, among several alternatives, the desalination plant\u2019s location in Thalayadi is based on the \nfollowing factors: (i) ideal seabed and seawater conditions; (ii) lower and consistent salinity level \nin the ocean for seawater intake; (iii) limited human activities; (iv) limited adverse environmental, \necological, and social impacts; and (v) the clean water transfer mains are aligned with the future \nwater supply route. The seawater intake will be piped to the sea due to the large plant capacity \nand  to  protect  the  groundwater  aquifer.  The  reverse  osmosis  process  was  considered  after  a \nmarket survey revealed availability of the robust technology at a competitive price, which helps \nreduce  the  life  cycle  costs,  achieve  O&M  cost  savings,  and  maximize  benefits.  The  bidding \ndocuments of the performance-based DBO contract were carefully developed to attract qualified \n\n                                                 \n18 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\finternational  bidders. 19  During  project  implementation,  the  NWSDB  will  recruit  project \nmanagement  consultants  to  monitor  the  construction  and  services  undertaken  by  the  DBO \ncontractor. The NWSDB will recruit an independent performance monitoring and review entity to \nreview  the  contractor\u2019s  performance  and  its  employer  obligations  over  the  O&M  period.  With \ngovernment support, the NWSDB will recover O&M costs through tariffs to ensure sustainable \nservice delivery and optimal maintenance of the assets. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial  \n\nEconomic  analysis.  Economic  analysis  was  conducted  for  the  overall  project.20 The \n20. \neconomic  rationale  for  the  government\u2019s  intervention  is  sound,  as  the  overall  project  aims  to \nprovide stronger and more sustainable basic urban services in the Jaffna Peninsula, one of the \nareas worst affected by the civil war. The economic internal rate of return is estimated at 12.0%, \nindicating  sufficient  economic  return  compared  to  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of \n9.0%. The results of the sensitivity analysis are satisfactory, except in cases where benefits are \ndecreased by 20% and all downside risks are combined, i.e., (i) a capital cost overrun of 20%, (ii) \nan overrun in O&M costs of 20%, and (iii) a 1-year delay in the start of operation. \n \n21. \nFinancial analysis. Financial analysis was undertaken to assess the financial viability of \nthe  overall  project.21 The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  estimated  at  2.9%,  higher  than  the \nweighted average cost of capital of 2.7%. The results of the sensitivity analysis indicate that the \noverall project is sensitive to changes in parameters such as increase in capital costs, reduction \nin revenue, and a 1-year delay in implementation. The National Drinking Water Policy, 2002 states \nthat the water tariff should be adjusted regularly to cover the capital and O&M costs. 22 Financial \nanalysis  indicated  that  the  NWSDB  would  have  sufficient  income  to  cover  its  costs  through \nimplementation of this policy. However, water tariff adjustment is a sensitive issue and may not \nalways be implemented in time, which could lead to a revenue deficit for the NWSDB. In such an \neventuality,  the government  would  take  actions to  ensure  that the  NWSDB  remains financially \nsustainable  through  a  combination  of  partial  tariff  adjustments  and  budget  support.23 ADB  will \nprovide  continued  policy  advice  and  capacity  development  support  to  facilitate  the  NSWDB\u2019s \nfinancial sustainability. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n22. \nGovernance  and  financial  management.  The  NWSDB  was  established  in  1975  as  a \nstatutory entity and has been functioning under the supervision of the Ministry of City Planning \nand Water Supply. NWSDB\u2019s mandate is to develop, operate, and control an efficient, coordinated \nwater supply system and to distribute water for public, domestic, and industrial purposes. During \nthe project implementation, Jaffna Municipal Council and the Ministry of Local Government and \nProvincial Council will be consulted. An assessment concluded the financial management risk is \nmoderate with deficiencies in the fragmented accounting system and a need to strengthen the \n\n                                                 \n19 Desalination Plant and DBO Package (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Government of Sri Lanka, NWSDB. 2002. National Drinking Water Policy. \n\nhttp://waterboard.lk/web/images/contents/organization/policies/national_drinking_water_policy.pdf. \n\n23 The NWSDB implements a progressive water tariff policy, which means uniform tariffs on a nationwide basis. This \nwill allow the project capital and O&M costs to be spread across all customers. To ensure the NWSDB\u2019s financial \nsustainability, the government has taken the following steps: (i) waived the NWSDB\u2019s loans from the government in \n2014; (ii) re-lent the additional financing loan to the NWSDB, with the loan portion being 15% and a grant covering \nthe remaining amount: (iii) will issue approval allowing the NWSDB to increase water tariff by 35% in 2017; and (iv) \nwill establish an independent regulator who will decide water tariffs. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fnumber of auditing staff in the NWSDB. 24  NWSDB is familiarizing itself with ADB\u2019s disbursement \nprocedures and gaining knowledge through prior and ongoing experience in implementing ADB \nprojects.  The  risk  mitigation  measures  include  (i)  strengthening  the  NWSDB\u2019s  internal  audit \ndivision  to  conduct  timely  audits  by  recruiting  qualified  staff  to  fill  the  existing  vacancies;  (ii) \ncontinuing  policy  dialogue  with  the  government  for  approval  of  regular  tariff  adjustment  and \nestablishment of an independent regulator for water tariffs; (iii) extending training and capacity \nbuilding  support  for  the  accounting  staff  of  the  NWSDB;  and  (iv)  updating  and  improving  the \naccounting  system.  The  project  will  support  the  strengthening  of  the  financial  management \ncapacity of the NWSDB. \n \n23. \nProcurement.  The  PMCIU  has  experience  in  procurement  in  accordance  with  ADB \nrequirements and has a satisfactory track record. Transparency in procurement will be ensured \nwith  help  of  a  website  to  disclose  project  information  and  thereby  reduce  corruption  risk  and \nimprove governance. ADB will continue to provide consultants for technical inputs to assist the \nNWSDB.  The  government  established  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  to  address  any \nprocurement issues. \n \n24. \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 16). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n25. \nThe project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. While Sri Lanka has a good \ntrack record in gender equality, many women suffer from poor water supply, sanitation, and other \nurban services, particularly in post-conflict areas. Limited access to safe drinking water requires \nfamily  members,  primarily  women  and  girls,  to  spend  considerable  time  and  effort  for  fetching \nwater.  The  current  project  has  made  satisfactory  progress  on  several  indicators  of  the  gender \naction plan.25 The additional financing will support the current project in providing safe drinking \nwater  to  300,000  people  (about  50%  of  whom  are  women).  The  gender  action  plan  has  been \nupdated to ensure that the inclusive and participatory approach will be followed to address the \nneeds of women and socially marginalized groups.26 The additional financing will cover costs for \nimplementation and monitoring of the strengthened gender action plan. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nSocial safeguards. The project is classified as category B for involuntary resettlement. It \n26. \ndoes not involve any land acquisition, physical or economic displacement, and/or loss of assets \nfor private individuals. All works will be undertaken on public lands or existing rights-of-way.27 The \nproject will not have any significant impacts on the fishing activities in this area. The PMCIU will \nundertake continuous monitoring and in case of any unanticipated livelihood impacts (particularly \non  local fishers  during  the  laying  of the  intake  and  outfall  pipes  in  the  sea for  the  desalination \nplant),  the  resettlement  plan  will  provide  remedial  actions  to  be  undertaken. 28  The  project-\n\n                                                 \n24 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 These relate to women\u2019s involvement during the consultation on the water supply design, construction, and O&M; \ngender sensitization for project staff and stakeholders; an inclusive water management committee at the district level; \nand collection of sex-disaggregated data. \n\n26 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 The NWSDB signed a memorandum of understanding with the Thalayadi Fishermen\u2019s Cooperative Society and the \n\nThalayadi Rural Development Society agreeing on the project location. \n\n28 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fimpacted area in the sea (where intake and outfall pipes will be laid) is only used by fishers as a \ntransit passage with no fishing operations. The environmental management plan (EMP) contains \nprovisions to ensure the contractor provides requisite clear passage for fishing boats during the \npipe laying in the sea. The PMCIU conducted 31 public consultations with stakeholders, including \nfishing communities in the project area. More consultations are planned as per the community \naction  and  participation  plan,29 which  will  be  overseen  by  the  PMCIU\u2019s  sociologist.  Resources \nhave been allocated from the current project to improve infrastructure and living conditions of the \nlocal fishers, including livelihood development, water supply, and toilets for the poor, as well as \nthe  construction  of  local  roads.  The  PMCIU  has  dedicated  staff  for  monitoring  social  and \nresettlement issues, and will submit social safeguards monitoring reports to ADB for review and \ndisclosure on a semiannual basis.  \n \nEnvironmental  safeguards.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  A  for  environment \n27. \nbecause it involves construction and operation of a large desalination plant at a coastal site. A full \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) including an EMP was prepared and disclosed on ADB\u2019s \nwebsite on 17 July 2017.30 Mitigation measures are proposed in the EMP to minimize habitat and \nspecies disturbance during construction and operation of the desalination plant and associated \nfacilities. Implementation of a biodiversity management plan in the EMP will ensure no net loss of \nbiodiversity. Public consultations were conducted with local communities, government authorities, \nand  nongovernment  organizations,  and  their  feedback  was  considered  in  the  project  design. \nEnvironmental  clearance  from  the  Central  Environment  Authority  (CEA)  was  obtained  and \nprovisions in the clearance were incorporated in the EMP and environmental monitoring program. \nPublic concerns were identified in the EIA, and mitigation measures were incorporated into the \nEMP.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  was  established,  and  the  project  will  ensure  that  the \nmembers  of  the  grievance  redress  committee,  the  PMCIU,  and  contractors  are  provided  with \ntrainings  to  address  project-related  grievances.  The  PMCIU  has  dedicated  staff for  monitoring \nenvironmental issues and implementing the EMP. The PMCIU will retain independent advisory \nexperts to monitor the implementation of the project\u2019s EMP in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009) (SPS) and the CEA policy. \n \n28. \nThe  NWSDB  has  implemented  several  ADB  projects  and  has  adequate  institutional \ncapacity and experience to manage safeguard risks. The EMP will be incorporated into civil works \ncontracts,  giving  contractors  the  primary  responsibility  for  implementation.  The  NWSDB  will \nprovide  environmental  monitoring  reports  to  ADB  quarterly  during  construction  works  and \nsemiannually during operation. A corrective action plan will be prepared and implemented for any \nnoncompliance  issues.  The  contractors  and  NWSDB  will  adhere  to  the  SPS  and  national \nenvironmental regulations. In the event of any unanticipated environmental impacts during project \nimplementation, the NWSDB will address them by updating the EIA and revising the EMP, which \nwill be disclosed on the ADB website. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n29.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.31 Intended  benefits  are  expected  to  outweigh \ncosts. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n29 The community action and participation plan is included in the PAM (footnote 16). \n30 Environmental Impact Assessment Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nLack of sustained support from fishing \ncommunities for the desalination plant \nwill cause implementation delays and \ncost overruns \nInadequate cost recovery and financial \nsustainability because of low water \ntariff \nInadequate management of \nenvironmental issues will lead to \nincompletion of the desalination plant \n\nDesalination plant is not operated \nproperly during the post-construction \nperiod \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nPublic consultations have been held.
