I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed follow-\non equity investment of up to $3.0 million equivalent in Credit Orienwise Group Limited (COG), an \noffshore principal holding company with subsidiaries operating as credit guarantee companies \n(CGCs) in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and specializing in guaranteeing loans for small \nand medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and individuals. \n \n2.  In April 2005, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) invested $10.0 million in COG.1 The \ncapital infusion was used to finance the expansion of the company\u2019s guarantee business through \nthe increase in paid-in registered capital of COG\u2019s PRC subsidiaries.   \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Access to Credit for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises \n \n3.  SMEs2 play a significant role in the PRC economy and are key drivers of employment, \neconomic growth, and development. They account for almost half of the gross domestic product \n(GDP), two-thirds of industrial value added, 60% of exports, and 40% of fiscal revenues.3 SMEs \nalso provide 75% of urban and rural employment. Private SMEs have grown more quickly than \nthe larger state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The industrial output of SMEs has been increasing at \nan average annual rate of 30%, compared to 20% for the industry as a whole.4 Consequently, the \ndevelopment of SMEs is an important engine of growth and a key contributor to poverty reduction \nby creating employment, increasing individual incomes, and generating tax revenues in the PRC. \n \n4.  SMEs rely heavily on access to external capital to finance their operations. However, \nmore than 80% of the PRC\u2019s SMEs have difficulty accessing financial services and securing \nfinancing.5 Although bank loans in the PRC account for 70% of total external financing, as the \ncorporate bond market is underdeveloped, only 30% of PRC SMEs have access to bank lending \n(mostly for working capital). Lack of access to bank lending is considered the main financing \ndifficulty and a stumbling block for sustaining SME growth. \n \n5.  The  limitation  of  banking  services  available  to  SMEs  is  mainly  due  to  the  following \nreasons:  \n \n(i)  State-owned  commercial  banks  (SOCBs)  are  not  geared  to  service  SMEs, \nparticularly private ones. PRC banks have a strong state-sector bias, and the \nperception prevails that SMEs are not creditworthy borrowers. This is especially \ntrue of the four big SOCBs that dominate bank finance in the PRC with 60% of \ntotal PRC bank lending, which have the reputation of being unwilling to lend to \nSMEs, as their traditional customers are large SOEs and shareholding companies.  \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2004.

Manila. \n ", "2   \n \n(ii)  Other  banking  institutions  have  limited  coverage  and  financial  products  and \ndepend heavily on collateral. The high frequency and short-term nature of SME \nloans, unfamiliar markets, ownership structures that are often complicated, and \nlack of sufficient and reliable operational and financial data for loan appraisal have \nresulted  in  high  business  development  and  administration  costs  for  banks.6 \nBecause of the long process of recognition, registration, and evaluation for the \nSME  borrower\u2019s  collateral,  banks  have  difficulty  meeting  SMEs\u2019  frequent  and \nseasonal demand for debt.  \n \n(iii)  To reduce nonperforming loans, many commercial banks have adopted a policy of \npermanently assigning the responsibility of loan performance to the loan officers. \nThis has resulted in acute risk aversion at the sub branch and loan officer level, \ncurtailing loans to SMEs. \n \n(iv)  The PRC does not have a diversified financial sector capable of serving SMEs, as \nfinancial institutions specialized to provide loans for SMEs are lacking.  \n \n(v)  Credit allocation is distorted by a continued policy of lending through government-\nowned banks and restrictions on competition from foreign financial institutions. \n \n(vi)  Guarantees offered by the SMEs are often insufficient to support their borrowings. \nReal estate and equipment are the major forms of collateral taken by the banks. \nHowever,  most  SMEs,  especially  privately  owned  ones,  cannot  provide  such \ncollateral. In addition, the value of collateral available for loans is reduced following \nthe discount at which banks value it. Based on a survey conducted by the People\u2019s \nBank  of  China  (PBOC),  the  discount  rates  are  50\u201370%  for  real  estate  and \nequipment.  \n \n(vii)  Most importantly, while PBOC allows bank lending rates for SMEs to deviate within \na band from the lending base rate,7 the maximum rate remains insufficient to \ncompensate  banks  for  the  higher  risk  that  SME  borrowers  represent  unless \nguaranteed by a third party of better credit standing.8 \n \nB.  Role and Development of Credit Guarantee Companies \n6.  To ease constraints arising from the guarantee requirement for SME borrowing, business \norganizations,  local  governments,  and  individuals  have  been  encouraged  by  the  PRC \nGovernment to establish CGCs and so facilitate bank lending to SMEs. State-owned CGCs were \nfirst introduced in the early to mid-1990s, while private sector CGCs started receiving licenses by \n1999. By end of 2006, the number of CGCs in the PRC is expected to exceed 3,000.  \n                                                 \n6  According to the State Information Center, over half of all SMEs lack proper financial management, and over 60% \nhave a credit rating of BBB or worse. Over 80% of bank loans go to AAA or AA-rated enterprises. Over half of the \nSMEs have only a single product line, and 70% do not have a stable customer base. SMEs borrow five times more \nfrequently than large enterprises. However, the average size of an SME loan is only about 5% of that of a large \nenterprise, and the administration cost is about five times higher. \n7  Currently 1.7 times the base rate of 5.3%. \n8  ADB. 2003. Private Sector Assessment in the People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila; International Finance Corporation. \n2000. The PRC Emerging Private Sector. Washington, DC.; ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China for the Development of SME Credit Guarantee Companies. Manila. \n  ", "  3\n \n7.  An estimated 60% of all bank loans in the PRC are supported by a guarantee of some \nkind. However, of these guarantees, approximately 90% are intra-group and parent company \nguarantees wherein an affiliated company guarantees the liabilities of other group companies, 5% \nare government guarantees, and only about 5% are provided by specialized CGCs, of which \nprivate sector CGCs account for only about 1% of guarantees outstanding.9\n \n8.  Of the approximately 8 million SMEs nationwide, CGCs currently serve only 48,000, or \n0.6%.  This  mismatch  of  market  demand  and  supply  is  a  result  of  several  factors:  (i)  most \ngovernment-funded CGCs lack an optimal corporate structure or commercially oriented decision-\nmaking functions; (ii) the capital base of most CGCs is too small to meet the growing demand for \ncredit to SMEs; (iii) with limited capacity to assess the risks associated with expanded guarantee \nproducts, many CGCs do not maximize the utilization of their capital bases, and those that are \nsmaller  or  lack  track  records  have  limited  credibility  with  banks  and  so  need  to  pledge  as \ncollateral their own cash deposited with the lending bank for acceptance. As a result, most CGCs, \nespecially those established for policy reasons, are small and inactive.  \n \n9.  PRC CGCs do not have directly comparable counterparts in more developed markets, \nsuch as Europe. In more developed markets, working capital in SMEs, as in larger companies, is \nmainly obtained from the revenues generated by the enterprise (or by supplier credit, which often \nprovides the SME with sufficient time to generate enough revenues to pay all its bills). If revenues \ndo not optimally match the need for working capital, commercial banks provide credit lines to the \nSME. The flexible current account facility is the main banking product that is offered to SMEs. \nThis loan may be guaranteed personally by the entrepreneur, particularly in the case of a recent \ncustomer  relationship  between  the  bank  as  lender  and  the  SME,  but  guarantees  from \nnongovernmental third parties are not commonly used. Banks in developed markets have deep \nand stable relationships with SMEs, a particular business focus on SMEs, and the ability to \nthoroughly evaluate and price SME credit risk. As these elements are still developing in the PRC \nbanking  sector,  CGCs  address  a  particular  weakness  and  are  very  much  justified  as  a \nsustainable business model until the PRC banking sector has made significant progress. \n \n10.  A few CGCs including COG have succeeded in filling this gap by creating thriving niches \nin specialized sectors where commercial banks lack experience or incentives for assessing SME \ncredit risk. These CGCs have garnered credibility with banks and, as a result, enjoy less stringent \nrequirements for cash deposits as security for loans. Such companies are widely seen as leading \nthe development of the sector and assuming a greater role as financial intermediaries in the PRC \n(see Appendix 1 for a sector analysis of the credit guarantee market in the PRC). \n \nC.  Sector Policies and Regulations \n11.  The sector is not formally regulated but under the oversight of the National Development \nand Reform Commission (NDRC), which has issued Guidelines on Developing the SME Credit \nGuaranty System10 to facilitate the establishment of an SME credit guarantee system across the \ncountry. The guidelines also cover (i) prudential capital adequacy ratios (governing the maximum \nvalue of guarantees outstanding compared to registered capital); (ii) the maximum guarantee fee \nchargeable (as a maximum percent of the loan interest rate, which is itself regulated); and (iii) \nsuch  other  issues  as  risk  management  policies  and  limitation  on  geographic  expansion.

The Ministry of Finance is also working on draft accounting methods for \nguarantee institutions to enhance correct information disclosure. \n \n12.  Furthermore, administrative measures13 proposed in early 2004 contain more detailed \nguidelines. The proposed measures include the requirement for a minimum capitalization of \nCNY500 million for national CGCs, CNY200 million for province-wide CGCs, and CNY50 million \nfor municipal CGCs. Moreover, to establish prudential operations, the measures propose that the \nguarantee-to-capital multiplier not exceed 10 times, and the maximum amount of a guarantee for \nany customer not exceed 10% of the CGC's net asset value. The proposed measures also \nstipulate that 50% of guarantee fees be set aside as reserves for outstanding liabilities and that \nannual provisioning be required for 1% of outstanding guarantee liability, up to an aggregate level \nof 10%.14\n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT \n \nA.  The Investee Company  \n \n13.  COG, an off-shore holding company with several subsidiaries in the PRC, is a leading \nprovider of guarantee products and services in the country. The company is primarily engaged in \nproviding financial guarantees, entrusted lending, and related advisory services to SMEs and \nindividual customers. It is one of the few CGCs with operations in multiple high-growth regions in \nthe PRC including the Pearl and Yangtze deltas and Capital Economic Zone. Unlike many state-\nowned CGCs, COG provides guarantees only to private sector SMEs and individuals.   \n \nB.  Previous ADB Investment and Engagement \n14.  In April 2005, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) invested $10 million in COG.15 In \nOctober 2005, Citigroup Venture Capital International (CVCI) and, in March 2006, the Carlyle \nGroup  (Carlyle)  each  invested  $25  million  as  follow-on  investments  directly  sourced  and \ncatalyzed by ADB. The capital infusion was used to finance the expansion of the company\u2019s \nguarantee business through the increase in paid-in registered capital of COG\u2019s PRC subsidiaries.   \n \n15.  ADB has played an active role in the development of COG in the past 18 months through \nits board representation, especially with respect to (i) revamping its credit approval process, (ii) \nenhancing  its  information  technology  systems,  and  (iii)  key  hires  of  senior  management \npersonnel. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n11 Ministry of Finance. 2001.

Corporate Structure and IPO Plans \n16.  COG  undertook  a  series  of  restructuring  transactions  in  2004  and  2005.  The \nreorganization effectively created a holding company domiciled in the Cayman Islands,16 which is \nin line with standard Hong Kong market practice for listings by PRC companies.17  \n \nD.  Business Description   \n17.  Although COG has a market share of only about 2.4% in terms of registered capital, it is \none of the largest private guarantee companies in the PRC. Its key businesses include corporate, \nindividual, and performance guarantees; entrusted lending; and advisory services. The company \ndoes almost all of its corporate business with SMEs.   \n \n18.  The underserved financing needs of SMEs and the PRC's underdeveloped credit culture \nhave together acted as the key drivers behind COG\u2019s quick growth and the high profitability of its \nguarantee and entrusted loan businesses.  \n \nIV.  PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  Proposed Equity Investment \n19.  The proposed ADB investment will be in the equity capital of COG for a stake of up to \n2.0%. The transaction will bring ADB\u2019s total equity stake in COG to 5.98%, from its current \nownership stake of 4.81%. ADB will not acquire a stake in COG larger than 9.9% to avoid \nbecoming a \u201csubstantial shareholder\u201d or \"connected party\u201d18 under Hong Kong Stock Exchange \nlisting rules. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n16 The Cayman Islands\u2019 legal system is based on British law, and therefore the legal concepts are familiar and \nacceptable to international investors. The Cayman Islands comply with the standards set by the Organization for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Financial Action Task Force (FATF). In addition, the Cayman \nIslands have responded to the \"harmful tax practice\" initiative of the OECD by giving an advance commitment to \nOECD, which kept the Cayman Islands off the OECD official list of tax havens published in June 2000. OECD has \nconfirmed that the Cayman Islands system of no direct taxes is not in itself considered harmful.  \n17 Most PRC companies seeking a listing at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange incorporate their listed companies in the \nCayman  Islands.  ADB\u2019s  external  counsel  and  COG\u2019s  external  counsel  have  confirmed  that,  in  the  present \ncircumstances, a direct listing of COG as a PRC entity is not feasible, as listing would require, inter alia, transforming \nCOG from a Sino-foreign joint venture into a \"company limited by shares.\" This involves a highly bureaucratic \nprocess, which is why PRC companies tend to use an offshore jurisdiction accepted by the Hong Kong Stock \nExchange. Among the possible choices (Hong Kong, Cayman Islands, or Bermuda), the Cayman Islands is generally \nregarded as desirable because (i) the legal requirements regarding capital reduction and the distribution of capital \nare less complicated than are those in Hong Kong, (ii) Hong Kong stamp duty is not chargeable for share transfers \nthat take place prior to the IPO, and (iii) the Cayman Islands are FATF compliant and not on OECD\u2019s tax haven \nblacklist.  \n18 ADB plans to introduce best management practices and credit-risk procedures to COG, and PSOD and COG may \nalso cooperate in further business development and will enter into a memorandum of understanding in this regard. \nHowever, if ADB owns more than 9.9% of COG at its initial public offering on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Hong \nKong listing rules will (i) require shareholders\u2019 approval for each transaction between ADB and COG in the future and \n(ii) impose certain liabilities on ADB resulting from having a director on the board of Orienwise and ADB\u2019s mention in \nthe prospectus. To avoid these liabilities, ADB decided to stay below the threshold of a connected party. \n ", "6   \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Justification for the ADB Investment \n1.  Investment Objective  \n20.  ADB\u2019s objective in the proposed investment is to reorganize COG\u2019s shareholdings.   The \nproposed  investment  and  the  acquisition  of  certain  minority  shareholdings  is  essential  to \nreorganizing  COG\u2019s  shareholdings,  in  order  to  bring  the  Company\u2019s  planned  IPO  closer  to \nrealization. The  follow-on  investment  is  a clear  signal of  ADB\u2019s  continuing support  to  COG \nespecially at a time when market perception is critical.  ADB\u2019s vote of confidence in the company \nwill send a positive signal to the investment community regarding COG\u2019s credibility, which could \nattract strategic and business partners needed as the business model expands beyond the \ncurrent  guarantee  products.    A  successful  investment  into,  and  exit  from,  COG  will  also \ndemonstrate to other potential investors the attractiveness of investing in other strong CGCs, thus \npromoting private sector investment transactions in the CGC market.   \n \n2.  Development Outcome \n21.  Given the current constraints in the PRC's financial market (i.e., a weak credit culture at \nstate-owned banks, limited business scope, and rigid interest rates), CGCs that assess credit \nsoundly, such as COG, are needed to fill the gap between viable and growing SMEs and their \naccess to financing. Commercially viable SMEs that benefit from additional guarantees made \npossible by the increased capital base of COG will be supported in their expected growth and \nsustainable operations. As a result, employment at such SMEs can be sustained or increased, \nthus promoting job creation, economic growth, higher tax payments to the government, and \npoverty reduction \n \n22.  SME Financing.  SMEs play a significant role in all of ADB\u2019s DMC economies and are \nkey drivers of employment, economic growth, and development. They often have a significant \nimpact on the gross domestic product (GDP) and in most cases grow faster than state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs). The development of SMEs is therefore an important engine of growth and a \nkey contributor to poverty reduction by creating employment, increasing individual incomes, and \ngenerating tax revenues. \n \n23.  SMEs rely heavily on access to external capital to finance their operations. However, in \nmost of ADB\u2019s DMCs, SMEs have difficulty accessing financial services and securing financing. \nAlthough bank loans are dominating any external financing (due to the underdeveloped corporate \nbond markets), only a small number of SMEs in the region have access to bank lending (mostly \nonly for working capital). Lack of access to bank lending is considered in most DMCs as the main \nfinancing difficulty and a stumbling block for sustaining growth of SMEs. \n \n24.  The  limitation  of  banking  services  available  to  SMEs  is  mainly  due  to  the  following \nreasons: (i) State-owned banks (like in the PRC) are not geared to service SMEs, particularly \nprivate ones; (ii) Other banking institutions have limited coverage and financial products. The high \nfrequency and short-term nature of SME loans, unfamiliar markets, ownership structures that are \noften complicated, and lack of sufficient and reliable operational and financial data for loan \nappraisal  have  resulted  in  high  business  development  and  administration  costs  for  banks. \nBecause of the long process of recognition, registration, and evaluation for the SME borrower\u2019s \ncollateral, banks have difficulties meeting the SMEs\u2019 frequent and seasonal demand for debt; (iii) \nTo reduce nonperforming loans, many commercial banks have adopted a policy of permanently \n  ", "  7\nassigning the responsibility of loan performance to the loan officers. This has resulted in acute \nrisk aversion at the subbranch and loan officer level, thus curtailing the amount of loans to SMEs; \n(iv) In most of the DMCs a diversified financial sector capable of serving SMEs is lacking, i.e. \nfocused financial institutions that are specialized to provide loans for SMEs are missing or only \nmarginal market participants; (v) Credit allocation is in many markets distorted by continued \npolicy lending through government-owned banks, and restrictions on competition from foreign \nfinancial institutions; (vii) Finally, in many instances regulated (domestic) bank lending rates do \nnot allow domestic banks to price risks for appropriately and therefore shy away form this asset \nwhich is often perceived is highly risky. This is however in most cases contrary to reality, if \nappropriate protection is sought and thorough due diligence is undertaken.  Appendices 14 and \n15  discuss  the  development  impact  of  SME  finance  and  the  SME  financing  gap  in  Asia, \nrespectively.  \n \n25.  Financial Sector Development. The credit-assessment skills found in COG will help to \ndevelop  the  PRC's  credit  culture,  whether  COG  sustains  its  operations  as  an  SME  credit \nguarantor or its credit competency is eventually acquired and absorbed into a bank's credit \ndepartment or extended into other, similar lines of business.  A strong credit culture is crucial to \nstrengthening the PRC\u2019s financial sector. \n \n26.  Private Sector Development.  The support for the growth of a leading private provider of \nguarantee services will contribute to the shift away from government dominance of the sector \ntoward  a  more  market-oriented,  private  sector-led  industry,  which  will  promote  sound  risk-\nmanagement practices and the efficient allocation of resources. \n \n2.  Value Added by Asian Development Bank  \n27.  ADB\u2019s  proposed  investment  will  add  value  by  (i)  demonstrating  the  possibility  of \nreplicating  such  a  model  for  financial  intermediaries  serving  SMEs  in  the  PRC  and  other \ndeveloping member countries; (ii) catalyzing additional investments from outside sources (HYB \nand IPO investors) into COG as confidence rises as a result of ADB\u2019s investment and continuing \ncommitment; and (iii) promoting best commercial practices and good corporate governance,  \nADB\u2019s  direct  involvement  with  COG  and  the  firsthand  experience  thus  gathered  has  led  to \nenhanced policy support to the Government. \n \nB.  Environmental Aspects and Social Policies \n28.  COG has been classified as FI under ADB\u2019s environmental policy, and has (i) adopted an \nappropriate environmental management system comprising a policy and procedures; and (ii) is \ncurrently undergoing training in environmental impact assessment and auditing.  \n \n29.  The  investment  is  classified  as  category  C  with  respect  to  indigenous  people  and \ninvoluntary resettlement safeguards. COG is not expected to cause any involuntary resettlement \nor affect indigenous people, as the guarantees are extended to SMEs mainly in urban areas.   \n \nC.  Development Impact Measurement \n30.  ADB  will  measure  the  expected  development  impact  of  the  investment.

The Credit Guarantee Market in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n1.  As one of the fastest growing major economies in the world, the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) presents significant potential for the credit guarantee industry. According to the \nNational Bureau of Statistics, the PRC\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) reached CNY18.2 trillion \nin 2005 and CNY9.1 trillion in the first half year of 2006. Total outstanding bank loans reached \nCNY22.8 trillion at the end of June 2006. However, in most cases, fast-growing SMEs have \ndifficulty borrowing from banks because of their relatively weak credit history. Individuals also \nfind it difficult to secure loans for business or personal consumption.   \n \n2.  To address the needs of these potential borrowers, credit guarantee companies (CGCs) \nhave emerged, and the number of CGCs has been significantly increasing in recent years. In \naddition, as economic activities in the PRC continue to expand in scale and volume, demand for \nperformance guarantees as a hedge against counterparty risk is expected to grow. \n \nB.  Rapid Growth of the Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Sector Creates Demand \nfor the Corporate Guarantee Business \n3.  Since the PRC\u2019s economic reform and development began in 1978, the small and \nmedium-sized enterprise (SME) sector has grown substantially. According to statistics of the \nNational Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), from 2001 to 2004, the number of \nregistered SMEs increased from 16,968 to 27,326, representing a compound annual growth rate \n(CAGR) of 17%, the revenues of these SMEs grew from CNY6,325 billion to CNY12,769 billion, \nrepresenting a CAGR of 26%, and the net income increased from CNY264 billion to CNY643 \nbillion, representing a CAGR of 35%. SMEs play a significant role in the PRC\u2019s economy and \nare key drivers of employment and economic growth. As of end 2005, SMEs were contributing \n75.0% of employment opportunities, 74.7% of industrial output, 62.3% of exports, 58.9% of \nsales, 55.6% of GDP, and 46.2% of fiscal revenues in the PRC. \n \n4.  Table A1.1 sets forth the general criteria of SMEs in the PRC. \n \nTable A1.1: General Criteria of SMEs in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(CNY Millions) \n \nIndustry  Number of  Total Assets  Sales \nEmployees \nIndustry  <2,000  <4,000  <300 \nConstruction  <3,000  <4,000  <300 \nWholesale and retail  <500  \u2014  <150 \nTransportation and delivery  <3,000  \u2014  <300 \nHospitality/food and beverage  <800  \u2014  <150 \n\u2014 = not available, SMEs = small and medium-sized enterprises. \nSource: Interim Provisions on the Standards of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises, issued by the \nState Economic and Trade Commission, the Ministry of Finance and the National Bureau of Statistics of \nChina on 19 February 2003. \n \n5.  SMEs rely heavily on access to external capital to finance their operations. Despite their \nsignificance to the PRC\u2019s economy, more than 80% of SMEs have difficulty securing financing, \nand only 10% of all SME loan demand is met by banks. According to NDRC, the rejection rate \n ", "10   Appendix 1 \nof SMEs\u2019 loan applications by banks is over 56%, of which 23.8% are for lack of guarantees, \nand another 32.3% are for lack of fixed assets that can serve as collateral. One third of the \nfunds for SMEs came from unofficial lending networks with financing costs ranging as high as \n25% to 30%. \n \n6.  SME\u2019s limited access to bank financing can be attributed to their (i) small size and \nprivate ownership, (ii) lack of track records or audited financials, (iii) variable credit profiles, (iv) \nfailure to provide fixed assets as collateral, and (v) lack of guarantors. Traditional financial \ninstitutions such as banks are reluctant to lend to SMEs as the former lack in-house risk-\nassessment capabilities and have insufficient industry knowledge, high risk aversion due to low \ntolerance for nonperforming loans, and internal requirements to obtain fixed assets as collateral. \n \n7.  Commercial CGCs emerged to bridge the gap between state-owned commercial banks\u2019 \nlending  requirements  and  SME  borrowers\u2019  qualifications  by  providing  credit  guarantees. \nCompared with banks, CGCs have flexibility to accept various types of collateral in addition to \nfixed assets, such as unlisted securities, and to offer more flexible repayment options. \n \nC.  Demand for Individual Guarantees \n8.  The real estate market and the fast-growing consumer sector\u2014including household \nappliances and consumer electronics, automobiles, and home decorations\u2014have been driving \nthe individual guarantee business. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, at the end of \n2005, the outstanding balance of residential mortgages in the PRC was $228 billion, having \nshown a CAGR from 2001 to 2005 of 35.3%. Consumer retail sales grew from $520 billion in \n2001 to $832 billion in 2005, representing a CAGR of 11.8%. \n \n9.  The structure of transactions in the secondary residential property market in the PRC \ncreates business opportunities for CGCs. Demand arises because the PRC\u2019s mortgage lending \nrules require that a seller must discharge an existing mortgage before the seller\u2019s bank can \nrelease the home ownership certificate, without which a buyer\u2019s bank will not fund the buyer\u2019s \nmortgage loan. As a result, simultaneous closings at which a seller\u2019s repayment of his mortgage \nis funded by proceeds of a buyer\u2019s mortgage loan are not possible. By providing a guarantee to \nthe buyer or the seller\u2019s bank so that the seller will have sufficient funds to discharge the \nexisting mortgage, the CGCs facilitate these secondary residential property transactions. \n \nD.  Demand for Performance Guarantees \n10.  The PRC\u2019s building, infrastructure construction, and domestic trade sectors have been \ndriving  the  growth  of  the  performance  guarantee  business.  The  total  value  of  the  PRC\u2019s \nconstruction market increased from $186 billion in 2001 to $335 billion in 2004, representing a \nCAGR of 21.8%. Fixed asset investments increased from $449 billion in 2001 to $1,098 billion in \n2005, representing a CAGR of 24.2%. Domestic trade commodities sales increased from $875 \nbillion in 2001 to $1,378 billion in 2005, representing a CAGR of 16.4%. \n \n11.  During the past 2 years, the Ministry of Commerce has actively promoted the guarantee \nsystem for construction projects to promote the development of the PRC\u2019s construction industry. \nIn October 2005, the six cities of Changzhou, Chengdu, Hangzhou, Qingdao, Shenzhen, and \nXiamen  were  chosen  by  the  ministry  as  pilot  cities  for  the  implementation  of construction \nguarantees.  The  construction-related  guarantees,  including  contract  tendering  and  bidding \nguarantees,  payment  guarantees,  construction  performance  guarantees,  and  construction \n  ", "Appendix 1  11\nquality guarantees, meet the objectives of the government and the needs of the construction \nindustry. \n \n12.  Unlike transactions in international trade, for which PRC banks can issue letters of credit \nto ensure payment by the counterparty, no such service is available to parties engaged in the \ndomestic  trade.  The  emergence  of  trade-related  payment  guarantees  fills  such  needs  for \ndomestic companies, facilitating the growth of domestic trade. \n \nE.  CGCs in the PRC \n13.  At the end of 2004, there were 2,188 CGCs registered with the NDRC. Figure A1 shows \nthe rapid growth in the number of registered CGCs in the PRC in the past 5 years. \n \nFigure A1: Registered CGCs in PRC\n2,500\n2,188\n1,932\n2,000\n1,500\n1,000 848\n582\n500 \n203 \n0 \n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004\n \nCGC = credit guarantee company, PRC = the People\u2019s Republic of China. \nSource: National Development and Reform Commission, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise  \nDepartment. \n \n14.

Types of CGCs \n15.  CGCs in the PRC can be classified into three main categories, namely government \nfinanced, industry and trade organization financed, and commercial.

Government-financed CGCs. As of 2004, there were 196 government-financed CGCs, \naccounting for 9% of the total. Government-financed CGCs are generally independent legal \nentities and not profit-oriented. These CGCs often focus their business on a certain industry to \npromote certain government policy directives. As a result, they are limited in their ability to \nsupport a wide range of SMEs in other industries. \n \n17.  Industry and Trade Organization-financed CGCs. As of 2004, there were 113 industry \nand  trade  organization-financed  CGCs,  accounting  for  5%  of  the  total.  These  CGCs  are \nestablished by local and regional associations of SMEs operating in a particular industry to \nprovide  guarantees  for  members  and  so  help  them  obtain  financing.  They  are  small  and \nfinanced by member companies or local industrial or business associations. Since these CGCs \nare usually self-financed and take on their own risks, they pool the risk through re-guarantees. \n \n18.  Commercial  CGCs.  As  of  2004,  there  were  1,879  commercial  CGCs  in  the  PRC, \naccounting  for  86%  of  the  total.  These  are  generally  established  as  corporate  entities  by \nenterprises and individuals. They are generally independent legal entities operated for profit. \nThey respond promptly to market needs, customize their product offerings to a wide range of \n  ", "Appendix 1  13\nindustries, and price the risk commercially. They also depend on sophisticated risk assessment \nskills, as risk control is an essential element to their business operations. \n \n19.  At end 2004, the total registered capital of CGCs was CNY65.72 billion, of which the \ngovernment\u2019s  contribution  was  CNY19.28  billion  (29.3%)  and  the  private  contribution  was \nCNY46.44 billion (71.7%). The funding background of the CGCs is set forth in Table A1.3. \n \nTable A1.3: Funding Background of the CGCs \nCGCs  Number \nWholly financed by government       460 \nPartly financed by government      477 \nPrivately financed   1,251 \n  Total  2,188 \nCGC = credit guarantee company. \nSource: National Development and Reform Commission, Small and Medium-\nSized Enterprise Department. \n \nG.  Competition \n20.  The  CGCs  in  the  PRC  compete  with  each  other  in  many  ways.  One  of  the  most \nimportant is registered capital. The relevant PRC regulations limit the aggregate exposure of \nguarantees provided by a CGC for a single customer to a certain percentage of its paid-in \ncapital. Banks\u2019 internal guidelines provide for limitations on the amount of exposure to any \nsingle CGC, which is usually based on a certain percentage of the CGC\u2019s registered capital. \nDraft  regulations  by  local  and  national  governmental  authorities  impose  various  capital \nthresholds for CGCs. The size of a CGC\u2019s capital base will continue to determine the size of its \noperations. \n \n21.  On  12  June  2006,  the  China  Banking  Regulatory  Commission  announced  new \nguidelines encouraging commercial banks to accept guarantees only from those CGCs with \npaid-in registered capital of CNY100 million or more. As registered capital requirements for \nCGCs become stricter with the implementation of regulations that apply both directly to CGCs \nand to banks\u2019 ability to accept guarantees from CGCs, consolidation in the credit guarantee \nindustry is expected to occur, with smaller and weaker CGCs either being acquired by larger, \nbetter capitalized CGCs or exiting the business.  \n \n22.  As of August 2006, the four largest CGCs in the PRC are Credit Orienwise Group \nLimited with registered capital of CNY1.58 billion, China Investment Credit Guarantee Company \nLimited (CNY1 billion), Chang\u2019an Credit Guarantee Company Limited (CNY1 billion), and China \nEconomic and Technology Investment Guarantee Company Limited (CNY646 million).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "14   Appendix 2 \n \n \nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT FRAMEWORK \n1.
