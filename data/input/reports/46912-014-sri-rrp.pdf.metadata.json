The difficult \ninvestment  climate,  cumbersome  procedures,  and,  in  particular,  the  lack  of  access  to  adequate \nand  timely  financing  has  led  to  borrowing  becoming  more  expensive  and  profit  margins  being \nreduced. Bank lending, however, has increased as a result of stabilization of the political situation \nand  continued  strengthening  of  the  economy.    A  gap  in  longer-term  funding  that  would  support \nthe growing needs of borrowers seeking housing loans and funding for small and medium-sized \nenterprises  (SMEs),  for  instance,  remains.  Moreover,  there  is  a  clear  preference  by  banks  to \nserve  large,  top-tier  companies  and  higher-income  customers  that  are  perceived  to  have  lower \nrisks,  which  serves  to  further  limit  access  to  finance.  This  proposal  aims  to  support  the \ndevelopment of the finance sector by addressing the scarcity of housing finance in Sri Lanka by \nproviding  long-term  funding  and  capacity  building  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  a  mid-tier  bank \ntargeting the underserved market. \n \n3. \nSri Lanka suffers from a housing shortage that is currently estimated at between 350,000 \nunits and 1 million units with an additional need of about 100,000 units per annum.2 There is also \na special need for new housing and rehabilitation of homes damaged by the civil war in the North \nand East, and South as a result of the 2004 tsunami. Demand for housing has steadily increased \nfollowing the end of the civil war, which has led to improved consumer sentiment, rising income \nlevels (16% in total since 2009),3 and repatriation of Sri Lankans.  \n\n \n4. \nAgainst this backdrop of growing demand, however, is a scarcity of mortgage financing as \nreflected  in  a  mortgage  debt\u2013gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  ratio  of  6%,  which  is  considerably \nlower than the global average of about 30%. Although the Sri Lankan mortgage market grew at \nan  annual  rate  of  about  30%  from  2004  to  2009,  the  World  Bank  estimates  that  80%  of  the \npopulation does not have access to long-term financing needed to purchase homes (footnote 2). \nNot  only  is  there  a  sheer  lack  of  mortgage  finance  available,  but  also  the  small  amount  of \nmortgage finance that is provided is extended to just a few narrow customer segments, resulting \nin market fragmentation. The World Bank estimates that banks provide mortgages to only 20% of \nthe population and at the higher end of the housing market, while a small segment of the lower \nend  of  the  market  is  being  served  by  microfinance  institutions  and  some  state-owned  banks \n(footnote  2).  Nearly  30%  of  the  market,  primarily  in  the  middle-  and  lower-middle-income \nsegments, are considered to be bankable clients but are not expected to be served in the near to \nmedium term by the current market. The Government of Sri Lanka expects the private sector to \nplay  a  larger  role  in  the  provision  of  housing  finance  and,  with  that,  the  government  intends  to \nshift away from primary mortgage provision. This will create further room for private commercial \nbanks to expand their operations to cater to the largely unmet demand for housing finance.4 \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  T.

Colombo  (June);  and \n\n\f2  \n\n \n\nA well-functioning mortgage system with increased and diverse private commercial bank \n5. \nparticipation  in  terms  of  first-  and  second-tier  banks  is  needed  to  provide  access  to  mortgage \nfinance  to  these  prospective  borrowers  and  close  the  market  gap.  Greater  private  commercial \nbank  participation  is  expected  to  lead  to  a  more  competitive  mortgage  finance  market  with \nimproved  affordability,  efficiencies,  and  product  diversification,  and,  importantly,  more  inclusive \ncustomer  segmentation  strategies.  The  involvement  of  more  private  sector  commercial  banks \nproviding higher volumes of mortgage lending (currently at only about 4% of total banking assets) \nis also important as the government cannot support the large needs of the housing market as it \nmoves toward a more efficient economy.5 \n\n \n6. \nOne of the primary impediments to the overall development of the mortgage market in Sri \nLanka  has  been  the  lack  of  access  to  longer-term  financing for  banks  because  of  the  country\u2019s \nlow level of finance sector development (FSD) (specifically its capital markets), the civil war, and \nthe global financial crisis. Due to the government\u2019s current account deficit and the need to bridge \nthe  external  funding  gap,  the  government  is  encouraging  overseas  borrowings  by  Sri  Lankan \nbanks for both senior and subordinated debt.6 Other issues that have constrained growth include \neviction difficulties, high land registration costs, the absence of an electronic title system, and lack \nof comprehensive market data.7 With respect to the middle- and lower-middle-income segments, \nadditional  issues  include  a  perception  of  heightened  risk  (as  many  of  these  customers  are \nnonsalaried  workers),  an  absence  or  underdevelopment  of  sophisticated  and  specialized  credit \nanalysis  techniques  makes  it  difficult  for  banks  to  better  serve  these  markets,  and  lack  of \naffordability at the lower end of the market. \n \n7. \nGiven the need for long-term funding to increase private commercial bank participation in \nthe market and with the goal of encouraging banks to target underserved customer segments, the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) met with several banks in 2011 to identify a suitable candidate \nwith  the  interest  and  ability  to  move  down  market.  Additionally,  ADB  sought  a  bank  that  could \neffectively address the specific needs for housing in the North, East, and South.  DVB, a medium-\nsized bank and a participant in ADB\u2019s Trade Finance Program,8 was selected as a partner bank \nfor  the  project  for  a  number  of  reasons.  First,  DVB  has  an  interest  in  addressing  underserved \nsegments. Its current average mortgage loan size is approximately equivalent to $27,500, which \nis  less  than  many  of  the  larger  banks.  DVB  is  thus  deploying  a  niche  strategy  by  servicing  an \nunderserved segment of the market. Moreover, DVB is willing to move further down market with \nthe use of ADB proceeds. Second, DVB\u2019s parent bank, the DFCC, is a well-known development \nbank  with over  60  years  of  experience  in  the  market.  DVB  benefits from  this  brand recognition, \nwhich  is  particularly  important  for  personal  loans  such  as  mortgages.  Third,  DVB  has  an \nextensive branch network of 127 branches, of which 105 are outside Colombo, including eight in \nthe  North  and  East.  Finally,  although  DVB  is  ranked  eighth  in  the  market  in  terms  of  assets \n($353.3 million as of 31 December 2011), its credit standing is close to or on par with some of the \nlarger commercial banks. Fitch Ratings Sri Lanka has given DVB a AA- rating, which is equivalent \nto ratings for Hatton Bank and Sampath Bank and only one notch lower than Commercial Bank of \nCeylon.9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) meetings with the Bank Supervision Department of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in \nMay 2012. \n\n5  Shorebank  International.  2012.

The project entails the provision of long-term funding of $15 million \n8. \nto  enable  DVB  to  provide  mortgages  to  borrowers  to  purchase  affordable  housing  and  to \nrehabilitate  existing  homes.  The  project  has  geographic  targets  to  support  rehabilitation  in  the \nNorth,  East,  and  South.  To  strengthen  the  banking  sector  and  enhance  ADB\u2019s  developmental \nimpact,  DVB  will  also  be  participating  in  ADB\u2019s  existing  TA  for  Housing  Finance  Capacity \nDevelopment in South and Southeast Asia to further strengthen its mortgage loan origination and \nservicing  capacity.10 This  will  be  the  ADB  Private  Sector  Operations  Department\u2019s  first  housing \nfinance transaction in Sri Lanka. \n \nB. \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \nDVB is a subsidiary of DFCC and a licensed commercial bank.11 A merger between DFCC \n9. \nand  DVB  in the  long  term  is  possible,  but this  may  be  dependent  on future  amendments  to  the \ncurrent Banking Act and CC being able to obtain a combined license/ commercial banking license \nwith  strong  development  banking  links.12 In  addition  to  its  large  branch  network,  DVB  has  200 \nautomatic teller machines13 and 750 staff. At end December 2011, DVB had a 1.3% market share \nof total banking loans, 1.2% in terms of deposits, and 1.0% of total assets.14 DVB's lending focus \nhas  historically  been  the  provision  of  working  capital  facilities  to  SMEs  and  corporate  entities. \nDVB  began  providing  housing  loans  in  2006;  however,  mortgage  lending  accelerated  after  the \nwar in 2009. DVB established the Personal Financial Services Unit in 2010, which offers personal \nloans for professionals, mortgages and construction,15 education loans, financing of imports, and \npurchase  of  motor  vehicles.  As  of  the  end  of  2011,  DVB\u2019s  portfolio  was  segmented  as  follows: \ncorporate  banking  22%,  business  banking  17%,  branch  banking  and  SMEs  50%,  and  personal \nfinancial services (PFS) 11%. \n \n10.  With  the  establishment  of  the  Personal  Financial  Services  Unit,  DVB  has  strategically \nshifted  to  a  customer-centered  approach  to  better  respond  to  growing  consumer  demands  and \nthe  improving  economy  following  the  cessation  of  the  civil  war.16   By  2015,  PFS  is  expected  to \ncontribute  to  33%  of  all  bank  advances.  DVB  has  launched  a  number  of  standard  asset  and \nliability  products,  such  as  leasing  loans,  education  loans,  and junior  plus  savings  and  deposits. \nWith  respect  to  its  mortgage  lending  activities,  to  meet  this  target,  DVB  launched  Vardhana \nSandella, its branded housing loan product targeted at borrowers from business and professional \nbackgrounds. DVB also benefits from its existing base of SME customers, as it is familiar with the \nmarket segment and can cross-sell its affordable home loan product to these potential borrowers. \nSecond,  DVB  recruited  an  experienced  PFS  head  who  has  23  years  of  consumer  loan \nexperience, including mortgage lending, from a leading bank in Sri Lanka. Third, DVB has further \nstrengthened the SME department, enabling experienced staff to provide branches with expertise \nin areas including mortgage lending, and guidance as needed.  A separate mortgage finance unit \nwill be created by the end of 2012. \n \n11. \nThe  opening  of  the  Northern  and  Eastern  provinces  is  viewed  by  DVB  as  a  market \nopportunity, given the pent-up demand for financial services. DVB envisages an expanding role in \n\n                                                \n10 ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance for Housing Finance Capacity Development in South and Southeast Asia. Manila \n\n(TA 7469-REG). \n\n11 The Central Bank of Sri Lanka issues banking licenses for two categories of banks: licensed commercial banks and \nlicensed specialized banks. The main difference is that licensed commercial banks are permitted to accept demand \ndeposits from the public and can act as authorized dealers in foreign exchange, which entitles them to engage in a \nwide-range of foreign exchange transactions.  Licensed specialized banks cannot do this. \n\n12 The merger is dependent on the legal implications of holding both a commercial bank and a specialized bank license. \n13 Includes other access points apart from own automatic teller machines. \n14 DVB Bank Market Study 2012. \n15 Construction relates to building of individual houses or renovation for individuals or families on a small scale. \n16 Per capita income has steadily increased, rising from $899 in 2000 to $2,400 in 2010.

By the end of 2012, DVB \nwill  add  eight  branches,  giving  DVB  16  branches  in  the  North  and  East  and  by  far  the  largest \ndistribution  network  among  the  banks  in  Sri  Lanka  in  the  conflict-affected  areas.  Parallel  to  the \nphysical expansion, DVB increased the number of staff and management by 19% to a total of 750 \nemployees  to  strengthen  core  banking  areas  and  to  match  the  growth  of  business  volumes. \nDVB\u2019s expanded geographical penetration and increased number of staff enables it to market its \nPFS  products  to  individual  customers  in  rural  and  semi-urban  areas,  where competitors  are  not \nnumerous. Eighty percent of DVB\u2019s PFS portfolio is from the outstations.17 \n \nC. \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\n1. \n\nOwnership \n\nDVB,  previously  known  as  the  National  Mercantile  Bank,  was  established  as  a  licensed \n12. \ncommercial  bank  in  1996.  DFCC  acquired  the  National  Mercantile Bank in 2003  when  it  was in \nneed  of  capital,  and  subsequently  restructured  and  renamed  it.  DFCC,  with  total  assets  of \nSLRs109.5  billion  as  of  December  2011,  is  ranked  fourth  in  the  market  as  of  30  June  2011  in \nterms  of  total  assets.18 DFCC  currently  holds  a  99.1%  stake  in  DVB.19 It  obtained  regulatory \napproval to increase its holding in DVB to 100% in April 2011. Major shareholders of DFCC are \nthe  Bank  of  Ceylon  Pension  Fund  (14.3%),  the  Sri  Lanka  Insurance  Corporation  (13%),  the \nHatton National Bank (12%), M. Yaseen (8.6%),20 the Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka (6.4%), \nthe  Seafeld  International  (5.76%),  and  the  Employees  Provident  Fund  (4.8%). 21  DVB  is  of \nstrategic importance to DFCC, accounting for 42% of DFCC\u2019s assets as of the end of December \n2011, and plays an important role in expanding the group\u2019s product offering. The two banks are \nviewed  by  DFCC  as separate economic  entities, but  with  integrated front-  and most  back-office \nfunctions. \n \n\n2. \n\nManagement \n\n13. \nDVB\u2019s  senior  management  consists  of  a  team  of  banking  executives  with  experience \nacross multiple banks in Sri Lanka and who are responsible for managing DVB in conformity with \nits stated goals. The key senior positions are (i) chief executive officer (CEO), (ii) chief operating \nofficer, (iii) executive vice-president of lending, (iv) senior vice-president of treasury, (v) head of \noperations, (vi) senior vice-president of integrated risk management, (vii) vice-president of credit \nrisk  management  and  credit  risk  appraisal,  and  (viii)  head  of  personal  financial  services.  The \nCEO,  L.  Silva,  has  more  than  25  years  of  experience  in  banking,  credit,  leasing,  factoring,  and \nbranch management.22  The bank has a number of management committees.  The Asset Liability \nCommittee (ALCO) analyzes DVB's operating condition and market risks, and devises strategies \nfor  managing  risks  and  meeting  funding  needs.  The  ALCO  reports  to  the  Integrated  Risk \nManagement Committee. \n \n\n3. \n\nGovernance Structure \n\nDVB  is  managed  through  various  levels  of  corporate governance,  including the  board of \n14. \ndirectors, several board committees to facilitate managing DVB's operations, and the internal and \nexternal  audit  function.  The  board  of  directors  reports  to the  shareholders  and  is  headed  by  its \n                                                \n17 DVB. 2012. DVB Annual Report. Colombo. \n18 Fitch. 2011.

Yaseen owns Readywear Industries (a major garment exporter) and has been a DFCC shareholder since 2002. \n21 In total,  32.1% of the bank\u2019s shareholding  is held by state-controlled entities (Employee Provident  Fund, Sri Lanka \n\nInsurance Corporation, and Bank of Ceylon). \n\n22 Ownership,  Management,  and  Governance  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2)  provides \n\ndetails of the bank\u2019s senior management team, as well as the bank\u2019s organization chart. \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nchair, who is responsible for leading the board and ensuring its effectiveness.  DVB is overseen \nby  a  board  of  directors  comprising  10  members,  of  whom  four  are  independent.  Apart  from  the \nchair  and  CEO  of  DFCC,  DVB,  and  DFCC  have  different  board  members.  They  come  from \nvarious  backgrounds  and  have  diverse  experience  both  locally  and  internationally.  The  board \napproves DVB's strategy, business plan, and corporate plan; reviews all of DVB's general policies \nand  principles;  and  is  involved  with  other  matters  relating  to  overall  bank  functioning  as \nappropriate. 23    The  board  of  directors  has  appointed  four  subcommittees  to  assist  in  the \nperformance  of  its  duties\u2014the  Audit  Committee,  the  Human  Resource  and  Remuneration \nCommittee,  the  Integrated  Risk  Management  Committee,  and  the  Nomination  Committee. \nCompliance within DVB is supervised by the Audit Committee, which reports to the board.  \n \nD. \n\nFinancial Performance \n\nDVB\u2019s  overall  financial  performance  is  strong.  Total  assets  increased  by  56%  from \n15. \nSLRs29.5 billion to SLRs45.9 billion from 2010 to 2011. As of the end of March 2012, total assets \nwere SLRs52.9 billion. Growth in net income was 92% from 2010 to 2011, which is strong given \nthe  competitive  interest  rate  environment  and  DVB\u2019s  increased  branch  network  costs.

DVB\u2019s capital position is strong at 17.2% of risk-weighted assets as of \nthe  end  of  2011.  This  is  an  improvement  from  15.4%  as  of  the  end  of  2010,  which  was  due  to \nfresh capital infusion of SLRs1.1 billion from the parent company by way of a rights issue and a \nfully subscribed SLRs1.0 billion subordinated debenture issue in 2011. \n \n17. \nAsset quality. DVB\u2019s nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio, defined as 90 days and above past \ndue,  was  4.3%  as  of  the  end  of  2011,  below  the  industry  average  of  4.5%  and  comparing \nfavorably to the NPL ratio of 7.2% reported at the end of 2010. Housing NPLs were low at only \n2%  as  of  March  2012.  The  overall  improvement  of  the  quality  of  the  credit  portfolio  reflects  the \nbenefits of stable economic conditions and DVB\u2019s concerted actions to reduce NPLs by tightening \ncredit underwriting standards.  \n \n\n                                                \n23 Ownership,  Management,  and  Governance  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2)  provides \n\ndetails regarding DVB\u2019s directors. \n\n \n\n\f6  \n\n \n\nEarnings. Operational costs have increased due to branch network growth, upgrading of \n18. \nmanagement  information  systems,  and  the  recruitment  of  additional  staff.  However,  profits  still \nremained  robust.  After-tax  earnings  increased  by  92%  from  SLRs275.9  million  in  2010  to \nSLRs531.4  million  in  2011  in  line  with  the  increase  in  DVB\u2019s  lending  portfolio,  which  grew  from \nabout SLRs19 billion in 2010 to SLRs33 billion in 2011. The increase in net profit was driven by \ngrowth in fund- and fee-based income, cost efficiencies relating to operations, and reduced loan \nimpairment charges. Net income during the three months ending 31 March 2012 was SLRs150.7 \nmillion. \n \n19. \nLiquidity.  DVB  has  diversified  sources  of  funds.  During  2011,  DVB  was  able  to  borrow \nshorter-term funds from commercial banks and raise capital from the market. DVB\u2019s loan\u2013deposit \nratio  increased from  91%  to  104% from  2010  to  2011as  deposits grew  more  slowly  than loans. \nThere  were  negative  maturity  gaps  in the  3\u20136-month  bucket  due  to  deposit  maturities,  as  more \ndepositors  prefer  a  shorter  investment  horizon  when  there  is  an  upward  movement  in  the  yield \ncurve,  and  in  the  above  5-year  bucket  due  to  the  shortage  of  longer-term  financing,  which  is \nrequired for  some  of  the  longer-term  products  such as  mortgage  loans. ADB\u2019s  10-year  loan will \nhelp to reduce maturity mismatches for longer-term mortgage loans.24 \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\nA. \n20. \nADB proposes to provide a senior unsecured loan to DVB of $15 million with a tenor of 10 \nyears.  DVB  will  be  required  to  use  the  facility  exclusively  for  mortgage  onlending  and  housing \nrehabilitation loans. The ADB loan will be disbursed in two tranches to help DVB better manage \nits growth and to benefit from ADB\u2019s TA for Housing Finance Capacity Development in South and \nSoutheast  Asia  (footnote  10).The  capacity  development  TA  will  focus  on  (i)  improving  credit \nassessment techniques with a particular emphasis on assessing self-employed or lower-middle-\nincome borrowers, which comprise part of the target market of the project; (ii) developing a more \ndetailed  scorecard  for  housing  loan  borrowers  and  portfolio  and  risk  management;  and  (iii) \ntraining. \n \n21. \nHousing loan  parameters  for  the  ADB  facility.  ADB will restrict the use of its funds to \nonly owner-occupied residences to prevent speculative lending. Additionally, a geographic target \nwill  be  set  at  a  minimum  of  30%  outside  Colombo  in  the  North,  East,  and  tsunami-impacted \nareas. To ensure that DVB is providing loans for affordable housing, it will be expected to have an \naverage mortgage loan size of not more than $20,000 for the pool of mortgages originated from \nADB funds. This represents a reduction of about 25% from DVB\u2019s current average mortgage loan \nsize. Additionally, to ensure prudent growth of the portfolio, loan-to\u2013value ratios in excess of 80% \nwill not be allowed. \n \nB. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n22. \nReporting  arrangements.  DVB  will  be  required  to  provide  the  following  information:  (i) \nunaudited  quarterly  financial  statements;  (ii)  audited  annual  financial  statements;  (iii)  quarterly \ncompliance  certificates  for  agreed-upon  financial  covenants;  (iv)  semiannual  reports  on  the \nmortgage  portfolio,  which  will  include  data  on  loans  extended  to  women;  and  (v)  an  annual \nenvironmental  and  social  performance  report,  including  a  report  on  housing  loans  taken  by \nwomen. Pursuant to ADB\u2019s Operations Manual governing, Nonsovereign Operations, monitoring \nreports will be prepared on a regular basis, but at least annually. 25 The first monitoring report will \nbe prepared no later than 12 months after approval by the ADB Board of Directors. \n\n                                                \n24 Most deposits are rolled over at the new interest rate. \n25 ADB. 2010. Nonsovereign Operations. Operations Manual. OM D10/BP. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n \n \nC. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n23. \nADB will provide critically needed long-term funding to DVB, which DVB can in turn use to \noffer mortgages of longer tenor. Housing borrowers in Sri Lanka have been  adversely impacted \nby the country\u2019s low level of FSD (especially in  the North and East), including the absence of a \nwell-developed  capital  market,  which  limits  the  availability  of  longer-tenor  funding.  In  addition, \nADB\u2019s  involvement  ensures  that  the  loan  will  be  used  to  target  housing finance  needs  in  areas \nimpacted by the civil war and tsunami. With the recovery and the return of the diaspora, longer-\ntenor funding is essential to build or rebuild houses that have been destroyed or damaged, and to \nsupport future growth. Moreover, women who have lost their spouses in the war will also have the \nopportunity  to  borrow  and  build  secure  housing  and/or  improve  existing  dwellings.  DVB  has \ncommitted  to  provide  5%  of  the  facility  to  women  borrowers.  Lastly,  the  ADB  capacity \ndevelopment  TA  will  provide  DVB  with  support  to  prudently  expand  and  increase  the  efficiency \nand sustainability of services for mortgage lending. Increasing efficiencies is expected to enable \nDVB to improve affordability of mortgage loans.26 \n \nD. \n\nRisks \n\n24. \nPolitical  and  economic  conditions.  President Rajapaksa\u2019s coalition party has ruled for \ntwo consecutive terms since the end of the war. While the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam \nis  not  expected  to  reemerge  as  a  major  threat,  isolated  terrorist  attacks  may  occur.  In  addition, \nalthough  the  economy  has  been  strengthening  since  2009,  it  has  been  affected  by  the  global \ndownturn  and  high  interest  rates  due  to  a  lack  of  liquidity  in  the  banking  system. 27 Adverse \nchanges  in  the  political situation  or  a further  economic  downturn  could  negatively  impact  DVB\u2019s \noverall  performance,  as  well  as  the  demand  for  mortgage  loans.  However,  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  overall \noutlook  is  positive  and  GDP  is  projected  to  expand  by  7%  annually  (footnote  26)  on  average \nthrough 2016. \n \n25.  Regulatory  issues  pertaining  to  mortgage  lending.  The  Sri  Lankan  title  registration \nsystem  and  regulatory  environment  for  mortgage  lending  could  be  strengthened  to  accelerate \nhousing  ownership.    Regulatory  issues  have  not  constrained  growth  of  DVB\u2019s  housing  finance \nbusiness.    Banks  can  foreclose  on  property,  but  eviction  is  culturally  difficult.    In  the  north  and \neast,  there  are  titling  issues  in  certain  cities  as  a  result  of  the  civil  conflict.    DVB  will  carefully \nassess  titling  and  registration  issues  in  these  regions.    In  many  cases  where  clear  titles  are  an \nissue, DVB can obtain title insurance. \n \n26.  Market  competition. The housing finance market in Sri Lanka has become increasingly \ncompetitive since 2009, particularly in specific market segments. State-owned banks, helped by \nthe  offering  of  subsidized  lending  to  not  only  low-income  borrowers  but  also  middle-income \nborrowers, continue to dominate the housing finance market. However, DVB as well as other mid-\ntier banks are seeking to build their housing loan portfolios. While DVB currently operates in the \nupper  middle-  and  middle-income  market,  DVB  seeks  to  capitalize  on  its  niche  SME  market \nknowledge and broad distribution network to expand into other income and geographic segments, \nnow largely underserved, which is expected to give it a strategic advantage. The government is \nalso  not  expected  to  be  able  to  continue  to  provide  large  subsidies  to  state-owned  banks  on  a \nlong-term basis, which should contribute to leveling the playing field.  \n \n\n                                                \n26 The World  Bank estimates that  operational  efficiency  gains  can save  borrowers  100\u2013300  basis  points.

Country Report Sri Lanka. London (May). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8  \n\n \n\nPortfolio growth, evolving risk management/underwriting capacity. DVB reported an \n27. \nNPL  ratio  of  4.3%  in  2011,  a  decrease  of  2.9%  from  2010,  coinciding  with  total  loan  growth  of \n75% in 2011. DVB\u2019s mortgage loan portfolio has also performed well with an NPL ratio of 2% as \nof 31 March 2012. DVB has implemented a number of measures to improve credit underwriting \nand portfolio monitoring standards including the use of a risk rating tool, sector segmentation, and \nincreasing down payments when necessary. In the near term, the bank plans to further tailor its \ncredit scoring system for mortgage lending.  ADB\u2019s TA will help to further strengthen DVB\u2019s credit \nunderwriting  and  servicing  standards  to  help  the  bank  manage  its  expansion  in  this  market \nsegment.  Additionally,  ADB\u2019s  loan  will  be  provided  in  two  tranches  to  prudently  manage  loan \norigination. ADB will monitor asset quality  via reporting from DVB on the bank and its mortgage \nportfolio.  \n \nFuture  funding  risk.  Growth  of  DVB's  mortgage  business  is  dependent  upon  access  to \n28. \nlong-term  funding and deposit growth, which are constrained by the state of the capital markets \nand macroeconomic instability. Banks can access capital markets, but the tenor of bonds tends to \nbe shorter term. In the future, as the capital markets mature, banks may be able to issue longer-\nterm bonds. More immediately, longer-term funding can be obtained through other IFIs active in \nSri Lanka. DFCC has relationships with various IFls and has been successful in obtaining funding \nfrom them.  \n \n29. \nCurrency risk. DVB will borrow and repay in US dollars, although all mortgage loans will \nbe in Sri Lanka rupees. To mitigate this risk, DVB will hedge the ADB loan and the Central Bank \nof  Sri  Lanka  has  offered  swaps  at  preferred  rates  for  all  banks  obtaining  foreign  funds.  DVB  is \ncompliant with the prudential open exposure limit of a daily maximum of $3 million. As of the end \nof December 2011, DVB had an open exposure of $2.6 million. As DVB\u2019s treasury operations are \nintegrated  with  DFCC,  DFCC  will  help  DVB  to  hedge  open  exposures.  Currently,  there  are  no \nviable  currency  swap  options  via  ADB,  and  ADB  does  not  have  the  ability  to  issue  a  local \ncurrency bond. Should this scenario change during the tenor of the loan, DVB will have the option \nto convert the loan on agreed terms with ADB. \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nA. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nThe project will directly contribute to private commercial banks, especially tier-two banks, \n30. \nhaving  an  increased  share  in  the  housing  finance  sector  in  Sri  Lanka,  which  is  important  given \nthat  state-owned  banks  have  the  dominant  share  of  the  market.  Increasing  the  private  sector\u2019s \nshare of the housing finance market from 36% to 46% by supporting the growth of mid-tier banks \nis  expected  to  improve  competition  in  the  sector  and  lead  to  the  development  of  competitive \npricing and better products and services. It is also expected to help address housing shortages, \ngiven that, as more mortgage financing becomes available for affordable housing, construction in \nthis segment typically grows.28 Other indirect development impacts of housing finance include an \nincreased  contribution  of  the  construction  sector  to  overall  economic  growth  and  employment \ngeneration,  particularly  for  unskilled  or  nonprofessional  or  technical  workers,  through  its  many \nbackward and forward linkages.29 The main outcome from the project is the successful expansion \nof DVB\u2019s housing finance program to an underserved segment, while ensuring a minimum 30% of \nthe amount equal to the ADB loan is provided as mortgage loans in the North, East, and South by \n\n                                                \n28 In many emerging market countries, housing shortages can be directly linked to a lack of housing finance.

DVB  will  also  commit  to  providing  at  least  a  5%  of  the  amount  equal  to the  ADB  loan  to \nfemale  mortgage  borrowers    and  at  least  40%  of  the  amount  equal  to the  ADB  loan  to  married \ncouples  (jointly  to  husbands  and  wives)  by  the  end  of  2017.    The  output  includes  DVB  having \nincreased  housing  finance  from  DVB.  A  key  output  of  the  TA  will  be  improved  credit  risk \nassessment and servicing capabilities to  better target more lower-income clients. The latter is a \nresult  of  the  parallel  CDTA  approved  in  2009  by  ADB  for  capacity  development  for  housing \nfinance,  some  resources  from  which  will  be  specifically  directed  to  DVB  to  enable  it  to  improve \nthe quality of its growing housing portfolio. DVB will also commit to a target of training 50% of its \nfemale credit analysts with funding from the CDTA. \n \nB. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\n31. \nUnder Strategy 2020, ADB will strengthen its support to the finance sector at the regional \nand  national  levels  by  helping  to  develop  financial  infrastructure,  institutions,  and  products  and \nservices and by promoting inclusive growth.30 Through such initiatives, ADB will continue to assist \nin  channeling  the  region's  savings  into  the  most  productive  investments,  as  well  as  continue  to \nbuild  the  capacity  of  financial  institutions  by  introducing  international  best  practices.  The \ninvestment  supports  institutional  and  finance  sector  development  through  the  deepening  of  the \nfinance sector by expanding mortgage lending in Sri Lanka to an underserved customer segment.  \n \nThe  project  is  also  consistent  with  the  government\u2019s  10-year  development  policy \n32. \nframework  (DPF),  2007\u20132016,  and  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132016.31 The  DPF \nwas revised in 2010, reflecting the change in the country\u2019s environment after the end of the war. It \naims  to  accelerate  economic  growth,  increase  access  to  finance,  address  low  private  sector \nthe \ninvestment, \nenvironment.32 The  country  partnership  strategy  is  built  on  the  DPF  and  Strategy  2020,  which \nspecifies a focus of ADB assistance on private sector development and expanding the role of the \nprivate sector, including projects that support housing. The project supports both these objectives \nby  increasing  the  share  of  private  commercial  financing  in  the  housing  finance  market  and \nimproving bank capacity in this area through TA. \n \n\nindicators,  eradicate  hard-core  poverty,  and \n\nimprove  social \n\nimprove \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n\n33. \nSupporting FSD is a key focus of development assistance for ADB, in line with the tenets \nof  ADB's  Private  Sector  Development  Strategy  (footnote  32)  and  enhanced  poverty  reduction \nstrategy.33 The latter states that ADB seeks to promote \u2015sound and efficient banking systems and \ncapital  markets\u2016  since  these  are  seen  as  \u2015indispensable for  macroeconomic  stability,  mobilizing \nsavings  and  ensuring  availability  of  long  term  financing,  an  essential  requirement  for  pro-poor \ngrowth\u2016  (footnote  33).  ADB's  Private  Sector  Development  Strategy  refers  specifically  to  ADB's \nrole  in  strengthening  the  finance  sector,  including  housing  finance,  in  developing  member \ncountries.  ADB\u2019s  Capital  Markets  and  Financial  Sectors  Division\u2019s  Business  Plan  and  Priorities, \n2010\u2013201234 also  states  that  ADB  will  support  housing  finance  projects  as  one  of  the  major \ncomponents  for  a  healthy  finance  sector.  In  addition,  ADB\u2019s  Finance  Sector  Operational  Plan \nhighlights  the  need  to  support  housing  finance  projects  as  part  of  FSD  in  developing  member \n\n                                                \n30 ADB.  2008.

DVB\u2019s  business  activities  have  minimal  or  no \nadverse environmental impacts, and are unlikely to entail impacts on involuntary resettlement and \nindigenous peoples. DVB will apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list, exclude all projects \nthat will have adverse environment and social safeguards impacts, ensure that investments using \nADB funds abide by applicable national laws and regulations and comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009). DVB will confirm this in its periodic reports to ADB and need not apply \nany other specific safeguard requirements.36 \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n35. \nDVB was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practices relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation \nincludes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nThe proposed senior unsecured loan is within the medium-term country, industry, group, \n\n \n36. \nand single investment exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \nConsistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),37 \n37. \nthe Government of Sri Lanka will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nassistance  to  DVB.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  finance  documentation,  in  form  and  substance \nsatisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n38. \nI am satisfied that the proposed senior unsecured loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the \nloan of $15,000,000 to DFCC Vardhana Bank for the Housing Finance Project in Sri Lanka, from \nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  such  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n6 August 2012 \n\n                                                \n35 ADB. 2011.
