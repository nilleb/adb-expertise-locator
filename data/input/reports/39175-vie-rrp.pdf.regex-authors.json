An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was \nAssessment  undertaken and the summary IEE is in Appendix 11.  \n   \nProject Description  The Project is designed to promote sustainable economic growth \nby rehabilitating 285 kilometers (km) of railway line from Yen Vien \nstation in the northern suburbs of Hanoi to Lao Cai on the border \nwith  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  The  Project  will \ndevelop a safe, efficient, and environmentally sustainable railway \ntransport system in the northwest region of Viet Nam, enhance \nconnectivity  with  the  PRC  through  the  Kunming\u2013Hai  Phong \ntransport corridor, and assist with institutional reform of the railway \nsubsector. \n   \nRationale  The Hai Phong to Lao Cai railway forms part of the Kunming\u2013Hai \nPhong transport corridor linking Yunnan province in the PRC with \nViet Nam. Minimal investments in improvements and maintenance \nhave meant that the railway bed and track have deteriorated and \nno longer meet capacity and safety requirements. The Project will \nrehabilitate the rail system to ensure it is capable of operating \nsafely and efficiently. Increasing capacity at stations and main \nterminal points and carrying out strategic rehabilitation will permit \nthe  use  of  heavier  and  longer  trains  and  an  increase  in  the \nnumber of trains using the railway line. The Project will contribute \nto the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) support for cooperation \nin  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  and  for  the \nGovernment\u2019s investment in transport infrastructure. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Project will support Viet Nam\u2019s economic development and \nstrengthen  regional  integration  by  enabling  cost-effective  and \nefficient railway services on a strategic transport corridor within \nViet Nam and between Viet Nam and the PRC. The Project will \nremove a capacity constraint on the existing railway line, improve \nrail transportation services on a vital stretch of the Kunming\u2013Hai \nPhong transport corridor, improve safety, and support institutional \nreform in the railway subsector. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the project is estimated at $160 million \nequivalent, including taxes and duties of $12.17 million. \n \n ", "ii \n                      ($ million) \nFinancing Plan  Source  Total  % \n  Asian Development Bank  60.00  37.50 \n  Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement  40.00  25.00 \n  DGTPE (MOF, France)  37.50  23.40 \n  Government  22.50  14.10 \n      Total  160.00  100.00 \n  DGTPE (MOF, France) = Treasury and Economic Policy General Directorate of \nthe French Ministry of Finance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nLoan Amount and  A loan equivalent to $60 million in special drawing rights will be \nLending Terms  provided from the Special Funds resources of ADB. The loan will \nhave a 32-year term including a grace period of 8 years, and an \ninterest rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper  annum  thereafter.  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement \n(AFD) will provide a loan of \u20ac32 million ($40 million equivalent) \nthrough  its  concessionary  loan  facility,  and  the  Treasury  and \nEconomic Policy General Directorate of the French Ministry of \nFinance (DGTPE) will provide a loan of \u20ac30 million ($37.50 million \nequivalent) through its Emerging Countries Facility (ECF). ECF \nloans fall under French official development assistance and are \nprimarily  dedicated  to  the  procurement  of  French  goods  and \nservices. The terms are typically 20-year maturity with a 5-year \ngrace period and an interest rate of 1.25%. The Government will \nfinance  $22.50  million  equivalent,  including  all  taxes  and \nresettlement costs. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The proceeds from ADB, AFD, and DGTPE loans will be made \nTerms  available by the Borrower to the Vietnam Railways (VNR). \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2012 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2012 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The  Railway  Project  Management  Unit  (RPMU)  will  be \nArrangements  responsible for implementing the Project, under the direction of \nthe VNR. The RPMU is one of four RPMUs of the VNR. It has a \ndirector, deputy director, and a small complement of planners and \nengineers.  Additional  qualified  technical,  financial,  and  support \nstaff for project management and implementation will be hired. \nThis  team  has  worked  closely  with  the  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance (PPTA) consultants to prepare the project, \nand will be responsible for preparing the Government\u2019s feasibility \nstudy, which is required for Government approval of the Project. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Vietnam Railways \n   \n ", "iii \nProcurement  Procurement under the ADB and AFD-financed components will \nbe in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. DGTPE \ndoes not have its own procurement guidelines and follows those \nof the beneficiary. The Government has requested the use of \nadvance action for procurement. \n   \nConsulting Services  The  ADB  loan  will  finance  200  person-months  of  international \nconsulting services and 524 person-months of national consulting \nservices  for  detailed  engineering  design,  preparation  of  bid \ndocuments  and  construction  supervision,  construction  quality \ncontrol, environmental supervision, procurement, and monitoring \nand  evaluation  of  the  safeguard  aspects  of  the  Project  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  on  involuntary  resettlement, \nenvironment,  and  indigenous  peoples,  and  with  Government \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. The international consultants will \nbe recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  Project  will  (i)  increase  the  corridor\u2019s  capacity,  benefiting \nBeneficiaries  consumers  and  producers  of  goods  and  services  through  the \nprovision of timely and efficient transport services and lower costs; \n(ii)  generate  direct  and  indirect  employment  in  the  project-\ninfluenced  area,  and  create  jobs  and  income-earning \nopportunities; (iii) greatly facilitate subregional trade, in particular \nby providing Kunming and the rest of Yunnan province with closer \nand  potentially  more  efficient  access  to  the  sea,  through  Viet \nNam\u2019s  Hai  Phong  port;  and  (iv)  stimulate  local  development \nthrough tourism, and railway station area development. The major \nproject  beneficiaries  will  be  (i)  passengers,  including  tourists; \n(ii) freight users; (iii) local residents who will benefit from the lower \nprices  of  commodities  and  services  transported  by  the  project \nrailway; (iv) local labor involved in construction work and supply of \nmaterials  during  implementation  and  later  in  operation  of  the \nrailway; (v) local manufacturers and traders who will be able to \nincrease  production  capacity  or  establish  businesses;  and \n(vii) local  governments,  which  will  benefit  from  the  increased \nopportunity for local area development and increased revenues. \nThe Project will benefit more than 200,000 people living in the \nproject area. Consultations with the local people in the project \narea indicated they strongly supported the Project. The Project is \nfinancially  and  economically  sustainable.  The  3.0%  financial \ninternal rate of return exceeds the 0.54% weighted average cost \nof capital. The economic internal rate of return is estimated at \n16.1%. \n   \n ", "iv \nRisks and Assumptions  The main risks to the Project are related to the traffic forecasts, \nparticularly international traffic between Viet Nam and the PRC. \nRealizing the forecast of international traffic will depend on the \nsuccessful implementation of the GMS Cross Border agreement \nat the Lao Cai/Hekou border crossing, scheduled for 2008. The \ncommitments  of  the  governments  to  implement  the  border-\ncrossing agreement and continued ADB assistance in this area \nwill mitigate this risk. Delays in the implementation of the PRC\u2019s \nplans  to  construct  a  new  railway  line  between  Kunming  and \nHekou that would replace the existing line that connects to the \nproject  railway  could  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  project \nrailway\u2019s international traffic, with a corresponding negative impact \non the Project\u2019s economic and financial viability and subregional \nbenefits.  However,  the  successful  implementation  record  of \nrailway projects in the PRC suggests this risk is slight. Traffic \nlevels on the railway may decrease if the amount of traffic diverted \nto the proposed new highway from Noi Bai to Lao Cai exceeds \npredictions. However, because different types of traffic are carried \nby railway and road, this is not expected to happen. Realizing the \ntraffic  forecasts  is  also  dependent  on  the  maintenance  of  the \nadjacent Hanoi\u2013Hai Phong railway line, so there is no decrease in \nits  capacity.  Assistance  to  VNR  from  ADB  and  German \ndevelopment assistance through GTZ for institutional reform will \nmitigate this risk. \n ", " \n ", " \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Kunming\u2013\nHai Phong Transport Corridor: Yen Vien\u2013Lao Cai Railway Upgrading Project; and (ii) proposed \nadministration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a loan to be provided by Agence \nFran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) for the Project. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  Through rehabilitation and upgrading of the Yen Vien\u2013Lao Cai railway line, the Project \nwill strengthen the subregional infrastructure network and improve the national transportation \nsystem connecting Hanoi with the northern provinces. It will improve connectivity along the \nGreater Mekong Subregion (GMS) northern economic corridor, comprising northeastern Viet \nNam and Yunnan province of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The improvements to the \nrailway infrastructure conform to the Government\u2019s overall plan to strengthen the integrated \nKunming\u2013Hai Phong transport corridor, including its rail, road, and port facilities. The Project is \nin  line  with  the  strategic  thrust  of  strengthening  connectivity  and  facilitating  cross-border \nmovement and tourism under ADB\u2019s regional cooperation strategy and program approved by \nthe Board of ADB in March 2004. The Project is included in the lending program for 2006 in the \nregional cooperation strategy and program updates for 2006\u20132008 and 2007\u20132009.1 \n \n3.  The  Project\u2019s  reform  agenda  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  objective  to  make  rail \ntransport more competitive and financially sustainable, thereby reducing the burden on state \nfinances and increasing the competitiveness of the economy. The improved transport network \nwill increase access to Lao Cai province, which is among the poorest provinces in Viet Nam and \nwhose population includes a number of ethnic minorities. It will open up opportunities for trade \nand investment and foster economic growth in the subregion. The employment and income-\ngenerating opportunities from increased trade and economic growth will help to reduce poverty. \nADB provided technical assistance (TA)2 to prepare the Project. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n4.  The transport sector in Viet Nam comprises road; railway; inland water; international sea \ntraffic, through the ports in Ha Long, Hai Phong, Da Nang, and Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC); and \ndomestic and international air traffic centered on Hanoi and HCMC. The country\u2019s transport \ninfrastructure suffered severe destruction and degradation during more than three decades of \nwar and its rehabilitation has been a primary goal of the Government. The Government\u2019s efforts \nare focused on (i) reconstruction of the road network, (ii) rehabilitation and upgrading of the \nrailway system, together with reforms to improve efficiency and sustainability of operation, \n(iii) modernization  and  upgrading  of  international  airports,  and  (iv)  rehabilitation  and \nmodernization of the ports. The Government made investment in transport infrastructure a key \npriority in its 2001\u20132005 public investment program. Nationwide, freight and passenger demand \nmeasured in ton/passenger km grew by 10% a year over the same period. While road remains \nthe dominant mode of freight transport, accounting for 65% of traffic by weight, rail plays an \nincreasingly significant role, particularly in the transport of bulk cargo over long distances. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

The Vietnamese railway network, 2,600 kilometers (km) long, was mainly constructed in \nthe early part of the 20th century using the French meter gauge ([MG], 1.0 meter [m]) line. It \nlinks the main population, cultural, agricultural, and industrial centers in Viet Nam and connects \nwith the PRC standard gauge ([SG], 1.435 m) railway networks at Lang Son in northeast Viet \nNam and with the PRC\u2019s MG network in the land-locked province of Yunnan at Lao Cai in the \nnorthwest. The railway in Viet Nam is a strategic link in the GMS Transport Sector Strategy\u2019s \nsouthern and north south corridors, which connects Cambodia, Thailand, and Viet Nam with the \nsouthern PRC. It is part of the plan to connect Singapore to Kunming by rail, a long-term \ndevelopment priority for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). 3  \n \n6.  Efficient railway transport will improve subregional traffic and significantly reduce the \ncost of transport by offering cheaper alternatives and providing competition to existing modes \nand routes. Railway transport will reduce road maintenance requirements and the incidence and \nseverity of traffic accidents by diverting heavy and hazardous road haulage to the railway. \nOverall, the increase in the efficiency and effectiveness of rail transport will improve transport \nsafety.  Efficient  rail  operations  will  directly  benefit  Government  finances  by  reducing  the \nrailway\u2019s deficits. The Government recognizes these benefits and is giving high priority to the \nrehabilitation of the railway. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Railway Subsector \n7.  The present problems and issues in the railway subsector arise from a historical legacy \nof central government ownership and operation with insufficient concern for economic efficiency \nof operations, quality of services, or sustainability of operations. The state invested in and \nsubsidized  the  railway.  The  current  level  of  transport  technology,  equipment,  and  system \ncapacity cannot meet the demands of a market economy. \n \n8.  Reform of the railway subsector has increasingly been an area of concern. Since the \n1990s, railway reform has passed through various stages. In 1994, financial responsibility for \nrail infrastructure and operations was separated.4 Since 2000, Germany has supported the \nrestructuring of the Vietnam Railways (VNR) with the goal of (i) making VNR\u2019s operations more \nmarket-oriented and competitive; (ii) supporting an internal reorganization to make operations \nmore efficient and effective; and (iii) helping to establish a legal framework to liberalize the \nrailway subsector and promote subregional integration. In March 2003, VNR was established as \na state corporation operating in railway transport and related services.5 The administration of the \nrailway  and  management  of  the  infrastructure  was  assigned  to  the  Viet  Nam  Railway \nAdministration under the Ministry of Transport.6 \n \n9.  Following the separation of rail infrastructure and operations, the core business of VNR \nis to operate and provide rail services on the principle of financial self-sufficiency. Funding for \ninfrastructure  maintenance  and  capital  investment  is  provided  by  the  state.  VNR  pays  an \ninfrastructure  use  charge  to  the  Government,  which  is  currently  10%  of  the  gross  annual \ntransport revenue. VNR is responsible for buying and maintaining locomotives, and investing in \nmaintenance facilities. It is free to set tariffs for the freight services it provides, based on market \ndemand. A Railway Law was passed by the National Assembly on 19 May 2005, providing a \nbasis  for  further  development  of  the  railway  subsector.  Regulations  for  implementing  the \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2006. TA 6195-REG: GMS Transport Sector Strategy Study, Final Report. Manila (June). \n4  Prime Minister\u2019s Dispatch No.46/VPCP dated 26 March 1994. \n5  Prime Minister\u2019s Decision 34/2003/QD-TTG issued on 4 March 2003. \n6  Government Decree 34/2003/ND-CP dated 4 April 2003. \n ", "3 \nprovisions of the Railway Law will be needed for the benefit of investors. This and other issues \nrelated to the financial sustainability of VNR will be addressed under the Project. \n \n10.  Because of the length of the haul from the north to the south of Viet Nam, the economy \nwould benefit substantially from an efficient and cost-effective rail transport. This can only be \nachieved  through  strategic  investments  in  infrastructure  and  facilities.  However,  resource \nconstraints limit the amount available from public sources. An enabling environment will need to \nbe  created  to  make  private  sector  participation  more  attractive  and  to  infuse  modern \nmanagement and business practices into the railways. Other transport modes, particularly road \ntransport, have significantly benefited from private sector participation. A sector analysis is given \nin Appendix 2. \n \n2.  Regional Cooperation \n11.  In order to achieve its vision of a prosperous, integrated, and harmonious subregion, the \nADB-supported  GMS  program  is  focused  on  enhancing  connectivity,  improving \ncompetitiveness, and engendering a sense of community. Viet Nam has an important role to \nplay in the pursuit of this strategy. Thailand and Viet Nam are the only GMS members that are \npart of the north\u2013south, east\u2013west, and southern economic corridors. Viet Nam provides a \nrapidly growing market and serves as a vital gateway for the subregion. It is a major advocate of \nthe transformation of the GMS transport corridors into full-fledged economic corridors, including \nthe  early  implementation  of  trade  and  transport  facilitation  to  improve  the  subregion\u2019s \ncompetitiveness. Viet Nam has been active in the GMS program and has participated in loan \nand regional TA projects.7 \n \n12.  The project railway line is an important component of the Kunming\u2013Hai Phong transport \ncorridor, which is part of the GMS north-south economic corridor. The Kunming\u2013Hai Phong \ntransport corridor is also included in the \u201cTwo Corridors-One Economic Belt\u201d initiative agreed by \nthe leaders of the PRC and Viet Nam in 2005 to further the growing economic relations between \nthe two countries. Trade between Yunnan province and Viet Nam has grown dramatically in \nrecent years. Total trade value registered at the Lao Cai/Hekou border crossing points along the \nKunming\u2013Hai Phong transport corridor expanded by 36% in 2003 and by 51% in 2004 (to $366 \nmillion). This figure accounts for 80% of Yunnan\u2013Viet Nam trade and 10% of the PRC\u2013Viet Nam \ntrade in 2004. Nearly 1 million tons of cargo is transported annually across the Lao Cai/Hekou \nborder crossing points. \n \n13.  The GMS initiative aims to tap the comparative advantages of each GMS country for the \nbenefit of the subregion as a whole. The recent formidable economic growth of both Viet Nam \nand the PRC will put considerable strain on all transport modes in the Kunming\u2013Hai Phong \ncorridor. Road, rail, and ports are reaching their capacities and commodities need to be directed \nto the most cost-effective transport modes and routes. High growth in Yunnan province, which \nto a large extent is export-driven, requires cost-effective outlets. Fangcheng and Beihai ports in \nthe PRC have lower capacity than Viet Nam\u2019s Hai Phong port, which is also about 250 km \ncloser to Yunnan and more cost-effective. The road alignment within the corridor is being \n                                                 \n7  As of the end of June 2006, of the 26 ADB-assisted loan projects for the GMS with a combined amount of $6.5 \nbillion (for which ADB has extended $1.8 billion in loans), Viet Nam participated in 5 loan projects with a combined \namount of $572 million (for which ADB extended $154 million in loans). Viet Nam was a recipient of all four multi-\ncountry ADB loans for the GMS, including the Ho Chi Minh City\u2013Phnom Penh Highway Improvement Project (with \nCambodia) and the East-West Transport Corridor Project (with Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic). Viet Nam has \nalso been involved in 103 (out of a total of 124) ADB-supported regional TA projects, for which ADB has provided \n$58 million, including, among others, the (i) formulation, negotiation, and finalization of an agreement for the \nfacilitation of the cross-border movement of goods and people; (ii) conduct of the Transport Sector Strategy Study \n(TSSS); and (iii) formulation of a Strategic Framework for Action on Trade Facilitation and Investment. \n ", " 4 \nupgraded under a separate project with ADB assistance. There is substantial traffic in local \nmineral resources and containers to and from the PRC by road over distances that would be \nmore economic by rail. Before the opening of the border between Viet Nam and PRC, this \nrailway line was neglected both in terms of maintenance and investment and it is not fit to carry \nthe  expected  traffic.  The  Governments  of  Viet  Nam  and  the  PRC  are  both  committed  to \nimproving trade facilitation under a bilateral agreement, and are both active participants in the \nADB-assisted GMS economic corridor concept and the GMS Transport Forum.  \n \n3.  The Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s Strategy \n14.  The recently approved Socio-Economic Development Plan, 2006\u20132010 (SEDP)8 for Viet \nNam recognizes the importance of regional cooperation and integration in the attainment of the \nMillennium Development Goals and Viet Nam\u2019s own development goals. Border districts and \nprovinces,  including  Lao  Cai,  are  among  the  poorest  areas  in  the  country,  and  their \ndevelopment is significantly influenced by Viet Nam\u2019s neighbors, including Yunnan province. \nIntraregional trade and investments have played an important role in accelerating the pace of \neconomic  growth  in  Viet  Nam.  The  SEDP  seeks  to  strengthen  and  expand  Viet  Nam\u2019s \nparticipation in regional cooperation activities as regional cooperation and integration (RCI) \ngains  momentum  in  Southeast  Asia.  Given  Viet  Nam\u2019s  strategic  location,  RCI  offers  the \npotential for increased trade and investment through better infrastructure links and expanded \nmarkets. Toward this end, the SEDP supports the development of cross-border infrastructure \nand customs and administrative reform. \n \n15.  Greater synergy between the SEDP and the GMS program is supported by ADB\u2019s \ncountry strategy and program for Viet Nam (2007\u20132010)9 and the regional cooperation strategy \nand program for the GMS (footnote 3). The GMS program\u2019s strategic priorities will continue to \nbe the framework for RCI activities in Viet Nam during the country strategy and program period. \nRCI through the GMS program is expected to contribute to economic growth, socially inclusive \ndevelopment,  and  environmental  sustainability.  Economic  activities  and  private  sector \ninvestment will be stimulated in areas influenced by the economic corridors. \n \n16.  The  overarching  objective  of  ADB\u2019s  strategy  is  the  reduction  of  poverty  through \nimplementation of an economic development strategy that is closely aligned to the SEDP and its \ntargeted  outcomes.  The  strategy  emphasizes  the  importance  of  the  smooth  movement  of \npeople and goods in an economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable manner. The \nobjective of ADB\u2019s strategy for the railway sector in Viet Nam is an economically viable railway \nsystem that meets the demands of a rapidly growing economy efficiently and effectively. The \nstrategy  envisages  a  mix  of  investment  and  institutional  interventions  to  rehabilitate  and \nupgrade the physical infrastructure and the legal and regulatory framework for the railway \nsystem. The investment objective of the strategy is to help the Government to rehabilitate and \nupgrade the existing rail network to meet the demands created by rapid economic growth and to \nextend the benefits of this growth to the remote and poor northwestern regions. The institutional \nobjective is to make rail transport more competitive and financially sustainable, through pricing \nreforms and private sector participation in investment and rail services. \n4.  Lessons  \n17.  Previous ADB-financed transport sector projects have been delayed because of (i) late \nprocurement  of  contractors;  (ii)  weaknesses  in  engineering  designs  because  insufficient \nresources were assigned to preliminary investigations; (iii) executing agencies\u2019 lack of familiarity \n                                                 \n8 The SEDP was approved by the National Assembly in June 2006.  \n9  ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n ", "5 \nwith ADB\u2019s procurement guidelines; and (iv) inflexibility with regard to project scope (e.g., the \nrigidity of the requirement to adhere to the Government\u2019s feasibility study makes subsequent \nchanges in scope very difficult). At the Government\u2019s request, for this Project advanced action \nhas been approved to allow the early recruitment of consultants to review the project design and \nprepare bidding documents, followed by the procurement of contractors. A period of 18 months \nhas been allowed for procurement activities. RPMU staff will be invited to participate in training \non ADB\u2019s procurement and project implementation procedures and will be given access to \nADB\u2019s extensive publications and information on procurement and project implementation. The \nneed  to  minimize  inconsistencies  between  project  scope  and  the  Government\u2019s  approved \nfeasibility study has been addressed by including additional site surveys and ensuring greater \nattention to detail than would ordinarily be expected for an ADB feasibility study. \n \n5.  External Assistance \n18.  The largest sources of external assistance to the transport sector in Viet Nam are the \nWorld Bank; ADB; and the governments of France, Germany, and Japan. External assistance to \nthe  railway  subsector  has  primarily  come  in  the  form  of  bilateral  assistance  from  France, \nGermany, and Japan. Details on external assistance to the railway subsector are shown in \nAppendix 3. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n19.  The project railway line, a non-electrified single-track MG line, which opened between \n1903 and 1910, traverses about 285 km in a generally northwesterly direction from Yen Vien \nstation, along the northern bank of the Red River to Lao Cai. The line crosses a varied terrain, \nincluding mountainous areas; connects a number of cities, towns, and industrial and residential \nareas; and carries substantial traffic (transit traffic between Hai Phong port and the PRC\u2019s \nYunnan province, bilateral trade between Viet Nam and the PRC, and domestic traffic, including \nfrom the apatite mine at Xuan Giao to the phosphate and chemical company near Tien Kien). \nThe railway line also provides reliable and cheap passenger transport to the poor northern \nprovinces. Rail services are popular, especially for tourists and locals visiting the mountainous \nregion around Sa Pa, which is about 35 km from Lao Cai. The alignment of the railway is \ncharacterized by tight curves; steep gradients; poor quality track, in particular lack of ballast; old \nand worn rail; insufficient track capacity at main stations; passing loops that are too short to \naccommodate  full-length  trains;  and  bridges  that  have  deteriorated  due  to  war  damage, \ncorrosion, and steel fatigue and which require speed restrictions. In addition, proximity to the \nRed River means that some sections of the railway embankment require regular embankment \nprotection works to prevent subsidence. \n20.  The PRC is planning to upgrade its rail link to the border to SG (1435 mm) as part of its \nnational railway standardization program (see Figure 1). The proposal includes: (i) extension of \nthe existing Kunming\u2013Anning\u2013Yuxi SG rail link to Mengzhi (on the existing MG route), either by \nbuilding a new SG link from Yuxi to Mengzhi or by building a new SG link from Yuxi to the \nexisting MG terminal at Baoxiu and converting the existing Baoxiu\u2013Mengzhi MG link to SG; and \n(ii) building a new 160 km SG rail link from Mengzhi to the Viet Nam border at Lao Cai. \n ", " 6 \nFigure 1: Viet Nam Rail Link at Lao Cai with \nTo Chengdu \nRailway Network in Yunnan Province of the \nTo Guiyang  People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \nAnning \nTo Nanning\nKunming \nPRC Railway existing MG \nrailway line from Viet Nam \nBorder to Kunming\nYuxi \nProposed New \nYuxi\u2013Mengzhi SG \nlink (141 km) under \nADB TA 4657 \nNew SG \nline to be \nbuilt \n(110 km) \nBaoxiu \nKaiyuan\nMengzhi\nExisting  MG  line  to  be \nupgraded to SG (142 km) \nInternational Border \nNew  SG  line  to \nbe built (160 km) \nHekou\nVIET NAM \nPRC\nVietnam Railways (VNR) MG \nLegend:  railway  line  from  the  PRC \nStandard Gauge (SG) Railway   border to Hanoi \nLao Cai\nMeter Gauge (MG) Railway \nADB = Asian Development Bank, km = kilometer, MG = meter gauge, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China,  \nSG = standard gauge, TA = technical assistance, VNR = Vietnam Railways. \n \n ", "7 \n21.  An  operational  analysis  carried  out  as  part  of  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance  (PPTA)  has  shown  that  the  forecast  traffic  for  the  period  to  2020  cannot  be \naccommodated on the existing line. A combination of measures will be required to increase \ncapacity to meet this additional traffic.10 The Project has been designed to implement the most \nimportant of these measures. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n22.  By removing capacity constraints, the project will: (i) facilitate trade and enable economic \ngrowth within and between northwestern Viet Nam and Yunnan province; (ii) facilitate access to \nand  from  Hai  Phong  port  to  Yunnan  province,  especially  for  container  traffic;  (iii)  reduce \ntransport costs; (iv) improve traffic safety; and (v) secure sufficient railway capacity to handle \nfuture traffic demand to 2020. \n \nB.  Outputs \n23.  The project comprises the following components.  \n(i)  Track component. (a) Improving the alignment of the existing track, especially \nat  sharp  curves  and  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Red  River  (to  address  problems \nassociated  with  flooding,  subsidence  of  embankment,  and  slope  stability); \n(b) replacing  worn-out  rails  with  heavier  hardened-steel  rails,  particularly  on \nsections  of  track  having  sharp  curves  where  rail  wear  is  most  severe; \n(c) replacing  old  sleepers  and  fastenings  to  prevent  gauge  expansion; \n(d) replacing worn out turnouts on the main line, and (e) ballasting of track. A \ntotal of about 240 km will be replaced with new rails, sleepers, and fastenings. \n(ii)  Bridge component. (a) Construction of six new bridges; (b) rehabilitation of 13 \nwar-damaged and corroded bridges, which currently have speed restrictions; and \n(c) strengthening of up to 60 substandard bridges to enable use of heavier and \nmore powerful locomotives. \n(iii)  Terminals component. (a) Constructing a new intermediate station at Mai Tung \nat km 124+200 including passing loops; (b) constructing additional passing loops \n(each with length of 480 m) at nine stations; (c) extending existing passing loops \n(minimum length of 450 m) at a further eight stations; (d) upgrading station \nfacilities  at  North  Yen  Vien,  Van  Phu,  Yuan  Giao  \u2018A\u2019,  and  Lao  Cai;  and \n(e) providing operational facilities at selected stations. \n(iv)  Safety  component.  Improving  rail\u2013road  traffic  safety  through  a  package  of \nmeasures, including (a) building one road over rail intersection at an existing rail-\nroad at-grade crossing at Dong Anh (km 20+700); (b) upgrading 44 existing at-\ngrade  crossings  by  providing  improved  track  crossing  structure  for  both \nmotorized and pedestrian road traffic; and (c) at selected unauthorized at-grade \nrail crossing points, provide about 5.5 km of fencing and permanent rights-of-way \nto channel traffic towards official crossing points. The rail safety works would be \nsupported by a public awareness campaign.  \n(v)  Reform  component.  (i)  Institutional  reforms  related  to  the  improvement  of \nfinancial governance, and (ii) cross-border procedures at Lao Cai.11 \n \nC.  Special Features \n24.  Subregional Context. The railway from Yen Vien, near Hanoi, to Lao Cai on the border \nwith the PRC is part of the Kunming\u2013Hai Phong transport corridor, which is a strategic link in the \nGMS  north\u2013south  corridor.  Developing  the  transport  corridor  is  a  high-priority  subregional \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing the Greater Mekong \nSubregion: Hanoi\u2013Lao Cai Railway Upgrading Project. Manila. \n11 These components will be financed by proposed grant TA projects described in paras. 31 and 35. ", " 8 \ntransport  project  under  the  GMS  Economic  Cooperation  Program,  which  aims  to  develop \nefficient multimodal infrastructure links between the GMS countries.12 The proposed Project will \nrestore and expand the capacity of a long-established link between Yunnan province in the \nsouthwest of the PRC and the strategic port of Hai Phong in Viet Nam on the Gulf of Tonkin. \nLandlocked Yunnan province has a growing need for efficient transport routes to sea ports for \nthe export of its goods. \n \n25.  The project railway line serves three primary purposes: (i) it will facilitate bilateral trade \nbetween Viet Nam and the PRC, which currently accounts for about 650,000 tons per annum \n(about 30% of current traffic on the line) and is expected to more than triple when the adjoining \nrailway in the PRC is upgraded (possibly by 2011); (ii) it will increase international trade from the \nPRC via the container port in Hai Phong, which could realize traffic growth of 12-15% per \nannum when the GMS cross-border agreement comes into force at the Lao Cai/Hekou border \ncrossing; and (iii) it will be an integral part of the Singapore\u2013Kunming railway link, which may be \ncompleted by about 2015 with the construction of the final link between Phnom Penh and Ho \nChi Minh City. \n \n26.  The  Governments  of  Viet  Nam  and  the  PRC  are  keenly  aware  of  the  benefits  of \nincreased trade, and both are planning to upgrade their infrastructure and to promote cross-\nborder and transit trade. The PRC is upgrading the railway line between Kunming and Hekou by \nconstructing a new railway to replace the line that was built in the early 20th century. About \n300 km are under construction and a decision on starting construction of the remaining 160 km \nto Hekou is expected in 2008 (subject to the findings of a feasibility study currently being carried \nout). A new expressway, which will end at the border, is under construction. In addition to \nupgrading the railway in Viet Nam, the Government is planning to build a new toll highway to \nconnect with the expressway in the PRC at Lao Cai. Border crossing procedures have been \neased in recent years by allowing trucks to cross into the border provinces on both sides of the \nborder and by enabling new banking and insurance services to facilitate trade. The GMS Cross-\nBorder Transport Agreement, which will streamline border crossing procedures, will be piloted at \nthe Lao Cai/Hekou border crossing by mid-2007. Reforms to the provisions for rail traffic are \nrequired to ensure the smooth passage of freight between the two border stations. The Project \nwill provide grant financing to address this issue. \n \n27.  Safety  Component.  In  recent  years,  urban  populations  along  the  railway  have \nincreased considerably, leading to a large number of vehicles at railroad crossings. Under the \nsafety component of the Project, a package of measures will improve the safety of rail and road \nusers and the public living near the railway line. These include improvements to level crossings, \nconstruction  of  a  flyover,  and  measures  to  check  unauthorized  track  crossings  by  public \nvehicles. These measures will reduce the number of incidents at crossings.  \n \n28.  Operational  Improvements. Increasing the loads of trains by using more powerful \nlocomotives will help to reduce the number of freight trains. This will conserve line capacity and \ndefer costly infrastructure improvements. At present, such locomotives are not allowed on the \nYen Bai\u2013Lao Cai section because of the sharp curves, weak bridges, and worn and distressed \ntrack. Under the Project these constraints will be removed to enable heavier trains to be used. \n29.  A new signaling system will be installed with assistance from the PRC government. \nHowever, the current condition of the track means that, without the additional and extended \npassing loops, and the urgently needed track upgrading, the new system will have limited effect. \n \n30.  The  Government  and  VNR  have  given  assurances  that  the  signaling  and \ntelecommunications works under the Project will be coordinated with those of the PRC signaling \n                                                 \n12 The fourth meeting of the Subregional Transport Forum in Vientiane agreed to develop the corridor by improving \nroads, railways, and inland waterways. This project has been specifically developed to support this strategy. \n ", "9 \nand telecommunications project in order to avoid duplication of work and to ensure efficient and \neconomic implementation of both projects. ADB advised VNR that for compatibility of signaling \non the route, the signaling component of the works at various stations under the Project should \nbe  implemented  under  the  PRC  signaling  project.  However,  if  the  PRC  signaling  and \ntelecommunications project cannot meet project requirements, the work will be incorporated into \nthe design and scope of the Project. \n \n31.  AFD proposes to fund a TA to review railway cross-border traffic at Lao Cai/Hekou, \nidentify bottlenecks, and recommend improvements (Appendix 4). The scope encompasses (i) a \nreview  of  cross-border  procedures  for  rail  traffic  and  identification  of  the  potential  for \nstreamlining, and (ii) a review of the handling of freight at the border, focusing on the handling of \ncontainers  and  other  break  bulk  commodities.  Container  and  break  bulk  commodities  are \ncurrently transshipped at the border from road in the PRC to rail in Viet Nam (and vice versa) \nand will continue to require transshipment or reaxling at Lao Cai when the railway line in the \nPRC is upgraded to standard gauge. The focus of the review of freight handling will be on \nidentifying possibilities for private sector involvement in container handling and container stuffing \nat Lao Cai. \n \n32.  Tourism. Hai Phong and Sa Pa in the project area are important tourist destinations in \nViet Nam. Hai Phong is near to the World Heritage Site at Halong Bay, and Sa Pa mountain \nresort is accessed from the railway station at Lao Cai. The many tourists visiting both resorts \nprovide much needed revenue to the local communities. In the case of Sa Pa (about 340 km \nfrom Hanoi), private tour operators have leased railway carriages from VNR and had them \noutfitted for luxury travel. \n \n33.  Associated Reform Program. The Government is reforming the railway subsector, with \nassistance  from  the  Government  of  Germany  through  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische \nZusammenarbeit (GTZ). A new Railway Law13 has been drafted and has been in effect since \n1 January 2006. The basic thrust of this reform is to allow private sector entities to take part in \noperations and some operational activities, such as onboard train services, will be outsourced. \nThe reforms also aim to inject a commercial orientation into the administration of VNR. The \nGerman Government has decided to extend its support to the reform process to the end of \n2008, and is in the process of developing an assistance program to (i) implement the new \nRailway Law by supporting the drafting of implementing guidelines and draft amendments to \nother related laws, and (ii) provide technical assistance to restructure VNR. However, before the \nnew law and the restructuring can become operational, a number of existing laws have to be \nrevised and new implementing rules worked out.  \n \n34.  Many  of  these  implementing  guidelines  can  be  prepared  by  VNR  without  outside \nassistance, but for several, including sequencing the reform steps, external expertise will be \nrequired. In addition to extending its support for the reform process, the German Government, \nthrough GTZ, will coordinate the reform process with the new donors in the railway subsector, \nincluding ADB and AFD. GTZ will help VNR to sequence the reform steps and is already \nassisting Saigon Passenger Company to set up a traffic costing system. \n \n35.  However, one major concern is the lack of an accounting and audit system that satisfies \ngenerally accepted accounting principles. Without a system that provides effective management \ninformation  and  enables  efficient  pricing  and  supply  of  railway  services,  private  sector \ninvolvement and railway modernization in general will not be successful. ADB has engaged \nVNR in a dialogue aimed at enhancing financial management services through a two-stage \napproach. First, an 18-month design phase starting in 2007 will assess VNR\u2019s accounting and \nmanagement information system, make proposals for internal audit and controller functions, \n                                                 \n13 Law No.: 35/2005/QH11. \n ", " 10 \nprepare a plan for implementation (including training and detailed arrangements for a phased \ntransition to the new system), and pilot test of a limited, semi-automated version within VNR\u2019s \nfreight operations. Second, a 3-year implementation phase will support a staged rollout of the \nnew systems throughout VNR. AFD proposes to provide grant TA for the first phase of the \nreform program and ADB plans to provide advisory TA for the second phase in 2009\u20132011. The \nterms of reference for the Enhanced Financial Management Governance Reform Program are \nin Appendix 5. \n36.  Based on the sequencing of reform steps being developed by GTZ, ADB and GTZ have \nagreed to work closely together. Both parties, together with other interested donors, will meet \nwith VNR twice a year as part of a railway reform consultation group, to take stock of the reform \nprogress,  recommend  adjustments,  and  identify  areas  that  need  further  attention  and \nassistance. \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n37.  The project investment cost is estimated at $160.0 million, including taxes and duties \nestimated at $12.17 million equivalent (Table 1). The cost estimates are based on quantities \nderived from preliminary engineering designs and market prices for goods and materials, and \ninclude  the  costs  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  environmental  mitigation  and \nmonitoring. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 6, including detailed cost estimates by \nfinancier. \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n  ($ million) \nItem   Amount \nA.  Base Cost a   \n1.

Financing Plan \n38.  The Government has requested a loan of $60.0 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years to help \nfinance a portion of the Project costs. The Government has also sought a loan from AFD of \n\u20ac32.0 million (approximately $40.0 million equivalent), and a loan from DGTPE of \u20ac30.0 million \n(approximately $37.5 million equivalent) in the form of a tied overseas development assistance \n(ODA) credit (Table 2). Conditions and arrangements for AFD cofinancing will be through a \nbilateral financing agreement to be negotiated between the Government and AFD after approval \nof the loan in December 2006. A cofinancing agreement will be entered into by ADB and AFD \n ", "11 \nunder which the parties will jointly finance the civil works and consulting services. The remaining \ncosts, estimated at $22.5 million equivalent, will be met by the Government from its own \nresources. DGTPE financing will be through parallel cofinancing using a loan from the Emerging \nCountries Facility (ECF). \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total  % \nADB  60.0  37.5 \nAFD  40.0  25.0 \nDGTPE  37.5  23.4 \nGovernment  22.5  14.1 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, AFD = Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement,  \nDGTPE = Treasury and Economic Policy General Directorate of the French Ministry of Finance. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n39.  VNR  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  Project.  The  Railway  Project \nManagement  Unit  (RPMU),  a  unit  within  VNR,  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  project \nimplementation. RPMU has been involved in project preparation and PPTA implementation. It \nwill be expanded and qualified technical, financial, and support staff will be recruited for project \nmanagement and implementation. ADB will be advised of the composition of RPMU and the \ncompetencies of the individual members as soon as its expansion is complete. ADB will provide \ntraining in procurement and project management to technical staff of VNR and RPMU. RPMU, \nacting  on  behalf  of  and  under  the  authority  of  VNR,  will  be  responsible  for  overall \nimplementation  of  the  Project,  including  procurement,  withdrawal  of  loan  proceeds,  and \nreporting to ADB and the cofinanciers. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n40.  The Project will be implemented over a period of about 5 years for completion in June \n2012.  The  Government  has  been  granted  advance  procurement,  allowing  recruitment  of \nconsultants to begin during the fist quarter of 2007 for appointment when the ADB loan is \ndeclared effective, scheduled for March or April 2007. A period of about 24 months is envisaged \nfor detailed engineering design, prequalification, preparation of bid documents, and tendering of \nthe works up to the stage of contract award. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n \n3.  Procurement \n41.  The procurement, financed from the ADB and AFD loans, will be done in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Civil works contracts have been packaged according to \nthree subsections of the project route. Each package will include all works on the subsection, \nincluding track, bridges, realignment, embankment stabilization, station upgrading, and safety \nworks. The civil works contracts will be procured by international competitive bidding (ICB) \namong prequalified bidders. The procurement of the DGTPE-financed package of rails, track \nswitches,  and  fittings  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  Government  of  France\u2019s \nprocurement rules.14 Other supply contracts that are not expected to exceed $100,000 in value \nwill be procured through shopping. A list of proposed contract packages is given in Appendix 8. \n                                                 \n14  The French intergovernmental loan facility called ECF (Emerging Countries Facility) is managed by DGTPE. \n ", " 12 \nRelevant sections of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy15 will be included in all bidding documents and \ncontracts. \n \n42.  ADB has approved the Government\u2019s request for advance action for procurement of civil \nworks to enable the EA to make preparations for construction of civil works according to the \nimplementation schedule. The Government was advised that, as per ADB\u2019s procedures, advance \naction includes all procurement activities up to the stage of contract award. The Government \nwas also advised that approval of advance action does not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n43.  The  Government  will  engage  an  international  consulting  firm  supported  by  national \nconsultants  for  detailed  project  design,  preparation  of  technical  specifications  and  bid \ndocuments, construction supervision, and quality assurance. Additional responsibilities include \nenvironmental supervision and management, updating, implementation and monitoring of the \nresettlement plan, socioeconomic impact assessment, and project performance monitoring. It is \nenvisaged  that  200  person-months  of  international  consultants  and  524  person-months  of \nnational consultants will be required. The terms of reference for the international consultants for \ndesign and supervision can be found in Supplementary Appendix A. International consultants \nfor the Project will be recruited using the quality- and cost-based method and a full technical \nproposal in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The Government was \nadvised that, for the recruitment of consultants, advance contracting is the normal procedure \nand that ADB\u2019s support of advance contracting does not commit ADB to approve the loan \nproject or to finance the recruitment costs. \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n44.  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  (footnote  13)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \nGovernment and the EA. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability \nand transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any \nalleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support \nthese efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy (footnote 13) are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB and AFD in connection with the Project will include provisions specifying the right of \nADB and AFD to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. In addition and \nto  ensure  transparency  and  good  governance,  VNR  will  publicly  disclose  on  its  website \ninformation on how the loan proceeds are being used, presenting procurement contract awards, \nincluding for each such contract the (i) list of participating bidders, (ii) name of the winning \nbidder, (iii) basic details on bidding procedures adopted, (iv) amount of the contract awarded, \n(v) list of goods and/or services purchased, and (vi) intended and actual utilization of loan \nproceeds under each contract. The website will be updated within 2 weeks of each award of \ncontract. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n45.  All disbursements under the ADB and AFD loans will be carried out in accordance with \nthe  ADB  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.16 Since  most  of  the  payments  will  be  made  for \ncontracts well above $200,000, direct payment procedures will be used to withdraw the loan \nfunds. The statement of expenditure procedure will be used to reimburse eligible expenditures \nfor any individual payment not exceeding $100,000 per contract. Disbursements under the \nDGTPE loan will be carried out in accordance with the financing guidelines for loans under the \n                                                 \n15  ADB. 1998.

VNR will open an imprest account at a commercial bank \nacceptable to ADB. The initial deposit will be $2.0 million. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n46.  The VNR will maintain separate accounts for the Project and have such accounts and \nrelated financial statements audited annually by an external auditor in accordance with auditing \nstandards acceptable to ADB and AFD. VNR will submit to ADB and AFD, within 6 months of \nthe end of each fiscal year, certified copies of such audited project accounts and financial \nstatements and auditor's reports, all in English. The audit of such financial statements will \ninclude (i) an assessment of the adequacy of accounting and internal control systems with \nrespect  to  project  expenditures  and  other  financial  transactions;  (ii)  an  assessment  of \ncompliance  with  financial  loan  covenants  and  ADB  and  AFD  requirements  for  project \nmanagement;  (iii)  an  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  statement  of  expenditure  procedure  (if \napplicable); and (iv) an opinion on the use of the imprest account. The VNR will also submit its \naudited  financial  statements  covering  income  statements  and  balance  sheets  during \nconstruction and in the first 3 years of commercial operations of the project railway within 6 \nmonths of the end of each fiscal year. \n \n47.  The RPMU, on behalf of VNR, will make satisfactory arrangements for reporting the \nprogress of project implementation by submitting quarterly progress reports through VNR. The \nform and content of the progress reports will be agreed with ADB and AFD. RPMU will monitor \nproject implementation in accordance with the implementation schedule, and will keep ADB \ninformed of any significant deviations from the schedule. The quarterly report will summarize the \ninformation in the detailed reports, including basic data, utilization of funds, achievement of \nimmediate development objectives, compliance with covenants, implementation progress, land \nacquisition, resettlement progress, and major issues and problems. Within 3 months of physical \ncompletion, RPMU will submit through VNR a project completion report to the cofinanciers, \nwhich  will  provide  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  project  design,  costs,  contractors\u2019  and \nconsultants\u2019 performance, social and economic impact, economic rate of return and such other \ndetails as may be requested by ADB and AFD. In addition, within 3 months of each loan closing \ndate, a loan completion report will be provided. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n48.  A  set  of  indicators  for  evaluating  project  performance  in  relation  to  its  impacts, \noutcomes, outputs, and conditions will be agreed to by VNR, ADB, and AFD before Project \napproval. The data will be collected within 6 months of the date of loan effectiveness, including \namong others (i) economic development and socioeconomic indicators, (ii) transport costs and \ntimes  for  passenger  and  freight  services,  (iii)  transport  services  and  transport  charges, \n(iv) accident rates, (v) financial sustainability of the rail sector, (vi) affected persons\u2019 incomes, \n(vii) access to social services, and (viii) jobs created in construction and maintenance.17 At the \nbeginning of project implementation, RPMU and the VNR will establish baseline and target \nvalues for the indicators. The indicators will be measured and compared with the baseline at \nproject  inception,  completion,  and  after  3  years.  Where  relevant,  indicators  will  be \ndisaggregated by gender. The project supervision consultant services will include qualified \nconsultants to help establish the monitoring and evaluation system, and train VNR staff in its \nuse. The main sources of data will include (i) secondary data from government sources, (ii) a \nhousehold socioeconomic sample survey, and (iii) participatory rapid appraisal. VNR will submit \na report summarizing the key findings of monitoring at inception, completion, and 3 years after \nphysical completion of the Project to ADB and AFD.  \n                                                 \n17   The PPTA consultants will define baseline indicators for performance of the railways, as well as the targets to be \nachieved after Project completion. \n ", " 14 \n9.  Project Review \n49.  In addition to annual regular reviews by ADB and AFD, the Government, ADB, and AFD \nwill jointly undertake a midterm review of the Project in mid-2009 to assess (i) implementation \nstatus, (ii) design and construction standards, (iii) performance of consultants and contractors, \n(iv) project impacts, (v) progress of sector reform, (vi) status of compliance with the covenants \nstipulated in the loan agreements, and (vii) the need for any changes in the project scope or \nschedule to achieve the Project impact. \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Traffic Forecast \n50.  The traffic forecast is based on a multimodal transport study, completed in 2005,18 and \nupdated under the PPTA. The study evaluated likely demand for passenger and freight traffic in \nthe corridor Hai Phong port\u2013Hanoi\u2013Lao Cai/Hekou\u2013Kunming between 2005 and 2025, and the \nlikely  distribution  of  traffic  between  railway  and  road  in  the  corridor  subject  to  alternative \nscenarios for future infrastructure development. \n51.  The study forecasted that there would be substantial traffic growth to 2025, with freight \nvolumes expected to increase by a factor of 2.8 to 3.6 by 2020, reflecting high economic growth \nin Viet Nam and the PRC, as well as an expected rapid modernization of transport systems, \nespecially increased use of containers. Capacity analysis shows that at the forecast traffic \ngrowth, the railway\u2019s capacity, assuming a reasonable service level, will be exhausted within 3\u2013\n4 years. The proposed project will enable the railway to fully meet forecast traffic demand until \n2020. \nB.  Economic Benefits \n52.  The proposed project will enable the operation of longer and heavier trains, which will be \nrequired to realize the increased capacity of the railway line when upgraded. The Government \nhas advised that VNR has enough rolling stock to use the increased capacity on the project line \nand that VNR is in the process of receiving 36 high-horsepower locomotives that fully meet the \ntraffic requirements of the railway line after it has been upgraded. The Government has assured \nits partners that sufficient rolling stock and high-horsepower locomotives will be available to \nutilize the capacity of the upgraded railway line. The Government\u2019s assurance is reflected in a \nloan covenant. \n53.  Preliminary  economic  analysis  indicates  that  the  project  is  likely  to  generate  an \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) of about 16.1%. The main sources of benefits are the \n(i) avoided  cost  of  forced  diversion  to  road  transport  due  to  insufficient  railway  capacity, \n(ii) operating cost savings for the railway due to operation of heavier trains, (iii) reduced wear \nand  tear  on  rolling  stock  due  to  the  replacement  of  worn-out  rail,  and  (iv) reduced  future \ninfrastructure maintenance costs due to rehabilitation of track and structures. The economic \nanalysis is in Appendix 9. \nC.  Subregional Benefits \n54.  The  Project  will  have  substantial  subregional  benefits  arising  from  increased  trade \nbetween northwestern Viet Nam and Yunnan province of the PRC and from transport cost \nsavings. The Project will improve transport from Kunming to Hai Phong port, which is closer to \nKunming than ports in the PRC and thus more attractive to container traffic. The distance from \nKunming to Hai Phong port is about 250 km less than that from Kunming to Fangcheng port in \nthe PRC. Hai Phong\u2019s container traffic in 2004 was 800,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) \nand the total cargo volume was 30 million tons, while the corresponding figures for Fancheng \n                                                 \n18  ADB 2005. Technical Assistance for the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for a Multimodal Transport Study on the \nKunming\u2013Haiphong Transport Corridor. Manila. \n ", "15 \nwere 125,000 TEUs and 14 million tons. In addition, Hai Phong is expected to continue to have \ngreater frequency of services and diversity of destinations than Fangcheng in the future. By \nimproving access to Hai Phong, the Project will provide benefits to producers of industrial and \nagricultural exports in Yunnan province. \nD.  Financial Benefits \n55.  The financial analysis indicates that, at current fare levels, the project will be financially \nviable with a financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of 3.0%. This FIRR is well over the real \nweighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 0.54%. Loan covenants will be included, requiring \n(i) the Government to implement track user charges as appropriate to secure full cost recovery \nfor the Government\u2019s debt service obligations, and (ii) VNR\u2019s total revenue to be at least equal \nto its total operating expenses, including the Government\u2019s appropriate track user charges. The \nfinancial analysis is in Appendix 10. \nE.  Environmental Impact and Assessment \n56.  Environmental  Classification.  The  proposed  Project  has  been  classified  as \nenvironment category B, meaning an initial environmental examination (IEE) is required. The \nIEE has been prepared according to ADB\u2019s environment policy19 and its requirements. The \nsummary IEE is included in Appendix 11. \n57.  To ensure that the Project will result in minimal environmental impacts, the following \nconstruction and operation issues have been carefully examined and control measures have \nbeen included in the environmental management plan (EMP): (i) disposal of excess earthworks, \nand increased soil erosion rates in disturbed areas; (ii) wastewater generation from work camps, \nworkshops and stations; (iii) dust, noise and gaseous emissions; (iv) solid waste disposal; \n(v) soil liquefaction in mountainous regions; (vi) impacts on terrestrial and aquatic resources; \n(vii)  public  health  and  safety;  and  (viii)  spillage  of  hazardous  materials  during  transport. \nInstitutional responsibilities and associated costs for EMP implementation were also addressed \nin the IEE. To strengthen the EA\u2019s capacity to address the environmental issues of railway \nconstruction  and  operation,  technical  assistance  for  environmental  management  will  be \nprovided to the EA and the RPMU, as well as to other subordinate institutes of the Ministry of \nTransport, in 2007.  \nF.  Social and Gender Impacts \n58.  The Project has been designed to minimize potential risks. A socioeconomic survey \ncovering all sections of the project railway and all project components was conducted during the \nPPTA. The project impacts were assessed along with potential associated risks. The social \nanalysis  indicates  that  93.2%  of  the  people  affected  by  the  Project  are  Kinh  (i.e.,  ethnic \nVietnamese) and 6.8% are from ethnic minorities. The ethnic minority groups living in the project \narea  are  Tay,  Hmong  Xa  Pho,  and  Dao  and  they  live  together  with  the  Kinh  in  mixed \nsettlements in towns. They are integrated into the urban lifestyle in terms of employment in the \nformal and informal sectors, housing, and schools. The ethnic minorities do not have separate \ncultural and social organizations to retain their traditional livelihood systems. The socioeconomic \nsurvey indicated that the Project is not expected to have any adverse effect specific to these \nnon-Kinh groups. Thus, ADB\u2019s policy on indigenous peoples20 is not triggered, and an ethnic \nminorities development plan is not required. However, to ensure that ethnic groups are not \nmarginalized during the process of resettlement, specific activities targeted at ethnic minorities \nare included in the resettlement plan. \n59.  The Project may increase the potential for the spread of HIV/AIDS and other sexually \ntransmitted infections because of the influx of workers during construction. This potential risk will \n                                                 \n19  ADB. 2002. Environment Policy. Manila. \n20  ADB. 1998. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples. Manila. \n ", " 16 \nbe mitigated by a program to increase the awareness of local communities and the workforce. \nSome concern has also been expressed on the possible impact of the Project on the increase in \nhuman trafficking from the provinces of Vinh Phuc, Phu Tho, and Yen Bai and along the border \nof Lao Cai and the PRC. The Project is not expected to contribute to this as cross-border rail \ntraffic is restricted to freight. Given the seriousness of this problem, however, an awareness \nprogram on human trafficking will be prepared in conjunction with a leading NGO active in this \narea, and included at different phases of project implementation.  \n60.  The social and gender strategy in the summary poverty reduction and social strategy \n(Appendix 12) includes a strategy for participatory resettlement activities. The gender strategy \nwill include training for staff from RPMU and other relevant agencies and leaders from the \naffected people to enable effective implementation of resettlement, livelihood activities, and \nsocial  safety  net  programs,  and  training  of  female  leaders  of  the  commune  and  mass \norganizations (Women\u2019s Union and Youth Union) to increase their participation in implementing \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking prevention. \n61.  The consultants will be required to assist RPMU in implementing the gender strategy, \nand an HIV/AIDS and human trafficking awareness program. A national consultant will be \nrecruited for 6 person-months for this purpose.  \nG.  Resettlement Impact \n62.  A full resettlement plan has been prepared. It is estimated that about 591 households \n(2,378 persons) will be affected by the rehabilitation of the railway. There are 411 households in \nthe project area. Of these, 128 will be required to relocate and 88 will lose more than 10% of \ntheir agricultural land. The two proposed resettlement sites will accommodate 180 households. \nThese households will be prioritized together with the 90 households that will relocate from Lao \nCai station. The main objective of the resettlement plan will be to avoid, and if that is not \npossible to minimize, resettlement. It will be updated and disclosed to affected people before it \nis submitted to ADB for further review and approval. The summary resettlement plan and the \nproject\u2019s detailed entitlement matrix are in Appendix 13. \nH.  Risks \n63.  The  main  risks  to  the  Project  are  related  to  the  traffic  forecasts,  particularly  for \ninternational traffic between Viet Nam and the PRC. Realization of the forecast of international \ntraffic is dependent on the successful implementation of the GMS Cross Border agreement at \nthe Lao Cai/Hekou border crossing, scheduled for 2008. The commitments of the governments \nto implement the border-crossing agreement and continued ADB and AFD assistance in this \narea will mitigate this risk. Furthermore, AFD proposes to finance on a grant basis a specific \nstudy on railway traffic at Lao Cai border crossing. This will analyze the current situation and \npropose some procedural and physical measures to facilitate traffic and transit exchanges which \nwill  complement  those  carried  out  under  the  implementation  of  the  GMS  Cross  Border \nagreement.  Delays in implementing the PRC\u2019s plans for the new railway line between Kunming \nand Hekou could have a negative impact on the project railway\u2019s international traffic, with a \ncorresponding impact on the Project\u2019s economic and financial viability and subregional benefits. \nHowever, the many examples of successful railway projects in the PRC indicate that this risk is \nslight. Traffic levels on the railway could also decrease if diversion of traffic to the new highway \nexceeds predictions. However, because of the different types of traffic carried by the railway and \nroad, the diversion is not expected to exceed estimates. Associated technical assistance to \nVNR from ADB, AFD, and GTZ will mitigate this risk. \n ", "17 \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n64.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  VNR  have  given  the \nfollowing assurances which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n65.  Financial  Performance.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  VNR  utilizes  technical \nassistance, to be made available under the Project, to optimize the Project\u2019s economic benefits \nand financial returns, including updating VNR\u2019s financial management system into a structure \nsuitable for a modern, commercial, market-based railway operation as envisaged under the \nRailway Law. \n66.  Financial  Statements.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  VNR  prepares  financial \nstatements  of  operations  showing  the  VNR\u2019s  actual  position.  The  financial  statements  will \ncomprise an income and expenditure statement and balance sheet. \n67.  Supply  of  Rolling  Stock. The Government will ensure that VNR deploys sufficient \nrolling stock and sufficient numbers of high-horsepower locomotives, at all times, for effective \noperation of the Project railway line. \n68.  Project Implementation. As the civil and track works under the Project are to be carried \nout while trains are operating on the project route, the Government will ensure that VNR takes \nall necessary measures, including adjustment of train composition, schedules, and operational \nspeeds, when necessary, to facilitate implementation of works on and adjacent to the track in \naccordance with the agreed implementation schedule. \n69.  Signaling and Telecommunications. The Government will ensure that the extensions \nto  the  existing  passing  loops  and  new  passing  loops  at  stations  under  the  Project  are \nimplemented in coordination with the ongoing signaling works to ensure efficient and economic \nimplementation of the Project. \n70.  Safeguard Issues \n(i)  Resettlement. The Government will ensure that VNR: (a) engages resettlement \nand gender specialists to assist in updating, implementing and monitoring the \nresettlement  plan  and  an  independent  monitor  before  any  land  acquisition \nactivities begin; (b) does not begin any land acquisition and relocation activities \nor  any  works  until  the  updated  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  and \napproved by ADB; and (c) carries out all resettlement activities in accordance \nwith the updated resettlement plan agreed by the Government and ADB. The \nresettlement plan will be prepared in compliance with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary \nresettlement21 and the laws, regulations, and procedures of Viet Nam. In case of \ndifferences between the Government\u2019s laws, regulations, and procedures and \nADB's policy requirements, ADB's policy requirements shall prevail.  \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that the people affected by the project, including \nthose  from  the  host  community,  are  compensated  at  replacement  cost  and \nassisted before they are displaced from their houses, land, and assets, so they \nwill be at least as well off as they would have been in the absence of the Project, \nThe poorest people affected by the project and vulnerable groups, including \npeople  from  ethnic  minorities,  will  be  assisted  so  they  can  improve  their \nsocioeconomic  status.  No  affected  people  will  be  displaced  until  suitable \nalternative land within the same or neighboring commune is allocated to them or \ncompensation is paid that is sufficient to purchase suitable alternative land within \nthe same or neighboring commune.  \n                                                 \n21  ADB. 1995.

The Government will ensure that, \nto the extent that any ethnic minorities are likely to be significantly affected by the \nProject, the measures set forth in the specific actions in the resettlement plan \nrelated to ethnic minorities, and as agreed between the Government and ADB \nare carried out in accordance with such actions, applicable laws and regulations \nof the Government and ADB\u2019s policy on indigenous peoples (footnote 20). \n(vi)  Social  issues.  VNR  will  ensure  that  all  works  contracts  under  the  Project \nincorporate provisions and budgets to the effect that contractors (a) comply with \nall applicable labor laws and related international treaty obligations and do not \nemploy child labor; (b) provide safe working conditions for male and female \nworkers; (c) implement the provisions set forth in the gender strategy for the \nproject;  and  (d)  carry  out  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  education  and \nawareness campaigns involving women\u2019s leaders and youth from households \naffected by the project, the Women\u2019s Union, and the Youth Union, with such \ncampaigns being held in coordination with government\u2019s programs and other \ninitiatives. \n(vii)  Gender.  District  resettlement  committees  established  according  to  the \nresettlement plan shall include representatives from the district Women\u2019s Union. \nCommune resettlement committees established according to the resettlement \nplan will include representatives from the commune Women\u2019s Union, as well as \nfemale  representatives  from  affected  households,  including  those  from \nhouseholds headed by women, and women from ethnic minority households. \nVNR will ensure there are capacity building training programs for district and \ncommune resettlement committee members, as well as female representatives \nfrom affected households, including households headed by women and women \nfrom ethnic minority households in order to provide, among other things, detailed \ninformation  on  resettlement  activities,  such  as  proposed  relocation  sites, \nentitlements, compensation and livelihood strategies for income improvement for \naffected persons, and grievance procedures. \n(viii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  VNR  (a)  prepares  a  format  for  monitoring \nreports with monitoring indicators broken down by gender and ethnic group for \npurposes  of  monitoring  and  reports,  and  (b) conducts  gender  sensitization \ntraining on gender and resettlement for its relevant staff, the district-level and \ncommune-level  resettlement  committees,  and  the  Women\u2019s  Union.  In  any \ninstance where land is acquired for affected persons, the Government and VNR \nwill ensure joint registration of land or land use rights in the name of both the \nhusband and wife. \n71.  Environment \n(i)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  its  laws  and  regulations  governing \nenvironmental  impact  assessments,  as  well  as  ADB's  environment  policy \n(footnote  19),  are  followed.  If  there  is  any  discrepancy  between  the \nGovernment\u2019s laws and regulations, and ADB's environment policy, the ADB \npolicy requirements will apply. \n ", "19 \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that the contract documents for works under the \nProject include specific measures in accordance with ADB's environment policy \nto mitigate negative environmental impacts caused by the construction and to \ngive due consideration to prevention of damage to the natural environment in the \ndesign, construction, operation and maintenance of the Project. \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that VNR implements the EMP for the Project, \nbased on the IEE, ensuring that it allocates adequate budget and staff resources \nfor  this.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Project  complies  with  best \nenvironmental practices and meets the mitigation and monitoring requirements in \na timely manner as described in the IEE. It will also ensure that there is no \ndamage  to  the  natural  environment  as  a  result  of  the  design,  construction, \noperation and maintenance of project facilities. The Government and VNR will \ncause (i) the contractors engaged under the works contracts to comply strictly \nwith all environmental impact mitigation and monitoring requirements set out in \nthe  contract  documents,  and  (ii)  the  consultants  engaged  for  construction \nsupervision  to  monitor  closely  compliance  by  the  contractors  with  the \nenvironmental impact mitigation and monitoring requirements. \n(iv)  The Government will ensure that VNR submits a semi-annual monitoring report \non the conduct of the IEE and EMP to ADB for review, and that this report will \ninclude updates on the development and implementation of mitigation measures. \n72.  Governance. To ensure transparency and good governance, VNR will publicly disclose \non its website information on how loan proceeds are being used, presenting procurement \ncontract awards, including for each such contract the (i) list of participating bidders, (ii) the name \nof the winning bidder, (iii) basic details on bidding procedures adopted, (iv) the amount of the \ncontract awarded, (v) the list of goods and/or services purchased, and (vi) the intended and \nactual utilization of loan proceeds under each contract.

Transport Sector \n1.  The transport sector in Viet Nam consists of road; railway; inland water; international sea \ntraffic through the ports of Ha Long, Hai Phong, Da Nang, and Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC); and \ndomestic and international air traffic centered in Hanoi and HCMC. The transport infrastructure \nsuffered severe destruction and degradation during more than three decades of war and its \nrehabilitation has been a primary goal of the Government. The Government\u2019s efforts are focused \non (i) reconstruction of the road network, (ii) rehabilitation and upgrading of the railway system, \ntogether with reforms to improve efficiency and sustainability of operations, (iii) modernization \nand upgrading of international airports, and (iv) rehabilitation and modernization of the ports.  \n2.  The Government of Viet Nam made investment in transport infrastructure a key priority \nin its 2001\u20132005 public investment program (PIP). This emphasis has been continued in the \ncurrent PIP. Nationwide, freight and passenger demand measured in ton-km and passenger-km \ngrew by 10% a year over the same period. While road remains the dominant mode of freight \ntransport,  accounting  for  65%  of  tons  moved,  rail  plays  an  increasingly  significant  role, \nparticularly in the transport of bulk cargo over long distances. \nB.  Development of the Railway  \n3.  Because of Viet Nam\u2019s topography and long distances, the railway plays an important \nrole in providing economic, reliable and safe services for the transportation of people and goods. \nThe railway is 2,600 kilometers (km) long and was mainly constructed in the early part of the \n20th century using the French meter gauge ([MG] 1.0 meter [m]) railway. The first railway line in \nViet Nam was built in 1881\u20131885 linking HCMC and My Tho town, a distance of 70 km. \nConstruction of the longest railway line linking HCMC and Hanoi, a distance of 1,726 km, was \ncompleted over a period of 4 decades from 1899 to 1936.1 \n4.  The Vietnamese railway network links the main population, cultural, agricultural, and \nindustrial centers. It connects with the PRC standard gauge railway network at Lang Son in the \nnorth-east and with the PRC MG network in the land-locked province of Yunnan at Lao Cai. The \nrailway in Viet Nam forms a strategic link in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Transport \nSector  Strategy\u2019s  southern  and  north  south  corridors,2 which  connects  Malaysia,  Thailand, \nCambodia, and Viet Nam with the southern PRC. It is part of a plan to connect Singapore to \nKunming by rail, which is a long-term development priority for the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN). \n5.  During  the  Second  World  War,  the  rail  system  in  Viet  Nam  suffered  considerable \ndamage, including destruction of bridges. Following the partition of Viet Nam in 1954, the \nrailway system was also split. During the war in the 1960s and early 1970s, the railway system \nwas again targeted. Unification of the country in 1975 saw the re-emergence of a unified railway \nsystem, much of which was badly damaged or inoperative. \nC.  Railway Infrastructure \n6.  The Vietnamese railway network has track gauges of 1.000 m (MG), 1.435 m (SG) and \ndual gauge (1.000 m and 1.435 m). The major routes are listed in Table A2.1. \n                                                 \n1  Construction of the HCMC to Hanoi railway line began in 1899 in three sections: Hanoi to Vinh, Dong Ha to \nDanang and Nha Trang to HCMC. The remaining two sections, Vinh to Dong Ha and Danang to Nha Trang were \nstarted in 1914 but the construction works were postponed until 1921 because of the First World War. The section \nfrom Vinh to Dong Ha was completed in 1927, and the last section from Danang to Nha Trang in 1936 \n2  ADB. 2006. GMS Transport Sector Strategy Study, Final Report. Manila.

The main lines have a maximum speed of 70 km/hour. The track structure is generally \n43 kg/m rails, and rails lighter than 38 kg/m section are still in use on about 10% of the main \nlines. The rails are laid on two-block concrete, wooden and steel sleepers with up to 300 mm of \nballast, using predominantly rigid fastenings. Elastic fastenings are used on selected sections.  \nMany bridges in the network were damaged during the war and have safety problems requiring \ntrains to slow to 30 km/hour, and even 5 km/hour. Some railway tunnels let in water because of \ninadequate drainage and unstable tunnel lining and as a result trains have to reduce speeds as \nlow as 15 km/hour. \n8.  Overall, the physical condition of the railway infrastructure varies from poor to less than \nsatisfactory. Much of the network needs to be rehabilitated and upgraded to meet the demand \nfor rail transport efficiently and cost-effectively.  \nD.  Railway Organization  \n9.  After unification in 1975, the railway network was centrally managed and operated by the \nGovernment\u2019s General Department of Railways. Railway production targets were set by the \nstate. Low tariffs and the underdevelopment of other modes of transport led to large numbers of \npassengers. However, since railway revenue was insufficient to cover operating costs, the larger \nthe volume of goods and passengers transported by rail the more money the railway lost. \nRailway subsidies became a huge burden on the state budget. \n10.  In 1986, the Government implemented its doi moi policy to change the centrally-planned \nand  subsidized  economy  into  a  market-led  economy  with  a  socialist  orientation  and  state \nregulation. One of the major policy objectives was to deregulate transport and restructure state-\nsubsidized transport into independent, self-sustaining, and market-led entities without a need for \ngovernment support. In the ensuing deregulated transport environment, the railway faced stiff \ncompetition from other modes of transport, particularly road transport. \n11.  In 1989, the General Department of Railways was reorganized into Duong Sat Viet Nam \n(Viet Nam Railways), a state-owned enterprise with a mandate to perform competitively in a \nmarket environment. Subsidies were to be gradually reduced. However, a rapid deterioration of \nthe railway's finances in the 1990s drastically reduced the potential for profitable operations. \nThe Government began a number of studies to reorganize the railway with the objective of \nreducing the burden on the state budget and improving the quality of services. \nE.  Reforms in the Railway Sector \n12.  The problems in the railway subsector arise from its history of central ownership. In the \npast, economic efficiency and sustainability of operations were not priorities. The railway was \ninvested in and subsidized by the state. No efforts were made to upgrade the facilities to \nimprove the quality of services to meet customer demands and as a result the overall level of \nrailway transport technology, equipment, and system capacity cannot meet the demands of a \n ", "Appendix 2  25 \nmarket economy. This underscores the need for urgent railway reform.  \n13.  Since the 1990s the Government has taken various initiatives to reform the railways and \nin 1994 rail infrastructure was separated from operations.3 Since 1 January 1995, infrastructure \nmanagement and operations have had separate financial accounts. Funding for infrastructure \nmaintenance and renewals as well as investments was to be the Government\u2019s responsibility.  \nViet Nam Railways was to manage the infrastructure, meet the cost of its operations, and pay \nan infrastructure use charge to the Government. Acquisition of locomotives and rolling stock as \nwell as their maintenance was the responsibility of Viet Nam Railways. At the same time the \nrailway system was reorganized into four functional groups under the management of Viet Nam \nRailways. \n(i)  Transport Group is responsible for managing and providing rail services in the \nrespective  regions  and  coordinating  with  the  other  regional  rail  transport \nenterprises.4 This group is accounting for as one entity.  \n(ii)  Industry and Construction Group is responsible for rolling stock production units \nand  workshops,  stone  quarries  and  railway  construction  companies  and \nenterprises.  These  are  all  independent  entities,  conducting  their  businesses \naccording to the State Enterprise Law.  \n(iii)  Infrastructure Management Group is responsible for infrastructure management \nfor bridges, track, telecommunications and signaling, and stations. These are all \npublic utility enterprises funded by the state.  \n(iv)  Rail-Related Services Group is responsible for railway material and equipment \nimport\u2013export, consulting, tourism, and transport services enterprises. \n \n14.  The VNR headquarters, located in Ha Noi, supervises rail operations and the business \nactivities of the three enterprises in the transport group. It is financially separated from the other \ngroups.  All  services  and  goods  supplied  by  the  other  groups  to  the  transport  group  are \ntransacted on the basis of commercial contracts. \n15.  Since 2000, at the request of the Government, the German Government has been \nproviding assistance for railway reforms.5 The objective of these efforts has been to: (i) make \nrailway operations more market-oriented and competitive; (ii) support an internal reorganization \nof the railway subsector to make operations more efficient and effective; and (iii) set up a legal \nframework for a liberalized railway market, allowing third party participation in railway activities. \nAs a result of these efforts, in March 2003,6 the Vietnam Railways (VNR) was established as a \nstate corporation operating in railway transport and related services based on the following \ndivision of responsibilities: \n(i)  business activities of VNR were separated from state management of railways, \nwhich were assigned to the Viet Nam Railway Administration under the Ministry \nof Transport;7 and \n(ii)  the freight and passenger businesses of VNR were separated in July 2003 into \none nationwide freight company and two passenger companies, each with its \n                                                 \n3   Prime Minister\u2019s Dispatch No. 46/VPCP dated 26 March 1994 \n4  The  three  regional  rail  transport  enterprises  that  comprise  the  Transport  Group  are:  (i)  Railway  Transport \nEnterprise No. 1 (Union 1) that manages and operates on the northern part of the network from the border with \nChina to Dong Hoi; (ii) Railway Transport Enterprise No. 2 (Union 2) that operates on the central part of the railway \nnetwork from Dong Hoi to Dieu Tri; and (iii) Railway Transport Enterprise No. 3 (Union 3) that operates the \nsouthern part of the network from Dieu Tri to HCMC. \n5  This support was channeled through Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) of Germany. \n6  Prime Minister\u2019s Decision 34/2003/QD-TTg issued on 4 March 2003. \n7  Government Decree 34/2003/ND-CP dated 4 April 2003. \n ", " 26  Appendix 2 \nown  marketing  structure  and  being  assisted  by  GTZ  to  further  improve  its \norganizational structure and operating mechanisms. \n16.  New Railway Law. The German Government supported the new Railway Law that was \npassed by the Government in May 2005. The Railway Law8 took effect on 1 January 2006 and \nprovides a legal framework for investment and rules on railway safety. It contains provisions \ndesigned  to  attract  private  investment  in  railway  infrastructure  and  transportation  services, \nsimilar to those in market economies. Although it was anticipated that the law would encourage \ndomestic and foreign investment in the railway sector, none has been forthcoming,9 perhaps \nbecause regulations for implementing the law have not yet been issued.  \nF.  Outlook for Future Railway Reform \n17.  Railway transport is an economic necessity if Viet Nam is to meet the demand for \nmedium- to long-distance transport of goods and people. Because of environmental concerns \nassociated with road transport as well as the rising oil prices, it is imperative that the country\u2019s \nrailway system provides services to meet demand efficiently and cost-effectively. Given the \nphysical condition of the railway infrastructure, this will require large investments from more than \none source. A multi-pronged effort is necessary, including from multilateral financing institutions \nthat  can  provide  competitively-priced  financing  for  railway  development  in  poor  areas. \nConditions will need to be made attractive for private sector investment, with risks that compare \nfavorably with those in other sectors. A start has been made with the promulgation of the \nRailway Law, but this will not be enough.  \n18.  Another significant development in the near future will arise from Viet Nam\u2019s accession \nto the World Trade Organization. This will create a more enabling environment whereby foreign \ninvestors in the railway subsector will be treated in the same way as domestic investors. VNR \nwill  need  to  compete  effectively  in  such  an  environment  if  it  is  to  improve  its  financial \nperformance.  \n19.  Areas in which future urgent reforms are needed include the following. \n(i)  The regulations for implementing the Railway Law should be made more specific. \nA one-stop service should be provided to private sector investors, domestic and \nforeign.  The  implication  that  the  law  will  be  valid  for  10  years  will  limit  its \neffectiveness as railway projects generally last longer than this. The future status \nof the law will need to be clarified for the benefit of investors. \n(ii)  Considering the poor state of existing infrastructure and the large number of \npublic service obligation services, it is likely that VNR will still require financial \nsupport from the state for some time to come, as in other countries (e.g., in \nFrance, Germany, and Japan railway companies have access to preferential \nfinancing to purchase rolling stock and develop infrastructure). The government \nshould diversify sources for funding railway infrastructure by (a) permitting local \ngovernments to invest in building their own rail routes to foster economic growth \nin poor areas, and (b) issuing government bonds to attract funds for railway \ninfrastructure development.  \n(iii)  Under the existing arrangement, VNR operates on state-funded rail infrastructure \nand pays a charge for infrastructure use at the rate of 10% of revenue. However, \nthis user charge is not sufficient to cover the cost of infrastructure operation. \n                                                 \n8  Law No. 35/2005/QH11. \n9  Dao Dinh Binh, Minister of Transport and Communications, at the Seventh Session of the 11th National Assembly \non 11 May 2005. \n ", "Appendix 2  27 \nFinancial sustainability will be assured only if the cost of operation is recovered \nthrough an appropriate charge.  \n(iv)  The  railway  will  need  to  introduce  a  traffic  costing  model  to  calculate  the \neconomic efficiency of passenger business and freight business separately, by \nroute and by specific commodities. The commercial viability of each route and \nspecific  service  should  be  defined  and  operating  expenses  monitored  and \ncontrolled. A flexible tariff structure will need to be based on the principle of full \ncost-recovery  (including  depreciation  and  a  reasonable  rate  of  return  on \ninvestment). A cost accounting system for each business operation should be \nestablished. In the past, rail operations have not been costed separately for \npassenger and freight businesses or by line and/or by specific commodities, so \nthere has been no sound basis for the economic analysis of operations. \n20.  Germany is continuing to assist the Government and VNR in railway sector reforms by \n(i) preparing  regulations  to  implement  the  provisions  of  the  Railway  Law;  (ii)  preparing  a \nproposal for a reorganization of the railway; (iii) establishing a basis for determining charges for \nthe use of state-financed railway infrastructure, and a procedure for its collection; (iv) preparing \nregulations for evaluation, publication, and marking of land required for planned infrastructure \nfor a state railway and urban railway network; (v) formulating health standards for train staff; (vi) \ndrafting  regulations  for  the  examination,  issuance,  renewal  and  withdrawal  of  train  driving \nlicenses; (vii) drafting regulations for licensing construction works and other activities within \nrailway  works  protection  areas;  and  (viii)  preparing  regulations  for  the  issuance  of  safety \ncertificates to enterprises. \n21.  The Project will address the important issue of the financial sustainability of the operation \nof infrastructure and transportation services. The Government has committed to imposing an \nappropriate infrastructure use charge on VNR and other users of the tracks. The charge should \nbe sufficient to cover costs, including the debt service requirements arising from the Project. \nFrom fiscal year 2007, VNR will be required to produce total revenues equivalent to, or not less \nthan, the sum of its total operating expenses, including such user charges as are determined \nappropriate by the Government. \n22.  In association with the Project, technical assistance will be provided for the introduction \nof enhanced financial management accounting policies, procedures and internal controls, and \nalso to establish revenue and cost-centre reporting systems. The outcome of the technical \nassistance will be an improved system of financial management accounts and internal control \ndesigned in accordance with international good-practice standards of financial reporting and \ncontrol appropriate for a railway operating in a market economy. The enhanced system will \nprovide reliable cost and revenue management information for timely decision-making. \n23.  Efforts in this direction will need to be continued by the Government and VNR, with \npossible assistance from bilateral and multilateral sources.  \n ", "28  Appendix 3 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE RAILWAY SUBSECTOR \nProject  Donor  Status  Duration \n       \nGMS: Hanoi\u2013Lao Cai Railway  ADB  Preparation stage  2006\u20132010 \nHo Chi Minh City Metro Rail  ADB  Preparation stage  Approval firm 2008 \nRural Transport \u2013 Pilot Budget  DFID  Ongoing  2005-2006 \nSupport to Phu Tho and Lao Cai \nFeasibility Study of Tramway Line  France  Completed  2004 \non Road 32  (MOF) \nHanoi Pilot Metro Line  France  Ongoing  2006\u20132010 \n(FFEM; \nAFD/MOF) \nModernization of Signaling in  PRC  Ongoing  2006-2008 \nNorthern Viet Nam \nModernization of signaling and  France  Ongoing  2006\u20132009 \ntelecommunications system of  (MOF) \nHanoi-Vinh Railway \nMechanization of track  France  Ongoing  2006\u20132009 \nmaintenance of Hanoi-Vinh Railway (MOF) \nViet Nam Railways Project  GTZ  Ongoing  2001\u2013006 \nHai Van Tunnel Construction  JBIC  Ongoing  2001\u2013009 \nProject \nHanoi\u2013Ho Chi Minh City Railways  JBIC  Completed  1994-2005 \nBridge Rehabilitation Project \nHanoi\u2013Ho Chi Minh City Railway  JBIC  Ongoing  2004\u20132009 \nLine Bridges Safety Improvement \nProject \nHCMC Urban Metro Railway  JBIC  Under preparation  2006\u20132010 \nProject \nRehabilitation of 15 Main-Line  KfW  Completed  1996\u20132000 \nLocomotives \nFeasibility Study on Urban Railway  KfW  Completed  1999\u20132000 \nSystem of Hanoi \nSupply of Modern Railway Cranes  KfW  Ongoing  2000\u20132003 \nMain Line Locomotives  KfW  Ongoing  2001\u20132007 \nViet Nam Railway Control Center  KfW  Under preparation   \nMultimodal Transport Regulatory  WB  Draft final report  2005\u20132006 \nReview \nADB = Asian Development Bank, AFD = Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, DFID = Department for International \nDevelopment, FFEM = Fonds Fran\u00e7aise pour l\u2019Environnement Mondial, GTZ = Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische \nZusammenarbeit, HCMC = Ho Chi Minh City, JBIC = Japan Bank for International Cooperation, KfW = Kreditanstalt \nf\u00fcr Wiederaufbau, MOF = Government of France Ministry of Finance, WB = World Bank. \n \n ", "Appendix 4  29 \nPROPOSED AGENCE FRAN\u00c7AISE DE D\u00c9VELOPPEMENT GRANT FINANCING FOR \nIMPROVED FACILITATION OF TRANSIT TRAFFIC AT THE LAO CAI BORDER CROSSING \nTERMS OF REFERENCE \n \nA.

The Project includes phased assistance \nfor the establishment and implementation of a computerized management accounting system. \nThe Project also contributes to subregional integration. In addition, however, it is proposed that \nthe question of railway traffic passing through the Lao Cai/Hekou border stations be further \nstudied, specifically in the context of forecasts of growing traffic between the two countries, \ncurrent traffic disruptions (which result in long waiting times and therefore higher costs), and \nexisting processes and customs agreements at the border. A conference in July 2006 in Hanoi \nattended  by  PRC  and  Vietnamese  authorities  and  operators  confirmed  the  importance  of \nstreamlining traffic and facilitating exchanges between Viet Nam and the PRC to increase trade \nand economic growth. \n5.  AFD proposes to finance this study on a grant basis. It is both a part of the railway line \nupgrading as a whole, and complementary to the upgrading works at Lao Cai station. This study \nis consistent with the Programme de Renforcement des Capacit\u00e9s Commerciales financed by \nthe French Ministry of Economy and Finance and co-managed by the latter and AFD. \nB.   Scope and Objective \n6.  The proposed study is aimed at providing Vietnamese authorities, as well as their PRC \ncounterparts, with the means and information necessary to make rational decisions on how to \noptimize the transport of goods by rail between the two countries. The study will address the \nsituation at Lao Cai/Hekou border crossing, but the lessons may be adapted for use on the \nother Viet Nam\u2013PRC rail border at Huu Nghi. The findings of the study will also contribute to \nfuture bilateral exchanges between the PRC and Viet Nam on rail policies. \n7.  The study aims to identify bottlenecks and recommend mitigation measures. It will have \ntwo phases. In phase 1, the existing situation at Lao Cai/Hekou border crossing will be reviewed ", "30  Appendix 4 \nand  the  causes  of  delays  exposed,  including  the  main  disruptions  to  unloading,  physical, \nadministrative and institutional processes, and constraints. In phase 2, proposals will be made. \nC.  Tasks \n1.  Phase 1: Review \n8.  The review will take place on both sides of the border. It will:  \n(i)  describe the traffic conditions and disruptions currently experienced at the border \ncrossing, especially for railway traffic but for road traffic as well, by reviewing \npassenger traffic and handling of freight with particular focus on container traffic \nand break-bulk commodities; \n(ii)  quantify the consequences of these constraints, in terms of time losses and \nrelated costs; \n(iii)  review and analyse the existing agreements, regulations, documents necessary \nfor exchanges at the border, including the 1992 Agreement and further protocols, \nlaws or rules relating to working-rights in both countries, with a view to identifying \ntheir (a) status, (b) level (national, local), (c) dates of enforcement and expiration \n(d) subject matter (e.g., trade, transport, and working rights for drivers), and (e) in \nrelation to transport regulations, describe document requirements and current \ncontrols on import and export of goods; \n(iv)  identify  the  main  causes  of  traffic  disruption  for  major  transported  items, \nincluding:  (a)  physical  causes,  such  as  the  existence  of  several  points  for \ncustoms and unloading of freight (consideration will be given to the construction \nof a container yard 1 km south of the current Lao Cai station) and (b) institutional \nand administrative causes, such as border crossing formalities and inspections \nfor  freight  and  passengers,  restrictions  on  entry  of  transport  units,  technical \nstandards for vehicles; \n(v)  identify ongoing processes to facilitate transit at the border, including the GMS \nCross-Border Transport Agreement dealing with road traffic; and \n(vi)  identify any other contributing problems. \n2.  Phase 2: Recommendations and Proposals \n9.  Phase 2 will: \n(i)  propose appropriate measures to facilitate trade, including (a) institutional and \nadministrative  measures,  (b)  physical  measures,  including  communications \nsystems (the consultant will work on a preliminary design basis, which will be \nexpanded  by  consultants  recruited  for  detailed  engineering  design  and \nsupervision  of  the  implementation  of  the  loan  project);  and  (c) improving \ntranshipment from road to rail at the border, identifying issues related to the \nupgrading to standard gauge in the PRC, and investigating the focus of freight \nhandling,  including  the  possibility  of  private  sector  involvement  in  container \nhandling and container stuffing at Lao Cai; \n(ii)  for each of the above items, describe: (a) how it will be implemented; (b) specific \nactions required and milestones; and (c) the consequences for each country, and \nthe combined effect; \n(iii)  propose several scenarios,  each combining one or more of the measures in (i); \nand  \n(iv)  for  the  approved  scenario  (the  approval  process  is  still  to  be  determined), \npropose ways and schedules for implementation. \n ", "Appendix 4  31 \nD.   Personnel Requirements \n10.  A  consultant,  preferably  with  experience  in  transport,  trade  facilitation,  international \ncustoms, and cross-border agreements, will be recruited.

Introduction \n1.  The Upgrade of the Railway Line between Yen Vien and Lao Cai Project will provide the \nphysical framework required to meet rapidly growing demand for railway transport in north western \nViet Nam and between Kunming in PRC and Hanoi and Haiphong in Vietnam. During project \npreparation, the Government requested and ADB and AFD have agreed to provide associated \nadvisory technical assistance to optimize the economic benefits and the financial returns from the \nProject. Two technical assistance projects were identified during the course of project preparation: \n(i) the  Financial  Management  Governance  Reform  Program  for  Vietnam  Railways,  which  will \nmodernize and transform the financial management system in Viet Nam Railways into a system that \nis suitable for commercial, market based railway operation as envisaged under the new Railway \nLaw; and (ii) Improved Facilitation of Transit Traffic at the Lao Cai Border Crossing which will \nrecommend on improvements in cross border traffic arrangements that would help to maximize the \nbenefits enjoyed by Viet Nam and PRC from cross border railway transport. \n2.  Following the passing of the Railway Law and the reorganization of Vietnam Railways (VNR) \ninto an infrastructure company and various operating companies, there is a need for stronger \nfinancial  management  accounting  policies,  procedures  and  internal  controls,  in  an \nautomated/computerized  environment.  The  enhanced  system  should  provide  reliable  cost  and \nrevenue management information for timely decision making and to safeguard the assets of the \nholding  company  and  its  operating  companies.  The  availability  of  information  on  the  financial \nposition and operating profitability of VNR and its companies will enable VNR to compete more \neffectively in a market-oriented transport environment. The goal of the reforms is the establishment \nof a reliable automated financial management system. The Financial Governance Reform Program \nfor the Viet Nam Railway Sector will take 5 years. Phase 1, implementing a system of accounts in \naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles and in a semi-automated finance and \nmanagerial  accounting  system,  may  be  achievable  within  the  first  2  years.  Phase  2,  full \nimplementation of the enhanced system, including seamless automation of financial management \ndatabases with real-time data links between all organizational units of the VNR, will be a medium- to \nlong-term goal.  \nB.   Reforms \u2013 Phase 1 \n  1.  Scope and Outcomes  \n4.  Phase 1 will focus on the first 2 years of the Program. The components will include (i) an \nanalysis of the present financial management and control organization and its system of accounts; \n(ii)  design  of  an  enhanced  financial  management  system  in  a  semi-automated  environment \ncongruent to the organizational structure of the VNR; (iii) implementation on a pilot basis of the \nproposed system; and (iv) training. The outputs of component (i) will include a road map for the \nProgram, including recommendations on (i) organizational structure (including internal audit), and (ii) \nhuman resource competencies and skills required within the financial accounting and internal audit \nand control units of the VNR. Components (ii) and (iii) will support VNR staff through the pilot \nimplementation of the enhanced financial and managerial accounting system. They will include a re-\nevaluation of the assets and liabilities of the companies, including a revaluation of fixed assets and \ninventories, and a review of the contingent accounts, if any. Component (iv) training will be an \nunderlying capacity building program of the TA. \n5.  The TA outcome will be an improved system of financial management accounts and internal \ncontrol designed in accordance with international good practice standards of financial reporting and \ncontrol as appropriate for a railway operating in a market-oriented economy, implemented on a pilot \nbasis. It is expected that Phase 1 will cost an estimated $600,000 and will be implemented over a \nperiod of 18 months. Consultancy services will be provided by a firm (preferably an association \nbetween an international accounting and auditing firm and a Vietnamese accounting and auditing \nfirm). It will require 15 person-months of international consultants and 36 person-months of national \nspecialists.  \n ", "Appendix 5  33 \n2.  Terms of Reference of the Consulting Firm \n7.

The Proposed Project \n1.  The proposed Project would rehabilitate an existing 285 kilometers (km) railway line \nbetween Yen Vien station near Hanoi and Lao Cai station on the border with the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (the PRC), and upgrade its capacity to meet forecast demand for railway \ntraffic until year 2020. The line is single track meter gauge. In Yen Vien, the railway line \nconnects with the main north\u2013south railway line between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), \nand with the railway line to Hai Phong port. From Lao Cai the line continues across the border to \nHekou and from there to Kunming in Yunnan province in the PRC where it connects with the \nmain railway network in the PRC. Signaling and traffic control on the Project railway line is being \nupgraded under a project funded by the PRC. The signaling project and ADB\u2019s proposed \ncapacity upgrade project would be coordinated by Viet Nam Railways Administration (VNRA), \nthe owner of the project railway line. In the PRC, a new toll expressway between Kunming and \nHekou  is  under  construction  and  expected  to  be  completed  by  2010.  A  proposed  project \nfinanced by ADB and others may construct a toll highway between Hanoi and Lao Cai, where it \nwould connect with the expressway in the PRC. The proposed new highway would run parallel \nto the project railway line. The economic analysis assumes that the highway between Hanoi and \nLao Cai is completed in 2015. \nB.  Cost Benefit Analysis \n2.  The cost benefit analysis estimates the incremental costs and benefits to shippers, \npassengers, and the railway itself by comparing with and without project scenarios. The analysis \nincludes quantifiable externalities. The analysis assumes that there are no capacity constraints \nat Yen Vien Station or on the railway lines beyond that station, especially the line to Hai Phong. \n3.  The \u201cwith project\u201d case assumes that implementation of the Project is completed by \n2011. It also assumes that trains will use high-horsepower locomotives. The locomotives are not \nincluded in the investment cost, since it is assumed they will be taken from a fleet of 36 high-\npower locomotives currently being acquired by VNR. The \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d project scenarios \nboth assume that the signals project funded by the PRC is in place. Hence, the cost of providing \nthe  signals  component  is  ignored  in  the  investment  budget  and  the  benefits  flowing  from \noperational  improvements  associated  with  the  signaling  project  are  included  in  forecast \noperational costs and benefits in the \u201cwithout\u201d Project calculation. \n4.  The analysis is based on costs and benefits calculated in fixed 2006 economic border \nprices and are expressed in terms of the proposed project\u2019s economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR). The forecast traffic and mode-dependent operating cost for the highway in Viet Nam, \nand the expressway and the railway in the PRC, are based on data and analysis provided in the \nPPTA consultant\u2019s report, which also provides data on recent and future train operations and \nthe operational costs and benefits of the railway line. Pertinent assumptions are tested by \nsensitivity analysis. The distributional impact of the proposed project is analyzed qualitatively. \nC.  Traffic Forecast \n5.  The project railway line is one of the busiest in Viet Nam and its importance is growing in \nstep with rapidly increasing trade between Viet Nam and the PRC. The line is also becoming a \nconduit for containers to and from Yunnan province via Hai Phong port. The port in Hai Phong is \nattractive for container traffic to and from Yunnan province because it is the largest container \nport in northern Viet Nam and the southern PRC and is also the nearest port to Kunming. Hai \nPhong is 850 km from Kunming while the nearest container port in the PRC, Fangcheng port, is \nabout 1,100 km away. Hong Kong is more than 2,000 km from Kunming. \n ", "42  Appendix 9 \n6.  Currently the project railway line carries about 2 million tons of freight and more than 2 \nmillion passengers annually on its busiest sections, which is close to capacity. It is forecast that \ndemand for railway traffic will double in the next 10 years. Without an upgrade, there will be \nserious congestion by 2010 at the latest. Forecast demand for railway traffic with and without \nthe proposed Project is summarized in Table A9.1. Realized traffic would, however, be lower \nbecause of capacity constraints. In the without project case the existing railway would be \nincapable of meeting demand in full after 2010 at the latest. In the with project case capacity \nwould be adequate until year 2020. \n7.  The Ministry of Railways (MOR) in the PRC is constructing a new standard gauge \nrailway between Kunming and Mengzi, which is a station on the existing railway line between \nKunming and the border with Viet Nam at Lao Cai/Hekou. MOR plans to carry out a feasibility \nstudy for the continuation of the new standard gauge line from Mengzi to Hekou. If constructed, \nthe new standard gauge line would upgrade railway services between the PRC and Viet Nam \nsignificantly, but it would also introduce a break-of-gauge at the border, where railway traffic \nbetween Kunming and Viet Nam would require reloading or reaxling. The traffic study has \nanalyzed this prospect and found that the improvements to the railway services in the PRC \nwould more than offset the impediments to traffic from the break-of-gauge at the border. The net \nresult is that cross-border railway traffic would increase significantly. The impact on the Project \nof upgrading the railway between Hekou and Kunming is reviewed in the cost\u2013benefit analysis. \nTwo  cases  are  evaluated:  with  and  without  upgrade  of  the  railway  in  the  PRC.  Project \nevaluation is based on combining these two results to estimate the expected mean level of net \nbenefits under the assumption that there is 50% probability that the new line to Hekou will be \nconstructed. \nTable A9.1: Forecast Demand for Railway Traffic between Yen Vien and Lao Cai \nDevelopment Alternative and Traffic  2005  2010  2015  2020  2025  2030 \nWithout  Passengers (million passengers)  1.4  1.8  2.3 2.9  3.7 4.6\nupgrade \nin the  Freight (tons)  2.1  3.8  5.4 7.6  8.5 9.5\nPRCa \nWith  Passengers (million passengers)  1.4  1.8  2.4 3.0  3.7 4.6\nupgrade  \nin the  Freight (tons)  2.1  3.8  9.0 12.8  14.3 15.9\nPRCb \na  Assumes construction of the new expressways in Viet Nam and the PRC. \nb  Assumes construction of the new expressways in Viet Nam and the PRC, upgrade of the railway in Viet Nam and \n50% probability that the railway in the PRC is upgraded. \nD.  Infrastructure Costs \n8.  The proposed railway project would rehabilitate and increase the capacity of the existing \nrailway line, improve safety at busy road crossings, and secure the railway line in areas prone to \nlandslides and river erosion. The main components of the project are (i) improving the track to \nenable operation of high horsepower locomotives, reducing future maintenance costs, and \nreducing track-related irregularity; (ii) rehabilitating or replacing bridges to enable operation of \nhigh horsepower locomotives; (iii) extending stations by lengthening existing crossing loops and \nproviding additional crossing loops and stacking capacity; and (iv) improving safety at level road \ncrossings.

Benefits and Operational Costs \n9.  Project benefits consist of saved cost for passengers, shippers and the railway, benefits \nfrom generated railway traffic benefits from avoiding forced diversion of freight traffic from rail to \nmore expensive road transport because of capacity constraints on the railway line, and benefits \nfrom the reduced cost of maintaining the track and rolling stock as a result of replacing worn \ndown rails with new high-tensile rails. Mode dependent user costs for passengers and freight \ntraffic were obtained from the PPTA consultant\u2019s report, which provides economic (border price) \nlong-term marginal vehicle- and train-operating costs by traffic type.

Results \n10.  The  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  assumes  that  (i) the  toll  highway  is  constructed,  (ii) the \nsignaling project financed by the PRC is in place, and (iii) sufficient numbers of high-horsepower \nlocomotives are available when needed. The upgrade of the railway line between Mengzhi in \nthe PRC and the border was uncertain at the time of writing. Disregarding the upgrade to reach \n ", "44  Appendix 9 \nthe border generates an economic internal rate (EIRR) for the Project of 15.7%. If, on the other \nhand, it is assumed that the line is upgraded at the earliest possible time and opens for traffic in \n2012, the EIRR is 16.6%. The mean expected value of the Project\u2019s net benefits is estimated at \n16.1%.

The Project\u2019s sensitivity to risks and changes in assumptions was tested by modifying \nthe following variables (i) delay in completion of civil works by 1 or 3 years, (ii) investment costs \nincreased by 15%, (iii) benefits reduced by 15%, (iv)  world oil prices reduced by 33%\u2014to the \nlevels prevailing in the second half of 2004\u2014and early closure of the project railway line if a new \nrailway line south of the Red River replaces it in 2025, which is the earliest possible date. \nSwitching values, defined as the change required to bringing the EIRR of mean expected net \nbenefits to 12% have also been calculated. The sensitivity analysis shows that the delay in \nproject implementation would have little impact, reflecting the long-term nature of capacity- \nrelated benefits which are only fully realized when traffic approaches the new capacity limit. The \n ", "Appendix 9  45 \nswitching value for implementation delay is about 7 years. The project is moderately sensitive to \nincreased investment costs and reduced benefits. The switching values are a 52% increase in \ninvestment costs and a 34% decrease in benefits. Oil prices have been volatile in recent years \nand generally have a significant impact on transport costs. However, for this project the impact \nis minor: reducing oil prices by 33% to the levels prevailing in late 2004 reduces the mean EIRR \nto 14.6%. The switching value is a reduction by 81%, equivalent to the price prevailing in 1994-\n1995. Early closure of the railway line in 2025, which VNR considers the earliest time a new \nstandard gauge line between Yen Bien and Lao Cai can realistically be in operation, reduces \nthe  mean  EIRR  to  13.2%.  The  switching  value  is  closure  in  2023,  12  years  after  project \ncompletion. All sensitivity tests produce an EIRR in excess of 12%, irrespective of whether the \nrailway line in the PRC is replaced by a new standard gauge line to the border or not.

The project has been subjected to risk analysis involving all the variables tested in the \nsensitivity analysis. The risk analysis shows 89% probability that the project will achieve an \nEIRR of 12% or more. \nG.  Distributional Impact \n13.  The project will primarily enable increased railway freight traffic, which has little direct \nimpact on people living in the project area. There would be minor increases in effective travel \nspeeds and improved regularity of train operations, which would have a direct, positive impact \non train passenger and freight users. These improvement are, however, small and will not \nsignificantly affect train users. More broadly, improved and increased freight train operations \nreduces the general cost of freight transport, thereby enabling lower consumer prices and \nimproving  Viet  Nam\u2019s  international  competitiveness.  In  turn,  this  would  promote  economic \ngrowth that would create new jobs and income opportunities. The improved railway would \nincrease  the  attractiveness  of  locating  economic  activities  in  the  project  area  relative  to \nelsewhere,  which  in  time  would  generate  additional  economic  growth  and  additional  job \nopportunities in the project area. \n \n ", "46  Appendix 10 \nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, ANALYSIS, AND PROJECTIONS \n \nA.  Historical Financial Performance of Vietnam Railways (VNR) \n1.  Although audits were performed in 2004 by an independent audit firm, only 28 of 59 \nVietnam Railways (VNR) subsidiaries were audited. Included in the subsidiaries, which were not \naudited, are the 21 companies involved in infrastructure. The balance sheet shown in Table \nA10.1 thus gives a very general indication of the overall financial position of the VNR. Before \n2003, the railway was organized on a regional basis and no consolidated figures are available. \nThe 2005 audits are underway and are being performed by the State Audit Authority of Vietnam. \nAs indicated in the financial management assessment of VNR (Supplementary Appendix B), the \neffort to bring the accounting system to a level where meaningful information is produced will be \nconsiderable and will be well into the period of the Project. \n2.  The asset section of the balance sheet shows that VNR receives considerable subsidies \nto offset the tariffs presently in force. The amount of these subsidies was about $30 million at \nthe end of 2004. If VNR is to be run as a commercially-oriented enterprise, these subsidies will \nhave to be reduced and finally removed. \n3.  The  equity  section  shows  reserves  for  infrastructure  development  and  fixed  assets \nprocurement amounting to over $600 million, which represents funds received from government \nsources. These two items account for over 80% of VNR\u2019s equity, which shows that the railway is \nnot able to accumulate funds from its regular activities and will be dependent on government \nsupport for the foreseeable future.  \nTable A10.1 Balance Sheet \n($ millions) \nYear    2003  2004 \nAssets       \n  Current Assets       \n  Cash  23.6  33.8 \n  Accounts Receivable from Customers (Net)  45.7  43.9 \n  Receivables from Related Companies  75.4  116.4 \n  Inventory  38.8  38.8 \n  Administrative subsidies  31.0  29.7 \n  Other Assets  36.8  24.3 \n    Total Current Assets  251.2  286.9 \nFixed Assets (net)  794.3  823.3 \nLong-term Investments  2.4  3.6 \nTotal Assets  1,048.0  1,113.8 \n     \nLiabilities     \n  Current Liabilities     \n  Short-term loans  22.6  23.1 \n  Current portion of long-term loan  7.5  10.4 \n  Accounts payable  30.7  41.9 \n  Taxes and social payments  16.1  16.5 \n  Liabilities to related companies  73.9  112.5 \n  Other Liabilities  48.8  30.2 \n    Total Current Liabilities  199.6  234.5 \n  Long-term Liabilities     \n  Long-term loans  96.4  128.2 \n  Other long-term liabilities  1.0  0.7 \n    Total Long-term Liabilities  97.4  128.9 \nTotal Liabilities  297.1  363.4 \n     \n ", "Appendix 10  47 \nYear    2003  2004 \nEquity     \n  Capital  111.7  102.7 \n  Administrative costs subsidies  37.2  32.9 \n  Reserves for Infrastructure Development  182.6  219.3 \n  Reserves for Fixed Assets  413.3  391.3 \n  Reserves, Contingencies, and Others  6.2  3.1 \n  Minority shareholding  0  1.2 \n    Total Equity  751.0  750.4 \nTotal Liabilities and Equity  1,048.0  1,113.8 \nSource: TA Consultant\u2019s report. \nB.  Financial Analysis of the Project \n4.  As with the economic analysis, incremental revenue forecasts (in financial terms) were \nbased on traffic forecasts for freight after rehabilitation of the tracks. Incremental operating \nexpenses, net of incremental savings in maintenance of the rails and operational efficiencies of \nthe  rehabilitated  railways,  were  also  assumed  taking  into  consideration  similar  industry \nexperience in the railway sector. The Project is expected to be funded 22.5% from equity of the \nGovernment of Vietnam and the assumed opportunity cost of such equity financing is 9%. The \nindicative rate of the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) loan equivalent of up to \u20ac32 \nmillion is at 6 months euribor less 2.0%, with a maturity of 18 years inclusive of 6 years grace \nperiod.  The  Treasury  and  Economic  Policy  General  Directorate  of  the  French  Ministry  of \nFinance (DGTPE) loan, equivalent of up to \u20ac30 million, in the form of tied credits has an \nindicative rate of 1.25% per annum, a tenor of 20 years inclusive of a 5-year grace period. The \ninterest payments of both AFD and DGTPE loans are not capitalized during the grace period. \nThe weighted average cost of capital (WACC) in real terms is 0.54%. \n5.  Financial analysis, performed on an incremental basis in real terms and at 2006 prices, \nindicates that the project will be financially viable with a financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of \n3.0%, which is well over the real WACC of 0.54%. The estimated net present value (NPV) of the \nnet cash flows using the WACC as a hurdle rate is $56.1 million. Sensitivity analysis shows that \nthe Project remains robust when run on scenarios such as a 1-year delay in commencement of \noperations, a 15% increase in investment cost, and a 15% increase in operating costs. The \nFIRR  calculation  was  most  sensitive  to  a  15%  increase  in  operating  cost,  resulting  in  an \nestimated FIRR of 2.1%. Even if the above sensitivity scenarios were all combined, the project \nFIRR  is  at  0.8%,  remaining  above  the  project  WACC  of  0.54%.  These  FIRR  and  NPV \ncalculations (base case) are shown in Table A10.2, a summary of sensitivity scenario impacts \non the ratios in Table A10.3, and the WACC calculation in Supplementary Appendix C. \nC.  Financial Projections \n6.  Forecasted effects on accounts of the financial positions and operating results were \nprepared  in  current  terms,  on  an  incremental  project  basis.  The  loan  is  repaid  by  the \nGovernment and is not re-lent to the VNR. Investments in tracks are depreciated over 25 years \nand all other project capital investments over 50 years. Except for cash shortfall of $1.6 million \nin 2009 and $2.2 million in 2010 in the period prior to completion of rehabilitation in end 2010, \nthe  Project  is  generally  financially  sustainable,  with  sufficient  cashflows  for  debt  service \nrepayments.  The  forecasted  incremental  balance  sheet,  income  statement,  and  cashflow \nstatement are shown in Table A10.4. \n7.  A loan covenant has been included, requiring (i) the Government to implement track \nuser charges as appropriate to secure full cost recovery for the Government\u2019s debt service \nobligations, and (ii) VNR\u2019s total revenue to be at least equal to its total operating expenses, \nincluding the Government\u2019s appropriate track user charges. \n ", "48  Appendix 10 \nTable A10.2: Financial Internal Rate of Return and Net Present Value \n($ million) \nCapital  Net Cash \nYear  Expenditure  Operating Inflows  Flows \n2008  50.4  -  (50.4) \n2009  50.4  -  (50.4) \n2010  50.4  -  (50.4) \n2011    7.0  7.0 \n2012    7.4  7.4 \n2013    7.8  7.8 \n2014    8.0  8.0 \n2015    8.1  8.1 \n2016    8.8  8.8 \n2017    9.4  9.4 \n2018    9.9  9.9 \n2019    10.2  10.2 \n2020    10.4  10.4 \n2021    8.7  8.7 \n2022    7.5  7.5 \n2023    6.7  6.7 \n2024    6.3  6.3 \n2025    6.1  6.1 \n2026    6.2  6.2 \n2027    6.5  6.5 \n2028    6.9  6.9 \n2029    7.6  7.6 \n2030  (66.2)  8.3  74.4 \nNet Present Value (NPV) @ WACC 0.54%  56.1 \nFIRR      3.0% \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, WACC= \nweighted average cost of capital. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTable A10.3: Sensitivity Analysis: Financial Internal Rate of Return and  \nNet Present Values \n \nNPV @ WACC \nof 0.54%  FIRR \nScenario \n($ million)  (%) \n \nBase Case  56.1  3.0 \n1-year delay  48.4  2.7 \n15% increase in investment cost   39.5  2.1 \n15% increase in operating cost   39.9  2.2 \nCombined  5.2  0.8 \n             FIRR = financial internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, WACC = **Please define** \n           Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", " \nTable A10.4: Forecasted Incremental Balance, Income Statement and Cash Flows \n \nIncremental Balance Sheet                         \n(in $ million)  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015  2016  2017  2018 \nAssets                         \n  Cash   26.4  52.4  (1.6)  (2.2)  4.5  9.8  11.6  13.5  2.1  10.8  9.5  8.0 \n  Infrastructure Investments (net  53.3  106.7  160.0  160.0  155.5  150.9  146.4  141.9  137.3  132.8  128.2  123.7 \nof accumulated depreciation) \n  Total Assets  79.7  159.1  158.4  157.8  159.9  160.7  158.0  155.3  149.4  143.6  137.8  131.7 \n                           \nLiabilities                         \n  Long-Term Debt  58.9  138.0  138.6  139.2  139.8  138.2  133.4  128.6  120.8  112.9  104.9  96.8 \n \nCapital  20.9  21.1  19.8  18.6  20.1  22.5  24.6  26.7  28.6  30.7  32.9  34.9 \nTotal Liabilities and Capital  79.7  159.1  158.4  157.8  159.9  160.7  158.0  155.3  149.4  143.6  137.8  131.7 \n                           \nIncremental Income Statement                         \n(in $ million)  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015  2016  2017  2018 \n  Revenue          1.3  2.6  3.8  5.1  6.4  8.5  10.6  12.6 \n  Operating Costs                         \n      Costs (Savings)          (7.0)  (6.1)  (5.1)  (3.9)  (2.4)  (0.6)  1.5  3.9 \n      Depreciation          4.5  4.5  4.5  4.5  4.5  4.5  4.5  4.5 \n  Operating Profit Before Tax          3.7  4.1  4.4  4.5  4.3  4.6  4.5  4.2 \n  Interest Expense  0.5  1.4  1.7  1.7  1.7  1.7  1.7  1.6  1.9  1.7  1.6  1.5 \n  Profit Before Tax  (0.5)  (1.4)  (1.7)  (1.7)  2.0  2.4  2.7  2.9  2.5  2.8  2.9  2.7 \n  Income Tax  (0.1)  (0.3)  (0.4)  (0.4)  0.5  0.6  0.7  0.7  0.6  0.7  0.7  0.7 \n  Net Profit  (0.4)  (1.0)  (1.3)  (1.3)  1.5  1.8  2.0  2.1  1.8  2.1  2.2  2.0 \n                           \nIncremental Cashflows                         \n(in $ million)  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015  2016  2017  2018 \n  Cashflows from Operations  0.1  0.3  0.4  0.4  7.7  8.1  8.3  8.3  8.2  8.4  8.3  8.1  A\np\n  Cash (Outflows) for  (53.3)  (53.3)  (53.3)                    pe\nInvestment Activities  nd\n  Cash Inflows/(Outflows) from  79.58  79.05  (1.07)  (1.07)  (1.07)  (2.76)  (6.42)  (6.42)  (9.63)  (9.63)  (9.63)  (9.63)  ix\n 1\nFinancing Activities  0\n   NCaest hC hBaengginen iinn gC ash  26.308   2266.0.45   (535.928.4)   (0(1.6.65))   (62..628)   54.3.51   19.8.83   111.8.66   (11.430.5)   (11.224.1)   (11.209.8)   (1.597.5)   4     \n9\n  Cash Ending  26.4  52.4  (1.6)  (2.2)  4.5  9.8  11.6  13.5  12.1  10.8  9.5  8.0   \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "50  Appendix 11 \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \nA.  Introduction \n1.  This  summary  initial  environmental  examination  (SIEE)  is  based  on  the  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) for the GMS Kunming\u2013Hai Phong Transport Corridor: Hanoi\u2013\nLao  Cai  Railway  Upgrading  Project  proposed  by  Vietnam  Railways  (VNR).  The  IEE  was \nprepared based on the requirements of ADB\u2019s environmental assessment guidelines1 using (i) \ninputs derived from a prefeasibility study conducted in December 2003; (ii) discussions with \nrailway experts on the project team and at the Railway Project Management Unit (RPMU) of \nVNR;  (iii)  first-hand  observations  and  secondary  data  obtained  during  the  reconnaissance \nsurvey of areas on both sides of the alignment; and (iv) information gathered through interviews \nwith residents who may be affected as well as with local government officials and officers of \nrailway stations along the alignment. \nB.  Description of the Project \n2.  The project railway crosses about 285 kilometers (km) in a northwest direction from Yen \nVien near Hanoi, along the Red River to Lao Cai on the border with the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina  (PRC).  The  project  is  required  because  (i)  the  capacity  of  the  existing  railway \ninfrastructure from Lao Cai to Yen Vien is insufficient to meet increasing traffic demand to 2020 \nand (ii) existing train operations are not entirely safe, since the railway line was built at the \nbeginning of 20th century. The rail improvement will include, (i) selective improvement of the \nhorizontal and vertical alignment and track layout; (ii) stabilization of embankments and sliding \nslopes; (iii) rehabilitation of bridges; (iv) improvements to the track, including turnouts; (v) safety \nimprovements at selected level crossings; and (vi) upgrading of stations; and (vii) extension of \npassing loops for train loads up to 122 tons and train length of 400 meters (m). \nC.  Description of the Environment \n1.  Physical Environment \n3.  The study area is part of the northwest and northeast climate zones of Viet Nam. It has a \nmonsoon tropical climate, with an annual average temperature of 24oC, the hottest month being \nJune and the coldest being January. Average annual rainfall is 121 millimeter, the highest \nrainfall being in July and the lowest in October.  \n4.  The topography along the existing alignment varies considerably and includes broad flat \nplains from Hanoi to Viet Tri, narrow valleys in Vinh Phuc and Phu Tho provinces, denuded low \nmountains and hills near Yen Bai, loose masses, deeply incised slopes, eroded gullies, and high \nmountainous uplands between Yen Bai and Lao Cai. There are landslides, land slips, and \nabandoned  quarried  sites  in  all  the  mountainous  regions.  Thick  layers  of  sediments  have \naccumulated  along  the  Red  River  delta  between  Phu  Tho  and  Yen  Bai  provinces.  The \nmountainous regions between Yen Bai and Lao Cai exhibit underlying materials of limestone \nand mudstones. The alignment between Hanoi to Yen Bai is located in a low seismic zone. \n5.  Ground water resources along the alignment are limited, fairly dispersed, and marginally \nexploited. Water quality is reported to be good and generally within national standards, although \nthe mining areas between Yen Bai to Lao Cai have affect quality. Surface water along the \nalignment mainly consists of the Red River and its tributaries, many of which have seasonal \nflows. The Red River runs along the track and at times is within 10 m of the track, although the \nrailway never crosses the river. No stations along the alignment have wastewater treatment \nfacilities. Soil erosion is a major environmental issue, especially in the mountainous areas of \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila. \n ", "Appendix 11  51 \nYen Bai and Lao Cai provinces where there are steep slopes without any vegetation. These \nhave been repeatedly cut by railway construction earthworks and have become eroded. The \nslopes are unstable and there have been deep land slips and landslides at various places along \nthe alignment. In the plains between Hanoi and Yen Bai, soil erosion is moderate. \n6.  Air quality ranges from poor to moderate in industrial areas and urban locations near \nMau A, Van Phu and Viet Tri. It is generally good in rural and mountainous regions. Open yard \nstorage of coal, ores and ground limestone near stations has resulted in air pollution. Open \ntransportation of ores, cement and ground stone is a mobile source of air pollution. There are \nconsiderable baseline levels of noise and vibration caused by the movement of freight and \npassenger trains along the existing alignment. \n2.  Ecological Environment \n7.  Flora and fauna in the area are typical. There are no protected or endangered species \nreported in the study area. Recently established plantations of bamboo, lychee, eucalyptus, \nbanana, pear, and mango are found along slopes in the Yen Bai and Lao Cai regions. Some \ntrees of medium age were observed 10\u201320 m from the existing track and a few ancient trees are \nlocated 30-50 m from the track. There are no thick forests near the alignment. Terraced tea \ngardens and rice fields can be found in steep locations. No migrant wild fauna were reported. \nThere are no sensitive or protected areas within 5 km on either side of the alignment. Bao Ha \ntemple is within 600 m of Bao Ha station and Kings Hung temple complex is 2000 m from Tien \nKien station. These structures will not be affected by project activities.  \n3.  Socioeconomic Environment \n8.  There are dispersed, isolated, and self-contained habitations of ethnic minorities in the \nproject area. Most of the provinces, and especially Yen Bai, Lao Cai, and Phu Tho, are rich in \nmineral deposits, including iron, limestone, apatite, and coal. The well-known Sa Pa tourist \nlocation is about 35 km by road from Lao Cai. Because of the scenic nature and cool weather \nconditions during summer in the region, especially near Lao Cai, a few private tourist resorts are \nunder construction. \nD.

Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n9.  The Vietnam Railways (VNR) is the executing agency (EA) for the Project and through \nits Railway Project Management Unit (RPMU) it will have overall responsibility for ensuring that \nenvironmental standards and procedures are followed. The environmental management plan \n(EMP) prepared for the Project defines the potential impacts during various project phases, and \nprovides  appropriate  mitigation  measures  and  a  monitoring  framework.  Responsibilities  for \nimplementation of control measures are also specified in the EMP. The EA will establish an \nEnvironmental Protection and Management Division (EPMD) that will ensure the implementation \nof the environmental management and monitoring plan during the construction and operation \nphases of the Project. RPMU and EPMD will ensure that the contractors comply with the \nmitigating measures suggested during the construction and operation phases. The EPMD will \nbe especially responsible to ensure the implementation of recommended mitigation measures  \n10.  The EPMD will prepare a detailed environmental monitoring plan for the Project before \nbidding for construction contracts begins. The EMP will be included in all bidding documents \nand construction contracts. The EPMD will ensure that the environmental monitoring plan is \nupdated, as required, during project construction and operation. Environmental monitoring will \nbe  undertaken  by  a  range  of  authorities,  including  local  environmental  protection  bureaus \n(EPBs),  the  forestry  department,  and  relics  bureaus.  The  EPMD  will  be  responsible  for \ncoordinating all environmental monitoring activities, including collation of all monitoring results. \nAn environmental monitoring framework is included in the IEE. This covers monitoring of air \nquality, noise levels, water quality, and impacts on aquatic ecology, terrestrial flora and fauna, \nas well as disposal of excavation spoils. \nF.  Public Consultation \n11.  Public consultations were conducted in March and April 2006. Individual and group \ndiscussions were conducted in rural areas, especially with members of ethnic minority groups, \nand at urban sites along the proposed alignment. Discussions were conducted with officials of \nrailway stations and project management officials. The objective of the consultations was to \ndisseminate project information and gather views on probable environmental and social impacts \nof the Project. The participants expressed concerns about noise and vibration impacts, safety at \nlevel  crossings,  the  current  absence  of  proper  solid  waste  management  and  discharge  of \nuntreated wastewater at stations, and the compliance of contractors with mitigation measures.  \nThe consultants explained in detail the methods of mitigation and compliance monitoring. All the \nparticipants supported the proposed project and wanted its early implementation, which would \nbring socioeconomic development to the region. \nG.  Conclusion \n12.  Potential environmental impacts from the proposed project may arise from (i) earthwork \ndisposal,  (ii)  soil  erosion,  (iii)  site-specific  degradation  of  surface  water  quality,  (iv)  noise \npollution, and (v) vibration. Implementation of appropriate mitigation measures and monitoring \nduring  various  project  phases  will  reduce  these  negative  impacts  to  acceptable  levels.  In \nconclusion, the Project will have overall beneficial impacts in terms of safety, travel time, and \nsocioeconomic conditions along the project corridor. No additional impact assessment study is \nrequired for this project. \n \n ", "54  Appendix 12 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \nA.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam: \nViet Nam\u2019s economic growth has been remarkable. Rapid economic growth in economic output, business investment \nand private sector\u2014combined with Government\u2019s targeted poverty reduction interventions\u2014has resulted in sharp \ndecline in poverty. Poverty incidence fell from about 58% in 1993 to 24.1% in 2004. To sustain economic growth, \nattract private investment, and take full advantage of the benefits of regional and international integration, there is \nneed  to  accelerate  infrastructure  development.  Infrastructure  development  is  required  to  overcome  existing \nweaknesses and to respond to rapidly growing demand for new infrastructure. Rail is the second most important \ntransport mode and connects many cities, towns, industrial and residential areas. It carries substantial traffic, including \ntransit traffic between Hai Phong port and Yunnan province, bilateral trade between Viet Nam and China, and \ndomestic traffic. The goal of the Project is to: (i) facilitate regional trade and economic growth in northeastern Viet Nam \nand Yunnan province; (ii) facilitate access to and from Hai Phong port for Yunnan province, especially for containers; \n(iii) reduce transport costs; (iv) improve traffic safety; and (v) secure sufficient railway capacity to handle future traffic \ndemand.   \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General Intervention \nFollowing Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) enhanced poverty reduction strategy, projects classified as general \ninterventions no longer require poverty assessments. The resettlement plan will include a compensation plan and an \nincome improvement program for 591 households affected by land acquisition and relocation. Of the total affected \nhouseholds, 180 will be severely affected. Of those required to relocate, 74% are from Lao Cai station. The railway \npasses through 88 communes and 88 districts in the provinces of Lao Cai, Yen Bai, Vinh Phuc, Phu Tho and the city \nof Hanoi. The main population groups who will be affected are Kinh (i.e., ethnic Vietnamese). The Tay-Nung, Ray and \nHoa ethnic groups live near Lao Cai station. A total of 27 ethnic minority households are affected by the Project, \naccounting for 7% of the affected people, and in addition there are 5 ethnic minority host families in the resettlement \nsites. Of these 27 ethnic minority households, 23 are in Lao Cai area. Most (50%) are engaged in land-based \nactivities, i.e., agriculture and forestry. The rest are engaged in business and services, the civil service, industry and \nhandicrafts, casual labor, and factories. Many of the affected households are railway employees living on railway land \nnear Lao Cai station. Among the affected households, host communities in the proposed resettlement sites are mainly \nengaged in agriculture activities and wage work. The main types of land loss caused by the Project are agricultural, \nresidential, and common land; gardens or ponds; and forests. The affected land holdings are in both urban and rural \nareas. Most affected households already have, or are in the process of obtaining, a land use rights certificate for their \nresidential and agricultural land. Nearly all affected households have access to drinking water, primary schools, \nmedical clinics, hospitals, post offices, paved roads and provincial roads. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes    No \nDuring  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA),  meetings  were  held  with  various  stakeholders, \ngovernment officials, and affected communities (including relocated people and host communities). Consultations \nwere held with the affected households to discuss resettlement issues.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?    Yes    No \nA consultation workshop will be held with the affected households (e.g., railway employees and host communities), \nand government officials during implementation of resettlement plan. The workshop will discuss such issues as \ncompensation, relocation, and land acquisition.    \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe gender strategy covers households affected by resettlement. Most of the affected households are railway \nemployees living on railway land. Women from the affected households work as railway employees, small business \nand petty trading, wage work, and as agricultural workers. Women and girls make up 50% of the affected population. \nAbout 33% of affected households are headed by women. The average annual income of these households is 86% of \nhouseholds headed by men. Land use certificates were in the name of both men and women for only 5% of the \naffected households for residential land and 3% for agricultural land. The results of the first orientation meeting on \nresettlement shows that women, and especially those heading households, have specific risks from resettlement \nbecause of their lack of control over land and productive assets, and their lack of access to information.  \n ", "Appendix 12  55 \n \nTrafficking of girls may increase in the PRC border area once the railway line is improved and cross-border trade \nincreases. An HIV/AIDS awareness and human trafficking program will be developed and implemented during project \nimplementation. Construction contracts will include community-based prevention programs for workers. The Project \nincludes the following specific measures to address gender issues for the households affected by land acquisition and \nrelocation.  \n \nIn the railway settlement and in the affected communes and villages, and for host communities, separate consultation \nworkshops will be conducted on resettlement planning. These will cover resettlement sites, compensation, and \nimprovements to livelihood. The participants will include men and women from affected households, but specific \nemphasis will be placed on participation by women who head households and women from ethnic minorities. \n-  Men and women from the affected households will participate in the discussion on loss of inventory.  \n-  The district resettlement committees will include representatives of district Women\u2019s Unions. The commune \nresettlement committees will include representatives of commune Women\u2019s Unions and women from the \naffected households, including women who head households and women from ethnic minority groups.    \n-  At the inception phase, a workshop on resettlement will be conducted for the affected households (people \nbeing relocated and host communities). Emphasis will be given to include women who head households, \nethnic minority households, and women from host communities.  \n-  In addition, a capacity building training program will train district and commune resettlement committee \nmembers, representatives of the Women\u2019s Union and Youth Union and women from affected households, \nincluding women who head households and women from ethnic minorities. The objective of the training will \nbe to provide detailed information on resettlement activities, including proposed sites, entitlements, the \ncompensation plan, livelihood strategies for income improvement, and grievance procedures. \n-  In activities related to relocation, compensation, and livelihood improvement, special consideration will be \ngiven to poor households headed by women and ethnic minority households among people being relocated \nand host families.  \n-  A resettlement plan will include joint registration of land rights in the names of the husband and wife in \ninstances where land is acquired.  \n-  There is increased risk of HIV/AIDS to the communities in the Project sites because of the influx of \nconstruction workers. The HIV/AIDS and human trafficking awareness program will include women leaders \nand youth from the affected households and members of the Women\u2019s Union and Youth Union. The \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking programs will be coordinated with government programs and other existing \ninitiatives.   \n-   As per the Labor Code (as amended in 2002), all employment for the Project will respect Government \ncommitments to gender equity, including (i) deployment of women workers in construction works; (ii) ensuring \nthat children will not be used; and (iii) no differential wages paid to men and women work for equal value. \n-  Disaggregated monitoring indicators by gender and ethnic groups will be developed for the management \ninformation system. \n-  Gender sensitization training on gender and resettlement for relevant staff from the executing agency, district \nand commune resettlement committees, and the Women\u2019s Union.  \n-  A national social development and gender specialist will be recruited for 8 months to prepare a gender action \nplan to implement the gender strategy. The gender specialist will coordinate with resettlement specialist to \nprepare the action plan. \nHas an output been prepared?

Scope of Land Acquisition and Minimization of Resettlement \n1.  The  resettlement  plan  for  the  Project  covers  the  following  components  requiring \nresettlement: flyover bridge (1); new station (1); new loops (9); extension of passing loops (8); and \nrealignment (2) of various sections of the railway line. The resettlement plan also covers the land \nrequired for the two resettlement sites for households relocating from Lao Cai station. Resettlement \nimpacts were minimized by selecting engineering options that affected the least number of persons, \nwhile providing the most operational gains in safety and efficiency for the railway line, e.g., by not \nclearing land and structures in the whole right-of-way (ROW) unless certain structures or uses would \ncreate special safety risks to line operation.  \n2.  The total number of project-affected households covered in the resettlement plan is 591 \n(2,378 people). There are 411 project-affected households in the Project\u2019s corridor of impact (COI).1 \nOf these, 128 will be required to relocate (46 are joint house and business) and 88 will lose more \nthan 10% of their agricultural land. In the two resettlement sites proposed for Lao Cai town, 180 \nhouseholds will be affected by acquisition of their residential and garden land for the resettlement \nsites. Of the 46 businesses that will be affected, 41 will be able to rebuild on remaining land. The \nremaining  5  businesses  will  be  required  to  relocate  to  another  plot  of  land  with  comparable \ncommercial potential.  \nB.  Policy Framework and Project Entitlements \n3.  The policy framework and entitlements of the Project have been based upon Vietnamese \nlegislation, principally the 1993 Land Law amended in 1998, 2001 and 2003; Decree 197/CP (2004), \nas amended by Decree 17/CP (2006), on Compensation, Support and Resettlement when land is \nrecovered by the State; Circular 116 (2004) on guiding the implementation of Decree 197. They \nhave also been based on ADB\u2019s policies on involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples, gender \nand development, accountability, and public communications2. With the promulgation of Decree \n197/CP  (2004)  and  Decree  17/2006,  the  Government\u2019s  policy  and  legal  framework  related  to \nresettlement has moved much closer toward the principles underlying ADB\u2019s policies. However, in \ncase of discrepancies between the Government\u2019s laws, regulations, and procedures and ADB's \npolicies and requirements, ADB's policies and requirements will prevail. This is also in accordance \nwith Decree 17/2001 which stipulates that for projects financed by partner organizations, the donors\u2019 \npolicies will apply. \n4.  The  primary  strategy  for  ensuring  that  affected  persons  (APs)  are  able  to  maintain  or \nimprove pre-project living standards and production levels is (i) to ensure that all losses will be \ncompensated at replacement cost in cash or in kind and (ii) to provide transitional assistance (such \nas materials, transport, subsistence allowances, and incentive allowances for timely removal) and \nincome restoration programs to severely affected APs and vulnerable groups to support them in re-\nestablishing their income sources and production bases. Summary project entitlements are shown in \nthe Table A13. \nTable A13: Project Entitlements \nImpacts  Entitlements \nPermanent Acquisition of Land  For land that will be permanently used, APs will receive replacement land or \ncash compensation at replacement cost (based on current market value, \nproductive value, and similar location attributes). Non-titled APs will be allowed \nto use any remaining land that they are informally occupying; they not be \nentitled to compensation for land, but will be entitled to compensation for non-\nland assets and to rehabilitation assistance. The landless will be provided with \nreplacement land; landless APs losing the use of residential or commercial \nland will be provided with land in a fully-serviced resettlement site or market; \n                                                 \n1  Land for the railway line and station that will be required permanently. \n2  ADB. 1995.

Resettlement and Rehabilitation Strategies \n5.  Income restoration will be required for 88 households severely affected by the loss of \n10% or more of their productive agricultural land, and for 5 businesses that will be permanently \ndisplaced. As a priority, the agricultural land will be replaced and the 5 business will be assisted \nto relocate to locations with comparable business potential. \n6.  At the Van Phu, Mai Tung and Lao Cai stations, as well as at both resettlement sites, \nconsultations will be held with local authorities, the Railway Project Management Unit (RPMU) \nand the Railway Public Utility Company (RPUC). The rehabilitation strategies in Mai Tung and \nLao Cai will emphasize (i) provision of replacement land where available, notably at Mai Tung; \n(ii) finding new employment, e.g., at the new rail station in Mai Tung or industrial zones currently \nbeing developed in Lao Cai; (iii) developing non-land-based businesses, e.g., by reserving land \nspaces at the station for APs to build small service sector businesses; and (iv) integrating \nrehabilitation efforts with the social and economic development programs and policies of local \ngovernment and nongovernmental organizations in the area, such as the vocational training and \nsupport centers in Lao Cai city. For the remaining 18 project sites, where there are fewer than 5 \nseverely affected APs at each site, the specific strategy for their rehabilitation will be determined \non a case-by-case basis together with local authorities during updating of the resettlement plan. \nThe specific distribution of funds for income rehabilitation assistance will be determined together \nwith  the  relevant  People\u2019s  Committee  and  the  eligible  APs,  depending  on  the  income \nopportunities available in the locality and the specific needs and interests of the APs. Examples \nof uses for these funds include microcredit funds and start-up materials and equipment for new \nbusinesses. \n7.  With  regard  to  relocation,  the  Lao  Cai  city  People\u2019s  Committee  has  planned  two \nresettlement sites to accommodate the 90 APs who will relocate from Lao Cai station in Pho Moi \n ", "Appendix 13  59 \nward and Van Hoa commune. At the resettlement sites, each incoming household will be \nprovided with a residential land plot of 80\u2013100 m2; the sites will be fully serviced with external \nand internal road access, residential electricity, residential water supply, and drainage. APs that \nopt not to relocate to the resettlement site will be assisted to find another location. The 180 \nhouseholds  whose  land  and  non-land  assets  will  be  affected  by  the  resettlement  site \ndevelopment will be entitled to the same compensation and rehabilitation assistance provided to \nAPs in the Project\u2019s impact areas. Host APs who currently have houses on the resettlement site \nlands will be given assistance to relocate3 together with the APs from the project sites. In \nvarious sections of the railway where there will be a few APs that will be required to relocate \nand do not have sufficient residual land, the APs will be provided with individual replacement \nplots within the commune. No AP will be displaced until another place of residence or business \nhas been identified and secured. \nD.  Ethnicity, Vulnerability, and Gender Issues \n8.  Ethnic minorities are only 7% (32 households) of the AP population (ethnic minorities \ncomprise 14% of the national population). No large groups (i.e., more than 10) of ethnic minority \nAP households were found living together as a single community in the area of impact or the \nresettlement sites. However, to address the special risks and needs of ethnic minorities, specific \nactions have been outlined in the resettlement plan. With regard to identifying and addressing \nthe needs of women and helping prevent discrimination, a gender strategy has been outlined in \nthe resettlement plan. Special attention will be given to identifying and addressing any special \nneeds of other vulnerable groups (the poor, landless and disabled) by carrying out separate \nconsultation meetings and by ensuring that they also benefit from the special assistance and \nincome rehabilitation programs. (See gender strategy included in Appendix 12). \nE.  Participation, Grievance Redress, and Disclosure \n9.  Because the Project\u2019s area of impact includes many project sites with generally few \nhouseholds in each site, the first consultation meeting was carried out simultaneously with the \ninventory of losses and socioeconomic survey. All affected households took part. The primary \npurpose of the first consultation meeting was to provide APs with basic information on the \nProject, policies and principles for resettlement, and the process for developing the resettlement \nplan.  A  total  of  551  APs  attended  the  meetings,  180  of  whom  were  women.  The  draft \nresettlement plan was disclosed during the second consultation meeting which was held at Lao \nCai station. This meeting covered all components within the Yen-Lao RPUC. Another workshop \nwas held at the Vinh Phu station for all components within its jurisdiction. Participants from Ha \nThai RPUC also participated in this workshop for components in their jurisdiction. A total of 60 \nparticipants from various government departments, people\u2019s committees, and APs attended the \nmeeting, 7 of whom were women. Copies of the draft resettlement plan were provided to \nrelevant government offices and RPUC. Copies of the project information booklet were provided \nto RPUC and distributed to APs. \n10.  A grievance mechanism will be established to ensure that APs\u2019 concerns and grievances \nare addressed and resolved in a timely and satisfactory manner. APs will be made fully aware of \ntheir rights orally and in writing during consultations, surveys, and at the time of compensation \npayment. Copies of the ADB\u2019s An Information Guide to the Consultation Phase of the ADB \nAccountability Mechanism (footnote 2) (translated into Vietnamese) were also provided to APs \nduring the consultation meeting. \nF.  Implementation Arrangements and Monitoring \n11.  The main institution responsible for executing the resettlement plan will be the RPMU, \nunder  the  supervision  of  Vietnam  Railways  and  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  in  close \n                                                 \n3  The design of the resettlement site may require them to move back or transfer to another plot of land within the \nresettlement site. \n ", "60  Appendix 13 \ncoordination  with  the  relevant  provincial  People\u2019s  Committees.  The  provincial  People\u2019s \nCommittees will establish the resettlement committees at provincial and district levels. Project \nsupervision consultants will be engaged for supervision and capacity building to ensure that \nland acquisition and resettlement are carried out properly. The project supervision consultants \n(one international resettlement specialist, one national resettlement specialist, and one national \ngender  and  social  development  specialist)  will  be  recruited  and  mobilized  before  any \nresettlement activities begin. A detailed measurement survey of affected land and assets will be \ncarried out.  \n12.  The RPMU will be responsible for internal monitoring of resettlement activities. Progress \nreports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  quarterly.  An  independent  monitoring  agency  (IMA), \nspecialized  in  social  sciences,  will  be  recruited  for  3  years  and  mobilized  before  any \nresettlement activities, including the detailed measurement survey of affected land and assets \nbegin. The independent monitoring agency will report directly to the RPMU and the ADB. \nExternal monitoring will be carried out quarterly during the first year of implementation and then \nevery 6 months until all APs have been relocated.  \nG.  Cost Estimates and Implementation Schedule \n13.  The total cost for resettlement is estimated at $4.6 million. It covers compensation costs, \nlivelihood stabilization and socioeconomic support programs, resettlement site development, \nmanagement and implementation costs, and a 20% contingency. This amount may change at \nthe time of the detailed measurement survey to take into account actual losses and changes in \nprices that may have occurred between the preparation of the resettlement plan and actual \nimplementation.  The  Government  will  ensure  timely  provision  of  counterpart  funds  for \nresettlement and will meet any unforeseen obligations in excess of the resettlement plan budget \nin order to satisfy resettlement objectives.   \n14.  The resettlement plan will be updated following the detailed design. It will be disclosed to \nAPs before it is submitted to ADB for review and approval. For sections where there will be no \nland acquisition and resettlement, the civil works contractors will not be issued a notice of \npossession  of  sites  of  a  particular  section  until  the  RPMU,  together  with  the  resettlement \nconsultants, confirms that the area for the section will not have any resettlement impacts and \nthat  the  land  is  free  of  any  encumbrances,  dispute,  or  controversy.  For  sections  where \nresettlement impacts cannot be avoided, civil works contractors will not be issued a notice of \npossession of a particular section until (i) compensation payment and relocation to new sites \nhave been satisfactorily completed in that particular section, (ii) agreed rehabilitation assistance \nis in place, and (iii) that particular section is free of all encumbrances. Land acquisition and \nrelocation of APs cannot begin until the updated resettlement plan has been reviewed and \napproved by ADB.  \n15.  To ensure that temporary impacts during construction will be minimized and avoided if \npossible, the civil works contract will have the following requirements: (i) the contractor will pay \nrent for any additional land required for construction working space and a mechanism for \npayment will be specified in the relevant bid documents; (ii) the construction working space, to \nthe extent possible, will use only unused land, will not have any impacts on houses and \nstructures, and will not disrupt access to households or  business establishments and shops; \nand (iii) temporary use of land will be restored to its pre-project condition or improved. RPMU \nwill establish a mechanism to record impacts and ensure payments made to APs by the RPMU \nand resettlement committees, financed by the contractor, are at replacement cost in accordance \nwith  the  approved  resettlement  plan.  RPMU  will  record and  review  all  written  agreements \nbetween  the  contractor  and  APs  to  facilitate  proper  monitoring  and  compliance  with  the \napproved resettlement plan. This will be reported in the quarterly progress reports submitted to \nADB. \n \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20061222122343+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20061124100539+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - RRP VIE YV-LC Railway 23Nov06.doc", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "ECL", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0.1 (Windows)"}, "author_page": "Vice President  C.
