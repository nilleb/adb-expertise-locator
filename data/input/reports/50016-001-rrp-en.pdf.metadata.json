The \nprogram also addresses a key priority of the Government of Indonesia\u2019s National Medium-Term \nDevelopment Plan (Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah Nasional [RPJMN]), 2015\u20132019 \nto stimulate more inclusive growth, with a particular focus on Eastern Indonesia.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\n \nA. \n \n\nStrategic Context \n\n \n\nThe  role  of  the  energy  sector  as  a  key  enabler  of  inclusive  growth  has  become  more \nimportant as the Government of Indonesia is faced with the challenge of expanding its economy. \nThe annual rate of growth declined from 6.4% in 2010 to 5.0% in 2016 and is expected to remain \nat  5.1%  in  2017.  Improved  access  to  affordable  and  sustainable  forms  of  energy  is  critical  to \nenhance competitiveness, not only in the country\u2019s manufacturing and commercial centers, but \nalso in remote areas. Lack of access to energy constrains efforts to transform the eastern part of \nIndonesia into a new growth engine with a focus on high-value agriculture, fisheries, small and \nmedium-sized  enterprises,  and  tourism,  all  of  which  rely  on  a  stable  energy  supply.  Uneven \ndevelopment across provinces has contributed toward widening income disparities, with several \nprovinces in Eastern Indonesia lagging significantly behind Java and Bali.3 \n \n\n \n\nTo address this, the government has prioritized accelerating investment in infrastructure \nunder  the  RPJMN,  which  explicitly  includes  the  \u201couter\u201d  and  eastern  regions  as  geographical \npriorities. One of its pillars is to improve access to electricity services significantly by adding 35 \ngigawatts of generation capacity and expanding power grids to raise the national electrification \nratio from 84% in 2014 to 97% by the end of 2019. Eastern Indonesia, where power grids across \nthe islands are isolated, of poor quality, and underdeveloped, presents the greatest challenge to \nthe  achievement  of  these  targets.  The  electrification  ratios  in  some  eastern  provinces  are \nparticularly  low\u201474%  in  West  Sulawesi,  67%  in  Southeast  Sulawesi,  68%  in  West  Nusa \nTenggara, 59% in East Nusa Tenggara, and 44% in Papua.4 \n \n\n \n\nThe results-based lending (RBL) program aims to support the development of electricity \ndistribution  networks  to connect  businesses and  households and  enhance the quality  of  life in \nEastern Indonesia, while promoting the sustainable use of electricity as a key driver of increased \neconomic  activity.  The  program  will  complement  a  proposed  sector  loan for  small  to medium-\n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The government uses the term \u201cEastern Indonesia\u201d to cover all the provinces in Kalimantan, Maluku, Nusa Tenggara, \n\nPapua, and Sulawesi. \n\n3  For example, Jakarta\u2019s 2015 nominal annual per capita income ($14,727) was 13 times higher than that of East Nusa \n\nTenggara ($1,147). The income gap between the poorest and richest regions has widened since 2010. \n\n4  PLN Management Reporting Information System (Sistem Informasi Laporan Manajemen [SILM]). \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fsized natural gas-fired power stations across Eastern Indonesia.5 Natural gas is a much cleaner \nfuel than diesel, and the quick-responding nature of gas-fired engines and turbines makes them \na  good  match  for  intermittent,  renewable  energy  sources  such  as  solar  and  wind. 6 It  is  an \nappropriate transition fuel to move toward a low-carbon energy system. The two loans will help \nenhance  access  to  sustainable  energy  services,  consistent  with  the  Sustainable  Development \nGoals (goal 7: affordable and clean energy), and the Paris Agreement on climate change.7 \n \nB. \n \n\nProgram Rationale \n\n \n\nOverall,  the government\u2019s generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  program  under the \nRPJMN will require $83.5 billion in investments; of this, $43.5 billion is to come from the private \nsector (independent power producers), and the remaining $40.0 billion from PLN.8 PLN is unable \nto provide the entirety of this investment; an estimated funding gap of $30.3 billion will have to be \nborne by other financing sources, including development partners. In Eastern Indonesia, where \nthere are many isolated grids, PLN is already using its own resources to establish 70- and 150-\nkilovolt backbone transmission systems while seeking support from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and other partners to strengthen and expand local distribution networks.9 \n \n\n \n\nThe  government  has  taken  several  measures  to  strengthen  PLN\u2019s  financial  ability  to \nundertake this planned expansion, and to improve the investment climate for the private sector. \nThe government increased electricity tariffs in 2014, and instituted automatic price adjustments \non tariffs for all but the poorest households in 2015. Further, the government infused nearly $500 \nmillion in equity to PLN in 2015 and $1.8 billion in 2016. It is also piloting a new subsidy setting \napproach that will rely on performance and incentivize PLN to operate more efficiently in order to \ncapture additional savings. In 2015, the government passed regulations allowing PLN to borrow \ndirectly from bilateral and multilateral agencies against a sovereign-backed guarantee. \n \n\n \n\nThe RBL program will finance a portion of the overall broader program needs as identified \nin PLN\u2019s RUPTL, 2017\u20132026 for strengthening and expanding the power distribution network in \nEastern  Indonesia.  It  builds  on  the  experience  and  lessons  learned  from  the  ongoing  RBL \nprogram for grid strengthening in Sumatra.10 The RBL is a suitable modality as (i) it uses PLN\u2019s \nown  systems,  such  that  the  agreed  program  actions  will  directly  contribute  to  institutional \nstrengthening beyond the RBL program\u2019s geographical coverage; (ii) its focus on results rather \nthan  expenditures  will  help  establish  a  stronger  evaluation  culture  complementary  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s intent to provide incentives based on corporate performance; (iii) it helps lower the \ntransaction costs involved in managing  thousands of small-scale activities and expenditures to \n\n                                                \n5  ADB. 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: Indonesia, 2017\u20132019. Manila. \n6  Eastern Indonesia is considered to have significant wind and solar resources. ADB is supporting the government on \n\npolicies and procurement approaches to help spur wind and solar project development. \n\n7  United Nations General Assembly. 2015. Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. \n\nNew York; The Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \n\n8  The breakdown of PLN\u2019s $40.0 billion is (i) $15.5 billion for generation, (ii) $17.0 billion for transmission, and (iii) $7.5 \n\nbillion for distribution. \n\n9  The government is keen to increase renewable energy use in Eastern Indonesia where fuel transport costs are high, \n\nand PLN is seeking technical support from partners to enable these small grids to handle intermittency issues. \n\n10 ADB. 2015. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Results-Based Loan \nto Perusahaan Listrik Negara for Electricity Grid Strengthening\u2014Sumatra Program. Manila. The World Bank provides \na $500 million program-for-results (PforR) loan in parallel to ADB\u2019s $600 million program.  PLN has fully achieved \nboth the ADB and World Bank 2016 annual disbursement-linked indicators and making progress on all items under \nthe program action plan. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fdevelop  the  distribution  network;11 and  (iv)  it  will  enable  PLN,  government  stakeholders,  and \ndevelopment partners to convene around achieving the results and outcomes of the program to \nenhance collaboration.12 \n  \n\n \n\nADB\u2019s  value  addition  to  this  program\u2019s  design  include  (i)  strengthening  institutional \ncapacity and addressing bottlenecks to help make PLN\u2019s operations safer and more sustainable,  \n(ii) keeping technical power losses low by emphasizing the number of distribution transformers,13 \n(iii) introducing technological innovations that can optimize resources and contribute to climate \nchange mitigation, and (iv) supporting PLN\u2019s efforts to scale up the adoption of new energy meters \nwhile educating consumers on their energy expenditures. In particular, the program\u2019s incentives \nfor improved waste management will achieve a breakthrough for all regions where PLN operates, \nand the smart grid pilot projects will allow for a higher mix of renewable energy to support the \ncountry\u2019s transition toward more environmentally sustainable growth.14 \n \n\n \n\nThis  operation  is  consistent  with  the  priorities  outlined  in  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy,  2016\u20132019  for  Indonesia 15  which  has  a  strong  focus  on  the  energy  sector \n(approximately $1 billion per year), and is part of an overall programmatic approach embedded \nwithin  a  policy  reform  framework  supported  by  the  Sustainable  and  Inclusive  Energy  Program \npolicy-based loan.16 It will complement the proposed loan for power generation and a further loan \nto develop the power distribution network in Eastern Indonesia. It has been coordinated with the \nkey development partners supporting Indonesia\u2019s energy sector.17 \n \nC. \n \n\nProgram Scope \n\n \n\nPLN and ADB have agreed on a RBL program size of $1,830 million dedicated to the eight \nprovinces across Nusa Tenggara and Sulawesi,18 of which the proposed loan will finance $600 \nmillion. Table 1 summarizes the RBL program scope. \n \n\nItem \nOutcome \n\nTable 1: Program Scope \n\nBroader PLN Program \n\nEnhanced energy security \n\nResults-Based Lending Program \n\nEnhanced access to more reliable \nelectricity services for residential, \ncommercial, and industrial customers \n\n                                                \n11 The  most  recent  loan  for  power  distribution  (Loan  2619-INO:  Java\u2013Bali  Electricity  Distribution  Performance \nImprovement Project) experienced significant delays due to rebidding and contractor underperformance. It applied a \n\u201cring-fenced\u201d procurement approach typical for ADB loans, and consolidated contracts into large packages to ease \nadministration. However, the approach effectively excluded the smaller contractors that normally carry out distribution \ncontracts and did not take advantage of PLN\u2019s own system for mid- and low-voltage grid development.  \n\n12 Additional development partners are currently considering possible parallel cofinancing for this RBL program. \n13 The RUPTL targets are based on total transformer capacity which allows the regional operational teams to use larger \n\ntransformers at longer intervals, leading to higher losses from extended low-voltage lines. \n\n14 In  line  with  the  government\u2019s  Intended  Nationally  Determined  Contributions  submitted  to  the  United  Nations \n\nFramework Convention on Climate Change. \n\n15 ADB. 2016.

Agence  Francaise  de \nDeveloppement, the Islamic  Development Bank, and KfW are currently considering support for power distribution \nsystems in Eastern Indonesia. \n\n18 The  eight  provinces  include  East  Nusa  Tenggara,  West  Nusa  Tenggara,  and  six  provinces  in  Sulawesi  (North \n\nSulawesi, Central Sulawesi, West Sulawesi, South Sulawesi, Southeast Sulawesi, and Gorontalo). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nItem \nKey outputs \n\nExpenditure size \n\nBroader PLN Program \n\nTransmission backbone system \ndeveloped and distribution system \nstrengthened and expanded \n$5,057 million (including $3,385 \nmillion for base costs) \n\nResults-Based Lending Program \nDistribution system strengthened and \nexpanded; innovation and institutional \ncapacity enhanced  \n$1,830 million (including $1,214 \nmillion for base costs), of which: \nADB: $600 million (32.8%) \nPLN and others (67.2%) \nSulawesi and Nusa Tenggara \n2017\u20132021 \n\nGeographic coverage \nImplementation period \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PLN = State Electricity Corporation (Perusahaan Listrik Negara). \nSources: ADB and PLN estimates. \n\nSulawesi and Nusa Tenggara \n2017\u20132021 \n\n \n\nD. \n \n\nProgram Results \n\n \n\nThe RBL program\u2019s impact, which is aligned with the RUPTL goal, will be the quality of life \nin Indonesian society enhanced by the sustainable use of electricity as a key driver of increased \neconomic activity. The outcome will be expanded access to more reliable electricity services for \nresidential,  commercial,  and  industrial  customers  in  the  Eastern  Indonesian  provinces  across \nSulawesi and Nusa Tenggara. This will be achieved through the following two outputs: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nOutput  1.  Distribution  system  strengthened  and  expanded.  This  output  will \nhelp address the need for an expanded and strengthened distribution system, and \nconsequently  improve  electrification  rates,  reduce  overloading,  and  address \nreliability issues for the local population and businesses. \nOutput  2.  Innovation  and  institutional  capacity  enhanced.  This  output  will \nsupport  PLN\u2019s  efforts  to  innovate  and  strengthen  institutional  capacity  for \nenvironmental management and increased efficiency. The program will (a) support \ninnovation  through  pilot-scale  smart  grid  projects,  which  will  integrate  the \nexpanded  use  of  intermittent,  renewable  energy  sources  and  better  manage \ndemand  fluctuation; 19  (b)  expand  the  use  of  digital  prepaid  meters  to  reduce \nnontechnical  losses,  payment  defaults,  and  servicing  costs  in  remote  areas;  (c) \nimprove  PLN\u2019s  asset  and  waste  management  with  the  safe  disposal  of  several \nyears\u2019  backlog  of  used equipment,  including  hazardous waste; and  (d) track  the \ntimely implementation of distribution system contracts. \n\n \n\nThe  conclusions  of  the  results  chain  analysis  and  the  disbursement-linked  indicators \n(DLIs)20 show  that  these  two  outputs  are  sufficient  to  achieve  the  outcome.  The  outcome  is \nmeasured by three DLIs: DLI 1 and DLI 2 measure the expanded access to electricity (customers \n[DLI 1] and energy sales [DLI 2]), while DLI 3 measures the reliability of the electricity supply. To \nachieve  this  outcome,  physical  components  (output  1)  as  well  as  institutional  improvements \n(output 2) are needed. Thus, progress toward output 1 is tracked by DLI 4 (distribution transformer \nunits installed) and DLI 5 (mid-voltage lines installed). Progress toward output 2 is measured by \nDLI 6 (pilot smart grid projects implemented), DLI 7 (use of digital prepaid meters increased), and \nDLI 8 (asset and waste management improved). \n \n\n \n\nOverall,  the  DLIs  and  other  performance  indicators  provide  ambitious  yet  achievable \nmeasures  of  progress  toward  the  program  outputs  and  outcome.  The  DLI  targets  have  been \ndeveloped in consultation with experienced system planners in PLN and are as close as possible \n\n                                                \n19 The smart grid pilot projects will be aligned to support planned investments in solar and wind energy by both PLN \nand  the  private  sector.

Loan  proceeds  will  be \ndisbursed  to  PLN\u2019s  account  with  a  commercial  bank.  Further,  advance  financing  will  also  be \nallowed  to  address  financing  requirements  as  needed  within  the  RBL  policy  limits.24 PLN  will \nrefund any advance financing amount outstanding if the DLIs are not achieved. \n \nF. \n \n\nCapacity Development and Program Action Plan \n\n \n\nVarious  assessments  have  identified  capacity  gaps for  implementing  the  RBL  program \n(section III). Based on these assessments, a PAP was developed to enhance PLN\u2019s capacity in \naddition  to  the  three  output-level  institutional  strengthening  DLIs.  The  PAP  includes  actions  in \nspecific  technical  areas,  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E),  fiduciary  management,  and \nsafeguards to ensure that the achievement of key program results strengthens PLN systems, thus \nmaking the program results more sustainable. The PAP will focus on implementation capacity, \nwhich will complement physical investments under the program and contribute to its overall efforts \nto increase staff resources and improve institutional monitoring and reporting systems. \n \nG. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\nThe executing agency will be PLN. PLN\u2019s regional offices (wilayahs) in Nusa Tenggara \nand  Sulawesi  will  implement  the  program,  with  overall  oversight  by  PLN  headquarters.25 The \nprogram will be implemented from October 2017 to December 2021. \n\nIII. \n\nSUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n\n \nA. \n \n\nProgram Technical Assessments \n\n \n\nA review of the technical soundness of the program found that the distribution design is \nsimple  and straightforward,  and generally  follows  international  practice.  Overall,  PLN\u2019s  plan  to \ndevelop the power systems in Nusa Tenggara and Sulawesi is operationally viable and can be \nexpected to increase service coverage and reliability.26 These conclusions underpin the results \nareas, key actions to be taken, and performance indicators for the sector overall, and the RBL \nprogram in particular. \n \n\n \n\nThe primary program beneficiaries will be the 1.3 million additional households connected \nto the distribution grid. Children will be able to read and study in the evenings, and air quality will \nimprove once fuel lamps are eliminated. People will be able to communicate better and access \ninformation via phones and other devices, and village schools and health centers can benefit from \nlighting and refrigeration for vaccines and health supplies. The program will also expand electricity \naccess to small and medium-sized businesses including in tourism, fisheries, and agro-industry, \nand can contribute to substantial job growth. \n \n                                                \n\nextend the regional coverage to Nusa Tenggara and Sulawesi subject to the Board\u2019s approval of the proposed loan. \nAs is the case between ADB and the World Bank for the Sumatra program, the IVA arrangement for Nusa Tenggara \nand Sulawesi may be shared with other development partners when and where similar verifications are required. \n24 Ceilings are 25% for advance financing and 20% for financing for prior results. The combined outstanding balance \n\nof advance financing and the amount of financing for prior results should not exceed 30%. \n\n25 Key PLN divisions in headquarters have developed a good capacity to plan and manage RBL programs due to their \nexperience during 2015\u20132016 with both ADB\u2019s RBL program and the World Bank\u2019s Program-for-Results for Sumatra. \n\n26 Program Soundness Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n \n\n2). \n\n \n\n \n\nAlthough expanding and strengthening the electricity grid has no gender-specific actions, \nwomen will benefit substantially from the program. A reliable and affordable electricity supply will \nreduce the amount of effort spent by women to obtain other fuels. It will also enable women to run \nincome-generating activities from their own homes. Communities will be able to pump and store \nwater, and having well-lit streets will deter crime and enhance safety for girls and women. \n \n\n \n\nThe program will generate incremental benefits that accrue from the additional electricity \nsupply. The program\u2019s economic viability is evaluated using a system approach for the entire PLN \nprogram  in  Nusa  Tenggara  and  Sulawesi,  as  the  benefits  are  dependent  on  interlinked \ninvestments  in  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution.  Following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects, the economic analysis of the program yields an economic internal \nrate of return of 14.6%, confirming the program\u2019s economic viability (footnote 26). \n  \nB. \n \n\nProgram Systems Assessments \n\n  Monitoring  and  evaluation  systems.  PLN\u2019s  corporate  M&E  system  is  handled  and \nmanaged by its Corporate Performance Control Unit using its Management Reporting Information \nSystem  (Sistem  Informasi  Laporan  Manajemen  [SILM]),  which  will  also  be  used  to  track  the \nprogress of the DLIs.27 SILM provides accurate, real-time, critical data online, such as electricity-\ngeneration,  sales,  transmission  and  distribution,  and  the  project  development  status.  Each \ndepartment  also  operates  other  information  technology  applications  which  generate  data  that \nfeeds into SILM and provide additional information on current activities for PLN\u2019s management. \n \n\n \n\nA  monthly  report  provides  comprehensive  data  on  customer  service  quality,  project \nperformance,  corporate  performance,  and  electricity  conditions.  The  Corporate  Performance \nControl Unit, together with the supervising regional division in PLN\u2019s headquarters, holds monthly \nvideoconferences with each wilayah to verify the numbers in SILM. To complement PLN\u2019s internal \nM&E procedures, ADB will engage an IVA to verify information related to DLIs (footnote 23). \n \n\n \n\nFiduciary  systems.  The  program  will  use  PLN\u2019s  fiduciary  systems  for  financial \nmanagement, procurement, and audit. These systems were assessed to determine their ability to \nmanage fiduciary risks and provide assurance that RBL program funds will be used as intended, \nwith due consideration for economy and efficiency.28 The assessments found that planning and \nbudgeting improvements are needed, and that further computerization is required for accounting \nand financial reporting. This will be covered by activities under the PAP. \n\nA  procurement  assessment  covered  the  following  areas:  (i)  procurement  profile;  (ii) \nprocurement  regulations,  rules,  and procedures; (iii)  procurement  organizational  arrangements \nand capacity; and (iv) procurement system performance.29 The RBL program will rely on PLN\u2019s \nsystems and will exclude high-value contracts in accordance with ADB\u2019s RBL policy.30 PLN has \nestablished a well-defined and accountable procurement process, and has implemented various \ne-procurement  and  backend systems.  Procurement  under the  RBL  program  scope  will  include \nmaterials for distribution lines; works and service contracts for distribution lines; and engineering, \n\n                                                \n27 Program Monitoring and Evaluation System Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n\n28 Program Fiduciary Systems Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Procurement Assessment of Indonesia\u2019s State Electricity Corporation (Perusahaan Listrik Negara) (accessible from \n\nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n30 ADB.  2013.  Piloting  Results-Based  Lending  for  Programs. Manila.  High  value contracts are  those  with estimated \nvalue over $50 million for works, turnkey and supply, and installation contracts; $30 million for goods; $20 million for \ninformation technology systems and non-consulting services; and $15 million for consulting services. \n\n\fprocurement, and construction of the pilot smart grid systems. PLN will procure the materials for \ndistribution centrally through limited bidding and framework contracts. The procurement of works \nand installation services will be carried out by  PLN wilayahs, including the sub-regional offices \n(areas) under them. Experience from the ongoing RBL in Sumatra shows that this procurement \nprocess is appropriate for power distribution network development. The procurement under the \npilot smart grid projects will be carried out following PLN\u2019s open competitive bidding procedures \nallowing international bidders to participate. \n \n\n \n\nPLN\u2019s overall procurement risk is assessed as moderate. The main deficiencies and risks \nin PLN\u2019s procurement system are (i) limitations on international bidders who wish to participate, \ndue  to  requirements  for  local  content;  (ii)  the  use  of  noncompetitive  procurement  methods, \nincluding  several  direct  contracting  methods  and  limited  bidding  for  certain  procurement \ncategories;  (iii)  insufficient  procurement  capacity  or  capacity  of  local  contractors  to  scale  up \nprocurement  under  the  program,  especially  in  PLN  wilayahs  and  areas;  and  (iv)  insufficient \nprocurement planning, which may lead to implementation delays. The key procurement risks will \nbe addressed through activities under the PAP. \n \n\n \n\nThe Guidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, Corruption, and Other Prohibited Activities \n\nin Results-Based Lending for Programs were explained to and discussed with PLN. \n \n\n \n\nSafeguard systems. A program safeguard system assessment assessed the safeguards \nsystem  of  the  government  and  PLN,  and  confirmed  the  safeguards  categorizations  of  B  for \nenvironment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples. 31  All  environment  policy \nprinciples,  7  out  of  12  involuntary  resettlement  principles,  and  6  out  of  9  indigenous  peoples \nprinciples  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  are  triggered.  Potential  construction-\nrelated impacts include soil erosion, noise, dust, and waste generation. Potential impacts during \noperation include the trimming of trees within the right-of-way of distribution lines. The program \nimpacts are site-specific and, in most cases, mitigation measures can be readily designed. The \nexpansion  of  the  distribution  network  usually  requires  (i)  the  use  of  no  more  than  0.2  square \nmeters of land for each concrete pole, (ii) possible removal of non-land assets (primarily trees) \nfor the stringing of conductors, and (iii) about 4.5 square meters of land for each pole-mounted \ntransformer installed on two utility poles. Some of the land used for the program may be owned \nby indigenous peoples groups. \n \n\n \n\nIdentified weakness in safeguard systems include (i) safeguards screening (of projects in \nprotected areas and key biodiversity areas), (ii) institutional capacity, (iii) monitoring and reporting, \n(iv)  guidance  on  environmental  mitigation  measures,  (v)  asset  and  waste  management,  (vi) \nconsultations, and (vii) written agreements for land use (for distribution transformers). These will \nbe  addressed  by  program  actions,  including  a  screening  mechanism  to  ensure  that  the  RBL \nprogram excludes activities that would be classified as category  A. DLI 8 addresses asset and \nwaste management. \n \nC. \n \n\nIntegrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n\n  Major  risks  and  mitigating measures  are  summarized  in  Table  5.32 The  overall  benefits \n\nand impacts are expected to outweigh the risks and costs. \n \n\n                                                \n31 Program Safeguard Systems Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).
