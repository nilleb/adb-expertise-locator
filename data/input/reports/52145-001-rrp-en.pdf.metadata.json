This enables the sequencing of reforms and phased support from the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  improve  service  delivery  and  bridge  the  urban\u2013rural  divide.  The \nprogrammatic approach builds on ADB\u2019s ongoing first Decentralized Public Service and Financial \nManagement  Sector  Development  Program.1  The  project  component  will  operationalize  the \nNational School of Local Administration (NASLA) to provide sustainable capacity development for \nstaff of subnational administrations (SNAs).2   \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nEconomic performance. Cambodia has enjoyed strong economic growth between 1995 \nand 2018; its gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average annual rate of 7.7%. Growth has \nbeen  underpinned  with  effective  macroeconomic  management,  prudent  fiscal  policy,  strong \nperformance in domestic revenue mobilization, and low risk of sovereign debt distress.3 Prior to \nthe coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the poverty incidence declined from 47.8% in 2007 to 13.5% \nin 2014. These gains are under threat as the economy is now projected to contract by 5.5% in \n2020 due to COVID-19, pushing an additional 1.3 million into either moderate or extreme poverty. \nThe government\u2019s fiscal balance will worsen from -5.9% of GDP to -12.8%. Government revenues \nare expected to decline by 30.9% in 2020 as key sectors of the economy grind to a halt.4  \n \n4. \nDevelopment problem. Service delivery indicators have improved with progress made in \nproviding roads, water supply, and sanitation; but access to basic services varies greatly. In 2017, \nonly 77% of urban residents and 11% of rural residents had piped water supply. More than 75% \nof  urban  residents  did  not  have  regular  solid  waste  management  services.  Urbanization  has \nheightened  the  demand  for  services,  which  are  limited  by  ineffective  institutional  coordination. \nProvincial differences also highlight gender disparities\u2014the proportion of women who have never \nattended formal education is higher in rural areas (17.5%) than in urban areas (10.8%).5 \n \n5. \nImpact  of  COVID-19.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  led  to  a  significant  decline  in  key \nsectors of Cambodia\u2019s economy and losses in livelihoods, with the unemployment rate increasing \nfrom 0.7% to 4.4% (footnote 4). Prior to the onset of COVID-19, more than 70% of Cambodians \nalready  lived  on  less  than  $3  a  day,  vulnerable  to  economic  and  external  shocks.  Poor  and \nvulnerable households are especially at risk from the impact of COVID-19. The government will \n\n \n\n1  ADB.

The middle \ntier  of  districts,  municipalities,  and  khans  (D/M/K)  comprises  162  rural  districts,  27  urban  municipalities,  and  \n14 khans. The lowest tier of local government comprises 1,410 rural communes and 236 urban sangkats. \n\n3  International Monetary Fund. 2019. Cambodia: 2019 Article IV Consultation. Washington, DC. \n4  ADB.

Phnom Penh. \n\n\fneed to play a greater role in service delivery to respond to the adverse socioeconomic effects of \nCOVID-19 from increased unemployment and reduced remittances for households that are likely \nto jeopardize inclusive and equitable growth. SNA staff will also need to meet additional service \ndelivery  needs  to  support  implementation  of  government  response  on  COVID-19,  such  as \nincreased social assistance. As demands on SNA staff increase, strengthening SNAs to operate \nin an uncertain environment will be increasingly important.6  \n \n6. \nWeak  subnational  planning.  The  government  embarked  on  decentralization  and \ndeconcentration  (D&D)  reforms  in  2001,  establishing  a  comprehensive  subnational  legislative \nframework  which  defined  SNAs  as  the  legal  entities  responsible  for  service  delivery, \nresponsiveness, and accountability.7 Progress made on service delivery outcomes across SNA \ntiers has been mixed with functions and the assignment of key responsibilities unclear. Provinces \nwhich  are  larger,  better  funded  and  have  more  capacity  are  able  to  deliver  services  more \neffectively  than  districts  which  are  underdeveloped,  underfunded  and  have  greater  capacity \nneeds.  The  lack  of  complaints  and  dispute  resolution  mechanisms  to  hold  service  providers \naccountable for services provided to citizens also limits overall coverage and quality of services.   \n \n7. \nIneffective  revenue  and  expenditure  management.  Revenue  mobilization  increased \nfrom  15.2%  of  GDP  in  2014  to  25.9%  in  2019  with  improvements  in  tax  administration  and \nefficiency,8  but  remains  centralized.9  Availability  of  resources  to  meet  mandates  for  service \ndelivery  remains  low.  Between  2012  and  2018,  district\u2013municipality\u2013khan  (DMK)  funding  as  a \nshare of the total SNA spending increased from 6.4% to 9.2%.10 The share of commune\u2013sangkat \nfunding marginally declined from 27.9% to 25.8%, reflecting priority to the DMK tiers for service \ndelivery.  Fiscal  transfers  from  the  national  budget  to  the  capital  and  provinces  accounted  for \n64.9%  of  total  SNA  spending.  Strengthening  domestic  revenue mobilization  at  the  subnational \nlevel will be key to service provision and meeting the Sustainable Development Goals.11 \n \n8. \nWeak  public  administration  and  poorly  skilled  subnational  officials.  Skills \ndevelopment of SNA staff is hampered by the absence of a common institutional framework that \naligns  with  their  duties  of  service  delivery.  SNA  staff  lack  regulatory  knowledge  and  technical \nskills.12  Women  hold  only  18%  of  permanent  positions  in  the  civil  service.  Existing  institutions \nsuch  as  the  Royal  School  of  Administration  serve  a  narrow  cohort  of  civil  servants  and  are \noperating at full capacity.13 The investment component underpins the overall reform program by \naddressing this skills shortage that constrains effective service delivery at the subnational level.   \n \nB. \n \n9. \n\nGovernment  reform  agenda.

The  government\u2019s  comprehensive  approach \nincludes: (i) improving the quality of governance; (ii) strengthening human resource management; \nand (iii) better coordination between the national and subnational governments. \n \n10. \nADB\u2019s  experience.  ADB  has  provided  comprehensive  support  to  D&D  reforms  since \n2002,  including  on  the  subnational  legislative  framework  and  operationalizing  fiscal  transfer \nmechanisms. Between 2002 and 2012, ADB\u2019s engagement focused on strengthening commune \ncouncils18 and increasing engagement of line ministries in D&D reforms for improved resource \nprioritization for the rural population.19 These engagements were rated as relevant and effective \nin  supporting  stronger  local  governance.20  From  2012,  under  the  first  DPSFM  (footnote  1)  an \nefficient system of intergovernmental fiscal relations for improved service delivery was established \nby:  (i)  reinforcing  the  regulatory framework; (ii)  strengthening  institutions; and (iii)  defining  service \ndelivery  responsibilities.  The  proposed  SDP  is  consistent  with  the  overarching  public  sector \nmanagement reforms,21 and is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (Table 1)22 and pillar 2 and pillar \n4 of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2019\u20132023.23 The programmatic approach for the PBL \nallows  for  sequenced  and  coordinated  interventions  aligned  with  the  national  PFM  reform \nagenda.24  The  SDP  modality  allows  for  mutual  reinforcement.  Under  subprogram  1  the  policy \nactions  deepen  the  legislative  framework  for  improvements  in  D&D  reforms  and  the  project \nensures sustainability by addressing long-term skills constraints of SNA staff. \n\n \nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \n\nSecond Decentralized Public Service and Financial Management \nProgram, Subprogram 1 \nStrengthening subnational  service  delivery to  improve  the  quality  and \ncoverage of services and thereby minimize regional disparities \nIncreasing women\u2019s participation in service delivery; boosting women\u2019s \nleadership and training opportunities at the subnational level \nClimate-proofing  of  the  National  School  of  Local  Administration. \nMainstreaming climate considerations into the curriculum for subnational \nadministration staff of all grades and ranks \nProfessionalizing  subnational  staff  to  meet  the  expanded  role  of \nsubnational governments in ensuring better service delivery \n\nStrategy 2030 Priorities \n\nAddressing remaining poverty and \nreducing inequalities \nAccelerating progress in gender \nequality \nTackling climate change, building \ndisaster resilience, and enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability \nStrengthening governance and \ninstitutional capacity \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\n14 Government of Cambodia. 2018.

Important  lessons  have  emerged  from  ADB\u2019s  engagement  in  D&D \n11. \nreforms in Cambodia. First, the political, fiscal, and administrative complexities in D&D reforms \nrequire flexibility in meeting emerging needs and realistic timeframes for implementation. Building \nconsensus amongst diverse stakeholders requires significant efforts to maintain momentum for \nreforms.  Second,  while  integration  of  policy-based  and  project  interventions  can  leverage \ncommitment  for  long  term  policy  reforms,  more  support  on  implementation  is  needed.25  The \nproposed SDP reinforces the D&D policy and regulatory framework, while recognizing the need \nfor long term support to SNAs for successful implementation of D&D policies.   \n \n12. \nADB value addition. ADB\u2019s long-term and comprehensive engagement in Cambodia has \nsupported  legal,  policy,  and  institutional  reforms  key  to  furthering  D&D  reforms.  ADB  has \npreviously  provided  TA  to  support  functional  mapping  of  SNA  responsibilities  and  the  legal \nframework for intergovernmental fiscal relations.26 ADB also provided TA to pilot decentralization \nof key services such as rural water supply to districts.27 ADB TA resources have supported needs \nanalysis for SNA staff and advisory support for the governance structure of NASLA and delivered \nfive pilot courses, including a leadership course for women.28 The project under DPSFM II will \nensure  sustainable  capacity  building  and  innovations  that  add  value  by:  (i)  ensuring  teaching \nquality  through  peer-to-peer  links;  (ii) optimizing  information  technology  solutions  to  improve \nteacher training and student learning; and (iii) tailoring the NASLA curriculum to SNA staff needs. \n \nC. \n \n13. \nThe  overall  program  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  SNAs  deliver  public  services \nsustainably,  effectively,  and  efficiently  to  all  Cambodians.  The  overall  program  will  have  the \nfollowing outcome: service delivery by SNAs strengthened.29 The first subprogram will develop \nthe legislative framework for stronger SNA governance underpinned by an investment component \nfor the skills development of SNA staff. The second subprogram will support implementation of \nbetter service delivery, rendered more important due to the constraints on revenue mobilization \nand expenditures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The project loan will help meet the core \ncapacity building needs associated with the overall program.  \n \n14. \nReform area 1: Vertical and horizontal coordination for responsive and accountable \nservice  delivery  strengthened.  The  government  improved  the  links  between  national  and \nsubnational policy objectives of strengthened service delivery. First, it approved the Subnational \nBudget  Reform  Strategy  2019\u20132025  to  outline  the  next  generation  of  budget  reforms.  This \nincluded the expansion of program budgeting and inclusion of SNAs to ensure that local priorities \nare  integrated  with  national  objectives.  Second,  to  improve  efficiency  and  coordination,  the \ngovernment approved a sub-decree that integrated district-level line ministry offices with district \nadministrations. District administrations will have an expanded mandate for service delivery with \nadditional  responsibilities  in  education,  rural  development,  and  social  affairs.  Third,  the \ngovernment established internal control functions for improved risk management within the new \nunified district administrations. Fourth, the government approved a sub-decree to establish one-\nwindow services for citizens for faster processing of business licenses and permits. Ombudsman \n\n \n\n25 ADB.

First, to meet the increasing development needs of communes and sangkats, the \ngovernment approved the transfer of additional resources from the national budget.30 As a result, \nthe overall resource envelope for commune and sangkats has increased with the development \nfund  component  more  than  doubled  in  2020  to  address  infrastructure  priorities  and  social \nservices,  including  the  expansion  of  services  for  women  and  marginalized  groups.  Second,  to \nimprove  the  management  of  subnational  assets,  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  (MEF) \nsubmitted a law on the management and use of state property to the cabinet for approval. The \nproposed law will ensure the transparent management of subnational assets\u2014(i) management of \nstate property; (ii) permissible arrangements for rent, sale, and concession of state property; and \n(iii) responsibility for revenue and tax liabilities. Finally, the government approved a 15% share of \nnontax revenues (previously 0%) collected by line ministries and shared with SNAs, to boost their \nrevenue base and fund service delivery responsibilities. Under subprogram 2, financial guidelines \nwill  be  established  to  improve  commune,  or  sangkat  fund  management  and  nontax  revenue-\nsharing arrangements collected from state property strengthened. \n \n16. \nReform  area  3:  Public  administration  skills  and  competencies  of  subnational \nofficials enhanced. The government addressed longer-term capacity development needs. First, \nthe government approved a sub-decree and guidelines to give SNAs more autonomy in managing \nstaff.  Second, the Ministry of Interior (MOI) endorsed prakas and a strategic plan for long-term \ncapacity development including delivery of key training programs by type and target group, and \nmilestones for improving the development of human resources. Third, under the interim NASLA \ntraining  strategy  supported  by  ADB,  five  courses  were  successfully  designed  and  piloted  to \n2,087 SNA staff, of which 20% were women. A leadership course for women at the subnational \nlevel was piloted and jointly delivered with the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs. Finally, the National \nCommittee  for  Sub-National  Democratic  Development  (NCDD)  approved  its  gender  equality \npolicy  to  strengthen  the  role  and  participation  of  women  in  service  delivery.  This  included:  \n(i) greater representation of women in management; (ii) allocation of resources; and (iii) improved \nservices for women and children. Under subprogram 2, guidelines will be adopted to strengthen \nSNAs\u2019  performance  management.  NASLA  will  deliver  a  tailored  curriculum  and  implement  the \ngender equality policy at the subnational level. \n \n17. \nProject Loan: The project will operationalize NASLA to develop the capacity of SNA staff \nof all ranks and grades for long-term sustainability of D&D reforms. It has three outputs: (i) design, \nconstruction,  and  installation  of  the  physical  infrastructure  of  NASLA;  (ii)  NASLA  curriculum \ndevelopment to ensure high-quality teaching and training; and (iii) NASLA staff professionalized \nand core operations established. Output 1 includes the design and construction of the NASLA \ncomplex, \nincludes:  \n(i)  diagnostic  of  the  SNA  staff  competency  framework;  (ii) pilot  of  NASLA  courses  aligned  to \ncompetency standards as agreed with the MOI training department; and (iii) courses delivered \nunder the interim training strategy. Output 3 includes: (i) a training needs assessment for NASLA \nstaff; (ii) peer-to-peer networks to improve teaching relevance and quality; and (iii) an operations \n\nintegrating  gender  and  climate-resilient  design \n\nfeatures.31  Output 2 \n\n \n\n30 The additional resources allocated from the national budget to the communes and sangkats are based on a formula \n\nfor transfer that accounts for population, poverty profile, and the number of villages in a commune or sangkat. \n\n31 The Ministry of Interior does not currently have adequate facilities to deliver large scale training for SNA staff.  Existing \n\ngovernment schools are operating at full capacity.  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nmanual covering human resource management, financial management, and procurement. \n \nD. \n \nOverall program financing.

The  government  has  requested  a  concessional  loan  of \n$20 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the first subprogram. The loan \nwill have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1% per year during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter. The PBL will be released upon loan effectiveness. \nThe size of the PBL is based on strength of the policy reforms and financing needs. In 2020, the \nfiscal deficit is estimated at -12.8% and total financing needs have increased to $3.54 billion as \nrevenues  decline  due  to  COVID-19  impact.    It  is  estimated  that  $1.31  billion  will  be  financed \ndomestically, and $2.24 billion from foreign financing (with $760 million in budget support).  \n \nProject investment plan.

The \nestimated economic benefits across the consolidated SNA funds are estimated at $0.30 million in \n2023 and projected to increase to $2.39 million in 2027, remaining at this level until 2045. The \ntotal accumulated economic benefits are estimated at $65 million for the period 2023\u20132045. The \ncalculated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  investment  is  13.3%,  indicating  economic \nviability.  The  fiscal  impact  analysis  confirms  that  the  government  has  adequate  financial \nresources to fulfill its financial obligations for the longer-term sustainability of NASLA.34 \n \nB. \n \n23. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nguidelines  and  identified  financial  management  risks  in  staffing,  internal  audit  and  control, \ninformation systems, and financial reporting. The project financial management risk was assessed \nas  substantial  due  to  the  limited  experience  of  NASLA  in  working  with  development-partner-\nfunded projects. A PMU will be set up to mitigate financial management and procurement risks. \nValue for money was achieved through contract packaging, and the selection of the procurement \nand bidding method as part of the strategic procurement planning exercise. The MOI will recruit \nqualified  financial  management  and  procurement  specialists  into the  PMU  with  seconded  MOI \nDepartment  of  Training  staff.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained to and discussed with the government, the NCDD, MOI, MEF, and NASLA. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 33). \n \nC. \n \n24. \nDespite progress in reducing poverty, 90% of the poor live in rural areas and their access \nto  basic  services  varies  greatly.35  A  high  maternal  mortality  ratio\u2014161  maternal  deaths  per \n100,000 live births\u2014indicates that the quality and coverage of basic health care  is insufficient. \nOnly 63% of the population has access to lower secondary education. The proposed SDP targets \nimprovements  in  service  delivery  to  local  populations.  It  is  categorized  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming.  The  gender  action  plan  includes:  (i)  the  integration  of  gender  and  disability \nconsiderations into the design and construction of NASLA; (ii) a curriculum that is inclusive and \nfree  of  gender  bias;  (iii)  a  target  of  30%  of  female  staff  to  receive  management  training;  and  \n(iv) gender-sensitive training for Ombudsman offices.36  \n \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n34 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n36 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the safeguard categories \n\nD. \n \n25. \nare as follows. \n \n26. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  Environmental  impacts  from  the  construction  of  NASLA\u2019s \ninfrastructure (training center and dormitory) are considered site-specific, minor, and reversible. \nThe localized impact from construction activities and traffic can be mitigated through effective site \npractice and management. The project site does not experience flooding. NASLA infrastructure \ndesign  incorporates  green  building  and  climate  resilience  principles.37  An  initial  environmental \nexamination  and  environmental  management  plan  were  completed.  Consultations  with \nstakeholders took place during project preparation and will continue during the detailed design \nand implementation.38 The policy actions are not anticipated to have any environmental impacts. \n \n27. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  people (category  C).  ADB\u2019s  due diligence \nconfirms the absence of any land acquisition and resettlement impact. All civil works are within \nthe boundaries of the NASLA complex on fenced-in, state-owned land in the Kouk Roka sangkat \nin Prek Pnoy District of Phnom Penh Municipality. The draft due diligence report was disclosed \non  ADB\u2019s  website.  The  PMU  will  establish  a  project-specific  grievance  redress  mechanism  to \nrecord  and  resolve  communities\u2019  concerns.  The  policy  actions  will  not  have  any  impact  on \ninvoluntary resettlement. Due diligence based on the preliminary design suggests that the project \nwill not impact any indigenous peoples as defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nE. \n \n28. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.39 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  5  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \n\nthe  government's \nUncertainty  over \nsustained  political, \nfinancial,  and \ninstitutional  support  for  D&D  reforms \ncould hamper the program outcomes. \n\nCountry level PFM system weaknesses \ninclude \nlimited  budget  credibility, \ninadequate access to fiscal information, \nand  limited  compliance  with  internal \ncontrols.
