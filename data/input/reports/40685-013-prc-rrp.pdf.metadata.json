I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Jiangsu  Yancheng  Wetlands  Protection \nProject.1 \n2.  The project will support the implementation by the Jiangsu provincial government (JPG) \nof  wetland  protection  and  biodiversity  conservation  in  the  coastal  areas  of  Yancheng \nmunicipality in northern Jiangsu. The proposal for Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing \nincludes five project outputs: (i) wetlands protection at the Yancheng Rare Birds National Nature \nReserve  (YRBNNR),  (ii)  wetlands  protection  at  the  Dafeng  Milu  National  Nature  Reserve \n(DMNNR), (iii) coastal forest improvement at the Sheyang Forest Farm (SFF), (iv) coastal forest \nimprovement at the Dafeng Forest Farm (DFF), and (v) project management and capacity \ndevelopment. Project preparatory technical assistance (TA) was provided.2  \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Importance of the Yancheng wetlands. With an area of 843,500 hectares (ha) of \ncoastal and seashore wetlands, accounting for 14.2% of the national total, Jiangsu Province \nranks third in this regard in the PRC. A significant portion of these wetlands are in Yancheng \nmunicipality, where they cover 453,000 ha (30% of the municipality\u2019s area) and stretch for 580 \nkilometers (km) along the coast. The Yancheng coastal wetlands consist primarily of extensive \nintertidal  mudflats,  tidal  creeks  and  river  channels,  salt  marshes,  reed  beds,  and  marshy \ngrasslands that provide desirable habitats for numerous species of flora and fauna of global and \nnational importance. \n4.  The coastal wetlands in Yancheng include two national nature reserves: the YRBNNR \nand the DMNNR. The YRBNNR is very rich in biodiversity, containing 480 species of plants, 370 \nof birds, 281 of fish, 48 of mammals, and 45 of amphibians. Twelve of its animal species are \nincluded on the country\u2019s first-ranked list for priority protection, and 29 of its bird species are \nlisted on the International Union of Conservation Nature\u2019s Red List of Threatened Species. The \nYRBNNR is one of the two wintering grounds in the PRC for the red-crowned crane (Grus \njaponensis), which is rated as endangered in the Red List of Threatened Species. About 60% of \nthe world\u2019s estimated 2,500 red-crowned cranes migrate every winter to the YRBNNR. The \nDMNNR is home to 25% of the world\u2019s population of milu deer (Elaphurus davidianus), which is \nrated as \u2015extinct in the wild\u2016 in the Red List of Threatened Species. The two national nature \nreserves are accredited to the List of Wetlands of International Importance under the Ramsar \nConvention,  recognizing  the  uniqueness  of  these  wetland  ecosystems  and  the  species \nbiodiversity that they harbor. The DFF and the SFF, neighboring the DMNNR and the YRBNNR \nrespectively, provide additional ecological protection to the two nature reserves and are part of \nthe national coastal ecological protection forest network. \n5.  The Yancheng wetlands provide important ecosystem services to local communities. \nLocal livelihoods are sustained through the gathering and culture of marine and estuarine plants \nand fish species. Wetland plants slow the flow of rivers, and the mudflats absorb wave energy \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic \nof China for Preparing the Jiangsu Yancheng Wetlands Protection Project. Manila (TA 7015-PRC, $650,000, \napproved 12 December 2008; supplementary TA of $80,000 approved 5 March 2010).  ", "2 \nfrom the Yellow Sea, thereby protecting against coastal erosion, tsunamis, and storm surges. \nWetlands  improve  water  quality  by  assimilating  some  of  Yancheng  municipality\u2019s  rapidly \nworsening pollution flowing from households and industry. They regulate the local climate and \nraise agricultural productivity. Finally, the two nature reserves, together with the two forest farms \ndesignated as provincial forest parks, attract hundreds of eco-tourists each year from around \nthe world, generating employment and income for local communities. The ecological services \nare  therefore  directly  linked  to  economic  development,  poverty  reduction,  and  livelihood \nenhancement for local communities. \n6.  Government response to threats to Yancheng wetlands. Despite their local, national, \nand global significance, Yancheng coastal wetlands suffer rapid degradation, wildlife habitat \nloss  and  fragmentation,  and  loss  of  biodiversity.  The  main  threats  to  the  coastal  wetland \necosystems  and  biodiversity  are  (i)  land-use  changes  from  reclamation  for  agriculture, \naquaculture, industry, and urban expansion; (ii) habitat degradation, especially in the core and \nbuffer zones; (iii) the rapid spread of invasive species, particularly Spartina alterniflora; (iv) \ndehydration; (v) pollution from terrestrial sources; and (vi) poaching. Since the 1980s, over half \nof the wildlife habitat has vanished, while the area of fishponds and built-up land has expanded \nby eight times. If no restoration or mitigation is undertaken to preserve and improve wetland \nmanagement, ecological degradation is expected to continue, risking the disappearance of the \nwetlands. The JPG is aware of the urgency of corrective action and has approved the DMNNR \nprotection master plan, 2008\u20132030 and the YRBNNR protection master plan, 2008\u20132020. \n7.  ADB\u2019s loan projects in the PRC for environment and natural resource management have \ngenerally been well implemented. Lessons from ecosystem and biodiversity protection projects \nsuch  as  at  Baiyangdian  Lake  and  the  Sanjiang  plain  wetlands  and  for  Shaanxi  Qinling \nbiodiversity protection were considered in policy dialogues with the government, the engineering \ndesigns of project facilities, and capacity development programs. Recent ADB reviews3 on \nreviving Tai Lake, Baiyangdian Lake, the Sanjiang plain wetlands, and West Lake suggested \nthat ecosystem protection, biodiversity conservation, and nature reserve management in the \nPRC are inadequately funded because society and the government fail to recognize the major \nexternalities associated with ecosystem restoration. It is therefore important to build sustainable \nfinancing  mechanisms  into  project  design  and  conduct  policy  dialogue  to  mainstream  the \nfinancing  of  nature  reserves  into  regular  government  budgets.  These  lessons  have  been \nincorporated  into  project  design.  First,  strong  interaction  between  project  preparatory  TA \nconsultants and ADB missions on the one hand and local design institutes on the other have \nsound engineering design for the intervention that directly removes the most serious threats and \nresponds to capacity development needs. Moreover, the project supports the development of a \npolicy framework on eco-compensation.4 Innovative features incorporated in project design\u2014\nincluding rehydrating wetlands, controlling invasive species, converting fishponds into wetlands, \nand instituting sustainable financing mechanisms including the innovative use of public finance \nand international financial institutions\u2019 lending5\u2014will generate knowledge products that can be \ndisseminated across the country and to other developing member countries. \n8.  The project supports the PRC\u2019s sustainable development agenda for an environment-\nfriendly, resource-efficient, and harmonious society, as outlined in the PRC\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2008. Reviving Lakes and Wetlands: Lessons Learned from the People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila.  \n4  Eco-compensation is an incentive system that supports sustainable ecosystems, provides stable financing for \nconservation, and can address livelihood issues for rural communities.  \n5  After dialogue on these two nature reserves, the JPG agreed in July 2010 to provide the counterpart financing and \ntake responsibility for loan repayment, considering the major externalities associated with the protection of these \ntwo nature reserves.  \n ", "3 \nPlan, 2011\u20132015. The project will finance the most important part of the nature reserves\u2019 master \nplans  and  the  forest  farms\u2019  twelfth  five-year  plans,  introducing  an  integrated  approach  to \naddress current constraints on wetland ecosystem protection. The project is consistent with the \nPRC  country  partnership  strategy,  2008\u20132010,  which  aims  at  supporting  environmental \nsustainability and inclusive growth.6  \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  project  impact  will  be  improved  ecosystem  health  and  services  in the coastal \nwetlands of Yancheng. The outcome will be improved capacity to manage and protect wetland \necosystems in Yancheng and improved livelihoods for local people. The project will protect \nbiodiversity,  identify  alternative  and  improved  livelihoods,  and  facilitate  local  residents\u2019 \nemployment and income generation.  \nC.  Outputs \n10.  The project will produce five major outputs. \n11.  Wetlands  protection  at  the  Yancheng  Rare  Birds  National  Nature  Reserve. \nInterventions toward this output are (i) restoring 540 ha of degraded wetland in the experimental \nzone; (ii) rehydrating 1,630 ha of dehydrated wetland in the core zone; (iii) converting 1,435 ha \nof fishponds into wetlands; (iv) piloting the control of invasive species, particularly 400 ha of \nSpartina alterniflora; (v) constructing wetland protection infrastructure, including patrol roads \nand  stations  and  waste-management  facilities;  (vi)  improving  wildlife  protection  with  the \nestablishment of a rescue, breeding, and disease control center; (vii) establishing a wetland and \nbiodiversity research laboratory and monitoring sites; and (viii) establishing a public education \ncenter and a community co-management center. \n12.

JPG will onlend the remaining loan proceeds8 to the Yancheng municipal government \n(YMG) which will grant these loan proceeds to SFF for coastal forest improvement output and to \nthe Dafeng city government (DCG) which will grant these loan proceeds to DFF for coastal \nforest improvement output. Each onlending will be undertaken on the terms and conditions \nspecified in the loan and project agreements. \n20.  A grant of $2.5 million from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) was included in the \nMarch 2010 GEF intersessional work program. The approved GEF Project Identification Form \nproposes  the  following  outputs  for  the  proposed  cofinancing  of  the  project:  (i)  wetland \nrestoration and biodiversity conservation, (ii) sustainable natural resource management and \nsustainable  livelihoods,  (iii)  ecological  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  (iv)  environmental \ngovernance. Subject to GEF approval, the ADB-administered cofinancing may be processed in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s operational procedures. \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  The project will be implemented over 5 years from July 2012 to June 2017. The JPG will \nbe the executing agency, assuming oversight responsibilities and ensuring coordination among \nJPG agencies, such as the environmental protection, finance, forestry, and water resource \nbureaus  and  the  development  and  reform  commission.  The  YMG  will  assist  the  JPG  in \ncoordinating  and  supervising  project  implementation.  The  implementing  agencies  are  the \nJiangsu Environmental Protection Department (JEPD) for wetlands protection at the YRBNNR, \nthe Jiangsu Forestry Bureau for wetlands protection at the DMNNR, the YMG for coastal forest \nimprovement at the SFF, and the DCG for coastal forest improvement at the DFF. The Jiangsu \nPMO has been established at the JEPD to be responsible for planning, coordinating, and \nsupervising the project. A municipal PMO has been established in the YMG to perform tasks \ndelegated by the Jiangsu PMO. PMO has also been established at the city level to coordinate \nproject implementation on behalf of the DCG. Further, PIUs  have been established in the \nYRBNNR, DMNNR, DFF and SFF for day-to-day implementation. The capacity of the PMOs \nand PIUs has been assessed and a capacity-strengthening plan included in consulting service \nrequirements.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n22.  Due diligence assessed the technical feasibility and sustainability of the project. The \ntechnical designs of the project and its outputs have been aligned with sector strategies and \npriorities9 and have incorporated international and national best practices. The implementation \nschedule and project management arrangements have been assessed as being appropriate. \nThe operation of project facilities will be undertaken by the nature reserves and forest farms \nthemselves,  which,  with  capacity  strengthening,  will  have  adequate  professional  operators. \nInternational consulting services will provide technical support to ensure that (i) ADB and PRC \nsafeguard policies and regulations are fully complied with; and (ii) procurement and contract \nmanagement, financial management, fund withdrawal and disbursement, and reporting accord \nwith ADB and PRC requirements. Project design has a number of innovative features, including \n                                                \n9 Sector Assessment: Agriculture and Natural Resources (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nwetland rehydration and restoration, the conversion of fishponds into wetlands, the control of \ninvasive  species,  eco-compensation,  and  community  co-management,  which  can  generate \nknowledge products for wider dissemination.  \nB.  Economic and Financial \n23.  Economic  analysis  indicates that the  project  is  economically  viable,  with  an  overall \neconomic internal rate of return of 14.87% and an economic net present value of CNY127.50 \nmillion.  The  rates  of  return  for  individual  outputs  range  from  13.61%  for  coastal  forest \nimprovement at the SFF to 21.70% for coastal forest improvement at the DFF. Sensitivity \nanalysis shows that the project is generally robust to potential variations in costs and benefits. \nAs the outputs are nonrevenue, financial analysis focuses on the fiscal impact of the project on \ngovernments. The annual counterpart financing requirement during project implementation is, \nas  a  ratio  of  the  projected  government  annual  revenues,  ranges  from  0.02%  to  0.55%. \nEstimated annual loan repayment falls within the range of 0.00% and 0.11%. These low ratios \nindicate acceptable fiscal risk.10 Assessments of the financial management and institutional \ncapacity  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  and  PIUs  have  concluded  that their \nfinancial management systems satisfy ADB requirements, though gaps have been identified. \nThe existing financial management systems of PIUs in particular meet the general requirements \nof the government in terms of staffing, accounting, and internal control. However, PIUs need \ntechnical support to strengthen their capacity to implement the project in compliance with ADB \npolicies and operational and procedural requirements, which consultants will provide. \nC.  Governance \n24.  Financial  management  assessment  shows  that,  with  capacity  strengthening  by \nconsultants,  the  provincial,  municipal,  district,  city,  nature reserve,  and forest farm finance \ndepartments, bureaus, and units will be able to report on accounting and finances to satisfy \nproject  needs.  The  offices  of  the  finance  inspector,  key  project  inspector,  and  discipline \nsupervisor in these organizations will perform part of the internal auditor\u2019s function in internal \ncontrol systems. Procurement capacity assessment indicated that (i) the JPG has successfully \nimplemented many projects financed by international development institutions, particularly ADB \nand the World Bank; (ii) the DCG, JPG, YMG, and the Tinghu District government (TDG) will \nestablish arrangements for coordinating the various stages of procurement, including preparing \nbid documents, inviting tenders, evaluating bids, awarding contracts, supervising construction, \nand monitoring contract performance monitoring; and (iii) PIUs will engage, through the Jiangsu \nPMO,  a  professional  procurement  agency  that  is  experienced  in  managing  procurement \nprocesses financed by international development institutions, and technical assistance will be \nprovided by loan implementation consultants. Procurement capacity assessment undertaken \nduring project preparation confirmed that the executing and implementing agencies and PIUs, \nacting  through  the  procurement  agency  and  with  the  assistance  of  ADB  and  the  project \nconsultants, are capable of carrying out procurement under the project, including advance \ncontracting. However, as the DCG, TDG, YMG, and PIUs have not yet implemented any ADB-\nfinanced projects and are unfamiliar with ADB policies, guidelines, and procedural requirements, \nADB will assist and train them in project management. \n25.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the DCG, TDG, JPG, YMG, and PIUs. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \nwill be included in all documents and contracts relating to the procurement of works and goods \n                                                \n10  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nand  the  engagement  of  consultants.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 7). \nD.  Poverty and Social Dimensions \n26.  The project will create 500 person-years of direct employment and 1,500 person-years \nof indirect employment during construction, with estimated total earnings of $16.1 million. It will \ngenerate 150 jobs directly and 400 indirectly during project operation, with estimated annual \nearnings of $4.3 million. It will trigger the creation of off-farm labor opportunities for surrounding \ncommunities  in  eco-tourism.  Training  for  off-farm  employment  will  be  provided  to  project \nbeneficiaries, especially women and other vulnerable groups. Women will benefit from about \n31%  of  the  jobs  during  construction  and  at  least  50%  of  them  during  operation.  Project \nimplementation will respect core labor standards, and implementing agencies and contractors \nwill respect national regulations. The influx of construction workers to the area demands raising \nworker and public awareness of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. The project \nis  classified  as \u2015effective gender mainstreaming\u2016  under  ADB\u2019s  project gender  classification \nsystem. A gender action plan to maximize gender benefits has been prepared to ensure that (i) \nwomen benefit from the project; (ii) women participate in training, particularly on off-farm skills \ndevelopment, and that their particular requirements regarding trainings are taken into account; \nand (iii) women benefit from directly and indirectly generated jobs, especially if they are among \nthe households affected by livelihood changes.11  A summary poverty reduction and social \nstrategy containing poverty and social impacts and mitigation measures has been developed.12  \nE.  Safeguards \n27.  Environmental assessment. The project is classified as category A for environment in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  A  consolidated  national \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) report for the overall project and an EIA report for each \nof the four proposed structural outputs have been prepared by certified EIA institutes. During the \nEIA, adequate consultations were conducted with stakeholders, including national and local \ngovernment  agencies,  local  communities,  and  national  and  international  nongovernment \norganizations. The outcomes of the consultations have been integrated into project design. The \ndomestic EIA reports have been reviewed by a panel of 10 national experts. The revised EIA \nreports have been approved by the Ministry of Environmental Protection. A draft project EIA \nreport  in  English13 was  prepared  by  the JPG  with  assistance from  project  preparatory TA \nconsultants and posted on the ADB website on 12 August 2011. An essential part of the project \nEIA report, the environmental management plan (EMP), includes impact mitigation measures, \nan  environmental  monitoring  program,  a  grievance  redress  mechanism,  and  a  public \nconsultation plan. The JPG and the YMG will be jointly accountable for implementing the EMP \nand  compliance  with  it,  including  inspection, monitoring, mitigation, reporting,  and  initiating \ncorrective actions. The DCG, JPG, TDG, and YMG will be responsible for implementing the \ngrievance redress mechanism. The institutional capacity of the DCG, JPG, TDG, and YMG to \nimplement  the  EMP  and  ensure  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  is \nconsidered adequate with institutional capacity strengthening by consults. \n28.  The project is expected to achieve significant environmental benefits: (i) restoring and \nprotecting wetlands of international and national importance; (ii) conserving biodiversity of global \nsignificance by protecting endangered species; (iii) improving the national coastal ecological \n                                                \n11  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13  Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nprotection forest network; (iv) increasing carbon sequestration; (v) enhancing the resilience \nunder climate change of local communities, particularly against the threat of tsunamis and storm \nsurges; and (vi) reducing coastal pollution. Possible adverse environmental impacts and risks \nduring construction are noise, air, and water pollution; solid waste mismanagement; soil borrow \nand spoil; and their possible effects on protected species and their habitats. Major potential \nimpacts for the two nature reserves and the two forest farms during operation will be noise from \nwater pumps; noise, water, and solid waste pollution from the operation of the other project \nfacilities  (e.g.,  the  wetland  science  education  center,  research,  and  monitoring);  and  their \npossible effects on the protected species and their habitats. All impacts are expected to be \nprevented  or  acceptably  minimized  by  effectively  implementing  the  EMP  and  monitoring \nprogram. Additional specific assurances related to upstream pollution control and  the safe \ntransfer of milu deer to the third core zone and/or other protected sites have been agreed with \nthe JPG to ensure that project outcomes are sustained. \n29.  Indigenous  peoples  and  involuntary  resettlement.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement, the project is classified as category C for indigenous peoples and \ncategory  A  for  involuntary  resettlement.  The  population  in  the  project  area  is  ethnically \nhomogenous mainstream Han. The nonrenewal of land use leases for 1,235 ha of land expiring \nbefore the commencement of the project will see 493 people in 156 households economically \ndisplaced. The livelihoods of these people will be safeguarded by providing new land leases, \nand additional measures will be undertaken as necessary. Detailed mitigation and livelihood \nrestoration  measures,  including  training  for  alternative  employment,  are  outlined  in  the \nresettlement  plan.14 The  Jiangsu  PMO  and  the  local  PMOs  and  PIUs  are  responsible  for \npreparing, reviewing, financing, implementing, monitoring, and reporting on resettlement. The \nJiangsu PMO will engage an agency for external monitoring. Loan implementation consultants \nwill develop the capacity of offices responsible for implementing the resettlement plan and of the \nexternal monitoring agency. A grievance redress mechanism has been established to provide \naffected people with sequential steps to follow in case of grievance. Affected people have been \ninformed of the measures in the resettlement plan and grievance steps through public meetings \nand other means to ensure that they are aware of their entitlements and legal rights.  \nF.  Risks and Mitigation Measures \n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures have been identified. They are summarized in \nTable  4  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.15 In \nconclusion, with mitigation measures, the risks will be reduced to an acceptable level. \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nEconomic slowdown puts greater  Project design includes institutional strengthening on regulatory \ndevelopment pressure on wetlands.  enforcement, policy and sector mainstreaming, and sustainable \nfinancing mechanisms.

ASSURANCES  \n31.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project will conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \n(footnote 7) and loan documents. The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants \nfor the project, which are set forth in the loan and project agreements. \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n32.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the loan of $36,900,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Jiangsu Yancheng \nWetlands  Protection  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  loan  and  project \nagreements presented to the Board. \nBindu N.
