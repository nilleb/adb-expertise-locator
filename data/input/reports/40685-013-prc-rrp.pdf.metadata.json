The  proposal  for  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  financing \nincludes five project outputs: (i) wetlands protection at the Yancheng Rare Birds National Nature \nReserve  (YRBNNR),  (ii)  wetlands  protection  at  the  Dafeng  Milu  National  Nature  Reserve \n(DMNNR), (iii) coastal forest improvement at the Sheyang Forest Farm (SFF), (iv) coastal forest \nimprovement  at  the  Dafeng  Forest  Farm  (DFF),  and  (v)  project  management  and  capacity \ndevelopment. Project preparatory technical assistance (TA) was provided.2  \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n3. \nImportance  of  the  Yancheng  wetlands.  With  an  area  of  843,500  hectares  (ha)  of \ncoastal  and  seashore  wetlands,  accounting  for  14.2%  of  the  national  total,  Jiangsu  Province \nranks  third  in  this  regard  in  the  PRC.  A  significant  portion  of  these  wetlands  are  in  Yancheng \nmunicipality, where they cover 453,000 ha (30% of the municipality\u2019s area) and stretch for 580 \nkilometers (km) along the coast. The Yancheng coastal wetlands consist primarily of extensive \nintertidal  mudflats,  tidal  creeks  and  river  channels,  salt  marshes,  reed  beds,  and  marshy \ngrasslands that provide desirable habitats for numerous species of flora and fauna of global and \nnational importance. \n\nThe  coastal  wetlands  in  Yancheng  include  two  national  nature  reserves:  the  YRBNNR \n4. \nand the DMNNR. The YRBNNR is very rich in biodiversity, containing 480 species of plants, 370 \nof  birds,  281  of  fish,  48  of  mammals,  and  45  of  amphibians.  Twelve  of  its  animal  species  are \nincluded  on  the  country\u2019s  first-ranked  list  for  priority  protection,  and  29  of  its  bird  species  are \nlisted on the International Union of Conservation Nature\u2019s Red List of Threatened Species. The \nYRBNNR  is  one  of  the  two  wintering  grounds  in  the  PRC  for  the  red-crowned  crane  (Grus \njaponensis), which is rated as endangered in the Red List of Threatened Species. About 60% of \nthe  world\u2019s  estimated  2,500  red-crowned  cranes  migrate  every  winter  to  the  YRBNNR.  The \nDMNNR is home to 25% of the world\u2019s population of milu deer (Elaphurus davidianus), which is \nrated  as  \u2015extinct  in  the  wild\u2016  in  the  Red  List  of  Threatened  Species.  The  two  national  nature \nreserves  are  accredited  to  the  List  of Wetlands  of  International  Importance  under  the  Ramsar \nConvention,  recognizing  the  uniqueness  of  these  wetland  ecosystems  and  the  species \nbiodiversity that they harbor. The DFF and the SFF, neighboring the DMNNR and the YRBNNR \nrespectively, provide additional ecological protection to the two nature reserves and are part of \nthe national coastal ecological protection forest network. \n\nThe  Yancheng  wetlands  provide  important  ecosystem  services  to  local  communities. \n5. \nLocal livelihoods are sustained through the gathering and culture of marine and estuarine plants \nand fish species. Wetland plants slow the flow of rivers, and the mudflats absorb wave energy \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic \nof  China  for  Preparing  the  Jiangsu  Yancheng  Wetlands  Protection  Project.  Manila  (TA  7015-PRC,  $650,000, \napproved 12 December 2008; supplementary TA of $80,000 approved 5 March 2010).  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nfrom  the  Yellow  Sea,  thereby  protecting  against  coastal  erosion,  tsunamis,  and  storm  surges. \nWetlands  improve  water  quality  by  assimilating  some  of  Yancheng  municipality\u2019s  rapidly \nworsening  pollution flowing from  households  and  industry. They regulate the  local  climate  and \nraise agricultural productivity. Finally, the two nature reserves, together with the two forest farms \ndesignated  as  provincial  forest  parks,  attract  hundreds  of  eco-tourists  each  year  from  around \nthe  world,  generating  employment  and  income  for  local  communities.  The  ecological  services \nare  therefore  directly  linked  to  economic  development,  poverty  reduction,  and  livelihood \nenhancement for local communities. \n\n6. \nGovernment response to threats to Yancheng wetlands. Despite their local, national, \nand  global  significance,  Yancheng  coastal  wetlands  suffer  rapid  degradation,  wildlife  habitat \nloss  and  fragmentation,  and  loss  of  biodiversity.  The  main  threats  to  the  coastal  wetland \necosystems  and  biodiversity  are  (i)  land-use  changes  from  reclamation  for  agriculture, \naquaculture, industry, and urban expansion; (ii) habitat degradation, especially in the core and \nbuffer  zones;  (iii)  the  rapid  spread  of  invasive  species,  particularly  Spartina  alterniflora;  (iv) \ndehydration; (v) pollution from terrestrial sources; and (vi) poaching. Since the 1980s, over half \nof the wildlife habitat has vanished, while the area of fishponds and built-up land has expanded \nby  eight  times.  If  no  restoration  or  mitigation  is  undertaken  to  preserve  and  improve  wetland \nmanagement, ecological degradation is expected to continue, risking the disappearance of the \nwetlands. The JPG is aware of the urgency of corrective action and has approved the DMNNR \nprotection master plan, 2008\u20132030 and the YRBNNR protection master plan, 2008\u20132020. \n\n7. \nADB\u2019s loan projects in the PRC for environment and natural resource management have \ngenerally been well implemented. Lessons from ecosystem and biodiversity protection projects \nsuch  as  at  Baiyangdian  Lake  and  the  Sanjiang  plain  wetlands  and  for  Shaanxi  Qinling \nbiodiversity protection were considered in policy dialogues with the government, the engineering \ndesigns  of  project  facilities,  and  capacity  development  programs.  Recent  ADB  reviews 3 on \nreviving  Tai  Lake,  Baiyangdian  Lake,  the  Sanjiang  plain  wetlands,  and  West  Lake  suggested \nthat  ecosystem  protection,  biodiversity  conservation,  and  nature  reserve  management  in  the \nPRC are inadequately funded because society and the government fail to recognize the major \nexternalities associated with ecosystem restoration. It is therefore important to build sustainable \nfinancing  mechanisms  into  project  design  and  conduct  policy  dialogue  to  mainstream  the \nfinancing  of  nature  reserves  into  regular  government  budgets.  These  lessons  have  been \nincorporated  into  project  design.  First,  strong  interaction  between  project  preparatory  TA \nconsultants  and  ADB  missions  on  the  one  hand  and  local  design  institutes  on  the  other  have \nsound engineering design for the intervention that directly removes the most serious threats and \nresponds to capacity development needs. Moreover, the project supports the development of a \npolicy  framework  on  eco-compensation.4 Innovative  features  incorporated  in  project  design\u2014\nincluding rehydrating wetlands, controlling invasive species, converting fishponds into wetlands, \nand instituting sustainable financing mechanisms including the innovative use of public finance \nand  international  financial  institutions\u2019  lending5\u2014will  generate knowledge  products  that  can  be \ndisseminated across the country and to other developing member countries. \n\n8. \nThe  project  supports  the  PRC\u2019s  sustainable  development  agenda  for  an  environment-\nfriendly, resource-efficient, and harmonious society, as outlined in the PRC\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year \n\n                                                \n3  ADB. 2008. Reviving Lakes and Wetlands: Lessons Learned from the People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila.  \n4   Eco-compensation  is  an  incentive  system  that  supports  sustainable  ecosystems,  provides  stable  financing  for \n\nconservation, and can address livelihood issues for rural communities.  \n\n5  After dialogue on these two nature reserves, the JPG agreed in July 2010 to provide the counterpart financing and \ntake responsibility for loan repayment, considering the major externalities associated with the protection of these \ntwo nature reserves.  \n\n\fPlan, 2011\u20132015. The project will finance the most important part of the nature reserves\u2019 master \nplans  and  the  forest  farms\u2019  twelfth  five-year  plans,  introducing  an  integrated  approach  to \naddress current constraints on wetland ecosystem protection. The project is consistent with the \nPRC  country  partnership  strategy,  2008\u20132010,  which  aims  at  supporting  environmental \nsustainability and inclusive growth.6  \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  project  impact  will  be  improved  ecosystem  health  and  services  in  the  coastal \n9. \nwetlands of Yancheng. The outcome will be improved capacity to manage and protect wetland \necosystems  in  Yancheng  and  improved  livelihoods  for  local  people.  The  project  will  protect \nbiodiversity,  identify  alternative  and  improved  livelihoods,  and  facilitate  local  residents\u2019 \nemployment and income generation.  \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n10. \n\nThe project will produce five major outputs. \n\n11.

A  municipal  PMO  has  been  established  in  the  YMG  to  perform  tasks \ndelegated by the Jiangsu PMO. PMO has also been established at the city level to coordinate \nproject  implementation  on  behalf  of  the  DCG.  Further,  PIUs  have  been  established  in  the \nYRBNNR,  DMNNR,  DFF  and  SFF  for  day-to-day  implementation.  The  capacity  of  the  PMOs \nand PIUs has been assessed and a capacity-strengthening plan included in consulting service \nrequirements.  The  implementation  arrangements  are  summarized  in  Table  3  and  described  in \ndetail in the PAM (footnote 7). \n\n                                                \n8 Amount of each grant and onlending is provided in the PAM. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nAspects \n\nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n\n(ii)   Executing agency  \n(iii)  Key implementing \n\nagencies \n\n(iv) Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services  \n\nAdvance contracting and \nretroactive financing  \n\nDisbursement  \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements \n\nJuly 2012\u2013June 2017 (5 years) \n30 June 2017 (closing date: 31 December 2017) \n\nJPG, responsible for ensuring coordination among government agencies \nsuch as the JEPD, Jiangsu Finance Department, Jiangsu Forestry Bureau, \nand Jiangsu provincial development and reform commission \nJPG, with a project management office established in the JEPD \nJEPD for wetlands protection at the YRBNNR; the Jiangsu Forestry Bureau \nfor wetlands protection at the DMNNR; the Yancheng municipal \ngovernment for coastal forest improvement at the SFF; and the Dafeng city \ngovernment for coastal forest improvement at the DFF.  \nProject implementation units have been set up at the YRBNNR, DMNNR, \nDFF and SFF. \nNational competitive bidding \nShopping \nQuality- and cost-based \nselection (80:20), to be \nengaged through a firm \nThe JPG has requested advance contracting and retroactive financing for \ncontract packages covering consulting services and two contract packages \nfor wetlands protection at the YRBNNR totaling $5.88 million. The JPG has \nbeen advised that retroactive financing can be applied only up to a \nmaximum equivalent to 20% of the total ADB loan with respect to \nexpenditures incurred before loan effectiveness but not more than 12 \nmonths before the signing of the loan agreement. \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between ADB and the government. \n\n25 contracts \n4 contracts \n8 person-months \n(international); 34 person-\nmonths (national) \n\n$48.66 million \n$0.21 million \n$0.55 million \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  DFF  =  Dafeng  Forest  Farm,  DMNNR  =  Dafeng  Milu  National  Nature  Reserve, \nJEPD = Jiangsu Environmental Protection Department, JPG = Jiangsu provincial government, SFF = Sheyang Forest \nFarm, YRBNNR = Yancheng Rare Birds National Nature Reserve. \nSource: ADB. \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n22. \nDue  diligence  assessed  the  technical  feasibility  and  sustainability  of  the  project.  The \ntechnical  designs  of  the  project  and  its  outputs  have  been  aligned  with  sector  strategies  and \npriorities9 and  have  incorporated  international  and  national  best  practices.  The  implementation \nschedule  and  project  management  arrangements  have  been  assessed  as  being  appropriate. \nThe  operation  of  project  facilities  will  be  undertaken  by  the  nature  reserves  and  forest  farms \nthemselves,  which,  with  capacity  strengthening,  will  have  adequate  professional  operators. \nInternational consulting services will provide technical support to ensure that (i) ADB and PRC \nsafeguard  policies  and  regulations  are  fully  complied  with;  and  (ii)  procurement  and  contract \nmanagement, financial management, fund  withdrawal  and disbursement,  and reporting  accord \nwith ADB and PRC requirements. Project design has a number of innovative features, including \n\n                                                \n9 Sector Assessment: Agriculture and Natural Resources (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fwetland  rehydration  and  restoration,  the  conversion  of  fishponds  into  wetlands,  the  control  of \ninvasive  species,  eco-compensation,  and  community  co-management,  which  can  generate \nknowledge products for wider dissemination.  \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n23. \nEconomic  analysis  indicates  that  the  project  is  economically  viable,  with  an  overall \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  of  14.87%  and  an  economic  net  present  value  of  CNY127.50 \nmillion.  The  rates  of  return  for  individual  outputs  range  from  13.61%  for  coastal  forest \nimprovement  at  the  SFF  to  21.70%  for  coastal  forest  improvement  at  the  DFF.  Sensitivity \nanalysis shows that the project is generally robust to potential variations in costs and benefits. \nAs the outputs are nonrevenue, financial analysis focuses on the fiscal impact of the project on \ngovernments.  The  annual  counterpart  financing  requirement  during  project  implementation  is, \nas  a  ratio  of  the  projected  government  annual  revenues,  ranges  from  0.02%  to  0.55%. \nEstimated annual loan repayment falls within the range of 0.00% and 0.11%. These low ratios \nindicate  acceptable  fiscal  risk. 10 Assessments  of  the  financial  management  and  institutional \ncapacity  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  and  PIUs  have  concluded  that  their \nfinancial  management  systems  satisfy  ADB  requirements,  though  gaps  have  been  identified. \nThe existing financial management systems of PIUs in particular meet the general requirements \nof  the  government  in  terms  of  staffing,  accounting,  and  internal  control.  However,  PIUs  need \ntechnical support to strengthen their capacity to implement the project in compliance with ADB \npolicies and operational and procedural requirements, which consultants will provide. \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nFinancial  management  assessment  shows \n\n24. \nthat,  with  capacity  strengthening  by \nconsultants,  the  provincial,  municipal,  district,  city,  nature  reserve,  and  forest  farm  finance \ndepartments,  bureaus,  and  units  will  be  able  to  report  on  accounting  and  finances  to  satisfy \nproject  needs.  The  offices  of  the  finance  inspector,  key  project  inspector,  and  discipline \nsupervisor  in  these  organizations  will  perform  part  of  the  internal  auditor\u2019s  function  in  internal \ncontrol systems. Procurement capacity assessment indicated that (i)  the JPG has successfully \nimplemented many projects financed by international development institutions, particularly ADB \nand  the World  Bank;  (ii)  the  DCG,  JPG,  YMG,  and  the  Tinghu  District  government  (TDG)  will \nestablish arrangements for coordinating the various stages of procurement, including preparing \nbid  documents,  inviting  tenders,  evaluating  bids,  awarding  contracts,  supervising  construction, \nand monitoring contract performance monitoring; and (iii) PIUs will engage, through the Jiangsu \nPMO,  a  professional  procurement  agency  that  is  experienced  in  managing  procurement \nprocesses  financed  by  international  development  institutions,  and  technical  assistance  will  be \nprovided  by  loan  implementation  consultants.  Procurement  capacity  assessment  undertaken \nduring  project  preparation  confirmed  that  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  and  PIUs, \nacting  through  the  procurement  agency  and  with  the  assistance  of  ADB  and  the  project \nconsultants,  are  capable  of  carrying  out  procurement  under  the  project,  including  advance \ncontracting. However, as the DCG, TDG, YMG, and PIUs have not yet implemented any ADB-\nfinanced projects and are unfamiliar with ADB policies, guidelines, and procedural requirements, \nADB will assist and train them in project management. \n\n25. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the DCG, TDG, JPG, YMG, and PIUs. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \nwill be included in all documents and contracts relating to the procurement of works and goods \n\n                                                \n10  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nand  the  engagement  of  consultants.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 7). \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social Dimensions \n\n26. \nThe  project  will  create  500  person-years  of  direct  employment  and  1,500  person-years \nof indirect employment during construction, with estimated total earnings of $16.1 million. It will \ngenerate  150  jobs  directly  and  400  indirectly  during  project  operation,  with  estimated  annual \nearnings of $4.3 million. It will trigger the creation of off-farm labor opportunities for surrounding \ncommunities  in  eco-tourism.  Training  for  off-farm  employment  will  be  provided  to  project \nbeneficiaries,  especially  women  and  other  vulnerable  groups.  Women  will  benefit  from  about \n31%  of  the  jobs  during  construction  and  at  least  50%  of  them  during  operation.  Project \nimplementation  will  respect  core  labor  standards,  and  implementing  agencies  and  contractors \nwill respect national regulations. The influx of construction workers to the area demands raising \nworker and public awareness of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. The project \nis  classified  as  \u2015effective  gender  mainstreaming\u2016  under  ADB\u2019s  project  gender  classification \nsystem. A gender action plan to maximize gender benefits has been prepared to ensure that (i) \nwomen benefit from the project; (ii)  women participate in training, particularly on off-farm skills \ndevelopment, and that their particular requirements regarding trainings are taken into account; \nand (iii) women benefit from directly and indirectly generated jobs, especially if they are among \nthe  households  affected  by  livelihood  changes. 11   A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social \nstrategy containing poverty and social impacts and mitigation measures has been developed.12  \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n27. \nEnvironmental  assessment. The project is classified as category A for environment in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  A  consolidated  national \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) report for the overall project and an EIA report for each \nof the four proposed structural outputs have been prepared by certified EIA institutes. During the \nEIA,  adequate  consultations  were  conducted  with  stakeholders,  including  national  and  local \ngovernment  agencies,  local  communities,  and  national  and  international  nongovernment \norganizations. The outcomes of the consultations have been integrated into project design. The \ndomestic  EIA  reports  have  been  reviewed  by  a  panel  of  10  national  experts.  The  revised  EIA \nreports  have  been  approved  by  the  Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection.  A  draft  project  EIA \nreport  in  English 13  was  prepared  by  the  JPG  with  assistance  from  project  preparatory  TA \nconsultants and posted on the ADB website on 12 August 2011. An essential part of the project \nEIA  report,  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP),  includes  impact  mitigation  measures, \nan  environmental  monitoring  program,  a  grievance  redress  mechanism,  and  a  public \nconsultation plan. The JPG and the YMG will be jointly accountable for implementing the EMP \nand  compliance  with  it,  including  inspection,  monitoring,  mitigation,  reporting,  and  initiating \ncorrective  actions.  The  DCG,  JPG,  TDG,  and  YMG  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the \ngrievance  redress  mechanism.  The  institutional  capacity  of  the  DCG,  JPG,  TDG,  and  YMG  to \nimplement  the  EMP  and  ensure  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  is \nconsidered adequate with institutional capacity strengthening by consults. \n\n28. \nThe  project  is  expected  to  achieve  significant  environmental  benefits:  (i)  restoring  and \nprotecting wetlands of international and national importance; (ii) conserving biodiversity of global \nsignificance  by  protecting  endangered  species;  (iii)  improving  the  national  coastal  ecological \n                                                \n11  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13  Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fprotection  forest  network;  (iv)  increasing  carbon  sequestration;  (v)  enhancing  the  resilience \nunder climate change of local communities, particularly against the threat of tsunamis and storm \nsurges;  and  (vi)  reducing  coastal  pollution.  Possible  adverse  environmental  impacts  and  risks \nduring construction are noise, air, and water pollution; solid waste mismanagement; soil borrow \nand  spoil;  and  their  possible  effects  on  protected  species  and  their  habitats.  Major  potential \nimpacts for the two nature reserves and the two forest farms during operation will be noise from \nwater  pumps;  noise,  water,  and  solid  waste  pollution  from  the  operation  of  the  other  project \nfacilities  (e.g.,  the  wetland  science  education  center,  research,  and  monitoring);  and  their \npossible  effects  on  the  protected  species  and  their  habitats.  All  impacts  are  expected  to  be \nprevented  or  acceptably  minimized  by  effectively  implementing  the  EMP  and  monitoring \nprogram.  Additional  specific  assurances  related  to  upstream  pollution  control  and  the  safe \ntransfer of milu deer to the third core zone and/or other protected sites have been agreed with \nthe JPG to ensure that project outcomes are sustained. \n\n29. \nIndigenous  peoples  and  involuntary  resettlement.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement, the project is classified as category C for indigenous peoples and \ncategory  A  for  involuntary  resettlement.  The  population  in  the  project  area  is  ethnically \nhomogenous mainstream Han. The nonrenewal of land use leases for 1,235 ha of land expiring \nbefore  the  commencement  of  the  project  will  see  493  people  in  156  households  economically \ndisplaced.  The  livelihoods  of  these  people  will  be  safeguarded  by  providing  new  land  leases, \nand  additional  measures  will  be  undertaken  as  necessary.  Detailed  mitigation  and  livelihood \nrestoration  measures,  including  training  for  alternative  employment,  are  outlined  in  the \nresettlement  plan. 14  The  Jiangsu  PMO  and  the  local  PMOs  and  PIUs  are  responsible  for \npreparing,  reviewing,  financing,  implementing,  monitoring,  and  reporting  on  resettlement.  The \nJiangsu PMO will engage an agency for external monitoring.  Loan implementation consultants \nwill develop the capacity of offices responsible for implementing the resettlement plan and of the \nexternal  monitoring  agency.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  has  been  established  to  provide \naffected people with sequential steps to follow in case of grievance. Affected people have been \ninformed of the measures in the resettlement plan and grievance steps through public meetings \nand other means to ensure that they are aware of their entitlements and legal rights.  \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigation Measures \n\n30.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  have  been  identified.  They  are  summarized  in \nTable  4  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 15  In \nconclusion, with mitigation measures, the risks will be reduced to an acceptable level. \n\nRisks \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigating Measures \n\nEconomic slowdown puts greater \ndevelopment pressure on wetlands. \n\nNature reserve master plans and \nforest farm five-year plans are not \neffectively implemented. \nSome stakeholders may resist \nparticipating in conservation and \nprotection. \n\nProject design includes institutional strengthening on regulatory \nenforcement, policy and sector mainstreaming, and sustainable \nfinancing mechanisms. They will help minimize the pressure. \nGEF financing has a component to establish sustainable financing \nmechanisms and strengthen institutional capacity to develop and \nimplement management plans. \nInformation dissemination, education, and consultations \nthroughout project implementation are incorporated into project \ndesign to ensure ownership and buy-in by key stakeholders. \n\n                                                \n14 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nEcological compensation promoted by the government and under \nGEF financing will provide additional incentives. \nCapacity assessment was undertaken and gaps identified. \nTargeted training will be provided by ADB officers prior to project \nimplementation and by consultants during project implementation. \n\nLocal PMOs and/or PIUs lack \ncapacity in procurement, financial, \nand contract management and \nsupervision. \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  GEF  =  Global  Environment  Facility,  PIU  =  project  implementation  unit,  PMO  = \nproject management office. \nSource: ADB. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n31. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project will conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \n(footnote 7) and loan documents.
