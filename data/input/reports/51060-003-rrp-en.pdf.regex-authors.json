THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased loan to Armenia for subprogram 2 of the Public Efficiency and Financial Markets Program \n(PEFMP). \n \n2.  The proposed program is the second of two subprograms of the current programmatic \nassistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Armenia.1 The program helps (i) strengthen \npublic debt and fiscal risk management, in support of the authorities\u2019 fiscal consolidation efforts \nand attempts to reduce financial risks in the economy; (ii) improve money market liquidity and \nfinancial market transparency, by deepening the government securities market and improving the \ninfrastructure for money markets; and (iii) foster the development of corporate debt and equity \nmarkets by enhancing corporate transparency and developing legislative frameworks for new \ninstruments and investment vehicles. Subprogram 1 ($40 million) was approved in October 2017.2 \nSubprogram 2 is for $50 million.3 \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n3.  Macroeconomic context. Real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by more than \n7% in 2017, in sharp contrast to 0.2% growth in 2016, mostly driven by mining-related and other \nmanufacturing activities.4 Construction returned to growth following years of contraction, and \nremittance flows from Armenians working in the Russian Federation supported the growth spurt \nin wholesale and retail trade and other services.5 The growth in remittances will likely slow down \nin 2018; and a pickup in inflation will hit real wages, likely affecting demand for services. The \nexpansion of exports of 2017 is also unlikely to be sustained, given the weaker forecast growth \nfor copper prices in 2018. This might constrain mining investments. In 2018, real GDP growth is \nexpected to decelerate to about 3%\u20134%, more in line with Armenia\u2019s potential output growth. \n \n4.  Potential output growth in Armenia is partly limited by low levels of investment, which \ndeclined from about 40% of GDP before the financial crisis (much of it fueled by the pre-2009 \ncapital-inflow and credit-induced construction boom) to less than 18% in 2017. This contraction \nin investment as a share of GDP is expected to end now, and pro-growth policies by the \ngovernment could help revive it, especially if business environment challenges and geopolitical \nrisks are addressed. However, a strong rebound is unlikely because of high costs of local currency \nfinance and constraints to the banking system\u2019s maturity transformation capacity.6 As a result of \n                                                \n1  Included in ADB. 2014. Country Partnership Strategy: Armenia, 2014\u20132018. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2017. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Programmatic \nApproach and Policy-Based Loan for Subprogram 1 to Armenia for the Public Efficiency and Financial Markets \nProgram. Manila. \n3  ADB provided transaction technical assistance for Support to Public Efficiency and Financial Markets Program. \n4  Industrial output volumes were up by 12.6%, mostly because of increases in global prices of copper, the country's \nlargest export. Brandy, wine, tobacco, and textile industries also contributed to raising the exports by 25.8% to a \nrecord high of $2.2 billion. \n5  The surprisingly high 2017 real GDP growth figure exceeded the estimates of most observers\u2019 forecasts of 3.0%\u2013\n3.5% and was mostly determined by an unanticipated fourth-quarter hike in economic activity. The unexpected \nrecovery in remittances from the Russian Federation supported 5.5% growth in retail trade turnover, and a 14.4% \nsurge in other services. \n6  Maturity transformation is a key function of banking. The maturity mismatch that is needed to facilitate long-term \ninvestment projects, while serving agents\u2019 liquidity needs, is a key driver of the net interest margin in banking. The \nterm refers to the difference in the residual contractual maturity between assets and liabilities. \n ", "2 \nthe root constraints highlighted below, pricing benchmarks for financial contracts in local currency \nare currently nonexistent for most tenors or are very steep when available, and the economy \nremains dollarized and vulnerable to external shocks.7 \n \n5.  Core development problem. While financial institutions in Armenia have improved their \nrole  over  the  years  (predominantly  banking),  financial  markets  remain  nascent. This  limits \nArmenia\u2019s  private  sector  development;  and  affects  public  finance,  fiscal  management,  and \nmacroeconomic and financial stability. This is rooted in three constraints:  \n \n(i)  Fundamental gaps in public debt and fiscal risk management scope. To \nensure fiscal stability and sustainability, these functions need to become more \ncredible,  transparent,  and  effective.  Before  the  PEFMP:  (a)  public  debt \nmanagement  lacked  effectiveness  and  strategic  underpinnings;  (b) fiscal  risk \nmanagement was inadequate and significantly incomplete in scope, played no role \nin the vetting of new initiatives, lacked basic methodologies of analysis, and \nexercised no risk management or mitigation responsibilities; and (c) private sector \nprovision of public infrastructure services lacked legal/regulatory bases and was \ndone in nontransparent and potentially fiscally adverse ways. \n(ii)  Key institutional and financial infrastructure gaps that hold back efficiency \nand liquidity in Armenia\u2019s government securities and money markets. Before \nthe  PEFMP  debt  securities  issuance  practices  and  communication  were \ninadequate, at least in terms of the development of financial market benchmarks \n(price  discovery)  and  the  need  to  gradually  reduce  liquidity  premiums  in \ngovernment debt securities. Lack of market-making frameworks also impeded \nprice discovery.   \n(iii)  Problems in key legal frameworks for new instruments and the protection of \ninvestors,  and  deep  deficiencies  in  corporate  transparency.  Before  the \nPEFMP, gaps in legal frameworks for new financial instruments and asset classes \nhindered  investor  interest  and  feasibility  in  the  issuance  of  new  financial \ninstruments.  Lack  of  corporate  information  practices  also  constrains  the \nbroadening of investor/issuer bases in Armenia\u2019s debt and equity markets. \n \n6.  New government\u2019s continuity in financial reforms. It is crucial to support the new \nGovernment of Armenia\u2019s efforts in promoting reforms that can produce mutually reinforcing \neffects along the areas of intervention of the PEFMP. Financial reform processes are medium-\nterm in nature, and the political transition that took place in March\u2013May 2018 has not affected \ncountry ownership for the PEFMP. The constitutional transition to a parliamentary system in April \n2018 did bring policy dialogue and technical assistance (TA) temporarily to a halt from late March. \nEven though a new cabinet was formed in the third week of April, political circumstances led to a \nnew government step-down and a new cabinet solution only emerged in mid-May 2018. An ADB \nmission presented the PEFMP to the new government team at the end of May, and received \nformal support for its objectives and reforms, and for the policy dialogue that had been interrupted. \nPolicy dialogue resumed swiftly under a formal request for support for both subprogram 2 reforms \nand for those included in the post-program engagement framework (PPEF). New elections, \nexpected to take place in the near future, are likely to consolidate Parliamentarian support for the \ngovernment solution and reform agenda.    \n                                                \n7  At the current Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) policy rate of 6%, risk-free rates for highly liquid instruments with a    \n5-year tenor are about 8.5% (and above 10% for a 10-year tenor). Maximum tenors offered by banks in Armenia in \nlocal currency are now below 24 months on average, at rates of about 13%. \n ", "3 \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n7.  Reform  outputs  area  1:  Public  debt  and  fiscal  risk  management  policies \nstrengthened. To ultimately enhance fiscal discipline, transparency, and credibility, this output \naims to strengthen the legal framework and improve the analytical capacity of the Public Debt \nManagement  Department  (PDMD)  to  mitigate  system  risks;  introduce  more  clarity  and \ntransparency in PDMD\u2019s internal procedures, operations, and debt issuance decisions; and bring \ntransparency to the government\u2019s debt management objectives over the medium term. Under \nsubprogram 2, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) continued efforts to significantly improve (i) its fiscal \npolicy  framework  to  ensure  fiscal  sustainability,  credibility,  and  transparency;  and  (ii)  its \ninstitutional and regulatory capacity to manage key fiscal risks. These efforts are crucial to ensure \nfiscal stability and the confidence of financial markets going forward, and are key complements \nto the new fiscal rule approved in December 2017 (with International Monetary Fund [IMF] TA \nsupport).8 A key pillar of the overall effort is one of strengthening MOF control and understanding \nof the wide array of operations and activities that produce fiscal risks.  \n \n8.  Under this output, the role of the PDMD has been expanded to include, e.g., the analysis \nand vetting of requests for guarantees. It now centralizes the analysis and reporting of all forms \nof explicit liabilities within the Medium-Term Debt Strategy (MTDS) process and through periodic \npublic bulletins. Parliament approved new legislative amendments (to the Laws on International \nTreaties) to strengthen the role of the MOF in vetting all external borrowing. For example, the \nminister of finance is now the only government official charged with signing loan agreements, \nregardless of modalities, and is the final decision maker on all external borrowing proposals. To \nimplement this new framework, the MOF developed and approved a manual to guide the analysis, \nnegotiation, and contracting of external borrowing. Following the new reporting requirement, the \nMOF published its annual assessment on Armenia\u2019s Debt Sustainability in May 2018. This \nupgrade in public transparency is a crucial complement to the new fiscal rule, itself a key new \npillar in Armenia\u2019s fiscal governance, and will help ensure market confidence in fiscal policy.9 \n \n9.  The MOF also approved a formal operational risk management framework that includes \nbusiness continuity planning and implementation routines. To adequately address credit risks and \nrisks related to fiscal contingent liabilities associated with budgetary lending and guarantees, the \nMOF also established a framework to vet, monitor, and evaluate these operations. In coordination \nwith the IMF, risk-vetting and monitoring procedures were adopted to close the wide gaps that \nhad been identified and prioritized in the fiscal risk management road map.10 This policy area also \naddressed a fundamental institutional handicap related to (i) the lack of information flow routines \nfor any integration of fiscal risk management and (ii) the absence of a full-fledged fiscal risks \nassessment department within the MOF. The MOF has adjusted its institutional framework to \nsignificantly  facilitate  the  integration  of  risk  monitoring  and  management  functions,  and \ninformation flows. To elevate the relevance of this new institutional function, it formed a Fiscal \nRisks Assessment Department in full integration with statistical functions. \n \n10.  In close coordination with several development partners (but mostly with the IMF), this \noutput  helped  enhance  the  fiscal  risk  management  capacity  of  Armenia  in  public\u2013private \n                                                \n8  The introduction of the new fiscal rule required amendments to the Budget System Law and the Public Debt Law, \nbut this was not included in subprogram 2 as a policy action. \n9  Fiscal transparency is favorable to emerging economies\u2019 borrowing costs and help increase foreign investor\u2019s \ndemand for their sovereign debt, i.e. beyond issues of availability of information on debt servicing capabilities. \n10  A separate set of procedures to vet, analyze, manage, and report risks that are associated with public\u2013private \npartnerships (PPPs) was developed and will also be approved. These methodologies complement the general fiscal \nrisk assessment models developed by the IMF.  \n ", "4 \npartnerships (PPPs) and ensure that the proposed new legal and institutional ecosystem for PPPs \nonly  promotes  development-relevant  and  fiscally  responsible  PPPs.  This  work  has  been \ndeveloped  by  the  Ministry  of  Economic  Development  and  Investments  (MEDI),  in  wide \nconsultation with different line ministries and in line with the PPP Policy Statement approved \nearlier. The range of risks involved in contracting and implementing a PPP pipeline merited a \nthorough process of interministerial dialogue (and capacity development) to build consensus \nabout key policy trade-offs. To a large extent, this effort had to be undertaken a second time from \nJune 2018 onward, albeit very successfully. The PPP law proposal approved by the cabinet and \nsubmitted to Parliament in August 2018 meets crucial requirements in that regard.  \n \n11.  Reform  outputs  area  2:  Government\u2019s  securities  market  and  money-market \ninfrastructure improved. To develop financial markets in dram and finance public sector needs \nmore sustainably, this output aims to increase trading volumes and liquidity in government \nsecurities. This will help enable a gradual reduction in foreign currency risk exposures by public \nand corporate borrowers and lenders in Armenia. These reforms are key prerequisites for the \ndevelopment of reliable risk-free benchmarks for the pricing of all other local currency financial \ncontracts in Armenia. This is a precondition for financial deepening in local currency in Armenia \nand sustaining de-dollarization efforts. Under subprogram 2, the MOF and the Central Bank of \nArmenia (CBA) continued to improve the underpinnings of the government securities market and \nmoney markets\u2014crucial cornerstones for the development of capital and financial markets. A \ntime-bound road map for the medium-term development of capital and financial markets in \nArmenia was developed and approved through a memorandum of understanding between the \nMOF and the CBA. This memorandum recognizes the crucial interdependence of actions between \nthe MOF and the CBA in this regard, and it includes the three pillars of policy action that are most \nrelevant at this stage: (i) money-markets and systemic liquidity management, (ii) public debt \nsecurities market development, and (iii) corporate debt and equity securities development. \n \n12.  Access to public debt issuance for retail investors was established under subprogram 1, \nenhanced by mobile technology. This was implemented under subprogram 2, and the subject of \na new public reporting requirement. A more effective primary dealers\u2019 system was approved in \nsubprogram 1, with market-making responsibilities to promote price discovery and liquidity in the \ngovernment securities market. This was implemented under subprogram 2, reviewed and subject \nof a public report to the market on possible and planned improvements, with an explicit request \nfor feedback. A Regular Treasury Bill Program (RTBP), approved under subprogram 1, was \nimplemented under subprogram 2 and reviewed against whether volumes and maturities were \nconsistent  with  the  feedback  from  the  market  and  aligned  with  monetary  and  public  debt \nmanagement policies (and the need to develop money markets). The MOF also upgraded and \npublished its treasury securities annual borrowing plan, with a clear policy on bond buyback and \nswitch operations to ensure financial markets\u2019 understanding of the MOF\u2019s debt management \noperations. These reforms add predictability to the MOF\u2019s debt issuance and management for \ninvestors. Working with NASDAQ OMX and the CBA, the MOF developed its requirements for \nbond switch auctions and regulations for enabling NASDAQ\u2019s operationalization of the new \nsystem to facilitate MOF consolidation of outstanding issues. \n \n13.  Subprogram 2 aimed at ensuring that the MTDS (2019-2021) is effective in communicating \nthe recognized need to (i) reduce exposure to currency risks and (ii) develop a local currency \nsovereign  debt  market.  It  was  fundamental  that  the  MTDS  fully  reflected  the  operational \nimplications of these priorities in the debt issuance program going forward,11 including an explicit \n                                                \n11 The projected share for net borrowings in domestic securities in total new borrowings for 2019\u20132020 has almost \ndoubled in the new MTDS. Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Armenia. http://www.minfin.am/en/page/strategy/. \n ", "5 \nannouncement  of  options  and  possible  plans  to  address  the  Eurobond-related  redemption \nchallenge of 2020. The approval of the new MTDS introduced this public debt management \ndialogue to market participants, and now also articulates the critical risk trade-offs going forward. \nTogether with the first publication of the public debt sustainability assessment report, these \nimprovements are crucial breakthroughs in public debt management transparency in Armenia. A \nworking group has also strengthened the much-needed analytical cooperation between the CBA \nand PDMD. A joint internal paper (on potential exchange rate impacts of accelerated local-\ncurrency debt issuance and mitigation options) was produced as a result. \n \n14.  To develop Armenian integration with international financial markets and mainstream the \nuse of the Global Master Repurchase Agreement (GMRA) across money markets in Armenia, the \nCBA became a member of the International Capital Market Association (ICMA)12 and approved \nthe introduction of the GMRA in 2018. Approved was also the implementation of a plan to, inter \nalia: (i) mainstream the use of GMRA by upgrading CBA\u2019s own systems in all of its open-market \noperations and standing facilities from 2018 onwards; (ii) undertake a regulatory review to remove \nregulatory biases against GMRA adoption and publicly inform supervisees of the gradual removal \nof such regulatory biases. This market communication approach will enable a nondisruptive \ntransition in market participants\u2019 information technology and liquidity management systems. ADB \nTA efforts in this reform area complement the assistance of the European Bank for Reconstruction \nand Development. \n \n15.  Under subprogram 1, a steering committee was formed to implement a Tri-party Repo \nProject. Under subprogram 2 and with ADB TA support, this brought the MOF, the CBA, and the \nCentral Depository of Armenia (and NASDAQ OMX) together to study system and institutional \noptions, and their financial feasibility. A request for proposals was sent to potential international \nvendors, selection was finalized, and a financial feasibility analysis was presented to the steering \ncommittee. A full economic cost\u2013benefit analysis was undertaken to assess short-listed systems. \nA survey was also launched to market participants to reassess the potential for this investment\u2019s \ncost recovery and its drivers. A final decision at the second steering committee meeting reflected \na consensus that this investment is premature and determined options for when (i) increases in \nbanks\u2019  liquidity  management  activity  and  (ii)  improvements  in  the  CBA\u2019s  systemic  liquidity \nmanagement can produce a higher economic feasibility for it. The MOF also reviewed the source \nand analysis of its cash flows to identify ways to improve its forecast projections. It reflected and \napproved these in a roadmap to (i) develop a new cash management framework using Treasury \nbills, buybacks, and switches; and (ii) better coordinated with CBA\u2019s own liquidity management. \nThis will remove one of the constraints to the CBA\u2019s systemic liquidity management functions. \n \n16.  Reform  outputs  area  3:  Base  of  instruments  and  investors  broadened,  and \ncorporate transparency enhanced. To ultimately increase resource mobilization for private \ninvestments,  this  output  aims  to  strengthen  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  new \ninstruments  and  corporate  transparency  in  Armenia.  This  aims  to  encourage  more  active \ninvestors and issuers to participate in Armenia\u2019s capital markets. In a sign of strong economic \npolicy commitment to the broad financial reform agenda, the new government confirmed the \nimplementation  of  the  mandatory  capitalization  system  for  pension  contributions  and \ninvestments,13 and actually increased the fiscal-sharing element of it to avoid informality in labor \ncontracts. The new government is also preparing significant amendments to Armenia\u2019s insolvency \n                                                \n12 ICMA membership enables legal opinions on GMRA enforceability in Armenia to be published by ICMA, and will \nfacilitate cross-border repo transactions between Armenian companies and ICMA members. \n13 The funded pension system introduced in 2014 allowed involving internationally reputed pension fund managers into \nthe financial markets of Armenia. As the result of funded contributions, the mandatory pension funds include assets \nof more than AMD105 billion as of end 2017. \n ", "6 \nframework. Cabinet is deciding on legal proposals to improve bankruptcy processes and protect \ncreditors\u2019 rights, e.g., by establishing specialized courts for insolvency procedures, ensuring \nalignment in court treatment of insolvency cases with civil cases, and ensuring the participation \nof the Ministry of Justice and the judge of an insolvency case (not just the insolvency officer) in \nthe Supervisory Body. \n \n17.  Parliament  approved  a  new  Law  on  Residential  Mortgage  Lending,  together  with \nAmendments to the Covered Mortgage Bonds Law. With the latter, the regulation of covered bond \nissuance was brought in line with best practices. One of the major features introduced by the \nreform is the regulation of centralized covered bond issuance. There was a great uncertainty in \ncases of insolvency of the participant issuer, as the relations between the central issuer and the \nparticipant issuer could not be regulated simply by a contract. The reformed law addresses this \nissue and makes sure centralized issuance of covered bonds is safe, the assets in the pool are \nring-fenced against insolvency, and all the procedures are certain. The reforms also updated the \nlist of eligible assets for the pool, making the law a stronger basis for financial activities.14 Banks \nin Armenia have been trying to structure these investment vehicles and adding new asset classes, \nand this strengthening of legal frameworks is now expected to catapult these efforts forward. To \nclarify the nature and attributes of new investment instruments and special purpose vehicles \n(enabling synthetic securitization and the issuance of securities before a loan-book purchase), \nand  to  strengthen  the  legal  basis  for  securitization,  Parliament  approved  the  proposed \namendments to the Law on Asset Securitization and Asset-Backed Securities.15 \n \n18.  As illustrated above, there has been no slowdown in financial reform efforts by the \nGovernment in Armenia in 2018. By August 2018, the cabinet had approved proposals to \nintroduce modern elements of corporate law in Armenia, such as (i) the concept of a shareholder\u2019s \nagreement (e.g., as an amendment to the Joint Stock Companies Law); and (ii) the protection of \nminority investors\u2019 rights (as amendments to the Joint Stock Company Law, the Law on Limited \nLiability  Companies,  and  the  Law  on  Securities  Market).  To  establish  stronger  corporate \ntransparency practices in Armenia and promote more availability of reliable financial information \non domestic companies, the cabinet also approved a number of reforms that are expected to \nattract more investors and channel more savings through financial markets to companies that \nneed capital to grow and generate jobs. Under subprogram 2, a package of audit reforms was \nproposed to Parliament that included the establishment of a public oversight board. These \nreforms, when adopted in Parliament (and supported by the PPEF), will pave the way to a \nsystemic shift in the financial information and transparency industry in Armenia. \n \n19.  Lessons. As with subprogram 1, subprogram 2 incorporates important lessons from policy \ndialogue experience in finance sector and public sector reform programs in other countries, as \nwell as from earlier ADB policy-based lending engagement in Armenia. International lessons for \nthe successful development of local currency financial markets, public management, fiscal risk \nmanagement, etc., were incorporated across all reform efforts to varying degrees, but the policy \ndialogue often emphasized the need to address and target more context-specific solutions that \nonly TA and reform analysis could uncover. This was done in full use of the advantages of ADB\u2019s \nprogrammatic  assistance  (relative  to  other  modalities).  In  this  sense,  the  experience  of \nsubprogram 2 has also confirmed the advantages of the programmatic modality to the nature of \n                                                \n14 The law clearly defines the assets that can be used as substitutes, and introduces a cap on the percentage of such \nassets in the pool. \n15 For example, prior to these amendments, the special purpose vehicles had the legal status of foundations (not of \ninvestment funds), which hindered securitization efforts. Amendments also now enable synthetic securitizations (and \nnot only via true-sale). Other crucial constraints (e.g. lack of clarity on reserve requirements for the parties\u2019 accounts \nreceivables) were also removed, and securitization is now a viable option in Armenia. \n ", "7 \nthis multi-period, multi-speed reform agenda in Armenia. Setting realistic policy actions is also \ncritical to ensure that the reform program can be carried out effectively and implementing \nagencies\u2019  technical  staffs  remain  fully  connected  to  the  process.  Policy  reforms  must  be \naccompanied by significant government ownership, but this often requires a more pragmatic and \nsequenced approach from development partners (often emphasizing issues of form on how to \napproach reform challenges). As often observed in other \u201cpost-transition\u201d contexts, catalyzing the \nlevels of inter-agency institutional collaboration that are crucial in financial markets development \nis a challenge in Armenia (at working levels). Promoting analytical cooperation between agencies \noften requires setting formal requirements for it, to support policy dialogue continuity and frame \nthe progress that is needed in more effective ways. \n \n20.  Reform Implementation Challenges and Adjustments to Subprogram 2. Subprogram \n2 reforms and policy dialogue progressed broadly as expected in terms of indicative targets set \nin October 2017 at subprogram 1 approval. In some areas, the effectiveness of the policy dialogue \nresulted in more concrete reform achievements and new reform efforts (policy actions 1, 7, 15, \nand 23). Some key legal reforms also progressed faster than originally expected (policy actions \n3 and 22). The timing of policy action 25 was also corrected, to be in line with policy action 24. \nAdjustments were required in policy actions 11 and 17\u201319 to achieve the underlying policy \nobjectives more effectively and reflect concrete reform realities. A supplementary linked document \ndiscusses these reform adjustments in detail.16 All Subprogram 2 policy actions have been \nachieved before late-September 2018. All Subprogram 1 policy actions have been sustained \nwithout any rollback of the reform measures. \n \n21.  Post-program  engagement  framework.  The  policy  dialogue  process  under \nsubprogram 2 was successful in clarifying that several follow-up reform steps will be crucial and \ncould benefit from further ADB support. The ADB team and the authorities agreed on a PPEF \nthrough which both can lock-in a working-level commitment to jointly prepare the next phase of \nassociated reforms, i.e., reforms that are a natural sequence or necessary for subprogram 2 \nreforms to come to full fruition in terms of impact. The PPEF contains a non-exhaustive list of \ninitial activities,17 including the development of an integrated fiscal risk management framework \nin close coordination with capacity development and the new institutional setup for this function, \nPPP pipeline development (within the new legal and regulatory framework), further development \nof market-making and primary dealer frameworks (and other efforts to enhance price discovery \nand turnover liquidity), reviewing tax challenges to securities\u2019 trading and issuance, implementing \nregulatory efforts to encourage corporate debt issuance, developing the capacity of the new \ngoverning framework for accounting and auditing in Armenia, etc. \n \n22.  Coordination with other development partners. As indicated in specific references \nabove, Subprogram 2 helped coordinate the benefits of different sources of TA for fiscal and \nfinance sector reforms in Armenia. Different aspects in the scope of the program have been \nclosely coordinated with the IMF and the EBRD. Close collaboration with IMF teams on PPP \nreforms and on the fiscal risk management upgrading dialogue was instrumental to the related \u2013\nachievements under Subprogram 2 and are expected to continue during the PPEF. Collaboration \nwith the EBRD on money-markets development is also expected to strengthen. Some reforms \nbenefited from earlier TA by the European Union delegation in Armenia and by the World Bank. \nThis has ensured that the proposed program reforms complement related (past and present) TA \n                                                \n16 Reform Implementation Challenges and Adjustments to Subprogram 2 (accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2).  \n17 Post-Program Engagement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "8 \ninitiatives by other development partners, and that each partner\u2019s work is always considered, \nintegrated, and often actually incorporated for the first time are form-consequent policy dialogue.18 \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n23.  To illustrate the potential financial and economic impacts of the reforms presented in \nSection II.B, a full discussion is presented in a supplementary document.19 Subprogram 2 reforms \n(i) bring to fruition a number of key legal and institutional game-changers for financial markets in \nArmenia,  thus  sustaining  the  benefits  of  complementary  reform  processes  implemented  in \nsubprogram 1; and (ii) put in motion new reform processes that, for example, the proposed PPEF \nwill help consolidate. The development of the financial markets is crucial for Armenia and can: \n(i)  support government funding possibilities in the domestic market, thereby reducing \nits currently very high foreign currency exposure and vulnerability to external \nshocks; \n(ii)  support the traction of monetary policy levers, and provide suitable instruments for \nthe authorities to deal with macroeconomic shocks and risks to financial stability \nfrom high dollarization; \n(iii)  develop local capital markets, on the back of the development of an effective \ngovernment  securities  market,  to  enable  banks\u2019  maturity  transformation,  and \ncompanies\u2019 and households\u2019 access to local currency borrowing; and \n(iv)  improve the efficiency of capital allocation and intermediation between investors \nand borrowers, through adequate disclosure and legal frameworks to protect \ninvestors and borrowers. \n \n24.  The proposed reforms under the PEFMP\u2014to address each of the three root constraints \npresented in para 5 above, are important in their own specific context. The Program Economic \nand Financial Impact Assessment illustrates these potential financial benefits through estimates \nof the specific, partial benefits that proposed reforms can produce in each area.20 This due \ndiligence  and  analysis  indicates  that  this  reform  program,  complemented  by  crucial \ncontemporaneous and future reform processes, can indeed contribute to stronger and more \nsustained economic growth, and less episodes of macroeconomic and financial instability. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n25.  Armenia experienced an economic growth spurt in 2017. As a result, the budget deficit in \n2017 decreased to 4.8% of GDP from 5.5% in 2016. External public debt increased to 42.5% of \nGDP from 41.1% in 2016, while domestic debt rose to 11.1% from 10.9% in 2016. To reduce \ndebt-related vulnerabilities, the government envisages significant fiscal consolidation in 2018-\n2019. With public debt exceeding the legal limit of 50% of GDP, Armenia\u2019s fiscal rule requires a \nreduction in the budget deficit to 2.7% in 2018. Over the medium term, the budget deficit is \nexpected to narrow further to 2% of GDP in both 2019 and 2020. The government has requested \na regular loan of $50 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to underpin subprogram 2. \nThe loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, straight line method, an \n                                                \n18 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Program Economic and Financial Impact Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 This analysis takes into account the program of reforms under subprogram 1, subprogram 2, and commitments made \nunder the PPEF. International reform and empirical experience have shown that, taken together, the reform \nprocesses in the program could be very meaningful. However, a meaningful quantification of the combined impact \non the economy from these different and partial processes is extremely difficult to make. Instead, the linked document \nattempts at highlighting the several channels of medium-term potential economic impact that recent cross-country \nempirical literature has emphasized. \n ", "9 \nannual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The average maturity is 9.25 years, and there is \nno maturity premium payable to ADB. The loan amount reflects the government\u2019s financing needs, \nconsidering  its  development  expenditure  over  2018\u20132020  (Table  1).  The  financing  gap  is \nexpected  to  be  $146.12  million  or  1.99%  of  GDP  in  2018,  to  be  financed  partly  through \nsubprogram 2. The closing date of the loan is 31 December 2018. \n \nTable 1: Armenia State Budget Financing Gap for 2018\u20132020 (Projected) \nAmount  Amount  Amount  GDP  GDP  GDP \n2018  2019  2020  2018  2019  2020 \nItem  ($ million)  ($ million)  ($ million)  (%)  (%)  (%) \n1.

The CBA, the MOF and the MEDI are the implementing \nagencies for their respective reforms (Appendix 4). The MOF was the executing agency in prior \nprogram loans, including subprogram 1. The MOF, the MEDI and the CBA had a well-established \nrecord  of  implementing  reform  programs  with  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  and  the  IMF,  and \nSubprogram 2 benefited from that. The implementation period for subprogram 2 is from November \n2017 to December 2018. The proceeds of subprogram 2 will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n27.  Governance. Armenia\u2019s public financial management (PFM) has steadily improved over \ntime in budget credibility, comprehensiveness and transparency, policy-based budgeting and \nexecution, and revenue administration. However, the management of fiscal risks related to public \nsector enterprises and PPPs, cash management, and forecasting ability is weak. The MOF \ncontinues to have a consistent lead role in PFM reform efforts, including the new Tax Code \nimplemented in January 2018. The government\u2019s Anticorruption Council is responsible for setting \nanticorruption policies, leading investigations, and imposing remedies. \n \n28.  Poverty and social. Subprogram 2 is expected to contribute indirectly (over the medium \nterm) to poverty reduction through improved finance sector stability, stronger resilience to external \nshocks, and more sustained economic and employment growth. In line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009), the program is classified category C for impacts on the environment, \n ", "10 \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Major risks and mitigating measures are \nsummarized in table 2 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.21 \n \nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nThe country is still vulnerable to external  The mitigation of external risks remains a priority of the Government of \nshocks,  which  may  directly  affect  Armenia.
