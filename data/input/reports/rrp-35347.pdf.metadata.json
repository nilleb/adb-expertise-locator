The system was damaged in May 2001 by\nan  earthquake  that  disrupted  water  supplies  to  56,000\npeople  and  65,000  livestock.  In  addition,    irrigation  water\nsupplies  to  11,724  hectares  of  arable  land  were  disrupted.\nAbout  90  percent  of  the  people  served  by  the  system  live\nbelow the poverty line. The system was completed in 1968,\nand    consists  of  a  tunnel,  an  open  canal  of  about  28\nkilometers  (km),  and  three  inverted  siphons  with  a  total\nlength  of  about  3  km  that  convey  water  through  three\nvalleys. The earthquake damaged one siphon, disrupting the\nwater  supply.  The  Government  agencies  took  immediate\naction  and  within  a  month  had  laid  temporary  pipelines\npartly  restoring  water  supply.  The  Project  will  restore  water\nsupply  by  installing  permanent  replacement  works,  and\nrehabilitate  facilities  that  pose  a  threat,  thus  safeguarding\nagainst  failure  risks.  The  project  works  include  construction\nof  bypass  canals  for  two  siphons,  replacement  of  the  third\nfor  which  topography  does  not  allow  construction  of  a\nbypass canal, and some works on the main canal and tunnel\nthat are necessary for safe operation of the system.\n\nClassification\n\nCore poverty intervention\nHuman development\n\nEnvironmental Assessment\n\nCategory  B.  An  initial  environmental  examination  was\nundertaken,  a  summary  of  which \nis  attached  as  an\nappendix.\n\nRationale\n\nThe  earthquake  and  consequent  flooding  of  May  2001\ncaused  significant  damage \nto  public  and  private\ninfrastructure  and  disrupted  potable  and  irrigation  water\nto  predominantly  poor  communities.  Although\nsupplies \nsupplies were partly restored through temporary works with\nborrowed resources, permanent works are urgently  needed\nto fully restore this basic service to the affected communities\nand  safeguard  against  the  recurrence  of  such  a  disaster  in\nthe  project  area.  An  emergency  assistance  to  minimize  the\nsocial and economic impacts of the disaster is warranted by\nthe  Government\u2019s  budgetary  constraints,  which  are\nexpected to continue over the medium term. The Project will\nrehabilitate  the  water  supply  infrastructure  and  safeguard\nagainst  recurrence  of  future  disruptions,  and  thus  ensure\n\n\fii\n\nmaintenance  of  quality  of  life  by  sustaining  critical  water\nsupply.  In  line  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  policy\non  rehabilitation  assistance  after  disasters,  the  Project  will\nenable Tajikistan to continue with development expenditures\nthat  otherwise  would  have  been  foregone  for  disaster\nrehabilitation.\n\ntwo \n\ncomprises \n\ncomponents: \n\nThe Project\u2019s immediate objective is to fully restore irrigation\nand  household  water  supply  in  the  project  area.

The earthquake ruptured the\nwater conveyance system cutting off water supplies to a population of approximately 56,000 and\n65,000  livestock.  About  11,724  hectares  (ha)  of  arable  land  were  left  without  irrigation  water.\nAbout 90 percent of the affected people are living below the poverty line.\n\n3. \nGovernment  agencies  took  immediate  steps  to  address  the  situation  and  alleviate  the\nplight  of  the  affected  population.  Household  water  supplies  were  met  by  water  tankers.  A\nworkforce  of  250  persons  and  a  huge  machinery  pool  undertook  construction  of  a  temporary\npipeline,  and  thus  restored  water  supply  to  affected  households  and  livestock.  Given  the  time\nand resources available to the Government, the contingency restoration of household supplies\nhas  met  their  immediate  objective.  However,  the  system  remains  precarious  and  permanent\nworks are needed to restore the system to its full capacity and to address the risk of failure in\nother parts of the system, which are all more than 30 years old and have been destabilized or\nweakened by earthquake activity but which continue to be in use.\n\n4. \nThe President of Tajikistan in a letter dated 23 May 2001 asked the Asian Development\nBank  (ADB)  to  provide  emergency  assistance  to  restore  the  water  conveyance  system.  The\nAppraisal Mission1 visited Tajikistan from 15 to 30 July 2001 and visited the affected areas. The\nMission  held  discussions  with  a  wide  range  of  national  and  local  agencies,  and  the  affected\ncommunities. This report is based on the Mission\u2019s findings and agreements reached with the\nGovernment. The project framework is in Appendix 1.\n\nA.\n\nGeographic Features\n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\n5. \nTajikistan is the most southerly of the former Soviet Union Central Asian republics, which\nbecame independent in 1991. It is bordered to the north by the Kyrgyz Republic, in the east by\nthe Peoples Republic of China, Afghanistan to the south, and Uzbekistan to the west. The total\narea of 143,100 square kilometer (km) is divided into four regions, namely Sughd in the north,\nRegion  of  Republican  Subordination  in  the  center,  Khatlon  in  the  south,  and  the  mainly\nmountainous Gorno-Badakshan in the east.\n\n6. \nThe  climate  is  continental  although  the  relatively  southerly  latitude  has  an  ameliorating\nimpact and altitude is a significant local factor. The lowland agricultural areas have an average\nsummer  temperature  of  about  26\u00baC  and  a  winter  average  of  6\u00baC,  and  have  a  long  growing\n\n                  \n\n1  The  Mission  comprised  A.  Malik,  Senior  Project  Specialist/Mission  Leader;  K.  Motomura,  Programs  Officer;  T.\nBayarsaihan,  Project  Economist;  A.  Sweetser,  Social  Development  Specialist;  J.  Wartiovaara,  Environmental\nSpecialist; R. Shaw, Economist, Staff Consultant; and M. Ali, Design Engineer, Staff Consultant.\n\n\f2\n\nseason  by  central  Asian  standards  of  over  220  days.  Rainfall  averages  150  to  250 millimeter\n(mm) per year, most of which falls in the winter months. As a consequence, agriculture is highly\ndependent on irrigation. At higher altitudes, temperatures decline, the growing season shortens,\nand snow cover is common for much of the winter.\n\n7. \nThe  population  is  about  6.1  million,  two  thirds  of  whom  are  ethnic  Tajiks.  Other\nsignificant  ethnic  groups  include  Kyrgyz,  Russians,  and  Uzbeks.  Population  distribution  is\nuneven; about 0.5 million people live in the capital Dushanbe and the total urban population is\n1.8  million.  The  rural  population  is  concentrated  in  the  Sughd  and  Khatlon  regions,  which\naccount for about 4 million people, most of whom are dispersed in over 3,000 communities of\nless than 1,000 persons each.\n\nTajikistan is a mountainous country; only 960,000 ha are designated as cultivable land.\n8. \nA further 3.6 million ha or 7 percent of the total area is classified as permanent pasture. Thus\nthe amount of arable land per rural household is very modest at about 0.9 ha, plus about 3.5 ha\nof  pasture.  These  include  significant  areas  of  often  steeply  sloping  land,  which  is  at  risk  and\noften results in evident soil erosion. A more sustainable pattern of land use would be consistent\nwith a lower cultivated area.\n\n9. \nThe country has over 600 water supply systems, which originally provided 60 percent of\nthe  population  with  piped  water  mainly  from  groundwater  sources.  As  a  result  of  damage\ncaused and lack of maintenance during the civil conflict, this figure has fallen substantially. Most\nrural potable water systems have deteriorated, thus depriving many rural communities of access\nto safe drinking water. Many households now depend on surface water, usually rivers or canals,\nwhere water quality is low. Outside district centers, the proportion of households with access to\npiped water is less than 20 percent. Even where a pipe network exists, the source of water is\nusually surface water, such as a river, with no guarantee that the water has been treated. Many\nsystems  are  in  a  state  of  disrepair,  forcing  households  to  collect  water  from  as  far  away  as  5\nkm.  The  increased  dependence  on  surface  water  sources  has  resulted  in  a  much  higher\nincidence of waterborne diseases in rural areas.\n\nB.\n\nRecent Economic Developments\n\nTajikistan  had  an  estimated  per  capita  gross  national  product  of  $290  in  2000.2  At\n10. \nindependence,  Tajikistan  was  the  poorest  republic  of  the  former  Soviet  Union.  The  transition\nprocess  proved  to  be  difficult  as  the  country  faced  many  challenges.  First,  Tajikistan  lost  the\nmost from the termination of transfers from Moscow, estimated at 40 percent of gross domestic\nproduct  (GDP).  Second,  independence  was  accompanied  by  the  outbreak  of  civil  conflict  in\n1992,  which  continued  at  varying  degrees  of  intensity  until  1997.  The  conflict  made  reforms\nextremely  difficult  and  effectively  delayed \nimplementation  of  any  significant  economic\nrestructuring before 1997. Third, Tajikistan has suffered a number of natural disasters, including\nearthquakes,  floods,  and  avalanches,  that  have  disrupted  economic  activities  and  destroyed\ninfrastructure. As a consequence, GDP fell by an estimated 60 percent between 1991 and 1997.\nThe signing of a peace agreement in June 1997 ended the civil conflict and allowed the reform\nprogram  to  be  pursued  more  vigorously.  As  a  result,  GDP  began  to  grow.  Between  1997  and\n2000, GDP grew by about a cumulative 20 percent. Nevertheless, the country still faces a huge\ntask of reconstruction, requiring large investments, which the Government has found difficult to\nmobilize. Tajikistan\u2019s external position is also weak as a result of its dependence on cotton and\naluminum, whose prices are prone to considerable variation.\n\n2  World Bank 2001. Country Economic Memorandum. Tajikistan. Dushanbe.\n\n                  \n\n\f3\n\nThe  contraction  of  the  economy  has  severely  constrained  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to\n11. \nprovide  (i)  basic  social  services  and  (ii)  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  physical  and\nsocial  infrastructure.  The  Government  is  devoting  42  percent  of  its  budget  to  the  provision  of\nsocial  services,  but  with  a  national  poverty  level  of  83  percent  the  impact  is  modest.  The\nproposed Project will enable the Government to finance much needed social services as well as\nO&M of critical infrastructure.\n\nC.\n\nDescription of the Yavan Water Conveyance System\n\n12. \nThe  Yavan  water  conveyance  system  was  completed  in  1968.  The  system  originates\nfrom  Baipazin  Reservoir  on  Vakhsh  River,  about  65  km  southeast  of  Dushanbe  and  serves\nGozimalik, Khodzhamaston, and Yavan districts. About 90 percent of the people served by the\nsystem  live  below  the  poverty  line.  The  water  supply  is  taken  from  the  river  through  a  7.3  km\ntunnel  whose  outlet  is  in  the  neighboring  valley  adjacent  to  the  town  of  Yavan.  The  water\npasses from the tunnel via an open canal to a headworks with three outlets .The right side outlet\nfeeds  the  Pravaya  Vetka  main  canal,  which  has  a  design  capacity  of  50  cubic  meters  per\nsecond  (m3/sec)  and  irrigates  about  26,800  ha.  After  the  initial  reach  of  27.6  km  where  the\nsystem serves 15,526 ha, the canal capacity is reduced to 20 m3/sec, and inverted siphons are\nused to traverse three valleys followed by a tunnel before entering Gozimalik district. Because\nof  deterioration  of  various  parts  of  the  system  over  time,  the  flow  in  the  siphon  is  generally\nlimited to 17 m3/sec against a design capacity of 20 m3/sec.\n\n13. \nThe first siphon, Ishmasai, is 950 meters (m) long, consists of two parallel pipelines each\n1.8 m diameter (dia), and has a total design capacity of 17 m3/sec. To augment the capacity of\nthe  siphon  and  to  match  it  with  that  of  the  main  canal,  a  bypass  canal  of  4  m3/sec  was\nconstructed in 1985. Ishmasai siphon discharges into a 4 km long open canal, which drains into\nthe  second,  1.1  km  long  Loikasai  siphon.  Loikasai  siphon  consists  of  three  parallel  pipelines,\ntwo of 1.8 m dia each and the one of 1.02 m dia, and it discharges into a 3 km long open canal.\nThe third, Shurchasai siphon is 850 m long and consists of two pipelines of 1.8 m dia each. All\npipes are made of steel and originally had a thickness of 10 mm. During more than 30 years of\nuse,  the  pipes  have  been  severely  corroded  by  the  sediment  load  in  the  water;  in  some\nstretches, the thickness has been reduced to an alarming limit. At the bottom, the pipe thickness\nhas been reduced to about 3 mm posing threat of failure of the siphons, which seem to be in\ngood condition.\n\n14. \nLike  other  water-related  facilities  in  the  country,  the  maintenance  of  physical  facilities\nhas been inadequate because of poor cost recovery from the project beneficiaries and minimum\nGovernment support. Also, Soviet-era construction management and supervision practices are\nstill being followed. Thus, the scope for introducing modern efficient and cost-effective practices\nin these fields is considerable.\n\nD.\n\nThe Disaster\n\n15. \nThe earthquake of 7 May 2001 caused cracks in both the pipelines and the open canal\nparts  of  the  system.  The  most  severe  cracks  occurred  at  the  intake  structure  of  the  Loikasai\nsiphon. Water poured from these cracks, soaking the soil under the structure. Maintenance staff\nbegan preparations to plug the cracks and close the gates, which regulate the flow of water into\nthe system. During the night of the 7/8 of May, most of the soil under the intake structure, which\nconsisted  of  alluvial  deposits,  was  washed  away  and  at  1100  hours  on  8  May,  the  structure\ncollapsed. Water gushing from the collapsed structure began to wash away the soil supporting\nthe siphon pipes. Although the gates regulating the flow of water were closed, water continued\n\n\f4\n\nto flow for another 12 hours until the upstream siphon and open canals were completely empty.\nAbout  600  m  of  the  initial  reach  of  the  Loikasai  siphon  and  100  m  of  open  canal  above  the\nintake were washed away.\n\nThe immediate impact was the disruption of (i) potable water supplies to the community,\n16. \nand  (ii)  irrigation  supplies  to  more  than  11,700  ha  of  cultivated  land.  For  almost  four  weeks\nabout 56,000 people were dependent on water tankers for their supplies, while cropped areas\nsuffered  moisture  stress.  Water  gushing  from  the  collapsed  structure  destroyed  48  houses  in\nthe  valley  but  luckily,  caused  no  casualties.  The  disruptions  to  irrigation  supplies  immediately\nafter  the  disaster,  and  supply  of  about  9  m3/sec  against  14  m3/sec  at  Loikasai  siphon  after\ncompletion of the temporary works is expected to reduce crop yields by about 40 percent for the\n11,724  ha  irrigated  area.  Higher  levels  of  febrile  disease  (said  to  be  malaria)  than  usual  have\noccurred during the months following the catastrophe, but no significant loss of time in school or\nother health consequences have been identified.\n\nE.\n\nGovernment Response\n\n17. \nThe Government immediately established an emergency center charged with the task of\nreconstruction to restore potable water supplies. By 2 June 2001, the workforce succeeded in\nlaying a temporary pipeline of 1.4 m dia, carrying about 3.0 m3/sec or some 21 percent of the\noriginal supply of 14 m3/sec. The second pipeline of 2.02 m dia and about 6.0 m3/sec capacity\nwas completed on 18 June 2001. Another pipeline of 1.0 m dia with capacity of 0.5 m3/sec, also\ncompleted in June 2001, supplies water to local areas of Khodzhamaston district. This restored\nwater  supplies  to  households.  These  temporary  works  with  available  materials  were  aimed  at\nrestoring  the  water  supply  with  minimum  disruption  and  will  need  to  be  replaced  as  soon  as\npossible.  Unless  a  permanent  solution  is  implemented,  the  project  area  will  remain  under  the\nthreat of another system collapse leading to a disaster.\n\nThe cost of the temporary works is estimated at $478,300. The Government has diverted\n18. \nsome  funds from  other activities  while the Design Institute of the Ministry of Water Resources\nand Land Reclamation (MWRLR), and some contractors and suppliers are still to be paid.\n\nThe  Design  Institute  of  MWRLR  prepared  a  design  plan  to  rehabilitate  the  system\n19. \nincluding  parts  that  pose  a  continued  threat  to  local  communities.  The  plan  is  to  construct\nbypass  canals  for  the  first  two  inverted  siphons  and  replace  pipes  of  the  third.  The  existing\nbypass canal of Ishmasai (first) siphon, which carries 4.0 m3/sec will need to be remodeled to\ncarry  20  m3/sec.  A  detailed  survey  and  design  has  already  been  carried  out  for  the  second\nbypass canal and preparatory works for its construction are in progress.\n\nF.\n\nAid Coordination and External Assistance\n\n20. \nTajikistan  has  received  several  emergency  loans  from  various  development  agencies.\nThe  World  Bank  alone  provided  three  emergency  loans.  The  first,  postconflict  emergency\nreconstruction for $10.0 million, approved in February 19983 has been fully disbursed and was\nclosed in September 2000. Emergency flood assistance for $5.0 million was approved in August\n19984  and  supplemented  by  $2.0  million  in  December  1999.5  ADB  approved  the  Emergency\n\n3  World Bank Loan 30370-TAJ: Postconflict Emergency Reconstruction Project, for $10.0 million, approved on 17\n\n                  \n\n4  World Bank Loan 31230-TAJ: Emergency Flood Assistance Project, for $5.0 million, approved on 31 August 1998.\n5  World  Bank  Loan  31231-TAJ:  Supplementary  Flood  Assistance  Project,  for  $3.0  million,  approved  on  20\n\nFebruary 1998.\n\nDecember 1999.\n\n\f5\n\nFlood Rehabilitation Project (EFRP) in December 1999 for $5.0 million.6 Bilateral assistance has\nbeen  provided  by  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  and  Germany  through\nGerman  Agro  Action.  The  United  Nations  office  for  the  Coordination  of  Humanitarian  Affairs\nplayed a particularly useful role following the July 1999 floods. Good coordination among these\nagencies  has  been  maintained  and  was  followed  up  during  the  preparation  of  the  proposed\nProject.  Consultation  with  the  World  Bank  was  undertaken  to  ensure  that  the  activities  under\nthis Project do not overlap with the recently approved Rural Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project\n(RIRP) of the World Bank.7\n\nG.\n\nLessons Learned\n\n21. \nThe  following  lessons  learned  from  a  number  of  emergency  projects  financed  by  ADB\nhave been incorporated in the project design: (i) project components should be defined clearly;\n(ii)  adequate  consulting  services  should  be  provided  to  assist  with  surveys,  investigations,\ndesign, and construction supervision; (iii) advance action and retroactive financing are essential\nto  facilitate  speedy  restoration;  (iv)  training  is  critical  for  executing  agencies  not  familiar  with\nADB  procedures;  and  (v)  appropriate  O&M  arrangements  should  be  facilitated  for  the\nrehabilitated infrastructure. TA (para. 59) will be provided to facilitate proper O&M of the project\nfacilities.\n\nThe EFRP, the only ADB-financed emergency assistance project in Tajikistan, is being\n22. \nimplemented  by  the  Center  for  Liquidation  of  Consequences  of  Natural  Disasters  (CLCND),\nwhich  has  performed  creditably.  CLCND  has  agreed  to  provide  guidance  and  support  to\nMWRLR,  the  proposed  EA,  particularly  in  areas  such  as  disbursement  and  procurement\nprocedures. The experience gained by MWRLR during project implementation will strengthen its\ncapacity to implement forthcoming ADB agriculture and water sector projects for which it will act\nas the EA.\n\nH.\n\nADB\u2019s Country Strategy\n\n23. \nThe current country assistance program for Tajikistan is prepared based on the Interim\nOperational  Strategy  (IOS),  which  was  endorsed  by  the  Board  in  1998.  The  objectives  of  the\nIOS are to (i) facilitate the country\u2019s transition to a market economy, (ii) assist in the postconflict\nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction,  and  (iii)  support  natural  disaster  rehabilitation.  To  maximize\nthe  development  impact  of  ADB\u2019s  assistance,  the  IOS  focuses  on  three  priority  areas:  (i)\nagriculture;  (ii)  infrastructure  rehabilitation,  especially  roads  and  power;  and  (iii)  the  social\nsector. While the current IOS remains broadly appropriate, a full country operational strategy is\nscheduled  to  be  prepared  in  2002  based  on  a  poverty  partnership  agreement,  which  will  be\nconcluded with the Government in 2001.\n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nThe  earthquake  and  consequent  flooding  of  May  2001  caused  significant  damage  to\n24. \npublic and private infrastructure and disrupted potable and irrigation water supply to 26,800 ha.\nThe  incidence  attracted  immediate  Government  attention  as  about  90  percent  of  the  affected\npeople  live  below  the  poverty  line.  Although  water  supplies  have  been  partly  restored  through\n\n                  \n\n6  Loan 1714(SF)-TAJ: Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Project, for $5.0 million approved on 2 December 1999.\n7  World  Bank  Loan  33870-TAJ: Rural Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project,  for  $20.0  million,  approved  on  6  July\n\n2000.\n\n\f6\n\ntemporary works with borrowed resources, permanent remedial actions are urgently required to\nfully restore this basic service to affected communities and safeguard against the recurrence of\nsuch  disaster  in  the  project  area.  Unless  a  permanent  solution  is  implemented  urgently,  the\nrestored system remains vulnerable and the local communities\u2019 welfare is at risk of possible loss\nof  life,  damage  to  property,  lost  agricultural  production,  and  reduced  family  incomes.  A\npermanent  solution  will  also  safeguard  against  environmental  damage.  An  emergency\nassistance  to  minimize  the  social  and  economic  impacts  of  the  disaster  is  warranted  by  the\nGovernment\u2019s budgetary constraints, which are expected to continue over the medium term. In\nline  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  of  assistance  after  disasters,  the  proposed  emergency  loan  will  enable\nTajikistan to continue with development financing that otherwise would have been diverted for\ndisaster rehabilitation.\n\nThe  Project  was  formulated  in  close  consultation  with  central  and  local  government\n25. \nofficials, the affected communities, nongovernment organizations, and local groups. The project\ndesign  ensures  a  significant  role  for  the  concerned  regional  and  district  authorities,  including\ntheir participation in project implementation.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n26. \nThe immediate objective of the Project is to fully rehabilitate the household and irrigation\nwater supply system damaged by the earthquake. The long-term objective is to ensure access\nof  the  affected  rural  communities  to  water  supplies  on  a  sustainable  basis  and  thereby  raise\ntheir living standards. The Project will assist the Government to (i) rehabilitate the water supply\ninfrastructure and safeguard against recurrent damage in the affected areas; and (ii) reduce the\nimplementation  of  approved\npossibility \ndevelopment programs.\n\nthat  emergency  expenditures  will  disrupt \n\nthe \n\n27. \nThe  Project  comprises  two  components:  (i)  physical  infrastructure,  and  (ii)  project\nimplementation support. The physical infrastructure works to be implemented under the Project\ninclude  (i)  temporary  restoration  of  Loikasai  siphon,  (ii)  construction  of  Loikasai  bypass  canal,\n(iii) remodeling of Ishmasai bypass canal, (iv) replacement of pipes of Shurchasai siphon, and\n(v) rehabilitation of Pravaya Vetka main canal and Vakhsh-Yavan tunnel. Details of the project\ncomponents are as follows.\n\n1.\n\nPhysical Infrastructure\n\nThe  use  of  an  open  channel  was  found  to  be  the  least-cost  solution  in  the  cases  of\n28. \nLoikasai and Ishmasai siphons. However, in the case of Shurchasai siphon, ground conditions\ndo  not  allow  a  feasible  open  channel  and,  therefore,  replacement  of  pipelines  was  adopted.\nDetails of the works follow.\n\na.\n\nTemporary Restoration of Loikasai Siphon\n\n29. \nTemporary  works  were  completed  under  the  supervision  of  MWRLR  before  end-June\n2001  using  force  account  works  (para.  17  and  18).  The  works  will  continue  to  be  used  until\nLoikasai  bypass  canal  (para.  30)  is  complete.  Later,  these  works  will  remain  as  a  standby\nfacility.\n\n\f7\n\nb.\n\nConstruction of Loikasai Bypass Canal\n\n30. \nThe cost-effective, long-term solution for the damaged Loikasai siphon is a 4.1 km long\nopen  bypass  canal  running  along  the  contour.  MWRLR  has  already  completed  surveys  and\ndesign. With a capacity of 20 m3/sec, the canal will be 8 m wide at the bottom and 3 m deep.\nThe  associated  structures  include  intake  and  outfall  structures,  two  bridges,  and  five  cross-\ndrainage works. The Project will provide for procurement of earth-moving equipment, which will\nbe  used  for  O&M  after  project  completion.  Six  families  living  along  the  alignment  are  being\nresettled.  The  Government  plans  to  complete  its  construction  and  test  running  by  April  2002,\nbefore the start of the next cropping season. As the temporary pipelines are already operational,\nthe  works  on  the  bypass  canal  could  be  conducted  during  both  growing  and  nongrowing\nseasons without interrupting the current level of water supply.\n\nc.\n\nRemodeling of Ishmasai Bypass Canal\n\nA 4.0 m3/sec 5.1 km long bypass canal for Ishmasai siphon was constructed in 1985 to\n31. \naugment the capacity of the siphon and match it with that of the main canal. The bypass canal is\nto be remodeled and its capacity increased to 20 m3/sec so that it can replace Ishmasai siphon.\nThe  Project  provides  for  procurement  of  earth-moving  equipment  which  will  be  used  for  O&M\nafter project completion. As the Ishmasai siphon is operational, remodeling of the bypass canal\ncould  be  undertaken  any  time  of  the  year  without  interrupting  water  supply  in  the  main\nconveyance system.\n\nd.\n\nReplacement of Pipes of Shurchasai Siphon\n\n32. \nSurveys and investigations revealed that the topography of Shurchasai valley does not\nallow  a  feasible  bypass  canal.  Rehabilitation  of  Shurchasai  siphon  involves  replacement  of\npipes.  To  not  disrupt  irrigation  water  supply,  these  works  will  be  conducted  during  the\nnongrowing season. To ensure continuous potable water supply, one pipeline will be replaced at\na time.\n\ne.\n\nRehabilitation  of  Pravaya  Vetka  Main  Canal  and  Vakhsh-Yavan\nTunnel\n\n33. \nTo  sustain  the  benefits  of  the  project  investments,  some  original  design  flaws  of  the\nsystem  need  to  be  readdressed,  and  minor  rehabilitation  of  Pravaya  Vetka  main  canal  and\nVakhsh-Yavan  tunnel  undertaken.  Of  particular  importance  are  the  works  associated  with\nhandling the emergency situations through efficient communication, timely closing of the system\nintakes, and emptying the canal through spill channels. Being associated with the main supply\nline  and  considering  that  the  works  involved  will  need  canal  closure,  these  works  will  be\nscheduled during the nongrowing season.\n\n2.\n\nProject Implementation Support\n\nThe  project  implementation  support  component  will  provide  inputs  for  surveys,\n34. \ninvestigations,  design,  construction  supervision,  environmental  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and\nsocial  impact  assessment.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  by  a  project  management  office\n(PMO) in Dushanbe and a project site office in Yavan (para. 38). For monitoring and evaluation,\nthe PMO will (i) prepare and analyze baseline economic, social, and environmental data in the\nproject  area;  and  (ii)  monitor  and  evaluate  the  Project\u2019s  economic,  social,  and  environmental\nimpacts including the extent to which the negative economic, social, and environmental impacts\n\n\f8\n\nof  the  earthquake  of  7  May  2001  have  been  alleviated  under  the  Project,  as  well  as  the\nBorrower\u2019s utilization of the O&M practices and procedures developed under the associated TA.\n\n35. \nThe  PMO  will  be  supported  by  116  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  input  (para.\n40).  The  consultants  will  assist  in  carrying  out  surveys,  investigations,  design,  construction\nsupervision, environmental monitoring and evaluation, and social impact assessment.\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n36. \nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $4.50  million  equivalent,  of  which  $2.76  million  (61\npercent)  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $1.74  million  equivalent  (39  percent)  the  local\ncurrency  cost.  The  cost  estimates  include  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  $0.40  million\nequivalent  for  taxes  and  duties.  The  foreign  exchange  cost  is  relatively  higher  because\nmachinery,  equipment,  and most  of the construction materials will be imported. A summary of\nthe cost estimates is in Table 1 and detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2.\n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nComponent\n\nA.\n\nBase Costs\n\n1. \n\n2. \n\nPhysical Infrastructure\na.\nb.\nc.\nd.\ne. \n\nTemporary Restoration of Loikasai Siphon\nConstruction of Loikasai Bypass Canal\nRemodeling of Ishmasai Bypass Canal\nReplacement of Pipes of Shurchasai Siphon\nRehabilitation of Pravaya Vetka Main Canal\nand Vakhsh-Yavan Tunnel\nProject Implementation Support\n\nB.\n\nContingencies\n\nSubtotal (A)\n\n1.\n2.\n\nPhysicala\nPriceb\n\nC.\n\nService Chargesc\n\nSubtotal (B)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n2.33\n0.24\n0.85\n0.35\n0.55\n0.34\n\n0.06\n\n2.39\n\n0.25\n0.08\n0.33\n0.04\n\n1.31\n0.24\n0.49\n0.12\n0.28\n0.18\n\n0.19\n\n1.50\n\n0.14\n0.10\n0.24\n0.00\n\n3.64\n0.48\n1.34\n0.47\n0.83\n0.52\n\n0.25\n\n3.89\n\n0.39\n0.18\n0.57\n0.04\n\nTotal\n\nPercent\n\n4.50\n100%\na At 10 to 12 percent for civil works, except for item 1(a) for which no provision was made as it is already complete.\nb At  2.4  percent  for  foreign  exchange  costs,  based  on  the  projections  of  the  manufacturing  unit  value  indices  for\ninflation  in  dollar  terms,  and  at  4  percent  for  first  year  and  7  percent  for  the  following  years  for  local  currency\ncosts.

The provision of local cost financing is\njustified  by  budgetary  constraints  of  the  Government,  and  the  project  focus  on  enhancing  the\nwelfare and living standards of very low income communities in a transition economy (para. 24).\n\n\f9\n\nThe Government will meet the remaining local currency cost of $0.90 million equivalent, or 20\npercent  of  the  total  project  cost.  The  Borrower  will  be  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan.  The\nGovernment  will  make \nthrough  budgetary\nappropriations. The loan will be provided from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources and with a term\nof 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1 percent per year\nduring the grace period and 1.5 percent thereafter.

MWRLR,  the  EA,  is  currently  responsible  for  O&M  of  water  conveyance  systems.\nMWRLR has established a PMO in Dushanbe, and will establish a project site office in Yavan\nwithin  one  month  of  loan  effectiveness.  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  overall  project\nmanagement,  including  approval  of  designs,  preparation  and  evaluation  of  tenders,  award  of\ncontracts,  and  procurement  of  materials  and  equipment;  (ii)  recruitment  and  supervision  of\ndomestic consultants; (iii) supervision of implementation and quality control of project works; (iv)\nliaison with beneficiary communities; (v) monitoring and evaluation of Project impacts; and (vi)\npreparation of reports and communications with ADB. The PMO will be staffed by local experts\nsupported  by  domestic  consultants.  The  organization  chart  for  project  implementation  is  in\nAppendix 3.\n\n39. \nA  project  steering  committee  will  be  established  to  ensure  overall  coordination,  review\nimplementation  progress,  identify  issues,  determine  measures  to  address  the  issues,  and\nprovide guidance. The steering committee will be chaired by the deputy prime minister in charge\nof  the  ministries  of  transport,  trade,  construction,  energy,  industry,  and  emergency  situations;\nand comprise representatives from MWRLR; the ministries of agriculture, finance, environment\nprotection; and CLCND. The committee will meet quarterly or more frequently if required.\n\n2.\n\nConsulting Services\n\nA total of 116 person-months of domestic consulting services financed from loan will be\n40. \nrequired  to  assist  project  implementation.  The  project  works  are  simple  engineering  and\nconstruction  works,  and  adequately  qualified  and  experienced  domestic  consultants  are\navailable.  Therefore,  the  services  of  international  consultants  are  not  considered  necessary.\nThe  consultants  will  be  responsible  for  surveys,  investigations,  detailed  design,  preparation  of\ntender  documents,  construction  supervision,  quality  control,  environmental  monitoring,  and\nsocial  assessment.  Field  engineers  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  supervision  of  the\ncontractors.\n\n41. \nThe  Government  will  select  and  engage  consultants  through  a  consulting  firm  in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements\n\n\f10\n\nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  selection  and  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  terms  of\nreference for the consulting services are in Appendix 4.\n\n3.\n\nProcurement\n\n42. \nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be  carried  out  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Tentative packaging of major contracts is\ngiven  in  Appendix  5.  The  package  of  temporary  works  was  completed  using  force  account\nprocedures;  the  ongoing  construction  of  Loikasai  bypass  canal  is  also  using  force  account\nprocedures. The remaining civil works packages are small. Considering that the project site is\nlocated  in  a  remote  area  with  security  risks,  the  Project  is  unlikely  to  attract  international\ncontractors. International shopping procedures will be used for contracts amounting to $800,000\nequivalent  or  more,  and  local  competitive  bidding  will  be  used  for  civil  works  packages\namounting  to  less  than  $800,000  equivalent.  Certain  civil  works  for  temporary  restoration  of\nLoikasai  siphon  and  construction  of  Loikasai  bypass  canal,  each  estimated  to  cost  the\nequivalent of $700,000 or less, may be carried out by MWRLR on a force account basis. The\nGovernment  has  been  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  and  corresponding  provisions\nunder ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement (para. 54)\n\n4.\n\nAdvance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing\n\n43. \nAt  the  Government\u2019s  request,  ADB  has  approved  (i)  advance  action  for  recruitment  of\nconsultants, and procurement of equipment and civil works; and (ii) retroactive financing of the\nproject works from 8 May 2001. Advance action is necessary to expedite project implementation\nconsidering  that  the  proposed  works  are  critical  for  restoring  normalcy  in  the  social  and\neconomic  life  of  the  affected  communities.  Retroactive  financing  will  ease  the  Government\u2019s\nbudgetary  constraints  and  minimize  the  impact  of  the  disaster  on  its  development  plan.\nRetroactive  financing  will  be  limited  to  loan-related  expenditures  since  8  May  2001  until  loan\neffectiveness, and is subject to a ceiling of $1.0 million equivalent.\n\n5.\n\nDisbursement Procedures\n\nTo  expedite  project  implementation  through  timely  release  of  the  loan  proceeds,  the\n44. \nGovernment  will  establish  an  imprest  account  promptly  after  loan  effectiveness  with  an  initial\ndeposit of $0.5 million equivalent. The imprest account will be established at a commercial bank\nacceptable  to  ADB,  and  will  be  managed  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  detailed\narrangements  agreed  upon  by  the  Government  and  ADB,  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan\nDisbursement Handbook. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedure will be used to reimburse\nexpenditures and liquidate the imprest account for payments not exceeding $100,000 equivalent\neach. The experience of the EFPR and a recent World Bank review of the CLCND accounting\nsystem  suggest  that  the  Government  has  the  capacity  to  maintain  an  imprest  account  and\nexpenditure record in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards.\n\n6.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n45. \nThe Project will be implemented over one-and-a-half years with physical completion by\n30  April  2003.  Appendix  6  illustrates  the  proposed  scheduling  of  the  rehabilitation  works.  The\nmost urgent task is to construct Loikasai bypass canal before the end of April 2002 to restore\nirrigation  supplies  by  the  beginning  of  the  cropping  season.  During  the  winter  months  of\n2001/2003,  Pravaya  Vetka  main  canal  and  Vakhsh-Yavan  tunnel  will  be  rehabilitated.  Other\n\n\f11\n\nmajor  reconstruction  will  be  undertaken  between  October  2002  and  April  2003  so  as  not  to\ndisrupt farming activities.\n\n7.\n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit\n\n46.  MWRLR  will  submit  brief  quarterly  and  annual  reports  to  ADB  indicating  the  progress\nmade  and  problems  encountered  during  the  review  period,  the  steps  taken  or  proposed  to\nremedy the problems, the proposed program of activities, and the expected progress during the\nfollowing period. Within three months of physical completion of the Project, the Government will\nsubmit to ADB a completion report providing details about implementation, costs, benefits, and\nother information requested by ADB.\n\n47.  MWRLR will maintain separate accounts and financial statements for the Project, which\nwill  be  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  A  separate  audit  opinion\non the use of the imprest account and statement of expenditure procedures will be included in\nthe annual audit report. The Government will provide ADB with an audited report together with\naudited accounts and financial statements nine months after the end of each fiscal year.\n\n48. \nThe  Government  was  informed  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  submission  of  audited  accounts,\nwhich covers failure to submitt audited accounts and financial statements by the due date. If the\ndelay in submitting financial statements is more than six months (i) no commitment letter will be\nissued, and (ii) new contract awards may not be approved by ADB. If the delay is more than 12\nmonths, loan disbursements may be suspended or the loan may be canceled.\n\n8.\n\nMidterm Review\n\n49. \nThe Government and ADB will jointly carry out a midterm review of the Project, after the\nend  of  the  first  year  of  its  implementation.  The  midterm  review  will  assess  (i)  implementation\nstatus; (ii) design and construction standards; (iii) physical progress made and disbursements in\nrelation  to  the  implementation  schedule;  (iv)  Government  utilization  of  the  O&M  practices  and\nprocedures, monitoring mechanisms, and data developed under the associated TA (para. 59);\n(v)  performance  of  the  consultants  and  contractors;  and  (vi)  status  of  compliance  with  the\ncovenants stipulated in the Loan Agreement. The midterm review will also assess the need for\nany  additional  works  or  changes  in  the  project  scope  to  take  account  of  any  delayed\nconsequences of earthquake activity.\n\n9.\n\nCommunity Participation\n\n50. \nThe  proposed  activities  were  discussed  in  detail  with  local  government  officials  and\nrepresentatives  of  the  affected  communities.  All  concerned  placed  high  priority  on  the\nrestoration of the water conveyance system at the earliest opportunity. The communities were\ninformed  of  the  proposed  solution  and  time  frame,  and  are  well  aware  of  the  implications  for\ntheir  welfare.  The  proposed  solution  is  not  expected  to  have  any  negative  impact  on  the\ncommunities.  The  land  required  for  the  bypass  canals  is  not  cultivated  and  is  not  privately\nowned.\n\n51. \nThe Government agreed to ensure that the Project is designed and implemented, to the\nextent  possible,  with  active  participation  of  the  project  beneficiaries,  using  participatory\npractices,  as  described  in  ADB\u2019s  handbook,  Mainstreaming  Participatory  Development\nProcesses.  The  Government  also  agreed  to  take  necessary  actions  to  ensure  that  the\ninformation campaign under the associated TA (para. 59) for men, women, and school children\n\n\f12\n\non the structures and functioning of the Yavan water conveyance system, annual maintenance\nrequirements for the system, and the reconstruction works is carried out in a timely manner.\n\n10.\n\nOperation and Maintenance\n\n52. \nThe  rehabilitated  facilities  will  continue  to  be  the  responsibility  of  MWRLR  and  its\nrespective  local  branches.  Currently,  households  and  farmers  pay  for  their  water,  and  the\ncollected fees are utilized by the delivery agencies to help maintain the systems. However, the\nsums  collected  are  insufficient  to  maintain  these  systems  over  the  longer  term.  The  issue  of\ninadequate O&M is a complex one, linked to ability to pay and requires a phased approach that\nis  applicable  across  the  irrigation  and  water  supply  network.  The  Government  recognizes  the\nimportance  of  ensuring  adequate  funding  and  has  agreed  to  a  phased  program  to  gradually\nincrease cost recovery levels as a condition of the World Bank\u2019s RIRP,8 which is commencing in\n2001. The proposed Project will supplement the RIRP through the associated TA (para. 59) by\nreviewing  practices  and  helping  establish  procedures  for  proper  O&M  of  the  project  facilities.\nThe TA will also run an information campaign to inform the communities of the structures and\nfunctions  of  the  entire  system,  the  necessary  annual  maintenance,  and  construction  works\nbeing undertaken.\n\n11.\n\nResettlement\n\n53. \nThe  Project  does  not  involve  any  land  acquisition  but  involves  resettlement  of  six\nfamilies living along the alignment of Loikasai bypass canal. These families are being resettled\nin  the  same(cid:1) jamoat9 about  1.3  km  from  the  original  place.  The  Government  prepared  the\ncompensation  packages  in  consultation  with  the  affected  families,  and  the  construction  of  the\nhouses at the new location has commenced. The Appraisal Mission visited the families, inquired\nabout  their  resettlement,  and  witnessed  construction  of  the  houses.  The  families  have  better\naccess to potable water, markets, and education and health facilities. The Government assured\nADB  that  the  families  will  be  resettled  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  Tajik  laws  and\nregulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement.  The  short  resettlement  plan\nprepared by the Government is in Appendix 7.\n\n12.\n\nGovernance and Anticorruption\n\n54. \nDuring project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to the central and\nlocal  governments.  Attention  was  drawn  to  the  section  on  fraud  and  corruption  in  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement,  particularly  the  need  for  bidders,  suppliers,  and  contractors  to\nobserve  the  highest  standards  of  ethics  in  procurement  and  execution  of  ADB-financed\ncontracts, and the sanctions if fraud and corruption are discovered. Similarly, the anticorruption\nprovisions in ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants were discussed.\n\n                  \n\n8  The Yavan irrigation system area is included in the ongoing RIRP (footnote 7). The RIRP covers 130,000 ha; its\nscope includes (i) formulation and adoption of a water code that will provide the legal base for establishment and\nfunctioning of water users\u2019 associations (WUAs), (ii) establishment of WUAs responsible for O&M of irrigation and\ndrainage  system,  collecting  water  charges  from  the  beneficiaries,  and  paying  for  services  of  the  distribution\nsystem; and (iii) establishment of a transparent system of irrigation service fee with progressive increases in level\nand improvement of collection rates. Full cost recovery, particularly for O&M, will be achieved over 10 years for\ndelivery of water from source to the farmer\u2019s field. The Government will provide funds to meet the shortfalls during\nthe transition period.\n\n9  A jamoat is the smallest administrative unit\n\n\fF.\n\nThe Executing Agency\n\n13\n\n55.  MWRLR is the primary agency responsible for water resource management and is under\nthe  authority  of  the  deputy  prime  minister  in  charge  of  the  ministries  of  agriculture,  water\nresources  and  land  reclamation,  and  environment  protection.  It  has  a  network  of  region  and\ndistrict  offices,  which  are  responsible  for  O&M  of  the  systems  within  their  jurisdiction.  Most\nMWRLR professional staff are engineers with a range of skills; the remainder are economists,\naccountants, and lawyers. The staff are rapidly becoming familiar with the procedures followed\nby  multilateral  agencies  having  experience  working  with  ADB,  World  Bank,  and  Islamic\nDevelopment Bank. MWRLR staff made a creditable job of preparing material for the Appraisal\nMission and in designing the Project. Given their detailed knowledge of the water supply system\ninvolved,  its  relatively  small  size,  and  the  essentially  engineering  nature  of  the  activities,\nMWRLR is considered to be capable of managing the Project with the TA support (para. 59). To\nthe  extent  that  additional  resources  are  needed,  MWRLR  can  call  upon  the  experience  of\nCLCND, which has performed well in implementing the ADB-financed EFRP.\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironment\n\nTajikistan  has  an  environment  that  is  prone  to  natural  disasters  related  to  its\n56. \nmountainous  terrain,  steep  and  narrow  river  valleys,  sparse  mountain  vegetation,  and  annual\nsnowmelt. These natural characteristics have been exacerbated by poor management of natural\nresources. During construction, care will be taken to avoid dust creation and the contamination\nof  water  supplies  that  may  adversely  affect  local  communities  and  livestock.  Construction\nstockpiles and site facilities will use existing buildings as much as possible. If not, they will be\nlocated on wasteland to avoid the destruction of trees and vegetation and to minimize hazards\nto  the  local  population  who  should  be  consulted  on  their  location.  The  main  environmental\nproblem associated with operation of the rehabilitated infrastructure will be the need for proper\nO&M  and  preventing  the  risk  of  similar  damage.  The  mitigation  strategy  will  concentrate  on\nimproving O&M through training and awareness of engineering staff, improved management of\nO&M activities, and a medium-term program to increase the level of funding from a combination\nof  budgetary  support  and  beneficiary  contributions.  The  associated  TA  (para.  59)  will  address\nthese institutional and financing issues. The Government agreed to put in place during project\nimplementation  the  environmental  mitigative  measures  proposed  in  the  summary  initial\nenvironmental examination given in Appendix 8.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Analysis\n\n57. \nAccording to the local administration, the incidence of poverty in the project area is about\n90 percent, higher than the 83 percent at the national level. The social structure of the project\narea  is  one  of  relatively  small  jamoats  with  a  majority  Tajik  population,  but  commonly  some\nother ethnic groups are represented. Virtually all households have a 0.15 ha household plot on\nwhich they grow food crops intensively. These plots are dependent on the same source of water\nsupply  as  the  household.  Additional  income  may  come  from  dehkan  (privatized  farm)  land\nshares usually used to grow cotton and from remittances sent by male members of families who\nseek seasonal work in the Russian Federation. The most vulnerable groups in these villages are\nhouseholds with more than five children, single households headed by women, families without\ndehkan  land,  and  the  elderly/infirm.  The  Project  will  benefit  all  households  but  will  inevitably\nbenefit those families with irrigated land the most. However, considering the preponderance of\n\n\f14\n\nthe  poor  in  the  project  area,  the  project  beneficiaries  will  be  predominantly  households  living\nbelow the poverty line. An initial social assessment of the project area is in Appendix 9.\n\n58. \nThe Project involves resettlement of six families (para. 53). The Government has given\nassurance  that  the  families  are  being  resettled  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  on\nResettlement.\n\nH.\n\nThe Technical Assistance\n\n59. \nThe TA will review practices and help establish procedures for proper O&M of the Yavan\nconveyance  system  facilities,  and  build  MWRLR  capacity  for  construction  management  and\nsupervision.  By  establishing  procedures,  determining  inputs,  and  instituting  a  monitoring\nmechanism  with  strong  beneficiary  participation  for  proper  O&M,  the  TA  will  ensure\nsustainability of project benefits. Also, through hands-on training, the TA will introduce MWRLR\nstaff  to  efficient  practices  for  construction  management  and  supervision  that  will  considerably\nimprove the capacity of the staff for cost-effectiveness and quality construction. About 4 person-\nmonths of international and 15 person-months of domestic consulting input will be required at a\ncost  of  $170,000  equivalent.  This  comprises  foreign  exchange  costs  of  $116,000  and  local\ncurrency costs of $54,000 equivalent. ADB will finance the TA by providing $135,000 equivalent\nfrom  ADB-funded  TA  program  on  a  grant  basis.  The  Government  will  finance  $35,000\nequivalent of the local currency costs. The consultants will be selected and engaged through a\nconsulting  firm  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other\narrangements  for  the  selection  and  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  details  on\nspecialists, terms of reference, and cost estimates of the TA are in Appendix 10.\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA.\n\nImpact on Poverty and Other Benefits\n\n60. \n The project benefits will result from full restoration of the water supply disrupted by the\ndamaged water conveyance system. About 56,000 people in the project area will be assured of\nreliable  potable  water  supply.  In  addition,  about  11,724  ha  of  cropped  areas  will  receive\nirrigation water on a sustainable basis. This is a critical element of combined efforts to improve\nliving  standards  in  rural  areas.  The  project  works  will  also  provide  a  temporary  source  of\nemployment  for  local  labor  and  a  small  but  attractive  market  for  provisioning  the  construction\nworkforce.  The  restoration  of  facilities  will  enable  local  communities  to  concentrate  their  time\nand  efforts  on  economically  rewarding  tasks,  mostly  agricultural,  such  as  crop  and  livestock\nproduction, instead of concerning themselves with the logistics of a temporary water supply. As\na  consequence,  health  concerns  will  recede  and  family  cash  flows  will  return  to  normal.  An\nexperienced  domestic  consultant  will  be  recruited  under  the  associated  TA  (para.  59)  to\nundertake a social impact analysis of the restored system.\n\nB.\n\nRisks\n\nThe  major  risk  to  the  Project  will  be  the  possibility  of  further  disruption  to  the  system\n61. \nbefore all remedial works are completed. This risk will be mitigated by frequent inspection of the\nsystem  during  implementation  and  by  completing  the  rehabilitation  of  the  weakest  part  of  the\nsystem first. The risk of failure of other siphons, which are currently intact but are as old as the\ndamaged siphon and pose a threat, will be mitigated by replacing Ishmasai siphon by a bypass\ncanal and replacing pipes of Shurchasai siphon. Rehabilitation of the Pravaya Vetka main canal\nand Vakhsh-Yavan tunnel will minimize the risk of future disruption of flows in the project area.\n\n\fLast, the associated TA will help the Government determine practices and establish procedures\nfor proper O&M and generate adequate funds for this purpose (para. 59), which will safeguard\nagainst recurrence of such disaster.\n\n15\n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n62. \nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  Project  will  be  designed  and  implemented  with  the  active  participation  of\nProject  beneficiaries, \nthe  participatory  practices\nin  ADB\u2019s  handbook  Mainstreaming  Participatory  Development\nsuggested \nProcesses.\n\nincluding  application  of \n\nIn  consultation  with  ADB,  the  Government  will  utilize  the  O&M  practices  and\nprocedures,  monitoring  mechanisms  and  data  developed  under  the  TA  in  its\nphased program to increase cost recovery.  This utilization will be monitored and\nevaluated by PMO and included in the scope of the Project\u2019s mid-term review.\n\nAll  necessary  environmental  approvals  and  clearances  will  be  obtained  in  a\ntimely  manner  in  accordance  with  applicable  Tajik  environmental  laws  and\nregulations,  and  the  Project  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  such  laws\nand regulations and ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines, including carrying out of the\nenvironmental mitigative measures set forth in the summary initial environmental\nexamination.\n\n(iv) \n\nAdequate counterpart funds will be made available in a timely manner.\n\n(v) \n\nResettlement  of  the  six  families  affected  by  construction  of  the  Loikasai  bypass\ncanal  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement  plan  agreed\nbetween  the  Government  and  ADB,  applicable  Tajik  laws  and  regulations,  and\nADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement.\n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\n63. \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to\nSpecial Drawing Rights 2,795,000 to the Republic of Tajikistan for the Emergency Restoration\nof Yavan Water Conveyance System Project, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period\nof  8  years,  and  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace\nperiod  and  1.5  percent  per  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are\nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement  presented  to  the\nBoard.\n\n(Date)\n\nTADAO CHINO\n   President\n\n\f16\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNumber\n\nTitle\n\nPage\n\nCited on\n(page, para.)\n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\n7. \n\n8. \n\n9. \n\nProject Framework\n\nProject Costs and Financing Plan\n\nOrganization Chart for Project Implementation\n\nTerms of Reference for Consulting Services\n\nTentative Packaging of Major Procurement\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nShort Resettlement Plan\n\nSummary Initial Environmental Examination\n\nSummary Initial Social Assessment\n\n10. \n\nTechnical Assistance for Support for Facilitating Sustainable\nProject Benefits\n\n17\n\n19\n\n23\n\n24\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n\n33\n\n39\n\n43\n\n1, 4\n\n8, 36\n\n9, 38\n\n9, 41\n\n10, 42\n\n10, 45\n\n12, 53\n\n13, 56\n\n13, 57\n\n14, 59\n\n\f17\n\nAppendix 1, page 1\n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\n\nDesign Summary\n\nPerformance Targets\n\nMonitoring\nMechanisms\n\nAssumptions and\nRisks\n\n\u2022  Agriculture sector and\nsocial performance\nparameters for selected\npopulation\n\nNational\nstatistics and\nsample\nsurveys\n\n1.

The  option  of  the\nbypass  canal  against  rehabilitation  of  the  existing  siphon\nwas  found  to  be  the  most  cost-effective  solution.  The\naffected  families  have  been  given  0.15  plots  each  for\nhouse building in an area which is about 1.3 km away and\nhas better access to potable water supply, education, and\nhealth  facilities;  and  is  better  connected  through  access\nroads.  Compensation  amounts  have  been  determined  at\nthe  current  market  rates  (see  attached  Deed,  and\nAmendment to Deed).\n\nThe  objective  of  the  resettlement  plan  is  to  facilitate\nresettlement  of  the  affected  families  in  accordance  with\nthe  Government  of  Tajikistan  laws  and  relevant  ADB\nguidelines. The entitlements have been determined in line\nwith  the  existing  laws,  current  market  prices,  and  assets\nand needs of the affected beneficiaries.\n\nThe  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared \nin  due\nconsultation  with  the  beneficiaries  and  they  are  being\nconsulted  during  the  implementation  stage.

Accordingly,  the\nGovernment has provided 0.15 ha lot to each family and\nhas determined the compensation amounts using current\nmarket  rates.  The  Government  has  also  provided  free\ntransport of their property and construction materials. The\nlivelihood  of  the  families  has  not  been  affected  mainly\nbecause the new location is only 1.3 km away.\n\nInstitutional framework The  Commission  for  Resettlement,  which  has  as  its\nmembers the key specialists involved in resettlement (see\nDeed,  Attachment  1),  has  determined  compensation\namounts  and  has  prepared  the  plan.  The  Commission  is\nalso  monitoring  its  implementation.  The  Commission  will\nevaluate the activity after it is complete.\n\nResettlement  budget\nand financing\n\nAn  amount  of  67,211  somoni  has  been  allocated  for\nresettlement  (see  Deed,  Attachment  1).  In  addition,  the\nGovernment  has  provided  (i)  0.15  ha  lot  to  each  family,\n(ii)  vehicles  for  transportation  of  property,  (iii)  assistance\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n\f30\n\nAppendix 7, page 2\n\nto dismantle their former houses, and (iv) transportation of\nthe  construction  materials  to  the  new  location  (see\namendment to Deed, Attachment 2). Of the compensation\namount, an amount of 100 somoni was paid at the time of\nrelocation.  The  remaining  amount  is  being/will  be  paid\nduring house construction\n\nResettlement started on 14 July 2006, the transfer of the\nfamilies together with their assets to the resettlement site\nwas  completed  on  25  July  2001.  Currently,  the  families\nare  living  in  tents  provided  by  the  Government  while\nconstruction of houses is ongoing. Construction of house\nis  scheduled  to  be  completed  in  October  2001,  well\nbefore the next winter season.\n\nThe  Commission  for  Resettlement  established  for  the\nfamilies  affected  by  the  Project  is,  in  close  consultation\nwith  the  affected  families,  monitoring  the  progress  of\nresettlement  and  will  continue \nit.

The  earthquake  led  to  disruption  of  water  supplies  to  approximately  56,000\npeople,  65,000  livestock,  and  11,724  hectares  (ha)  of  arable  land.  The  Government  agencies\ntook  immediate  steps  to  alleviate  the  plight  of  the  affected  population  and  asked  the  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  emergency  assistance  to  restore  the  water  conveyance\nsystem.\n\nthe \n\nThis  report  is  summary  initial  environmental  examination  of  the  proposed  loan  to  the\n2. \nTajikistan for the Emergency Restoration of Yavan Water Conveyance System Project. For the\nemergency  project, \ninitial  environmental  examination  was  carried  out  urgently,\nrecommending  some  environmental  issues  to  be  addressed  in  more  detail  during  project\nimplementation.  The  findings  contribute  to  the  ongoing  technical  assistance  (TA)  No.  3614,1\nwhich aims to strengthen the national environmental assessment capacity. In addition, findings\nof the Reconnaissance and Appraisal missions in May and June 2001 were used in preparing\nthis  report.  Materials  have  also  been  drawn  from  TA  3514,2  which  has  two  of  the  three\nsubproject  areas  in  the  same  oblast.  The  location  of  the  area  in  the  southwestern  part  of  the\ncountry is presented in the map.\n\nB. \n\nDescription of the Project\n\n3. \nThe Yavan water conveyance system was completed in 1968. It originates from Baipazin\nReservoir on Vakhsh River and serves Gozimalik, Khodzamaston, and Yavan districts, about 65\nkilometers (km) southeast of the capital city Dushanbe. The system takes water from the river\nthrough a 7.3 km tunnel whose outlet is in the neighboring valley adjacent to the town of Yavan.\nThe water passes from the tunnel to the canal, which has a design capacity of 50 cubic meters\nper second (m3/sec) and irrigates an area of about 26,800 ha. After the initial reach of 27.6 km,\nwhere the system serves an area of 15,526 ha, the canal capacity is reduced to 20 m3/sec. It\ntraverses  three  valleys  using  inverted  siphons,  before  entering  Gozimalik  district.  Because  of\ndeterioration of various parts of the system over time, the flow in the siphons is generally limited\nto 17 m3/sec. During more than 30 years of use, the pipes have become severely corroded. The\nthickness  has  been  reduced  to  an  alarming  level.  Maintenance  of  the  facilities  has  been\ninadequate because of poor cost recovery from the beneficiaries.\n\n4. \nThe  earthquake  caused  cracks  in  both  the  pipelines  and  the  open  canal  parts  of  the\nsystem.  The  most  severe  cracks  occurred  at  the  intake  structure  of  Loikasai  siphon.  Water\npoured  from  the  cracks  soaking  the  soil  under  the  structure.  The  soil,  consisting  mainly  of\nalluvial deposits, was washed away, and the structure collapsed. Although the regulating gates\nwere  closed,  water  continued  to  flow  until  the  upstream  siphon  and  open  canals  were  empty.\nAbout  600  meter  (m)  of  Loikasai  siphon,  and  100  m  of  the  open  canal  above  the  intake  were\nwashed away.\n\n5. \nThe  immediate  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  fully  restore  the  irrigation  and  household\nwater  supply  damaged  by  the  earthquake  and  consequent  flooding  of  the  valley.  The\n                                                          \n1  TA  3614-TAJ:  Capacity Building for Environmental Assessment and Monitoring,  for  $600,000,  approved  on\n\n21 December 2000.\n\n2  TA 3514-TAJ: Agriculture Rehabilitation Project, for $750,000, approved on 10 October 2000.\n\n\f34\n\nAppendix 8, page 2\n\ncomponents of the Project are (i) physical infrastructure, and (ii) project implementation support.\nThe restoration of the water conveyance system in the project area and safeguarding it against\nfailure  risk  involves  the  following  works,  under  the  supervision  of  the  Ministry  of  Water\nResources and Land Reclamation (MWRLR):\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nLoikasai  siphon  has  been  temporarily  restored.  The  works  included  two  parallel\npipelines (9.0 m3/sec) to restore water supply in the main system, and a pipeline\n(0.5  m3/sec)  to  supply  the  local  areas.  They  are  needed  until  Loikasai  bypass\ncanal is complete. Later, they will remain as a standby system.\n\nConstruction of Loikasai bypass canal, 4.1 km long running along the contour, is\na cost-effective, long-term solution to replace the damaged siphon. The canal will\nbe  8  m  wide  at  the  bottom  and  3  m  deep,  with  a  capacity  of  20  m3/sec.  The\nassociated structures include the intake and outfall structures, two bridges, and 5\ncross-drainage  works.  Six  families  living  along  the  alignment  need  to  be\nresettled.\n\nRemodeling  of  Ishmasai  bypass  canal  for  a  capacity  of  20  m3/sec,  originally\nconstructed  in  1985  for  a  capacity  of  4.0  m3/sec,  is  a  cost-effective  way  to\nreplace the aging siphon.\n\nRehabilitation  of  Shurchasai  siphon  by  replacing  its  pipes  with  new  ones  is\nnecessary,  as  the  topography  of  the  valley  does  not  allow  a  feasible  bypass\ncanal.\n\nRehabilitation  of  Pravaya  Vetka  main  canal  and  Vakhsh\u2013Yavan  tunnel  are\nneeded to sustain the benefits of the project investments. Some original design\nflaws of the system need to be readdressed.\n\nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment\n\n6. \nTajikistan is the most southerly of the former Soviet Union Central Asian republics, which\nbecame independent in 1991. It is bordered to the north by the Kyrgyz Republic, in the east by\nthe Peoples Republic of China, Afghanistan to the south, and Uzbekistan in the west. The area\nis  143,000  square  kilometers,  divided  into  four  regions,  namely  Sughd  in  the  north,  Region  of\nRepublican  Subordination  in  the  center,  Khatlon  in  the  south,  and  the  mainly  mountainous\nGorno-Badakshan in the east.\n\n7. \nThe  climate  is  continental,  with  cold  winters  and  hot,  dry  summers,  although  the\nrelatively southerly latitude has an ameliorating impact, and altitude is a significant local factor.\nThe  lowland  agricultural  areas  have  an  average  summer  temperature  of  about  26\u00baC  and  the\nwinter  average  of  6\u00baC.  The  growing  season  of  over  220  days  is  long  by  Central  Asian\nstandards. The rainfall is low, averaging 150 to 250 millimeters (mm) per year, falling mainly in\nwinter and spring, and evaporation is high. As a consequence, agriculture is highly dependent\non irrigation. At higher altitudes, temperature declines, the growing season shortens, and snow\ncover  is  common  for  much  of  the  winter.  Soils  are  typically  silty  gray-brown  desert  soils  of\nalluvial  origin  and  relatively  low  inherent  fertility.  Concentration  of  organic  matter  is  low,\nerodibility  high.  Groundwater  levels  are  high.  Water  logging  and  secondary  salinization  are\nsignificant  environmental  problems,  caused  by  failing  drainage  infrastructure  and  poor  water\nmanagement.  Floods  may  occur  at  any  time  due  to  adverse  weather.  Tajikistan  is  a\nmountainous country, only 960,000 ha are designated as cultivable land. The amount of arable\n\n\f35\n\nAppendix 8, page 3\n\nland  per  rural  household  is  only  0.9  ha  plus  about  3.5  ha  pasture.  Significant  areas  of  often\nsteeply sloping land have been utilized, resulting in increased risk of erosion.\n\n8. \nPoverty, an overriding environmental issue in Tajikistan, is endemic in the rural areas: 83\npercent of rural households are unable to reach the Government\u2019s minimal consumption basket\nequivalent to approximately TJS20 per person per month. The rural poor eat an inadequate diet,\nhave insufficient income or production to provide food for all seasons, and have low stocks of\nfood.  Single  women,  households  headed  by  women,  children,  and  orphans  are  thought  to  be\nparticularly vulnerable, as well as large families and those living in remote areas. Poverty tends\nto increase as availability of land per household member decreases.\n\n9. \nLivelihoods  are  based  on  irrigated  cotton  cultivation.  About  40  percent  of  all  irrigated\nland  is  planted  to  cotton,  which  is  heavily  taxed.  Food  crops  may  be  grown  on  the  remaining\nirrigated land and on household plots. Food insecurity has resulted in extensive hand-cultivation\nof  grazing  lands  on  the  surrounding  hills  for  winter  wheat.  Livestock  are  important  for\nsubsistence. About 20 percent of rural communities had piped water supplies during the Soviet\nera,  but  few  of  those  schemes  have  survived  the  past  decade.  Many  rural  households  now\ndepend on surface water, usually rivers or canals. Low hygienic and chemical quality of water is\na  major  factor  contributing  to  the  high  level  of  malnutrition  among  children.  Morbidity  of  the\npopulation with malaria in 1999 was 222 per 100,000 population.\n\n10. \nAdministration is controlled by the central Government. Its agencies are represented at\nboth the oblast (region) and rayon (district) levels, with suboffices at jamoat (village) level where\nneeded.\n\n11. \nAs a summary, Tajikistan has an environment that is prone to natural disasters related to\nits  dynamic  mountainous  terrain,  steep  and  narrow  river  valleys,  sparse  mountain  vegetation,\nand  annual  snowmelt.  Those  natural  characteristics  have  been  exacerbated  by  deforestation\nand  overgrazing,  which  were  features  of  the  former  regime.  In  addition,  salinization  of\nagricultural  soils  resulting  from  poorly  managed  irrigation  systems  is  a  growing  problem.\nSelective reforestation, improved pasture management, and more effective irrigation and water\nsupply systems would have a positive impact on environmental conditions.\n\nD. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigative Measures\n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Issues Arising from the Project Location\n\n12. \nEnvironmental  impact  related  to  the  location  can  be  considered  small  considering  the\nneed to relocate only six households and compensate the permanent and temporary losses of\nland areas. The principles of compensation are presented in the assurances of the Government.\nThe  issues  include  (i)  lost  income  during  the  processing  and  replacement  of  the  housing  and\nproperties  for  relocation  of  the  household;  (ii)  loss  of  productive  land  due  to  excavation  works\nand dumping of the materials; (iii) loss of connection to the market and other community, or to\npastures and remote parts of the farm; and (iv) loss of land at the borrowing sites, construction\nareas, and areas needed for facilities. Timely liquidation and implementation is important. Most\nsensitive  areas  are  located  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  new  canals,  and  those  to  be\nexpanded. Temporary losses should be addressed correspondingly.\n\nPossible changes in groundwater levels and salinity risks are considered small, but they\n13. \nshould  be  monitored  during  project  implementation.  Lost  access  to  groundwater,  as  well  as\nweakened drainage of farmland should be compensated.\n\n\f36\n\nAppendix 8, page 4\n\nNegative effects on biodiversity seem insignificant based on the brief survey. However,\n14. \nthe  possible  sensitive  areas,  which  will  be  destroyed  or  harmed  by  the  Project,  should  be\nchecked during the design and implementation, as well as the possible cultural heritages.\n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Issues Arising from Project Design\n\n15. \nThe  hydrogeological  and  geological  properties  of  the  soils  to  be  excavated  should  be\nmonitored  to  keep  the  risks  minimal.  A  particular  concern  is  the  somewhat  unforeseeable\nstability, as well as chemical composition, of the alluvial sediments. Appropriate representative\nprofiles  should  be  surveyed  prior  to  digging.    Although  salinity  is  the  main  chemical  concern,\nsome  representative  groundwater  samples  should  be  analyzed  to  eliminate  the  risk  of  heavy\nmetals or other elements that could harm the water quality for irrigation and potable purposes.\n\n16. \nDumping  sites  for  the  excavated  materials,  as  well  as  the  borrowing  sites,  should  be\ndefined  in  the  context  of  other  engineering  design.  Landscaping  after  the  works  should  be\naddressed,  with  particular  attention  to  erosion  control.  A  rough  estimate  of  the  amount  of\nlandmasses to be removed is 1-2 million m3, which requires careful planning. The masses may\nbe used to fill waterlogged claypots or other areas suitable for mosquito breeding. Particularly,\nthe  design  should  not  allow  creation  of  new  waterlogged  wetlands  by  cutting  the  drainage  of\nfloods.\n\n17. \nThe working camps and engine stations should be designed with appropriate sanitation\nfacilities and maintenance areas to prevent spills of the oil or other chemicals to the ground or\ngroundwater. Inspectors should be trained and appointed to supervise those practices. A useful\ntool  is  a  monthly  environmental  report,  to  be  required  from  each  of  the  contractors.  The\ncontracts should state the environmental responsibilities in detail.\n\n18.  With  these  mitigative  measures  implemented,  the  adverse  environmental  impact\nresulting  from  the  construction  stage  is  considered  minor,  except  the  increased  suspended\nsolids in the water, as well as siltation and corrosion of the structures.  The high concentration of\nsuspended  solids  may  apparently  last  several  years  after  the  construction  works  have  been\ncompleted, depending on the efficiency of erosion control measures that have been taken.\n\n3. \n\nEnvironmental Issues Associated with Construction Stage\n\n19. \nDuring  the  construction,  negative  environmental  impacts  can  be  reduced  to  an\nacceptable level by applying appropriate mitigative measures and monitoring as designed. The\nmain  concern  is  erosion  control.  Monitoring  of  the  possible  cavitation  in  canals,  erosion  and\nreplantation  of  slopes,  and  control  of  hydrological  changes  in  the  vicinity  of  the  working  sites\nshould be continuous. Financing for those activities should be allocated in the project budget.\n\n20. \nFacilities  and  discipline  in  the  maintenance  of  engines  also  require  monitoring  and\nfinancing  during  the  construction  stage.  Temporary  arrangements  such  as  engine  stations,\nmaterial stores, transportation routes, dumping sites, supply of water to users whose connection\nhas  been  temporarily  cut,  and  the  farmers\u2019  traffic,  will  be  addressed  in  the  contracts,  and\nmonitored by monthly reports.\n\n4. \n\nEnvironmental Issues Arising from Project Operation\n\n21. \nThe  main  environmental  problem  associated  with  operation  of  the  rehabilitated\ninfrastructure  will  be  the  need  for  proper  maintenance  and  generally  minimizing  the  risk  of\n\n\f37\n\nAppendix 8, page 5\n\nsimilar  damage.  The  mitigating  strategy  will  concentrate  on  improving  maintenance  through\ntraining  and  awareness  of  engineering  staff,  improved  management  of  operation  and\nmaintenance  (O&M)  activities  and  a  medium-term  program  to  increase  the  level  of  funding  to\nO&M  from  a  combination  of  budgetary  support  and  beneficiary  contributions.  The  associated\nadvisory TA is designed to address these institutional and financing issues.\n\n22. \nThe  negative  environmental  impacts  arising  from  operation  of  the  Project  could  result\nfrom  further  erosion,  which  may  continue  for  several  months  after  the  works  have  been\ncompleted. The water will contain considerable amounts of eroded materials, which may cause\nsiltation  of  the  structures,  corrosion,  and  limitations  to  the  potable  usability  of  water.  The\noccurrence  of  harmful  chemical  or  biological  constituents  is  addressed  in  the  Institutional\nRequirement and Environmental Monitoring Program (para. 24).\n\n23. \nDuring  operation,  the  significant  benefits  will  cover  environmental  issues.  The  living\nconditions of the beneficiaries will be improved, health conditions will be enhanced, and poverty\nwill  be  reduced  indirectly.  In  this  context,  comparison  of  the  environmental  costs  and  benefits\nhas not been possible, but negative impacts during operation appear insignificant.\n\nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program\n\n24.  MWRLR,  the  Executing  Agency  of  the  Project,  has  limited  environmental  expertise\namong its own staff. The practice is that the Ministry of Environment Protection (MEP) assigns\nan environment specialist to assist the executing agency during the design and implementation\nof  relevant  projects.  The  project  may,  in  addition  to  the  services  of  a  full-time  domestic\nenvironment  specialist  during  the  design  and  implementation,  need  the  assistance  of  an\ninternational expert for two weeks as a component of a supporting TA.\n\n25. \nAn important requirement is use of a participatory approach, including consultation with\nthe beneficiaries and affected people, and free access to environmental information. A practical\nway  is  to  organize  seminars  in  the  villages  to  discuss  the  environmental  and  social  issues\nrelevant to the project. Interested nongovernment organizations and other organizations may be\nassociated  in  this  regard.  The  participatory  approach  has  been  incorporated  into  the\nGovernment\u2019s assurances.\n\n26. \nThe  environmental  monitoring  program  will  include  (i)  weekly  monitoring  of  the\ngroundwater  level  and  salinity  at  10-20  representative  monitoring  stations;  (ii)  analyses  for\nmetals such as arsene, iron, manganese, cadmium, copper, zinc, chromium, and mercury from\ngroundwater  samples  taken  from  different  depths;  (iii)  monthly  analyses  of  stream  flow,\ntemperature,  acidity/alkalinity,  pH,  chemical  oxygen  demand,  salinity,  and  suspended  solids\nfrom two stations in the new canal after the construction; (iv) microbiological quality twice a year\nof  canal  water  in  the  3-5  places  where  the  water  is  used  for  drinking  purposes;  and  (v)\nmonitoring of the construction works with monthly reports and occasional inspections.\n\nF. \n\nFindings and Recommendations\n\n27. \nConsidering  the  urgency  of  processing  the  emergency  loan  project,  it  is  recommended\nthat this report would suffice as both the initial environmental examination and summary report.\nThe findings indicate that the negative environmental impacts of the Project can be mitigated to\nan  acceptable  level.  Hence,  it  is  recommended  that  the  Project  would  be  classified  as\nenvironmental category B, which does not necessarily require a full-scale environmental impact\nassessment.\n\n\f38\n\nAppendix 8, page 6\n\nAn  associated  TA  is  recommended  to  assist  the  Government  in  addressing  the\n28. \nenvironmental  mitigation  and  monitoring  recommendations  as  above,  and  supervise  the\ninstitutional capacity building.\n\nIt  is  recommended  that  the  designs  (i)  make  maximum  use  of  contouring;  (ii)  minimize\n29. \nthe  creation  of  steep  slopes;  (iii)  provide  adequate  slope  protection  using  bioengineering\nsolutions;  and  (iv)  select  disposal  areas  for  borrowed  spoils  that  will  preserve  valuable  land,\nwetlands, and biodiversity.\n\nDuring construction, care will be taken to avoid dust creation, and the contamination of\n\n30. \nwater supplies, which may adversely affect local communities and livestock.\n\nConstruction stockpiles and site facilities are recommended to use existing buildings as\n31. \nfar as possible. If not, they should be located on wasteland to avoid the destruction of trees and\nvegetation,  and  to  minimize  hazards  to  the  local  population  who  should  be  consulted  on  their\nlocation.\n\nThe possible occurrence of significant biodiversity sanctuaries or cultural heritage sites\n\n32. \nshould be monitored during design and implementation of the Project.\n\nG. \n\nConclusions\n\n33. \nAs the adverse environmental consequences resulting from the Project can be mitigated\nto  an  acceptable  level,  and  the  other  technical  alternatives  to  address  the  objectives  are\napparently  not  feasible,  this  report  is  recommended  to  be  sufficient.  Further  environmental\nimpact assessment is not required.\n\n34. \nA  program  should  be  established  under  the  Project  to  address  environmental\nawareness, mitigation, monitoring, and financing issues in a manner suitable for an emergency\nproject.\n\n\f39\n\nAppendix 9, page 1\n\nSUMMARY INITIAL SOCIAL ASSESSMENT\n\n1. \nTajikistan\u2019s  economy  recovered  significantly  during  1997-2000  with  a  cumulative  gross\ndomestic product increase of more than 20 percent. Notwithstanding this, Tajikistan remains a\npoor country, with 1999 per capita gross national income of $280.1 The civil war and economic\ncontraction  have  caused  a  drastic  deterioration  in  living  conditions.  The  Tajikistan  living\nstandards  survey  undertaken  in  1999  shows  that  83  percent  of  the  population  lives  below  the\npoverty  line.2  The  isolated  Gorno-Badakhshan  Autonomous  Region  is  the  poorest  in  the\ncountry,  with  94.7  percent  of  its  population  living  below  the    poverty  line,  followed  by  Khatlon\nRegion  (93.3  percent),  Leninabad  Region  (88.1  percent), \nthe  Region  of  Republican\nSubordination  (81.5  percent),  and  Dushanbe  (67.7  percent).  With  the  high  human  cost  of\neconomic transition, which was exacerbated by the civil war3 and natural disasters, Tajikistan\u2019s\nhuman development index,4 declined from 0.620 in 1992 to 0.528 in 1997. Despite continuous\ndifficulties, the country\u2019s human development index increased to 0.601 in 1999.5 Unemployment\nis believed to have increased to approximately 30 percent in 1999.6 Jobs are increasing in the\nemerging  private  sector  but  labor  markets  remain  weak  due  to  the  narrow  base  of  economic\ngrowth.\n\n2. \nPublic  expenditure  on  social  sectors  (health,  education,  and  social  protection)  as  a\npercentage  of  gross  domestic  product  fell  from  19.8  percent  in  1992  to  4.2  percent  in  1998\nunder severe budget constraints after independence. In 2000, the Government placed poverty\nreduction  at  the  center  of  its  growth  strategy,  and  committed  to  increasing  and  maintaining  a\nbudget allocation of 42 percent for overall social sector expenditures starting from 2001, up from\n19.5 percent in 1999, and 39 percent in 2000. With this increase, public expenditure on social\nsectors  as  a  percentage  of  gross  domestic  product  will  be  over  5.9  percent.  Social  sector\nmanagement and the social services delivery system must be improved to ensure that the gains\nfrom economic growth address social needs.\n\n3. \nMajor  education  indicators  show  that  people\u2019s  access  to  basic  education  has  declined\nsince  independence.  Many  poor  families  are  unable  to  purchase  textbooks,  adequate  clothes,\nand  other  belongings,  and  to  cover  transport  expenditures.  In  contrast,  enrollment  in  higher\neducation  has  remained  remarkably  constant.  However,  due  to  the  lack  of  job  opportunities,\nyoung  people  often  have  to  engage  in  activities  other  than  those  for  which  they  were  trained,\nand  some  of  them  leave  the  country.  In  the  face  of  deteriorating  education  services  and  to\naddress  the  issues  in  the  new  economic  environment,  the  Government  allowed  the  private\nsector to get involved in education in 1994. Also, steps were taken to reform the curricula and\n\n                                                          \n1 Data  based  on  the  World  Bank\u2019s  atlas  method.  By  comparison,  1999  per  capita  gross  national  income  in\nneighboring  countries  were  the  following:  Azerbaijan,  $460;  Kazakhstan,  $1,250;  Kyrgyz  Republic,  $300;\nTurkmenistan, $670; and Uzbekistan, $720.\n\n2 The World Bank. 2000. Republic of Tajikistan, Poverty Assessment. Dushanbe.\n3 The civil war of 1992\u20131997 claimed 60,000 lives and created 700,000 refugees and 55,000 orphans.\n4 The  UNDP\u2019s  human  development  index  summarizes  the  socioeconomic  status  of  a  country  on  the  basis  of  per\n\ncapita income and major education and health indicators.\n\n5 United  Nations  Development  Programme.  2000.  Tajikistan  Human  Development  Report  2000.  Dushanbe.\nTajikistan\u2019s ranking in the human development index fell from 97 in 1992 to 115 in 1997 and improved to 110 in\n1999 among 174 countries.\n\n6 The  official  unemployment  rate  (3.1  percent  in  1999)  grossly  underestimates  actual  unemployment  for  several\nreasons.  The  official  figure  does  not  include  substantial  unemployment  and  underemployment  in  inactive  state-\nowned enterprises, and many of the unemployed do not register because of the low unemployment benefits. Actual\nunemployment in Tajikistan was estimated to be much higher at about 30 percent according to the World Bank\u2019s\npoverty assessment of April 2000. The International Labour Organization estimated unemployment at 16 percent\n(1999).\n\n\f40\n\nAppendix 9, page 2\n\ntextbooks,  and  new  education  standards  were  introduced  in  1996.  In  addition,  fees  and  user\ncharges  were  introduced  in  schools  and  universities.  Textbooks  are  no  longer  provided  free,\nalthough the current charge is only a fraction of the actual cost.\n\nThe health care system also experienced a crisis after 1991. The network of basic health\n4. \ncare provision broke down, people\u2019s access to basic health care became limited, and the quality\nof  health  services  deteriorated.  The  war  and  natural  disasters  destroyed  a  large  number  of\nhealth facilities. The Government made an initial response to the difficult situation in health. The\nHealth  Law  passed  in  1997  allows  private  medical  centers  to  be  established  and  permits\ndoctors working in public hospitals to engage in private practice located on private property. The\nGovernment also took measures to reduce operational costs by cutting the number of hospital\nbeds  from  55,000  in  1992  to  44,000  in  1997,  and  by  introducing  charges  for  certain  health\nservices. To further improve health care, the Government adopted the national strategy Health\nFor All Up To 2005, and implementation of the strategy The National Program of Health Care\nReform in Tajikistan was adopted in 1998.\n\nLike other Central Asian republics, Tajikistan\u2019s legal and administrative systems protect\n5. \nwomen  from  discrimination.  However,  the  drastically  changed  social  situation  in  transition  has\nmade  it  more  difficult  for  women  to  balance  their  public  and  private  roles.  The  transition  has\nseverely  affected  industries  that  employed  a  high  proportion  of  women  (e.g.,  textiles,\nmanufacturing,  and  agriculture),  causing  them  to  disproportionately  lose  their  jobs.  Other\nsectors,  in  which  women  predominate,  such  as  education  and  health  care,  have  experienced\nhigh wage arrears. Also, women have suffered most from the decline of social service delivery,\nincluding the discontinuation of many of the state benefits that supported women, such as child\nallowances  and  child  care.  In  addition,  the  civil  war  created  26,000  widows,  resulting  in  a\nsignificant increase in households headed by women, while men made up the vast majority of\ndeaths resulting from the war.\n\nImproving governance is key to keeping the postconflict society on the road to recovery\n6. \nand development by addressing poverty reduction and structural reform to promote transition to\na market economy. The fight against economic crime, including corruption and drug smuggling\nthrough  the  Afghan  border,  has  become  a  major  challenge  for  the  Government  since  the\ninternal conflict ended. Presidential decrees to tackle corruption and drug trafficking were issued\nin May 2000. Promotion and dissemination of laws and regulations are necessary.\n\n7. \nAgriculture remains a key sector of Tajikistan\u2019s economy, contributing 20-27 percent of\ngross  domestic  product,  one  third  of  export  earnings,  and  accounting  for  60  percent  of\nemployment.  Tajikistan\u2019s  transition  has  been  accompanied  by  a  significant  shift  in  labor  from\nindustry to agriculture. More than half of Tajikistan\u2019s industrial workers have become redundant\nsince  1990,  and  the  agricultural  workforce  has  simultaneously  increased  by  30  percent.\nAccordingly, agriculture and agroprocessing are now expected to play a major role in economic\nrecovery  and  poverty  reduction  in  Tajikistan  given  the  evident  comparative  advantages  and\nscope for productivity improvements. Exploitation of these opportunities requires elimination of\nwidespread distortions and disincentives that prevailed under central planning.\n\n8. \nLand reform is essential to develop the agriculture sector as arable land is scarce, only\n0.14  hectares  per  capita.  The  civil  war  delayed  Tajikistan\u2019s  economic  reforms.  However,\nstructural reforms have progressed substantially since 1997, and the Government has boosted\nland reform since mid-1998. Structural reforms were accelerated in 2000, with progress made in\nsmall-scale  enterprise  privatization,  tax  administration  reform,  development  of  the  treasury\nsystem,  and  strengthening  of  the  auditing  system.  In  the  agriculture  sector,  half  of  the  arable\n\n\f41\n\nAppendix 9, page 3\n\nland  is  now  privatized.  More  state-owned  farms  should  be  privatized  and  newly  privatized\nfarmers supported. As a part of financial sector reforms, nonbank financial institutions must be\ndeveloped  to  expand  the  outreach  of  financial  intermediation,  including  to  rural  areas,  where\nabout 73 percent of the population lives.\n\n9. \n Khatlon oblast (region), where the damaged water conveyance system is located, was\nseriously affected by the civil war, and is the second poorest region of the country. In the project\narea, the incidence of poverty is estimated at 90 percent.\n\nThe  water  conveyance  system  to  be  restored  runs  through  three  rayons  (districts):\n10. \nGozimalik, Khodzhamaston, and Yavan. The majority of the population below the broken siphon\nreside  in  Gozimalik.7  In  2000,  about  70,700  people  lived  in  this  rural  district.  About  35,000\ncompletely  lost  their  source  of  water  after  the  catastrophe  at  the  siphon.  Women  outnumber\nmen  slightly,  constituting  51  percent  of  the  population.  The  population  is  young,  with  52.9\npercent under 20 years of age, and 29.8 percent between 20 and 40. The crude rate of natural\nincrease is 12.6 per 1,000 due to a crude birth rate of 16.4 per 1,000 and crude mortality rate of\n3.8  per  1,000.  About  1,531  calories  per  day  were  available  to  people  in  this  area  in  1991\ncompared  with  the  required  2,400  calories  per  day.  Observers  have  remarked  that  stunting,\nreflecting chronic childhood malnutrition, is most pronounced in such cotton-growing regions of\nthe country.\n\nLandholding in Gozimalik is dominated by five kolkhoz or collective statefarms; there are\n11. \nonly 200 dekhan or private farms in the district. According to one informant, farmers may apply\nfor a private farm after paying off their debts to the kolkhoz. This strongly favors large families\nwith  many  young  male  laborers  and  disadvantages  smaller  families  and  the  200  or  so\nhouseholds headed by women, including those widowed in the civil war. In 1999, about 10,900\nhectares of crops were planted; half, or about 5,400 hectares, was in cotton, and 2,900 hectares\nin grain. In 1999, about 4,343 tons of cotton and 2,175 tons of grain were produced and 2,622\nhead of cattle and 4,953 head of sheep (and goats) produced 349 tons of milk and 173 tons of\nmeat.\n\nGozimalik has 56 schools with 1,100 teachers and 16,800 pupils, including 7,200 girls.\n\n12. \nThere are 59 doctors and 325 nurses.\n\n13. \nReform of landholding and local governance of irrigation and domestic water systems is\ncrucial for the agriculture sector and socioeconomic development in general. Creation of water\nusers  associations  through  bottom-up,  participatory  processes  would  bring  farmers  and\ndomestic  water  users  together  to  plan,  manage,  and  monitor  local  water  supplies  and  the\nfinancing required to maintain these. Federations of water users associations at the secondary\nchannel  level  would  contribute  to  empowering  citizens  and  communities  in  which  they  reside.\nLinkages  with  other  programs,  such  as  school  committees  and  credit  for  microenterprises,\nwould  reinforce  local  capacities  and  enhance  social  capital.  The  organization  and  training  of\nwater users associations is included in an ongoing World Bank-financed project.8\n\n                                                          \n7  Data  were  provided  for  Gozimalik  by  officials  \u201cbased  on  Government  statistics  and  the  World  Bank  Poverty\nAssessment.\u201d  The source of the data is not specified. The statistics pertain only to Gozimalik. A small number of\nconversations  were  held  in  the  district  with  assistance  from  a  translator,  and  with  nongovernment  organization\nstaff  members  and  citizens  from  rural  areas  who  now  live  in  Dushanbe.  Further  research  would  be  required  to\nobtain higher quality data.\n\n8  World  Bank  Loan  33870-TAJ: Rural Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project,  for  $20.0  million,  approved  on  6  July\n\n2000.\n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 9, page 4\n\nFor the restoration of the Yavan water conveyance system to lead to sustainable results,\n14. \ninstitutional  and  technical  issues  must  be  addressed  simultaneously.  At  a  minimum,  an\nextensive  and  comprehensive  information  campaign  is  essential  to  inform  men,  women,  and\nschool  children,  of  the  structure  and  function  of  the  entire  system,  the  necessary  annual\nmaintenance, the reconstruction works being undertaken now, and the real costs of these. Such\na campaign is included in the scope of the associated TA.\n\n\f43\n\nAppendix 10, page 1\n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR\nSUPPORT FOR FACILITATING SUSTAINABLE PROJECT BENEFITS\n\nA. \n\nObjectives\n\n1. \nThe  objectives  of  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  are  to  (i)  review  practices  and  help\nestablish procedures for proper operation and maintenance (O&M) of the project facilities, and\n(ii)  build  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Land  Reclamation  (MWRLR)  in\nconstruction management and supervision. By establishing procedures, determining inputs, and\ninstituting monitoring mechanisms with strong beneficiary participation for proper O&M, the TA\nwill  ensure  sustainability  of  project  benefits.  Also,  through  hands-on  training,  the  TA  will\nintroduce to MWRLR staff efficient practices in construction management and supervision that\nwill considerably improve the capacity of the staff for cost-effectiveness and quality construction.\n\nB. \n\nConsultants\n\nThe TA will require the services of 4 person-months of international consulting services:\n2. \nan  O&M  specialist-environmental  specialist    (2),  and  construction  management  specialist  (2);\nand  15  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services:  O&M  specialist  (5),  social  analyst  (5),\nand construction management specialist (5).\n\nC. \n\nTerms of Reference\n\nWorking  closely  with  the  staff  of  MWRLR,  local  administration,  and  the  project\n\n3. \ncommunities, the consultants will carry out the following tasks:\n\n1. \n\nEstablish O&M Procedures and Estimate Associated Costs\n\n4. \n\nThe consultants will:\n\nstudy the Pravaya Vetka main canal system and establish procedures for proper\nO&M;\n\nrun an information campaign to inform men, women, and school children of the\nstructure  and  function  of  the  entire  system,  the  necessary  annual  maintenance,\nand the reconstruction works being undertaken;\n\ndetermine  the  organizational  setup  and  equipment  required,  and  estimate  the\nassociated investment and recurring costs; and\n\nprepare  guidelines  for  the  system  operators  including  the  procedures  to  be\nfollowed in case of emergencies.\n\n2. \n\nPropose Mechanism for Recovering O&M Costs\n\n5. \n\nActivities include:\n\nprepare a profile of the project water uses and the users;\n\nrecommend  ways  and  means  to  minimize  water  wastage  and  use  the  water  in\nthe most efficient and cost-effective manner; and\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n\f(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n44\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\n(iii) \n\nrecommend how the O&M costs could be best recovered from the beneficiaries\ngiving  due  consideration  to  the  use  of  water  and  the  payment  capacity  of  the\nusers.\n\n3. \n\nRecommend Implementation and Monitoring Mechanisms for O&M\n\n6. \n\nActivities include:\n\nidentify performance indicators for O&M activities; and\n\nrecommend  mechanisms  to  monitor  O&M  activities  with  particular  emphasis  on\ninvolvement of the project communities;\n\n4. \n\nCapacity Building in Construction Management and Supervision\n\n7. \n\nThe consultants will:\n\nprepare  in  Russian,  for  the  project  management  office  staff  and  the  local\nconsultants, guidelines including related forms on construction management and\nsupervision;\n\nusing  the  ongoing  construction  activities  as  an  example,  provide  hands-on\ntraining to the project staff on efficient construction management and supervision;\n\nexplain  the  common  difficulties  and  problems  encountered  and  how  to  address\nthem; and\n\ndemonstrate  how  to  take  samples,  get  them  tested  at  the  laboratory,  and\ninterpret the results.\n\nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\nThe  TA  will  be  implemented  by  the  project  management  office  under  MWRLR.  The\n8. \nconsultants  will  be  recruited  by  the  Government  through  a  consulting  firm  in  accordance  with\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of domestic consultants.\n\nE. \n\nImplementation Schedule, Reports, and Documents\n\n9. \nThe  TA  will  be  implemented  over  six  months.  The  schedule  for  TA  implementation  will\nbe matched with the period of peak project construction activities, particularly when a variety of\nconstruction activities are scheduled. The input of the international consultants will be limited to\none month at a time with domestic consultants undertaking the same activities during the gap.\nAs stated in the terms of reference, the consultants will prepare instructions and guidelines for\nthe  project  staff.  In  addition,  the  consultants  will  be  required  to  prepare  a  brief  report  on  their\ninput making recommendations for any follow-up activities.\n\nF. \n\nEstimated Costs\n\n10. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $170,000  equivalent,  comprising  foreign\nexchange  costs  of  $116,000  and  local  currency  costs  of  $54,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  finance\n$135,000 equivalent, to cover all the foreign exchange costs and $19,000 equivalent of the local\n\n\f45\n\nAppendix 10, page 3\n\ncurrency  costs.  The  funding  will  be  on  a  grant  basis  from  ADB-funded  TA  program.  The\nGovernment will finance $35,000 equivalent of the local currency costs.
