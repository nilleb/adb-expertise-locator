The system was damaged in May 2001 by\nan  earthquake  that  disrupted  water  supplies  to  56,000\npeople and 65,000 livestock. In addition,  irrigation water\nsupplies to 11,724 hectares of arable land were disrupted.\nAbout 90 percent of the people served by the system live\nbelow the poverty line. The system was completed in 1968,\nand    consists  of  a  tunnel,  an  open  canal  of  about  28\nkilometers  (km),  and  three  inverted  siphons  with  a  total\nlength  of  about  3  km  that  convey  water  through  three\nvalleys. The earthquake damaged one siphon, disrupting the\nwater  supply.  The  Government  agencies  took  immediate\naction  and  within  a  month  had  laid  temporary  pipelines\npartly restoring water supply. The Project will restore water\nsupply  by  installing  permanent  replacement  works,  and\nrehabilitate facilities that pose a threat, thus safeguarding\nagainst failure risks. The project works include construction\nof bypass canals for two siphons, replacement of the third\nfor  which  topography  does  not  allow  construction  of  a\nbypass canal, and some works on the main canal and tunnel\nthat are necessary for safe operation of the system.\nClassification Core poverty intervention\nHuman development\nEnvironmental Assessment Category  B.  An  initial  environmental  examination  was\nundertaken,  a  summary  of  which  is  attached  as  an\nappendix.\nRationale The  earthquake  and  consequent  flooding  of  May  2001\ncaused  significant  damage  to  public  and  private\ninfrastructure  and  disrupted  potable  and  irrigation  water\nsupplies  to  predominantly  poor  communities.  Although\nsupplies were partly restored through temporary works with\nborrowed resources, permanent works are urgently needed\nto fully restore this basic service to the affected communities\nand safeguard against the recurrence of such a disaster in\nthe project area. An emergency assistance to minimize the\nsocial and economic impacts of the disaster is warranted by\nthe  Government\u2019s  budgetary  constraints,  which  are\nexpected to continue over the medium term. The Project will\nrehabilitate the water supply infrastructure and safeguard\nagainst recurrence of future disruptions, and thus ensure", "ii\nmaintenance  of  quality  of  life  by  sustaining  critical  water\nsupply. In line with Asian Development Bank (ADB) policy\non rehabilitation assistance after disasters, the Project will\nenable Tajikistan to continue with development expenditures\nthat  otherwise  would  have  been  foregone  for  disaster\nrehabilitation.\nObjectives and Scope The Project\u2019s immediate objective is to fully restore irrigation\nand household water supply in the project area. The long-\nterm  objective  is  to  ensure  access  of  the  affected  rural\ncommunities to water supplies on a sustainable basis. The\nProject  comprises  two  components:  (i)  physical\ninfrastructure, and (ii) project implementation support. The\nphysical  infrastructure  component  includes  (i)  temporary\nrestoration of Loikasai siphon, (ii) construction of Loikasai\nbypass canal, (iii) remodeling of Ishmasai bypass canal, (iv)\nreplacement  of    pipes  of    Shurchasai  siphon,  and  (v)\nrehabilitation  of  Pravaya  Vetka  main  canal  and  Vakhsh-\nYavan  tunnel.  The  project  implementation  support\ncomponent  will  provide  inputs  for  surveys,  investigations,\ndesign,  environmental  monitoring,  and  social  impact\nassessment.\nCost Estimates The Project is estimated to cost $4.50 million equivalent, of\nwhich $2.76 million (61 percent) is the foreign exchange\ncost  and  $1.74  million  equivalent  (39  percent)  the  local\ncurrency cost. The cost estimates include physical and price\ncontingencies, and $0.40 million for taxes and duties.\nFinancing Plan ($ million)\nForeign Local\nSource Exchange Currency Total   Percent\nAsian Development Bank 2.76 0.84        3.60 80\nGovernment 0.00 0.90        0.90 20\nTotal 2.76 1.74 4.50 100\nLoan Amount and Terms The loan of Special Drawing Rights 2,795,000 ($3.60 million\nequivalent) will be provided from the ADB\u2019s Special Funds\nresources, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period\nof 8 years, and an interest charge of 1 percent per year\nduring the grace period and 1.5 percent thereafter.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 31 October 2003", "iii\nExecuting Agency Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Land  Reclamation\n(MWRLR)\nImplementation MWRLR is responsible for the operation and maintenance\nArrangements (O&M)  of  the  water  conveyance  system  and  has\nimplemented  temporary  rehabilitation  works.  A  project\nmanagement  office  (PMO)  has  been  established  for  (i)\noverall project management, (ii) recruitment and supervision\nof domestic consultants, (iii) supervision of implementation\nand  quality  control  of  project  works,  (iv)  liaison  with\nbeneficiary communities, (v) monitoring and evaluation of\nProject  impacts,  and  (vi)  preparation  of  reports  and\ncommunications with ADB. The PMO will be staffed by local\nexperts supported by domestic consultants.\nA project steering committee (PSC) will be established to\nfacilitate  interagency  coordination,  review  implementation\nprogress, and provide guidance. The PSC will be chaired by\nthe  deputy  prime  minister  in  charge  of  the  ministries  of\ntransport,  trade,  construction,  energy,  industry,  and\nemergency  situations;  and  comprise  representatives  from\nMWRLR;  the  ministries  of  agriculture,  finance,  and\nenvironment protection; and the Center for Liquidation of\nConsequences  of  Natural  Disasters.  The  PSC  will  meet\nquarterly and as often as required.\nProcurement The Project will finance civil works, materials, machinery,\nand  equipment.  All  procurement  will  be  undertaken  in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  Civil\nworks contracts costing more than $800,000 equivalent will\nbe awarded based on international shopping procedures.\nThe temporary works were completed using force account\nworks,  while  construction  of  Loikasai  bypass  canal  is\nongoing, also using force account works. The remaining civil\nworks packages are small, amounting to less than $800,000\nequivalent. Considering that the project site is located in a\nremote area with security risks, the Project is unlikely to\nattract international contractors. Therefore, local competitive\nbidding  will  be  used  for  civil  works  packages  under\n$800,000 equivalent.\nConsulting Services A  total  of  116  person-months  of  domestic  consulting\nservices  will  be  required  to  assist  with  project\nimplementation.  Qualified  and  experienced  domestic\nconsultants  are  available  for  these  engineering  and\nconstruction  works,  and  will  be  responsible  for  surveys,\ninvestigations,  detailed  design,  preparation  of  tender\ndocuments,  construction  supervision,  quality  control,", "iv\nenvironmental monitoring and evaluation, and social impact\nassessment. Field engineers will be responsible for day-to-\nday supervision of the contractors. The consultants will be\nselected  and  engaged  through  a  consulting  firm  in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of\nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for\nthe selection and engagement of domestic consultants.\nEstimated Project 30 April 2003\nCompletion Date\nProject Benefits and The  Project  will  restore  disrupted  potable  and  irrigation\nBeneficiaries water supply to the predominantly poor communities in the\nshortest possible time, based on a least-cost solution. The\nproject  measures  will  also  safeguard  the  system  against\nrecurring  future  breakdown.  Therefore,  the  projected\nbenefits will include (i) improved living conditions, (ii) ready\naccess  to  potable  and  irrigation  water  supplies  on  a\nsustainable basis, and (iii) avoidance of permanent losses of\ncrop and livestock outputs of predominantly poor farmers\ncaused by insufficient water supply.\nTechnical Assistance A technical assistance (TA) grant of $135,000 equivalent\nfrom  ADB-funded TA program will provide services of 4\nperson-months  of  international  and  15  person-months  of\ndomestic consulting input to determine practices and help\nestablish proper O&M procedures for the project facilities,\nand build MWRLR capacity for construction management\nand supervision.

THE PROPOSAL\n1.  I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Republic of Tajikistan for the Emergency Restoration of Yavan Water Conveyance\nSystem Project. The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for support for\nfacilitating sustainable project benefits, and if the proposed loan is approved by the Board, I,\nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, shall approve the TA.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2.  On 7 May 2001, Tajikistan experienced an earthquake with an intensity of 4 on the\nRichter  scale;  the  most  immediate  effect  on  the  human  population  was  felt  in  Gozimalik,\nKhodzhamaston, and Yavan rayons (districts) of Khatlon Region. The earthquake ruptured the\nwater conveyance system cutting off water supplies to a population of approximately 56,000 and\n65,000 livestock. About 11,724 hectares (ha) of arable land were left without irrigation water.\nAbout 90 percent of the affected people are living below the poverty line.\n3.  Government agencies took immediate steps to address the situation and alleviate the\nplight of the affected population. Household water supplies were met by water tankers. A\nworkforce of 250 persons and a huge machinery pool undertook construction of a temporary\npipeline, and thus restored water supply to affected households and livestock. Given the time\nand resources available to the Government, the contingency restoration of household supplies\nhas met their immediate objective. However, the system remains precarious and permanent\nworks are needed to restore the system to its full capacity and to address the risk of failure in\nother parts of the system, which are all more than 30 years old and have been destabilized or\nweakened by earthquake activity but which continue to be in use.\n4.  The President of Tajikistan in a letter dated 23 May 2001 asked the Asian Development\nBank (ADB) to provide emergency assistance to restore the water conveyance system. The\nAppraisal Mission1 visited Tajikistan from 15 to 30 July 2001 and visited the affected areas. The\nMission held discussions with a wide range of national and local agencies, and the affected\ncommunities. This report is based on the Mission\u2019s findings and agreements reached with the\nGovernment. The project framework is in Appendix 1.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA. Geographic Features\n5.  Tajikistan is the most southerly of the former Soviet Union Central Asian republics, which\nbecame independent in 1991. It is bordered to the north by the Kyrgyz Republic, in the east by\nthe Peoples Republic of China, Afghanistan to the south, and Uzbekistan to the west. The total\narea of 143,100 square kilometer (km) is divided into four regions, namely Sughd in the north,\nRegion  of  Republican  Subordination  in  the  center,  Khatlon  in  the  south,  and  the  mainly\nmountainous Gorno-Badakshan in the east.\n6.  The climate is continental although the relatively southerly latitude has an ameliorating\nimpact and altitude is a significant local factor. The lowland agricultural areas have an average\nsummer temperature of about 26\u00baC and a winter average of 6\u00baC, and have a long growing\n                  \n1  The Mission comprised A. Malik, Senior Project Specialist/Mission Leader; K. Motomura, Programs Officer; T.\nBayarsaihan, Project Economist; A. Sweetser, Social Development Specialist; J. Wartiovaara, Environmental\nSpecialist; R. Shaw, Economist, Staff Consultant; and M. Ali, Design Engineer, Staff Consultant.", "2\nseason by central Asian standards of over 220 days. Rainfall averages 150 to 250 millimeter\n(mm) per year, most of which falls in the winter months. As a consequence, agriculture is highly\ndependent on irrigation. At higher altitudes, temperatures decline, the growing season shortens,\nand snow cover is common for much of the winter.\n7.  The  population  is  about  6.1  million,  two  thirds  of  whom  are  ethnic  Tajiks.  Other\nsignificant  ethnic  groups  include  Kyrgyz,  Russians,  and  Uzbeks.  Population  distribution  is\nuneven; about 0.5 million people live in the capital Dushanbe and the total urban population is\n1.8 million. The rural population is concentrated in the Sughd and Khatlon regions, which\naccount for about 4 million people, most of whom are dispersed in over 3,000 communities of\nless than 1,000 persons each.\n8.  Tajikistan is a mountainous country; only 960,000 ha are designated as cultivable land.\nA further 3.6 million ha or 7 percent of the total area is classified as permanent pasture. Thus\nthe amount of arable land per rural household is very modest at about 0.9 ha, plus about 3.5 ha\nof pasture. These include significant areas of often steeply sloping land, which is at risk and\noften results in evident soil erosion. A more sustainable pattern of land use would be consistent\nwith a lower cultivated area.\n9.  The country has over 600 water supply systems, which originally provided 60 percent of\nthe population with piped water mainly from groundwater sources. As a result of damage\ncaused and lack of maintenance during the civil conflict, this figure has fallen substantially. Most\nrural potable water systems have deteriorated, thus depriving many rural communities of access\nto safe drinking water. Many households now depend on surface water, usually rivers or canals,\nwhere water quality is low. Outside district centers, the proportion of households with access to\npiped water is less than 20 percent. Even where a pipe network exists, the source of water is\nusually surface water, such as a river, with no guarantee that the water has been treated. Many\nsystems are in a state of disrepair, forcing households to collect water from as far away as 5\nkm.  The  increased  dependence  on  surface  water  sources  has  resulted  in  a  much  higher\nincidence of waterborne diseases in rural areas.\nB. Recent Economic Developments\n10.  Tajikistan had an estimated per capita gross national product of $290 in 2000.2 At\nindependence, Tajikistan was the poorest republic of the former Soviet Union. The transition\nprocess proved to be difficult as the country faced many challenges. First, Tajikistan lost the\nmost from the termination of transfers from Moscow, estimated at 40 percent of gross domestic\nproduct (GDP). Second, independence was accompanied by the outbreak of civil conflict in\n1992, which continued at varying degrees of intensity until 1997. The conflict made reforms\nextremely  difficult  and  effectively  delayed  implementation  of  any  significant  economic\nrestructuring before 1997. Third, Tajikistan has suffered a number of natural disasters, including\nearthquakes, floods, and avalanches, that have disrupted economic activities and destroyed\ninfrastructure. As a consequence, GDP fell by an estimated 60 percent between 1991 and 1997.\nThe signing of a peace agreement in June 1997 ended the civil conflict and allowed the reform\nprogram to be pursued more vigorously. As a result, GDP began to grow. Between 1997 and\n2000, GDP grew by about a cumulative 20 percent. Nevertheless, the country still faces a huge\ntask of reconstruction, requiring large investments, which the Government has found difficult to\nmobilize. Tajikistan\u2019s external position is also weak as a result of its dependence on cotton and\naluminum, whose prices are prone to considerable variation.\n                  \n2  World Bank 2001. Country Economic Memorandum. Tajikistan. Dushanbe.", "3\n11.  The contraction of the economy has severely constrained the Government\u2019s ability to\nprovide (i) basic social services and (ii) operation and maintenance (O&M) of physical and\nsocial infrastructure. The Government is devoting 42 percent of its budget to the provision of\nsocial services, but with a national poverty level of 83 percent the impact is modest. The\nproposed Project will enable the Government to finance much needed social services as well as\nO&M of critical infrastructure.\nC. Description of the Yavan Water Conveyance System\n12.  The Yavan water conveyance system was completed in 1968. The system originates\nfrom Baipazin Reservoir on Vakhsh River, about 65 km southeast of Dushanbe and serves\nGozimalik, Khodzhamaston, and Yavan districts. About 90 percent of the people served by the\nsystem live below the poverty line. The water supply is taken from the river through a 7.3 km\ntunnel whose outlet is in the neighboring valley adjacent to the town of Yavan. The water\npasses from the tunnel via an open canal to a headworks with three outlets .The right side outlet\nfeeds the Pravaya Vetka main canal, which has a design capacity of 50 cubic meters per\nsecond (m3/sec) and irrigates about 26,800 ha. After the initial reach of 27.6 km where the\nsystem serves 15,526 ha, the canal capacity is reduced to 20 m3/sec, and inverted siphons are\nused to traverse three valleys followed by a tunnel before entering Gozimalik district. Because\nof deterioration of various parts of the system over time, the flow in the siphon is generally\nlimited to 17 m3/sec against a design capacity of 20 m3/sec.\n13.  The first siphon, Ishmasai, is 950 meters (m) long, consists of two parallel pipelines each\n1.8 m diameter (dia), and has a total design capacity of 17 m3/sec. To augment the capacity of\nthe siphon and to match it with that of the main canal, a bypass canal of 4 m3/sec was\nconstructed in 1985. Ishmasai siphon discharges into a 4 km long open canal, which drains into\nthe second, 1.1 km long Loikasai siphon. Loikasai siphon consists of three parallel pipelines,\ntwo of 1.8 m dia each and the one of 1.02 m dia, and it discharges into a 3 km long open canal.\nThe third, Shurchasai siphon is 850 m long and consists of two pipelines of 1.8 m dia each. All\npipes are made of steel and originally had a thickness of 10 mm. During more than 30 years of\nuse,  the  pipes  have  been  severely  corroded  by  the  sediment  load  in  the  water;  in  some\nstretches, the thickness has been reduced to an alarming limit. At the bottom, the pipe thickness\nhas been reduced to about 3 mm posing threat of failure of the siphons, which seem to be in\ngood condition.\n14.  Like other water-related facilities in the country, the maintenance of physical facilities\nhas been inadequate because of poor cost recovery from the project beneficiaries and minimum\nGovernment support. Also, Soviet-era construction management and supervision practices are\nstill being followed. Thus, the scope for introducing modern efficient and cost-effective practices\nin these fields is considerable.\nD. The Disaster\n15.  The earthquake of 7 May 2001 caused cracks in both the pipelines and the open canal\nparts of the system. The most severe cracks occurred at the intake structure of the Loikasai\nsiphon. Water poured from these cracks, soaking the soil under the structure. Maintenance staff\nbegan preparations to plug the cracks and close the gates, which regulate the flow of water into\nthe system. During the night of the 7/8 of May, most of the soil under the intake structure, which\nconsisted of alluvial deposits, was washed away and at 1100 hours on 8 May, the structure\ncollapsed. Water gushing from the collapsed structure began to wash away the soil supporting\nthe siphon pipes. Although the gates regulating the flow of water were closed, water continued", "4\nto flow for another 12 hours until the upstream siphon and open canals were completely empty.\nAbout 600 m of the initial reach of the Loikasai siphon and 100 m of open canal above the\nintake were washed away.\n16.  The immediate impact was the disruption of (i) potable water supplies to the community,\nand (ii) irrigation supplies to more than 11,700 ha of cultivated land. For almost four weeks\nabout 56,000 people were dependent on water tankers for their supplies, while cropped areas\nsuffered moisture stress. Water gushing from the collapsed structure destroyed 48 houses in\nthe valley but luckily, caused no casualties. The disruptions to irrigation supplies immediately\nafter the disaster, and supply of about 9 m3/sec against 14 m3/sec at Loikasai siphon after\ncompletion of the temporary works is expected to reduce crop yields by about 40 percent for the\n11,724 ha irrigated area. Higher levels of febrile disease (said to be malaria) than usual have\noccurred during the months following the catastrophe, but no significant loss of time in school or\nother health consequences have been identified.\nE. Government Response\n17.  The Government immediately established an emergency center charged with the task of\nreconstruction to restore potable water supplies. By 2 June 2001, the workforce succeeded in\nlaying a temporary pipeline of 1.4 m dia, carrying about 3.0 m3/sec or some 21 percent of the\noriginal supply of 14 m3/sec. The second pipeline of 2.02 m dia and about 6.0 m3/sec capacity\nwas completed on 18 June 2001. Another pipeline of 1.0 m dia with capacity of 0.5 m3/sec, also\ncompleted in June 2001, supplies water to local areas of Khodzhamaston district. This restored\nwater supplies to households. These temporary works with available materials were aimed at\nrestoring the water supply with minimum disruption and will need to be replaced as soon as\npossible. Unless a permanent solution is implemented, the project area will remain under the\nthreat of another system collapse leading to a disaster.\n18.  The cost of the temporary works is estimated at $478,300. The Government has diverted\nsome funds from other activities while the Design Institute of the Ministry of Water Resources\nand Land Reclamation (MWRLR), and some contractors and suppliers are still to be paid.\n19.  The  Design  Institute  of  MWRLR  prepared  a  design  plan  to  rehabilitate  the  system\nincluding parts that pose a continued threat to local communities. The plan is to construct\nbypass canals for the first two inverted siphons and replace pipes of the third. The existing\nbypass canal of Ishmasai (first) siphon, which carries 4.0 m3/sec will need to be remodeled to\ncarry 20 m3/sec. A detailed survey and design has already been carried out for the second\nbypass canal and preparatory works for its construction are in progress.\nF. Aid Coordination and External Assistance\n20.  Tajikistan has received several emergency loans from various development agencies.\nThe  World  Bank  alone  provided  three  emergency  loans.  The  first,  postconflict  emergency\nreconstruction for $10.0 million, approved in February 19983 has been fully disbursed and was\nclosed in September 2000. Emergency flood assistance for $5.0 million was approved in August\n19984 and supplemented by $2.0 million in December 1999.5 ADB approved the Emergency\n                  \n3  World Bank Loan 30370-TAJ: Postconflict Emergency Reconstruction Project, for $10.0 million, approved on 17\nFebruary 1998.\n4  World Bank Loan 31230-TAJ: Emergency Flood Assistance Project, for $5.0 million, approved on 31 August 1998.\n5  World  Bank  Loan  31231-TAJ: Supplementary Flood Assistance Project,  for  $3.0  million,  approved  on  20\nDecember 1999.", "5\nFlood Rehabilitation Project (EFRP) in December 1999 for $5.0 million.6 Bilateral assistance has\nbeen provided by United States Agency for International Development and Germany through\nGerman Agro Action. The United Nations office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\nplayed a particularly useful role following the July 1999 floods. Good coordination among these\nagencies has been maintained and was followed up during the preparation of the proposed\nProject. Consultation with the World Bank was undertaken to ensure that the activities under\nthis Project do not overlap with the recently approved Rural Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project\n(RIRP) of the World Bank.7\nG. Lessons Learned\n21.  The following lessons learned from a number of emergency projects financed by ADB\nhave been incorporated in the project design: (i) project components should be defined clearly;\n(ii) adequate consulting services should be provided to assist with surveys, investigations,\ndesign, and construction supervision; (iii) advance action and retroactive financing are essential\nto facilitate speedy restoration; (iv) training is critical for executing agencies not familiar with\nADB  procedures;  and  (v)  appropriate  O&M  arrangements  should  be  facilitated  for  the\nrehabilitated infrastructure. TA (para. 59) will be provided to facilitate proper O&M of the project\nfacilities.\n22.  The EFRP, the only ADB-financed emergency assistance project in Tajikistan, is being\nimplemented by the Center for Liquidation of Consequences of Natural Disasters (CLCND),\nwhich  has  performed  creditably.  CLCND  has  agreed  to  provide  guidance  and  support  to\nMWRLR,  the  proposed  EA,  particularly  in  areas  such  as  disbursement  and  procurement\nprocedures. The experience gained by MWRLR during project implementation will strengthen its\ncapacity to implement forthcoming ADB agriculture and water sector projects for which it will act\nas the EA.\nH. ADB\u2019s Country Strategy\n23.  The current country assistance program for Tajikistan is prepared based on the Interim\nOperational Strategy (IOS), which was endorsed by the Board in 1998. The objectives of the\nIOS are to (i) facilitate the country\u2019s transition to a market economy, (ii) assist in the postconflict\nrehabilitation and reconstruction, and (iii) support natural disaster rehabilitation. To maximize\nthe  development  impact  of  ADB\u2019s  assistance,  the  IOS  focuses  on  three  priority  areas:  (i)\nagriculture;  (ii)  infrastructure  rehabilitation,  especially  roads  and  power;  and  (iii)  the  social\nsector. While the current IOS remains broadly appropriate, a full country operational strategy is\nscheduled to be prepared in 2002 based on a poverty partnership agreement, which will be\nconcluded with the Government in 2001.\nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n24.  The earthquake and consequent flooding of May 2001 caused significant damage to\npublic and private infrastructure and disrupted potable and irrigation water supply to 26,800 ha.\nThe incidence attracted immediate Government attention as about 90 percent of the affected\npeople live below the poverty line. Although water supplies have been partly restored through\n                  \n6  Loan 1714(SF)-TAJ: Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Project, for $5.0 million approved on 2 December 1999.\n7  World Bank Loan 33870-TAJ: Rural Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project, for $20.0 million, approved on 6 July\n2000.", "6\ntemporary works with borrowed resources, permanent remedial actions are urgently required to\nfully restore this basic service to affected communities and safeguard against the recurrence of\nsuch disaster in the project area. Unless a permanent solution is implemented urgently, the\nrestored system remains vulnerable and the local communities\u2019 welfare is at risk of possible loss\nof  life,  damage  to  property,  lost  agricultural  production,  and  reduced  family  incomes.  A\npermanent  solution  will  also  safeguard  against  environmental  damage.  An  emergency\nassistance to minimize the social and economic impacts of the disaster is warranted by the\nGovernment\u2019s budgetary constraints, which are expected to continue over the medium term. In\nline with ADB\u2019s policy of assistance after disasters, the proposed emergency loan will enable\nTajikistan to continue with development financing that otherwise would have been diverted for\ndisaster rehabilitation.\n25.  The Project was formulated in close consultation with central and local government\nofficials, the affected communities, nongovernment organizations, and local groups. The project\ndesign ensures a significant role for the concerned regional and district authorities, including\ntheir participation in project implementation.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n26.  The immediate objective of the Project is to fully rehabilitate the household and irrigation\nwater supply system damaged by the earthquake. The long-term objective is to ensure access\nof the affected rural communities to water supplies on a sustainable basis and thereby raise\ntheir living standards. The Project will assist the Government to (i) rehabilitate the water supply\ninfrastructure and safeguard against recurrent damage in the affected areas; and (ii) reduce the\npossibility  that  emergency  expenditures  will  disrupt  the  implementation  of  approved\ndevelopment programs.\n27.  The  Project  comprises  two  components:  (i)  physical  infrastructure,  and  (ii)  project\nimplementation support. The physical infrastructure works to be implemented under the Project\ninclude (i) temporary restoration of Loikasai siphon, (ii) construction of Loikasai bypass canal,\n(iii) remodeling of Ishmasai bypass canal, (iv) replacement of pipes of Shurchasai siphon, and\n(v) rehabilitation of Pravaya Vetka main canal and Vakhsh-Yavan tunnel. Details of the project\ncomponents are as follows.\n1. Physical Infrastructure\n28.  The use of an open channel was found to be the least-cost solution in the cases of\nLoikasai and Ishmasai siphons. However, in the case of Shurchasai siphon, ground conditions\ndo not allow a feasible open channel and, therefore, replacement of pipelines was adopted.\nDetails of the works follow.\na. Temporary Restoration of Loikasai Siphon\n29.  Temporary works were completed under the supervision of MWRLR before end-June\n2001 using force account works (para. 17 and 18). The works will continue to be used until\nLoikasai bypass canal (para. 30) is complete. Later, these works will remain as a standby\nfacility.", "7\nb. Construction of Loikasai Bypass Canal\n30.  The cost-effective, long-term solution for the damaged Loikasai siphon is a 4.1 km long\nopen bypass canal running along the contour. MWRLR has already completed surveys and\ndesign. With a capacity of 20 m3/sec, the canal will be 8 m wide at the bottom and 3 m deep.\nThe associated structures include intake and outfall structures, two bridges, and five cross-\ndrainage works. The Project will provide for procurement of earth-moving equipment, which will\nbe used for O&M after project completion. Six families living along the alignment are being\nresettled. The Government plans to complete its construction and test running by April 2002,\nbefore the start of the next cropping season. As the temporary pipelines are already operational,\nthe  works  on  the  bypass  canal  could  be  conducted  during  both  growing  and  nongrowing\nseasons without interrupting the current level of water supply.\nc. Remodeling of Ishmasai Bypass Canal\n31.  A 4.0 m3/sec 5.1 km long bypass canal for Ishmasai siphon was constructed in 1985 to\naugment the capacity of the siphon and match it with that of the main canal. The bypass canal is\nto be remodeled and its capacity increased to 20 m3/sec so that it can replace Ishmasai siphon.\nThe Project provides for procurement of earth-moving equipment which will be used for O&M\nafter project completion. As the Ishmasai siphon is operational, remodeling of the bypass canal\ncould  be  undertaken  any  time  of  the  year  without  interrupting  water  supply  in  the  main\nconveyance system.\nd. Replacement of Pipes of Shurchasai Siphon\n32.  Surveys and investigations revealed that the topography of Shurchasai valley does not\nallow a feasible bypass canal. Rehabilitation of Shurchasai siphon involves replacement of\npipes.  To  not  disrupt  irrigation  water  supply,  these  works  will  be  conducted  during  the\nnongrowing season. To ensure continuous potable water supply, one pipeline will be replaced at\na time.\ne. Rehabilitation  of  Pravaya  Vetka  Main  Canal  and  Vakhsh-Yavan\nTunnel\n33.  To sustain the benefits of the project investments, some original design flaws of the\nsystem need to be readdressed, and minor rehabilitation of Pravaya Vetka main canal and\nVakhsh-Yavan  tunnel  undertaken.  Of  particular  importance  are  the  works  associated  with\nhandling the emergency situations through efficient communication, timely closing of the system\nintakes, and emptying the canal through spill channels. Being associated with the main supply\nline  and  considering  that  the  works  involved  will  need  canal  closure,  these  works  will  be\nscheduled during the nongrowing season.\n2. Project Implementation Support\n34.  The  project  implementation  support  component  will  provide  inputs  for  surveys,\ninvestigations, design, construction supervision, environmental monitoring and evaluation, and\nsocial impact assessment. The Project will be implemented by a project management office\n(PMO) in Dushanbe and a project site office in Yavan (para. 38). For monitoring and evaluation,\nthe PMO will (i) prepare and analyze baseline economic, social, and environmental data in the\nproject area; and (ii) monitor and evaluate the Project\u2019s economic, social, and environmental\nimpacts including the extent to which the negative economic, social, and environmental impacts", "8\nof the earthquake of 7 May 2001 have been alleviated under the Project, as well as the\nBorrower\u2019s utilization of the O&M practices and procedures developed under the associated TA.\n35.  The PMO will be supported by 116 person-months of domestic consulting input (para.\n40). The consultants will assist in carrying out surveys, investigations, design, construction\nsupervision, environmental monitoring and evaluation, and social impact assessment.\nC. Cost Estimates\n36.  The Project is estimated to cost $4.50 million equivalent, of which $2.76 million (61\npercent)  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $1.74  million  equivalent  (39  percent)  the  local\ncurrency cost. The cost estimates include physical and price contingencies, and $0.40 million\nequivalent  for  taxes  and  duties.  The  foreign  exchange  cost  is  relatively  higher  because\nmachinery, equipment, and most of the construction materials will be imported. A summary of\nthe cost estimates is in Table 1 and detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2.\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nComponent Foreign Local Total\nExchange Currency Cost\nA.

The proposed ADB loan of Special Drawing Rights 2,795,000 ($3.60 million equivalent)\nwill finance the entire foreign exchange cost of $2.76 million and $0.84 million equivalent of the\nlocal currency cost, or 80 percent of the total project cost. The provision of local cost financing is\njustified by budgetary constraints of the Government, and the project focus on enhancing the\nwelfare and living standards of very low income communities in a transition economy (para. 24).", "9\nThe Government will meet the remaining local currency cost of $0.90 million equivalent, or 20\npercent  of  the  total  project  cost.  The  Borrower  will  be  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan.  The\nGovernment  will  make  the  loan  proceeds  available  to  MWRLR  through  budgetary\nappropriations. The loan will be provided from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources and with a term\nof 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1 percent per year\nduring the grace period and 1.5 percent thereafter. The financing plan is summarized in Table 2.\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Total  Percent\nExchange Currency Cost\nAsian Development Bank 2.76 0.84 3.60 80\nGovernment 0.00 0.90 0.90 20\nTotal 2.76 1.74 4.50 100\nSource: Staff estimates.\nE. Implementation Arrangements\n1. Execution and Coordination\n38.  MWRLR,  the  EA,  is  currently  responsible  for  O&M  of  water  conveyance  systems.\nMWRLR has established a PMO in Dushanbe, and will establish a project site office in Yavan\nwithin one month of loan effectiveness. The PMO will be responsible for (i) overall project\nmanagement, including approval of designs, preparation and evaluation of tenders, award of\ncontracts, and procurement of materials and equipment; (ii) recruitment and supervision of\ndomestic consultants; (iii) supervision of implementation and quality control of project works; (iv)\nliaison with beneficiary communities; (v) monitoring and evaluation of Project impacts; and (vi)\npreparation of reports and communications with ADB. The PMO will be staffed by local experts\nsupported by domestic consultants. The organization chart for project implementation is in\nAppendix 3.\n39.  A project steering committee will be established to ensure overall coordination, review\nimplementation  progress,  identify  issues,  determine  measures  to  address  the  issues,  and\nprovide guidance. The steering committee will be chaired by the deputy prime minister in charge\nof the ministries of transport, trade, construction, energy, industry, and emergency situations;\nand comprise representatives from MWRLR; the ministries of agriculture, finance, environment\nprotection; and CLCND. The committee will meet quarterly or more frequently if required.\n2. Consulting Services\n40.  A total of 116 person-months of domestic consulting services financed from loan will be\nrequired  to  assist  project  implementation.  The  project  works  are  simple  engineering  and\nconstruction  works,  and  adequately  qualified  and  experienced  domestic  consultants  are\navailable. Therefore, the services of international consultants are not considered necessary.\nThe consultants will be responsible for surveys, investigations, detailed design, preparation of\ntender  documents,  construction  supervision,  quality  control,  environmental  monitoring,  and\nsocial  assessment.  Field  engineers  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  supervision  of  the\ncontractors.\n41.  The  Government  will  select  and  engage  consultants  through  a  consulting  firm  in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements", "10\nsatisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. The terms of\nreference for the consulting services are in Appendix 4.\n3. Procurement\n42.  Procurement  of  goods  and  services  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be  carried  out  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Tentative packaging of major contracts is\ngiven in Appendix 5. The package of temporary works was completed using force account\nprocedures; the ongoing construction of Loikasai bypass canal is also using force account\nprocedures. The remaining civil works packages are small. Considering that the project site is\nlocated in a remote area with security risks, the Project is unlikely to attract international\ncontractors. International shopping procedures will be used for contracts amounting to $800,000\nequivalent  or  more,  and  local  competitive  bidding  will  be  used  for  civil  works  packages\namounting to less than $800,000 equivalent. Certain civil works for temporary restoration of\nLoikasai  siphon  and  construction  of  Loikasai  bypass  canal,  each  estimated  to  cost  the\nequivalent of $700,000 or less, may be carried out by MWRLR on a force account basis. The\nGovernment has been advised of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy and corresponding provisions\nunder ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement (para. 54)\n4. Advance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing\n43.  At the Government\u2019s request, ADB has approved (i) advance action for recruitment of\nconsultants, and procurement of equipment and civil works; and (ii) retroactive financing of the\nproject works from 8 May 2001. Advance action is necessary to expedite project implementation\nconsidering  that  the  proposed  works  are  critical  for  restoring  normalcy  in  the  social  and\neconomic life of the affected communities. Retroactive financing will ease the Government\u2019s\nbudgetary  constraints  and  minimize  the  impact  of  the  disaster  on  its  development  plan.\nRetroactive financing will be limited to loan-related expenditures since 8 May 2001 until loan\neffectiveness, and is subject to a ceiling of $1.0 million equivalent.\n5. Disbursement Procedures\n44.  To expedite project implementation through timely release of the loan proceeds, the\nGovernment will establish an imprest account promptly after loan effectiveness with an initial\ndeposit of $0.5 million equivalent. The imprest account will be established at a commercial bank\nacceptable  to  ADB,  and  will  be  managed  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  detailed\narrangements  agreed  upon  by  the  Government  and  ADB,  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan\nDisbursement Handbook. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedure will be used to reimburse\nexpenditures and liquidate the imprest account for payments not exceeding $100,000 equivalent\neach. The experience of the EFPR and a recent World Bank review of the CLCND accounting\nsystem suggest that the Government has the capacity to maintain an imprest account and\nexpenditure record in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards.\n6. Implementation Schedule\n45.  The Project will be implemented over one-and-a-half years with physical completion by\n30 April 2003. Appendix 6 illustrates the proposed scheduling of the rehabilitation works. The\nmost urgent task is to construct Loikasai bypass canal before the end of April 2002 to restore\nirrigation  supplies  by  the  beginning  of  the  cropping  season.  During  the  winter  months  of\n2001/2003, Pravaya Vetka main canal and Vakhsh-Yavan tunnel will be rehabilitated. Other", "11\nmajor reconstruction will be undertaken between October 2002 and April 2003 so as not to\ndisrupt farming activities.\n7. Reports, Accounts, and Audit\n46.  MWRLR will submit brief quarterly and annual reports to ADB indicating the progress\nmade and problems encountered during the review period, the steps taken or proposed to\nremedy the problems, the proposed program of activities, and the expected progress during the\nfollowing period. Within three months of physical completion of the Project, the Government will\nsubmit to ADB a completion report providing details about implementation, costs, benefits, and\nother information requested by ADB.\n47.  MWRLR will maintain separate accounts and financial statements for the Project, which\nwill be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. A separate audit opinion\non the use of the imprest account and statement of expenditure procedures will be included in\nthe annual audit report. The Government will provide ADB with an audited report together with\naudited accounts and financial statements nine months after the end of each fiscal year.\n48.  The Government was informed of ADB\u2019s policy on submission of audited accounts,\nwhich covers failure to submitt audited accounts and financial statements by the due date. If the\ndelay in submitting financial statements is more than six months (i) no commitment letter will be\nissued, and (ii) new contract awards may not be approved by ADB. If the delay is more than 12\nmonths, loan disbursements may be suspended or the loan may be canceled.\n8. Midterm Review\n49.  The Government and ADB will jointly carry out a midterm review of the Project, after the\nend of the first year of its implementation. The midterm review will assess (i) implementation\nstatus; (ii) design and construction standards; (iii) physical progress made and disbursements in\nrelation to the implementation schedule; (iv) Government utilization of the O&M practices and\nprocedures, monitoring mechanisms, and data developed under the associated TA (para. 59);\n(v) performance of the consultants and contractors; and (vi) status of compliance with the\ncovenants stipulated in the Loan Agreement. The midterm review will also assess the need for\nany  additional  works  or  changes  in  the  project  scope  to  take  account  of  any  delayed\nconsequences of earthquake activity.\n9. Community Participation\n50.  The proposed activities were discussed in detail with local government officials and\nrepresentatives  of  the  affected  communities.  All  concerned  placed  high  priority  on  the\nrestoration of the water conveyance system at the earliest opportunity. The communities were\ninformed of the proposed solution and time frame, and are well aware of the implications for\ntheir  welfare.  The  proposed  solution  is  not  expected  to  have  any  negative  impact  on  the\ncommunities. The land required for the bypass canals is not cultivated and is not privately\nowned.\n51.  The Government agreed to ensure that the Project is designed and implemented, to the\nextent  possible,  with  active  participation  of  the  project  beneficiaries,  using  participatory\npractices,  as  described  in  ADB\u2019s  handbook,  Mainstreaming  Participatory  Development\nProcesses.  The  Government  also  agreed  to  take  necessary  actions  to  ensure  that  the\ninformation campaign under the associated TA (para. 59) for men, women, and school children", "12\non the structures and functioning of the Yavan water conveyance system, annual maintenance\nrequirements for the system, and the reconstruction works is carried out in a timely manner.\n10. Operation and Maintenance\n52.  The  rehabilitated  facilities  will  continue  to  be  the  responsibility  of  MWRLR  and  its\nrespective local branches. Currently, households and farmers pay for their water, and the\ncollected fees are utilized by the delivery agencies to help maintain the systems. However, the\nsums collected are insufficient to maintain these systems over the longer term. The issue of\ninadequate O&M is a complex one, linked to ability to pay and requires a phased approach that\nis applicable across the irrigation and water supply network. The Government recognizes the\nimportance of ensuring adequate funding and has agreed to a phased program to gradually\nincrease cost recovery levels as a condition of the World Bank\u2019s RIRP,8 which is commencing in\n2001. The proposed Project will supplement the RIRP through the associated TA (para. 59) by\nreviewing practices and helping establish procedures for proper O&M of the project facilities.\nThe TA will also run an information campaign to inform the communities of the structures and\nfunctions of the entire system, the necessary annual maintenance, and construction works\nbeing undertaken.\n11. Resettlement\n53.  The  Project  does  not  involve  any  land  acquisition  but  involves  resettlement  of  six\nfamilies living along the alignment of Loikasai bypass canal. These families are being resettled\nin the same(cid:1)jamoat9 about 1.3 km from the original place. The Government prepared the\ncompensation packages in consultation with the affected families, and the construction of the\nhouses at the new location has commenced. The Appraisal Mission visited the families, inquired\nabout their resettlement, and witnessed construction of the houses. The families have better\naccess to potable water, markets, and education and health facilities. The Government assured\nADB  that  the  families  will  be  resettled  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  Tajik  laws  and\nregulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy on Involuntary Resettlement.  The  short  resettlement  plan\nprepared by the Government is in Appendix 7.\n12. Governance and Anticorruption\n54.  During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to the central and\nlocal  governments.  Attention  was  drawn  to  the  section  on  fraud  and  corruption  in  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement, particularly the need for bidders, suppliers, and contractors to\nobserve  the  highest  standards  of  ethics  in  procurement  and  execution  of  ADB-financed\ncontracts, and the sanctions if fraud and corruption are discovered. Similarly, the anticorruption\nprovisions in ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants were discussed.\n                  \n8  The Yavan irrigation system area is included in the ongoing RIRP (footnote 7). The RIRP covers 130,000 ha; its\nscope includes (i) formulation and adoption of a water code that will provide the legal base for establishment and\nfunctioning of water users\u2019 associations (WUAs), (ii) establishment of WUAs responsible for O&M of irrigation and\ndrainage system, collecting water charges from the beneficiaries, and paying for services of the distribution\nsystem; and (iii) establishment of a transparent system of irrigation service fee with progressive increases in level\nand improvement of collection rates. Full cost recovery, particularly for O&M, will be achieved over 10 years for\ndelivery of water from source to the farmer\u2019s field. The Government will provide funds to meet the shortfalls during\nthe transition period.\n9  A jamoat is the smallest administrative unit", "13\nF. The Executing Agency\n55.  MWRLR is the primary agency responsible for water resource management and is under\nthe authority of the deputy prime minister in charge of the ministries of agriculture, water\nresources and land reclamation, and environment protection. It has a network of region and\ndistrict offices, which are responsible for O&M of the systems within their jurisdiction. Most\nMWRLR professional staff are engineers with a range of skills; the remainder are economists,\naccountants, and lawyers. The staff are rapidly becoming familiar with the procedures followed\nby  multilateral  agencies  having  experience  working  with  ADB,  World  Bank,  and  Islamic\nDevelopment Bank. MWRLR staff made a creditable job of preparing material for the Appraisal\nMission and in designing the Project. Given their detailed knowledge of the water supply system\ninvolved,  its  relatively  small  size,  and  the  essentially  engineering  nature  of  the  activities,\nMWRLR is considered to be capable of managing the Project with the TA support (para. 59). To\nthe extent that additional resources are needed, MWRLR can call upon the experience of\nCLCND, which has performed well in implementing the ADB-financed EFRP.\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environment\n56.  Tajikistan  has  an  environment  that  is  prone  to  natural  disasters  related  to  its\nmountainous terrain, steep and narrow river valleys, sparse mountain vegetation, and annual\nsnowmelt. These natural characteristics have been exacerbated by poor management of natural\nresources. During construction, care will be taken to avoid dust creation and the contamination\nof  water  supplies  that  may  adversely  affect  local  communities  and  livestock.  Construction\nstockpiles and site facilities will use existing buildings as much as possible. If not, they will be\nlocated on wasteland to avoid the destruction of trees and vegetation and to minimize hazards\nto the local population who should be consulted on their location. The main environmental\nproblem associated with operation of the rehabilitated infrastructure will be the need for proper\nO&M and preventing the risk of similar damage. The mitigation strategy will concentrate on\nimproving O&M through training and awareness of engineering staff, improved management of\nO&M activities, and a medium-term program to increase the level of funding from a combination\nof budgetary support and beneficiary contributions. The associated TA (para. 59) will address\nthese institutional and financing issues. The Government agreed to put in place during project\nimplementation  the  environmental  mitigative  measures  proposed  in  the  summary  initial\nenvironmental examination given in Appendix 8.\n2. Social Analysis\n57.  According to the local administration, the incidence of poverty in the project area is about\n90 percent, higher than the 83 percent at the national level. The social structure of the project\narea is one of relatively small jamoats with a majority Tajik population, but commonly some\nother ethnic groups are represented. Virtually all households have a 0.15 ha household plot on\nwhich they grow food crops intensively. These plots are dependent on the same source of water\nsupply as the household. Additional income may come from dehkan (privatized farm) land\nshares usually used to grow cotton and from remittances sent by male members of families who\nseek seasonal work in the Russian Federation. The most vulnerable groups in these villages are\nhouseholds with more than five children, single households headed by women, families without\ndehkan land, and the elderly/infirm. The Project will benefit all households but will inevitably\nbenefit those families with irrigated land the most. However, considering the preponderance of", "14\nthe poor in the project area, the project beneficiaries will be predominantly households living\nbelow the poverty line. An initial social assessment of the project area is in Appendix 9.\n58.  The Project involves resettlement of six families (para. 53). The Government has given\nassurance  that  the  families  are  being  resettled  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Handbook on\nResettlement.\nH. The Technical Assistance\n59.  The TA will review practices and help establish procedures for proper O&M of the Yavan\nconveyance system facilities, and build MWRLR capacity for construction management and\nsupervision.  By  establishing  procedures,  determining  inputs,  and  instituting  a  monitoring\nmechanism  with  strong  beneficiary  participation  for  proper  O&M,  the  TA  will  ensure\nsustainability of project benefits. Also, through hands-on training, the TA will introduce MWRLR\nstaff to efficient practices for construction management and supervision that will considerably\nimprove the capacity of the staff for cost-effectiveness and quality construction. About 4 person-\nmonths of international and 15 person-months of domestic consulting input will be required at a\ncost of $170,000 equivalent. This comprises foreign exchange costs of $116,000 and local\ncurrency costs of $54,000 equivalent. ADB will finance the TA by providing $135,000 equivalent\nfrom  ADB-funded  TA  program  on  a  grant  basis.  The  Government  will  finance  $35,000\nequivalent of the local currency costs. The consultants will be selected and engaged through a\nconsulting firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other\narrangements  for  the  selection  and  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  details  on\nspecialists, terms of reference, and cost estimates of the TA are in Appendix 10.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA. Impact on Poverty and Other Benefits\n60.   The project benefits will result from full restoration of the water supply disrupted by the\ndamaged water conveyance system. About 56,000 people in the project area will be assured of\nreliable  potable  water  supply.  In  addition,  about  11,724  ha  of  cropped  areas  will  receive\nirrigation water on a sustainable basis. This is a critical element of combined efforts to improve\nliving standards in rural areas. The project works will also provide a temporary source of\nemployment for local labor and a small but attractive market for provisioning the construction\nworkforce. The restoration of facilities will enable local communities to concentrate their time\nand efforts on economically rewarding tasks, mostly agricultural, such as crop and livestock\nproduction, instead of concerning themselves with the logistics of a temporary water supply. As\na consequence, health concerns will recede and family cash flows will return to normal. An\nexperienced  domestic  consultant  will  be  recruited  under  the  associated  TA  (para.  59)  to\nundertake a social impact analysis of the restored system.\nB. Risks\n61.  The major risk to the Project will be the possibility of further disruption to the system\nbefore all remedial works are completed. This risk will be mitigated by frequent inspection of the\nsystem during implementation and by completing the rehabilitation of the weakest part of the\nsystem first. The risk of failure of other siphons, which are currently intact but are as old as the\ndamaged siphon and pose a threat, will be mitigated by replacing Ishmasai siphon by a bypass\ncanal and replacing pipes of Shurchasai siphon. Rehabilitation of the Pravaya Vetka main canal\nand Vakhsh-Yavan tunnel will minimize the risk of future disruption of flows in the project area.", "15\nLast, the associated TA will help the Government determine practices and establish procedures\nfor proper O&M and generate adequate funds for this purpose (para. 59), which will safeguard\nagainst recurrence of such disaster.\nVI.

Introduction\n1.  On 7 May 2001, Tajikistan experienced an earthquake whose most immediate effect on\nthe human population was felt in Gozimalik, Khodzamaston, and Yavan rayons (districts) of\nKhatlon Region. The earthquake led to disruption of water supplies to approximately 56,000\npeople, 65,000 livestock, and 11,724 hectares (ha) of arable land. The Government agencies\ntook immediate steps to alleviate the plight of the affected population and asked the Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to provide emergency assistance to restore the water conveyance\nsystem.\n2.  This report is summary initial environmental examination of the proposed loan to the\nTajikistan for the Emergency Restoration of Yavan Water Conveyance System Project. For the\nemergency  project,  the  initial  environmental  examination  was  carried  out  urgently,\nrecommending  some  environmental  issues  to  be  addressed  in  more  detail  during  project\nimplementation. The findings contribute to the ongoing technical assistance (TA) No. 3614,1\nwhich aims to strengthen the national environmental assessment capacity. In addition, findings\nof the Reconnaissance and Appraisal missions in May and June 2001 were used in preparing\nthis  report.  Materials  have  also  been  drawn  from  TA  3514,2  which  has  two  of  the  three\nsubproject areas in the same oblast. The location of the area in the southwestern part of the\ncountry is presented in the map.\nB.  Description of the Project\n3.  The Yavan water conveyance system was completed in 1968. It originates from Baipazin\nReservoir on Vakhsh River and serves Gozimalik, Khodzamaston, and Yavan districts, about 65\nkilometers (km) southeast of the capital city Dushanbe. The system takes water from the river\nthrough a 7.3 km tunnel whose outlet is in the neighboring valley adjacent to the town of Yavan.\nThe water passes from the tunnel to the canal, which has a design capacity of 50 cubic meters\nper second (m3/sec) and irrigates an area of about 26,800 ha. After the initial reach of 27.6 km,\nwhere the system serves an area of 15,526 ha, the canal capacity is reduced to 20 m3/sec. It\ntraverses three valleys using inverted siphons, before entering Gozimalik district. Because of\ndeterioration of various parts of the system over time, the flow in the siphons is generally limited\nto 17 m3/sec. During more than 30 years of use, the pipes have become severely corroded. The\nthickness  has  been  reduced  to  an  alarming  level.  Maintenance  of  the  facilities  has  been\ninadequate because of poor cost recovery from the beneficiaries.\n4.  The earthquake caused cracks in both the pipelines and the open canal parts of the\nsystem. The most severe cracks occurred at the intake structure of Loikasai siphon. Water\npoured from the cracks soaking the soil under the structure. The soil, consisting mainly of\nalluvial deposits, was washed away, and the structure collapsed. Although the regulating gates\nwere closed, water continued to flow until the upstream siphon and open canals were empty.\nAbout 600 meter (m) of Loikasai siphon, and 100 m of the open canal above the intake were\nwashed away.\n5.  The immediate objective of the Project is to fully restore the irrigation and household\nwater  supply  damaged  by  the  earthquake  and  consequent  flooding  of  the  valley.  The\n                                                          \n1  TA 3614-TAJ: Capacity Building for Environmental Assessment and Monitoring, for $600,000, approved on\n21 December 2000.\n2  TA 3514-TAJ: Agriculture Rehabilitation Project, for $750,000, approved on 10 October 2000.", "34 Appendix 8, page 2\ncomponents of the Project are (i) physical infrastructure, and (ii) project implementation support.\nThe restoration of the water conveyance system in the project area and safeguarding it against\nfailure  risk  involves  the  following  works,  under  the  supervision  of  the  Ministry  of  Water\nResources and Land Reclamation (MWRLR):\n(i)  Loikasai siphon has been temporarily restored. The works included two parallel\npipelines (9.0 m3/sec) to restore water supply in the main system, and a pipeline\n(0.5 m3/sec) to supply the local areas. They are needed until Loikasai bypass\ncanal is complete. Later, they will remain as a standby system.\n(ii)  Construction of Loikasai bypass canal, 4.1 km long running along the contour, is\na cost-effective, long-term solution to replace the damaged siphon. The canal will\nbe 8 m wide at the bottom and 3 m deep, with a capacity of 20 m3/sec. The\nassociated structures include the intake and outfall structures, two bridges, and 5\ncross-drainage  works.  Six  families  living  along  the  alignment  need  to  be\nresettled.\n(iii)  Remodeling of Ishmasai bypass canal for a capacity of 20 m3/sec, originally\nconstructed in 1985 for a capacity of 4.0 m3/sec, is a cost-effective way to\nreplace the aging siphon.\n(iv)  Rehabilitation  of  Shurchasai  siphon  by  replacing  its  pipes  with  new  ones  is\nnecessary, as the topography of the valley does not allow a feasible bypass\ncanal.\n(v)  Rehabilitation  of  Pravaya  Vetka  main  canal  and  Vakhsh\u2013Yavan  tunnel  are\nneeded to sustain the benefits of the project investments. Some original design\nflaws of the system need to be readdressed.\nC.  Description of the Environment\n6.  Tajikistan is the most southerly of the former Soviet Union Central Asian republics, which\nbecame independent in 1991. It is bordered to the north by the Kyrgyz Republic, in the east by\nthe Peoples Republic of China, Afghanistan to the south, and Uzbekistan in the west. The area\nis 143,000 square kilometers, divided into four regions, namely Sughd in the north, Region of\nRepublican Subordination in the center, Khatlon in the south, and the mainly mountainous\nGorno-Badakshan in the east.\n7.  The  climate  is  continental,  with  cold  winters  and  hot,  dry  summers,  although  the\nrelatively southerly latitude has an ameliorating impact, and altitude is a significant local factor.\nThe lowland agricultural areas have an average summer temperature of about 26\u00baC and the\nwinter  average  of  6\u00baC.  The  growing  season  of  over  220  days  is  long  by  Central  Asian\nstandards. The rainfall is low, averaging 150 to 250 millimeters (mm) per year, falling mainly in\nwinter and spring, and evaporation is high. As a consequence, agriculture is highly dependent\non irrigation. At higher altitudes, temperature declines, the growing season shortens, and snow\ncover is common for much of the winter. Soils are typically silty gray-brown desert soils of\nalluvial  origin  and  relatively  low  inherent  fertility.  Concentration  of  organic  matter  is  low,\nerodibility high. Groundwater levels are high. Water logging and secondary salinization are\nsignificant environmental problems, caused by failing drainage infrastructure and poor water\nmanagement.  Floods  may  occur  at  any  time  due  to  adverse  weather.  Tajikistan  is  a\nmountainous country, only 960,000 ha are designated as cultivable land. The amount of arable", "35 Appendix 8, page 3\nland per rural household is only 0.9 ha plus about 3.5 ha pasture. Significant areas of often\nsteeply sloping land have been utilized, resulting in increased risk of erosion.\n8.  Poverty, an overriding environmental issue in Tajikistan, is endemic in the rural areas: 83\npercent of rural households are unable to reach the Government\u2019s minimal consumption basket\nequivalent to approximately TJS20 per person per month. The rural poor eat an inadequate diet,\nhave insufficient income or production to provide food for all seasons, and have low stocks of\nfood. Single women, households headed by women, children, and orphans are thought to be\nparticularly vulnerable, as well as large families and those living in remote areas. Poverty tends\nto increase as availability of land per household member decreases.\n9.  Livelihoods are based on irrigated cotton cultivation. About 40 percent of all irrigated\nland is planted to cotton, which is heavily taxed. Food crops may be grown on the remaining\nirrigated land and on household plots. Food insecurity has resulted in extensive hand-cultivation\nof  grazing  lands  on  the  surrounding  hills  for  winter  wheat.  Livestock  are  important  for\nsubsistence. About 20 percent of rural communities had piped water supplies during the Soviet\nera, but few of those schemes have survived the past decade. Many rural households now\ndepend on surface water, usually rivers or canals. Low hygienic and chemical quality of water is\na major factor contributing to the high level of malnutrition among children. Morbidity of the\npopulation with malaria in 1999 was 222 per 100,000 population.\n10.  Administration is controlled by the central Government. Its agencies are represented at\nboth the oblast (region) and rayon (district) levels, with suboffices at jamoat (village) level where\nneeded.\n11.  As a summary, Tajikistan has an environment that is prone to natural disasters related to\nits dynamic mountainous terrain, steep and narrow river valleys, sparse mountain vegetation,\nand annual snowmelt. Those natural characteristics have been exacerbated by deforestation\nand  overgrazing,  which  were  features  of  the  former  regime.  In  addition,  salinization  of\nagricultural  soils  resulting  from  poorly  managed  irrigation  systems  is  a  growing  problem.\nSelective reforestation, improved pasture management, and more effective irrigation and water\nsupply systems would have a positive impact on environmental conditions.\nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigative Measures\n1.  Environmental Issues Arising from the Project Location\n12.  Environmental impact related to the location can be considered small considering the\nneed to relocate only six households and compensate the permanent and temporary losses of\nland areas. The principles of compensation are presented in the assurances of the Government.\nThe issues include (i) lost income during the processing and replacement of the housing and\nproperties for relocation of the household; (ii) loss of productive land due to excavation works\nand dumping of the materials; (iii) loss of connection to the market and other community, or to\npastures and remote parts of the farm; and (iv) loss of land at the borrowing sites, construction\nareas, and areas needed for facilities. Timely liquidation and implementation is important. Most\nsensitive  areas  are  located  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  new  canals,  and  those  to  be\nexpanded. Temporary losses should be addressed correspondingly.\n13.  Possible changes in groundwater levels and salinity risks are considered small, but they\nshould be monitored during project implementation. Lost access to groundwater, as well as\nweakened drainage of farmland should be compensated.", "36 Appendix 8, page 4\n14.  Negative effects on biodiversity seem insignificant based on the brief survey. However,\nthe possible sensitive areas, which will be destroyed or harmed by the Project, should be\nchecked during the design and implementation, as well as the possible cultural heritages.\n2.  Environmental Issues Arising from Project Design\n15.  The hydrogeological and geological properties of the soils to be excavated should be\nmonitored to keep the risks minimal. A particular concern is the somewhat unforeseeable\nstability, as well as chemical composition, of the alluvial sediments. Appropriate representative\nprofiles should be surveyed prior to digging.  Although salinity is the main chemical concern,\nsome representative groundwater samples should be analyzed to eliminate the risk of heavy\nmetals or other elements that could harm the water quality for irrigation and potable purposes.\n16.  Dumping sites for the excavated materials, as well as the borrowing sites, should be\ndefined in the context of other engineering design. Landscaping after the works should be\naddressed, with particular attention to erosion control. A rough estimate of the amount of\nlandmasses to be removed is 1-2 million m3, which requires careful planning. The masses may\nbe used to fill waterlogged claypots or other areas suitable for mosquito breeding. Particularly,\nthe design should not allow creation of new waterlogged wetlands by cutting the drainage of\nfloods.\n17.  The working camps and engine stations should be designed with appropriate sanitation\nfacilities and maintenance areas to prevent spills of the oil or other chemicals to the ground or\ngroundwater. Inspectors should be trained and appointed to supervise those practices. A useful\ntool  is  a  monthly  environmental  report,  to  be  required  from  each  of  the  contractors.  The\ncontracts should state the environmental responsibilities in detail.\n18.  With  these  mitigative  measures  implemented,  the  adverse  environmental  impact\nresulting from the construction stage is considered minor, except the increased suspended\nsolids in the water, as well as siltation and corrosion of the structures.  The high concentration of\nsuspended solids may apparently last several years after the construction works have been\ncompleted, depending on the efficiency of erosion control measures that have been taken.\n3.  Environmental Issues Associated with Construction Stage\n19.  During  the  construction,  negative  environmental  impacts  can  be  reduced  to  an\nacceptable level by applying appropriate mitigative measures and monitoring as designed. The\nmain concern is erosion control. Monitoring of the possible cavitation in canals, erosion and\nreplantation of slopes, and control of hydrological changes in the vicinity of the working sites\nshould be continuous. Financing for those activities should be allocated in the project budget.\n20.  Facilities  and  discipline  in  the  maintenance  of  engines  also  require  monitoring  and\nfinancing during the construction stage. Temporary arrangements such as engine stations,\nmaterial stores, transportation routes, dumping sites, supply of water to users whose connection\nhas been temporarily cut, and the farmers\u2019 traffic, will be addressed in the contracts, and\nmonitored by monthly reports.\n4.  Environmental Issues Arising from Project Operation\n21.  The  main  environmental  problem  associated  with  operation  of  the  rehabilitated\ninfrastructure will be the need for proper maintenance and generally minimizing the risk of", "37 Appendix 8, page 5\nsimilar damage. The mitigating strategy will concentrate on improving maintenance through\ntraining  and  awareness  of  engineering  staff,  improved  management  of  operation  and\nmaintenance (O&M) activities and a medium-term program to increase the level of funding to\nO&M from a combination of budgetary support and beneficiary contributions. The associated\nadvisory TA is designed to address these institutional and financing issues.\n22.  The negative environmental impacts arising from operation of the Project could result\nfrom  further  erosion,  which  may  continue  for  several  months  after  the  works  have  been\ncompleted. The water will contain considerable amounts of eroded materials, which may cause\nsiltation  of  the  structures,  corrosion,  and  limitations  to  the  potable  usability  of  water.  The\noccurrence  of  harmful  chemical  or  biological  constituents  is  addressed  in  the  Institutional\nRequirement and Environmental Monitoring Program (para. 24).\n23.  During operation, the significant benefits will cover environmental issues. The living\nconditions of the beneficiaries will be improved, health conditions will be enhanced, and poverty\nwill be reduced indirectly. In this context, comparison of the environmental costs and benefits\nhas not been possible, but negative impacts during operation appear insignificant.\nE.  Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program\n24.  MWRLR,  the  Executing  Agency  of  the  Project,  has  limited  environmental  expertise\namong its own staff. The practice is that the Ministry of Environment Protection (MEP) assigns\nan environment specialist to assist the executing agency during the design and implementation\nof  relevant  projects.  The  project  may,  in  addition  to  the  services  of  a  full-time  domestic\nenvironment  specialist  during  the  design  and  implementation,  need  the  assistance  of  an\ninternational expert for two weeks as a component of a supporting TA.\n25.  An important requirement is use of a participatory approach, including consultation with\nthe beneficiaries and affected people, and free access to environmental information. A practical\nway is to organize seminars in the villages to discuss the environmental and social issues\nrelevant to the project. Interested nongovernment organizations and other organizations may be\nassociated  in  this  regard.  The  participatory  approach  has  been  incorporated  into  the\nGovernment\u2019s assurances.\n26.  The  environmental  monitoring  program  will  include  (i)  weekly  monitoring  of  the\ngroundwater level and salinity at 10-20 representative monitoring stations; (ii) analyses for\nmetals such as arsene, iron, manganese, cadmium, copper, zinc, chromium, and mercury from\ngroundwater  samples  taken  from  different  depths;  (iii)  monthly  analyses  of  stream  flow,\ntemperature, acidity/alkalinity, pH, chemical oxygen demand, salinity, and suspended solids\nfrom two stations in the new canal after the construction; (iv) microbiological quality twice a year\nof  canal  water  in  the  3-5  places  where  the  water  is  used  for  drinking  purposes;  and  (v)\nmonitoring of the construction works with monthly reports and occasional inspections.\nF.  Findings and Recommendations\n27.  Considering the urgency of processing the emergency loan project, it is recommended\nthat this report would suffice as both the initial environmental examination and summary report.\nThe findings indicate that the negative environmental impacts of the Project can be mitigated to\nan  acceptable  level.  Hence,  it  is  recommended  that  the  Project  would  be  classified  as\nenvironmental category B, which does not necessarily require a full-scale environmental impact\nassessment.", "38 Appendix 8, page 6\n28.  An  associated  TA  is  recommended  to  assist  the  Government  in  addressing  the\nenvironmental  mitigation  and  monitoring  recommendations  as  above,  and  supervise  the\ninstitutional capacity building.\n29.  It is recommended that the designs (i) make maximum use of contouring; (ii) minimize\nthe  creation  of  steep  slopes;  (iii)  provide  adequate  slope  protection  using  bioengineering\nsolutions; and (iv) select disposal areas for borrowed spoils that will preserve valuable land,\nwetlands, and biodiversity.\n30.  During construction, care will be taken to avoid dust creation, and the contamination of\nwater supplies, which may adversely affect local communities and livestock.\n31.  Construction stockpiles and site facilities are recommended to use existing buildings as\nfar as possible. If not, they should be located on wasteland to avoid the destruction of trees and\nvegetation, and to minimize hazards to the local population who should be consulted on their\nlocation.\n32.  The possible occurrence of significant biodiversity sanctuaries or cultural heritage sites\nshould be monitored during design and implementation of the Project.\nG.  Conclusions\n33.  As the adverse environmental consequences resulting from the Project can be mitigated\nto  an  acceptable  level,  and  the  other  technical  alternatives  to  address  the  objectives  are\napparently not feasible, this report is recommended to be sufficient. Further environmental\nimpact assessment is not required.\n34.  A  program  should  be  established  under  the  Project  to  address  environmental\nawareness, mitigation, monitoring, and financing issues in a manner suitable for an emergency\nproject.", "39 Appendix 9, page 1\nSUMMARY INITIAL SOCIAL ASSESSMENT\n1.  Tajikistan\u2019s economy recovered significantly during 1997-2000 with a cumulative gross\ndomestic product increase of more than 20 percent. Notwithstanding this, Tajikistan remains a\npoor country, with 1999 per capita gross national income of $280.1 The civil war and economic\ncontraction  have  caused  a  drastic  deterioration  in  living  conditions.  The  Tajikistan  living\nstandards survey undertaken in 1999 shows that 83 percent of the population lives below the\npoverty  line.2  The  isolated  Gorno-Badakhshan  Autonomous  Region  is  the  poorest  in  the\ncountry, with 94.7 percent of its population living below the  poverty line, followed by Khatlon\nRegion  (93.3  percent),  Leninabad  Region  (88.1  percent),  the  Region  of  Republican\nSubordination  (81.5  percent),  and  Dushanbe  (67.7  percent).  With  the  high  human  cost  of\neconomic transition, which was exacerbated by the civil war3 and natural disasters, Tajikistan\u2019s\nhuman development index,4 declined from 0.620 in 1992 to 0.528 in 1997. Despite continuous\ndifficulties, the country\u2019s human development index increased to 0.601 in 1999.5 Unemployment\nis believed to have increased to approximately 30 percent in 1999.6 Jobs are increasing in the\nemerging private sector but labor markets remain weak due to the narrow base of economic\ngrowth.\n2.  Public expenditure on social sectors (health, education, and social protection) as a\npercentage of gross domestic product fell from 19.8 percent in 1992 to 4.2 percent in 1998\nunder severe budget constraints after independence. In 2000, the Government placed poverty\nreduction at the center of its growth strategy, and committed to increasing and maintaining a\nbudget allocation of 42 percent for overall social sector expenditures starting from 2001, up from\n19.5 percent in 1999, and 39 percent in 2000. With this increase, public expenditure on social\nsectors as a percentage of gross domestic product will be over 5.9 percent. Social sector\nmanagement and the social services delivery system must be improved to ensure that the gains\nfrom economic growth address social needs.\n3.  Major education indicators show that people\u2019s access to basic education has declined\nsince independence. Many poor families are unable to purchase textbooks, adequate clothes,\nand other belongings, and to cover transport expenditures. In contrast, enrollment in higher\neducation has remained remarkably constant. However, due to the lack of job opportunities,\nyoung people often have to engage in activities other than those for which they were trained,\nand some of them leave the country. In the face of deteriorating education services and to\naddress the issues in the new economic environment, the Government allowed the private\nsector to get involved in education in 1994. Also, steps were taken to reform the curricula and\n                                                          \n1 Data based on the World Bank\u2019s atlas method. By comparison, 1999 per capita gross national income in\nneighboring  countries  were  the  following:  Azerbaijan,  $460;  Kazakhstan,  $1,250;  Kyrgyz  Republic,  $300;\nTurkmenistan, $670; and Uzbekistan, $720.\n2 The World Bank. 2000.

The official figure does not include substantial unemployment and underemployment in inactive state-\nowned enterprises, and many of the unemployed do not register because of the low unemployment benefits. Actual\nunemployment in Tajikistan was estimated to be much higher at about 30 percent according to the World Bank\u2019s\npoverty assessment of April 2000. The International Labour Organization estimated unemployment at 16 percent\n(1999).", "40 Appendix 9, page 2\ntextbooks, and new education standards were introduced in 1996. In addition, fees and user\ncharges were introduced in schools and universities. Textbooks are no longer provided free,\nalthough the current charge is only a fraction of the actual cost.\n4.  The health care system also experienced a crisis after 1991. The network of basic health\ncare provision broke down, people\u2019s access to basic health care became limited, and the quality\nof health services deteriorated. The war and natural disasters destroyed a large number of\nhealth facilities. The Government made an initial response to the difficult situation in health. The\nHealth Law passed in 1997 allows private medical centers to be established and permits\ndoctors working in public hospitals to engage in private practice located on private property. The\nGovernment also took measures to reduce operational costs by cutting the number of hospital\nbeds from 55,000 in 1992 to 44,000 in 1997, and by introducing charges for certain health\nservices. To further improve health care, the Government adopted the national strategy Health\nFor All Up To 2005, and implementation of the strategy The National Program of Health Care\nReform in Tajikistan was adopted in 1998.\n5.  Like other Central Asian republics, Tajikistan\u2019s legal and administrative systems protect\nwomen from discrimination. However, the drastically changed social situation in transition has\nmade it more difficult for women to balance their public and private roles. The transition has\nseverely  affected  industries  that  employed  a  high  proportion  of  women  (e.g.,  textiles,\nmanufacturing,  and  agriculture),  causing  them  to  disproportionately  lose  their  jobs.  Other\nsectors, in which women predominate, such as education and health care, have experienced\nhigh wage arrears. Also, women have suffered most from the decline of social service delivery,\nincluding the discontinuation of many of the state benefits that supported women, such as child\nallowances and child care. In addition, the civil war created 26,000 widows, resulting in a\nsignificant increase in households headed by women, while men made up the vast majority of\ndeaths resulting from the war.\n6.  Improving governance is key to keeping the postconflict society on the road to recovery\nand development by addressing poverty reduction and structural reform to promote transition to\na market economy. The fight against economic crime, including corruption and drug smuggling\nthrough the Afghan border, has become a major challenge for the Government since the\ninternal conflict ended. Presidential decrees to tackle corruption and drug trafficking were issued\nin May 2000. Promotion and dissemination of laws and regulations are necessary.\n7.  Agriculture remains a key sector of Tajikistan\u2019s economy, contributing 20-27 percent of\ngross  domestic  product,  one  third  of  export  earnings,  and  accounting  for  60  percent  of\nemployment. Tajikistan\u2019s transition has been accompanied by a significant shift in labor from\nindustry to agriculture. More than half of Tajikistan\u2019s industrial workers have become redundant\nsince  1990,  and  the  agricultural  workforce  has  simultaneously  increased  by  30  percent.\nAccordingly, agriculture and agroprocessing are now expected to play a major role in economic\nrecovery and poverty reduction in Tajikistan given the evident comparative advantages and\nscope for productivity improvements. Exploitation of these opportunities requires elimination of\nwidespread distortions and disincentives that prevailed under central planning.\n8.  Land reform is essential to develop the agriculture sector as arable land is scarce, only\n0.14  hectares  per  capita.  The  civil  war  delayed  Tajikistan\u2019s  economic  reforms.  However,\nstructural reforms have progressed substantially since 1997, and the Government has boosted\nland reform since mid-1998. Structural reforms were accelerated in 2000, with progress made in\nsmall-scale  enterprise  privatization,  tax  administration  reform,  development  of  the  treasury\nsystem, and strengthening of the auditing system. In the agriculture sector, half of the arable", "41 Appendix 9, page 3\nland is now privatized. More state-owned farms should be privatized and newly privatized\nfarmers supported. As a part of financial sector reforms, nonbank financial institutions must be\ndeveloped to expand the outreach of financial intermediation, including to rural areas, where\nabout 73 percent of the population lives.\n9.   Khatlon oblast (region), where the damaged water conveyance system is located, was\nseriously affected by the civil war, and is the second poorest region of the country. In the project\narea, the incidence of poverty is estimated at 90 percent.\n10.  The water conveyance system to be restored runs through three rayons (districts):\nGozimalik, Khodzhamaston, and Yavan. The majority of the population below the broken siphon\nreside in Gozimalik.7 In 2000, about 70,700 people lived in this rural district. About 35,000\ncompletely lost their source of water after the catastrophe at the siphon. Women outnumber\nmen slightly, constituting 51 percent of the population. The population is young, with 52.9\npercent under 20 years of age, and 29.8 percent between 20 and 40. The crude rate of natural\nincrease is 12.6 per 1,000 due to a crude birth rate of 16.4 per 1,000 and crude mortality rate of\n3.8 per 1,000. About 1,531 calories per day were available to people in this area in 1991\ncompared with the required 2,400 calories per day. Observers have remarked that stunting,\nreflecting chronic childhood malnutrition, is most pronounced in such cotton-growing regions of\nthe country.\n11.  Landholding in Gozimalik is dominated by five kolkhoz or collective statefarms; there are\nonly 200 dekhan or private farms in the district. According to one informant, farmers may apply\nfor a private farm after paying off their debts to the kolkhoz. This strongly favors large families\nwith  many  young  male  laborers  and  disadvantages  smaller  families  and  the  200  or  so\nhouseholds headed by women, including those widowed in the civil war. In 1999, about 10,900\nhectares of crops were planted; half, or about 5,400 hectares, was in cotton, and 2,900 hectares\nin grain. In 1999, about 4,343 tons of cotton and 2,175 tons of grain were produced and 2,622\nhead of cattle and 4,953 head of sheep (and goats) produced 349 tons of milk and 173 tons of\nmeat.\n12.  Gozimalik has 56 schools with 1,100 teachers and 16,800 pupils, including 7,200 girls.\nThere are 59 doctors and 325 nurses.\n13.  Reform of landholding and local governance of irrigation and domestic water systems is\ncrucial for the agriculture sector and socioeconomic development in general. Creation of water\nusers  associations  through  bottom-up,  participatory  processes  would  bring  farmers  and\ndomestic water users together to plan, manage, and monitor local water supplies and the\nfinancing required to maintain these. Federations of water users associations at the secondary\nchannel level would contribute to empowering citizens and communities in which they reside.\nLinkages with other programs, such as school committees and credit for microenterprises,\nwould reinforce local capacities and enhance social capital. The organization and training of\nwater users associations is included in an ongoing World Bank-financed project.8\n                                                          \n7  Data were provided for Gozimalik by officials \u201cbased on Government statistics and the World Bank Poverty\nAssessment.\u201d  The source of the data is not specified. The statistics pertain only to Gozimalik. A small number of\nconversations were held in the district with assistance from a translator, and with nongovernment organization\nstaff members and citizens from rural areas who now live in Dushanbe. Further research would be required to\nobtain higher quality data.\n8  World Bank Loan 33870-TAJ: Rural Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project, for $20.0 million, approved on 6 July\n2000.", "42 Appendix 9, page 4\n14.  For the restoration of the Yavan water conveyance system to lead to sustainable results,\ninstitutional  and  technical  issues  must  be  addressed  simultaneously.  At  a  minimum,  an\nextensive and comprehensive information campaign is essential to inform men, women, and\nschool  children,  of  the  structure  and  function  of  the  entire  system,  the  necessary  annual\nmaintenance, the reconstruction works being undertaken now, and the real costs of these. Such\na campaign is included in the scope of the associated TA.", "43 Appendix 10, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR\nSUPPORT FOR FACILITATING SUSTAINABLE PROJECT BENEFITS\nA.  Objectives\n1.  The objectives of the technical assistance (TA) are to (i) review practices and help\nestablish procedures for proper operation and maintenance (O&M) of the project facilities, and\n(ii) build capacity of the Ministry of Water Resources and Land Reclamation (MWRLR) in\nconstruction management and supervision.
