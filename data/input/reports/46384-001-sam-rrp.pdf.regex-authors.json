THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based  grant  to  the  Independent  State  of  Samoa  for  the  Public  Sector  Financial \nManagement Program. \n \n2.  The program is designed to improve the Government of Samoa\u2019s (government) capacity \nin public financial management and to strengthen the country\u2019s resilience to external shocks by \nsupporting the government\u2019s medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) and the joint policy action \nmatrix  (JPAM)  on  public  financial  management  policies  and  processes,  developed  by  the \ngovernment and its development partners.1 \n  \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Samoa  is  a  small  and  remote  Pacific  island  country  with  a  population  of  close  to \n200,000. It has limited natural resources,  a narrow economic base, is isolated and poorly \nconnected, and is highly vulnerable to external shocks \u2013 such as global economic changes and \nnatural disasters. These factors have constrained economic growth and contributed to a high \ndegree of volatility in economic performance. As a result, the economy has a high reliance on \nremittances and development assistance to underpin steadfast and sustained growth.  \n \n4.  The government has demonstrated a strong commitment to doing what is necessary to \ngenerate sustainable economic growth. Since the 1990s, it has made considerable progress in \ndeveloping  and  implementing  policy,  legal,  and  structural  reforms  designed  to  strengthen \ninstitutions;  improve  productivity;  create  an  enabling  environment  for  private  sector \ndevelopment; improve the performance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs); strengthen budget \nprocesses; and tighten expenditure controls.2 In 2008, this culminated in the launch of phase 1 \nof the public financial management reform plan (PFMRP), which aims to strengthen public \nfinancial management systems to promote the efficient use of resources for the public good. \nPhase 1 was completed in early 2011; phase 2 is underway and expected to end in late 2014.  \n \n5.  The  government\u2019s  perseverance  in  implementing  the  reforms  necessary  for \nmacroeconomic  stability,  its  outward  orientation,  prudent  fiscal  policy,  and  investment  in \ninfrastructure helped the economy grow by nearly 4.0% per annum in the decade leading up to \n2008. During fiscal year (FY) 2008, the fiscal deficit was 1.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) \nwhile public debt was well within the limits of affordability at 35.2% of GDP. Moreover, the \ngovernment had made steady progress in achieving poverty reduction and social development \nthrough a combination of reforms and effective use of development assistance. \n \n6.  However,  since  2009,  Samoa\u2019s  economy  has  been  affected  by  a  series  of  severe \nexternal shocks. The global economic crisis and the related slowdown in demand triggered a \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Important reforms included (i) passing two new acts in 2001 (on public financial management, and management \nand supervision of public bodies); (ii) steering budgeting, accounting, and reporting away from input-focused \napproaches to greater reliance on outputs; and (iii) starting to computerize the treasury and accounting, and \ninitiating a financial management information system. With Asian Development Bank support, in 2010 and 2011, \nthe  government  implemented  the  public  financial  management  reform  plan,  made  progress  in  liberalizing \ntelecommunications and privatized SamoaTel, revised foreign investment regulations, and drafted the Personal \nProperty Securities Act. \n ", "2  \nsharp downturn of the economy as tourism, manufacturing, and agriculture receipts fell. This \nwas closely followed by a devastating tsunami in September 2009, which caused substantial \ndamage to infrastructure, homes, and livelihoods. The combination of these events led to a \n5.1% decline in GDP in FY2009. Reconstruction and key public investments laid the basis for \nthe resumption of growth but at the expense of large deficits and escalating public debt. In \nresponse to this, the government embarked on a program of reforms aimed at consolidating \nfiscal adjustment to strengthen the economy\u2019s resilience to possible future shocks, particularly \nnatural disasters. Budget support from ADB, Australia, New Zealand, and the World Bank to \nassist  the  Strategy  for  the  Development  of  Samoa  (SDS),  2012\u20132016  enabled  actions  to \nmitigate impacts on the most vulnerable in society, advance public financial management and \nSOE reforms in a difficult fiscal environment, and put in place systems to better respond to the \nfrequent natural disasters in Samoa.3  \n \n7.  In December 2012, Samoa was hit by another natural disaster, tropical cyclone Evan, \nwhich caused damages and loss to the economy, estimated at more than $210 million (about \n30% of GDP), damaging transport, power, water, and sanitation infrastructure, as well as school \nbuildings and housing. With the economy still underperforming after the earlier shocks, the \ngovernment turned to development partners to help deepen and extend the efforts made under \nprevious reforms, and to assist with the fiscal adjustment needed in the medium term to ensure \ndebt sustainability. A key element of this has been the formulation of the MTFF, linked to the \nJPAM, which charts a clear path to bringing the government\u2019s fiscal position to more sustainable \nlevels  over  a  period  of  3\u20135  years,  while  maintaining  aggregate  demand  and  improving \nproductivity. The plan aims at protecting the economy against future crises while laying the \nbasis for sustained economic growth by (i) helping the government implement its structural \nreform program to improve medium-term growth prospects and (ii) adopting mitigation strategies \nto strengthen climate resilience. The latter include climate-proofing of economic infrastructure \nand incorporating disaster risk preparedness into the design of reconstruction investments. This \ntwo-pronged approach is consistent with the objectives of the SDS, which recognizes that a \nfoundation of macroeconomic stability, fiscal stability, and stronger resilience to exogenous \nshocks is essential to restoring Samoa to a path of inclusive growth and poverty reduction.  \n \n8.  The latest shock will delay the return to a more sustainable fiscal position. The GDP \ngrowth estimate for FY2013 is 0.9%. GDP is projected to increase to 3.1% in FY2014 and 2.6% \nin FY2015 as post-cyclone reconstruction starts; but is forecast to level off at 2.5% thereafter. \nThe overall fiscal deficit is estimated at 6.9% of GDP in FY2013 and is projected to increase to \n8.2%  in  FY2014.  The  government,  however,  is  firmly  committed  to  achieving  fiscal \nsustainability; hence its MTFF sets out a program of fiscal adjustment with a deficit target of \n3.5% of GDP in FY2016 (Table 1). Samoa has limited capacity to take on more debt to support \neconomic  recovery.  The  2013  World  Bank\u2013International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  Debt \nSustainability Analysis raised Samoa\u2019s debt distress classification from moderate to high and \nestimated that any increase in concessional loans from development partners could see the \ndebt to GDP ratio exceeding 70% of GDP by FY2015.4 Recognizing this, both ADB and the \nWorld Bank shifted from a mixture of 50:50 credit and grant financing to a 100% grant financing \nin June 2013. The MTFF presents a ratio of debt to GDP of 50% by FY2020.5 More broadly, in \nMay 2013, the IMF approved balance of payments support of $9 million under its Rapid Credit \n                                                \n3  Budget support refers to financial assistance that supports a medium-term program and is provided directly and \nregularly to a recipient country\u2019s budget, using the country\u2019s own financial systems and budget procedures. \n4  International Monetary Fund. 2013.

These changes will support Samoa\u2019s return to a higher-\ngrowth state and strengthen resilience to future shocks.   \n \nTable 1: Economic and Fiscal Outlook, FY2009\u2013FY2016 \nItem  FY2009  FY2010  FY2011  FY2012  FY2013 e  FY2014 f  FY2015 f  FY2016 f \nReal GDP (% change)  (5.1)  0.4  2.0  1.2  0.9  3.1  2.6  2.5 \nInflation (% change)  10.0  (0.3)  2.9  5.5  4.5  (2.0)  4.0  4.0 \nCurrent expenditure \n(% of GDP)   25.2  24.0  24.8  29.4  31.8  31.0  29.5  29.4 \nOf which personnel \ncosts a  36.9  25.0  30.0  38.8  37.6  32.5  38.9  38.3 \nDevelopment \nexpenditure (% of \nGDP)  12.8  18.9  18.0  13.7  15.7  20.0  18.8  17.2 \nOverall fiscal balance \n(% of GDP)  (4.2)  (7.5)  (6.4)  (5.6)  (6.9)  (8.2)  (6.9)  (3.5) \nTotal public debt (% of \nGDP)  44.4  49.5  50.1  55.5  61.8  66.8  70.6  70.9 \n( ) = negative, e = estimate, f = forecast, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product. \na Personnel costs as a percentage of current expenditure include wages and salaries of all ministries and public     \nbeneficiary bodies, previously reflected as part of grants to state-owned enterprises prior to FY2012.  \nSource: International Monetary Fund. 2003. Samoa: Staff Report. Washington, DC.  \n \n9.  In  the  short  term,  undertaking  a  cyclone  recovery  program  requires  a  period  of \nexpansionary  fiscal  activity  and  will,  inevitably,  add  to  the  public  debt  burden.  Public \ninvestments will increase sharply, straining Samoa\u2019s stressed financial management systems. \nAs these investments increase, it is essential that public spending delivers value for money. In \nthe medium term, Samoa will need to restore fiscal sustainability and continue with efforts to \ngrow  its  private  sector.  Attempting  fiscal  consolidation  on  the  demand  side  involves \nincorporating  climate  resilience  measures  into  the  design  of  reconstruction  investments  to \nmitigate future losses and expenditure demands in the event of disasters.  \n \n1.  Government\u2019s Policy Reform Matrix for Budget Support \n10.  Drawing on progress made and priorities set under the PFMRP, the government, along \nwith ADB, the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), the European Union \n(EU), the IMF, the New Zealand Aid Programme, and the World Bank, agreed to the JPAM in \nMarch 2013.7 The JPAM prioritizes policy reforms in five areas: (i) strengthening planning, (ii) \nenhancing  the  contribution  by  SOEs,  (iii)  improving  public  financial  management  systems, \n(iv) maintaining  overall  macroeconomic  stability  and  fiscal  discipline,  and  (v) deepening \nconsultation and engagement with stakeholders. The emphasis of the JPAM on public financial \nmanagement, good governance, and macroeconomic management is fully consistent with the \nSDS. While supporting the overall objective of the JPAM but unlike AusAID and NZ\u2014which \nadopted the full JPAM\u2014ADB and the World Bank, in consultation with the government, agreed \n                                                \n6  International Monetary Fund. 2013.

A copy of the JPAM is in the supplementary appendixes. \n \n11.  Development partners have assisted the government in implementing reform priorities \nthrough  technical  advisory  support.  ADB  has  supported  SOE  reforms  and  internal  audit \nprocesses, the World Bank has supported reforms in public debt management, and the Pacific \nFinancial  Technical  Assistance  Centre  and  the  IMF  have  been  closely  involved  in  policy \ndiscussions on fiscal reforms. In addition to the program, ADB\u2019s support for implementing the \nJPAM  continues  through  regional  technical  assistance  such  as  the  Strengthening  Public \nFinancial  Management  in  Pacific  Developing  Member  Countries8 and  the  Private  Sector \nDevelopment Initiative.9 All support from development partners will help the government build \ncapacity for public financial management and accomplish the policy actions contained in the \nJPAM. \n \n12.  While the program is not a cofinancing arrangement, it is integral to a joint undertaking \nwith  other  development  partners  to  help  meet  the  JPAM-related  financing  gap  through \nindependent, policy-based budget support. In this regard, during FY2014, Australia will disburse \nabout $6.0 million and New Zealand $0.7 million as the final tranche of a 3-year budget support \nprogram.10 The World Bank approved budget support for $15.0 million in June 2013. \n \n13.  The program is anchored in the government\u2019s MTFF. It is structured around four outputs: \n(i) improved SOE performance by reforming corporate governance, (ii) improved public financial \nmanagement systems, (iii) improved public debt management, and (iv) recovery and resilience \nto natural disasters. The outputs will be achieved through a set of policy actions drawn from the \nJPAM and from the cyclone recovery program.  \n \n14.  The program is part of a sequenced, medium-term effort to assist the government in \nstrengthening its public financial management. It builds on the results and lessons from ADB\u2019s \nprevious assistance, the Economic Recovery Support Program,11 and from ADB\u2019s support for \nreform around the region. The recovery support program was completed in a timely manner. \nSome key lessons are: (i) the government must own the program; (ii) reforms must be politically \nas well as technically feasible; (iii) the program\u2019s policy actions need to be focused and take into \naccount  the  country\u2019s  context;  (iv)  stakeholders,  including  development  partners,  must \nunderstand that reforms in the Pacific context can take time to become self-sustaining; and \n(v) \u201cchampions for change\u201d contribute to the success of policy-based operations.12 Reforms in \nsmall Pacific islands like Samoa cannot take place overnight. Policy reforms and policy actions \nneed to be realistic and factor in a slower pace, i.e., they cannot be too ambitious. \n \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2008.

Samoa has \n27 SOEs with estimated total assets of $618 million. SOEs account for 6% of GDP, 12% of \nformal  sector  employment,  and  32%  of  public  sector  employment.  SOEs  provide  most \ninfrastructure services and operate numerous businesses, which crowds out the private sector. \nInefficient  SOEs  have  resulted  in  high  costs  of  doing  business,  thus  limiting  Samoa\u2019s \ncompetitiveness. Returns on government investment in SOEs have been low\u2014between FY2002 \nand FY2010, the average return on equity of Samoa\u2019s SOEs was 0.3% and their average return \non assets was just 0.2%.13 Poorly performing SOEs are a drain on the government\u2019s budget. \n  \n16.  The Public Bodies (Performance and Accountability) Act in 2001 (Public Bodies Act) and \nthe subsequent policy paper on SOE ownership, performance, and divestment established the \nprinciples by which the government places its SOEs on a commercial footing and divests non-\nstrategic SOEs. Progress has been made in fostering corporate governance  by moving to \nindependent boards of directors and capacity development for potential directors, intended to \nhelp SOEs focus on their commercial mandate. Implementation of both the act and the policy \nhas  been  slow,  primarily  due  to  limited  technical  capacity  and  the  government\u2019s  cautious \napproach to SOE divestment. Although the government\u2019s intention is to retain 100% ownership \nof the major infrastructure SOEs, policy allows private sector participation in these SOEs.  \n \n3.  Public Financial Management Systems Development \n17.  The government is committed to public financial management reforms. Phase 1 of the \nPFMRP was completed in early 2011. Its achievements included the formulation of an aid policy \nand debt management strategy, a full review of all finance sector systems and procedures, and \nthe adoption of an outcome-based budget with forward estimates. Twelve sector plans were \ncompleted, but most still needed to finalize the associated expenditure and monitoring and \nevaluation frameworks. The first phase of an institutional strengthening program for the Ministry \nof Revenue was also initiated. The government is now implementing phase 2 of the PFMRP, \nsuch as finalizing the internal audit strategy, preparing a debt management reform plan, and \nmoving toward a fully operational MTFF. A budget performance framework was introduced in \nthe FY2012 budget seeking to better link outcomes and outputs. A small procurement division is \nnow functioning within the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and is leading procurement reforms.  \n \n4.  Strengthening Public Debt Management \n18.  Outcome 1 of the SDS is macroeconomic stability. To achieve this, the SDS aims to \ncontinue strengthening public financial management, and implementing and monitoring the debt \nmanagement strategy. It sets a target budget deficit of no more than 3.5% of GDP and a target \ndebt\u2013GDP ratio of less than 50%. It also aims to improve the scores from the 2010 Public \nExpenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment, keep underlying inflation at 3%\u2013\n4% annually and the real exchange rate competitive, and improve the enabling environment for \naccess to credit by the private sector. The real annual GDP growth target is 3%\u20134%.  \n \n19.  Despite proactive debt management and a clear fiscal strategy, the small size of the \neconomy relative to the recent economic and climatic shocks has meant that debt-related risk \nhas progressively increased. Since 2009, debt has risen rapidly as a result of more government \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2012. Finding Balance.

The 2013 World Bank\u2013IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis for Samoa finds \nthat sustainability of public external debt is a major risk, as evidenced by the shift in country \nclassification from moderate to high risk of debt distress. Careful monitoring and constant \nvigilance is therefore required to restore debt levels to more manageable territory.  \n \n5.  Investing in Climate Resilience \n20.  Improving climate resilience has important implications for public financial management. \nClimate-proofing infrastructure and homes will increase investment costs, but should reduce the \nbudgetary burden in future years if climatic shocks occur. Stronger climatic resilience will also \nbolster investor confidence, with positive effects on growth and revenues. Flooding caused \nmuch damage during cyclone Evan. The cyclone and flooding destroyed many houses and \ntemporarily displaced 7,500 people. The post-disaster needs assessment recommended that \nnew regulations and procedures be introduced to the development of a town plan, to limit the \nrisk for new houses built in high-risk areas. The government\u2019s home-rebuilding scheme requires \nthat new homes are built to cyclone- and flood-resilience standards.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n21.  The intended impact of the program is to achieve long-term fiscal stability. The impact \nwill be assessed against the achievement of the government\u2019s targets for fiscal deficit and \nexternal public debt. The outcome of the program will be improved fiscal management with a \nspecial  focus  on  climate  resilience.  The  program  will  be  anchored  in  a  macroeconomic \nframework that is agreed on with the IMF and aims to restore long-term fiscal sustainability. \n \nC.  Outputs \n22.  Output 1: Improved state-owned enterprise performance by reforming corporate \ngovernance. SOE reforms have been implemented to improve SOE performances. Under the \nJPAM, the government has steadily reduced the number of public servants and elected officials \non SOE boards to comply with the Public Bodies Act. The government developed an SOE \nperformance framework of key financial indicators and established a reporting mechanism for \nMOF monitoring and to avail reports publicly. One SOE will be privatized, with another in the \npipeline. Lastly, the government will review its privatization policy, taking into account a public\u2013\nprivate partnership framework being developed with World Bank support.  \n \n23.  The program will support three tranche 1 policy conditions: (i) 100% compliance with the \nPublic Bodies Act on board appointments by the 16 SOEs classified as public trading bodies; (ii) \napproval of the SOE performance framework; and (iii) publication of consolidated report on the \nMOF website. Under the second tranche, the program will support: (i) the approval of the \npublic\u2013private  partnership  framework;  and  (ii)  the  review  of  the  government\u2019s  privatization \npolicy, including a time-bound plan for future SOE divestitures. Tranche 2 conditions will be \ncompleted by 31 December 2014. \n \n24.  Output  2:  Improved  public  financial  management  systems.  To  continue \nstrengthening public financial management systems, under the JPAM (i) a PEFA assessment \nwill be undertaken and published; (ii) a public expenditure review will be completed; (iii) a joint \nprocurement  review  will  be  completed  and  a  procurement  reform  implementation  strategy \napproved; (iv) quarterly arrears reports will be prepared and circulated; and (v) an internal audit \nstrategic plan will be implemented.  \n ", "7 \n25.  The  program  focuses  on  strengthening  the  government\u2019s  internal  audit  capacity  to \nimprove budget control, integrity, and public spending. The program initiates implementation of \nthe approved internal audit strategic plan by drafting the workplan and conducting capacity \ndevelopment on risk analysis and performance based audits and tranche 1 policy conditions \nhave been met.   \n \n26.  Output 3: Improved public debt management. The JPAM is anchored on continuing \nmacroeconomic  stability  and  fiscal  discipline  hence  supports  the  achievement  of  (i)  near-\nattainment of the FY2013 aggregate fiscal targets adjusted for post-cyclone estimates; and (ii) \nthe near-attainment of a trend of revenue performance in 3 consecutive fiscal years up to 30 \nJune 2012 of 22.5% of GDP in tax revenues and 3.7% of GDP in nontax revenues. \n \n27.  Given  the  deterioration  in  the  government\u2019s  debt  situation,  it  was  agreed  with  the \ngovernment that the program will focus on debt management and support. The tranche 1 \ncondition comprises the update of the medium-term debt strategy, this was approved by the \ncabinet in June 2013. The strategy reiterates the government\u2019s commitment to targets relating \nto levels of concessionality of new debt taken. The strategy is published on MOF\u2019s website, \nalong with quarterly debt summary reports. As a second tranche condition, the program will help \nimplement the medium-term debt management reform plan, which sets out how to (i) develop \npolicies and processes for issuance of government guarantees and onlending; (ii) consider the \nbest use of concessional budget support lending; and (iii) provide timely information to underpin \ndecision making.  \n \n28.  Output 4: Recovery and resilience to natural disasters. The program supports, as a \ntranche 1 condition, the government\u2019s home-rebuilding scheme on condition that new homes \nwill be built to climate-resilient standards. For tranche 2, the government shall approve the Apia \nTown Plan, which will incorporate guidelines to mitigate the risk of future natural disasters and \ntheir impact on the country\u2019s fiscal situation. The town plan will have to ensure suitable zoning in \nfloodplain areas and disaster risk reduction requirements for new urban construction. As a result \nof these measures, the infrastructure that is reconstructed after  cyclone Evan will be less \nsusceptible to damage from future natural disasters, therefore reducing government\u2019s fiscal risk. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n29.  The government\u2019s development financing needs for FY2014 and FY2015 are estimated \nat  $45  million,  to  be  funded  via  budget  support  from  ADB,  AusAID,  New  Zealand  Aid \nProgramme, and the World Bank.  \n \n30.  The  government  has  requested  a  grant  not  exceeding  $14  million  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Fund to help meet its development financing gap. The grant will be disbursed in \ntwo tranches\u2014$10 million in FY2014 and $4 million in FY2015. The tranche disbursement is in \nline with the government\u2019s request to frontload $10 million to meet a significantly higher deficit in \nFY2014 due to a much larger volume of reconstruction activities. \n \n31.  ADB is basing the size of its grant on the government\u2019s reconstruction and recovery \nfinancing requirements, the fiscal impacts of implementing the JPAM, and the level of budget \nsupport to be provided by other development partners. Implementation of the MTFF will support \npost-cyclone reconstruction and growth in the near-to-medium term before fiscal consolidation \nbrings debt down to sustainable levels. The total fiscal cost for recovery and reconstruction \namounts to $166.90 million (or 24.5% of GDP) during FY2013\u2013FY2015. Of this, 18.8% of GDP \nis accounted for through creation of fiscal space, i.e., expenditure reprioritization (equivalent to \n ", "8  \n7.5% of GDP), donor project support (equivalent to 10.0% of GDP) and insurance payments \n(equivalent  to  1.3%  of  GDP).  Stronger  SOE  performance,  public  financial  management \nsystems, debt management, and climate resilience combined with additional budget support \ngrants could generate fiscal savings of about 5.0%\u20136.0% of GDP over the next 5 years, which \nwould close the financing gap and help achieve fiscal consolidation. Budget support will come \nfrom ADB ($10.00 million in FY2014 and $4.00 million in FY2015), AusAID ($6.00 million and \n$3.82 million), New Zealand Aid Programme ($0.70 million and $0.80 million), and the World \nBank ($15.00 million and $5.00 million).  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n32.  Program management. MOF, as the executing agency, will oversee and coordinate the \ntimely implementation of agreed policy, legal, and regulatory actions. It will also be responsible \nfor achieving policy reforms and policy actions, for program administration, disbursements, \nmaintenance of all program records, and for reporting to the development partners on program \nimplementation progress and policy action achievements. The government, ADB, and other \ndevelopment partners will participate in the annual review of the PFMRP.  \n \n33.  Implementation period and program review. The program is being implemented from \n31 March 2013 to 31 December 2015, consistent with the government\u2019s MTFF. Policy and \noperational changes agreed with the government and set out in the policy matrix have been put \nin  place  from  31 March  2013  to  31 December  2014.  Reviews  will  be  conducted  through \nquarterly meetings between development partners and the government, and annually as part of \nthe PFMRP review every November. Australia and New Zealand, as well as the EU, also \nconduct annual joint assessments of the JPAM prior to disbursements of their budget support. \nThe assessments are shared with other development partners.  \n \n34.  Procurement  and  disbursement.  The  proceeds  of  the  grant  will  be  disbursed  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s simplification of disbursement procedures and related requirements for \npolicy-based grants.14 The proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of items \nproduced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding items included in a list of ineligible \nitems  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.15 Grant  proceeds \ndisbursed against imports will require a certificate from the government stipulating that the value \nof the total imports of Samoa, minus its imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports \nand imports financed under other official development assistance is greater than the amount of \nthe grant expected to be disbursed during a particular year. ADB will have the right to audit the \nuse of the grant proceeds, and to verify the accuracy of the government\u2019s certification. \n \n35.  Tranches. The grant will be provided in two tranches and will become effective once \nADB is satisfied that all conditions for the release of the first tranche, as specified in the policy \nmatrix16 and set out in the grant agreement,17 have been complied with. The second tranche \nshall be disbursed once ADB is satisfied that all conditions for its release, as specified in the \npolicy  matrix,  are  complied  with.  Second-tranche  conditions  should  be  completed  by \n31 December 2014.  \n \n                                                \n14 ADB. 1998.

Counterpart funds. Local currency generated from the grant will be directed to the \ngovernment\u2019s bank account with the Central Bank of Samoa to allow provision of supplementary \nfinancing for the FY2014 and FY2015 budgets. \n \n37.  Program performance monitoring and evaluation. MOF will establish a performance \nevaluation system for the program within 3 months from grant effectiveness and maintain this. \nBecause the impact of the program will be felt beyond the period of its implementation, MOF will \ncontinue monitoring program performance until the end of 2015. The information will be included \nin the program completion report to be provided by the Government of Samoa.  \n  \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n38.  The program\u2019s major benefit will be its contribution to the government\u2019s goal of fiscal \nsustainability with stronger climate resilience. The program will support a continuation of the \ngovernment\u2019s  efforts  to  strengthen  its  public  financial  management  systems  through \naccelerating government reforms and contributing to more robust macroeconomic performance. \nThe program will assist the government in maintaining fiscal stability through improvements to \nSOE performance, public financial management, and debt management, and through climate- \nproofing of infrastructure and homes. This will in turn raise the quality of public spending, \nalleviate the debt overhang, and strengthen Samoa\u2019s resilience to natural disasters.  \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n39.  Once essential reconstruction requirements are met, budget restraint and strengthened \nfiscal  management  will  allow  the  government  to  lower  its  debt  burden  and  reduce  its \nvulnerability  to  fiscal  and  climatic  shocks.  Stronger  fiscal  management  will  also  help  the \ngovernment  achieve  its  external  debt  target  of  50%  of  GDP  by  FY2020,  while  reducing \nvulnerability to climatic shocks. Implementation of SOE governance reforms will help improve \ntheir contribution to GDP as well as their financial performance, which will reduce the drain on \nthe government\u2019s budget (para. 15). \n \nB.  Governance \n40.  The  government\u2019s  ability  to  mount  a  major  reconstruction  effort,  and  thereafter \nconsolidate  public  spending,  is  integral  to  the  success  of  the  program.  The  emphasis  on \nimproving public financial management in the JPAM process demonstrates the government\u2019s \nstrong commitment to managing public spending credibly and effectively, and to restoring fiscal \nsustainability in the medium term.  \n \n41.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to,  and \ndiscussed with, the government and MOF. Relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \nare included in the grant agreement. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n42.  The program is categorized as a general intervention to support sustainable economic \ngrowth and is expected to contribute to poverty reduction indirectly.18 Stronger public financial \nmanagement will contribute to macroeconomic stability, augment aggregate demand, enable \neffective delivery of essential services, and improve the business environment, all of which are \n                                                \n18 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10  \nnecessary for inclusive growth and poverty reduction. Measures taken to strengthen climate \nresilience will improve the capacity of the poor to withstand environmental shocks.  \n \nD.  Safeguards \n43.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program is classified \nas category C for impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.  \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n44.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in the risk assessment and risk \nmanagement  plan.19 Major  risks  include  weak  institutional  and  human  capacity,  a  large \nreconstruction agenda, vulnerability to further climatic and economic shocks, and a changing \npolitical environment leading to limited commitment to reforms. The program is designed to \nmitigate these risks by supporting climate resilience measures and by harmonizing support from \ndevelopment partners in a focused agenda of jointly agreed reforms. To meet skills gaps, \ngovernment staff resources will be supplemented with ongoing TA provided by ADB and other \npartners. Political consensus will be obtained and sustained through government ownership, \nand  leadership  of  the  JPAM  process  and  policy  dialogue  for  budget  support.  Quarterly \nmonitoring of the fiscal situation will enable the government to make necessary adjustments to \nthe budget should unanticipated shocks occur.  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES  \n45.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the grant \nagreement. \n \n46.  The government and the MOF have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nprogram, which are set forth in the grant agreement. The grant will become effective after all \nconditions for the release of the first tranche, as specified in the policy matrix and set out in \nAttachment  2  to  Schedule  2  to  the  grant  agreement,  have  been  complied  with,  to  the \nsatisfaction of ADB. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n47.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based grant would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \ngrant  of  $14,000,000  to  Independent  State  of  Samoa  for  the  Public  Sector  Financial \nManagement  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident  \n30 August 2013 \n                                                \n19 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baseline  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nLong-term fiscal  Government achieves its  Annual budget papers  Government maintains \nstability achieved  medium-term target ratio    its commitment to \n  of public debt to GDP of    medium-term fiscal \n50% by FY2020 (FY2013    strategy and fiscal \nbaseline: 63.5% of GDP)  targets \n   \nSustainable fiscal balance  Reconstruction \nachieved during FY2013\u2013 proceeds in a timely \nFY2016, with fiscal deficit  manner and economy \nreduced to 3.5% of GDP  returns to 2%\u20133% real \n(or less) in FY2016  growth \n(FY2013 baseline: overall   \nfiscal deficit of 6.9%  Risks \nincluding grants)  Further climatic or \n  economic shocks \n   \nTurnover of trained staff \nin the Ministry of \nFinance  \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved fiscal  Improvements in the PEFA  PEFA reports in 2014  Government fulfills its \nmanagement with a  ratings for Samoa to C+    commitment to \nspecial focus on  for (i) composition of  Annual IMF Article IV  improving fiscal stability \nclimate resilience  expenditure, classification  reports \nContinued \nof the budget, timeliness,   \nimplementation of public \nvalue for money and  FY2014 budget \nfinancial management \ncontrols in procurement   \nreform agenda  \nand regularity of accounts \nreconciliation, and   \noversight of aggregate  Risk \nfiscal risk from other public  Staff turnover and loss \nsector entities  of needed public \n(2010 baseline: C); and  financial management \n(ii) multiyear perspectives  skills \nin fiscal planning, \neffectiveness of internal \naudit, and quality and \ntimeliness of annual \nfinancial statements  \n(2010 baseline: D+)  \n \nContinued use of climate \nresilience priorities in the \ngovernment\u2019s FY2015 \npublic investment program \n(baseline: FY2014 budget \nreflects climate resilience \npriorities put forward in the \ncyclone recovery plan) \n \n \n ", "12  Appendix 1 \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baseline  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
