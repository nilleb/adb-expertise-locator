An initial environmental examination was undertaken; \nAssessment  the summary is a core appendix. \n   \nProject Description  The Tsunami Emergency Assistance (Sector) Project (TEAP) will \n(i)  enable  people  to  resume  their  normal  lives  by  supporting \nrestoration  of  livelihoods,  and  essential  services;  and  (ii) \nrehabilitate and reconstruct critical public and community-based \ntransportation, and rural and municipal infrastructure damaged or \ndestroyed. The project design is based on the joint damage and \nneeds assessment undertaken in February 2005 by the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme (UNDP), and World Bank, in the states of Andhra \nPradesh,  Kerala,  and  Tamil  Nadu,  and  the  Union  Territory  of \nPondicherry,  in  close  coordination  and  consultation  with  the \nGovernment of India (the Government), and respective state and \nunion territory governments. The TEAP will focus on support for \nthe  tsunami-affected  states  of  Tamil  Nadu  (the  most  severely \naffected) and Kerala. \n   \nRationale  The devastating tsunami of 26 December 2004 caused loss of life; \nseverely damaged infrastructure and other assets; and disrupted \neconomic activity, output, and services, with attendant losses of \nincome streams in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Based on the joint \nADB-UNDP-World  Bank  damage  and  needs  assessment,  the \ncombined damage to output and income amounted to at least \n$838 million in Tamil Nadu and $126 million in Kerala. The impact \nof this has been particularly acute because the tsunami increased \nthe poverty of already economically vulnerable groups in Tamil \nNadu  and  Kerala  in  terms  of  losses  due  to  reduced  income \nopportunities.  \n \nThe Tamil Nadu and Kerala state budgets for FY2004/05 and \nbeyond will reflect the unanticipated expenditures for relief efforts \nand rehabilitation assistance.  \n ", "ii   \n  The financing needs in Tamil Nadu are estimated at $867 million \nand  in  Kerala  $153  million.  These  exceed  donations  and \nGovernment  assistance.  By  providing  financing  for  the  most \nurgently needed components, complementing the assistance of \nother financiers, the TEAP will enable the Government to help \nrestore  the  livelihood  and  economic  activities  essential  for \nrecovery of the affected areas in the two states. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The TEAP is to support efforts of the Government of Tamil Nadu \n(GOTN)  and  Government  of  Kerala  (GOK),  in  the  tsunami-\naffected areas, to restore the livelihood and economic activity of \npeople  vulnerable  to  poverty,  and  rehabilitate  and  reconstruct \ndamaged  and  destroyed  public  and  community-based \ninfrastructure  in  areas  vulnerable  to  natural  disasters.  The \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  will  be  carried  out  to  a  pre-\ntsunami  level  or  a  higher,  cost-effective,  environmentally \nsustainable standard with design incorporating features critical to \ndisaster prevention. The TEAP will focus on the highest priority \nareas, identified through consultations with GOTN, GOK, public \nand private sectors, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and \nother civil society stakeholders. \n \n  The TEAP will have four components: \n \nPart A: Livelihood  \n   \nRestoration of livelihoods includes (i) restoring the livelihoods of \nthe affected poor and low-income households already organized \ninto self-help groups (SHGs) and other similar groups recognized \nby state governments as affected by the tsunami by providing \nmicroenterprise  training  and  establishment  support,  (ii)  forming \nnew  SHGs  (both  male  and  female  members)  for  affected \nhouseholds  not  yet  organized  in  community-based  groups  to \nrestore  livelihoods  through  microenterprise  training  and \nestablishment support, (iii) replacing productive assets (excluding \nhousing) of tsunami-affected households, (iv) upgrading skills, (v) \nmitigating risk through insurance of all affected households that \nreceive assistance under this component, and (vi) rehabilitating \nand reconstructing community-based infrastructure.  \n \n  Part B: Transportation \n \nRoads  and  Bridges.  This  subcomponent  comprises  (i) \nrehabilitating seriously damaged sections of state roads (other \nthan village and municipal roads) including major district roads, \nother district roads, and state highways in the affected districts of \nTamil Nadu and Kerala\u2014which have suffered breaches, damaged \nshoulders and pavements, and eroded protection works\u2014to pre-\ntsunami level or to prescribed national standards; (ii) rehabilitating ", "  iii\n  damaged drainage structures such as minor bridges, culverts, and \nside drains; (iii) rehabilitating bridges in affected areas; and (iv) \nconstructing  bridge  connections  to  replace  temporary  crossing \narrangements;  unbridged  crossings,  or  for  inoperable  river-\ncrossing ferries as evacuation routes from a disaster prevention \nperspective. \n   \n  Ports  and  Harbors.  Rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  ports \nand  harbors  includes  (i)  dredging  ports,  harbor  basins,  and \napproach channels; (ii) rehabilitating breakwaters for ports and \nfishing  harbors;  (iii)  rehabilitating  fishing  harbor  facilities  like \ncompound  walls;  (iv)  rehabilitating  damaged  roads  and  port \nfacilities like electrification systems, wharfs, and piers; and (v) \nprocuring equipment such as a destroyed dredger and navigation \naids.  \n \n  Part C: Rural and Municipal Infrastructure \n \nWater Supply and Sanitation. This subcomponent includes (i) \nrestoring and upgrading damaged existing water supply systems, \n(ii)  upgrading  affected  water  supply  systems  into  multivillage \nsystems  with  more  reliable  source  development,  (iii) \nrehabilitating/upgrading  sanitary  complex  and  solid  waste \nmanagement  facilities,  and  (iv)  conducting  sanitation  and \nenvironmental awareness campaigns.  \n \n  Other Rural and Municipal Infrastructure. This subcomponent \nincludes  rehabilitating  and  upgrading  (i)  village  and  municipal \nroads; (ii) drainage canals; (iii) public buildings such as small-\nscale common fish-landing, processing, and marketing facilities, \ncommunity centers, and panchayat (local body) offices; and (iv) \ndamaged electricity line network and distribution transformers.  \n \n  Part D: Capacity Building and Implementation Assistance \n \nThis  component  will  support  (i)  detailed  assessment  and \nverification of damage in each sector/subsector; (ii) prioritization of \nsubprojects;  (iii)  preparation  of  subproject  appraisal  reports  in \naccordance  with  Government  and  ADB  requirements  and \nselection criteria; (iv) incorporation of disaster resistance into the \nrapid  planning,  design,  and  implementation  of  the  works;  (v) \nsupervision and monitoring of works to ensure quality control and \ntransparency  among  contractors  and  communities  carrying out \nsmaller  works;  (vi)  technical  and  institutional  support  for \nspecialized  studies  such  as  aquifer  and  hydrology  study,  and \ncommunity  participation;  (vii)  oversight  of  works  in  each \nsector/subsector and provision of detailed accounting, auditing, \nand reporting to the project implementation units (PIUs), project \nmanagement  units  (PMUs),  and  ADB;  and  (viii)  incremental \nadministrative costs. \n   \n ", "iv   \nCost Estimates  The total project cost is estimated at $218.6 million equivalent, \nincluding  taxes  and  duties,  of  which  $63.5  million  (29.1%) \nrepresents  foreign  exchange  costs,  including  $7.0  million  of \ninterest during construction and other charges, and $155.0 million \nequivalent (70.9%) represents local currency costs. \n   \nFinancing Plan   \n($ million)\nSource  Foreign  Local  Total %\nExchange Currency \nAsian Tsunami Fund  11.4 88.6  100.0 45.7\nAsian Development Bank Loan  45.1 54.9  100.0 45.7\nGovernment of India/State \nGovernments  7.0 11.6  18.6 8.5\n  Total  63.5 155.0  218.6 100.0\nS ource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nLoan and Grant Amount  A loan of $100 million from the ordinary capital resources of ADB \nand Terms  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Disaster \nand Emergency Assistance Policy, the loan will have a 32-year \nterm, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate to be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and  such \nother terms and conditions as are set forth in the draft financing \nand project agreements. A grant of $100 million will be provided \nfrom ADB\u2019s Asian Tsunami Fund (ATF) in accordance with the \nATF Paper (R65-05) dated 11 February 2005, and on the basis of \na proposed request for waiver of the pro-rata provisions in para. \n11 of the ATF Paper. The loan and grant will cover the foreign \nexchange cost of $56.5 million and $143.5 million equivalent of \nlocal currency costs. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 October 2008 \n   \nEstimated Project  Until 30 April 2008 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Executing Agency (EA) in Tamil Nadu will be the Revenue \nAdministration Disaster Management and Mitigation Department \n(RADMMD);  and  in  Kerala,  the  Department  of  Disaster \nManagement Department (DDM).  \n   ", "  v\nImplementation  The State Level Steering Committee (SLSC) in Tamil Nadu and \nArrangements  Kerala will act as project steering committees. The SLSC will act \nas a policy making body which will provide overall advice and \nguidance to the EA associated with the Project. In addition, an \nEmpowered  Committee  will  be  established,  chaired  by  the \nrespective  state  chief  secretaries,  that  will  (i)  authorize \ngovernment orders needed for project reconstruction works; and \n(ii) provide for all approvals and sanctions required for the Project, \nincluding  subproject  approvals.  RADMMD  in  Tamil  Nadu  and \nDMD in Kerala will be delegated with all necessary powers to \nundertake their respective responsibilities as EAs. \n \n  DDM and RADMMD will each establish a PMU. The PMUs will be \nresponsible for (i) providing day-to-day assistance and guidance \nto project implementing agencies (IAs); (ii) reviewing subprojects \nto  satisfy  ADB  due  diligence  requirements,  and  approving \nsubproject proposals submitted by line departments and IAs; (iii) \nmanaging and disbursing funds; (iv) consolidating and submitting \nprogress  reports  to  Empowered  Committee  and  ADB;  (v) \ndisbursing  funds  and  accounting  against  a  review  of  financial \nreports provided by the IAs; and (vi) reviewing compliance with \nspecifications  and  plans,  and  quality  control  and  transparency \nrequirements by bodies undertaking reconstruction works. \n \n  The  TEAP  will  have  strengthened  governance  measures, \nincluding  strict  financial  management  and  monitoring, \nperformance auditing, and random spot checks through delegated \nproject administration by ADB\u2019s India Resident Mission operating \nthrough extended mission offices in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. \n \n  An IA will be appointed for each of the key sectors included under \nthe TEAP and will report to its respective PMU. The IAs will have \nPIUs for field monitoring and implementation of subprojects. \n \n  GOTN line departments to act as IAs are (i) Highways Department \nfor  roads  and  bridges;  (ii)  Maritime  Board  for  ports;  (iii) \nDepartment of Fisheries for harbors; (iv) Tamil Nadu Electricity \nBoard for public lighting and damaged distribution lines; (v) Rural \nDevelopment  Department  for  rural  infrastructure,  sanitation,  \nlivelihoods, and concerned municipality for municipal sanitation; \n(vi) Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board and concerned \nmunicipality for water supply; and (vii) Municipal Administration \nDepartment  and  concerned  municipality  for  municipal \ninfrastructure. GOK line departments to act as IAs are (i) Public \nWorks Department for roads and bridges, and rural and municipal \ninfrastructure other than public lighting and power distribution; (ii) \nKerala Water Authority for water supply and sanitation; (iii) Harbor \nEngineering Department for ports and harbors;  (iv)  Kerala  State \n ", "vi   \n  Electricity Board for public lighting and power distribution; and (v) \nFisheries  Department/Kudumbashree  using  the  expertise  of \naccredited  technical  institutions  or  NGO  service  providers  for \nlivelihood. \n   \nThe  IAs  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  prioritizing  and  preparing \nsubproject  technical  proposals  for  sectors  included  under  the \nTEAP; (ii) reporting on the TEAP to RADMMD and DDM; (iii) \nimplementing day-to-day reconstruction works and  activities;  (iv) \n  conducting  detailed  assessments,  surveys,  and  planning  of \nreconstruction,  including  public  consultation  and  input  from \nrecipient local entities and beneficiaries; (v) prioritizing works and \npreparing detailed designs, specifications, schedule of quantity, \nbidding  documents,  contracts,  and  related  documentation;  (vi) \npreparing  regular  progress  reports  for  the  project  steering \ncommittee  and  ADB  through  RADMMD  and  DDM;  and  (vii) \nsupervising  construction,  conducting  quality  control,  approving \nprogress  payments  to  contractors,  and  maintaining  up-to-date \nrecords and accounts for the TEAP and making these available to \nADB and/or auditors for inspection. \n   \nThe Government will establish two imprest accounts (one for loan \nproceeds  and  another  for  grant  proceeds)  operated  by  the \ncomptroller  of  aid  accounts  and  audit.  Initial  deposits  into  the \nimprest  accounts  will  not  exceed  5%  of  the  loan  and  grant \namount. Thereafter, the aggregate drawdown into the two imprest \naccounts will not exceed the lesser of the equivalent of 3 months \nof current project expenditure or 5% of the total loan and grant \namount respectively. The imprest accounts will be operated in \naccordance with the ADB Loan Disbursement Handbook (January \n2001), Interim Guidelines for Disbursement Operations for LIBOR-\nBased Loan Products, and Asian Tsunami Fund. \n \nProcurement  Procurement of goods, services, and works will be carried out in \naccordance with ADB Guidelines for Procurement (2004) and the \ncontemplated  implementation  schedule.  ADB  procedures  for \nproviding  reconstruction  assistance  after  disasters  provide  for \nsubstantial  flexibility  so  that  project  activities  can  be  started \npromptly.  Local  competitive  bidding  procedures  will  be  the \npreferred  mode  of  procurement.  The  local  procurement \nprocedures of the state governments are acceptable, with some \nminor amendments. Prior review by ADB of bidding documents \nand awards will be conducted for procurement under international \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  and  for  the  first  two  (PIU) \ncontracts. In other cases, post-facto approval procedures will be \nfollowed. However, if at a later stage, ADB does not approve the \naward or terms of the contract, the Government may not use the \nloan or grant proceeds, or may need to refund any such loan and \ngrant proceeds used. \n   ", "  vii\nConsulting Services  Consulting services will be required for purposes detailed under \nPart D of the TEAP to assist the IAs and PMUs. The TEAP will \nrequire a total of 645 person-months of domestic consulting as \nindividual  consultants  or  from  consulting  firms  for  Kerala  and \nTamil Nadu. All consultants will be engaged in accordance with \nADB  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. Since the TEAP will be completed within 36 months, \nexpeditious selection and fielding of consultants will be necessary. \nStreamlined  procedures  under  ADB  Assistance  for  Tsunami-\nAffected Developing Member Countries (2005) are applicable. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The TEAP primarily focuses on rehabilitating and reconstructing \nBeneficiaries  damaged or destroyed infrastructure, and restoring livelihoods of \nthose  affected  directly  or  indirectly  by  the  tsunami.  Project \ninterventions will therefore result in restoring productivity of the \ntargeted  assets,  restoring  livelihoods,  creating  productive \nlivelihood  alternatives  for  beneficiaries,  reducing  poverty \nvulnerability  of  newly  vulnerable  groups,  increasing  labor \nopportunities  for  wage-dependent  households,  and  increasing \nphysical security and community bonds for affected households \nthrough disaster-resistant infrastructure. Furthermore, within the \ntargeted sectors, the IAs will need to prioritize rehabilitation and \nreconstruction  interventions  to  maximize  the  returns  from  the \nlimited project resources. In addition, the principle of least cost will \nbe  applied  without  compromising  the  quality  assurance  of  the \nassets created, to ensure maximum utility from resource use.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  To  mitigate  any  lack  of  adequately  strong  commitment  in \nimplementing the TEAP in an efficient and timely manner so that \nthe  livelihood  of  intended  beneficiaries  is  restored  and  the \ntsunami-damaged or destroyed infrastructure is rehabilitated and \nreconstructed, GOTN and GOK will provide high level steering \ncommittees and Empowered Committees which are chaired by \nthe respective state\u2019s chief secretary.  \n \n  Implementation  risks  related  to  capacity  for  timely  delivery  of \nquality subprojects in the various project sectors will be mitigated \nin  several  ways.  First,  in  terms  of  implementation  procedures, \nsubproject  selection  criteria  will  include  general  and  detailed \ncriteria. Second, in terms of implementation mechanisms, specific \nmonitoring mechanisms will include regular financial audits as well \nas regular design and construction supervision, and performance \naudits through random audits and special postcompletion audits. \nTo undertake such supervision  and  performance auditing,  the \nPMUs will draw on adequate consultant support and be supported \nby close monitoring by the ADB extended mission and random \nspot checks during TEAP implementation. \n   \n ", "viii  \n  The national and concerned state governments have a strong \ngovernance framework that will help combat corruption risks with \nattendant  potential  of  leakage  of  funds  and  ensure  that  the \nassistance reaches the intended tsunami victims. These include \n(i)  state  commitment  to  ensure  equitable  and  transparent \ndistribution  of  rehabilitation  assistance,  including  through \npublicizing a computerized list of affected people; (ii) transparency \nin  tender  legislation;  (iii)  transparent  beneficiary  identification \nthrough  community  participation  where  applicable;  (iv)  field \nmonitoring  through  mechanisms  like  district  coordination \ncommittees,  which  will  encompass  consultative  processes  with \npanchayati raj institutions and NGOs; and (v) financial controls \nmechanism  which build on the financial management capacity of \nGOTN and GOK. The India integrity framework will be further \nsupported  by  close  monitoring  through  the  ADB  extended \nmissions, including spot checks. \n   \n   \n ", "ix\n \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nand a proposed grant to India for the Tsunami Emergency Assistance (Sector) Project (TEAP), \nin the states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  The 26 December 2004 Tsunami \n \n2.  The Tsunami. For the first time in half a century, India experienced the devastating \neffects of a tsunami, caused by a series of earthquakes in the Bay of Bengal.1 The first and \nstrongest earthquake was off the west coast of northern Sumatra, Indonesia, at 0629 hours, \nIndian  Standard  Time  on  26  December  2004  (magnitude  and  intensity  9.0  United  States \nGeological Survey [USGS]), followed by one 81 kilometers (km) west of Pulo Kunji, Great \nNicobar, India (7.3 USGS) some 3 hours later. One hundred and fifteen aftershocks were \nreported; the magnitude of 103 tremors was between 5.0 and 6.0 USGS and 12 were over 6.0 \non the Richter scale. The earthquakes set off giant tsunami tidal waves of 3 to 10 meters (m) in \nheight, which hit the southern and eastern coastal areas of India and penetrated inland up to 3 \nkm, causing extensive damage in the Union Territory of the Andaman and Nicobar islands, and \nthe coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu states and the Union Territory \nof Pondicherry. Approximately 2,260 km of the coastal area in addition to the Andaman and \nNicobar islands were affected.  \n \n3.  Human Toll.2 According to Government reports 10,749 people in India died, 5,6403 are \nreported missing, and 6,913 injured. In Tamil Nadu, over 7,983 deaths were reported. Of the 12 \ncoastal districts4 affected in Tamil Nadu, Nagapattinam, where 6,051 people died, was the worst \naffected. Over 824 died in Kanyakumari, and 612 were reported dead in Cuddalore district. In \nKerala, 171 deaths were reported. Of the four affected districts of Alappuzha, Ernakulam, \nKollam, and Kannur in Kerala,5 Kollam accounted for the highest death toll of 131 followed by \nAlappuzha with 35 and Ernakulam with 5. \n \n4.  Relief. Although the Government of India (the Government) and state governments were \ncaught unaware by the tsunami, they responded quickly to launch effective relief operations. As \npart  of  a  coordinated  effort,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)/civil  society  played  an \nimportant role as did the United Nations (UN), with the private sector responding with generous \ndonations of funds and relief material. \n \n5.  Joint Needs Assessment. As part of the process of accelerating the transition from \nrelief to reconstruction, the Government asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB), United \nNations Development Programme (UNDP), and World Bank on 10 January 2005, or soon \nthereafter, to undertake emergency assistance for rehabilitation, reconstruction, and restoration \n                                                 \n1  The last time a tsunami hit the coast of India was in 1945. The other Asian countries affected are Indonesia, \nMaldives, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. Several countries in East Africa were also affected. \n2  This human toll data for Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Pondicherry, and Tamil Nadu is taken from the United Nations \nDisaster Management Team Situation Report, 1 February 2005, which is based on Government reports. \n3  The most recent reports indicate that 2,812 people of the 5,641 reported missing are dead. \n4  The affected districts are listed in the joint assessment mission report of the ADB, UNDP and World Bank. The \nstate government relief response in Tamil Nadu in the aftermath of the tsunami extended to Chennai, Cuddalore, \nKancheepuram, Kannyakumari, Nagapattinam, Pudukkotai, Ramanathapuram, Thanjavur, Thiruvallur, Thothukudi, \nTirunelveli, Tiruvarur, and Viluppuram. \n5  The state government relief response in Kerala in the aftermath of the tsunami extended to Alappuzha, Ernakulam, \nKannur, Kasaragod, Kollam, Kozhikode, Malappuram,Thiruvananthapuram, and Thrissur. ", "2   \nin the aftermath of the tsunami. In consultation with the Government, ADB, UNDP, and World \nBank  formed  a  joint  assessment  mission  (JAM)  team  to  estimate  damage,  losses,  and \nrehabilitation and reconstruction needs in Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Pondicherry, and Tamil \nNadu. The assessment commenced on 1 February 2005 and concluded on 15 February 2005. \nThe JAM report was submitted to the Government on 8 March 2005. Pursuant to that report and \ndiscussions with the Government and other donors, ADB was requested based on comparative \nstrength and engagement of different multilateral institutions, to support restoration of livelihood, \nand rehabilitation and reconstruction of transportation and rural and municipal infrastructure in \nTamil Nadu and Kerala. A copy of the JAM summary report is attached as Appendix 2; a \ndetailed report is available in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nB.   Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n  1.  Sector Damage and Losses \n \n6.  Overview. The JAM assessed the total damage and losses suffered by the states of \nTamil Nadu and Kerala at $964 million. Tamil Nadu was considered to be more severely \naffected with total damage and losses assessed at approximately $838 million; Kerala\u2019s damage \nand losses amounted to approximately $125 million. While the largest proportion of the damage \nwas concentrated in fisheries (approximately 29.78%), housing (11.22%), and infrastructure, \nmaterial private asset damage related to coastal fisheries, agriculture and microenterprises, \nwhose replacement is critical to livelihoods, were included in the various sectors. A sector and \nstate breakdown of damage and losses is in Appendix 2.  \n \n7.  Livelihood. The tsunami has wreaked widespread havoc on the livelihoods of families in \nthe affected areas of Tamil Nadu and Kerala as a result of loss of human life; personal injuries; \ndestruction of houses, property, and assets; and destruction of essential social and transport \ninfrastructure. The livelihoods of about 485,000 families have been directly or indirectly affected \nin Tamil Nadu (400,000 families) and Kerala (85,000). About one third of the affected families in \nTamil Nadu and one half of the affected families in Kerala are directly linked to the fisheries \nsector, about one fourth to microenterprises.  \n \n8.  The tsunami\u2019s human toll, displacement, and damage in terms of critical assets have \nundermined the capacity of affected families to restore their livelihood. The tsunami disaster has \nhit those who were already vulnerable to poverty, and working as informal traders or landless \nlaborers, or engaged in microenterprises. Despite the favorable human development indicators \nof both states, the poverty impact of the tsunami in Tamil Nadu and Kerala is marked because \npoverty levels are disproportionately high among social groups like traditional fishers, marginal \nfarmers, agricultural and urban labor, scheduled castes and tribes, and people in traditional \nindustries like coir, cashew, hand looming, and stone crushing. Poverty among tsunami-affected \ncoastal communities is less visible, geographically interstitial (fragmented and intermittent), and \nsocially differentiated. The coastal poor are socioeconomically and environmentally vulnerable \ndue to low coverage and quality of water and sanitation services, and health and education \ninfrastructure.  Poverty  levels  are  further  compounded  by  the  high  income  seasonality  and \ninformal livelihoods amid climatic variations, and frequent disasters, which compromise the \ncoping ability of coastal communities. Given the multisector livelihood linkages in the coastal \neconomies,  a  large  number  of  informal  microenterprises6  have  been  particularly  adversely \naffected  by  disruptions  in  supplies  and  markets,  loss  of  income-generating  assets  and \nequipment, and losses of shops and trading. \n \n                                                 \n6  Include a broad range of activities requiring small investments primarily in the range of Rs5,000\u2013Rs250,000. ", "    3\n9.  Roads and Bridges. The tsunami-induced damage on roads and bridges of affected \ndistricts is constraining connectivity in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. In 7 of the 12 coastal districts in \nTamil Nadu, and in particular in Cuddalore, Kannyakumari, and Nagappatinam districts, tsunami \ndamage  to  state  roads  has  undermined  the  connectivity  needed  for  the  livelihood  of \ncommunities given that roads and bridges represent the dominant mode of transport.7 Tourism \nand related businesses in the coastal districts have also been affected as roads leading to \nbeaches have been damaged. In Tamil Nadu, two bridge structures in the severely affected \ndistricts of Cuddalore and Kannyakumari were seriously damaged or had collapsed and several \nweaknesses  in  connectivity  were  revealed.  The  tsunami  left  some  of  the  roads  severely \nbreached; berms, shoulders, and protection works eroded; and the road structure exposed. \nPavements were washed away and cross-drainage structures damaged. The impact of the \ntsunami waves was so severe that some bridge structures were damaged due to boats hitting \nthe substructures and decks. \n \n10.  A majority of the tsunami-damaged state roads in Kerala8 provide significant connectivity \nand have a catalytic effect on the livelihood of local community, trade and tourism. In the \ndistricts of Alappuzha, Ernakulam, and Kollam, the narrow major district roads running along the \nsea at an average distance of approximately 50 m from the seacoast suffered severe damage, \nincluding to minor bridges and culverts. A large number of lives were lost due to lack of bridges \nconnecting the main land across the backwaters; this highlights the need to maximize disaster \nprevention resilience in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of such infrastructure facilities.  \n \n11.  Ports and Harbors. Minor ports9 were damaged in Tamil Nadu (i.e., Nagapattinam Port \nlocated  along  the  Kaduvaiyar  River;  and  Cuddalore  Port  located  at  the  confluence  of  the \nGadilam and Paravanar rivers sharing channel with fishing harbors) and in Kerala (i.e., Azhikkal, \nBeypore, Neendakara and Vizhinjam). This has resulted in a loss of crucial port services. \nConsequently,  maritime  cargo  must  be  transported  at  higher  cost  and  loss  of  port-related \nservices such as fuel and water supply and increased unemployment of the labor force due to \nlimited or suspended port operation. The tsunami damage to three fishing harbors in Tamil \nNadu and eight in Kerala, which were damaged or destroyed, has adverse effects on revitalizing \ncoastal livelihoods and maritime safety.  \n \n12.  Water Supply and Sanitation. The limited quantity and quality of water and sanitation \nfrom supply systems was critically compromised by tsunami damage in the form of salinization \nof  wells,  and  destruction  of  pipes  and  sanitation  systems.  Water  supply  and  sanitation \ninfrastructure and related services provided for the tsunami-affected communities in 7 districts of \nTamil Nadu and 3 in Kerala has been affected. In Tamil Nadu this affects a total population of \n329,000 in 6 towns (affected population 68,400) and 74 village panchayats (affected population \n260,600); and in Kerala, a total population of 192,000 in one town (affected population 11,000) \nand 36 village panchayats (affected population 181,000).  \n \n                                                 \n7  The total road length in Tamil Nadu is 151,137 km comprising 60,628 km of primary road network and the \nremaining 90,509 km of panchayat, panchayat union, municipal, forest, Tamil Nadu Electricity Board, and other \nlocal body roads. The primary road network includes 3,865 km of national highways, 7,136 km state highways, \n7,408 km major district roads, 42,219 km other district roads and sugarcane roads. Road transport in the state \naccounts for 80% of freight and passenger trips.  \n8  The total road length in Kerala is 138,196 km comprising 22,991 km of primary road network and the remaining \n115,205 km of panchayat, municipal, forest, irrigation, and other local body roads. The primary road network \nincludes 1,524 km national highways, 3,785 km state highways, 11,711 km major district roads, 5,316 km other \ndistrict roads, and 656 km of other roads. Average road density in Kerala is 3.56 km/square km while the same for \nIndia is 0.91 km/square km. \n9  Major ports are managed by port trusts under the regulation of the Tariff Authority of Major Ports. Minor ports are \nunder state government control. \n ", "4   \n13.  Other  Rural  and  Municipal  Infrastructure.  The  tsunami  critically  damaged  minor \ninfrastructure that provides the basis for community livelihoods, such as village and panchayat \nroads,  including  minor  bridges  and  culverts,  drainage  canals,  and  other  community-based \nfacilities (such as common fish landing, processing, and storage facilities, community centers, \npanchayat buildings, and electricity including public lighting.  \n \n  2.  Impacts of the Tsunami \n \n14.  Fiscal Impact. Despite these tsunami-related damages and losses, the tsunami is not \nexpected to have much impact on India\u2019s gross domestic product or the gross state domestic \nproduct of Tamil Nadu and Kerala.10 Foreign exchange receipts may be marginally impacted to \nthe extent that shrimp exports are hit along with coastal tourism. The states\u2019 gross domestic \nproduct is affected only to a limited extent because economic activities along the coastline \ncontribute  little  to  their  income.  Although  fisheries,  agriculture,  microenterprises,  and  small \nbusinesses have been adversely affected, this will not have any discernible impact on the \nstates\u2019 growth rates as the tsunami impact was localized, and for the states as a whole these \nactivities contribute little to their revenues. However, the tsunami is projected to have a material \nimpact  on  the  state  fiscal  deficits  due  to  additional  expenditures.  The  additional  state \nexpenditures can be divided into two categories: (i) immediate and temporary relief, and (ii) \nshort- and medium-term reconstruction costs over 2\u20133 years.  \n \n15.  For  Tamil  Nadu  and  Kerala,  the  strain  of  tsunami-related  expenditures  and  the \nconsequent impact of higher interest burdens due to increased debt stock is estimated to result \nin a deterioration of the ratio of fiscal deficit to gross state domestic product in fiscal year (FY) \n2004/05 and FY2005/06 in Tamil Nadu and lack of improvement in that ratio in FY2004/05 and \nFY2005/06 in Kerala, as projected in the macroeconomic analysis in Appendix 3. \n \n16.  Interlinked Social and Infrastructure Impact. Although affected communities have \ndemonstrated considerable resilience in terms of emergency response efforts immediately after \nthe tsunami disaster, the livelihood capacity of such already fragile communities has been \nimpaired as a result of deaths, the need to replace assets, and absence of seed capital. In \naddition, due consideration needs to be given in livelihood restoration to the preponderance of \nthose with special vulnerability in the affected communities (women, widows and orphans, \nmarginalized  groups  who  are  physically  or  mentally  challenged,  or  socially  disadvantaged \ngroups due to caste) whose livelihood and income-generating work has been impaired by the \ntsunami. Community mobilization represents a cornerstone of demand-driven local recovery \nefforts and a means of overcoming the income shock of especially vulnerable segments of the \ncommunity such as households headed by women. Consequently, community\u2013based livelihood \nrestoration modalities, such as through self-help group (SHG), will be particularly critical when \ndesigning and implementing post-tsunami reconstruction programs.  \n \n                                                 \n10 The primary sector comprising of agriculture, fisheries and allied activities in the two worst affected districts of \nTamil Nadu, namely Cuddalore and Nagapattinam contribute only 1.02% and 0.69% to the aggregate state \ndomestic product of Tamil Nadu, respectively. Thus, a 2%\u20133% reduction in the growth rate of the primary sector in \nthese two districts will lead to a reduction in the aggregate growth rate of the state by 0.03%\u20130.05% respectively. \nSimilarly, the primary sector of the two worst affected districts in Kerala, namely Alappuzha and Kollam, together \ncontribute only 2.6% to the aggregate state domestic product. Consequently, even a 2%\u20133% reduction in the \ngrowth rate of the primary sector in those two districts will only result in a negligible reduction in the aggregate \ngrowth rate of the state. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) assessment also indicates that the impact of the \ntsunami on national growth is expected to be minor (IMF. 2005. Preliminary Assessment of the Macroeconomic \nImpact of the Tsunami Disaster on Affected Countries and of Associated Needs).  \n ", "    5\n17.  Yet the nature of the tsunami-affected communities in Tamil Nadu and Kerala is such \nthat  they  are  particularly  dependent  for  their  livelihood  on  the  restoration  of  certain \ninfrastructure. Thus the badly affected coastal fisheries communities will be dependent on the \nrestoration of key public infrastructure like ports and fishing harbors. Consequently, the required \nrepairs for ports and fishing harbors, in terms of approximately 8,000 m of compound walls and \nrestoration of breakwaters, and 1,600,000 cubic m of dredging to remove tsunami-inflicted \nsiltation of harbor basins and approach channels in 20 ports, fishing harbors, and landing \nchannels is a critical parallel intervention to restore coastal livelihoods. The importance of the \nrehabilitation of damaged fishing harbors for livelihood restoration is evident from the fact that a \nfishing harbor located on the river, upstream of Nagapattinam port in Tamil Nadu, previously \nhad a fish throughput of 30,000 tons, is currently damaged and largely inoperative. \n \n18.  The  impact  of  the  tsunami  on  other  families  whose  livelihood  is  linked  to  fishing \ncommunities  most  directly  affected  also  needs  to  be  taken  into  account,  including  their \ndependence  on  public  infrastructure  like  rural  roads,  water  supply,  community  toilets,  and \ncommunity buildings. These would also represent opportunities for transitional employment. \nThese are small labor intensive works scattered over a large area and provide valuable rural \nemployment to a segment of tsunami-affected people when it is most needed, i.e., during the \nrecovery process. Being low-skill, low-technology, small-scale works, they sustain the skilled \nand semiskilled local people in the short term. In the long term, such minor infrastructure will \nrestore their livelihood by creating employment opportunities for local people by rebuilding \nproductive and supportive resources for coastal industries, as well as employment for operation \nand maintenance of such minor infrastructure. Consequently, there is a critical need to (i) \ncontribute to restoring and rebuilding the livelihood of the affected communities, by rehabilitating \nessential  minor  village  and  municipal  infrastructure;  (ii)  specifically  contribute  to  reducing \ntransportation time and resources for goods and services, in particular, fishery and associated \nproducts;  and  (iii)  provide  improved  drainage  and  public  facilities  with  disaster  resistant \nstandards for rehabilitation of public buildings and improved practices in community participation \nwhere necessary for project planning and implementation to lead to enhanced operation and \nmaintenance, while delivering essential employment opportunities to the affected communities. \n \n19.  In addition, for sustainable revival of livelihood, in the following are urgently needed (i) \nprovide improved drinking water supplies in terms of quality and quantity at least to the level of \nor beyond pre-tsunami conditions given same standard pre-tsunami replacement costs and \nlocal post-tsunami upgrade requirements; (ii) contribute to reducing time and resources for \nproviding  or  collecting  water,  and  for  maintaining  existing  poorly  performing  systems;  (iii) \ncontribute to protecting public health from potential waterborne diseases, and reducing pressure \non the fragile coastal aquifer and natural environment; and (iv) provide institutional support for \nimproved practices in community participation in project planning and implementation, and \nsound  technical  design  and  quality  control,  along  with  increased  involvement  of  local \ngovernment institutions and beneficiaries in operation and maintenance of completed schemes. \n    \n20.  Consequently, recovery from the impacts of the tsunami for Tamil Nadu and Kerala \ncoastal  communities  requires  simultaneous  restoration  of  livelihood,  and  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction  of  physical  infrastructure.  While  community-based  microenterprise  initiatives, \nsuch as through SHGs, enhance economic capacity, restoring damaged community and public \ninfrastructure  is  equally  critical  if  livelihood  restoration  is  to  successfully  occur.  Certain \ninfrastructure may be community built, owned, and managed, such as those related to tsunami-\ndamaged water bodies, and other infrastructure may require more inputs in the nature of public \nworks  but both  represent  an  integral  part  of  critical infrastructure  rehabilitation  support  for \nlivelihood restoration. \n \n ", "6   \n21.  Environmental Impact. The tsunami has affected the natural environment in several \nways with consequences for production systems. Salinization of groundwater and fresh water \nsystems  has  affected  coastal  communities  whose  daily  water  requirement  and  livelihoods \ndepend on these systems. The impact has been particularly severe on the poor who have no \naccess to piped water supply schemes. Around 8,000 hectare (ha) of agricultural lands are \naffected by siltation and salinization. Around 2,500 ha of shelterbelt, mangroves, and teak \nplantations were damaged in Tamil Nadu alone. Fishery stocks that depend on mangroves and \ncoastal wetlands for spawning are likely to be affected; however the impact on fishery stocks at \nlarge is not clear. Consequently, a combination of livelihood restoration interventions that revive \nfish production systems and public infrastructure interventions that provide water quality and \ncontainment of ports-related environmental damage is urgently required to address the varied \nenvironmental impacts.  \n \n22.  Disaster  Risk  Management  Policy  and  Institutional  Framework.  Although  the \nGovernment undertook effective relief efforts, the magnitude of the tsunami impact has led to a \nparticular focus on a systematic approach to disaster risk management that goes beyond relief \nand aims to reduce the vulnerability of the country to disaster risk in the future. In response to \nthe historical-scale disasters experienced by the country in recent years, such as cyclone \n(Orissa in 1999), earthquake (Gujarat in 2001), floods (Ganges-Brahmaputra in 1998 and 2004), \nand  the  recent  tsunami,  the  Government  is  progressively  strengthening  its  policy  and \ninstitutional framework to manage the risk against a range of natural disasters. The recently \nprepared  and  comprehensive  national  disaster  management  framework  provides  strategic \nguidelines for institutional mechanisms, disaster prevention, early warning systems, mitigation, \npreparedness and response, and human resource development. To formalize the framework, \nthe Government is now finalizing a national disaster management authority policy and bill, which \naim at promoting and operating a disaster risk management strategy to reduce the country\u2019s \nvulnerability to such risk. Establishment of a similar state policy, bill, and authority are also \nenvisaged.11  \n  \n23.  The Government is participating in regional efforts to establish an effective tsunami \nwarning system, to be integrated with the existing national system of cyclone forecasting and \nwarning.  In  addition,  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  is  implementing  the  Disaster  Risk \nManagement Program with multidonor support to (i) set up national, state, and district centers \nfor multihazard emergency operations; (ii) establish district, block, and village plans for disaster \nmanagement;  (iii)  undertake  disaster  management  and  mitigation  awareness;  (iv)  support \ndisaster-resistant  technologies;  and  (v)  promote  legal  and  policy  frameworks  for  disaster \nmanagement and systems to ensure their compliance. This provides a platform for development \nin Tamil Nadu and Kerala for (i) local and community-based capacity building at all levels, \nlinking the development of early warning through public awareness and communication to the \nuse of evacuation infrastructure; and (ii) improving the resilience of public and private structures \nagainst multihazard risks. The inclusion of disaster resilience standards for reconstruction of \ninfrastructure is a particularly crucial requirement in a multihazard context, as the affected states \nare prone to a range of hazards that occur with much greater frequency than tsunamis.  \n \n  3.  Donor Coordination \n \n24.  Donor Coordination on State and Sectoral Allocations. The magnitude and multitude \nof the tsunami impacts has generated the need for the proposed ADB emergency assistance, \nwhich will complement the contributions of other donors. On 22 February 2005, following the \n                                                 \n11  The Government of Tamil Nadu has drafted a state disaster management policy and established the State Disaster \nManagement Authority. The Government of Kerala has also drafted a bill for disaster management.  ", "    7\nJAM, the Government held joint discussions with ADB, UN, and World Bank to establish an in-\nprinciple understanding of state and sector allocations between the multilateral institutions. \nBearing in mind respective resource envelopes and comparative expertise, the group agreed \nthat (i) ADB would focus principally on livelihood restoration, transportation, and rural and \nmunicipal infrastructure in Tamil Nadu and Kerala; (ii) the World Bank would be principally \nassigned sectors like housing, fisheries, and agriculture; and (iii) the UN would principally focus \non disaster risk management. \n \n25.  Development  Partners\u2019  Response  to  Rehabilitation  and  Reconstruction  Needs. \nThe UN system\u2019s assistance, as coordinated by UNDP, is expected to be $38.6 million for areas \nsuch as psychosocial support; health and nutrition; education; rebuilding livelihoods;12 water \nsupply, sanitation, and hygiene; and information technology and communications.  \n \n26.  The World Bank is currently preparing its emergency post-tsunami support with the \nGovernment, with Board approval expected in May 2005. The assistance is expected in the \nform of approximately $460 million of International Development Association credit, of which the \nmajority will come from loan cancellations and savings. The World Bank also expects to provide \na grant of $2.5 million.  \n \n  4.   Lessons Learned \n \n27.  Lessons Learned in Disaster Response. The tsunami impact issues that constrain the \nrecovery of affected states confirm the importance of lessons drawn from previous experience \nof ADB emergency assistance and ADB policies. ADB disaster emergency assistance to India in \nthe aftermath of the Gujarat earthquake provides some India-related lessons. Although this is \nonly the fifth project developed under the ADB Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (May \n2004),13 some general lessons can be learned from the past experience with postdisaster loans \nto other developing member countries.  \n \n28.  The lessons learned are (i) prepare projects as quickly as possible; (ii) focus projects on \nrestoring  livelihood,  and  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  key  facilities;  (iii)  complete \nreconstruction works to the extent possible within 2\u20133 years; (iv) provide strong implementation \nassistance and ADB supervision as implementation will place a heavy burden on executing \nagency (EA) staff; (v) ensure the government can take quick action to match ADB\u2019s rapid \nresponse  to  disasters;  (vi)  because  beneficiary  participation  is  key,  increase  the  role  of \nbeneficiaries in project preparation, implementation, and maintenance of facilities; (vii) consider \nenvironment and social aspects during project implementation, even though the need for a rapid \nresponse  may  not  permit  detailed  examination  of  these  issues  prior  to  approval  of  the \nassistance; (viii) provide arrangements for disbursements, including retroactive financing and \nthe use of imprest accounts, to give EAs quick and simple access to funds; (ix) carefully define \nproject  objectives  and  scope;  (x)  ensure  criteria  for  subproject  selection  permit  simple \n                                                 \n12  In addition livelihood activity in areas not covered by ADB would be supported by the International Fund for \nAgricultural Development  which is due to provide approximately $30 million in additional funding.  \n13  ADB. 2004.

ADB\u2019s Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Strategy. Since the Gujarat earthquake \nemergency assistance, ADB strategy has been to support the national and state governments \nand other stakeholders to overcome exogeneous shocks caused by calamities. This is to enable \nearly restoration of economic and social activity in affected areas, especially for the poor. The \nstrategy is designed to ensure that emergency assistance projects provide a bridging function to \nameliorate the impacts of the disaster and dovetail into the development process selecting the \nhighest priority needs for emergency assistance in consultation with the Government, state \ngovernments, civil society, and other stakeholders, including other donors.  \n \n30.  Based on the JAM report (para. 5), the TEAP identifies specific sectors in particular \naffected states. The TEAP therefore seeks to (i) build on the immediate relief provided in the \ntsunami-affected states by Government and development partners; (ii) contribute to coordinated \nrehabilitation and reconstruction in sectors by different development partners guided by the JAM \nreport and the Government; (iii) specifically address sustainable recovery priorities by way of \nsupport for direct livelihood restoration complemented by indirect livelihood support through \npublic infrastructure rehabilitation and reconstruction, which generates public employment and \nunderpins the restoration of livelihood activities by providing roads, public buildings and lighting, \nsanitation,  and  the  like;  (iv)  support  disaster  prevention  by  linking  national  and  regional \ndevelopment of rapid early warning systems through community-based public awareness to \ncore public infrastructure such as key bridges, which provide for evacuation; and (v) provide a \nplatform through short- and medium-term reconstruction for longer term development of disaster \nprevention  such  as  coastal  erosion  projects.15  In  doing  so,  TEAP  design  draws  on  ADB \nexperience  in  delivering  emergency  assistance  acquired  in  different  developing  member \ncountries  over  the  past  2  decades,  and  complements  relief  and  other  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction  assistance  provided  by  the  Government,  UN  agencies,  NGOs,  bilateral \ndevelopment partners, and the World Bank. By meeting the tsunami reconstruction needs of the \nnext 3 years, the TEAP is consistent with ADB Policy on Disaster and Emergency Assistance \n2004 and the Asian Tsunami Fund (ATF) Paper 2005.16 The TEAP also provides a platform \nconsistent with longer term development plans of the Government in the 10th Five-Year Plan \n(2002\u20132007)  as  reflected  in  the  ADB  country  strategy  and  program  for  India,  the \nrecommendations of the Twelfth Finance Commission as adopted by the Government in 2005, \nand state development plans.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n31.  The  TEAP  will  support  efforts  of  the  Government  of  Tamil  Nadu  (GOTN)  and \nGovernment of Kerala (GOK) to (i) restore the livelihood and economic activities of the affected \npopulation, (ii) accelerate poverty alleviation in the tsunami-affected areas who are vulnerable to \nhigh incidence of poverty, and (iii) rehabilitate and reconstruct public and community-based \ninfrastructure that are vulnerable to natural disasters.  \n                                                 \n14  ADB. 2004.

Considering that the urgent need in Tamil Nadu and Kerala to \nrestore connections and to build disaster resilience and prevention is key for transportation \ninfrastructure, this subcomponent will comprise (i) rehabilitating tsunami\u2013damaged sections of \nstate roads (other than village and municipal roads), such as major district roads, other district \nroads, and state highways in the affected districts of Tamil Nadu and Kerala\u2014which have \nsuffered breaches, damaged shoulders and pavements, and eroded protection works\u2014to pre-\ntsunami  level  or  to  prescribed  national  standards;21  (ii)  rehabilitating  damaged  drainage \nstructures such as minor bridges, culverts, and side drains; (iii) rehabilitating bridges in affected \nareas  (for  Cuddalore  and  Kannyakumari  districts  of  Tamil  Nadu);  and  (iv)  creating  bridge \nconnections to replace temporary crossing arrangements, for unbridged crossings or for river \ncrossing ferries from a disaster prevention perspective (Appendix 5). \n \n35.  Ports and Harbors. Given the consequences for fishing communities as a result of \ndamage to harbors and minor ports, the ports and harbors subcomponent includes (i) providing \npriority dredging for ports, harbor basins, and approach channels; (ii) rehabilitating breakwaters \nfor ports and fishing harbors; (iii) rehabilitating fishing harbor facilities such as compound walls; \n(iv) rehabilitating damaged roads and ports facilities, such as electrification systems, wharfs, \n                                                 \n17 The scope excludes sector issues relating to fisheries, agriculture, and livelihoods including their asset replacement \nexpected to be funded from other sources. Livelihood restoration relating to these segments (SHG formation, skills \ndevelopment, and microenterprise establishment support) is covered in view of the inextricable linkages in the \ncostal economies as well as the need for coordinated implementation for cost-efficient service delivery.  \n18  Establishment support includes provision of seed capital to SHGs. \n19 Skills development intervention is kept generic to ensure participation of community groups as well as individuals. \nThis could include fisheries and allied activities undertaken by poor and low-income households. \n20  At this stage, insurance products covered by Swarnajayanthi Grama Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY) are envisaged. \nHowever, any innovative schemes will also be available for ADB support. \n21  Rehabilitation will also entail regular road safety audits to ensure that road rehabilitation is accompanied by due \nregard to road safety. \n ", "10   \nand  piers; and  (v)  procuring  equipment  such as  a  destroyed  dredger  and  navigation  aids \n(Appendix 6). \n \n3.  Part C: Rural and Municipal Infrastructure  \n \n36.  Water Supply and Sanitation. Given the serious effects of the tsunami on water supply \nand public hygiene, this subcomponent will include (i) restoring and upgrading damaged water \nsupply systems,22 (ii) upgrading affected water supply systems into multivillage systems with \nmore  reliable  source  development,  (iii)  rehabilitating/upgrading  sanitary  complex  and  solid \nwaste  management  facilities,  and  (iv)  providing  a  sanitation  and  environmental  awareness \ncampaign23 (Appendix 7). \n \n37.  Other  Rural  and  Municipal  Infrastructure.  Given  the  importance  to  community \nlivelihoods of tsunami-damaged minor village and municipal infrastructure, this subcomponent \nwill include rehabilitating and upgrading (i) village and municipal roads; (ii) drainage canals; (iii) \npublic buildings such as small-scale common fish-landing, processing, and marketing facilities; \ncommunity  centers;  and  panchayat  offices;  and  (iv)  damaged  electricity  line  network  and \ndistribution  transformers.  Rehabilitation  of  public  buildings  will  consider  disaster-resistant \ndesign, and relocation to safer environment as appropriate (Appendix 8). \n \n4.  Part D: Capacity Building and Implementation Assistance \n \n38.  Given  the  tight  implementation  schedule  and  the  incremental  burdens  on  EAs  and \nimplementing agencies (IAs), additional technical support will be needed. Under the PMU\u2019s \ndirection,  this  component  will  therefore  support  (i)  detailed  assessment  and  verification  of \ndamage in each sector/subsector; (ii) prioritization of subprojects; (iii) preparation of subproject \nappraisal reports in accordance with Government and ADB requirements and selection criteria; \n(iv) incorporation of disaster resistance into the rapid planning, design, and implementation of \nthe works; (v) supervision and monitoring of works to ensure quality control and transparency \namong contractors and communities carrying out smaller works; (vi) institutional support for \naquifer and hydrology study and community participation; and (vii) oversight of works in each \nsector/subsector and provision of detailed accounting, auditing, and reporting to the project \nimplementation units (PIUs), and project management units (PMUs). Given incremental burdens \non the EAs and IAs, this component will also support incremental administration costs, on \nconveyance,  furniture,  communication  and  equipment,  but  not  including  salaries  and \nallowances. \n \nC.  Special Features \n39.  Integrated Restoration of Livelihoods and Infrastructure. The TEAP will seek a grant \nfrom the ATF (footnote 15), established to pool and channel emergency grant financing for \ntsunami-related  rehabilitation  activities,  in  proportionate  combination  to  a  loan  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources (OCR). This provides a mixed loan-term commensurate with the \nneeds of the tsunami-affected coastal communities, which were already poor and vulnerable to \nexternal shocks, to mitigate their substantial losses and return them to a higher growth path \nthrough an integrated approach. Specifically, this enables the delivery of an effective recovery \npackage, comprising the most appropriate mix of restoring livelihood through direct support to \n                                                 \n22  This includes provision of tankers for regular supply given water shortages. \n23  The TEAP will link with the Government\u2019s total sanitation program to implement this activity, institutionalized \nfollowing the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) TA. The existing program will be extended in the concerned \nsubproject area, using projects funds as necessary.  ", "    11\nSHGs and replacement of assets, restoration of essential water supply and sanitation services \nfor  critical  drinking  water  and  hygiene  for  vulnerable  communities,  and  reconstruction  of \ncommunity and other productive infrastructure, thereby accelerating the recovery process.  \n \n40.  Donor Collaboration. Building on the JAM report, the TEAP design takes into account \nproposed  interventions  by  the  UN  and  World  Bank  in  other  sectors.  Such  a  collaborative \napproach  will  maximize  resources,  provide  a  synergy  of  skills,  and  facilitate  harmonized \nimplementation with other donors. Input from NGOs is integral given the TEAP\u2019s thrust to \nestablish livelihoods and community-based infrastructure. \n \n41.  Implementation Flexibility and Delegation. Given the community-based substance of \nmany of the TEAP components, project design also focuses on expeditious implementation \narrangements according to the ADB Disaster and Emergency Policy 2004, and the ATF, in \nterms  of  procurement  and  consulting  services.  This  is  complemented  by  supervision  and \nmonitoring by and delegation to an ADB extended mission with offices in Tamil Nadu and \nKerala, and by community-based and field\u2013level dispute resolution mechanisms such as village \nand district level monitoring committees.24\n \n42.  Quality Control with Effective Process and Output Management. While the TEAP \naims to restore the community livelihood and supporting infrastructure in a most expeditious \nmanner,  it  will  also  operate  effective  results-based  management  within  its  implementation \nframework. Specifically, each subproject proposal, prepared in consultation with the concerned \nlocal  government  institutions  and  beneficiaries,  will  set  out  specific  process  and  output \nindicators. Implementation progress will be recorded and reported through the IAs\u2019 field offices, \nand monitored and audited by PMU consultants. Information will also be reported to the village \nand district level monitoring committees. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n43.  The total project cost is estimated at $218.6 million equivalent, including taxes and \nduties, of which $63.5 million (29.1%) represents foreign exchange costs, including $7.0 million \nof  interest  during  construction  and  other  charges,  and  $155.0  million  equivalent  (70.9%) \nrepresents local currency costs (Table 1, details in Appendix 9). \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \n       \n  Tamil Nadu  Kerala  Total Cost \nComponent  FX  Local Total FX  Local Total  FX  Local Total\nComponent A: Livelihoods  0.1 49.9 50.0 0.1 8.8 8.9    0.2  58.7 58.8\nComponent B: Transportation  9.1 17.7 26.8 11.1 12.8 23.9  20.2  30.5 50.7\nComponent C: Rural and Municipal \nInfrastructure  25.9 37.9 63.8 10.3 11.3 21.6  36.2  49.1 85.3\nComponent D: Capacity Building \nand Implementation Assistance  0.0 3.2 3.2 0.0 2.0 2.0  0.0  5.2 5.2\nLand Acquisition, Rehabilitation, \nand Resettlement  0.0 0.4 0.4 0.0 0.4 0.4  0.0  0.8 0.8\n                                                 \n24  In Tamil Nadu and Kerala, village level committees function as first information and grievance redress tier whose \nwork will be facilitated by NGOs.

Financing Plan  \n \n44.  The Government has requested a loan of $100 million from ADB\u2019s OCR and a grant of \n$100 million from the ATF to help finance the TEAP. The loan will have a 32-year term including \na grace period of 8 years,25 an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per \nannum,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  financing  and  project \nagreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The proposed ADB grant to the Government is for $100 \nmillion from the ATF (footnote 16).  \n \n45.  The ADB loan and grant will cover $56.5 million of the foreign exchange cost and $143.5 \nmillion of local currency cost. The Government will cover the foreign exchange cost of $7.0 \nmillion for interest and commitment charges, and the foreign exchange risk for the TEAP. The \nnational and state governments will bear the local currency cost of $11.6 million equivalent for \ntaxes and duties, land acquisition, rehabilitation, and resettlement (Table 2).  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n       \n  Foreign  Local   \nSource  Exchange Currency Total  %\nAsian Tsunami Fund Grant  11.4 88.6 100.0  45.7\nAsian Development Bank Loan  45.1 54.9 100.0  45.7\nGovernment of India/State Governments  7.0 11.6 18.6  8.5\n  Total  63.5 155.0 218.6  100.0\nNote: The figures beyond the decimal point may not add up due to rounding. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n46.  State Allocations. Tamil Nadu will be allocated $143.75 million. Kerala will be allocated \n$56.25 million. Corresponding to the TEAP financing plan, the components to be financed by \ngrant and by OCR have been identified according to the Government\u2019s preference for the use of \n                                                 \n25  This is being recommended as an outer limit under ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy 2004, \nparagraph 90. ", "    13\ngrant and loans for tsunami-related reconstruction. Accordingly, the grants are assigned to Part \nA  (livelihoods)  and  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  subcomponent  under  Part  C.  Grant \nassistance will facilitate restoration of livelihoods of affected households and critical drinking \nwater  and  sanitation  systems  with  associated  support  for  public  hygiene  and  health  for \nvulnerable affected communities required for expeditious and sustained livelihood restoration. \nPart  D  on  capacity  building  and  implementation  assistance  (other  than  incremental \nadministration) will also be grant funded. The complementary and integrated nature of these \ncomponents aims to accrue benefits to the poor and low-income households. Considering the \nvarying  pattern  of  tsunami-related  damage  in  Tamil  Nadu  and  Kerala,  the  sector-based \napplication of grant funds implies differential allocations. Details are provided in Appendix 9. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management  \n \n47.  Planning Commission Core Group. After the tsunami, the Government established a \nmulti-disciplinary core group within the Planning Commission to plan and coordinate the post-\ntsunami rehabilitation and reconstruction program in the affected states and union territories. \nThis core group, headed by a chief coordinator, will consist of an office of the chief coordinator \nand program management consultants. The core group will function as an interdepartmental \ncoordination  mechanism  for  collecting  data  on  damages,  losses,  and  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction  needs  and  outlays  for  all  tsunami-affected  areas  in  India.  As  part  of  the \nestablishment  of  a  medium\u2013term  recovery  and  reconstruction  framework  going  forward  a \nNational  Disaster  Management  Framework  has  been  established  by  the  Ministry  of  Home \nAffairs of the Government.  \n \n48.  Project Steering Committees. GOTN and GOK will establish a State Level Steering \nCommittee in the respective states. The SLSC will act as a policy making body which will \nprovide  overall  advice  and  guidance  to  the  state  EAs  associated  with  the  Project.  An \nEmpowered Committee of Tamil Nadu and Kerala will be established and will be chaired by the \nrespective state\u2019s chief secretary and will (i) provide policy guidance to the PMUs; and (ii) \nsanction and approval of subprojects and project approvals.  \n \n49.  Executing  Agencies.  RADMMD,  the  EA  in  Tamil  Nadu  and  DDM  in  Kerala,  will \nrespectively  ensure  that  it  engages  adequate  permanent  or  fixed-term  required  staff  to \nimplement the TEAP.  The EAs will be delegated with all necessary powers to undertake \nresponsibilities as EAs. RADMMD and DDM will respectively establish a PMU, headed by a \nproject director and supported by a team of consultants specialized in project management, \ntechnical  aspects,  and  environmental  and  social  issues  as  required.  The  PMU  will  be \nresponsible for (i) providing day-to-day assistance and guidance to the project IAs; (ii) reviewing \nsubprojects to satisfy ADB\u2019s due diligence requirements and approving subproject proposals \nsubmitted by line departments and IAs; (iii) managing and disbursing funds; (iv) consolidating \nand submitting progress reports to the Empowered Committee and ADB; (v) disbursing funds \nand accounting against a review of financial reports provided by the IAs; and (vi) reviewing \ncompliance with specifications and plans, and quality control and transparency requirements by \nbodies undertaking reconstruction works.  \n \n50.  Implementing Agencies. The concerned GOTN line departments will act as IAs: (i) \nHighways Department for the roads and bridges; (ii) Maritime Board for ports; (iii) Department of \nFisheries  for  harbors;  (iv)  Tamil  Nadu  Electricity  Board  for  public  lighting  and  damaged \ndistribution  lines;  (v)  Rural  Development  Department  and  concerned  municipality  for  rural \n ", "14   \ninfrastructure, sanitation, and the livelihood component;26 (vi) Tamil Nadu Water Supply and \nDrainage  Board  and  concerned  municipality  for  water  supply;  and  (vii)  Municipal  and \nAdministration Department and concerned municipality for municipal infrastructure. For Kerala, \nthe concerned line departments to act as IAs are (i) Public Works Department for roads and \nbridges,  and  other  rural  and  municipal  infrastructure  other  than  public  lighting  and  power \ndistribution;  (ii)  Kerala  Water  Authority  for  water  supply  and  sanitation;  (iii)  Ports/Harbor \nEngineering Department for ports and harbors; (iv) Kerala State Electricity Board for public \nlighting and power distribution; and (v) Fisheries Department/Kudumbashree using the expertise \nof  accredited  technical  institutions,  NGO  service  providers  or  specialized  agencies  for  the \nlivelihood component. The IAs will have PIUs for subproject monitoring and implementation of \nsubprojects. Details on the PIUs are in the sector-specific appendixes. \n \n51.  The IAs are responsible for (i) prioritizing and preparing subproject technical proposals \nfor the sectors included under the TEAP; (ii) reporting to RADMMD and DDM; (iii) implementing \nreconstruction works and activities; (iv) conducting detailed assessments, surveys, and planning \nof  reconstruction  including  public  consultation  and  input  from  recipient  local  entities  and \nbeneficiaries as required; (v) prioritizing works, and preparing detailed designs, specifications, \nschedule of quantity, bidding documents, contracts, and related documentation; (vi) preparing \nregular  progress  reports  for  the  SLSC  and  ADB  through  RADMMD  and  DDM;  and  (vii) \nsupervising  construction,  conducting  quality  control,  approving  progress  payments  to \ncontractors, and maintaining records and accounts on an up-to-date basis and making these \navailable to ADB, its missions, or auditors for inspection. The project organization structures for \nTamil Nadu and Kerala are in Appendix 10.  \n \n52.  ADB Extended Mission. To ensure timely implementation, the responsibility for project \nadministration will be delegated to India Resident Mission in New Delhi. ADB will also establish \nan extended mission with two extended mission offices; one in Chennai and the other in \nThiruvananthapuram27 for the duration of project implementation to closely monitor compliance \nwith  ADB  requirements.  The  extended  mission  offices  will  ensure  quality  control,  speedy \nimplementation of subprojects, and rapid assistance to RADMMD and DDM and IAs on any \nproject implementation matters. They will carry out random spot checks on procurement and \nproject accounts of subprojects, and inspect project facilities for quality control and proper \nfinancial management. The extended mission offices will be headed by India Resident Mission \nstaff under the direct supervision of the resident mission.  \n \n2.  Subproject Selection Criteria and Approval \n53.  The IAs will formulate and propose a list of subprojects through the PMUs. The PMUs \nwill conduct initial screening of the proposals and submit these to the Empowered Committee in \nTamil Nadu and Kerala for final selection and approval in accordance with general selection \ncriteria for purposes of eligibility and sector-specific criteria for each project component. The \ngeneral eligibility and sector-specific criteria are listed in Appendix 11. \n \n54.  The first two subprojects to be carried out by each IA will be subject to prior review and \napproval by ADB before commencement. Any subsequent subproject exceeding $500,000 but \nless than $3 million will be sent to the PMU and ADB for information only, while subprojects \nexceeding $3 million equivalent will require prior review and approval by ADB. Subprojects \nestimated to cost $500,000 equivalent or less will be subject to approval by the respective PMU \n                                                 \n26 The department may use the services of accredited technical institutions and NGO service providers. \n27 Chennai is the administrative capital of Tamil Nadu. Thiruvananthapuram is the administrative capital of Kerala. ", "    15\nand random audit and checks by ADB to ensure compliance with requirements of subproject \nselection criteria and implementation arrangement.  \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n \n55.  As the TEAP is for emergency assistance, implementation will start immediately after \napproval  and  be  completed  within  36  months.28  A  detailed  implementation  schedule  is  in \nAppendix 12.  \n \n4.  Procurement  \n \n56.  Procurement of goods, services, and works will be carried out in accordance with ADB \nGuidelines  for  Procurement  (2004)  and  the  contemplated  implementation  schedule.  ADB\u2019s \nprocedure for providing reconstruction assistance after disasters allows for flexibility so that \nproject activities can start promptly. Local competitive bidding procedures will be the preferred \nmode  of  procurement.  The  local  procurement  procedures  of  the  state  governments  are \nacceptable, with some minor amendments such as ADB\u2019s disapproval of disclosure of the \nbudget for the package and invitation of bids on a percentage rate basis.  \n \n57.  Procurement of goods and related services estimated at more than $1,000,000 will be \nprocured  following  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.  International  shopping \nprocedures will be followed for procurement of goods and related services estimated at between \n$100,000 and $1,000,000. For small, specialized equipment and materials contracts valued less \nthan $100,000, direct procurement procedures acceptable to ADB will be followed.  \n \n58.   Civil works contracts over $10 million will be procured through international competitive \nbidding,  and  those  estimated  to  cost  $10 million  or  less  will  be  procured  through  local \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Postqualification  with  single-  or  two-\nenvelope procedures and usage of the existing contractor registration system is acceptable. \nADB  will  conduct  prior  review  of  bidding  documents  and  award  recommendations  for  all \npackages estimated to cost $1,000,000 and above. For contracts estimated to cost less than \n$1,000,000, ADB will review and approve the first two contracts for each IA. Once ADB is \nsatisfied with the EA\u2019s procurement procedures, post-facto approval procedures will be followed. \nHowever, at a later stage, if ADB determines that its guidelines were not followed, ADB may not \napprove the award or terms of the contract and the Government cannot use loan or grant \nproceeds to finance the contract. If the loan or grant proceeds are already used to finance such \ncontracts at the time of such determination, the Government will refund to ADB any such \nexpenditure  incurred.  Rebidding  and  extension  of  bid  validity  will  be  subject  to  ADB  prior \napproval.  Community  participation  in  procurement  of  small  works  of  a  simple  nature  is \nencouraged.29 \n                                                 \n28  Given the implementation challenges in certain sectors, a 36-month implementation schedule under the ADB \nDisaster and Emergency Assistance Policy is considered appropriate. \n29  To encourage community participation and use of indigenous materials, methods to incorporate community \nparticipation in procurement may be used for rural and municipal infrastructure. Small works contract with an \nestimated cost of $20,000 or less in each case may be awarded to community organizations in accordance with \npractices and procedures acceptable to ADB. \n ", "16   \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n \n59.  The TEAP will require a total of 645 person-months of domestic consulting.30 The outline \nterms of reference for the consultants are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n60.  All consultants31 will be engaged in accordance with ADB Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. The consulting services will be provided through quality- and cost-based selection \nof  one  or  more  consulting  firms  using  simplified  technical  proposals  or  through  individual \nconsultants. Since the TEAP will be completed within 36 months, selection and fielding of \nconsultants must be expeditious. Streamlined procedures for consultant recruitment under ADB \nAssistance for Tsunami-Affected Developing Member Countries (15 February 2005) will apply. \n \n6.  Advance Action \n \n61.  Given the urgency of the TEAP, advance action was approved for the procurement of \ngoods, services, and civil works, and recruitment of consultants. The Government has been \nadvised that ADB\u2019s approval of such advance action does not commit ADB to finance the TEAP.  \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements  \n \n62.  In  accordance  with  the  ADB  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy,  quick \ndisbursement is key to effective and timely emergency assistance. Given the emergency nature \nof the Project and the financial management in both Tamil Nadu and Kerala,32 the disbursement \narrangements of the state governments are considered appropriate. Immediately after the loan \nand grant are effective, the Government will establish two imprest accounts (one for loan \nproceeds and one for grant proceeds) operated by the comptroller of aid accounts and audit. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  imprest  advance  will  be  released  to  the  EAs  when  requested  as \nreimbursement of the expenditure already incurred under the project.  \n \n63.  The initial deposits into each of the imprest accounts will not exceed 5% of the loan and \ngrant amount. This amount will be disbursed to the SGIAs: $7 million for the Tamil Nadu \naccount and $3 million for Kerala. Thereafter the aggregate drawdowns into the two imprest \naccounts will not exceed the lesser of the equivalent of 3 months of current project expenditures \nor 5% of the total loan and grant amount for the respective imprest accounts, and will be \nestimated based on actual disbursements expected under contracts over the upcoming months. \nProcedures under ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook dated January 2001, as amended from \ntime to time, and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the Government and ADB, \nincluding the statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure, will be adopted for reimbursing and \nliquidating eligible expenditures. Any individual payment which is to be reimbursed or liquidated \nunder the SOE procedure should not exceed $100,000 per payment, except as ADB may \notherwise agree during project implementation. The imprest accounts will be operated by the \ncomptroller  of  aid  accounts  and  audit,  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (January 2001) and Interim Guidelines for Disbursement Operations for LIBOR-\nBased Loan Products. \n                                                 \n30  Tamil Nadu is allocated 227 person-months and Kerala 418 person-months. These will be provided by consulting \nservices contracts for each state. \n31  Consultant activity will be under part D of the TEAP. \n32  The World Bank has undertaken a financial management assessment for Tamil Nadu; financial management  \nrelated reforms in Kerala have been supported under ADB\u2019s Modernizing Government and Fiscal Reform in Kerala \nProgram dated 27 November 2002. ", "    17\n \n64.  As agreed in donor coordination discussions guided by the Government, ADB has been \nrequested to provide a resource envelope of $200 million, comprising $100 million of ATF grants \nand a $100 million OCR loan, for tsunami emergency assistance in the two states across three \nsectors. Some parts of these sectors were considered to be more suitable for grant financing, \nwhereas others were considered to be more appropriate for OCR financing. All of this has \nresulted in technical and operational complexities under the proposed TEAP which could not \nhave been anticipated at the time the ATF Paper was considered by the Board in February \n2005. Thus, project components identified for ATF grant financing would be expected to move \nat  a  different  implementation  speed  than  those  Project  components  identified  for  OCR \nfinancing.33 For example, infrastructure components financed by OCR will require competitive \nbidding  procedures  which  would  impose  their  own  timelines.  This  would  make  pro  rata \ndrawdowns  impractical  and  untenable  for  purposes  of  implementation  of  the  Project. \nConsequently, a waiver of the pro rata provisions of paragraph 11 of the ATF Paper is required. \nHowever, while the technical form of the pro rata drawdown provision in paragraph 11 of the \nATF Paper cannot be met by the Project\u2019s component wise disbursement pattern34 and waiver \nof that provision is therefore necessary for the effective implementation of the Project, the \nsubstantive intent of a blended facility for India through the ATF is satisfied by the Government\u2019s \nassurance and state governments\u2019 commitment to fully utilize the entire resource envelope of \nOCR and grant resources for the Project. Such intent is underpinned by the magnitude of the \ndemand for tsunami rehabilitation and reconstruction for the states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala35 \nwhich exceeds expenditure available through domestic financing, and by the priority accorded \nby Government to rehabilitation and reconstruction of infrastructure which has been specifically \nidentified for ADB\u2019s OCR financing. \n \n65.  The Government has agreed that the state governments will receive the loan and grant \nproceeds on a back-to-back basis as of 1 April 2005 (in line with recommendations of the 12th \nFinance Commission of India), and that the IAs will receive the ADB financing proceeds as \ngrants from GOTN and GOK for all the components. The IAs will be required to maintain \nsubproject accounts for each component to reflect the use of loan and grant proceeds.  \n \n8.  Retroactive Financing \n \n66.  ADB has agreed to the provision of retroactive financing of up to 20% of Loan and Grant \nproceeds, provided that expenditures are incurred in accordance with agreed procedures. The \nprovision of retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n  a.  Reports  \n \n67.  RADMMD and DDM will establish a reporting system for quarterly progress reports on \nperformance monitoring, issues resolution, and action plans. These will serve as management \nfeedback to update and improve procedures, and provide the basis for a quarterly report to \nADB. A consolidated annual report on subprojects financed will be submitted by ADB to the \nBoard. The action plans will incorporate quantitative and time-bound implementation targets and \nbudget requirements. The action plans will be approved by the, IAs, PMUs, and ADB. Within 3 \n                                                 \n33  See paragraph 46 of the RRP. \n34  Supplementary Appendix C provides details on indicative disbursement schedules for grant\u2013financed and OCR\u2013\nfinanced Project components. \n35  See paragraph 6 and Appendix 2, Table A2.2. \n ", "18   \nmonths  of  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  GOTN  and  GOK  will  provide  ADB,  through \nRADMMD and DDM, with an overall project completion report providing detailed evaluation of \nproject design, costs, contractor and consultant performance, social and economic impact, and \nother details requested by ADB. \n \n68.  Regular field review will be carried out by the staff from ADB\u2019s extended mission offices \nin conjunction with the PMUs to monitor physical progress of subprojects and compliance with \nother  ADB  requirements  such  as  procurement,  quality  control,  accounting,  beneficiary \nparticipation,  and  NGO  consultation  as  applicable.  A  midterm  review,  to  be  conducted  in \nSeptember 2006, will assess the need for changes needed in the implementation arrangements \nto achieve overall project objectives. \n \nb.  Accounts and Audit \n \n69.  The Government will maintain separate records and accounts for the Loan and Grant \nImprest Accounts. The state governments operating through their respective PMUs and PIUs \nwill  establish  and  maintain  separate  records  for  subprojects,  works,  goods,  and  services \nfinanced out of loan and grant proceeds. They will also maintain separate project accounts in \naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles for all expenditures incurred on the \nTEAP and subprojects, both from loan and grant proceeds. \n  \n70.  Detailed consolidated annual project accounts, as maintained by the PMUs, will be \naudited by independent auditors whose qualifications, experience, and terms of reference are \nacceptable to ADB and will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the end of the fiscal year. \nThe  annual  audit  report  will  include  the  audit  of  the  imprest  accounts,  and  statement  of \nexpenditure procedure, and will specifically include a separate audit opinion on the use of loan \nand  grant  proceeds  through  the  imprest  accounts,  and  compliance  with  statement  of \nexpenditure  procedures.  RADMMD  and  DDM  have  been  made  aware  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \ndelayed submission, and requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited \naccounts.  \n \n71.  In addition to financial audits, the PMUs will monitor quality of delivery of assistance to \nbeneficiaries, through performance audits36 focusing on governance, financial accountability, \nand transparency done on a random basis and postcompletion audits. \n \nc.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n  \n72.  The  PMUs  will  carry  out  the  necessary  arrangement  for  a  systematic  project \nperformance monitoring system. A set of performance monitoring indicators to be collected \nduring implementation will be identified, and baseline data established for each of the selected \nindicators.  Appendix  4  sets  out  sector-specific  performance  indicators  for  the  livelihood \ncomponent. The project performance monitoring system will include performance monitoring \nindicators needed for preparing ensuing projects in water supply and sanitation, rural and \nmunicipal infrastructure, and transport rehabilitation and reconstruction.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n36 Performance audits are a systematic examination of management systems and procedures to facilitate economy, \nefficiency, and effectiveness in using resources and strengthening good governance. They include assessment of \naccounting, internal control systems, and compliance with process standards for timely payments. ", "    19\nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Social and Livelihood Impacts \n \n73.  Rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  essential  rural  and  municipal  infrastructure  will \nmitigate  the  short-  and  medium-term  increases  in  the  incidence  and  severity  of  poverty. \nRestored water supply and improved sanitation coverage will reduce the chronic water poverty \nand vulnerability37 levels among the perennially water-stressed coastal communities. The TEAP \nwill reduce morbidity from potential waterborne diseases and improve the environmental quality \nand public health in the coastal districts. It will reduce the burden of collection and storage of \nwater, and accrue improved health, health care, and productivity benefits to the communities. \nThe  educational  activities  will  increase  awareness  of  water  conservation,  water  quality, \nsanitation,  and  hygiene  issues  among  the  coastal  communities.  Rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction of the village and panchayat and municipal roads will improve local access to \nessential  services,  and  support  local  livelihoods  through  labor  opportunities  during  the \nimplementation.  \n \n74.  The livelihoods component will restore incomes, upgrade skills, and improve productivity \nand  livelihood  options  among  the  fishing,  farming,  wage  labor,  and  local  microenterprise \nsectors,  especially  focusing  on  coastal  women  and  other  internally  displaced  and  newly \nvulnerable social groups. Risk mitigation measures, such as insurance and targeted social \ntransfers, will reduce the vulnerability of the newly created vulnerable groups (widows, orphans, \nsick, and disabled).  \n \n75.  Transport connectivity will enable the affected population to resume their social and \neconomic activities, and access essential social, emergency, and other government welfare and \nrelief services. This will also support livelihood restoration by facilitating improved physical \naccess to local fishing and commodities markets, wage labor, and other alternative livelihood \nopportunities. An immediate benefit for wage-dependent households will be in terms of labor \nopportunities in construction work. Access to evacuation routes, emergency relief measures, \nand disaster shelters will increase a sense of physical security among the people. Increased \nfamilial and community interaction will reduce the vulnerability of affected households, and \nprovide a sense of social security. Improvements in maritime infrastructure will protect fishing \nvessels, restore flow of goods and access to markets, and improve people\u2019s income coming \nfrom  fishing  and  port  operations.  Benefits  will  also  accrue  in  terms  of  improved  disaster \nmitigation capacity and improved safety in maritime transport and fishing. These, along with \ndisaster-resistant rehabilitation of public buildings, will support improved productivity and quality \nof life. Restored transport connectivity will also stimulate investments in microenterprises and \npublic infrastructure.  \n \n76.  Finally,  the  TEAP  will  result  in  increased  community  participation  during  project \nimplementation,  especially  given  the  social  mobilization  through  livelihood  and  community \ninfrastructure components. It will rebuild the damaged social capital and community networks in \nproject areas, and reduce the vulnerability of affected communities to livelihood shocks and \nnatural disasters. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is attached in Appendix 13.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n37 Water supply in coastal areas suffers from low per capita supply and high content of fluoride, sodium, and iron, with \nshallow wells facing high levels of salinity in dry seasons. \n ", "20   \nB.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n \n77.  In both states, land acquisition and resettlement impacts are envisaged. In Tamil Nadu, \nthe bridge in Kannyakumari, if it cannot be rebuilt on the original alignment, will have to be \nrealigned. In Kerala, the construction of three emergency evacuation bridges in Allapuzha and \nKollam districts might require land acquisition and cause resettlement impacts. For all project \ncomponents, most rehabilitation work will be carried out within the original right-of-way, while \nupgrading them to current engineering standards might require the acquisition of narrow strips \nof land. For the rehabilitation of rural and municipal infrastructure, power transmission lines, \nports  and  harbors,  and  street  lighting,  no  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  impacts  are \nenvisaged. Rehabilitation and construction of new public buildings such as community centers, \npanchayat  offices  and  anganwadi  centers  might  require  small-scale  land  acquisition,  if \ngovernment  land  is  not  available  for  such  buildings  at  suitable  locations.  Resettlement \nframeworks for Tamil Nadu and Kerala (Appendixes 14 and 15) have been formulated to \nprovide guidance in preparing resettlement plans, if required for any project component. They \noutline  the  policy  and  legal  framework,  procedures,  and  institutional  requirements  for \nresettlement during project implementation. If any unanticipated impacts are identified during \nproject implementation, appropriate entitlements will be incorporated in resettlement plans to \nensure they are adequately addressed. \n \nC.  Indigenous People  \n \n78.  The proportion of the tribal population is significantly lower, both in Tamil Nadu (1%) and \nKerala (0.44%), than the national average of 8%. The tribal population is concentrated mostly \nalong the hilly areas in both states, which were not affected by the tsunami. The schedule tribe \nhouseholds in the coastal areas in both states earn their livelihoods primarily through wage \nearning as agricultural labor and are involved in allied agricultural activities. They are also active \nmembers in SHGs supported by ongoing government programs. With regard to the provision of \nemergency assistance to tsunami-affected people, the TEAP ensures that all benefits will be \nprovided on an equitable basis, with no differential impact on scheduled tribe households. While \nscheduled tribe populations are among those affected, the initial needs assessment did not \nidentify any likely adverse effects arising from their status. The TEAP will have no impacts on \ntheir tribal or cultural identity, or on their social and economic institutions. However, if any \nimpacts are identified during TEAP implementation, such impacts will be addressed through \nspecific actions to be formulated according to the approved resettlement frameworks.  \n \nD.  Environmental Impacts \n \n79.  The  TEAP  primarily  aims  to  rehabilitate  and  reconstruct  infrastructure  damaged  or \ndestroyed by the tsunami and to restore livelihoods of affected people. The environmental \nimpacts of these activities will be largely limited to the construction phase since the structures \nalready exist. Given the scale of individual subprojects, these impacts are not likely to be \nsignificant.  In  the  long  term,  infrastructure  that  is  upgraded  will  result  in  certain  positive \nenvironmental impacts due to improved designs and facilities. The TEAP will also support the \nexpansion of certain existing facilities and construction of some new structures. These activities \nare considered to be small- to medium-scale works and are not considered likely to create \nsignificant environmental impacts. Therefore, the TEAP is classified as category B in terms of \noverall environmental impact. \n \n80.  The  TEAP  is  considered  sector-like  in  that  detailed  subproject  designs  will  be \nundertaken during implementation. Consequently, the detailed environmental assessments of \nsubprojects can also be conducted only during implementation. Therefore, an environmental ", "    21\nassessment and review procedure framework was prepared to outline specific environmental \nassessment and monitoring procedures that must be adopted when preparing and implementing \nsubprojects.  These  procedures  are  described  in  Supplementary  Appendix  D  and  are \nsummarized in the summary initial environmental examination report (Appendix 16). The initial \nenvironmental examination is provided in Supplementary Appendix E. Each subproject will \ninitially be subject to a rapid environmental assessment, based on which the appropriate follow-\non assessment requirements will be determined. Given the nature and scale of subprojects, \nthey  are  unlikely  to  require  a  more  detailed  assessment  than  an  initial  environmental \nexamination, However, as an added precaution, the environmental assessment and review \nprocedure framework does cover the procedures to be followed in the event that a subproject \nrequires an environmental impact assessment.  \n \nE.  Overall Project Benefits  \n \n81.  The TEAP primarily focuses on rehabilitating and reconstructing damaged or destroyed \ninfrastructure, and restoring livelihoods of those affected by the tsunami. Project interventions \nwill therefore result in restoring productivity of the targeted assets, restoring livelihoods, creating \nproductive  livelihood  alternatives  for  beneficiaries,  reducing  poverty  vulnerability  of  newly \nvulnerable  groups,  increasing  labor  opportunities  for  wage-dependent  households,  and \nincreasing physical security and community bonds for affected households through disaster-\nresistant infrastructure. Furthermore, within the targeted sectors, the IAs will need to prioritize \nrehabilitation and reconstruction interventions to maximize the returns from the limited project \nresources. In addition, the principle of least cost will be applied without compromising the quality \nassurance of the assets created, to ensure maximum utility from resource use.  \n \nF.  Risks \n82.  To mitigate any lack of adequately strong commitment in implementing the TEAP in an \nefficient and timely manner, so that the livelihood of intended beneficiaries is resolved and the \ntsunami-damaged or -destroyed infrastructure is rehabilitated and reconstructed, GOTN and \nGOK have both committed to provide a high level state steering committee and an Empowered \nCommittee which is chaired by the respective state\u2019s chief secretary for Project monitoring and \napprovals. \n \n83.  Implementation risks related to capacity for timely delivery of quality subprojects in the \nvarious project sectors will be mitigated in several ways. First, in terms of implementation \nprocedures, detailed subproject criteria will be developed in addition to general subproject \nselection  criteria.  Second,  in  terms  of  implementation  mechanisms,  specific  monitoring \nmechanisms will include regular financial audits as well as regular design and construction \nsupervision and performance audits through random audits and special postcompletion audits. \nTo  undertake  such  supervision  and  performance  auditing,  RADMMD  and  DDM  will  be \nsupported by dedicated PMUs and specialized consulting inputs.38 \n \n84.  The  national  and  state  governments  (GOTN  and  GOK)  have  a  strong  governance \nframework that will help combat corruption risks with attendant potential of leakage of funds and \nensure that the assistance reaches the intended victims of the tsunami. These include (i) state \nto  ensure  equitable  and  transparent  distribution  of  rehabilitation,  including  by  publishing  a \ncomputerized list of affected people; (ii) transparency in tender legislation;39 (iii) transparent \n                                                 \n38  RADMMD in Tamil Nadu, for example, intends to employ an experienced outside auditing consultant as chief \naccounts officer for tsunami-related projects. \n39 For example, Tamil Nadu\u2019s Transparency in Tenders Act 1998, and Transparency in Tenders Rules 2000. \n ", "22   \nbeneficiary  identification  through  community  participation;40  (iv)  field  monitoring  through \nmechanisms  like  district  committees,  which  will  encompass  consultative  processes  with \npanchayati raj institutions and NGOs; and (v) financial control mechanisms will build on the \nfinancial management capacity of GOTN41 and GOK.42 The robust Indian integrity framework \nwill be further supported by close monitoring by ADB extended mission offices, which will \nundertake random spot checks during TEAP implementation. \n \nV.   ASSURANCES \n \n85.  In addition to the standard assurances, the national Government, GOTN, and GOK have \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n86.  Implementation Arrangements. GOTN and GOK will set up the SLSCs, Empowered \nCommittees, PMUs (including the project directors) and PIUs within not more than 1 month from \nproject effectiveness.  \n \n87.  GOTN and GOK will delegate RADMMD and DDM and the respective IAs with all \nnecessary powers, and provide them with adequate competent and qualified personnel for \neffective execution of the Project.  \n \n88.  GOTN  and  GOK  will  ensure  that  all  subprojects  follow  the  agreed  processing  and \nselection  criteria  and  implementation  arrangements,  and  that  all  subprojects  are  properly \nmonitored as agreed with ADB. Any subproject that does not follow such agreed requirements \nwill not be eligible for ADB financing under the Project. \n \n89.  Social and Environmental Safeguards. GOTN and GOK will ensure that the Project, \nincluding the subprojects, is undertaken in compliance with applicable national and state laws, \nincluding  Coastal  Regulation  Zone  requirements  and  ADB  Environment  Policy,  2002.  As \napplicable, subprojects will be prepared in accordance with requirements of the environmental \nassessment and review procedure framework as agreed with ADB, including any revisions \nrequired on account of detailed designs. Subprojects that do not satisfy the selection criteria \nunder the environmental assessment and review procedure framework will not be included \nunder  the  Project,  and  for  those  that  require  an  initial  environmental  examination,  the \nexamination and related environment management and monitoring plan will be prepared for \nfurther design and implementation. All applicable national and state clearances will be obtained \nfor the subproject prior to award of contracts under the subproject. In the exceptional cases of \nsubprojects  that  require  an  environmental  impact  assessment,  the  environmental  impact \nassessment  will  be  prepared  according  to  the  procedures  specified  in  the  Environmental \nAssessment and Review Procedures Framework and approved by GOTN and GOK and ADB \nprior to approval of the subproject. \n \n90.  Land acquisition and resettlement under the Project will be (i) minimized and limited to \nunencumbered public lands to the extent possible that is not squatted upon and (ii) carried out \nin  accordance  with  applicable  national  and  state  laws,  and  ADB  Policy  on  Involuntary \n                                                 \n40  For example, Kudumbashree has a series of indicators for identifying poor beneficiaries related to land, housing, \nand the like.   \n41  The World Bank assessed the financial management capacity of GOTN as part of its tsunami emergency \nassistance, which is due to be considered by the World Bank\u2019s Board of Directors in April 2005.  \n42  The financial management capacity of GOK has been strengthened as a result of ADB\u2019s 2002 Modernizing \nGovernment and Fiscal Reform in Kerala Program. See ADB. 2005. Modernizing Government and Fiscal Reform in \nKerala Program Loan 1974-IND: Progress Report\u2013Release of Second Tranche and Major Change in Scope. \nManila (R80-05, 2 March 2005).", "    23\nResettlement, 1995. Any subproject involving resettlement under the ADB policy will require \npreparation and implementation of a resettlement plan in accordance with the resettlement \nframework as agreed with ADB. Such resettlement plan (including any revisions on account of \ndetailed designs) will be subject to ADB approval prior to award of civil works contract under the \nsubproject.  \n \n91.  In  case  of  impacts  to  indigenous  peoples  (including  scheduled  tribes)  under  any \nsubproject, the requirements of the ADB Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Policy, 1998 will be followed, \nincluding preparation of specific actions as set out in the resettlement frameworks as agreed \nwith ADB.  \n \n92.   Participation. GOTN and GOK will ensure that RADMMD, DDM, and the IAs seek the \nparticipation of government and nongovernment organizations and communities, particularly \nwomen,  in  the  selection,  design,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction of rural infrastructure and other activities under the livelihood components under \nthe project. Community based dispute resolution mechanisms will be established to address \ndisputes if any under the project, including between people in the tsunami\u2013affected areas. The \nNGOs and communities will maintain proper records and information about their activities and \nuse of funds under the project and will be subject to audit by the respective EA for the state. \n \n93.  GOTN and GOK will ensure that installments of assistance (including cash) provided to \nSHGs  and  individual  beneficiaries  under  livelihoods  will  be  against  suitable  identification, \nrecords, verifications and certifications; and ensure that all SHGs and beneficiaries assisted \nunder the Project comprise overall 50% women and 3% disabled. \n \n94.  GOTN and GOK, through RADMMD and DDM, will undertake periodic reviews (with due \nparticipation  of  NGOs  and  community-based  organizations)  to  evaluate  the  scope, \nimplementation arrangements, benefit monitoring in accordance with the project performance \nmonitoring system, and progress and achievement of the project objectives. \n \n95.  Disbursements,  Accounts,  and  Audit.  The  Government  will  upon  receipt  of  the \nadvances from ADB into the two imprest accounts, ensure immediate and full transfers of such \nadvances to GOTN and GOK as and when requested. \n \n96.  GOTN and GOK will ensure that proper accounting and audit procedures are in place to \nensure efficient and economic use of the ADB financing proceeds. Accounts and financial \nstatements in relation to the Project and the subprojects will be maintained and certified by \nindependent auditors acceptable to ADB. RADMMD and DDM, through GOTN and GOK, will \nprovide such accounts and financial statements to ADB on a quarterly basis within 45 days of \nthe  close  of  each  such  quarter.  The  independent  auditor  will  assist  the  operations  of  the \nproject\u2019s  financial  management  systems  in  each  state,  including  review  of  internal  control \nmechanisms and prompt identification of problems, timely corrective actions and systematic \nrecommendations for enhanced accountability and transparency. \n \n97.  The Government, GOTN, and GOK will allow ADB representatives to carry out spot or \nrandom checks on the flow of funds through the imprest accounts.  \n \n98.  The Government, GOTN, and GOK will allow independent auditors acceptable to ADB to \nundertake performance audits on a random basis and post completion audits. \n \n99.  Quality Control. GOTN and GOK will ensure that the rehabilitation and reconstruction \nof affected infrastructure under the project includes strengthened seismic, high wind (cyclone), \n ", "24   \nstorm surges, earthquake, tsunami and flood resistance provisions as feasible, and road safety \naudits to be undertaken for roads rehabilitated or reconstructed as well as monitor and ensure \nquality control of materials used in rehabilitation and reconstruction under the project. \n \n100.   ADB Extended Mission. The provisions of the Agreement between the Government of \nIndia  and  ADB  regarding  the  Resident  Office  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  dated  18 \nNovember 1992 will apply to the ADB extended mission offices in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, to be \noperative for the duration of project implementation. \n \n101.  The Government, GOTN, and GOK will, as required, extend full cooperation to the ADB \nextended mission offices in Tamil Nadu and Kerala in their activities, particularly in monitoring \nand random and spot checks on the procurement and accounts of the Project and subprojects \nand inspection of the project facilities for quality control.  \n \nVI.

At the request of the Government of India, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), United \nNations,  and  World  Bank  put  together  a  joint  assessment  mission  (JAM)  to  assess  the \nsocioeconomic and environmental impacts of the 26 December 2004 tsunami in the states of \nAndhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu and the Union Territory of Pondicherry. As advised by \nthe Government, the JAM did not include assessment of the impact and losses sustained in the \nUnion Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. \n \n2.  A group of experts and specialists from different sectors and disciplines analyzed the \ndamage and losses as well as the needs expressed by the relevant state authorities and Union \nTerritory administration, made field visits to the most affected districts, and undertook\u2014on a \nsample basis\u2014consultations with local experts, members of civil society, and nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs). The damage and losses presented (Table A2.1) reflect the available \ninformation compiled during the JAM (1\u201315 February 2005). This is not a final assessment since \na number of surveys and specialist sector analyses are ongoing.  \n \nTable A2.1: Summary of Damages and Losses  \n($ million) \n \n  Damage and losses  Effects on \nItem  Damage  Losses  Total  Livelihoods \nAndhra Pradesh  31.82  16.68  48.50  35.58 \nKerala  68.17  57.62  125.79  82.55 \nTamil Nadu  510.62  327.70  838.32  332.80 \nPondicherry  48.18  8.20  56.38  30.44 \n              \nTotal (by sector)  658.79  410.20  1,068.99  481.37 \nHousing  193.49  35.19  228.68   \nHealth and Education  13.68  9.98  23.66    \nAgriculture and Livestock  15.13  22.39  37.52  42.05 \nFisheries  320.06  304.24  624.30  383.16 \nMicroenterprises and Other  19.72  36.45  56.17  56.16 \nRural and Municipal Infrastructure  27.99  1.63  29.62    \nTransportation  35.15  0.32  35.47    \nCoastal Protection  33.56  0.00  33.56    \nReliefa    200.69  200.69    \na  Relief provided by the local, state, and national governments. \nSources: Mission estimates on the basis of information made available by the governments and direct observation. \n \n3.  Overall damage is estimated to be approximately $660 million and losses are estimated \nto be approximately $410 million. While the largest proportion of the damage is concentrated in \nfisheries, housing and infrastructure, material private asset damages related to coastal fisheries, \nagriculture, and microenterprises have been incorporated into the respective sectors. Losses \nrelated to livelihoods in these sectors are of particular significance because they accentuate the \nexisting  vulnerability  to  poverty  of  the  coastal  fisheries  communities,  agriculture,  and \nmicroenterpises.  \n \n4.  These  quantifications  of  damage  and  losses  neither  supersede  nor  disregard \nassessments of damage and needs made locally. They present a consolidated view, on the \nbasis  of  relevant  information  received  and  the  expertise  of  the  multi-institutional  and \ninterdisciplinary JAM team. These lead to certain observations on damages and losses suffered: ", "Appendix 2  31 \n \n \n(i)  The disaster is having a significant impact on the states\u2019 livelihoods (about 38% \nof the total damage and losses imposes negative consequences on livelihoods) in \nthe coastal environment and the local economy. In particular, this report provides \na measure of the economic impact of the tsunami on the fisheries sector and \nrelated  livelihood  in  coastal  communities  of  the  affected  states  and  Union \nTerritory of Pondicherry. The report attempts to highlight some social issues \nrelevant for the reconstruction process, in the context of the states\u2019 and national \ndevelopment strategies. \n \n(ii)  At  this  juncture,  the  affected  areas  have  already  moved  from  relief  to \nreconstruction\u2014although for some sectors and groups of affected people relief \nwill still continue for several months. During this transition, the protection of the \nmost vulnerable segments of the displaced population and the improvement of \ntheir living conditions in temporary shelters over the coming months deserves \nspecial attention. \n \n(iii)  The JAM recommends that national and state authorities pursue a risk mitigating \nreconstruction process in the face of damage resulting from specific recurrent \nhazards that the tsunami has just put in clearer perspective: Disaster is a wake \nup call to face vulnerability and better manage risk. \n \n(iv)  The need for such a risk-mitigating reconstruction process reduces vulnerability in \nthe medium term; increases resilience to specific local multihazards; and inserts \nitself in the larger district, state, and national development strategies: Disaster is \nan opportunity to upscale and accelerate the development process.  \n \n(v)  Given the damage to housing and infrastructure, the provision of permanent \nsolutions to housing and restoration of infrastructure are an immediate priority \nand require commitment of resources that may not be delayed. Investment in \nthese and location of the new infrastructure (in terms of relocation of housing, \nrestoration,  or  construction  of  urban  and  rural  infrastructure  and  resilience-\nincreasing measures such as locally adapted and environmentally sound coastal \nprotection) are tied to overarching policy decisions in terms of appropriate coastal \nregulation and risk management, some of which have significant costs and social \nand financial implications in the districts and states affected. \n \n(vi)  The impact of the disaster varies from state to state both in absolute terms and in \nterms of the relative weight it has on each of the local economies. \n \n5.  The needs (Table A2.2) reflect the short-term (within 1 year) and medium-term (up to 3 \nyears) requirements. This table does not include longer term reconstruction needs which are \nsignificant in areas such as housing, rural and municipal infrastructure, transportation, and \ncoastal protection. Assessment of long-term needs can only be reliably undertaken after further \ndetailed studies.

Overall rehabilitation and reconstruction needs are estimated at $1.2 billion, over the \nshort- to medium-term. The estimates take into account that damaged assets need to be \nreplaced  with  new  ones,  not  only  of  equal  value,  but  with  upgrades  to  services  and \ninfrastructure in order to reduce the previous inherent vulnerability. \n \n7.  The tsunami has highlighted underlying vulnerabilities to recurrent hazards and the \nmajor  negative  social  consequences  of  such  disasters  on  the  livelihood  of  groups  of  the \npopulation already in the lower levels of the development process. Its consequences for the \nlivelihood of the worst affected productive sectors (fisheries and, to a lesser extent, agriculture) \nspill over to the livelihood of the rest of the community, beyond the actually physically affected \nareas. \n \n8.  The systemic analysis undertaken highlights the cross-cutting nature of the disaster\u2019s \nimpact, and thus the multisectoral, interinstitutional, and multidisciplinary approach needed for \nthe  reconstruction  process.  The  disaster  points  out  the  need  to  undertake  cross-cutting \ninterventions, with a participatory, equitable, flexible, decentralized, and transparent approach \nbeyond livelihood restoration. Better management of the coastal environment and reinforced \nrisk reduction should be seen as part of the overall social and economic strategy, resulting in \nadoption of realistic, attainable goals in the short- and medium-term. \n \n9.  Beyond the immediate response from the national and state governments\u2014in terms of \nthe allocation of calamity resources and providing the affected population with material and \nmonetary relief\u2014the reduction of hazard risk involves the participation of the affected population \nand civil society. Effective hazard risk management in the future should be less dependent on \nrelief and assistance, which draws valuable resources from other development goals. Instead, \nthe community participation needs to be promoted in risk transfer insurance, and community risk \nmanagement and disaster prevention, while giving assistance to those affected. ", "Appendix 3  33 \nMACROECONOMIC IMPACT  \n \nA.   Macroeconomic Impact \n \n1.  The tsunami, one of the worst humanitarian tragedies in the coastal history of southern \nIndia, has had only a localized economic impact. It has had little impact on the gross domestic \nproduct of India or the affected states, as economic activities along the coastline contribute little \nto their income. Foreign exchange receipts may be marginally impacted to the extent that \nshrimp exports are affected along with coastal tourism.  \n \nB.  Fiscal Impact \n \n2.  However, the impact of the tsunami on states\u2019 finances will be much more noticeable. \nThe impact will primarily be transmitted through the expenditure side\u2014both due to higher relief \nexpenditure in fiscal year (FY) 2004/05 as well as rehabilitation and reconstruction expenditure \nover the short- and medium-term. States\u2019 revenues are not impacted because the affected \neconomic activities along the coastline were largely in the informal and unorganized sectors. To \nanalyze the impact of this additional expenditure on the finances of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, the \nstates\u2019 existing medium-term fiscal plans are used as the baseline scenario. In contrast, an \nalternative scenario is presented that reflects the likely impact on the short- and medium-term \nreconstruction activities to be spread over 3 years beginning in FY2005/06. The effect of the \ntsunami can be estimated as the difference between the fiscal deficit to gross state domestic \nproduct (GSDP) ratio under these two scenarios. The fiscal costs can be divided into two \ncategories: (i) direct impact due to additional tsunami-related expenditures; and (ii) indirect \nimpact due to higher interest burden resulting from increases in debt stock caused by tsunami-\nrelated expenditures. Thus, the spiral effect of debt-deficit dynamics through higher interest \nburden will spill over beyond the period in which the actual expenditures are incurred.  \n \n3.  Expenditure. Average total expenditure as a percentage of GSDP will rise by 0.7% in \nTamil Nadu during FY2005/06 to FY2007/08 in the alternative scenario. This rise is more than \nthe tsunami-related additional expenditure because of the debt-deficit dynamics explained in \npara. 2. Similarly in Kerala, the expenditure to GSDP ratio will rise by 0.2% on average during \nthe same period.  \n \n4.  Fiscal Deficit. In the case of Tamil Nadu, the rehabilitation and reconstruction costs will \nlead to a widening of the deficit during FY2005/06 to FY2007/08 by more than the tsunami-\nrelated expenditure. Thus, total fiscal cost, both direct and indirect, is estimated to be 0.8%, \n0.6%, and 0.7% of GSDP in FY2005/06, 2006/07, and 2007/08 (Table A3.1). Although the full \ncost of rehabilitation is assumed to be fully met by FY2007/08 under the alternative scenario, \nthe ratio of fiscal deficit to GSDP continues to be higher than the baseline scenario beyond \nFY2007/08 reflecting the debt dynamics. Total fiscal cost is estimated to be 0.2% of GSDP on \nan annual basis during the same period in Kerala (Table A3.2). \n \n5.  Debt Stock. The fiscal cost of the tsunami will lead to higher debt stock in Tamil Nadu \nand Kerala in the period of analysis. Thus, the debt to GSDP ratio in Tamil Nadu reaches 33.1% \nby FY2007/08 as against 31% in the baseline. Similarly, in Kerala, the debt to GSDP ratio at \n40.1% in FY2007/08 exceeds the corresponding ratio in the baseline scenario by one half \npercentage point of GSDP.  \n \n ", "34  Appendix 3 \n \nTable A3.1: Fiscal Cost of the Tsunami for Tamil Nadu \n(% of gross state domestic product)  \n  FY2003/04  FY2004/05  FY2005/06  FY2006/07  FY2007/08 \n Base Line (Status Quo)     Budget Estimate Projections Projections  Projections\nA.

Damage  \n \n1.  The extent of damage to livelihoods1 either directly or indirectly2 extends much beyond \ndamage to physical infrastructure. Loss of lives; injuries; destruction of houses and productive \nassets; and damage to social, physical, and transport infrastructure compounded damage to \nlivelihoods. The tsunami hit the livelihoods of those who were already poor3 the hardest and \naccentuated their deep-seated vulnerability due to the socioeconomic structure of the affected \nareas, land-holding patterns, ownership of economic assets, and lack of skills to benefit from \neconomic opportunities. Seasonal income patterns; climatic variations; and low coverage and \nquality of water, sanitation, health, and education worsened the adverse impact. \n  \n2.  The damage suffered by fisherfolks affected a broad range of microenterprises4 due to \nmarked  interdependency  in  coastal  economies  (Table  A4.1).  The  vulnerability  of \nmicroenterprises to disruptions in sources of supplies and markets led to loss of employment, \nespecially for women. Microenterprises cater to local markets and the lower income segments \nof the population both for inputs and outputs. The damage to agriculture and livestock, though \nnot significant, has also affected the livelihoods of vulnerable coastal communities, including \nscheduled castes, scheduled tribes, and women. In addition, salinity of land and groundwater \nwill have long-term impacts on productivity and profitability of microenterprises especially those \nrelating to agriculture and horticulture. Landless and other casual laborers engaged in seasonal \nemployment and other intermittent activities for subsistence have suffered loss of employment \nopportunities and consequently wages.  \n \nTable A4.1: Estimated Breakup of Affected Livelihoods, Damages, and Wage Losses \n \n  Livelihoods  Kerala  Tamil Nadu   \nItem    Number  ($ million)  %  Number  ($ million)  %  Total \nI.

Livelihood Restoration Strategy and Initiatives \n \n3.  Livelihoods are in the private domain with a broad range of activities6 including fishing \nspread over a large number of poor and low-income households. Considering the lessons \nlearned in emergency rehabilitation interventions, the strategy for restoration of livelihoods7 \ninclude (i) priority for the poor and low-income families because of their inability to regain their \nlivelihoods without targeted interventions; (ii) empowering the poor by enabling them to reflect \ntheir priorities through group-based mechanisms, primarily self-help groups (SHGs), which are \nwell represented in the affected areas; (iii) building and strengthening SHGs for sustained \nimpact, cost-effective service delivery, and adequate gender representation; and (iv) special \ninterventions for vulnerable groups that cannot immediately engage in economic activities.  \n \n4.  Pooling of development efforts of the government, private sector, and nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) will be required to restore and develop livelihoods. In addition, the active \nparticipation of affected people (including scheduled castes and scheduled tribes) to ensure \neffective utilization of funds, timely delivery, effective targeting, and transparency are essential. \nExpeditious service delivery, outreach, and continuity will be essential for convergence with \nongoing initiatives with established implementation mechanisms. Both Tamil Nadu, with the \nmost damage, and Kerala8 are promoting social and economic empowerment of the poor and \nlow-income households through organization of SHGs and supporting them through revolving \nfunds, part financing of group or individual economic enterprises, linkages to institutional credit, \nskills development, and insurance.9 While Tamil Nadu and Kerala are in the forefront of the \nSHG  movement  in  India,  the  coverage  of  coastal  communities  and  microenterprises \ndevelopment through SHGs remains limited.10  \n \nC.   Scope and Components  \n \n5.  The magnitude of the poverty impact of damaged livelihoods requires a substantial \nresponse to restore income flows, reduce dependence on relief, and revive local economies. \nAccordingly,  in  consultation  with  state  governments  this  component11  includes  (i)  restoring \nlivelihoods of the affected poor and low-income households already organized into SHGs and \nother similar groups recognized by state governments as affected by the tsunami through \nmicroenterprise training and establishment support; (ii) formation of new SHGs, for both men \nand  women,  from  affected  households  not  yet  organized  in  community-based  groups  for \nrestoring  livelihoods  through  microenterprise  training  and  establishment  support;  (iii) \nreplacement of productive assets (i.e., excluding housing) of tsunami-affected households; (iv) \nskills upgrading;12 (v) risk mitigation through insurance of all affected households that receive \nassistance under this component, through available life and property insurance schemes; (vi) \n                                                 \n6  State governments identified 23 microenterprises other than fisherfolk affected by tsunami.  \n7  Restoring livelihoods covers support for economic enterprises, upgrading skills and technology, and community-\nbased microinfrastructure to enable the poor to actively engage in economic activities. \n8  Mahalir Thittam (Tamil Nadu) with 80,000 and Kudumbashree (Kerala) with 150,000 SHGs are flagship programs.  \n9  Implementation of this framework is financed under the Swarnajayanthi Grama Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY) in the \nratio of 75:25 by the state governments and Government of India. In addition to back-ended subsidies, linkages are \nestablished with financing institutions. Generally, the rural development departments implement SGSY. So far \n24,000 SHGs in Tamil Nadu and 15,000 SHGs in Kerala are under various stages of support under SGSY.  \n10 Only 7,500 SHGs in Tamil Nadu and approximately 1,500 in Kerala are in coastal communities. \n11 The scope excludes fisheries and agriculture sectors, including associated asset replacement expected to be \nfunded from other sources. However, livelihood restoration relating to these segments (SHG formation, skills \ndevelopment, and microenterprise development support) are part of the scope in view of the inextricable linkages \nin local economies and the need for coordinated implementation for cost-efficient service delivery.  \n12 Skills development intervention is kept generic to ensure participation of SHGs, and other affected community \ngroups and individuals. The scope includes fisheries and allied activities of poor and low income households. \n ", "Appendix 4  37 \nrestoring community-based infrastructure affected by the tsunami; and (vii) technical support for \nimplementation, monitoring, and impact assessment of this component.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n6.  The total cost of this component is $60.16 million equivalent. Of the total cost, $51.15 \nmillion equivalent is for Tamil Nadu and $9.02 million equivalent is for Kerala. The Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  will  finance  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $0.19  million \nequivalent and $58.84 million equivalent of local currency cost or about 98% of the total cost. \nThe Government will finance the remaining local currency cost of $1.32 million equivalent, which \nincludes taxes and duties. Cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 9. \n  \nE.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n1.  Project Management  \n \n7.  The  Revenue  Administration,  Disaster  Management  and  Mitigation  Department \n(RADMMD) in Tamil Nadu and the Department of Disaster Management (DDM) in Kerala will be \nthe executing agencies (EAs). The EAs will establish project management units (PMUs) with \nrepresentation of line agencies. The PMUs will work closely with the ADB extended missions to \nfacilitate implementation and exercise monitoring and control.  \n \n8.   Within this framework, the Rural Development Department in Tamil Nadu and Kerala \nFisheries Department13 will be implementing agencies (IAs). For state coordination, both IAs will \nbe represented in the PMUs. Project implementation units (PIUs) will be established within the \nRural Development Department and Kerala Fisheries Department. Project implementation will \nbe  undertaken  by  field  functionaries  with  emphasis  on  participation  of  local  bodies, \ncommunities, and NGOs similar to the Swarnajayanthi Grama Swarozgar Yojana framework \nwith adaptations required for expediting outreach without compromising core principles. Key \nactivities will be outsourced to specialized agencies such as Kudumbashree in Kerala, Tamil \nNadu  Corporation  for  Women  Development  Limited,  Enterprise  Development  Institute  in \nAhmedabad,  and  other  accredited  training  establishments  and  NGO  service  providers. \nSuccessful SHGs will be encouraged as service providers to mainstream good governance in \ncommunity-based development interventions. \n \n2.  Implementation Schedule  \n \n9.  The Project will be implemented over 3 years, commencing in the second quarter of \n2005. The concerned state governments will establish the PMUs and PIUs. The following start-\nup activities will be completed within the first 3 months (i) service provider eligibility criteria and \n(ii) processing of retroactive financing, if any.  \n \n3.  Procurement  \n \n10.  Procurement,  wherever  required  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. \n                                                 \n13The Government of Kerala prefers livelihood restoration to be implemented by the Fisheries Department to realize \nthe unexplored synergies between fisheries and other livelihood sources. Implementation in close coordination with \nKudambashree (responsible for SGSY implementation) will ensure realization of the project objective. \n ", "38  Appendix 4 \n \n \n4.  Consulting Services  \n \n11.  Domestic  consultants  (community  microenterprise  development  specialists)  will  be \nrequired in Kerala and in Tamil Nadu to provide technical support to equip the line departments \nto restore livelihoods in the aftermath of the disaster, mainstream best practices in community-\nbased  microenterprise  development,  emphasize  outreach  to  women  and  other  vulnerable \ngroups, pool the development efforts of stakeholders, monitor progress, and measure impact.  \n \n5.  Monitoring  \n \n12.  The  PIUs  will  maintain  a  project  performance  monitoring  system  that  will  generate \nsemiannual and annual reports. The information system will include (i) the number of SHGs \nformed and assisted, including membership by poverty classification, vulnerability, and gender; \n(ii) capacity and skills training imparted; (iii) the number of enterprises supported and their \nfinancial  and  efficiency  ratios;  (iv)  repayment  performance;  (v) asset  replacement  and  risk \nmitigation; and (vi) quantitative and qualitative progress of community-based microinfrastructure \nprojects.14  Specific  monitoring  indicators  will  be  applied  to  monitor  whether  the  affected \nscheduled castes and scheduled tribe community members receive the above assistance. The \nIAs will periodically commission independent impact assessment to measure poverty outreach \nand poverty reduction through changes in income, asset holding, and employment status. The \nIAs will maintain proper records and identification of SHGs and individual beneficiaries receiving \nassistance including cash assistance under the Project. Likewise proper accounts and reports \nwill be maintained by the IAs and provided periodically to the EAs.  \n \nF.  Benefits and Risks  \n \n13.  The  Project  represents  a  focused  approach  to  restoring  livelihoods  of  affected \nhouseholds through extension of ongoing interventions with appropriate adaptations for income \nexpansion, employment generation, and poverty reduction. The Project is expected to support \n12,000  SHGs  with  nearly  130,000  members  including  their  capacity  building  and  skills \ndevelopment. At least 50% of those assisted will be women and at least 3% will be from among \nthe disabled. About 130,00015 livelihoods will either be restored or started. In total, 350,000 \nlivelihoods are likely to receive asset replacement and risk reduction support. Simultaneous \ninterventions especially for infrastructure restoration through National Calamity Contingency \nFund, state governments, private sector, and multilateral and bilateral agencies will facilitate \nforward and backward linkages, which will help enhance the rate of return on investments in \nmicroenterprises.  \n \n14.  Major  risks  relate  to  ambitious  targets  inducing  compromise  on  core  principles  of \nsustainability and community participation. This has been mitigated by setting goals that can be \nrealistically achieved within the context of a limited duration Project.16 In addition, due caution \nwill be taken in selecting and promoting enterprises. The covariance risk of establishing a large \nnumber of similar microenterprises in limited geographic areas has been reduced through a \ndemand-driven  approach  where  communities  realistically  assess  their  skill  and  abilities.  A \ncommunity-based approach will enhance effective targeting.  \n \n                                                 \n14 Operation and maintenance costs will be borne by local bodies. \n15 Assuming group-based economic enterprises. \n16 The size of this component factors implementation capacity and the time required to achieve expected outputs.  \n ", "Appendix 5  39 \nROADS AND BRIDGES \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  Tamil  Nadu  has  a  well-developed  transport  system  comprising  land,  sea,  and  air \ntransport modes. Road transport accounts for about 80% of freight and passenger trips and \ncatalyses  interstate  and  intrastate  trade.  The  total  road  length  in  Tamil  Nadu  is  151,137 \nkilometers (km) comprising 60,628 km of primary road network managed by the Highways \nDepartment, and the remaining 90,509 km of Panchayat/Union/Municipal/Forest/other roads \nmanaged by local bodies and other agencies. The primary road network in the state includes \n3,865 km of national highways, 7,136 km of state highways, 7,408 km of major district roads, \nand 42,219 km of other district roads.  \n \n2.  Kerala\u2014one of the smaller states in terms of area\u2014is ranked fourth in the country in \ninfrastructure penetration, a parameter based on transport, communication, and energy-related \nvariables. The transport system of Kerala comprises a hierarchy of roads, railways, domestic \nand international airlines, inland waterways, and coastal and international shipping. The total \nroad length is 138,196 km comprising 22,991 km of primary road network managed by the \nPublic  Works  Department  and  the  remaining  115,204  km  of \nPanchayat/Municipal/Forest/Irrigation/other roads managed by local bodies and other agencies. \nThe primary road network includes 1,523 km of national highways, 3,785 km of state highways, \n11,711 km of major district roads, 5,315 km of other district roads, and 655 km of other roads. \n \nB.  Damage and Impact of the Tsunami  \n \n3.  In Tamil Nadu, the impact of tsunami on roads and bridges extended to 12 affected \ncoastal districts, with particular severity in Cuddalore, Kannyakumari, and Nagapattinam,. While \nsome lengths of a national highway (NH45A) suffered minor damage, the state road network in \nthe coastal districts was affected the most. \n \n4.  In Kerala, the impact of the tsunami on roads and bridges extended mainly to three \ncoastal districts, Alappuzha, Ernakulam, and Kollam, out of the districts affected by the tsunami. \nWhile no national highways or state highways were damaged, major district roads and other \ndistrict roads, including structures were damaged in the coastal belt between the seacoast and \nthe backwaters (Travancore-Shornur Canal). In the districts of Alappuzha, Ernakulam, and \nKollam,  the  narrow  major  district  roads  running  along  the  sea  at  an  average  distance  of \napproximately 50 meters from the seacoast suffered severe damage, including to minor bridges \nand culverts. \n \n5.  The  tsunami  left  some  bridges  totally  damaged;  roads  severely  breached;  berms, \nshoulders and protection works eroded; and the road structure exposed. Pavements were \nwashed away and cross-drainage structures damaged. The impact of the tsunami waves was \nso severe that some bridge structures were damaged due to boats hitting the substructures and \ndecks.  Many  lives  were  lost  due  to  lack  of  bridges  connecting  the  mainland  across  the \nbackwaters/rivers. The Joint Assessment Mission\u2019s report estimated reconstruction needs for \nroad and bridges at $15 million in Tamil Nadu and $10.5 million in Kerala.  \n \nC.  Government Response to the Tsunami \n \n6.  The  Highways  Department  of  Tamil  Nadu  and  Public  Works  Department  of  Kerala \nimmediately mobilized their resources and reestablished connectivity by carrying out temporary \n ", "40  Appendix 5 \n \nrehabilitation works on road links critical for relief operations. The Highways Department, Tamil \nNadu has incurred expenditures of about $1.5 million on temporary restoration works. In Kerala, \nthe expenditure incurred by Public Works Department is being consolidated. \n \nD.  Scope  \n \n7.  This component comprises (i) rehabilitation and reconstruction1 of tsunami-damaged \nstate highways, major district roads, and other district roads within Cuddalore, Kannyakumari, \nNagapattinam, and other tsunami-affected districts in Tamil Nadu; and Alappuzha, Ernakulam, \nand Kollam districts in Kerala; and (ii) where technically feasible and justified, the design of \ndisaster prevention work to provide missing bridges on roads constituting potential evacuation \nroutes. \n \nE.

In \naddition, the subproject under the roads and bridges subcomponent will also meet the following \ncriteria, as applicable: (i) a tsunami-damaged road at a distance not more than 5 km from the \ntsunami-affected coast line; (ii) a tsunami-damaged road not more than 5 km along the river or \nbackwater from the coast; (iii) missing bridges on roads or unbridged crossings constituting \npotential evacuation routes that will considerably reduce the time required for evacuation or \nprovide  rescue  and  relief  in  case  of  from  future  tsunami,  storms,  and  cyclones;  and  (iv) \nconstruction  activities  on  the  subproject  will  commence  only  after  complying  with  all  the \nstatutory environmental requirements including those related to the coastal regulations zone, as \napplicable, and taking account of road safety requirements which can be duly audited.  \n \nF.   Cost Estimates \n \n9.  The total cost of this component is $26.54 million equivalent. Of the total cost, $9.74 \nmillion equivalent is for Tamil Nadu and $16.80 million equivalent is for Kerala. The Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  will  finance  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $16.12  million \nequivalent and $8.69 million equivalent of local currency cost or about 94% of the total cost.

Introduction \n \n1.  Of the more than 160 ports in India, 12 major ports handle about three fourths of the \ntotal traffic of 330 million tons. Major ports of Chennai, Ennore, Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu, and \nCochin in Kerala handle 21% of the total throughput of all major ports. Major ports are managed \nby port trusts under the regulation of the Tariff Authority for Major Ports. Minor ports handle the \nremaining one fourth of total traffic, and are under state government control. Tamil Nadu has 15 \nminor ports handling 800,000 tons of cargo and Kerala has 17 minor ports handling 400,000 \ntons. \n \n2.  Apart from four main fishing harbors\u2014Chennai (Tamil Nadu), Kochi (Kerala), Roychowk \nin  Calcutta  (West  Bengal),  and  Vishakhapatnam  (Andhra  Pradesh)\u2014other  fishing  harbors \n(hereafter referred to as harbors) and fish-landing centers are designated in each state to \nprovide landing and berthing facilities to fishing crafts in the nation. Tamil Nadu has 7 harbors \nand 17 landing centers and jetties, and Kerala has 13 harbors and 25 landing centers. Of the \nnational total of fish landings, Tamil Nadu accounts for about 15% and Kerala for 26%. \n \nB.  Damage and Impact of the Tsunami \n \n3.  Damage to major ports by the tsunami was relatively minor due to their geographic \nlocations and breakwaters. However, the two minor ports in Tamil Nadu and the four minor ports \nin Kerala have been damaged. Six harbors in Tamil Nadu and eight harbors in Kerala as well as \nlanding centers in the states were also affected. More than 8,000 m length of harbor/seawalls \nand breakwaters are reported to have been damaged or destroyed. About 1,600,000 cubic \nmeters (m3) of dredging will be required to remove tsunami-inflicted siltation from harbor basins \nand  approach  channels  in  20  ports,  harbors,  and  landing  centers.  Based  on  the  Joint \nAssessment Mission Report and discussions with the relevant line departments of the states the \ncost of reconstructing ports and harbors is estimated at $21 million for Tamil Nadu and $13 \nmillion for Kerala. \n \n4.  In  Tamil  Nadu,  Nagapattinam  Port  located  along  Kaduvaiyar  River,  was  severely \ndamaged by the tsunami. The port had been handling around 80,000 tons a year for importing \noil and exporting cement. The fishing harbor located on the river upstream of the port, with fish \nlanding of 30,000 tons, was also badly damaged. The two breakwaters at the mouth of the river \nwere destroyed and one barge carried by the tsunami collided with the coastal protection groyn \nbetween the sea and river. This led to sand drifting from the sea to the channel and basins, as \nwell as reduction of the calmness of the channel and basins. The tsunami waves came over the \nseawall of the fishing harbor area destroying parts of wharfs, the fish market, and the auction \ncenter. Tsunami waves also destroyed fishing boats and a dredger, and left them along the \nchannel and on the wharfs of the port. As a result of the shallow channel and basins, and \nbroken facilities, the port has suspended operation for more than 2 months. The channel, \ncommonly servicing the fishing harbor on the river upstream, has also prevented fishing boats \nfrom  plying  to  and  from  the  fishing  harbor.  Similarly,  in  Cuddalore  Port,  located  at  the \nconfluence  of  the  Gadilam  and  Paravanar  rivers,  the  breakwaters  and  equipment  were \ndamaged, and drafts of the basin and the channel have been reduced. Furthermore, six harbors \nand five landing centers were seriously affected and need urgent dredging and rehabilitation of \njetties, retaining walls, auction centers, and facilities.  \n \n5.  In Kerala, sand drift caused by the tsunami led to serious reduction of the draft in four \nminor ports (Azhikkal, Beypore, Neendakara, and Vizhinjam) and eight harbors and landing \n ", "Appendix 6  43  \ncenters. The waves also damaged some breakwaters, compound walls, approach roads, and \nother  facilities.  As  a  result,  some  maritime  cargo  is  being  transshipped  offshore  between \nvessels and small barges that can ply the shallow channels and basins. Other maritime cargo is \nnow being transported by trucks at higher cost. In Beypore port, the ferry service to islands, \ncarrying  25,000  passengers  a  year,  has  been  diverted  to  Cochin  port  after  the  tsunami. \nSubstantial numbers of the labor force are reported to be unemployed as a result of limited or \nsuspended port operation. Due to the siltation of harbors and landing centers, fishing boats can \noperate only during high tides, resulting in substantial losses in fisheries production. \n \n6.  Both states are concerned that coastal disasters including tsunami, cyclones, and storm \nsurges can cause ocean pollution due to oil and sewerage spill from vessels and fishing boats. \nTo mitigate pollution risk in the event of coastal disasters, ports and harbors need reception \nfacilities for oil and sewerage wastes. \n \nC.  Scope \n \n7.  To address the immediate need to rehabilitate breakwaters and carry out dredging to \nallow port and fishing operations to be resumed as soon as possible, this project component for \nstate-owned ports and harbors comprises (i) priority dredging for ports, harbor basins, and \napproach channels; (ii) rehabilitation of breakwaters for ports and harbors; (iii) rehabilitation of \nfishing harbor facilities like compound/harbor walls; (iv) rehabilitation of damaged roads and \nports facilities like electrification systems, wharfs, and piers; and (v) procurement of equipment \nsuch as a destroyed dredger and navigational aids. Rehabilitation works to restore the facilities \nto the pre-tsunami level, where appropriate, will include upgrading designs to mitigate damage \nfrom  future  natural  disasters,  including  tsunami  and  cyclones.  This  component  excludes \nrehabilitation works sanctioned by the Government\u2019s National Calamity Contingency Fund.  \n \nD.  Subproject Selection Criteria \n \n8.  Subprojects will meet the general criteria for the Project as outlined in Appendix 11. In \naddition, subprojects will also meet the following criteria: (i) provide emergency or short-term \nreestablishment of port and fisheries operation; (ii) contribute significantly to disaster mitigation, \nincluding pollution abatement; and (iii) contribute significantly to enhancing safety in maritime \ntransport and fishing. \n \nE.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n9.  The total cost of this component is $27.65 million equivalent. Of the total cost, $18.90 \nmillion equivalent is for Tamil Nadu and $8.75 million equivalent is for Kerala. The Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will finance the entire foreign exchange cost of $4.08 million and \n$21.82 million equivalent of local currency cost or about 94% of the total cost.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n  1.  Institutional Arrangements \n \n10.  The  Revenue  Administration,  Disaster  Management  and  Mitigation  Department \n(RADMMD) in Tamil Nadu and the Department of Disaster Management (DDM) in Kerala will be \nthe executing agencies (EAs). The EAs will establish project management units (PMUs) with \nrepresentation of line agencies. The PMUs will work closely with the ADB extended missions to \nfacilitate implementation and exercise monitoring and control.  \n ", "44  Appendix 6 \n \n11.  The Maritime Board and Department of Fisheries will be the implementing agencies \n(IAs)  for  the  ports  and  harbors  components  respectively  in  Tamil  Nadu.  Ports/Harbor \nEngineering Departments will be the IA for ports and fishing harbor components in Kerala. For \nstate level coordination, the IAs will be represented in the PMUs. Project implementation units \n(PIUs) will be established within the IAs. The PIUs will be responsible for the selection and \npreparation of the subprojects, and will carry out the due diligence to ensure compliance with \nthe subproject selection criteria indicated in Appendix 11 and ADB social, environmental, and \nresettlement safeguard policies (Appendixes 13, 14, 15, and 16). \n \n2.  Procurement  \n \n12.  Civil works contracts and procurement of goods and services will follow local competitive \nbidding procedures in accordance with ADB Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n  3.  Implementation Schedule \n \n13.  The works under this component will be completed by 30 April 2008. Within the overall \nproject duration of 36 months, the duration of construction for any subproject will not exceed 24 \nmonths. The overall implementation schedule is given in Appendix 12. \n \n  4.  Consulting Services \n \n14.  Consultant services will be provided to assist the IAs to (i) review assessments with \nverification of damages and cost estimates based on unit costs; (ii) prepare a detailed time-\nbound reconstruction work program; (iii) provide engineering assistance, including survey and \ndesign; (iv) manage procurement, including preparation of tender documents, evaluation, and \naward of bids; (v) assist the IAs to prepare environmental management plan and supervise \nenvironmental management; and (vi) report progress of the project and performance monitoring \nto  and  coordinate  with  the  PMU.  The  project  performance  indicators  include  bathymetric \nsurveys, cargo throughputs, number of passengers, and volume of fish landing. \n \nG.  Benefits and Risks \n \n15.  This component will restore port and harbor operations directly benefiting port users and \nfisherfolk. In addition to shipping companies and ferry operators, ferry passengers who have to \ntake a diverted route will also benefit. Dredging to secure required drafts will enhance maritime \nsafety in ports and harbors.  \n \n16.  Major risks relating to the component are environmental management and maintenance \nof rehabilitated infrastructure. Of critical importance, the environmental experts, to be recruited \nfor the PMUs, must prepare environmental management plans for dredging and supervise the \nimplementation. The risk of inadequate maintenance, particularly in dredging, can be mitigated \nby regular bathymetric surveys and careful layout planning of ports and harbors based on \nhydraulic research. \n ", "Appendix 7  45 \nWATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION \n \nA.  Damage and Impact \n \n1.  Over 90% of tsunami-affected areas of Tamil Nadu and 60% of Kerala have been \ncovered by piped water supply systems. However, water quantity and quality for most systems \nin both states are grossly insufficient, with less than half getting 40 liters per day per capita \n(lpcd), an interim standard adopted by Tamil Nadu (as opposed to the national standard of 70 \nlpcd for rural areas and 135 lpcd for urban areas). Many schemes also suffer from high content \nof fluorides, sodium, and iron, with shallow wells facing high levels of salinity in dry seasons. \nCoverage of sanitation is lagging, with Tamil Nadu having only 15% coverage in coastal villages \nand slightly over 50% in urban areas. Kerala has had over 50% coverage on average. These \nunsatisfactory conditions have led to poor health and morbidity, exacerbating the poverty in the \naffected areas.  \n \n2.  The tsunami-damaged water supply and sanitation systems along the coastline have \nresulted in salinization of wells, and destruction of distribution pipes, public stand posts, and \nindividual hand pumps needed to supplement the meager piped water supply. In Tamil Nadu \n329,000 people in six municipalities and 74 village panchayat are directly affected, and in \nKerala, 192,000 in one municipality and 27 village panchayats. Large number of household pit \nlatrines, septic tanks, and public toilets were also damaged. The Joint Assessment Mission\u2019s \npreliminary estimate for immediate and medium-term reconstruction needs for Tamil Nadu and \nKerala totaled $38 million, which was further detailed by the mission at $20 million for Tamil \nNadu and $15 million for Kerala. The reconstruction needs incorporate costs for rebuilding up to \na standard that responds to local requirements, including the risk of natural disaster, on top of \nthe same-standard replacement costs.  \n \n3.  Taking into account the lessons of the emergency rehabilitation interventions and local \nconsultations by the Joint Assessment Mission and the Mission, the sector recovery strategy \nemphasizes (i) transparent decision making and community participation, including through \nconsultation with local government institutions; (ii) upgrading systems as appropriate in lieu of \nrehabilitating existing poorly performing systems with due options consideration; (iii) producing \nan  awareness  campaign  in  coastal  communities  on  water  conservation,  water  quality, \nsanitation,  and  hygiene  issues;  (iv)  forging  good  working  relationships  with  concerned \ndepartments and capable nongovernment organizations (NGOs); (v) ensuring quality of works in \nterms of process and products by setting out and monitoring measurable indicators; and (vi) \nstrengthening  sustainable  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  capacity  of  the  concerned \ncommunities.  \n \nB.  Scope \n \n4.  This component will rehabilitate/upgrade the water supply and sanitation infrastructure \nand provide related services for tsunami-affected communities in 9 districts of Tamil Nadu and 4 \nof Kerala. Rehabilitation works will be carried out to restore facilities to pre-tsunami level or to a \nhigher cost-effective standard. The Project will include (i) restoring and upgrading damaged \nexisting water supply systems including providing tankers; (ii) upgrading affected water supply \nsystems  into  multivillage  systems  with  more  reliable  source  development;  (iii) \nrehabilitating/upgrading sanitary complex and solid waste management facilities; (iv) providing a \n ", "46  Appendix 7 \n \nsanitation and environmental awareness campaign;1 and (v) undertaking technical support for \ndamage  assessment  surveys,  aquifer  and  hydrology  study,  disaster  resistant  design, \nconstruction quality control, and community participation. \n \n5.  By providing improved drinking water supplies in terms of quantity and quality at least to \nthe level of or beyond the pre-tsunami conditions, the Project will contribute to reducing time \nand resources for providing or collecting water and for maintaining existing poorly performing \nsystems.  This,  along  with  appropriate  sanitation  and  solid  waster  management  practices \npromoted  under  the  Project,  will  also  contribute  to  protecting  public  health  from  potential \nwaterborne  diseases,  and  reducing  pressure  on  the  fragile  coastal  aquifer  and  natural \nenvironment. The Project\u2019s institutional support will lead to improved practices in community \nparticipation in project planning and implementation, and sound technical design and quality \ncontrol, along with increased involvement of local government institutions and beneficiaries in \nO&M of completed schemes.  \n \nC.  Subproject Selection Criteria \n \n6.  Subprojects  to  be  selected  will  meet  the  general  criteria  outlined  in  Appendix  11. \nRehabilitation/upgrading of water supply systems will be packaged into individual subprojects in \ncombination with the supporting activities, including sanitation and solid waste management as \nappropriate, and selected and implemented following the specific criteria and format jointly \nprepared by the consultants and the Government and agreeable to the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB).  These  will  include  (i)  consultation  with  the  affected  communities,  including \nvulnerable groups, through local government institutions; (ii) confirmation on the aquifer and \nriver water availability and sustainability for schemes seeking new sources; (iii) contribution to \nimproving  environmental  conditions;  and  (iv)  confirmation  of  O&M  sustainability  through \npreparation of O&M plans with clear stipulation of responsibilities and resource requirements of \nthe concerned parties with their confirmed affordability.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n7.  The total cost of this component is $38.11 million equivalent. Of the total cost, $24.38 \nmillion equivalent is for Tamil Nadu and $13.73 million equivalent is for Kerala. ADB will finance \nthe entire foreign exchange cost of $11.23 million and $24.77 million equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost or about 95% of the total cost. The Government will finance the remaining local \ncurrency cost of $2.11 million equivalent, which includes taxes and duties. Cost estimates and \nthe financing plan are in Appendix 9. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n  1.  Project Management \n \n8.  The  Revenue  Administration,  Disaster  Management  and  Mitigation  Department \n(RADMMD) in Tamil Nadu and the Department of Disaster Management (DDM) in Kerala will be \nthe executing agencies (EAs).The EAs will establish project management units (PMUs) with \nrepresentation of line agencies.

The program will be \nextended in the concerned subproject area, using the project funds as necessary.   \n ", "Appendix 7  47 \n9.  Within this framework, the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board and Kerala \nWater Authority will be the implementing agencies (IAs) for the water supply subcomponent in \nthe respective states. The Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board and the concerned \nmunicipality  will  be  responsible  for  water  supply.  Sanitation  is  implemented  by  the  Rural \nDevelopment Department and the concerned municipalities in Tamil Nadu, and by the Kerala \nWater Authority and the concerned panchayat in Kerala. For state level coordination, the IAs will \nbe represented in the PMUs. Project implementation units (PIUs) will be established within the \nIAs. Day-to-day subproject implementation will be undertaken by the concerned district offices of \nthe IAs. The PIUs will be responsible for selecting and preparing the subprojects, and will carry \nout the due diligence to ensure compliance with the subproject selection criteria indicated in \nAppendix 11 and ADB social, environmental, and resettlement safeguard policies (Appendixes \n13, 14, 15, and 16). \n \n  2.  Implementation Schedule \n \n10.  The Project will be implemented over 3 years, commencing in the second quarter of \n2005. The concerned state governments will establish the PMUs and assign relevant staff to the \nPMUs and PIUs within 1 month of project approval. The start-up activities will be completed \nwithin 6 months of loan effectiveness, including (i) recruitment of consultants; (ii) finalization of \nsubproject assessment, prioritization, and selection criteria; (iii) selection of subprojects; and (iv) \nprocurement of immediately required works including processing for retroactive financing, if any.  \n \n  3.  Procurement  \n \n11.  Civil works contracts and procurement of goods and services will follow local competitive \nbidding procedures in accordance with ADB Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n  4.  Consulting Services \n \n12.  Domestic consulting services are needed, as required, to implement the subcomponent \nand include water supply specialist, sanitation specialist, environmental specialist, resettlement \nspecialist, construction manager, and field engineers, for (i) overseeing subproject proposal \npreparation;  (ii)  advising  on  technical  studies,  disaster  resistant  design,  and  sanitation \ncampaigns; (iii) providing monitoring and quality control; (iv) fostering public participation; and \n(v) assisting with reports and other ADB requirements including safeguards.  \n \n  5.  Monitoring and Quality Control \n \n13.  For effective management of subproject planning, implementation monitoring and quality \ncontrol, each subproject, in particular for upgraded water supply systems, will have a subproject \nimplementation plan that sets out distinct processes and outputs, including impact indicators, in \ntheir  subproject  plan.  Those  indicators  will  be  monitored  through  a  project  performance \nmonitoring system for the Project, comprising the systems of effective recording and reporting in \nthe field, and monitoring and auditing at the IA and PMU level with the assistance of PMU \nconsultants. Beneficiaries will also be involved in project monitoring and evaluation, through \ndirect reporting to civil society representative of the district committee and PMU.  \n \n  6.  Sustainable Operation and Maintenance  \n \n14.  For  O&M,  the  Tamil  Nadu  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Board  is  responsible  for \nmultivillage water supply schemes, whereas the concerned panchayat and municipalities are \n ", "48  Appendix 7 \n \nresponsible for O&M of single village and municipality schemes in Tamil Nadu. The Government \nhas  progressively  adopted  effective  reforms  including  management  transfer  to  local \ngovernments, tariff revision every 3 years, and downsizing of the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and \nDrainage Board, with provision of necessary budget for maintenance.  \n \n15.  In Kerala, the Kerala Water Authority is responsible for O&M of multivillage and single \nvillage  schemes  supported  under  the  Project.  These  are  all  relatively  large  systems  with \nbeneficiary population of more than 3,500. While the Kerala Water Authority currently has a \nrevenue deficit of about $25 million, it has initiated reforms with external financing support, \nincluding  upward  revision  of  water  tariffs,  transfer  of  smaller  schemes  to  panchayats, \ncomputerization of water billing and revenue collection for urban schemes, and institutional \nrestructuring.2 ADB is also supporting this process through an ongoing technical assistance and \na  proposed  Sustainable  Urban  Development  Project  for  Kerala,  which  will  strengthen  the \nfinancial and administrative management of the Kerala Water Authority. \n  \n16.  For  the  purpose  of  sustainable  O&M  of  rehabilitated/upgraded  systems  under  the \nProject,  a  subproject-specific  O&M  plan  will  be  developed  that  set  outs  the  annual  O&M \narrangements and institutional responsibilities including financial requirements. The O&M plans \nwill be presented and confirmed with the concerned local governments and beneficiaries when \nfinalizing the implementation plan.  \n \n                                                 \n2  As a result, revenue collection has increased by over 40% since 1999. \n ", "Appendix 8  49 \n \nOTHER RURAL AND MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE \n \nA.  Damage and Impact \n \n1.  Tamil Nadu ranks the third in the human development index for India, with a poverty \nindex of 21%; Kerala with a poverty index of 13%, ranks first; the national average was 26% in \n1999/2000. However, poverty incidence in tsunami-affected coastal communities is significantly \nhigher than the state average figures, reaching over 70% in both states in some backward \nhabitations. The majority of the coastal communities continue to earn their income in largely \ntraditional sectors of fishing and farming, while the poor survive primarily through a variety of \ninformal subsistence activities and wage labor. The state governments have placed high priority \non  promoting  rural  development  through  the  creation  of  self-  and  wage-employment \nopportunities with provision of community infrastructure, enterprise development support, and \ntraining. The tsunami hit these critical means of production and transportation of goods and \nservices along the coastline thereby significantly affecting the livelihoods of the vulnerable \ncoastal communities. \n \n2.  The tsunami waves coming ashore at high speed and returning to the sea caused \ndisruption of rural and municipal infrastructure, including severe erosion of roads, siltation of \ndrainage  channels,  destruction  of  buildings,  and  damage  to  electrical  distribution  systems. \nSome 775 kilometers (km) of panchayat union, panchayat, and municipal roads were fully or \npartially damaged in Tamil Nadu and 70 km in Kerala. The Joint Assessment Mission (JAM) \nestimated immediate and medium-term reconstruction needs at $26 million in Tamil Nadu and \nKerala. These were assessed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) mission at $40 million for \nTamil Nadu and $8 million for Kerala. The ADB mission incorporated the updated data collected \nby the concerned agencies on the reconstruction needs of those minor facilities which are \nwidely scattered across the affected areas. This information was not available during the JAM. \n \n3.  Taking into account the lessons of the emergency rehabilitation interventions and local \nconsultations  by  the  JAM,  the  sector  recovery  strategy  emphasizes  (i)  decentralized  and \ntransparent  decision  making  and  community  participation  with  emphasis  on  gender;  (ii) \nupgrading systems with disaster resistant design; (iii) providing employment opportunities for \nthe tsunami-affected communities; (iv) forging good working relationships with the concerned \ndepartments and capable nongovernment organizations (NGOs); (v) ensuring quality of works in \nterms of process and products by setting out and monitoring measurable indicators; and (vi) \nstrengthening sustainable operation and maintenance (O&M) capacity of the local government \ninstitutions.  \n \nB.  Scope \n \n4.  This component will rehabilitate/upgrade rural and municipal infrastructure and provide \nrelated services for the tsunami-affected communities of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Rehabilitation \nworks will be carried out to restore facilities to pre-tsunami level or to a higher cost-effective \nstandard.  The  facilities  rehabilitated  or  upgraded  under  the  Project  will  include \nrehabilitation/upgrading  of  (i)  village  and  municipal  roads;  (ii)  drainage  canals;  (iii)  public \nbuildings such as common fish landing, processing, and marketing facilities, community centers, \nand panchayat offices (about 450 in Tamil Nadu); and (iv) damaged electricity line network and \ndistribution transformers. The Project will also provide technical support for damage assessment \nsurveys,  construction  quality  control,  and  community  participation.  Rehabilitation  of  public \nbuildings  will  consider  disaster-resistant  design  and  relocation  to  a  safer  environment  as \nappropriate. \n ", "50  Appendix 8 \n \n5.  This component will contribute to restoring and rebuilding the livelihood of the affected \ncommunities by rehabilitating essential minor village and municipal infrastructure, providing \nemployment opportunities to local labor during the process, and supporting local community \ninstitutions  for  participatory  planning  and  implementation  to  rebuild  their  cohesion  and \nconfidence for development. Specifically, it will contribute to reducing transportation time and \nresources  for  goods  and  services,  in  particular  fishery  and  associated  products,  the  main \nindustry of the affected areas. It will lead to improved drainage conditions, at least to the pre-\ndisaster level. These, along with disaster-resistant rehabilitation of public buildings, will support \nimproved  productive  and  quality  of  life  conditions,  while  providing  essential  employment \nopportunities to the affected communities. Village ponds will be restored (under the livelihood \ncomponent) achieving the twin objectives of employment and increased water storage. The \nProject\u2019s institutional support will lead to improved practices in community participation in project \nplanning  and  implementation,  and  sound  technical  design  and  quality  control,  along  with \nincreased involvement of local government institutions and beneficiaries in O&M of completed \nschemes. \n \nC.  Subproject Selection Criteria \n \n6.  Subprojects  to  be  selected  will  meet  the  general  criteria  outlined  in  Appendix  11. \nRehabilitation/upgrading works will be packaged into individual subprojects at each village or \ncommunity, and selected and implemented following the specific criteria and format jointly \nprepared by the consultants and the state governments and agreeable to ADB. These include (i) \nconsultation  with  the  affected  communities  including  vulnerable  groups  through  local \ngovernment  institutions;  (ii)  contribution  to  improving  environmental  conditions;  and  (iii) \nconfirmation of O&M sustainability through preparation of O&M plans with clear stipulation of \nresponsibilities and resource requirements of the concerned parties, and confirmed affordability \nby the local governments and the beneficiaries.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n7.  The total cost of this component is $52.59 million equivalent. Of the total cost, $43.53 \nmillion equivalent is for Tamil Nadu and $9.06 million equivalent for Kerala. ADB will finance the \nentire foreign exchange cost of $24.93 million and $24.37 million equivalent of local currency \ncost or about 94% of the total cost. The Government will finance the remaining local currency \ncost of $3.29 million equivalent, which includes taxes and duties. Cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 9. \n \nE.

The start-up activities will be completed \nwithin 6 months of loan effectiveness, including (i) recruitment of consultants; (ii) finalization of \nsubproject assessment, prioritization, and selection criteria; (iii) selection of subprojects; and (iv) \nprocurement of immediately required works including processing for retroactive financing.  \n \n  3.  Procurement  \n \n11.  Civil works contracts and procurement of goods and services will follow local competitive \nbidding procedures in accordance with ADB Guidelines for Procurement.  \n \n  4.  Consulting Services \n \n12.  Domestic consulting services are required, comprising road engineer, building/structural \nengineer,  environment  specialist,  resettlement  specialist,  construction  manager,  and  field \nengineers, for (i) overseeing subproject proposal preparation; (ii) advising on technical studies \nand  disaster  resistant  design;  (iii)  monitoring  and  quality  control;  (iv)  helping  with  public \nparticipation; and (v) assisting with reports and other ADB requirements, including safeguards.  \n \n  5.  Monitoring and Quality Control  \n \n13.  For  effective  management  of  subproject  planning,  implementation  monitoring,  and \nquality control, each subproject will have a subproject implementation plan that sets out distinct \nprocesses and outputs, including impact indicators in their subproject plan. Those indicators will \nbe monitored through a project performance monitoring system for the Project, comprising the \nsystems of effective recording and reporting at the field level, and monitoring and auditing at the \nIA and PMU level with the assistance of consultants. Beneficiaries will also be involved in \nproject monitoring and evaluation, through direct reporting to the PMU.  \n \n  6.  Sustainable Operation and Maintenance \n \n14.  The  concerned  panchayat  and  municipality  is  responsible  for  the  O&M  of  the \nconstructed facilities for roads, stormwater drainage, and public buildings, while Tamil Nadu \nElectricity  Board  and  Kerala  State  Electricity  Board  are  responsible  for  O&M  of  power \ndistribution with revenue collection. In Tamil Nadu, the Rural Development Department has \nbeen increasing budget allocations for village infrastructure maintenance in recent years, with \npanchayats provided with higher incentives in terms of tax recovery and use of annual budget \nfor maintenance purposes. Replacement of lost assets (roads and buildings) under the Project \n ", "52  Appendix 8 \nwill  provide  opportunities  for  clearly  defining  O&M  requirements,  responsibilities,  and \narrangements.

If ADB finds \nthat a proposed subproject is not likely to satisfy the eligibility criteria and/or the \nagreed procedures, ADB will advise the PMU either (a) to modify the subproject \nproposal in a manner that will make it eligible for approval or (b) that the subproject \nmust be rejected. If a subproject is rejected, the PMU may propose a replacement \nsubproject. If the proposed subproject satisfies the eligibility criteria and procedures, \nbased  on  the  resettlement  checklist,  ADB  will  advise  on  the  requirements  of \npreparation and application of the resettlement plan.  \n \n(iv)  Following approval of a subproject concept by PMU and ADB, the relevant IA will \nconduct feasibility study and preliminary design or other similar design works, and \nbased on those works, develop a resettlement plan (if required) and undertake an \nIEE including an environmental management plan.  \n \n(v)  The IA will disclose the resettlement plan (if required) and IEE to the affected persons \nand incorporate the results of the consultation. \n \n(vi)  The report of the feasibility study and preliminary design/other design work, including \nthe resettlement plan (if required) and IEE, will be submitted by the IA to the PMU for \nits appraisal. The PMU will appraise the reports in light of the relevant frameworks. \nBased on the review, the PMU will prepare a summary appraisal report for each of \nthe  subprojects.  If  the  PMU  finds  that  one  or  more  proposed  subprojects  are \ntechnically, environmentally, and socially viable, and all reports are in order, the PMU \nwill send those reports, with attachments including the resettlement plan (if required) \nand IEE, to ADB for further review and approval.  \n \n(vii)  ADB will review the summary appraisal reports, together with required attachments. If \nADB finds that the proposed subproject satisfies the eligibility criteria and procedures, \nADB will approve the subproject. If ADB finds that the proposed subproject does not \nsatisfy the eligibility criteria and procedures, or does not comply with sector-specific \ncriteria, and ADB safeguard policies, ADB may advise the PMU on remedial actions \nto be taken for the proposed subproject for it to comply or reject the subproject.  \n \nTable A11: Summary Procedures for Selection and Approval of Subprojects \n Activities  Required Action  Responsibility \n1.

Restoring and improving water supply and sanitation systems, drainage networks, and solid waste \nmanagement activities will reduce incidence of waterborne diseases and improve the environmental quality of \ncoastal districts, as well as the public health and hygiene levels among affected communities. The TEAP will also \nrestore livelihoods of affected households, focusing on women and vulnerable groups. Sector interventions will \npromote wage labor opportunities, consultation, and community participation during project implementation. The \nTEAP will mitigate short- and medium-term increases in the incidence and severity of poverty in tsunami-affected \nareas. It will also contribute to building social capital and community networks and promote disaster preparedness.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                      Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nPoverty and Human Development in Tamil Nadu and Kerala: Poverty incidence in Tamil Nadu (21%; 13.05 \nmillion people) and Kerala (12.72%; 4.1 million people) is well below the national average of 26% in 1999/2000. The \nhuman development index value for Tamil Nadu (0.531) and Kerala (0.638) is higher than the national average of \n0.472. Tamil Nadu and Kerala are among the best performing states in terms of health, education, and other social \ndevelopment indicators. Both the states have a high degree of public participation in political life and higher social \ncapital. Despite the favorable human development indicators of both the states, poverty, and inequality levels are \ndisproportionately and significantly high among several social groups. A recent participatory poverty assessment in \nKerala identified acute poverty concentration among the fishing and coastal communities, tribal households, \nagricultural and urban labor, scheduled castes and tribes, the disabled, and people in traditional industries like coir, \ncashew, hand looming, and stone crushing. In Tamil Nadu, rural poverty is also concentrated among the marginal \nrainfed farmers, agriculture labor, and pockets of coastal communities. Poverty among coastal communities is highly \nvaried,  geographically  interstitial  (fragmented  and  intermittent)  and  socially  differentiated.  It  is  much  less \nconspicuous  among  the  surrounding  coastal  development.  The  coastal  poor  are  socioeconomically  and \nenvironmentally vulnerable due to low coverage and quality of water and sanitation services, and health and \neducation infrastructure. Poverty levels are compounded by income seasonality, informal livelihoods, and chronic \nindebtedness.  Environmental  disasters  like  the  tsunami,  and  frequent  cyclones,  have  further  worsened  the \nvulnerability and coping ability of coastal communities. \n \nDamage, Losses, and Tsunami Impacts: The loss of human lives and personal injuries due to the tsunami in \ncoastal communities were accentuated by the destruction of houses and property, assets and livelihoods, and social \nand transport infrastructure. Widespread destruction at individual and community levels has led to fragmentation of \nfamilies and social networks, and increased the number of vulnerable social groups. The fisherfolk have suffered \nmaximum damage in terms of loss of dwelling units, and household and productive assets like boats and nets. A \nlarge number of microenterprises have been adversely affected by disruptions in supplies and markets, loss of \nincome-generating assets, equipment, and shops. The damage to agriculture and livestock, though not significant, \nhas also affected the livelihoods of coastal communities. Small and marginal farmers, agricultural laborers, and \nother social groups who depend on agriculture, horticulture, and aquaculture have been severely affected by the \ndestruction of standing crops and livestock and salinization of agricultural land and water sources. Landless and \nother casual labor engaged in seasonal employment and other intermittent activities for subsistence have also \nsuffered loss of employment and wages. Increases in the number of orphaned and separated children, adolescent \ngirls, single parent households, households headed by women, and elderly and disabled without social care has \nincreased the vulnerability of the poor. Destruction of water supply and sanitation systems and salinization of wells \nhas worsened the already low coverage of sanitation in coastal villages. Destruction of roads, bridges, and culverts \nhas disrupted mobility and accessibility of the affected communities to essential social, economic, and relief \nservices. The damaged infrastructure poses environmental and health risks and will further reduce the pace of \nsocial and economic development in the affected communities. The poverty impact of the tsunami is localized and \nexperienced more severely at the village and community levels, especially for households involved in fishing, \nagriculture, horticulture, aquaculture, and microenterprises. Since damage is largely confined to rural areas, the \nincidence and severity of rural poverty is likely to increase among the affected communities. The number of below \npoverty line families is likely to increase in the short and medium term. Families above the poverty line are expected \n ", "66  Appendix 13 \nto slide below the poverty line. The number of poor people could increase if water supply, sanitation, health, and \nlivelihood needs are not addressed immediately.  \n \nProject Benefits and Impacts: Based on the short- and medium-term recovery and reconstruction strategy \noutlined in the joint assessment review report, the TEAP will provide emergency assistance to support the ongoing \ngovernment  and  private  sector  efforts  to  restore  damaged  social  and  economic  infrastructure,  and  restore \nlivelihoods  of  affected  communities  in  Tamil  Nadu  and  Kerala.  The  livelihoods  component  will  restore  the \nmicroenterprises of poor and low-income households through capacity building, enterprise and skills training, and \nsupport for economic activities. Those affected will be mobilized into existing and new self-help groups and provided \ncapital for income-generating activities and replacement of assets. In addition, the vulnerability of the poor and low-\nincome households will be mitigated through available life and property insurance schemes. The rural and municipal \ninfrastructure component will rehabilitate/upgrade rural and municipal infrastructure and provide related services for \nthe  tsunami-affected  communities.  Restored  and  improved  water  supply  to  the  perennially  water-stressed \ncommunities will reduce the chronic water poverty and vulnerability1 of the coastal poor. By providing improved and \nsustainable drinking water supplies, and improving the sanitation coverage, the TEAP will significantly improve \npublic health and reduce morbidity from potential waterborne diseases. It will also reduce women\u2019s drudgery in \ncollection/storage of water, and accrue improved health, health care, and productivity benefits to the communities, \nespecially the women. The sanitation and solid waste subcomponents will improve the environmental conditions in \ncoastal habitations. Reconstruction of the village and panchayat/municipal roads and small-scale infrastructure, \nsuch as rural markets and fish-loading facilities, will improve local access to essential services and productive public \nassets, and support local livelihoods through labor opportunities during the implementation. The transportation \ncomponent will restore state and district roads and bridges and repairs ports and harbors, which will enable the \naffected populations to resume their social and economic activities. The coastal population will be able to access \nessential health, education, and emergency and other government welfare and relief services. Restored transport \nlinkages  will  support  the  livelihood  restoration  activities  by  facilitating  physical  access  to  local  fishing  and \ncommodities markets, wage labor, and other alternative livelihood opportunities. Improved access to evacuation \nroutes, emergency relief measures, and disaster shelters will increase a sense of physical security among the \npeople. Increased familial and community interaction will reduce the vulnerability of the affected households and \nprovide a sense of social security. The ports and fishing harbors subcomponent will support restoration of labor and \nlivelihood opportunities for those engaged in fisheries, boat building, and other port operations.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nTEAP preparation involved the identification and consultation of key primary and secondary project stakeholders, \nespecially during the joint assessment of needs and damages. The key primary stakeholders are the tsunami-\naffected coastal communities in the 345 affected villages in Tamil Nadu and 187 villages in Kerala. Other primary \nstakeholders are small farmers, wage labor, women engaged in trading and other microenterprises, self-help group \n(SHG) members, scheduled caste and scheduled tribes households; poor and low income households; and other \nvulnerable groups like the orphans, adolescent girls, and households headed by women. The key secondary or \ninstitutional stakeholders include the government of Tamil Nadu, department of rural development, Tamil Nadu \nWater and Drainage Board, department of special village panchayats, affected panchayats and local bodies, \nhighways department, commisionerate of municipal affairs, Tamil Nadu Corporation of Women\u2019s Development \nLimited, pollution control board, electricity board, department of finance, department of health, department of ports \nand fisheries, and maritime board. In Kerala, the secondary stakeholders include the Government of Kerala, \ndepartment of disaster management, department of finance, fisheries department, the Kerala Water Authority, \npoverty alleviation agencies such as Kudumbashree, department of local self governance, affected panchayats and \nlocal  bodies,  department  of  power,  the  public  works  department.  Civil  society  including  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), community groups, and other international agencies engaged in relief and reconstruction are \nthe other secondary stakeholders.   \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nA community participation strategy is integrated into the overall project design. The reconstruction and recovery \nstrategy emphasizes (i) utilizing decentralized and transparent decision making and community participation, in \nparticular for women; (ii) providing employment opportunities for the tsunami-affected communities; (iii) building \ngood working relationships with the implementing departments, community-based structures such as SHGs and \nNGOs; and (iv) strengthening sustainable operation and maintenance capacity of the concerned communities and \nlocal  government  institutions.  Participatory  approaches  will  be  encouraged  in  designing  subprojects, \nimplementation, operation and maintenance, and monitoring and evaluation arrangements. The process will involve \ninformation  sharing,  consultations,  interviews,  focus  group  meetings,  and  collaborative  decision-making.  The \n                                                 \n1  Water supply in coastal areas suffers from low per capita supply and high content of fluoride, sodium and iron, with \nshallow wells facing high level of salinity in dry seasons. \n ", "Appendix 13  67 \nsubproject selection criteria includes targeting of most affected groups, especially women and the newly vulnerable \ngroups; community consultations on subprojects; practical and feasible mechanisms for local communities to \nparticipate in reconstruction works; preferential use of local labor; and local procurement for livelihood support.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: The TEAP will restore and improve women\u2019s access to income-\ngenerating activities, essential social services, community structures, decision-making mechanisms, and other local \nrecovery and reconstruction-related information. Improved water and sanitation infrastructure and other public \nservices will accrue health and health care benefits to women and their families and provide more time for \nproductive income-generating activities by reducing the drudgery in collecting water. The livelihoods component is \ndesigned as a targeted intervention to promote social and economic empowerment among the coastal women by \nenabling them to regain and improve their lost incomes, upgrade their technical and business skills, access internal \ngroup savings for production/consumption needs, access institutional credit, and mobilize and involve themselves \nthrough women\u2019s organizations.

The Tsunami Emergency Assistance (Sector) Project (TEAP) includes (i) rehabilitation of \nTamil Nadu state roads and standardization of major district roads and bridges; (ii) rehabilitation \nof fully and partially damaged rural and municipal infrastructure such as water supply, sanitation, \ndrainage,  internal  roads,  power  transmission  lines,  street  lighting,  and  public  buildings;  (iii) \nrehabilitation of ports and harbors; and (iv) capacity building and implementation assistance. The \nTEAP emphasizes the mitigation of immediate losses of priority assets by rehabilitating fully or \npartially damaged basic infrastructure.  \n \n2.  Land acquisition and resettlement impacts are envisaged for the TEAP in Tamil Nadu. \nThe bridge in Kanyakumari, if it cannot be rebuilt on the original alignment, will have to be \nrealigned. The government\u2019s decision as to whether the bridge can be rebuilt on the original \nalignment or requires a new alignment is still under consideration. Most rehabilitation work will \nbe carried out within the original right-of-way, while the improvement of several major district and \ninternal roads might require acquisition of narrow strips of land. Construction of emergency \nevacuation routes may also necessitate small-scale land acquisition and could cause temporary \nacquisition, disruptions, and losses. No land acquisition or resettlement impacts are envisaged \nfor the rehabilitation of rural and municipal infrastructure, power transmission lines, ports and \nharbors, and street lighting. Rehabilitation and construction of new public buildings such as \ncommunity centers, panchayat offices, and anganwadi centers might require small-scale land \nacquisition, if government land is not available. \n \n3.  With regard to the provision of emergency assistance to tsunami-affected people, the \nTEAP ensures that all will benefit on an equitable basis. Among those affected are scheduled \ntribe populations. Initial needs assessment did not identify likely adverse effects arising from \ntheir status as scheduled tribe. The TEAP will have no impacts on their tribal and cultural identity \nor on their social and economic institutions. However, if impacts on them are identified during \nTEAP implementation, such impacts will be addressed through specific actions, as necessary. \nSuch specific action will be formulated according to the approved resettlement framework (RF) \nfor the TEAP.  \n \n4.  The TEAP will be implemented as a sector project and the RF outlines the broad scope \nof the TEAP\u2019s resettlement policies, procedures, and institutional requirements. Resettlement \nplans (RPs) and specific actions for subprojects that will have involuntary resettlement and \nindigenous peoples issues will be prepared according to the RF during project implementation. \n \nA.  Policy Framework and Entitlements \n \n5.   In February 2004, the Government of India approved the National Policy on Resettlement \nand Rehabilitation (NPRR). The policy provides broad guidelines and executive instructions and \nwill be applicable to projects displacing 500 families or more in flat lands and 250 families or \nmore  in  hilly  areas.  The  NPRR  requires  projects  to  (i)  minimize  displacement  and  identify \nnondisplacing or least-displacing alternatives; (ii) plan the resettlement and rehabilitation of \nproject-affected families including special needs of tribal and vulnerable sections; (iii) provide a \nbetter standard of living to project-affected families; and (iv) facilitate harmonious relationships \nbetween the requiring body and project-affected families through mutual cooperation. While the \nNPRR recognizes most of the significant resettlement principles in the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB) Involuntary Resettlement Policy (IRP), the NPRR does not meet some of the IRP\u2019s \nsafeguards.  First,  the  NPRR\u2019s  threshold  of  applicability  is  limited  to  land  acquisitions  for \nhighways, railway lines, transmission lines, and pipelines. Second, each project-affected family \nwill be offered an ex-gratia payment of Rs10,000 and no other resettlement and rehabilitation \nbenefits.  Third,  replacement  value  is  not  clearly  defined  and  is  not  taken  into  account  in \n ", "Appendix 14  69 \ncalculating lump-sum compensation. Fourth, no specific entitlements are available for squatters \nand encroachers.  \n \n6.  The Land Acquisition Act 1894 and its amendments to date generally governs land \nacquisition and compensation in Tamil Nadu. The Act covers only legal titleholders and provides \nfor (i) market value of the land; (ii) compensation of 30% on the market value for compulsory \nacquisition; (iii) an additional amount for trees, crops, houses, or other immovable properties; (iv) \ndamage due to severing of land, residence, or place of business; and (v) an interest of 12% on \nthe  market  value  from  the  date  of  notification  to  award.  The  IRP  has  some  additional \ncomplementary provisions especially with regard to displacement and resettlement of squatters \nand other informal settlers.  \n \n7.  To reduce inherent delays in the land acquisition process from 18 to 6 months or less, \nthe Government of Tamil Nadu (GOTN) issued a government order in 1995\u2014\u201cAcquisition of \nLand for various purposes, Acquisition through negotiation\u2014Uniformity in procedure, fixation of \nland value and Constitution of Committee.\u201d The order sets out the principles of fixing of land \nvalue for negotiation. It allows negotiations up to 150% of the market value/guideline value for \neach hectare of land. Thus, whenever land must be acquired, GOTN constitutes a district \nnegotiation committee with the district collector as the head with representatives from other line \ndepartments (Revenue, Requisitioning Agency, and Finance), which could sanction up to a total \namount of Rs2,000,000. If the total value of land exceeds Rs2,000,000, a state committee will be \nappointed. When the negotiated value exceeds 150% of the market value/guideline value for \neach hectare of land, each negotiation, irrespective of the total cost, is referred to the concerned \nadministrative department of GOTN through the commissioner of land administration for final \norders.  The  negotiation  takes  place  between  a  willing  seller  and  GOTN.  Thus,  when  the \nnegotiated value exceeds the amount that can be sanctioned by the district collector or the state \ncommittee, it is referred to the concerned administrative department of GOTN for final orders. A \nseller who is not in agreement with the amount of compensation offered can withdraw from the \nnegotiation.1\n \n8.  Based on these state laws and regulation on land acquisition, the ADB IRP and the \nNPRR, the following resettlement principles will be applied to all TEAP subprojects:2 (i) land \nacquisition and other involuntary resettlement impacts will be minimized as much as possible; (ii) \nwherever possible, Government land will be utilized which is free from encumbrances and will \nnot include land that is squatted upon; (iii) those affected will be informed and consulted on \ncompensation options and in formulating the RPs in accordance with the agreed RF; (iv) land \nand  other  property  compensation  will  be  paid  at  replacement  costs;  (v)  payment  of \ncompensation for lost land, housing, assets, and other resettlement assistance will be given in \nfull before awarding civil contracts; (vi) compensation at replacement cost and resettlement \nassistance will be given to all nontitled people affected (e.g., informal dwellers/squatters, and \nencroachers) before acquiring land and their  properties; (vii) all those affected will receive \nassistance to restore their income and to rehabilitate their livelihood; and (viii) special assistance \nwill be given to households headed by women and other vulnerable groups.  \n \n9.  In case of land acquisition, compensation will be paid at mutually agreed rates through \nnegotiations as outlined in the 1995 government order at replacement costs. In the event the \n                                                 \n1  For purposes of housing and housing related infrastructure in February 2005, GOTN issued G.O. Ms. No. 75 which \nenabled GOTN to direct District Level Negotiation Committees to purchase lands through private negotiations up to \na maximum of 200% of the market value or guidelines value, whichever is lower, without any monetary ceiling for \nthe rehabilitation of tsunami affected people. \n2  The Executing Agency will be responsible to ensure compliance/clearances with relevant government laws and \nregulation, if any, in addition to what is stated in the RF. \n \n ", "70  Appendix 14 \nlandowner does not agree to acquisition through negotiation and the land is acquired as per the \nLand Acquisition Act, compensation will be paid at replacement costs. If the compensation \namount assessed by a district collector is lower than that of the replacement cost determined by \nthe land acquisition and valuation committee, the difference will be paid in the form of a special \ngrant  to  the  affected  person.  The  Government  will  bear  transaction  costs  such  as \nstamps/registration costs in case of purchase of replacement land. Nontitled affected people will \nbe entitled to both compensation and rehabilitation assistance based on the nature of their \nlosses. Replacement cost of structures will also be paid to squatters/informal dwellers, and \nresettlement  assistance,  such  as  shifting  allowance  and  compensation  for  loss  of \nworkdays/income.

Through its project management unit (PMU) it \nwill be responsible for overall coordination, planning, implementation, monitoring, and financing \nof all resettlement and rehabilitation activities. RADMMD, through the PMU and through the \nimplementing agencies (IAs), will prepare RPs for each subproject that will have a resettlement \nimpact or impact on indigenous peoples or both. The RPs will be prepared in accordance with \nthis agreed RF and in compliance with the ADB IRP. The IAs with the assistance from the social \ndevelopment and resettlement specialist under the design and supervision consultants and \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) will carry out social impact assessment surveys and \nundertake census, asset inventory, and detailed measurement surveys for each subproject. If \nimpacts are found to be \u201csignificant,\u201d3 a full RP will be prepared for each subproject and if \nimpacts are less than significant, a short RP will be prepared for that subproject. The RP will \ninclude measures to ensure that socioeconomic conditions, needs, and priorities of women are \nidentified,  and  that  the  process  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  not  disadvantage \nwomen. If new categories of affected people and types of losses are identified, entitlements will \nbe included in accordance with the IRP. RPs will be prepared in close consultation with those \naffected and will be disclosed to them. RADMMD will review the RPs and submit them to ADB \nfor review and approval. No civil work contract will be awarded before the approval of the RP by \nADB. If any impacts on the indigenous people are identified, they will be addressed adequately \nthrough specific action as outlined in the entitlement matrix. \n \nC.  Institutional Responsibilities \n \n12.  The  Revenue  Administration,  Disaster  Management  and  Mitigation  Department \n(RADMMD)  at  the  state-level  will  be  the  EA  of  the  TEAP,  while  the  State  Level  Steering \nCommittee (SLSC) will have the overall advice and guidance with the departments and the IAs. \nThe PMU formed within RADMMD and headed by the project director will be responsible for \noverall coordination, planning, implementation, monitoring, and financing of all resettlement and \nrehabilitation activities under the TEAP. RADMMD will depute an official within the PMU to be in \ncharge of land acquisition and resettlement operations, and will report to the project director. \nEach  IA  in  their  project  implementation  unit  will  also  have  qualified  social/resettlement \nprofessionals.  The  social  development  and  resettlement  specialist  will  assist  the  PMU  and \nIAs/line departments in preparing RPs. The project director will recruit and appoint local NGOs, \n                                                 \n3   Involuntary resettlement category A: Significant means 200 or more people will experience major impacts which are \ndefined as (i) being physically displaced from housing, or (ii) losing 10% or more of their productive assets (income \ngenerating).  Category  A  projects  require  a  full  resettlement  plan.  Involuntary  resettlement  Category  B:  Not \nsignificant include involuntary resettlement impacts that are not deemed significant and require a short resettlement \nplan. \n ", "Appendix 14  73 \nas required, to help prepare and implement resettlement activities. The concerned staff at the \nPMU, IAs/field offices, project NGOs, and revenue department officials will undergo a week long \norientation and training in resettlement policy and management. The deputed official in the PMU \nwith the assistance from the social development and resettlement specialist will work in close \ncoordination  with  the  respective  IAs  and  project  NGOs  on  the  day-to-day  activities  of  RP \nimplementation.  \n \n13.  A land value assessment for the project committee headed by the district collector or \nhis/her representative will also be formed with representatives from RADMMD, IAs, district/tehsil \nLand  Revenue  office,  representatives  of  those  affected,  local  government,  village  leaders, \nprofessional assessors, and implementing NGO to assess replacement value of lost assets \nthrough  a  land  market  value  survey  and  through  compiling  and  comparing  other  available \nsources  of  information.4  RADMMD  will  ensure  that  any  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement/relocation is preceded by a satisfactory RP, formulated according to the agreed RF. \nRADMMD will also ensure that appropriate entitlements and mitigation measures are included in \nthe RP especially for the benefit of vulnerable groups\u2014households headed by women, below \npoverty line, scheduled caste/scheduled tribes, the elderly, and disabled. The PMU will submit \nRPs  for  ADB  review  and  approval,  and  will  ensure  that  affected  persons  will  receive \ncompensation and other entitlements before civil work contracts are awarded. \n \nD.  Implementation Schedule and Budget \n \n14.  The resettlement plans for all subprojects will be prepared and implemented from June \n2005 to December 2006. GOTN will cover all costs related to land acquisition and resettlement \nbudgets.  All  compensation  and  resettlement  assistance  will  be  paid  prior  to  displacement. \nRADMMD  will  ensure  that  funds  are  delivered  on  time  to  the  district  collector  and  the \nimplementing NGOs for timely RP implementation.  \n \nE.  Disclosure, Consultation, and Grievances \n \n15.  In preparing an RP, all stakeholders will be consulted by RADMMD through focus group \ndiscussions and meetings. The RPs will be made available in the local language(s) during \nmeetings in the various communities and will be disclosed to all affected persons. Summary RPs \nwill  be  disclosed  on  the  ADB  Involuntary  Resettlement  Website.  Consultations  with  those \naffected will continue throughout project implementation. \n16.  Grievance redress committees will be established in each administrative district, with \nrepresentation  from  RADMMD,  IAs,  people  affected,  women/vulnerable  groups,  local \ngovernment, and NGOs chaired by the district collector or his/her representative, e.g., additional \ndistrict magistrate in charge of land acquisition. Through public consultations, those affected will \nbe informed that they have a right to grievance redress. They can call upon the support of NGOs \nto assist them in presenting their grievances or queries to the grievance redress committee, \nwhich are expected to settle many grievances. The committees must resolve grievances within a \nstipulated  time.  Their  decision  will  be  binding  unless  challenged  by  a  court  of  law.  The \ncommittees  will  meet  at  least  four  times  a  month  during  the  first  6  months  of  project \nimplementation, and twice a month from the seventh month.  \n                                                 \n4  District Level Monitoring Committees and Village Level Monitoring Committees will be extensively utilized for this \npurpose. \n ", "74  Appendix 14 \n \nF.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n17.  RADMMD  will  establish  a  monthly  monitoring  system  and  prepare  monthly  progress \nreports  on  all  aspects  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities.  The  report  will  contain \nprogress made in RP implementation with particular attention to monitoring and the delivery of \nentitlements. The deputed official in charge of land acquisition and resettlement in the PMU with \nassistance from the social development and resettlement specialist, through the IAs, field offices, \nand  NGOs  will  monitor  the  progress  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  and  also  prepare \nbiannual reports, forwarding them to ADB for review. ADB review mission back-to-office reports \nwill include progress in resettlement plan implementation. \n ", "Appendix 15  75 \n \nRESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n(KERALA) \n \n1.  The Tsunami Emergency Assistance (Sector) Project (TEAP) consists of (i) construction \nof small bridges on evacuation routes; (ii) rehabilitation and standardization of major district \nroads and other district roads; (iii) rehabilitation and rebuilding of fully and partially damaged \nrural and municipal infrastructure, such as water supply, sanitation, drainage, internal roads, \npower transmission lines, street lighting, and public buildings; (iv) rehabilitation of ports and \nharbors;  and  (v)  capacity  building  and  implementation  assistance.  The  TEAP  emphasizes \nmitigation  of  immediate  losses  of  priority  assets  through  rehabilitation  of  fully  or  partially \ndamaged basic infrastructure. The Department of Disaster Management (DMD)  will be the \nExecuting Agency.  \n \n2.  Land acquisition and resettlement impacts for the TEAP are envisaged in Kerala. The \nconstruction of three emergency evacuation bridges for disaster preparedness in Allapuzha and \nKollam districts could require the acquisition of private land triggering resettlement impacts. \nHowever,  as  improvement  of  major  district  roads  and  other  district  roads  to  accepted \nengineering standards will be carried out on their existing right-of-way, only narrow strips of land \nwill need to be acquired at several locations. Resettlement impact of rehabilitation of rural and \nmunicipal infrastructure, power transmission lines, and ports and harbors are expected to be \nminimal. Rehabilitation and construction of new public buildings such as community centers, \npanchayat  offices,  and  anganwadi  centers  might  require  small-scale  land  acquisition,  if \ngovernment land is not available. \n3.  Scheduled tribe populations are among the tsunami-affected. Initial need assessment, \nhowever, did not identify any likely adverse effects on them. However, if any adverse impacts on \nthem are identified during TEAP implementation, they will be addressed through specific actions, \nlisted in resettlement framework (RF), as necessary.  \n \n4.  The  RF  outlines  the  broad  scope  of  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  resettlement \npolicies  and  procedures  that  are  applicable  to  the  TEAP,  and  institutional  requirements  to \nimplement the TEAP. Resettlement plans (RPs) and specific actions, if any, will be prepared \naccording to the agreed RF during TEAP implementation. \n \nA.  Policy Framework and Entitlements \n \n5.  The Government of India in February 2004 approved the National Policy on Resettlement \nand Rehabilitation (NPRR). The policy provides broad guidelines and executive instructions, and \nwill be applicable to projects displacing 500 families or more in flat lands and 250 families or \nmore  in  hilly  areas.  The  NPRR  requires  projects  to  (i)  minimize  displacement  and  identify \nnondisplacing or least-displacing alternatives; (ii) plan the resettlement and rehabilitation of \nproject-affected families, including special needs of tribal and vulnerable sections; (iii) provide a \nbetter standard of living to project-affected families; and (iv) facilitate harmonious relationships \nbetween the requiring body and project-affected families through mutual cooperation. The NPRR \ndoes not meet some of key safeguards of the ADB Involuntary Resettlement Policy (IRP). First, \nthe NPRR\u2019s threshold of applicability is limited to land acquisitions for highways, railway lines, \ntransmission lines, and pipelines. Second, each project-affected family will be offered an ex-\ngratia  payment  of  Rs10,000  and  no  other  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  benefits.  Third, \nreplacement value is not clearly defined and is not taken into account in calculating lump-sum \ncompensation. Fourth, no specific entitlements are available for squatters and encroachers. On \nthe other hand, the NPRR does recognize some of the significant resettlement principles that are \nenshrined in the IRP.  \n ", "76  Appendix 15 \n \n6.  The Land Acquisition Act of 1894 and its amendments to date generally govern land \nacquisition and compensation in Kerala. The act covers only legal land titleholders and provides \nfor (i) market value of land; (ii) compensation of 30% on the market value for compulsory \nacquisition; (iii) additional compensation for trees, crops, houses, or other immovable properties; \n(iv) damage due to severing of land, residence, or place of business; and (v) an interest of 12% \non  the  total  compensation  agreed  from  the  date  of  notification  to  the  award.  The  IRP \ncomplements the Land Acquisition Act, especially with regard to displacement and resettlement \nof squatters and other informal settlers.  \n \n7.  The Government of Kerala (GOK) has adopted the Rehabilitation and Resettlement \nPrinciples and Policy Framework for fast-track projects, which are in line with the ADB IRP. The \npolicy principles state that (i) all acquisition of private land will be under the Land Acquisition Act \nand  compensation  paid  under  the  Act  will  be  supplemented  with  further  rehabilitation  and \nresettlement support to meet replacement value of all assets and to improve the standard of \nliving of those affected; (ii) common property resources will be replaced as far as feasible, and \nassistance will be provided at replacement value to the community if replacement fails; (iii) \nbefore taking possession of acquired lands and properties, all compensation and resettlement \nand rehabilitation and related activities will be completed in accordance with the policy; (iv) every \neffort will be made to ensure that new housing for all affected persons is available before people \nare  required  to  relocate;  (v)  if  those  affected  are  unable  to  continue  with  their  previous \noccupations, they will be provided with support and assistance through alternative employment \nstrategies; (vi) land compensation will not be extended to encroachers and squatters, but they \nwill be provided with rehabilitation and resettlement assistance; (vii) people affected will be \ninvolved in planning, implementation, and monitoring of the project; (viii) RPs will be translated \ninto local languages and disclosed to all those affected; and (ix) vulnerable groups including \nthose  living  below  poverty  line,  scheduled  caste,  scheduled  tribe,  households  headed  by \nwomen,  orphans,  destitutes,  and  the  disabled  will  be  provided  with  suitable  additional \nrehabilitation assistance.  \n \n8.  As per the approved Guidelines for Accelerating Land Acquisition for fast-track projects, \nGOK has resorted to direct purchase of land from land titleholders. The process is initiated \nthrough the issuance of the notification under section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, and \nsection 6(1) of the Survey and Boundaries Act, 1961. The land price is arrived at by taking \nrecourse to three systems: (i) taking into account the prescribed rates or the average of the \nactual  transaction  rates  of  similar  lands  for  contemporary  years  for  which  sale  deeds  are \nregistered; (ii) taking into consideration 20 times of the annual value of gross production of the \nconcerned land, averaged over the preceding 5 years; and (iii) fixing market value of land equal \nto the minimum land value if so prescribed by state government under the Indian Stamp Act for \nthe  purpose  of  registration  of  sale  deeds  under  the  Indian  Registration  Act  of  1908.  The \nreplacement value is fixed at whichever is the highest among the three amounts arrived at using \nthe  three  alternate  methods.  In  case  replacement  value  is  higher  than  the  market  value \ndetermined by the district collector, the difference will be paid in the form of assistance by the \nproject. Direct purchase methods in fast-track projects are applicable to all cases of transfer of \nland to the ownership of the project authority in which a land titleholder is willing to enter into a \ndirect sale deed. The land acquisition proceedings initiated in respect of the parcels of land are \nthen withdrawn through a notification under section 48 of the Land Acquisition Act, wherein the \ngovernment can withdraw from acquisition of any land of which possession has not been taken. \nIn cases where direct purchase cannot be effected for any specific reason, procedures under the \nLand Acquisition Act is continued leading to passing of award under the Act and provision of \nadditional rehabilitation and resettlement assistance. \n \n ", "Appendix 15  77 \n9.  Based  on  the  above  state  laws  and  regulation  on  land  acquisition,  ADB  Policy  on \nInvoluntary Resettlement,1  the  NPRR,  Rehabilitation  and  Resettlement  Policy of  Fast-Track \nProjects, and Guidelines for Accelerating Land Acquisition adopted by the government, the \nfollowing resettlement principles will be applied to all TEAP subprojects:2 (i) land acquisition and \nother involuntary resettlement impacts will be minimized as much as possible; (ii) wherever \npossible, Government land will be utilized that is free from encumbrances and will not include \nland that is squatted upon; (iii) affected people will be informed and consulted on compensation \noptions and in formulating RPs in accordance with the agreed RF; (iv) land and other property \ncompensation will be paid at replacement cost; (v) payment of compensation for lost land, \nhousing, assets, and other resettlement assistance will be given in full before awarding civil \ncontracts; (vi) compensation at replacement cost, and resettlement and relocation assistance will \nbe given to all nontitled people affected (e.g., informal dwellers/squatters, and encroachers) \nbefore acquiring land and their properties; (vii) all those affected will get assistance to restore \ntheir income and to rehabilitate their livelihood; and (viii) special assistance to households \nheaded by women and other vulnerable groups. \n \n10.  In case of land acquisition, compensation will be paid at a mutually agreed rate that is \nreplacement value following the methods of land price determination mentioned in para 8. If land \nis acquired as per the Land Acquisition Act, compensation will be paid at replacement costs. If \nthe compensation amount assessed by a district collector is lower than that of the replacement \ncost as assessed by the Land Assessment Value Committee, the difference will be paid in the \nform of a special grant to the affected person. The Government will bear transaction costs such \nas stamps/registration costs in case of purchase of replacement land. Nontitled affected persons \nwill be entitled to both compensation and rehabilitation assistance based on the nature of their \nlosses.  Replacement  cost  of  structure  will  also  be  paid  to  squatters/informal  dwellers  and \nrelocation and resettlement assistance such as shifting allowance and compensation for loss of \nworkdays/income. Households headed by women and other vulnerable households (such as \nscheduled tribe/scheduled caste, disabled, elderly) will be eligible for additional assistance in \nterms of income restoration. \n \n11.

Procedure for Resettlement Plan Preparation \n \n12.  DMD/the project management unit (PMU), through the implementing agencies3 (IAs) will \nprepare RPs for each subproject that will have resettlement impacts or impacts on indigenous \npeoples, or both. The RPs will be prepared in accordance with this agreed RF and in compliance \nwith the ADB IRP. The IAs with the assistance from social development and resettlement \nspecialist  under  the  design  and  supervision  consultants,  and  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs) will carry out social impact assessment surveys and undertake census, asset inventory, \nand detailed measurement surveys for each subproject. If impacts are found to be \u201csignificant,\u201d4 \na full RP will be prepared for each subproject and if impacts are less than significant, a short RP \nwill be prepared. The RP will include measures to ensure that socioeconomic conditions, needs, \nand priorities of women are identified; and that the process of land acquisition and resettlement \nwill not disadvantage women. If new categories of affected people and types of losses are \nidentified, their entitlements will be included in RPs in accordance with the agreed RF and IRP. \nRPs will be prepared in close consultation with all those affected and will be disclosed to them in \na language that they could understand. DMD will review all RPs; and submit all RPs to ADB for \nreview and approval. No civil works contract will be awarded before approval of an RP by ADB. \nAny impacts on indigenous peoples identified will be adequately addressed through specific \nactions, as outlined in the entitlement matrix of the agreed RF.  \n \nC.  Institutional Responsibilities \n \n13.  The PMU will be formed within DMD and headed by a project director. The PMU will be \nresponsible  for  overall  coordination,  planning,  implementation,  monitoring,  and  financing  all \nresettlement and rehabilitation activities under the Project. DMD will depute an official within the \nPMU to be in charge of land acquisition and resettlement operations, and report to the project \ndirector.  Each  IA  will  have  a  project  implementation  unit  with  qualified  social/resettlement \nprofessionals. The social development and resettlement specialist will assist the PMU and IAs \n/line departments in preparing RPs. The project director will recruit and appoint local NGOs, as \nrequired, to assist in preparing and implementing resettlement activities. The concerned PMU \nstaff, IAs/field offices, project NGOs, and revenue department officials will undergo a week-long \norientation and training in resettlement policy and management. The deputed official in the PMU, \nwith the assistance from the social development and resettlement specialist, will work in close \ncoordination  with  the  respective  IAs  and  project  NGO/s  on  the  day-to-day  activities  of  RP \nimplementation. A land value assessment committee headed by the district collector or his/her \nrepresentative will be formed with representatives from DMD, IAs, district/Tehsil land revenue \noffice,  representatives  from  people  affected,  local  government,  village  leaders,  professional \nassessors and implementing NGO to assess replacement value of lost assets through a land \nmarket value survey following the systems of assessments mentioned in para. 8. \n14.  DMD will ensure that any land acquisition and resettlement/relocation is preceded by a \nsatisfactory RP, formulated according to the agreed RF. DMD will also ensure that appropriate \nentitlements  and  mitigation  measures  are  included  in  the  RP,  especially  for  the  benefit  of \nvulnerable  groups:  households  headed  by  women,  below  the  poverty  line,  scheduled \ncaste/scheduled tribes, the elderly, and disabled. The PMU will submit RPs for ADB review and \napproval,  and  will  ensure  that  those  affected  receive  compensation  and  other  entitlements \nbefore civil work contracts are awarded. \n                                                 \n3  IAs include Department of Fisheries and Cooperatives, Ports/Harbor Engineering Department, Kerala State \nElectricity Board, Kerala Water Authority, Public Works Department, and Rural Development Department. \n4   Involuntary Resettlement Category A: Significant means 200 or more people will experience major impacts, defined \nas (i) being physically displaced from housing, or (ii) losing 10% or more of their productive assets (income \ngenerating). Category A projects require a full resettlement plan. Involuntary Resettlement Category B: Not \nsignificant  includes  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  that  are  not  deemed  significant  and  require  a  short \nresettlement plan. \n ", "Appendix 15  81 \n \nD.  Implementation Schedule and Budget \n \n15.  The resettlement plans for all subprojects will be prepared and implemented from July \n2005 to December 2006. All costs related to land acquisition and purchases will be borne by \nGOK. DMD will ensure that sufficient funds are delivered on time to the district collector to \ndisburse to those affected. The project implementing NGOs will monitor the acquisition, land \npurchase, and payment of replacement value to those affected. Land acquisition and payment of \ncompensation and other special rehabilitation and resettlement assistance will begin as soon as \nthe Project is approved and will be completed within 2 years.  \n \nE.  Disclosure, Consultation, and Grievances \n \n16.  In preparing an RP, DMD will consult all stakeholders through focus group discussions \nand  meetings.  Once  the  draft  RPs  are  formulated,  they  will  be  made  available  in  local \nlanguage(s) to all people affected. RPs will be disclosed on the ADB Involuntary Resettlement \nWebsite. Consultations with those affected will continue throughout project implementation. \n17.  Grievance redress committees will be established in each administrative district. They \nwill  have  representation  from  DMD,  IAs,  people  affected,  women/vulnerable  groups,  local \ngovernment, and NGOs, and be chaired by the district collector or his/her representative e.g., \nadditional district magistrate in charge of land acquisition. Through public consultations, those \naffected will be informed that they have a right to grievance redress. They can enlist NGOs to \nassist them in presenting their grievances or queries to the grievance redress committee. is the \ngrievance redress committees are anticipated to settle most of the grievances. The committees \nmust resolve grievances within a stipulated time, and their decision will be binding unless \nchallenged by a court of law. The committees will meet at least four times a month during the \nfirst 6 months of project implementation, and twice a month from the seventh month.  \n \nF.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n18.  DMD will establish a monthly monitoring system and prepare monthly progress reports \non all aspects of land acquisition, compensation payment, provision of special assistance, and \nother resettlement activities. The reports will contain progress in the delivery of entitlements. The \ndeputed official-in-charge of land acquisition and resettlement at the PMU with the assistance of \nthe social development and resettlement specialist, through IAs, field offices, and NGOs will \nmonitor the progress of land acquisition and resettlement, and prepare biannual reports and \nforward them to ADB for review. ADB review mission back-to-office reports will include progress \nwith resettlement plan implementation.  \n ", "82  Appendix 16 \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  This  initial  environmental  examination  report  aims  to:  (i)  describe  the  Tsunami \nEmergency  Assistance  (Sector)  Project  (TEAP),  (ii)  describe  the  potential  environmental \nimpacts and corresponding mitigation measures, and (iii) explain the environmental assessment \nand review procedures that will be adopted during project implementation. The report was \nprepared following a fact-finding mission to India between 24 February and 11 March 2005, and \nbenefited from the findings of the Joint Assessment Mission.1 The report was prepared in \naccordance  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Environmental  Policy2  and  Disaster  and \nEmergency Assistance Policy.3 The recommendations are consistent with the environmental \nand related legislations of the Government of India. \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n2.  The TEAP is a rehabilitation and reconstruction project that aims to restore livelihoods \nand infrastructure damaged or destroyed by the tsunami. The TEAP will be implemented in the \ntwo southern states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala over 3 years. It comprises three components, (i) \nlivelihoods,  (ii)  transportation,  and  (iii)  rural  and  municipal  infrastructure.  A  number  of \nsubprojects  will  be  included  under  each  of  these  components.  The  detailed  designs  of \nsubprojects will be done during project implementation. In this sense, the overall project is \nconsidered to be sector-like in design. The following sections list indicative subproject activities \nto be considered under each component: \n \n1.  Livelihoods  \n \n3.  This component aims to restore livelihoods of those directly or indirectly affected by the \ntsunami. Activities will include \n \n(i)  developing  microenterprises  through  skills  development  and  microenterprise \nestablishment support to self-help groups of poor and low income households; \n(ii)  forming new self-help groups in affected areas for delivery of microenterprise \ndevelopment support;  \n(iii)  replacing productive assets of damaged microenterprises in affected areas;  \n(iv)  reducing vulnerabilities of the poor through programs such as group insurance \nschemes; and \n(v)  restoring community infrastructure affected by the tsunami. \n \n2.  Transportation \n \n4.  This component seeks to address transportation infrastructure damaged or destroyed by \nthe tsunami. Activities will include rehabilitation and reconstruction of (i) roads and highways, \nand (ii) ports and harbors.  \n                                                 \n1  World Bank, United Nations, and Asian Development Bank.   \n2  ADB. 2003.

Specific interventions include \n \n(i)  rehabilitating or reconstructing badly damaged sections of state highways, major \ndistrict roads, and other district roads; \n(ii)  improving collateral structures such as road shoulders, pavements, protection \nworks, and cross drainage structures; and \n(iii)  constructing several new bridges along evacuation routes. \n \n6.  Ports and Harbors. Specific interventions include \n \n(i)  providing priority dredging of harbor basins and approach channels; \n(ii)  rehabilitating breakwaters and harbor compound walls; \n(iii)  rehabilitating damaged roads and facilities; and \n(iv)  procuring equipment for dredging and improved navigation. \n \n3.  Rural and Municipal Infrastructure \n \n7.  Infrastructure  that  supports  rural  and  municipal  services  will  be  rehabilitated  and \nupgraded. Activities will include \n \n(i)  restoring and upgrading damaged water supply schemes including consolidation \nof schemes and developing new intake sources; \n(ii)  rehabilitating and upgrading sanitary complexes and solid waste management \nfacilities; \n(iii)  supporting sanitation and environmental awareness campaigns; \n(iv)  providing technical support for damage assessment surveys, studies, improved \n(disaster  resistant)  designs,  and  community  participation  in  implementing \nsubprojects; \n(v)  rehabilitating local roads; \n(vi)  rehabilitating  and  upgrading  village/panchayat-level  stormwater  drainage \nfacilities; and  \n(vii)  reconstructing or rehabilitating public buildings such as common fish-landing, \nprocessing, and marketing facilities; community centers; and panchayat offices.  \n \n4.  Capacity Building and Implementation Assistance \n \n8.  The Project will provide technical support for detailed assessment and verification of \ndamage in each of the sectors; preparation of subproject appraisal reports in accordance with \nnational  and  state  government  requirements  and  ADB  requirements  and  selection  criteria; \nincorporation of disaster resistance into the rapid planning, design, and implementation of the \nworks; supervision and monitoring of works to ensure quality control and transparency among \ncontractors  and  communities  carrying  out  smaller  work;  and  oversight  of  works  in  each \nsector/subsector and provision of detailed accounting, auditing, and reporting to the project \nmanagement units and project implementation units.  \n \nC .  Description of the Environment \n \n1.  Physical and Ecological Resources \n \n9.  The state of Tamil Nadu covers an area of just over 130,000 square kilometers (km2). \nand is the 11th largest state in India. It has a coastline of 1,076 km most of which is considered \n ", "84  Appendix 16 \nrural and undeveloped. The state can be broadly divided into two natural regions: the coastal \nplains and the hilly western area. The major rivers are the Cauvery, Tamaraparani, and Vaigai, \nand the west flowing river Periyar. The state has a tropical climate with temperatures ranging \nfrom 28\u201340 \u00b0C during the summer and 18\u201326 \u00b0C during the winter months. Average annual \nrainfall is around 950 millimeters. \n \n10.  Kerala is a little less than 39,000 km2 in area and has a coastline of 590 km. The state \nhas a lush vegetative cover with large tracts of forest. Agriculture and forests together account \nfor 84% of the land area. Kerala lies to the west of the western Ghat mountains. As a result the \nstate receives considerable rainfall (especially during the southwest monsoon) and surface \nwater discharge. The state has an abundance of water resources with over 40 rivers flowing \nthrough it. It also has extensive mineral deposits and rich marine life. \n \n11.  Ecological  resources  in  the  coastal  areas  of  southern  India  have  been  subject  to \nconsiderable  degradation  and  depletion,  primarily  due  to  human-induced  pressures  on  the \nenvironment. Mangrove habitat have reportedly declined by 40% in the last century or so, and \nindigenous dry evergreen forests along the eastern coastal belt have been reduced to about 1% \nof the earlier recorded distribution.  \n \n2.  Human and Economic Development \n \n12.  Tamil Nadu has a population of over 62 million, of which 65% is rural. Population density \nstate-wide is around 480 persons per km2. The population growth rate by the early 1990s was \n2.14%, one of the lowest rates among all the states. Tamil Nadu ranks among the highest of all \nstates in terms of human development indices. Literacy is 73%, second only to Kerala. Infant \nmortality has reduced drastically over the years and stood at 484 by 1999.  \n \n13.  Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy; however, agriculture as a share of the net \ndomestic product of the state has been in decline. Tamil Nadu is one of the most industrialized \nstates in India. In terms of the contribution of manufactured goods to the net domestic product, \nTamil Nadu ranks second among all states. The overall growth rate of the state averaged 6.3% \nper annum during the 1990s. Per capita income of the state is among the top four of all states. \n \n14.  Kerala in one of the most densely populated states of India. The population is over 29 \nmillion, and density is around 750 person per km2. Most of the population is concentrated in the \ncoastal areas, with some human settlements located within 20 meters of the high tide line. \nAround 26% live in urban areas. However, the population growth rate of Kerala is the lowest \namong all states. Kerala leads the country in terms of human development indices, with a \nliteracy rate of 91% and infant mortality of 10.  \n \n15.  Agriculture currently contributes about 13% to the state\u2019s overall income; however, this \npercentage  has  been  declining.  Overall  economic  growth  through  the  1990s  was  5.7%. \nEconomic activity in the project areas is concentrated in fisheries, agriculture, microenterprises, \nand coastal tourism. Kerala contributes the second largest share of the overall fish production of \nIndia. All of these sectors were badly affected by the tsunami.  \n                                                 \n4  Per thousand live births. \n ", "Appendix 16  85 \n \nD.  Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n16.  The  TEAP  primarily  aims  to  rehabilitate  and  reconstruct  infrastructure  damaged  or \ndestroyed  by  the  tsunami  and  to  restore  livelihoods  of  affected  people.  The  negative \nenvironmental impacts of rehabilitation and reconstruction activities will be largely limited to the \nconstruction phase. Given the scale of individual subprojects, these impacts are not likely to be \nsignificant. The infrastructure facilities upgraded by the TEAP will result in certain positive \nenvironmental impacts. In terms of expansion or new construction activities, the TEAP includes \n(i) consolidation and improvement of existing water supply schemes5 and development of new \nintake sources and (ii) construction of new bridges along selected evacuation routes. Siting, \ndesign, and construction of these new structures will be done with due consideration of the \nenvironmental impacts. Potential environmental concerns and benefits of the subprojects are \nsummarized in Table A16.  \n \n17.  Given  the  sector-like  nature  of  the  TEAP,  detailed  subproject  environmental \nassessments  can  be  conducted  only  during  implementation.  Therefore  an  environmental \nassessment and review procedure framework was prepared to outline specific environmental \nassessment and monitoring procedures that will be adopted when preparing and implementing \nsubprojects.  \n \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring \n \n18.  The primary legislation governing environmental assessment of projects in India is the \nEnvironment (Protection) Act (No. 29 of 1986) and rules and notifications issued there under.6 \nOther legislation governs the protection of natural resources and clearance requirements on \nprojects and activities that have a bearing on such resources. These pieces of legislation \ninclude the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess (Amendment) Act (No. 19 of \n2003), the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act (No. 14 of 1981), the Wildlife (Protection) \nAmendment Act (No. 16 of 2003), the Forest (Conservation) Act (amended in 1988), and the \nBiological Diversity Act (No. 18 of 2003). These and overriding policies are available on the web \nsite of the Ministry of Environment and Forests of the Government of India.7  \n \n19.  The Environment (Protection) Act has several notifications pertaining to clearance of \nprojects and activities. The notification on Environmental Clearance\u2014General8 stipulates criteria \nfor projects and activities that require clearance by the Ministry of Environment and Forests of \nthe  Government,  based  on  duly  prepared  environmental  impact  assessments,  and  related \nprocedures. The Coastal Regulations Zone (CRZ) notification,9 governs the authorization for \ndevelopment activities within the zone.10 Within each state the CRZ  is  further  demarcated  into  \n                                                 \n5  Consolidated schemes would have around 25,000 connections.  \n6  The publication: Central Pollution Control Board. 2001. Pollution Control Acts, Rules and Notifications Issued There \nUnder. Delhi. (September) contains a compendium of all legislation that governs environmental and related \nclearance procedures. \n7  See www.envfor.nic.in \n8  Of 27 January 1994. \n9  Of 19 February 1991 and subsequent amendments. \n10 Defined as the \u2018coastal stretches of seas, bays, estuaries, creeks, rivers, and backwaters influenced by tidal action \n(in the landward side) up to 500 meters from the high tide line and the land between the low tide line and the high \ntide line. \n ", "86  Appendix 16 \nthree  categories.11  Authorization  for  approval  of  development  activities  within  the  zone  is \ndelegated to the respective state coastal zone management authorities (CZMA). Projects or \nactivities that are exempted from clearance under the above-mentioned notifications may still \nrequire some form of clearance under provisions of these acts or related notifications. \n \n20.  Enforcement of the above legislations and notifications vary by state. Provisions of the \nCRZ notification are enforced by the Department of Environment in Tamil Nadu and by the \nDepartment of Science, Technology, and Environment in Kerala. Interpretation of permissible \nactivities in the different zones (i.e., CRZ I through III) and procedures for obtaining clearances \nalso vary by state. Provisions under other legislation are enforced by a range of agencies. State \npollution control boards are vested with powers to implement certain provisions of different \nlegislation. State departments of forests and wildlife each have responsibility for enforcing \nprovisions of several acts mentioned above.  \n \n21.  By virtue of the nature of destruction caused by the tsunami, the TEAP will target coastal \ninfrastructure. Hence, some subproject activities will invariably fall within the CRZ. The range of \nlegislation,  notifications,  and  complex  of  institutions  vested  with  enforcement  authority,  as \ndescribed,  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the  relevant  clearances  and  approvals  required  of \nsubprojects will vary from case to case.  \n \nF.  Environmental Assessment and Review Procedures \n \n22.  The TEAP is considered sector-like in that detailed subproject designs will be developed \nduring implementation. Consequently, the specific environmental impacts of subprojects will \nalso be evident only at that stage. In such sector-like projects, greater emphasis is placed on \nestablishing  suitable  environmental  assessment  procedures  that  would  be  adopted  during \nimplementation. Accordingly, an environmental assessment and review procedure framework \nwas prepared (Supplementary Appendix D) to outline specific environmental assessment and \nmonitoring procedures that must be adopted when preparing and implementing subprojects. \nThe  framework  also  highlights  the  requirement  to  obtain  clearances  and  approvals  under \nrelevant statutory regulations. A summary of the procedures follows. \n \n23.  Initial proposals for subprojects will be generated by the project implementation units \n(PIUs) of the respective ministries and line departments serving as implementing agencies (IAs) \nof the TEAP. The consultant environmental specialist attached to the design and supervision \nconsultants unit will help the PIUs prepare rapid environmental assessments of each subproject. \nThe rapid assessment takes the form of a checklist and will be prepared in consultation with \nlocal community members. Based on the findings of the rapid assessment, the consultant \nenvironment specialist will recommend if further environmental assessment of the subproject is \nconsidered necessary.  The  rapid  environmental  assessment  will  also  be  the  basis  for  the \nconsultant environment specialist to point out the relevant approvals and clearances required \nunder various statutory regulations. The decision on further environmental assessment of a \nparticular subproject will be taken in consultation with the project management unit (PMU) and \nthe  environmental  safeguard  officer  attached  to  the  ADB  extended  mission.  Further \n                                                 \n11 Coastal Regulations Zone I (i) is ecologically sensitive or important areas such as wildlife sanctuaries, national \nparks, government forests, mangroves, coral reefs, breeding and spawning grounds of fish, and sites of historical \nimportance and (ii) includes areas between the low tide line and the high tide line. Zone II are areas that are \nalready developed up to or close to the shoreline, such as major coastal settlements, ports, and other large \ninfrastructure. Zone III comprises areas that are less developed than zone II areas or undeveloped but which do \nnot merit being classified as zone I. Zone IV covers the coastal stretches of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, \nLakshwadeep Islands, and some other islands except those already classified as zone I, II, or III.  \n ", "Appendix 16  87 \nenvironmental assessment will, in most cases, imply an initial environmental examination (IEE), \nwhich the consultant environmental specialist will undertake. Although not considered likely \ngiven the nature of subprojects considered under the Project, the rapid assessment could \nhighlight significant environmental impacts associated with a subproject, sufficient to warrant an \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  (EIA).  As  an  added  precaution,  the  environmental \nassessment  and  review  procedure  framework  covers  this  eventuality  and  specifies  the \ncorresponding procedures that must be followed. All detailed environmental assessments would \ninclude an environmental management plan (EMP) to guide mitigation and monitoring of any \npossible negative environmental impacts.  \n \n24.  If the subproject requires certain clearances v\u00ecs-\u00e0-v\u00ecs statutory regulations, the PIU will \nbe responsible for obtaining such clearances prior to commencing construction work on the \nsubproject. In the case of subprojects for which further environmental assessments are deemed \nnecessary (i.e., IEE or EIA), the PIU would endorse the assessment and agree to implement the \ncorresponding EMP. Approval of the IEE or EIA report would be obtained from the relevant \ngovernment  agency  responsible  for  approving  environmental  assessments.  The  consultant \nenvironment specialist will help monitor implementation of the EMP.  \n \n25.  The environmental safeguard officer attached to the ADB extended missions will review \nthe  first  three  rapid  environmental  assessments  prepared  for  subprojects  in  each  sector. \nThereafter, the rapid assessments will be reviewed randomly to ensure compliance with the \nprocess. All detailed environment assessment reports will be cleared by ADB prior to subproject \napproval. If the subproject is considered to have environmental impacts warranting an EIA, the \nrequired public consultation (at least twice) and disclosure of summary EIA (120 days of public \nnotice through the ADB website) should be met as part of the approval process. \n \n26.  In the event that a subproject design undergoes changes following approval of the \nEIA/IEE and the new design has elements that impinge on the environmental impacts identified \nand addressed in the original EIA/IEE, or introduces new potential environmental impacts, the \nEIA/IEE must be revised and be subject to reapproval, to address these new impacts.  \n \nG.  Consultations and Public Disclosure \n \n27.  Consultation and public disclosure of the TEAP were curtailed in view of the emergency \nprocessing procedures that were followed for project preparation. Nevertheless, the relevant \ngovernment agencies were involved in identifying the project scope, and selective consultation \nwith local community groups were carried out during field visits. Further consultations with local \ncommunity  groups  will  be  carried  out  as  appropriate  during  design  and  construction  of \nsubprojects. These requirements are explained in the environmental assessment and review \nprocedure framework.  \n \nH.  Findings, Recommendations, and Conclusions \n \n28.  On  the  basis  of  this  description  of  the  TEAP,  the  potential  environmental  impacts, \npossible mitigation measures, and proposed environmental assessment and review procedures \nto  be  followed  during  implementation,  no  further  environmental  assessment  of  the  overall \nproject is considered necessary at this stage. The TEAP is not likely to result in significant \nnegative environmental impacts and is likely to generate certain positive environmental impacts. \nThe TEAP is therefore classified as category B in terms of environmental impacts.  \n ", " \nTable A16: Potential Environmental Impacts and Indicative Mitigation Measures  8\n8\n \n  Subproject Characteristics   \nSector  Subproject  Typical
