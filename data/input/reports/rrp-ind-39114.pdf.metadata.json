An initial environmental examination was undertaken; \nthe summary is a core appendix. \n \nThe Tsunami Emergency Assistance (Sector) Project (TEAP) will \n(i)  enable  people  to  resume  their  normal  lives  by  supporting \nrestoration  of \nlivelihoods,  and  essential  services;  and  (ii) \nrehabilitate  and  reconstruct  critical  public  and  community-based \ntransportation, and rural and municipal infrastructure damaged or \ndestroyed.  The  project  design  is  based  on  the  joint  damage  and \nneeds  assessment  undertaken  in  February  2005  by  the  Asian \n(ADB),  United  Nations  Development \nDevelopment  Bank \nProgramme  (UNDP),  and  World  Bank,  in  the  states  of  Andhra \nPradesh,  Kerala,  and  Tamil  Nadu,  and  the  Union  Territory  of \nPondicherry,  in  close  coordination  and  consultation  with  the \nGovernment of India (the Government), and respective state and \nunion  territory  governments.  The  TEAP  will  focus  on  support  for \nthe  tsunami-affected  states  of  Tamil  Nadu  (the  most  severely \naffected) and Kerala. \n \nThe devastating tsunami of 26 December 2004 caused loss of life; \nseverely  damaged  infrastructure  and  other  assets;  and  disrupted \neconomic  activity,  output,  and  services,  with  attendant  losses  of \nincome  streams  in  Tamil  Nadu  and  Kerala.  Based  on  the  joint \nADB-UNDP-World  Bank  damage  and  needs  assessment,  the \ncombined  damage  to  output  and  income  amounted  to  at  least \n$838 million in Tamil Nadu and $126 million in Kerala. The impact \nof this has been particularly acute because the tsunami increased \nthe  poverty  of  already  economically  vulnerable  groups  in  Tamil \nNadu  and  Kerala  in  terms  of  losses  due  to  reduced  income \nopportunities.  \n \nThe  Tamil  Nadu  and  Kerala  state  budgets  for  FY2004/05  and \nbeyond will reflect the unanticipated expenditures for relief efforts \nand rehabilitation assistance.  \n \n\n\f \nImpact and Outcome \n\nii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nand \n\nand \n\npublic \n\ndestroyed \n\nThe financing needs in Tamil Nadu are estimated at $867 million \nand \nin  Kerala  $153  million.  These  exceed  donations  and \nGovernment  assistance.  By  providing  financing  for  the  most \nurgently  needed  components,  complementing  the  assistance  of \nother  financiers,  the  TEAP  will  enable  the  Government  to  help \nrestore  the  livelihood  and  economic  activities  essential  for \nrecovery of the affected areas in the two states. \n \nThe TEAP is to support efforts of the Government of Tamil Nadu \n(GOTN)  and  Government  of  Kerala  (GOK),  in  the  tsunami-\naffected  areas,  to  restore  the  livelihood  and  economic  activity  of \npeople  vulnerable  to  poverty,  and  rehabilitate  and  reconstruct \ncommunity-based \ndamaged \ninfrastructure  in  areas  vulnerable  to  natural  disasters.  The \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  will  be  carried  out  to  a  pre-\ntsunami \nlevel  or  a  higher,  cost-effective,  environmentally \nsustainable standard with design incorporating features critical to \ndisaster  prevention.  The  TEAP  will  focus  on  the  highest  priority \nareas,  identified  through  consultations  with  GOTN,  GOK,  public \nand  private  sectors,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and \nother civil society stakeholders. \n \nThe TEAP will have four components: \n \nPart A: Livelihood  \n \nRestoration  of  livelihoods  includes  (i)  restoring  the  livelihoods  of \nthe  affected  poor  and  low-income  households  already  organized \ninto self-help groups (SHGs) and other similar groups recognized \nby  state  governments  as  affected  by  the  tsunami  by  providing \nmicroenterprise  training  and  establishment  support,  (ii)  forming \nnew  SHGs  (both  male  and  female  members)  for  affected \nhouseholds  not  yet  organized  in  community-based  groups  to \nrestore \ntraining  and \nestablishment support, (iii) replacing productive assets (excluding \nhousing) of tsunami-affected households, (iv) upgrading skills, (v) \nmitigating  risk  through  insurance  of  all  affected  households  that \nreceive  assistance  under  this  component,  and  (vi)  rehabilitating \nand reconstructing community-based infrastructure.  \n \nPart B: Transportation \n \nRoads  and  Bridges.  This  subcomponent  comprises \n(i) \nrehabilitating  seriously  damaged  sections  of  state  roads  (other \nthan  village  and  municipal  roads)  including  major  district  roads, \nother district roads, and state highways in the affected districts of \nTamil Nadu and Kerala\u2014which have suffered breaches, damaged \nshoulders  and  pavements,  and  eroded  protection  works\u2014to  pre-\ntsunami level or to prescribed national standards; (ii) rehabilitating \n\nthrough  microenterprise \n\nlivelihoods \n\n\f \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\niii\n\nreliable \n\nfacilities,  and \n\nsource  development, \n\ndamaged drainage structures such as minor bridges, culverts, and \nside  drains;  (iii)  rehabilitating  bridges  in  affected  areas;  and  (iv) \nconstructing  bridge  connections  to  replace  temporary  crossing \narrangements;  unbridged  crossings,  or  for  inoperable  river-\ncrossing  ferries  as  evacuation  routes  from  a  disaster  prevention \nperspective. \n \nPorts  and  Harbors.  Rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  ports \nand  harbors  includes  (i)  dredging  ports,  harbor  basins,  and \napproach  channels;  (ii)  rehabilitating  breakwaters  for  ports  and \nfishing  harbors;  (iii)  rehabilitating  fishing  harbor  facilities  like \ncompound  walls;  (iv)  rehabilitating  damaged  roads  and  port \nfacilities  like  electrification  systems,  wharfs,  and  piers;  and  (v) \nprocuring equipment such as a destroyed dredger and navigation \naids.  \n \nPart C: Rural and Municipal Infrastructure \n \nWater  Supply  and  Sanitation.  This  subcomponent  includes  (i) \nrestoring and upgrading damaged existing water supply systems, \n(ii)  upgrading  affected  water  supply  systems  into  multivillage \nsystems  with  more \n(iii) \nrehabilitating/upgrading  sanitary  complex  and  solid  waste \nmanagement \n(iv)  conducting  sanitation  and \nenvironmental awareness campaigns.  \n \nOther  Rural  and  Municipal  Infrastructure.

In accordance with ADB\u2019s Disaster \nand  Emergency  Assistance  Policy,  the  loan  will  have  a  32-year \nterm,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an  interest  rate  to  be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and  such \nother  terms  and  conditions  as  are  set  forth  in  the  draft  financing \nand  project  agreements.  A  grant  of  $100  million  will  be  provided \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Asian  Tsunami  Fund  (ATF)  in  accordance  with  the \nATF Paper (R65-05) dated 11 February 2005, and on the basis of \na  proposed  request  for  waiver  of  the  pro-rata  provisions  in  para. \n11  of  the  ATF  Paper.  The  loan  and  grant  will  cover  the  foreign \nexchange  cost  of  $56.5  million  and  $143.5  million  equivalent  of \nlocal currency costs. \n \nUntil 31 October 2008 \n \nUntil 30 April 2008 \n\n \nThe  Executing  Agency  (EA)  in  Tamil  Nadu  will  be  the  Revenue \nAdministration  Disaster  Management  and  Mitigation  Department \n(RADMMD);  and \nthe  Department  of  Disaster \nManagement Department (DDM).  \n \n\nin  Kerala, \n\n\fImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  v\n\nthat  will \n\nThe  State  Level  Steering  Committee  (SLSC)  in  Tamil  Nadu  and \nKerala will act as project steering committees. The SLSC will act \nas  a  policy  making  body  which  will  provide  overall  advice  and \nguidance  to  the  EA  associated  with  the  Project.  In  addition,  an \nEmpowered  Committee  will  be  established,  chaired  by  the \nrespective  state  chief  secretaries, \n(i)  authorize \ngovernment  orders  needed  for  project  reconstruction  works;  and \n(ii) provide for all approvals and sanctions required for the Project, \nincluding  subproject  approvals.  RADMMD  in  Tamil  Nadu  and \nDMD  in  Kerala  will  be  delegated  with  all  necessary  powers  to \nundertake their respective responsibilities as EAs. \n \nDDM and RADMMD will each establish a PMU. The PMUs will be \nresponsible  for  (i)  providing  day-to-day  assistance  and  guidance \nto  project  implementing  agencies  (IAs);  (ii)  reviewing  subprojects \nto  satisfy  ADB  due  diligence  requirements,  and  approving \nsubproject  proposals  submitted  by  line  departments  and  IAs;  (iii) \nmanaging and disbursing funds; (iv) consolidating and submitting \nprogress  reports \nto  Empowered  Committee  and  ADB;  (v) \ndisbursing  funds  and  accounting  against  a  review  of  financial \nreports  provided  by  the  IAs;  and  (vi)  reviewing  compliance  with \nspecifications  and  plans,  and  quality  control  and  transparency \nrequirements by bodies undertaking reconstruction works. \n \nThe  TEAP  will  have  strengthened  governance  measures, \nincluding \nand  monitoring, \nfinancial  management \nperformance auditing, and random spot checks through delegated \nproject administration by ADB\u2019s India Resident Mission operating \nthrough extended mission offices in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. \n \nAn IA will be appointed for each of the key sectors included under \nthe TEAP and will report to its respective PMU. The IAs will have \nPIUs for field monitoring and implementation of subprojects. \n \nGOTN line departments to act as IAs are (i) Highways Department \nfor  roads  and  bridges;  (ii)  Maritime  Board \nfor  ports;  (iii) \nDepartment  of  Fisheries  for  harbors;  (iv)  Tamil  Nadu  Electricity \nBoard for public lighting and damaged distribution lines; (v) Rural \nDevelopment  Department \ninfrastructure,  sanitation,  \nfor  rural \nlivelihoods,  and  concerned  municipality  for  municipal  sanitation; \n(vi) Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board and concerned \nmunicipality  for  water  supply;  and  (vii)  Municipal  Administration \nDepartment \nfor  municipal \ninfrastructure.  GOK  line  departments  to  act  as  IAs  are  (i)  Public \nWorks Department for roads and bridges, and rural and municipal \ninfrastructure other than public lighting and power distribution; (ii) \nKerala Water Authority for water supply and sanitation; (iii) Harbor \nEngineering Department for ports and harbors;  (iv)  Kerala  State \n\nconcerned  municipality \n\nstrict \n\nand \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nProcurement \n\nfor \n\ninput \n\nincluding  public  consultation  and \n\nElectricity Board for public lighting and power distribution; and (v) \nFisheries  Department/Kudumbashree  using \nthe  expertise  of \naccredited  technical  institutions  or  NGO  service  providers  for \nlivelihood. \n \nThe  IAs  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  prioritizing  and  preparing \nsubproject  technical  proposals  for  sectors  included  under  the \nTEAP;  (ii)  reporting  on  the  TEAP  to  RADMMD  and  DDM;  (iii) \nimplementing day-to-day reconstruction works and  activities;  (iv) \nconducting  detailed  assessments,  surveys,  and  planning  of \nreconstruction, \nfrom \nrecipient local entities and beneficiaries; (v) prioritizing works and \npreparing  detailed  designs,  specifications,  schedule  of  quantity, \nbidding  documents,  contracts,  and  related  documentation;  (vi) \npreparing  regular  progress  reports \nthe  project  steering \ncommittee  and  ADB  through  RADMMD  and  DDM;  and  (vii) \nsupervising  construction,  conducting  quality  control,  approving \nprogress  payments  to  contractors,  and  maintaining  up-to-date \nrecords and accounts for the TEAP and making these available to \nADB and/or auditors for inspection. \n \nThe Government will establish two imprest accounts (one for loan \nproceeds  and  another  for  grant  proceeds)  operated  by  the \ncomptroller  of  aid  accounts  and  audit.  Initial  deposits  into  the \nimprest  accounts  will  not  exceed  5%  of  the  loan  and  grant \namount. Thereafter, the aggregate drawdown into the two imprest \naccounts will not exceed the lesser of the equivalent of 3 months \nof  current  project  expenditure  or  5%  of  the  total  loan  and  grant \namount  respectively.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  operated  in \naccordance with the ADB Loan Disbursement Handbook (January \n2001), Interim Guidelines for Disbursement Operations for LIBOR-\nBased Loan Products, and Asian Tsunami Fund. \n \nProcurement  of  goods,  services,  and  works  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with ADB Guidelines for Procurement (2004) and the \ncontemplated  implementation  schedule.  ADB  procedures  for \nproviding  reconstruction  assistance  after  disasters  provide  for \nsubstantial  flexibility  so  that  project  activities  can  be  started \npromptly.  Local  competitive  bidding  procedures  will  be  the \npreferred  mode  of  procurement.  The \nlocal  procurement \nprocedures  of  the  state  governments  are  acceptable,  with  some \nminor  amendments.  Prior  review  by  ADB  of  bidding  documents \nand awards will be conducted for procurement under international \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  and  for  the  first  two  (PIU) \ncontracts.  In  other  cases,  post-facto  approval  procedures  will  be \nfollowed. However, if at a later stage, ADB does not approve the \naward or terms of the contract, the Government may not use the \nloan or grant proceeds, or may need to refund any such loan and \ngrant proceeds used. \n \n\n\fConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n  vii\n\nrestoring \n\nincreasing \n\nfor  beneficiaries, \n\nConsulting  services  will  be  required  for  purposes  detailed  under \nPart  D  of  the  TEAP  to  assist  the  IAs  and  PMUs.  The  TEAP  will \nrequire  a  total  of  645  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  as \nindividual  consultants  or  from  consulting  firms  for  Kerala  and \nTamil  Nadu.  All  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB  Guidelines  on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. Since the TEAP will be completed within 36 months, \nexpeditious selection and fielding of consultants will be necessary. \nStreamlined  procedures  under  ADB  Assistance  for  Tsunami-\nAffected Developing Member Countries (2005) are applicable. \n \nThe  TEAP  primarily  focuses  on  rehabilitating  and  reconstructing \ndamaged  or  destroyed  infrastructure,  and  restoring  livelihoods  of \nthose  affected  directly  or  indirectly  by  the  tsunami.  Project \ninterventions  will  therefore  result  in  restoring  productivity  of  the \nlivelihoods,  creating  productive \ntargeted  assets, \nreducing  poverty \nlivelihood  alternatives \nvulnerability  of  newly  vulnerable  groups, \nlabor \nopportunities  for  wage-dependent  households,  and  increasing \nphysical  security  and  community  bonds  for  affected  households \nthrough  disaster-resistant  infrastructure.  Furthermore,  within  the \ntargeted  sectors,  the  IAs  will  need  to  prioritize  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction  interventions  to  maximize  the  returns  from  the \nlimited project resources. In addition, the principle of least cost will \nbe  applied  without  compromising  the  quality  assurance  of  the \nassets created, to ensure maximum utility from resource use.  \n \nTo  mitigate  any  lack  of  adequately  strong  commitment  in \nimplementing the TEAP in an efficient and timely manner so that \nthe  livelihood  of  intended  beneficiaries  is  restored  and  the \ntsunami-damaged  or  destroyed  infrastructure  is  rehabilitated  and \nreconstructed,  GOTN  and  GOK  will  provide  high  level  steering \ncommittees  and  Empowered  Committees  which  are  chaired  by \nthe respective state\u2019s chief secretary.  \n \nImplementation  risks  related  to  capacity  for  timely  delivery  of \nquality subprojects in the various project sectors will be mitigated \nin  several  ways.

For  the  first  time  in  half  a  century,  India  experienced  the  devastating \neffects  of  a  tsunami,  caused  by  a  series  of  earthquakes  in  the  Bay  of  Bengal.1  The  first  and \nstrongest  earthquake  was  off  the  west  coast  of  northern  Sumatra,  Indonesia,  at  0629  hours, \nIndian  Standard  Time  on  26  December  2004  (magnitude  and  intensity  9.0  United  States \nGeological  Survey  [USGS]),  followed  by  one  81  kilometers  (km)  west  of  Pulo  Kunji,  Great \nNicobar,  India  (7.3  USGS)  some  3  hours  later.  One  hundred  and  fifteen  aftershocks  were \nreported; the magnitude of 103 tremors was between 5.0 and 6.0 USGS and 12 were over 6.0 \non the Richter scale. The earthquakes set off giant tsunami tidal waves of 3 to 10 meters (m) in \nheight, which hit the southern and eastern coastal areas of India and penetrated inland up to 3 \nkm, causing extensive damage in the Union Territory of the Andaman and Nicobar islands, and \nthe coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu states and the Union Territory \nof  Pondicherry.  Approximately  2,260  km  of  the  coastal  area  in  addition  to  the  Andaman  and \nNicobar islands were affected.  \n \nHuman Toll.2 According to Government reports 10,749 people in India died, 5,6403 are \n3. \nreported missing, and 6,913 injured. In Tamil Nadu, over 7,983 deaths were reported. Of the 12 \ncoastal districts4 affected in Tamil Nadu, Nagapattinam, where 6,051 people died, was the worst \naffected. Over 824 died in Kanyakumari, and 612 were reported dead in Cuddalore district. In \nKerala,  171  deaths  were  reported.  Of  the  four  affected  districts  of  Alappuzha,  Ernakulam, \nKollam, and Kannur in Kerala,5 Kollam accounted for the highest death toll of 131 followed by \nAlappuzha with 35 and Ernakulam with 5. \n \nRelief. Although the Government of India (the Government) and state governments were \n4. \ncaught unaware by the tsunami, they responded quickly to launch effective relief operations. As \npart  of  a  coordinated  effort,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)/civil  society  played  an \nimportant role as did the United Nations (UN), with the private sector responding with generous \ndonations of funds and relief material. \n \n5. \nJoint  Needs  Assessment.  As  part  of  the  process  of  accelerating  the  transition  from \nrelief  to  reconstruction,  the  Government  asked  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  United \nNations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  and  World  Bank  on  10  January  2005,  or  soon \nthereafter, to undertake emergency assistance for rehabilitation, reconstruction, and restoration \n                                                 \n1  The  last  time  a  tsunami  hit  the  coast  of  India  was  in  1945.  The  other  Asian  countries  affected  are  Indonesia, \n\nMaldives, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. Several countries in East Africa were also affected. \n\n2  This human toll data for Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Pondicherry, and Tamil Nadu is taken from the United Nations \n\nDisaster Management Team Situation Report, 1 February 2005, which is based on Government reports. \n\n3   The most recent reports indicate that 2,812 people of the 5,641 reported missing are dead. \n4  The  affected  districts  are  listed  in  the  joint  assessment  mission  report  of  the  ADB,  UNDP  and  World  Bank.  The \nstate government relief response in Tamil Nadu in the aftermath of the tsunami extended to Chennai, Cuddalore, \nKancheepuram, Kannyakumari, Nagapattinam, Pudukkotai, Ramanathapuram, Thanjavur, Thiruvallur, Thothukudi, \nTirunelveli, Tiruvarur, and Viluppuram. \n\n5  The state government relief response in Kerala in the aftermath of the tsunami extended to Alappuzha, Ernakulam, \n\nKannur, Kasaragod, Kollam, Kozhikode, Malappuram,Thiruvananthapuram, and Thrissur. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n1. \n\nSector Damage and Losses \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nin the aftermath of the tsunami. In consultation with the  Government, ADB, UNDP, and World \nBank  formed  a  joint  assessment  mission  (JAM)  team  to  estimate  damage,  losses,  and \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  needs  in  Andhra  Pradesh,  Kerala,  Pondicherry,  and  Tamil \nNadu. The assessment commenced on 1 February 2005 and concluded on 15 February 2005. \nThe JAM report was submitted to the Government on 8 March 2005. Pursuant to that report and \ndiscussions with the Government and other donors, ADB was requested based on comparative \nstrength and engagement of different multilateral institutions, to support restoration of livelihood, \nand rehabilitation and reconstruction of transportation and rural and municipal infrastructure in \nTamil  Nadu  and  Kerala.  A  copy  of  the  JAM  summary  report  is  attached  as  Appendix  2;  a \ndetailed report is available in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nB.  \n \n \n \n6. \nOverview.  The  JAM  assessed  the  total  damage  and  losses  suffered  by  the  states  of \nTamil  Nadu  and  Kerala  at  $964  million.  Tamil  Nadu  was  considered  to  be  more  severely \naffected with total damage and losses assessed at approximately $838 million; Kerala\u2019s damage \nand losses amounted to approximately $125 million. While the largest proportion of the damage \nwas  concentrated  in  fisheries  (approximately  29.78%),  housing  (11.22%),  and  infrastructure, \nmaterial  private  asset  damage  related  to  coastal  fisheries,  agriculture  and  microenterprises, \nwhose replacement is critical to livelihoods, were included in the various sectors. A sector and \nstate breakdown of damage and losses is in Appendix 2.  \n \nLivelihood. The tsunami has wreaked widespread havoc on the livelihoods of families in \n7. \nthe affected areas of Tamil Nadu and Kerala as a result of loss of human life; personal injuries; \ndestruction  of  houses,  property,  and  assets;  and  destruction  of  essential  social  and  transport \ninfrastructure. The livelihoods of about 485,000 families have been directly or indirectly affected \nin Tamil Nadu (400,000 families) and Kerala (85,000). About one third of the affected families in \nTamil  Nadu  and  one  half  of  the  affected  families  in  Kerala  are  directly  linked  to  the  fisheries \nsector, about one fourth to microenterprises.  \n \nThe  tsunami\u2019s  human  toll,  displacement,  and  damage  in  terms  of  critical  assets  have \n8. \nundermined the capacity of affected families to restore their livelihood. The tsunami disaster has \nhit  those  who  were  already  vulnerable  to  poverty,  and  working  as  informal  traders  or  landless \nlaborers, or engaged in microenterprises. Despite the favorable human development indicators \nof both states, the poverty impact of the tsunami in Tamil Nadu and Kerala is marked because \npoverty levels are disproportionately high among social groups like traditional fishers, marginal \nfarmers,  agricultural  and  urban  labor,  scheduled  castes  and  tribes,  and  people  in  traditional \nindustries like coir, cashew, hand looming, and stone crushing. Poverty among tsunami-affected \ncoastal communities is less visible, geographically interstitial (fragmented and intermittent), and \nsocially  differentiated.  The  coastal  poor  are  socioeconomically  and  environmentally  vulnerable \ndue  to  low  coverage  and  quality  of  water  and  sanitation  services,  and  health  and  education \ninfrastructure.  Poverty  levels  are  further  compounded  by  the  high  income  seasonality  and \ninformal  livelihoods  amid  climatic  variations,  and  frequent  disasters,  which  compromise  the \ncoping  ability  of  coastal  communities.  Given  the  multisector  livelihood  linkages  in  the  coastal \neconomies,  a  large  number  of  informal  microenterprises6  have  been  particularly  adversely \naffected  by  disruptions  in  supplies  and  markets,  loss  of  income-generating  assets  and \nequipment, and losses of shops and trading. \n \n                                                 \n6   Include a broad range of activities requiring small investments primarily in the range of Rs5,000\u2013Rs250,000. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\nRoads  and  Bridges.  The  tsunami-induced  damage  on  roads  and  bridges  of  affected \n9. \ndistricts is constraining connectivity in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. In 7 of the 12 coastal districts in \nTamil Nadu, and in particular in Cuddalore, Kannyakumari, and Nagappatinam districts, tsunami \ndamage  to  state  roads  has  undermined  the  connectivity  needed  for  the  livelihood  of \ncommunities given that roads and bridges represent the dominant mode of transport.7 Tourism \nand  related  businesses  in  the  coastal  districts  have  also  been  affected  as  roads  leading  to \nbeaches  have  been  damaged.  In  Tamil  Nadu,  two  bridge  structures  in  the  severely  affected \ndistricts of Cuddalore and Kannyakumari were seriously damaged or had collapsed and several \nweaknesses  in  connectivity  were  revealed.  The  tsunami  left  some  of  the  roads  severely \nbreached;  berms,  shoulders,  and  protection  works  eroded;  and  the  road  structure  exposed. \nPavements  were  washed  away  and  cross-drainage  structures  damaged.  The  impact  of  the \ntsunami waves was so severe that some bridge structures were damaged due to boats hitting \nthe substructures and decks. \n \nA majority of the tsunami-damaged state roads in Kerala8 provide significant connectivity \n10. \nand  have  a  catalytic  effect  on  the  livelihood  of  local  community,  trade  and  tourism.  In  the \ndistricts of Alappuzha, Ernakulam, and Kollam, the narrow major district roads running along the \nsea at an average distance of approximately 50 m from the seacoast suffered severe damage, \nincluding to minor bridges and culverts. A large number of lives were lost due to lack of bridges \nconnecting the main land across the backwaters; this highlights the need to maximize disaster \nprevention resilience in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of such infrastructure facilities.  \n \nPorts and Harbors. Minor ports9 were damaged in Tamil Nadu (i.e., Nagapattinam Port \n11. \nlocated  along  the  Kaduvaiyar  River;  and  Cuddalore  Port  located  at  the  confluence  of  the \nGadilam and Paravanar rivers sharing channel with fishing harbors) and in Kerala (i.e., Azhikkal, \nBeypore,  Neendakara  and  Vizhinjam).  This  has  resulted  in  a  loss  of  crucial  port  services. \nConsequently,  maritime  cargo  must  be  transported  at  higher  cost  and  loss  of  port-related \nservices such as fuel and water supply and increased unemployment of the labor force due to \nlimited  or  suspended  port  operation.  The  tsunami  damage  to  three  fishing  harbors  in  Tamil \nNadu and eight in Kerala, which were damaged or destroyed, has adverse effects on revitalizing \ncoastal livelihoods and maritime safety.  \n \n12.  Water Supply and Sanitation. The limited quantity and quality of water and sanitation \nfrom supply systems was critically compromised by tsunami damage in the form of salinization \nof  wells,  and  destruction  of  pipes  and  sanitation  systems.  Water  supply  and  sanitation \ninfrastructure and related services provided for the tsunami-affected communities in 7 districts of \nTamil Nadu and 3 in Kerala has been affected. In Tamil Nadu this affects a total population of \n329,000 in 6 towns (affected population 68,400) and 74 village panchayats (affected population \n260,600); and in Kerala, a total population of 192,000 in one town (affected population 11,000) \nand 36 village panchayats (affected population 181,000).  \n \n                                                 \n7   The  total  road  length  in  Tamil  Nadu  is  151,137  km  comprising  60,628  km  of  primary  road  network  and  the \nremaining  90,509  km  of  panchayat,  panchayat  union,  municipal,  forest,  Tamil  Nadu  Electricity  Board,  and  other \nlocal  body  roads.  The  primary  road  network  includes  3,865  km  of  national  highways,  7,136  km  state  highways, \n7,408  km  major  district  roads,  42,219  km  other  district  roads  and  sugarcane  roads.  Road  transport  in  the  state \naccounts for 80% of freight and passenger trips.  \n\n8   The  total  road  length  in  Kerala  is  138,196  km  comprising  22,991  km  of  primary  road  network  and  the  remaining \n115,205  km  of  panchayat,  municipal,  forest,  irrigation,  and  other  local  body  roads.  The  primary  road  network \nincludes  1,524  km  national  highways,  3,785  km  state  highways,  11,711  km  major  district  roads,  5,316  km  other \ndistrict roads, and 656 km of other roads. Average road density in Kerala is 3.56 km/square km while the same for \nIndia is 0.91 km/square km. \n\n9   Major ports are managed by port trusts under the regulation of the Tariff Authority of Major Ports. Minor ports are \n\nunder state government control. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nImpacts of the Tsunami \n\nOther  Rural  and  Municipal  Infrastructure.  The  tsunami  critically  damaged  minor \n13. \ninfrastructure that provides the basis for community livelihoods, such as village and panchayat \nroads,  including  minor  bridges  and  culverts,  drainage  canals,  and  other  community-based \nfacilities  (such  as  common  fish  landing,  processing,  and  storage  facilities,  community  centers, \npanchayat buildings, and electricity including public lighting.  \n \n \n \nFiscal  Impact.  Despite  these  tsunami-related  damages  and  losses,  the  tsunami  is  not \n14. \nexpected  to  have  much  impact  on  India\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  or  the  gross  state  domestic \nproduct of Tamil Nadu and Kerala.10 Foreign exchange receipts may be marginally impacted to \nthe  extent  that  shrimp  exports  are  hit  along  with  coastal  tourism.  The  states\u2019  gross  domestic \nproduct  is  affected  only  to  a  limited  extent  because  economic  activities  along  the  coastline \ncontribute  little  to  their  income.  Although  fisheries,  agriculture,  microenterprises,  and  small \nbusinesses  have  been  adversely  affected,  this  will  not  have  any  discernible  impact  on  the \nstates\u2019 growth rates as the tsunami impact was localized, and for the states as a whole these \nactivities contribute little to their revenues. However, the tsunami is projected to have a material \nimpact  on  the  state  fiscal  deficits  due  to  additional  expenditures.  The  additional  state \nexpenditures  can  be  divided  into  two  categories:  (i)  immediate  and  temporary  relief,  and  (ii) \nshort- and medium-term reconstruction costs over 2\u20133 years.  \n \n15. \nFor  Tamil  Nadu  and  Kerala,  the  strain  of  tsunami-related  expenditures  and  the \nconsequent impact of higher interest burdens due to increased debt stock is estimated to result \nin a deterioration of the ratio of fiscal deficit to gross state domestic product in fiscal year (FY) \n2004/05 and FY2005/06 in Tamil Nadu and lack of improvement in that ratio in FY2004/05 and \nFY2005/06 in Kerala, as projected in the macroeconomic analysis in Appendix 3. \n \n16. \nInterlinked  Social  and  Infrastructure  Impact.  Although  affected  communities  have \ndemonstrated considerable resilience in terms of emergency response efforts immediately after \nthe  tsunami  disaster,  the  livelihood  capacity  of  such  already  fragile  communities  has  been \nimpaired  as  a  result  of  deaths,  the  need  to  replace  assets,  and  absence  of  seed  capital.  In \naddition, due consideration needs to be given in livelihood restoration to the preponderance of \nthose  with  special  vulnerability  in  the  affected  communities  (women,  widows  and  orphans, \nmarginalized  groups  who  are  physically  or  mentally  challenged,  or  socially  disadvantaged \ngroups  due  to  caste)  whose  livelihood  and  income-generating  work  has  been  impaired  by  the \ntsunami.  Community  mobilization  represents  a  cornerstone  of  demand-driven  local  recovery \nefforts and a means of overcoming the income shock of especially vulnerable segments of the \ncommunity such as households headed by women. Consequently, community\u2013based livelihood \nrestoration modalities, such as through self-help group (SHG), will be particularly critical when \ndesigning and implementing post-tsunami reconstruction programs.  \n \n\n                                                 \n10  The  primary  sector  comprising  of  agriculture,  fisheries  and  allied  activities  in  the  two  worst  affected  districts  of \nTamil  Nadu,  namely  Cuddalore  and  Nagapattinam  contribute  only  1.02%  and  0.69%  to  the  aggregate  state \ndomestic product of Tamil Nadu, respectively. Thus, a 2%\u20133% reduction in the growth rate of the primary sector in \nthese two districts will lead to a reduction in the aggregate growth rate of the state by 0.03%\u20130.05% respectively. \nSimilarly, the primary sector of the two worst affected districts in Kerala, namely Alappuzha and Kollam, together \ncontribute  only  2.6%  to  the  aggregate  state  domestic  product.  Consequently,  even  a  2%\u20133%  reduction  in  the \ngrowth  rate  of  the  primary  sector  in  those  two  districts  will  only  result  in  a  negligible  reduction  in  the  aggregate \ngrowth rate of the state. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) assessment also indicates that the impact of the \ntsunami  on  national  growth  is  expected  to  be  minor  (IMF.  2005.  Preliminary  Assessment  of  the  Macroeconomic \nImpact of the Tsunami Disaster on Affected Countries and of Associated Needs).  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\nYet  the  nature  of  the  tsunami-affected  communities  in  Tamil  Nadu  and  Kerala  is  such \n17. \nthat  they  are  particularly  dependent  for  their  livelihood  on  the  restoration  of  certain \ninfrastructure.  Thus  the  badly  affected  coastal  fisheries  communities  will  be  dependent  on  the \nrestoration of key public infrastructure like ports and fishing harbors. Consequently, the required \nrepairs for ports and fishing harbors, in terms of approximately 8,000 m of compound walls and \nrestoration  of  breakwaters,  and  1,600,000  cubic  m  of  dredging  to  remove  tsunami-inflicted \nsiltation  of  harbor  basins  and  approach  channels  in  20  ports,  fishing  harbors,  and  landing \nchannels  is  a  critical  parallel  intervention  to  restore  coastal  livelihoods.  The  importance  of  the \nrehabilitation of damaged fishing harbors for livelihood restoration is evident from the fact that a \nfishing  harbor  located  on  the  river,  upstream  of  Nagapattinam  port  in  Tamil  Nadu,  previously \nhad a fish throughput of 30,000 tons, is currently damaged and largely inoperative. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  tsunami  on  other  families  whose  livelihood  is  linked  to  fishing \n18. \ncommunities  most  directly  affected  also  needs  to  be  taken  into  account,  including  their \ndependence  on  public  infrastructure  like  rural  roads,  water  supply,  community  toilets,  and \ncommunity  buildings.  These  would  also  represent  opportunities  for  transitional  employment. \nThese  are  small  labor  intensive  works  scattered  over  a  large  area  and  provide  valuable  rural \nemployment  to  a  segment  of  tsunami-affected  people  when  it  is  most  needed,  i.e.,  during  the \nrecovery  process.  Being  low-skill,  low-technology,  small-scale  works,  they  sustain  the  skilled \nand  semiskilled  local  people  in  the  short  term.  In  the  long  term,  such  minor  infrastructure  will \nrestore  their  livelihood  by  creating  employment  opportunities  for  local  people  by  rebuilding \nproductive and supportive resources for coastal industries, as well as employment for operation \nand  maintenance  of  such  minor  infrastructure.  Consequently,  there  is  a  critical  need  to  (i) \ncontribute to restoring and rebuilding the livelihood of the affected communities, by rehabilitating \nessential  minor  village  and  municipal  infrastructure;  (ii)  specifically  contribute  to  reducing \ntransportation time and resources for goods and services, in particular, fishery and associated \nproducts;  and  (iii)  provide  improved  drainage  and  public  facilities  with  disaster  resistant \nstandards for rehabilitation of public buildings and improved practices in community participation \nwhere  necessary  for  project  planning  and  implementation  to  lead  to  enhanced  operation  and \nmaintenance, while delivering essential employment opportunities to the affected communities. \n \n19. \nIn  addition, for  sustainable  revival  of  livelihood,  in  the  following  are  urgently  needed  (i) \nprovide improved drinking water supplies in terms of quality and quantity at least to the level of \nor  beyond  pre-tsunami  conditions  given  same  standard  pre-tsunami  replacement  costs  and \nlocal  post-tsunami  upgrade  requirements;  (ii)  contribute  to  reducing  time  and  resources  for \nproviding  or  collecting  water,  and  for  maintaining  existing  poorly  performing  systems;  (iii) \ncontribute to protecting public health from potential waterborne diseases, and reducing pressure \non the fragile coastal aquifer and natural environment; and (iv) provide institutional support for \nimproved  practices  in  community  participation  in  project  planning  and  implementation,  and \nsound  technical  design  and  quality  control,  along  with  increased  involvement  of  local \ngovernment institutions and beneficiaries in operation and maintenance of completed schemes. \n    \n20. \nConsequently,  recovery  from  the  impacts  of  the  tsunami  for  Tamil  Nadu  and  Kerala \ncoastal  communities  requires  simultaneous  restoration  of  livelihood,  and  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction  of  physical  infrastructure.  While  community-based  microenterprise  initiatives, \nsuch as through SHGs, enhance economic capacity, restoring damaged community and public \ninfrastructure  is  equally  critical  if  livelihood  restoration  is  to  successfully  occur.  Certain \ninfrastructure may be community built, owned, and managed, such as those related to tsunami-\ndamaged water bodies, and other infrastructure may require more inputs in the nature of public \nworks  but  both  represent  an  integral  part  of  critical  infrastructure  rehabilitation  support  for \nlivelihood restoration. \n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nEnvironmental  Impact.  The  tsunami  has  affected  the  natural  environment  in  several \n21. \nways  with  consequences  for  production  systems.  Salinization  of  groundwater  and  fresh  water \nsystems  has  affected  coastal  communities  whose  daily  water  requirement  and  livelihoods \ndepend  on  these  systems.  The  impact  has  been  particularly  severe  on  the  poor  who  have  no \naccess  to  piped  water  supply  schemes.  Around  8,000  hectare  (ha)  of  agricultural  lands  are \naffected  by  siltation  and  salinization.  Around  2,500  ha  of  shelterbelt,  mangroves,  and  teak \nplantations were damaged in Tamil Nadu alone. Fishery stocks that depend on mangroves and \ncoastal wetlands for spawning are likely to be affected; however the impact on fishery stocks at \nlarge is not clear. Consequently, a combination of livelihood restoration interventions that revive \nfish  production  systems  and  public  infrastructure  interventions  that  provide  water  quality  and \ncontainment  of  ports-related  environmental  damage  is  urgently  required  to  address  the  varied \nenvironmental impacts.  \n \n22. \nDisaster  Risk  Management  Policy  and  Institutional  Framework.  Although  the \nGovernment undertook effective relief efforts, the magnitude of the tsunami impact has led to a \nparticular focus on a systematic approach to disaster risk management that goes beyond relief \nand aims to reduce the vulnerability of the country to disaster risk in the future. In response to \nthe  historical-scale  disasters  experienced  by  the  country  in  recent  years,  such  as  cyclone \n(Orissa in 1999), earthquake (Gujarat in 2001), floods (Ganges-Brahmaputra in 1998 and 2004), \nand  the  recent  tsunami,  the  Government  is  progressively  strengthening  its  policy  and \ninstitutional  framework  to  manage  the  risk  against  a  range  of  natural  disasters.  The  recently \nprepared  and  comprehensive  national  disaster  management  framework  provides  strategic \nguidelines for institutional mechanisms, disaster prevention, early warning systems, mitigation, \npreparedness  and  response,  and  human  resource  development.  To  formalize  the  framework, \nthe Government is now finalizing a national disaster management authority policy and bill, which \naim  at  promoting  and  operating  a  disaster  risk  management  strategy  to  reduce  the  country\u2019s \nvulnerability  to  such  risk.  Establishment  of  a  similar  state  policy,  bill,  and  authority  are  also \nenvisaged.11  \n  \n23. \nThe  Government  is  participating  in  regional  efforts  to  establish  an  effective  tsunami \nwarning  system,  to  be  integrated  with  the  existing  national  system  of  cyclone  forecasting  and \nwarning.  In  addition,  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  is  implementing  the  Disaster  Risk \nManagement Program with multidonor support to (i) set up national, state, and district centers \nfor multihazard emergency operations; (ii) establish district, block, and village plans for disaster \nmanagement;  (iii)  undertake  disaster  management  and  mitigation  awareness;  (iv)  support \ndisaster-resistant  technologies;  and  (v)  promote  legal  and  policy  frameworks  for  disaster \nmanagement and systems to ensure their compliance. This provides a platform for development \nin  Tamil  Nadu  and  Kerala  for  (i)  local  and  community-based  capacity  building  at  all  levels, \nlinking  the  development  of  early  warning  through  public  awareness  and  communication  to  the \nuse of evacuation infrastructure; and (ii) improving the resilience of public and private structures \nagainst  multihazard  risks.  The  inclusion  of  disaster  resilience  standards  for  reconstruction  of \ninfrastructure is a particularly crucial requirement in a multihazard context, as the affected states \nare prone to a range of hazards that occur with much greater frequency than tsunamis.  \n \n \n \n24. \nDonor Coordination on State and Sectoral Allocations. The magnitude and multitude \nof the tsunami impacts  has generated the need for the proposed ADB  emergency  assistance, \nwhich  will  complement  the  contributions  of  other  donors.  On  22  February  2005,  following  the \n\nDonor Coordination \n\n3. \n\n                                                 \n11  The Government of Tamil Nadu has drafted a state disaster management policy and established the State Disaster \n\nManagement Authority. The Government of Kerala has also drafted a bill for disaster management.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7\n\n4.  \n\nLessons Learned \n\nJAM, the Government held joint discussions with ADB, UN, and World Bank to establish an in-\nprinciple  understanding  of  state  and  sector  allocations  between  the  multilateral  institutions. \nBearing  in  mind  respective  resource  envelopes  and  comparative  expertise,  the  group  agreed \nthat  (i)  ADB  would  focus  principally  on  livelihood  restoration,  transportation,  and  rural  and \nmunicipal  infrastructure  in  Tamil  Nadu  and  Kerala;  (ii)  the  World  Bank  would  be  principally \nassigned sectors like housing, fisheries, and agriculture; and (iii) the UN would principally focus \non disaster risk management. \n \nDevelopment  Partners\u2019  Response  to  Rehabilitation  and  Reconstruction  Needs. \n25. \nThe UN system\u2019s assistance, as coordinated by UNDP, is expected to be $38.6 million for areas \nsuch  as  psychosocial  support;  health  and  nutrition;  education;  rebuilding  livelihoods;12  water \nsupply, sanitation, and hygiene; and information technology and communications.  \n \n26. \nThe  World  Bank  is  currently  preparing  its  emergency  post-tsunami  support  with  the \nGovernment,  with  Board  approval  expected  in  May  2005.  The  assistance  is  expected  in  the \nform of approximately $460 million of International Development Association credit, of which the \nmajority will come from loan cancellations and savings. The World Bank also expects to provide \na grant of $2.5 million.  \n \n \n \n27. \nLessons Learned in Disaster Response. The tsunami impact issues that constrain the \nrecovery of affected states confirm the importance of lessons drawn from previous experience \nof ADB emergency assistance and ADB policies. ADB disaster emergency assistance to India in \nthe  aftermath  of  the  Gujarat  earthquake  provides  some  India-related  lessons.  Although  this  is \nonly the fifth project developed under the ADB Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (May \n2004),13 some general lessons can be learned from the past experience with postdisaster loans \nto other developing member countries.  \n \n28. \nThe lessons learned are (i) prepare projects as quickly as possible; (ii) focus projects on \nrestoring  livelihood,  and  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  key  facilities;  (iii)  complete \nreconstruction works to the extent possible within 2\u20133 years; (iv) provide strong implementation \nassistance  and  ADB  supervision  as  implementation  will  place  a  heavy  burden  on  executing \nagency  (EA)  staff;  (v)  ensure  the  government  can  take  quick  action  to  match  ADB\u2019s  rapid \nresponse  to  disasters;  (vi)  because  beneficiary  participation  is  key,  increase  the  role  of \nbeneficiaries in project preparation, implementation, and maintenance of facilities; (vii) consider \nenvironment and social aspects during project implementation, even though the need for a rapid \nresponse  may  not  permit  detailed  examination  of  these  issues  prior  to  approval  of  the \nassistance;  (viii)  provide  arrangements  for  disbursements,  including  retroactive  financing  and \nthe use of imprest accounts, to give EAs quick and simple access to funds; (ix) carefully define \nproject  objectives  and  scope;  (x)  ensure  criteria  for  subproject  selection  permit  simple \n\n                                                 \n12  In  addition  livelihood  activity  in  areas  not  covered  by  ADB  would  be  supported  by  the  International  Fund  for \n\nAgricultural Development  which is due to provide approximately $30 million in additional funding.  \n\n13  ADB.  2004.

Since  the  Gujarat  earthquake \nemergency assistance, ADB strategy has been to support the national and state governments \nand other stakeholders to overcome exogeneous shocks caused by calamities. This is to enable \nearly restoration of economic and social activity in affected areas, especially for the poor. The \nstrategy is designed to ensure that emergency assistance projects provide a bridging function to \nameliorate the impacts of the disaster and dovetail into the development process selecting the \nhighest  priority  needs  for  emergency  assistance  in  consultation  with  the  Government,  state \ngovernments, civil society, and other stakeholders, including other donors.  \n \nBased  on  the  JAM  report  (para.  5),  the  TEAP  identifies  specific  sectors  in  particular \n30. \naffected  states.  The  TEAP  therefore  seeks  to  (i)  build  on  the  immediate  relief  provided  in  the \ntsunami-affected states by Government and development partners; (ii) contribute to coordinated \nrehabilitation and reconstruction in sectors by different development partners guided by the JAM \nreport  and  the  Government;  (iii)  specifically  address  sustainable  recovery  priorities  by  way  of \nsupport  for  direct  livelihood  restoration  complemented  by  indirect  livelihood  support  through \npublic  infrastructure  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction,  which  generates  public  employment  and \nunderpins the restoration of livelihood activities by providing roads, public buildings and lighting, \nsanitation,  and  the  like;  (iv)  support  disaster  prevention  by  linking  national  and  regional \ndevelopment  of  rapid  early  warning  systems  through  community-based  public  awareness  to \ncore public infrastructure such as key bridges, which provide for evacuation; and (v) provide a \nplatform through short- and medium-term reconstruction for longer term development of disaster \nprevention  such  as  coastal  erosion  projects.15  In  doing  so,  TEAP  design  draws  on  ADB \nexperience  in  delivering  emergency  assistance  acquired  in  different  developing  member \ncountries  over  the  past  2  decades,  and  complements  relief  and  other  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction  assistance  provided  by  the  Government,  UN  agencies,  NGOs,  bilateral \ndevelopment partners, and the World Bank. By meeting the tsunami reconstruction needs of the \nnext 3  years, the TEAP is consistent with ADB Policy on Disaster and Emergency Assistance \n2004  and  the  Asian  Tsunami  Fund  (ATF)  Paper  2005.16  The  TEAP  also  provides  a  platform \nconsistent  with  longer  term  development  plans  of  the  Government  in  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan \nthe \n(2002\u20132007)  as  reflected \nrecommendations of the Twelfth Finance Commission as adopted by the Government in 2005, \nand state development plans.  \n \n\nthe  ADB  country  strategy  and  program \n\nIndia, \n\nfor \n\nin \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  TEAP  will  support  efforts  of  the  Government  of  Tamil  Nadu  (GOTN)  and \n31. \nGovernment of Kerala (GOK) to (i) restore the livelihood and economic activities of the affected \npopulation, (ii) accelerate poverty alleviation in the tsunami-affected areas who are vulnerable to \nhigh  incidence  of  poverty,  and  (iii)  rehabilitate  and  reconstruct  public  and  community-based \ninfrastructure that are vulnerable to natural disasters.  \n\n                                                 \n14  ADB. 2004.

In  this  respect,  ADB  and  the \nGovernment have agreed to undertake a small-scale TA in 2005, with the objective of formulating a comprehensive \nprogram of \u201chard\u201d (such as dikes/seawalls) and \u201csoft\u201d options (coastal vegetation/habitat enrichment) on integrated \ncoastal zone management. The importance of this initiative has been heightened following the tsunami. \n\n16 ADB. 2005. Asian Tsunami Fund. Manila (R65-05). \n\n\f \n\n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n \n\n9\n\n1. \n\nPart A: Livelihoods  \n\n32. \nThe  TEAP  comprises  four  components:  (i)  livelihoods,  (ii)  transportation,  (iii)  rural  and \nmunicipal  infrastructure,  and  (iv)  capacity  building  and  implementation  assistance.  These \ncomponents  are  designed  to  operate  in  a  mutually  supportive  fashion  to  achieve  the  overall \nobjective  of  mitigating  the  tsunami  loss  to  the  affected  communities  in  terms  of  livelihoods, \nassets, productivity, and improved disaster resilience. \n \n \n \nThis  component17  includes  (i)  providing  microenterprise  training  and  establishment \n33. \nsupport  to  restore  the  livelihoods  of  the  directly  and  indirectly  affected  poor  and  low-income \nhouseholds,  already  organized  into  SHGs  and  other  similar  groups  recognized  by  state \ngovernments  as  affected  by  the  tsunami;18  (ii)  forming  new  SHGs  (both  male  and  female \nmembers)  for  affected  households  not  yet  organized  in  community-based  groups  to  restore \nlivelihoods through microenterprise training and establishment support; (iii) replacing productive \nassets (excluding housing) of tsunami-affected households; (iv) upgrading skills;19 (v) mitigating \nrisks  through  insurance  of  all  affected  households  that  receive  assistance  under  this \ncomponent;20  and  (vi)  restoring  community-based  infrastructure  affected  by  the  tsunami \n(Appendix 4). \n  \n \n \nRoads  and  Bridges.  Considering  that  the  urgent  need  in  Tamil  Nadu  and  Kerala  to \n34. \nrestore  connections  and  to  build  disaster  resilience  and  prevention  is  key  for  transportation \ninfrastructure,  this  subcomponent  will  comprise  (i)  rehabilitating  tsunami\u2013damaged  sections  of \nstate roads (other than village and municipal roads), such as major district roads, other district \nroads,  and  state  highways  in  the  affected  districts  of  Tamil  Nadu  and  Kerala\u2014which  have \nsuffered  breaches,  damaged  shoulders  and  pavements,  and  eroded  protection  works\u2014to  pre-\ntsunami  level  or  to  prescribed  national  standards;21  (ii)  rehabilitating  damaged  drainage \nstructures such as minor bridges, culverts, and side drains; (iii) rehabilitating bridges in affected \nareas  (for  Cuddalore  and  Kannyakumari  districts  of  Tamil  Nadu);  and  (iv)  creating  bridge \nconnections  to  replace  temporary  crossing  arrangements,  for  unbridged  crossings  or  for  river \ncrossing ferries from a disaster prevention perspective (Appendix 5). \n \nPorts  and  Harbors.  Given  the  consequences  for  fishing  communities  as  a  result  of \n35. \ndamage to harbors and minor ports, the ports and harbors subcomponent includes (i) providing \npriority dredging for ports, harbor basins, and approach channels; (ii) rehabilitating breakwaters \nfor ports and fishing harbors; (iii) rehabilitating fishing harbor facilities such as compound walls; \n(iv)  rehabilitating  damaged  roads  and  ports  facilities,  such  as  electrification  systems,  wharfs, \n\nPart B: Transportation \n\n2. \n\n                                                 \n17 The scope excludes sector issues relating to fisheries, agriculture, and livelihoods including their asset replacement \nexpected to be funded from other sources. Livelihood restoration relating to these segments (SHG formation, skills \ndevelopment,  and  microenterprise  establishment  support)  is  covered  in  view  of  the  inextricable  linkages  in  the \ncostal economies as well as the need for coordinated implementation for cost-efficient service delivery.  \n\n18  Establishment support includes provision of seed capital to SHGs. \n19 Skills development intervention is kept generic to ensure participation of community groups as well as individuals. \n\nThis could include fisheries and allied activities undertaken by poor and low-income households. \n\n20  At  this  stage,  insurance  products  covered  by  Swarnajayanthi  Grama  Swarozgar  Yojana  (SGSY)  are  envisaged. \n\nHowever, any innovative schemes will also be available for ADB support. \n\n21  Rehabilitation  will  also  entail  regular  road  safety  audits  to  ensure  that  road  rehabilitation  is  accompanied  by  due \n\nregard to road safety. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nand  piers;  and  (v)  procuring  equipment  such  as  a  destroyed  dredger  and  navigation  aids \n(Appendix 6). \n \n\n3. \n\nPart C: Rural and Municipal Infrastructure  \n\n \n36.  Water Supply and Sanitation. Given the serious effects of the tsunami on water supply \nand public hygiene, this subcomponent will include (i) restoring and upgrading damaged water \nsupply  systems,22  (ii)  upgrading  affected  water  supply  systems  into  multivillage  systems  with \nmore  reliable  source  development,  (iii)  rehabilitating/upgrading  sanitary  complex  and  solid \nwaste  management  facilities,  and  (iv)  providing  a  sanitation  and  environmental  awareness \ncampaign23 (Appendix 7). \n \nOther  Rural  and  Municipal  Infrastructure.  Given  the  importance  to  community \n37. \nlivelihoods  of  tsunami-damaged  minor  village  and  municipal  infrastructure,  this  subcomponent \nwill include rehabilitating and upgrading (i) village and municipal roads; (ii) drainage canals; (iii) \npublic buildings such as small-scale common fish-landing, processing, and marketing facilities; \ncommunity  centers;  and  panchayat  offices;  and  (iv)  damaged  electricity  line  network  and \ndistribution  transformers.  Rehabilitation  of  public  buildings  will  consider  disaster-resistant \ndesign, and relocation to safer environment as appropriate (Appendix 8). \n \n\nPart D: Capacity Building and Implementation Assistance \n\n4. \n \n38. \nGiven  the  tight  implementation  schedule  and  the  incremental  burdens  on  EAs  and \nimplementing  agencies  (IAs),  additional  technical  support  will  be  needed.  Under  the  PMU\u2019s \ndirection,  this  component  will  therefore  support  (i)  detailed  assessment  and  verification  of \ndamage in each sector/subsector; (ii) prioritization of subprojects; (iii) preparation of subproject \nappraisal reports in accordance with Government and ADB requirements and selection criteria; \n(iv)  incorporation  of  disaster  resistance  into  the  rapid  planning,  design,  and  implementation  of \nthe  works;  (v)  supervision  and  monitoring  of  works  to  ensure  quality  control  and  transparency \namong  contractors  and  communities  carrying  out  smaller  works;  (vi)  institutional  support  for \naquifer  and  hydrology  study  and  community  participation;  and  (vii)  oversight  of  works  in  each \nsector/subsector  and  provision  of  detailed  accounting,  auditing,  and  reporting  to  the  project \nimplementation units (PIUs), and project management units (PMUs). Given incremental burdens \non  the  EAs  and  IAs,  this  component  will  also  support  incremental  administration  costs,  on \nconveyance, \nincluding  salaries  and \nallowances. \n \nC. \n\nfurniture,  communication  and  equipment,  but  not \n\nSpecial Features \n\n39. \nIntegrated Restoration of Livelihoods and Infrastructure. The TEAP will seek a grant \nfrom  the  ATF  (footnote  15),  established  to  pool  and  channel  emergency  grant  financing  for \ntsunami-related  rehabilitation  activities,  in  proportionate  combination  to  a  loan  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources  (OCR).  This  provides  a  mixed  loan-term  commensurate  with  the \nneeds of the tsunami-affected coastal communities, which were already poor and vulnerable to \nexternal  shocks,  to  mitigate  their  substantial  losses  and  return  them  to  a  higher  growth  path \nthrough an integrated approach. Specifically, this enables the delivery of an effective recovery \npackage,  comprising  the  most  appropriate  mix  of  restoring  livelihood  through  direct support  to \n\n                                                 \n22  This includes provision of tankers for regular supply given water shortages. \n23  The  TEAP  will  link  with  the  Government\u2019s  total  sanitation  program  to  implement  this  activity,  institutionalized \nfollowing the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) TA. The existing program will be extended in the concerned \nsubproject area, using projects funds as necessary.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\nSHGs and replacement of assets, restoration of essential water supply and sanitation services \nfor  critical  drinking  water  and  hygiene  for  vulnerable  communities,  and  reconstruction  of \ncommunity and other productive infrastructure, thereby accelerating the recovery process.  \n \nDonor Collaboration. Building on the JAM report, the TEAP design takes into account \n40. \nproposed  interventions  by  the  UN  and  World  Bank  in  other  sectors.  Such  a  collaborative \napproach  will  maximize  resources,  provide  a  synergy  of  skills,  and  facilitate  harmonized \nimplementation  with  other  donors.  Input  from  NGOs  is  integral  given  the  TEAP\u2019s  thrust  to \nestablish livelihoods and community-based infrastructure. \n \n41. \nImplementation Flexibility and Delegation. Given the community-based substance of \nmany  of  the  TEAP  components,  project  design  also  focuses  on  expeditious  implementation \narrangements  according  to  the  ADB  Disaster  and  Emergency  Policy  2004,  and  the  ATF,  in \nterms  of  procurement  and  consulting  services.  This  is  complemented  by  supervision  and \nmonitoring  by  and  delegation  to  an  ADB  extended  mission  with  offices  in  Tamil  Nadu  and \nKerala, and by community-based and field\u2013level dispute resolution mechanisms such as village \nand district level monitoring committees.24\n \n42. \nQuality  Control  with  Effective  Process  and  Output  Management.  While  the  TEAP \naims  to  restore  the  community  livelihood  and  supporting  infrastructure  in  a  most  expeditious \nmanner,  it  will  also  operate  effective  results-based  management  within  its  implementation \nframework. Specifically, each subproject proposal, prepared in consultation with the concerned \nlocal  government  institutions  and  beneficiaries,  will  set  out  specific  process  and  output \nindicators. Implementation progress will be recorded and reported through the IAs\u2019 field offices, \nand monitored and audited by PMU consultants. Information will also be reported to the village \nand district level monitoring committees. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n43. \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $218.6  million  equivalent,  including  taxes  and \nduties, of which $63.5 million (29.1%) represents foreign exchange costs, including $7.0 million \nof  interest  during  construction  and  other  charges,  and  $155.0  million  equivalent  (70.9%) \nrepresents local currency costs (Table 1, details in Appendix 9). \n \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \n\n \n \nComponent \n\nComponent A: Livelihoods \nComponent B: Transportation \nComponent C: Rural and Municipal \nInfrastructure \nComponent D: Capacity Building \nand Implementation Assistance \nLand Acquisition, Rehabilitation, \nand Resettlement \n\n \nTamil Nadu \n\n \nKerala \n\n \nTotal Cost \n\nFX \n\nLocal Total\n\nFX  Local Total  FX  Local Total\n\n0.1\n9.1\n\n49.9\n17.7\n\n50.0\n26.8\n\n0.1\n11.1\n\n8.8\n12.8\n\n8.9    0.2 \n23.9  20.2 \n\n58.7\n30.5\n\n58.8\n50.7\n\n25.9\n\n37.9\n\n63.8\n\n10.3\n\n11.3\n\n21.6  36.2 \n\n49.1\n\n85.3\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n3.2\n\n0.4\n\n3.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.0\n\n2.0\n\n2.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n5.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.4\n\n0.4 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.8\n\n                                                 \n24  In Tamil Nadu and Kerala, village level committees function as first information and grievance redress tier whose \n\nwork will be facilitated by NGOs.

Grant \nassistance  will  facilitate  restoration  of  livelihoods  of  affected  households  and  critical  drinking \nwater  and  sanitation  systems  with  associated  support  for  public  hygiene  and  health  for \nvulnerable  affected  communities  required  for  expeditious  and  sustained  livelihood  restoration. \nPart  D  on  capacity  building  and \nincremental \nadministration)  will  also  be  grant  funded.  The  complementary  and  integrated  nature  of  these \ncomponents  aims  to  accrue  benefits  to  the  poor  and  low-income  households.  Considering  the \nvarying  pattern  of  tsunami-related  damage  in  Tamil  Nadu  and  Kerala,  the  sector-based \napplication of grant funds implies differential allocations.

After the tsunami, the Government established a \nmulti-disciplinary  core  group  within  the  Planning  Commission  to  plan  and  coordinate  the  post-\ntsunami  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  program  in  the  affected  states  and  union  territories. \nThis core group, headed by a chief coordinator, will consist of an office of the chief coordinator \nand  program  management  consultants.  The  core  group  will  function  as  an  interdepartmental \ncoordination  mechanism  for  collecting  data  on  damages,  losses,  and  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction  needs  and  outlays  for  all  tsunami-affected  areas  in  India.  As  part  of  the \nestablishment  of  a  medium\u2013term  recovery  and  reconstruction  framework  going  forward  a \nNational  Disaster  Management  Framework  has  been  established  by  the  Ministry  of  Home \nAffairs of the Government.  \n \n48. \nProject  Steering  Committees.  GOTN  and  GOK  will  establish  a  State  Level  Steering \nCommittee  in  the  respective  states.  The  SLSC  will  act  as  a  policy  making  body  which  will \nprovide  overall  advice  and  guidance  to  the  state  EAs  associated  with  the  Project.  An \nEmpowered Committee of Tamil Nadu and Kerala will be established and will be chaired by the \nrespective  state\u2019s  chief  secretary  and  will  (i)  provide  policy  guidance  to  the  PMUs;  and  (ii) \nsanction and approval of subprojects and project approvals.  \n \n49. \nExecuting  Agencies.  RADMMD,  the  EA  in  Tamil  Nadu  and  DDM  in  Kerala,  will \nrespectively  ensure  that  it  engages  adequate  permanent  or  fixed-term  required  staff  to \nimplement  the  TEAP.    The  EAs  will  be  delegated  with  all  necessary  powers  to  undertake \nresponsibilities  as  EAs.  RADMMD  and  DDM  will  respectively  establish  a  PMU,  headed  by  a \nproject  director  and  supported  by  a  team  of  consultants  specialized  in  project  management, \ntechnical  aspects,  and  environmental  and  social  issues  as  required.  The  PMU  will  be \nresponsible for (i) providing day-to-day assistance and guidance to the project IAs; (ii) reviewing \nsubprojects  to  satisfy  ADB\u2019s  due  diligence  requirements  and  approving  subproject  proposals \nsubmitted  by  line  departments  and  IAs;  (iii)  managing  and  disbursing  funds;  (iv)  consolidating \nand  submitting  progress  reports  to  the  Empowered  Committee  and  ADB;  (v)  disbursing  funds \nand  accounting  against  a  review  of  financial  reports  provided  by  the  IAs;  and  (vi)  reviewing \ncompliance with specifications and plans, and quality control and transparency requirements by \nbodies undertaking reconstruction works.  \n \n50. \nImplementing  Agencies.  The  concerned  GOTN  line  departments  will  act  as  IAs:  (i) \nHighways Department for the roads and bridges; (ii) Maritime Board for ports; (iii) Department of \nFisheries  for  harbors;  (iv)  Tamil  Nadu  Electricity  Board  for  public  lighting  and  damaged \ndistribution  lines;  (v)  Rural  Development  Department  and  concerned  municipality  for  rural \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\ninfrastructure,  sanitation,  and  the  livelihood  component;26  (vi)  Tamil  Nadu  Water  Supply  and \nDrainage  Board  and  concerned  municipality  for  water  supply;  and  (vii)  Municipal  and \nAdministration Department and concerned municipality for municipal infrastructure. For Kerala, \nthe  concerned  line  departments  to  act  as  IAs  are  (i)  Public  Works  Department  for  roads  and \nbridges,  and  other  rural  and  municipal  infrastructure  other  than  public  lighting  and  power \ndistribution;  (ii)  Kerala  Water  Authority  for  water  supply  and  sanitation;  (iii)  Ports/Harbor \nEngineering  Department  for  ports  and  harbors;  (iv)  Kerala  State  Electricity  Board  for  public \nlighting and power distribution; and (v) Fisheries Department/Kudumbashree using the expertise \nof  accredited  technical  institutions,  NGO  service  providers  or  specialized  agencies  for  the \nlivelihood component. The IAs will have PIUs  for subproject monitoring and implementation of \nsubprojects. Details on the PIUs are in the sector-specific appendixes. \n \nThe IAs are responsible for (i) prioritizing and preparing subproject technical proposals \n51. \nfor the sectors included under the TEAP; (ii) reporting to RADMMD and DDM; (iii) implementing \nreconstruction works and activities; (iv) conducting detailed assessments, surveys, and planning \nof  reconstruction  including  public  consultation  and  input  from  recipient  local  entities  and \nbeneficiaries  as  required;  (v)  prioritizing  works,  and  preparing  detailed  designs,  specifications, \nschedule  of  quantity,  bidding  documents,  contracts,  and  related  documentation;  (vi)  preparing \nregular  progress  reports  for  the  SLSC  and  ADB  through  RADMMD  and  DDM;  and  (vii) \nsupervising  construction,  conducting  quality  control,  approving  progress  payments \nto \ncontractors,  and  maintaining  records  and  accounts  on  an  up-to-date  basis  and  making  these \navailable to ADB, its missions, or auditors for inspection. The project organization structures for \nTamil Nadu and Kerala are in Appendix 10.  \n \nADB Extended Mission. To ensure timely implementation, the responsibility for project \n52. \nadministration will be delegated to India Resident Mission in New Delhi. ADB will also establish \nan  extended  mission  with  two  extended  mission  offices;  one  in  Chennai  and  the  other  in \nThiruvananthapuram27 for the duration of project implementation to closely monitor compliance \nwith  ADB  requirements.  The  extended  mission  offices  will  ensure  quality  control,  speedy \nimplementation  of  subprojects,  and  rapid  assistance  to  RADMMD  and  DDM  and  IAs  on  any \nproject  implementation  matters.  They  will  carry  out  random  spot  checks  on  procurement  and \nproject  accounts  of  subprojects,  and  inspect  project  facilities  for  quality  control  and  proper \nfinancial management. The extended mission offices will be headed by India Resident Mission \nstaff under the direct supervision of the resident mission.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSubproject Selection Criteria and Approval \n\n53. \nThe  IAs  will  formulate  and  propose a  list  of subprojects  through  the  PMUs.  The  PMUs \nwill conduct initial screening of the proposals and submit these to the Empowered Committee in \nTamil  Nadu  and  Kerala  for  final  selection  and  approval  in  accordance  with  general  selection \ncriteria  for  purposes  of  eligibility  and  sector-specific  criteria  for  each  project  component.  The \ngeneral eligibility and sector-specific criteria are listed in Appendix 11. \n \n54. \nThe first two subprojects to be carried out by each IA will be subject to prior review and \napproval by ADB before commencement. Any  subsequent subproject exceeding $500,000 but \nless  than  $3  million  will  be  sent  to  the  PMU  and  ADB  for  information  only,  while  subprojects \nexceeding  $3  million  equivalent  will  require  prior  review  and  approval  by  ADB.  Subprojects \nestimated to cost $500,000 equivalent or less will be subject to approval by the respective PMU \n\n                                                 \n26 The department may use the services of accredited technical institutions and NGO service providers. \n27 Chennai is the administrative capital of Tamil Nadu. Thiruvananthapuram is the administrative capital of Kerala. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15\n\nand  random  audit  and  checks  by  ADB  to  ensure  compliance  with  requirements  of  subproject \nselection criteria and implementation arrangement.  \n\n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n55. \nAs  the  TEAP  is  for  emergency  assistance,  implementation  will  start  immediately  after \napproval  and  be  completed  within  36  months.28  A  detailed  implementation  schedule  is  in \nAppendix 12.  \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement  \n\n \n\nfollowing \n\ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures. \n\n56. \nProcurement of goods, services, and works will be carried out in accordance with ADB \nGuidelines  for  Procurement  (2004)  and  the  contemplated  implementation  schedule.  ADB\u2019s \nprocedure  for  providing  reconstruction  assistance  after  disasters  allows  for  flexibility  so  that \nproject activities can start promptly. Local competitive bidding procedures will be the preferred \nmode  of  procurement.  The  local  procurement  procedures  of  the  state  governments  are \nacceptable,  with  some  minor  amendments  such  as  ADB\u2019s  disapproval  of  disclosure  of  the \nbudget for the package and invitation of bids on a percentage rate basis.  \n \nProcurement  of  goods  and  related  services  estimated  at  more  than  $1,000,000  will  be \n57. \nInternational  shopping \nprocured \nprocedures will be followed for procurement of goods and related services estimated at between \n$100,000 and $1,000,000. For small, specialized equipment and materials contracts valued less \nthan $100,000, direct procurement procedures acceptable to ADB will be followed.  \n \n58.   Civil works contracts over $10 million will be procured through international competitive \nbidding,  and  those  estimated  to  cost  $10 million  or  less  will  be  procured  through  local \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Postqualification  with  single-  or  two-\nenvelope  procedures  and  usage  of  the  existing  contractor  registration  system  is  acceptable. \nADB  will  conduct  prior  review  of  bidding  documents  and  award  recommendations  for  all \npackages  estimated  to  cost  $1,000,000  and  above.  For  contracts  estimated  to  cost  less  than \n$1,000,000,  ADB  will  review  and  approve  the  first  two  contracts  for  each  IA.  Once  ADB  is \nsatisfied with the EA\u2019s procurement procedures, post-facto approval procedures will be followed. \nHowever, at a later stage, if ADB determines that its guidelines were not followed, ADB may not \napprove  the  award  or  terms  of  the  contract  and  the  Government  cannot  use  loan  or  grant \nproceeds to finance the contract. If the loan or grant proceeds are already used to finance such \ncontracts  at  the  time  of  such  determination,  the  Government  will  refund  to  ADB  any  such \nexpenditure  incurred.  Rebidding  and  extension  of  bid  validity  will  be  subject  to  ADB  prior \napproval.  Community  participation  in  procurement  of  small  works  of  a  simple  nature  is \nencouraged.29 \n\n                                                 \n28  Given  the  implementation  challenges  in  certain  sectors,  a  36-month  implementation  schedule  under  the  ADB \n\nDisaster and Emergency Assistance Policy is considered appropriate. \n\n29  To  encourage  community  participation  and  use  of  indigenous  materials,  methods  to  incorporate  community \nparticipation  in  procurement  may  be  used  for  rural  and  municipal  infrastructure.  Small  works  contract  with  an \nestimated  cost  of  $20,000  or  less  in  each  case  may  be  awarded  to  community  organizations  in  accordance  with \npractices and procedures acceptable to ADB. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nThe TEAP will require a total of 645 person-months of domestic consulting.30 The outline \n\n \n59. \nterms of reference for the consultants are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \nAll  consultants31  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \n60. \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. The consulting services will be provided through quality- and cost-based selection \nof  one  or  more  consulting  firms  using  simplified  technical  proposals  or  through  individual \nconsultants.  Since  the  TEAP  will  be  completed  within  36  months,  selection  and  fielding  of \nconsultants must be expeditious. Streamlined procedures for consultant recruitment under ADB \nAssistance for Tsunami-Affected Developing Member Countries (15 February 2005) will apply. \n\n \n\n6. \n\nAdvance Action \n\n \nGiven  the  urgency  of  the  TEAP,  advance  action  was  approved  for  the  procurement  of \n61. \ngoods,  services,  and  civil  works,  and  recruitment  of  consultants.  The  Government  has  been \nadvised that ADB\u2019s approval of such advance action does not commit ADB to finance the TEAP.  \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements  \n\n \n62. \nIn  accordance  with  the  ADB  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy,  quick \ndisbursement is key to effective and timely emergency assistance. Given the emergency nature \nof the Project and the financial management in both Tamil Nadu and Kerala,32 the disbursement \narrangements of the state governments are considered appropriate. Immediately after the loan \nand  grant  are  effective,  the  Government  will  establish  two  imprest  accounts  (one  for  loan \nproceeds  and  one  for  grant  proceeds)  operated  by  the  comptroller  of  aid  accounts  and  audit. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  imprest  advance  will  be  released  to  the  EAs  when  requested  as \nreimbursement of the expenditure already incurred under the project.  \n \n63. \nThe initial deposits into each of the imprest accounts will not exceed 5% of the loan and \ngrant  amount.  This  amount  will  be  disbursed  to  the  SGIAs:  $7  million  for  the  Tamil  Nadu \naccount  and  $3  million  for  Kerala.  Thereafter  the  aggregate  drawdowns  into  the  two  imprest \naccounts will not exceed the lesser of the equivalent of 3 months of current project expenditures \nor  5%  of  the  total  loan  and  grant  amount  for  the  respective  imprest  accounts,  and  will  be \nestimated based on actual disbursements expected under contracts over the upcoming months. \nProcedures under ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook dated January 2001, as amended from \ntime  to  time,  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  between  the  Government  and  ADB, \nincluding the statement of expenditures (SOE)  procedure, will be adopted for reimbursing and \nliquidating eligible expenditures. Any individual payment which is to be reimbursed or liquidated \nunder  the  SOE  procedure  should  not  exceed  $100,000  per  payment,  except  as  ADB  may \notherwise  agree  during  project  implementation.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  operated  by  the \ncomptroller  of  aid  accounts  and  audit,  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (January  2001)  and  Interim  Guidelines  for  Disbursement  Operations  for  LIBOR-\nBased Loan Products. \n                                                 \n30  Tamil Nadu is allocated 227 person-months and Kerala 418 person-months. These will be provided by consulting \n\nservices contracts for each state. \n\n31  Consultant activity will be under part D of the TEAP. \n32  The  World  Bank  has  undertaken  a  financial  management  assessment  for  Tamil  Nadu;  financial  management  \nrelated reforms in Kerala have been supported under ADB\u2019s Modernizing Government and Fiscal Reform in Kerala \nProgram dated 27 November 2002. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n64. \nAs agreed in donor coordination discussions guided by the Government, ADB has been \nrequested to provide a resource envelope of $200 million, comprising $100 million of ATF grants \nand a $100 million OCR loan, for tsunami emergency assistance in the two states across three \nsectors. Some parts of these sectors were considered to be more suitable for grant financing, \nwhereas  others  were  considered  to  be  more  appropriate  for  OCR  financing.  All  of  this  has \nresulted  in  technical  and  operational  complexities  under  the  proposed  TEAP  which  could  not \nhave  been  anticipated  at  the  time  the  ATF  Paper  was  considered  by  the  Board  in  February \n2005. Thus, project components identified for ATF grant financing would be expected to move \nat  a  different  implementation  speed  than  those  Project  components  identified  for  OCR \nfinancing.33  For  example,  infrastructure  components  financed  by  OCR  will  require  competitive \nbidding  procedures  which  would  impose  their  own  timelines.  This  would  make  pro  rata \ndrawdowns  impractical  and  untenable  for  purposes  of  implementation  of  the  Project. \nConsequently, a waiver of the pro rata provisions of paragraph 11 of the ATF Paper is required. \nHowever,  while  the  technical  form  of  the  pro  rata  drawdown  provision  in  paragraph  11  of  the \nATF Paper cannot be met by the Project\u2019s component wise disbursement pattern34 and waiver \nof  that  provision  is  therefore  necessary  for  the  effective  implementation  of  the  Project,  the \nsubstantive intent of a blended facility for India through the ATF is satisfied by the Government\u2019s \nassurance  and  state  governments\u2019  commitment  to  fully  utilize  the  entire  resource  envelope  of \nOCR  and  grant  resources  for  the  Project.  Such  intent is  underpinned  by  the  magnitude  of  the \ndemand for tsunami rehabilitation and reconstruction for the states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala35 \nwhich  exceeds  expenditure  available  through  domestic  financing,  and by  the  priority  accorded \nby Government to rehabilitation and reconstruction of infrastructure which has been specifically \nidentified for ADB\u2019s OCR financing. \n \n65. \nThe Government has agreed that the state governments will receive the loan and grant \nproceeds on a back-to-back basis as of 1 April 2005 (in line with recommendations of the 12th \nFinance  Commission  of  India),  and  that  the  IAs  will  receive  the  ADB  financing  proceeds  as \ngrants  from  GOTN  and  GOK  for  all  the  components.  The  IAs  will  be  required  to  maintain \nsubproject accounts for each component to reflect the use of loan and grant proceeds.  \n \n\n8. \n\nRetroactive Financing \n\n \n66. \nADB has agreed to the provision of retroactive financing of up to 20% of Loan and Grant \nproceeds, provided that expenditures are incurred in accordance with agreed procedures. The \nprovision of retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n\n9. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\na. \n\nReports  \n\n \n \n \n67. \nRADMMD  and  DDM  will  establish  a  reporting  system  for  quarterly  progress  reports  on \nperformance monitoring, issues resolution, and action plans. These will serve as management \nfeedback  to  update  and  improve  procedures,  and  provide  the  basis  for  a  quarterly  report  to \nADB.  A  consolidated  annual  report  on  subprojects  financed  will  be  submitted  by  ADB  to  the \nBoard. The action plans will incorporate quantitative and time-bound implementation targets and \nbudget requirements. The action plans will be approved by the, IAs, PMUs, and ADB. Within 3 \n\n                                                 \n33  See paragraph 46 of the RRP. \n34  Supplementary Appendix C provides details on indicative disbursement schedules for grant\u2013financed and OCR\u2013\n\nfinanced Project components. \n\n35  See paragraph 6 and Appendix 2, Table A2.2. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nmonths  of  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  GOTN  and  GOK  will  provide  ADB,  through \nRADMMD  and  DDM,  with  an  overall  project  completion  report  providing  detailed evaluation  of \nproject design, costs, contractor and consultant performance, social and economic impact, and \nother details requested by ADB. \n \n68. \nRegular field review will be carried out by the staff from ADB\u2019s extended mission offices \nin conjunction with the PMUs to monitor physical progress of subprojects and compliance with \nother  ADB  requirements  such  as  procurement,  quality  control,  accounting,  beneficiary \nparticipation,  and  NGO  consultation  as  applicable.  A  midterm  review,  to  be  conducted  in \nSeptember 2006, will assess the need for changes needed in the implementation arrangements \nto achieve overall project objectives. \n \n\nb. \n\nAccounts and Audit \n\n \n69. \nThe  Government  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  for  the  Loan  and  Grant \nImprest  Accounts.  The  state  governments  operating  through  their  respective  PMUs  and  PIUs \nwill  establish  and  maintain  separate  records  for  subprojects,  works,  goods,  and  services \nfinanced  out  of  loan  and  grant  proceeds.  They  will  also  maintain  separate  project  accounts  in \naccordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  for  all  expenditures  incurred  on  the \nTEAP and subprojects, both from loan and grant proceeds. \n  \n70. \nDetailed  consolidated  annual  project  accounts,  as  maintained  by  the  PMUs,  will  be \naudited  by  independent  auditors  whose  qualifications,  experience,  and  terms  of  reference  are \nacceptable to ADB and will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the end of the fiscal year. \nThe  annual  audit  report  will  include  the  audit  of  the  imprest  accounts,  and  statement  of \nexpenditure procedure, and will specifically include a separate audit opinion on the use of loan \nand  grant  proceeds  through  the  imprest  accounts,  and  compliance  with  statement  of \nexpenditure  procedures.  RADMMD  and  DDM  have  been  made  aware  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \ndelayed  submission,  and  requirements  for  satisfactory  and  acceptable  quality  of  the  audited \naccounts.  \n \n71. \nIn addition to financial audits, the PMUs will monitor quality of delivery of assistance to \nbeneficiaries,  through  performance  audits36  focusing  on  governance,  financial  accountability, \nand transparency done on a random basis and postcompletion audits. \n \n\nc. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n  \n72. \nThe  PMUs  will  carry  out  the  necessary  arrangement  for  a  systematic  project \nperformance  monitoring  system.  A  set  of  performance  monitoring  indicators  to  be  collected \nduring implementation will be identified, and baseline data established for each of the selected \nindicators.  Appendix  4  sets  out  sector-specific  performance  indicators  for  the  livelihood \ncomponent.  The  project  performance  monitoring  system  will  include  performance  monitoring \nindicators  needed  for  preparing  ensuing  projects  in  water  supply  and  sanitation,  rural  and \nmunicipal infrastructure, and transport rehabilitation and reconstruction.  \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n36 Performance audits are a systematic examination of management systems and procedures to facilitate economy, \nefficiency, and effectiveness in using resources and strengthening good governance. They include assessment of \naccounting, internal control systems, and compliance with process standards for timely payments. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nissues  among \n\nSocial and Livelihood Impacts \n\n \nA. \n \nRehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  essential  rural  and  municipal  infrastructure  will \n73. \nmitigate  the  short-  and  medium-term  increases  in  the  incidence  and  severity  of  poverty. \nRestored water supply and improved sanitation coverage will reduce the chronic water poverty \nand vulnerability37 levels among the perennially water-stressed coastal communities. The TEAP \nwill reduce morbidity from potential waterborne diseases and improve the environmental quality \nand  public  health  in  the  coastal  districts.  It  will  reduce  the  burden  of  collection  and  storage  of \nwater,  and  accrue  improved  health,  health  care,  and  productivity  benefits  to  the  communities. \nThe  educational  activities  will  increase  awareness  of  water  conservation,  water  quality, \nthe  coastal  communities.  Rehabilitation  and \nsanitation,  and  hygiene \nreconstruction  of  the  village  and  panchayat  and  municipal  roads  will  improve  local  access  to \nessential  services,  and  support  local  livelihoods  through  labor  opportunities  during  the \nimplementation.  \n \n74. \nThe livelihoods component will restore incomes, upgrade skills, and improve productivity \nand  livelihood  options  among  the  fishing,  farming,  wage  labor,  and  local  microenterprise \nsectors,  especially  focusing  on  coastal  women  and  other  internally  displaced  and  newly \nvulnerable  social  groups.  Risk  mitigation  measures,  such  as  insurance  and  targeted  social \ntransfers, will reduce the vulnerability of the newly created vulnerable groups (widows, orphans, \nsick, and disabled).  \n \nTransport  connectivity  will  enable  the  affected  population  to  resume  their  social  and \n75. \neconomic activities, and access essential social, emergency, and other government welfare and \nrelief  services.  This  will  also  support  livelihood  restoration  by  facilitating  improved  physical \naccess  to  local  fishing  and  commodities  markets,  wage  labor,  and  other  alternative  livelihood \nopportunities.  An  immediate  benefit  for  wage-dependent  households  will  be  in  terms  of  labor \nopportunities  in  construction  work.  Access  to  evacuation  routes,  emergency  relief  measures, \nand  disaster  shelters  will  increase  a  sense  of  physical  security  among  the  people.  Increased \nfamilial  and  community  interaction  will  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  affected  households,  and \nprovide  a  sense  of  social  security.  Improvements  in  maritime  infrastructure  will  protect  fishing \nvessels,  restore  flow  of  goods  and  access  to  markets,  and  improve  people\u2019s  income  coming \nfrom  fishing  and  port  operations.  Benefits  will  also  accrue  in  terms  of  improved  disaster \nmitigation  capacity  and  improved  safety  in  maritime  transport  and  fishing.  These,  along  with \ndisaster-resistant rehabilitation of public buildings, will support improved productivity and quality \nof  life.  Restored  transport  connectivity  will  also  stimulate  investments  in  microenterprises  and \npublic infrastructure.  \n \nFinally,  the  TEAP  will  result  in  increased  community  participation  during  project \n76. \nimplementation,  especially  given  the  social  mobilization  through  livelihood  and  community \ninfrastructure components. It will rebuild the damaged social capital and community networks in \nproject  areas,  and  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  affected  communities  to  livelihood  shocks  and \nnatural disasters. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is attached in Appendix 13.  \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n37 Water supply in coastal areas suffers from low per capita supply and high content of fluoride, sodium, and iron, with \n\nshallow wells facing high levels of salinity in dry seasons. \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n\n \n\nIndigenous People  \n\n77. \nIn both states, land acquisition and resettlement impacts are envisaged. In Tamil Nadu, \nthe  bridge  in  Kannyakumari,  if  it  cannot  be  rebuilt  on  the  original  alignment,  will  have  to  be \nrealigned. In Kerala, the construction of three emergency evacuation bridges in Allapuzha and \nKollam  districts  might  require  land  acquisition  and  cause  resettlement  impacts.  For  all  project \ncomponents,  most  rehabilitation  work  will  be  carried  out  within  the  original  right-of-way,  while \nupgrading them to current engineering standards might require the acquisition of narrow strips \nof  land.  For  the  rehabilitation  of  rural  and  municipal  infrastructure,  power  transmission  lines, \nports  and  harbors,  and  street  lighting,  no  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  impacts  are \nenvisaged. Rehabilitation and construction of new public buildings such as community centers, \npanchayat  offices  and  anganwadi  centers  might  require  small-scale  land  acquisition,  if \ngovernment  land  is  not  available  for  such  buildings  at  suitable  locations.  Resettlement \nframeworks  for  Tamil  Nadu  and  Kerala  (Appendixes  14  and  15)  have  been  formulated  to \nprovide  guidance  in  preparing  resettlement  plans,  if  required  for  any  project  component.  They \noutline  the  policy  and  legal  framework,  procedures,  and  institutional  requirements  for \nresettlement  during  project  implementation.  If  any  unanticipated  impacts  are  identified  during \nproject  implementation,  appropriate  entitlements  will  be  incorporated  in  resettlement  plans  to \nensure they are adequately addressed. \n \nC. \n \n78. \nThe proportion of the tribal population is significantly lower, both in Tamil Nadu (1%) and \nKerala  (0.44%),  than  the  national  average  of  8%.  The  tribal  population  is  concentrated  mostly \nalong the hilly areas in both states, which were not affected by the tsunami. The schedule tribe \nhouseholds  in  the  coastal  areas  in  both  states  earn  their  livelihoods  primarily  through  wage \nearning as agricultural labor and are involved in allied agricultural activities. They are also active \nmembers in SHGs supported by ongoing government programs. With regard to the provision of \nemergency  assistance  to  tsunami-affected  people,  the  TEAP  ensures  that  all  benefits  will  be \nprovided on an equitable basis, with no differential impact on scheduled tribe households. While \nscheduled  tribe  populations  are  among  those  affected,  the  initial  needs  assessment  did  not \nidentify any likely adverse effects arising from their status. The TEAP  will have no impacts on \ntheir  tribal  or  cultural  identity,  or  on  their  social  and  economic  institutions.  However,  if  any \nimpacts  are  identified  during  TEAP  implementation,  such  impacts  will  be  addressed  through \nspecific actions to be formulated according to the approved resettlement frameworks.  \n \nD. \n \n79. \nThe  TEAP  primarily  aims  to  rehabilitate  and  reconstruct  infrastructure  damaged  or \ndestroyed  by  the  tsunami  and  to  restore  livelihoods  of  affected  people.  The  environmental \nimpacts of these activities will be largely limited to the construction phase since the structures \nalready  exist.  Given  the  scale  of  individual  subprojects,  these  impacts  are  not  likely  to  be \nsignificant.  In  the  long  term,  infrastructure  that  is  upgraded  will  result  in  certain  positive \nenvironmental  impacts  due  to  improved  designs  and  facilities.  The  TEAP  will  also  support  the \nexpansion of certain existing facilities and construction of some new structures. These activities \nare  considered  to  be  small-  to  medium-scale  works  and  are  not  considered  likely  to  create \nsignificant  environmental  impacts.  Therefore,  the  TEAP  is  classified  as category  B  in  terms  of \noverall environmental impact. \n \n80. \nThe  TEAP  is  considered  sector-like  in  that  detailed  subproject  designs  will  be \nundertaken  during  implementation.  Consequently,  the  detailed  environmental  assessments  of \nsubprojects  can  also  be  conducted  only  during  implementation.  Therefore,  an  environmental \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n\f \n\n \n\n21\n\nOverall Project Benefits  \n\nassessment  and  review  procedure  framework  was  prepared  to  outline  specific  environmental \nassessment and monitoring procedures that must be adopted when preparing and implementing \nsubprojects.  These  procedures  are  described  in  Supplementary  Appendix  D  and  are \nsummarized in the summary initial environmental examination report (Appendix 16). The initial \nenvironmental  examination  is  provided  in  Supplementary  Appendix  E.  Each  subproject  will \ninitially be subject to a rapid environmental assessment, based on which the appropriate follow-\non  assessment  requirements  will  be  determined.  Given  the  nature  and  scale  of  subprojects, \nthey  are  unlikely  to  require  a  more  detailed  assessment  than  an  initial  environmental \nexamination,  However,  as  an  added  precaution,  the  environmental  assessment  and  review \nprocedure framework does cover the procedures to be followed in the  event that a subproject \nrequires an environmental impact assessment.  \n \nE. \n \n81. \nThe TEAP primarily focuses on rehabilitating and reconstructing damaged or destroyed \ninfrastructure,  and  restoring  livelihoods  of  those  affected  by  the  tsunami.  Project  interventions \nwill therefore result in restoring productivity of the targeted assets, restoring livelihoods, creating \nproductive  livelihood  alternatives  for  beneficiaries,  reducing  poverty  vulnerability  of  newly \nvulnerable  groups,  increasing  labor  opportunities  for  wage-dependent  households,  and \nincreasing  physical  security  and  community  bonds  for  affected  households  through  disaster-\nresistant  infrastructure.  Furthermore,  within  the  targeted  sectors,  the  IAs  will  need  to  prioritize \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  interventions  to  maximize  the  returns  from  the  limited  project \nresources. In addition, the principle of least cost will be applied without compromising the quality \nassurance of the assets created, to ensure maximum utility from resource use.  \n \nF. \n\nRisks \n\n82. \nTo mitigate any lack of adequately strong commitment in implementing the TEAP in an \nefficient and timely manner, so that the livelihood of intended beneficiaries is resolved and the \ntsunami-damaged  or  -destroyed  infrastructure  is  rehabilitated  and  reconstructed,  GOTN  and \nGOK have both committed to provide a high level state steering committee and an Empowered \nCommittee which is chaired by the respective state\u2019s chief secretary for Project monitoring and \napprovals. \n \n83. \nImplementation  risks  related  to  capacity  for  timely  delivery  of  quality  subprojects  in  the \nvarious  project  sectors  will  be  mitigated  in  several  ways.  First,  in  terms  of  implementation \nprocedures,  detailed  subproject  criteria  will  be  developed  in  addition  to  general  subproject \nselection  criteria.  Second,  in  terms  of  implementation  mechanisms,  specific  monitoring \nmechanisms  will  include  regular  financial  audits  as  well  as  regular  design  and  construction \nsupervision and performance audits through random audits and special postcompletion audits. \nTo  undertake  such  supervision  and  performance  auditing,  RADMMD  and  DDM  will  be \nsupported by dedicated PMUs and specialized consulting inputs.38 \n \n84. \nThe  national  and  state  governments  (GOTN  and  GOK)  have  a  strong  governance \nframework that will help combat corruption risks with attendant potential of leakage of funds and \nensure that the assistance reaches the intended victims of the tsunami. These include (i) state \nto  ensure  equitable  and  transparent  distribution  of  rehabilitation,  including  by  publishing  a \ncomputerized  list  of  affected  people;  (ii)  transparency  in  tender  legislation;39  (iii)  transparent \n\n                                                 \n38  RADMMD  in  Tamil  Nadu,  for  example,  intends  to  employ  an  experienced  outside  auditing  consultant  as  chief \n\naccounts officer for tsunami-related projects. \n\n39 For example, Tamil Nadu\u2019s Transparency in Tenders Act 1998, and Transparency in Tenders Rules 2000. \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\nbeneficiary  identification  through  community  participation;40  (iv)  field  monitoring  through \nmechanisms  like  district  committees,  which  will  encompass  consultative  processes  with \npanchayati  raj  institutions  and  NGOs;  and  (v)  financial  control  mechanisms  will  build  on  the \nfinancial  management  capacity  of  GOTN41  and  GOK.42  The  robust  Indian  integrity  framework \nwill  be  further  supported  by  close  monitoring  by  ADB  extended  mission  offices,  which  will \nundertake random spot checks during TEAP implementation. \n \n\nV.  \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the national Government, GOTN, and GOK have \n\n \n85. \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \nImplementation  Arrangements.  GOTN  and  GOK  will  set  up  the  SLSCs,  Empowered \n86. \nCommittees, PMUs (including the project directors) and PIUs within not more than 1 month from \nproject effectiveness.  \n \nGOTN  and  GOK  will  delegate  RADMMD  and  DDM  and  the  respective  IAs  with  all \n87. \nnecessary  powers,  and  provide  them  with  adequate  competent  and  qualified  personnel  for \neffective execution of the Project.  \n \nGOTN  and  GOK  will  ensure  that  all  subprojects  follow  the  agreed  processing  and \n88. \nselection  criteria  and  implementation  arrangements,  and  that  all  subprojects  are  properly \nmonitored as agreed with ADB. Any subproject that does not follow such agreed requirements \nwill not be eligible for ADB financing under the Project. \n \n89. \nSocial  and  Environmental  Safeguards.  GOTN  and  GOK  will  ensure  that  the  Project, \nincluding the subprojects, is undertaken in compliance with applicable national and state laws, \nincluding  Coastal  Regulation  Zone  requirements  and  ADB  Environment  Policy,  2002.  As \napplicable, subprojects will be prepared in accordance with requirements of the environmental \nassessment  and  review  procedure  framework  as  agreed  with  ADB,  including  any  revisions \nrequired  on  account  of  detailed  designs.  Subprojects  that  do  not  satisfy  the  selection  criteria \nunder  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedure  framework  will  not  be  included \nunder  the  Project,  and  for  those  that  require  an  initial  environmental  examination,  the \nexamination  and  related  environment  management  and  monitoring  plan  will  be  prepared  for \nfurther design and implementation. All applicable national and state clearances will be obtained \nfor the subproject prior to award of contracts under the subproject. In the exceptional cases of \nsubprojects  that  require  an  environmental  impact  assessment,  the  environmental  impact \nassessment  will  be  prepared  according  to  the  procedures  specified  in  the  Environmental \nAssessment  and  Review  Procedures  Framework  and  approved  by  GOTN  and  GOK  and  ADB \nprior to approval of the subproject. \n \n90. \nLand acquisition and resettlement under the Project will be (i) minimized and limited to \nunencumbered public lands to the extent possible that is not squatted upon and (ii) carried out \nin  accordance  with  applicable  national  and  state  laws,  and  ADB  Policy  on  Involuntary \n\n                                                 \n40  For example, Kudumbashree has a series of indicators for identifying poor beneficiaries related to land, housing, \n\nand the like.   \n\n41  The  World  Bank  assessed  the  financial  management  capacity  of  GOTN  as  part  of  its  tsunami  emergency \n\nassistance, which is due to be considered by the World Bank\u2019s Board of Directors in April 2005.  \n\n42  The  financial  management  capacity  of  GOK  has  been  strengthened  as  a  result  of  ADB\u2019s  2002  Modernizing \nGovernment and Fiscal Reform in Kerala Program. See ADB. 2005. Modernizing Government and Fiscal Reform in \nKerala  Program  Loan  1974-IND:  Progress  Report\u2013Release  of  Second  Tranche  and  Major  Change  in  Scope. \nManila (R80-05, 2 March 2005).\n\n\f \n\n \n\n23\n\nResettlement,  1995.  Any  subproject  involving  resettlement  under  the  ADB  policy  will  require \npreparation  and  implementation  of  a  resettlement  plan  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement \nframework as agreed with ADB. Such resettlement plan (including any revisions on account of \ndetailed designs) will be subject to ADB approval prior to award of civil works contract under the \nsubproject.  \n \n91. \nIn  case  of  impacts  to  indigenous  peoples  (including  scheduled  tribes)  under  any \nsubproject,  the  requirements  of  the  ADB  Indigenous  Peoples\u2019  Policy,  1998  will  be  followed, \nincluding  preparation  of  specific  actions  as  set  out  in  the  resettlement  frameworks  as  agreed \nwith ADB.  \n \n92.   Participation. GOTN and GOK will ensure that RADMMD, DDM, and the IAs seek the \nparticipation  of  government  and  nongovernment  organizations  and  communities,  particularly \nwomen,  in  the  selection,  design,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction of rural infrastructure and other activities under the livelihood components under \nthe  project.  Community  based  dispute  resolution  mechanisms  will  be  established  to  address \ndisputes if any under the project, including between people in the tsunami\u2013affected areas. The \nNGOs and communities will maintain proper records and information about their activities and \nuse of funds under the project and will be subject to audit by the respective EA for the state. \n \nGOTN and GOK will ensure that installments of assistance (including cash) provided to \n93. \nSHGs  and  individual  beneficiaries  under  livelihoods  will  be  against  suitable  identification, \nrecords,  verifications  and  certifications;  and  ensure  that  all  SHGs  and  beneficiaries  assisted \nunder the Project comprise overall 50% women and 3% disabled. \n \nGOTN and GOK, through RADMMD and DDM, will undertake periodic reviews (with due \n94. \nparticipation  of  NGOs  and  community-based  organizations) \nthe  scope, \nimplementation  arrangements,  benefit  monitoring  in  accordance  with  the  project  performance \nmonitoring system, and progress and achievement of the project objectives. \n\nto  evaluate \n\n \n\n95. \nDisbursements,  Accounts,  and  Audit.  The  Government  will  upon  receipt  of  the \nadvances from ADB into the two imprest accounts, ensure immediate and full transfers of such \nadvances to GOTN and GOK as and when requested. \n \n96. \nGOTN and GOK will ensure that proper accounting and audit procedures are in place to \nensure  efficient  and  economic  use  of  the  ADB  financing  proceeds.  Accounts  and  financial \nstatements  in  relation  to  the  Project  and  the  subprojects  will  be  maintained  and  certified  by \nindependent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  RADMMD  and  DDM,  through  GOTN  and  GOK,  will \nprovide such accounts and financial statements to ADB on a quarterly basis within 45 days of \nthe  close  of  each  such  quarter.  The  independent  auditor  will  assist  the  operations  of  the \nproject\u2019s  financial  management  systems  in  each  state,  including  review  of  internal  control \nmechanisms  and  prompt  identification  of  problems,  timely  corrective  actions  and  systematic \nrecommendations for enhanced accountability and transparency. \n \n97. \nrandom checks on the flow of funds through the imprest accounts.  \n \n98. \nundertake performance audits on a random basis and post completion audits. \n \n99. \nQuality Control. GOTN and GOK will ensure that the rehabilitation and reconstruction \nof affected infrastructure under the project includes strengthened seismic, high wind (cyclone), \n\nThe Government,  GOTN, and  GOK will allow  ADB representatives to carry out spot or \n\nThe Government, GOTN, and GOK will allow independent auditors acceptable to ADB to \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\nstorm surges, earthquake, tsunami and flood resistance provisions as feasible, and road safety \naudits to be undertaken for roads rehabilitated or reconstructed as well as monitor and ensure \nquality control of materials used in rehabilitation and reconstruction under the project. \n\n \n100.   ADB Extended Mission. The provisions of the Agreement between the Government of \nIndia  and  ADB  regarding  the  Resident  Office  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  dated  18 \nNovember 1992 will apply to the ADB extended mission offices in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, to be \noperative for the duration of project implementation. \n \n101.  The Government, GOTN, and GOK will, as required, extend full cooperation to the ADB \nextended mission offices in Tamil Nadu and Kerala in their activities, particularly in monitoring \nand random and spot checks on the procurement and accounts of the Project and subprojects \nand inspection of the project facilities for quality control.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  and  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n102. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the President, \nunder the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the \nBoard approve \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  grant  of  $100,000,000  to  India  from  ADB\u2019s  Asian  Tsunami  Fund,  provided \nthat any withdrawal in excess of $50,000,000 shall be subject to the availability of \nthe  Asian  Tsunami  Fund  resources,  for  the  Tsunami  Emergency  Assistance \n(Sector) Project, on terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose  set  forth  in  the  draft  Financing  and  Project  Agreements  presented  to  the \nBoard, and on the basis that the pro-rata provisions of paragraph 11 of the Asian \nTsunami Fund Paper are waived; and \nthe  loan  of  $100,000,000  to  India  for  the  Tsunami  Emergency  Assistance \n(Sector)  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a term of 32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Financing and \nProject Agreements presented to the Board. \n\nJoseph B.

As advised by \nthe Government, the JAM did not include assessment of the impact and losses sustained in the \nUnion Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. \n \n2. \nA  group  of  experts  and  specialists  from  different  sectors  and  disciplines  analyzed  the \ndamage and losses as well as the needs expressed by the relevant state authorities and Union \nTerritory  administration,  made  field  visits  to  the  most  affected  districts,  and  undertook\u2014on  a \nsample  basis\u2014consultations  with  local  experts,  members  of  civil  society,  and  nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs).  The  damage  and  losses  presented  (Table  A2.1)  reflect  the  available \ninformation compiled during the JAM (1\u201315 February 2005). This is not a final assessment since \na number of surveys and specialist sector analyses are ongoing.  \n \n\nTable A2.1: Summary of Damages and Losses  \n($ million) \n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n  \n\nTotal \n\n481.37 \n\n48.50 \n125.79 \n838.32 \n56.38 \n\n16.68 \n57.62 \n327.70 \n8.20 \n\nDamage and losses \nLosses \n\nDamage \n31.82 \n68.17 \n510.62 \n48.18 \n\n658.79 \n193.49 \n13.68 \n15.13 \n320.06 \n19.72 \n27.99 \n35.15 \n33.56 \n\n410.20 \n35.19 \n9.98 \n22.39 \n304.24 \n36.45 \n1.63 \n0.32 \n0.00 \n200.69 \n\nEffects on \nLivelihoods \n35.58 \n82.55 \n332.80 \n30.44 \n\n \nItem \nAndhra Pradesh \nKerala \nTamil Nadu \nPondicherry \n  \nTotal (by sector) \nHousing \nHealth and Education \nAgriculture and Livestock \nFisheries \nMicroenterprises and Other \nRural and Municipal Infrastructure \nTransportation \nCoastal Protection \nReliefa\na  Relief provided by the local, state, and national governments. \nSources: Mission estimates on the basis of information made available by the governments and direct observation. \n \n3. \nOverall damage is estimated to be approximately $660 million and losses are estimated \nto be approximately $410 million. While the largest proportion of the damage is concentrated in \nfisheries, housing and infrastructure, material private asset damages related to coastal fisheries, \nagriculture,  and  microenterprises  have  been  incorporated  into  the  respective  sectors.  Losses \nrelated to livelihoods in these sectors are of particular significance because they accentuate the \nexisting  vulnerability  to  poverty  of  the  coastal  fisheries  communities,  agriculture,  and \nmicroenterpises.  \n \n4. \nlosses  neither  supersede  nor  disregard \nassessments  of  damage  and  needs  made  locally.  They  present  a  consolidated  view,  on  the \nbasis  of  relevant  information  received  and  the  expertise  of  the  multi-institutional  and \ninterdisciplinary JAM team. These lead to certain observations on damages and losses suffered: \n\n1,068.99 \n228.68 \n23.66 \n37.52 \n624.30 \n56.17 \n29.62 \n35.47 \n33.56 \n200.69 \n\nThese  quantifications  of  damage  and \n\n42.05 \n383.16 \n56.16 \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n31 \n\nThe disaster is having a significant impact on the states\u2019 livelihoods (about 38% \nof the total damage and losses imposes negative consequences on livelihoods) in \nthe coastal environment and the local economy. In particular, this report provides \na  measure  of  the  economic  impact  of  the  tsunami  on  the  fisheries  sector  and \nrelated  livelihood  in  coastal  communities  of  the  affected  states  and  Union \nTerritory  of  Pondicherry.  The  report  attempts  to  highlight  some  social  issues \nrelevant for the reconstruction process, in the context of the states\u2019 and national \ndevelopment strategies. \n\nAt  this  juncture,  the  affected  areas  have  already  moved  from  relief  to \nreconstruction\u2014although  for  some  sectors  and  groups  of  affected  people  relief \nwill  still  continue  for  several  months.  During  this  transition,  the  protection  of  the \nmost  vulnerable  segments  of  the  displaced  population  and  the  improvement  of \ntheir  living  conditions  in  temporary  shelters  over  the  coming  months  deserves \nspecial attention. \n\nThe JAM recommends that national and state authorities pursue a risk mitigating \nreconstruction  process  in  the  face  of  damage  resulting  from  specific  recurrent \nhazards  that  the  tsunami  has  just  put  in  clearer  perspective:  Disaster  is  a  wake \nup call to face vulnerability and better manage risk. \n\nThe need for such a risk-mitigating reconstruction process reduces vulnerability in \nthe medium term; increases resilience to specific local multihazards; and inserts \nitself in the larger district, state, and national development strategies: Disaster is \nan opportunity to upscale and accelerate the development process.  \n\nGiven  the  damage  to  housing  and  infrastructure,  the  provision  of  permanent \nsolutions  to  housing  and  restoration  of  infrastructure  are  an  immediate  priority \nand  require  commitment  of  resources  that  may  not  be  delayed.  Investment  in \nthese  and  location  of  the  new  infrastructure  (in  terms  of  relocation  of  housing, \nrestoration,  or  construction  of  urban  and  rural  infrastructure  and  resilience-\nincreasing measures such as locally adapted and environmentally sound coastal \nprotection) are tied to overarching policy decisions in terms of appropriate coastal \nregulation and risk management, some of which have significant costs and social \nand financial implications in the districts and states affected. \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\nThe impact of the disaster varies from state to state both in absolute terms and in \nterms of the relative weight it has on each of the local economies. \n\n \nThe needs (Table A2.2) reflect the short-term (within 1 year) and medium-term (up to 3 \n5. \nyears)  requirements.  This  table  does  not  include  longer  term  reconstruction  needs  which  are \nsignificant  in  areas  such  as  housing,  rural  and  municipal  infrastructure,  transportation,  and \ncoastal protection. Assessment of long-term needs can only be reliably undertaken after further \ndetailed studies. \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\n  \n Item \n\nTable A2.2: Post-Tsunami Reconstruction Needs \n($ million) \n\nReconstruction Needs \nMedium-Term \nReconstruction \n\n \nTotal \n72.39 \n153.12 \n867.14 \n120.03 \n\nShort-Term \nReconstruction \n26.20 \n83.45 \n247.65 \n42.06 \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n46.19 \n69.67 \n619.49 \n77.97 \n\n813.31 \n328.81 \n2.71 \n13.23 \n231.48 \n108.68 \n73.99 \n27.65 \n18.62 \n8.15 \n\n1,212.68 \n488.81 \n16.63 \n21.59 \n285.54 \n178.63 \n97.48 \n69.12 \n38.16 \n16.72 \n\nAndhra Pradesh \nKerala \nTamil Nadu \nPondicherry \n  \n399.37 \nTotal (by sector) \n160.00 \nHousing \n13.92 \nHealth and education \n8.36 \nAgriculture and livestock \n54.07 \nFisheries \nMicroenterprises and othersa\n69.95 \n23.49 \nRural and municipal infrastructure \n41.47 \nTransportation \n19.54 \nCoastal protection \nHazard and risk management \n8.57 \na  Wage laborers having seasonal employment or engaged in intermittent subsistence activities during lean periods. \nSources: JAM estimates on the basis of states\u2019 statements and memoranda. \n \n6. \nOverall  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  needs  are  estimated  at  $1.2  billion,  over  the \nshort-  to  medium-term.  The  estimates  take  into  account  that  damaged  assets  need  to  be \nreplaced  with  new  ones,  not  only  of  equal  value,  but  with  upgrades  to  services  and \ninfrastructure in order to reduce the previous inherent vulnerability. \n \nThe  tsunami  has  highlighted  underlying  vulnerabilities  to  recurrent  hazards  and  the \n7. \nmajor  negative  social  consequences  of  such  disasters  on  the  livelihood  of  groups  of  the \npopulation  already  in  the  lower  levels  of  the  development  process.  Its  consequences  for  the \nlivelihood of the worst affected productive sectors (fisheries and, to a lesser extent, agriculture) \nspill over to the livelihood of the rest of the community, beyond the actually physically affected \nareas. \n \n8. \nThe  systemic  analysis  undertaken  highlights  the  cross-cutting  nature  of  the  disaster\u2019s \nimpact,  and  thus  the  multisectoral,  interinstitutional,  and  multidisciplinary  approach  needed  for \nthe  reconstruction  process.  The  disaster  points  out  the  need  to  undertake  cross-cutting \ninterventions,  with  a  participatory,  equitable,  flexible,  decentralized,  and  transparent  approach \nbeyond  livelihood  restoration.  Better  management  of  the  coastal  environment  and  reinforced \nrisk  reduction  should  be  seen  as  part  of  the  overall  social  and  economic  strategy,  resulting  in \nadoption of realistic, attainable goals in the short- and medium-term. \n \n9. \nBeyond the  immediate response from the national and state governments\u2014in terms of \nthe  allocation  of  calamity  resources  and  providing  the  affected  population  with  material  and \nmonetary relief\u2014the reduction of hazard risk involves the participation of the affected population \nand civil society. Effective hazard risk management in the future should be less dependent on \nrelief and assistance, which draws valuable resources from other development goals. Instead, \nthe community participation needs to be promoted in risk transfer insurance, and community risk \nmanagement and disaster prevention, while giving assistance to those affected. \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n33 \n\nMACROECONOMIC IMPACT  \n\nFiscal Impact \n\nMacroeconomic Impact \n\n \nA.  \n \n1. \nThe tsunami, one of the worst humanitarian tragedies in the coastal history of southern \nIndia, has had only a localized economic impact. It has had little impact on the gross domestic \nproduct of India or the affected states, as economic activities along the coastline contribute little \nto  their  income.  Foreign  exchange  receipts  may  be  marginally  impacted  to  the  extent  that \nshrimp exports are affected along with coastal tourism.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nHowever,  the  impact  of  the  tsunami  on  states\u2019  finances  will  be  much  more  noticeable. \nThe impact will primarily be transmitted through the expenditure side\u2014both due to higher relief \nexpenditure in fiscal year (FY) 2004/05 as well as rehabilitation and reconstruction expenditure \nover  the  short-  and  medium-term.  States\u2019  revenues  are  not  impacted  because  the  affected \neconomic activities along the coastline were largely in the informal and unorganized sectors. To \nanalyze the impact of this additional expenditure on the finances of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, the \nstates\u2019  existing  medium-term  fiscal  plans  are  used  as  the  baseline  scenario.  In  contrast,  an \nalternative scenario is presented that reflects the likely impact on the short- and medium-term \nreconstruction  activities  to  be  spread  over  3  years  beginning  in  FY2005/06.  The  effect  of  the \ntsunami  can  be  estimated  as  the  difference  between  the  fiscal  deficit  to  gross  state  domestic \nproduct  (GSDP)  ratio  under  these  two  scenarios.  The  fiscal  costs  can  be  divided  into  two \ncategories:  (i)  direct  impact  due  to  additional  tsunami-related  expenditures;  and  (ii)  indirect \nimpact due to higher interest burden resulting from increases in debt stock caused by tsunami-\nrelated  expenditures.  Thus,  the  spiral  effect  of  debt-deficit  dynamics  through  higher  interest \nburden will spill over beyond the period in which the actual expenditures are incurred.  \n \n3. \nExpenditure.  Average  total  expenditure  as  a  percentage  of  GSDP  will  rise  by  0.7%  in \nTamil Nadu during FY2005/06 to FY2007/08 in the alternative scenario. This rise is more than \nthe  tsunami-related  additional  expenditure  because  of  the  debt-deficit  dynamics  explained  in \npara. 2. Similarly in Kerala, the expenditure to GSDP ratio will rise by 0.2% on average during \nthe same period.  \n \n4. \nFiscal Deficit. In the case of Tamil Nadu, the rehabilitation and reconstruction costs will \nlead  to  a  widening  of  the  deficit  during  FY2005/06  to  FY2007/08  by  more  than  the  tsunami-\nrelated  expenditure.  Thus,  total  fiscal  cost,  both  direct  and  indirect,  is  estimated  to  be  0.8%, \n0.6%, and 0.7% of GSDP in FY2005/06, 2006/07, and 2007/08 (Table A3.1). Although the full \ncost  of  rehabilitation  is  assumed  to  be  fully  met  by  FY2007/08  under  the  alternative  scenario, \nthe  ratio  of  fiscal  deficit  to  GSDP  continues  to  be  higher  than  the  baseline  scenario  beyond \nFY2007/08 reflecting the debt dynamics. Total fiscal cost is estimated to be 0.2% of GSDP on \nan annual basis during the same period in Kerala (Table A3.2). \n \n5. \nDebt Stock. The fiscal cost of the tsunami will lead to higher debt stock in Tamil Nadu \nand Kerala in the period of analysis. Thus, the debt to GSDP ratio in Tamil Nadu reaches 33.1% \nby  FY2007/08  as  against  31%  in  the  baseline.  Similarly,  in  Kerala,  the  debt  to  GSDP  ratio  at \n40.1%  in  FY2007/08  exceeds  the  corresponding  ratio  in  the  baseline  scenario  by  one  half \npercentage point of GSDP.  \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n34 \n\n \n\nTable A3.1: Fiscal Cost of the Tsunami for Tamil Nadu \n(% of gross state domestic product)  \n\n \n\nFY2003/04 \n\nFY2004/05 \n\nFY2005/06 \nBudget Estimate Projections\n\nFY2006/07 \nFY2007/08 \nProjections  Projections\n\n \n\n  \n\n13.7 \n14.1 \n3.0 \n2.0 \n16.1 \n0.1 \n2.5 \n31.0 \n\n13.7 \n14.5 \n3.0 \n1.8 \n16.3 \n0.2 \n2.8 \n31.2 \n\n13.7 \n15.4 \n2.9 \n1.9 \n17.3 \n0.1 \n3.8 \n30.1 \n\n13.7 \n15.2 \n3.0 \n1.7 \n16.8 \n0.1 \n3.3 \n31.0 \n\n13.6 \n15.7 \n2.8 \n1.4 \n17.1 \n0.1 \n3.7 \n28.5 \n \n13.6 \n15.7 \n2.8 \n1.4 \n \n17.1 \n0.1 \n3.7 \n28.5 \n\n Base Line (Status Quo) \nA.

Loss of lives; injuries; destruction of houses and productive \nassets;  and  damage  to  social,  physical,  and  transport  infrastructure  compounded  damage  to \nlivelihoods.  The  tsunami  hit  the  livelihoods  of  those  who  were  already  poor3  the  hardest  and \naccentuated their deep-seated vulnerability due to the socioeconomic structure of the affected \nareas,  land-holding  patterns,  ownership  of  economic  assets,  and  lack  of  skills  to  benefit  from \neconomic  opportunities.  Seasonal  income  patterns;  climatic  variations;  and  low  coverage  and \nquality of water, sanitation, health, and education worsened the adverse impact. \n  \nThe damage suffered by fisherfolks affected a broad range of microenterprises4 due to \n2. \nmarked \n(Table  A4.1).  The  vulnerability  of \nmicroenterprises  to  disruptions  in  sources  of  supplies  and  markets  led  to  loss  of employment, \nespecially for women. Microenterprises cater to local markets and the lower income segments \nof the population both for inputs and outputs. The damage to agriculture and livestock, though \nnot  significant,  has  also  affected  the  livelihoods  of  vulnerable  coastal  communities,  including \nscheduled  castes,  scheduled  tribes,  and  women.  In  addition,  salinity  of  land  and  groundwater \nwill have long-term impacts on productivity and profitability of microenterprises especially those \nrelating to agriculture and horticulture. Landless and other casual laborers engaged in seasonal \nemployment and other intermittent activities for subsistence have suffered loss of employment \nopportunities and consequently wages.  \n\nin  coastal  economies \n\ninterdependency \n\n \nTable A4.1: Estimated Breakup of Affected Livelihoods, Damages, and Wage Losses \n \nKerala \n\nLivelihoods \n\n \nItem \nI.

Considering  the  lessons \nlearned  in  emergency  rehabilitation  interventions,  the  strategy  for  restoration  of  livelihoods7 \ninclude (i) priority for the poor and low-income families because of their inability to regain their \nlivelihoods without targeted interventions; (ii) empowering the poor by  enabling them to reflect \ntheir priorities through group-based mechanisms, primarily self-help groups (SHGs), which are \nwell  represented  in  the  affected  areas;  (iii)  building  and  strengthening  SHGs  for  sustained \nimpact,  cost-effective  service  delivery,  and  adequate  gender  representation;  and  (iv)  special \ninterventions for vulnerable groups that cannot immediately engage in economic activities.  \n \nPooling  of  development  efforts  of  the  government,  private  sector,  and  nongovernment \n4. \norganizations (NGOs) will be required to restore and develop livelihoods. In addition, the active \nparticipation  of  affected  people  (including  scheduled  castes  and  scheduled  tribes)  to  ensure \neffective utilization of funds, timely delivery, effective targeting, and transparency are essential. \nExpeditious  service  delivery,  outreach,  and  continuity  will  be  essential  for  convergence  with \nongoing  initiatives  with  established  implementation  mechanisms.  Both  Tamil  Nadu,  with  the \nmost  damage,  and  Kerala8  are  promoting  social  and  economic  empowerment  of  the  poor  and \nlow-income  households  through  organization  of  SHGs  and  supporting  them  through  revolving \nfunds, part financing of group or individual economic enterprises, linkages to institutional credit, \nskills  development,  and  insurance.9  While  Tamil  Nadu  and  Kerala  are  in  the  forefront  of  the \nSHG  movement  in  India,  the  coverage  of  coastal  communities  and  microenterprises \ndevelopment through SHGs remains limited.10  \n \nC.  \n \n5. \nThe  magnitude  of  the  poverty  impact  of  damaged  livelihoods  requires  a  substantial \nresponse  to  restore  income  flows,  reduce  dependence  on  relief,  and  revive  local  economies. \nAccordingly,  in  consultation  with  state  governments  this  component11  includes  (i)  restoring \nlivelihoods  of  the  affected  poor  and  low-income  households  already  organized  into  SHGs  and \nother  similar  groups  recognized  by  state  governments  as  affected  by  the  tsunami  through \nmicroenterprise  training  and  establishment  support;  (ii)  formation  of  new  SHGs,  for  both  men \nand  women,  from  affected  households  not  yet  organized  in  community-based  groups  for \nrestoring \n(iii) \nreplacement of productive assets (i.e., excluding housing) of tsunami-affected households; (iv) \nskills  upgrading;12  (v)  risk  mitigation  through  insurance  of  all  affected  households  that  receive \nassistance  under  this  component,  through  available  life  and  property  insurance  schemes;  (vi) \n\ntraining  and  establishment  support; \n\nScope and Components  \n\nthrough  microenterprise \n\nlivelihoods \n\n                                                 \n6  State governments identified 23 microenterprises other than fisherfolk affected by tsunami.  \n7  Restoring  livelihoods  covers  support  for  economic  enterprises,  upgrading  skills  and  technology,  and  community-\n\nbased microinfrastructure to enable the poor to actively engage in economic activities. \n\n8  Mahalir Thittam (Tamil Nadu) with 80,000 and Kudumbashree (Kerala) with 150,000 SHGs are flagship programs.  \n9  Implementation of this framework is financed under the Swarnajayanthi Grama Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY) in the \nratio of 75:25 by the state governments and Government of India. In addition to back-ended subsidies, linkages are \nestablished  with  financing  institutions.  Generally,  the  rural  development  departments  implement  SGSY.  So  far \n24,000 SHGs in Tamil Nadu and 15,000 SHGs in Kerala are under various stages of support under SGSY.  \n\n10 Only 7,500 SHGs in Tamil Nadu and approximately 1,500 in Kerala are in coastal communities. \n11 The  scope  excludes  fisheries  and  agriculture  sectors,  including  associated  asset  replacement  expected  to  be \nfunded  from  other  sources.  However,  livelihood  restoration  relating  to  these  segments  (SHG  formation,  skills \ndevelopment, and microenterprise development support) are part of the scope in view of the inextricable linkages \nin local economies and the need for coordinated implementation for cost-efficient service delivery.  \n\n12 Skills  development  intervention  is  kept  generic  to  ensure  participation  of  SHGs,  and  other  affected  community \n\ngroups and individuals. The scope includes fisheries and allied activities of poor and low income households. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n37 \n\nrestoring community-based infrastructure affected by the tsunami; and (vii) technical support for \nimplementation, monitoring, and impact assessment of this component.  \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n \n\n6. \nThe  total  cost  of  this  component  is  $60.16  million  equivalent.  Of  the  total  cost,  $51.15 \nmillion  equivalent  is  for  Tamil  Nadu  and  $9.02  million  equivalent  is  for  Kerala.  The  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  will  finance  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $0.19  million \nequivalent  and  $58.84 million  equivalent  of  local  currency  cost  or  about  98%  of  the  total  cost. \nThe Government will finance the remaining local currency cost of $1.32 million equivalent, which \nincludes taxes and duties. Cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 9. \n  \nE. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements  \n\n1. \n\nProject Management  \n\n \nThe  Revenue  Administration,  Disaster  Management  and  Mitigation  Department \n7. \n(RADMMD) in Tamil Nadu and the Department of Disaster Management (DDM) in Kerala will be \nthe  executing  agencies  (EAs).  The  EAs  will  establish  project  management  units  (PMUs)  with \nrepresentation of line agencies. The PMUs will work closely with the ADB extended missions to \nfacilitate implementation and exercise monitoring and control.  \n \n8.   Within  this  framework,  the  Rural  Development  Department  in  Tamil  Nadu  and  Kerala \nFisheries Department13 will be implementing agencies (IAs). For state coordination, both IAs will \nbe represented in the PMUs. Project implementation units (PIUs) will be established within the \nRural  Development  Department  and  Kerala  Fisheries  Department.  Project  implementation  will \nbe  undertaken  by \nlocal  bodies, \ncommunities,  and  NGOs  similar  to  the  Swarnajayanthi  Grama  Swarozgar  Yojana  framework \nwith  adaptations  required  for  expediting  outreach  without  compromising  core  principles.  Key \nactivities  will  be  outsourced  to  specialized  agencies  such  as  Kudumbashree  in  Kerala,  Tamil \nNadu  Corporation  for  Women  Development  Limited,  Enterprise  Development  Institute  in \nAhmedabad,  and  other  accredited  training  establishments  and  NGO  service  providers. \nSuccessful  SHGs  will  be  encouraged  as  service  providers  to  mainstream  good  governance  in \ncommunity-based development interventions. \n \n\nfunctionaries  with  emphasis  on  participation  of \n\nfield \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule  \n\n \n9. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  3  years,  commencing  in  the  second  quarter  of \n2005. The concerned state governments will establish the PMUs and PIUs. The following start-\nup activities will be completed within the first 3 months (i) service provider eligibility criteria and \n(ii) processing of retroactive financing, if any.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement  \n\n \n10. \nProcurement. \n\nProcurement,  wherever  required  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB  Guidelines  for \n\n                                                 \n13The Government of Kerala prefers livelihood restoration to be implemented by the Fisheries Department to realize \nthe unexplored synergies between fisheries and other livelihood sources. Implementation in close coordination with \nKudambashree (responsible for SGSY implementation) will ensure realization of the project objective. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n38 \n \n\n \n4. \n\n \n5. \n\nConsulting Services  \n\n \n11. \nDomestic  consultants  (community  microenterprise  development  specialists)  will  be \nrequired in Kerala and in Tamil Nadu to provide technical support to equip the line departments \nto restore livelihoods in the aftermath of the disaster, mainstream best practices in community-\nbased  microenterprise  development,  emphasize  outreach  to  women  and  other  vulnerable \ngroups, pool the development efforts of stakeholders, monitor progress, and measure impact.  \n\nMonitoring  \n\nBenefits and Risks  \n\n \n12. \nThe  PIUs  will  maintain  a  project  performance  monitoring  system  that  will  generate \nsemiannual  and  annual  reports.  The  information  system  will  include  (i) the  number  of  SHGs \nformed and assisted, including membership by poverty classification, vulnerability, and gender; \n(ii)  capacity  and  skills  training  imparted;  (iii) the  number  of  enterprises  supported  and  their \nfinancial  and  efficiency  ratios;  (iv)  repayment  performance;  (v) asset  replacement  and  risk \nmitigation; and (vi) quantitative and qualitative progress of community-based microinfrastructure \nprojects.14  Specific  monitoring  indicators  will  be  applied  to  monitor  whether  the  affected \nscheduled castes and scheduled tribe community members receive the above assistance. The \nIAs will periodically commission independent impact  assessment to measure poverty outreach \nand poverty reduction through changes in income, asset holding, and employment status. The \nIAs will maintain proper records and identification of SHGs and individual beneficiaries receiving \nassistance  including cash  assistance  under  the  Project.  Likewise  proper  accounts  and  reports \nwill be maintained by the IAs and provided periodically to the EAs.  \n \nF. \n \n13. \nThe  Project  represents  a  focused  approach  to  restoring  livelihoods  of  affected \nhouseholds through extension of ongoing interventions with appropriate adaptations for income \nexpansion, employment generation, and poverty  reduction. The Project is expected to support \n12,000  SHGs  with  nearly  130,000  members  including  their  capacity  building  and  skills \ndevelopment. At least 50% of those assisted will be women and at least 3% will be from among \nthe  disabled.  About  130,00015  livelihoods  will  either  be  restored  or  started.  In  total,  350,000 \nlivelihoods  are  likely  to  receive  asset  replacement  and  risk  reduction  support.  Simultaneous \ninterventions  especially  for  infrastructure  restoration  through  National  Calamity  Contingency \nFund,  state  governments,  private  sector,  and  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies  will  facilitate \nforward  and  backward  linkages,  which  will  help  enhance  the  rate  of  return  on  investments  in \nmicroenterprises.  \n \n14.  Major  risks  relate  to  ambitious  targets  inducing  compromise  on  core  principles  of \nsustainability and community participation. This has been mitigated by setting goals that can be \nrealistically  achieved  within  the  context  of  a  limited  duration  Project.16  In  addition,  due  caution \nwill be taken in selecting and promoting enterprises. The covariance risk of establishing a large \nnumber  of  similar  microenterprises  in  limited  geographic  areas  has  been  reduced  through  a \ndemand-driven  approach  where  communities  realistically  assess  their  skill  and  abilities.  A \ncommunity-based approach will enhance effective targeting.  \n \n\n                                                 \n14 Operation and maintenance costs will be borne by local bodies. \n15 Assuming group-based economic enterprises. \n16 The size of this component factors implementation capacity and the time required to achieve expected outputs.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n39 \n\nROADS AND BRIDGES \n\nkm \n\nthe \n\nand \n\nWorks \n\n115,204 \n\nremaining \n\nDepartment \n\nIntroduction \n\nDamage and Impact of the Tsunami  \n\n \nA. \n \nTamil  Nadu  has  a  well-developed  transport  system  comprising  land,  sea,  and  air \n1. \ntransport  modes.  Road  transport  accounts  for  about  80%  of  freight  and  passenger  trips  and \ncatalyses  interstate  and  intrastate  trade.  The  total  road  length  in  Tamil  Nadu  is  151,137 \nkilometers  (km)  comprising  60,628  km  of  primary  road  network  managed  by  the  Highways \nDepartment,  and  the  remaining  90,509  km  of  Panchayat/Union/Municipal/Forest/other  roads \nmanaged  by  local  bodies  and  other  agencies.  The  primary  road  network  in  the  state  includes \n3,865  km  of  national  highways,  7,136  km  of  state  highways,  7,408  km  of  major  district  roads, \nand 42,219 km of other district roads.  \n \n2. \nKerala\u2014one  of  the  smaller  states  in  terms  of  area\u2014is  ranked  fourth  in  the  country  in \ninfrastructure penetration, a parameter based on transport, communication, and energy-related \nvariables.  The  transport  system  of  Kerala  comprises  a  hierarchy  of  roads,  railways,  domestic \nand  international  airlines,  inland  waterways,  and  coastal  and  international  shipping.  The  total \nroad  length  is  138,196  km  comprising  22,991  km  of  primary  road  network  managed  by  the \nPublic \nof \nPanchayat/Municipal/Forest/Irrigation/other roads managed by local bodies and other agencies. \nThe primary road network includes 1,523 km of national highways, 3,785 km of state highways, \n11,711 km of major district roads, 5,315 km of other district roads, and 655 km of other roads. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nIn  Tamil  Nadu,  the  impact  of  tsunami  on  roads  and  bridges  extended  to  12  affected \ncoastal districts, with particular severity in Cuddalore, Kannyakumari, and Nagapattinam,. While \nsome lengths of a national highway (NH45A) suffered minor damage, the state road network in \nthe coastal districts was affected the most. \n \n4. \nIn  Kerala,  the  impact  of  the  tsunami  on  roads  and  bridges  extended  mainly  to  three \ncoastal districts, Alappuzha, Ernakulam, and Kollam, out of the districts affected by the tsunami. \nWhile  no  national  highways  or  state  highways  were  damaged,  major  district  roads  and  other \ndistrict roads, including structures were damaged in the coastal belt between the seacoast and \nthe  backwaters  (Travancore-Shornur  Canal).  In  the  districts  of  Alappuzha,  Ernakulam,  and \nKollam,  the  narrow  major  district  roads  running  along  the  sea  at  an  average  distance  of \napproximately 50 meters from the seacoast suffered severe damage, including to minor bridges \nand culverts. \n \n5. \nThe  tsunami  left  some  bridges  totally  damaged;  roads  severely  breached;  berms, \nshoulders  and  protection  works  eroded;  and  the  road  structure  exposed.  Pavements  were \nwashed  away  and  cross-drainage  structures  damaged.  The  impact  of  the  tsunami  waves  was \nso severe that some bridge structures were damaged due to boats hitting the substructures and \ndecks.  Many  lives  were  lost  due  to  lack  of  bridges  connecting  the  mainland  across  the \nbackwaters/rivers.  The  Joint  Assessment  Mission\u2019s  report  estimated  reconstruction  needs  for \nroad and bridges at $15 million in Tamil Nadu and $10.5 million in Kerala.  \n \nC. \n \n6. \nThe  Highways  Department  of  Tamil  Nadu  and  Public  Works  Department  of  Kerala \nimmediately mobilized their resources and reestablished connectivity by carrying out temporary \n\nGovernment Response to the Tsunami \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n40 \n \n\nScope  \n\nSubproject Selection Criteria \n\nrehabilitation works on road links critical for relief operations.

Major  ports  of  Chennai,  Ennore,  Tuticorin  in  Tamil  Nadu,  and \nCochin in Kerala handle 21% of the total throughput of all major ports. Major ports are managed \nby port trusts under the regulation of the Tariff Authority for Major Ports. Minor ports handle the \nremaining one fourth of total traffic, and are under state government control. Tamil Nadu has 15 \nminor  ports  handling  800,000  tons  of  cargo  and  Kerala  has  17  minor  ports  handling  400,000 \ntons. \n \nApart from four main fishing harbors\u2014Chennai (Tamil Nadu), Kochi (Kerala), Roychowk \n2. \nin  Calcutta  (West  Bengal),  and  Vishakhapatnam  (Andhra  Pradesh)\u2014other  fishing  harbors \n(hereafter  referred  to  as  harbors)  and  fish-landing  centers  are  designated  in  each  state  to \nprovide landing and berthing facilities to fishing crafts in the nation. Tamil Nadu has 7 harbors \nand 17 landing centers and jetties, and Kerala has 13 harbors and 25 landing centers. Of the \nnational total of fish landings, Tamil Nadu accounts for about 15% and Kerala for 26%. \n \nB. \n \nDamage  to  major  ports  by  the  tsunami  was  relatively  minor  due  to  their  geographic \n3. \nlocations and breakwaters. However, the two minor ports in Tamil Nadu and the four minor ports \nin Kerala have been damaged. Six harbors in Tamil Nadu and eight harbors in Kerala as well as \nlanding centers in the states were also affected. More than 8,000 m length of harbor/seawalls \nand  breakwaters  are  reported  to  have  been  damaged  or  destroyed.  About  1,600,000  cubic \nmeters (m3) of dredging will be required to remove tsunami-inflicted siltation from harbor basins \nand  approach  channels  in  20  ports,  harbors,  and  landing  centers.  Based  on  the  Joint \nAssessment Mission Report and discussions with the relevant line departments of the states the \ncost  of  reconstructing  ports  and  harbors  is  estimated  at  $21  million  for  Tamil  Nadu  and  $13 \nmillion for Kerala. \n \n4. \nIn  Tamil  Nadu,  Nagapattinam  Port  located  along  Kaduvaiyar  River,  was  severely \ndamaged by the tsunami. The port had been handling around 80,000 tons a year for importing \noil and exporting cement. The fishing harbor located on the river upstream of the port, with fish \nlanding of 30,000 tons, was also badly damaged. The two breakwaters at the mouth of the river \nwere destroyed and one barge carried by the tsunami collided with the coastal protection groyn \nbetween the sea and river. This led to sand drifting from the sea to the channel and basins, as \nwell as reduction of the calmness of the channel and basins. The tsunami waves came over the \nseawall  of  the  fishing  harbor  area  destroying  parts  of  wharfs,  the  fish  market,  and  the  auction \ncenter.  Tsunami  waves  also  destroyed  fishing  boats  and  a  dredger,  and  left  them  along  the \nchannel  and  on  the  wharfs  of  the  port.  As  a  result  of  the  shallow  channel  and  basins,  and \nbroken  facilities,  the  port  has  suspended  operation  for  more  than  2  months.  The  channel, \ncommonly servicing the fishing harbor on the river upstream, has also prevented fishing boats \nfrom  plying  to  and  from  the  fishing  harbor.  Similarly,  in  Cuddalore  Port,  located  at  the \nconfluence  of  the  Gadilam  and  Paravanar  rivers,  the  breakwaters  and  equipment  were \ndamaged, and drafts of the basin and the channel have been reduced. Furthermore, six harbors \nand five landing centers were seriously affected and need urgent dredging and rehabilitation of \njetties, retaining walls, auction centers, and facilities.  \n \n5. \nIn Kerala, sand drift caused by the tsunami led to serious reduction of the draft in four \nminor  ports  (Azhikkal,  Beypore,  Neendakara,  and  Vizhinjam)  and  eight  harbors  and  landing \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n43  \n\nScope \n\ncenters.  The  waves  also  damaged  some  breakwaters,  compound  walls,  approach  roads,  and \nother  facilities.  As  a  result,  some  maritime  cargo  is  being  transshipped  offshore  between \nvessels and small barges that can ply the shallow channels and basins. Other maritime cargo is \nnow  being  transported  by  trucks  at  higher  cost.  In  Beypore  port,  the  ferry  service  to  islands, \ncarrying  25,000  passengers  a  year,  has  been  diverted  to  Cochin  port  after  the  tsunami. \nSubstantial numbers of the labor force are reported to be unemployed as a result of limited or \nsuspended port operation. Due to the siltation of harbors and landing centers, fishing boats can \noperate only during high tides, resulting in substantial losses in fisheries production. \n \n6. \nBoth states are concerned that coastal disasters including tsunami, cyclones, and storm \nsurges can cause ocean pollution due to oil and sewerage spill from vessels and fishing boats. \nTo  mitigate  pollution  risk  in  the  event  of  coastal  disasters,  ports  and  harbors  need  reception \nfacilities for oil and sewerage wastes. \n \nC. \n \nTo  address  the  immediate  need  to  rehabilitate  breakwaters  and  carry  out  dredging  to \n7. \nallow port and fishing operations to be resumed as soon as possible, this project component for \nstate-owned  ports  and  harbors  comprises  (i)  priority  dredging  for  ports,  harbor  basins,  and \napproach channels; (ii) rehabilitation of breakwaters for ports and harbors; (iii) rehabilitation of \nfishing  harbor  facilities  like  compound/harbor  walls;  (iv)  rehabilitation  of  damaged  roads  and \nports facilities like electrification systems, wharfs, and piers; and (v) procurement of equipment \nsuch as a destroyed dredger and navigational aids. Rehabilitation works to restore the facilities \nto the pre-tsunami level, where appropriate, will include upgrading designs to mitigate damage \nfrom  future  natural  disasters,  including  tsunami  and  cyclones.  This  component  excludes \nrehabilitation works sanctioned by the Government\u2019s National Calamity Contingency Fund.  \n \nD. \n \nSubprojects will meet the general criteria for the Project as outlined in Appendix 11. In \n8. \naddition,  subprojects  will  also  meet  the  following  criteria:  (i)  provide  emergency  or  short-term \nreestablishment of port and fisheries operation; (ii) contribute significantly to disaster mitigation, \nincluding  pollution  abatement;  and  (iii)  contribute  significantly  to  enhancing  safety  in  maritime \ntransport and fishing. \n \nE. \n \nThe  total  cost  of  this  component  is  $27.65  million  equivalent.  Of  the  total  cost,  $18.90 \n9. \nmillion  equivalent  is  for  Tamil  Nadu  and  $8.75  million  equivalent  is  for  Kerala.  The  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  will  finance  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $4.08  million  and \n$21.82 million equivalent of local currency cost or about 94% of the total cost. The Government \nwill finance the remaining local currency cost of $1.75 million equivalent, which includes taxes \nand duties. Cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 9. \n \nF. \n \n \n \n10. \nThe  Revenue  Administration,  Disaster  Management  and  Mitigation  Department \n(RADMMD) in Tamil Nadu and the Department of Disaster Management (DDM) in Kerala will be \nthe  executing  agencies  (EAs).  The  EAs  will  establish  project  management  units  (PMUs)  with \nrepresentation of line agencies. The PMUs will work closely with the ADB extended missions to \nfacilitate implementation and exercise monitoring and control.  \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nSubproject Selection Criteria \n\nInstitutional Arrangements \n\n1. \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n \n11. \nThe  Maritime  Board  and  Department  of  Fisheries  will  be  the  implementing  agencies \n(IAs)  for  the  ports  and  harbors  components  respectively  in  Tamil  Nadu.  Ports/Harbor \nEngineering Departments will be the IA for ports and fishing harbor components in Kerala. For \nstate level coordination, the IAs will be represented in the PMUs. Project implementation units \n(PIUs)  will  be  established  within  the  IAs.  The  PIUs  will  be  responsible  for  the  selection  and \npreparation  of  the  subprojects,  and  will  carry  out  the  due  diligence  to  ensure  compliance  with \nthe  subproject  selection  criteria  indicated  in  Appendix  11  and  ADB  social,  environmental,  and \nresettlement safeguard policies (Appendixes 13, 14, 15, and 16). \n \n\n2. \n\nProcurement  \n\n4. \n\n3. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\nCivil works contracts and procurement of goods and services will follow local competitive \n\n \n12. \nbidding procedures in accordance with ADB Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n \n \nThe works under this component will be completed by 30 April 2008. Within the overall \n13. \nproject duration of 36 months, the duration of construction for any subproject will not exceed 24 \nmonths. The overall implementation schedule is given in Appendix 12. \n \n \n \n14. \nConsultant  services  will  be  provided  to  assist  the  IAs  to  (i)  review  assessments  with \nverification  of  damages  and  cost  estimates  based  on  unit  costs;  (ii)  prepare  a  detailed  time-\nbound  reconstruction  work  program;  (iii)  provide  engineering  assistance,  including  survey  and \ndesign;  (iv)  manage  procurement,  including  preparation  of  tender  documents,  evaluation,  and \naward  of  bids;  (v)  assist  the  IAs  to  prepare  environmental  management  plan  and  supervise \nenvironmental management; and (vi) report progress of the project and performance monitoring \nto  and  coordinate  with  the  PMU.  The  project  performance  indicators  include  bathymetric \nsurveys, cargo throughputs, number of passengers, and volume of fish landing. \n \nG. \n \n15. \nThis component will restore port and harbor operations directly benefiting port users and \nfisherfolk. In addition to shipping companies and ferry operators, ferry passengers who have to \ntake a diverted route will also benefit. Dredging to secure required drafts will enhance maritime \nsafety in ports and harbors.  \n \n16.  Major risks relating to the component are environmental management and maintenance \nof rehabilitated infrastructure. Of critical importance, the environmental experts, to be recruited \nfor the PMUs, must prepare environmental management plans for dredging and supervise the \nimplementation. The risk of inadequate maintenance, particularly in dredging, can be mitigated \nby  regular  bathymetric  surveys  and  careful  layout  planning  of  ports  and  harbors  based  on \nhydraulic research. \n\nBenefits and Risks \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n45 \n\nWATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION \n \n\nDamage and Impact \n\nA. \n \nOver  90%  of  tsunami-affected  areas  of  Tamil  Nadu  and  60%  of  Kerala  have  been \n1. \ncovered by piped water supply systems. However, water quantity and quality for most systems \nin  both  states  are  grossly  insufficient,  with  less  than  half  getting  40  liters  per  day  per  capita \n(lpcd), an interim standard adopted by Tamil Nadu (as opposed to the national standard of 70 \nlpcd for rural areas and 135 lpcd for urban areas). Many schemes also suffer from high content \nof  fluorides,  sodium,  and  iron,  with  shallow  wells  facing  high  levels  of  salinity  in  dry  seasons. \nCoverage of sanitation is lagging, with Tamil Nadu having only 15% coverage in coastal villages \nand  slightly  over  50%  in  urban  areas.  Kerala  has  had  over  50%  coverage  on  average.  These \nunsatisfactory conditions have led to poor health and morbidity, exacerbating the poverty in the \naffected areas.  \n \n2. \nThe  tsunami-damaged  water  supply  and  sanitation  systems  along  the  coastline  have \nresulted  in  salinization  of  wells,  and  destruction  of  distribution  pipes,  public  stand  posts,  and \nindividual  hand  pumps  needed  to  supplement  the  meager  piped  water  supply.  In  Tamil  Nadu \n329,000  people  in  six  municipalities  and  74  village  panchayat  are  directly  affected,  and  in \nKerala, 192,000 in one municipality and 27 village panchayats. Large number of household pit \nlatrines,  septic  tanks,  and  public  toilets  were  also  damaged.  The  Joint  Assessment  Mission\u2019s \npreliminary estimate for immediate and medium-term reconstruction needs for Tamil Nadu and \nKerala  totaled  $38  million,  which  was  further  detailed  by  the  mission  at  $20  million  for  Tamil \nNadu and $15 million for Kerala. The reconstruction needs incorporate costs for rebuilding up to \na standard that responds to local requirements, including the risk of natural disaster, on top of \nthe same-standard replacement costs.  \n \n3. \nTaking into account the lessons of the emergency rehabilitation interventions and local \nconsultations  by  the  Joint  Assessment  Mission  and  the  Mission,  the  sector  recovery  strategy \nemphasizes  (i)  transparent  decision  making  and  community  participation,  including  through \nconsultation  with  local  government  institutions;  (ii)  upgrading  systems  as  appropriate  in  lieu  of \nrehabilitating existing poorly performing systems with due options consideration; (iii) producing \nan  awareness  campaign  in  coastal  communities  on  water  conservation,  water  quality, \nsanitation,  and  hygiene  issues;  (iv)  forging  good  working  relationships  with  concerned \ndepartments and capable nongovernment organizations (NGOs); (v) ensuring quality of works in \nterms  of  process  and  products  by  setting  out  and  monitoring  measurable  indicators;  and  (vi) \nstrengthening  sustainable  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  capacity  of  the  concerned \ncommunities.  \n \nB. \n \n4. \nThis  component  will  rehabilitate/upgrade  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  infrastructure \nand provide related services for tsunami-affected communities in 9 districts of Tamil Nadu and 4 \nof Kerala. Rehabilitation works will be carried out to restore facilities to pre-tsunami level or to a \nhigher  cost-effective  standard.  The  Project  will  include  (i)  restoring  and  upgrading  damaged \nexisting water supply systems including providing tankers; (ii) upgrading affected water supply \nsystems \n(iii) \nrehabilitating/upgrading sanitary complex and solid waste management facilities; (iv) providing a \n\ninto  multivillage  systems  with  more \n\nreliable  source  development; \n\nScope \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n46 \n \n\nSubproject Selection Criteria \n\nsanitation  and  environmental  awareness  campaign;1  and  (v)  undertaking  technical  support  for \ndamage  assessment  surveys,  aquifer  and  hydrology  study,  disaster  resistant  design, \nconstruction quality control, and community participation. \n \nBy providing improved drinking water supplies in terms of quantity and quality at least to \n5. \nthe  level  of  or  beyond  the  pre-tsunami  conditions,  the  Project  will  contribute  to  reducing  time \nand  resources  for  providing  or  collecting  water  and  for  maintaining  existing  poorly  performing \nsystems.  This,  along  with  appropriate  sanitation  and  solid  waster  management  practices \npromoted  under  the  Project,  will  also  contribute  to  protecting  public  health  from  potential \nwaterborne  diseases,  and  reducing  pressure  on  the  fragile  coastal  aquifer  and  natural \nenvironment.  The  Project\u2019s  institutional  support  will  lead  to  improved  practices  in  community \nparticipation  in  project  planning  and  implementation,  and  sound  technical  design  and  quality \ncontrol,  along  with  increased  involvement  of  local  government  institutions  and  beneficiaries  in \nO&M of completed schemes.  \n \nC. \n \n6. \nSubprojects  to  be  selected  will  meet  the  general  criteria  outlined  in  Appendix  11. \nRehabilitation/upgrading of water supply systems will be packaged into individual subprojects in \ncombination with the supporting activities, including sanitation and solid waste management as \nappropriate,  and  selected  and  implemented  following  the  specific  criteria  and  format  jointly \nprepared  by  the  consultants  and  the  Government  and  agreeable  to  the  Asian  Development \nBank  (ADB).  These  will  include  (i)  consultation  with  the  affected  communities,  including \nvulnerable  groups,  through  local  government  institutions;  (ii)  confirmation  on  the  aquifer  and \nriver  water  availability  and  sustainability  for  schemes  seeking  new  sources;  (iii) contribution  to \nimproving  environmental  conditions;  and  (iv)  confirmation  of  O&M  sustainability  through \npreparation of O&M plans with clear stipulation of responsibilities and resource requirements of \nthe concerned parties with their confirmed affordability.  \n \nD. \n \n7. \nThe  total  cost  of  this  component  is  $38.11  million  equivalent.  Of  the  total  cost,  $24.38 \nmillion equivalent is for Tamil Nadu and $13.73 million equivalent is for Kerala. ADB will finance \nthe  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $11.23  million  and  $24.77  million  equivalent  of  the  local \ncurrency cost or about 95% of the total cost. The Government will finance the remaining local \ncurrency cost of $2.11 million equivalent, which includes taxes and duties. Cost estimates and \nthe financing plan are in Appendix 9. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nE. \n \n \n \n8. \nThe  Revenue  Administration,  Disaster  Management  and  Mitigation  Department \n(RADMMD) in Tamil Nadu and the Department of Disaster Management (DDM) in Kerala will be \nthe  executing  agencies  (EAs).The  EAs  will  establish  project  management  units  (PMUs)  with \nrepresentation of line agencies.

The  Tamil  Nadu  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Board  and  the  concerned \nmunicipality  will  be  responsible  for  water  supply.  Sanitation  is  implemented  by  the  Rural \nDevelopment  Department  and  the  concerned  municipalities  in  Tamil  Nadu,  and  by  the  Kerala \nWater Authority and the concerned panchayat in Kerala. For state level coordination, the IAs will \nbe represented in the PMUs. Project implementation units (PIUs) will be established within the \nIAs. Day-to-day subproject implementation will be undertaken by the concerned district offices of \nthe IAs. The PIUs will be responsible for selecting and preparing the subprojects, and will carry \nout  the  due  diligence  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  subproject  selection  criteria  indicated  in \nAppendix  11  and  ADB  social,  environmental,  and  resettlement  safeguard  policies  (Appendixes \n13, 14, 15, and 16). \n \n \n \n10. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  3  years,  commencing  in  the  second  quarter  of \n2005. The concerned state governments will establish the PMUs and assign relevant staff to the \nPMUs  and  PIUs  within  1  month  of  project  approval.  The  start-up  activities  will  be  completed \nwithin 6 months of loan effectiveness, including (i) recruitment of consultants; (ii) finalization of \nsubproject assessment, prioritization, and selection criteria; (iii) selection of subprojects; and (iv) \nprocurement of immediately required works including processing for retroactive financing, if any.  \n \n \n \n11. \nbidding procedures in accordance with ADB Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n \n \n12. \nDomestic consulting services are needed, as required, to implement the subcomponent \nand include water supply specialist, sanitation specialist, environmental specialist, resettlement \nspecialist,  construction  manager,  and  field  engineers,  for  (i)  overseeing  subproject  proposal \npreparation;  (ii)  advising  on  technical  studies,  disaster  resistant  design,  and  sanitation \ncampaigns;  (iii)  providing  monitoring  and  quality  control;  (iv)  fostering  public  participation;  and \n(v) assisting with reports and other ADB requirements including safeguards.  \n \n \n \n13. \nFor effective management of subproject planning, implementation monitoring and quality \ncontrol, each subproject, in particular for upgraded water supply systems, will have a subproject \nimplementation plan that sets out distinct processes and outputs, including impact indicators, in \ntheir  subproject  plan.  Those  indicators  will  be  monitored  through  a  project  performance \nmonitoring system for the Project, comprising the systems of effective recording and reporting in \nthe  field,  and  monitoring  and  auditing  at  the  IA  and  PMU  level  with  the  assistance  of  PMU \nconsultants.  Beneficiaries  will  also  be  involved  in  project  monitoring  and  evaluation,  through \ndirect reporting to civil society representative of the district committee and PMU.  \n \n \n \n14. \nFor  O&M,  the  Tamil  Nadu  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Board  is  responsible  for \nmultivillage  water  supply  schemes,  whereas  the  concerned  panchayat  and  municipalities  are \n\nSustainable Operation and Maintenance  \n\nMonitoring and Quality Control \n\nConsulting Services \n\n4. \n\n6. \n\n5. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n48 \n \n\nto \n\ntransfer \n\nincluding  management \n\nresponsible for O&M of single village and municipality schemes in Tamil Nadu. The Government \nhas  progressively  adopted  effective  reforms \nlocal \ngovernments, tariff revision every 3 years, and downsizing of the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and \nDrainage Board, with provision of necessary budget for maintenance.  \n \n15. \nIn  Kerala,  the  Kerala  Water  Authority  is  responsible  for  O&M  of  multivillage  and  single \nvillage  schemes  supported  under  the  Project.  These  are  all  relatively  large  systems  with \nbeneficiary  population  of  more  than  3,500.  While  the  Kerala  Water  Authority  currently  has  a \nrevenue  deficit  of  about  $25  million,  it  has  initiated  reforms  with  external  financing  support, \nincluding  upward  revision  of  water  tariffs,  transfer  of  smaller  schemes  to  panchayats, \ncomputerization  of  water  billing  and  revenue  collection  for  urban  schemes,  and  institutional \nrestructuring.2 ADB is also supporting this process through an ongoing technical assistance and \na  proposed  Sustainable  Urban  Development  Project  for  Kerala,  which  will  strengthen  the \nfinancial and administrative management of the Kerala Water Authority. \n  \n16. \nFor  the  purpose  of  sustainable  O&M  of  rehabilitated/upgraded  systems  under  the \nProject,  a  subproject-specific  O&M  plan  will  be  developed  that  set  outs  the  annual  O&M \narrangements and institutional responsibilities including financial requirements. The O&M plans \nwill be presented and confirmed with the concerned local governments and beneficiaries when \nfinalizing the implementation plan.  \n \n\n                                                 \n2  As a result, revenue collection has increased by over 40% since 1999. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n49 \n \n\nOTHER RURAL AND MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE \n \n\nthrough \n\nDamage and Impact \n\nA. \n \nTamil  Nadu  ranks  the  third  in  the  human  development  index  for  India,  with  a  poverty \n1. \nindex of 21%; Kerala with a poverty index of 13%, ranks first; the national average was 26% in \n1999/2000. However, poverty incidence in tsunami-affected coastal communities is significantly \nhigher  than  the  state  average  figures,  reaching  over  70%  in  both  states  in  some  backward \nhabitations.  The  majority  of  the  coastal  communities  continue  to  earn  their  income  in  largely \ntraditional  sectors  of  fishing  and  farming,  while  the  poor  survive  primarily  through  a  variety  of \ninformal subsistence activities and wage labor. The state governments have placed high priority \non  promoting  rural  development \nthe  creation  of  self-  and  wage-employment \nopportunities  with  provision  of  community  infrastructure,  enterprise  development  support,  and \ntraining.  The  tsunami  hit  these  critical  means  of  production  and  transportation  of  goods  and \nservices  along  the  coastline  thereby  significantly  affecting  the  livelihoods  of  the  vulnerable \ncoastal communities. \n \n2. \nThe  tsunami  waves  coming  ashore  at  high  speed  and  returning  to  the  sea  caused \ndisruption  of  rural  and  municipal  infrastructure,  including  severe  erosion  of  roads,  siltation  of \ndrainage  channels,  destruction  of  buildings,  and  damage  to  electrical  distribution  systems. \nSome  775  kilometers  (km)  of  panchayat  union,  panchayat,  and  municipal  roads  were  fully  or \npartially  damaged  in  Tamil  Nadu  and  70  km  in  Kerala.  The  Joint  Assessment  Mission  (JAM) \nestimated immediate and medium-term reconstruction needs at $26 million in Tamil Nadu and \nKerala. These were assessed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) mission at $40 million for \nTamil Nadu and $8 million for Kerala. The ADB mission incorporated the updated data collected \nby  the  concerned  agencies  on  the  reconstruction  needs  of  those  minor  facilities  which  are \nwidely scattered across the affected areas. This information was not available during the JAM. \n \nTaking into account the lessons of the emergency rehabilitation interventions and local \n3. \nconsultations  by  the  JAM,  the  sector  recovery  strategy  emphasizes  (i)  decentralized  and \ntransparent  decision  making  and  community  participation  with  emphasis  on  gender;  (ii) \nupgrading  systems  with  disaster  resistant  design;  (iii)  providing  employment  opportunities  for \nthe  tsunami-affected  communities;  (iv)  forging  good  working  relationships  with  the  concerned \ndepartments and capable nongovernment organizations (NGOs); (v) ensuring quality of works in \nterms  of  process  and  products  by  setting  out  and  monitoring  measurable  indicators;  and  (vi) \nstrengthening sustainable operation and maintenance (O&M) capacity of the local government \ninstitutions.  \n \nB. \n \nThis  component  will  rehabilitate/upgrade  rural  and  municipal  infrastructure  and  provide \n4. \nrelated services for the tsunami-affected communities of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Rehabilitation \nworks  will  be  carried  out  to  restore  facilities  to  pre-tsunami  level  or  to  a  higher  cost-effective \nstandard.  The \ninclude \nrehabilitated  or  upgraded  under \nrehabilitation/upgrading  of  (i)  village  and  municipal  roads;  (ii)  drainage  canals;  (iii)  public \nbuildings such as common fish landing, processing, and marketing facilities, community centers, \nand panchayat offices (about 450 in Tamil Nadu); and (iv) damaged electricity line network and \ndistribution transformers. The Project will also provide technical support for damage assessment \nsurveys,  construction  quality  control,  and  community  participation.  Rehabilitation  of  public \nbuildings  will  consider  disaster-resistant  design  and  relocation  to  a  safer  environment  as \nappropriate. \n\nthe  Project  will \n\nfacilities \n\nScope \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nSubproject Selection Criteria \n\n \n5. \nThis  component  will  contribute  to  restoring  and  rebuilding  the  livelihood  of  the  affected \ncommunities  by  rehabilitating  essential  minor  village  and  municipal  infrastructure,  providing \nemployment  opportunities  to  local  labor  during  the  process,  and  supporting  local  community \ninstitutions  for  participatory  planning  and  implementation  to  rebuild  their  cohesion  and \nconfidence  for  development.  Specifically,  it  will  contribute  to  reducing  transportation  time  and \nresources  for  goods  and  services,  in  particular  fishery  and  associated  products,  the  main \nindustry  of  the  affected areas.  It  will  lead  to  improved  drainage  conditions,  at least to  the  pre-\ndisaster level. These, along with disaster-resistant rehabilitation of public buildings, will support \nimproved  productive  and  quality  of  life  conditions,  while  providing  essential  employment \nopportunities  to  the  affected  communities.  Village  ponds  will  be  restored  (under  the  livelihood \ncomponent)  achieving  the  twin  objectives  of  employment  and  increased  water  storage.  The \nProject\u2019s institutional support will lead to improved practices in community participation in project \nplanning  and  implementation,  and  sound  technical  design  and  quality  control,  along  with \nincreased involvement  of  local  government  institutions  and beneficiaries  in  O&M  of  completed \nschemes. \n \nC. \n \n6. \nSubprojects  to  be  selected  will  meet  the  general  criteria  outlined  in  Appendix  11. \nRehabilitation/upgrading  works  will  be  packaged  into  individual  subprojects  at  each  village  or \ncommunity,  and  selected  and  implemented  following  the  specific  criteria  and  format  jointly \nprepared by the consultants and the state governments and agreeable to ADB. These include (i) \nconsultation  with \nlocal \ngovernment  institutions;  (ii)  contribution  to  improving  environmental  conditions;  and  (iii) \nconfirmation  of  O&M  sustainability  through  preparation  of  O&M  plans  with  clear  stipulation  of \nresponsibilities and resource requirements of the concerned parties, and confirmed affordability \nby the local governments and the beneficiaries.  \n \nD. \n \n7. \nThe  total  cost  of  this  component  is  $52.59  million  equivalent.  Of  the  total  cost,  $43.53 \nmillion equivalent is for Tamil Nadu and $9.06 million equivalent for Kerala. ADB will finance the \nentire  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $24.93  million  and  $24.37  million  equivalent  of  local  currency \ncost or about 94% of the total cost. The Government will finance the remaining local currency \ncost of $3.29 million equivalent, which includes taxes and duties. Cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 9. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nincluding  vulnerable  groups \n\nthe  affected  communities \n\nthrough \n\n \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nE. \n \n \n \n8. \nThe  Revenue  Administration,  Disaster  Management  and  Mitigation  Department \n(RADMMD) in Tamil Nadu and the Department of Disaster Management (DDM) in Kerala will be \nthe  executing  agencies  (EAs).  The  EAs  will  establish  project  management  units  (PMUs)  with \nrepresentation of line agencies. The PMUs will work closely with the ADB extended missions to \nfacilitate implementation and exercise monitoring and control.  \n \nWithin  this  framework,  in  Tamil  Nadu,  the  Rural  Development  Department  will  be  the \n9. \nimplementing agency (IA) for rural infrastructure subcomponent, whereas the Commissionerate \nof Municipal Administration Department (CMAD) will be the IA for municipal infrastructure. The \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n51 \n \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n2. \n\nProcurement  \n\nConsulting Services \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\nCivil works contracts and procurement of goods and services will follow local competitive \n\nTamil  Nadu  Electricity  Board  will  implement  the  power  distribution  restoration.  In  Kerala,  the \nPublic Works Department will be the IA for rural infrastructure and will delegate implementation \nto  the  concerned  panchayat  as  appropriate,  whereas  the  Kerala  State  Electricity  Board  will  be \nthe IA for power distribution restoration. Project implementation units (PIUs) will be established \nwithin  the  IAs.  Day-to-day  subproject  implementation  will  be  undertaken  by  the  concerned \ndistrict  offices  of  the  IAs.  The  PIUs  will  be  responsible  for  selecting  and  preparing  the \nsubprojects,  and  will  carry  out  the  due  diligence  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  subproject \nselection  criteria  indicated  in  Appendix  11  and  ADB  social,  environmental,  and  resettlement \nsafeguard policies (Appendixes 13, 14, 15, and 16).  \n \n \n \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  3  years,  commencing  in  the  second  quarter  of \n10. \n2005.  The  concerned  state  governments  will  establish  the  PMUs  and  assign  relevant  staff  for \nthe PMUs and IAs within 1 month of project approval. The start-up activities will be completed \nwithin 6 months of loan effectiveness, including (i) recruitment of consultants; (ii) finalization of \nsubproject assessment, prioritization, and selection criteria; (iii) selection of subprojects; and (iv) \nprocurement of immediately required works including processing for retroactive financing.  \n \n \n \n11. \nbidding procedures in accordance with ADB Guidelines for Procurement.  \n \n \n \n12. \nDomestic consulting services are required, comprising road engineer, building/structural \nengineer,  environment  specialist,  resettlement  specialist,  construction  manager,  and  field \nengineers, for (i) overseeing subproject proposal preparation; (ii) advising on technical studies \nand  disaster  resistant  design;  (iii)  monitoring  and  quality  control;  (iv)  helping  with  public \nparticipation; and (v) assisting with reports and other ADB requirements, including safeguards.  \n \n \n \n13. \nFor  effective  management  of  subproject  planning,  implementation  monitoring,  and \nquality control, each subproject will have a subproject implementation plan that sets out distinct \nprocesses and outputs, including impact indicators in their subproject plan. Those indicators will \nbe monitored through a project performance monitoring system for the Project, comprising the \nsystems of effective recording and reporting at the field level, and monitoring and auditing at the \nIA  and  PMU  level  with  the  assistance  of  consultants.  Beneficiaries  will  also  be  involved  in \nproject monitoring and evaluation, through direct reporting to the PMU.  \n \n \n \nThe  concerned  panchayat  and  municipality  is  responsible  for  the  O&M  of  the \n14. \nconstructed  facilities  for  roads,  stormwater  drainage,  and  public  buildings,  while  Tamil  Nadu \nElectricity  Board  and  Kerala  State  Electricity  Board  are  responsible  for  O&M  of  power \ndistribution  with  revenue  collection.  In  Tamil  Nadu,  the  Rural  Development  Department  has \nbeen  increasing  budget  allocations  for  village  infrastructure  maintenance  in  recent  years,  with \npanchayats provided with higher incentives in terms of tax recovery and use of annual budget \nfor maintenance purposes.

In  Kerala,  the  state  government  has  been  progressively  strengthening  the \narrangements  for  panchayat  road  maintenance  in  recent  years  under  its  decentralization \nprocess, by preparing the panchayat road asset portfolio; allocating the road maintenance grant \n(as  a  part  of  a  nondevelopment  grant)  to  each  panchayat  on  the  basis  of  the  portfolio;  and \nstrengthening the allocation of road maintenance grant.  \n \n15. \nFor the purpose of sustainable O&M, subproject specific O&M plans will be developed at \nthe  planning  stage  setting  out  the  annual  O&M  arrangements  and  institutional  responsibilities \nincluding  financial  requirements.  These  will  be  presented  and  confirmed  with  the  concerned \nlocal  government  institutions  and  beneficiaries  when  finalizing  the  subproject  implementation \nplan.  O&M  by  distinct  user  groups will  be  promoted  for  small  common  facilities  such  as  those \nused by local fisherfolk. Affordability of the concerned local government organizations and the \nbeneficiary groups will also be confirmed at this stage with due financial assessments.  \n \n\n \n\n\fCOST ESTIMATES \n \nTable

If the PMU finds that the proposed subproject is eligible in light of \nthe eligibility criteria and the reports are in order, PMU will send the reports to ADB \n\n \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nfor further review, to obtain necessary guidance with regard to the extent of relevant \nanalysis, assessment, plan, etc. \n\n(iii)  ADB  will  review  the  subproject  concept  reports  submitted  by  the  PMU.  If  ADB  finds \nthat  a  proposed  subproject  is  not  likely  to  satisfy  the  eligibility  criteria  and/or  the \nagreed  procedures,  ADB  will  advise  the  PMU  either  (a)  to  modify  the  subproject \nproposal in a manner that will make it eligible for approval or (b) that the subproject \nmust  be  rejected.  If  a  subproject  is  rejected,  the  PMU  may  propose  a  replacement \nsubproject. If the proposed subproject satisfies the eligibility criteria and procedures, \nbased  on  the  resettlement  checklist,  ADB  will  advise  on  the  requirements  of \npreparation and application of the resettlement plan.  \n\n(iv)  Following  approval  of  a  subproject  concept  by  PMU  and  ADB,  the  relevant  IA  will \nconduct  feasibility  study  and  preliminary  design  or  other  similar  design  works,  and \nbased  on  those  works,  develop  a  resettlement  plan  (if  required)  and  undertake  an \nIEE including an environmental management plan.  \n\n(v)  The IA will disclose the resettlement plan (if required) and IEE to the affected persons \n\nand incorporate the results of the consultation. \n\n(vi)  The report of the feasibility study and preliminary design/other design work, including \nthe resettlement plan (if required) and IEE, will be submitted by the IA to the PMU for \nits  appraisal.  The  PMU  will  appraise  the  reports  in  light  of  the  relevant  frameworks. \nBased  on  the  review,  the  PMU  will  prepare  a  summary  appraisal  report  for  each  of \nthe  subprojects.  If  the  PMU  finds  that  one  or  more  proposed  subprojects  are \ntechnically, environmentally, and socially viable, and all reports are in order, the PMU \nwill send those reports, with attachments including the resettlement plan (if required) \nand IEE, to ADB for further review and approval.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(vii)  ADB will review the summary appraisal reports, together with required attachments. If \nADB finds that the proposed subproject satisfies the eligibility criteria and procedures, \nADB will approve the subproject. If ADB finds that the proposed subproject does not \nsatisfy the eligibility criteria and procedures, or does not comply  with sector-specific \ncriteria, and ADB safeguard policies, ADB may advise the PMU on remedial actions \nto be taken for the proposed subproject for it to comply or reject the subproject.  \n\nTable A11: Summary Procedures for Selection and Approval of Subprojects \nRequired Action \n\nPrepare initial list of subprojects with brief description of \nactivities to be implemented in each subproject, and along with \nrough cost estimates submit the proposal to the project \nmanagement unit (PMU) through the technical section. \nCompile and review as appropriate based on the selection \ncriteria, the subproject proposals submitted by the IAs. \n\nBased on agreed selection criteria and the priority of the state \ngovernments, select and approve subproject proposals. \n\nEmpowered Committee \nfor the respective state \n\nResponsibility \nImplementing agencies \n(IAs) with assistance \nfrom consultants as \nrequired \nPMU with assistance \nfrom consultants \n\nIA with assistance from \nconsultant, with inputs \nfrom communities and \ncivil societies \n\nConduct survey and prepare detailed design; hold consultations \nwith different beneficiary groups and civil societies to determine \nlocal needs and priorities; consider social impacts of the \nsubprojects, including the environment and resettlement \neffects; and apply the requirements set forth in the initial \nenvironmental examination and the resettlement framework.  \n \n \n\n Activities \n1. \n\nInitial list of \nsubprojects \n\n2.

Restoring  and  improving  water  supply  and  sanitation  systems,  drainage  networks,  and  solid  waste \nmanagement  activities  will  reduce  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases  and  improve  the  environmental  quality  of \ncoastal districts, as well as the public health and hygiene levels among affected communities. The TEAP will also \nrestore  livelihoods  of  affected  households,  focusing  on  women  and  vulnerable  groups.  Sector  interventions  will \npromote  wage  labor  opportunities,  consultation,  and  community  participation  during  project  implementation.  The \nTEAP  will  mitigate  short-  and  medium-term  increases  in  the  incidence  and  severity  of  poverty  in  tsunami-affected \nareas. It will also contribute to building social capital and community networks and promote disaster preparedness.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                      Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nPoverty  and  Human  Development  in  Tamil  Nadu  and  Kerala:  Poverty  incidence  in  Tamil  Nadu  (21%;  13.05 \nmillion people) and Kerala (12.72%; 4.1 million people) is well below the national average of 26% in 1999/2000. The \nhuman development index value for Tamil Nadu (0.531) and Kerala (0.638) is higher than the national average of \n0.472. Tamil Nadu and Kerala are among the best performing states in terms of health, education, and other social \ndevelopment indicators. Both the states have a high degree of public participation in political life and higher social \ncapital.  Despite  the  favorable  human  development  indicators  of  both  the  states,  poverty,  and  inequality  levels  are \ndisproportionately and significantly high among several social groups. A recent participatory poverty assessment in \nKerala  identified  acute  poverty  concentration  among  the  fishing  and  coastal  communities,  tribal  households, \nagricultural and urban labor, scheduled castes and tribes, the disabled, and people in traditional industries like coir, \ncashew, hand looming, and stone crushing. In Tamil Nadu, rural poverty is also concentrated among the marginal \nrainfed farmers, agriculture labor, and pockets of coastal communities. Poverty among coastal communities is highly \nvaried,  geographically  interstitial  (fragmented  and  intermittent)  and  socially  differentiated.  It  is  much  less \nconspicuous  among  the  surrounding  coastal  development.  The  coastal  poor  are  socioeconomically  and \nenvironmentally  vulnerable  due  to  low  coverage  and  quality  of  water  and  sanitation  services,  and  health  and \neducation  infrastructure.  Poverty  levels  are  compounded  by  income  seasonality,  informal  livelihoods,  and  chronic \nindebtedness.  Environmental  disasters  like  the  tsunami,  and  frequent  cyclones,  have  further  worsened  the \nvulnerability and coping ability of coastal communities. \n \nDamage,  Losses,  and  Tsunami  Impacts:  The  loss  of  human  lives  and  personal  injuries  due  to  the  tsunami  in \ncoastal communities were accentuated by the destruction of houses and property, assets and livelihoods, and social \nand transport infrastructure. Widespread destruction at individual and community levels has led to fragmentation of \nfamilies  and  social  networks,  and  increased  the  number  of  vulnerable  social  groups.  The  fisherfolk  have  suffered \nmaximum  damage  in  terms  of  loss  of  dwelling  units,  and  household  and  productive  assets  like  boats  and  nets.  A \nlarge  number  of  microenterprises  have  been  adversely  affected  by  disruptions  in  supplies  and  markets,  loss  of \nincome-generating assets, equipment, and shops. The damage to agriculture and livestock, though not significant, \nhas  also  affected  the  livelihoods  of  coastal  communities.  Small  and  marginal  farmers,  agricultural  laborers,  and \nother  social  groups  who  depend  on  agriculture,  horticulture,  and  aquaculture  have  been  severely  affected  by  the \ndestruction  of  standing  crops  and  livestock  and  salinization  of  agricultural  land  and  water  sources.  Landless  and \nother  casual  labor  engaged  in  seasonal  employment  and  other  intermittent  activities  for  subsistence  have  also \nsuffered loss of employment and wages. Increases in the number of orphaned and separated children, adolescent \ngirls,  single  parent  households,  households  headed  by  women,  and  elderly  and  disabled  without  social  care  has \nincreased the vulnerability of the poor. Destruction of water supply and sanitation systems and salinization of wells \nhas worsened the already low coverage of sanitation in coastal villages. Destruction of roads, bridges, and culverts \nhas  disrupted  mobility  and  accessibility  of  the  affected  communities  to  essential  social,  economic,  and  relief \nservices.  The  damaged  infrastructure  poses  environmental  and  health  risks  and  will  further  reduce  the  pace  of \nsocial and economic development in the affected communities. The poverty impact of the tsunami is localized and \nexperienced  more  severely  at  the  village  and  community  levels,  especially  for  households  involved  in  fishing, \nagriculture,  horticulture,  aquaculture,  and  microenterprises.  Since  damage  is  largely  confined  to  rural  areas,  the \nincidence and severity of rural poverty is likely to increase among the affected communities. The number of below \npoverty line families is likely to increase in the short and medium term. Families above the poverty line are expected \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nto  slide  below  the  poverty  line.  The  number  of  poor  people  could  increase  if  water  supply,  sanitation,  health,  and \nlivelihood needs are not addressed immediately.  \n \nProject  Benefits  and  Impacts:  Based  on  the  short-  and  medium-term  recovery  and  reconstruction  strategy \noutlined in the joint assessment review report, the TEAP will provide emergency assistance to support the ongoing \ngovernment  and  private  sector  efforts  to  restore  damaged  social  and  economic  infrastructure,  and  restore \nlivelihoods  of  affected  communities  in  Tamil  Nadu  and  Kerala.  The  livelihoods  component  will  restore  the \nmicroenterprises  of  poor  and  low-income  households  through  capacity  building,  enterprise  and  skills  training,  and \nsupport for economic activities. Those affected will be mobilized into existing and new self-help groups and provided \ncapital for income-generating activities and replacement of assets. In addition, the vulnerability of the poor and low-\nincome households will be mitigated through available life and property insurance schemes. The rural and municipal \ninfrastructure component will rehabilitate/upgrade rural and municipal infrastructure and provide related services for \nthe  tsunami-affected  communities.  Restored  and  improved  water  supply  to  the  perennially  water-stressed \ncommunities will reduce the chronic water poverty and vulnerability1 of the coastal poor. By providing improved and \nsustainable  drinking  water  supplies,  and  improving  the  sanitation  coverage,  the  TEAP  will  significantly  improve \npublic  health  and  reduce  morbidity  from  potential  waterborne  diseases.  It  will  also  reduce  women\u2019s  drudgery  in \ncollection/storage of water, and accrue improved health, health care, and productivity benefits to the communities, \nespecially the women. The sanitation and solid waste subcomponents will improve the environmental conditions in \ncoastal  habitations.  Reconstruction  of  the  village  and  panchayat/municipal  roads  and  small-scale  infrastructure, \nsuch as rural markets and fish-loading facilities, will improve local access to essential services and productive public \nassets,  and  support  local  livelihoods  through  labor  opportunities  during  the  implementation.  The  transportation \ncomponent  will  restore  state  and  district  roads  and  bridges  and  repairs  ports  and  harbors,  which  will  enable  the \naffected  populations  to  resume  their  social  and  economic  activities.  The  coastal  population  will  be  able  to  access \nessential  health,  education,  and  emergency  and  other  government  welfare  and  relief  services.  Restored  transport \nlinkages  will  support  the  livelihood  restoration  activities  by  facilitating  physical  access  to  local  fishing  and \ncommodities  markets,  wage  labor,  and  other  alternative  livelihood  opportunities.  Improved  access  to  evacuation \nroutes,  emergency  relief  measures,  and  disaster  shelters  will  increase  a  sense  of  physical  security  among  the \npeople.  Increased  familial  and  community  interaction  will  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  the  affected  households  and \nprovide a sense of social security. The ports and fishing harbors subcomponent will support restoration of labor and \nlivelihood opportunities for those engaged in fisheries, boat building, and other port operations.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nTEAP  preparation  involved  the  identification  and  consultation  of  key  primary  and  secondary  project  stakeholders, \nespecially  during  the  joint  assessment  of  needs  and  damages.  The  key  primary  stakeholders  are  the  tsunami-\naffected coastal communities in the 345 affected villages in Tamil Nadu and 187 villages in Kerala. Other primary \nstakeholders are small farmers, wage labor, women engaged in trading and other microenterprises, self-help group \n(SHG)  members,  scheduled  caste  and  scheduled  tribes  households;  poor  and  low  income  households;  and  other \nvulnerable  groups  like  the  orphans,  adolescent  girls,  and  households  headed  by  women.  The  key  secondary  or \ninstitutional  stakeholders  include  the  government  of  Tamil  Nadu,  department  of  rural  development,  Tamil  Nadu \nWater  and  Drainage  Board,  department  of  special  village  panchayats,  affected  panchayats  and  local  bodies, \nhighways  department,  commisionerate  of  municipal  affairs,  Tamil  Nadu  Corporation  of  Women\u2019s  Development \nLimited, pollution control board, electricity board, department of finance, department of health, department of ports \nand  fisheries,  and  maritime  board.  In  Kerala,  the  secondary  stakeholders  include  the  Government  of  Kerala, \ndepartment  of  disaster  management,  department  of  finance,  fisheries  department,  the  Kerala  Water  Authority, \npoverty alleviation agencies such as Kudumbashree, department of local self governance, affected panchayats and \nlocal  bodies,  department  of  power,  the  public  works  department.  Civil  society  including  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), community groups, and other international agencies engaged in relief and reconstruction are \nthe other secondary stakeholders.   \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nA  community  participation  strategy  is  integrated  into  the  overall  project  design.  The  reconstruction  and  recovery \nstrategy  emphasizes  (i)  utilizing  decentralized  and  transparent  decision  making  and  community  participation,  in \nparticular  for  women;  (ii)  providing  employment  opportunities  for  the  tsunami-affected  communities;  (iii)  building \ngood  working  relationships  with  the  implementing  departments,  community-based  structures  such  as  SHGs  and \nNGOs; and (iv) strengthening sustainable operation and  maintenance capacity of the concerned communities and \nlocal  government \nin  designing  subprojects, \nimplementation, operation and maintenance, and monitoring and evaluation arrangements. The process will involve \ninformation  sharing,  consultations,  interviews,  focus  group  meetings,  and  collaborative  decision-making.  The \n\ninstitutions.  Participatory  approaches  will  be  encouraged \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes \n\n   No \n\n                                                 \n1   Water supply in coastal areas suffers from low per capita supply and high content of fluoride, sodium and iron, with \n\nshallow wells facing high level of salinity in dry seasons. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n67 \n\nsubproject selection criteria includes targeting of most affected groups, especially women and the newly vulnerable \ngroups;  community  consultations  on  subprojects;  practical  and  feasible  mechanisms  for  local  communities  to \nparticipate in reconstruction works; preferential use of local labor; and local procurement for livelihood support.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy  to  maximize  impacts  on  women:  The  TEAP  will  restore  and  improve  women\u2019s  access  to  income-\ngenerating activities, essential social services, community structures, decision-making mechanisms, and other local \nrecovery  and  reconstruction-related  information.  Improved  water  and  sanitation  infrastructure  and  other  public \nservices  will  accrue  health  and  health  care  benefits  to  women  and  their  families  and  provide  more  time  for \nproductive income-generating activities by reducing the drudgery in collecting water. The livelihoods component is \ndesigned  as  a  targeted  intervention  to  promote  social  and  economic  empowerment among the coastal  women by \nenabling them to regain and improve their lost incomes, upgrade their technical and business skills, access internal \ngroup  savings  for  production/consumption  needs,  access  institutional  credit,  and  mobilize  and  involve  themselves \nthrough  women\u2019s  organizations.  Fifty  percent  of  the  livelihood  component  is  earmarked  for  women  in  the  affected \nareas.  \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nE.  Social Safeguards and other Social Risks \n \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\nItem \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nPlan Required \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone \n\nLand acquisition and resettlement impacts  are envisaged \nin  both  the  states  since  land  acquisition  for  construction \nwork  might  cause  resettlement  impacts.  For  all  project \ncomponents,  most  rehabilitation  work  will  be  carried  out \nwithin the  original right-of-way  while the improvements to \ncurrent  engineering  standards  for  some  major  districts, \nother  district  roads,  and  internal  roads  might  require  the \nacquisition  of  narrow  strips  of  land.  For  the  rehabilitation \nof  rural  and  municipal  infrastructure,  power  transmission \nlines,  ports  and  harbors,  and  street  lighting,  no  land \nacquisition  or \nimpacts  are  envisaged. \nRehabilitation  and  construction  of  new  public  buildings \nsuch  as  community  centers,  panchayat  offices,  and \nanganwadi  centers  might \nland \nacquisition,  if  state  land  is  not  available.  The  Project  will \nentail A/B category subprojects. \n \nThe  TEAP  will  restore  essential  social  and  economic \ninfrastructure  and  services  damaged  and/or  affected  by \nthe tsunami. It will restore the incomes and livelihoods of \nthe affected communities.  \n\nrequire  small-scale \n\nresettlement \n\nNo adverse impact on labor is anticipated. The TEAP will \ncreate  wage  employment  through  the  livelihoods  and \ninfrastructure  components.  Skilled  and  unskilled  jobs  will \nbe created during construction. The TEAP will also benefit \nthose  who  lost  their  primary  source  of  livelihoods  based \non  fisheries,  farming,  and  other  microenterprise  sectors. \nWomen  will  have  equal  access  to  jobs  and  wages  under \nthe TEAP.  \nis  anticipated.

The \nTEAP emphasizes the mitigation of immediate losses of priority assets by rehabilitating fully or \npartially damaged basic infrastructure.  \n \n2. \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  are  envisaged  for  the  TEAP  in  Tamil  Nadu. \nThe  bridge  in  Kanyakumari,  if  it  cannot  be  rebuilt  on  the  original  alignment,  will  have  to  be \nrealigned.  The  government\u2019s  decision  as  to  whether  the  bridge  can  be  rebuilt  on  the  original \nalignment or requires a new alignment is still under consideration. Most rehabilitation work will \nbe carried out within the original right-of-way, while the improvement of several major district and \ninternal  roads  might  require  acquisition  of  narrow  strips  of  land.  Construction  of  emergency \nevacuation routes may also necessitate small-scale land acquisition and could cause temporary \nacquisition, disruptions, and losses. No land acquisition or resettlement impacts are envisaged \nfor  the  rehabilitation  of  rural  and  municipal  infrastructure,  power  transmission  lines,  ports  and \nharbors,  and  street  lighting.  Rehabilitation  and  construction  of  new  public  buildings  such  as \ncommunity  centers,  panchayat  offices,  and  anganwadi  centers  might  require  small-scale  land \nacquisition, if government land is not available. \n \n3. \nWith  regard  to  the  provision  of  emergency  assistance  to  tsunami-affected  people,  the \nTEAP  ensures  that  all  will  benefit  on  an  equitable  basis.  Among  those  affected  are  scheduled \ntribe  populations.  Initial  needs  assessment  did  not  identify  likely  adverse  effects  arising  from \ntheir status as scheduled tribe. The TEAP will have no impacts on their tribal and cultural identity \nor  on  their  social  and  economic  institutions.  However,  if  impacts  on  them  are  identified  during \nTEAP  implementation,  such  impacts  will  be  addressed  through  specific  actions,  as  necessary. \nSuch specific action will be formulated according to the approved resettlement framework (RF) \nfor the TEAP.  \n \nThe TEAP will be implemented as a sector project and the RF outlines the broad scope \n4. \nof  the  TEAP\u2019s  resettlement  policies,  procedures,  and  institutional  requirements.  Resettlement \nplans  (RPs)  and  specific  actions  for  subprojects  that  will  have  involuntary  resettlement  and \nindigenous peoples issues will be prepared according to the RF during project implementation. \n\nA. \n\n \nPolicy Framework and Entitlements \n \n5.  \nIn February 2004, the Government of India approved the National Policy on Resettlement \nand Rehabilitation (NPRR). The policy provides broad guidelines and executive instructions and \nwill  be  applicable  to  projects  displacing  500  families  or  more  in  flat  lands  and  250  families  or \nmore  in  hilly  areas.  The  NPRR  requires  projects  to  (i)  minimize  displacement  and  identify \nnondisplacing  or  least-displacing  alternatives;  (ii)  plan  the  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  of \nproject-affected families including special needs of tribal and vulnerable sections; (iii) provide a \nbetter  standard  of  living  to  project-affected  families;  and  (iv)  facilitate  harmonious  relationships \nbetween the requiring body and project-affected families through mutual cooperation. While the \nNPRR  recognizes  most  of  the  significant  resettlement  principles  in  the  Asian  Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB) Involuntary Resettlement Policy (IRP), the NPRR does not meet some of the IRP\u2019s \nsafeguards.  First,  the  NPRR\u2019s  threshold  of  applicability  is  limited  to  land  acquisitions  for \nhighways, railway lines, transmission lines, and pipelines. Second, each project-affected family \nwill  be  offered  an  ex-gratia  payment  of  Rs10,000  and  no  other  resettlement  and  rehabilitation \nbenefits.  Third,  replacement  value  is  not  clearly  defined  and  is  not  taken  into  account  in \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n69 \n\ncalculating lump-sum compensation. Fourth, no specific entitlements are available for squatters \nand encroachers.  \n \n6. \nThe  Land  Acquisition  Act  1894  and  its  amendments  to  date  generally  governs  land \nacquisition and compensation in Tamil Nadu. The Act covers only legal titleholders and provides \nfor  (i)  market  value  of  the  land;  (ii)  compensation  of  30%  on  the  market  value  for  compulsory \nacquisition; (iii) an additional amount for trees, crops, houses, or other immovable properties; (iv) \ndamage due to severing of land, residence, or place of business; and (v) an interest of 12% on \nthe  market  value  from  the  date  of  notification  to  award.  The  IRP  has  some  additional \ncomplementary provisions especially with regard to displacement and resettlement of squatters \nand other informal settlers.  \n \nTo  reduce  inherent  delays  in  the  land  acquisition  process  from  18  to  6  months  or  less, \n7. \nthe  Government  of  Tamil  Nadu  (GOTN)  issued  a  government  order  in  1995\u2014\u201cAcquisition  of \nLand for various purposes, Acquisition through negotiation\u2014Uniformity in procedure, fixation of \nland  value  and  Constitution  of  Committee.\u201d  The  order  sets  out  the  principles  of  fixing  of  land \nvalue for negotiation. It allows negotiations up to 150% of the market value/guideline value for \neach  hectare  of  land.  Thus,  whenever  land  must  be  acquired,  GOTN  constitutes  a  district \nnegotiation committee with the district collector as the head with representatives from other line \ndepartments (Revenue, Requisitioning Agency, and Finance), which could sanction up to a total \namount of Rs2,000,000. If the total value of land exceeds Rs2,000,000, a state committee will be \nappointed.  When  the  negotiated  value  exceeds  150%  of  the  market  value/guideline  value  for \neach hectare of land, each negotiation, irrespective of the total cost, is referred to the concerned \nadministrative  department  of  GOTN  through  the  commissioner  of  land  administration  for  final \norders.  The  negotiation  takes  place  between  a  willing  seller  and  GOTN.  Thus,  when  the \nnegotiated value exceeds the amount that can be sanctioned by the district collector or the state \ncommittee, it is referred to the concerned administrative department of GOTN for final orders. A \nseller who is not in agreement with the amount of compensation offered can withdraw from the \nnegotiation.1\n\n \n8. \nBased  on  these  state  laws  and  regulation  on  land  acquisition,  the  ADB  IRP  and  the \nNPRR,  the  following  resettlement  principles  will  be  applied  to  all  TEAP  subprojects:2  (i)  land \nacquisition and other involuntary resettlement impacts will be minimized as much as possible; (ii) \nwherever  possible,  Government  land  will  be  utilized  which  is  free  from  encumbrances  and  will \nnot  include  land  that  is  squatted  upon;  (iii)  those  affected  will  be  informed  and  consulted  on \ncompensation  options  and  in  formulating  the  RPs  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  RF;  (iv)  land \nand  other  property  compensation  will  be  paid  at  replacement  costs;  (v)  payment  of \ncompensation for lost land, housing, assets, and other resettlement assistance will be given in \nfull  before  awarding  civil  contracts;  (vi)  compensation  at  replacement  cost  and  resettlement \nassistance  will  be  given  to  all  nontitled  people  affected  (e.g.,  informal  dwellers/squatters,  and \nencroachers)  before  acquiring  land  and  their  properties;  (vii)  all  those  affected  will  receive \nassistance to restore their income and to rehabilitate their livelihood; and (viii) special assistance \nwill be given to households headed by women and other vulnerable groups.  \n\n \nIn case of land acquisition, compensation will be paid at mutually agreed rates through \n9. \nnegotiations  as  outlined  in  the  1995  government  order  at  replacement  costs.  In  the  event  the \n\n                                                \n \n1   For purposes of housing and housing related infrastructure in February 2005, GOTN issued G.O. Ms. No. 75 which \nenabled GOTN to direct District Level Negotiation Committees to purchase lands through private negotiations up to \na maximum of 200% of the market value or guidelines value, whichever is lower, without any monetary ceiling for \nthe rehabilitation of tsunami affected people. \n\n2   The  Executing  Agency  will  be  responsible  to  ensure  compliance/clearances  with  relevant  government  laws  and \n\nregulation, if any, in addition to what is stated in the RF. \n\n \n \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nto \n\nthe  affected  person.  The  Government  will  bear \n\nlandowner does not agree to acquisition through negotiation and the land is acquired as per the \nLand  Acquisition  Act,  compensation  will  be  paid  at  replacement  costs.  If  the  compensation \namount assessed by a district collector is lower than that of the replacement cost determined by \nthe land acquisition and valuation committee, the difference will be paid in the form of a special \ntransaction  costs  such  as \ngrant \nstamps/registration costs in case of purchase of replacement land. Nontitled affected people will \nbe  entitled  to  both  compensation  and  rehabilitation  assistance  based  on  the  nature  of  their \nlosses.  Replacement  cost  of  structures  will  also  be  paid  to  squatters/informal  dwellers,  and \nloss  of \nresettlement  assistance,  such  as  shifting  allowance  and  compensation \nworkdays/income.  Households  headed  by  women  and  other  vulnerable  households  (such  as \nscheduled  tribe/scheduled  caste,  disabled,  elderly)  will  be  eligible  for  additional  assistance  in \nterms of income restoration. \n\nfor \n\n \n10. \nThe entitlement matrix (Table A14) lists types of losses, eligibility, and entitlements, and \nprovides  basic  parameters  for  the  preparation  of  compensation  and  resettlement  benefits.

Through  its  project  management  unit  (PMU)  it \nwill be responsible for overall coordination, planning, implementation, monitoring, and financing \nof  all  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  activities.  RADMMD,  through  the  PMU  and  through  the \nimplementing agencies (IAs), will prepare RPs for each subproject that will have a resettlement \nimpact or impact on indigenous peoples or both. The RPs will be prepared in accordance with \nthis agreed RF and in compliance with the ADB IRP. The IAs with the assistance from the social \ndevelopment  and  resettlement  specialist  under  the  design  and  supervision  consultants  and \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  will  carry  out  social  impact  assessment  surveys  and \nundertake  census,  asset  inventory,  and  detailed  measurement  surveys  for  each  subproject.  If \nimpacts  are  found  to  be  \u201csignificant,\u201d3  a  full  RP  will  be  prepared  for  each  subproject  and  if \nimpacts  are  less  than  significant,  a  short  RP  will  be  prepared  for  that  subproject.  The  RP  will \ninclude measures to ensure that socioeconomic conditions, needs, and priorities of women are \nidentified,  and  that  the  process  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  not  disadvantage \nwomen. If new categories of affected people and types of losses are identified, entitlements will \nbe  included  in  accordance  with  the  IRP.  RPs  will  be  prepared  in  close  consultation  with  those \naffected and will be disclosed to them. RADMMD will review the RPs and submit them to ADB \nfor review and approval. No civil work contract will be awarded before the approval of the RP by \nADB. If any impacts on the indigenous people are identified, they will be addressed adequately \nthrough specific action as outlined in the entitlement matrix. \n \nC. \n \n12. \nThe  Revenue  Administration,  Disaster  Management  and  Mitigation  Department \n(RADMMD)  at  the  state-level  will  be  the  EA  of  the  TEAP,  while  the  State  Level  Steering \nCommittee (SLSC) will have the overall advice and guidance with the departments and the IAs. \nThe  PMU  formed  within  RADMMD  and  headed  by  the  project  director  will  be  responsible  for \noverall coordination, planning, implementation, monitoring, and financing of all resettlement and \nrehabilitation activities under the TEAP. RADMMD will depute an official within the PMU to be in \ncharge  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  operations,  and  will  report  to  the  project  director. \nEach  IA  in  their  project  implementation  unit  will  also  have  qualified  social/resettlement \nprofessionals.  The  social  development  and  resettlement  specialist  will  assist  the  PMU  and \nIAs/line departments in preparing RPs. The project director will recruit and appoint local NGOs, \n\nInstitutional Responsibilities \n\n                                                 \n3    Involuntary resettlement category A: Significant means 200 or more people will experience major impacts which are \ndefined as (i) being physically displaced from housing, or (ii) losing 10% or more of their productive assets (income \ngenerating).  Category  A  projects  require  a  full  resettlement  plan.  Involuntary  resettlement  Category  B:  Not \nsignificant include involuntary resettlement impacts that are not deemed significant and require a short resettlement \nplan. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n73 \n\nthat  any \n\ninformation.4  RADMMD  will  ensure \n\nas  required,  to  help  prepare  and  implement  resettlement  activities.  The  concerned  staff  at  the \nPMU, IAs/field offices, project NGOs, and revenue department officials will undergo a week long \norientation and training in resettlement policy and management. The deputed official in the PMU \nwith  the  assistance  from  the  social  development  and  resettlement  specialist  will  work  in  close \ncoordination  with  the  respective  IAs  and  project  NGOs  on  the  day-to-day  activities  of  RP \nimplementation.  \n \n13. \nA  land  value  assessment  for  the  project  committee  headed  by  the  district  collector  or \nhis/her representative will also be formed with representatives from RADMMD, IAs, district/tehsil \nLand  Revenue  office,  representatives  of  those  affected,  local  government,  village  leaders, \nprofessional  assessors,  and  implementing  NGO  to  assess  replacement  value  of  lost  assets \nthrough  a  land  market  value  survey  and  through  compiling  and  comparing  other  available \nsources  of \nland  acquisition  and \nresettlement/relocation is preceded by a satisfactory RP, formulated according to the agreed RF. \nRADMMD will also ensure that appropriate entitlements and mitigation measures are included in \nthe  RP  especially  for  the  benefit  of  vulnerable  groups\u2014households  headed  by  women,  below \npoverty  line,  scheduled caste/scheduled  tribes, the  elderly,  and  disabled.  The  PMU  will  submit \nRPs  for  ADB  review  and  approval,  and  will  ensure  that  affected  persons  will  receive \ncompensation and other entitlements before civil work contracts are awarded. \n \nD. \n \n14. \nThe resettlement plans for all subprojects will be prepared and implemented from  June \n2005 to December 2006. GOTN will cover all costs related to land acquisition and resettlement \nbudgets.  All  compensation  and  resettlement  assistance  will  be  paid  prior  to  displacement. \nRADMMD  will  ensure  that  funds  are  delivered  on  time  to  the  district  collector  and  the \nimplementing NGOs for timely RP implementation.  \n \nE. \n \n15. \nIn preparing an RP, all stakeholders will be consulted by RADMMD through focus group \ndiscussions  and  meetings.  The  RPs  will  be  made  available  in  the  local  language(s)  during \nmeetings in the various communities and will be disclosed to all affected persons. Summary RPs \nwill  be  disclosed  on  the  ADB  Involuntary  Resettlement  Website.  Consultations  with  those \naffected will continue throughout project implementation. \n\nDisclosure, Consultation, and Grievances \n\nImplementation Schedule and Budget \n\nfrom  RADMMD, \n\nIAs,  people  affected,  women/vulnerable  groups, \n\nGrievance  redress  committees  will  be  established  in  each  administrative  district,  with \n16. \nrepresentation \nlocal \ngovernment, and NGOs chaired by the district collector or his/her representative, e.g., additional \ndistrict magistrate in charge of land acquisition. Through public consultations, those affected will \nbe informed that they have a right to grievance redress. They can call upon the support of NGOs \nto  assist  them  in  presenting  their  grievances  or  queries  to  the  grievance  redress  committee, \nwhich are expected to settle many grievances. The committees must resolve grievances within a \nstipulated  time.  Their  decision  will  be  binding  unless  challenged  by  a  court  of  law.  The \ncommittees  will  meet  at  least  four  times  a  month  during  the  first  6  months  of  project \nimplementation, and twice a month from the seventh month.  \n\n                                                \n \n4  District  Level  Monitoring  Committees  and  Village  Level  Monitoring  Committees  will  be  extensively  utilized  for  this \n\npurpose. \n\n \n\n\f74 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n \nF. \n \n17. \nRADMMD  will  establish  a  monthly  monitoring  system  and  prepare  monthly  progress \nreports  on  all  aspects  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities.  The  report  will  contain \nprogress  made  in  RP  implementation  with  particular  attention  to  monitoring  and  the  delivery  of \nentitlements. The deputed official in charge of land acquisition and resettlement in the PMU with \nassistance from the social development and resettlement specialist, through the IAs, field offices, \nand  NGOs  will  monitor  the  progress  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  and  also  prepare \nbiannual  reports,  forwarding  them  to  ADB  for  review.  ADB  review  mission  back-to-office  reports \nwill include progress in resettlement plan implementation. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n75 \n\nRESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n(KERALA) \n\n \nThe Tsunami Emergency Assistance (Sector) Project (TEAP) consists of (i) construction \n1. \nof  small  bridges  on  evacuation  routes;  (ii)  rehabilitation  and  standardization  of  major  district \nroads  and  other  district  roads;  (iii)  rehabilitation  and  rebuilding  of  fully  and  partially  damaged \nrural  and  municipal  infrastructure,  such  as  water  supply,  sanitation,  drainage,  internal  roads, \npower  transmission  lines,  street  lighting,  and  public  buildings;  (iv)  rehabilitation  of  ports  and \nharbors;  and  (v)  capacity  building  and  implementation  assistance.  The  TEAP  emphasizes \nmitigation  of  immediate  losses  of  priority  assets  through  rehabilitation  of  fully  or  partially \ndamaged  basic  infrastructure.  The  Department  of  Disaster  Management  (DMD)  will  be  the \nExecuting Agency.  \n \n2. \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  for  the  TEAP  are  envisaged  in  Kerala.  The \nconstruction of three emergency evacuation bridges for disaster preparedness in Allapuzha and \nKollam  districts  could  require  the  acquisition  of  private  land  triggering  resettlement  impacts. \nHowever,  as  improvement  of  major  district  roads  and  other  district  roads  to  accepted \nengineering standards will be carried out on their existing right-of-way, only narrow strips of land \nwill need to be acquired at several locations. Resettlement impact of rehabilitation of rural and \nmunicipal  infrastructure,  power  transmission  lines,  and  ports  and  harbors  are  expected  to  be \nminimal.  Rehabilitation  and  construction  of  new  public  buildings  such  as  community  centers, \npanchayat  offices,  and  anganwadi  centers  might  require  small-scale  land  acquisition,  if \ngovernment land is not available. \n\n3. \nScheduled  tribe  populations  are  among  the  tsunami-affected.  Initial  need  assessment, \nhowever, did not identify any likely adverse effects on them. However, if any adverse impacts on \nthem are identified during TEAP implementation, they will be addressed through specific actions, \nlisted in resettlement framework (RF), as necessary.  \n \n4. \nThe  RF  outlines  the  broad  scope  of  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  resettlement \npolicies  and  procedures  that  are  applicable  to  the  TEAP,  and  institutional  requirements  to \nimplement  the  TEAP.  Resettlement  plans  (RPs)  and  specific  actions,  if  any,  will  be  prepared \naccording to the agreed RF during TEAP implementation. \n\nA. \n\n \nPolicy Framework and Entitlements \n \n5. \nThe Government of India in February 2004 approved the National Policy on Resettlement \nand Rehabilitation (NPRR). The policy provides broad guidelines and executive instructions, and \nwill  be  applicable  to  projects  displacing  500  families  or  more  in  flat  lands  and  250  families  or \nmore  in  hilly  areas.  The  NPRR  requires  projects  to  (i)  minimize  displacement  and  identify \nnondisplacing  or  least-displacing  alternatives;  (ii)  plan  the  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  of \nproject-affected families, including special needs of tribal and vulnerable sections; (iii) provide a \nbetter  standard  of  living  to  project-affected  families;  and  (iv)  facilitate  harmonious  relationships \nbetween the requiring body and project-affected families through mutual cooperation. The NPRR \ndoes not meet some of key safeguards of the ADB Involuntary Resettlement Policy (IRP). First, \nthe  NPRR\u2019s  threshold  of  applicability  is  limited  to  land  acquisitions  for  highways,  railway  lines, \ntransmission  lines,  and  pipelines.  Second,  each  project-affected  family  will  be  offered  an  ex-\ngratia  payment  of  Rs10,000  and  no  other  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  benefits.  Third, \nreplacement  value  is  not  clearly  defined  and  is not  taken  into  account  in  calculating  lump-sum \ncompensation. Fourth, no specific entitlements are available for squatters and encroachers. On \nthe other hand, the NPRR does recognize some of the significant resettlement principles that are \nenshrined in the IRP.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f76 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n \n6. \nThe  Land  Acquisition  Act  of  1894  and  its  amendments  to  date  generally  govern  land \nacquisition and compensation in Kerala. The act covers only legal land titleholders and provides \nfor  (i)  market  value  of  land;  (ii)  compensation  of  30%  on  the  market  value  for  compulsory \nacquisition; (iii) additional compensation for trees, crops, houses, or other immovable properties; \n(iv) damage due to severing of land, residence, or place of business; and (v) an interest of 12% \non  the  total  compensation  agreed  from  the  date  of  notification  to  the  award.  The  IRP \ncomplements the Land Acquisition Act, especially with regard to displacement and resettlement \nof squatters and other informal settlers.  \n \n7. \nThe  Government  of  Kerala  (GOK)  has  adopted  the  Rehabilitation  and  Resettlement \nPrinciples and Policy Framework for fast-track projects, which are in line with the ADB IRP. The \npolicy principles state that (i) all acquisition of private land will be under the Land Acquisition Act \nand  compensation  paid  under  the  Act  will  be  supplemented  with  further  rehabilitation  and \nresettlement  support  to  meet  replacement  value  of  all  assets  and  to  improve  the  standard  of \nliving of those affected; (ii) common property resources will be replaced as far as feasible, and \nassistance  will  be  provided  at  replacement  value  to  the  community  if  replacement  fails;  (iii) \nbefore  taking  possession  of  acquired  lands  and  properties,  all  compensation  and  resettlement \nand rehabilitation and related activities will be completed in accordance with the policy; (iv) every \neffort will be made to ensure that new housing for all affected persons is available before people \nare  required  to  relocate;  (v)  if  those  affected  are  unable  to  continue  with  their  previous \noccupations, they will be provided with support and assistance through alternative employment \nstrategies;  (vi)  land  compensation  will  not  be extended  to  encroachers  and  squatters,  but  they \nwill  be  provided  with  rehabilitation  and  resettlement  assistance;  (vii)  people  affected  will  be \ninvolved in planning, implementation, and monitoring of the project; (viii) RPs will be translated \ninto  local  languages  and  disclosed  to  all  those  affected;  and  (ix)  vulnerable  groups  including \nthose  living  below  poverty  line,  scheduled  caste,  scheduled  tribe,  households  headed  by \nwomen,  orphans,  destitutes,  and  the  disabled  will  be  provided  with  suitable  additional \nrehabilitation assistance.  \n \n8. \nAs per the approved Guidelines for Accelerating Land Acquisition for fast-track projects, \nGOK  has  resorted  to  direct  purchase  of  land  from  land  titleholders.  The  process  is  initiated \nthrough  the  issuance  of  the  notification  under  section  4(1)  of  the  Land  Acquisition  Act,  and \nsection  6(1)  of  the  Survey  and  Boundaries  Act,  1961.  The  land  price  is  arrived  at  by  taking \nrecourse  to  three  systems:  (i)  taking  into  account  the  prescribed  rates  or  the  average  of  the \nactual  transaction  rates  of  similar  lands  for  contemporary  years  for  which  sale  deeds  are \nregistered; (ii) taking into consideration 20 times of the annual value of gross production of the \nconcerned land, averaged over the preceding 5 years; and (iii) fixing market value of land equal \nto the minimum land value if so prescribed by state government under the Indian Stamp Act for \nthe  purpose  of  registration  of  sale  deeds  under  the  Indian  Registration  Act  of  1908.  The \nreplacement value is fixed at whichever is the highest among the three amounts arrived at using \nthe  three  alternate  methods.  In  case  replacement  value  is  higher  than  the  market  value \ndetermined  by  the  district  collector, the  difference  will  be  paid  in  the  form  of  assistance  by  the \nproject. Direct purchase methods in fast-track projects are applicable to all cases of transfer of \nland to the ownership of the project authority in which a land titleholder is willing to enter into a \ndirect sale deed. The land acquisition proceedings initiated in respect of the parcels of land are \nthen withdrawn through a notification under section 48 of the Land Acquisition Act, wherein the \ngovernment can withdraw from acquisition of any land of which possession has not been taken. \nIn cases where direct purchase cannot be effected for any specific reason, procedures under the \nLand  Acquisition  Act  is  continued  leading  to  passing  of  award  under  the  Act  and  provision  of \nadditional rehabilitation and resettlement assistance. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n77 \n\nBased  on  the  above  state  laws  and  regulation  on  land  acquisition,  ADB  Policy  on \n9. \nInvoluntary  Resettlement,1  the  NPRR,  Rehabilitation  and  Resettlement  Policy  of  Fast-Track \nProjects,  and  Guidelines  for  Accelerating  Land  Acquisition  adopted  by  the  government,  the \nfollowing resettlement principles will be applied to all TEAP subprojects:2 (i) land acquisition and \nother  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  will  be  minimized  as  much  as  possible;  (ii)  wherever \npossible,  Government  land  will  be  utilized  that  is  free  from  encumbrances  and  will  not  include \nland that is squatted upon; (iii) affected people will be informed and consulted on compensation \noptions and in formulating RPs in accordance with the agreed RF; (iv) land and other property \ncompensation  will  be  paid  at  replacement  cost;  (v)  payment  of  compensation  for  lost  land, \nhousing,  assets,  and  other  resettlement  assistance  will  be  given  in  full  before  awarding  civil \ncontracts; (vi) compensation at replacement cost, and resettlement and relocation assistance will \nbe  given  to  all  nontitled  people  affected  (e.g.,  informal  dwellers/squatters,  and  encroachers) \nbefore  acquiring  land  and  their  properties;  (vii)  all  those  affected  will  get  assistance  to  restore \ntheir  income  and  to  rehabilitate  their  livelihood;  and  (viii)  special  assistance  to  households \nheaded by women and other vulnerable groups. \n\n \nIn  case  of  land  acquisition,  compensation  will  be  paid  at  a  mutually  agreed  rate  that  is \n10. \nreplacement value following the methods of land price determination mentioned in para 8. If land \nis acquired as per the Land Acquisition Act, compensation will be paid at replacement costs. If \nthe compensation amount assessed by a district collector is lower than that of the replacement \ncost as assessed by the Land Assessment Value Committee, the difference will be paid in the \nform of a special grant to the affected person. The Government will bear transaction costs such \nas stamps/registration costs in case of purchase of replacement land. Nontitled affected persons \nwill be entitled to both compensation and rehabilitation assistance based on the nature of their \nlosses.  Replacement  cost  of  structure  will  also  be  paid  to  squatters/informal  dwellers  and \nrelocation and resettlement assistance such as shifting allowance and compensation for loss of \nworkdays/income.  Households  headed  by  women  and  other  vulnerable  households  (such  as \nscheduled  tribe/scheduled  caste,  disabled,  elderly)  will  be  eligible  for  additional  assistance  in \nterms of income restoration. \n\n \n11. \nThe entitlement matrix (Table A15) lists types of losses, eligibility, and entitlements, and \nprovides  basic  parameters  for  the  preparation  of  compensation  and  resettlement  benefits.  The \nmatrix will apply to all subprojects. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n \n1   ADB. 1995. Policy on Involuntary Resettlement.

The RPs will be prepared in accordance with this agreed RF and in compliance \nwith  the  ADB  IRP.  The  IAs  with  the  assistance  from  social  development  and  resettlement \nspecialist  under  the  design  and  supervision  consultants,  and  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs) will carry out social impact assessment surveys and undertake census, asset inventory, \nand detailed measurement surveys for each subproject. If impacts are found to be \u201csignificant,\u201d4 \na full RP will be prepared for each subproject and if impacts are less than significant, a short RP \nwill be prepared. The RP will include measures to ensure that socioeconomic conditions, needs, \nand priorities of women are identified; and that the process of land acquisition and resettlement \nwill  not  disadvantage  women.  If  new  categories  of  affected  people  and  types  of  losses  are \nidentified, their entitlements will be included in RPs in accordance with the agreed RF and IRP. \nRPs will be prepared in close consultation with all those affected and will be disclosed to them in \na language that they could understand. DMD will review all RPs; and submit all RPs to ADB for \nreview and approval. No civil works contract will be awarded before approval of an RP by ADB. \nAny  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples  identified  will  be  adequately  addressed  through  specific \nactions, as outlined in the entitlement matrix of the agreed RF.  \n \nC. \n \n13. \nThe PMU will be formed within DMD and headed by a project director. The PMU will be \nresponsible  for  overall  coordination,  planning,  implementation,  monitoring,  and  financing  all \nresettlement and rehabilitation activities under the Project. DMD will depute an official within the \nPMU  to  be  in  charge  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  operations, and  report  to  the  project \ndirector.  Each  IA  will  have  a  project  implementation  unit  with  qualified  social/resettlement \nprofessionals.  The  social  development  and  resettlement  specialist  will  assist  the  PMU  and  IAs \n/line departments in preparing RPs. The project director will recruit and appoint local NGOs, as \nrequired,  to  assist  in  preparing  and  implementing  resettlement  activities.  The  concerned  PMU \nstaff, IAs/field offices, project NGOs, and revenue department officials will undergo a week-long \norientation and training in resettlement policy and management. The deputed official in the PMU, \nwith  the  assistance  from  the  social  development  and  resettlement  specialist,  will  work  in  close \ncoordination  with  the  respective  IAs  and  project  NGO/s  on  the  day-to-day  activities  of  RP \nimplementation. A land value assessment committee headed by the district collector or his/her \nrepresentative  will  be  formed  with  representatives  from  DMD,  IAs,  district/Tehsil  land  revenue \noffice,  representatives  from  people  affected,  local  government,  village  leaders,  professional \nassessors  and  implementing  NGO  to  assess  replacement  value  of  lost  assets  through  a  land \nmarket value survey following the systems of assessments mentioned in para. 8. \n\nInstitutional Responsibilities \n\nDMD  will  ensure  that  any  land  acquisition  and  resettlement/relocation  is  preceded  by  a \n14. \nsatisfactory RP, formulated according to the agreed RF. DMD will also ensure that appropriate \nentitlements  and  mitigation  measures  are  included  in  the  RP,  especially  for  the  benefit  of \nvulnerable  groups:  households  headed  by  women,  below  the  poverty  line,  scheduled \ncaste/scheduled tribes, the elderly, and disabled. The PMU will submit RPs for ADB review and \napproval,  and  will  ensure  that  those  affected  receive  compensation  and  other  entitlements \nbefore civil work contracts are awarded. \n\n                                                \n \n3    IAs  include  Department  of  Fisheries  and  Cooperatives,  Ports/Harbor  Engineering  Department,  Kerala  State \n\nElectricity Board, Kerala Water Authority, Public Works Department, and Rural Development Department. \n\n4    Involuntary Resettlement Category A: Significant means 200 or more people will experience major impacts, defined \nas  (i)  being  physically  displaced  from  housing,  or  (ii)  losing  10%  or  more  of  their  productive  assets  (income \ngenerating).  Category  A  projects  require  a  full  resettlement  plan.  Involuntary  Resettlement  Category  B:  Not \nsignificant  includes  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  that  are  not  deemed  significant  and  require  a  short \nresettlement plan. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n81 \n\nImplementation Schedule and Budget \n\n \nD. \n \n15. \nThe  resettlement  plans  for  all  subprojects  will  be  prepared  and  implemented  from  July \n2005  to  December  2006.  All  costs  related  to  land  acquisition  and  purchases  will  be  borne  by \nGOK.  DMD  will  ensure  that  sufficient  funds  are  delivered  on  time  to  the  district  collector  to \ndisburse  to  those  affected.  The  project  implementing  NGOs  will  monitor  the  acquisition,  land \npurchase, and payment of replacement value to those affected. Land acquisition and payment of \ncompensation and other special rehabilitation and resettlement assistance will begin as soon as \nthe Project is approved and will be completed within 2 years.  \n \nE. \n \n16. \nIn  preparing  an  RP,  DMD  will  consult  all  stakeholders  through  focus  group  discussions \nand  meetings.  Once  the  draft  RPs  are  formulated,  they  will  be  made  available  in  local \nlanguage(s) to all people affected. RPs will be disclosed on the ADB Involuntary  Resettlement \nWebsite. Consultations with those affected will continue throughout project implementation. \n\nDisclosure, Consultation, and Grievances \n\n17. \nGrievance  redress  committees  will  be  established  in  each  administrative  district.  They \nwill  have  representation  from  DMD,  IAs,  people  affected,  women/vulnerable  groups,  local \ngovernment,  and  NGOs,  and  be  chaired  by  the  district  collector  or  his/her  representative  e.g., \nadditional  district  magistrate  in  charge  of  land  acquisition.  Through  public  consultations,  those \naffected will be informed that they have a right to grievance redress. They can enlist NGOs to \nassist them in presenting their grievances or queries to the grievance redress committee. is the \ngrievance redress committees are anticipated to settle most of the grievances. The committees \nmust  resolve  grievances  within  a  stipulated  time,  and  their  decision  will  be  binding  unless \nchallenged by  a  court  of  law.  The  committees  will  meet  at  least  four  times  a  month  during  the \nfirst 6 months of project implementation, and twice a month from the seventh month.  \n \nF. \n \n18. \nDMD  will  establish  a  monthly  monitoring  system  and  prepare  monthly  progress  reports \non all aspects of land acquisition, compensation payment,  provision of special assistance, and \nother resettlement activities. The reports will contain progress in the delivery of entitlements. The \ndeputed official-in-charge of land acquisition and resettlement at the PMU with the assistance of \nthe  social  development  and  resettlement  specialist,  through  IAs,  field  offices,  and  NGOs  will \nmonitor  the  progress  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  prepare  biannual  reports  and \nforward them to ADB for review. ADB review mission back-to-office reports will include progress \nwith resettlement plan implementation.  \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n\n\f82 \n\nAppendix 16 \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \n\nIntroduction \n\nA. \n \nThis  initial  environmental  examination  report  aims  to:  (i)  describe  the  Tsunami \n1. \nEmergency  Assistance  (Sector)  Project  (TEAP),  (ii)  describe  the  potential  environmental \nimpacts and corresponding mitigation measures, and (iii) explain the environmental assessment \nand  review  procedures  that  will  be  adopted  during  project  implementation.

It has a coastline of 1,076 km most of which is considered \n\n6. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f84 \n\nAppendix 16 \n\nrural  and  undeveloped.  The  state  can  be  broadly  divided  into  two  natural  regions:  the  coastal \nplains and the hilly western area. The major rivers are the Cauvery, Tamaraparani, and Vaigai, \nand  the  west  flowing  river  Periyar.  The  state  has  a  tropical  climate  with  temperatures  ranging \nfrom  28\u201340  \u00b0C  during  the  summer  and  18\u201326  \u00b0C  during  the  winter  months.  Average  annual \nrainfall is around 950 millimeters. \n \nKerala is a little less than 39,000 km2 in area and has a coastline of 590 km. The state \n10. \nhas a lush vegetative cover with large tracts of forest. Agriculture and forests together account \nfor 84% of the land area. Kerala lies to the west of the western Ghat mountains. As a result the \nstate  receives  considerable  rainfall  (especially  during  the  southwest  monsoon)  and  surface \nwater  discharge.  The  state  has  an  abundance  of  water  resources  with  over  40  rivers  flowing \nthrough it. It also has extensive mineral deposits and rich marine life. \n \n11. \nEcological  resources  in  the  coastal  areas  of  southern  India  have  been  subject  to \nconsiderable  degradation  and  depletion,  primarily  due  to  human-induced  pressures  on  the \nenvironment. Mangrove habitat have reportedly declined by 40% in the last century or so, and \nindigenous dry evergreen forests along the eastern coastal belt have been reduced to about 1% \nof the earlier recorded distribution.  \n \n\nHuman and Economic Development \n\n2. \n \n12. \nTamil Nadu has a population of over 62 million, of which 65% is rural. Population density \nstate-wide is around 480 persons per km2. The population growth rate by the early 1990s was \n2.14%, one of the lowest rates among all the states. Tamil Nadu ranks among the highest of all \nstates  in  terms  of  human  development  indices.  Literacy  is  73%,  second  only  to  Kerala.  Infant \nmortality has reduced drastically over the years and stood at 484 by 1999.  \n \n13. \nAgriculture  is  the  mainstay  of  the  economy;  however,  agriculture  as  a  share  of  the  net \ndomestic product of the state has been in decline. Tamil Nadu is one of the most industrialized \nstates in India. In terms of the contribution of manufactured goods to the net domestic product, \nTamil Nadu ranks second among all states. The overall growth rate of the state averaged 6.3% \nper annum during the 1990s. Per capita income of the state is among the top four of all states. \n \n14. \nKerala in one of the most densely populated states of India. The population is over 29 \nmillion, and density is around 750 person per km2. Most of the population is concentrated in the \ncoastal  areas,  with  some  human  settlements  located  within  20  meters  of  the  high  tide  line. \nAround  26%  live  in  urban  areas.  However,  the  population  growth  rate  of  Kerala  is  the  lowest \namong  all  states.  Kerala  leads  the  country  in  terms  of  human  development  indices,  with  a \nliteracy rate of 91% and infant mortality of 10.  \n \nAgriculture currently contributes about 13% to the state\u2019s overall income; however, this \n15. \npercentage  has  been  declining.  Overall  economic  growth  through  the  1990s  was  5.7%. \nEconomic activity in the project areas is concentrated in fisheries, agriculture, microenterprises, \nand coastal tourism. Kerala contributes the second largest share of the overall fish production of \nIndia. All of these sectors were badly affected by the tsunami.  \n\n                                                 \n4   Per thousand live births. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 16 \n\n85 \n\nGiven \n\nthe  sector-like  nature  of \n\nPotential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n \nD. \n \n16. \nThe  TEAP  primarily  aims  to  rehabilitate  and  reconstruct  infrastructure  damaged  or \ndestroyed  by  the  tsunami  and  to  restore  livelihoods  of  affected  people.  The  negative \nenvironmental impacts of rehabilitation and reconstruction activities will be largely limited to the \nconstruction phase. Given the scale of individual subprojects, these impacts are not likely to be \nsignificant.  The  infrastructure  facilities  upgraded  by  the  TEAP  will  result  in  certain  positive \nenvironmental impacts. In terms of expansion or new construction activities, the TEAP includes \n(i) consolidation and improvement of existing water supply schemes5 and development of new \nintake  sources  and  (ii)  construction  of  new  bridges  along  selected  evacuation  routes.  Siting, \ndesign,  and  construction  of  these  new  structures  will  be  done  with  due  consideration  of  the \nenvironmental  impacts.  Potential  environmental  concerns  and  benefits  of  the  subprojects  are \nsummarized in Table A16.  \n \n17. \nthe  TEAP,  detailed  subproject  environmental \nassessments  can  be  conducted  only  during  implementation.  Therefore  an  environmental \nassessment  and  review  procedure  framework  was  prepared  to  outline  specific  environmental \nassessment and monitoring procedures that will be adopted when preparing and implementing \nsubprojects.  \n \nE. \n \n18. \nThe  primary  legislation  governing  environmental  assessment  of  projects  in  India  is  the \nEnvironment (Protection) Act (No. 29 of 1986) and rules and notifications issued there under.6 \nOther  legislation  governs  the  protection  of  natural  resources  and  clearance  requirements  on \nprojects  and  activities  that  have  a  bearing  on  such  resources.  These  pieces  of  legislation \ninclude  the  Water  (Prevention  and  Control  of  Pollution)  Cess  (Amendment)  Act  (No.  19  of \n2003), the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act (No. 14 of 1981), the Wildlife (Protection) \nAmendment  Act  (No.  16  of  2003),  the  Forest  (Conservation)  Act  (amended  in  1988),  and  the \nBiological Diversity Act (No. 18 of 2003). These and overriding policies are available on the web \nsite of the Ministry of Environment and Forests of the Government of India.7  \n \n19. \nThe  Environment  (Protection)  Act  has  several  notifications  pertaining  to  clearance  of \nprojects and activities. The notification on Environmental Clearance\u2014General8 stipulates criteria \nfor projects and activities that require clearance by the Ministry of Environment and Forests of \nthe  Government,  based  on  duly  prepared  environmental  impact  assessments,  and  related \nprocedures.  The  Coastal  Regulations  Zone  (CRZ)  notification,9  governs  the  authorization  for \ndevelopment activities within the zone.10 Within each state the CRZ  is  further  demarcated  into  \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring \n\n                                                 \n5  Consolidated schemes would have around 25,000 connections.  \n6  The publication: Central Pollution Control Board. 2001. Pollution Control Acts, Rules and Notifications Issued There \nUnder.  Delhi.  (September)  contains  a  compendium  of  all  legislation  that  governs  environmental  and  related \nclearance procedures. \n7  See www.envfor.nic.in \n8  Of 27 January 1994. \n9  Of 19 February 1991 and subsequent amendments. \n10 Defined as the \u2018coastal stretches of seas, bays, estuaries, creeks, rivers, and backwaters influenced by tidal action \n(in the landward side) up to 500 meters from the high tide line and the land between the low tide line and the high \ntide line. \n\n \n\n\f86 \n\nAppendix 16 \n\nEnvironmental Assessment and Review Procedures \n\nthree  categories.11  Authorization  for  approval  of  development  activities  within  the  zone  is \ndelegated  to  the  respective  state  coastal  zone  management  authorities  (CZMA).  Projects  or \nactivities  that  are  exempted  from  clearance  under  the  above-mentioned  notifications  may  still \nrequire some form of clearance under provisions of these acts or related notifications. \n \n20. \nEnforcement of the above legislations and notifications vary by state. Provisions of the \nCRZ  notification  are  enforced  by  the  Department  of  Environment  in  Tamil  Nadu  and  by  the \nDepartment  of  Science,  Technology,  and  Environment  in  Kerala.  Interpretation  of  permissible \nactivities in the different zones (i.e., CRZ I through III) and procedures for obtaining clearances \nalso vary by state. Provisions under other legislation are enforced by a range of agencies. State \npollution  control  boards  are  vested  with  powers  to  implement  certain  provisions  of  different \nlegislation.  State  departments  of  forests  and  wildlife  each  have  responsibility  for  enforcing \nprovisions of several acts mentioned above.  \n \n21. \nBy virtue of the nature of destruction caused by the tsunami, the TEAP will target coastal \ninfrastructure. Hence, some subproject activities will invariably fall within the CRZ. The range of \nlegislation,  notifications,  and  complex  of  institutions  vested  with  enforcement  authority,  as \ndescribed,  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the  relevant  clearances  and  approvals  required  of \nsubprojects will vary from case to case.  \n \nF. \n \n22. \nThe TEAP is considered sector-like in that detailed subproject designs will be developed \nduring  implementation.  Consequently,  the  specific  environmental  impacts  of  subprojects  will \nalso  be  evident  only  at  that  stage.  In  such  sector-like  projects,  greater  emphasis  is  placed  on \nestablishing  suitable  environmental  assessment  procedures  that  would  be  adopted  during \nimplementation.  Accordingly,  an  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedure  framework \nwas  prepared  (Supplementary  Appendix  D)  to  outline  specific  environmental  assessment  and \nmonitoring  procedures  that  must  be  adopted  when  preparing  and  implementing  subprojects. \nThe  framework  also  highlights  the  requirement  to  obtain  clearances  and  approvals  under \nrelevant statutory regulations. A summary of the procedures follows. \n \nInitial  proposals  for  subprojects  will  be  generated  by  the  project  implementation  units \n23. \n(PIUs) of the respective ministries and line departments serving as implementing agencies (IAs) \nof  the  TEAP.  The  consultant  environmental  specialist  attached  to  the  design  and  supervision \nconsultants unit will help the PIUs prepare rapid environmental assessments of each subproject. \nThe  rapid  assessment  takes  the  form  of  a  checklist  and  will  be  prepared  in  consultation  with \nlocal  community  members.  Based  on  the  findings  of  the  rapid  assessment,  the  consultant \nenvironment specialist will recommend if further environmental assessment of the subproject is \nconsidered  necessary.  The  rapid  environmental  assessment  will  also  be  the  basis  for  the \nconsultant  environment  specialist  to  point  out  the  relevant  approvals  and  clearances  required \nunder  various  statutory  regulations.  The  decision  on  further  environmental  assessment  of  a \nparticular subproject will be taken in consultation with the project management unit (PMU) and \nthe  ADB  extended  mission.  Further \nthe  environmental  safeguard  officer  attached \n\nto \n\n                                                 \n11 Coastal  Regulations  Zone  I  (i)  is  ecologically  sensitive  or  important  areas  such  as  wildlife  sanctuaries,  national \nparks, government forests, mangroves, coral reefs, breeding and spawning grounds of fish, and sites of historical \nimportance  and  (ii)  includes  areas  between  the  low  tide  line  and  the  high  tide  line.  Zone  II  are  areas  that  are \nalready  developed  up  to  or  close  to  the  shoreline,  such  as  major  coastal  settlements,  ports,  and  other  large \ninfrastructure.  Zone III comprises areas that are less developed than zone II  areas or undeveloped but  which do \nnot  merit  being  classified  as  zone  I.  Zone  IV  covers  the  coastal  stretches  of  the  Andaman  and  Nicobar  Islands, \nLakshwadeep Islands, and some other islands except those already classified as zone I, II, or III.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 16 \n\n87 \n\nimpact  assessment  (EIA).  As  an  added  precaution, \n\nenvironmental assessment will, in most cases, imply an initial environmental examination (IEE), \nwhich  the  consultant  environmental  specialist  will  undertake.  Although  not  considered  likely \ngiven  the  nature  of  subprojects  considered  under  the  Project,  the  rapid  assessment  could \nhighlight significant environmental impacts associated with a subproject, sufficient to warrant an \nthe  environmental \nenvironmental \nassessment  and  review  procedure  framework  covers  this  eventuality  and  specifies  the \ncorresponding procedures that must be followed. All detailed environmental assessments would \ninclude  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  to  guide  mitigation  and  monitoring  of  any \npossible negative environmental impacts.  \n \n24. \nIf the subproject requires certain clearances v\u00ecs-\u00e0-v\u00ecs statutory regulations, the PIU will \nbe  responsible  for  obtaining  such  clearances  prior  to  commencing  construction  work  on  the \nsubproject. In the case of subprojects for which further environmental assessments are deemed \nnecessary (i.e., IEE or EIA), the PIU would endorse the assessment and agree to implement the \ncorresponding  EMP.  Approval  of  the  IEE  or  EIA  report  would  be  obtained  from  the  relevant \ngovernment  agency  responsible  for  approving  environmental  assessments.  The  consultant \nenvironment specialist will help monitor implementation of the EMP.  \n \n25. \nThe environmental safeguard officer attached to the ADB extended missions will review \nthe  first  three  rapid  environmental  assessments  prepared  for  subprojects  in  each  sector. \nThereafter,  the  rapid  assessments  will  be  reviewed  randomly  to  ensure  compliance  with  the \nprocess. All detailed environment assessment reports will be cleared by ADB prior to subproject \napproval. If the subproject is considered to have environmental impacts warranting an EIA, the \nrequired public consultation (at least twice) and disclosure of summary EIA (120 days of public \nnotice through the ADB website) should be met as part of the approval process. \n \n26. \nIn  the  event  that  a  subproject  design  undergoes  changes  following  approval  of  the \nEIA/IEE and the new design has elements that impinge on the environmental impacts identified \nand addressed in the original EIA/IEE, or introduces new potential environmental  impacts, the \nEIA/IEE must be revised and be subject to reapproval, to address these new impacts.  \n \nG. \n \n27. \nConsultation and public disclosure of the TEAP were curtailed in view of the emergency \nprocessing  procedures  that  were  followed  for  project  preparation.  Nevertheless,  the  relevant \ngovernment agencies were involved in identifying the project scope, and selective consultation \nwith local community groups were carried out during field visits. Further consultations with local \ncommunity  groups  will  be  carried  out  as  appropriate  during  design  and  construction  of \nsubprojects.  These  requirements  are  explained  in  the  environmental  assessment  and  review \nprocedure framework.  \n \nH. \n \n28. \nOn  the  basis  of  this  description  of  the  TEAP,  the  potential  environmental  impacts, \npossible mitigation measures, and proposed environmental assessment and review procedures \nto  be  followed  during  implementation,  no  further  environmental  assessment  of  the  overall \nproject  is  considered  necessary  at  this  stage.  The  TEAP  is  not  likely  to  result  in  significant \nnegative environmental impacts and is likely to generate certain positive environmental impacts. \nThe TEAP is therefore classified as category B in terms of environmental impacts.  \n\nFindings, Recommendations, and Conclusions \n\nConsultations and Public Disclosure \n\n \n\n\f \nSector \n\nLivelihoods \n\nRoads and \nHighways \n\n
