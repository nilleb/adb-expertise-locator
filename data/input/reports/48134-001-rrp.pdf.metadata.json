The reform \npriorities  include  a  more  predictable  and  open  business  environment,  diversified  modalities  of \ninfrastructure  financing,  and  faster  and  more  transparent  public  procurement.  The  program \nreflects  the  government\u2019s  bottom-up  and  lessons-learned  approach  in  reform  design  and \nimplementation to ensure policy coherence among agencies and different tiers of government. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nIndonesia has a large investment requirement. Given the country\u2019s robust annual growth \nof  6.2%  during  2010\u20132013  and  the  increasing  magnitude  of  the  middle  class,  total  direct \ninvestments  grew  from  $23  billion,  or  3.2%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  in  2010  to  $41 \nbillion, or 4.7% of GDP, in 2013, with 75% of these investments from foreign sources.2 Surveys \nof  the  private  sector  entities  also  confirm  the  robust  attitude  toward  investment  in  Indonesia. \nInternationally, for the first time since 1992, Indonesia is considered one of the most promising \ncountries  to  do  business.3 The  potential  for  future  growth  in  local  markets,  low  labor  cost,  a \nsteady  supply  of  assemblers,  and  concentration  of  industry  contribute  to  the  private  sector\u2019s \npositive  view  of  investing  in  Indonesia.  However,  challenges  remain  in  unleashing  Indonesia\u2019s \ninvestment potential. \n \n4. \nIncreasing  investment  is  needed  for  Indonesia  to  achieve  its  long-term  growth \nobjectives, including becoming one of the world\u2019s 10 largest economies by 2025, as outlined in \nthe economic master plan.4 Attaining these objectives requires the gross investment ratio to rise \nabove Indonesia\u2019s average gross investment to GDP ratio of 26% achieved during 2002\u20132012. \nTo support achieving this higher investment ratio, the government, in 2012, introduced a long-\nterm general plan for direct investments that aims at accelerating domestic and foreign capital \ninvestments  and  promotes  more  sustainable  investments  that  are  inclusive. 5  Increased \nsustainable  investments will  be  achieved  through  improving  the  investment  climate,  promoting \nmore investments in lagging regions, promoting investments that have positive externalities on \nthe  environment,  developing  infrastructure,  and  providing  fiscal  incentives.  For  the  plan  to  be \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Direct  investments  refer  to  investments  in  machine,  equipment,  and  transportation.  The  data  source  for  direct \ninvestments  is  Indonesia  Investment  Coordinating  Board  or  BKPM  Compared  with  other  members  of  the \nAssociation  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations,  Indonesia  has  much  room  for  improvement in  foreign direct investment. \nDuring 2009\u20132012, net foreign direct investment inflows averaged 1.8% of GDP while during the same period, in \nThailand it was 2.6% of GDP, 3.2% in Malaysia, and 6.2% in Viet Nam. \n\n3  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation.  2013.

One  of  the \n5. \nbiggest  constraints  of  doing  business  in  Indonesia  is  inefficient  government  bureaucracy. 6 \nExcessive  bureaucracy  and  a  lack  of  coordination  have  undermined  the  country\u2019s  business \nenvironment.  As  such,  the  2014  World  Bank\u2019s  Doing  Business  ranks  Indonesia  at  120  out  of \n189 economies (behind Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Philippines).7 The biggest factor that \ncauses the low rank is the length period to start a new business \u2013 48 days.  \n \n6. \nThe  government\u2019s  lead  role  in  infrastructure  development  needs  to  be  reflected  in \ncommensurately  significant  infrastructure  investments.  In  this  context,  the  central  government \nincreased  public  infrastructure  investment  from  Rp26.0  trillion  (0.9%  of  GDP)  in  2005  to \nRp188.4 trillion (2.0% of GDP) in 2013, despite its limited fiscal space. However, this investment \nis  relatively  low  when  compared  with  Malaysia  (9.0%  of  GDP)  and  Thailand  (7.0%  of  GDP). \nPublic investments in infrastructure are also hampered by complex land acquisition processes. \nAlthough  the  land  acquisition  law  was  introduced  in  2012,  proper  implementation  of  the  law \nrequires better coordination and collaboration among central government agencies utilizing the \nland, provincial governments, and the National Land Agency (BPN). \n \n7. \nLocal governments increased their contribution to infrastructure investments from close \nto 0.4% of GDP in 2000 to 1.3% of GDP in 2013, reflecting the impact of fiscal decentralization, \nwhich  transferred  spending  assignments  and financing  to  local governments. In  effect,  65% of \ninfrastructure  investments  are  now  provided  by  local  governments,  up  from  20%  prior  to \ndecentralization. Most of the spending on infrastructure, however, is financed by transfers from \nthe  central  government.  To  promote  more  local  infrastructure  investments,  the  central \ngovernment  has  allowed  local  governments  to  tap  into  other  funding  sources  such  as  capital \nmarkets. However, progress has been slow due to local governments\u2019 creditworthiness, lack of \ncentral  government\u2019s  cofinancing  mechanisms,  and  unclear  responsibility  for  infrastructure \ninvestment by local governments. \n \nPrivate  investment  in  infrastructure  has  remained  low.  During  2008\u20132011,  the  average \n8. \nannual  private  sector  investment  in  infrastructure  remained  at  0.4%  of  GDP,  compared  to  the \n2.3%  that  occurred  during  1995\u20131997.  The  central  government  has  encouraged  the  private \nsector  to  invest  in  infrastructure  through  participation  in  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs). \nHowever, out of 31 PPPs financially closed during 2005\u20132012, only one project used the 2005 \nPPP  framework,  while  all  other  projects  used  other  relevant  sector  frameworks, 8  primarily \nbecause the  legal framework for  PPPs  has  remained fragmented. The PPP  program  has  also \nbeen  affected  by  ineffective  government  decision-making  mechanisms,  the  lack  of  a  central \nPPP  office  to  drive  the  overall  PPP  program  within  the  government,  and  limited  support  to \ngovernment  contracting  agencies  (GCAs)  throughout  the  project  cycle  (including  through \nengaging reputable transaction advisors to prepare projects for tender and investment).9 \n \nThe  complex  public  procurement  process  also  negatively  impacts  public  investments. \n9. \nLack of capacity and the weak institutional set-up in public procurement within both the central \n                                                \n6  World Economic Forum. 2013.

Jakarta. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fand  local  governments,  inadequate  alignment  with  budget  execution  policies,  and  frequent \nabuse of the objection and appeal process further contribute to the slow procurement process. \nThis  situation  leads  to  a  20%  underutilization  of  capital  expenditure  budgets  and  uneven \nspending during the year (approximately 50% of project disbursements are done during the last \n2 months of the year). \n \n10. \nLessons  from  past  Asian  Development  Bank  support.  The  design  of  the  program \ntakes  lessons  from  past  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  supports  in  infrastructure,  fiscal \ndecentralization,  investment  climate,  public  procurement,  and  connectivity. 10  The  extensive \ndialogue  between  the  Government  and  ADB  helped  in  ensuring  a  strong  ownership.  Some \naccomplishments  are  adoption  of  a  land  acquisition  law  in  2012,  establishment  of  regulatory \nframework  for  municipal  bonds,  adoption  of  the  PPP  framework  in  2005  and  the  subsequent \nestablishment of facilitating financing facilities, and the adoption of a legal framework for public \nprocurement. However, the performance of past ADB-supported reforms has been affected by \n(i) challenges in coordination among major central government agencies, (ii) delays in decision \nmaking  due  to  concerns  to  avoid  corruption  allegations,  (iii)  challenges  with  harmonizing  the \nfragmented  legal  frameworks,  (iv)  cumbersome  land  acquisition  systems,  (v)  weak  capacity  of \nlocal governments, and (vi) policy incoherence between the central and local governments. \n \n11. \nValue  addition  of  the  program.  Continuity  of  past  programs  supported  by  ADB  is  an \nimportant  element  in  the  program  design.  One  good  example  is  the  work  on  PPP.  The \nprogram\u2019s  focus  on  institutional  improvement  for  PPP  is  a  continuing  reform  agenda  under \nADB\u2019s infrastructure reform program (please see footnote 9). The program also aims to ensure \nstrong  ownership  also  happens  at  local  levels  by  pilot-testing  reforms  in  selected  local \ngovernment  before  adopting  them  nationally  and  to  include  local  governments  in  any  public\u2013\nprivate dialogue that address subsector- and region-specific problems. \n \n12. \nThe programmatic approach adopted for the program will allow the new administration\u2014\nbuilding  on  thrusts,  achievements,  and  lessons  from  past  reform  efforts\u2014to  chart  the  next \nphase  of  policy  reforms.  The  program  will  comprise  two  subprograms:  subprogram  1  is \nexpected  to  be  submitted  to  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors  for  consideration  on  or  before  30 \nSeptember 2014, with subprogram 2 expected to be submitted in September 2016. Subprogram \n1  targets  on  the  regulatory  and  strategic  frameworks  reforms  to  accelerate  public  and  private \ninvestments while subprogram 2 focuses on institutional capacity development for accelerating \ninvestments. The  program  also  reflects  discussions with multilateral  and bilateral  development \npartners, and leverages their ongoing and programmed support to the reform areas covered by \nthe program.11 \n \n\n                                                \n10 ADB. 2005.

The outcome will \nbe  private  and  public  sector  investments  increased.  This  outcome  will  be  achieved  through \nsupporting reforms presented in section C. \n \nC. \n \nThe  program  aims  to  (i)  create  a  more  predictable  and  open  business  environment  by \n14. \nattracting  more  foreign  and  domestic  investments  and  reducing  the  cost  of  doing  business,  \n(ii)  diversify  modalities  for  infrastructure  financing  by  piloting  new  public  sector  modalities  for \ninfrastructure  financing,  and  creating  a  conducive  environment  for  private  financing  of \ninfrastructure  projects,  and  (iii)  develop  faster  and  more  transparent  public  procurement  to \nincrease budget utilization. \n \n15. \nThe  policy  matrix  (Appendix  4)  covers  seven  key  reform  areas,  with  subprogram  1 \nconsisting of 21 policy measures and subprogram 2 consisting of 22 policy measures. All policy \nactions under subprogram 1 have been completed. \n \n\n1. \n\nOutput 1: More Predictable and Open Business Environment \n\n \n16. \nAttract  more  foreign  direct  investment  and  increase  domestic  investment.  To \nattract more foreign direct investment and increase domestic investments, the government has \nenacted  four  policy  reforms  to  further  ease  restrictions  for  foreign  investment,  simplify \nprocedures  for  foreign  investment,  expand  tax  allowance  for  investment,  and  increase \npredictability of fixed cost for investment. \n \n17. \nTo help ease foreign investment restrictions, the government has issued a new negative \ninvestment list that reduces the amount of closed and restricted industries from 276 to 220. The \nnew  list  also  brings  consistency  with  the  prevailing  sector  laws,  harmonizes  and  simplifies \nforeign  capital  ownership,  and  promotes  foreign  investments  in  PPP.  The key  improvement  of \nthe  new  list  is  that  it  enables  foreigners  to  own  up  to  49%  (from  0%)  of  land  transportation \nmanagement  and  operation  facilities,  and  up  to  95%  (from  49%)  of  seaports\u2019  management \nundertaken as a PPP. \n \n18. \nThe  Indonesian  Investment  Coordinating  Board  has  also  simplified  procedures  to  get \nbusiness  licenses  for  foreign  investors.  The  new  regulation  has  improved  consistency  in \nmethods, procedures, and timelines of assessment of applications and issuance of investment \nlicenses,  and  has  introduced  uniformity  for  the  issuance  of  licenses  at  the  central,  provincial, \nregional, and municipal investment licensing offices. \n \n19. \nTo  improve  the  quality  of  investments  and  to  incentivize  the  private  sector  to  invest  in \nless-developed  regions,  the  government  plans  to  provide  more  income  tax  incentives  to  the \nmanufacturing industry. The new regulation aims to expand the coverage of businesses eligible \nfor income tax benefits to promote investment outside of Java and increase the economic well-\nbeing  of  the  population  in  less-developed  regions.  Currently,  close  to  60%  of  private  sector \ninvestments  are  in  Java.  The  draft  government  regulation  was  approved  at  the  interministerial \nlevel and submitted to the President for signing and issuance. \n \n20. \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  the  new \ninvestment  lists  and  review  the  existing  regulatory  framework  for  direct  investments.  The \ngovernment  will  also improve the  public\u2013private  dialogue  mechanism  and  introduce guidelines \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\ffor income tax incentives to contribute to investment promotion. \n \n21. \nReduce  the  cost  of  doing  business.  The  government  has  accelerated  efforts  to \nimprove  aspects  of  the  business  environment  to  help  stabilize  the  economy.  To  improve  the \nease  of  doing  business,  the  government  announced  17  major  actions  in  October  2013. 12 \nSubprogram  1  focuses  on  reforms  related  to  the  reduction  of  red  tape  and  ease  of  access  to \nfinance.  The  red  tape-related  reforms  are  (i)  issuing  a  business  trading  license  and  company \nregistration  certificate  simultaneously  through  a one-stop  service  that  reduces  processing time \nto  3  days,  (ii)  streamlining  the  establishment  of  an  online  business  entity  by  reducing  the \nnumber of related procedures from four to one and improving the processing time from 16 days \nto  1  day,  (iii)  expediting  settlement  of  commercial  disputes  in  contract  enforcement,  \n(iv) expediting transfer of land rights to a maximum of 5 days post submission, and (v) initiating \nonline facilities for taxpayer registration and pilot testing of electronic invoicing for business-to-\nbusiness  value-added  tax  transactions.  To  improve  access  to  finance  for  small  and  medium-\nsized  enterprises,  the  government,  through  Bank  Indonesia,  permitted  the  establishment  of \nprivate credit information bureaus. \n \n22. \nUnder subprogram 2, the government will continue to implement, monitor, and evaluate \nthe ease of doing business reform. To ensure investment policy coherence between central and \nlocal governments, the central government will assist one provincial government in establishing \na one-stop service for investment licenses. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutput 2: Diversification of Modalities for Infrastructure Financing \n\n \nPilot new public sector modalities for infrastructure financing. The government has \n23. \ncontinued  focusing  on  addressing  its  infrastructure  deficit  by  facilitating  access  by  local \ngovernments to capital markets for infrastructure projects, motivating local governments to use \navailable budget resources on more infrastructure spending, and introducing new instruments to \nfinance infrastructure projects. \n \n24. \nThe government has issued a regulatory framework to support the local governments to \nissue subnational bonds. The regulations put in place strict fiscal conditions, such as total debt \nof no more than 75% of the previous year\u2019s local revenue and a debt service coverage ratio not \nexceeding 2.5. Further, the MOF requires local governments to set up a debt management unit \nbefore  issuing  a  bond.  To  help  diversify  modalities  and  support  the  local  implementation  of \nthese  measures,  the  MOF,  with  the  assistance  of  ADB,  is  building  the  capacity  of  local \ngovernments  to  strengthen  their  debt  management  and  to  conduct  due  diligence  for  the \nissuance  of  subnational  bonds  for  large  infrastructure  projects.  A  pilot  study  is  currently \nunderway  in  one large province,  which includes  assistance for  due diligence  covering  shadow \nrating  and  issuance,  a  review  of  the  financial  viability  of  the  underlying  project,  and  an \nassessment of the debt management capacity of the provincial government. \n \nThe  government  has  also  introduced  project-based  sukuk  (Islamic  bonds)  as  new \n25. \ninstruments  to  finance  national  infrastructure  projects  through  the  capital  market.  Total \noutstanding  project-based  sukuk  issuance  as  of  17  April  2014  was  close  to  Rp29  trillion. \nProject-based  sukuk  have  been  used  to  finance  two  national  infrastructure  projects  that  will \nimprove connectivity. The issuance of the sukuk also helps implementation because it requires \nthe Debt Management Office of the MOF to monitor project development. \n\n                                                \n12 There  are  eight  key  target  areas:  starting  a  business,  getting  electricity,  paying  taxes  and  insurance  premiums, \nenforcing  legal  contracts,  resolving  insolvency,  registering  property,  obtaining  construction  permits,  and  getting \ncredit. As of April 2014, 15 out of the 17 actions had been implemented by the government. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nThe  government  is  also  considering  introducing  a  new  financing  intermediary  to  fund \n26. \nbasic local infrastructure projects. The MOF currently provides a venue for local governments to \nfinance  their  local  infrastructure  projects  by  accessing  a  fund  that  is  managed  by  the \ngovernment  investment  agency.  However,  convoluted  processes  to  borrow  funds\u2014borrowing \nrequires  local  parliament  approval  and  much  higher  funding  costs  (Bank  Indonesia  prime  rate \nplus 250 basis points)\u2014allows only 12 out of 458 local governments to access the facility, with \ndisbursements  close  to  $156  million.  To  improve  local  government  infrastructure  financing  for \nbasic  infrastructure,  the  MOF\u2019s  institution  transformational  blueprint  establishes  a  regional \ninfrastructure development fund (RIDF) to cofinance local government infrastructure projects in \nline with public accounting standards and the public budget system. \n \n27. \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  continue  strengthening  the  capacity  of  local \ngovernments  in  debt  and  risk  management  by  upgrading  the  local  finance  courses  offered  by \nthe  MOF.  The  MOF  will  also  provide  adequate  resources  to  the  RIDF,  adopt  and  disclose  its \ninstitutional  and  operating  procedures,  and  conduct  an  awareness  campaign  on  the  RIDF \namong local governments. The MOF will also review the framework for the issuance of region-\nbased  project  sukuk,  and  conduct  an  awareness  campaign  on  region-based  project  sukuk \nfinancing among local governments. \n \n28. \nCreate a conducive environment for private financing of infrastructure projects. In \n2013\u20132014, the government  continued  to  improve the  enabling  environment for  PPPs  through \n(i) amending the 2005 PPP framework to allow for several extensions to financial close of PPP \nprojects (maximum of 1 year each);  (ii) adopting harmonized principles and procedures on the \nuse of state assets in PPP projects as part of a new government regulation on state or regional \nasset  management;  and  (iii)  initiating  consultations  on  the  draft  law  on  land  to  address  the \nunderground  and  overground  terms  of  land  use  and  ownership.  As  the  next  step  in  the \nimplementation  of  the  new  land  acquisition  framework,  BPN  established  a  dedicated  office  to \nlead  the  formulation  of  policies  on  land  acquisition,  determination  of  ownership  of  land  rights, \nand land valuation under infrastructure projects. \n \n29. \nThe  government  also  established  a  framework  for  accelerated  delivery  of  priority \ninfrastructure projects by (i) assigning an interagency committee with decision-making authority \nover  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  priority  infrastructure  projects;  (ii)  assigning  clear \nresponsibilities  to  the  National  Development  Planning  Agency,  the  Coordinating  Ministry  of \nEconomic Affairs, and the MOF in supporting GCAs with priority project delivery; and (iii) giving \nthe  MOF  the  mandate  to  set  up  a  project  development  fund  to  cover  the  cost  of  preparing \nfeasibility  studies  for  and  transaction  support  to  PPP  projects.  The  development  of  the  new \nframework was informed by lessons learned from the experience of the National Committee on \nAcceleration of Infrastructure Development.13  \n \n30.  Measures  were  also  taken  to  ensure  PPP  projects  arising  both  from  the  2005  PPP \nframework  and  sector  frameworks  are  rolled  out.  These  included  (i)  gaining  approval  by \nexpansion  of  the  scope  of  business  viability  guarantees  in  support  of  the  performance  of \nPerusahaan  Listrik  Negara  (Indonesia\u2019s  state-owned  electricity  company)  under  power \npurchase  agreements  with  independent  power  producers,  (ii)  regulating  ownership  of  assets \nunder  a  joint  operating  contract  of  a  geothermal  PPP  project,  (iii)  increasing  the  threshold  for \ndirect purchase of land from 1 to 5 hectares, and (iv) addressing the sources of funding for land \nacquisition  in  the  national  and  local  budgets.  One  critical  action  that  will  promote  PPP  is  the \n\n                                                \n13 Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Public\u2013Private  Partnerships  in  Infrastructure  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n\foperationalization of viability gap funding; two GCAs have submitted applications to the MOF for \nprovision of viability gap funding for their PPP projects. \n \n31. \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  continue  improving  the  PPP  framework \nthrough  the  introduction  of  availability-type  PPPs,  allowing  PPPs  in  social  sectors,  the  explicit \nrecognition  of  state-owned  enterprises  as  GCAs  and  qualifying  state-owned  enterprises\u2019 \nparticipation  in  PPPs  as  a  business  entity  to  mitigate  conflict  of  interest,  and  enabling  PPP \nprojects  with  existing  state  assets  to  avail  themselves  of  government  support  schemes.  The \ngovernment  will  also  complete  the  establishment  and  operationalization of the  PPP  unit  at  the \nMOF\u2014as a first step towards a separate central PPP office\u2014to lead the country\u2019s PPP program \nand  be  the  core  facilitator  in  the  preparation  of  bankable  PPP  infrastructure  projects.  As  a \nstrategic  issue  and reflecting  on  lessons  learned  in  subprogram  1,  the  government  will  initiate \nthe  preparation  of  an  integrated  framework  for  private  provision  of  public  infrastructure  and \nservices.  The  government  plans  to  develop  an  academic  paper  on  PPP  law  and  a  high-level \ninfrastructure-focused government mechanism to address cooperation and accountability issues \namong central and local governments. \n \n32. \nThe  government  will  also  continue  ensuring  smooth  processing  and  rollout  of  PPP \nprojects  through  budget  allocation  and  approval  of  viability  gap  funding,  and  it  will  continue \ncarrying  out  action-oriented  assessments  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  geothermal  fund  and \nbusiness  viability  guarantees  for  energy-generation  projects.  As  part  of  strengthening  the \ncapacity  of  BPN\u2019s  office  on  land  acquisition,  operational  manuals  on  the  land  acquisition \nprocess  will  be  developed  for  GCAs.  To  draw  initial  lessons  from  the  new  land  acquisition \nframework,  BPN  will  conduct  an  action-oriented assessment  of the  implementation  of  the  new \nland acquisition law. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput 3: Faster and More Transparent Public Procurement \n\n \nThe  government,  through  the  National  Public  Procurement  Agency  (NPPA),  has  taken \n33. \nsteps  to  increase  budget  utilization  through  automating  the  public  procurement  process \n(particularly for procuring goods and services in the eastern part of Indonesia, where access to \nvendors  is  limited),  and  enforcing  usage  of  e-catalogs  for  e-purchasing  to  expedite  the \nprocurement process and budget absorption. With ADB\u2019s TA, the NPPA is assisting one large \nlocal government to establish its own e-catalogs.14 \n \n34. \nIn  enhancing  procurement  capacity,  the  NPPA  is  working  with  29  procurement  service \nunits (PSUs) at the national and local government levels to be the subjects of a pilot study in an \neffort to professionalize PSUs. This pilot program will be replicated with other PSUs nationwide. \nThe NPPA has also initiated reforms in the procurement process for large, complex construction \ncontracts  through  the  finalization  of  a  draft  international  competitive  bidding  document  that  is \navailable  for  discussion  with  stakeholders.  In  coordination  with  the  MOF  and  the  National \nDevelopment  Planning  Agency,  the  NPPA  has  also  begun  preparing  standard  bidding \ndocuments for PPPs in the education and health sectors for pilot testing purposes. \n\n \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  adopt  a  new  public  procurement  framework \n35. \nthat  will  strengthen  the  function  of  PSUs,  institutionalize  e-procurement,  and  ensure  full \nsynchronization  with the  investment  selection process  under the  PPP framework. The  reforms \nwill  also  cover  the  introduction  of  a  benchmarking  system  for  (i)  assessing  the  capacity  of \nprocuring  entities  in  public  procurement,  and  (ii)  ensuring  adequate  budget  funding  for \n                                                \n14  ADB.  2008.

The economic slowdown in 2013 and the first quarter of 2014 caused the \ngovernment  to  reduce  the  2014  GDP  growth  target  from  5.8%\u20136.0%  to  5.5%,  resulting  in  the \nreduction of the estimated budget revenue from $145 billion to $139 billion, with the expenditure \nactually  having  increased  by  $600  million  in  the  revised  2014  budget.  This  caused  the  2014 \nfiscal  deficit  to  increase from  the  budgeted  1.7% to  2.5 %  of GDP, to  be financed through  the \nlarger government borrowing plan, which has increased from the originally planned $16 billion to \n$23  billion  in  the  revised  2014  budget.  In  light  of  this,  the  government  has  increased  the \ndevelopment policy share of its ODA borrowing from $339 million to $1.5 billion. The estimated \nadministrative  and  implementation  cost  of  reforms  under  subprogram  1  is  $493  million;15 the \nloss of budget revenues due to tax allowance reforms is estimated at $333 million.  \n \n37. \nGiven  the  increased  fiscal  space  constraints  and  budgeted  development  expenditure \nprograms,  the  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $400  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance subprogram  1. The  loan  will  have a 15-year  term,  including  a grace \nperiod  of  3  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on this, the average loan \nmaturity  is  9.25  years,  and  there  is  no  maturity  premium  payable  to  ADB.    The  financing  for \nsubprogram 2 is currently planned to be $200 million. The loan proceeds will be used to finance \nthe full exchange cost (excluding local taxes and duties) of items produced and procured in ADB \nmembers,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral \nsources.  The  proceeds  of  the  policy-based  loan  will  be  disbursed  to  Indonesia  in  accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  on  simplifying  disbursement  requirements  for  program  loans. 16 \nSubprogram  1  will  receive  parallel  cofinancing  of  $200  million  from  German  development \ncooperation through KfW.17  \n \nE. \n \nThe  Coordinating Ministry  of  Economic  Affairs  will  be  the  executing agency. The  MOF, \n38. \nIndonesia  Investment  Coordinating  Board  (BKPM),  BPN,  and \nthe \nimplementing agencies. The implementation of program policy actions will be monitored through \n(i)  a  steering committee  that  will  be  chaired  by  a  deputy minister  of the  executing  agency  and \nconsist of director-level officials of  implementing agencies and relevant local governments that \nare  affected  by  the  program,  and  (ii)  regular  meetings  of  technical  working  groups  set  up  for \neach  output  or  sub-output,  as  the  case  may  be,  to  discuss  interim  progress  in  the  reform \nagenda. These working groups will consist of echelon two of the implementing agencies and will \noperationalize  the  program\u2019s  approach  on  establishing  an  effective  dialogue  between  national \nand  local  governments  and  the  business  community.  The  implementation  period  is  January \n2013\u2013September 2014 for subprogram 1, and October 2014\u2013September 2016 for subprogram 2, \nreflecting  the  government\u2019s  phasing  of  investment  reforms.

Currently,  with  exports  still  slow  to  recover,  investment  will  need  to  play  a \nlarger role in supporting growth. The proposed reforms are expected to stimulate more  foreign \ndirect investment, encourage more businesses to open, and increase infrastructure investment, \nwhich could generate additional economic growth of up to 1 percentage point annually over the \nmedium  term. 18 The  proposed  reforms  will  also  help  improve  the  quality  of  employment  by \nincreasing employment opportunities in the formal sector, and reduce poverty in lagging regions, \ne.g., Eastern Indonesia, where poverty incidence is much higher. Improved connectivity will also \nlead  to  improvement  in  access  to  and  delivery  of  services  in  Eastern  Indonesia.  Combined, \nthese will help reduce inequality over the medium term. \n \nB. \n \n40. \nThe government has made considerable progress in improving the legal and regulatory \nframework for public financial management. Since the enactment of laws on state finance, state \ntreasury,  and state  audit  in 2003\u20132004, most  of the  regulations  underpinning these  laws  have \nbeen promulgated. In 2012, the number of government agencies that received unqualified audit \nopinion  from  the  external  audit  agency  increased  to  65%,  from  about  40%  in  2009.  ADB  has \nreinforced  this  momentum  with  continuing  support  to  improve  technical  capacity  and  controls. \nBuilding  on  previous  programs,  ADB\u2019s  TA  to  strengthen  public  procurement  has  been \ncommitted to boosting transparency and efficiency in public procurement processes. As a result \nof the government\u2019s continuing commitment to reduce corruption, the capacity of the Corruption \nEradication  Commission  has  improved  markedly.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \nC. \n \nThe  reforms  supported  under  the  program  are  likely  to  reduce  poverty  through \n41. \nimprovements  in  the  investment  climate  and  improved  infrastructure.  A  more  conducive \ninvestment climate will lead to more and better investment that would generate more productive \njobs, which are keys to inclusive growth. Better infrastructure will contribute to poverty reduction \nthrough  higher  growth  caused  by  increased  infrastructure  investments.  For  example,  if  the \ninfrastructure  stock  had  grown  during  2001\u20132011  by  10%  per  year  instead  of  the  actual  3%, \nGDP could have grown by 7.0% per  year rather than the actual 5.3%. This in turn could have \nreduced the national poverty rate to 6.9% in 2011 instead of the actual 11.4%.19 Another poverty \nimpact relates to facilitation of PPPs in the health and education sectors likely to positively affect \nnon-income  poverty  through  improved  access  and  use  of  education  and  health  facilities.
