The report also describes \n(i) the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction; \nand (ii) the proposed administration of the technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the Urban \nClimate  Change  Resilience  Trust  Fund 1  under  the  Urban  Financing  Partnership  Facility  for \nStrengthening  Smart  Water  Management  and  Climate  and  Disaster  Resilience  in  Selected \nDistricts of West Bengal, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grant and the TA. \n \n2. \nThe project will provide safe, sustainable, and inclusive drinking water services as per the \nstandards set by the Government of India to about 1.65 million people in the arsenic, fluoride, and \nsalinity-affected selected areas of Bankura, North 24 Parganas, and Purba Medinipur districts of \nWest  Bengal  (project  districts). 2  It  will  introduce  an  innovative  institutional  framework  and \nadvanced technology for smart water management (STWM) to enable efficient service delivery in \nthe project districts.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nHigh  arsenic and fluoride  levels  in  drinking water  threaten  public health in India. \nAccording to a study conducted by the World Bank in 2010, 85% of all rural water supply schemes \nin India rely on groundwater.4 One of the greatest public health threats in India is from naturally \nelevated  levels  of  arsenic  and  fluoride  in  groundwater.  The  Ministry  of  Drinking  Water  and \nSanitation of the Government of India estimated that around 27 million people in India are at risk \nfrom  arsenic  and fluoride contamination.5 Drinking water  with high concentrations  of  arsenic  in \nthe long term can lead to a range of health problems in humans, including cancer, while chronic \nexposure  to  fluoride  may  cause  dental  or  skeletal  fluorosis  and  bone  diseases  caused  by \nexcessive accumulation of fluoride in the bones. \n \n4. \nWest Bengal faces many challenges to its rural drinking water security. West Bengal, \nthe fourth most populous state in India, is by far the worst impacted, hosting around 72% of India\u2019s \ntotal population at risk from arsenic and 5% of the population at risk from fluoride contamination. \nOnly  about  47%  of  West  Bengal\u2019s  rural  population  of  74.6  million  has  piped  water  supply, \ncompared to the national average of 56%, and piped water supply is through public standposts, \ngenerally at fewer than 40 liters per capita per day (lpcd).6 Government of West Bengal (GOWB) \nestimates that about 91% of West Bengal\u2019s rural population and 41% of its urban population still \nrely on its groundwater reserves for drinking, despite being located alongside two of the largest \n\n                                                \n1  Financing partners: the Rockefeller Foundation and the governments of Switzerland and the United Kingdom.  \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. One neighboring block in South 24 Parganas district, Bhangur \n\nII, was included in North 24 Parganas\u2019 drinking water scheme based on need and economy of scale. \n\n3  ADB  supported  project  preparations  mainly  through  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  State-Level \n\nSupport for National Flagship Programs (TA 9022-IND).  \n\n4  World  Bank.  2010.  Deep  Wells  and  Prudence:  Towards  Pragmatic  Action  for  Addressing  Groundwater  Over-\n\n5  Government of India, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation. Integrated Management Information System (IMIS). \n\nexploitation in India. Washington, DC. \n\nData valid as of 17 May 2018. \n\n6  Government of West Bengal (GOWB), Public Health Engineering Department, Data from Integrated Management \nInformation System (IMIS). Data valid as of 17 May 2018. In 2013, the GOWB revised its standards for rural piped \nwater supply to 70 lpcd from 40 lpcd. \n\n \n\n\frivers in India, the Ganges and Brahmaputra (footnote 6). The excessive reliance on groundwater \nis aggravating exposure to arsenic and fluoride in drinking water, as well as the effects of climate \nchange. Further, increased withdrawal of groundwater along the state\u2019s coastal belt is resulting in \nintrusion of salinity in groundwater. Five of the state\u2019s 23 districts are affected by salinity, Purba \nMedinipur being the most impacted. The supply systems are also vulnerable to climate change \nand disaster risks, especially regular flooding.7 \n \n5. \nGovernment\u2019s  sector  strategy.  The  GOWB,  through  its  Vision  2020,  and  the \nGovernment of India, through its National Sub-mission on Arsenic and Fluoride, are prioritizing \nand investing in shifting people from reliance on groundwater through hand pumps or tube wells \nto sustainable surface water-based piped schemes.8 The British Geological Survey, which was \nengaged by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), conducted a detailed analysis of arsenic and \nfluoride in drinking water in West Bengal in 2017, including their characteristics, implications, and \nmitigation, as well as lessons learned from elsewhere. The study confirmed that piped water from \nsurface  sources  offers  greater  certainty  in  water  quality  security  in  the  long  term  over  in  situ \ngroundwater treatment practices for arsenic or fluoride.9 \n \n6. \nFindings from the sector assessment. The sector assessment shows that throughout \nIndia, sustainability of drinking water services has remained a major challenge despite achieving \ngood  asset  coverage,  mainly  because  of  weak  institutional  arrangements,  limited  community \nparticipation,  and  inadequate  financing  of  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M). 10  Though  the \ngovernment has launched various policy reforms and programs to decentralize service delivery, \nmost  states  are struggling  to  set the right  institutional framework to match,  and  increase,  their \nlocal  bodies\u2019  capacities  to  manage  services.11 In  West  Bengal,  the  Public  Health  Engineering \nDepartment  (PHED)  manages  water  supply  to  rural  areas  and  to  80  of  the  state\u2019s  114 \nmunicipalities.  It  also  provides  bulk  water  to  many  urban  agglomerations  and  municipal \ncorporations.  In  all  rural  areas,  the  PHED  supplies  water  through  public  standposts,  without \nhousehold connections. A survey commissioned by PHED in Baduria district of West Bengal in \n2016 showed that such public standpost-based schemes may not result in desired health impacts \nsince  people  may  continue  drinking  from  contaminated  on-premises  sources,  such  as  hand \npumps  or  wells.  Further,  because  of  lack  of  funds  and  an  integrated  approach  to  planning, \nschemes are generally designed for smaller block-level habitations rather than spatially for a basin \nor a district, resulting in suboptimal use of water resources and loss of economies of scale. In \nNorth 24 Parganas district alone, the PHED manages 211 individual drinking water schemes. \n \n7. \nLessons learned. Lessons learned from ADB water projects in India and elsewhere show \nthat  sustainability  of  assets  and  services  created  under  projects  are  dependent  on  adequate \ninstitutional and operational capacity of local bodies to manage them, and establishment of clear \n\n                                                \n7  Around 42% of West Bengal\u2019s land area is flood prone.     \n8  Government  of  West  Bengal,  Public  Health  Engineering  Department.  2011.

The  inclusion  of  women  is \nnecessary  for  ensuring  responsive  service  delivery.  The  GOWB  is  currently  implementing \nintensive  rural  sanitation  improvement  programs  across  the  state.  A  sanitation  improvement \naction  plan  was  developed  for  the  project  to  address  identified  gaps  to  ensure  sustainable \nsanitation improvement in the project areas.13 ADB conducted a detailed capacity assessment of \nall  66  project  gram  panchayats  based  on  their  sociodemographic,  financial,  and  operational \nresources, and ranked them to assist in their capacity building during the project implementation.14 \n \n8. \nGovernment\u2019s sector reforms under the project and synergy with ADB\u2019s strategies \nand  policies.  As  a  result  of  policy  dialogue  during  project  preparations,  the  GOWB  issued  a \ngovernment  order  on  9  November  2017  to  all  66  project  gram  panchayats,  with  populations \nranging  from  16,000  to  26,000,  on  the  asset  management  and  service  delivery  framework \n(AMSDF),  which  (i)  clearly  defined  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  PHED,  the  gram \npanchayats,  panchayat  samitis,  and  zilla  parishads;  and  (ii)  set  guidelines  for  operational \nsustainability parameters such as metering, tariff, and human resourcing.15 The project, which is \nincluded  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan  for  India,  2018\u20132020,  will  contribute  to \nSustainable  Development  Goals  5,  6,  and  13,  and  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy, 2018\u20132022 for India, and ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan.16 \n \n9. \nThe  project\u2019s  transformative  and  innovative  features  and  value  addition.  By \nincorporating the following features the project is expected to create an exemplary model for rural \ndrinking water services in West Bengal and in India: (i) through efficient use of surface water, the \nproject will preserve groundwater, enhance climate resilience, and reduce the burden of disease \nfrom arsenic and fluoride; (ii) subprojects stem from district-wide comprehensive drinking water \nquality  action  plans  that  analyze  and  integrate  drinking  water  sustainability  and  quality  needs. \nThese action plans will assist in guiding development and connect the existing and future systems \ninto a grid-based supply;17 (iii) the project will provide higher service levels compared with rural \nschemes  in  India  in  general,  with  individual  household  connections  and  district  metering  area \n(DMA) based metered continuous water supply;18 (iv) the project will use a high-technology-based \nSTWM system to efficiently manage water services, which will be a first for rural water schemes \nin  the  state  and  in  India;  (v)  the  project,  through  the  AMSDF,  will  cement  an  innovative  and \nsustainable institutional model for the sector; and (vi) the project will include women in service \ndelivery, and empower them through employment, leadership, and increased awareness. \n\n                                                \n12 Independent Evaluation Department. 2017.

The  project  will \nprovide a minimum of 70 lpcd of continuous potable water through metered connections to the \nhouseholds in selected areas of the project districts. The distribution systems will be designed on \na DMA basis. Both the bulk and the distribution systems will be integrated with modern STWM \nand  monitoring  tools,  including  supervisory  control  and  data  acquisition  and  geographic \ninformation systems.  Bulk  water  supply  systems,  consisting  of  intakes,  water treatment  plants, \nand transmission mains, will be sized to provide water supply en route to urban and rural areas. \nThey will be connected into a grid with the existing and the new systems in the project districts, \nwhere feasible, to reduce redundancy, improve resilience, and efficiently manage the system. \n \n13. \nOutput  2:  Institutions  and  capacity  of  stakeholders  for  drinking  water  service \ndelivery strengthened. The project will strengthen institutions and the capacity of stakeholders, \nincluding  the  PHED  and  the  project  gram  panchayats,  for  sustainable  service  delivery.  It  will \nsupport  them  to  operate  the  STWM  system,  including  water  quantity  and  quality  monitoring, \nelectronic billing and collections, meter reading, and accounting.20 The project will build capacities \nand skills of the stakeholders on O&M, and support public awareness on water, sanitation, and \nhygiene.

It will assist in (i) implementing a \ncentral-level  STWM  system  within  the  PHED;  (ii)  improving  a  flood-related  early  warning  and \nresponse system in Purba Medinipur; and (iii) building capacity of stakeholders on O&M, climate \nchange, and disaster resilience. The TA is estimated to cost $2 million, which will be financed on \na grant basis by the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund (footnote 1) under the Urban \nFinancing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB.26 The PHED will be the executing and \nimplementing agency for the TA, to be implemented over 3 years. The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of staff, office space, and other in-kind contributions. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nA. \n \n23. \nThe  project  is  climate  resilient  and  compatible  with local  capacity. The  PHED  engaged \ndesign consultants,  supported  by  a large team of  ADB  grant-funded  consultants,  to undertake \nsurveys and project preparation, including evaluation of alternative techno-economic options and \nfull life cycle costs. ADB conducted a detailed climate risk and vulnerability assessment to ensure \nproject  components  incorporate  necessary  climate  resilience  and  mitigation  measures  in  the \npreliminary,  detailed  design,  and  implementation  stages. 27  The  project  will  be  sustainable \noperationally  by  incorporating  the following  approaches: (i)  ensuring that bulk supply  schemes \nremain with the PHED, (ii) building a 2-year O&M period into the contracts for both the bulk and \ndistribution schemes to assist in capacity building, and (iii) implementing an AMSDF and including \nextensive capacity building of stakeholders through support from the attached grant and TA. \n \nB. \n \n24. \nEconomic analysis. The economic rationale for the government\u2019s intervention is sound, \nas the project will provide sustainable drinking water services in the project gram panchayats. The \neconomic  analysis  was  conducted  for  the  three  sample  project  gram  panchayats  for  which \nengineering designs were finalized: Chaltaberia, Kashbalanda, and Sonapukur Sankarpur. The \nestimated  economic  internal  rates  of  return  of  these  gram  panchayats  ranged  from  13.0%  to \n14.2%, while the combined economic internal rate of return was estimated at 13.5%, higher than \nthe  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  estimated  at  9.0%,  indicating  significant  economic \nreturns. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the results are satisfactory, except under the scenario \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                \n26 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Summary Project Climate and Disaster Risk Assessment and Management Report (accessible from the list of linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nGovernance \n\nof all downside risks occurring together, i.e., (i) capital cost overrun of 20%, (ii) overrun in O&M \ncosts of 20%, (iii) decline in estimated benefits of 20%, and (iv) 1-year delay in implementation.28 \n \n25. \nFinancial  analysis.  Financial  analysis  was  conducted  for  the  project  to  ascertain  its \nsustainability  and to  determine  the  extent  to  which  the  water  supply  will  generate  revenues  to \ncover O&M costs. An incremental recurrent costs analysis was conducted for the three sample \ngram  panchayats,  as  the  proposed  water tariffs are  expected  to  recover  O&M  costs  only. The \nanalysis concluded that the suggested tariff under the AMSDF would generate sufficient revenues \nfor O&M cost recovery. A cash flow analysis was conducted in case unforeseen circumstances \nconstrain  tariff  revision  or  recovery.  The  financial  projections  of  the  sample  gram  panchayats \nshow that their revenue account will remain in surplus with (i) improved collection efficiency, (ii) \nan  STWM  system  and  financial  management,  and  (iii)  continued  financial  support  from  the \ngovernment. Implementation of an AMSDF will help them improve financial sustainability. \n \nC. \n \nThe financial management assessment concluded that the PHED can conduct adequate \n26. \nfinancial management of the project.29 The PHED has experience in handling large-scale projects \nfunded  by  GOWB  and  with  external  support.  It  has  an  established  legal,  institutional,  and \nmonitoring framework available for budgeting, accounting, and auditing. Based on these factors, \nthe  financial  management  risk  for  the  project  is  moderate.  The  project  design  includes  the \nfollowing  risk  mitigation  measures:  (i)  building  PHED\u2019s  capacity  on  ADB\u2019s  project  financial \nmanagement requirements, (ii) strengthening the PHED\u2019s project account and finance divisions \nby engaging qualified staff and consultants, (iii) strengthening the PHED\u2019s internal audit process, \nand (iv) implementing water user charge structure and its regular revisions under the AMSDF. \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the governments of India and West Bengal and the PHED. Specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  PAM.  The  mitigation  measures  in  the  project \ndesign (i) establish regular voluntary disclosure of project-related information to residents, (ii) use \nand maintain an e-procurement system to enhance transparency, and (iii) establish a grievance \nredress mechanism to ensure a quick and effective complaints resolution. \n \nD. \n \n28. \nPoverty  and  social.  The  project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  improving \ninfrastructure and quality of life, reducing women\u2019s drudgery, reducing health morbidity and health \nimpacts of arsenic and fluoride contamination, and stimulating economic growth. The project will \nprovide free water supply connections to the households in the project area, including the poor \nand vulnerable. Based on the affordability and willingness-to-pay survey carried out by the project \npreparatory team in the sample gram panchayats, user charges will be affordable (at less than \n2.5% of the mean monthly household income) and within the household\u2019s willingness to pay.30 \n \n29. \nGender.  The  project  is  classified  as  gender  equity.  The  gender  equality  and  social \ninclusion action plan for the project has clear targets, responsibilities, and resource allocation.31 \nThe project will generate employment for over 350 locals in the project gram panchayats, of whom \n                                                \n28 Economic Analysis and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Action Plan and Gender Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nin Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\n33% will be women. It will provide continuous potable water through metered connections to about \n390,000  households. This  will  reduce  drudgery  of  women  and girls  and time  poverty,  and free \ntime  for  more  productive  work,  including  attending  schools.  Trade-certified  trainings  on  utility \nmanagement will enhance local women\u2019s employability. The PHED will conduct a gender audit \nand  develop  and  adopt a gender strategy. The project  will  institutionalize  a gender-responsive \npolicy framework for drinking water service delivery in West Bengal through the AMSDF. \n \nE. \n \n30. \ncategories are as follows.32 \n \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  PHED  prepared  an  environmental  assessment  and \n31. \nreview framework in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and applicable laws to guide the \nscreening  and  environmental  assessment  of  the  subprojects.  Three  draft  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE) reports prepared for the sample subprojects show that they are not likely to \ncause significant adverse environmental impacts, and that any impacts during construction and \nO&M  can  be  mitigated  through  appropriate  design  and  good  practices. 33 The  project  will  not \ninclude category A subprojects. The PHED conducted public consultation during the preparation \nof  the  sample  subprojects  and  will  continue  consultation  throughout  project  implementation. \nEnvironmental,  social,  and  resettlement-related  grievances  will  be  handled  following  the \ngrievance redress mechanism for the project, detailed in the PAM. All IEEs will form part of the \nbid and contract documents. All draft IEEs prepared will be updated during detailed engineering \ndesign  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  disclosure.  The  PHED  will  prepare  and  submit \nsemiannual environmental monitoring reports for ADB review and disclosure. \n \n32. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). The PHED prepared a resettlement framework \nin line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and applicable laws to guide subproject screening \nand assess  resettlement  impacts. Subprojects  with significant  involuntary  resettlement  impacts \nwill not be eligible for funding. Based on three sample subprojects\u2019 draft resettlement plans and \none due diligence report, the project will not cause significant involuntary resettlement impacts. 34 \nThe  draft  resettlement  plans  will  form  part  of  bids  and  contract  documents,  be  updated  during \ndetailed  engineering  design,  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  disclosure.  The  PHED  will \nacquire  land  through  negotiated  settlement  without  recourse  to  expropriation  as  per  GOWB \nregulations.  Based  on  preliminary  designs,  around  7  acres  are  estimated  to  be  acquired  from \naround  42  private  owners.  The  PHED  will  prepare  semiannual  social  safeguards  monitoring \nreports for ADB\u2019s review and disclosure. The resettlement framework and resettlement plans have \nbeen disclosed to project-affected people, and on the ADB and PHED websites. \n \n33. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  B).  Indigenous  peoples  or  scheduled  tribes  comprise \n7.8%  of  the  rural  population  of West  Bengal  as  a  whole.  Based  on  three  sample  subprojects\u2019 \nappraised, scheduled tribes (i) will benefit from project investments as beneficiaries of improved \nwater supply facilities, free universal household connections, and capacity building and livelihood \nsupport  programs;  and  (ii)  are  not  considered  to  be  made  vulnerable  by  the  project.  PHED \nprepared  an  indigenous  peoples  planning  framework,  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \n                                                \n32  ADB.
