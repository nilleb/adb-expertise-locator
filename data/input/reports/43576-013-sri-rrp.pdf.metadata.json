The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Capacity Building for \nClean Power Development, and if the Board approves the proposed loans and administration of \nthe grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \nThe  project 2  includes  three  components:  (i)  transmission  infrastructure;  (ii)  network \n2. \nefficiency  improvements;  and  (iii)  pilot  solar  rooftop  power  generation  investments  in  the \nEastern, North Central, Central, Northern, Southern, and Western provinces of the country.3  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nSri Lanka has achieved a substantial improvement in the energy sector, with a national \nelectrification ratio of 91% in 2011 compared with 29% in 1990. The longer-term challenge for \nthe country is to reduce its high dependence on expensive fossil fuel energy. The energy sector \nstruggles to meet growing demand for electricity at sufficiently low cost and acceptable reliability \nlevels.4 The  share  of  thermal  energy  in  the  power  generation  mix  has  increased  from  6%  in \n1995  to  54%  in  2011.  Demand  growth  has  been  generally  met  by  expensive  oil-fired  thermal \ngeneration, which is not the solution to the country\u2019s energy security and environment protection \nin  the  long  term.  Diversification  of  the  generation  mix\u2014including  from  renewable  energy \nsources,  improvement  of  network  efficiency,  and  supply  and  demand  side  management\u2014can \nhelp  to  address  this  issue.  To  enable  future  planned  power  supply  increases,  meet  growing \ndemand in the regions, and integrate renewable energy sources into the grid, it is necessary to \nstrengthen  the  transmission  network,  especially  in  conflict-affected  areas  of  the  Northern  and \nEastern  provinces. 5 Another  challenge  is  to  improve  system  reliability  and  reduce  technical \nlosses.  An  enhanced  33  kilovolt  (kV)  medium  voltage  network  is  needed  to  expand  power \nsupply in rural areas, where many poor households remain unconnected or have poor quality of \nelectricity  supplies.  The  new  infrastructure  will  also  support  development  of  clean  energy. \nImprovement of transmission and distribution infrastructure will address electricity needs in the \npost-conflict  areas  and  directly  contribute  to  their  development.6 The  government  intends  to \n\n                                                 \n1   Administered by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).

Manila (TA 7837-SRI, for $1 million, approved on 20 July 2012, and \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \u2500 [TASF-IV]).  \n\n3   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n4   The  problem  tree  analysis  is  in  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Energy  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n5   The  current  electrification  rate  in  the  Northern  province  is  estimated  at  80%;  Mannar  district,  where  project \nactivities  will  be  undertaken,  has  an  electrification  rate  of  63%.  The  current  electrification  rate  in  the  Eastern \nprovince is 76%. \n\n6   ADB  also  provides  support  to  address  post-conflict  electricity  needs  in  the  Northern  province  by  financing  an \nenergy  sector  component,  including  a  transmission  line  to  be  constructed  from  Kilinochchi  to  Chunnakam  and  a \ngrid  substation  at  Chunnakam  (ADB.  2010.

The framework is \nbased  on  the  government\u2019s  National  Energy  Policy  and  Strategies.  The  government  updated \nthis  development  framework  in  2010.8 The  updated  framework  has  a  comprehensive  sector \ndevelopment  road  map,  a  long-term  investment  program,  and  policy  and  reform  measures.  In \nparticular,  the  new  government  strategy  aims  to  (i)  increase  power  supply  capacity  to  about \n3,500  megawatts  (MW)  by  2012  and  6,400  MW  by  2020  and  reduce  the  generation  cost  by \nadding aggregate base load capacity of about 2,000 MW of three coal-fired plants; (ii) increase \nthe share in grid energy supply from nonconventional renewable energy sources from 4.1% in \n2007 to 7.0% by 2012, 10.0% by 2016, and 20.0% by 2020; and (iii) reduce the total technical \nand commercial losses in the network from 14.6% in 2009 to 14.0% by 2012, 13.0% by 2016, \nand 12.0% by 2020. \n \n5. \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country  partnership \nstrategy for Sri Lanka.9 It will support sustainable development of the energy sector in line with \nthe national and sector priorities.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  project  will  contribute  to  a  reliable,  adequate,  and  affordable  power  supply  for \n6. \nsustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. The outcome will be increased clean power \nsupply, and improved efficiency and reliability in the delivery of electricity. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n7. \n\nThe outputs will be the following:10  \n(i) \n\nTransmission infrastructure in the Northern province: \n(a)  Mannar  power  transmission  development.

The  investment  plan  estimates,  and  the  operating  cost  and  structure  once  the \ninvestments are made, were examined and found to be appropriate.  The investment proposal \nfits  the  specifications  associated  with  the  current  asset  base  for  the  transmission  and \ndistribution  network  in  the  project  areas.  The  investments  may  not  place  an  undue  burden  on \nCEB.  However,  CEB  needs  to  improve  significantly  its  financial  base,  financial  performance, \noperating  systems,  and  overall  efficiency  levels.  An  independent  study  is  planned  to  tackle \nthese shortcomings. \n \nB. \n \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return16 was  calculated  by  comparing  with-  and  without-\n20. \nproject  scenarios.  Detailed  cost\u2013benefit  calculations  confirm  the  economic  viability  and \nsustainability  of  the  investments.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  12.16%.  A  sensitivity \nand risk analysis demonstrates a robust economic performance. \n \nThe financial internal rate of return (FIRR)17 is 10.99%. Financial viability was examined \n21. \nby comparing the incremental costs and benefits on a with- and without-investment basis. The \nweighted average cost of capital was calculated for each subproject and for the overall project. \nFinancial viability was assessed by comparing the weighted average cost of capital to the FIRR \nfor  each  subproject  and  for  the  aggregated  project.  The  sensitivity  of  the  FIRR  to  adverse \nmovements in the underlying assumptions was also assessed and found to be robust.  \n \nC. \n \n22. \nCEB  is  a  vertically  integrated  utility  delinked  from  the  regulatory  framework.  The  Sri \nLanka  Electricity  Act,  2009  encourages  efficiency  improvements  of  CEB  by  regulating  each of \nits  six  functional  business  units  (FBUs).  The  2009  Act  empowered  the  Public  Utilities \nCommission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), an independent regulator for the energy and water sectors \nestablished under the PUCSL Act, 2002, to regulate electricity supply industry. PUCSL started \nregulating  each  FBU  separately  and  has  issued  individual  licenses  for  that  purpose.  Financial \naccounts are segregated to allow each FBU to operate as a profit center, and a transfer pricing \nscheme between FBUs is in place. The CEB board delegates to the heads of each FBU day-to-\nday  management  decision  making.  Subsequent  to  the  introduction  of  the  2009  Act,  ADB \napproved  a  Clean  Energy  and  Access  Improvement  Project 18  in  2009,  which,  along  with \ninvestments  in  physical  infrastructure,  was  designed  to  bring  about  sector  reforms.

Manila. \n\nGovernance \n\n\festablished a tariff methodology and a road map for tariff reforms and rebalancing. This work is \nsuccessful  but  more  is  to  be  done.  Two  tariff  filings  have  been  conducted  and  tariff \ndeterminations were announced in January 2011 and July 2011. As a result, PUCSL\u2019s capacity \nto carry out its functions has been strengthened.  \n \n23. \nCEB  has  the  necessary  capacity  to  undertake  the  project.  CEB  was  the  implementing \nagency  for  past  ADB-financed  projects.  It  has  also  managed  investments  funded  by  other \ndevelopment partners. A financial management assessment of CEB concluded that it can fulfill \nADB\u2019s fiduciary requirements for the project. CEB regularly faces cash shortfalls because of low \ntariffs  and  expensive  power  generation  and  it  has  expensive  short-term  loans.  Both  of  these \nshortcomings  need  to  be  corrected.  The  government  remains  committed  to  energy  sector \nreforms. Under the 2009 Act, all tariffs must reflect costs; the Treasury will bear the cost of any \nsubsidy  approved  by  the  government.  In  March  2008,  the  government  introduced  a  new  tariff \nstructure that increased average retail tariffs by 30%. The government has also restructured a \nportion of CEB\u2019s long-term debt. The tariff order issued by PUCSL in January 2011 increased \nthe  average  electricity  tariff  by  about  8%.  In  February  2012,  PUCSL  implemented  a  fuel \nadjustment formula for certain customer categories. With the introduction of low-cost generation, \nit  is  expected  that  it  will  be  possible  to  achieve  cost  recovery  from  2017.  Details  of  CEB\u2019s \nfinancial management assessment are available in the project administration manual and in the \nassessment of CEB\u2019s past financial performance and projections.19 \n \n24. \nSEA  has  received  considerable  capacity  development  assistance  from  development \npartners, including ADB20 and Japan International Cooperation Agency, and will be undertaking \ntechnical due diligence of applications for the solar rooftop power generation pilot subprojects. \nThe agency can manage the proposed grant and credit line. \n \n25. \nAll  procurement  under  the  project  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Recruitment of consultants will \nbe  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended  from \ntime to time). Open competitive bidding will be followed. An oversight role by ADB will ensure \nintegrity in procurement and implementation activities. CEB and SEA maintain a project website \nthat  will  be  updated  regularly  and  will  include  (i)  bidding  procedures,  bidders,  and  contract \nawards;  (ii)  use  of  the  funds  disbursed  under  the  project;  and  (iii)  physical  progress.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernment,  MOPE,  CEB,  and  SEA.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n \n26. \nThe project will contribute to sustainable economic development, poverty reduction, and \nsocial  well-being 21 through  increased  access  to  electricity,  reduction  of  system  losses,  and \nimprovement in the quality of power. Greater access to a stable supply of electricity will promote \n                                                 \n19  Ceylon  Electricity  Board\u2019s  Past  Financial  Performance  and  Projections  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n20  ADB. 2007.

The project is expected \nto  generate  jobs  for  skilled  and  unskilled  laborers  during  construction.  Improved  access  to \nelectricity and better supply quality will also enhance the living standards of rural households. \n \nE. \n \n \n \nNone of the project components will have any significant social safeguard impacts. The \n27. \ntransmission  and  distribution  lines  primarily  cross  public  and  unused  lands.  Where  croplands \nare affected, adequate compensation will be paid.

Where  new  grid  substations  are  built  on  commercial  and  private  lands, \nadequate  compensation  will  be  paid  to  their  owners.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for \ninvoluntary  resettlement  impacts.  CEB  prepared  a  resettlement  plan  for  the  transmission \ninfrastructure  and  transmission  and  distribution  efficiency  improvement  components. 22  The \nproject is classified category C for impacts on indigenous peoples.  \n \n \n \nCEB and SEA have prepared initial environmental examinations23 for their components \n28. \nand held public consultations. During construction and operation, steps will be taken to minimize \nenvironmental impacts. CEB has observed the route-selection criteria in the national regulations \nand  has  adopted  best  environmental  practices.  Adequate  provisions  have  been  made  for  the \nenvironmental mitigation measures, monitoring requirements, and their associated costs in the \nenvironmental  management  plans  (EMPs)  prepared  for  each  subproject.  CEB  has  sufficient \ncapacity to implement the safeguard measures incorporated in the EMPs. Mitigation measures \nrelated to construction and specified in the EMPs will be incorporated into civil works contracts. \nThe contractors will have primary responsibility for implementing the mitigation measures during \nconstruction,  but  CEB  will  be  responsible  for  and  periodically  report  to  ADB  on  overall \nimplementation of its site-specific EMPs. CEB and SEA will adhere to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009) and local and government environmental regulations. The project is classified \ncategory B for environment. \n \n\nEnvironmental Safeguards \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\nClimate Change Impact \n\n \n29. \nThe  project  is  expected  to  have  considerable  positive  impacts  on  climate  change.  Its \nrenewable energy intervention will bring solar power generation to the grid, which is equivalent \nto  avoiding  about  1,286  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  emissions  per  year.  An  average  reduction  of \nabout 55,500 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year may be achieved through technical loss \nreduction  from  the  improved  energy  efficiency  of  the  transmission  and  distribution  lines  for \n2016\u20132036. \n \nF. \n \nThe  potential  governance  risk  stems  from  CEB  having  insufficient  cash  to  fund  its \n30. \noperations  because  of  (i)  an  increase  in  fuel  oil  costs  and  reliance  on  expensive  thermal \nelectricity generation, (ii) delays in commissioning less costly generating capacity, and (iii) tariffs \nset below the cost of supply. The potential risks to project implementation include unexpected \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n                                                 \n22  Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23   Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fincreases  in  the  prices  of  commodities  and  raw  materials,  and  delays  in  implementation  that \nraise  project  costs.
