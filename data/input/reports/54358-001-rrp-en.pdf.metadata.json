The RMI meets all the access criteria for the \nCPRO as summarized in Table 1 (detailed in Appendix 4). \n \n\nTable 1: HEALS Program Compliance with CPRO Access Criteria \n\nCPRO Access Criteria \n1.

Structural reforms \n\nADB Assessment \nADB estimates that the RMI\u2019s economy contracted by 5.5% in FY2020 with a further 1.4% \ndecline  projected  for  FY2021.  COVID-19  entry  restrictions  are  adversely  affecting  the \nfisheries, hotels and restaurants, and transport sectors. The government\u2019s fiscal gap also \nwidened to 4.7% of GDP in FY2020 from 2.2% in FY2019, with additional financing needs \nof 15.0% of GDP projected for FY2021. ADB projects that more than 700 jobs (about 28% \nheld  by  women)  will  likely  be  lost  by  the  end  of  FY2021\u2014the  largest  employment \nreduction in more than 2 decades. The basic needs poverty rate is at risk of rising from \nan estimated 29.4%\u201331.6% of households in FY2019 to 33.8%\u201335.2% by end\u2013FY2021.   \nIn  June  2020,  the  government  first  approved  the  RMI  Coronavirus  Preparedness  and \nResponse  Plan  which  was  updated in  September  to  cover  $45.8  million  (equivalent  to \n21.0%  of  GDP)  in  priority  spending.  For  health  care,  the  plan  includes  measures  to \nupgrade  capacities  for  screening  and  testing  for  COVID-19;  strengthen  infection \nprevention and control; and establish case management protocols. For economic relief \nand recovery, financial assistance will be provided to businesses affected by the travel \nrestrictions. To safeguard vulnerable communities, monthly food baskets will be delivered \nto households along with fishing and farming tools. A gender-based violence hotline will \nbe supported, as well as school lunches.    \nThe  RMI  recorded  5  consecutive  years  of  growth  averaging  2.9%  during  FY2015\u2013\nFY2019, while keeping inflation low at \u20130.6% per annum. The country achieved annual \nfiscal surpluses averaging 3.4% of GDP from FY2014\u2013FY2018, with revenue collections \nrising from 23.6% of GDP to 32.2% during this period. A fiscal deficit of 2.2% of GDP was \nrecorded in FY2019 because of transfers to copra producers and the social security fund. \nThe pre\u2013COVID-19 FY2020  budget targeted cutting the  deficit by half to contain fiscal \npressures. Furthermore, the RMI has built up its Compact Trust Fund from $240.1 million \nin FY2014 to $518.6 million in August 2020. \nThe  RMI  has  implemented  preemptive  COVID-19  response  measures  including: \n(i) expanded  monitoring  by  the  Health  Emergency  Operations  Center\u2014activated  since \nJuly  2019  because  of  a  dengue  outbreak\u2014to  also  include  COVID-19  surveillance, \nfollowing the President\u2019s declaration of a state of health emergency on 7 February 2020; \n(ii) entry  restrictions  for  travelers  from  affected  areas  in  January  2020  followed  by  full \nborder closure since early March; (iii) preparation of COVID-19 laboratories, isolation and \nquarantine sites; and (iv) continuing procurement of medical supplies and equipment. The \nMinistry of Health and Human Services is also preparing immunization reporting systems \nfor post-market surveillance of a potential COVID-19 vaccine. \n\n \n\n1   ADB. 2020.

The plan \nwas  initially  approved  in  June  2020  to  cover  $42.3  million  in  countercyclical  development  expenditures.  It  was \nexpanded to include a school lunch program valued at $3.5 million in September 2020.  \n\n\f \n\n2 \n\nCPRO Access Criteria \n5. Debt sustainability \n\n6. IMF coordination \n\nADB Assessment \nPublic debt has declined from 85.2% of GDP in FY2000 to 31.5% in FY2019. Although \nthe IMF classifies the RMI as facing a high risk of debt distress, this is primarily because \nof  medium-  to  long-  term  fiscal  pressures,  including  the  potential  impacts  of  disasters. \nWith  financing  needs  arising  from  the  COVID-19  crisis  largely  filled  by  grants  from \ndevelopment partners, the public debt\u2013GDP ratio is not expected to rise. Results of the \nADB  debt  sustainability  analysis  show  debt  to  remain  sustainable,  particularly  with \nexpected economic recovery after FY2021. Although the risk of debt distress will remain \nhigh,  this  reflects  medium-  to  long-term  fiscal  pressures,  in  line  with  the  IMF\u2019s \nassessment, and not because of unsustainable borrowing practices. \nADB  is  closely  coordinating  with  the  IMF  on  the  macro-fiscal  framework.  The  IMF \nAssessment  Letter  confirms  ADB\u2019s  views  on:  (i)  the  RMI\u2019s  pre-shock  record  of  sound \nmacroeconomic management; and (ii) the public debt\u2013GDP ratio resuming a downward \npath with economic recovery after FY2021. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, CPRO = COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option, \nFY  =  fiscal  year,  GDP  =  gross  domestic  product,  HEALS  =  Health  Expenditure  and  Livelihoods  Support,  IMF  = \nInternational Monetary Fund, RMI = Republic of the Marshall Islands.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \nDevelopment context. The RMI is a small island developing state in the North Pacific, \n3. \nwith a population of about 55,000 and a land area of 181.3 square kilometers. It is vulnerable to \nfrequent disasters, including typhoons and severe drought. Climate change risks are particularly \nheightened, with the RMI being one of the lowest-lying atoll nations in the world. Although the \nRMI has only two confirmed COVID-19 cases as of 6 November 2020, it is expected to suffer \neconomic contractions in FY2020\u2013FY2021, with adverse socioeconomic impacts. 3  \n \n4. \nPreemptive measures against COVID-19. Early and decisive action has helped the RMI \navoid a COVID-19 outbreak. Entry restrictions and quarantine requirements for travelers from, or \ntransiting through, COVID-19 affected areas, as well as health screenings for all arrivals by air \nand sea, were implemented starting 24 January 2020. After the World Health Organization (WHO) \ncharacterized the global COVID-19 outbreak as a public health emergency at the end of January, \nthe  President  of  the  RMI  declared  a  state  of  health  emergency  on  7  February  2020. \nThe  declaration  directed  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Human  Services  (MOHHS)  to  activate  its \nemergency operations plan. The Health Emergency Operations Center was directed to expand \nmonitoring and implement COVID-19 preparedness and response measures to minimize the risk \nof importation and possible local transmission. The RMI suspended all commercial travel into the \ncountry  on  8  March  2020,  even  before  the  WHO  declared  COVID-19  a  global  pandemic  on \n11 March  2020. 4  The  MOHHS  is  conducting  targeted  on-site  COVID-19  testing  for  those \nexhibiting mild symptoms of respiratory illness. The RMI recorded its first two COVID-19 cases \non 28 October 2020. Both are imported cases affecting workers at the United States (US) military \nbase in Kwajalein travelling from Hawaii, with no threat of community transmission.5 \n \n5. \nFragile health care system. The RMI has two hospitals\u2014one in Majuro and the other in \nEbeye\u2014providing  primary,  secondary,  and  limited  tertiary  care,  plus  56  health  care  centers \nacross neighboring island and atoll communities. The health care system has a total capacity of \nabout 150 beds, with 11 intensive care unit beds, and 20 ventilators. Even pre\u2013COVID-19, 79% \n\nconfirmed while in quarantine.  \n\n \n\n3   Both cases were expatriate staff who arrived at the Kwajalein Island military base of the United States, which were \n\n4   A twice-monthly cargo flight connection with Guam remains in operation, but visits by cruise ships are suspended. \n5   WHO. 2020. Joint incident management team External Situation Report. Suva (as of 28 October 2020). \n\n \n\n\f \n\nof women in urban areas and 94% in rural areas reported difficulties in accessing health care.6 \nBetween March and July 2020, the MOHHS built a special ward in the Majuro hospital with eight \nisolation rooms with negative air flow to expand capacity for critical care. Although non-essential \nservices  have  been  scaled  back  to  allow  critically  ill  or  suspected  cases  to  receive  care,  the \nestimated requirement for hospital beds in the event of local transmission of COVID-19 remains \nover seven times the current capacity.7 Approximately 5% of potential hospitalizations (up to 300 \ncases)  are  expected  to  require  ventilators,  intensive  care  unit  beds,  and  isolation  wards. \nQuarantine  sites  near  Majuro  and  the  Kwajalein  base  are  available  for  mandatory  isolation  of \nrepatriated citizens. The density of skilled health professionals is low at 3.76 per 1,000 population \n(only  0.42  medical  doctors  per  1,000  population),  below  the  Sustainable  Development  Goal \nminimum  threshold  of  4.45  per  1,000  population.  Most  of  the  health  workforce  also  requires \nadditional training for a pandemic and are at a higher risk of infection, which can rapidly deplete \ncapacity.  Women  face  heightened  infection  risk  not  only  because  they  comprise  a  majority  of \nfrontline health workers, but also due to caring responsibilities. The RMI ranks 191st out of 195 \neconomies on the Global Health Security Index, indicating severe limitations in the capacity to \nmanage  epidemics  or  pandemics.  The  WHO  rates  the  country\u2019s  preparedness  and  response \nstatus as Level 2 (on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 as the best) with a high risk of importing the virus.  \n  \n6. \nNarrow-based economy centered on fisheries. Economic performance is largely driven \nby fisheries-related activities, which permeates across sectors. Domestic commercial purse seine \ntuna fishing\u2014plus smaller operations of local producers for home consumption and sale in the \nMajuro  fishing  market,  and  of  exporters  of  aquarium  fish\u2014provide  direct  value-added  in  the \nfisheries sector. A tuna loining plant in Majuro also contributes most of total manufacturing output. \nMajuro is the world\u2019s busiest tuna transshipment port, boosting the transport services sector, and \nproviding ancillary services such as fish containerization, supplies provisioning, and net repair to \n400\u2013500 purse seiners per year pre-pandemic. On the demand side, there has been a sharp rise \nin fishing license revenues. Since the full implementation in 2012 of a vessel day scheme in the \nexclusive economic zones of the Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA), the RMI\u2019s collections of \nfishing license fees have increased to an average of $20.6 million (9.9% of gross domestic product \n[GDP]) during FY2012\u2013FY2019 from $1.6 million (1.1% of GDP) during FY2004\u2013FY2011.8  \n \n7. \nSound macroeconomic management. Supported by strong fisheries performance, the \nRMI recorded 5 consecutive years of growth averaging 2.9% during FY2015\u2013FY2019, following \na slight contraction of 0.9% in FY2014. Increased construction activity, amid scaled-up operations \nof  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  World  Bank,  also  supported  growth. \nThe  government  achieved  annual  fiscal  surpluses  averaging  3.4%  of  GDP  from  FY2014  to \nFY2018,  in  preparation  for  the  scheduled  expiration  of  the  economic  provisions  of  the  RMI\u2019s \nCompact  of  Free  Association  with  the  US  after  FY2023.  Aided  by  recent  surpluses,  the  RMI\u2019s \nCompact Trust Fund (CTF) has grown from $240.1 million in FY2014 to $518.6 million by August \n2020.  Pre\u2013COVID-19  trends  indicate  that  the  CTF  will  likely  reach  a  level  that  can  generate \nsufficient annual investment earnings to offset expiring compact grants after FY2023, but this is \nstill  subject  to  market  volatilities. 9  The  recent  sharp  increases  in  fishing  license  revenues \n\n \n\n6   Government  of  the  Marshall  Islands,  Ministry  of  Culture  and  Internal  Affairs  and  Economic  Policy,  Planning,  and \n\nStatistics Office. 2018.

Majuro. \n\n7   Projections based on the RMI\u2019s estimated 2020 population of 54,993; and assumptions that the infection rate is 10% \nwith preparedness measures; 20% of the infected require hospitalization; and 5% of hospitalizations need ventilators. \n8  The combined waters of the Parties to the Nauru Agreement\u2014the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Nauru, \nPalau, Papua  New Guinea, the RMI, Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu\u2014yield about 30% of the global tuna catch by \nweight.  The  shift  to  a  vessel  day  scheme  from  previous  volume-based  regulation  of  distant  water  fishing  fleets \npromotes sustainability of tuna stocks by limiting fishing while increasing revenues for participating countries. \n\n9  In August 2019, the United States announced the commencement of negotiations to extend the compact, although \n\nany grants associated with this remain subject to negotiation.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f \n\ncontributed  the  most  to  a  substantial  improvement  in  domestic  resource  mobilization.  On  the \nexpenditure side, progress has been made in controlling the public sector wage bill, which has \ndeclined to an average of 21.6% of GDP during FY2015\u2013FY2019 from 23.0% during FY2005\u2013\nFY2014.  ADB\u2019s  regional  technical  assistance  (TA)  that  supported  procurement  of  a  human \nresource  management  information  system  for  the  Public  Service  Commission  helped  facilitate \npayroll control.10 Inflation was kept low at \u20130.6% per annum during FY2015\u20132019, with current \naccount surpluses averaging 11% of GDP, reflecting inflows of grants and fishing license fees. \n \nCOVID-19 impacts fisheries. Strict travel restrictions and quarantine requirements have \n8. \nbeen effective in keeping the RMI free of COVID-19 for more than 6 months since the pandemic \nwas  declared,  but  these  have  also  damaged  economic  activity. 11  Ships  that  have  transited \nthrough COVID-19-affected countries were prohibited from entering the RMI\u2019s ports particularly \nduring the early stages of global travel restrictions, disrupting the fisheries supply chain. Estimates \nshow that both domestic purse seine fishing and tuna loining operations were reduced by about \n30% in FY2020 and are expected to remain below pre\u2013COVID-19 levels in FY2021 (footnote 11). \nA requirement for fishing and carrier vessels to spend at least 14 days at sea (including travel) \nprior to entry is limiting transshipment activity in Majuro port. For example, transshipment services \nassociated  with  the  export  of  sashimi-grade  tuna  are  trending  lower  by  50%.  Although  fishing \nlicense revenues are estimated to have achieved the pre-pandemic projection of $30 million (14% \nof GDP) in FY2020, the potential adverse impact of prolonged travel restrictions on demand for \nvessel days is projected to reduce fishing license fee collections by 13% in FY2021.  \n \n9. \nOther transmission channels. Despite having a small tourism base relative to most of \nits  Pacific  peers,  the  pause  in  international  arrivals  has  translated  to  declines  of  95%  in  hotel \noccupancy, 90% in car rentals, and 50% in restaurant demand, with flow-through impacts on retail \ntrade.  Handicraft  retailers  have  reported  sales  declines  of  up  to  70%  year-on-year. 12 \nThe reduction in international passenger flights from eight per week to only two per month also \nmeans subdued aviation fuel sales, with wholesale fuel operations estimated to have fallen 45%. \n \n10. \nOutlook of successive economic contractions. With a prolonged period of restricted \ntravel, and a return to normal movement of people likely pushed back to late-2021, successive \neconomic contractions are projected for the RMI. An independent assessment acknowledged by \nthe Government of the Marshall Islands projects economic contractions of 5.5% in FY2020 and \n1.4%  in  FY2021  (footnote  11).13 Disruptions  to  fisheries  are  expected  to  be  most  substantial, \nestimated at \u20131.6 percentage points through this 2-year period. Declines are also projected for \nhotels  and  restaurants  (\u20131.2  percentage  points),  wholesale  and  retail  trade  (\u20131.2  percentage \npoints), and transport through reduced transshipment operations (\u20131.1 percentage points).  \n \n11. \nSubstantial  economic  losses.  The  projected  cumulative  economic  contractions  for \nFY2020\u2013FY2021 are on par with the decline in FY2008 amid the global food and fuel price spike. \nThey  could  roll  back  3  years  of  economic  gains  and  push  real  per  capita  incomes  below  the \nFY2017 level. Shipping delays have also resulted in spoilage of imported fruits, vegetables, dairy \nproducts, and other perishables, affecting food security. The Ministry of Natural Resources and \nCommerce estimates that about 80% of the RMI\u2019s food supply and up to 99% of other consumer \n\n \n\n10  ADB. 2020.

Inventories of essential items, including food and sanitation supplies, as of \nmid-March, fell short of levels needed to ensure food security during the pandemic (footnote 12). \n \n12. \nReductions in employment. The projected economic losses are expected to translate to \nthe loss of between 417 and 716 full-time jobs (or 3.6% to 6.1% of formal employment) by the \nend  of  FY2021.14 The  largest  employment  impacts  are  expected  in  the  hotels  and  restaurants \nsector (up to 36% of total job losses) followed by transport and trade (28%). At the tuna loining \nplant, which employed 137 workers as of FY2018, 60 people were already laid off by the early \nstages of travel restrictions as supply chain disruptions led to scaled back operations. There have \nbeen  immediate  job  losses  among  fishing  boat  observers,  who  are  tasked  with  independently \nmonitoring  vessels\u2019  compliance  with  the  PNA\u2019s  vessel  day  scheme  regulations  and  other \nconservation  measures.  To  minimize  potential  COVID-19  transmission,  the  PNA  decided  to \nwithdraw all observers, while ramping up technology-based monitoring, resulting in the temporary \nunemployment of 44 Marshallese observers. As of 2017, social security data suggest that women \ncomprise 32% of formal employment in the RMI, with 93% of employed women in the services \nsector  including  hotels  and  restaurants,  as  well  as  wholesale  and  retail  trade  (footnote  6). \nMore than 200 jobs lost due to the COVID-19 crisis affect women. \n \n13. \nThe RMI Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Plan. Approved by the cabinet in \nJune 2020, then updated in September, the plan details interventions to strengthen capacities for \nhealth  surveillance,  infection  prevention  and  control,  clinical  management  of  cases,  while \nmitigating the pandemic\u2019s economic and social impacts.15 The $45.8 million (21.0% of GDP) plan \nallocates  funding  across  three  primary  areas:  (i) $21.1  million  to  strengthen  health  systems; \n(ii) $12.4 million to provide assistance to businesses; and (iii) $8.3 million to safeguard the well-\nbeing  of  vulnerable  communities  and  households,  particularly  those  in the  neighboring  islands \nand  atolls.  An  additional  $4.0  million  is  budgeted  toward  ensuring  the  continuity  of  essential \nservices and for consular assistance for citizens abroad. Implementation of the plan started in \nFY2020 and will continue in FY2021, with seven sector clusters activated to coordinate national \nagencies\u2019 responses.16 Grants from the RMI\u2019s development partners\u2014ADB, the European Union, \nthe International Organization for Migration, the World Bank, along with Japan, Taipei,China, and \nthe US\u2014have been identified to finance expenditure needs. \n \nHealth  sector  capacity  for  COVID-19  preparedness  and  response  ($21.1  million). \n14. \nThe largest share of the plan\u2019s budget is directed toward activities and investments to strengthen \nhealth  surveillance  and  provide  surge  capacity  for  health  care.  As  of  September  2020, \nthe  government  has  spent  about  $9.5  million  for  medical  equipment  and  supplies,  including \npersonal protective equipment (PPE), and facilities upgrades. In addition to the new isolation ward \nin Majuro hospital (para. 5), new COVID-19 testing laboratories have been installed in Majuro and \nEbeye  and  a  third  quarantine  facility  has  been  prepared  on  Gugeegue  Island  near  Ebeye. \nThe MOHHS is also preparing immunization reporting systems for post-market surveillance of a \npotential COVID-19 vaccine. To safeguard ports of entry and eventually facilitate less restricted \nshipping activity, the plan supports providing training and materials for infection prevention and \ncontrol  (e.g.,  proper  use  of  PPE,  decontamination,  waste  management)  as  well  as  building \ntemporary  quarantine  shelters  at  Majuro  and  Ebeye  ports.  For  neighboring  island  and  atoll \ncommunities, the plan allocates funding for: (i) adding storage units to 65 health dispensaries; \n(ii) COVID-19 preparedness mobile teams to conduct facility assessments and trainings on health \n\n \n\n14  Estimates are based on references in footnotes 11 and 12. \n15  Social protection aspects of the plan are summarized in Summary of Social Protection Measures in Government\u2019s \n\nCOVID-19 Response Package (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n16  The seven sector clusters under the plan are: agriculture and food security; education; gender and protection; health; \n\ninfrastructure; shelter; and water, sanitation, and hygiene.  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nprotocols; (iii) procurement of test kits, PPE, medical supplies, and disinfectants; and (iv) potential \nreferral  of  patients  to  Majuro  or  Ebeye.  The  plan  also  provides  for  improvements  in  water, \nsanitation,  and  hygiene  facilities,  particularly  in  schools  and  community  handwashing  stations, \nto boost  infection  prevention  and  control.  Funding  is  also  allocated  for  purchasing  cleaning \nsupplies, sanitizers, disinfectants, and personal hygiene kits for use in quarantine and isolation \nfacilities. To safeguard the welfare of women and girls in these facilities, provisions are made to \ndistribute dignity kits and conduct staff training programs on the prevention of sexual harassment. \n \nEconomic relief for affected businesses ($12.4 million).17 In June 2020, the cabinet \n15. \napproved  a  $6  million  economic  relief  program  providing  financial  assistance  to  businesses \naffected by COVID-19 travel restrictions. The relief program is wide-ranging, targeting tourism-\nrelated businesses\u2014hotels, restaurants, travel and shipping agents, and handicraft shops\u2014but is \nalso open to any enterprise that can show proof of adverse impacts. As of mid-October, grants \nhave  been  provided  to  58  local  businesses,  with  more  than  40  additional  applications  under \nreview.  Grant  amounts  have  ranged  from  $2,000  to  $50,000  and  is  based  on  the  estimated \nadverse impact of COVID-19 travel restrictions on business turnover (as gauged from tax filings) \nover  a  6-month  period.  Beneficiaries  have  included  small  and  informal  businesses,  which  are \nprovided a flat rate of $900 for 6 months in the absence of financial documentation. The plan also \nallocates funds to facilitate local supply chains for fabric facemasks, hospital gowns and beddings, \nand virgin coconut oil that will mostly benefit women producers. A further $6.4 million is allocated \nto  support  business  continuity  and  facilitate  quicker  recovery  of  operations.  Options  under \nconsideration  include  support  for  employers  to  provide  necessary  protective  equipment  and \ntransport arrangements (in line with social distancing protocols) that will allow staff to return safely \nto work. Also, the proposed creation of a utilities discount program and provision of guaranteed \nor  low-interest  loans  to  employers  can  help  businesses  stave  off  bankruptcy  and  allow  for  a \nsmoother recovery in operations when travel restrictions are eventually phased out.  \n \n16.  Well-being of vulnerable communities and households ($8.3 million). The plan places \nparticular emphasis on promoting well-being across the remote and vulnerable communities in \nthe 22 neighboring islands and atolls outside of Majuro and Kwajalein. To safeguard food security, \nprovisions are in place to deliver monthly food baskets to about 2,380 households over at least a \n6-month period. Fishing and farming implements will also be distributed to communities to support \nsubsistence  production  and  enable  greater  self-reliance.  Household  rapid  vulnerability \nassessments supported by the International Organization for Migration helped identify the most \nvulnerable households in Majuro and Ebeye.18 The government is using the results to calibrate \nits  response  and  target  assistance  to  identified  households.  A  new  national  gender-based \nviolence telephone hotline has also been activated to help address a possible increase in cases \nof abuse during the current crisis. In September 2020, the plan was updated to secure sustained \nfunding  for  the  Ministry  of  Education\u2019s  feeding  program  that  provides  school  lunch  meals  to \nstudents from poor families. The updated plan allocates an additional $3.5 million to expand the \nprogram  and  provide  school  lunches  to  about  11,300  children  nationwide  5  days  per  week. \nProvisions for continuing children\u2019s education (e.g., learning kits) are also prioritized.   \n \nSocial assistance for vulnerable groups. Outside of the plan, the government has also \n17. \ncommitted  to  sustaining  adequate  funding  for  the  RMI\u2019s  ongoing  social  protection  programs\u2014\n\n \n\n17 Relief  for  businesses  complements  the  provision  of  unemployment  benefits  to  affected  workers  through  the  US \nPandemic Unemployment Assistance and Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation programs. Citizens of \nthe RMI are eligible for these programs, with US assistance coursed through the RMI Labor Division. \n\n18 Government of the Marshall Islands. 2020.

The  main  target \nbeneficiaries are vulnerable youth who lack or have very little formal education. The Life Skills \nAcademy provides training on gardening, woodworking, sewing, food preparation, and crafts to \nstudents who are not able to continue secondary education. Funding to continue providing free \nmaternal and reproductive health services is likewise ring-fenced. As part of the social insurance \nscheme  in  the  country,  employed  persons  in  both  public  and  private  sectors  are  entitled  to \nretirement benefits, disability insurance benefits, surviving spouse insurance benefits, surviving \nchild  insurance  benefits,  and  lump-sum  benefits.  There  has  been  no  disruption  in  the  regular \npension, with the Marshall Islands Social Security Administration administering the funds. \n \nCOVID-19 preparedness and response adds to fiscal pressures. Although the RMI\u2019s \n18. \nfiscal  position  weakened  in  FY2019  to  a  deficit  equivalent  to  about  2.2%  of  GDP  because  of \ntransfers to copra producers and the social security fund, the pre\u2013COVID-19 budget for FY2020 \ntargeted more than halving the deficit to quickly contain fiscal pressures. However, with COVID-\n19, the fiscal position is projected to deteriorate further through FY2021 (Table 2). Tax collections \nare estimated to have declined by 4.1% in nominal terms in FY2020, as subdued business activity \nresulted in a substantial shortfall in gross revenue taxes. While fishing license revenues remained \nbroadly stable in FY2020,  these are projected to decline by  up to $4 million in FY2021  as the \ndemand for vessel days weakens amid prolonged travel restrictions (para. 8). On the expenditure \nside, an estimated $12.5 million ($10.3 million from grants) of the additional spending detailed in \nthe updated plan was implemented in FY2020, leaving $33.3 million for execution in FY2021 to \ncomplete the plan\u2019s 2-year implementation period (para. 13).  \n \n\nTable 2: Selected Fiscal and Economic Indicators  \n(% of GDP, unless otherwise stated) \n\nFY2018 \n3.6  \n0.8  \n \n\nFY2016 \n1.3  \n(1.5) \n \n\nFY2017 \n4.1  \n0.0  \n \n\nFY2019e \n3.8  \n0.1  \n \n\nFY2020e \n(5.5) \n0.3  \n \n\nFY2021p \n(1.4) \n0.5  \n \n\nItem \nReal GDP growth (% change) \nInflation (% annual average) \nCentral government budget \n  Total revenue \n    Tax revenue \n    Nontax revenue \n    Grants \n  Total expenditure \n    Recurrent \n      % of which wages and salaries \n    Capital \n  Fiscal balance \nPublic debt \n   % of which is external debt \nNominal GDP ($ million) \n\n61.0  \n14.4  \n17.2  \n29.5  \n57.1  \n54.0  \n21.1  \n3.1  \n3.9  \n44.1  \n44.1  \n200.6  \n( ) = negative, e = estimate, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product, p = projection. \nSources: Asian Development Outlook database; and Graduate School USA. 2020.

The program will also \nhelp to ensure the continuity of essential government services and employment. The program is \naligned with the focus of the Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020\u2014ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy \nfor the 11 small Pacific developing member countries, including the RMI\u2014on managing risks from \nexternal shocks, including by improving health and social protection services.20 The program is \nalso  aligned  with  Strategy  2030\u2019s  operational  priorities  of  addressing  remaining  poverty  and \nreducing inequality, accelerating progress in gender equality, and strengthening governance and \ninstitutional  capacity. 21 There  was  due  consideration  for  designing  the  assistance  in  a  fragile \ncontext-sensitive manner to ensure strong implementation, monitoring, and reporting. \n \n20. \nADB\u2019s value addition. Previous and ongoing ADB operations in the RMI emphasize the \ncritical  need  to  promote  longer-term  fiscal  and  economic  sustainability  to  allow  for  increased \nresilience to adverse shocks. In the aftermath of the global financial and economic crisis, a series \nof ADB policy-based operations provided timely budget support while also progressing some key \nreforms  to  control  recurrent  spending  and  improve  the  tax  effort. 22 Since  2017,  ADB\u2019s  public \nfinancial management (PFM) project has provided sustained in-country capacity supplementation \nat the Ministry of Finance (MOF), particularly in refining and implementing the public sector reform \nagenda.23 At the sector level, a project to improve the power distribution network in Majuro also \nincludes a component to improve the financial and operational sustainability of the energy utility.24 \n \n21. \nTo  comprehensively  support  the  RMI\u2019s  COVID-19  preparedness  and  response, \nADB\u2019s assistance  involves  synergies  across  various  modalities.  In  April  2020,  ADB  disbursed \n$370,000  in  grants  from  the  Asia  Pacific  Disaster  Response  Fund  to  support  the  immediate \nresponse,  followed  by  another  $6  million  under  the  Pacific  Disaster  Resilience  Program \n(Phase 2), shortly after the scope of contingent disaster financing instruments was expanded to \ncover health-related emergencies (footnote 1).25 In addition, ADB TA is funding the procurement \nof COVID-19 test kits, PPE, and other medical supplies amounting to about $585,000.26 The RMI \nreceived an additional $630,000 in grants from the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund in August \nfollowing additional financing from the Government of Japan, and an additional $104,960 under \nan  urban  services  project  readiness  facility  in  September  to  support  distribution  of  PPE  and \ncommunity  outreach  in  Ebeye. 27  ADB  TA  also  supported  refinement  of  the  macro-fiscal \nframework  to  estimate  FY2020  and  FY2021  financing  needs  more  comprehensively. 28  To \nsafeguard against any potential disasters during this critical crisis period, ADB worked with the \ngovernment to establish a new contingent disaster financing instrument. To facilitate the RMI\u2019s \nrecovery  from  the  COVID-19  crisis,  ADB\u2019s  assistance  during  FY2021\u2013FY2023  will  focus  on \nsustaining critical capacity supplementation with additional financing for the PFM project (para. \n\n \n\n20 ADB. 2016.

The  program  applies  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  providing \neconomic recovery support programs across the Pacific during the 2008\u20132009 global financial \nand economic crisis (including footnote 22).30 These programs demonstrated the critical need to \nsupport  aggregate  demand  while  safeguarding  the  fiscal  position  through  prioritized  and  well-\ntargeted public expenditure programs. The HEALS Program\u2019s focus on health aims to avoid a \npotential collapse in domestic demand that can occur with a direct COVID-19 outbreak in the RMI. \nSupport for food security and assistance to affected employers will help facilitate a more rapid \neconomic recovery, which will drive a quick return to fiscal sustainability after the crisis. The RMI \nis classified by ADB as a fragile situation with thin capacities for effective governance.31 Previous \nADB TA in the country highlights the need to address acute capacity constraints, particularly when \nimplementing ambitious and wide-ranging government programs (as is the case with COVID-19 \npreparedness and response).32 To supplement implementation capacity, particularly for targeting \nand  monitoring  of  assistance,  ADB  is  mobilizing  regional  TA  supporting  social  protection  and \ngender equality.33 ADB\u2019s ongoing PFM project also contributes to the delivery of the government\u2019s \nplanned COVID-19 response package.    \n \n23. \nDevelopment coordination. The program complements grant assistance contributed by \ndevelopment  partners  for  the  RMI\u2019s  preparedness  and  response  plan.  These  include: \n(i) $12.3 million from the US through its Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act as \nwell  as  various  programs  under  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  and  the \nDepartment  of  Education;  (ii) $2.7  million  from  the  European  Union,  mainly  for  food  security; \n(iii) $2.5 million from the World Bank through an emergency assistance project that supports on-\nisland  laboratory  COVID-19  testing;  (iv) $1.2  million  in  medical  supplies  from  Taipei,China, \nincluding polymerase chain reaction testing machines, infrared thermometers and medical masks; \nand (v) $0.3 million from Japan in critical medical, water and sanitation, and hygiene supplies.34 \nThe RMI is also coordinating with the US on an eventual COVID-19 vaccination program to help \nreopen the economy when a vaccine becomes available. The WHO provides support to the RMI \nthrough a representative office in Fiji and a liaison office in the Federated States of Micronesia. \nThe  program  is  also  developed  in  close  coordination  with  the  IMF  through  regular  information \nsharing  to  ensure  that  the  program  helps  safeguard  broad  macroeconomic  stability  during  the \ncrisis. The IMF agrees with ADB\u2019s views on the RMI\u2019s pre-shock record of sound macroeconomic \nmanagement, as well as on a medium-term downward path for public debt\u2013GDP with economic \nrecovery  from  the  current  COVID-19  crisis.  Further,  the  IMF  recommends  continued  fiscal \nconsolidation to preserve the CTF in real terms post-FY2023.  \n \nC. \n \nThe economic and fiscal impacts of COVID-19 travel restrictions are estimated to have \n24. \nresulted in a fiscal gap of $10.3 million (equivalent to 4.7% of GDP) in FY2020 that was bridged \nthrough grant assistance. ADB projects the government\u2019s financing needs will rise to $32.3 million \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs, Budget Support, and Debt Sustainability \n\n \n\n29  ADB. 2018.

During FY2020, the RMI received $20.5 million in COVID-19 grants and spent an estimated $10.3 million to support \ninterventions in its Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Plan.

The  RMI\u2019s  public  debt  stock  comprises  borrowing  from  external \ncreditors, including ADB and  the US, mostly from the 1990s and early-2000s. Public debt has \ndeclined steadily from the equivalent of 85.2% of GDP in FY2000 to 31.5% in FY2019. An August \n2018 debt sustainability analysis (DSA) by the IMF concluded that the RMI continues to face a \nhigh risk of debt distress. An updated IMF DSA, as noted in the September 2020 IMF Assessment \nLetter, maintains this high risk rating.36 However, the updated assessment reiterates that this risk \ndoes not stem from COVID-19 impacts or unsustainable borrowing practices but instead reflects \npotential fiscal pressures from the impending expiration of the economic provisions of the compact \nin FY2023 and the impacts of disasters over the longer term. As the government has no intention \nto borrow and is instead seeking grant assistance from the country\u2019s development partners to fill \nfinancing needs arising from the COVID-19 crisis, both the IMF and ADB expect the public debt\u2013\nGDP  ratio  to  maintain  its  steady  downward  trend  over  the  medium  term. 37 Grant  assistance \nthrough  the  proposed  HEALS  Program  will  also  help  the  RMI  forego  higher-cost  (even  if \nconcessional)  borrowing.  The  ADB  DSA  therefore  concludes  that  public  debt  will  remain \nsustainable over the long term.38  \n \n\n \n\n35 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n36 IMF Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n37 Its classification as a grant-assistance only country by ADB and the World Bank also effectively discourages the RMI \nfrom engaging in any nonconcessional borrowing, pursuant to the Sustainable Development Finance Policy adopted \nby multilateral development partners.  \n\n38 DSA (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nD. \n \n26. \nThe  MOF  will  be  the  executing  agency  responsible  for  coordinating  and  monitoring \nprogram  implementation.  The  National  Disaster  Committee  (NDC),  which  has  primary \nresponsibility for the government\u2019s response plan, will be the implementing agency. The National \nEmergency Operations Center prepares monthly situation reports and provides periodic updates \nto the NDC on expenditures, the number of beneficiaries served, and progress toward targets. \nSex-disaggregated data of beneficiaries will also be regularly collected to report achievement of \ngender  monitoring  matrix  targets.39 Program  implementation  will  utilize  the  inter-governmental \nclusters  system  established  by  the  plan  to  avoid  duplication  of  efforts  and  maximize  available \ncapacities for delivering assistance (para. 13). As part of lessons learned and context-sensitive \ndesign,  implementation  capacity  will  be  supplemented  by  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  PFM  project  and \nregional TAs supporting the government in targeting and monitoring social protection and gender \naspects  of  assistance  (para.  22).  The  World  Bank  is  also  supporting  capacity  development  in \nhealth  through  training  for  back-up  health  care  providers,  and  broader  PFM.  The  program \nimplementation period is from June 2020 to September 2021. Grant proceeds will be withdrawn \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \nGovernance. Although the RMI has a strong record of sound fiscal management (para. \n27. \n7), critical PFM issues remain to be addressed. A public expenditure and financial accountability \nassessment in 2012 identified structural weaknesses, including: (i) significant variations between \nplanned  and  actual  expenditures,  particularly  in  line  ministries;  (ii) large  segments  of  public \nspending that are not captured in budget documents; (iii) loose linkages between planning and \nbudgeting; (iv) systems and capacity constraints in tax administration; (v) limited availability of in-\nyear  budget  execution  reports;  and  (vi) limited  follow-up  of  internal  audit  findings  and \nrecommendations.40 The findings informed the government\u2019s RMI PFM Reform Roadmap, 2014\u2013\n2016,  which  covered  30  broad  reform  areas. 41 However,  the  sheer  volume  of  public  sector \nreforms for implementation stretched MOF capacity. Since 2017, an ADB-financed PFM project \n(footnote  22)  has  provided  long-term  capacity  supplementation  within  the  MOF  to  update  the \nroadmap and develop a sequenced and prioritized action plan. Improvements have been made \nin  the  PFM  policy  and  legal  framework,  national  government  budgeting  and  local  government \nfinancial management, cash and payroll management, and oversight of state-owned enterprises. \nA fiscal responsibility and debt management bill has been introduced in Parliament. Once enacted \ninto law and implemented effectively, this should help further strengthen PFM and complement \nongoing  governance  reforms  supported  by  ADB  and  other  partners.  Nonetheless,  the  RMI \nremains  a  fragile  state  with  structural  constraints  and  thin  capacities  for  effective  governance. \nThus,  further  interventions  in  the  RMI  need  to  be  anchored  on  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  ongoing \nregional  TA  supporting  effective  and  sustainable  delivery  of  development  results  in  fragile \nsituations in the Pacific.42 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was discussed \nwith the government, including the MOF and NDC. \n \nPoverty  and  inequality.  The  RMI\u2019s  level  of  gross  national  income  per  capita  places  it \n28. \nwithin the World Bank\u2019s upper-middle income country classification, but elevated cost structures\u2014\n\n \n\n39 Gender Monitoring Matrix (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n40 Government  of  the  Marshall  Islands.  2012.

An  assessment  of  socioeconomic \nvulnerability in the RMI conducted by ADB in 2015 estimated that 38.4% of the population falls \nbelow the basic needs poverty line, down from 51.1% in 2002.43 Although no recent estimate of \nthe  Gini  coefficient  is  available,  the  2011  census  shows  that  median  household  incomes  in \nKwajalein and Majuro were more than 10 times higher than in Ebon and Lae, the poorest atoll \ncommunities mainly relying on subsistence.44 ADB estimates that a cumulative 11.7% increase \nin real per capita incomes during  FY2015\u2013FY2019 reduced the poverty rate further to 29.4%\u2013\n31.6% just before the COVID-19 crisis, but the projected 7.6% contraction in incomes can raise \nthe poverty rate to 33.8%\u201335.2% by the end of FY2021.45 The crisis threatens to wind back the \ngains from recent solid economic performance. Social impacts will be most severe for households \nthat derive income from businesses that are directly affected by prevailing travel restrictions. \n \n29. \nEconomic relief to businesses will provide the needed cash to maintain operations and \nminimize job displacement. The inclusion of small businesses and informal workers will prevent \nfurther marginalization of these groups who lack alternative sources of income. Populations in the \nneighboring islands have limited access to food supplies, especially during crisis. Ensuring food \nsecurity through food rations and distribution of farming and fishing tools will maintain the quantity \nand quality of food intake. This will protect the welfare of vulnerable groups such as children, the \nelderly, people with disabilities, and those with preexisting health conditions. The continuation of \nthe  government\u2019s  school  lunch  program  will  help  students  avoid  malnutrition.  Training  for \nvulnerable youth will improve their employability once the economy recovers.   \n \n30. \nGender.  The  program  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  COVID-19 \ncrisis has the potential to exacerbate existing gender inequalities and risk the progress that has \nbeen made in supporting women\u2019s economic empowerment.46 The program supports women\u2019s \nhealth, safety, and economic empowerment. Health and safety measures include: continuation of \nfree health care, including maternal and reproductive health; priority COVID-19 testing for frontline \nhealth workers; refresher training for frontline health workers on the use of PPE; and staff trainings \non  the  prevention  of  sexual  harassment  in  quarantine  shelters.47 Economic  measures  include: \nassistance to women-owned businesses; ensuring all public servants (of which 31% are women) \ncontinue to be employed; and  training  predominantly women  in producing fabric facemasks to \nsupport the health care system. Relief measures will also be open to informal workers who are \nparticularly vulnerable and may not have the savings, networks, or other safety nets to support \nthem  during  the  downturn  in  business  activity.  To  support  vulnerable  populations,  measures \ninclude:  monthly  food  baskets  to  women-headed  households  in  neighboring  island  and  atoll \ncommunities;  distribution  of  dignity  kits,  which  include  locally  sewn  and  procured  reusable \n\n \n\n43 Government of Marshall Islands, Economic Policy, Planning, and Statistics Office. 2002.

A low proportion of working-age women \nown or run businesses (8%), but they represent 44% of business owners in the RMI. Many of the women-owned \nbusinesses operate in sectors most impacted by COVID-19 such as tourism, services, and retail. Although the gender \nwage gap in the RMI narrowed to 10.5% in 2017 (from 26.7% in 2011), the economic downturn from the pandemic \nmay reverse this, potentially placing more women at greater risk of poverty and food insecurity. \n\n47 Noncommunicable diseases remain a leading cause of death in the country. Despite improvements in recent years, \nthere  is  a  high  teenage  pregnancy  rate  and  low  numbers  of  women  attending  prenatal  care  appointments. \nThis highlights the critical need to ensure that essential services, particularly maternal and reproductive health care, \ncontinue during health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\nmenstrual products and fabric facemasks; a new national gender-based violence hotline; and new \nstandard  operating  procedures  developed  for  domestic  violence  services  during  lockdown. 48 \nFinally, women\u2019s unpaid care burden is reduced by the continuation of the school lunch program.  \n \nSafeguards.

Given the RMI\u2019s \nheightened vulnerability to disasters and climate \nchange, a concurrent adverse shock will \nexacerbate the economic and social impacts of \nthe ongoing COVID-19 crisis.  \nInstitutional capacities for effective \ngovernance stretched too thin. \nDemands for active government response on \nseveral fronts can expose fragilities in public \nsector capacities. \n\nMitigation Measures \nThe  government  is  building  the  health  system\u2019s  surveillance \nand response capacity by constructing new COVID-19 testing \nlaboratories,  isolation  rooms,  and  quarantine  facilities  to \nprevent community transmission of the virus. \nADB  has  worked  with  the  government  to  establish  a  new \ncontingent  disaster  financing  instrument,  through  the  third \nphase  of  the  regional  Pacific  Disaster  Resilience  Program. \nThis  will  provide  quick-disbursing \nfinance  during  any \nsubsequent disaster or health emergency.  \nGiven the RMI\u2019s classification as a fragile situation, capacity \nsupplementation and technical assistance from development \npartners  are  actively  supplementing  government  capacities. \nThis  includes  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  public  financial  management \nproject and technical assistance focusing on gender equity. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, RMI = Republic of the Marshall Islands. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n33. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, financial management, and disbursement as described \nin detail in the grant agreement. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n34. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the grant not exceeding \n$16,000,000 to the Republic of the Marshall Islands from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian \nDevelopment Fund) for the Health Expenditure and Livelihoods Support Program, on terms and \nconditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement \npresented to the Board. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n\n \n\n \n19 November 2020\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n48 As of 2011, female-headed households had, on average, 41% less in monthly income than male-headed households \nand were therefore more likely to face poverty. Increased poverty may make it difficult for women and girls to access \nmenstrual hygiene products. One in two women in the RMI have experienced physical or sexual violence by a partner \nduring  their  lifetime  and  the  prevalence  and  severity  of  gender-based  violence  is  likely  to  increase  during  crisis \nperiods.  \n\n49 ADB. 2009.

Results for these \nindicators, and/or other relevant ones for which data are available, will be identified at a later stage and reported in \nthe program completion report. \n\ne  Household rapid vulnerability assessments for Majuro and Ebeye covered 2,774 and 772 households, respectively. \nAlong  with  an  estimated  2,380  households  in  neighboring  islands  and  atolls,  this  places  the  total  number  of \nsurveyable households at 5,926, of which 1% is about 593 households.  \n\nf    Economic  relief  checks  are  provided  to  enterprises  based  on  the  estimated  adverse  impact  of  COVID-19  travel \n\nrestrictions on business turnover (as gauged from tax filings) over a 6-month period. \n\ng  Women-owned businesses are formally defined as enterprises that are at least 51% owned, operated, and controlled \n\non a day-to-day basis by one or more women entrepreneurs. \n\nh  Household rapid vulnerability assessments identified 839 vulnerable households in Majuro and Ebeye, of which 38 \n\nare considered the most vulnerable. Dignity kits will also be distributed in quarantine and isolation facilities.  \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n17 \n\n \n\n \n\nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/RRPs/?id=54358-001-2  \n\nGrant Agreement \nDevelopment Coordination \nCountry Economic Indicators \nInternational Monetary Fund Assessment Letter \nSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \nRisk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \nList of Ineligible Items \nDebt Sustainability Analysis \nGender Monitoring Matrix \n\n \n1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n6. \n7. \n8. \n9. \n \nSupplementary Documents \n10.

Adverse impact of exogenous \nshock \n\nThe  Republic  of  the  Marshall  Islands  (RMI)  economy  is \nseen to contract by 5.5% in FY2020 (ends 30 September \n2020)  and  a  further  1.4%  in  FY2021.  Global  travel \nrestrictions and quarantine requirements resulting from the \nCOVID-19 pandemic are adversely affecting the fisheries \n(with a share of about 11% of GDP), hotels and restaurants \n(2%), and transport sectors (7%).  \n\nOperations  of  a  domestic  fleet  of  purse  seine  fishing \nvessels,  as  well  as  a  tuna  loining  plant  in  Majuro,  are \nestimated  to  decline  by  about  30%  in  FY2020  and \nexpected  to  remain  subdued  in  FY2021.  Exports  of \naquarium fish have also declined by half.  \n\nFurther,  a  requirement  for  fishing  and  carrier  vessels  to \nspend  at  least  14  days  at  sea  (including  travel)  prior  to \nentry is limiting transshipment activity in Majuro port\u2014the \nworld\u2019s  busiest  tuna  transshipment  hub.  Transshipment \nservices associated with the export of sashimi-grade tuna \nare trending lower by 50%.  \n\nAlso,  with  no  visitor  arrivals  since  March  2020,  the  two \nmain hotels have been virtually empty around half of the \nfiscal year, while restaurants and retail shops have seen \ncustomers  decline  by  at  least  half.  Government  tax \ncollections  are  estimated  to  have  declined  by  4.1%  in \nFY2020.  \n\nThe decline in economic activity is projected to lead to a \nloss of over 700 jobs through to end-FY2021, with over a \nthird  of  these  losses  likely  to  affect  women  employees. \nThis will be, by far, the largest reduction in employment in \nthe RMI in more than two decades. As a result, the basic \nneeds  poverty  rate  is  at  risk  of  increasing  from  its \nestimated FY2019 level of between 29.4% and 31.6% of \nhouseholds to a range of 33.8%\u201335.2% by end-FY2021. \n\nIn June 2020, the government finalized the $45.8 million \n(equivalent \nto  21.0%  of  GDP)  RMI  Coronavirus \nPreparedness and Response Plan. It comprises a health \nsector  component,  an  economic  relief  and  recovery \ncomponent, and a food security component:  \n\n\u2022  The health component ($21.1 million) details and \ncosts  necessary  measures  primarily  to  upgrade \ncapacities  for  screening  and  testing;  strengthen \ninfection  prevention  and  control;  and  establish \ncase  management  protocols.

Countercyclical development \nexpenditure \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nAccess criteria \n\nADB Staff Assessment \n\nthe  government  has  spent  about  $9.5  million  for \nmedical  equipment  and  supplies,  as  well  as \npreparation  of  additional  isolation  and  quarantine \nfacilities. To safeguard the welfare of women and \ngirls in quarantine facilities, provisions are made for \ndistributing  dignity  kits  and  conducting  staff \ntrainings on the prevention of sexual harassment.  \n \n\nconsideration \n\n\u2022  For economic relief and recovery ($12.4 million), \nthe  plan  provides  for  financial  assistance  to \nbusinesses in Majuro and Kwajalein affected by the \ntravel  restrictions.  Further  assistance  measures \nunder \ninclude:  provision  of \nnecessary protective equipment and safe transport \narrangements  for  workers  to  ensure  continuity  of \nbusiness  activity  in  critical  sectors  including  food \nand  emergency  supplies;  financing  low-interest \nlocal  employers;  and \nbusiness \nestablishing  a  utilities  discount  program \nfor \naffected businesses and households.  \n \n\nloans \n\nto \n\n\u2022  The  plan  also  safeguards  well-being  of \nvulnerable communities ($8.3 million), including \nthose in the RMI\u2019s neighboring islands and atolls, \nor  more  remote  communities  outside  the  major \npopulation  centers  of  Ebeye  and  Majuro. \nThis includes  delivery  of  monthly  food  baskets  to \neach household as well as provision of farming and \nfishing implements to every community.  \n\nIn  September  2020,  the  plan  was  updated  to  secure \nsustained  funding  for  the  Ministry  of  Education\u2019s  feeding \nprogram that provides school lunch meals to students from \npoor  families.  The  updated  plan  allocates  a  further  $3.5 \nmillion  for  providing  school  lunches  five  days  a  week  to \nabout 11,300 children nationwide. \n \nThe  plan  also  budgets  $4.0  million  to  continue  essential \nservices,  including  utilities,  as  well  as  for  consular \nassistance  and  possible  evacuation  of  citizens  stranded \nabroad.

Pre-shock record of generally \nsound macroeconomic \nmanagement \n\nThe  government \nfiscal  surpluses \nrecorded  annual \naveraging 3.4% of GDP from FY2014 to FY2018. Recent \nsharp  increases  in  fishing  license  revenue  collections \ncontributed  the  most  to  a  substantial  improvement  in \ndomestic resource mobilization. On the expenditure side, \nprogress has been achieved in controlling the public sector \nwage bill, which has declined in proportion to GDP to an \naverage  of  21.6%  during  FY2015\u2013FY2019  from  23.0% \nduring the preceding decade.  \n\nThe fiscal account swung into a deficit equivalent to about \n2.2% of GDP in FY2019. Contributing to the deficit were \ntransfers to copra producers (i.e., de facto social welfare \nprovided to individual producers through Tobolar, a state-\nowned copra trading company) and the social security fund \n(in support of a broader reform package approved in 2016 \nto move the fund toward a financially sustainable position), \nas  well  as  increased  expenditure  to  contain  a  dengue \noutbreak.  \n\nThe pre-COVID-19 budget targeted a more than halving of \nthe  deficit  in  FY2020  to  quickly  contain  fiscal  pressures. \nThe  original  FY2020  budget  targeted  further  growth  in \ndomestic revenue while containing recurrent expenditure, \nparticularly transfers to the social security fund.  \n\nFurther, the RMI has built up its Compact Trust Fund (CTF) \nfrom $240.1 million in FY2014 to $518.6 million by August \n2020. Pre-COVID-19 accumulation trends indicate that the \nCTF  will  likely  reach  a  target  level  that  will  generate \nsufficient  annual  investment  earnings  to  offset  expiring \nCompact grants after FY2023 while preserving the nominal \nvalue of assets. The September 2018 assessment of the \nInternational  Monetary \nhowever, \nrecommended  further  fiscal  consolidation  to  allow  for \npreservation of the CTF in real terms post-FY2023.   \n\n(IMF), \n\nFund \n\nThe  RMI  has \nresponse measures including:  \n\nimplemented  pre-emptive  COVID-19 \n\n(i)  expanded  monitoring  by  the  Health  Emergency \nOperations Center\u2014activated since July 2019 due \nto  a  dengue  outbreak  and  later  to  monitor  a \npossible  measles  outbreak\u2014to  also \ninclude \nCOVID-19  surveillance,  following  the  President\u2019s \ndeclaration  of  a  State  of  Health  Emergency  in \nearly-February; \n\n(ii)  travel restrictions on travelers from affected areas \nas early as January 2020 followed by full border \nclosure since early-March;  \n\n(iii) preparation  of  COVID-19  laboratories  in  Majuro \nand Ebeye, a special 8-room isolation ward at the \nMajuro hospital, as well as quarantine sites at the \n\n \n\n4. Structural reforms \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nAccess criteria \n\nADB Staff Assessment \n\nArrak campus of the College of Marshall Islands in \nMajuro  and  the  Kwajalein  military  base  near \nEbeye; and  \n\n(iv) COVID-19  awareness  activities  (e.g.,  community \nmeetings,  regular  updates  by  the  Minister  of \nHealth broadcast through television and radio, and \nactivation of a COVID-19 hotline for Majuro).  \n\nHealth systems strengthening is also ongoing through the \ncontinuing procurement of personal protective equipment, \ntest  kits,  as  well  as  ventilators  and  other  medical \nequipment. The Ministry of Health and Human Services is \nconducting  targeted  on-site  COVID-19  testing  for  those \nexhibiting mild symptoms of respiratory illnesses. \n\nPublic  debt  has  declined  steadily  from  the  equivalent  of \n85.2% of GDP in FY2000 to 31.5% by FY2019. Although \nthe IMF rates the RMI as facing a high risk of debt distress, \nthis  stems  primarily  from  fiscal  pressures  from  the \nimpending  expiration  of  the  economic  provisions  of  the \nCompact  in  FY2023  as  well  as  the  potential  impacts  of \ndisasters over the longer-term, not from any unsustainable \nborrowing practices.  \n\nThe government has no intention to borrow and is instead \nseeking grant assistance from the country\u2019s development \npartners to fill financing needs arising from the COVID-19 \ncrisis, so the public debt-to-GDP ratio is seen to maintain \nits steady downward trend over the medium-term.  \n\nGrant assistance through the proposed CPRO will help the \nRMI  forego  higher-cost  (even  if  concessional)  borrowing \nand the ADB DSA therefore concludes that public debt will \nremain sustainable over the long-term.  \n\nADB  is  closely  coordinating  with  the  IMF  on  the  macro-\nfiscal framework for the RMI. The IMF\u2019s Assessment Letter \nwill confirm ADB\u2019s views on: (i) the RMI\u2019s pre-shock record \nof generally sound macroeconomic management; and (ii)  \na medium-term downward path for public debt\u2013GDP with \neconomic recovery and given the availability of sufficient \ngrant resources from development partners supporting the \nRMI Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Plan. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, CPRO = COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option, \nCTF  =  Compact  Trust  Fund,  DSA  =  debt  sustainability  analysis,  FY  =  fiscal  year,  GDP  =  gross  domestic  product,  \nIMF = International Monetary Fund, RMI = Republic of the Marshall Islands. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n5.
