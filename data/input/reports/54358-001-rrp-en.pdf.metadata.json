THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) for the Health Expenditure and Livelihoods Support \n(HEALS) Program under the Countercyclical Support Facility COVID-19 Pandemic Response \nOption (CPRO).1 \n \n2.  The  HEALS  program  will  support  the  government\u2019s  response  to  the  potentially \ncatastrophic health and economic impacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), anchored by \nits $45.8 million COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan.2 The government is implementing \na comprehensive response package that covers (i) strengthening the health system\u2019s capacity for \nenhanced surveillance, infection control, and potential case management; (ii) providing economic \nrelief  and  recovery  assistance  to  businesses  adversely  affected  by  the  prevailing  travel \nrestrictions; and (iii) mitigating impacts on the RMI\u2019s most vulnerable communities, all within the \ncontext of a sound and sustainable fiscal framework. The RMI meets all the access criteria for the \nCPRO as summarized in Table 1 (detailed in Appendix 4). \n \nTable 1: HEALS Program Compliance with CPRO Access Criteria \nCPRO Access Criteria  ADB Assessment \n1.  Adverse impact of  ADB estimates that the RMI\u2019s economy contracted by 5.5% in FY2020 with a further 1.4% \nexogenous shock  decline projected for FY2021. COVID-19 entry restrictions are adversely affecting the \nfisheries, hotels and restaurants, and transport sectors. The government\u2019s fiscal gap also \nwidened to 4.7% of GDP in FY2020 from 2.2% in FY2019, with additional financing needs \nof 15.0% of GDP projected for FY2021. ADB projects that more than 700 jobs (about 28% \nheld by women) will likely be lost by the end of FY2021\u2014the largest employment \nreduction in more than 2 decades. The basic needs poverty rate is at risk of rising from \nan estimated 29.4%\u201331.6% of households in FY2019 to 33.8%\u201335.2% by end\u2013FY2021.   \n2.  Countercyclical  In June 2020, the government first approved the RMI Coronavirus Preparedness and \ndevelopment  Response Plan which was updated in September to cover $45.8 million (equivalent to \nexpenditure  21.0% of GDP) in priority spending. For health care, the plan includes measures to \nupgrade  capacities  for  screening  and  testing  for  COVID-19;  strengthen  infection \nprevention and control; and establish case management protocols. For economic relief \nand recovery, financial assistance will be provided to businesses affected by the travel \nrestrictions. To safeguard vulnerable communities, monthly food baskets will be delivered \nto households along with fishing and farming tools. A gender-based violence hotline will \nbe supported, as well as school lunches.    \n3.  Pre-shock record  The RMI recorded 5 consecutive years of growth averaging 2.9% during FY2015\u2013\nof generally sound  FY2019, while keeping inflation low at \u20130.6% per annum. The country achieved annual \nmacroeconomic  fiscal surpluses averaging 3.4% of GDP from FY2014\u2013FY2018, with revenue collections \nmanagement  rising from 23.6% of GDP to 32.2% during this period. A fiscal deficit of 2.2% of GDP was \nrecorded in FY2019 because of transfers to copra producers and the social security fund. \nThe pre\u2013COVID-19 FY2020 budget targeted cutting the deficit by half to contain fiscal \npressures. Furthermore, the RMI has built up its Compact Trust Fund from $240.1 million \nin FY2014 to $518.6 million in August 2020. \n4.  Structural reforms  The  RMI  has  implemented  preemptive  COVID-19  response  measures  including: \n(i) expanded monitoring by the Health Emergency Operations Center\u2014activated since \nJuly 2019 because of a dengue outbreak\u2014to also include COVID-19 surveillance, \nfollowing the President\u2019s declaration of a state of health emergency on 7 February 2020; \n(ii) entry restrictions for travelers from affected areas in January 2020 followed by full \nborder closure since early March; (iii) preparation of COVID-19 laboratories, isolation and \nquarantine sites; and (iv) continuing procurement of medical supplies and equipment. The \nMinistry of Health and Human Services is also preparing immunization reporting systems \nfor post-market surveillance of a potential COVID-19 vaccine. \n \n1  ADB. 2020.

The plan \nwas initially approved in June 2020 to cover $42.3 million in countercyclical development expenditures. It was \nexpanded to include a school lunch program valued at $3.5 million in September 2020.  ", " \n2 \nCPRO Access Criteria  ADB Assessment \n5. Debt sustainability  Public debt has declined from 85.2% of GDP in FY2000 to 31.5% in FY2019. Although \nthe IMF classifies the RMI as facing a high risk of debt distress, this is primarily because \nof medium- to long- term fiscal pressures, including the potential impacts of disasters. \nWith financing needs arising from the COVID-19 crisis largely filled by grants from \ndevelopment partners, the public debt\u2013GDP ratio is not expected to rise. Results of the \nADB debt sustainability analysis show debt to remain sustainable, particularly with \nexpected economic recovery after FY2021. Although the risk of debt distress will remain \nhigh,  this  reflects  medium-  to  long-term  fiscal  pressures,  in  line  with  the  IMF\u2019s \nassessment, and not because of unsustainable borrowing practices. \n6. IMF coordination  ADB is closely coordinating with the IMF on the macro-fiscal framework. The IMF \nAssessment Letter confirms ADB\u2019s views on: (i) the RMI\u2019s pre-shock record of sound \nmacroeconomic management; and (ii) the public debt\u2013GDP ratio resuming a downward \npath with economic recovery after FY2021. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, CPRO = COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option, \nFY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product, HEALS = Health Expenditure and Livelihoods Support, IMF = \nInternational Monetary Fund, RMI = Republic of the Marshall Islands.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Development context. The RMI is a small island developing state in the North Pacific, \nwith a population of about 55,000 and a land area of 181.3 square kilometers. It is vulnerable to \nfrequent disasters, including typhoons and severe drought. Climate change risks are particularly \nheightened, with the RMI being one of the lowest-lying atoll nations in the world. Although the \nRMI has only two confirmed COVID-19 cases as of 6 November 2020, it is expected to suffer \neconomic contractions in FY2020\u2013FY2021, with adverse socioeconomic impacts. 3  \n \n4.  Preemptive measures against COVID-19. Early and decisive action has helped the RMI \navoid a COVID-19 outbreak. Entry restrictions and quarantine requirements for travelers from, or \ntransiting through, COVID-19 affected areas, as well as health screenings for all arrivals by air \nand sea, were implemented starting 24 January 2020. After the World Health Organization (WHO) \ncharacterized the global COVID-19 outbreak as a public health emergency at the end of January, \nthe  President  of  the  RMI  declared  a  state  of  health  emergency  on  7  February  2020. \nThe declaration directed the Ministry of Health and Human Services (MOHHS) to activate its \nemergency operations plan. The Health Emergency Operations Center was directed to expand \nmonitoring and implement COVID-19 preparedness and response measures to minimize the risk \nof importation and possible local transmission. The RMI suspended all commercial travel into the \ncountry on 8 March 2020, even before the WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on \n11 March  2020.4 The  MOHHS  is  conducting  targeted  on-site  COVID-19  testing  for  those \nexhibiting mild symptoms of respiratory illness. The RMI recorded its first two COVID-19 cases \non 28 October 2020. Both are imported cases affecting workers at the United States (US) military \nbase in Kwajalein travelling from Hawaii, with no threat of community transmission.5 \n \n5.  Fragile health care system. The RMI has two hospitals\u2014one in Majuro and the other in \nEbeye\u2014providing primary, secondary, and limited tertiary care, plus 56 health care centers \nacross neighboring island and atoll communities. The health care system has a total capacity of \nabout 150 beds, with 11 intensive care unit beds, and 20 ventilators. Even pre\u2013COVID-19, 79% \n \n3  Both cases were expatriate staff who arrived at the Kwajalein Island military base of the United States, which were \nconfirmed while in quarantine.  \n4  A twice-monthly cargo flight connection with Guam remains in operation, but visits by cruise ships are suspended. \n5  WHO. 2020. Joint incident management team External Situation Report. Suva (as of 28 October 2020). \n ", " \n3 \nof women in urban areas and 94% in rural areas reported difficulties in accessing health care.6 \nBetween March and July 2020, the MOHHS built a special ward in the Majuro hospital with eight \nisolation rooms with negative air flow to expand capacity for critical care. Although non-essential \nservices have been scaled back to allow critically ill or suspected cases to receive care, the \nestimated requirement for hospital beds in the event of local transmission of COVID-19 remains \nover seven times the current capacity.7 Approximately 5% of potential hospitalizations (up to 300 \ncases)  are  expected  to  require  ventilators,  intensive  care  unit  beds,  and  isolation  wards. \nQuarantine sites near Majuro and the Kwajalein base are available for mandatory isolation of \nrepatriated citizens. The density of skilled health professionals is low at 3.76 per 1,000 population \n(only 0.42 medical doctors per 1,000 population), below the Sustainable Development Goal \nminimum threshold of 4.45 per 1,000 population. Most of the health workforce also requires \nadditional training for a pandemic and are at a higher risk of infection, which can rapidly deplete \ncapacity. Women face heightened infection risk not only because they comprise a majority of \nfrontline health workers, but also due to caring responsibilities. The RMI ranks 191st out of 195 \neconomies on the Global Health Security Index, indicating severe limitations in the capacity to \nmanage epidemics or pandemics. The WHO rates the country\u2019s preparedness and response \nstatus as Level 2 (on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 as the best) with a high risk of importing the virus.  \n  \n6.  Narrow-based economy centered on fisheries. Economic performance is largely driven \nby fisheries-related activities, which permeates across sectors. Domestic commercial purse seine \ntuna fishing\u2014plus smaller operations of local producers for home consumption and sale in the \nMajuro fishing market, and of exporters of aquarium fish\u2014provide direct value-added in the \nfisheries sector. A tuna loining plant in Majuro also contributes most of total manufacturing output. \nMajuro is the world\u2019s busiest tuna transshipment port, boosting the transport services sector, and \nproviding ancillary services such as fish containerization, supplies provisioning, and net repair to \n400\u2013500 purse seiners per year pre-pandemic. On the demand side, there has been a sharp rise \nin fishing license revenues. Since the full implementation in 2012 of a vessel day scheme in the \nexclusive economic zones of the Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA), the RMI\u2019s collections of \nfishing license fees have increased to an average of $20.6 million (9.9% of gross domestic product \n[GDP]) during FY2012\u2013FY2019 from $1.6 million (1.1% of GDP) during FY2004\u2013FY2011.8  \n \n7.  Sound macroeconomic management. Supported by strong fisheries performance, the \nRMI recorded 5 consecutive years of growth averaging 2.9% during FY2015\u2013FY2019, following \na slight contraction of 0.9% in FY2014. Increased construction activity, amid scaled-up operations \nof  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  World  Bank,  also  supported  growth. \nThe government achieved annual fiscal surpluses averaging 3.4% of GDP from FY2014 to \nFY2018, in preparation for the scheduled expiration of the economic provisions of the RMI\u2019s \nCompact of Free Association with the US after FY2023. Aided by recent surpluses, the RMI\u2019s \nCompact Trust Fund (CTF) has grown from $240.1 million in FY2014 to $518.6 million by August \n2020. Pre\u2013COVID-19 trends indicate that the CTF will likely reach a level that can generate \nsufficient annual investment earnings to offset expiring compact grants after FY2023, but this is \nstill  subject  to  market  volatilities.9 The  recent  sharp  increases  in  fishing  license  revenues \n \n6  Government of the Marshall Islands, Ministry of Culture and Internal Affairs and Economic Policy, Planning, and \nStatistics Office. 2018. Gender Equality: Where Do We Stand? Republic of the Marshall Islands. Majuro. \n7  Projections based on the RMI\u2019s estimated 2020 population of 54,993; and assumptions that the infection rate is 10% \nwith preparedness measures; 20% of the infected require hospitalization; and 5% of hospitalizations need ventilators. \n8  The combined waters of the Parties to the Nauru Agreement\u2014the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Nauru, \nPalau, Papua New Guinea, the RMI, Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu\u2014yield about 30% of the global tuna catch by \nweight. The shift to a vessel day scheme from previous volume-based regulation of distant water fishing fleets \npromotes sustainability of tuna stocks by limiting fishing while increasing revenues for participating countries. \n9  In August 2019, the United States announced the commencement of negotiations to extend the compact, although \nany grants associated with this remain subject to negotiation.  \n ", " \n4 \ncontributed the most to a substantial improvement in domestic resource mobilization. On the \nexpenditure side, progress has been made in controlling the public sector wage bill, which has \ndeclined to an average of 21.6% of GDP during FY2015\u2013FY2019 from 23.0% during FY2005\u2013\nFY2014. ADB\u2019s regional technical assistance (TA) that supported procurement of a human \nresource management information system for the Public Service Commission helped facilitate \npayroll control.10 Inflation was kept low at \u20130.6% per annum during FY2015\u20132019, with current \naccount surpluses averaging 11% of GDP, reflecting inflows of grants and fishing license fees. \n \n8.  COVID-19 impacts fisheries. Strict travel restrictions and quarantine requirements have \nbeen effective in keeping the RMI free of COVID-19 for more than 6 months since the pandemic \nwas declared, but these have also damaged economic activity.11 Ships that have transited \nthrough COVID-19-affected countries were prohibited from entering the RMI\u2019s ports particularly \nduring the early stages of global travel restrictions, disrupting the fisheries supply chain. Estimates \nshow that both domestic purse seine fishing and tuna loining operations were reduced by about \n30% in FY2020 and are expected to remain below pre\u2013COVID-19 levels in FY2021 (footnote 11). \nA requirement for fishing and carrier vessels to spend at least 14 days at sea (including travel) \nprior to entry is limiting transshipment activity in Majuro port. For example, transshipment services \nassociated with the export of sashimi-grade tuna are trending lower by 50%. Although fishing \nlicense revenues are estimated to have achieved the pre-pandemic projection of $30 million (14% \nof GDP) in FY2020, the potential adverse impact of prolonged travel restrictions on demand for \nvessel days is projected to reduce fishing license fee collections by 13% in FY2021.  \n \n9.  Other transmission channels. Despite having a small tourism base relative to most of \nits Pacific peers, the pause in international arrivals has translated to declines of 95% in hotel \noccupancy, 90% in car rentals, and 50% in restaurant demand, with flow-through impacts on retail \ntrade.  Handicraft  retailers  have  reported  sales  declines  of  up  to  70%  year-on-year. 12 \nThe reduction in international passenger flights from eight per week to only two per month also \nmeans subdued aviation fuel sales, with wholesale fuel operations estimated to have fallen 45%. \n \n10.  Outlook of successive economic contractions. With a prolonged period of restricted \ntravel, and a return to normal movement of people likely pushed back to late-2021, successive \neconomic contractions are projected for the RMI. An independent assessment acknowledged by \nthe Government of the Marshall Islands projects economic contractions of 5.5% in FY2020 and \n1.4% in FY2021 (footnote 11).13 Disruptions to fisheries are expected to be most substantial, \nestimated at \u20131.6 percentage points through this 2-year period. Declines are also projected for \nhotels and restaurants (\u20131.2 percentage points), wholesale and retail trade (\u20131.2 percentage \npoints), and transport through reduced transshipment operations (\u20131.1 percentage points).  \n \n11.  Substantial economic losses. The projected cumulative economic contractions for \nFY2020\u2013FY2021 are on par with the decline in FY2008 amid the global food and fuel price spike. \nThey could roll back 3 years of economic gains and push real per capita incomes below the \nFY2017 level. Shipping delays have also resulted in spoilage of imported fruits, vegetables, dairy \nproducts, and other perishables, affecting food security. The Ministry of Natural Resources and \nCommerce estimates that about 80% of the RMI\u2019s food supply and up to 99% of other consumer \n \n10  ADB. 2020.

Inventories of essential items, including food and sanitation supplies, as of \nmid-March, fell short of levels needed to ensure food security during the pandemic (footnote 12). \n \n12.  Reductions in employment. The projected economic losses are expected to translate to \nthe loss of between 417 and 716 full-time jobs (or 3.6% to 6.1% of formal employment) by the \nend of FY2021.14 The largest employment impacts are expected in the hotels and restaurants \nsector (up to 36% of total job losses) followed by transport and trade (28%). At the tuna loining \nplant, which employed 137 workers as of FY2018, 60 people were already laid off by the early \nstages of travel restrictions as supply chain disruptions led to scaled back operations. There have \nbeen immediate job losses among fishing boat observers, who are tasked with independently \nmonitoring  vessels\u2019  compliance  with  the  PNA\u2019s  vessel  day  scheme  regulations  and  other \nconservation measures. To minimize potential COVID-19 transmission, the PNA decided to \nwithdraw all observers, while ramping up technology-based monitoring, resulting in the temporary \nunemployment of 44 Marshallese observers. As of 2017, social security data suggest that women \ncomprise 32% of formal employment in the RMI, with 93% of employed women in the services \nsector including hotels and restaurants, as well as wholesale and retail trade (footnote 6). \nMore than 200 jobs lost due to the COVID-19 crisis affect women. \n \n13.

Approved by the cabinet in \nJune 2020, then updated in September, the plan details interventions to strengthen capacities for \nhealth  surveillance,  infection  prevention  and  control,  clinical  management  of  cases,  while \nmitigating the pandemic\u2019s economic and social impacts.15 The $45.8 million (21.0% of GDP) plan \nallocates funding across three primary areas: (i) $21.1 million to strengthen health systems; \n(ii) $12.4 million to provide assistance to businesses; and (iii) $8.3 million to safeguard the well-\nbeing of vulnerable communities and households, particularly those in the neighboring islands \nand atolls. An additional $4.0 million is budgeted toward ensuring the continuity of essential \nservices and for consular assistance for citizens abroad. Implementation of the plan started in \nFY2020 and will continue in FY2021, with seven sector clusters activated to coordinate national \nagencies\u2019 responses.16 Grants from the RMI\u2019s development partners\u2014ADB, the European Union, \nthe International Organization for Migration, the World Bank, along with Japan, Taipei,China, and \nthe US\u2014have been identified to finance expenditure needs. \n \n14.  Health sector capacity for COVID-19 preparedness and response ($21.1 million). \nThe largest share of the plan\u2019s budget is directed toward activities and investments to strengthen \nhealth  surveillance  and  provide  surge  capacity  for  health  care.  As  of  September  2020, \nthe government has spent about $9.5 million for medical equipment and supplies, including \npersonal protective equipment (PPE), and facilities upgrades. In addition to the new isolation ward \nin Majuro hospital (para. 5), new COVID-19 testing laboratories have been installed in Majuro and \nEbeye and a third quarantine facility has been prepared on Gugeegue Island near Ebeye. \nThe MOHHS is also preparing immunization reporting systems for post-market surveillance of a \npotential COVID-19 vaccine. To safeguard ports of entry and eventually facilitate less restricted \nshipping activity, the plan supports providing training and materials for infection prevention and \ncontrol (e.g., proper use of PPE, decontamination, waste management) as well as building \ntemporary quarantine shelters at Majuro and Ebeye ports. For neighboring island and atoll \ncommunities, the plan allocates funding for: (i) adding storage units to 65 health dispensaries; \n(ii) COVID-19 preparedness mobile teams to conduct facility assessments and trainings on health \n \n14  Estimates are based on references in footnotes 11 and 12. \n15  Social protection aspects of the plan are summarized in Summary of Social Protection Measures in Government\u2019s \nCOVID-19 Response Package (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16  The seven sector clusters under the plan are: agriculture and food security; education; gender and protection; health; \ninfrastructure; shelter; and water, sanitation, and hygiene.  \n ", " \n6 \nprotocols; (iii) procurement of test kits, PPE, medical supplies, and disinfectants; and (iv) potential \nreferral of patients to Majuro or Ebeye. The plan also provides for improvements in water, \nsanitation, and hygiene facilities, particularly in schools and community handwashing stations, \nto boost infection prevention and control. Funding is also allocated for purchasing cleaning \nsupplies, sanitizers, disinfectants, and personal hygiene kits for use in quarantine and isolation \nfacilities. To safeguard the welfare of women and girls in these facilities, provisions are made to \ndistribute dignity kits and conduct staff training programs on the prevention of sexual harassment. \n \n15.  Economic relief for affected businesses ($12.4 million).17 In June 2020, the cabinet \napproved a $6 million economic relief program providing financial assistance to businesses \naffected by COVID-19 travel restrictions. The relief program is wide-ranging, targeting tourism-\nrelated businesses\u2014hotels, restaurants, travel and shipping agents, and handicraft shops\u2014but is \nalso open to any enterprise that can show proof of adverse impacts. As of mid-October, grants \nhave been provided to 58 local businesses, with more than 40 additional applications under \nreview. Grant amounts have ranged from $2,000 to $50,000 and is based on the estimated \nadverse impact of COVID-19 travel restrictions on business turnover (as gauged from tax filings) \nover a 6-month period. Beneficiaries have included small and informal businesses, which are \nprovided a flat rate of $900 for 6 months in the absence of financial documentation. The plan also \nallocates funds to facilitate local supply chains for fabric facemasks, hospital gowns and beddings, \nand virgin coconut oil that will mostly benefit women producers. A further $6.4 million is allocated \nto support business continuity and facilitate quicker recovery of operations. Options under \nconsideration include support for employers to provide necessary protective equipment and \ntransport arrangements (in line with social distancing protocols) that will allow staff to return safely \nto work. Also, the proposed creation of a utilities discount program and provision of guaranteed \nor low-interest loans to employers can help businesses stave off bankruptcy and allow for a \nsmoother recovery in operations when travel restrictions are eventually phased out.  \n \n16.  Well-being of vulnerable communities and households ($8.3 million). The plan places \nparticular emphasis on promoting well-being across the remote and vulnerable communities in \nthe 22 neighboring islands and atolls outside of Majuro and Kwajalein. To safeguard food security, \nprovisions are in place to deliver monthly food baskets to about 2,380 households over at least a \n6-month period. Fishing and farming implements will also be distributed to communities to support \nsubsistence  production  and  enable  greater  self-reliance.  Household  rapid  vulnerability \nassessments supported by the International Organization for Migration helped identify the most \nvulnerable households in Majuro and Ebeye.18 The government is using the results to calibrate \nits  response  and  target  assistance  to  identified  households.  A  new  national  gender-based \nviolence telephone hotline has also been activated to help address a possible increase in cases \nof abuse during the current crisis. In September 2020, the plan was updated to secure sustained \nfunding for the Ministry of Education\u2019s feeding program that provides school lunch meals to \nstudents from poor families. The updated plan allocates an additional $3.5 million to expand the \nprogram and provide school lunches to about 11,300 children nationwide 5 days per week. \nProvisions for continuing children\u2019s education (e.g., learning kits) are also prioritized.   \n \n17.  Social assistance for vulnerable groups. Outside of the plan, the government has also \ncommitted to sustaining adequate funding for the RMI\u2019s ongoing social protection programs\u2014\n \n17 Relief for businesses complements the provision of unemployment benefits to affected workers through the US \nPandemic Unemployment Assistance and Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation programs. Citizens of \nthe RMI are eligible for these programs, with US assistance coursed through the RMI Labor Division. \n18 Government of the Marshall Islands. 2020.

The main target \nbeneficiaries are vulnerable youth who lack or have very little formal education. The Life Skills \nAcademy provides training on gardening, woodworking, sewing, food preparation, and crafts to \nstudents who are not able to continue secondary education. Funding to continue providing free \nmaternal and reproductive health services is likewise ring-fenced. As part of the social insurance \nscheme in the country, employed persons in both public and private sectors are entitled to \nretirement benefits, disability insurance benefits, surviving spouse insurance benefits, surviving \nchild insurance benefits, and lump-sum benefits. There has been no disruption in the regular \npension, with the Marshall Islands Social Security Administration administering the funds. \n \n18.  COVID-19 preparedness and response adds to fiscal pressures. Although the RMI\u2019s \nfiscal position weakened in FY2019 to a deficit equivalent to about 2.2% of GDP because of \ntransfers to copra producers and the social security fund, the pre\u2013COVID-19 budget for FY2020 \ntargeted more than halving the deficit to quickly contain fiscal pressures. However, with COVID-\n19, the fiscal position is projected to deteriorate further through FY2021 (Table 2). Tax collections \nare estimated to have declined by 4.1% in nominal terms in FY2020, as subdued business activity \nresulted in a substantial shortfall in gross revenue taxes. While fishing license revenues remained \nbroadly stable in FY2020, these are projected to decline by up to $4 million in FY2021 as the \ndemand for vessel days weakens amid prolonged travel restrictions (para. 8). On the expenditure \nside, an estimated $12.5 million ($10.3 million from grants) of the additional spending detailed in \nthe updated plan was implemented in FY2020, leaving $33.3 million for execution in FY2021 to \ncomplete the plan\u2019s 2-year implementation period (para. 13).  \n \nTable 2: Selected Fiscal and Economic Indicators  \n(% of GDP, unless otherwise stated) \nItem  FY2016  FY2017  FY2018  FY2019e  FY2020e  FY2021p \nReal GDP growth (% change)  1.3   4.1   3.6   3.8   (5.5)  (1.4) \nInflation (% annual average)  (1.5)   0.0    0.8    0.1    0.3    0.5   \nCentral government budget \n  Total revenue  61.0   68.4   62.6   63.1   67.8   67.8  \n    Tax revenue  14.4   14.3   14.5   18.1   18.3   18.9  \n    Nontax revenue  17.2   23.4   17.7   12.6   14.7   12.9  \n    Grants  29.5   30.7   30.4   32.4   34.9   35.9  \n  Total expenditure  57.1   64.0   60.1   65.3   72.5   82.8  \n    Recurrent  54.0   57.9   55.5   56.4   60.1   69.1  \n      % of which wages and salaries  21.1   21.5   21.8   21.0   22.2   22.5  \n    Capital  3.1   6.1   4.6   8.9   12.4   13.7  \n  Fiscal balance  3.9   4.4   2.5   (2.2)  (4.7)  (15.0) \nPublic debt  44.1   39.2   35.2   31.5   30.6   28.4  \n   % of which is external debt  44.1   39.2   35.2   31.5   30.6   28.4  \nNominal GDP ($ million)  200.6   212.9   221.3   230.0   218.0   216.0  \n( ) = negative, e = estimate, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product, p = projection. \nSources: Asian Development Outlook database; and Graduate School USA. 2020.

Proposed Program, Impacts, and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n19.  The program\u2019s impact will be: the RMI\u2019s capability to respond to and recover from the \nCOVID-19 pandemic\u2019s social and economic impacts strengthened (footnote 2). The program\u2019s \noutcome will be reduced adverse impacts of the pandemic on individuals and communities. \n \n19 Existing programs that will receive continuing funding are summarized in Summary of Existing Social Protection \nPrograms by the Government (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", " \n8 \nThe program will support the government\u2019s COVID-19 preparedness and response through the \nfollowing  outputs:  (i) the  health  system\u2019s  COVID-19  preparedness  and  response  capacities \nstrengthened; (ii) economic relief for adversely affected businesses and workers delivered; and \n(iii) the well-being of vulnerable communities and populations supported. The program will also \nhelp to ensure the continuity of essential government services and employment. The program is \naligned with the focus of the Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020\u2014ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy \nfor the 11 small Pacific developing member countries, including the RMI\u2014on managing risks from \nexternal shocks, including by improving health and social protection services.20 The program is \nalso aligned with Strategy 2030\u2019s operational priorities of addressing remaining poverty and \nreducing inequality, accelerating progress in gender equality, and strengthening governance and \ninstitutional capacity.21 There was due consideration for designing the assistance in a fragile \ncontext-sensitive manner to ensure strong implementation, monitoring, and reporting. \n \n20.  ADB\u2019s value addition. Previous and ongoing ADB operations in the RMI emphasize the \ncritical need to promote longer-term fiscal and economic sustainability to allow for increased \nresilience to adverse shocks. In the aftermath of the global financial and economic crisis, a series \nof ADB policy-based operations provided timely budget support while also progressing some key \nreforms to control recurrent spending and improve the tax effort.22 Since 2017, ADB\u2019s public \nfinancial management (PFM) project has provided sustained in-country capacity supplementation \nat the Ministry of Finance (MOF), particularly in refining and implementing the public sector reform \nagenda.23 At the sector level, a project to improve the power distribution network in Majuro also \nincludes a component to improve the financial and operational sustainability of the energy utility.24 \n \n21.  To  comprehensively  support  the  RMI\u2019s  COVID-19  preparedness  and  response, \nADB\u2019s assistance involves synergies across various modalities. In April 2020, ADB disbursed \n$370,000 in grants from the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund to support the immediate \nresponse,  followed  by  another  $6  million  under  the  Pacific  Disaster  Resilience  Program \n(Phase 2), shortly after the scope of contingent disaster financing instruments was expanded to \ncover health-related emergencies (footnote 1).25 In addition, ADB TA is funding the procurement \nof COVID-19 test kits, PPE, and other medical supplies amounting to about $585,000.26 The RMI \nreceived an additional $630,000 in grants from the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund in August \nfollowing additional financing from the Government of Japan, and an additional $104,960 under \nan urban services project readiness facility in September to support distribution of PPE and \ncommunity  outreach  in  Ebeye. 27 ADB  TA  also  supported  refinement  of  the  macro-fiscal \nframework  to  estimate  FY2020  and  FY2021  financing  needs  more  comprehensively.28 To \nsafeguard against any potential disasters during this critical crisis period, ADB worked with the \ngovernment to establish a new contingent disaster financing instrument. To facilitate the RMI\u2019s \nrecovery from the COVID-19 crisis, ADB\u2019s assistance during FY2021\u2013FY2023 will focus on \nsustaining critical capacity supplementation with additional financing for the PFM project (para. \n \n20 ADB. 2016.

Lessons learned. The program applies lessons from ADB\u2019s experience in providing \neconomic recovery support programs across the Pacific during the 2008\u20132009 global financial \nand economic crisis (including footnote 22).30 These programs demonstrated the critical need to \nsupport aggregate demand while safeguarding the fiscal position through prioritized and well-\ntargeted public expenditure programs. The HEALS Program\u2019s focus on health aims to avoid a \npotential collapse in domestic demand that can occur with a direct COVID-19 outbreak in the RMI. \nSupport for food security and assistance to affected employers will help facilitate a more rapid \neconomic recovery, which will drive a quick return to fiscal sustainability after the crisis. The RMI \nis classified by ADB as a fragile situation with thin capacities for effective governance.31 Previous \nADB TA in the country highlights the need to address acute capacity constraints, particularly when \nimplementing ambitious and wide-ranging government programs (as is the case with COVID-19 \npreparedness and response).32 To supplement implementation capacity, particularly for targeting \nand monitoring of assistance, ADB is mobilizing regional TA supporting social protection and \ngender equality.33 ADB\u2019s ongoing PFM project also contributes to the delivery of the government\u2019s \nplanned COVID-19 response package.    \n \n23.  Development coordination. The program complements grant assistance contributed by \ndevelopment  partners  for  the  RMI\u2019s  preparedness  and  response  plan.  These  include: \n(i) $12.3 million from the US through its Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act as \nwell  as  various  programs  under  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  and  the \nDepartment of Education; (ii) $2.7 million from the European Union, mainly for food security; \n(iii) $2.5 million from the World Bank through an emergency assistance project that supports on-\nisland laboratory COVID-19 testing; (iv) $1.2 million in medical supplies from Taipei,China, \nincluding polymerase chain reaction testing machines, infrared thermometers and medical masks; \nand (v) $0.3 million from Japan in critical medical, water and sanitation, and hygiene supplies.34 \nThe RMI is also coordinating with the US on an eventual COVID-19 vaccination program to help \nreopen the economy when a vaccine becomes available. The WHO provides support to the RMI \nthrough a representative office in Fiji and a liaison office in the Federated States of Micronesia. \nThe program is also developed in close coordination with the IMF through regular information \nsharing to ensure that the program helps safeguard broad macroeconomic stability during the \ncrisis. The IMF agrees with ADB\u2019s views on the RMI\u2019s pre-shock record of sound macroeconomic \nmanagement, as well as on a medium-term downward path for public debt\u2013GDP with economic \nrecovery from  the  current  COVID-19  crisis. Further,  the IMF  recommends  continued  fiscal \nconsolidation to preserve the CTF in real terms post-FY2023.  \n \nC.  Development Financing Needs, Budget Support, and Debt Sustainability \n \n24.  The economic and fiscal impacts of COVID-19 travel restrictions are estimated to have \nresulted in a fiscal gap of $10.3 million (equivalent to 4.7% of GDP) in FY2020 that was bridged \nthrough grant assistance. ADB projects the government\u2019s financing needs will rise to $32.3 million \n \n29  ADB. 2018. Regional: Systems Strengthening for Effective Coverage of New Vaccines in the Pacific Project.

During FY2020, the RMI received $20.5 million in COVID-19 grants and spent an estimated $10.3 million to support \ninterventions in its Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Plan. Unspent funds amounting to $10.2 million were \ndeposited by the government (hence the negative financing entry for FY2020) for continuing implementation of the \nplan during FY2021. \n2. \u201cADB: Other grants\u201d includes $6.0 million disbursed in April 2020 under a regional contingent disaster financing \ninstrument and $1.0 million from the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund. \nSources: ADB estimates based on data from Graduate School USA\u2019s technical note on Assessing the Impact of COVID-\n19 on the Marshall Islands Economy, the RMI\u2019s COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan, and FY2021 Budget. \n \n25.  Debt sustainability. The RMI\u2019s public debt stock comprises borrowing from external \ncreditors, including ADB and the US, mostly from the 1990s and early-2000s. Public debt has \ndeclined steadily from the equivalent of 85.2% of GDP in FY2000 to 31.5% in FY2019. An August \n2018 debt sustainability analysis (DSA) by the IMF concluded that the RMI continues to face a \nhigh risk of debt distress. An updated IMF DSA, as noted in the September 2020 IMF Assessment \nLetter, maintains this high risk rating.36 However, the updated assessment reiterates that this risk \ndoes not stem from COVID-19 impacts or unsustainable borrowing practices but instead reflects \npotential fiscal pressures from the impending expiration of the economic provisions of the compact \nin FY2023 and the impacts of disasters over the longer term. As the government has no intention \nto borrow and is instead seeking grant assistance from the country\u2019s development partners to fill \nfinancing needs arising from the COVID-19 crisis, both the IMF and ADB expect the public debt\u2013\nGDP ratio to maintain its steady downward trend over the medium term.37 Grant assistance \nthrough  the  proposed  HEALS  Program  will  also  help  the  RMI  forego  higher-cost  (even  if \nconcessional)  borrowing.  The  ADB  DSA  therefore  concludes  that  public  debt  will  remain \nsustainable over the long term.38  \n \n \n35 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n36 IMF Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n37 Its classification as a grant-assistance only country by ADB and the World Bank also effectively discourages the RMI \nfrom engaging in any nonconcessional borrowing, pursuant to the Sustainable Development Finance Policy adopted \nby multilateral development partners.  \n38 DSA (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", " \n11 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n26.  The MOF will be the executing agency responsible for coordinating and monitoring \nprogram  implementation.  The  National  Disaster  Committee  (NDC),  which  has  primary \nresponsibility for the government\u2019s response plan, will be the implementing agency. The National \nEmergency Operations Center prepares monthly situation reports and provides periodic updates \nto the NDC on expenditures, the number of beneficiaries served, and progress toward targets. \nSex-disaggregated data of beneficiaries will also be regularly collected to report achievement of \ngender monitoring matrix targets.39 Program implementation will utilize the inter-governmental \nclusters system established by the plan to avoid duplication of efforts and maximize available \ncapacities for delivering assistance (para. 13). As part of lessons learned and context-sensitive \ndesign, implementation capacity will be supplemented by ADB\u2019s ongoing PFM project and \nregional TAs supporting the government in targeting and monitoring social protection and gender \naspects of assistance (para. 22). The World Bank is also supporting capacity development in \nhealth through training for back-up health care providers, and broader PFM. The program \nimplementation period is from June 2020 to September 2021. Grant proceeds will be withdrawn \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n27.  Governance. Although the RMI has a strong record of sound fiscal management (para. \n7), critical PFM issues remain to be addressed. A public expenditure and financial accountability \nassessment in 2012 identified structural weaknesses, including: (i) significant variations between \nplanned and actual expenditures, particularly in line ministries; (ii) large segments of public \nspending that are not captured in budget documents; (iii) loose linkages between planning and \nbudgeting; (iv) systems and capacity constraints in tax administration; (v) limited availability of in-\nyear  budget  execution  reports;  and  (vi) limited  follow-up  of  internal  audit  findings  and \nrecommendations.40 The findings informed the government\u2019s RMI PFM Reform Roadmap, 2014\u2013\n2016, which covered 30 broad reform areas.41 However, the sheer volume of public sector \nreforms for implementation stretched MOF capacity. Since 2017, an ADB-financed PFM project \n(footnote 22) has provided long-term capacity supplementation within the MOF to update the \nroadmap and develop a sequenced and prioritized action plan. Improvements have been made \nin the PFM policy and legal framework, national government budgeting and local government \nfinancial management, cash and payroll management, and oversight of state-owned enterprises. \nA fiscal responsibility and debt management bill has been introduced in Parliament. Once enacted \ninto law and implemented effectively, this should help further strengthen PFM and complement \nongoing governance reforms supported by ADB and other partners. Nonetheless, the RMI \nremains a fragile state with structural constraints and thin capacities for effective governance. \nThus, further interventions in the RMI need to be anchored on lessons from ADB\u2019s ongoing \nregional  TA  supporting  effective  and  sustainable  delivery  of  development  results  in  fragile \nsituations in the Pacific.42 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was discussed \nwith the government, including the MOF and NDC. \n \n28.

An  assessment  of  socioeconomic \nvulnerability in the RMI conducted by ADB in 2015 estimated that 38.4% of the population falls \nbelow the basic needs poverty line, down from 51.1% in 2002.43 Although no recent estimate of \nthe Gini coefficient is available, the 2011 census shows that median household incomes in \nKwajalein and Majuro were more than 10 times higher than in Ebon and Lae, the poorest atoll \ncommunities mainly relying on subsistence.44 ADB estimates that a cumulative 11.7% increase \nin real per capita incomes during FY2015\u2013FY2019 reduced the poverty rate further to 29.4%\u2013\n31.6% just before the COVID-19 crisis, but the projected 7.6% contraction in incomes can raise \nthe poverty rate to 33.8%\u201335.2% by the end of FY2021.45 The crisis threatens to wind back the \ngains from recent solid economic performance. Social impacts will be most severe for households \nthat derive income from businesses that are directly affected by prevailing travel restrictions. \n \n29.  Economic relief to businesses will provide the needed cash to maintain operations and \nminimize job displacement. The inclusion of small businesses and informal workers will prevent \nfurther marginalization of these groups who lack alternative sources of income. Populations in the \nneighboring islands have limited access to food supplies, especially during crisis. Ensuring food \nsecurity through food rations and distribution of farming and fishing tools will maintain the quantity \nand quality of food intake. This will protect the welfare of vulnerable groups such as children, the \nelderly, people with disabilities, and those with preexisting health conditions. The continuation of \nthe  government\u2019s  school  lunch  program  will  help  students  avoid  malnutrition.  Training  for \nvulnerable youth will improve their employability once the economy recovers.   \n \n30.  Gender. The program is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. The COVID-19 \ncrisis has the potential to exacerbate existing gender inequalities and risk the progress that has \nbeen made in supporting women\u2019s economic empowerment.46 The program supports women\u2019s \nhealth, safety, and economic empowerment. Health and safety measures include: continuation of \nfree health care, including maternal and reproductive health; priority COVID-19 testing for frontline \nhealth workers; refresher training for frontline health workers on the use of PPE; and staff trainings \non the prevention of sexual harassment in quarantine shelters.47 Economic measures include: \nassistance to women-owned businesses; ensuring all public servants (of which 31% are women) \ncontinue to be employed; and training predominantly women in producing fabric facemasks to \nsupport the health care system. Relief measures will also be open to informal workers who are \nparticularly vulnerable and may not have the savings, networks, or other safety nets to support \nthem during the downturn in business activity. To support vulnerable populations, measures \ninclude: monthly food baskets to women-headed households in neighboring island and atoll \ncommunities;  distribution  of  dignity  kits,  which  include  locally  sewn  and  procured  reusable \n \n43 Government of Marshall Islands, Economic Policy, Planning, and Statistics Office. 2002.

Although the gender \nwage gap in the RMI narrowed to 10.5% in 2017 (from 26.7% in 2011), the economic downturn from the pandemic \nmay reverse this, potentially placing more women at greater risk of poverty and food insecurity. \n47 Noncommunicable diseases remain a leading cause of death in the country.

Adverse impact of exogenous  The Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) economy is \nshock  seen to contract by 5.5% in FY2020 (ends 30 September \n2020)  and  a  further  1.4%  in  FY2021.  Global  travel \nrestrictions and quarantine requirements resulting from the \nCOVID-19 pandemic are adversely affecting the fisheries \n(with a share of about 11% of GDP), hotels and restaurants \n(2%), and transport sectors (7%).  \nOperations  of  a  domestic  fleet  of  purse  seine  fishing \nvessels, as well as a tuna loining plant in Majuro, are \nestimated  to  decline  by  about  30%  in  FY2020  and \nexpected  to  remain  subdued  in  FY2021.  Exports  of \naquarium fish have also declined by half.  \nFurther, a requirement for fishing and carrier vessels to \nspend at least 14 days at sea (including travel) prior to \nentry is limiting transshipment activity in Majuro port\u2014the \nworld\u2019s busiest tuna transshipment hub. Transshipment \nservices associated with the export of sashimi-grade tuna \nare trending lower by 50%.  \nAlso, with no visitor arrivals since March 2020, the two \nmain hotels have been virtually empty around half of the \nfiscal year, while restaurants and retail shops have seen \ncustomers  decline  by  at  least  half.  Government  tax \ncollections are estimated to have declined by 4.1% in \nFY2020.  \nThe decline in economic activity is projected to lead to a \nloss of over 700 jobs through to end-FY2021, with over a \nthird of these losses likely to affect women employees. \nThis will be, by far, the largest reduction in employment in \nthe RMI in more than two decades. As a result, the basic \nneeds  poverty  rate  is  at  risk  of  increasing  from  its \nestimated FY2019 level of between 29.4% and 31.6% of \nhouseholds to a range of 33.8%\u201335.2% by end-FY2021. \n2. Countercyclical development  In June 2020, the government finalized the $45.8 million \nexpenditure  (equivalent  to  21.0%  of  GDP)  RMI  Coronavirus \nPreparedness and Response Plan. It comprises a health \nsector  component,  an  economic  relief  and  recovery \ncomponent, and a food security component:  \n\u2022  The health component ($21.1 million) details and \ncosts  necessary  measures  primarily  to  upgrade \ncapacities  for  screening  and  testing;  strengthen \ninfection  prevention  and  control;  and  establish \ncase management protocols. As of August 2020, \n ", "22  Appendix 4 \nAccess criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \nthe government has spent about $9.5 million for \nmedical  equipment  and  supplies,  as  well  as \npreparation of additional isolation and quarantine \nfacilities. To safeguard the welfare of women and \ngirls in quarantine facilities, provisions are made for \ndistributing  dignity  kits  and  conducting  staff \ntrainings on the prevention of sexual harassment.  \n \n\u2022  For economic relief and recovery ($12.4 million), \nthe  plan  provides  for  financial  assistance  to \nbusinesses in Majuro and Kwajalein affected by the \ntravel  restrictions.  Further  assistance  measures \nunder  consideration  include:  provision  of \nnecessary protective equipment and safe transport \narrangements for workers to ensure continuity of \nbusiness activity in critical sectors including food \nand  emergency  supplies;  financing  low-interest \nbusiness  loans  to  local  employers;  and \nestablishing  a  utilities  discount  program  for \naffected businesses and households.  \n \n\u2022  The  plan  also  safeguards  well-being  of \nvulnerable communities ($8.3 million), including \nthose in the RMI\u2019s neighboring islands and atolls, \nor  more  remote  communities  outside  the  major \npopulation  centers  of  Ebeye  and  Majuro. \nThis includes delivery of monthly food baskets to \neach household as well as provision of farming and \nfishing implements to every community.  \nIn  September  2020,  the  plan  was  updated  to  secure \nsustained funding for the Ministry of Education\u2019s feeding \nprogram that provides school lunch meals to students from \npoor families. The updated plan allocates a further $3.5 \nmillion for providing school lunches five days a week to \nabout 11,300 children nationwide. \n \nThe plan also budgets $4.0 million to continue essential \nservices,  including  utilities,  as  well  as  for  consular \nassistance and possible evacuation of citizens stranded \nabroad.

Pre-shock record of generally  The  government  recorded  annual  fiscal  surpluses \nsound macroeconomic  averaging 3.4% of GDP from FY2014 to FY2018. Recent \nmanagement  sharp  increases  in  fishing  license  revenue  collections \ncontributed  the  most  to  a  substantial  improvement  in \ndomestic resource mobilization. On the expenditure side, \nprogress has been achieved in controlling the public sector \nwage bill, which has declined in proportion to GDP to an \naverage of 21.6% during FY2015\u2013FY2019 from 23.0% \nduring the preceding decade.  \nThe fiscal account swung into a deficit equivalent to about \n2.2% of GDP in FY2019. Contributing to the deficit were \ntransfers to copra producers (i.e., de facto social welfare \nprovided to individual producers through Tobolar, a state-\nowned copra trading company) and the social security fund \n(in support of a broader reform package approved in 2016 \nto move the fund toward a financially sustainable position), \nas well as increased expenditure to contain a dengue \noutbreak.  \nThe pre-COVID-19 budget targeted a more than halving of \nthe deficit in FY2020 to quickly contain fiscal pressures. \nThe original FY2020 budget targeted further growth in \ndomestic revenue while containing recurrent expenditure, \nparticularly transfers to the social security fund.  \nFurther, the RMI has built up its Compact Trust Fund (CTF) \nfrom $240.1 million in FY2014 to $518.6 million by August \n2020. Pre-COVID-19 accumulation trends indicate that the \nCTF  will  likely  reach  a  target  level  that  will  generate \nsufficient annual investment earnings to offset expiring \nCompact grants after FY2023 while preserving the nominal \nvalue of assets. The September 2018 assessment of the \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  however, \nrecommended  further  fiscal  consolidation  to  allow  for \npreservation of the CTF in real terms post-FY2023.   \n4. Structural reforms  The  RMI  has  implemented  pre-emptive  COVID-19 \nresponse measures including:  \n(i)  expanded monitoring by the Health Emergency \nOperations Center\u2014activated since July 2019 due \nto  a  dengue  outbreak  and  later  to  monitor  a \npossible  measles  outbreak\u2014to  also  include \nCOVID-19 surveillance, following the President\u2019s \ndeclaration of a State of Health Emergency in \nearly-February; \n(ii) travel restrictions on travelers from affected areas \nas early as January 2020 followed by full border \nclosure since early-March;  \n(iii) preparation of COVID-19 laboratories in Majuro \nand Ebeye, a special 8-room isolation ward at the \nMajuro hospital, as well as quarantine sites at the \n ", "24  Appendix 4 \nAccess criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \nArrak campus of the College of Marshall Islands in \nMajuro  and  the  Kwajalein  military  base  near \nEbeye; and  \n(iv) COVID-19 awareness activities (e.g., community \nmeetings,  regular  updates  by  the  Minister  of \nHealth broadcast through television and radio, and \nactivation of a COVID-19 hotline for Majuro).  \nHealth systems strengthening is also ongoing through the \ncontinuing procurement of personal protective equipment, \ntest  kits,  as  well  as  ventilators  and  other  medical \nequipment. The Ministry of Health and Human Services is \nconducting targeted on-site COVID-19 testing for those \nexhibiting mild symptoms of respiratory illnesses. \n5. Debt sustainability  Public debt has declined steadily from the equivalent of \n85.2% of GDP in FY2000 to 31.5% by FY2019. Although \nthe IMF rates the RMI as facing a high risk of debt distress, \nthis  stems  primarily  from  fiscal  pressures  from  the \nimpending expiration of the economic provisions of the \nCompact in FY2023 as well as the potential impacts of \ndisasters over the longer-term, not from any unsustainable \nborrowing practices.  \nThe government has no intention to borrow and is instead \nseeking grant assistance from the country\u2019s development \npartners to fill financing needs arising from the COVID-19 \ncrisis, so the public debt-to-GDP ratio is seen to maintain \nits steady downward trend over the medium-term.  \nGrant assistance through the proposed CPRO will help the \nRMI forego higher-cost (even if concessional) borrowing \nand the ADB DSA therefore concludes that public debt will \nremain sustainable over the long-term.  \n6. IMF coordination  ADB is closely coordinating with the IMF on the macro-\nfiscal framework for the RMI. The IMF\u2019s Assessment Letter \nwill confirm ADB\u2019s views on: (i) the RMI\u2019s pre-shock record \nof generally sound macroeconomic management; and (ii)  \na medium-term downward path for public debt\u2013GDP with \neconomic recovery and given the availability of sufficient \ngrant resources from development partners supporting the \nRMI Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Plan. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, CPRO = COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option, \nCTF = Compact Trust Fund, DSA = debt sustainability analysis, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product,  \nIMF = International Monetary Fund, RMI = Republic of the Marshall Islands. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "ADB", "CreationDate": "D:20201119194621+08'00'", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 20 for Word", "Keywords": "54358-001, health, public sector, governance, rmi, marshall islands, adb projects, adb projects, terms and conditions, board approval, rrp, approved projects, recommendations of the president", "ModDate": "D:20201202201909+08'00'", "Producer": "Adobe PDF Library 20.13.96", "Subject": "The Health Expenditure and Livelihoods Support (HEALS) Program will support the government\u2019s response to the potentially catastrophic health and economic impacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), anchored by its $45.8 million COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan.2 The government is implementing a comprehensive response package that covers (i) strengthening the health system\u2019s capacity for enhanced surveillance, infection control, and potential case management; (ii) providing economic relief and recovery assistance to businesses adversely affected by the prevailing travel restrictions; and (iii) mitigating impacts on the Republic of Marshall Island\u2019s most vulnerable communities, all within the context of a sound and sustainable fiscal framework.", "Title": "Health Expenditure and Livelihoods Support Progam: Report and Recommendation of the President"}}
