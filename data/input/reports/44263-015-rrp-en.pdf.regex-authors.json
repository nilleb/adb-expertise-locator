THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased loan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for subprogram 2 of the Inclusive Financial Sector \nDevelopment Program. \n \n2.  The program represents a long-term partnership between the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and the Government of Cambodia to develop an efficient and stable financial sector and \nincrease financial inclusion. ADB approved the programmatic approach and subprogram 1 of the \npolicy-based  loan  in  October  2016.1 The  program  will  build  on  reforms  achieved  under \nsubprogram 1 by (i) increasing access to finance for the poor, rural households, agriculture sector, \nand small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); (ii) enhancing financial sector stability; and \n(iii) upgrading financial infrastructure to support the introduction of new financial services and \nproducts. The program directly supports reforms outlined in the government\u2019s National Strategic \nDevelopment  Plan,  2014\u201320182 and  the  Financial  Sector  Development  Strategy  (FSDS), \n2016\u20132025.3 The program is classified some gender elements. It targets increased inclusion of \n \nwomen for access to financial services and sets gender equality targets for utilizing modern \nfinancial products. The program also contributes to ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (Table 1) as it addresses \nremaining poverty and reduces inequalities, promotes rural development and food security, and \nstrengthens governance and institutional capacity.4 The program is aligned with ADB\u2019s draft \ncountry  partnership  strategy,  2019\u20132023  for  Cambodia,  which  recognizes  financial  sector \n \ndevelopment as a driver of competitiveness and economic diversification (Pillar 1), and is included \nin ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2019\u20132021 for Cambodia.5 By focusing on financial \nsector development and inclusive finance, the program aligns with the recommendations of the \n2017 review of the 2011 Financial Sector Operational Plan.6 \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  The programmatic approach. The program uses a programmatic approach to provide a \nlong-term engagement, which is well-aligned with the sequenced and long-term outlook required \nfor financial sector development. The program consists of three subprograms. Subprogram 1 \nprovided the foundation for the government\u2019s financial inclusion and financial stability initiatives: \nNational  Bank  of  Cambodia  (NBC)  created  a  formal  working  group  to  develop  a  gender-\nresponsive  national  financial  inclusion  strategy,  launched  financial  literacy  campaigns,  and \ndeveloped a basic framework for cross-sector supervision. Subprogram 2 focuses on deepening \nthese reforms through the adoption of a national financial inclusion strategy; key legislation \nincluding Trust Law, e-Commerce Law, and Consumer Protection Law; and incorporation of \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016.

In  addition,  the  government  will  establish  modern \ne-commerce  infrastructure  such  as  application  servers,  payment  gateways,  and  security \n \narchitecture; and develop new trust financial products. \n \n4.  Development problem. Cambodia has achieved remarkable economic development \nsince the late 1990s, with an average annual growth rate of 7.7% between 2011 and 2017. This \nsustained economic progress helped the country attain lower middle-income status in July 2016. \nIn 2018, the Cambodian economy grew by 7.3% with moderate private investment offset by higher \npublic spending, robust construction and tourism, and strong exports. 7 Despite positive economic \nperformance, challenges remain. Although Cambodia\u2019s poverty rate declined to 13.5% in 2014 \nfrom 47.8% in 2007, more than 70% of Cambodians still live on less than $3 a day. 8 A significant \nproportion of the population remain near-poor and are vulnerable to falling back into poverty when \nexposed to economic shocks. The government has recognized that achieving sustained and \nequitable growth is key to achieving middle-income status. The Rectangular Strategy (Phase IV), \nadopted in September 2018, acknowledges that maintaining a 7% broad-based economic growth \nrate will require structural reforms. These include further diversification of the narrow economic \nbase  comprising  agriculture,  tourism,  garment,  and  construction,  which  are  at  risk  from \nautomation of their labor-intensive processes; and promotion of private sector development and \nemployment.9 Achieving these will require a broad-based, inclusive, and sustainable financial \nsector. \n \n5.  Cambodia\u2019s  financial  sector  is  currently  narrow-based  with  the  banking  subsector \nrepresenting about 84% ($28.60 billion) and microfinance about 15% ($5.03 billion) of the total \nsector assets.10 The banking subsector is currently sound with adequate capital buffers. However, \nrapid credit growth in the microfinance institution (MFI) and real estate sectors,11 inadequate \ninstitutional coordination, and low depositor confidence, due in part to the absence of a consumer \nprotection framework, represent increasing risks. Subsectors such as leasing, capital markets, \ninsurance, and pension funds are underdeveloped in Cambodia compared with its Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) comparators. \n \n6.  Moreover, Cambodia has a low level of financial inclusion because lending is fragmented \nwith credit readily available in urban areas, while the rural areas remain underserved.12 In 2015, \na comprehensive financial inclusion study highlighted a major problem of financial exclusion in \nthe country.13 The study estimated that only 59% of the adult population have access to formal \nfinancial services (68% in urban areas and 55% in rural areas) and 12% use informal services;14 \nwhile 29% are completely excluded, having no access to formal or informal financial services (in \nfigure on page 3). In remote rural areas, customer information is limited, and contract enforcement \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2019.

Informal financial services are provided by institutions that operate outside of legal \nframeworks and are dominated by social control mechanisms and norms (e.g., moneylenders, relatives and friends). \n \n ", "3 \nis weak, which result in high intermediation costs especially for small transactions, and in turn \nover-indebtedness of poor households.15 \n \n \n7.  Binding constraints. The government recognizes that generating more jobs to sustain \ngrowth and raise income levels depends on broadening financial intermediation to support efforts \nto diversify the economy. To meet this objective, a number of development constraints must be \naddressed. These include (i) limited financial inclusion due to a lack of reasonably priced credit in \nlocal currency and an absence of consumer protection mechanisms, (ii) lack of a functional \nfinancial stability framework, and (iii) weaknesses in key financial sector infrastructure relative to \ninternational standards. \n \n8.  Access to financial products and services for the poor is limited. The financial sector \nis  not  guided  by  a  comprehensive  strategy  that  identifies  short-,  medium-,  and  long-term \ninterventions in inclusive finance and financial literacy. As a result, financial inclusion (reflected in \nthe share of the population with accounts and SME access to financing) remains low, despite high \nprivate credit to gross domestic product (GDP) ratios. In addition, financial literacy among the \npopulation is low at 18%: Cambodia ranks 135 out of 144 countries16 and achieved a low score \nof  11.5  in  an  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  and  International \nNetwork on Financial Education survey.17 Consumer protection from unfair business practices is \nlacking. There is no consumer protection law, which is critical to establishing confidence in the \nfinancial sector. The regulatory regime does not promote new financial products and services; \nand  financing  to  SMEs,  small  farmers,  and  agriculture  is  limited.  Women  run  65%  of  all \nbusinesses; however, most of these are microenterprises and, on average, smaller and less \nprofitable than businesses run by men.18 Inability to access (long-term) finance due to limited \ncollateral and financial literacy is a key obstacle for businesses owned by women (footnote 8). \nFinancing for farmers and rural households is limited. Finally, the government-owned Rural \nDevelopment Bank (RDB) promotes credit to the agriculture sector, but its financial performance \n                                                \n15 World Bank. 2006.

The financial stability framework is weak. Risks to financial stability have increased \ndue to the acceleration of credit growth in the microfinance and real estate sectors. In addition, \nmany local financial institutions rely on external funding and, therefore, are exposed to foreign \nexchange  risk.  Further,  the  increasing  use  of  financial  technology  requires  strengthened \nregulation and supervision. The government must address three constraints: (i) weak coordination \nof financial sector oversight among key government agencies; (ii) lack of protection for the \ngrowing depositor base; and (iii) lack of a foundation to introduce local currency nonbank financial \nproducts. Improved institutional arrangements across key government agencies are required for \neffective crisis management; in particular, a coordination mechanism that includes NBC for bank \nsupervision, the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) for fiscal policy, and the Securities and \nExchange Commission of Cambodia (SECC) for capital markets. With the rapidly expanding bank \ndeposit base, there is a need for a deposit protection scheme (DPS) to promote depositor \nconfidence. Finally, the development of a local currency government bond market and an \ninstitutional investor base is necessary to lower the economy\u2019s reliance on the banking subsector \nfor credit, while increasing sources of long-term financial intermediation. \n \n10.  Financial infrastructure is underdeveloped. The infrastructure supporting the financial \nsector has critical gaps that inhibit wider stakeholder participation and constrain development. \nThese gaps have slowed the development of access channels to initiate and deliver cashless \npayments, which will reduce the widespread use of cash. Three limitations need to be addressed: \n(i) the payment systems are outdated; (ii) enabling laws for e-commerce financial services, digital \nfinance, and trust products do not exist; and (iii) compliance with global standards for anti-money \nlaundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) is weak. The government established \nan action plan to address the findings of the 2016 Asia Pacific Group evaluation. Nevertheless, \nmore needs to be done to achieve compliance with global standards, such as the Financial Action \nTask Force (FATF)19 40 Recommendations (para. 18).20 \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n11.  The government\u2019s reform agenda. The government\u2019s reform agenda is anchored in the \nFSDS, 2016\u20132025 (footnote 3). The FSDS prioritizes the development of a sound financial sector \nthat contributes to poverty reduction by supporting economic growth and increasing the poor\u2019s \naccess to finance. Specific goals include the (i) development of the nonbank subsector and capital \nmarkets, (ii) alignment of regulations and supervision practices towards international standards, \nand (iii) establishment of a formal crisis management mechanism. A specific emphasis is placed \non financial inclusion by providing financial products and services to the low-income segment of \nthe  population.  The  government  considers  its  commitments  under  the  ASEAN  Economic \nCommunity Blueprint 2025 as a catalyst for continued reforms of the domestic financial market \nand capital market integration.21 \n \n12.  Programmatic approach. The program supports three reform areas: (i) access to formal \nfinancial services for the poor; (ii) financial sector stability; and (iii) financial sector infrastructure. \n                                                \n19 FATF is a 38-member intergovernmental body established in 1989. Its objectives are to set standards and promote \neffective implementation of legal, regulatory, and operational measures for AML/CFT and other related threats to the \nintegrity of the international financial system. \n20 The FATF 40 Recommendations set out a comprehensive framework of AML/CFT measures. \n21 ASEAN. 2015.

During subprogram 2, ADB deferred one prior action to establish the SME credit guarantee \nscheme and replaced it with a prerequisite prior action which reflects increased financing to RDB \nin the budget law to build rice-drying and storage facilities. This reform fills an infrastructure gap \nand lays the ground for warehouse receipts, which will enable rural farmers to use paddy stored \nin government-owned facilities as loan collateral. Without collateral, they are seen as high-risk \nborrowers. This creates an enabling environment to improve the creditworthiness of rice farmers \nand provides a basis to establish an SME credit guarantee scheme under subprogram 3. Three \nof  the  indicative  policy  milestones  exceeded  expectations  and  were  strengthened.23The \nsubmission  of  the  e-commerce  and  consumer  protection  laws  to  the  National  Assembly \nrepresents a significant accomplishment in the government\u2019s reform agenda. Previous attempts \nat submission were delayed and the draft laws were returned to the Ministry of Commerce (MOC), \ndue to their complexity and nascency. ADB provided staff resources and technical assistance to \naddress the outstanding issues in the draft laws and to obtain the required government approvals.  \n \n14.  Reform area 1: Access to formal financial services for the poor. This reform area built \non accomplishments under subprogram 1 by promoting a more inclusive financial sector and \nestablishing  a  framework  for  adequate  consumer  protection.  Under  subprogram  2,  the \ngovernment finalized the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion (NSFI) to provide a framework \nto broaden access to financial services for individuals (including specific targets for the female \npopulation) and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. To complement this initiative, NBC \nlaunched  a  program  in  conjunction  with  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Youth  and  Sports  and \nnongovernment organizations to incorporate financial literacy in the national curriculum in key \nsubjects in grades 1\u201312. Financial literacy will equip boys and girls to better manage financial \nresources in the future. The government restructured RDB with a new mandate to provide local \ncurrency loans to micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises in the agriculture sector. RDB also \nrevised its internal credit risk and AML/CFT policies and introduced key financial performance \nindicators.  The  government  strengthened  consumer  protection  by  establishing  consumer \ncomplaint functions in banks, insurance companies, and securities firms; and by conducting \noutreach programs to raise awareness in urban and rural areas. The government then submitted \nthe Consumer Protection Law to the National Assembly for approval. This law establishes a \ngeneral prohibition against unfair conduct and explicitly prohibits false advertising and pyramid \nschemes,  among  others.  Finally,  the  government  allocated  financing  to  build  essential \n                                                \n22 ADB. 2018.

Under  subprogram  3, the government  will further  strengthen financial  inclusion  and \nconsumer protection, integrate financial literacy into the school curriculum, and develop affordable \nand relevant microinsurance products. Microinsurance will specifically benefit women as they \nmake up the majority of MFI borrowers. \n \n16.  Reform area 2: Financial sector stability. This reform area built on accomplishments \nunder subprogram 1 by establishing measures to increase financial sector stability and confidence, \nand enlarge and deepen the bank and nonbank financial subsectors. Under subprogram 2, the \ngovernment established a joint financial stability technical group comprising NBC, MEF, and \nSECC  to  facilitate  coordinated  financial  sector  supervision  and  crisis  management.  ADB \ncoordinated with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to support financial stability reforms. After \nextensive consultation and research, the government authorized the Paybox Plus DPS model for \nimplementation.24  In the event of bank failure, the deposit insurer reimburses the covered deposit \namount to a depositor and provides additional resolution functions such as financial support to \nthe failed bank. The government revised its debt strategy to incorporate provisions for the \nissuance of government debt. Local currency government debt securities will establish a yield \ncurve, which provides a meaningful benchmark for pricing financial products. \n \n17.  Under subprogram 3, the government will further address its macro-financial risks by \nestablishing a formal national financial stability committee for crisis management, implement the \nPaybox Plus DPS, and formalize a road map for issuing government debt securities. \n \n18.  Reform  area  3:  Financial  sector  infrastructure.  This  reform  area  built  on \naccomplishments  under  subprogram  1  by  supporting  financial  infrastructure  upgrades  and \nenabling a wider array of financial products and services. Under subprogram 2, NBC launched a \ncentral shared switch system for ATMs and point-of-sale terminals, allowing consumers to use \ntheir bank cards at all participating financial institutions. The national credit bureau increased the \ncoverage  of  its  database  from  individual  borrowers  to  include  corporate  borrowers.  The \ngovernment adopted the 2019\u20132023 national action plan to address the AML/CFT findings in the \n2016 mutual evaluation report of the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering. The Cambodia \nFinancial Intelligence Unit, MEF, SECC, Anti-Corruption Unit, and other key stakeholders will \nimplement the action plan. Effective implementation of its domestic AML/CFT through the action \nplan  will  satisfy  Cambodia\u2019s  international  obligations  and  its  commitment  to  the  FATF  40 \nRecommendations. Finally, the government made significant progress in addressing the lack of \nan enabling legal framework for modern financial products and services. MEF submitted the Trust \nLaw to the National Assembly for approval. The law governs the establishment, registration, \nsupervision, and termination of trusts and will pave the way for the development of investment \nvehicles. MOC also submitted the e-Commerce Law to the National Assembly for approval.  \n \n19.  Under subprogram 3, the government will establish a real-time gross settlements system, \ntarget the achievement of a pre-agreed number of compliant or largely compliant ratings on FATF \n40 Recommendations, introduce new financial products under the trust scheme, and establish an \ne-commerce payment system infrastructure.P \n                                                \n24 Other DPS models include Paybox, Loss Minimizer, and Risk Minimizer, in each of which the deposit insurer has \nvarying responsibilities. NBC and MEF jointly decided on Paybox Plus as the preferred model in the context of \nCambodia\u2019s financial system, function of supervisors, and number of financial institutions. \n \n ", "7 \n20.  ADB\u2019s experience. ADB has had a long productive engagement with Cambodia in \nsupport of financial sector development through a series of well-sequenced programmatic policy-\nbased  loans,  technical assistance,  and grant  projects,  all  aligned  with  the  FSDS  series.25 \nBeginning in 2001, the first Financial Sector Program, 2001\u2013200526 established a legal and \nregulatory regime for banking and insurance, encouraged consolidation of the banking subsector, \nstrengthened supervision and surveillance of financial institutions, and developed key financial \ninfrastructure. Under the Second Financial Sector Program, 2006\u20132010,27 ADB supported the \nmodernization of the payment clearing and settlements system, taking the banking subsector from \na mainly cash-based and manual check-clearing system to an interbank shared Visa switch \nsystem; and the NBC fully computerized its core banking system. The program introduced uniform \naccounting standards for the banking subsector, compatible with International Financial Reporting \nStandards, and established a public registry for secured transactions in MOC. ADB supported the \nestablishment of the Cambodia Financial Intelligence Unit to counter money laundering and \nprevent the financing of terrorism. The Third Financial Sector Program, 2011\u2013201528 initiated \n  s\nADB\u2019s support to capital markets and incorporated the recommendations of Cambodia\u2019s first \nFinancial Sector Assessment Program. \n \n21.  Lessons learned. ADB\u2019s engagement in Cambodia\u2019s financial sector yielded three key \nlessons that have helped inform subprogram 2.29 First, financial sector development is a gradual \nprocess that requires proper sequencing. Key foundation reforms to the banking subsector must \nbe successfully implemented before progressing to more complex reforms to the nonbank \nsubsector, including government and corporate bonds and capital market development. Second, \ngovernment coordination and ownership of reforms articulated through a series of FSDSs are \nnecessary to ensure that financial sector development is based on predetermined steps, where \neach step is supported by good technical input and government consultations with stakeholders \nto achieve broad support for reforms. Third, a comprehensive approach is required to make the \nfinancial sector more inclusive, starting with policy reforms to expand the coverage of financial \nproducts and services, consumer protection, promotion of e-commerce, and financial literacy. \n \n22.  ADB\u2019s value addition to the program design and implementation. ADB\u2019s long-term \nengagement and structured policy dialogue with the government, the executing agency, and \nimplementing agencies (para. 26) have helped prioritize and sequence legal, policy and regulatory \nreforms in support of a stable and inclusive financial sector. The adoption of the NSFI formalizes \nthe process of developing the country\u2019s first dedicated and comprehensive financial inclusion \nstrategy.  Further,  ADB  supported  the  submission  of  the  trust,  consumer  protection,  and \ne-commerce laws to the National Assembly. The submission of these laws to the National \n \n                                                \n25 ADB. 2001.

ADB consulted with \nand supported working groups represented by key government agencies, organized public \nconsultation workshops attended by the public and private sectors, and members of the European \nChamber of Commerce in Cambodia. ADB also supported the preparation of the drafts and \nfacilitated government approval processes.  \n \n23.  Development partner coordination. ADB is the lead development partner in Cambodia \nand provides comprehensive support in coordination with bilateral and multilateral development \nagencies. The IMF supports the government\u2019s efforts to address elevated macro-financial risks \nby supporting NBC on banking supervision and financial stability, monetary policy and foreign \nexchange operations, de-dollarization, and strengthening AML/CFT. ADB collaborated with the \nIMF on policy reforms pertaining to the establishment of the national Financial Stability Technical \nGroup, domestic government debt market development, and the IMF\u2019s Financial Sector Stability \nReview. The Korea International Cooperation Agency provided assistance to develop the equity \ncapital market, while the International Finance Corporation supports access to finance. The \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement promotes agriculture finance, and the Japan International \nCooperation Agency supports SME development. Finally, the government prepared the Make \nAccess Possible Cambodia document with the help of the United Nations Capital Development \nFund, FinMark Trust, and Cenfri. \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n24.  The impact of the reforms is demonstrated through three primary channels, as reflected \nin the design and monitoring framework (DMF): (i) increased size of the financial sector leading \nto  increased  intermediation  and  private  sector  growth;  (ii)  strengthened  consumer  deposit \nprotection , which results in greater depositor confidence as evidenced by increased bank deposit \nshare to GDP; and (iii) increased financial inclusion, which provides a greater proportion of the \npopulation access to a growing financial sector. Between 2015 and 2017, the ratio of M2 (broad \nmoney) to GDP grew from 67.0% to 87.8% and total private sector credit of banks to GDP grew \nfrom 63% to 81.6%. Total bank deposits to GDP increased from 55.0% to 85.6%, and the number \nof women with an account at a formal financial institution increased from 1.08 million to 1.45 \nmillion during the same period. ADB added new indicators\u2014number of women with an account \nat a formal financial institution, percentage of female commercial institution borrowers, and \naverage loan amount to female MFI borrowers\u2014to the DMF. The program impact assessment \nestimates that the 3-year GDP growth arising from financial inclusion reforms for the period 2019 \nto 2022 ranges from $183 million to $304 million.30 \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n25.  The government has requested a concessional loan of $40 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance subprogram 2. The loan will have a 24-year term, including a \ngrace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement. \nThe size of the loan is based on Cambodia\u2019s development financing needs as identified during \ncountry programming and strategy formulation, the development impact of the policy reform \npackage, and the development spending arising from the reforms. In 2019, the fiscal deficit is \nexpected to be $1.13 billion, or 5.1% of GDP, and will be financed primarily by official development \nassistance. \n                                                \n30 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n26.  The implementation period of subprogram 2 is from 30 June 2016 to 31 July 2019. This \nrepresents a one-year extension of the original implementation period of 30 June 2016 to \n30 June 2018. The government and ADB agreed to this extension due to the complexity of the \npolicy actions, protracted consultations on the e-commerce and consumer protection laws, and \nthe 2018 general elections which occurred during the implementation period. The delay will have \nno impact on intended program outcomes. NBC is the executing agency. MEF, MOC, RDB, and \nSECC are the implementing agencies. A financial sector steering committee, chaired by the \ngovernor of NBC with implementing agencies as members, oversees the implementation of the \nprogram. A technical working group, also chaired by NBC, supports the steering committee. The \nproceeds of the policy-based loan will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n27.  Governance.  The government is committed to enhancing good governance in its public \nfinancial management (PFM) by introducing international best practices and standards and \ntransforming  its  PFM  systems  toward  result-based  fiscal  planning  and  decentralization. \nGovernance has been at the core of Cambodia\u2019s PFM reform strategy as reflected in the \nRectangular  Strategy  (Phase  IV)  (footnote  9).  Since  the  inception  of  the  Public  Financial \nManagement  Reform  Program  in  2004,  considerable  progress  has  been  made  to  foster \ngovernance and improve the efficiency of public sector management and public service delivery. \nNevertheless, there is still room to further strengthen PFM in public spending efficiency, and \ngovernance  and  transparency  of  fiscal  planning  and  budgeting.31 ADB  has  reinforced  this \nmomentum with continued support to improve governance, financial reporting, accountability, \ndecentralization, and deconcentration of fiscal and budget planning. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \n28.  Poverty  and  social.  The  program  is  categorized  general  intervention  to  support \nsustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. The promotion of inclusive finance extends \naffordable formal financial services to poor and rural microenterprises. One of the key reforms is \nthe incorporation of financial literacy in the national school curriculum. This will provide knowledge \nof affordable financial services to poor and rural households, thereby having a direct impact on \npoverty reduction. Consumer protection outreach programs targeting the poor instills consumer \nconfidence and ensures that the underserved benefit from financial services and products. \n \n29.  Gender.  Subprogram  2  is  categorized  some  gender  elements.  It  targets  increased \nfinancial inclusion of women through the NSFI, 2019\u20132025. The government will adopt reforms \ndesigned to address the barriers faced by women in accessing financial services. The NSFI \ntargets halving the percentage of financially excluded women from 27% in 2018 to 13.5% by 2020, \nand includes gender equality targets for MFI and commercial bank account holders and borrowers. \nThe  government\u2019s  consumer  protection  outreach  programs  recorded  at  least  30%  female \nparticipation. The collaboration between NBC and the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports \non financial literacy will especially benefit girls\u2019 school-to-work transition by providing skills \nrequired for future employment and business opportunities. As the insurance regulator, MEF \nadvised insurance companies to offer insurance products targeted at women, such as breast \ncancer insurance and discounted life insurance. \n \n                                                \n31 Public Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n30.
