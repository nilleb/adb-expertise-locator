THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of Uzbekistan for the Sustainable Hydropower Project. The report also describes \nproposed technical assistance (TA) for Enhancing Climate Resilience of Hydropower Plants,1 and \nif the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The proposed project will support Uzbekistan\u2019s national goals to increase renewable \nenergy generation and diversify its energy mix. The project has multifaceted interventions to help \nUzbekistan (i) deploy small and mini hydropower plants (HPPs) to add 25 megawatts (MW) of \nrenewable energy capacity; (ii) develop a hydropower master plan to optimize a future investment \nprogram, which will help develop planning capacity for climate resilience and environmental \nsustainability; and (iii) complement sector reforms by strengthening the institutional capacity of \nJoint-Stock Company Uzbekhydroenergo. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Benefiting from high commodity prices, Uzbekistan enjoyed high economic growth that \naveraged at a rate of 8.4% over the past 10 years. However, the weakening external environment, \nextensive state control, weak governance, and low foreign investments have increasingly slowed \neconomic growth, necessitating far-reaching reforms, including continuing the institutional and \nstructural reforms of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The energy sector, which has underpinned \nUzbekistan\u2019s sustained growth and contributes about 20% to gross domestic product, faces \nchallenges in introducing market-oriented principles to catalyze private sector investment and in \ndiversifying energy resources while scaling up urgent investments in critical infrastructure to \nsupport fast-growing power demand and ensure long-term sustainability. \n \n4.  Uzbekistan has served as an electricity trade hub in Central Asia, where an interconnected \nand coordinated power system established during the Soviet era provided countries with high \nenergy security and an optimal energy mix by unifying the region\u2019s unevenly distributed energy \nresources.  Under  this  system,  hydropower-rich  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  exchanged \nelectricity with fossil fuel-generating Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. However, a \nbreakdown in this regionally coordinated energy system pushed Uzbekistan to rely heavily on \nfossil fuels in its generation mix. \n \n5.  Natural gas is the dominant fossil energy source in the country\u2019s power generation mix, \ncontributing 80% of the 63 terawatt-hours of total electricity produced in 2018. Of the 11 gigawatts \n(GW) of thermal power plant capacity in Uzbekistan, more than 40% are 30\u201340-year-old plants \nwith  low  thermal  efficiency.  Most  thermal  power  plants  were  also  designed  for  baseload \ngeneration with no flexible load management measures, further reducing thermal efficiency and \npower supply reliability. Moreover, continued reliance on meeting power demand growth by \nburning fossil fuels, the country\u2019s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will rise, as 85% of emissions \ncome from the energy sector. \n \n                                                \n1  Of which (i) $1,000,000 will be provided by the Climate Change Fund and (ii) $500,000 will be provided by the Clean \nEnergy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility and administered by the Asian Development \nBank (ADB). \n ", "2 \n6.  As part of the complex reform measures undertaken by the government, focus has shifted \ntoward the use of renewable energy to diversify energy sources. Uzbekistan has abundant \nrenewable energy resources, and the most harnessed is hydropower, with installed capacity of \n1.9 GW or about 13% of total installed generating capacity. However, this is only about 20% of \nthe country\u2019s hydropower potential of 7.5 GW.2 The exploitation of water resources prioritized \nagriculture (i.e., for irrigation purposes) as there were no strategies for integrated water\u2013energy \nresources management through hydropower development. Issues such as low electricity tariff, \ngeological and hydrological risks, and socio-environmental footprints were additional constraints \nto the effective development of hydropower in Uzbekistan. \n \n7.  In this light, the government adopted a $2.6 billion investment program to increase \nhydropower capacity by 1.6 GW by 2030.3 Uzbekhydroenergo was established in May 2017 to \nadminister  the  ambitious  program,  backed  by  preferential  tariff  for  hydropower  projects. \nUzbekhydroenergo  was  created  by  unbundling  the  HPPs  from  Uzbekenergo,  the  vertically \nintegrated state utility, and integrating them with HPPs under the Ministry of Agriculture and Water \nResources.  Hydropower  planning  and  water  resources  management  were  streamlined  into \nUzbekhydroenergo. \n \n8.  The  government  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  support  to  align \nhydropower development with the overarching goals of the country\u2019s energy sector development \nand support SOE reform. As a newly established company and a new executing agency for ADB \nprojects, Uzbekhydroenergo needs to build management, planning, and technical capacity. ADB \nwill help improve Uzbekhydroenergo\u2019s technical capability and financial management skills. \nInitially,  Uzbekhydroenergo  will  focus  on  less  risky  small  hydropower  projects  and  HPP \nrehabilitation. Gradually, it will shift to the development of more complex large HPPs and cross-\nborder hydropower projects. \n \n9.  Under the project, Uzbekhydroenergo will install three small HPPs with 24 megawatts \n(MW) total capacity on the Aksu River in Kashkadarya Province; and at least three mini HPPs \nwith 1 MW total capacity in rural areas. The government originally proposed 30 MW total capacity \nwith dams of 40 to 70 meters in height and storage reservoirs, but Uzbekhydroenergo agreed to \nmodify the project design to maintain water flow for the river eco-system and people\u2019s daily use \nin consideration of ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements, international standards and practices, and, \nmore importantly, long-term socio-environmental sustainability. Such joint efforts have helped the \ngovernment  and  Uzbekhydroenergo  infuse  environmental  sustainability  in  the  country\u2019s \nhydropower planning landscape. \n \n10.  Lessons. ADB has applied lessons from its long-term sector operations in designing the \nproject.4 First, development partner coordination meetings and interagency coordination meetings \nhelp streamline government regulatory procedures and tackle bureaucratic hurdles that delay \nimplementation. Second, TA is needed to strengthen the executing agency\u2019s planning and \nimplementation capacity and address operational bottlenecks. Third, ADB\u2019s continued support for \nsector and SOE reforms improves project efficiency and overall sector sustainability. In particular, \nADB support for cost recovery tariff reforms will help improve the sector\u2019s financial health and \n                                                \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2012.

ADB, as the largest development partner in Uzbekistan \nenergy sector, has provided direct support in the design and implementation of energy sector \nreforms, including unbundling of Uzbekenergo and tariff reforms, and will continue to mobilize \nsupport to improve the sector\u2019s sustainability and effectiveness. 6 In line with ongoing efforts, the \nproject will leverage SOE reform by strengthening the institutional financial management capacity \nof Uzbekhydroenergo and optimizing future investment programs through a master plan study. \nInstitutional and capacity development for hydropower planning with increased awareness on \nclimate change and environmental sustainability will be provided through the attached TA.7 \nImproved gender equality will be critical in realizing socioeconomic development. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The project is aligned with the following impact: inclusive economic growth achieved \nthrough increased clean and sustainable energy supply (footnote 3). The project will have the \nfollowing outcome: clean and renewable energy generation increased.8 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n14.  Output 1: Generation capacity of small hydropower plants increased.

The benefits of hydropower are especially salient for mini HPPs, \ngiven their smaller environmental and social footprint. The mini HPPs will ensure the efficient use \nof water resources, such as spillover water from dams or irrigation channels, and will provide \nreliable electricity in the country\u2019s remote villages. \n \n15.  Output 2: Climate resilience promoted in hydropower planning. The project will \nprepare a hydropower development master plan focused on climate resilience and environmental \nsustainability. Large deployment of hydropower is seen as an effective GHG mitigation strategy, \nbut given the water-stressed situation of Uzbekistan, larger attention needs to be paid to the water \nresource assessment with due consideration to the climate change impacts and environmental \nsustainability assessments. The attached TA (para. 22) will directly contribute to output 2 by \nundertaking  critical  analytical  work  to  reassess  and  optimize  Uzbekistan\u2019s  hydropower \ndevelopment plan from climate resilience and environmental sustainability perspectives. The \nmasterplan will also provide potential private sector investment opportunities by conducting early-\nstage project studies and exploring public\u2013private partnerships for hydropower projects. \n \n16.  Output  3:  Uzbekhydroenergo\u2019s  institutional  capacity  enhanced.  Output  3  will \nstrengthen Uzbekhydroenergo\u2019s institutional capacity in financial management and improve its \ncorporate  governance  to  leverage  reforms.  It  will  ensure  the  long-term  sustainability  of \nUzbekhydroenergo, a newly formed entity, and the transparency of financial information.  \n \nD.

The government has requested a regular loan of $60 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period \nof 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other \nterms and conditions in the draft loan and project agreements. Based on the straight-line method, \nthe average maturity is 15.25 years, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per year. \nThe government will relend the loan proceeds to Uzbekhydroenergo under a subsidiary loan \nagreement. Except as ADB may otherwise agree, relending terms will include (i) commitment \ncharges and interest rates identical to those applied to the loan; (ii) a repayment period, including \na grace period, identical to that applied to the loan, and (iii) Uzbekhydroenergo bearing the foreign \nexchange and interest rate variation risks of the loan proceeds. The government has provided \nADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility \nbased on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \ndecision and not made based on communication from ADB. \n \n19.  The summary financing plan is in Table 3. ADB will finance the expenditures for the \nconstruction of small HPPs, the design and supply of goods for the mini HPPs, and related project \nsupervision services. The government will provide counterpart support, totaling $5.8 million, in the \nform of financing for taxes and duties. Uzbekhydroenergo\u2019s internal resources, totaling $9.7 \nmillion, will cover the costs associated with land acquisition and resettlement, the installation of \nthe mini HPPs, financial charges during construction, and related contingencies (Table 3). \n \nTable 3: Summary Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nADB     \n  Ordinary capital resources (regular loan)  60.0  79.7 \nUzbekhydroenergo  9.5  12.6 \nGovernment  5.8  7.7 \n        Total  75.3  100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, Uzbekhydroenergo = Joint-Stock Company Uzbekhydroenergo. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n20.

ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n22.  The attached transaction TA will enhance the climate resilience of hydropower projects in \nUzbekistan through a hydropower master plan that will optimize long-term investment considering \nclimate change and environmental sustainability, and build capacity for hydropower development \nplanning (footnote 6). The TA is estimated to cost $1.7 million, of which $1.0 million will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Climate Change Fund10 and $0.5 million will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Clean Energy Fund11 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility \nand administered by ADB. Uzbekhydroenergo will provide counterpart support in the form of office \naccommodation, counterpart staff, and other in-kind contributions. ADB will oversee TA activities. \nThe TA will be implemented over 15 months, with an estimated start date of September 2019. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n23.  The project is in the Shakhrisabaz District of Kashkadarya Province in the middle course \nof the Aksu River, which is 12 km upstream of the Gissarak dam. The project site is a narrow \nvalley suitable for hydropower development, and all subprojects are run-of-the-river type with no \nwater storage capacity. A 22 km, 35\u2013110-kilovolt transmission line will be built to export the \ngenerated electricity to the nearby substation at the Gissarak HPP. Seismic risk is sufficiently \nmitigated by the application of adequate seismic codes in the project design. Site accessibility is \nfair as is, but the access road will be partially expanded and rehabilitated for the community\u2019s \nimproved access. \n \n24.  The HPP outputs have been optimized to minimize environmental and social impacts. An \nenvironmental flow assessment helped establish technical design to deliver maximum generation \ncapacity and minimum impact on sediment, optimal water flows, and the measures to integrate \nenvironmental sustainability and established good practices for Uzbekhydroenergo\u2019s hydropower \nplanning. The climate change assessment suggests moderate climate change risk. Many climate \nchange scenarios were examined, and the reinforcement of the intake weir and floodwall for the \npowerhouse are in the project design as adaptation measures. \n \n                                                \n10 Established by ADB. \n11 Financing partners: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. \n ", "7 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n25.  An economic analysis indicates an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 10.9%. Given \nthe hurdle rate of 9.0%, the project is deemed economically viable. This considered the non-\nincremental benefits of fuel cost savings and avoided GHG emissions, otherwise the government \nwill have to rely on thermal power plants to meet power demand. Even without environmental \nbenefits, EIRR is 10.1%. The 2.7% financial internal rate of return compares favorably with the \n1.5% weighted average cost of capital. Financial viability is gauged by comparing the revenue \nand cost streams of with- and without-project scenarios, and sensitivity analysis confirmed that \nthe project remains economically and financially viable against adverse events. The financial \ninternal rate of return is based on the historical trajectory of end-user increases from 2010 to \n2018. The government adopted a new tariff methodology in April 2019 that will implement gradual \nrealization of improved cost recovery level as part of financial recovery action plan. But to be \nconservative, these tariff scenarios were not considered in the financial analysis, which is based \non the historical tariff level.12 In case of inadequate tariff, the government assured in a loan \ncovenant that it will provide debt servicing and operation coverage to Uzbekhydroenergo. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n26.  Sector governance. The government set up the Ministry of Energy on 1 February 2019 \nto regulate the sector. Uzbekhydroenergo\u2019s revenue stream depends on payments from the \ntransmission  company  as  the  country\u2019s  sole  buyer  of  electricity.  The  government  has  put \nsignificant effort on improving the governance and strengthening the financial sustainability of the \nsector. Early achievements include the implementation of time-bound financial recovery actions \nto improve the management capacity, financial resilience, and liquidity of state-owned enterprises \n(SOEs). Among the recovery measures, the government has prioritized revenue enhancement, \nincluding the adoption of the new cost recovery tariff and improvement of revenue collection \nthrough nationwide advanced metering projects. These measures have been covenanted under \nother ADB-funded projects. \n \n27.  Financial management. Uzbekhydroenergo\u2019s financial management risk is high and \nfinancial  management  capability  is  low.  As  a  newly  created  entity,  Uzbekhydroenergo\u2019s \naccounting and financial reporting policies and procedures follow the national accounting and \nauditing standards of its predecessors. Supported by external consultants, Uzbekhydroenergo \nintends to complete its first audited statements that follow International Financial Reporting \nStandards (IFRS) for FY2017\u2013FY2018 by end of 2019. Uzbekhydroenergo needs to strengthen \nits institutional capacity and staff skills to consolidate its accounts under national accounting and \nauditing  standards  and  IFRS,  and  to  conduct financial  planning  and  audit. To  meet IFRS \nrequirements, it has prioritized (i) the implementation of first-time asset revaluation; (ii) automation \nof the accounts consideration and management reporting process; and (iii) capacity enhancement \nmeasures, including recruiting an adequate number of qualified accounting staff. Integrity due \ndiligence conducted on Uzbekhydroenergo found no significant integrity risks. \n \n28.  Procurement. The procurement risk is moderate. Although the project is the first ADB-\nfunded project for Uzbekhydroenergo, it has sufficient domestic procurement experience and \nexperience in procuring goods and services under projects funded by bilateral donors. There are \nno limitations in domestic practices and procedures that restrict the application of the ADB \n                                                \n12 Based on the new tariff methodology, ADB proposed a 3-year tariff increase cycle to 2028 to ensure tariffs are \nincreased to full cost recovery. The government is reviewing the level of tariff increase. As of 15 August 2019, the \ngovernment increased residential tariff by 18% and other categories of customers by 36%.  \n ", "8 \nProcurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB \nBorrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). The lack of ADB-funded project experience can \nbe mitigated by engaging international project supervision consultants to aid Uzbekhydroenergo \nthroughout procurement and contract execution. ADB will also provide assistance, including \nprocurement training. \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and Uzbekhydroenergo. Specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n30.  Poverty and social. The major benefit of the project is the increased reliability of power \nsupply primarily in the vicinity of the project. This will provide stable access to grid-connected \nelectricity,  which  will  promote  business  expansion  and  create  job  opportunities  for  local \ncommunities, including poor and socially disadvantaged women. In the project site, only 24.2% \nof working-age women are employed compared with 65.5% of men. As high as 46.5% of women \nneither work nor look for jobs, compared with 2.6% of men. The project will therefore contribute \nto poverty reduction around the project site, including improving the condition of the access road. \nDuring construction, the project is expected to generate indicatively 400 jobs for skilled and \nunskilled laborers, including the poor, vulnerable groups, and women. \n \n31.  Gender. The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. Gender issues and \nopportunities for gender development were considered during project preparation based on the \ndue diligence on Uzbekhydroenergo and the project site. A gender action plan has been prepared \nto promote gender equality in Uzbekhydroenergo. Key features include (i) collecting, analyzing, \nmonitoring,  and  reporting  sex-disaggregated  data  and  information;  and  conducting  general \ngender awareness training for Uzbekhydroenergo employees (at least 50% will be women), \nincluding  on  preventing  sexual  harassment,  exploitation,  and  abuse; (ii)  recruiting  a  social \ndevelopment  and  gender  specialist  in  the  project  management  unit  (PMU);  (iii)  facilitating \nwomen\u2019s participation in project activities; and (iv) designing, adopting, and implementing a \ngender equality strategy and policy by and for Uzbekhydroenergo. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n32.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.13 \n \n33.  Environment (category A). A draft environmental impact assessment (EIA) report was \nprepared  and  disclosed  in  May  2019.  Public  consultation  was  conducted  for  the  nearest \ncommunities at the scoping stage and twice on the draft EIA. The EIA, which adequately \naddressed all issues raised during the consultations, identified the potential impacts that the \nproject could generate and proposed an adequate environmental management plan (EMP) with \nmitigation measures, a monitoring plan, cost estimates, and EMP implementation arrangements. \nThe EMP will form part of the bidding documents. \n \n34.  Environmental impacts that could occur during construction and operation are mainly \nwithin the sections of the Aksu River between the weir and the powerhouse that will experience \nreduced water flows, on the corridors of the transmission line and access roads, and on nearby \n                                                \n13 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n ", "9 \nvillages. The main impact during operations would be on the aquatic ecology and river ecosystem \nmainly related to the presence of the weir, which is an impassable obstacle to all fish, and the \nreduced flow, which will impact nearby villages and permanently impact the river ecosystem. As \npart of the EIA, an environmental-flow modeling was undertaken, and the study presents that the \nproject design maintains the acceptable flow to ensure the river is not significantly impacted \n(paras. 23 \u2013 24). A carefully designed fish ladder will be included as a mitigation strategy. \n \n35.  The Aksu River is heavily modified by the large multipurpose dam and HPPs about 12 km \ndownstream from the project area, which essentially dammed the valley. Information on the river\u2019s \nbiodiversity value suggests few species of fish live in the river, and none are protected or red-\nlisted nationally or internationally. 14 No vulnerable species were observed during inventories of \nthe area. Reduced water flow is an important concern for the local population, particularly in areas \nwhere piped waterway will pass, as some use river water for various purposes, including drinking. \nThe water balance assessment further suggested that the river will maintain adequate water for \npeople\u2019s daily use, livestock, and irrigation. \n \n36.  The PMU will implement the EMP in compliance with the Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009)  and  national  environmental  regulations.  International  and  national  environmental \nconsultants will strengthen the PMU\u2019s safeguard staff capacity, while environmental specialists of \nthe project supervision consultant will help the PMU implement the EMP. The engineering, \nprocurement, and construction contract will include a budget for implementing the mitigation \nmeasures. The PMU budget will include environmental consultant support, capacity building, and \nindependent  monitoring  with  the  local  environmental  authority.  The  project  will  establish  a \ngrievance redress mechanism to handle environmental and social safeguard issues. \n \n37.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The project does not envisage the acquisition of \nprivately owned land, and only state-owned land will be acquired. Construction of facilities, such \nas the weir, pipelines, and the transmission line, will affect 33 households and 204 people. Of \nthese, 27 households and 163 people are considered severely affected per the Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009). A resettlement plan disclosed in June 2019 has an entitlement matrix and \nresettlement budget to provide compensation at replacement cost and restore livelihoods as per \nthe Safeguard Policy Statement (2009); it will be updated to an implementation-ready plan upon \ncompletion  of  the  detailed  design  and  engineering  by  the  engineering,  procurement,  and \nconstruction contractor. Uzbekhydroenergo will provide adequate resources to comply with all \nsafeguard requirements in the resettlement plan. No physical and economic displacement will \noccur until full compensation at replacement cost and all other entitlements are paid to the \ndisplaced people following the final resettlement plan. \n \n38.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project will not affect indigenous peoples as \ndefined by the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n39.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.15 \n \n                                                \n14 The IUCN Red List is the world\u2019s most comprehensive inventory of the global conservation status of plant and animal \nspecies and is recognized as the most authoritative guide to the status of biological diversity.  \n15 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nInsufficient water volume for  While no internationally recognized mitigation mechanism exists for climate change, \npower generation because of  HPP outputs were optimized with due consideration of adverse climate change \nclimate change  impacts. \nDelayed procurement and  An international consulting firm will assist Uzbekhydroenergo in procurement and \nimplementation of turnkey  implementation supervision.
