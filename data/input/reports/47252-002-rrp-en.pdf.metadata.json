The report also describes proposed technical \nassistance (TA) for Strengthening Capacity for Urban Planning, Urban Design, and Investment \nPlanning. If the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me \nby the Board, approve the TA. \n \nThe project will improve the resilience and delivery of urban services and facilities in eight \n2. \nmunicipalities1 in the southern Terai region of Nepal bordering India, including four municipalities \nfrom  the  less-developed  Province  7  in  far  western  Nepal.2 The  project  will  support  municipal \ninfrastructure investments, urban planning, and institutional strengthening. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nNepal\u2019s urbanization and economic growth. Although Nepal has been urbanizing at a \n3. \nrapid  rate  of  6%  since  the  1970s,  its  economic growth  is  lower  than that  of other  South  Asian \ncountries.3 Inadequate urban planning, weak urban institutions and municipal finances, neglect \nof  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  and  limited  capabilities  for  urban  infrastructure \ndevelopment have partly contributed to the lower rate of growth.4 The government would need to \ndouble its share of gross domestic product spent on urban infrastructure to meet the backlog and \nfuture  demand  up  to  2030  with  an  estimated  $24.5  billion  for  its  217  municipalities.5 Planned \nurbanization through a regional approach can stimulate economic growth in Nepal, especially in \nthe  southern  Terai  region,  where  opportunities  for  economic  growth  have  increased  due  to \nregional cooperation and trade.6 \n \n4. \nImportance of investing in the Terai region. The Terai region has the country\u2019s largest \nurban population outside the Kathmandu and Pokhara valleys, and its urban areas are growing. \nMost  trade  in  landlocked  Nepal  flows  through  the  three  Terai  municipalities  of  Biratnagar \n(population: 235,000), Birgunj (population: 240,000) and Siddharthanagar (population: 73,000).7 \nA fourth municipality, Nepalgunj (population: 175,000), is a major industrial and business hub of \nits  province.  Along  the  border  with  India,  regional  clusters  of  nonfarm  economic  activities  are \nemerging,  which  could  be  fostered  to  boost  economic  growth.  Several  initiatives  have  been \ncompleted or are ongoing in the Terai, many supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nto facilitate trade and improve regional connectivity, rural\u2013urban links, power supply, agricultural \n\n                                                 \n1  The eight project municipalities are Biratnagar in Province 1; Birgunj in Province 2; Nepalgunj and Siddharthanagar \n\nin Province 5; and Bheemdatt, Dhangadhi, Godawari, and Shuklaphanta in Province 7. \n\n2  The project preparation was supported by technical assistance. ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance for the Far Western \nRegion  Urban  Development  Project.  Manila  (TA  8817-NEP,  approved  in  2014);  and  ADB.  2015.

Manila. \n\n6  The regional approach is an integrated and planned approach of spatial development of urban centers surrounded \nby adjacent or smaller municipalities and rural areas to enhance competitiveness and stimulate economic growth by \nfacilitating  common  infrastructure,  strategic  infrastructure,  proximity  to  supply  chains  and  networks,  and \nconcentration  of  human  resources  and  skills.  The  project  is  expected  to  lay  the  foundation  for  greater  regional \ndevelopment. \n\n7  World Bank. 2014. Nepal Trade Facilitation and Improvement Study. Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fproductivity, and the quality of technical education.8 ADB-financed urban projects are also near \ncompletion  in  the  four  regional  economic  centers  of  Biratnagar,  Birgunj,  Nepalgunj,  and \nSiddharthanagar.9 The urban projects have reduced the duration of flooding during heavy rains \nin  the  core  areas  of the four  municipalities from an  average  of  3.5  days to  3  hours.  Additional \nsupport  is  required  to  scale  up  previous  efforts  to  minimize  flooding,  strengthen  municipal \noperations, and make the Terai region more livable and competitive. \n \n5. \nInvesting in the Terai of Province 7. Province 7 in the far west of Nepal is one of the \npoorest  provinces  in  Nepal,  with  40%  of  the  population  living  below  the  poverty  line.10 Urban \ninfrastructure  and  basic  services  in  this  province  need  significant  improvement.  None  of  the \nProvince 7 municipalities has solid waste and wastewater collection and treatment facilities, and \nstorm  water  drainage  is  inadequate.  One-third  of  households  experience  chronic  waterlogging \nand/or do not have modern toilet facilities. Key roads are in poor condition and peri-urban areas \nare expanding haphazardly. Growth opportunities in the province are likely to increase with the \nanticipated  construction  of  the  Mahakali  River  Bridge  connecting  India  and  far  western  Nepal. \nInvestments in urban infrastructure and planned urbanization in Province 7 will have a multiplier \neffect on economic growth and job creation while reducing regional disparities. \n \n6. \nRegional Urban Development Project. The project will scale up investments in the four \nmunicipalities  of  Biratnagar,  Birgunj,  Nepalgunj,  and  Siddharthanagar,  where  ADB\u2019s  ongoing \nurban  projects  are  near  completion.  The  project  aims  to  reduce  flooding  duration  to  less  than \n1 hour in these municipalities. In the four municipalities of Province 7 (Bheemdatt, Dhangadhi, \nGodawari,  and  Shuklaphanta),  ADB for  the first time  will  invest  in  urban  infrastructure that  will \nimprove flood management, mobility, and solid waste management. The project will support the \ndevelopment of urban plans and bylaws that reflect greater disaster risk resilience, improved land \nmanagement, and regional development. The subprojects were selected based on households\u2019 \npriorities,  the  municipalities\u2019  priorities,  feasibility  studies,  and  institutional  mandate.  To  create \nincentives for the Province 7 municipalities to improve governance and financial and operational \nthe  performance-based \nperformance, \nsocioeconomic  development  program  (PBSEDP). 11  The  project  will  also  support  a  project \ndevelopment facility12 for the preparation of a pipeline of urban infrastructure projects with high \nreadiness to reduce future startup delays.  \n \n\nthe  project  will  support \n\nimplementation  of \n\nthe \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2006.

The project is aligned with Nepal\u2019s Fourteenth \n7. \nPlan and with the National Urban Policy 2007, which aim for a balanced national urban system \nby developing centers of growth that provide an alternative to the Kathmandu Valley.13 The project \nis also aligned with Nepal\u2019s National Urban Development Strategy (2017), which also aims for \nregionally balanced development, as well as more planned and sustainable urbanization (footnote \n4). The project is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 for Nepal,14 which \nsupports  the  government\u2019s  development  objective  of  sustainable,  broad-based,  and  inclusive \neconomic  growth  through  the  development  of  urban  infrastructure  and  better  access  to  basic \nservices. \n \n8. \nLessons.  The  project  incorporates  the  following  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  previous  urban \ndevelopment operations in Nepal and other countries: (i) provide an integrated set of investments \nthat  will  have  a  tangible  impact;15 (ii)  secure  early  commitment  of  municipalities,  including  on \nsafeguards compliance and  land  acquisition; (iii)  provide  significant  support  and monitoring for \ninstitutional  strengthening  and  an  increase  in  own-source  revenue; 16  (iv)  provide  adequate \nresources in civil works contracts for shifting of utilities and utility mapping; (v) include a regional \ndimension for planning and development to tackle challenges more holistically; and (vi) ensure \nprojects with high readiness. \n \n9. \nValue added by ADB assistance. The project will improve capacity and competitiveness \nof border municipalities and complement the efforts of the ADB-supported South Asia Subregional \nEconomic  Cooperation  Program,  which  has  enabled  greater  connectivity  and  trade  facilitation \nbetween  Nepal  and  other  countries  in  the  region.  The  project  builds  on  ADB\u2019s  long-standing \npartnership  and  experience  supporting  urban  development  in  Nepal  and  will  reduce  regional \ninequalities  by  supporting  Province  7.  ADB  assistance  emphasizes  resilience  in  spatial  and \ninfrastructure  planning  and  sustainability  of  infrastructure  through  (i)  high-quality  designs, \nincluding  for  climate  resilience;  (ii)  support  and  monitoring  of  action  plans  to  increase \nmunicipalities\u2019 own-source revenue; and (iii) O&M capacity building. The project will introduce a \nPBSEDP and a project development facility, both of which address development challenges in a \nnovel  manner.  The  PBSEDP  is  a  grant  provided  to  Province  7  project  municipalities  upon \nachieving  governance  and  institutional  performance  parameters. The  project  complements  the \nwork of other development partners in various municipalities on disaster risk management and \npublic financial management. \n \nB. \n \nThe project is aligned with the following impacts: sustainable, inclusive, and resilient urban \n10. \nareas developed; and a balanced and prosperous subnational urban system achieved (footnote \n4). The project will have the following outcome: quality, sustainability, and disaster resilience of \nurban services, and competitiveness in eight municipalities of the Terai region improved.17 \n \nC. \n \n11. \nOutput  1:  Urban  infrastructure  in  eight  municipalities  with  climate-resilient  and \nsustainable designs constructed or rehabilitated.

The PBSEDP \nfunds may be used as per the agreed annual program on small community infrastructure, capacity \nbuilding  for  municipal  staff  and  communities,  and  outreach  activities.  Detailed  guidelines  for \nplanning, implementation, financial management, and reporting will guide the program.19  Salient \nsubprojects under output 1 include improving the main access road from central Siddharthanagar \nto  its  international  airport,  being  upgraded  with  ADB  financing  and  expected  to  stimulate  the \nmunicipality\u2019s growth; improving border access roads; improving the eastern section of Birgunj\u2019s \nbypass  road  as  part  of  the  municipality\u2019s  planned  expansion;  strengthening  resilience  by \nincreasing  stormwater  drainage  capacity;  and  expanding  wastewater  service  coverage  in \nBiratnagar. \n \nOutput  2:  Municipal  capacity  strengthened.  The  project  will  ensure  that  (i)  urban \n12. \ndevelopment plans and planning and building bylaws with disaster risk resilience and inclusive \naccessibility and safety features are adopted in Province 7 project municipalities; (ii) O&M plans \nare prepared and reflected in the municipalities\u2019 annual budgets; (iii) a house-numbering method \nbased on a geographic information system is developed and includes 80% of households in core \nareas; (iv) computerized property tax systems are installed in Godawari and Biratnagar with 70% \nof property records encoded; (v) improved municipal organizational structures, including a social \ndevelopment section, are approved by the municipal councils of Godawari and Shuklaphanta; (vi) \n40  municipal  staff  (33%  women)  report  knowledge  on  mainstreaming  GESI  approaches  into \nplanning and operations; and (vii) municipal office buildings for Godawari and Shuklaphanta are \nconstructed following energy-efficient and disaster-resilient standards.  \n \nOutput 3: Project preparation capacity improved. Output 3 will support the Department \n13. \nof  Urban  Development  and  Building  Construction  (DUDBC)  and  municipalities  to  develop  an \ninvestment pipeline with high readiness by funding consultants to prepare detailed project reports \nthrough a project development facility.20 The project development facility will support preparation \nof detailed project reports for a multisector subregional investment program; and for solid waste \nmanagement (SWM), drainage, roads, water supply, and sanitation subsectors.

Under the first output, the \nTRTA  will  develop  urban  design,  landscaping,  and  architectural  guidelines  for  Nepal\u2019s \nmunicipalities, and support the review of multiple city development plans under preparation by \nDUDBC.  Under  the  second  output,  the  TRTA  will  (i)  refine  and  improve  the  methodology  and \napproach  to  existing  urban  infrastructure  investment  programs;  (ii)  restructure  and  update \nDUDBC\u2019s  business  plan,  taking  into  consideration  the  National  Urban  Development  Strategy \napproved  in  2017  (footnote  4);  (iii)  strengthen  capacity  of  and  support  the  DUDBC  and \nmunicipalities  in reviewing the  engineering designs  and related  safeguard  documents;  and  (iv) \ndevelop phased investment plans for two large municipalities (or cluster of municipalities). The \nTRTA is estimated to cost $1.1 million, of which $1.0 million will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6).25 The government will provide counterpart \nsupport  in  the  form  of  staff,  office  space,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  MOUD  will  be  the \nexecuting agency for the TA, which will be implemented over a period of 2.5 years. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n20. \nThe appraisal of the subprojects confirmed technical viability and compatibility with local \nimplementation  and  O&M  capacity.  The  pending  detailed  design  will  adhere  to  subproject \nselection  and  agreed  design  criteria,  address  the  flood  risks  and  increases  in  rainfall  due  to \nclimate  change,  and  analyze  least  life-cycle  costs.  Municipal  buildings  will  be  earthquake \nresistant. Stormwater management planning will take a catchment-wide approach. Utility mapping \nwill be done in project areas to provide municipalities with the required geospatial data to improve \nmanagement of underground assets. Technical audits will be undertaken through a government \nagency to help ensure the quality of works. \n \nB. \n \n21. \nEconomic  analysis.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  was  estimated  at  11.9%, \nindicating sufficient economic return compared with the economic opportunity cost of capital of \n9.0%. The results of the sensitivity analysis are also satisfactory against all downside risks, i.e., \n(i) a capital cost overrun of 20%, (ii) an overrun in O&M costs of 20%, (iii) a decline in estimated \nbenefits of 20%, and (iv) a 1-year delay in operations. \n \nFinancial analysis. The financial analysis assessed whether the municipalities can cover \n22. \nthe incremental costs of the project since not all subprojects will generate revenues. The overall \nmunicipal financial position is projected reflecting incremental revenues and expenditures as well \nas debt service requirements based on past performance, growth trend of revenue streams, and \nexpected  population  growth.  The  analysis  confirms  that  the  municipalities  will  have  adequate \nfinancial capacity to cover counterpart costs, incremental O&M costs of the subprojects, and debt \nservice requirements of existing loans. \n \nC. \n \n23. \nFinancial management. The overall risk assessment for the project is substantial. The \nPCO  and  non-Province  7  municipalities  have  experience  in  implementing  ADB  projects.  For \nProvince 7 municipalities, extensive support to the regional PIU and municipalities is needed for \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                 \n25  Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fefficient  financial  management  and  implementation.  DUDBC  and  all  project  municipalities  can \nmanage  funds  with  the  following  mitigation  measures:  (i)  training  on  project  financial \nmanagement;  (ii) development  of  a  computerized  accounting  system  for  PCO  and  PIUs;  (iii) \nestablishment  of  an  internal  audit  section  in  Godawari  and  Shuklaphanta  and  appointment  of \nqualified internal auditors in Biratnagar and Birgunj; (iv) enhancement of the accounting, billing \nand collection, and audit systems for Province 7 municipalities; and (v) preparation of municipal \nfinancial operating plans prior to formulation of budget, and implementation and close monitoring \nof plans to improve own-source revenue collection. The financial management arrangements are \nexpected to be satisfactory. \n \n24. \nProcurement.  All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) or, for national competitive bidding, the public \nprocurement monitoring office\u2019s standard bidding document as approved by ADB. All procurement \nof consultants, including for the project development facility, will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nuse  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  An  assessment  concluded  that  the \noverall procurement risk for the project is substantial. Procurement specialists from the Province \n7  design  and  supervision  consulting  firm  will  support  the  regional  PIU,  and  the  project \nmanagement consultant will support the PCO to prepare and evaluate bids. \n \n25. \nAnticorruption measures. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government, MOUD, DUDBC, and project municipalities. The \nspecific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  PAM.  The \nconstitutional anticorruption agency is the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority, \nwhich  is  empowered  to  investigate  any  project  irregularities.  The  PCO  and  PIUs  will  follow \ngovernment  rules  and  procedures  for  expenses  and  revenues.  They  will  establish  a  project \nwebsite for transparency and a system for handling complaints. \n \nD. \n \n26. \nThe  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  A  summary  poverty \nreduction and social strategy and a GESI action plan have been prepared. The project will include \nsafety  features  such  as  streetlights,  road  markings,  ramps,  and  footpaths.  The  project  will \nstrengthen the capacity of social development sections in project municipalities. The project will \nalso support Province 7 municipalities in implementing the PBSEDP, which focuses on improving \ngovernance  and  service  delivery,  as  well  as  implementing  small  infrastructure  in  low-income \ncommunities  through  the  community  procurement  method.  The  project  will  promote  the \nparticipation of women and other disadvantaged groups through community-based committees. \n \nE. \n \n27. \nThe PAM outlines the detailed implementation arrangements for safeguards. DUDBC has \nthe  capacity  to  implement  safeguards  based  on  its  experience  in  the  ongoing  ADB-financed \nprojects.  Any  subproject  that  causes  significant  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, or indigenous peoples will be excluded from project financing. The PCO and PIUs \nhave adequate capacity to manage environmental and social impacts. A consultant will support \nand build the capacity of the PCO and PIUs in social safeguard planning and implementation. \nSupervision  consultants  will  supervise  day-to-day  safeguard  implementation.  The  entitlement \nmatrix includes measures to ensure compensation at replacement cost, rehabilitation assistance \nand special measures for vulnerable households, and criteria for accepting voluntary demolition \nof minor structures.  \n \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nSafeguards \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fland  acquisition  and \n\nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  The \n\nEnvironment  (category  B).  An  environmental  assessment  review  framework  and  four \n28. \ninitial environmental examinations (IEEs)26 with environmental management plans were prepared \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and government laws. IEEs will be \nupdated  based  on  the  detailed  design.  The  documents  were  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website  and \nrelevant  information  disclosed  to  project  communities.  The  IEEs  concluded  that  no  significant \nadverse impacts are anticipated. Any impacts will be mitigated through measures outlined in the \nenvironmental management plans. The drainage, road, and SWM works will reduce water and air \npollution. The PCO will submit environment reports to ADB semiannually. Consultation and public \nparticipation will continue throughout implementation, and any environmental grievances will be \nhandled in accordance with the grievance redress mechanism established for the project. \n \n29. \ninvoluntary \nresettlement impact assessment confirms that impacts are not significant. The land acquisition \nprocess for a total of 30 hectares required for landfill sites has begun, and 65% is government \nland. A total of 27 households (172 people) are expected to be affected, of which 15 households \n(92  persons)  will  be  significantly  affected  because  they  lose  10%  or  more  of  their  productive \nassets. The  land  acquisition  will  affect  three  indigenous  households.  A  combined  resettlement \nand  indigenous  peoples  plan  (CRIPP)  and  three  due  diligence  reports 27  were  prepared  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  to  mitigate  negative  impacts.  The \nresettlement  impacts, mitigation measures,  policy  provisions,  and  SWM subproject  details  and \nrelated impacts were discussed with potentially affected persons. Meaningful consultations shall \ncontinue throughout implementation. \n \n30. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  B).  Indigenous  peoples  live  in  the  project  area.  No \nconfirmed negative impacts were identified, except for the acquisition of land belonging to three \nindigenous households for the landfill site in Dhangadhi. Indigenous peoples living in the project \narea  are  likely  to  experience  positive  impacts  thanks  to  better  roads,  drainage,  SWM,  and \nsanitation.  The  PBSEDP  will  include  an  awareness  program  for  indigenous  peoples  and  their \nparticipation  will  be  ensured  during  subproject  design  and  implementation.  A  combined \nresettlement and indigenous peoples planning framework was prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009) and applicable laws. If required, the framework will guide the \npreparation of resettlement and indigenous peoples plans during the detailed design. The PIUs \nwere trained on the framework. \n \nF. \n \n31.  Major risks and suggested mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4. All major risks  \nare described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.28 The overall benefits \nare expected to outweigh the costs of mitigation. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nRisks \nWeak institutional \ncapacity of project \nmunicipalities on \nfinancial management \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nSupport for increasing municipalities\u2019 own-source revenue, development of \ncomputerized accounting system, establishment of an internal audit section and \nrecruitment of additional financial administration staff in Godawari and \nShuklaphanta, and support to strengthen internal audit in Biratnagar and Birgunj. \n\n                                                 \n26 IEEs were prepared for Dhangadhi, Godawari, Nepalgunj, and Siddharthanagar. \n27 CRIPP  for  landfill  site  in  Dhangadhi;  and  due  diligence  reports  for  subprojects  in  Biratnagar,  Godawari,  and \n\nShuklaphanta municipalities. \n\n28 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nInsufficient municipal \ncounterpart funding  \nPoor oversight of \nconsultant and \ncontractor \nperformance \nLocal opposition to \nlandfill construction \n\nBehavioral change \ntakes longer than the \nproject timeline \n\nPolitical instability \nleads to strikes that \ndelay works \n\nMitigation Measures \nProvide support through the project for the municipalities to achieve the targets \nagreed in the comprehensive financial management improvement plans. \nPMC and PCO shall undertake regular site visits.
