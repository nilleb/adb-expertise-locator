Based on demonstrated \nmarket  demand,  the  project  will  help  develop  and  implement  industry-endorsed  competency \nstandards  and  competency-based  training  (CBT),  upgrade  the  physical  learning  environment, \ntrain  TVET  teachers  and  masters,  and  strengthen  governance  and  management  of  the  TVET \nsystem. To ensure market responsiveness, the project will promote private sector participation \nin TVET policy, operations, and service delivery.3 \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nThe 1992\u20131998 civil war in Tajikistan resulted in significant emigration of skilled workers. \n3. \nTajikistan\u2019s gross domestic product growth averaged 7.2% per year during 1998\u20132008, largely \nbecause of high prices for aluminum and cotton exports, and the inflow of remittances, primarily \nfrom  the  Russian  Federation.4 The  global  financial  crisis  reduced  growth  to  3.9%  in  2009,  but \ngrowth  recovered  to  an  average  of  6.5%  from  2010  to  2014.  The  poverty  incidence  declined \nsteadily from  96%  in  1999 to  32%  in  2014,  but remains  the  highest  in  Central  and West  Asia. \nThe  benefits  of  economic  growth  have  not  been  inclusive.  Most  employment  is  in  agriculture, \nwhich  has  the  lowest  average  monthly  income.  Agriculture\u2019s  share  of  total  employment  has \nincreased  steadily,  from  43%  in  1990  to  66.1%  in  2013,  while  agriculture\u2019s  share  of  GDP \ndeclined  from  30.1%  to  21.1%.5 The  average  productivity  per  agricultural  worker  has  declined \nbetween  2005  and  2015.  Industry  to  provide  the  foundation  for  sustained  growth  and \nemployment is undeveloped.  \n\n4. \nThe  stated  goal  of  the  National  Development  Strategy  of  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  for \nthe  Period  to  2015  is  sustainable  economic  development  and  poverty  reduction.6 The  three \nstrategic  development  objectives  are  (i)  ensuring  food  security,  (ii)  achieving  energy \nsovereignty,  and  (iii)  overcoming  communication  obstacles.  The  strategic  priority  sectors  are \nagriculture,  energy,  transport,  and  communications.  The  major  challenge \nis  structural \ntransformation  of  the  economy,  both  to  sustain  growth  and  to  ensure  that  the  benefits  of \ndevelopment are widely shared. \n\nThe  sources  of the  previous  high growth rates\u2014demand for  aluminum  and  cotton,  and \n5. \nremittances from migrant workers\u2014have all been affected by external factors. The demand for \n\n                                                \n1   Financing partners: the government of Australia, Norway, Spain, and Sweden. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  ADB.  2013.

Manila (TA 8546-TAJ). \n\n4  Remittances accounted for 50% of GDP in 2013 and 42% of GDP in 2014. \n5   Statistical Agency of Tajikistan. 2014. Tajikistan Statistical Bulletin.

Dushanbe. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nand  prices  of  aluminum  and  cotton  declined  significantly  during  2011\u20132014.  Remittances  are \nunder serious threat due to the slowdown of the Russian Federation economy, which hosts over \n90%  of Tajik migrant  workers.  Remittances  declined from  $4.4  billion  in 2013  to  $3.9  billion  in \n2014,  dropping  further  to  $1.2  billion  at  the  end  of  June  2015. 7  In  addition,  the  Russian \nFederation has tightened its migration policies, preventing some 210,000 Tajik migrant workers \nfrom reentry. An additional 200,000 migrants are at risk of being deported. When combined with \n150,000 new entrants into the labor force each year, the unemployment situation in Tajikistan is \nextremely serious. \n\n6. \nThere is an urgent need to address the unemployment crisis.  Mechanisms are needed \nto  facilitate  job  search  for  returning  migrants.  Skills  upgrading,  basic  skills  training  and  quick-\nturnaround certification, and access to credit to promote self-employment must be put in place \nas  soon  as  possible.  A  comprehensive  program  for  job  creation  needs  to  be  designed  and \nimplemented.  Jobs  must  be  created  in rural  areas.  The  industry  and  services  sectors  need  to \nestablish more sustainable, labor-intensive, small and medium-sized enterprises.  \n\nIssues  in  the  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training  system.  The  TVET \n7. \nsystem  in  Tajikistan  is  largely  supply-driven.  Most  course  structure  and  content  is  outdated, \nresulting  in  a  mismatch  between  graduate  skills  and  labor  market  demand.  Ineffective \nengagement  of  private  sector  partners  in TVET,  both  employers  and  private  trainers,  is  a key \nproblem.  Skills  gaps  to  address  energy  efficiency  and  clean  energy  technologies  are  also  an \nissue.  Most  TVET  institutions  have  obsolete  and  inadequate  equipment,  dilapidated  school \nbuildings, and poorly maintained dormitories. The condition of physical facilities and the lack of \nmodern  curricula  reinforce  the  generally  low  social  image  of  TVET,  and  contribute  to  the \nsystem\u2019s inability to attract students. \n\n8. \nPrimary TVET suffers from deficiencies in both quality and quantity. The total enrollment \nin  63  lyceums  in  2014  was  21,593  students,  of  whom  18%  were  girls,  an  average  enrollment \nsize  of  343  students  per  lyceum.  The  small  average  enrollment  size  results  in  low  student\u2013\nteacher  ratios  (9:1),  high  unit  cost  (TJS1,400  per  student  per  year  compared  with  TJS900  in \ngeneral  education),  and  a  low  percentage  share  of  internally  generated  funds  (22%)  to  total \nfunding (footnote 3).   \n\n9. \nWeak faculty development has resulted in inadequately trained teaching staff. The salary \nscale of TVET teachers and masters remains very low compared  with other civil servants, and \nwith  employees  in  industry  and  services  sectors.  Investment  in  TVET  teacher  salaries  and \ntraining  is  required  to  build  capacity,  modernize  technical  and  training  skills,  match  skills  to \nemerging market needs, and increase retention of qualified TVET teachers and masters. \n\n10. \nThe  governance  and  management  structure  of  primary  TVET  institutions  is  weak,  and \nneeds  much  closer  alignment  with  the  labor  market.  The  supply-driven  funding  system  and \nineffective  management  approach  restricts  the  flexibility  of  TVET  institutions.  A  regular  labor \nmarket  assessment  does  not  exist  currently,  and  is  badly  needed  to  identify  and  address \nemerging  needs  and  skills  shortages.  The  labor  market  survey  conducted  during  the  project \ndesign, which involved detailed discussions with employers, identified 17 occupations with good \nemployment  potential  in  five  priority  sectors:  agriculture  and  food  processing,  construction, \nenergy, tourism and services, and transport and communication.8 The project proposes to invest \n\n                                                \n7  National Bank of Tajikistan. 2015. Quarterly report. Dushanbe. \n8  ADB.  School  Mapping  Survey.  Manila.  Unpublished.  The  priority  occupations  include  farm  worker,  bookkeeper, \ntractor operator-mechanic, fruit and vegetable processing worker, mason, fitter-plumber, finisher, gas and electrical \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nin key skills training in these sectors, in close collaboration with employers to match demand. \n\n11. \nStrategic fit. The project supports the National Development Strategy of the Republic of \nTajikistan for the period to 2015 and a state program to reform the TVET system for 2012\u20132020. \nGiven the critical migrant situation, the project is particularly well-timed to provide essential rapid \ncertification and other support. The project is consistent with the education sector policy and the \nMidterm Review of Strategy 2020.9 It aligns with ADB\u2019s interim country partnership strategy for \nTajikistan, 2015.10 It is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Tajikistan, 2015\u2013\n2017.11 The  project  is  the  first  ADB  support  for  the  TVET  system  in  Tajikistan  and  will  be  the \nlargest TVET project to date in the country.  \n\n12. \nLessons. The project design has taken into account lessons from previous ADB TVET \nprojects,  including  (i)  institutionalizing  mechanisms  to  engage  employers  and  other  social \npartners  in  the  TVET  system;  (ii)  ensuring  the  sustainability  of  TVET  system  reforms  through \nincorporation  in  regular  Ministry  of  Labour,  Migration  and  Employment  (MOLME)  activities;       \n(iii) involving key stakeholders to foster a strong sense of industry ownership; and (iv) ensuring \nthe legal and regulatory framework supports TVET system reform. \n\nthrough  GIZ, \n\nDevelopment  partner  coordination.  During  project  design,  ADB  consulted  German \n13. \ndevelopment  cooperation \nInternational  Labour \nOrganization,  the  Islamic  Development  Bank,  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF), \nand the University of Central Asia (Aga Khan Foundation), which all have small TVET projects. \nADB  is  a  member  of  the  TVET  Coordination  Working  Group,  which  was  established  by  the \ngovernment and development partners to promote TVET policy dialogue and support the reform \nagenda. \n\nthe  European  Union, \n\nthe \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  will  be  a  national  workforce with an  increased  proportion  of skilled  workers \n14. \nemployed  in  Tajikistan.  The  outcome  will  be  a  demand-driven,  quality-assured,  and  flexible \nTVET system responsive to labor market needs. \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n15. \nThe project has four outputs: (i) technical and vocational education and training system \nmethodology  modernized,  (ii)  physical  learning  facilities  upgraded,  (iii)  access  to  quality \nprograms  improved,  and  (iv)  governance  and  management  strengthened.  The  government, \nprivate  sector  (employers  and  private  training  providers),  nongovernment  organizations,  and \ndevelopment partners will be involved in delivering the outputs.12 \n\n16. \nOutput  1:  Technical  and  vocational  education  and  training  system  methodology \nmodernized. The  project  will  develop  competency  standards  and  assessment tools  aligned to \nan  adapted  European  qualification  framework.13 Competency-based  training  (CBT)  curriculum \n\n                                                                                                                                                       \nwelder,  building  electrician,  industrial  electrician,  tailor,  cosmetologist,  domestic  appliance  repairman,  cook-\nconfectioner, seller, truck driver, and heavy equipment operator-mechanic. \n\n9  ADB. 2014.

The  occupations  have  been  selected  based  on  the  government\u2019s \ndevelopment priorities, a labor market survey conducted during project preparation, and inputs \nfrom  key  stakeholders.14 An  implementation  plan  for  the  development  of  the  CBT  components \nhas  been  prepared,  involving  industry  working  groups,  training  providers,  and  development \npartners. 15  Guidelines  and  manuals  will  be  prepared  to  promote  future  sustainability  and \ndevelopment,  and periodic  upgrading  of competency  standards, qualifications,  and curriculum. \nThe  Center  for  Training  Methodology  and  Monitoring  of  Education  Quality  (CTMMEQ)  under \nMOLME  will  implement  output  1.  The  project  will  build  CTMMEQ  capacity  and  facilitate  a \ntwinning  partnership  with  a  reputable  foreign  workforce  development  agency.  The  CBT \ncurriculum  and  learning  materials  will  be  piloted  in  29  TVET  institutions,  which  were  selected \nbased on criteria agreed by MOLME and ADB.16 The project will strengthen the selected TVET \ninstitutions\u2019  core  programs  to  enable  them  to  serve  as  resource  centers  for  other  TVET \ninstitutions in their respective sectors. \n\n17. \nOutput 2: Physical learning facilities upgraded. The project will upgrade the physical \nlearning  and  teaching  facilities  of  the  selected  TVET  institutions.  The  design  of  rehabilitation \nworks  takes  into  consideration  teaching  requirements,  student  needs,  and  environmental  and \nsocial  safeguards.  In  three  project  sites,  green  reconstruction  and  power  approaches  will \ndemonstrate options for general building rehabilitation, and help train teachers and students in \ngreen  reconstruction.  The  project  will  also  support  gender-appropriate  dormitory  upgrades, \nwhich will help increase female student access to formal TVET system. \n\n18. \nOutput  3:  Access  to  quality  programs  improved.  The  project  will  develop  an  in-\nservice  TVET  teacher  training  plan  to  provide  teachers  and  masters  with  (i)  a  clear \nunderstanding of the CBT methodology, (ii) competencies in student-centered training delivery, \nand  (iii)  practical  knowledge  and  skills  in  respective  technology  areas  through  industry \ninternships. 17 The  MOLME  Engineering  Pedagogical  College  in  Dushanbe  (EPCD)  will  lead \nimplementation  of  the  in-service  teacher  training.  The  project  will  develop  and  implement  a \nmarket-responsive and inclusive training program (MRITP) to help the TVET system extend its \nreach  to  migrants,  the  disadvantaged  and  vulnerable,  and  respond  to  urgent  skills  needs  of \nmajor  investment  projects.18 The  delivery  of  eligible  MRITP  training  programs  will  be  open  to \nboth  public  and  private  providers.  To  address  limited  access  to  TVET  by  girls  and  gender \nsegregation  of  occupations,  the  Gender  Equity  Model  Program  (GEMP)  will  be  piloted  in  five \nselected  lyceums. 19 This  pilot  will  encourage  girls  to  pursue  nontraditional  occupations  and \nimprove  their  skills,  employability,  and  incomes.  The  project  will  provide  1-year  stipends  to \n2,230 women and girls enrolling in nontraditional courses, to be paid during the last 6 months of \nstudy and the first 6 months of their employment. \n\n19. \nOutput  4:  Governance  and  management  strengthened.

The  MRITP  will  benefit  15,000 \npersons. Approximately 2,230 female students will benefit through the GEMP and will increase \ntheir skills and employability.25 About 25,000 walk-ins, mostly migrant workers, will assess their \nskills  to  facilitate  their  job  search  process.  Employers  will  benefit  from  TVET  graduates  with \nimproved  skills,  resulting  in  higher  productivity,  and  cost-sharing  of  graduate  GEMP  scholars \nduring  6-month  apprenticeships.  Teachers  and  masters  will  benefit  from  staff  development \ntraining  programs.  Managers  of  selected  TVET  institutions  will  strengthen  their  skills  through \nmanagement  training.  The  TVET  system  will  benefit  from  the  introduction  of  CBT  policies, \nguidelines, and procedures, enabling improved national policies on skills development. \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n26. \nEconomic  benefits.  The  economic  benefits  of  the  project  will  be  mainly  derived  from \nthe increased workers\u2019 productivity and improved industry profitability. Direct economic benefits \nwill  flow  from  the  increased  numbers  of  skilled  TVET graduates  who  find  direct  wage-  or  self-\nemployment,  and start  businesses  that  may  employ  other  workers.  Indirect  economic  benefits \noccur  from  (i)  an  increase  in  the  number  of  trained  employed  persons;  (ii)  incremental \n                                                \n25 Employability indicates the number of graduates employed in their field within 90 days of graduation. The data will \n\nbe gathered through tracer studies of graduates during project implementation. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nproductivity gains resulting from improved quality and efficiency of training, expressed in terms \nof the incremental income (premium on wages) of the graduates; and (iii) increased remittances \nowing  to  diversification  of  migration  destinations  and  increased  earnings  for  better-trained \nworkers. The project economic internal rate of return is estimated at 14.48%. \n\n27. \nFinancial  sustainability.  The  project  is  financially  sustainable.  With  the  new  CBT \ncurriculum,  upgraded  facilities,  and  trained  teachers  and  masters,  the  capacity  of  project \nlyceums and ALCs to raise revenues will be significantly enhanced. Potential revenue sources \ninclude offering  new  CBT-certifiable short courses  to the  public,  customized  training  programs \nfor  employees  of  partner  industries,  job  contracts  with  industries,  production  and  sale  of \nproducts made by lyceums and ALCs, and rental of upgraded facilities. The government plans \nto  increase  TVET  budget  allocations  nominally  by  5%  annually  under  the  state  program  on \nTVET reforms for 2013\u20132020. \n\nB. \n\nGovernance \n\nThe  financial  management  assessment  identified  the  main  financial  management  risks \n28. \nas (i) low financial management capacity, (ii) a manual payment system, (iii) weak internal audit, \n(iv)  lack  of  an  integrated  financial  management  information  system,  (v)  no  external  audit,  and \n(vi)  lack  of  experience  with  ADB  financial  management  requirements  and  disbursement \nprocedures.  MOLME\u2019s  overall  financial  management  risk  prior  to  mitigation  is  high.  An  action \nplan  is  outlined  to  improve  MOLME  financial  management  by  recruiting  qualified  and \nexperienced accounting experts, providing training to finance staff, using accounting software to \nautomate  accounting  and  reporting,  and  hiring  a  qualified  external  auditor  to  audit  the  project \nfinancial statements. \n\n29.  MOLME  has  limited  exposure  to  international  procurement  practice. 26  The  national \nprocurement law does not provide standard bidding documents or procurement guidelines. The \nproject  will  support  MOLME  by  recruiting  international  and  national  procurement  experts  to \nassist  with  bidding  documents,  bidding,  bid  evaluation,  contract  award  and  contract \nmanagement, and extension of local language use in documents and advertising. Governance \nwill  be  improved  through  close  monitoring,  enhanced  financial  management  processes, \nimproved  internal  audit, and  external  audit.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to \ndate)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  MOLME.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n\nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n30. \nPoverty. About two-thirds of the labor force has low skill levels. The project will benefit \nlow-  and  unskilled  youth  and  adults  who  will  obtain  competitive  technical  qualifications,  skills, \nand jobs from improved TVET training. The poor and vulnerable groups will be trained under the \nMRITP and linked directly to employment opportunities. Returning migrants, who are particularly \nvulnerable,  will  obtain  skills  certification  and  improve  their  job  options  at  home  and  abroad. \nImproved  accommodation  in  rehabilitated  dormitories  will  improve  access  to  TVET  training  for \ngirls,  women,  and  students from remote  areas.  The  proposed infrastructure  improvements  will \nsubstantially improve learning environments and the quality of life of students and TVET staff. \n\n31. \nGender. The project is categorized as gender equity. It will increase girls\u2019 enrollment in \nnontraditional  courses  and  completion  of  formal  primary  TVET,  thus  enhancing  employment \n\n                                                \n26 Procurement Capacity Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nreadiness. The gender action plan ensures that gender is mainstreamed in the improved TVET \nsystem.27 The  GEMP  will  demonstrate  how  temporary  special  measures  in  five  lyceums  can \ncreate  an  enabling  environment  for  girls  to  be  trained  in  nontraditional  occupations,  improving \ntheir job and income opportunities. \n\nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n32. \nThe project is classified category B for environment. A consolidated initial environmental \nexamination  and  environmental  management  plan  was  prepared  for  rehabilitation  of  selected \nTVET  institutions  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  Potential \nnegative environmental impacts include removal, handling, and disposal of old asbestos cement \nroofing, dust and solid waste, and occupational and community safety risks. Adequate mitigation \nmeasures  will  be  implemented.  Over  465  potentially  affected  persons  were  publicly  consulted \nfrom  December  2014  to  March  2015.  The  initial  environmental  examination  and  the \nenvironmental management plan were disclosed on the ADB website on 31 March 2015. \n\nThe project is classified as category C for involuntary resettlement. The project activities \n33. \nwill not require land acquisition or resettlement. Resettlement due diligence confirmed that there \nare no campus legacy issues. Classroom and dormitory rehabilitation will take place on existing \ncampuses. If any additional land requirements or involuntary resettlement impacts are identified, \na resettlement plan will be prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and \napproved by ADB before any related civil works contract is awarded. The executing agency will \nsubmit semiannual monitoring reports to ADB for review and disclosure. The project is classified \nas  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  No  project  activities  will  adversely  affect  indigenous \npeoples. \n\nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe  overall  risk  is  medium  with  mitigation  measures.  The  integrated  benefits  and \n34. \nimpacts  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are \nsummarized in Table 4 and are described in the risk assessment and risk management plan.28  \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nRisks \nIndustries (employers) are \nreluctant to participate in \nproject activities  \nTeachers and masters resist \nchange and implementation \nof the  curriculum \nLimited capacity of MOLME \nto manage procurement and \ncontract administration  \n\nProcurement delays may \nimpact rehabilitation \nschedule \nLack of competition for \nundertaking national works \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe project will support the organization, strengthening, and operation of \n5  priority  industry  associations.  The  project  steering  committee  and \nTVET National Coordination Council will support industry participation.   \nIntensive  training  for  teachers  and  masters,  and  an  incentive  and \npromotion program for those certified as competent by EPCD will help in \nadjustment. \nAn  international  consultant  will  be  hired  to  help  with  bid  preparation, \ntendering,  evaluation  and  contract  award.  The  PAG  and  MOLME \nprocurement  staff  will  be  trained  in  procurement  and  disbursement \nprocedures. \nClose  monitoring  of  each  procurement  stage  and  pre-bid  meetings  will \nbe  ensured.  A  procurement  expert  will  be  hired  though  advance  action \nand retroactively financed. PAG will support MOLME in procurement. \nBids  will  be  published  in  national  newspapers  of  wide  circulation.  Bid \ndocuments  for  national  competitive  bidding  will  be  translated  into  the \n\n                                                \n27 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nRisks \ncontracts for rehabilitation \n\nMitigating Measures \nlocal  language,  and  pre-bid  meetings  will  be  arranged  with  interested \nbidders \nQualified,  experienced  financial  management  experts  will  be  hired. \nTraining  programs  on  project  financial  management  will  be  provided  to \nMOLME staff.
