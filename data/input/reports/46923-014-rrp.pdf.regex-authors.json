I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nguarantee facility of up to $35,000,000 (or Pakistan rupee equivalent) for eligible financial \ninstitutions for the Rural Financial Inclusion and Dairy Growth Facility in Pakistan.1 \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n2.  After nearly a decade of strong growth, Pakistan\u2019s economy has slowed significantly \nsince 2008. The private investment climate is challenging, characterized by rapid inflation, weak \nfiscal discipline and public sector governance, and an unresolved energy crisis. Despite a \nmodern regulatory banking system, Pakistan\u2019s financial intermediation trails its regional peers. \nCommercial bank credit was only 20% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012, down from \n29% in 2008. High fiscal deficits undermine private access to funding at affordable costs. \nFinancial inclusion remains low: only 3% of the adult population has loan accounts and 28% has \ndeposit accounts.2 Poverty remains widespread. The World Bank estimated that 60% of the \npopulation earned less than $2 per day in 2008. The government\u2019s poverty head count ratio is \n27% in rural areas and 13% in urban areas.3  \n3.  In  this  challenging  investment  climate,  Pakistan\u2019s  large  private  banks  have  shown \nresilience. Their asset quality, profitability, and solvency have remained substantially better than \ntheir smaller and public sector peers. The banking system continues to have ample liquidity \nrepresenting 49% of total bank assets.4 In addition, strong domestic demand and continued \naccess to funding have helped large listed companies remain resilient. \n4.  Pakistan\u2019s  rural  economy  contributes  substantially  to  employment  (45%)5 and  GDP \n(20%).6 However, only 5% of bank loans are to the agriculture sector, and half of those are \nprovided by public sector banks at subsidized rates (footnote 3). Access to public sector bank \nloans is limited and often based on relationships rather than farmers\u2019 creditworthiness. Among \nthe constraints on lending to farmers are the banks\u2019 difficulty in monitoring remote farms, high \nfarm risks and farmers\u2019 inability to provide requisite documentation. The State Bank of Pakistan \n(SBP) and commercial banks recognize that more inclusive ways are needed to link farmers to \nmarkets, increase their productivity, and transform them into creditworthy partners. \n5.  Pakistan is one of the five largest milk producers in the world, generating 38 billion liters \nannually.7 It has more than 8 million dairy-producing households, representing 35 million people. \nDairy production is estimated to currently grow at 2%\u20134% annually, and accounted for 12% of \nGDP and 55% of agricultural GDP in 2012. Only 54% of produced milk is tradable, 93% of \nwhich is provided to the consumers as loose milk. While packaged dairy products still constitute \na small market segment at 1.4 billion liters annually (or 7% of tradable milk), the demand is \ngrowing 10%\u201315% per year\u2014outpacing annual production growth. This indicates a growing \nsupply shortage and the need to source more milk from small farmers. The binding constraints \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  International Monetary Fund.

The estimates should be interpreted with caution since unrecorded \nvolumes are high, and a large part of the milk being consumed by farmers and wastage is known to be substantial.   \n ", "2   \nfacing the dairy sector are discussed in paras. 6\u20139.   \n6.  Small  farm  size.  Farms  with  less  than  10  cattle  provide  80%  of  the  milk  supply, \nrepresenting 92% of the dairy stock. However, the low yielding dairy stock and the small farm \nsize limits the production of animal feed and the farms\u2019 overall dairy yield. Average yields at less \nthan 4 liters per cattle per day are low compared with local commercial farms, which normally \nexceed 15 liters per cattle. In addition, losses from inadequate cooling facilities exceed 25% of \nproduction. There are only a few medium-sized and large farms with more than 100 cattle. \nThese require long periods to reach profitability and represent less than 10% of the market \nproduction.     \n7.  Low quality and capital availability. Intermediaries dominate the supply chain and \noften contaminate milk through mishandling. Milk is largely sold unpackaged, compromising \nconsumer health. Most farmers lack even minimal management skills and investment capital.  \n8.  Investment identification.  Since September 2011, ADB has explored opportunities to \npromote rural financial inclusion in Pakistan through an inclusive business approach by linking \nfarmers to agribusiness companies and banks to achieve high business and social impact. \nConsultations  with  the  government,  development  partners,  private  commercial  banks,  and \nagribusiness companies identified the dairy value chain as a promising entry point. Providing \nprivate investment capital to promote the use of locally adapted, higher-yielding dairy cattle \nwould enhance private, government, and development partner efforts to improve rural incomes, \nand farm management. \n9.  The consultation process resulted in an inclusive business design of the facility that aims \nto provide dairy farmers access to investment capital to increase farm yields and dairy outputs, \nreduce losses, and improve the quality of milk. The proposed approach entails collaboration and \nrisk sharing between participating dairy companies (PDCs) that source milk from farmers and \nparticipating commercial banks (PCBs) that provide loans to farmers in Pakistan. Because of \nthe  untested  nature  of  the  approach  and  farm  risk,  the  Department  for  International \nDevelopment of the United Kingdom (DFID) and SBP have agreed to provide a 20% first-loss \nguarantee from their existing Financial Inclusion Program.8 In exchange for being able to select \nfarmers and benefit from increasing milk sales, PDCs will have to participate significantly in the \ncredit risk to ensure good management and assistance of their veterinary services to farmers. \nTo ensure scalability, ADB has discussed the inclusive business approach with a number of \nbanks, including Habib Bank Limited (HBL), and dairy market leaders, including Engro Foods \nLimited (EFL). After 2 years ADB reached an agreement with HBL, EFL, SBP, and DFID on the \nterms of the untested inclusive business approach.  \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n10.  To reduce production losses and meet the increasing domestic demand, dairy producers \nwill move their direct milk sourcing network closer to the farmers and  increase their farm \nveterinary services to help improve farm management. HBL has been identified as the first PCB \nand EFL as the first PDC that meet the eligibility criteria under the facility. Subject to Board \napproval, ADB will identify other PCBs and PDCs in a manner set forth in para 26. \n11.  Established in 1941, HBL is Pakistan\u2019s largest bank with assets of PRs1,518 billion \n($14.4 billion) and market shares of 11% of loans and 15% of deposits at the end of FY2012. It \n                                                 \n8  SBP will be the guarantor of record, with funding provided by DFID. The program includes a nationwide guarantee \nfacility  to  support  access  of  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  and  farmers  to  bank  finance. \nhttp://projects.dfid.gov.uk/project.aspx?Project=113331  ", "        3 \nhas 1,497 branches, representing about 15% of Pakistan\u2019s bank branch network. With PRs18 \nbillion ($170 million) HBL is the largest private lender to agriculture. The facility will provide \nfinance to farmers who would not normally qualify as borrowers under HBL\u2019s existing lending \ncriteria. Linking HBL\u2019s widespread branch network and credit underwriting experience in rural \nareas with the strengths of EFL provides an untapped opportunity for inclusive business. \n12.  EFL\u2019s assets have grown quickly, reaching PRs22.2 billion ($209 million) at the end of \nFY2012. EFL improved its long-term debt-to-equity ratio from 47.5% at the end of FY2010 to \n37.5% at the end of FY2012. EFL\u2019s liquidity remained healthy as the current ratio improved from \n1.5 at the end of FY2010 to 2.1 at the end of FY2012. Net after tax income increased more than \nfourteen-fold since 2010 to PRs2.6 billion ($25 million), driven by strong revenue growth, which \nreached PRs40 billion ($378 million) in FY2012. Profitability improved consistently in FY2012, \nwith return on equity reaching 25.8%, compared with 3.4% in 2010. In 2012, EFL received the \nGroup  of  Twenty  international inclusive  business  award for  successful  integration  of  small \nfarmers in its business model. \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n1.  Habib Bank Limited  \n13.  Ownership. Privatized in 2004, HBL is owned by the Aga Khan Fund for Economic \nDevelopment (51%); SBP, representing the government (41.5%); and the public (7.5%) through \nits listing on Pakistan\u2019s stock exchanges. \n \n14.  Management. Nauman K. Dar, the chief executive officer (CEO) is supported by senior \nmanagers in retail, corporate, and Islamic banking, as well as treasury, financial control, risk \nmanagement,  strategic  planning,  human  resources,  legal,  operations,  and  information \ntechnology. Management is supported by senior staff through dedicated departments for asset\u2013\nliability management, risk management, credit policy, and operational risk management. HBL \nhas an independent risk management department covering credit, portfolio, market, and liquidity \nrisks. It reports to the board\u2019s risk management committee.  \n \n15.  Governance  structure.  HBL  is  a  Public  listed  company  with  a  strong  governance \nstructure  with  an  8  member  Board  representing  the  shareholders  and  with  independent \nDirectors as required by Law.  The board has 3 sub committees, Audit, Human Resource & \nRemuneration  and  the  Risk  Management  Committee,  each  of  which  is  chaired  by  a  non \nexecutive Director.  \n \n16.  HBL has an independent audit department whose chief reports to the board\u2019s audit \ncommittee.  HBL  has  adequate  anti-money-laundering  systems  in  compliance  with  local \nregulations. Transactions are monitored using specialized software. An anti-money-laundering \nofficer reports to the chief compliance officer. The compliance unit reports transactions to SBP.  \n2.  Engro Foods Limited \n17.  Ownership. Established in 2006, EFL is a 90% owned subsidiary of Engro Holdings \nCorporation Limited. It is a diversified conglomerate with operations in food and beverage, \nfertilizer, energy, trading, chemicals, storage, and engineering. Fourty-eight percent of its shares \nare held by prominent institutional and high net worth investors with the remaining shares being \ntraded  on  Pakistan\u2019s  stock  exchanges.  Like  its  parent,  EFL  is  subject  to  the  exchange\u2019s \ndisclosure and corporate governance regulations under the supervision of the Securities and \nExchange Commission.  ", "4   \n18.  Management.  CEO  Sarfaraz  Rehman  led  EFL  from  its  foundation  in  2006  until \nSeptember 2011 and again since July 2013. He is an experienced industry manager in Pakistan \nand was vital in building EFL. He is assisted by a 10-member management committee of \nexperienced managers who lead business units for sales, marketing, and dairy supply chain, as \nwell as support units including finance, human resources and administration, legal, and audit. \n19.  Governance structure. EFL has a 10-member board, including the CEO representing \nexperienced professionals from finance, marketing, and operations. As a listed company, EFL \nalso has an independent non- executive director who chairs the board\u2019s audit and finance \ncommittees.  \nD.  Financial Performance \n20.  Capital adequacy. With a total capital adequacy ratio of 15.1% and a tier 1 capital ratio \nof 12.9%, HBL\u2019s capital adequacy exceeded SBP\u2019s regulatory minimum of 10% in FY2012. HBL \nis  moving  towards  an  internal  ratings-based  approach  for  credit  and  market  risks,  and  is \nadopting an advanced measure for the operational risk capital charge. These reforms toward an \nintegration of capital and risk management and strategic planning will improve automation and \nstreamline business processes, and modify HBL\u2019s capital charge in FY2014.   \n    \n21.  Asset quality. HBL\u2019s asset quality is satisfactory and has substantially improved since \n2009. It is above the sector average of 14.5% in Pakistan, where loans are rarely written off and \nnonperforming loan statistics carry substantial fully provisioned loss loans. While the overall \nnonperforming loan ratio (including losses) was reported at 10.1% in FY2012 , the net of loss \nnonperforming  loan  ratio  was  reported  at  2.6%  in  FY  2012,  reflecting  HBL\u2019s  prudent \nunderwriting. HBL increased its exposure to the government and its entities through loans and \ntreasury bills to 74% of its exposures at the end of FY2012 compared with 55% at the end of \nFY2009.   \n22.  Earnings. For FY2012, net income reached PRs21.6 billion with a slight drop in the \nreturn on equity to19.3% and return on assets to 1.7% as result of asset growth of 42.7% during \nFY2012. Net income grew at a compound annual growth rate of 20.6% from 2009 to 2012, \nprimarily because of robust asset growth at a compound annual growth rate of 22.7%. During \nFY2012, HBL\u2019s net interest margin dropped by about 150 basis points to 5.1% because of SBP \ninterest rate reductions and higher deposit funding costs. HBL\u2019s profitability is strong compared \nwith local peers and stable with 83% of its business funded by low-cost deposits and an 18.1% \nshare of non-interest income to operating income.  \n \n23.  Liquidity and sensitivity to market risk. In FY2012, HBL\u2019s deposit growth was 30% \noutpacing the industry average of 11%. More than half of the deposits are raised at low-cost \nfrom individuals, who tend to be less price-sensitive. Long-term assets are well covered as \nindicated by a net stable funding ratio consistently exceeding 115% since FY2009 and reaching \n140% in FY2012. HBL\u2019s liquidity coverage ratio has consistently exceeded 150% since 2010.  \nE.  Unique Features \n24.  The facility involves an inclusive business approach in blending funding, skills, and \noutreach of PCBs, PDCs, and development partners to offer unbanked dairy farmers access to \naffordable credit. PDCs\u2019 ability to select suitable farmers and investments, and monitor farm \nmanagement jointly with PCBs\u2019 underwriting and risk management skills, is far superior to \ntraditional PCB lending. In addition, the first-loss risk cover (an essential feature of the facility) \nwill alleviate high first-mover risks when developing this market segment. Also, the PDCs\u2019 risk ", "        5 \nparticipation is essential to ensure its careful selection monitoring of, and advisory to farmers \nand their investments, and thereby identify and address risks early on. In this scalable model, \nADB and the PCB can leverage an inclusive business model at limited risk.  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \nTransaction Structure \n  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, KPI = key performance indicator, IT = information technology, PCB \n= participating commercial bank, PCG = partial credit guarantee, PDC = participating dairy company, \nPRe = Pakistan rupee, SBP = State Bank of Pakistan. \nSource: ADB. \n \n25.  The structure of the ADB assistance is illustrated in the figure. It entails a PCG facility of \nup to $35 million (or Pakistan rupee equivalent) in support of investment loans made to dairy \nfarmers in Pakistan. Under the facility, PCGs in favor PCBs may be entered into by ADB up to 4 \nyears after Board approval. Such PCGs will cover loans made by PCBs with a tenor of up to 5 \nyears that can be disbursed within 5 years from the signing of such PCG. The size of the facility \nis  adequate,  taking  into  account  the  rapidly  increasing  market  demand  and  the  positive \nresponses from possible PCBs and PDCs. DFID expressed interest to guarantee the first loss \nunder the facility. \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n26.  Under the facility, ADB will select PCBs and PDCs that will benefit from ADB\u2019s PCGs, \nsubject to the eligibility criteria set out in the implementation arrangements, and standard due \ndiligence procedures of ADB\u2019s private sector operations. Subject to approval by the Board of the ", "6   \nfacility, ADB\u2019s Investment Committee will be authorized to review and approve each PCB, PDC, \nand the amount and structure of each PCG under the facility. To reduce ADB\u2019s credit risk, other \nparties  will  take  junior  positions  under  guarantee  structures,  before  ADB\u2019s  PCG  will  be \ntriggered.9 ADB will only incur losses under its PCGs after the other guarantors have assumed \ntheir losses. For each PCG, ADB will require a PDC to assume either a first-loss or second-loss \nposition but in any event a position under which it bears the risk of loss either in priority to, or \nranking equally with ADB. ADB will also require the PCB to retain a significant portion of the \noverall risk of loss under each guarantee structure. \n27.  A first PCG under the facility has been targeted and is currently under negotiation. The \nprincipal  amount  guaranteed  under  this  PCG  will  be  up  to  $3  million  (or  Pakistan  rupee \nequivalent) and cover 35% of the outstanding principal in a portfolio of loans to be made by HBL \nto eligible dairy farmers selected by EFL and HBL. The loans will fund the purchase of cows and \nassociated capital expenses such as sheds and animal feed. EFL will select farmers and assist \nthem in selecting healthy dairy cows. EFL will purchase the produced milk and the proceeds will \nbe used to service the farmers\u2019 loans directly from the milk sales. SBP as a guarantor of record \nfor DFID will issue a first-loss guarantee of 20% of the loan pool. EFL will issue a second-loss \nguarantee of 10% of the loan pool. ADB will guarantee 50% of the losses that exceed the first \nand second loss threshold. The remaining risk will be retained by HBL.   \n28.  The individual PCGs and their structures (including first loss requirements, tenors, fee \nrates, and security arrangements) under the facility, including the first PCG referred to above, \nwill be tailored to the circumstances and needs of each PCB and PDC, and will take into \naccount the experience with earlier similar transactions.  \n29.  HBL, EFL, and other participating banks and companies will be required to provide \nannual  audited  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  applicable  financial  reporting \nstandards.10 They will also provide quarterly progress reports and financial statements of the \nguaranteed  loan  pools.  Reporting  requirements  include  (i)  status  updates  on  governance, \nsafeguards, and annual reports of the PCB\u2019s facility environmental and social management \nsystem (ESMS); (ii) updates on the PCBs\u2019 business and loan pool performance, and utilization \nof the ADB PCG limit; and (iii) development effectiveness. ADB will field review missions at least \nannually and discuss progress with the PCBs, PDCs, SBP, and DFID or other guarantors. \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n30.   Strengthening agriculture through an innovative, inclusive business model. ADB \nplays a vital role in providing a viable and scalable inclusive business model to farmers that \nbenefits from the collaboration and risk sharing of PDCs and PCBs. The business model\u2019s key \nfeatures include  (i)  PDCs\u2019  market  knowledge  and  ability to  source quality  milk  from  small \nfarmers;  (ii)  PDCs\u2019  ability to  identify farmers and investments  to  increase  farm  yields  and \nincome; (iii) PDCs\u2019 veterinary services to advise farmers in animal and farm management; (iv) \ncommercial risk capital leveraged through risk shared by development partners, PDCs, and \nPCGs;  (v)  investment  and  credit  cash  flows  controlled  from  abuse  by  limiting  direct  cash \npayments to farmers; (vi) alignment of PCB, PDC, and farmer interests in boosting sales, \nincome, and creditworthiness; (vii) improvement of financial and farm management literacy \nthrough monitoring and field advice; and (viii) improvement in the understanding of farmer risk \nprofiles through a staged learning-by-doing process.  \n                                                 \n9 A first-loss guarantee may be issued by a third party in combination with a second-loss guarantee issued by another \nparty. This may include SBP as a guarantor of record for DFID or DFID directly. \n10 Commercial banks and listed companies in Pakistan are required to publish annual audited accounts in accordance \nwith international financial reporting standards.  ", "        7 \n31.    Catalyzing sustainable private funding at affordable rates. The risk participation will \noffer PDCs incentives to select farmers carefully. Banks currently do not lend to small farmers, \nwhile microfinance and money lenders charge annual effective interest rates of more than 30%. \nThe risk participation will enable financial institutions to provide affordable borrowing and/or \nlending rates to the farmers. The need for first-loss cover funded by development partners is \nexpected to diminish gradually once the track record for this product is established and widely \naccepted by PCBs and PDCs.    \n32.   Enhancing corporate governance and risk management. Through on-site monitoring \nand dialogue, ADB will support the adherence of PCBs and PDCs to high corporate governance \nand social, environmental, and fiduciary standards. It will also enhance risk management. \nD.  Risks  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n33.      Impact. The facility will contribute to (i) the growth of small, high-value-added dairy \nproducts in Pakistan; (ii) the scaling up of commercial banking services for small dairy farmers; \nand (iii) improvements in dairy farmers\u2019 access to investment capital. \n34.  Outcome. The facility will provide a scalable commercial model for providing credit to \nsmall farmers. Once successfully tested, this model will provide for sustainable credit outreach \nto  small  farmers,  substantial  revenue  through higher-yielding  cows, and  increased  farmer \nproductivity.  \n35.  Outputs. The outputs include (i) increased access of small dairy farmers to finance, (ii) \nthe establishment of a sustainable farmer credit program, and (iii) improved farm management.  \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n36.  Under Strategy 2020, ADB aims to strengthen its support for the finance sector by \nassisting in the development of financial infrastructure, institutions, and products and services, \nas well as by promoting inclusive growth.11 Through such initiatives, ADB will encourage the \nchanneling of savings into productive investments. The building of inclusive financial systems \nwill be supported by the facility funding agriculture where productivity is low and the potential for \nemployment and income generation is high. The facility will help establish an inclusive business \nmodel for commercial banks to reach dairy farmers who do not have access to affordable \ncommercial  funding,  consistent  with  efforts  by  the  government,  SBP,  DFID  to  promote \nagricultural  growth.  Strategy  2020\u2019s  target  for  poverty  reduction  through  private  sector \ndevelopment will be directly addressed by linking small farmers and their families to markets, \nand providing them access to credit and productive assets. Consistent with Strategy 2020, the \nfacility will demonstrate an inclusive business approach and leverage a partnership with the \nexisting Financial Inclusion Program of SBP and DFID.  \n37.  The  facility  supports  the  development  objectives  of  the  government,  which  include \nfinance for development. The country partnership strategy for Pakistan, 2009\u20132013 emphasizes \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2008.

", "8   \nthe need for reforms, including measures to improve productivity in agriculture and promote the \nprivate sector. 12 ADB\u2019s consultations with stakeholders highlight the importance of the private \nand financial sector, as well as the need to improve financial inclusion, especially in rural areas. \nMore commercial financial services will capture essential qualitative inclusive business growth \nopportunities and encourage sound risk management. Capital support through the partnership \nof  banks  and  agribusiness  present  a  strong  inclusive  business  transaction  through  ADB\u2019s \nprivate sector operations.  \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n38.  The facility is consistent with ADB\u2019s financial sector operational plan and the 2007 report \nof the working group on rural poverty, which emphasizes the importance of rural finance and \npromotes financial inclusion of underserved poor households and farmers.13  \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n39.  The facility is classified as category FI under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \nOn  social  safeguards,  the  facility  is  category  FI  treated  as  C  for  impacts  on  involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous peoples.  Sub-loans classified as environment category A and \nsocial safeguard categories A and B will not be financed under the facility.  \n40.  The sub-loans to be guaranteed by the first PCG will finance the acquisition of cows and \nassociated capital expenses targeting small farmers in Punjab province. The sites are irrigated \nagricultural land far from notified protected ecosystems. The implementation of the PCG is \nexpected to have minimal to moderate environmental impacts. Potential impacts on land, soil, \nwater, air quality, and biodiversity are derived from (i) solid wastes from waste feed, animal \nwaste, carcasses, and other hazardous wastes; (ii) wastewater from runoff from feed storage; \n(iii) ammonia and odors from manure, and dust from overgrazed pastureland; (iv) environmental \ndamage  of  soil  and  water  resources  because  of  cattle  access;  and  (v)  spread  of  animal \ndiseases.  \n41.  For the first PCG, HBL and EFL have management systems in place and are committed \nto meeting ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements. The ESMS established by HBL in collaboration with \nEFL, with the agreed-upon modifications requested by ADB, is considered adequate to comply \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. EFL and HBL will ensure that investments using the \nPCG do not involve business activities on ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list. Under the \nfirst PCG, HBL will provide only sub-loans to be guaranteed by ADB classified as environment C \nuntil HBL\u2019s existing ESMS is enhanced to ADB\u2019s satisfaction. That will be triggered by the \ncompletion of measures addressing environmental impacts of sub-loans classified as category \nB. The ESMS provides for HBL compliance with applicable national safeguard requirements on \nenvironment, health, and safety; and safeguard requirements including labor laws in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy.14 \n42.  ADB has made significant efforts during its due diligence to assess HBL\u2019s and EFL\u2019s \ncommitment and capacity for promoting gender equity, and to ensure that gender inclusiveness \nis an integral feature of this transaction. EFL targets females as an important beneficiary group \nin its dairy advisory services. EFL is engaging female trainers to target female members of farm \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: Pakistan, 2009\u20132013.

The first PCG will directly benefit female \nhousehold members of 280 families. EFL has established a team to advise and monitor the \nbenefits these families over a 3-year period and has taken proactive steps to promote a gender-\ninclusive ethos, which is likely to generate significant benefits for female household members. \nThis transaction is classified some gender elements under ADB\u2019s guidelines.15   \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n43.  HBL has Anti Fraud Policy and Code of Ethics in place and has been advised, and all \nfuture PCBs will be advised, of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \nC.  Investment Limitations \n44.  The facility is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single investment \nexposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \nD.  Assurances \n45.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank 16  the \nGovernment of Pakistan will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nassistance  to  the  facility.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  finance  documentation,  in  form  and \nsubstance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board. \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n46.
