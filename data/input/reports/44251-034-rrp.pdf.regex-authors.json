THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based loan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for subprogram 2 of the Financial Sector \nDeepening Program.1 \n \n2.  The Socio-Economic Development Strategy (SEDS), 2011\u20132020 is designed to help Viet \nNam transition into a modern, productive, and equitable market-based economy. In particular, \nthe government seeks to increase the role of the nonbank finance sector and deepen the \nfinancial markets in Viet Nam to sustain the financing of productive investment. Subprogram 2 \ncontinues and deepens the reforms begun under subprogram 1. It will support the development \nof a well-functioning money market and a deeper and more liquid capital market, and improve \nthe capacity of public and private institutions in the finance sector.2 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The development problem. The government aspires to reach middle-income country \nstatus, with a per capita income of at least $3,000 and significant improvements in human \ndevelopment  and  poverty  reduction  by  2020.  However,  this  goal  is  being  challenged  as \nstructural factors impede higher economic growth\u2014the average annual growth rate fell from \n7.8% during 2004\u20132007 to 5.6% in 2010\u20132014\u2014 over the medium to long term. In particular, \nthe finance sector is shallow and does not support the efficient intermediation of funds into \nproductive investments. As the figure on the following page shows, Viet Nam\u2019s finance sector is \ndominated  by  bank  credit  much  more  than  those  of  its  regional  peers  Indonesia  and  the \nPhilippines, which is partly explained by state-owned commercial banks\u2019 lending to state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs). The nonbank finance sector, which represents an alternative source of \nintermediation of corporate credit needs, remains in a nascent state of development. The money \nmarket and government bond market, fundamental building blocks of a capital market, are \nunderdeveloped. 3 The corporate bond market and the equities market are also among the \nsmallest and least developed in Southeast Asia, suggesting a capital market that cannot fully \nsupport  Viet  Nam\u2019s  longer-term  economic  growth  and  development.  Further,  the  finance \nsector\u2019s  nascent  state  of  development  means  that  policy  levers  necessary  to  maintain \nmacroeconomic stability are also limited generally to administrative measures and fiscal policy. \n \n4.  Development constraints. The government has recognized these challenges and has \nidentified a set of key problems that must be overcome to ensure the financial sector can \nprovide increasing levels of intermediation. These key problems are: (i) a small and illiquid \nmoney market, (ii) heightened systemic risk and a shallow bond market, and (iii) inadequate \nfinancial infrastructure and capacity.  \n \n5.  The money market is small, exhibits limited activity, and is defined by instruments with \nvery short tenors. Heightened credit risk in the banking sector and a lack of transparency has \n                                                \n1  The  programmatic  approach  and  subprogram  1  was  approved  in  2013.  See:  ADB.  2013.  Report  and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors for the Programmatic Approach and Policy-Based \nLoan (Subprogram 1) to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Financial Sector Deepening Program. Manila. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  A well-functioning money market enables (i) financial institutions to match short-term assets and liabilities, \n(ii) security dealers to finance their inventories and to maintain two-way markets, (iii) corporations to manage \nworking capital needs, (iv) the central bank to conduct more effective monetary policy, and (v) the market to price \nfinancial instruments based on short-term benchmark rates. ", "2 \nalso fragmented the market. This situation has been exacerbated by a lack of standardized \nagreements, such as repurchase agreements, which serve to reduce risks. While recent reforms \nhave increased the volume of interbank lending, more needs to be done to build coordination \nacross stakeholders, including the government, to ensure that reliable, market-driven, short-\nterm benchmark interest rates are established and maintained.  \n \n \nLCY = local currency \nSource: AsianBondsOnline \n   \n \n6.  The banking sector is weak. The government recognizes that the banking sector\u2019s high \nlevels of nonperforming loans (NPLs) and undercapitalization serve as a fundamental drag on \ncapital market development and limit credit availability. The most recent International Monetary \nFund Article 4 Consultation, dated October 2014, estimated aggregate NPLs in the banking \nindustry  at just  over  4%  of  total  loans.4 However,  private  sector  sources  routinely  publish \nestimates that are much higher.5 To date, reform of the banking sector has been constrained by \nits poor risk controls, weak identification of problem assets, an inability to dispose of problem \nassets in a robust and timely manner, and weaknesses in the regulatory regime to resolve \nproblem banks. \n \n7.  The capital market is shallow and illiquid. As of 31 December 2014, the local currency \nbond market amounted to only 22% of gross domestic product (GDP), well below the overall \naverage of 57.8% for emerging East Asia. The corporate bond market remains dormant. The \ngovernment bond market typically provides a market-determined term structure of interest rates \nalong a variety of maturity points, forming a yield curve. This term structure, or yield curve, is an \nessential building block without which a corporate, derivative, and structured finance market \ncould not develop. In Viet Nam, the government bond market is concentrated in short-term \nmaturities of less than 3 years, and exhibits limited liquidity. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) has \nstrengthened the regulatory environment and extended tenors. However, more needs to be \ndone to ensure that primary auctions of government bonds are preannounced and predictable. \nTrading  volume must  be  increased  by  concentrating the government\u2019s  bond  issues  into  a \nbroader  but  limited  set  of  standardized  maturities  which  include  longer-term  tenors. \nFragmentation must be reduced and price transparency must be improved. \n \n8.  Parallel  reforms  will  be  necessary  to  ensure  supporting  financial  infrastructure  is \nconducive to market development. Upgrades to the government securities settlement system, \nwhich is currently dependent on a commercial bank, will reduce settlement risk and increase \nmarket confidence. The adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards will improve \n                                                \n4  Figures provided by the State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV). \n5  In 2013, Fitch Ratings estimated system aggregate NPLs at 15% of total loans, with an 80% loss rate that would \nreduce system aggregate tier 1 capital to 1% from the 10% reported by the SBV. ", "3 \ntransparency,  increase  confidence  and  provide  much-needed  incentives  to  strengthen  risk \nmanagement. In addition, a stronger commitment to capacity development will make sure that \nregulatory surveillance and oversight remain capable as the market matures. \n \n9.  The  government\u2019s  reform  agenda. To restore higher economic growth and tackle \nlonger-term macroeconomic challenges to stability, the government recognizes that it needs to \npursue reforms to allocate its high national savings\u201431.2% of GDP in 2014\u2014more efficiently \nand effectively toward productive investment. The recent Financial Sector Assessment Program \nhas  sharpened  the  government\u2019s  resolve  to  increase  financial  stability  as  a  necessary \nprecondition for capital market development.6 Efforts to reduce the large overhang of NPLs and \nto strengthen the banking system have gained momentum. As of the end of 2014, the Viet Nam \nAsset Management Company (VAMC) had purchased D123 trillion of NPLs from the banking \nsubsector, although it\u2019s limited powers have resulted in minimal disposals. The government has \naccelerated the  implementation  of  reforms  under  SEDS  and  initiated SOE  restructuring  to \nreduce the dominance of inefficient state production and to enhance economic growth. Within \nthis framework, the government remains committed to finance sector development since it \nrepresents a key aspect of the reform agenda under the SEDS.7 The equity and corporate bond \nmarkets represent essential sources of financing for recapitalizing the banking system, and for \nequitized  SOEs.  Market-sourced  funding  also  provides  much-needed  discipline,  which \nencourages  competition,  efficiency,  and  governance.  Finally,  reforms  in  these  areas  will \nstrengthen the economy\u2019s resilience to shocks by mitigating risks posed by an overreliance on \nthe bank-dominated finance sector, strengthening the implementation of monetary policy, and \nimproving the overall allocation of resources within the economy. \n \n10.  Asian Development Bank\u2019s contribution and lessons learned. In recognition of these \ninterrelationships,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  continuing  and  strengthening  its \n\u201cwhole of sector approach,\u201d which encompasses SOE reform, finance sector development, and \nan increase in the availability of credit. The second periodic financing request under the State-\nOwned Enterprises Reform and Corporate Governance Facilitation Program was approved on \n16  December  2014.8 This  request  provided  funding  support  to  three  SOEs\u2014Construction \nCorporation No. 1 Company Limited, Song Da Corporation, and Vietnam National Textile and \nGarment  Corporation\u2014to  implement  a  comprehensive  package  of  corporate  and  financial \nreforms.  This  initiative  built  on  an  earlier  ADB  engagement  that  developed  an  enabling \nenvironment,  including  the  creation  of  a  centralized  government  institution  to  formulate, \ncoordinate, and lead the implementation of SOE reform. In addition, ADB has provided support \nto financial inclusion through subprogram 2 of the Microfinance Development Program approved \nby the ADB Board of Directors in December 2014.9  \n \n11.  Broader finance sector development serves to boost the catalytic role that markets play \nin  economic  development.  ADB  has  provided  various  finance  sector  program  loans  and \ntechnical assistance (TA) support since 1996, which helped Viet Nam as it transitions to a \nmarket-based financial system.10 Initial efforts introduced the basic concepts and systems for \nbanking, including a legal framework, negotiable instruments, and secured transactions.

Manila. \n10 ADB\u2019s Sector Program and Experience (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4 \nADB  supported  the  introduction  of  competition  to  the  banking  industry  and  initiated  the \ndevelopment of the nonbanking sector to increase market-based financial intermediation. The \nnext stage focused on delivering four main outputs: increasing market liquidity and lowering \ntransaction costs, establishing a public debt management office, strengthening investor and \nconsumer  protection,  and  operationalizing  the  country\u2019s  Anti-Money-Laundering  Information \nCenter. These efforts were coordinated with and bolstered by other regional initiatives, such as \nthe Asian Bond Market Development Initiative and the Asian Capital Markets Forum.11 \n \n12.  These engagements provided useful lessons that were incorporated into the design of \nthe program.12 First, finance sector development is recognized as hierarchical and requires \ncareful sequencing over a medium- to long-term gestation period. Key foundation reforms must \nbe successfully implemented before moving on to more complex reforms. Also, ADB and the \ngovernment  now  emphasize  the  achievement  of  mutually  agreed  quantitative  performance \nindicators and tangible results. To ensure that tangible results are achieved, ADB and the \ngovernment  jointly  identify  and  design  policy  measures  that  directly  contribute  to  the \nachievement of performance indicators. Prior programmatic approaches tended to focus on the \nmere  completion  of  policy  actions  which  were  often  based  on  purely  administrative \naccomplishments.  \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s  value  added to  program  design  and  implementation.  Key policy reforms \nunder  subprogram  1 (footnote  1),  which  was  approved  on  6  December  2013,  include  the \nestablishment of formal coordination between the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) and MOF. This \ncoordination effort, e.g., the establishment of the Money Market Development Working Group \n(MMDWG), produced the money market development master plan and regulatory framework, \nwhich led to the emergence of a more robust money market under subprogram 2. In addition, \nMOF  finalized  the  bond  market  development  road  map,  a  key  pillar  of  the  program; \nstrengthened the legal framework governing the issuance and management of public debt; and \nincreased the transparency of public debt auctions. Also, the government began, for the first \ntime, to concentrate public debt into select, longer-tenor benchmark securities. MOF established \na road map to adopt the International Financial Reporting Standards and launched an effort to \nestablish a policyholder protection fund, both of which are being completed under subprogram 2. \nFinally, the government initiated a sustained effort to introduce corporate governance reforms \nby participation in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Corporate Governance \nscorecard, and established a comprehensive plan for capacity development. \n \n14.  The reforms implemented under subprogram 1 have produced tangible results. Viet \nNam\u2019s total local currency bonds outstanding grew 43.1% year-on-year to reach D866 trillion \n($38.0 billion) as of the end of December 2014. In fact, Viet Nam was the fastest-growing local \ncurrency bond market in emerging East Asia in the fourth quarter of 2014 (quarter-on-quarter \nand year-on-year). Policy reforms also galvanized the money market, where average quarterly \ninterbank lending turnover increased from the 2010 baseline of D1.2 trillion to D74.4 trillion in \n2014. Nonbank financing expanded as local currency bonds increased from 16% of GDP in \n2010 to 22% in 2014 (2015 target: 25%)13 while total outstanding government bonds held by the \ncontractual savings industry increased from 11% in 2010 to 14% in 2014 (2015 target: 16%). \nThe average maturity of the government securities portfolio was extended by the continuing \nissuance of longer tenors.14 The stock market exhibits similarly promising trends\u2014its combined \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance for Promoting an Interlinked ASEAN Capital Market. Manila (TA 7576-REG). \n12 ADB. 2014. Completion Report: Third Financial Sector Program in Viet Nam. Manila. \n13 This target was an indicator for program impact in subprogram 1. \n14 The number of auctions of 10- and 15-year government bonds has more than doubled since 2013; the aggregate \nface amount of 10-year notes rose from D8 billion to D33 billion, and 15-year notes from D4 billion to D15 billion. ", "5 \ncapitalization increased from 19% of GDP in 2010 to 30% as of 2014 (2015 target: 35%). \nOverall market liquidity also improved. Government bond turnover increased from less than 1.0x \nin 2010 to 2.5x in 2014, while the aggregate value traded across the Ha Noi Stock Exchange \n(HNX) and Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange increased from D180 trillion in 2010 to D732 trillion in \n2014 (2015 target: +25%). \n \n15.  ADB has also provided direct support to the completion of reforms under subprogram 2. \nAn ADB-funded resident advisor utilized surveys, research notes, and policy recommendations \nto develop the broad stakeholder consensus necessary to drive development of the money \nmarket. Building on this consensus, policy dialogue has led to greater coordination between \nstakeholders in the money market, which has further increased its depth and activity. ADB \nhelped the government identify reforms to the legal framework, which are needed to reduce \noperational risk in the money market, and supported the development of a plan to transfer the \ncash settlement leg of government securities transactions to the SBV. Responding to recent \nrequests, policy advice was provided to VAMC regarding disposal of problem assets, and ADB \nsupported MOF in further refining and implementing the bond market development road map. \nADB  is  supporting  ongoing  efforts  to  adopt  international  standards,  and  in  particular, \nInternational  Financial  Reporting  Standards.  Frequent  consultations  between  major  donors, \nincluding the Government of Canada and the World Bank, provide for consistency of advice and \na comprehensive reform program.15 \n \n16.  Policy-based loan and budget support. ADB will continue its programmatic support to \nincrease  the  role  of  the  nonbank  finance  sector  in  financing  productive  investment.  This \napproach  utilizes  policy-based  lending  in  conjunction  with  extensive  policy  dialogue  in \nrecognition of the long-term time horizon required for finance sector development and the need \nto sequence reforms. Subprogram 2 includes three primary outputs: (i) a well-functioning money \nmarket, (ii) a deeper and more liquid capital market, and (iii) capacity of public and private \ninstitutions  in  the  finance  sector  improved.  In  addition,  subprogram  2  contains  significant \nadditional reforms, not originally contemplated in subprogram 1, which build a sound foundation \nto begin reducing systemic risk levels as well as the large stock of NPLs in the banking sector. \nDemonstrating this long-term commitment to finance sector reforms, the government has also \nrequested from ADB follow-on programmatic support from 2017 to 2021, which will combine \nfinance sector development with financial inclusion. \n \n17.  Economic  impact. The program\u2019s expected economic impact includes cost savings \narising primarily from a reduction in the cost of the government\u2019s debt thanks to a drop in the \nrisk premium. Compliance with international standards, including Basel II (para. 25), will yield \nfurther benefits. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n18.  The program is aligned with the SEDS and will increase the role of the nonbank finance \nsector in financing economic activities by deepening the financial markets in Viet Nam. The \noutcome  remains  the  same\u2014strengthened  investor  confidence.  At  the  inception  of  the \nprogrammatic approach in 2013, the government agreed to 45 indicative policy actions as a \nbasis for subprogram 2. ADB confirmed that 38 of these indicative actions were accomplished.16  \nAt the request of the government, ADB agreed to sharpen the focus of subprogram 2, and future \nprograms, by concentrating on key reforms. Through this process, 33 indicative actions were \n                                                \n15 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Of the balance, four were deferred to align sequencing and are covered by the post program partnership \nframework, and three were dropped due to a lack or relevance, or because they were overtaken by other reforms.  \n ", "6 \ncombined  into  22  high-impact  policy  actions  and  three  new  policy  actions  were  added  to \nrecognize  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  strengthen  the  banking  sector  and  thereby  reduce \nsystemic  risks.  Subprogram  2  now  contains  25  reform  actions  (9 triggers  representing \nmandatory high impact reforms and 16 milestones), which the government completed between \nSeptember 2013 and June 2015.17 Four completed actions were dropped from the program as \nno follow up actions would be required, and one was dropped because a lack of data prevents \nadditional reforms.   \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n20.  Output 1: A well-functioning money market. The output builds on accomplishments \nunder subprogram 1 to develop a money market by strengthening coordination and promoting \ntrading activity. To implement increasing complex reforms, the SBV and MOF now participate in \na formal interministerial coordination group.18 In addition, the SBV has restructured the activities \nand responsibilities of the MMDWG to better align the mandates of the members and the \nobjectives of the MMDWG. The SBV encouraged greater activity  in the short-term money \nmarket through its liquidity management operations by regularly issuing SBV bills with tenors of \n28 days, 56 days, 91 days, and 182 days. This activity has provided provisional short-term \nbenchmark rates at 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, and 180 days. In addition, SBV encouraged \nincreased activity in the money market by strengthening bank prudential liquidity standards, as \nwell  as  expectations  of  risk  management  with  higher  penalties  for  noncompliance.19 As \nnormalized  liquidity  operations  resumed  in  the  banking  industry,  the  SBV  increased \ntransparency  by  introducing  real-time  trade  monitoring  and  post-trade  reporting  for  foreign \nexchange interbank transactions.20 Domestic interbank rates and volumes are now published on \nthe SBV\u2019s website, subject to a 3-day delay, and a working group was established to launch \nreal-time trade monitoring and reporting for domestic interbank transactions modeled on the \nReuters platform utilized for the foreign exchange interbank market. \n \n21.  Output 2: A deeper and more liquid capital market. Output 2 builds on efforts to \ndevelop  a  capital  market  by  introducing  new  measures  to  reduce  systemic  risk,  and  by \ncontinuing reforms to develop the bond market and improve oversight and transparency. In \nparticular, financial stability is a necessary precondition for capital market development (footnote \n5). A formal monitoring group was established to track and ensure the implementation of priority \nrecommendations arising from the recently completed Financial Sector Assessment Program, \nsuch as reducing systemic credit risk and resolving NPLs. To accelerate the resolution of NPLs, \nthe  government  increased  VAMC\u2019s  capital  to  $100  million  equivalent.  Utilizing  recently \nrequested  access  to  development  partners,  including  ADB,  the  government  established  a \nfoundation for NPL resolution by authorizing VAMC to issue its own debt to purchase NPLs at \nmarket value, and strengthened its NPL resolution powers to allow asset sales without the \nconsent of the borrower or originating bank. In parallel, the SBV increased capital in the banking \nsystem by progressively adopting the Basel II standards for large domestic banks. The SBV \nrequired implementation of the standardized approach by the end of 2015 and targeted adoption \nof the complex internal ratings-based foundation approach by the end of 2018. Concurrently, the \n                                                \n17 Reconciliation of the original Subprogram 2 to the revised Subprogram 2 (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n18 The wider coordination group will now provide a venue through which monetary policy can be better coordinated \nand short-term benchmarks can be set independently of the SBV\u2019s liquidity operations. \n19 These standards were modeled on Basel III. \n20 Participants use a standard trading platform for foreign exchange provided by Thomson Reuters Dealing. ", "7 \nSBV  improved  the  identification  of  NPLs,  and  implemented  an  enhanced  problem  bank \nresolution regime backed by the revised bankruptcy law.21 \n \n22.   Continuing  reforms  begun  in  subprogram  1,  the  government  introduced  a  basic \nframework to accelerate development of the bond market. To improve the operation of the \nprimary and secondary government debt market, MOF identified specific government bonds that \nwill serve as short-term and long-term benchmarks. Within this framework, MOF was able to \nreduce fragmentation\u2014the total number of government bond issues declined from 270 in 2010 \nto 117 as of the end of 2014\u2014and extend the average maturity of the government debt portfolio \nby continuing the regular issuance of 10- and 15-year tenors. The government developed a \nframework to launch a primary dealer system composed of \u201cbidding members\u201d, identified their \nbasic rights and obligations, and established an annual review and ranking of the participants. \nTo increase transparency and price discovery, HNX now publishes quarterly and annual debt \nauction schedules on its website, and utilizes indicative prices to build a government bond yield \ncurve. Complementary reforms were also enacted to strengthen the government\u2019s supervisory \npowers and increase transparency. To deepen international links and cooperation, the State \nSecurities Commission (SSC) became a signatory to the International Organization of Securities \nCommissions\u2019 Annex A. \n \n23.  Output  3:  Capacity  of  public  and  private  institutions  in  the  finance  sector \nimproved. Continuing from subprogram 1, the output strengthens financial market infrastructure \nand institutional capacity. MOF completed a draft Law on Accounting for presentation to the \nNational Assembly which will progressively align the Vietnamese Accounting Standards with \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards, including the concept of market or \u201cfair\u201d value.22 To \nreduce systemic risk in the securities settlement process, MOF\u2014through SSC, the Viet Nam \nSecurities Depository, and the SBV\u2014established a steering committee and working group that \nwill transfer the cash settlement leg of government bond transactions from a commercial bank to \nthe SBV and develop a limited-purpose central clearing counterparty to support the introduction \nof derivatives trading. In accordance with the Law on Insurance Business, MOF established, \nfunded,  and  staffed  a  policyholder  protection  fund  and  instituted  a  supporting  governance \nframework. Reforms to build the public equity markets and to increase trading volumes and \nefficiencies continue. SSC completed an action plan for merging HNX and Ho Chi Minh Stock \nExchange.23 MOF, through SSC, published corporate governance rankings of publicly listed \ncompanies by group, using the ASEAN Corporate Governance Scorecard, and completed a \ndraft plan to establish an institute of directors to advocate and support reforms to corporate \ngovernance. Finally, the government continued to strengthen the capacity of line institutions \nresponsible  for  finance  sector  development  and  supervision.  On  the  debt  side,  MOF  now \ncompletes independent assessments of Viet Nam\u2019s debt sustainability. The SBV implemented \nits human resource development (training) plan, through which 4,789 participants completed a \nstructured regime of soft skills, general professional skills, and select advanced technical skills. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n24.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  equivalent  to  $100,000,000  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Fund to help finance the program. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  of  2%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and \nthereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are set forth in the draft loan agreement. The \n                                                \n21 By 25 April 2014, the SBV has directly acquired two failed commercial banks at a price of D0 per share, effectively \nextinguishing shareholder rights. \n22 This law is expected to be approved by the General Assembly in late 2015 or early 2016. \n23 The plan has been submitted to MOF and the Prime Minister for review and approval. \n ", "8 \nloan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange cost (excluding local taxes and \nduties) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items \nand imports listed in the negative list attached to the loan agreement. The proceeds of the \npolicy-based loan will be disbursed in accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.24  \n \n25.   In 2015, the government will need to borrow D171 trillion to cover a budget deficit \ntargeted at 4.1% of GDP. In 2014, deficit financing was obtained from domestic sources (44%) \nand external sources (56%), of which some 84% was accounted for by official development \nassistance. Assuming a similar distribution, the government will borrow an estimated $3.8 billion \nthrough official development assistance to close the budget gap. The size of the loan primarily \nreflects the government financing needs, the strength of the reform program, and, secondarily, \nthe costs of implementation (para. 25).25 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n26. Subprogram 2 covers September 2013\u2013June 2015. The executing agency is the SBV; the \nimplementing  agencies  are  the  MOF,  SSC,  HNX,  and  SBV.  The  MMDWG  acts  as  a \ncoordination mechanism for the implementation of the money market development master plan. \nIn addition, subprogram 2 contains measures that serve to broaden coordination of capital \nmarket development between the SBV and the MOF, and across other government agencies. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n27.   A growing body of empirical research produces a remarkably consistent narrative\u2014the \nservices  provided  by  the  financial  system  exert  a  first-order  impact  on  long-run  economic \ngrowth.26 On a program-specific level, a program impact assessment was prepared to estimate \nthe potential benefits and costs of subprogram 2 using a cost\u2013benefit analysis framework.27 The \nnet benefits are expected to approximate $246 million. The benefits arise from economic gains \narising primarily from an assumed 20-basis-point reduction in the risk premium on Viet Nam\u2019s \ngovernment debt. The costs of subprogram 2 include costs to the Government of Viet Nam \nassociated with issuing debt of longer tenors ($3.2 million) and increasing the capital of the \nVAMC ($75 million). Costs also accrue to the private sector, such as those associated with \nadopting Basel II requirements and other reporting and information disclosure requirements \nstemming from the reforms. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n28.  The  government  undertook  and  finalized  the  first  Public  Expenditure  Financial \nAccountability assessment in July 2013. It confirmed that the government has a functioning \npublic financial management (PFM) system capable of efficiently collecting a substantial amount \nof  revenues  as  a  proportion  of  GDP.  Challenges  included  a  lack  of  alignment  between \ninvestment plans and budgets. The system of targeted transfers to local government units \n                                                \n24 ADB. 1998.

", "9 \nneeds to be reoriented from an input-driven approach to one driven by  performance, and \ncapacity is a persistent issue. Further, the government is pursuing a progressive agenda for \nreforms.28 ADB has supported these efforts since 2008 with initiatives to improve planning, \nstrengthen  PFM,  and  increase  legal  transparency  and  accessibility. 29 For  example,  the \ngovernment  adopted  several  legal  reforms,  including  the  Anti-Corruption  Law.  Under  the \nNational External Debt and Public Debt Strategy, 2011\u20132020, aggregate public debt information \nwas published for the first time.30 The National Assembly recently approved amendments to the \n2002 Budget Law to deepen the implementation of the medium-term expenditure framework \nand  performance-based  budgeting,  and  to  improve  budget  execution,  monitoring,  and \nimplementation. These revisions, expected to be ratified in 2015 and effective in 2017, will also \nenhance budget transparency and disclosure. ADB is preparing small-scale TA to assist the \ngovernment  in  implementing  components  of  the  new  budget  law.  Tax  management  and \ncustoms modernization reforms are under way, increasing the transparency of administrative \nprocedures  and  reducing  compliance  costs  for  taxpayers.  The  government\u2019s  SOE  reform \nprogram also helps improve PFM through its divestment and equitization program, which is \nbeing  supported  by  ADB.    ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained to the government and SBV. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n29.  Viet Nam has achieved remarkable progress in reducing poverty during 1993\u20132008: \nGDP per capita rose by an average 6.1% annually and poverty fell 2.9 percentage points each \nyear to below 10% by 2010.31 These reductions are largely attributable to sustained business-\nled  growth  in  output  and  employment,  complemented  by  targeted  poverty  reduction \ninterventions. According to the United Nations Development Programme, Viet Nam is likely to \nachieve most of its Millennium Development Goals by 2015. Recent upgrades to Viet Nam\u2019s \nmonitoring systems to incorporate current expenditure patterns allow for improved pro-poor \nspending programs in future. Returning Viet Nam to high and sustained economic growth, a \nprimary driver in poverty reduction, will require macroeconomic stability along with structural \nreforms, such as the restructuring of poorly performing SOEs, recapitalization and strengthening \nof the banking industry, and the development of a more efficient capital market. \n \n30.  Within the framework of the SEDS, the government has embarked on an ambitious goal \nof restructuring SOEs, reducing the large overhang of NPLs, and eliminating bottlenecks that \nimpede growth in the capital market. The Sector Road Map for the Strategic Development of the \nVietnamese Capital Market, which is part of the SEDS, serves as a master plan for long-term \ncapital market development. The program is aligned with the road map and aims to strengthen \nthe  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  frameworks  and  market  infrastructure  to  sustain  the \nfinancing  of  productive  investment.  The  government  has  requested  from  ADB  a  follow-on \nprogrammatic approach that combines finance sector development and financial inclusion to \nsupport greater coverage and usage of financial services by the poor.32 \n \n \n                                                \n28 Public Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 ADB. 2008.

Subprogram 2 will not entail any involuntary resettlement or negatively affect indigenous \npeople or the environment. It is classified C in all safeguards categories. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n32.  Subprogram 2 is exposed to high levels of broad national and macroeconomic risks, and \nrisks associated with PFM and corruption. High inflation and fiscal risk have their roots in \nstructural issues, while structural reform itself poses high fiscal risks. Risks arising from PFM \ninclude budget weaknesses and lack of an effective audit oversight. Procurement has been \nhampered  by  decentralization,  capacity  constraints,  and  conflicts  of  interest.  Anticorruption \nmechanisms are not yet fully effective. Recent improvements in macroeconomic performance \nserve  to  mitigate  macroeconomic  risks,  as  detailed  in  a  recent  macroeconomic  and  debt \nsustainability assessment.33 Otherwise, ADB is coordinating with other development partners to \nmitigate risks and is providing TA to improve PFM. ADB is also engaging the government \nthrough  anticorruption  dialogue  and  will  evaluate  support  for  the  Construction  Sector \nTransparency  Initiative  to  bolster  anticorruption  efforts.  Overall,  program-specific  risks  are \nmedium and include a possible decline in political will to implement technically difficult reforms, \nprotracted or inadequate efforts to advance SOE reform and bank recapitalization, and a lack of \nfunding for capacity development. However, the government\u2019s explicit resolve to implement key \nreforms recommended in the Financial Sector Assessment Program, as well as the policy goals \nof the SEDS, provide evidence of its increasing commitment to reform. Under an ongoing \nproject, ADB is supporting the government\u2019s priority efforts to reform SOEs, and to strengthen \nits problem bank and NPL resolution schemes. Active donor support and provisional plans by \nADB  to  fund  capacity  development  provide  additional  risk  mitigation.  Specific  risks  and \ncorresponding mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk \nmanagement plan.34 \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n33.  The government and the SBV have assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 2 \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the loan documents. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n34.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR 71,413,000 to the Socialist Republic \nof Viet Nam for subprogram 2 of the Financial Sector Deepening Program, from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 2% per annum during the grace period \nand thereafter; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms \nand  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan \nagreement presented to the Board. \nStephen Groff \nVice-President \n4 November 2015 \n                                                \n33 Macroeconomic and Debt Sustainability Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n34 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).
