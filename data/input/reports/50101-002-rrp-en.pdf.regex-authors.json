THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed project \nloan and grant, and a policy-based loan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Third Rural Water \nSupply and Sanitation Services Sector Development Program. The report also describes the \nproposed administration of a grant to be provided by the High-Level Technology Fund (HLTF)1 \nand, if the Board approves the proposed loans and grant, I, acting under the authority delegated \nto me by the Board, approve the administration of the HLTF grant.   \n \n2.  The sector development program (SDP) will support the efforts of the Government of \nCambodia to provide universal access to improved water supply and sanitation services, and \nachieve safe hygiene behavior in rural areas by 2025.2 The SDP comprises (i) a project, financed \nby a loan and grants, to expand rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) services in at least \n11 districts across 10 provinces;3 and (ii) a program, financed by a policy-based loan, to support \ngovernance and institutional improvements in RWSS planning, financing, and service delivery.  \n \nII.  THE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Economic outlook. Cambodia has made significant strides in economic development. Its \nper capita gross domestic product increased fivefold from $300 in 2000 to $1,500 in 2018.4 \nEconomic growth in 2018 remained strong at 7.3% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP), fueled \nby expanding tourism and strong foreign direct investment.5 Given the strong link between \neconomic growth and the provision of basic services, the government plans to ensure that all rural \nresidents, who account for about 77% of the country\u2019s total population of 16 million, will have \naccess to improved water supply and sanitation services by 2025.6  \n \n4.  Limited access to rural water supply and sanitation services. In 2017, access to \nimproved water supply7 in rural areas stood at 73%, but only 11% of that water supply was piped. \nRural residents spend considerable time and financial resources on acquiring their daily drinking \nwater from distant water sources, collecting rainwater, or having it delivered to their homes. \nAccess to improved sanitation was at 56% in rural areas, and about 41% of rural residents are \nstill practicing open defecation. Inequalities in access by income status are large. For example, \n                                                \n1  Financing partner: the Government of Japan.  \n2  Government of Cambodia, Ministry of Rural Development (MRD). 2014.

Manila.  \n6  The World Bank estimated that economic losses because of poor sanitation were equivalent to 7.2% of Cambodia\u2019s \ngross domestic product in 2005: World Bank. 2008. Economic Impacts of Sanitation in Cambodia. Jakarta. \n7  The Joint Monitoring Programme of the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) \ndefines improved water supply facilities as those which, by nature of their design and construction, have the potential \nto deliver safe water that meets the following criteria: (i) accessible on premises, (ii) available when needed, and \n(iii) free from contamination. An improved sanitation facility is one that hygienically separates human excreta from \nhuman contact. \n \n ", "2 \namong the poorest income quintile of the rural population, only 21% had access to improved \nsanitation, while access was at 100% in the richest income quintile.8  \n \n5.  Impacts on health. Diarrhea, which often results from poor sanitation and hygiene, is a \nmajor cause of children\u2019s illnesses, including stunting and impaired brain development. It is the \nsecond largest cause of infant and under-five mortality in Cambodia, which is the highest in \nSoutheast Asia. About 30% of children under the age of five has stunted growth, and the \nprevalence of stunting is 10% higher among children born to mothers from the poorest income \nquintile (42%). Studies also suggest that open defecation harms the physical and cognitive \ndevelopment of children, drawing attention to the need for improving RWSS services.9 \n \n6.  Climate change and disaster risks. Flooding and drought are major meteorological \nhazards  in  Cambodia. In  2011, floods  affected  more than  1.5  million  people  in  18  of the \n24 provinces, including four provinces along the Mekong River and the Tonle Sap Lake, which \nsuffered the heaviest damage. The total damage caused by floods was estimated to be more than \n1% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. In 2013, floods affected 1.5 million people and \nclaimed 168 lives in 20 provinces. In 2015 and 2016, droughts caused less rainfall, warmer \nweather, and delayed or shortened monsoon rains, affecting about 2.4 million people. Cambodia \nis also exposed to climate change risks with increased flooding and prolonged droughts, which \nmay affect the quality of RWSS services. \n \n7.  Institutional  arrangements  for  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  services.  The \nMinistry of Rural Development (MRD) is the lead agency for RWSS and rural hygiene, through its \nDepartment of Rural Health Care and the Department of Rural Water Supply. The Ministry of \nHealth is responsible for providing adequate water, sanitation, and handwashing facilities in health \ncenters, in coordination with the MRD. The Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology issues \nthe permits required for the abstraction of a defined volume of water. The Ministry of Education, \nYouth and Sports is responsible for providing sanitation in schools, in coordination with the MRD. \nAt present, Cambodia has no structured approach to tariff setting for RWSS services, and cost \nrecovery is based on expenditures incurred by the service providers or based on the agreed tariff \nset by the water and sanitation user groups (WSUGs).   \n \n8.  Limitations of current institutional arrangements. Cambodia has made progress in \nreforming the policy, legal, and institutional framework for decentralized RWSS service provision. \nHowever, the sustainable delivery of services is still hampered by structural shortcomings, \nincluding incomplete decentralization reforms.10 The MRD has not fully decentralized staff and \nfunctions; communities lack adequate guidelines and support to operate and maintain RWSS \nfacilities; and private sector participation is limited to water supply services in a few towns and \nvillages because legislation that properly governs private involvement in the RWSS service \nprovision does not exist.  \n \n9.  Weak planning and governance functions. Despite broader access to improved RWSS \nservices, the government has not been able to develop a unified registry of RWSS facilities and \nassets, or a comprehensive information system. The RWSS databases that do exist are scattered \nand fragmented, and not publicly accessible, making it difficult to obtain accurate information \n                                                \n8  World Health Organization\u2013UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme. 2019.

Washington DC. \n10  Decentralization is expected to improve service delivery since district administrations have better knowledge of the \nlocal needs and the decision-making process can be faster.  \n ", "3 \nwhen planning investments in RWSS facilities or allocating sufficient resources for their operation \nand maintenance (O&M). \n \n10.  Inadequate fiscal resources. To meet the target of universal RWSS coverage by 2025, \nthe government would need about $70.0 million annually to create the necessary infrastructure. \nHowever, the annual budget allocation to RWSS has been only $1.5 million on average from 2008 \nto 2019. Moreover, while about $8.0 million a year would be required to ensure proper O&M of \nRWSS facilities, the annual budget allocation has been only $0.5 million. \n \n11.  Government initiative to improve services and sector reforms. The government, with \nthe support from development partners and nongovernment organizations, made significant \nprogress in increasing access to improved RWSS services. It boosted the coverage of rural water \nsupply from 48% in 2000 to 73% in 2017, and the coverage of rural sanitation services from 4% \nin 2000 to 56% in 2017 (footnote 8). It also issued the Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene \nStrategy (RWSSHS), 2014\u20132025 with the aim of achieving universal access to safe water supply \nand improved sanitation, and safe hygiene behavior in rural areas by 2025 (footnote 2). The MRD \nissued a national action plan11 as a time-bound operational plan to meet the RWSSHS objectives.  \n \n12.  Both the RWSSHS and the action plan include specific decentralization targets per the \ngovernment\u2019s wider program of subnational reforms, initiated in 200112 and scaled up under the \nLaw on Administrative Management of Capital, Provinces, Municipalities, Districts and Khan, \n2008. The government\u2019s approach to sector reform includes decentralizing the O&M of facilities \nto district administrations in accordance with the National Program for Subnational Democratic \nDevelopment, 2010\u20132019.13 Since 2016, the MRD has been voluntarily transferring to district \nadministrators the O&M functions for rural sanitation, hygiene, and water supply. This has been \npiloted in seven districts with the aim of scaling up the transfer as a next step.14 \n \n13.  Asian Development Bank (ADB) support to service improvements. Since 2005, three \nADB-supported RWSS interventions totaling $54 million collectively improved water supply for \nabout 1 million people and sanitation for about 500,000 in more than 1,300 villages around Tonle \nSap Lake.15 This translates into 8% of Cambodia\u2019s rural population of 12.3 million gaining access \nto water supply and 4% gaining access to sanitation services. \n \n14.  ADB and development partners\u2019 support to policy reforms. ADB helped strengthen \nCambodia\u2019s RWSS policy by assisting the government\u2019s efforts of decentralization and capacity \nimprovements with two subprograms. Between 2008 and 2016, subprogram 1 supported the pilot \ndevolvement of RWSS O&M to district administrations, and subprogram 2 supported further \ndecentralization of RWSS investment functions to district administrations.16   \n \n                                                \n11  MRD. 2019. National Action Plan for Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene 2019\u20132023. Phnom Penh. \n12  The subnational reform (decentralization) was initiated with the issuance of the Law on Commune and Sangkat \nAdministration Management in 2001.   \n13  This includes (i) O&M of water supply facilities; and (ii) training and community development in sanitation, health, \nand hygiene matters. \n14  During the pilot, district administrations made progress on some of the newly delegated functions. However, late \ntransfer of funding from the MRD and limited human resources hampered the full implementation of the functions.   \n15  ADB. 2005.

The 2005 project was completed in 2010, the 2009 project in 2017, and the 2016 \nproject is expected for completion in June 2020. \n16  ADB. 2012. Decentralized Public Service and Financial Management Sector Development Program \u2013 Subprogram 1. \nManila. Subprogram 2 was approved in August 2016.   \n \n ", "4 \n15.  The World Bank provided 3-year technical assistance (2013\u20132015) focusing on building \nthe capacities of national government agencies to manage, plan, and develop a policy for the \noverall RWSS segment; and of subnational agencies to deliver RWSS services in line with the \ndecentralization reform.17 In 2013, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Global \nSanitation Fund assisted the MRD in developing an RWSS monitoring and evaluation framework \nby analyzing the quality of RWSS facilities and the institutional arrangements for service delivery. \nThese efforts contributed to the design and implementation of the government\u2019s RWSS reforms. \n \n16.  Sector development program components and design feature. The SDP is the most \nappropriate modality, given the need for both an investment project and a reform program to help \nachieve the RWSSHS development targets by 2025 and implement the national action plan for \n2019\u20132023 in an integrated manner. The investment project will reduce gaps in access to RWSS \nservices by constructing new or rehabilitating existing RWSS facilities. The reform program will \nsupport  institutional  and  governance  reforms  to  create  a  more  efficient  RWSS  planning \nmechanism; strengthen institutional capacities, particularly at the subnational level; encourage \nprivate sector participation in RWSS service provision; and enhance the resilience of RWSS \nfacilities. \n \n17.  The project component. The project component will expand RWSS access in at least \n11 districts in 10 provinces (footnote 3), benefiting about 400,000 people. The project will use a \nsector lending approach since (i) the government has a clear development plan targeting broader \nRWSS coverage by 2025 to meet sector priorities; (ii) links with the previous RWSS projects \n(footnote 15) are strong; (iii) the MRD has performed well in the previous RWSS projects;18 and \n(iv) the policies applicable to the sector are appropriate and will be improved as the project \nprogresses with support from the program component.19 Subprojects with (i) RWSS services \ncoverage below the national average, (ii) high poverty levels, and (iii) no overlapping RWSS \nprojects financed by other development partners or non-government organizations will be eligible \nfor project financing.20 The detailed selection criteria of subprojects are in the PAM (footnote 3). \n \n18.  The program component. The program will cover policy reforms to address (i) inefficient \nRWSS planning systems, (ii) limited authority and capacity of district administrations to deliver \nRWSS services, (iii) poor RWSS asset inventory and management systems, (iv) limited private \nsector involvement, and (v) the need to include climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster \nrisk management (DRM) approaches in the RWSS planning process to enhance the resilience of \nRWSS facilities. \n \n19.  Lessons. The SDP\u2019s design benefits from the following lessons from ADB\u2019s three earlier \nRWSS interventions (footnote 15) in Cambodia: (i) ensure greater focus on addressing gender \ninequality and supporting women\u2019s leadership to overcome cultural norms; (ii) develop equitable \nsolutions to meet increases in the cost of community-based small piped water supply facilities; and \n(iii) introduce CCA and DRM measures to mitigate the impact of climate change and natural \n                                                \n17  World Bank. 2016. Kingdom of Cambodia - RWSS Sector Improvement Support. New York.  \n18  Exposure to previous ADB-financed projects has improved MRD\u2019s project management capacity. In the first project, \nimplementation was hampered by MRD\u2019s limited capacity, resulting in the project closing date being extended. In the \nthird project, the implementation has benefited from strengthened capacity, and is likely to be completed on time. \n19  ADB. 2003. Sector Lending. Operations Manual. OM D3/BP. Manila. \n20 \u201cSubproject\u201d refers to project activities at the commune level (e.g., all project activities in a commune are deemed \none subproject). Of the 40 targeted subprojects, 15 were appraised during preparation. The project will be \nimplemented in four batches of subprojects, with the first batch consisting of 15 representative subprojects. \n \n ", "5 \nhazards on the quality of RWSS services.21 Advance procurement of civil works and consulting \nservices helped ensure the timely completion of the first project. A similar approach will be adopted \nunder the project component of the SDP.   \n \n20.  Strategic alignment. The SDP will contribute to the government\u2019s efforts to achieve \nuniversal coverage of improved water supply and sanitation services by 2025. The SDP is aligned \nwith pillars 1 (accelerate competitiveness and economic diversification) and 4 (improve governance)  \nof ADB\u2019s draft country partnership strategy, 2019\u20132023 for Cambodia, and is included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan, 2019-2021.22 The SDP is also in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \nand its operational priority (OP) 5 (promoting rural development), OP 2 (accelerating progress in \ngender equality), and OP 6 (strengthening governance and institutional capacity). \n \n21.  Development partner coordination. ADB is the largest contributor to infrastructure \ndevelopment in Cambodia\u2019s water supply and sanitation segments, both urban and rural, and \nprovides about 25% of the total externally financed aid for RWSS service provision. UNICEF is a \nkey development partner for water supply, sanitation, and hygiene, and the lead development \npartner in the technical working group for RWSS and hygiene.23 ADB coordinated the assessment \nand design of the SDP with the development partners, including the International Monetary Fund.   \n \nB.  Sector Development Program Description \n22.  The SDP\u2019s impact is aligned with the government\u2019s and the RWSSHS\u2019s target of universal \naccess to safe water supply and sanitation services in Cambodia by 2025. The SDP\u2019s outcome \nis universal access to safe and uninterrupted RWSS services in the participating districts. \n \n1.  Output 1: Rural water supply  infrastructure and services improved and \nexpanded \n \n23.  The project will rehabilitate rural water supply facilities that are damaged by age or natural \nhazards, and build new ones in at least 11 districts in 10 provinces (about 2,500 rural water \nfacilities in at least 400 villages in 40 communes). Selected schools and health centers in the \nparticipating districts will also receive such facilities, based on assessed needs, to ensure that \nthey have access to safe and uninterrupted water services. With financing support from the HLTF, \na pilot project of air-to-water generation units will be installed in seven locations that now have \nlimited access to safe drinking water, particularly during dry seasons.24  \n \n24.  The design of the facilities will incorporate the CCA and DRM principles to reduce the \nimpacts of natural hazards and make them more sustainable and resilient to weather shocks. \nProject beneficiaries will provide in-kind contributions and, prior to the implementation of works, \ncommunities will be consulted on their affordability and willingness to contribute. For example, in \n                                                \n21  ADB. 2011. Completion Report: Tonle Sap Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project.

Atmospheric water \ngenerators replicate this natural process of condensation by simulating the dew point, which allows them to make \nwater continuously, even in low-humidity conditions. The condenser transforms the vapor in the air from gas to a \nliquid (water) by continuously reaching the dew point with cool air. \n \n ", "6 \nvillages selected for piped water supply, service connections and meters will be set up after piped \nwater supply has become available to ensure that each house has access to it.25 \n \n25.  The program will support the target of improving rural water quality by adopting procedures \nto ensure that rural drinking water is routinely tested and meets government standards. The \nresults of these quality tests will be made available publicly through annual reports to be issued \nby the MRD.  \n \n2.  Output  2:  Rural  sanitation  infrastructure  and  services  improved  and \nexpanded \n \n26.  The project will build new toilets and septic facilities in households in at least 11 districts.26 \nIt will also construct public latrines at schools and/or health centers and advocate behavior change \ntoward hygiene and sanitation through awareness campaigns. The design of the sanitation \nfacilities will also incorporate the CCA and DRM principles. The program will support the MRD in \nreducing  ground  water  contamination  by  adopting  the  standard  procedures  for  septage \nmanagement in rural areas. Routine monitoring to ensure compliance with the standard procedure \nwill be implemented, and results will be published in annual reports to be issued by the MRD.  \n \n3.  Output 3: Institutional capacity improved \n \n27.  The  project  will  (i)  strengthen  the  technical,  financial,  management,  and  leadership \ncapacity  of  national  and  participating  subnational  administration  staff in  RWSS  investment \nplanning and O&M; (ii) support the Provincial Departments of Rural Development (PDRDs) in \npreparing annual reports on the quality of rural drinking water as verified in routine tests; and (iii) \nhelp project districts prepare RWSS safety plans by incorporating CCA and DRM in planning and \ndesign. As part of the safety plan activities, the project will train community members and \ngovernment staff on CCA and DRM principles. \n \n28.  The program will help develop and strengthen the management capacity of the MRD, its \nPDRDs, and the district administrations by introducing reforms to RWSS planning approaches. \nThis involves (i) developing an RWSS master plan and updating the RWSSHS; (ii) strengthening \nthe capacity and authority of district administrations by transferring personnel of the MRD\u2019s district \noffices and delegating their functions to district administrations; (iii) developing a computerized \nasset registry and information management system, which will help track the progress of asset \ncreation and the conditions of assets nationally, and assist investment planning and allocation of \nresources for the O&M of facilities; and (iv) encouraging private sector involvement by issuing \nenabling  regulations  and  guidelines  on  the  principles  of  responsibility,  accountability,  and \ntransparency for private RWSS service providers. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n29.  The project will ensure that safety plans with CCA and DRM measures are integrated in \n                                                \n25  In this case, the project will finance the construction of water sources and main pipelines. The WSUG will install the \nhouse connections and meters after receiving contributions from households. The project will also install public taps \nto enable poor households and those led by women who cannot afford house connections to have access to water.   \n26The project will provide the substructure material for latrines, while the beneficiary households will contribute by \n  \nproviding labor and latrine superstructure materials (details as per the PAM [footnote 3]). Overall, community \ncontributions are estimated at $3.05 million for the construction of facilities and the O&M of built facilities. However, \nthe contributions are not included in the project cost because they are voluntary and will not involve any legal \nagreements between the project and community members.   \n \n ", "7 \nRWSS designs to enhance the sustainability of RWSS services, and draw from the climate risk \nand disaster vulnerability analysis carried out during project preparation.27 The project will also \npilot the installation of air-to-water generation units (footnote 24) financed under the HLTF to help \nvillages that have limited access to safe drinking water, particularly during dry seasons. About 2,500 \nvillage residents are expected to benefit from this pilot project. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n30.  Overall financing. The SDP is estimated to cost $52.9 million. ADB will provide a policy-\nbased loan of $15 million, an investment loan of $29.6 million, and an investment grant of $4.4 \nmillion. Grant cofinancing of $1 million from the HLTF will help fund the investment project.

Administered by the Asian Development Bank.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n31.  Sector needs and investment plan. The government\u2019s projected total net borrowing \nrequirement for 2019 is estimated at $1.2 billion. To finance the deficit, the government plans to \nraise about $1 billion from loans, and about $0.2 billion through grants, from official development \nassistance. Of the annual $70 million required to achieve universal RWSS coverage by 2025, an \nestimated $10.5 million is needed for institutional and policy reforms. To facilitate the reforms, an \nestimated $63 million will be required over the 6-year period from 2019 to 2025, which marks the \nend of the current RWSSHS. The proposed policy-based loan will contribute $15 million (about \n23%), the government will finance $12.5 million (about 20%), and other development partners are \nlikely to finance $35.5 million (57%). \n \n32.  The proposed policy-based loan. The government requested a concessional loan of \n$15 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the program. The size of the \npolicy-based loan reflects the government\u2019s overall financing needs, the strength of the reform, \nand the development expenditures arising from the program, as specified in the development \npolicy letter (Appendix 3) and the policy matrix (Appendix 4). The policy-based loan will be \ndisbursed  in  two  tranches.  The  first  tranche  of  $5  million  will  be  released  upon  loan \neffectiveness.28 The second tranche of $10 million is expected to be released in March 2022, \nupon full compliance with the second-tranche conditions. The disbursement is split into two \ntranches because the first-tranche actions serve as the basis for the implementation of actions \nincluded in the second tranche. All policy actions will be applied nationally, i.e., beyond the project \nareas, to support the government in achieving universal RWSS service coverage. \n                                                \n27 Climate Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 All policy actions under Tranche 1 have been completed. \n ", "8 \n33.  The proposed project financing. The government requested (i) a concessional loan of \n$29.6 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, (ii) a grant of $4.4 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources, and (iii) grant cofinancing of $1.0 million from the HLTF (financed by the \nGovernment of Japan). The loan and grants total $35.0 million and will finance civil works, \nconsulting services, capacity building, and taxes and duties for civil works and capacity building. \nThe government will finance $2.9 million in recurrent costs, interest during construction, and tax \nexemption for the consulting services.

The project is considered at medium risk from climate change and disasters. The CCA \nmeasures are estimated at $6.2 million, of which ADB will finance $5.2 million and the HLTF will \ncover $1.0 million. ADB will fully finance the DRM measures estimated to cost $13.2 million. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n35.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 3). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspect  Arrangements \n  Policy-Based Loan  Project Loan and Grants \nImplementation period  June 2019\u2013September 2021  October 2019\u2013December 2023 \nEstimated completion date  31 March 2022  31 December 2023 \nEstimated loan and grant closing date  31 March 2022  30 June 2024 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Project Steering Committee \nChair: Ministry of Rural Development \nMembers: Ministry of Economy and Finance, and the Provincial \nDepartments of Rural Development of the 10 participating provinces  \n(ii)  Executing agencies  Ministry of Rural Development  \n ", "9 \nAspect  Arrangements \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  Department of Rural Water Supply (project coordination unit) \n(iv)  Implementation units  10 provincial project teams (one each at the 10 Provincial \nDepartments of Rural Development)  \nProcurement (civil works, workshops,  Open competitive bidding, request for  Multiple  $31.6 million \ntraining, goods)   quotations  contracts \nConsulting services (project implementation  Quality- and cost-based selection  356 person\u2013 $3.4 million \nconsultant and project auditors)  (80:20), consultant qualification  months \nselection \nAdvance contracting   Advance contracting for the project implementation consultant, and \ncivil works and goods for the first batch of subprojects (footnote 20) \nDisbursement  The loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed following the Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) of the \nAsian Development Bank, and detailed arrangements agreed between \nthe government and the Asian Development Bank.  \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Ministry of Rural Development estimates. \n \n36.  Project  readiness.  The  project  has  initiated  advance  actions  to  recruit  the  project \nimplementation consultant and to tender procurement-ready subprojects under the first of four \nsubproject batches (footnote 20). Contracts are expected to be awarded shortly after the loans \nand grants have been declared effective.   \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n37.  Feedback  from  previous  project  beneficiaries  on  the  equipment,  facilities,  and \ntechnologies used have led to the development of tried-and-tested standard designs, which are \nselected based on the prevailing conditions at each commune and village. These designs have \nproven to be robust, durable, technically viable, and well received by the communities. The project \nwill scale up the designs proven to be compatible with local conditions, and build community \ncapacity for O&M. Location and design features of RWSS facilities will factor in climate change \nand disaster risk considerations, specifically to provide better protection against flood damage \nand potential contamination from latrines during flooding. Additional refinements will be made as \nmore emphasis is placed on sustainability, CCA, and DRM.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n38.  The economic benefits of the project component were quantified in terms of health \nbenefits. The economic analysis was done by conducting a cost\u2013benefit analysis over the project \nperiod, calculating the economic net present value and economic internal rate of return, and \ncarrying out sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of changes in key variables. The project \nbenefit  is  estimated  at $57.3 million,  and the economic  net present  value  is  estimated  at \n$32.3 million. The economic internal rate of return is 22.0%, which is above the economic \nopportunity cost of capital at 9.0%, indicating significant economic returns. The results of the \nsensitivity analysis ranged from 18.7% to 21.9%, and are deemed satisfactory under all scenarios. \nAs the project is not generating income, the financial analysis focused on assessing the project\u2019s \nfinancial sustainability. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n39.  The estimated annual O&M cost of $365,000 will be shouldered by the 100,000 benefiting \nhouseholds, implying that each household will be required to contribute $3.65 annually through \n ", "10 \nthe  WSUG.  Historical  data  on  funds  collected  by  WSUGs  under  the  previous  projects \n(footnote 15)  indicate  that  households  can  afford  this  cost,  which  establishes  the  financial \nsustainability of the project. Following the government\u2019s policies on O&M of RWSS facilities, a \nWSUG  will  be  established  for  each  facility  built.  The  institutional  arrangement,  roles,  and \nresponsibilities of the WSUGs will be in accordance with guidelines issued by the MRD. Details \nof the WSUGs\u2019 tasks, roles, and arrangements are provided in the PAM (footnote 3).  \n \nD.  Governance \n40.  The procurement risk is rated medium because the MRD and the Ministry of Economy \nand  Finance  provided  satisfactory  procurement  supervision  under  the  previous  projects \n(footnote 15). This is expected to continue given that the same team will undertake project \nimplementation and that the nature of procurement remains unchanged, i.e., involving small civil \nworks and/or goods contracts. The procurement of civil works and goods and selection of \nconsultants will be implemented according to the ADB Procurement Policy (2017) and the \nProcurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017), as amended from time to time.   \n \n41.  Financial  management  assessments.  The  financial  management  risk  is  rated \nsubstantial because of the low capacity of MRD and PDRD staff for accounting and financial \nreporting, the presence of manual data inputs in financial reporting, and a poor internal audit \nfunction. To mitigate this risk, the project will finance training sessions, system enhancements, \nand improvements to the scope of internal audit. The financial management risk for this project is \nalso affected by the lack of an acceptable and fully adopted accounting standard in Cambodia\u2019s \npublic sector. ADB and other development partners are supporting the government in developing \nnational  financial  reporting  standards  that  fully  align  with  the  International  Public  Sector \nAccounting Standards. \n \n42.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MRD.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 3). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n43.  The SDP is classified as effective gender mainstreaming and will continue the gender \nmainstreaming activities begun under previous projects (footnote 15). Women and girls will benefit \nfrom time saved by not having to collect water, and from improvements to family health and quality \nof life. With better access to safe drinking water and sanitation, and greater awareness of hygiene, \nhouseholds will appreciate (i) spending less time or money on collecting or buying water; \n(ii) spending less time on caring for family members who fall victim to water-borne illnesses \nbecause of unsafe water supply and sanitation; and (ii) spending less on medicines.  \n \n44.  Gender action plan. The SDP\u2019s gender action plan combines (i) targets for female \nstaffing and decision-making in RWSS and communal institutions; (ii) women\u2019s participation in \nplanning, design, and O&M of facilities; and (iii) actions to improve gender awareness among the \nimplementing agencies. It places high importance on ensuring that the design of subprojects \nconforms to the strategic objectives and principles of the RWSSHS. The gender action plan is \nmindful of the mandates of the RWSSHS, particularly its aspirations to mainstream gender in \nRWSS service provision. The SDP will target women for decision-making positions (at least 40%). \n \n ", "11 \nF.  Safeguards \n45.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are detailed below.29 \n \n46.  Environment (category B). The project involves the construction of small-scale RWSS \ninfrastructure in villages to expand RWSS services. All subprojects are within residential areas, \nand environmental impacts are anticipated to be minor and localized and can be mitigated through \ngood construction site management. The 15 representative subprojects (the first batch) are \nclassified as category C. The overall project classification is confirmed as B.30  \n \n47.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). Subprojects under the first batch are classified \nas category C for involuntary resettlement impact because they will be established on either public \nor privately owned land, where the infrastructure will be used based on the shared-use agreement \nbetween beneficiary households. The overall project classification is confirmed as C. RWSS \nfacilities in the subsequent subprojects may require voluntary donation of minor portions of land \nand will be selected on a participatory basis by the communities.31  \n   \n48.  Indigenous peoples (category B). The poverty and social assessment, conducted as \npart of the project preparation, found that ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples reside in the \nareas where the subprojects will be implemented. The ethnic and indigenous people groups are \nfully integrated into mainstream society and enjoy equal rights. The project is classified category \nB for indigenous people impact because of the residents\u2019 improved access to sustainable and \nsafe water supply and sanitation. However, the first batch of subprojects does not have any impact \non ethnic or indigenous people groups. An Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework32 was \nprepared to guide the site selection process for subprojects under batches 2\u20134. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n49.

Initial \nEnvironmental Examination, Environmental and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2).   \n31  The MRD has implemented projects covering about 1,300 villages without any land acquisition and/or resettlement \nimpact; a similar approach will be adopted under the project component of the SDP. Landowners will have the power \nof choice, and another site will be selected if the owner refuses or is not qualified to donate because of the \nvulnerability status. A community participation framework was prepared to guide the site selection and voluntary land \ndonation process for subsequent subprojects (batches 2, 3, and 4).
