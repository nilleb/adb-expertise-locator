THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan \nand (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the additional financing of the \nTonle Sap Poverty Reduction and Smallholder Development Project (the original project). The \nreport also describes the proposed administration of a loan to be provided by the International \nFund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) for the additional financing of the project, and if the \nBoard approves the proposed loan and grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, approve the administration of the IFAD loan.1   \n \n2.  On 8 December 2009, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the original project \nto address constraints on poverty reduction and smallholder development in Cambodia.2 To date, \nsolid achievements in productive infrastructure and livelihood improvement have been made in \nthe 196 communes of the five project provinces (Banteay Meanchey, Kampong Cham, Kampong \nThom, Siem Reap, and Tboung Khmum). The additional financing will expand these interventions \nto 271 communes within the original five provinces plus two additional provinces (Battambang \nand  Prey  Veng).  Consistent  with  the  original project, the  additional financing  will  enhance \nagricultural productivity, promote diversification, and improve access to markets, resulting in \nbetter livelihoods and higher incomes in the project areas. The additional financing will also bring \nthe added benefit of enhanced resilience to disaster and climate risks. The inclusion of women, \nsmallholding farmers, and poor people will remain a priority.3  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Development problems in the agriculture sector in Cambodia include low agricultural \nproductivity, underdeveloped value chains, and deteriorating natural capital and high vulnerability \nto climate threats. For poor people in particular, inefficient use of resources, poor productive \ninfrastructure, and limited access to rural financial services are major constraints. Thanks partly \nto  ADB\u2019s  support  in  rural  infrastructure,  agricultural  productivity,  and  natural  resources \nmanagement since 1998, the average poverty rate for rural areas in Cambodia has been reduced \nfrom 53% in 2007 to 20% in 2012.4 However, the number of vulnerable people remains high; the \nloss of only $0.30 per day would bring Cambodia\u2019s poverty rate back up to 40%. 5  \n \n4.  Furthermore, disasters including extreme climate events such as floods and droughts \nhave aggravated adverse impacts on agriculture and other sectors.6 Cambodia is consistently \n                                                \n1  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2009. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Asian \nDevelopment Fund Grant and Administration of Grants and Loan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Tonle Sap \nPoverty Reduction and Smallholder Development Project. Manila.   \n3  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance for the additional financing of the Tonle Sap Poverty \nReduction and Smallholder Development Project (TA 9167-CAM).  \n4  ADB. 2014. Cambodia: Country Poverty Analysis 2014. Manila. \n5  World Bank. 2015. Cambodian Agriculture in Transition: Opportunities and Risks. Washington, DC. \n6  Flooding is a regular phenomenon in Cambodia. In 2000, an estimated 750,618 families were affected by floods, 347 \npeople were killed, with physical damage of $150 million. In 2009, a flood affected 11 provinces and caused damage \nof $132 million. Unprecedented floods were experienced with widespread impact on infrastructure and communities, \nresulting in the death of 250 people, $625 million in damages, and affecting 1.5 million people in 2011. A severe \ndrought was also experienced in the first 5 months of 2016.  \n ", "2 \nranked among the top 10 countries most vulnerable to extreme climate events.7 With climate \nchange, these impacts may worsen over time with adverse implications for competitiveness of the \nagriculture sector, and even more so for poor people. This makes it essential to continue to build \non  the  successes  achieved  under  the  original  project  with  enhanced  climate  and  disaster \nresilience through an additional financing.  \n \n5.  The proposed additional financing will contribute to (i) the government\u2019s Rectangular \nStrategy on Growth, Employment, Equity, and Efficiency 2014\u20132018, especially on enhancement \nof  the  agriculture  sector  (diversification,  value  addition,  and  productivity)  and  infrastructure \ndevelopment;  and  (ii)  the  Agricultural  Sector  Strategic  Development  Plan  2014\u20132018.  The \nadditional financing is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Cambodia country partnership strategy and \nincluded in the country operations business plan, 2017\u20132019.8 \n \n6.  The original project. On 8 December 2009, ADB approved an amount of $45.68 million \nto the Kingdom of Cambodia to finance the original project, including a loan of $3.40 million and \na grant of $27.30 million from the Asian Development Fund resources, a loan of $6.69 million and \na grant of $6.69 million financed by IFAD, and a grant of $1.60 million financed by the Government \nof Finland. The project became effective on 31 March 2010 with a closing date of 28 February \n2018. Its outcome is increased agricultural productivity and improved access to markets in 196 \ncommunes  in  the  Tonle  Sap  Basin.  The  project  has  three  outputs:  (i) community-driven \ndevelopment  through  a  block  grant,  (ii) enabling  environment  for  increased  agricultural \nproductivity and diversification, and (iii) effective project management. The Ministry of Agriculture, \nForestry, and Fisheries and the National Committee for Sub-National Democratic Development \nSecretariat are the executing agencies of the project.  \n \n7.  Eligibility for additional financing. The original project meets all eligibility criteria of a \nwell-performing project for additional financing, including (i) timely delivery of expected outputs, \nwith 17 out of 19 output targets achieved, including 417 kilometers of laterite roads rehabilitated \nagainst the target of 90 kilometers, and 55,000 hectares of land irrigated against the target of \n2,500 hectares; 9  (ii) satisfactory implementation progress: as of 17 August 2017, overall project \nimplementation progress was 96% against the elapsed period of 92%, and cumulative contract \nawards were $43.34 million (94.9%) and cumulative disbursements were $43.63 million (95.5%); \n(iii) satisfactory compliance with environmental and social safeguard requirements and on-track \nimplementation of the gender action plan; (iv) successful management of risks; and (v) on-track \nrating in ADB\u2019s project performance rating. The additional financing modality is suitable as it will \nbenefit from the original project\u2019s design and implementation arrangements. The sector modality \nwill also continue to be used, which has proven to be efficient and effective in the original project. \n \n8.  Key lessons. The original project achieved an overall economic internal rate of return \nexceeding  26%.10 This  success  is  mainly  explained  by  the  innovative  community-driven \ndevelopment approach. Other specific lessons include the following: (i) basic infrastructure \ninvestment addressed immediate needs and achieved considerable impact; however, in the \ncontext of climate change, infrastructure needs to become more resilient; (ii) laterite roads are \n                                                \n7  Germanwatch. 2014.

Manila.  \n9  Targets in road and irrigation were well exceeded because (i) commune councils opted for simple designs with actual \nunit cost for roads and irrigation lower than allocated unit cost and more was built; and (ii) budget was allocated for \ndifferent types of rural infrastructure but commune councils only prioritized roads and irrigation.  \n10  Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  ", "3 \nonly appropriate in case of light traffic and in areas not prone to flood; (iii) investment in irrigation \nshould be made only where there is sufficient water for at least two crops per year; (iv) stronger \noperation and maintenance (O&M) investment is needed; (v) livelihood improvement groups \n(LIGs) are a very good vehicle for agriculture extension services and the group modality should \nbe replicated; (vi) the use of district staff and special service providers has proven crucial to \nproject  success;  and  (vii)  assigning  the  National  Committee  for  Sub-National  Democratic \nDevelopment Secretariat as a second executing agency helped improve the original project \nperformance since they worked directly with the commune councils for implementation of output \n1, and with ADB on project administration matters without having to go through another agency.  \n \n9.  The additional financing will coordinate with relevant projects financed by ADB and other \ndevelopment partners,11 in particular with the Community-Based Disaster Risk Reduction Project \nto integrate disaster risk management (DRM) in the commune planning process, and with the \nInvestment Assessment and Application of High-Level Technology for Food Security in Asia and \nthe Pacific on the application of climate-resilient rice varieties.12 It will also coordinate with the \nClimate-Resilient Rice Commercialization Sector Development Project by developing secondary \nand tertiary canals to connect with the sector development project\u2019s canals,13 and adopt climate-\nresilience measures in road design developed under the Rural Roads Improvement Project.14  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The additional financing will scale up project activities in the original five provinces and the \nadditional two provinces. It will also change the original project scope by enhancing climate and \ndisaster resilience. The aggregate impact will be livelihoods and climate resilience in target \ncommunes in seven provinces in the Tonle Sap Basin improved. The aggregate outcome will be \nagricultural productivity increased, climate and disaster resilience strengthened, and access to \nmarkets improved in 271 communes in seven provinces in the Tonle Sap Basin.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  Output 1: Rural productive infrastructure and livelihood improved with capacity in \ndisaster risk management enhanced. The additional financing will focus on climate- and \ndisaster-resilient roads and irrigation schemes. It will rehabilitate an additional 450 kilometers of \nroads and upgrade irrigation infrastructure for an additional 6,000 hectares of land to allow for at \nleast two crops per year.15 Infrastructure subprojects will also be registered in the national asset \ninventory to ensure O&M beyond the additional financing implementation period. The existing \n1,241  LIGs  will  be  strengthened  and  an  additional  759  LIGs  will  be  established.  An  LIG \nassociation will also be established with financial contribution from LIG members themselves to \nimprove the group sustainability. Further, DRM in target communes will be strengthened through \n                                                \n11 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n12 ADB. 2014.

Output  2:  Enabling  environment  for  increased  agricultural  productivity, \ndiversification,  and  climate  resilience  created.  With  regard  to  productivity  and  climate \nresilience, training on climate-smart agriculture practices16 will be provided to 200 paddy selling \ngroups, LIGs and market improvement groups.17 Production of four climate-resilient rice seed \nvarieties will be promoted upon confirmation of market demand. Beyond production, to ensure \ndiversification of agriculture products, the additional financing will also improve value addition for \nboth rice and nonrice products such as vegetables, fish and chicken through (i) establishing \nmultistakeholder value chain platforms by bringing producers, processors and buyers together, \n(ii) establishing 364 market improvement groups, (iii) strengthening 103 existing small-scale \nagribusinesses, and (iv) establishing at least a further 97 agribusinesses.  \n \n13.  Output 3: Project management strengthened. The existing executing agencies will \ncontinue to manage the project. Support in project management will continue for project staff at \nnational,  provincial,  district,  and  commune  levels.  Consulting  services  and  special  service \nproviders\u2019 support will be extended or recruited as required.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n14.

Implementation arrangements remain the same, whereby the Ministry of Agriculture, \nForestry, and Fisheries, and the National Committee for Sub-National Democratic Development \nSecretariat are the executing agencies. Provincial and district support teams will be established \nwith seconded government staff from the respective departments. Commune councils will support \nall activities implemented at the commune level. The provincial teams will liaise with the Provincial \nDepartments of Rural Development and the Provincial Departments of Water Resources and \nMeteorology  to  ensure  that  the  respective  departments  are  fully  engaged  in  infrastructure \nplanning, procurement, design approval, asset registration, and O&M.

The additional financing will use designs proven to be compatible with local conditions and \ncommunity capacity for O&M. The following additional refinements will be made to ensure \nsustainability, climate change adaptation, and DRR: (i) roads\u2014increase road level to at least 0.5 \nmeters  above  the  maximum  flood  level,  pave  the  road  surface,  and  improve  drainage; \n(ii) irrigation\u2014ensure canal capacity is adequate and the top of canal banks are above maximum \nflood levels, ensure that farmers can drain their fields without resorting to damaging structures, \nand  strengthen  canal  walls  and  erosion  and  scour  protection  for  sluice  gates;  and \n(iii) embankments\u2014use good quality materials and improve compaction of materials during \nconstruction, reduce embankment slopes where possible, and protect slopes.  \n20.  Based upon the commune investment plans, candidate subprojects will be identified, \nscreened against eligibility criteria, and prioritized. All proposed subprojects will require an initial \nstudy to determine economic viability, climate and disaster resilience measures, and social and \nenvironmental impacts. If the results of the study confirm that all subproject selection criteria are ", "7 \nmet, the subprojects can proceed. If there is a risk of not meeting any of the requirements, a full \nfeasibility study for the subproject will be required. Feasibility studies for two representative \nsubprojects were carried out during project preparation and subproject viability was confirmed.20 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n21.  Economic and financial analyses were conducted for two representative subprojects. 21 In \naddition to rural infrastructure improvement, the analysis also considered the positive impact of \nLIGs and value chain support in the subproject area. The economic internal rate of return for the \nirrigation subproject is 19.1%, based on increase in cultivation area, improved yield and crop and \nlivestock diversification, and for the road subproject is 16.7%, based on vehicle operating cost \nsaving, time cost savings, and crop and livestock diversification. The poverty impact ratio for the \nirrigation  subproject  is 27.8%  and for the  road  subproject  is  34.2%. The financial  analysis \nindicates that the two subprojects will augment farm income substantially. Sensitivity analysis \nindicates that the economic viability is robust against downside risks, including investment cost \nand maintenance cost overrun, reduction in project benefits, and project delay by 1 year. The \nadditional financing will allocate 10% of infrastructure budget to cover O&M during the initial years \nwith consultants supporting the organization and training of the communities for O&M. It will also \napply DRR measures, and register subprojects in the national asset inventory for O&M to be \nundertaken by the government to extend the economic life of the physical assets.    \n \nC.  Governance \n \n22.  All procurement and recruitment of consultants to be financed by the ADB loan and grant \nand by the IFAD loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, \nas amended from time to time) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). Project implementation, procurement, and financial management will be \naligned with the government\u2019s standard operating procedures for externally financed projects. The \nprocurement classification for the additional financing is assessed as moderate risk. Procurement \ncapacity will be strengthened with assistance by procurement and contract administration officers \nat all levels. Most of the procurement for works will be conducted at the provincial level. \n   \n23.  The  financial  management  assessment  concluded  that  the  premitigation  financial \nmanagement  risk  level  for  the  additional  financing  was  substantial.  An  action  plan  was \nrecommended to ensure that (i) audited financial statements are submitted on time by preparing \nthe draft statements and required information early, and (ii) internal audit reports are submitted \nannually to ADB. The government has increased the number of pre-qualified independent auditors \nacceptable to ADB and is willing to recruit more than one firm to audit ADB funded projects to \nensure that the audited project financial statements that are in accordance with auditing standards \nacceptable to ADB are submitted to ADB within 6 months after the end of each related fiscal year.  \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  executing  agencies.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 18). \n \n                                                \n20 Subproject Feasibility Studies (accessible from the list of supplementary documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "8 \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n25.  The headcount poverty index for the target provinces varies by source of data, but the \npoverty level in all of the seven provinces of the additional financing is equal to or higher than the \nnational rural poverty level of 20%. In many villages under the additional financing, the population \nconsists largely of elderly smallholder farmers taking care of their grandchildren. Many of the \nhouseholds currently classified as no longer being poor are extremely vulnerable, and access to \nimproved livelihoods will improve the health and nutrition status of households and reduce the \nrisk of them falling back into poverty because of medical expenditure.  \n \n26.  Gender and development. The additional financing is categorized as effective gender \nmainstreaming. It will promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment through enhancing \nwomen\u2019s capacity in climate-smart agriculture, entrepreneurship, resilience to climate change and \ndisasters, and access to basic financing. Women will be targeted for employment in construction, \nrehabilitation and O&M of infrastructure. Moreover, women\u2019s meaningful participation in decision-\nmaking positions in the LIGs, market improvement groups, and service teams will be supported. \nA gender action plan has been prepared for the additional financing, which includes gender \nactions, performance indicators, and targets to promote women\u2019s voice and active participation in \nall project activities. Key gender targets include the following: (i) at least 25% of unskilled workers \nemployed are women, (ii) at least one woman to be elected to each management committee of \nthe new LIGs and service teams, (iii) at least 60% of rural loans are taken by women, (iv) \ncommune councilors from selected communes receive gender-responsive DRM training, (v) at \nleast 200 agribusiness enterprises (30% owned by women) are operational, and (vi) at least 40% \nof market improvement group and paddy selling group members are women.  \n \n27.  Gender action plan implementation is on-track under the original project, which showed \nthat women are the main direct beneficiaries of LIG-related activities, and access to rural loans \nand LIGs has been a successful vehicle for delivering financial resources and technology to \npromote diversification of income-generating agriculture activities. The following has enabled \nwomen to extend their livelihood options and get better incomes to support their family: (i) all LIGs \nhave at least one woman elected to the management committees and 52% of LIG management \ncommittee members are women, (ii) 54% of LIG members are women, (iii) 58% of rural loans \nwere taken by women, (iv) 67% of participants in refresher training on financial literacy and \nbusiness plans for LIGs were women, (v) 65% of women LIG members prepared business plans, \nand (vi) 64% of LIG members who participated in training needs assessment were women. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n28.  Environment (category B). Proposed development of rural infrastructure and livelihood \nactivities has potential for site-specific adverse construction environmental impacts, including loss \nof boundary vegetation, dust, noise, and disturbance of access and agricultural activities. These \nimpacts can be effectively reduced through appropriate site alignment and design, consideration \nof seasonal constraints, implementation of mitigation measures, and regular maintenance. The \nadditional financing is expected to increase agricultural productivity, which will increase demands \non water and has potential to increase the use of chemical pesticides. An initial environmental \nexamination (IEE) including an environmental management plan (EMP) has been prepared for \ntwo representative subprojects.22 The IEE includes a detailed water balance and has confirmed \nthat the water sources are sustainable. Training on integrated pest management approaches is \nincluded in the capacity building program. Public consultations were carried out and will continue \n                                                \n22 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "9 \nduring subproject implementation. The IEE and the EMP will serve as a template for future \nsubprojects, which are not subject to domestic environmental assessment requirements.   \n \n29.  An environmental assessment and review framework has been prepared to provide \nguidance on processes to be followed for future subproject selection, screening, assessment, and \nimplementation.23 Subprojects classified as category A will not be financed. Adequate resources \nhave been allocated for environmental safeguards assessment, implementation, monitoring, and \nreporting. Consulting services will provide capacity development support for EMP implementation. \nEnvironmental complaints will be handled through a safeguards grievance redress mechanism. \nThe environmental assessment and review framework and the draft IEE were disclosed on the \nADB website on 18 June 2017. The final IEE will be updated and disclosed following detailed \nengineering design. The project is classified as medium climate risk. A climate and disaster risk \nassessment has been prepared and all subprojects will be screened for climate and disaster risks \nand incorporate risk reduction measures.24 The representative subprojects include flood-resilient \ndesign specifications such as canal wall strengthening, erosion and scour protection for sluice \ngates, increase in road height, additional drainage structures, and slope stabilization measures.  \n \n30.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). There will be no significant involuntary physical \nor economic dislocation, relocation, or loss of livelihood. Land acquisition will be limited and is \nexpected to comprise (i) thin strips of land to accommodate irrigation canal construction and \naccess road improvement within irrigation schemes, or (ii) minor road widening to accommodate \nraised profiles and reduced slopes on verges when roads are rehabilitated to incorporate climate \nresilience and DRR measures. These strips of land may be acquired through voluntary donation, \nnegotiated settlement, or involuntary land acquisition and resettlement for those not willing to \ndonate land voluntarily. Since no involuntary resettlement is expected in the two representative \nsubprojects, no land acquisition and resettlement plan is required, although two due diligence \nreports have been prepared. A resettlement framework has been prepared and will be used to (i) \nfurther screen and select subprojects during implementation, rejecting all category A subprojects; \n(ii) guide the preparation of land acquisition and resettlement plans where required; and (iii) \nconduct and report the due diligence required to establish voluntary land donation bona fides.25 \n31.  Indigenous peoples (category B). An indigenous peoples planning framework has been \nprepared.26 Only nine out of the 271 communes are inhabited by indigenous peoples. The \nindigenous peoples will benefit alongside majority communities, but efforts will be made to ensure \ntheir participation. The executing agencies will ensure that all ethnic minority groups in and around \nproposed  subproject  locations  are  (i)  consulted  on  their  willingness  to  participate  and  the \nsuitability of the sites and subproject activities, and (ii) given an equal opportunity to participate in \nsubproject activities including training. For the two representative subprojects, no indigenous \npeoples are present and no indigenous peoples plan is required. Screening will be conducted for \nall subprojects following procedures set out in the indigenous peoples planning framework, and if \nindigenous peoples are the sole or the overwhelming majority of direct project beneficiaries, and \nwhen only positive impacts are identified, the elements of an indigenous peoples plan could be \nincluded in the overall subproject design rather than in a separate indigenous peoples plan. If \nadverse impacts are expected, an indigenous peoples plan will be prepared. \n \n                                                \n23 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Project Climate and Disaster Risk Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n \n ", "10 \nF.
