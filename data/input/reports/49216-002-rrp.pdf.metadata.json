Sri  Lanka  has  improved  its  energy  sector  performance,  and \n3. \nachieved  a  national  electrification  ratio  of  98%  in  2014  compared  with  29%  in  1990.  The \nremaining  2%  of  electrification  is  the  most  difficult  to  accomplish,  and  is  mainly  in \nunderdeveloped areas and small isolated islands around the country. Although some provinces \nhave achieved 100% electrification, the former conflict-affected Northern and Eastern provinces \nhave  only  92%  and  94%  electrification;  and  Uva  and  North  Central  provinces  achieved  95%, \nwith  several  districts  falling  well  below  this  level.4 Improvement  of  the  33-kilovolt  (kV)  medium \nvoltage network is needed to ensure system reliability and expand power supply into these rural \nareas,  where  many  poor  households  remain  unconnected  and  those  connected  have  poor \nquality  of  electricity  supply.  Several  small \n1,800\u20134,500  people  cannot  be  provided  with  electricity  through  extension  of  the  grid.  These \nislands are supplied by expensive electricity generated by inefficient, old diesel generation sets \nthat provide electricity for limited hours during the day, with an electrification ratio of 38%\u201360%. \n \n4. \nThe  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  aims  to  ensure  sustainable  development  of  energy \nresources by improving the power supply systems to provide access to electricity services to the \nentire  population.  Sri  Lanka  has  a  national  investment  program,  including  sector  investments \nthat are based on the National Energy Policy and Strategies.5 The National Energy Policy and \nStrategies  includes  a  sector  road  map,  a  long-term  investment  plan,  and  policy  and  reform \nmeasures.  The  country\u2019s  installed  generation  capacity  of  3,932  megawatts  produces  12,357 \n\nisolated \n\nislands  with  a  population  of                        \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Financing partners: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. \n3  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Preparing  the                       \n\nSupporting Electricity Supply Reliability Improvement Project (TA 8952-SRI). \n\n4  The 2015 electrification rate is 85% in Mannar district, 75% in Kilinochchi district, and 80% in Mulathivu district, all \n\nin the Northern Province. The 2015 electrification rate in Batticaloa district of the Eastern Province is 89%. \n\n5  Government of Sri Lanka. 2008. National Energy Policy and Strategies of Sri Lanka. Colombo. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ngigawatt-hours of electricity (2014),6 adequately covering current demand. Generation capacity \nis sufficient to expand electricity supply further. The government intends to provide electricity to \nthe  population  through  the  grid  on  the  main  island  and  mini-grid  systems  on  small  isolated \nislands.  The  project  will  contribute  to  the  government\u2019s  goal  of  expanding  access  to  electricity \nand developing clean energy. \n \n5. \nProject\u2019s  value  addition.  The  project  will  directly  benefit  the  development  of  lagging \nareas. It  will  cover  106 rural  electrification  schemes7 and  2,372 kilometers  (km)  of  low  voltage \nline  extensions.  Innovative  hybrid  mini  grids,  consisting  of  wind\u2013solar  and  efficient  diesel \ngeneration systems  coupled  with energy  storage  (lithium-ion  batteries), will  be  implemented  in \nthe small isolated islands.8 As a result, the project will help to ensure inclusiveness and access \nto  electricity  by  all  the  population.  The  project  is  expected  to  provide  electricity  to  about \n35,710 rural households,9 including the former conflict-affected Northern and Eastern provinces \nas well as Uva and North Central provinces where the current electrification level is lower than \nin  other  parts  of  the  country.  Improvement  of  the  medium  voltage  network  will  enhance  the \nquality  and  reliability  of  electricity  supply  to  more  than  493,000  consumers.  The  project  is \nconsistent with the interim country partnership strategy for Sri Lanka of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB).10 It builds on previous ADB interventions focused on supporting transmission and \ndistribution  investments  to  expand  access  to  clean  and  reliable  electricity,  and  renewable \nenergy development.11 \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n6. \nThe  impact  will  be  increased  access  to  clean,  reliable,  and  affordable  power  supply \naligned with the National Energy Policy and Strategies of Sri Lanka (footnote 5). The outcome \nwill be enhanced electricity supply, and distribution system efficiency and reliability. \n                                                \n6  Ceylon Electricity Board. 2015.

A steering committee, chaired by the MPRE secretary, will guide \nCEB,  LECO,  SEA,  and  NWSDB;  and  review  progress  and  results.  CEB,  LECO,  SEA,  and \nNWSDB  will  set  up  project  management  units.  The  units  will  oversee  procurement, \ndisbursement,  financial  management  and  accounting,  quality  assurance,  and  social  and \nenvironmental  issues;  and  will  coordinate  with  the  procurement  committee,  appointed  by  the \ncabinet  or  MPRE,  depending  on  the  contract  size.  Full-time  managers  will  supervise  each \nproject component. \n \n15. \nThe  government  and  CEB  have  asked  ADB  to  approve  advance  contracting  for  the \nprocurement of goods and civil works, including preparing bidding documents, and inviting and \nreceiving  bids  for  project  contracts,  and  retroactive  financing  under  the  project.  Retroactive \nfinancing will be allowed for up to 20% of the loan amount for expenditures incurred prior to loan \neffectiveness,  but  no  earlier  than  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the  loan  agreement.  The \ngovernment and CEB were advised that ADB\u2019s approval of advance contracting and retroactive \nfinancing  in  principle  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  any  part  of  the  project.  The \nimplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the  project \nadministration manual (PAM).15 \n                                                \n15 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  CEB (for loan-financed components); LECO, SEA, and NWSDB (for \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nEstimated loan and grant closing \ndate \nManagement \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n\n(iv)  Project management unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\n \nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \n\nDisbursement  \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n1 October 2016\u201330 September 2021 \n30 September 2021 \n31 March 2022 \n\nSteering committee consisting of the secretary, MPRE (chair), and \nrepresentatives of MOF, MNPEA, MPRE, CEB, LECO, SEA, and \nNWSDB (members) \nMPRE (for grant-financed components), CEB (for loan-financed \ncomponents) \n\n$5.79 million \n\n$93.47 million \n\n8 procurement \npackages \n1 procurement \npackagea \n44 person-months \n\ngrant-financed components) \nEstablished in CEB, LECO, SEA, and NWSDB \nInternational \ncompetitive bidding \nNational competitive \nbidding \nQuality- and cost-\nbased selection  \n \nIndividual \n$0.38 million \nAdvance contracting, including preparation of bidding documents, \ninviting and receiving bids for contracts, and retroactive financing of \nup to 20% of the loan amount for expenditures incurred prior to loan \neffectiveness, but no earlier than 12 months before the signing of \nthe loan agreement. \nThe loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time \nto time) and detailed arrangements agreed between the \ngovernment, CEB, LECO, SEA, NWSDB, and ADB. \n\n15 person-months \n\n$0.70 million \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  CEB  =  Ceylon  Electricity  Board,  LECO  =  Lanka  Electricity  Company  Limited, \nMOF = Ministry of Finance, MNPEA = Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, MPRE = Ministry of Power \nand Renewable Energy, NWSDB = National Water Supply and Drainage Board, SEA = Sustainable Energy Authority. \na  The procurement package includes concrete poles that are normally manufactured and supplied locally.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \nCEB and LECO conducted technical studies for the proposed components with support \n16. \nfrom  ADB  technical  assistance.16 ADB  followed  up  with  its  own  assessment  and  found  the \ntechnical  studies  generally  acceptable.

Technical  Assistance  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  Supporting  Electricity \nSupply Reliability Improvement Project. Manila (TA 8952-SRI for $225,000, approved on 14 September 2015, and \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund [TASF-V]).  \n\n\fEconomic and Financial  \n\nJFPR  grant.  The  work  undertaken  indicates  that  the  proposed  technical  solutions  are  feasible \nand execution arrangements are satisfactory.  \n \nB. \n \n17. \nThe project will benefit electricity consumers and the overall economy through improved \nsupply reliability, reduced consumption of conventional fuels, and incremental consumption. The \neconomic  viability  of  the  project  has  been  examined  through  a  cost\u2013benefit  analysis,  by \ncomparing  with-  and  without-project  scenarios,  conducted  using  ADB  guidelines  for  economic \nanalysis.17 All  project  components  have  been  confirmed  as  least-cost,  with  sound  economic \nrationale for investment. The aggregate economic internal rate of return is estimated at 13.1%, \nabove the assumed hurdle rate of 12.0% and, on this basis, the overall project is economically \nviable.  A  sensitivity  and  risk  analysis  demonstrates  adequate  economic  performance  for  the \nproject.  The  renewable  energy  and  rural  electrification  components  have  slight  sensitivity  to  a \nvariation in certain project parameters, reflecting an economic internal rate of return below the \nhurdle rate as a result of higher costs for the \u201clast mile\u201d electrification.18 \n \n18. \nFinancial viability  was examined by comparing the incremental costs and benefits on a \nwith-  and  without-investment  basis  using  ADB  guidelines.19 The  real  weighted  average  cost  of \ncapital  was  calculated  for  each  component  and  resulted  in  2.6%  average  costs  for  the  overall \nproject. Financial viability was assessed by comparing the weighted average cost of capital with \nthe  financial  internal  rate  of  return  for  each  component  and  for  the  overall  project.  The \naggregate  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  3.2%,  which  is  slightly  higher  than  the  weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital  of  2.6%,  suggesting  that  the  overall  project  is  marginally  viable. \nSensitivity analysis shows that the estimated financial returns are sensitive to cost overruns or \nimplementation delays that are excluded from the regulated revenue of CEB and LECO.20 \n \nC. \n \n19. \nCEB  and LECO  are the  only  two power  utilities  in the  country.  SEA  is  the  government \nagency  responsible  for  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy  development,  and  NWSDB  is \nthe  government  agency  responsible  for  water  supply.  The  government  and  CEB  own  most  of \nLECO\u2019s shares; municipalities and the Urban Development Authority are minority shareholders. \nAs  a  distribution  company,  LECO  operates  based  on  a  separate  license  and  demonstrates \nprofitability. CEB is a vertically integrated utility comprising six functional business units (FBUs). \nThe  Sri  Lanka  Electricity  Act,  2009  encourages efficiency  improvements  of  CEB  by  regulating \neach  FBU.  The  act  empowers  the  Public  Utilities  Commission  of  Sri  Lanka  (PUCSL),  an \nindependent regulator for energy and water established under the PUCSL Act, 2002, to regulate \nthe  electricity  supply  industry.  PUCSL  began  regulating  each  FBU  separately  and  issued \nindividual licenses in 2009. It established a tariff methodology and a road map for tariff reforms \nand rebalancing in 2011. Financial accounts are segregated to allow each FBU to operate as a \nprofit  center,  and  a  transfer-pricing  scheme  between  FBUs  was  developed.  However,  the \nprocess  of  the  delegation  of  day-to-day  management  and  financial  decision  making  to  FBU \nheads  is  not  complete,  and  the  transfer-pricing  scheme  between  FBUs  is  not  functioning \nproperly.  \n \n20. \nLECO, SEA, and NWSDB\u2014which will implement the grant-financed components\u2014have \nthe necessary experience and capacity to undertake activities envisaged under the grants. CEB \n                                                \n17 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18  The \u201clast mile\u201d is defined as the last stage in providing services to consumers that has proved to be expensive.  \n19 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 The  energy  sector  regulator  allows  utilities  to  earn  annual  revenue  according  to  a  revenue  control  formula  that \n\nGovernance \n\nexcludes cost overruns or implementation delays and is defined in the approved tariff methodology. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nhas  the  necessary  capacity  to  undertake  the  project.  It  was  the  implementing  agency  for  past \nADB-financed  projects  and  has  managed  investments  funded  by  other  development  partners. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  of  CEB  concludes  that  it  can  fulfill  ADB\u2019s  fiduciary \nrequirements  for  the  project.  CEB  regularly  faces  cash  shortfalls  because  of  low  tariffs, \nexpensive power generation, and expensive short-term loans. These shortcomings need to be \ncorrected. Under the 2009 act, all tariffs must reflect costs and the Treasury will bear the cost of \nany  government-approved  subsidy.  In  March  2008,  the  government  introduced  a  new  tariff \nstructure  that  increased  average  retail  tariffs  by  30%.  The  tariff  order  issued  by  PUCSL  in \nJanuary  2011  increased  the  average  electricity  tariff  by  about  8%.  In  February  2012,  PUCSL \nimplemented  a  fuel  adjustment  formula  for  certain  customer  categories.  In  April  2013,  retail \nelectricity tariffs were increased by 35% on average. The government has also converted CEB\u2019s \nlong-term debt into equity. \n \n21. \nThe  financial  management  capacity  of  all  four  implementing  agencies  is  assessed  as \nacceptable  for  the  project.  In  the  case  of  CEB,  the  overall  risk  is  assessed  as  moderate  and \nseveral  risk  mitigation  measures  will  be  implemented.  The  overall  risk  has  been  assessed  as \nlow  for  LECO,  SEA,  and  NWSDB.  Details  of  the  financial  management  assessments  of  CEB, \nLECO,  SEA,  and  NWSDB  are  in  the  PAM  and  in  the  assessment  of  CEB\u2019s  financial \nperformance  and  projections.21 CEB\u2019s  financial  performance  has  improved  to  some  extent  in \n2014\u20132015. However, its ongoing financial sustainability will depend on the extent to which it is \nallowed  to  charge  its  customers  fully  cost-reflective  tariffs  to  service  debt  and  to  undertake  a \nprudent capital and operating expenditure program. Based on the government\u2019s request to lend \ndirectly  to  CEB  for  the  project  under  the  sovereign  guarantee,  specific  financial  management \ncovenants are included in the draft legal agreements. \n \n22. \nAll  procurement  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Recruitment  of  consultants  will  be  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  An \noversight  role  by  ADB  will  ensure  integrity  in  procurement  and  implementation  activities.  CEB \nmaintains a project website that will be updated regularly and will include (i) bidding procedures, \nbidders,  and  contract  awards;  (ii)  use  of  funds  disbursed  under  the  project;  and  (iii)  physical \nprogress.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  the  government,  CEB,  LECO,  SEA,  and  NWSDB.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \nD. \n \n23. \nThe project will contribute to sustainable economic development, poverty reduction, and \nsocial well-being through increased access to electricity, and improvement in the reliability and \nquality  of  power  supply.  Greater  access  to  a  stable  supply  of  electricity  will  promote  business \nexpansion  and  increase  jobs,  which  will  help  reduce  poverty.  Electricity  generated  by  the \nrenewable energy systems will be used to produce drinking water at the seawater desalination \nplant,  and  ice  for  fish  and  food  storage  at  the  ice-making  factory  that  will  be  constructed  on \nNainativu island, to address the immediate needs of poor households. The project is expected \nto  generate  jobs  for  skilled  and  unskilled  laborers  during  construction  and  throughout  the \noperation  of  the  established  renewable  energy  systems,  water  desalination  plant,  and  ice-\nmaking factory in the small  islands. Reliability improvement of the 33 kV network will enhance \nthe  quality  and  reliability  of  the  electricity  supply  to  more  than  493,000  consumers,  and  rural \nelectrification  extension  will  provide  access  to  electricity  for  about  35,710  households  in  rural \n\nPoverty and Social   \n\n                                                \n21 The  summary  of  CEB\u2019s  historical  financial  performance  and  projections  is  in  Financial  Analysis  (accessible  from \n\nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nareas.  Improved  access  to  electricity  and  better  supply  quality  will  also  enhance  the  living \nstandards of rural households. \n \nE. \n \nEnvironment.  The  project  investments  are  classified  as  category  B  for  environment.22 \n24. \nMajor components include the construction of 33 kV tower lines, gantries, and hybrid renewable \ngeneration  systems  where construction  work  is  limited  to  building foundations for transmission \ntowers,  gantries,  and  small  renewable  energy  systems.  CEB,  LECO  and  NWSDB  have \nadequate  institutional  capacity,  commitment,  and  experience  to  manage  environmental  risks \nduring  the  construction  and  operation  of  project  facilities.  Potential  environmental  impacts  are \nmostly  temporary,  predictable, reversible,  and can be mitigated;  and  sensitive ecosystems  will \nnot be impacted. Environmental management plan mitigation measures will be incorporated into \ncivil  works  contracts,  giving  contractors  the  primary  responsibility  for  implementation  during \nconstruction.  CEB,  LECO,  and  NWSDB  will  supervise  construction  and  environmental \nmanagement  plan  implementation.  The  contractors,  CEB,  LECO,  and  NWSDB  will  adhere  to \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and national environmental regulations. \n \n25. \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement.23 No  physical  displacement  is  envisaged.  Some  0.600  hectares  (ha)  of  private \nland will be acquired (0.10% of the total 546.24 ha of land required) and 0.038 ha of land will be \nlost to tower footing (0.06% of the total land required). Twelve households will be affected by the \nland  acquisition  and  about  480  households  will  be  affected  by  the  right-of-way,  but  none  will \nlose  10%  or  more  of  productive  assets.  The  project\u2019s  social  impacts  have  been  adequately \nassessed. Where new gantries are built on commercial and private land, compensation will be \npaid  to  the  owners  at  replacement  cost.  Distribution  transformers  will  be  mainly  mounted  on \npoles. Transmission and distribution lines primarily cross public and unused lands. Construction \nwill  be  carried  out  during  non-cropping  seasons. Where  cropland  is  affected,  compensation  at \nreplacement cost will be paid. Budgetary provisions are in place to compensate affected people \nin  a  timely  manner  for  these  losses  if  and  when  they  occur.  A  resettlement  plan  has  been \nprepared  that  is  adequate  to  address  the  assessed  risk.  CEB  has  implemented  several  ADB \nprojects and is capable of conducting resettlement in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement. Special attention will be paid to addressing gender equity issues in the resettlement \nplan.  Additional  assistance  will  be  given  to  vulnerable  households,  including  those  headed  by \nwomen. Social surveys and consultations were undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement.  The  loan  agreement  will  include  a  standard  assurance  related  to  core  labor \nstandards  for  contractors,  including  equal  pay  for  equal  types  of  work,  and  an  awareness \nprogram on HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases. The project is classified as category C \nfor indigenous peoples, as no indigenous peoples will be affected.  \n \n26. \nClimate  change  impact.  The  project\u2019s  renewable  energy  interventions  will  bring  an \nadditional  2.16  gigawatt-hours  of  wind  and  solar  power  generation  to  the  electricity  supply \nsystem  per  year  and  result  in  avoiding  about  2,697  tons  of  carbon  dioxide emissions  per  year \nfor the useful life of the plants. The new medium voltage lines constructed to improve reliability \nof  electricity  supply  in  rural  areas  will  help  to  avoid  generation  of  19  gigawatt-hours  per  year, \nequivalent  to  preventing  6,900  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  emissions  per  year,  adjusted  for \nemissions  of  additional  electricity  consumption  by  new  customers.  The  climate  change  risk \nscreening confirms that the project components have moderate climate change risks.24 \n\n                                                \n22 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Project  Climate  Risk  Assessment  and  Management  Report  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n27. \nGovernance  risk  stems  from  CEB  having  insufficient  cash  to  fund  its  operations \n(para. 20).  Risks  to  project  implementation  include  delays  in  generation  and  transmission \ninvestments that may impact improvements in electricity supply and reliability of the distribution \nnetwork,  and  cost  escalation.  These  risks  appear  to  be  moderate  and  may  be  mitigated  by \n(i) ensuring progress on power  sector  reforms, government  efforts to increase supply  capacity \nand reduce generation costs, and improving CEB\u2019s corporate financial management; (ii) timely \nimplementation  of  CEB\u2019s  long-term  generation  and  transmission  investment  plans;  and  (iii) \nclosely  supervising  implementation  and  advance  contracting.  The  integrated  benefits  and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the mitigation costs. Major risks and mitigating measures are \nsummarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management \nplan.25 \n\nRisks \nInsufficient cash generation \nby Ceylon Electricity Board \nto fund its operations \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nProgress on energy sector reforms, including an independent energy \nsector regulatory framework, rationalizing tariff structures, and internal \nstructural reforms in Ceylon Electricity Board; improving Ceylon Electricity \nBoard\u2019s corporate financial management; and commissioning low-cost \ngeneration, including from hydropower and other renewable energy \nsources \nTimely implementation of Ceylon Electricity Board\u2019s long-term generation \nand transmission investment plans \nClose supervision by the steering committee and the Asian Development \nBank, open and transparent competitive bidding, proactive project \nimplementation, advance contracting, inclusion of physical and price \ncontingencies in the cost estimates \n\nDelays in generation and \ntransmission investments \nCost escalation including \nunexpected increase in \nprices of commodities and \nraw materials \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n28. \nThe  government  and  CEB  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. The government and CEB have agreed with ADB on certain  \ncovenants  (including  operational  and  corporate  financial  management  covenants)  for  the \nproject, which are set forth in the legal agreements. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n29. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$115,000,000  to  Ceylon  Electricity  Board,  to  be  guaranteed  by  the  Democratic  Socialist \nRepublic of Sri Lanka, for the Supporting Electricity Supply Reliability Improvement Project, from \nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 25 years, including a \ngrace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft loan and guarantee agreements presented to the Board. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n29 June 2016 \n                                                \n25 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fImpact the Project is Aligned with \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nAccess to clean, reliable, and affordable power supply in Sri Lanka increased by 2020 (National Energy \nPolicy and Strategies of Sri Lanka)a \n\n \nPerformance Indicators with \nTargets and Baselines \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \nMechanisms \n\n \n \nRisks \n\n \n\n \n \nResults Chain \nOutcome \nElectricity supply, \nand distribution \nsystem efficiency \nand reliability \nenhanced \n\nOutputs \n1.
