To meet its goal of halving the \nincome poverty level by 2015 will require more than doubling \nthe  rate  of  poverty  reduction  from  the  1.5%  per  year \nexperienced during the 1990s. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s \npriority is to accelerate and expand the scope for pro-poor \neconomic  growth  by  raising  the  rate  of  economic  growth \nquickly  and  sustainably,  with  an  emphasis  on  generating \nproductive employment. The promotion and development of \nsmall and medium enterprises (SMEs) will take center stage \nfor  raising  pro-poor  economic  growth  that,  being  generally \nlabor intensive, utilizes Bangladesh\u2019s factor endowments to \ntheir competitive advantage in the local and global markets. \n \nRecent  analysis  confirms  the  important  role  that  the  SME \nsector plays in reducing poverty  in Bangladesh. The more \nrapid  growth  of  the  economy  in  the  1990s  has  been \naccompanied by a faster rate of poverty reduction than in the \n1980s. Significantly, this growth can be traced to nontradable \nactivities (services, construction, and small-scale industry) that \naccounted for about 70% of the incremental growth of the past \ndecade relative to the earlier decade. Unlike the 1980s, when \nthe  rapid  shift  of  labor  into  the  rural  nonfarm  sector  was \nlargely in the form of self-employment, the 1990s reflected the \nabsorption of wage labor in greater numbers by enterprises \nthat were relatively larger scale and more productive. It is, \nthus, of critical importance to the poverty reduction effort to \nbuild on this growth momentum by developing an enabling \nenvironment conducive to the accelerated growth of the SME \nsector over the medium to long term and to adopt policies that \nenable the poor to find gainful employment in this sector. \n ", "ii  \nSMEs account for about 40% of gross manufacturing output, \nabout 80% of industrial employment, and about 25% of the \ntotal labor force in Bangladesh. However, they have not been \nable to realize their full potential due to various constraints: \n(i) dearth of medium to long-term credit; (ii) limited access to \nmarket opportunities, technology, expertise, and information, \nrelative to larger enterprises; (iii) lack of suitable incentives; \n(iv) inefficient and limited outreach of government services; \nand  (v) weak  capacity  among  SME  entrepreneurs  in \nmanaging functional areas of business.  \n \n  Recognizing the role of SMEs in economic development and \nthe fight against poverty, the Government formed a national \nTask  Force  to  recommend  SME  policy  guidelines  and \nimplementation  strategies,  provide  the  necessary \nunderpinnings for public support to the sector, and specify \ntargeted  assistance  and  a  dedicated  institutional  setup  for \nSME development. The SME Sector Development Program \n(SMESDP, the Program) supports the Government\u2019s initiative \nin  addressing  SME  constraints  and  providing  promotional \nsupport to facilitate their accelerated growth and development. \nSMESDP is fully consistent with the strategic priorities of the \nGovernment  and  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \ncountry  strategy,  and  is  supported  by  other  development \npartners.  SMESDP  also  complements  the  Government\u2019s \nagenda  of  developing  the  country\u2019s  private  sector  as  the \nengine of growth for the economy, and helps facilitate the flow \nof private investments into the SME sector in parallel with \nADB\u2019s  interventions  to  promote  good  governance  and  the \ndevelopment of the financial sector, particularly rural credit.  \n   \nObjectives   The  goal  of  SMESDP  is  to  support  government  efforts  to \nfoster development of the SME sector and enable the sector \nto  attain  its  full  potential  for  contributing  to  sustainable \neconomic growth and poverty reduction. SMESDP will support \nstrengthening the policy environment for SMEs, and improving \naccess by SMEs to credit and related support services. \n \nSMESDP  consists  of  four  parts:  (i) a  program  loan  of \nSDR9.954 million ($15 million equivalent) supporting policy \nreforms, (ii) a project loan of SDR19.908 million ($30 million \nequivalent)  for  extending  credit  to  small  enterprises,  (iii) a \ntechnical assistance (TA) loan of SDR3.318 million ($5 million \nequivalent)  for  improving  the  effectiveness  of  government \nassistance to the SME sector and facilitating SMEs\u2019 access to \nvarious  support  services  including  capacity  building  and \nsupport for infrastructure development for SMEs, and (iv) a TA \ngrant of $600,000 equivalent for assisting the Government to \nimplement  and  coordinate  the  Program  and  for  benefit \nmonitoring. \n ", "  iii\nProgram Loan   SMESDP supports three program outcomes. The first is to \n  establish  an  SME  policy  and  development  framework  to \nprovide  impetus  and  guidance  to  the  development  of  the \nsector. The second is to establish an institutional structure and \nnecessary  mechanisms  to  support  SME  development.  The \nthird is to define government support to SMEs and facilitate \nSME  access  to  various  services.  The  latter  entails \n(i) rationalization of government assistance to the SME sector, \nincluding credit directly administered by government agencies \nand public financial institutions; (ii) provision of tax incentives; \n(iii) enhancement  of  SME  access  to  market,  government \nservices, capacity building, and product certification, including \nupgrading  of  the  current  product  certification  system  to \ninternational standard; and (iv) development of an integrated \nSME database for improved targeting of assistance. \n \nCost Estimates   The costs of adjustment (excluding the project and TA costs) \nare  estimated  at  $33.4  million  equivalent  over  the  period \nFY2005\u2013FY2008,  reflecting  the  costs  for  development  and \nimplementation  of  the  SME  policy  and  development \nframework,  tax  incentives,  establishment  of  SME  support \ninfrastructure, and restructuring of concerned agencies under \nthe Ministry of Industries (MOI) providing services to SMEs. \n \nFinancing Plan  ADB will provide a program loan of SDR9.954 million ($15 \nmillion equivalent) from its Special Funds resources with a \nterm of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with \nan interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period \nand  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  The  loan  closing  date  is \nexpected to be 31 December 2007. \n \nTranching  The program loan will be released in two tranches subject to \ncompliance with agreed conditions. The first tranche, in the \namount  of  $5  million  equivalent,  will  be  released  upon \neffectiveness of the loan and fulfillment of the first tranche \nrelease  conditions.  The  second  tranche  of  $10  million \nequivalent is expected to be released by end-June 2007, upon \nfulfillment of the second tranche release conditions. \n \nImplementation  The executing agency (EA) for the program loan will be the \nArrangements  Ministry of Finance, Finance Division (MOF-FD). The EA will \nconstitute  a  central  program  coordination  unit  (CPCU)  in \ncharge  of  program  monitoring  and  coordination.  The \nimplementing agency (IA) for the program loan will be the \nMOI, except for the tax incentive measures, which MOF-FD \nwill coordinate with the National Board of Revenue. \n \nProcurement and  The program loan will finance the full foreign exchange costs \nDisbursement  (excluding local duties and taxes) of imports procured in and \nfrom ADB\u2019s member countries, other than those specified in \nthe list of ineligible items and those items financed by other ", "iv   \nmultilateral and bilateral official sources. Disbursements under \nthe program loan will be made in line with ADB\u2019s simplified \ndisbursement  procedures  and  audit  requirements.  The \nBorrower will certify that the value of eligible imports exceeds \nthe  amount  of  ADB\u2019s  projected  disbursements  under  the \nprogram loan in a given period. ADB will have the right to \naudit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of \nthe Borrower\u2019s certification. \n   \nProject Loan  The project loan will be provided to enhance access to credit \nby  SMEs,  especially  small  enterprises  referred  to  in \nBangladesh as the \u201cmissing middle.\u201d These enterprises are \ntoo large to qualify for microcredit assistance programs of the \nGovernment but too small to be within the scope of current \nbank lending. The loan proceeds will be used as contribution \nto the Small Enterprise Fund (SEF), which was set up by \nBangladesh Bank (BB) as a credit facility available to small \nenterprises with fixed assets of less than Tk10 million. The \nWorld Bank has also contributed to the SEF. SEF  will be \nadministered by BB for channeling credit through participating \nfinancial institutions (PFIs) to these small enterprises.  \n \nCost Estimates   The  total  project  cost  including  contribution  from  SME \nbeneficiaries  and  PFIs  is  estimated  at  $257.8  million \nequivalent,  while  the  fund  size  of  SEF  is  $56.7  million \nequivalent.  In  addition  to  the  project  loan  of  $30  million \nequivalent, SEF will comprise $10 million equivalent from the \nWorld Bank and $16.7 million equivalent (Tk1 billion) from the \nGovernment through BB. The Government can increase its \ncontribution to SEF if there is sufficient demand. The project \nloan will be provided in foreign exchange but re-lent by BB to \nPFIs in local currency at the BB rate. \n \nFinancing Plan  ADB will provide a project loan of SDR19.908 million ($30 \nmillion equivalent) from its Special Funds resources with a \nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with \nan interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period \nand 1.5% per annum thereafter. The commitment period for \nthe  project  loan  is  5  years  and  the  completion  date  is \nexpected to be 30 June 2010.  \n \nExecuting and  The EA for the project loan will be MOF-FD and the IA will be \nImplementing Agencies   BB. \n \nProcurement and  PFIs  will  onlend  the  funds  from  SEF  in  taka  as \nDisbursement  subloans/subleases  to  their  SME  clients  at  their  prevailing \npricing. Activities to be financed through subloans/subleases \nwill  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  procurement \nrequirements and environmental and other safeguard policies. \nAn  imprest  account  procedure  will  be  used  for  the \ndisbursement of the project loan.  ", "  v\nTechnical Assistance  ADB will provide a TA loan of SDR3.318 million ($5 million \nLoan  equivalent)  for  (i) the  conduct  of  studies  to  rationalize \ngovernment  assistance  to  the  SME  sector  including  the \nrestructuring, phaseout, or strategic reorientation of concerned \nagencies  under  MOI  providing  services  to  SMEs,  and  to \nreview and rationalize credit assistance directly administered \nby  government  agencies  and  public  financial  institutions; \n(ii) SME  web  portal/virtual  front  office  design  and \ndevelopment;  (iii) establishment  and  operation  of  helpline \noutreach  centers;  (iv) capacity  building  for  SME \nentrepreneurs,  particularly  in  rural  areas,  and  for  women \nentrepreneurs,  displaced  workers,  and  credit  staff  of  PFIs \ndealing  with  the  SME  sector;  (v) upgrading  of  the  product \ncertification  system;  (vi) integrated  SME  database \ndevelopment;  and  (vii) environmental  assessment  and \nmonitoring.  \n \nCost Estimate  The total TA loan project cost is estimated at $8.46 million \nequivalent, of which $5.00 million equivalent will be funded by \nADB. The Government will finance $1.84 million equivalent \nthrough budgetary support, and the remainder of the cost will \nbe  borne  by  the  private  business  sector  through  the \nFederation  of  Bangladesh  Chambers  of  Commerce  and \nIndustry  (FBCCI)  and  other  chamber  bodies  and  industry \nassociations, SMEs, and PFIs, by payment of fees and cost-\nsharing arrangements. \n \nFinancing Plan  ADB  will  provide  the  TA  loan  from  its  Special  Funds \nresources, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period of \n8 years, and with an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The TA loan \ncompletion date is expected to be 31 December 2007.  \n \nExecuting and  The EA for the TA loan will be MOF-FD and the IA will be \nImplementing Agencies   MOI. \n \nProcurement and  Procurement of goods and services will be in accordance with \nConsulting Services  ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. Supply contracts valued at \n  $100,000 equivalent or less may be procured based on local \nprocedures  under  the  Government\u2019s  Public  Procurement \nRegulations,  2003  and  acceptable  to  ADB.  All  consulting \nservices that are to be financed from the proceeds of the TA \nloan will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  for  the \nengagement of domestic consultants satisfactory to ADB. \n ", "vi   \nSafeguard Policies   As IA for the credit facility, BB will monitor compliance of PFIs \n  with ADB\u2019s Environmental Policy (2002) and Environmental \nAssessment  Guidelines,  and  ADB\u2019s  policies  on  involuntary \nresettlement (1995) and indigenous peoples (1998). PFIs in \nturn  will  monitor  compliance  by  subborrowers  with  ADB \npolicies and government regulations. \n \nTechnical Assistance  The  TA  grant  will  support  program  implementation  and \nGrant  coordination  to  ensure  timely  compliance  with  policy \n  conditions  and  other  deliverables  to  achieve  the  stated \noutcomes.  The  main  tasks  under  the  TA  are  to  assist  in \nsetting up and operationalizing the institutional body for SME \npolicy  and  development  framework  implementation, \nstrengthen  monitoring  and  reporting,  help  oversee  the \nimplementation  of  various  components  under  SMESDP  to \nenable timely corrective action if needed, build up capacity of \nthe EA and IAs in implementing the activities and monitoring \nbenefits of SMESDP, and provide administrative support to \nthe EA and IAs. The total cost of the TA is estimated to be \n$750,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $600,000 equivalent on \na  grant  basis  from  the  ADB-funded  TA  program.  The \nGovernment will contribute $150,000 equivalent. The TA will \nbe implemented over the implementation period of SMESDP. \nConsultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nfor the engagement of domestic consultants satisfactory to \nADB. \n \nExecuting and  The EA for the TA grant will be MOF-FD and the IA will be \nImplementing Agencies  MOI. \n   \nBenefits and Impact    \nPolicy   SMESDP is central to the formulation and implementation of \npublic policy that focuses on SME development. The SME \npolicy  and  development  framework  will  make  government \ncommitments to the sector explicit, and lay out targeted SME \npolicy  measures  and  institutional  structure  to  guide  the \nconcerned government agencies in providing support to the \nSME sector. The policy measures will rationalize government \nassistance  to  SMEs  and  facilitate  SME  access  to  credit, \nbusiness support services, product certification, and capacity \nbuilding. \n \nInstitutional Development   SMESDP will help mobilize high-level public policy support for \nSME development. At the highest level, the National Council \nfor  Industrial  Development  (NCID),  chaired  by  the  prime \nminister,  will  take  responsibility  for  SME  policy  and \ndevelopment. The NCID will be assisted at the ministerial level \nby the Guidance Committee headed by the minister, MOI. At \nthe implementation level, the SME Cell set up in MOI will ", "  vii\nimplement the action program to be developed by the SME \nAdvisory Panel to support implementation of the SME policy \nand development framework. Subsequently, over the medium \nterm, SMESDP will assist in establishing and operationalizing \nthe SME Foundation in the form of a public-private partnership \nto be a dedicated agency responsible for SME development \non  a  sustainable  basis.  Further,  the  Program  will  support \nstudies  for  improving  the  effectiveness,  restructuring,  and \nstrategic reorientation of concerned agencies under MOI that \ninterface with and provide services to SMEs. \n \nSME Financing   Small enterprises will have better access to credit through \nSEF. The Program will also enhance capabilities of PFIs in \nextending credit to SMEs by assisting PFIs in establishing or \nstrengthening  their  SME  financing  operations  and  training \nabout 1,000 SME credit staff of PFIs as well as other financial \ninstitutions intending to engage in lending to SMEs, on SME \nfinancing, project appraisal and supervision, and credit and \nportfolio  administration  of  small  loans.  Capacity  building  of \nSME credit staff will strengthen their abilities to assess SME \ncredit applications as well as facilitate provision of business \ndevelopment services (BDS) to SMEs. PFIs are expected to \nhave more focus on the SME business segment, strengthen \ntheir  SME  unit,  and  expand  their  SME  loan  portfolio.  PFI \nfinancial assistance will allow the SMEs to strengthen their \ncompetitiveness and to be commercially viable. It is estimated \nthat there will be about 10,000 subloans/subleases that will be \nmade out of SEF. In addition, lending to SMEs will have a \nstrong  linkage  impact  on  BDS  providers  who  would  be \nresponding to generated demand for their services and PFI \nreferrals. \n \n \nBeneficiaries  SMESDP will contribute to the country\u2019s goal of raising real \neconomic  growth,  generate  employment,  and  thereby \ncontribute to reducing poverty incidence. Overall, during the \nprogram  period  FY2005\u2013FY2007,  employment  in  the  SME \nsector is expected to rise by at least 8% per annum. \n \n  It is estimated that during the TA loan implementation period, \nover  8,000  participants  from  SMEs,  including  about  2,000 \nwomen, will undergo training to be conducted by the Small \nand Cottage Industries Training Institute in collaboration with \nFBCCI, and its district chambers and line associations. Over \n12,000 displaced workers are expected to undergo retraining \nprograms and at least 50% are projected to be re-employed \nduring  the  program  period.  It  is  also  expected  that  about \n150,000 entrepreneurs or individuals interested in setting up \nan  enterprise  will  take  advantage  of  the  services  of  the \nhelpline  outreach  centers  established  as  public-private \npartnerships  under  the  Program.  SMESDP  will  address ", "viii  \ngender  concerns  of  women  entrepreneurs  and \nbusinesswomen managing SMEs. SMESDP will enable them \nto have greater participation in the formulation of SME-related \npolices and action plans, and better access to information, \ncredit, and BDS. \n \nDevelopment Partner  SMESDP  complements  ongoing  and  planned  activities  of \nCoordination   other development partners, in particular as regards BDS and \nprivate sector development. The interventions under SMESDP \nwere closely coordinated with the Local Consultative Group \ncomposed  of  all  development  partners  active  in  the  SME \nsector in Bangladesh.  \n \nRisks and Safeguards  Drawing from past experience, despite possible changes in \nthe Government, it is presumed that Bangladesh will pursue \nthe  required  reforms,  based  on  high-level  government \ncommitment.  \n \n  The  program  implementation  risks  have  been  addressed \nthrough institutional mechanisms that involve all tiers in the \nGovernment, including the NCID at the top policy level, the \nGuidance  Committee  at  the  ministerial  level,  and  the \ndedicated  SME  Cell  (over  the  medium  term,  the  SME \nFoundation) at the implementation level. Direct oversight of \nspecific program, project, and TA components will be provided \nthrough the CPCU organized under the EA. The TA grant will \nprovide  capacity-building  assistance  to  strengthen  the \ncapabilities  of  counterpart  staff  to  implement  the  policy \nmeasures, and support the EA and IAs in terms of program \ncoordination  and  monitoring  activities,  as  well  as  PFIs  in \nmonitoring benefits from subloans/subleases financed under \nSEF. On the project loan, both ADB and World Bank staff \nbased  in  Dhaka  will  be  closely  involved  in  monitoring \nutilization of SEF and adherence to relevant policies, and take \ncorrective measures where needed. \n \n  The  Program  also  reduces  risk  and  institutes  checks  and \nbalances  through  the  use  of  participatory  consultation \nmechanisms and public-private partnerships. The SME policy \nand  development  framework  will  be  developed  through \nconsultation  and  participation  of  various  stakeholders  and \ninformation disseminated to the public through publication in \nnewspapers of nationwide circulation. The SME Foundation \nwill  have  private  sector  representatives  on  its  board.  The \nprivate sector through FBCCI, chambers, and associations will \nbe  involved  in  program  implementation  and  make  a \nsubstantial contribution to the total resources, in addition to \ntheir business network, practical knowledge and skills, and \nlinkages to sources of market information and technology.  ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Sector \nDevelopment Program (SMESDP, the Program) consisting of (i) a program loan supporting \npolicy reforms; (ii) a project loan for extending credit to small enterprises; and (iii) a technical \nassistance (TA) loan for improving the effectiveness of government assistance for the small and \nmedium enterprise (SME) sector and facilitating SMEs\u2019 access to various support services, \nincluding capacity building and support of infrastructure development for SMEs. The report also \ndescribes  a  proposed  TA  for  Supporting  Program  Implementation  and  Coordination  of \nSMESDP, and if the Board approves the proposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated \nto me by the Board, will approve the proposed TA.  \n \nII.  THE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n \n1.  Macroeconomic Performance  \n \n2.  Bangladesh achieved a steady 5% growth rate of real gross domestic product (GDP) \nduring the 1990s, as compared with 4% in the 1980s. The growth of per capita real GDP \naccelerated from 1.7% per annum in the 1980s to 3.1% in the 1990s. The growth in the 1990s \nwas attributable to the reforms to move Bangladesh toward an open economy, such as making \nthe currency convertible on the current account, reducing import duties, removing controls on \nthe movements of foreign private capital, and introducing value-added tax. The Bangladesh \neconomy became more closely integrated with the global economy, with its trade doubling over \nthe 1990s to reach 31% of GDP by 2001. The industry and services sectors each contributed \nabout 41%, and agriculture about 18%, to incremental GDP growth in the 1990s compared with \nthe 1980s. Unlike the 1980s, when the rapid shift of labor into the rural nonfarm sector was \nlargely in the form of self-employment, the 1990s witnessed the absorption of wage labor in \ngreater numbers by relatively larger-scale enterprises. These enterprises were at the higher end \nof the productivity scale compared with the self-employed form of enterprises in the earlier \nyears.1 Reflecting higher economic growth and increased employment generation, the poverty \nrate declined from 59% to 50% between 1991 and 2000.  \n \n3.  The Government has progressively moved away from administered interest rates toward \nmarket-based rates. The disproportionately high interest rates offered by the National Savings \nCertificates2 that crowded out long-term borrowing by financial institutions (FIs) and private \nsector borrowers have been reduced toward closer alignment with comparable market rates. \nDespite  these  efforts, spreads  between  lending  and  deposit  rates  remain  high  due  to  the \nnonperforming loan (NPL) problem in the banking system, which is being addressed by the \nGovernment.  The  Government  is  also  developing  a  market  for  government  securities  and \nsignificantly reduced the withholding tax on income from securities and bonds.3 On the foreign \nexchange market, the taka was floated in May 2003 and the exchange rate is managed flexibly, \nwith interventions confined to countering disorderly conditions.  \n                                                 \n1   Osmani,  S.

To  maintain  macroeconomic  stability  and  implement  structural  reforms  that  will \ncontribute  to  improving  the  investment  climate,  promoting  economic  growth,  and  reducing \npoverty, the Government has prepared the National Strategy for Economic Growth, Poverty \nReduction, and Social Development, the Government\u2019s interim poverty reduction strategy paper \n(I-PRSP),  dated  March  2003,4  which  forms  the  basis  for  a  3-year  arrangement  with  the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) \noriginally approved for SDR347 million (about $505 million). The Government will have to \naccelerate economic growth to about 7% per year over the next decade to reduce poverty in \nhalf by 2015 in accordance with the Millennium Development Goals.5 In comparison, annual \nGDP growth was 5.3% in FY2003, 5.5% in FY 2004, and is projected at 5% for FY2005. The \nIMF PRGF target is 6% for FY2006\u2013FY2008. The IMF PRGF together with the Development \nSupport Credit I and II projects of the World Bank (WB) also provide policy support in the \nfinancial  sector,  including  preparation  for  privatization  of  and  management  support  for  the \nnationalized commercial banks (NCBs) and issuance of prudential regulations. In July 2004, \nIMF completed the second review of Bangladesh\u2019s economic performance under PRGF and \napproved a release of SDR49.5 million (about $72 million) as well as an augmentation of the \nPRGF,  amounting  to  SDR53.33  million  (about  $78  million),  for  the  Trade  Integration \nMechanism.6 \n \n2.  Business Environment and Private Sector Development \n \n5.  Despite higher economic growth during the 1990s, Bangladesh still lagged behind other \ncountries in the region such as India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Various studies carried out under \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) TA in 20027 and 2003,8 an investment climate assessment by \nthe WB,9 the 2003 National Private Sector Survey of Enterprises in Bangladesh (the 2003 \nPrivate  Sector  Survey),10  and  surveys  by  the  Federation  of  Bangladesh  Chambers  of \nCommerce  and  Industry  (FBCCI) have  identified  major  impediments  to  the  country\u2019s \ncompetitiveness  and  economic  growth,  including  inadequacies  in  infrastructure  facilities \n(particularly power, gas, and port facilities), corruption and \u201cinvisible\u201d costs, deficiencies in the \nlegal and regulatory framework, and lack of access to finance by businesses.  \n \n6.  Nevertheless,  the  Government  has  taken  several  policy  initiatives  to  improve  the \ninvestment  climate.  The  I-PRSP  recognizes  the  private  sector  as  the  engine  of  economic \ngrowth. The 1999 Industrial Policy eliminated restrictions on private sector participation in all \n                                                 \n4   The full poverty reduction strategy paper is currently being prepared; its completion is expected by end-2004. \n5   Poverty reduction targets are set at 35% in 2010 and 25% in 2015 with 2000 as the base year. \n6   The IMF Trade Integration Mechanism was introduced in April 2004 to assist member countries to meet balance of \npayments shortfalls that might result from multilateral trade liberalization. It is not a special lending facility, but \nrather a policy designed to make resources more predictably available under existing IMF facilities. \n7   \u201cStrategic Issues and Potential Response in the Enterprise Sector: Small and Medium Enterprise Development \nand Export Expansion,\u201d November 2002, a report under TA 3698 (ADB. 2002.

The foreign direct investment regime is also liberal, although the bulk of direct \ninvestment from abroad has been in the gas and power subsectors. With regard to trade reform, \nthe Government has introduced a three-tier tariff structure with the maximum rate having been \nreduced from 30% to 25%. The average tariff and the number of products subject to quantitative \nrestrictions have also been reduced. Import-licensing requirements have been streamlined. The \nGovernment has introduced export promotion measures and at the same time developed a \ncomprehensive plan to cope with the phaseout of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) at end-\n2004, which will adversely affect textiles and garments, the strategic exports of Bangladesh.  \n \n7.  Reforms  are  also  under  way  to  create  an  enabling  environment  for  private  sector \ndevelopment and development partners, including ADB, are providing continuing support for \ninfrastructure development.11 To tackle the issue of corruption and rent-seeking behavior of \npublic officials, the Government set up the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) under the ACC \nAct passed in February 2004. The WB\u2019s Development Support Credit I and II projects as well as \nthe ADB\u2019s ongoing TA12 provide support for the establishment of the ACC. In addition, the \nGovernment is promoting e-governance and introducing the use of computers and web sites in \nall ministries and sector corporations to enhance transparency and expedite administrative \nprocesses.  \n \n3.  Role and Characteristics of the Small and Medium Enterprise Sector \n \n8.  It is generally recognized that SMEs have a significant role in generating growth and \nemployment.  SMEs  account  for  about  40%  of  gross  manufacturing  output,  about  80%  of \nindustrial employment, and about 25% of the total labor force in Bangladesh. Preliminary figures \nbased on the 2001\u20132003 Census of Non-Farm Economic Activities (Urban and Rural) [the \nEconomic Census], which excludes agriculture, fisheries, and forestry, estimate the number of \npersons employed by SMEs at 1.72 million, which is about 45% of the total number employed in \nnonfarm small, medium, and large establishments. The 2003 Private Sector Survey estimated \nthat micro, small, and medium enterprises contributed around 20\u201325% of GDP. Given the \ncritical  role  of  SMEs  in  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  it  is  imperative  that  the \nGovernment develop and implement targeted policy measures to address specific constraints to \nSMEs to enable them to realize their full potential and contribute more effectively to economic \ngrowth and employment generation. \n \n9.  Definition of SMEs. The Industrial Policy 1999 defines SMEs as enterprises employing \nfewer  than  99  workers  and/or  with  a  fixed  capital  investment  under  Tk300  million.  \u201cSmall \nindustry\u201d refers to enterprises (excluding cottage units) employing fewer than 50 workers and/or \nwith  a  fixed  capital  investment  of  less  than  Tk100  million  while  \u201cmedium  industry\u201d  covers \nenterprises employing between 50 to 99 workers and/or with a fixed capital investment of \nbetween Tk100 million and Tk300 million. However, this definition has the second highest upper \nlimit on fixed assets for SMEs in South Asia and Southeast Asia, after Singapore, and does not \naccurately reflect the size of SMEs. The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) classifies \nenterprises solely according to total persons employed or \u201cengaged\u201d (including proprietor) in the \nEconomic Census. Development partners involved in the SME sector have different definitions \nof  SMEs.  The  major  commercial  banks  follow  the  Industrial  Policy  definition  in  terms  of \n                                                 \n11  ADB\u2019s projects include among others, construction of roads and transport infrastructure, development of the power \nand gas sector, and improvement in efficiency of Chittagong Port. \n12  ADB. 2003.

The TA is progressing well and the Government has requested ADB\u2019s assistance in the \ndevelopment of an implementation plan for the ACC. ", "4  \ninvestment capital for lending purposes. The lack of any single standard definition makes it \ndifficult to interpret data on SMEs and target assistance for SME sector development. \n \n10.  Population of SMEs. There are varying estimates of the SME population in line with \ndifferent definitions of SMEs. Based on the Economic Census, the total number of SMEs13 is \nestimated at 79,754 establishments, of which 93.6% are small and 6.4% are medium. The 2003 \nPrivate Sector Survey estimated about 6 million micro, small, and medium enterprises defined \nas enterprises with fewer than 100 employees.  \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n \n11.  Most  of  the  key  impediments  to  the  development  of  the  SME  sector  are  linked  to \nstructural problems in the business environment. ADB and other development partners are \naddressing issues in private sector and financial sector development. While these problems \naffect all enterprises irrespective of size, SMEs are disproportionately affected due to their small \nscale of operations and more limited resources to address the problems. Complementary to the \ngovernment initiatives and other development partner programs, the proposed SMESDP aims at \nintroducing policy reforms and creating support infrastructure targeted at SMEs to enhance their \ncapabilities and facilitate their access to the necessary resources to deal with the regulatory, \ncredit, capacity, and other key issues that they are facing owing to policy and market failures. \nSector analysis and framework for SME development, including government initiatives and \ndevelopment  agency-funded  programs,  are  summarized  below  with  details  included  in \nAppendix 3. \n \n1.  Present Challenges for Small and Medium Enterprises \n \n  a.  Access to Credit \n \n12.  Lack of SME Access to Credit. Financial constraint was cited most frequently as a key \nproblem during startup and operations as reflected in the 2003 Private Sector Survey. Problems \nare more pronounced for small enterprises predominantly in the informal sector that are in the \nso-called \u201cmissing middle.\u201d These enterprises, some of which have graduated from microcredit \nprograms,  are  no  longer  considered  microenterprises  and  are  ineligible  for  financing  from \nnongovernment  organizations  and  microcredit  institutions  or  from  government  special \nassistance programs. On the other hand, they are not large enough to fall within the scope of \ncurrent bank lending. Banks view SMEs as relatively higher credit risks, and expected returns \ndo not justify the high administrative and servicing costs of small loans. SMEs are normally \nrequired to assign real or other immovable properties as collateral to secure their obligation, a \ncondition  that  most  SMEs  find  difficult  to  comply  with.  Further,  lack  of  suitable  lending \nmodalities, and limited capability of SME credit staff to appraise SMEs\u2019 cash-flow-generating \ncapacity is another reason for the predominance of collateral-based lending.  \n \n13.  Secured Financing. Lack of ownership of land or immovable property as collateral for \nbank  financing  poses a  constraint  to  SME  access  to credit.  Secured  financing  backed  by \nmovable property (e.g., equipment, vehicles, and other non-land assets) as security would \ngenerally be preferred by SMEs, as they typically own movable property. However, the secured \nfinancing sector in Bangladesh covering leasing companies is quite small with limited growth \npotential due to lack of a legal and institutional framework for secured transactions. Currently, \n                                                 \n13  In the Economic Census, microenterprises are defined as those with total number of persons employed of less \nthan 10, small enterprises with 10 to 49, medium enterprises with 50 to 99, and large enterprises with 100 or more. ", "  5\nthere is no law specifically providing for taking movable property as security for a loan. Security \ninterests in movable property are created by contract, creating unnecessary litigation and delay. \nThe current law does not provide for priority of creditor interests; thus, loan recovery typically \ninvolves long and costly litigation to determine interests of creditors. Moreover, there is no \ncomprehensive registry system in Bangladesh. Not all security interests can be registered, \nposing a limitation on secured lending. Coverage of the current registry system at the Registrar \nof  Joint  Stock  Companies  (RJSC),  restricted to  limited companies, excludes  from  secured \nfinancing  SMEs  that  are  not  in  corporate  form,  although  these  constitute  the  majority  of \nenterprises.  The  manual  registration  system  results  in  excessive  delay  and  creates \nopportunities for corrupt practices. \n \n14.  Market Failures in SME Financing. In the absence of a long-term market for debt \nfunds, availability of medium- to long-term credit is limited. Although there is excess liquidity in \nthe market, a significant portion is lodged with NCBs that are facing chronic NPL problems and \nhave been restricted by Bangladesh Bank (BB) to limit their credit portfolio growth to 5% \nannually in order to contain their losses. In the absence of an effective interbank market, this \nexcess liquidity in NCBs does not readily flow to the private commercial banks (PCBs) or \nnonbank financial institutions (NBFIs). Moreover, NBFIs are limited in their scope for accepting \ndeposits while PCBs and leasing companies have limited term funds due to an inability to \nengage in asset/liability mismatches by using short-term deposits for medium- to long-term \nlending in the absence of liquidity support from BB and without a repo market. In addition, cash \nreserves are required to be met on a daily basis while the inefficient payments system makes \nmonitoring and adjusting liquidity positions highly cumbersome and difficult. Furthermore, even \nif many NBFIs are keen to engage in SME financing, loans from NCBs are available at rates \nthat, owing to the high NPL level, make SME financing unprofitable or marginally profitable. \nTheir relatively high costs of capital limit the expansion of their SME loan portfolio.  \n \nb.  Need  to  Rationalize  Present  Government  Support  for  Small  and \nMedium Enterprises \n \n15.  Although SME development has been included in the Industrial Policy, there are neither \nsignificant specific policy measures nor specific institutional support to establish an enabling \nframework  at  a  policy  level,  resulting  in  costly  and  inefficient  implementation  of  SME \ndevelopment initiatives. SMEs are typically in a disadvantaged position to benefit from neutral \nbusiness-friendly policies compared with large enterprises. Targeted policy interventions are \nnecessary to improve access of SMEs to market opportunities, financing, technology, expertise, \nand information. There is also an evident need to create an institutional mechanism that can \neffectively coordinate and implement SME-related policies.    \n \n16.  The Government provides business support and capacity-building assistance as well as \ninfrastructure facilities to SMEs, mainly through the Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries \nCorporation (BSCIC). Founded in 1957 by legislation as the principal government organization \nmandated to promote the development of countrywide small and cottage industries (SCIs), \nBSCIC  is  responsible  for  (i) allotment  of  developed  industrial  estates  in  64  districts  in \nBangladesh; (ii) entrepreneurship development training programs conducted by its training arm, \nSmall and Cottage Industries Training Institute (SCITI); (iii) credit arrangement and end-use \nsupervision; (iv) design, development, and distribution of prototypes through its design center; \n(v) research  and  development  activities;  (vi) management  and  skills  development;  and \n(vii) market study and marketing assistance (e.g., trade fairs).  \n ", "6  \n17.  However, BSCIC has failed to fulfill its mandate due mainly to lack of a clear focus, \nburden of managing many nonperforming industrial estates, weak management deputed from \nthe  civil service  system  with  lack of  understanding  of  SMEs,  and  shortage  of well-trained \nprofessionals. Currently, there is no cost recovery in the use of public resources in the estates \nor in almost all of the services provided by BSCIC, while training participants pay only a nominal \nfee for its training programs. BSCIC is overstaffed with 3,244 people. In FY2004, the revenue \nbudget of BSCIC was Tk248 million. Low revenues coupled with high operating costs have \nresulted in substantial accumulated operating losses of Tk660 million or about $10.1 million over \nthe past 10 years. A parliamentary subcommittee was formed to address the issue of operating \nlosses while the Ministry of Industries (MOI) has set up a committee to study human resource \nrestructuring at BSCIC. To move BSCIC toward a leaner and more effective organization, the \ncommittee proposed human resource rationalization, including downsizing field offices and the \nhead office.  \n \n18.  Since its establishment in 1985, SCITI has conducted training courses for over 24,000 \nparticipants, mostly existing and potential entrepreneurs and managers of SCI enterprises. \nHowever, SCITI has very limited outreach with more than two thirds of its training programs \nconducted at its premises in Dhaka. Although SCITI has carried out training programs in other \nparts of the country in collaboration with BSCIC\u2019s respective local offices and industrial service \ncenters, the implementation of these programs was ineffective due to a meager budget, lack of \nqualified  faculty  members  and  trainers,  and  lack  of  training  facilities.  There  is  a  need  to \nstrengthen SCITI\u2019s capacity to deliver its training services to SMEs  on a sustained basis. \n(Profiles  of  BSCIC  and  other  public  institutions  serving  SMEs  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix 6.) \n \n19.  Public institutions including BB, NCBs, and specialized financial institutions, engaged in \nextending loans to the agriculture and industry sectors, currently have financing facilities for \nSMEs, the performance and effectiveness of which have been uneven. These facilities have \nvarying  features  and  terms.  Some  are  targeted  at  certain  industries  or  subject  to  limited \ngeographic  coverage.  BB\u2019s  Rural-based  Agro-Processing  Industries  Refinancing  Facility, \noriginally set up for Tk1.5 billion, had a low utilization rate owing mainly to the restriction on use \nof funds to agro-processing industries located outside the major cities; consequently, the size of \nthe facility was later reduced to Tk0.5 billion and Tk1 billion was reallocated to set up the Small \nEnterprise Fund (SEF). The Entrepreneurship Enterprise Fund was set up by BB in FY2001 as a \nventure  capital  fund  to  co-invest  in  projects  in  software,  food  processing,  and agro-based \nindustries. Since its establishment, the utilization rate has averaged about one fourth of the \nbudget allocated in each fiscal year. The Government is exploring an exit strategy for its equity \nshareholding in the enterprises cofinanced under the Entrepreneurship Enterprise Fund. Some \ncredit facilities provided by NCBs and specialized financial institutions impose ceiling on loans to \nsubborrowers in certain sectors, such as agricultural credit, thus distorting interest rates and \nfurther exacerbating the vulnerable financial position of these entities. There is no indicator to \nmeasure the effectiveness, outreach, or impact of these facilities. Thus, a study needs to be \nconducted to identify ways to rationalize the existing government assistance and to ensure \nefficient and effective delivery mechanisms. \n \nc.  Incentives \n \n20.  The tax system in Bangladesh provides incentives to promote exports. For example, a \nspecial income tax rate of 10% is provided for the readymade garment (RMG) industry and 15% \nfor textile and jute industries up to June 2006, compared with a normal rate of 37.5%. With the ", "  7\nexception of very small enterprises classified as \u201ccottage industries,\u201d14 which are exempted from \nvalue-added tax on an extensive list of items, no special tax treatment is given to SMEs. To \nrelieve the tax burden of newly established enterprises, the Government has provided tax \nholidays for all manufacturing or service enterprises, irrespective of size, if they are established \nbefore June 2005. These enterprises can register with the National Board of Revenue (NBR) to \nbe exempted from income tax for 5 years if they are located in major cities such as Dhaka and \nChittagong and for 7 years for those located in other cities. The abolition of the tax holiday \nscheme, which is expected to be approved by the Government in the next fiscal year, will \nadversely affect small enterprises to a greater extent than larger enterprises because of their \nlimited income-generating capacity to absorb high startup costs. Tax and customs procedures \nare also cumbersome and involve high informal payments, reflecting additional compliance \ncosts and posing a barrier for SME entry into the formal sector.  \n \nd.  Registration, Licensing, Tax, and Other Requirements  \n \n21.  The  establishment  of  an  enterprise  in  general  requires  a  trade  license  from  local \ngovernment bodies, registration under the Factories Act with the Department of Inspection of \nFactories and Establishments of the Ministry of Labor, registration for value-added tax and a tax \nidentification  number  with  NBR,  and  environmental  clearance  from  the  Department  of \nEnvironment of the Ministry of Environment and Forest. Compliance complexity increases as \nthe business becomes a legal entity and seeks registration for access to government incentives. \nIf  an  enterprise  is  to  be  incorporated  as  a  company,  registration  with  RJSC  is  required. \nInvestment registration with the Board of Investments will be required for access to capital \nmachinery import incentives in the form of import duty and tax exemptions, and to infrastructure \nfacilities such as utility (water, electricity, and telecommunications) and land (e.g., industrial \nestates managed by BSCIC or Bangladesh Export Processing Zone Authority). The processes \nto  meet  these  requirements  usually  involve  unnecessary  delays,  harassment,  and  side \npayments. The information gap has been identified as the key constraint in obtaining certificates \nor  licenses  from  any  of  these  regulatory  agencies.  Awareness  and  understanding  of \ndocumentation requirements, steps to be followed, and fees to be paid will help entrepreneurs \nto be prepared and make it more difficult for officials or brokers to take advantage of the \nentrepreneurs\u2019 lack of knowledge. The delays in the processes are also caused by manual \nsystems at many of these public service institutions and duplication of procedures.  \n  \ne.  Market for Business Development Services \n \n22.  SMEs  operating  outside  the  urban  centers  do  not  have  ready  access  to  business \ndevelopment services (BDS) providers. BDS are generally regarded as unaffordable by this \nsubsector.  The  BDS  market  is  still  fragmented  and  unorganized  with  few  privately  owned \norganizations  providing  BDS.  Some  started  as  projects  funded  by  development  partners.15 \nMany of the training and capacity-building programs are neither demand-driven nor specifically \ntargeted at certain groups of SMEs that are disadvantaged, such as those in rural areas and \nthose headed by women entrepreneurs. Moreover, retraining programs are also needed for the \ndisplaced RMG workers due to the phaseout of the MFA by end-2004. It is estimated that at \n                                                 \n14 Cottage industries in this context are defined by the NBR as enterprises that have (i) investments in capital \nmachinery of less than Tk500,000, (ii) annual turnover of less than Tk2 million, and (iii) no production in the name \nof any brand belonging to others.  \n15  These  include  Micro  Industries  Development  Assistance  and  Services  (MIDAS),  the  Bangladesh  Advisory \nServices Center funded by USAID, and the Business Advisory Services training center at the Dhaka Chamber of \nCommerce and Industry supported by the German Agency for Technical Cooperation with funding from the \nGerman Government. ", "8  \nleast 200,000 RMG workers, over 85% of whom are women, need retraining to be able to \nreenter the gainfully employed labor pool. Further, Bangladesh needs to diversify its know-how \nand technology away from core garment industries to lessen external shocks and better equip \nthe country to cope with the changing market environment.  \n \n23.  Some FIs provide basic advisory services to their clients, or make BDS arrangements \nwith service providers to assist enterprises that they finance.16 Generic training courses on \ncredit management and core banking and on finance subjects are conducted at the training \ncenter of BB and the Bangladesh Institute of Bank Management. However, to extend FIs\u2019 \nlending to the SME sector, there is a need to build up capacity of SME credit staff to provide in-\nhouse basic advisory services and \u201chandholding\u201d assistance to SMEs, including preparation of \nbusiness plan and bankable proposals.  \n \nf.  Product Certification System \n \n24.  The Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution (BSTI), an autonomous organization \nunder  MOI,  is  responsible  for  setting  national  standards  for  industrial,  food,  and  chemical \nproducts; conducting product testing; and issuing product certification. BSTI\u2019s certification mark \nis  mandatory  for  an  extensive  list  of  items  to  assure  quality  of  products  and  to  protect \nconsumers. There is no accreditation system to allow for services of private sector accreditation \nbodies. BSTI\u2019s monopoly and lengthy procedures led to the practice of side payments to obtain \ncertificates. Thus, BSTI\u2019s seal of quality has not gained credibility either at home or abroad, \nimpeding the ability of exporters to market their products. To meet importers\u2019 requirements, \nenterprises have to go through expensive and time-consuming processes to seek certificates \nfrom  foreign  certification  bodies.  Many  SMEs  do  not  comply  with  product  certification \nrequirements due to their ignorance and weak enforcement capacity of BSTI. This limits their \npotential to broaden their client base to overseas markets.  \n \n2.  Government  Policy  Support  for  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Sector \nDevelopment  \n \n25.  Industrial Policy. The promotion of pro-poor growth propelled by the private sector as \nstated under the I-PRSP will have to be supported by appropriate macroeconomic and sector \npolicies. The new Industrial Policy, in its final draft form, covers (i) roles of MOI and other \nrelevant agencies including BSCIC, Board of Investments, and Bangladesh Export Processing \nZone Authority, in promoting the development of industries, particularly those with strong growth \npotential; (ii) promotion of exports and foreign direct investment; and (iii) privatization of state-\nowned enterprises. With renewed interest in SME development, it now highlights the priority \ngiven to the development of the SME sector, and, drawing upon the recommendations of the \nnational Task Force on Development of SMEs [the SME Task Force] (para. 27), outlines the \nGovernment\u2019s development strategy for the SME sector. Key elements of the strategy cover, \namong  other  things,  (i) strengthening  the  role  of  public  agencies  to  ensure  proper \nindustrialization  of  SMEs;  (ii) providing  tax  incentives  to  SMEs;  (iii) simplifying  laws  and \nregulations; (iv) using e-commerce to develop production and marketing; (v) establishing an \ninformation bank to provide market opportunities and trade information; (vi) improving supply \nchain management to foster subcontracting and linkages between SMEs and larger enterprises; \n                                                 \n16  BRAC Bank, a PCB, has its own field staff trained to provide advice to its borrowers on basic business plan \ndevelopment and has a partnership with the Job Opportunities and Business Support program of USAID for \nprovision of BDS, while MIDAS Financing, an NBFI, taps the resources of its parent company, MIDAS, for delivery \nof BDS. ", "  9\nand (vii) conducting a survey to analyze and identify industries with growth potential. The new \nIndustrial Policy does not provide details for this SME development strategy but refers instead to \nthe SME policy and development framework. However, the revised definition of SMEs has been \nincorporated. According to this definition, to be made generally applicable, (i) for manufacturing, \nsmall enterprises are those with fixed investment less than or equal to Tk15 million and medium \nenterprises with fixed investment greater than Tk15 million and less than or equal to Tk100 \nmillion,17 while (ii) for nonmanufacturing, small enterprises are those with fewer than 25 full-time \nemployees, and medium enterprises with between 25 and 100 full-time employees.  \n \n26.  Preparation of SME Policy and Development Framework. There is global consensus \nrecognizing the role of SMEs as engines for growth, employment, and poverty reduction, and \nthe need to design SME policies in the context of a coherent and integrated approach to \neconomic growth and social development.18 SME development requires a crosscutting strategy \nthat touches on such areas as macroeconomic policies, business environment, legal framework, \nand finance, and that is integrated into the broader national development and poverty reduction \nstrategy. \n \n27.  In line with such a consensus and to prioritize specific elements of SME policies from the \nBangladesh perspective, the Government established the SME Task Force on 5 November \n2003. The SME Task Force\u2014comprising 16 members from the Government, academia, and the \nprivate sector, and chaired by the principal secretary, Prime Minister\u2019s Office\u2014held a national \nworkshop on 20 February 2004 and prepared the Report on Development of SMEs.19  The \nReport, endorsed by the prime minister and submitted to the Economic Affairs Committee of the \nCabinet  in  October  2004,  contains  policy  recommendations  with  timeframe  to  create  an \nenabling environment conducive to SME development. Key components are declaration of \nSMEs as a priority sector, an institutional framework, various incentives, and capacity building \nand human resource development measures. These recommendations will form the basis for \nframing the Government\u2019s policy vis-\u00e0-vis the SME sector, which will be completed in 2005 and \nimplemented by an action program (paras. 39\u201340). \n \n3.  Development  Agency-Funded  Programs  that  Impact  on  the  Small  and \nMedium Enterprise Sector \n \na.   Financial Market Development \n \n28.  Reforms in the Banking Sector. The ongoing reforms will help address market failures \nin SME financing. The restructuring of NCBs has been initiated and will be supported by the \nWB\u2019s Enterprise Growth and Bank Modernization (EGBM) project, which will assist in preparing \nstrategies for resolution of problems of NCBs, improve governance arrangements, and divest \nthe Government\u2019s shares in the NCBs. Amendments of relevant laws have been made to \nstrengthen BB\u2019s oversight of the banking sector and ensure its autonomy over monetary and \n                                                 \n17  Fixed capital assets, valued at replacement cost based on current market prices, include plant, machinery, \nbuilding, and structures. Land is excluded primarily because in Bangladesh, land values in urban areas are \ndisproportionately high relative to the other productive assets of enterprises and distort their balance sheet. \n18  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). 2000.

ADB and other development partners participated and provided comments on the draft \nreport. ", "10  \nexchange rate policies. Stricter prudential regulations have been introduced, including increased \ncapital adequacy requirements and revisions to loan classification and provisioning guidelines.  \n \n29.  Development of Capital Market. ADB has provided assistance to strengthen the legal \nand regulatory framework as well as oversight of the securities markets. It has also been closely \ninvolved in reforming the Bangladesh domestic capital market and in enhancing the role of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission as a regulator.20 Further, the WB\u2019s Financial Institutions \nDevelopment project, which includes a component to facilitate FIs\u2019 issuance of securities and \nsecuritization of their loan/lease portfolios, has achieved some progress.21 \n \n30.  Secured Financing. To support secured financing as part of good governance initiatives \nas well as SME development, ADB is providing assistance for legal and registry reforms to \nfacilitate secured transactions. 22 The draft secured transaction law is being prepared and has \nbeen discussed among stakeholders, while the registry reform will cover development of an \noverall architecture for a transparent, electronic registration system. \n \n31.  Financial Reporting. The Government has acknowledged that in the long term it has to \nimplement recommendations identified in the Report on the Observance of Standards and \nCodes23 including simplification of financial reporting standards for SMEs. WB is providing \nassistance in strengthening accounting and auditing practices in the corporate sector under an \neconomic management TA program. \n \nb.  Registration, Licensing, and Tax Requirements \n \n32.  To facilitate issuance of trade license in Dhaka, Dhaka City Corporation set up a help \ndesk at FBCCI and has been working toward developing a simple form of application with fewer \ncertifications required for issuing a trade license. It has introduced automatic annual renewal of \ntrade license up to 5 years through payment in designated banks. The automation project of \nRJSC is ongoing and supported by the Australian Agency for International Development and \nSouthAsia Enterprise Development Facility (SEDF).24 Further, SEDF also assisted RJSC in \npreparing a registration toolkit and an animated television film on how to register a business, \nand established knowledge centers in Dhaka and Chittagong chambers of commerce and \nindustry, which maintain a library of SME information and resources including SME toolkits \noffering  business  software.

Business Development Services and Training \n \n33.  Under the EGBM project approved in June 2004, WB will provide training on automation \napplications  to  BSCIC  and  training  of  trainers  to  SCITI.25  SEDF  provides  (i) local  service \nproviders and training institutions with the tools and training to develop their capacity to provide \nBDS, and (ii) SME entrepreneurs and staff with training programs in target subsectors, i.e., \ngarments, agribusiness, information technology, software, and light engineering.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n \n34.  The objective of SMESDP is to support government efforts to foster development of the \nSME sector by strengthening the policy environment for SMEs and improving SMEs\u2019 access to \ncredit and related services. This will enable the sector to attain its full potential for contributing to \nsustainable economic growth and, through generation of employment, the reduction in poverty.  \n \n35.  SMESDP consists of: (i) a program loan of SDR9.954 million ($15 million equivalent) \nsupporting policy reforms; (ii) a project loan of SDR19.908 million ($30 million equivalent) for \nextending credit to small enterprises; (iii) a TA loan of SDR3.318 million ($5 million equivalent) \nfor improving the effectiveness of government assistance to the SME sector and facilitating \nSMEs\u2019  access  to  various  support  services  including  capacity  building  and  support  for \ninfrastructure development for SMEs; and (iv) a TA grant of $600,000 equivalent for assisting \nthe Government to implement and coordinate the Program and for benefit monitoring. The \nprogram framework is in Appendix 1. The development policy letter and the policy matrix are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nB.  Important Features \n \n36.  Rationale  for  Sector  Development  Program  Modality.  The  sector  development \nprogram modality will enable ADB to apply a holistic approach to SME development. Due to \nmarket failures, targeted policy interventions are necessary to create an enabling environment \nfor SME development. The SMESDP policy actions will represent the key and core measures \nunder  the  SME  policy  and  development  framework  that  will  provide  justification  for  the \ngovernment interventions in the sector and help relevant agencies focus on SME development \nin an integrated fashion as opposed to past ad hoc interventions. Moreover, the program loan \ncomponent will provide budgetary support for the establishment of an institutional framework \ndedicated to SME development on a sustainable basis and support infrastructure to facilitate \nSME  access  to  market  opportunities,  technology,  business  support  services,  government \n                                                 \n25  In addition, the EGBM project also covers additional facilities to modernize BSCIC\u2019s design center and institutional \ncapacity building of the Board of Investments and Bangladesh Export Processing Zone Authority. ", "12  \nservices, and capacity building. The project loan that provides funds for SEF will improve SME \naccess  to  credit  and  will  be  complementary  to  the  ongoing  projects  of  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment partners in the financial sector. The TA loan will support implementation of policy \nactions, and help carry out the needed assessments, capacity building, and development of \ninfrastructure for SMEs. \n \n37.  Complementarities  to  Government  Initiatives  and  Development  Agency \nInterventions.  SMESDP  underpins  the  Government\u2019s  agenda  of  developing  the  country\u2019s \nprivate sector, particularly the SME sector, which is accorded high priority to serve as the \nengine of pro-poor economic growth. The interventions under SMESDP will be targeted at \nremoving obstacles to SME growth and facilitating the flow of private investments into the SME \nsector  and  will  complement  existing  government  reform  measures  and  other  ADB  and \ndevelopment  agency  assistance  programs  in  private  and  financial  sector  development. \nMoreover, SMESDP is fully consistent with ADB\u2019s country strategy and is complementary to \nADB\u2019s  interventions  in  Bangladesh  in  rural  and  microfinance  and  in  financial  market \ndevelopment, which helps improve resource mobilization and access to credit by SMEs.  \n \nC.  The Program Loan \n \n1.  Components and Outputs \n \n38.  The Program is designed to have three policy outcomes:  \n(i)  Outcome 1:   Establish SME Policy and Development Framework \n(a)   Declare SMEs as a priority sector under government policy \n(b)  Formulate an SME policy and development strategy \n \n(ii)  Outcome 2:  Establish Institutional Structure and Mechanisms to Support SME \nDevelopment  \n(a)  Set up an institutional structure and mechanisms to implement the SME \npolicy and development framework \n(b)  Prepare an action program to support the SME development strategy \n \n(iii)   Outcome 3:   Define Government Support to SMEs, and Improve SME Access \nto Various Services  \n(a)  Rationalize  government  assistance  to  the  SME  sector  including  the \nrestructuring of BSCIC and other concerned agencies under MOI involved \nin the sector and rationalization of government direct credit assistance \ncurrently provided \n(b)  Rationalize incentive and tax structure for SMEs \n(c)  Enhance SME access to market and government services \n(d)  Enhance SME access to capacity building \n(e)  Enhance  SME  access  to  product  certification  and  upgrade  product \ncertification system to international standard \n(f)  Develop an integrated SME database \n \n \na.  Establish SME Policy and Development Framework \n \n39.  Drawing upon the work of the SME Task Force, the Government will, as part of the \nProgram, formulate an appropriate SME policy and development framework in consultation with ", "  13\nvarious stakeholders including SMEs and development partners. The Government will adopt the \nSME policy and development framework that will, in particular, (i) provide the justification for \ngovernment  assistance  to  the  sector;  (ii) map  out  a  government  development  strategy  to \nsupport the SME sector over the short, medium, and long term; (iii) adopt a single uniform \ndefinition of SMEs; (iv) identify areas of assistance to SMEs to enhance their access to capital, \nbusiness  support  services,  capacity  building,  and  technology  to  improve  their  product \nmarketability and competitiveness; (v) delineate the institutional setup to take responsibility for \nSME sector development; and (vi) incorporate internationally accepted market-based principles \nfor  SME  development.  Summary  of  the  SME  policy  and  development  framework  will  be \ndisseminated to the public through publication in newspapers of nationwide circulation. Further, \nthe development of the SME sector as a priority will be stated in the Industrial Policy and the \nPoverty Reduction Strategy Paper.  \n \nb.  Establish Institutional Structure and Mechanisms to Support SME \nDevelopment \n \n40.  The National Council for Industrial Development (NCID), which is chaired by the prime \nminister and charged with making policy decisions under the umbrella of the Industrial Policy, \nwill take responsibility for SME development. The Government will constitute an SME Advisory \nPanel mandated to develop an action program to support the SME development strategy. The \nPanel  will  consist  of  representatives  from  MOI  and  other  concerned  ministries,  industry \nassociations, and representatives from the private sector and academia, and report to the \nGuidance Committee,26 set up under the Industrial Policy and chaired by the Minister, MOI. MOI \nwill  be  the  designated  agency  for  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  SME  development \nstrategy and has set up an SME Cell to facilitate operationalization. Over the medium term, the \nGovernment will draft and approve the memorandum and articles of association that will provide \nthe organizational and operational framework for setting up an SME Foundation, which will have \nat least 50% private sector representation on the board and a chief executive officer recruited \nfrom the private sector, to assume the responsibilities for implementing the SME development \nstrategy  and  action  program  from  the  SME  Cell  and  to  take  over,  in  a  phased  manner, \nmanagement of SME credit facilities currently directly administered by the Government.  \n \nc.  Define Government Support to SMEs, and Improve SME Access to \nVarious Services \n \n41.  Rationalize Government Assistance to the SME Sector including the Restructuring \nof  BSCIC  and  Other  Concerned  Agencies  under  MOI  involved  in  the  sector  and \nRationalization  of  Government  Direct  Credit  Assistance  Currently  Provided.  The \nGovernment will review the effectiveness of existing government assistance to the SME sector \nand  the  efficiency  of  delivery  of  such  assistance  covering  various  public  sector  agencies, \nparticularly those under the supervision of MOI including BSCIC, SCITI, and BSTI, as well as \nvarious forms of credit assistance now being provided to the sector. The study will undertake \ndetailed diagnostic analysis of the selected agencies\u2019 activities in terms of need, coverage and \nscale, impact, cost-effectiveness and sustainability, identification of restructuring alternatives, \nand preparation of a restructuring plan or a phaseout plan, depending on the study\u2019s findings. \n \n                                                 \n26  The Guidance Committee has 22 members including the Minister of Industries as chairperson; chairman, Board of \nInvestments; governor, BB; secretary, MOI; secretary, Finance Division, MOF; secretaries of other ministries; \nchairman, BSCIC; representatives of other agencies; and presidents, FBCCI, Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce \nand Industry, and the major district chambers of commerce and industry. ", "14  \n42.  It is envisaged that BSCIC, SCITI, and BSTI will be restructured, or replaced by more \nresponsive institutions. In any event, restructuring or setting up an alternative institution is to be \nguided by (i) a strengthened governance structure that will introduce public-private partnership \nwith  private  sector  representation  on  the  board  of  the  organization;  (ii) recruitment  of \nprofessionals from the private sector, particularly for key positions; (iii) commercialization of the \noperations  by  charging  fees  at  least  for  cost  recovery;  (iv) a  strengthened  performance \nevaluation and incentive system; (v) drawing up of a strategic plan with a time-bound road map \nfor each product or service group, e.g., market-oriented development and management of \nindustrial estates and parks, customer-responsive training, and capacity-building services to \nSMEs; and (vi) strengthened transparency and accountability, based on defined performance \nindicators.  \n \n43.  The  rationalization  of  concerned  agencies  under  MOI  is  moving  forward.  Staff \nrationalization is currently ongoing at BSCIC as part of human resource restructuring. Staff \nstrength of BSCIC is 3,244, comprising 1,644 officers (436 in the head office and 1,208 in field \noffices) and 1,600 employees. It is planned to significantly reduce their strength. The number of \nhead office officers will be reduced by half. Staff reduction in the field offices is being worked \nout. Voluntary retirement will be offered to regular officers and employees. Staff who do not \nhave properly approved appointments (about 300 persons) will be considered for termination. \nFor improved productivity, training/retraining will be provided. Regardless of whether BSCIC is \nrestructured or phased out, the Government will have to replenish the employees\u2019 provident \nfund and cover special deposit accounts for withdrawals made to bridge BSCIC\u2019s accumulated \nlosses (para. 17). SCITI has been upgraded from a development project to a regular agency of \nBSCIC,27 and is recruiting experienced staff and faculty members. SCITI will be restructured to \nstrengthen its capacity to deliver training and capacity building services to SMEs. In light of the \nexpected passage of the Accreditation Law that will set up the Accreditation Board, which will \naccredit calibration and testing laboratories and certification bodies including those in the private \nsector, there is a need to assess BSTI\u2019s role in conducting product testing and in certification, \nand to carry out a study for its strategic reorientation. The Program seeks to resolve these \nissues based on the findings of the study. \n \n44.  Rationalization  of  credit  assistance  will  be  based  on  an  analytical  review  of  all \ngovernment-assisted credit programs and facilities for SMEs, including their scope, interest \nrates, terms and conditions, and implementation arrangements. These include credit programs \nof government ministries, agencies, and public sector banking institutions funded from the \nnational budget, refinancing facilities of the BB, and credit programs of NCBs and specialized \nfinancial  institutions  funded  from  their  own  resources.  The  issues  of  directed  lending  and \npolitical considerations, subsidy, and moral hazard will be examined, and, drawing on findings of \nthe analytical review and considering international best practices, specific recommendations to \nmake  credit  delivery  mechanisms  more  effective  and  sustainable  will  be  prepared.  These \nstudies will be financed by the TA loan (para. 83).  \n \n45.  Rationalize Incentive and Tax Structure for SMEs. The SME policy and development \nstrategy will include the Government\u2019s plan to provide for a suitable incentive and tax structure \nfor SMEs. To enhance viability of these small enterprises, tax incentives should be given during \ntheir initial stage of operations. If the Government abolishes the tax holiday scheme in the next \nfiscal year, a 75% income tax rebate and accelerated depreciation allowance for plant and \nmachinery  will  be  given  as  a  substitute  to  newly  established  small  enterprises  with  fixed \n                                                 \n27  Previously SCITI was a project funded from the annual development program. SCITI is now a permanent \ngovernment body with budgetary allocation from the annual revenue budget. ", "  15\ninvestments excluding land and building of less than Tk3 million. However, these tax incentives \nwill not be provided to those enterprises that already take advantage of tax incentives under \nexisting export incentive schemes. The Government will implement the tax incentives agreed \nupon to take effect from assessment year FY2006, as provided for in the Finance Act 2005 or \nother appropriate legislation. The impact of these tax incentives will be minimal initially because \nthese enterprises are very small. However, in the long run, these measures are expected to \nfacilitate the expansion of SMEs and consequently enhance revenue to the Government as they \ncome out of the informal sector and are captured in the tax net. As stated in the Industrial \nPolicy, to encourage the establishment of small firms, assistance will be given by way of \nrearranging the tax structure such that taxes and duties are fixed at the lowest level that can be \njustified.  \n \n46.  Enhance SME Access to Market and Government Services. MOI has a program to \nimplement e-governance, which will involve the development and maintenance of a web site to \nbe  linked  to  the  web  sites  of  other  line  ministries,  and  has  constituted  an  e-governance \ncommittee to spearhead and coordinate this program. The e-governance program is important \nfor access and dissemination of information, and enhanced transparency, particularly in crucial \nareas where corrupt practices prevail, such as procurement and business registration. The \nProgram will incorporate the development of an SME web portal/virtual front office and the \nestablishment of SME helpline outreach centers to provide (i) assistance for facilitating access \nto  government  services;  (ii) guidance  to  comply  with  government  requirements  including \nregistration, product testing and certification; and (iii) dissemination of information about SMEs, \nmarket opportunities, and linkages to international markets. The extensive geographic presence \nof BSCIC and FBCCI and its member associations could be used to further extend the outreach \nof government services to SMEs countrywide. MOI, in partnership with FBCCI and its district \nchambers and line associations, will establish helpline outreach centers at selected district \noffices of BSCIC, and knowledge centers at the Dhaka and Chittagong chambers of commerce \nand industry. The helpline and knowledge centers will utilize the SME web portal to provide \naccess  to  information  by  SMEs  in  various  parts  of  the  country  and  through  the  Internet. \nAssistance for the development of the SME web portal and helpline outreach centers will be \nfinanced under the TA loan (paras. 84 and 85).  \n \n47.  Enhance SME Access to Capacity Building. Under SMESDP, SCITI will undertake a \ntraining needs assessment and develop appropriate training programs under a public-private \npartnership with FBCCI, district chambers and line associations of FBCCI, accredited women \nentrepreneurs\u2019 associations, and the National Association of Small and Cottage Industries of \nBangladesh. The Government has committed to support targeted SME training, particularly for \n(i) SMEs in rural areas, (ii) women entrepreneurs, (iii) displaced workers in the RMG industry, \nand (iv) SME credit staff of participating financial institutions (PFIs) under SEF. MOI will present \na plan to restructure SCITI to strengthen its capacity to deliver training services to SMEs. SCITI \nwill charge for at least cost recovery for those who can afford to pay for the services. The TA \nloan  will  provide  assistance  to  SCITI  in  implementing  these  training  and  capacity-building \nprograms (para. 86).  \n \n48.  Enhance SME Access to Product Certification and Upgrade Product Certification \nSystem to International Standard. To meet SMEs\u2019 need for credible certification bodies where \nthey can obtain a technical evaluation of the quality of their products, BSTI will be strengthened \nin conducting product testing and certification. The Program will also support enactment of the \ndraft Accreditation Law, establishment of the Accreditation Board, and an application by the \nAccreditation  Board  for  membership  of  the  International  Accreditation  Forum  to  ensure \nworldwide acceptance of certificates issued by accredited certification bodies in Bangladesh. To ", "16  \nfacilitate SME access, a special window for certifying SME products will be set up at BSTI. \nAssistance in upgrading the product certification system and in promoting product certification \namong SMEs will be provided under the TA loan (para. 87).  \n \n49.  Develop  an  Integrated  SME  Database.  For  monitoring  SME  performance  and \ndevelopment, and for targeting assistance, it is essential to have a database that indicates, \namong other things, the number of SMEs, their characteristics and economic activities, and type \nand number of employees. An initial listing of SMEs will be generated from the Economic \nCensus supplemented by other sources. This will serve as a sampling frame for large-scale \nnationwide  sample  surveys  on  attributes  of  SMEs  such  as  employment  (with  gender \nbreakdown) and output. Such data will be captured in an integrated SME database that will \nfacilitate assessment, particularly as regards impact and effectiveness of government policies. \nThe  BBS  is  completing  the  processing  of  the  Economic  Census  and  will  be  publishing  a \npreliminary report by end-2004. It is envisaged that the creation of the SME database will be a \ncollaborative effort with BBS. While BBS continues to prepare the basic statistics regarding the \nenterprise sector, it is important to have a dedicated unit or institution focusing on information \ngathering  for  SMEs.  The  SME  Cell  will  assume  this  function.  The  TA  loan  will  provide \nassistance in the development of the database (para. 88).  \n \n2.  Important Features \n \n50.  Internationally Accepted Principles.  Policy actions under SMESDP  incorporate key \nprinciples28 as discussed in paras. 51\u201358. \n \n51.  Public-Private Partnerships. To ensure ownership and credibility of policy reforms, the \ndevelopment of the SME policy and ensuing action program to support the SME development \nstrategy will be a participatory process involving consultation with all concerned stakeholders. \nThe  proposed  SME  Foundation  that  will  eventually  take  over  functions  to  support  SME \ndevelopment within the Government will have private sector representation on its board. The \ntraining service delivery will be implemented by SCITI in collaboration with FBCCI, chambers, \nand  associations.  The  Government  will  provide,  with  development  agency  support,  initial \ninvestments in public goods (e.g., SME database) for the benefit of SMEs, and the associated \nservices to maintain such public goods will be contracted to private sector organizations, or run \nas a joint public-private undertaking. The Government will focus on promoting the development \nof markets for the delivery of BDS by private sector providers. The Government and public \nservice institutions will continue to provide services where gaps exist due to market failures, and \nwill withdraw when markets for these services develop. \n \n52.  Demand-Driven  Interventions.  Training  provided  under  SMESDP  will  be  demand-\ndriven and based on training needs assessment, avoiding duplication with existing training \nprograms.  \n \n53.  Principles of Cost Recovery. The principle of cost recovery will guide the planning and \nimplementation of the targeted training programs. There could be exceptions to the principle of \ncost recovery in cases that involve very small rural participants who do not have immediate \ncapacity  to  pay  regular  training  fees  but  could  influence  the  direction  and  pace  of  SME \ndevelopment in their communities. Similarly, employers hiring displaced RMG workers will pay \n                                                 \n28  These are based on the OECD\u2019s Bologna Charter on SME Policies, the Istanbul Ministerial Declaration: Fostering \nthe Growth of Innovative and Internationally Competitive SMEs, and current SME policies and legal framework of \nADB developing member countries. Market-based principles in finance are discussed in the Project Loan section. ", "  17\nfor their training, but fees will be waived if workers with no ability to pay do not have immediate \nemployment prospects. \n \n54.  Coordination  of  Government  Efforts.  The  institutional  framework  for  SME \ndevelopment will involve all tiers of the Government, including high-level support from the \ninterministerial committee to be chaired by the prime minister. Moreover, the SME Foundation, a \ndedicated institution, will be set up to promote SME development on a sustainable basis.  \n \n55.  Efficient  Resources  Utilization  and  Outreach  of  SME  Programs.  Efficiency  of \nresource use will be maximized by working with SME groups or cells within chambers and \nbusiness associations, which will coordinate with helpline outreach centers to ensure efficient \nservice delivery to SMEs nationwide.  \n \n56.  Use of Information Technology and E-Commerce. The SME web site/virtual front \noffice under SMESDP that will contain information of SMEs and market opportunities will reduce \nbarriers to SME access to global markets, and will be complementary to the Government\u2019s e-\ngovernance program.  \n \n57.  Development  of  Evaluation  Culture  and  Statistical  Database  for  SME \nDevelopment. An evaluation culture will be promoted in ministries and agencies responsible for \nSME  policies  and  programs  to  ensure  cost-effectiveness  and  outreach  of  benefits  of  the \nprograms. The SME database will help identify population of SMEs and facilitate implementation \nof SME-targeted interventions and studies of the SME sector, while the TA grant will support the \ndevelopment of benefit monitoring systems.  \n \n58.  Empowerment  of  Women  Entrepreneurs.  To  target  women  entrepreneurship \ndevelopment, a gender action plan has been prepared, specifying women-targeted activities to \nbe conducted under SMESDP. First, women entrepreneurs will be involved in the preparation \nand implementation of the SME policy and development framework. The composition of the \nSME Task Force includes a representative from the Women Entrepreneurs\u2019 Association of \nBangladesh. Women entrepreneurs will also have a representative in NCID. Second, targeted \nwomen\u2019s  training  programs  will  be  conducted  in  collaboration  with  women  entrepreneurs\u2019 \nassociations. Third, a portion of funds under SEF will be allocated to women entrepreneurs \n(para. 71). Lastly, gender-disaggregated data will be included in the SME database and the \nmonitoring system of SMESDP to facilitate gender-targeted interventions and to keep track of \nwomen beneficiaries, including trained participants under the targeted women entrepreneurship \ntraining programs. (The gender action plan is in Supplementary Appendix 1.) \n \n3.  Financing Plan \n \n59.  Adjustment Costs. The total adjustment costs estimated at $33.4 million equivalent \ncomprise (i) the development of SME policy and development framework and institutional setup \nfor  policy  implementation;  (ii) loss  of  revenues  from  tax  incentives  to  small  enterprises; \n(iii) establishment  and  operation  of  SME  support  infrastructure  including  the  integrated \ndatabase,  web  portal,  helpline  outreach  centers,  and  e-governance  infrastructure;  and \n(iv) rationalization and improvement of government assistance to SMEs including restructuring \nof SCITI, restructuring of BSCIC, and upgrading of facilities and capacity building of BSTI. \nUnder restructuring of BSCIC or its replacement, the Program will provide budgetary support for \nfinancial restructuring costs to cover its accumulated operating losses (paras. 17 and 43), staff \nrationalization,  voluntary  retirement,  termination  of  excess  personnel  (particularly  those  not ", "18  \nauthorized to be in the employee roster), and recruitment of qualified professionals for specific \nimportant positions.

Financing  and  Tranching.  The  program  loan  of  SDR9.954  million  ($15  million \nequivalent) will be from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an amortization period of 24 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The loan closing date is expected to be 31 \nDecember 2007. Other terms and conditions are set out in the Program Loan Agreement. The \nloan proceeds will be available for withdrawal upon satisfactory compliance with the agreed \nconditions. The first tranche of $5 million equivalent will be released upon effectiveness of the \nloan and fulfillment of the first tranche release conditions. The second tranche of $10 million \nequivalent is expected to be released by end-June 2007, upon fulfillment of the second tranche \nrelease conditions. \n \n4.  Procurement and Disbursement \n \n61.  The  program  loan  will  follow  ADB  standard  procedures  for  procurement  and \ndisbursement. Proceeds of the loan will be utilized to finance the full foreign exchange costs, \nexcluding local duties and taxes, of imports produced in and procured from ADB\u2019s member \ncountries, other than those specified in the list of ineligible items and those items financed by \nother multilateral and bilateral official sources. (The list of ineligible items is in Appendix 4.) All \nprocurement  under  the  program  loan  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement and undertaken through normal commercial practices for the private sector or the \nGovernment\u2019s prescribed procurement procedures acceptable to ADB, with due consideration to \neconomy and efficiency. Disbursements under the program loan will be made in line with ADB\u2019s \nsimplified disbursement procedures and audit requirements. To withdraw the proceeds of the \nloan, the Borrower will certify that the value of eligible imports exceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s \nprojected disbursements under the program loan in a given period. ADB will have the right to \naudit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification. \n \n5.  Environmental Assessment of Policy Matrix \n \n62.  The  assessment  has  been  carried  out.  No  specific  environmental  mitigation  or \nmonitoring requirement was identified (Supplementary Appendix 2). \n \n \n ", "  19\nD.  The Project Loan \n \n1.  Components and Outputs \n \n63.  Small Enterprise Fund. Market and policy failures in the financial sector are being \naddressed through various loan and TA projects on the reform of the Bangladesh financial \nsector  funded  by  ADB  and  other  development  partners  (paras.  28-31).  However,  the \ndevelopment of an appropriate legal framework as well as capacity building of the regulator and \nmarket players will take time. The Bangladesh credit market suffers from a dearth of medium- to \nlong-term funds and does not allocate funds efficiently. Some FIs, which are keen to lend to \nSMEs, are constrained by the limited availability of term funds at reasonable costs while others \nare  reluctant  to  expand  their  SME  loan  portfolio  due  to  perceived  higher  credit  risk  and \nadministrative costs of dealing with small borrowers. To encourage FIs to extend credit to \nSMEs,  the  Government  has  allocated  Tk1  billion  from  the  Rural-based  Agro  Processing \nIndustries Refinancing Facility to establish SEF as a credit facility to be managed by BB for \nrefinancing loans to small enterprises lent by banks and NBFIs (see summary of SEF terms and \nconditions in Appendix 5 and BB\u2019s circular of 2 May 2004 on the Refinance Scheme for Small \nEnterprises Sector in Supplementary Appendix 3).  \n \n64.  To support the government initiative in this regard, the project loan of SDR19.908 million \n($30 million equivalent) will be used as a contribution to SEF. WB has contributed $10 million \nequivalent  to  SEF  under  its  EGBM  project.29  SEF  will  enhance  access  to  credit  by  small \nenterprises in the \u201cmissing middle\u201d between micro- and medium enterprises. Eligible enterprises \nwill have fixed assets of not more than Tk10 million and will not be in the exclusion list that \ncovers  tobacco,  alcoholic  drinks,  armaments,  and  other  ineligible  items.  While  the  overall \nfinancing gap of the SME sector is large, the problem of lack of access to credit is more \npronounced for this segment of SMEs. Under SEF, these enterprises can apply for loans in the \nrange of Tk0.2 million\u20135 million. In addition, the TA loan component will provide capacity-\nbuilding assistance to PFIs to strengthen their systems and procedures for SME lending, and \ntrain the SME credit staff to better understand and guide SMEs in their operations.  \n \na.  Participating Financial Institutions \n \n65.  Preidentification of PFIs. Under ADB\u2019s financial intermediary loan (FIL) modality, PFIs \nare preidentified based on due diligence conducted not only to analyze their financial aspects \nbut also to determine their ability to handle social and environmental issues. Six PFIs, namely, \nPrime  Bank,  Eastern  Bank,  Basic  Bank,  Industrial  Development  Leasing  Company  of \nBangladesh, Industrial Promotion & Development Company of Bangladesh, and United Leasing \nCompany, for which due diligence has been carried out, have been preidentified to participate \nunder SEF (see summary of due diligence report in Appendix 6). However, since the facility is \naimed at improving access to credit by SMEs, it was deemed appropriate to make the facility \navailable to as wide a number of eligible FIs as possible. Moreover, the current approach is \naimed at mainstreaming SME lending in the financial sector as opposed to the previous practice \nof relying on specialized FIs such as development finance institutions to deliver the credit. \nConsequently, BB in its capacity as administrator of SEF could accredit additional PFIs provided \nthey meet eligibility criteria as agreed between BB, WB, and ADB (see also para. 77). BB will \n                                                 \n29  Concerns about large-scale terminations of workers under the EGBM project led the Government to find ways to \nreabsorb excess workers from state-owned enterprises and banks and provide gainful employment. Consequently, \nsupporting the more rapid expansion of the SME sector was considered a viable way of addressing the problem.  ", "20  \nprovide relevant information to ADB regarding accreditation of additional PFIs, which would \nenable ADB to conduct due diligence as necessary.  \n \n66.  PFI Eligibility Criteria. Eligible PFIs must have no more than 10% classified loans on \nportfolios up to Tk5 million. Being under the supervision of BB, PFIs must also fully comply with \nBB\u2019s prudential regulations which include, among other things, (i) minimum capital of 9% on a \nrisk-weighted basis, up from 8% previously; (ii) exposure limit to a particular customer or group; \n(iii) loan  classification  and  loan  loss  provisioning;30  (iv) internal  control  system;  (v) risk \nmanagement and antimoney-laundering procedures; and (vi) early warning system. In addition, \nunder the Project Agreement between ADB and BB, each participation agreement between BB \nand the PFI will contain provisions that require the PFI to maintain financial soundness; conduct \nits operations in accordance with sound financial principles and practices; maintain a lending \nand  investment  policy  acceptable  to  ADB  and  BB  to  enable  it  to  effectively  appraise  the \nfinancial,  technical,  environmental,  and  economic  feasibility  of  investment  projects;  and \nsupervise  and  monitor  the  implementation  of  investment  projects  by  beneficiaries.  BB\u2019s \nprudential regulations as well as the WB\u2019s criteria conform to the eligibility criteria of PFIs under \nADB\u2019s FIL policy that have been reflected in the Project Agreement between ADB and BB. \nMoreover,  the  TA  loan  will  provide  assistance  to  PFIs  to  strengthen  their  systems  and \nprocedures for SME lending to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s FIL policy. \n \n67.  Safeguard Policies. BB will ensure that PFIs adhere to ADB\u2019s safeguard policies on \nenvironment  and  resettlement.  It  is  expected  that  many  PFIs  will  not  have  systematic \nprocedures  for  monitoring  and  assessment.  ADB  will  assist  PFIs  through  the  TA  loan  to \nestablish environmental management and monitoring systems appropriate for the targeted small \nenterprise clientele. \n \n68.  Environmental Due Diligence of the PFIs. The six PFIs include environmental risk \nanalysis during their appraisal of loans, which involves as a minimum, checking if the borrower \nhas an environmental clearance certificate. The PFIs do not finance projects that are hazardous \nor  environmentally  risky.31  All  FIs  have  a  designated  officer  responsible  for  environmental \nissues,  but  none  has  formal  training  and  only  a  few  have  attended  development  agency-\nsponsored seminars on the environment. All FIs expressed need for further assistance and \ntraining. \n \n69.  BDS Offered by PFI. ADB, under the TA loan, will provide assistance to build up the \ncapacity of PFIs to improve their SME lending capabilities, systems, and procedures; and to \nprovide in-house advisory services for their SME clients. For more in-depth and sophisticated \nBDS, PFIs will refer SMEs to external BDS providers.  \n \n                                                 \n30  BB is bringing loan classification in line with international standards, i.e., currently, \"substandard\" if arrears are \nmore than 6 months but less than 9 months, \"doubtful\" if more than 9 months but less than 12 months, and as \n\"bad debt\" if more than 12 months (as compared with limits of 3, 6, and 12 months respectively under international \nstandards). The Cabinet has approved amendments to allow BB to make the necessary changes to loan \nclassification standards. BB is receiving assistance under the WB\u2019s Central Bank Strengthening Project for $37 \nmillion to ensure banks' compliance with international standards. \n31  IPDC (which was formerly affiliated with IFC) and IDLC (in which IFC is a shareholder), both follow environmental \nguidelines prescribed by IFC/WB and they do not finance any project that is on the exclusion list of IFC/WB. They \nhave incorporated in the loan agreement a provision requiring the borrower to obtain an environmental clearance \ncertificate for setting up the project to be financed and to renew the certificate every year. United Leasing, in which \nADB has a shareholding, and Basic Bank, which has received loans from ADB and several other funding \nagencies, have similar requirements. The two other banks, Prime Bank and Eastern Bank, are not as rigorous or \nregular in checking environmental compliance, and they do not have a formal environmental management system. ", "  21\nb.  Small and Medium Enterprise Beneficiaries \n \n70.  Scope. Taking into account the experience under the BB\u2019s Rural-based Agro-processing \nIndustries Refinancing Facility, which had a low utilization rate owing mainly to the geographic \nrestriction on use of funds, SEF has no geographic, industrial, or sector restrictions. SEF will \nfinance agro-based enterprises, but not crop, livestock, and fish production that are being \nfinanced already with agricultural loans. Furthermore, participation in SEF is not limited to \nscheduled banks and the facility can be used for financing leases. More importantly, SEF will be \nsubject to periodic review. BB in consultation with WB and ADB, will take corrective measures to \nimprove utilization, including raising the coverage to include SMEs beyond the strict definition of \nthe \u201cmissing middle\u201d if needed. \n \n71.  Allocation for Women Entrepreneurs. Women are normally given lower priority in \nallocation of credit due mainly to negative sociocultural perceptions of women in business. To \nfacilitate access by women borrowers, a minimum of 10% of SEF will be earmarked for lending \nto women entrepreneurs. However, if the earmarked funds are not utilized within a period of 1.5 \nyears, such funds will revert to the general pool. \n \nc.  Use of Asian Development Bank Loan Proceeds \n \n72.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  new  loans  advanced  by  PFIs  under  a \nparticipation agreement with BB for the purpose of using the SEF, and will not be used to \nrefinance the portfolio of old loans in the existing portfolio of the PFIs. Loans approved by PFIs \nmore than 180 days prior to the application date for reimbursement of first disbursement using \nADB funds will not be allowed. \n \n73.  Use of ADB Loan Proceeds for Working Capital. SEF will be available for medium-\nterm (1\u20133 years) and long-term (3\u20135 years) loans as well as for short-term working capital \nloans. ADB\u2019s FIL policy states that ADB funds may be used by the financial intermediary \nrecipient of the FIL to finance fixed capital requirements of subprojects as well as subprojects\u2019 \nforeign exchange requirements for initial working capital (such as initial stock of spare parts, \ntools, and raw materials), but not for subsequent working capital requirements.32 The WB\u2019s FIL \npolicy allows for financing of working capital for expansion of business activities.33 Since ADB \nloan proceeds will be contributed with WB and BB funds to the same pool, it would be an \nadministrative burden on BB to distinguish whether a subloan is for initial working capital or for \nexpansion  or  simply  for  additional  working  capital.  Such  differentiation  would  be  highly \nimpractical given the small size of these loans. Further, it would be impractical and complicated \nfor small enterprises to seek financing from other sources just for their working capital needs \ngiven their limited access to credit. In this case, the requirement in the FIL policy for the use of \nADB loans to finance only initial working capital should be relaxed to allow the ADB loan to help \nmeet credit demands and for harmonization with BB\u2019s criteria and WB\u2019s policy. \n \n74.  Taking into account the estimated contribution from PFIs and SME beneficiaries as well \nas WB and BB cofinancing, ADB\u2019s share of the project cost is estimated at only 11.6% (Table \n2). At the subproject level, however, there may be cases where ADB\u2019s financing may exceed \nthe 75% cost sharing limit for Bangladesh. Under ADB\u2019s local cost financing policy, ADB allows \nfinancial  intermediaries  to  use  the  foreign  exchange  provided  under  FILs,  to  finance  local \ncurrency expenditures of subprojects within standard cost-sharing limits; it is estimated that \n                                                 \n32  ADB Operations Manual, Section D6/BP, para. 14. \n33  WB\u2019s Operational Policies on Financial Intermediary Lending. ", "22  \ndirect  and  indirect  foreign  exchange  costs  at  the  Project  level  will  be  16.6%  and  7.2%, \nrespectively.34 In this regard, the local cost financing limit of ADB for Bangladesh should not be \napplied at the subproject level for flexibility in meeting the financing needs of small enterprises.  \n \nd.  Relending and Onlending Rates \n \n75.  SEF is available for PFIs in local currency (taka) at the BB rate, which is currently 5%,35 \nwhile PFIs will onlend the funds in taka to qualified SME borrowers at market rates. Currently, \nthe average cost of funds (less than 1 year) is about 7\u20139% for PCBs and 11\u201313% for NBFIs. \nThe average lending rate is 10\u201313% for banks and 14\u201315% for NBFIs (even as high as 17% for \nlonger-term maturities). The 5% BB rate utilized as the basis for refinancing loans under SEF \nwill be applied uniformly and in a nondiscriminatory fashion to all eligible PFIs under the SEF. \nThe BB rate is also the reference rate for all of BB\u2019s refinancing facilities. The use of this rate is \njustified on the basis of the 3.5\u20134% foreign exchange cover and credit risk premium over the \nAsian Development Fund rate of the project loan. The BB rate is viewed as the wholesale cost \nat which PFIs would be willing to borrow to finance the SEF end-users. The 2% differential \nbetween the BB rate and the bank deposit rate36 is also to compensate PFIs for the higher \nservicing and administrative costs of dealing with small SME borrowers. Moreover, PFIs need \ninducements to focus their lending on SMEs. The penetration into this segment of borrowers \ncould create a demonstration effect among FIs. Given more familiarity with the SME sector and \nenhanced capabilities of their staff, PFIs are expected to establish or strengthen their SME units \nto provide SME financing on a sustainable basis even after the expiry of SEF. Notwithstanding \nthe use of the BB rate as the basis for the refinance facility, the onlending rate of PFIs to \nsubprojects will be on strictly market-determined terms. In view of this, and consistent with \nADB\u2019s FIL policy,37 the use of the BB rate at a level below bank deposit levels is justified. \n \n76.  There are differing viewpoints as to whether this could be considered an implicit subsidy. \nAccording to the ADB Board Information Paper Bank Criteria for Subsidies dated 30 October \n1996, \u201cthe exceptions to the general rule of no subsidies for private provision include interest \nrate subsidies directed to SMEs or to exporters to compensate for other policy effects. In many \ndeveloping  member  countries,  there  is  no  market  for  long-term  capital.  ADB,  through  its \nactivities, can provide access to long-term capital and encourage the development of domestic \ncapital markets for longer term funds. In seeking to establish and improve capital markets, ADB \nis justified in providing funds and encouraging the domestic development of investment funds at \na price that does not fully reflect the risks being taken.\u201d Thus, the relending rate in either case \ncould be justified in the context of Bangladesh where the capital market has not effectively \nplayed  its  role  in  mobilizing  and  allocating  long-term  funds.  Moreover,  concerns  about \nsubsidies\u2014including fiscal burden, altering market signals, and undesirable and unanticipated \neffects on income distribution\u2014are not relevant in the case of SEF. \n \n                                                 \n34  WB and Bangladesh Enterprise Institute. 2003. Improving the Investment Climate in Bangladesh. Washington, \nDistrict of Columbia. Table A3.2 of Appendix 3 of the WB report gives a breakdown of sources of inputs and \nsupplies by firm size. For small enterprises, the breakdown is: 76.2% of inputs and supplies from domestic \nsources; 16.6%, imported directly; and 7.2% imported indirectly. \n35  The BB rate is used as a reference rate for BB to signal an expansionary or contractionary monetary policy stance. \nIt is also used uniformly as the refinance rate in various BB credit facilities. Repo rates derived from open market \noperations are used as a monetary policy tool. \n36  Bank deposit rates are also influenced by the Government\u2019s National Savings Certificates schemes.  \n37  ADB Operations Manual, Section D6/BP, issued on 15 December 2003. In exceptional and well-justified cases, \nADB, for a certain period, may accept relending rates that are below market, but not below ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources lending rates in the case of a foreign currency-denominated loan or the equivalent rate in the case of a \nlocal currency loan, which should reflect an adequate foreign exchange risk premium.  ", "  23\ne.  Management of the Facility \n \n77.  Bangladesh Bank as Facility Manager. BB was deemed appropriate to administer \nSEF at this stage because of BB\u2019s large contribution to SEF, its ready access to information in \ndetermining the financial soundness and capabilities of PFIs for providing credit to the SME \nsector,  and  its  function  as  administrator  of  the  Credit  Information  Bureau,  which  gathers \ninformation regarding borrowers.38 No feasible alternative for facility management could be \nfound. Concerns about governance, conflict of interest, and lack of capacity of candidate facility \nmanagers earlier considered ruled them out. BB\u2019s regulatory and supervisory capacity is being \nstrengthened  under  the  ongoing  WB\u2019s  Central  Bank  Strengthening  Project.  Guidance  and \nsupport are provided in designing new bank regulation policy and strengthening prudential \nregulations,  reporting,  and  enforcement.  BB  has  made  progress  in  improving  its  financial \nreporting,  auditing,  and  control  systems,  and  has  adopted  the  International  Accounting \nStandards as its accounting basis. The Agriculture Credit and Special Programs Department of \nBB will take charge of administering SEF, and BB will ensure that there are well-qualified \nprofessionals  for  the  management  of  SEF.  Once  the  SME  Foundation  is  established,  the \nmanagement of SEF will be transferred in a phased manner from BB to the SME Foundation to \nensure a sustainable institutional structure with private sector participation.  \n \n2.  Important Features \n \n78.  The ineffective allocation of credit is due to market failures resulting from NPL problems \nof  NCBs  and  lack  of  effective  long-term  debt  and  interbank  markets.  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment partners have actively supported financial sector reform through various loan and \nTA projects to address market failures. However, measures aimed at creating an enabling \nenvironment will require continuous long-term commitment from the Government and will take \ntime to bring about substantial development impact. Currently, some FIs that are keen to \nengage in SME lending are constrained by limited availability of term funds at reasonable cost \nwhile others need to be provided with incentives to expand their loan portfolio. The problem is \nmore pronounced for SMEs in the \u201cmissing middle\u201d. It is imperative that PFIs are provided with \nfinancing resources, especially term funds at reasonable rates, to induce them to focus on the \nSME sector, and trigger the expansion of their SME portfolio. SEF is formulated to mainstream \nSME lending in the financial system instead of just defining one or few PFIs. The project loan as \ncontribution to SEF will also be complementary to the WB\u2019s contribution under its EGBM project. \nBB, as the fund manager, will coordinate the utilization of the ADB and WB fund contributions \nand the Government\u2019s own funds in SEF. Complementary to the project loan is the TA loan that \nwill enhance understanding of the SME sector among PFIs. Once the legal and institutional \ninfrastructure is developed, these FIs will be able to introduce diversified financing mechanisms \nand instruments for more appropriately meeting the needs of SMEs. SMESDP will help bridge \nthe current gap and allow for policy measures on financial market development to bear fruit.39  \n \n                                                 \n38  A Credit Information Bureau has been set up in BB. Currently, it covers loan accounts of at least Tk50,000. BB \nplans to put the Credit Information Bureau online by 2005 and further expand the coverage of credit information. \nThis will enable enhanced transparency on the quality of loans by borrowers. \n39  The Government was receptive to the possible introduction of partial credit guarantee as credit enhancement to \nmobilize resources for SMEs on a sustainable basis. During SMESDP implementation, the Government, in close \ncollaboration with BB, will further assess the need and feasibility for alternative credit enhancement arrangements. \nUnder the Trade Finance Facilitation Program launched in May 2004, ADB will issue partial credit guarantees to \nguarantee participating international and regional banks (confirming banks), for payment of trade credits issued by \naccredited local banks (issuing banks) in selected developing member countries, including Bangladesh. A trade \nfacilitation agreement has been signed by ADB with Southeast Bank. ", "24  \n3.  Costs and Financing Plan \n \n79.  The fund size of SEF is $56.7 million equivalent consisting of $16.7 million equivalent \nfrom the Government, $10.0 million equivalent from WB, and $30.0 million equivalent from ADB. \nPFIs and SME beneficiaries will contribute to the costs of subprojects from their own resources. \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $257.8  million  equivalent,  including  $201.1  million \nequivalent estimated to be financed by PFIs, other sources of credit, and SME beneficiaries\u2019 \nequity in addition to SEF.40 ADB will provide the project loan of $30 million equivalent from its \nSpecial Funds resources for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an \ninterest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The \nproject loan will be provided in foreign exchange. Interest during the implementation period will \nbe capitalized.

Disbursement \n \n80.  ADB will lend the SME credit funds in US dollars to the Government under a loan \nagreement.  In  turn,  the  Government  will  provide  the  taka  proceeds  to  BB  under  an \nadministrative agreement. As the apex institution, BB will lend the SME funds in taka to eligible \nPFIs at refinancing rate of interest equivalent to the prevailing BB rate. ADB financing will be \navailable  to  PFIs  on  a  refinancing  basis  (i.e.,  based  on  disbursement  by  PFIs  to  SME \nborrowers). In turn, PFIs will relend the SME credit funds in taka as subloans/subleases to their \nSME clients at market-determined rates. The SME clients will repay the principal amount of the \nsubloans/subleases to PFIs, which are obligated to repay BB in full irrespective of the amount \ncollected from their clients. Activities to be financed through subloans/subleases will be carried \nout  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  procurement  requirements  and  environmental  and  other \nsafeguard policies. The project loan will be available for 5 years from the effectiveness of \nSMESDP. It is expected that the completion date for the project will be 30 June 2010 and the \nloan closing date will be 31 December 2010. Subsequently, BB will recycle the funds repaid by \n                                                 \n40  It is assumed that SME borrowers will contribute one third from their own equity and seek external financing for the \nrest from PFIs and other sources. Based on discussions with the preidentified FIs, it is expected that PFIs will \nfinance about 65% of their SME loans from SEF and about 35% from other sources of funds.  ", "  25\nPFIs for new subloans/subleases. Subloans/subleases drawn down under the facility will be \ncoterminous with the ADB loan (i.e., 32 years maturity). \n \n81.  An imprest account will be established for the purpose of SEF administered by BB. The \ninitial advance to the imprest account will be based on estimated expenditures for the first 6 \nmonths of the project loan or 10% of the respective loan amount (i.e., $3 million equivalent), \nwhichever  is  lower.  The  imprest  account  will  be  replenished  as  eligible  expenditures  are \nincurred and liquidated. The imprest account will be established, managed, and liquidated in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, and detailed arrangements as agreed \nby the Government and ADB. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedures may be used to \nreimburse eligible expenditures and to liquidate advances made into the imprest account in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. Statement of expenditures procedures \nwill be applicable to individual payments amounting to $50,000 or less. \n \nE.  The Technical Assistance Loan  \n \n1.  Components and Outputs \n \n82.  The TA loan will provide technical advice and resources needed to build capacity and \nassist  in  program  implementation  to  achieve  the  stated  outcomes  of  the  Program.  The \ncomponents of the TA loan are discussed in the following paragraphs. The rationale, scope, and \napproach of each of the components of the TA loan are in Appendix 7. Terms of reference for \nTA loan components are in Supplementary Appendix 5.  \n \n83.  Rationalization of Government Assistance to SMEs. The TA loan will deliver the \nfollowing outputs, among other things: (i) a diagnostic analysis of BSCIC and its restructuring \nplan or phaseout plan, together with a timebound roadmap; (ii) restructuring plans for SCITI and \nBSTI or plans for their strategic reorientation; (iii) recommendations on the rationalization of \nexisting SME credit facilities provided by the Government; and (iv) conceptual design of clusters \nand industrial parks.  \n \n84.  Design and Development of SME Web Portal/Virtual Front Office. The SME web \nportal will (i) disseminate information about SMEs in Bangladesh such that any local or foreign \nbuyer or investor can easily reach the SMEs and initiate any business relationship; (ii) facilitate \ne-governance and provide online information for SMEs on government facilities and services, \nsuch  as  requirements  for  business  registration,  licensing  and  product  certification;  and \n(iii) contain a library of SME-related information, such as a list of BDS providers and link to the \nSME database. This will require a wide-area network connecting remote nodes located in \ndistricts outside Dhaka with the data center in the SME Cell at MOI. \n \n85.  Establishment and Operation of SME Helpline Outreach Centers. This component \nwill assist in establishing SME helpline outreach centers at the district offices of BSCIC and \nfacilities of the Dhaka and Chittagong chambers of commerce and industry to provide advisory \nsupport to facilitate SME access to government services, including registration and licensing. \nThe helpline outreach centers will be linked to the SME web portal to facilitate their services to \nSMEs. \n \n86.  Targeted SME Capacity Building. SCITI, in collaboration with FBCCI, district chambers \nand  line  associations  of  FBCCI,  accredited  women  entrepreneurs\u2019  associations,  National \nAssociation of Small and Cottage Industries of Bangladesh, and helpline outreach centers \nwhere  available,  will  carry  out  suitable  and  affordable  training  programs  targeted  for ", "26  \n(i) entrepreneurs and small enterprises in rural areas; (ii) women entrepreneurs; (iii) displaced \nworkers in the RMG industry; and (iv) PFIs under SEF, or other FIs that may wish to avail of \nthese training services. The TA will strengthen capacity of SCITI to implement these training \nprograms  on  a  continuing  basis.  In  addition,  the  TA  loan  will  provide  capacity-building \nassistance for PFIs to establish or improve their SME financing systems and procedures and \nadopt new financing modalities such as cash-flow-based lending, and movable asset-based \nsecured transactions to enhance their SME credit operations. \n \n87.  Upgrading of Product Certification System to International Standard. Assistance in \nterms of advice, capacity building, and equipment facilities will be provided to improve the \nquality of product certification system in Bangladesh to international standard in collaboration \nwith  the  planned  project  of  the  European  Commission  and  United  Nations  Industrial \nDevelopment Organization. Certification services to SMEs will be facilitated. The TA loan will \nalso assist BSTI in conducting campaigns to promote the importance of product certification \namong SMEs and help guide SMEs through the certification process. \n \n88.  Development of Integrated SME Database. Consulting inputs will be needed for the \nplanning, design, and development of an SME database. Using a registry of SMEs as sampling \nframe, a nationwide survey will be conducted to capture attributes of the SMEs. The database \ndesign will define SME populations and their characteristics by industry, sector, geographic \nlocation, and development contributions, e.g., employment and value added. \n \n89.  Environmental Assessment and Monitoring. This TA loan component will assist in \nbuilding up capacity of the executing agency (EA), implementing agencies (IAs), and PFIs to \nensure compliance with ADB\u2019s environmental safeguard policy. PFIs will be assisted in setting \nup an environmental impact monitoring system.  \n \n2.  Costs and Financing \n \n90.  The total cost of the TA loan project is estimated at $8.46 million equivalent, of which \n$5.0  million  equivalent  will  be  financed  by  ADB,  and  $3.46  million  equivalent  by  the \nGovernment,  and  the  project  beneficiaries  including  SMEs,  PFIs,  training  participants, \nchambers, and associations, as summarized in Table 3. For the SME targeted training and the \nhelpline outreach centers, it is assumed that chambers and associations under the umbrella of \nthe FBCCI will contribute under a public-private partnership arrangement. The contributions of \nthe private sector will be by way of fees for training and advisory services and use of facilities. \n(Detailed cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 8.) \n \n91.  ADB will provide the TA loan of SDR3.318 million ($5 million equivalent) from its Special \nFunds resources for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, interest rate of 1% \nper annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and other terms and \nconditions set out in the TA Loan Agreement to cover the total foreign exchange cost and part of \nthe local currency cost. The TA loan will finance consulting services, procurement of equipment, \nworkshops and seminars, surveys, and report preparation. Interest during the implementation \nperiod will be capitalized. The TA loan will be implemented over 2.5 years and the loan closing \ndate is expected to be 30 June 2008.  \n ", "  27\nTable 3: Summary of Technical Assistance Loan Cost and Financing  \n($) \n \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

Statement of \nexpenditures procedures will be applicable to individual payments amounting to $50,000 or less. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements for the Sector Development Program \n \n1.  Program and Project Management \n \n96.  Central Program Coordination Unit. The Ministry of Finance, Finance Division (MOF-\nFD) will be the EA for SMESDP. MOF-FD will establish a central program coordinating unit \n(CPCU) that will coordinate activities between the various entities involved in delivering outputs \nof the Program. The CPCU will be in charge of supporting and overseeing the implementation of ", "  29\npolicy  actions  including  compliance  with  tranche  conditions  and  related  project  and  TA \ncomponents under SMESDP. It will ensure that adequate counterpart resources are made \navailable. The CPCU will liaise with the IAs to ensure effective management, close monitoring, \nand  timely  reporting.  It  will  ensure  timely  submission  by  each  IA  of  reports  that  will  be \nconsolidated for transmission to ADB. The CPCU will be the focal point for coordination of \nSMESDP  and  communication  with  private  sector  stakeholders  and  external  agencies, \nparticularly ADB, regarding the Program. The CPCU will be headed by the SMESDP program \ncoordinator at the level of joint secretary directly reporting to the secretary, MOF-FD. Such \ncoordinator  will  also  function  as  the  project  director  and  will  be  assisted  by  the  project \nconsultants to be engaged under the TA grant. The program implementation schedule is in \nAppendix 9. (The program organization chart is in Supplementary Appendix 4.) \n \n2.  Program and Project Implementation Units \n \n97.  MOI as IA for the Program Loan. The SME Cell set up at MOI will provide secretariat \nsupport initially to the SME Task Force and subsequently to the SME Advisory Panel in drafting \nthe SME policy and development framework as well as the action program to support the \ndevelopment strategy, and will be responsible for its implementation. Further, the SME Cell will \nundertake policy research and prepare reports for consideration by the Guidance Committee. \nMOI will prepare quarterly progress reports on the program loan and submit such reports to \nMOF-FD for submission to ADB.  \n \n98.  Bangladesh Bank as IA for the Project Loan. BB, as administrator or facility manager \nof SEF, will (i) provide information to ADB on candidate PFIs including its assessment of their \neligibility for SEF; (ii) disqualify any PFI that has become ineligible based on a semiannual \nreview; and (iii) review utilization and repayments of subloans/subleases of PFIs. In accordance \nwith the administrative agreement with the Government, BB will maintain proper accounts, \nprocedures, and records adequate to monitor and record the progress of subprojects financed \nby PFIs out of the subsidiary loans every 6 months. BB will review and report to ADB the \nutilization of the facility through progress reports every 3 months. The terms and conditions of \nthe facility will be amended as necessary based on the outcome of the review in coordination \nwith ADB and WB to increase utilization of the fund and respond to market needs. BB will also \nmonitor the socioeconomic and environmental benefits of the subprojects. In this regard, ADB \nwill provide TA grant resources for benefit monitoring and evaluation.  \n \n99.  MOI as IA for the TA Loan. The SME Cell will oversee the implementation of the TA \nloan to ensure the timely recruitment and effective supervision of consultants. The SME Cell will \nclosely coordinate with and submit required reports to the CPCU. Under the TA grant, the \nconsultants will provide technical and administrative support to the SME Cell. \n \n3.

MOF-FD will keep a record of the utilization of the SMESDP \nloans and will ensure that the record keeping and accounting done by the IAs follow accounting \nand  financial  management  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  IAs  will  maintain  separate \nrecords and accounts for the SMESDP loan components, which will be audited annually in \naccordance  with  sound  accounting  standards  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB. \nAnnual audited reports and financial statements, in English, will be submitted to ADB within 6 \nmonths after the end of each fiscal year. The auditor\u2019s opinion of that part of the examination \nrelating to the imprest account should be separately set out in the auditor\u2019s report.  \n ", "30  \n101.  Reporting.  MOF-FD  will  monitor  implementation  of  SMESDP.  Through  the  CPCU, \nMOF-FD will prepare quarterly a consolidated progress report on SMESDP (including a BB \nreport on accredited PFIs and review of utilization of SEF as stated in para. 98) in a format \nacceptable to ADB that gives information on implementation progress, issues encountered, and \nmeasures  taken  to  resolve  them,  and  the  status  of  compliance  with  loan  covenants.  The \nprogress reports will be submitted to ADB not later than 30 days after the end of the relevant \nquarter. MOF-FD will submit to ADB a completion report for SMESDP within 3 months of the \nend of the program period.

The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $750,000 equivalent. ADB will provide \n$600,000 equivalent on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA program to cover the foreign \nexchange cost and part of the local currency cost of the TA. The Government will provide the \nremaining $150,000 equivalent through the provision of counterpart staff, offices, transportation, \nand incidental expenses. The TA will be implemented over the implementation period of the \nSMESDP. MOF-FD will be the EA and MOI will be the IA of the TA. Individual consultants will \nbe  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of local consultants. Detailed objectives, \nscope, terms of reference of consulting services, and target dates for submission of consultants\u2019 \nreports are in Appendix 10. \n \nV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits and Impacts  \n \n104.  Policy  Measures.  SMESDP  will  be  the  principal  vehicle  in  the  formulation  and \nimplementation of SME-targeted public policy that has been developed through a participatory \nprocess involving all stakeholders. The growth of the SME sector supported by the Program will \nhelp generate employment, promote economic growth, and reduce poverty. SMEs will benefit in \na number of ways, among others. First, targeted SME policy measures will guide the concerned \ngovernment agencies in providing support to the SME sector. Second, tax incentives will reduce \nthe financial burden and enhance viability of small start-up enterprises. Third, more extensive \noutreach of guidance and handholding assistance will be provided through the SME web portal \nand helpline outreach centers. Fourth, there will be centralized information regarding market ", "  31\nopportunities and improved linkages to international markets. Fifth, SMEs will have improved \naccess to capacity building, training, and BDS. Sixth, e-governance registration that will be \nmade possible using the SME web portal will promote transparency and minimize opportunities \nfor rent seeking. Lastly, improved quality of the product certification system and enhanced \nacceptability of Bangladeshi products in international markets will allow SMEs to broaden their \nforeign market access and increase international competitiveness. \n \n105.  Institutional. SMESDP will support the development of institutional mechanisms and \nprovide the opportunity for the mobilization of public policy bodies at the highest level of the \nGovernment to promote the SME sector. At the implementation level, SMESDP will provide \ncapacity-building  assistance  to  the  SME  Cell  and  SME  Advisory  Panel  to  develop  and \nimplement an action program, and will assist in establishing and operationalizing the SME \nFoundation in the form of public-private partnership as a dedicated SME development agency \non a sustainable basis. Further, the Program will support studies to improve the effectiveness of \nthe concerned agencies that provide services to SMEs; prepare a plan for their restructuring \nand  strategic  reorientation;  rationalize  and  enhance  effectiveness  of  government  credit \nassistance to SMEs; and provide capacity-building assistance.  \n \n106.  Financial. Small enterprises will have better access to credit through SEF. The Program \nwill also enhance the capabilities of PFIs in extending credit to SMEs. Given more familiarity \nwith the SME sector, and enhanced capabilities of their staff, PFIs are expected to focus more \non the SME segment and strengthen their SME unit. PFIs will be able to grow and diversify their \nportfolios, in the process building their base of recurring earning assets. It is anticipated that at \nleast 15 PCBs and 13 NBFIs will use SEF. Capacity-building assistance for the development of \nSME lending systems and procedures will be provided for PFIs. Training will be provided to over \n1,000 SME credit staff. As a result, it is envisaged that the volume of SME loans will increase by \nat least 15.8% annually on average during FY2005\u2013FY2007 from a historical rate of about \n12.3% per annum. Moreover, it is estimated that over 10,000 subloans/subleases will be made \nthrough PFIs under SEF throughout the life of the ADB loan. Lending to SMEs will have a strong \nlinkage impact on BDS providers who will likely respond to generated demand for their services \nand PFI referrals. \n \n107.  Economic and Poverty. On a strategic level, SMESDP will contribute to the country\u2019s \ngoal of raising real economic growth, creating employment, and reducing poverty incidence. \nSMESDP will promote the growth of employment in the SME sector by at least 8% per annum \nthroughout the program implementation period. It is estimated that over 8,000 participants from \nSMEs, including 2,000 women, will undergo training to be conducted by SCITI in partnership \nwith chambers and associations during the TA loan implementation period. It is projected that \nabout 150,000 entrepreneurs and other individuals interested in setting up an enterprise will visit \nand use the services of the helpline outreach centers and at least half will be repeat visits by \nregular  clients.  Over  12,000  RMG  workers  will  undergo  training  and  at  least  50%  will  be \nreemployed during the TA implementation period. \n \n108.  Safeguards. The BB unit designated to manage SEF will monitor PFIs\u2019 adherence to \nADB\u2019s Environmental Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines as well as to \nADB\u2019s policies on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. PFIs are to be advised not \nto lend or lease to companies in the negative list (those not complying), and will have to report \nany  violation  or  noncompliance  by  their  borrowers  with  health,  safety,  and  environmental \nregulations. Provision to this effect will be made in the participation agreement with the PFIs as \nindicated in the Project Agreement between BB and ADB. As for environmental safeguards, \nADB\u2019s own due diligence will identify areas for remedy, including training as necessary. Since ", "32  \nthe  PFIs\u2019  subloans/subleases  to  SMEs  will  be  largely  in  the  light-manufacturing,  agro-\nprocessing, trade, and services sectors, and since none is expected in infrastructure, it is \nunlikely that involuntary resettlement or detrimental impacts on indigenous peoples will occur. \n(The summary poverty reduction and social strategy, which includes a gender action plan \nsection, is in Appendix 11.) \n \nB.  Risks \n \n109.  Despite changes in officials at the helm of the Government, it is expected that reforms \nunder  the  Program  will  continue  unhampered  given  the  high  priority  assigned  to  SME \ndevelopment and the Government\u2019s strong commitment as exemplified in the formation of the \nSME Task Force spearheaded by the principal secretary. Regulatory reforms will continue to \ncreate  a  more  conducive  environment  for  private  sector  development.  Stakeholders  will \nparticipate in the consultation process and policy dialogue for the SME development. The \nholding of the SME workshop in February 2004, where over 100 participants from the public and \nprivate sectors participated, is a clear indication of strong stakeholder interest. The fact that the \nGovernment initiated the process of consultation leading to the development of the SME policy \nand development framework demonstrates the Government\u2019s ownership of policy reforms. \n \n110.  The implementation risks have been addressed through the institutional mechanism, \nwhich involves all tiers in the Government including the NCID at the top policy level, Guidance \nCommittee at the ministerial level, and the dedicated SME Cell and SME Foundation at the \nimplementation level. The TA grant will provide capacity-building assistance to the EA and IAs \nin carrying out activities under the Program. To successfully implement the restructuring plan of \nthe concerned agencies under MOI, it is essential that qualified professionals be recruited to run \nthe organizations. The salary and incentive structure of the government employees should be \nreviewed to attract such professionals.  \n \n111.  The Program also reduces risks and institutes checks and balances through the use of \nparticipatory consultation mechanisms and public-private partnerships. The SME policy and \ndevelopment framework will be developed through consultation and participation of various \nstakeholders  and  will  be  disseminated  to  the  public  through  publication  in  newspapers  of \nnationwide  circulation  The  SME  Foundation  will  have  private  sector  representatives  on  its \nboard. The private sector through FBCCI and the business associations and chamber bodies \nwill be involved in program implementation and make a substantial contribution to the total \nresources, in addition to their business network, practical knowledge and skills, and linkages to \nsources of market information and technology.  \n \n112.  For the expansion of their loan portfolio to accommodate SMEs, it is assumed that the \nPFIs will increasingly view lending to SMEs through setting up dedicated SME units staffed with \ncapable personnel, efficient systems, and proper procedures. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \n113.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \nassurances, which are incorporated into the program, project and TA loan documents: \n \n114.  For the program loan: \n(i)  The Government will maintain the policies adopted and actions taken prior to the \ndate of the Program Loan Agreement and promptly adopt the other policies and ", "  33\ntake the other actions included in the SMESDP, in each case as described in the \ndevelopment policy letter and the policy matrix, and ensure that such policies and \nactions continue in effect for the duration of SMESDP and subsequently. The \nGovernment will consult with ADB in preparing and finalizing the SME policy and \ndevelopment framework, including the inclusion as appropriate of internationally \naccepted market-based principles regarding SME development. \n(ii)  The  Government  will  ensure,  through  an  active  consultation  process,  the \nparticipation  of  various  stakeholders  including  the  private  sector,  financial \ninstitutions, development partners, nongovernment organizations, and research \nand  academic  institutions  in  the  finalization  and  implementation  of  the  SME \npolicy and development framework and the components under such policy, as \ndetailed in the policy matrix.  \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that (i) women entrepreneurs are represented in the \npreparation  of  the  SME  policy  and  development  framework,  and  (ii)  women \nentrepreneurs are represented on the NCID. The Government will also ensure \nthat the SME database has gender-disaggregated data.  \n \n115.  For the project loan: \n \n(i)  BB will ensure that the PFIs satisfy the selection and ongoing eligibility criteria to \nserve as a PFI under the SEF described in para. 66 above. BB will also ensure \nthat subprojects are selected based on the criteria described in para. 64 above. \n(ii)  A minimum of 10% of SEF will be earmarked for lending to women entrepreneurs \nto ensure access by women borrowers. Earmarked funds that are not utilized \nwithin a period of 1.5 years will revert to the general pool. \n(iii)  Activities financed through the subloans and subleases will be carried out in \naccordance  with  applicable  ADB  procurement,  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and other guidelines and policies. With respect to the environment, \nthe Government will carry out the Project in compliance with the relevant laws \nand regulations and ADB's Environment Policy (2002). The Government will also \nensure  that  BB  develops  an  appropriate  environmental  monitoring  system \ncomprising  policy  and  procedures  for  monitoring  of  and  reporting  on  PFIs\u2019 \nenvironmental  management  systems  for  implementing  compliance  by \nsubborrowers with all relevant environmental regulations.  \n(iv)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  performance  of  SME  credit  facilities \ncurrently administered directly by various government agencies and public sector \nFIs is reviewed and measures are taken to improve the targeting and efficiency \nof utilization of such facilities. \n(v)  The Government will ensure that, in a phased manner, management of the SME \ncredit  facilities  currently  directly  administered  by  the  Government  will  be \ntransferred to the SME Foundation to be established under the Program. \n \n116.  For the TA loan, the Government will ensure that (i) targeted training programs for \nwomen  entrepreneurs  are  developed  to  address  their  specific  needs;  and  (ii)  a  forum  is \norganized to allow women labor and employees to discuss their training and capacity building \nneeds; such needs shall be taken into consideration in the training programs under the TA loan. \n \n117.  Conditions for Effectiveness of the Program, Project, and TA Loan Agreements. \nConditions for effectiveness will include cross-effectivity such that effectiveness of any of these \nagreements  will  require  satisfaction  of  all  conditions  of  effectiveness  of  the  other  two \nagreements (excluding effectiveness of such other agreements).  ", "34  \n \n118.  Condition for Disbursement of the Project Loan. Execution of the administrative \nagreement  between  the  Government  and  BB  and  entry  into  a  participation  agreement \nacceptable to ADB between BB and an eligible PFI. \n \nVII.

Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Sector \n \n1.  Definition of SMEs. The Industrial Policy 1999 defines SMEs as enterprises employing \nfewer  than  99  workers  and/or  with  a  fixed  capital  investment  of  under  Tk300  million.1  The \nBangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) classifies enterprises in the 2001-2003 Census of Non-\nFarm Economic Activities (the Economic Census) according to total persons engaged and define \nmicroenterprises as those with total persons engaged of fewer than 10, small between 10 to 49, \nmedium 50 to 99, and large 100 or more. Development partners involved in the SME sector have \ndifferent definitions of SMEs.2 The major commercial banks follow the Industrial Policy definition in \nterms of investment capital for lending purposes. In the new Industrial Policy, manufacturing SMEs \nare defined in terms of fixed investment excluding land and building: small, with fixed investment \nless than or equal to Tk15 million and medium, with fixed investment greater than Tk15 million and \nless than or equal to Tk100 million. For nonmanufacturing, small enterprises are those with fewer \nthan  25  full-time  employees,  and  medium  enterprises  with  between  25  and  100  full-time \nemployees. \n \n2.  Population of SMEs. There are varying estimates of the SME population in line with \ndifferent definitions of what constitutes the SME sector. The most recent estimates are from the \nEconomic Census, which covered a total of 3.68 million establishments including microenterprises \nof fewer than 10 persons engaged, which constitute the informal sector. The number of small, \nmedium, and large establishments totaling 85,427 is broken down by size: 74,629 are small, 5,125 \nmedium, and 5,673 large. The breakdown of SMEs into urban and rural is as follows: 48,584 \nurban-based SMEs, of which 92.2% are small and 7.8% are medium, and 31,160 rural-based \nSMEs, of which 95.7% are small and 4.3% are medium. These include cottage and handloom \nindustries,  provided  the  total  number  of  persons  employed  is  10  or  more.  Total  number  of \nmanufacturing SMEs is 28,296 of which 14,755 are in urban areas and 13,541 are in rural areas. \nFrom the 2003 National Private Sector Survey of Enterprises in Bangladesh,3 it was estimated that \napproximately 6 million micro-, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) defined as enterprises \nwith fewer than 100 employees are operating in Bangladesh. The MSMEs are generally very small \nin size, with 5 workers on average (including the proprietor); about 90% of MSMEs have 10 or \nfewer workers,4 and less than 2% have 50 or more workers. MSMEs are heavily concentrated in \nwholesale and retail trade, production and sale of agricultural goods, and manufacturing. Over \nthree quarters of MSMEs are located in rural areas.  \n \n3.  Significance of SMEs. SMEs have a significant role in generating growth and employment. \nSMEs are reported to account for about 40% of the gross manufacturing output, about 80% of \nindustrial employment, and about 25% of the total labor force in Bangladesh. In 1991, Bangladesh \nSmall and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC) reported around 0.81 million employed in small \nenterprises and 1.67 million in cottage industries. The Economic Census reports total employment \nof 3.90 million in the nonfarm formal sector, with 1.37 million employed in small enterprises, 0.34 \n                                                 \n1  Most enterprises located in the BSCIC industrial estates, other than the major ones in Chittagong, Dhaka, and \nNarayanganj, are reported to have asset values in the range between Tk0.2 million and Tk10 million. \n2  The issue of non-uniform and inconsistent definitions was one of the major topics discussed in the February 2004 SME \nworkshop supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) held in Dhaka. \n3  The survey was funded by the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom (DFID), United States \nAgency for International Development (USAID), Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, and Swedish \nInternational  Development  Cooperation  Agency.  Conducted  from  March  to  June  2003,  it  enumerated  10,096 \nenterprises (defined as income-generating households or activities that market at least 75% of their products).  \n4  The balance of 10% of the estimated population, about 600,000, can be considered to be in the SME category. \nHowever, this number is excessively higher than other estimates. In part, it includes enterprises in the farm sector. \n ", " 48 Appendix 3 \nmillion in medium enterprises, and 2.19 million in large enterprises. The 2003 Private Sector \nSurvey  estimated  that  the  MSMEs  employ  31  million  and  contribute  20\u201325%  of  total  gross \ndomestic product. \n \n4.  Distribution by Sector.  In manufacturing, 56% of enterprises are in food and allied \nproducts. A distant second in terms of numbers, is the textiles, wearing apparel, and leather \nindustries  category.  Over  the  past  two  decades,  the  share  of  food  and  allied  products  has \ndecreased and that of textiles, wearing apparel, and leather industries has increased, and other \nindustries have grown with the introduction of new and more modern products. The growth of the \nreadymade garments industry, which directly employs over 1.5 million workers, mostly women, and \nindirectly supports employment of up to 15 million, is phenomenal. Food products and textile and \ngarment firms account for over 60% of registered SMEs. In recent years, there has been a rapid \ngrowth in numbers and types of activities of SMEs in the service sector; however, these are \ngenerally  of  very  small  size  and  there  is  scant  information  regarding  these  enterprises. \nNonetheless, their economic potential is expected to be significant, considering their contribution to \nemployment.  \n \n5.  Women Entrepreneurs and Women-Run SMEs. The majority of women entrepreneurs in \nBangladesh  fall  under  the  categories  of  either  micro  or  small.  At  least  86%  of  women \nentrepreneurs  are  believed  to  be  home-based  and  categorized  as  microenterprises.  Women \nentrepreneurs are heavily concentrated in manufacturing of clothing, retail sales not in stores, \nspinning and weaving of textiles, and livestock and dairy production. \n \nB.  Issues and Constraints \n \n6.  Despite positive macroeconomic figures, Bangladesh remains one of the poorest countries \nin the world, with a per capita income of around $385, and income poverty of 50%. Although \nBangladesh has performed well in the past decade both on macroeconomic and social indicators, \nthe country has not reached its growth potential. A survey of 1,000 manufacturing firms conducted \nin 1992 for an investment climate assessment by the World Bank reported that the main obstacles \nto  their  growth  are:  (i) poor  physical  infrastructure;  (ii) frequent  power  outages  and  surges; \n(iii) pervasive corruption; (iv) regulatory governance problems; and (v) limited access to finance. \nIneffective, inadequate, and antiquated laws and regulations; non-enforcement of existing laws; \nand weaknesses coupled with lack of transparency and accountability in the bureaucracy, judiciary, \nand legislative bodies further complicates business operations. The culture of informal payments, \nkickbacks, and political interference remains prevalent. The discretionary powers afforded to the \ninspecting authorities are also abused. While these problems affect all enterprises irrespective of \nsize, SMEs are disproportionately affected due to their small scale of operations and limited \nresources to address the problems.  \n \n7.  The proposed Small and Medium Enterprise Sector Development Program (SMESDP) aims \nat introducing policy reforms and creating support infrastructure targeted at SMEs to enhance their \ncapabilities and facilitate their access to necessary resources to deal with the regulatory, credit, \ncapacity,  and  other  key  constraints.  In  parallel,  assistance  programs  of  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment partners are addressing the structural problems in the areas of private sector and \nfinancial  sector  development.  The  attached  framework  for  SME  development  presents  the \nproblems grouped into three areas: lack of access to credit, poor enabling environment, and \ninadequate business support services and capacity-building assistance. The table summarizes \nongoing government initiatives, and development partner assistance programs, identifies gaps, \nand describes key features of SMESDP to address the gaps. \n   ", " \nTable A3: Framework for Small and Medium Enterprise Development \n \nIssues and Constraints  Government Initiatives  Development Partner Interventions  Gaps  SMESDP \nA.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n   \nSector identified as a national priority in country  Sector identified as a national priority in country \npoverty analysis?  Yes  poverty partnership agreement?  Yes \nIn its National Strategy for Economic Growth, Poverty  Under the poverty partnership agreement signed in \nReduction,  and  Social  Development  (the  April 2000, the Government\u2019s strategy for reduction of \nGovernment\u2019s  Interim  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  income poverty and human poverty is to accelerate \nPaper [I-PRSP]), dated March 2003, the Government  economic  growth  and  ensure  adequate  supply  of \nidentified five broad sets of policies to reduce poverty:  basic  needs.  Poverty  reduction  will  be  facilitated \n(i) pro-poor  economic  growth,  (ii) human  through expansion of private investment and nonfarm \ndevelopment, (iii) women\u2019s advancement and closing  employment, especially in less developed rural areas. \nof  gender  gaps,  (iv) social  protection,  and  The  Government  supports  the  development  of \n(v) participatory  governance.  The  development  of  financial intermediation to meet the requirements of \nsmall and medium enterprises (SMEs) will contribute  SMEs in rural areas. \nto pro-poor economic growth.  \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh: \n \nAs a consequence of steady economic growth during the past decade, income poverty in Bangladesh has \ndeclined from 59% to 50%. However, poverty rates and absolute numbers are still very high, and considerable \nurban-rural and regional disparities exist. Bangladesh remains one of the poorest countries in the world, with a \nper capita income of around $385. To achieve the goal of halving the poverty level by 2015, Bangladesh needs \nto sustain a gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of about 7% per year over the next 10 years. The \ndevelopment of SMEs is one of the priority policy measures to promote pro-poor growth. The SME sector has \nplayed a very important role in the economy and accounts for about 40% of gross manufacturing output, 80% \nof industrial employment, and 25% of the total labor force. Many SMEs are concentrated in certain industries, \nsuch as the textile and garment industry, which accounts for about 75% of the country\u2019s exports. SMEs have \nincreased participation in the rural economy, where most of the poor live, providing livelihood and employment \nopportunities in agro-processing, food production, and nonfarm rural economic activities. However, SMEs have \nnot been able to attain its full potential in contributing to economic growth and poverty reduction due to various \nbottlenecks in the SME sector (such as lack of access to credit, market, and business support services), and \nstructural problems in the overall business environment (such as poor law and order, weak governance, \ninadequate infrastructure, and market failures in the financial sector). Small and Medium Enterprise Sector \nDevelopment Program (SMESDP) will aim at strengthening the policy environment and providing support \ninfrastructure for SMEs to improve access by SMEs to credit and related support services to help overcome \nconstraints to their efficient operation, growth, and expansion. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                              Targeting Classification: General Intervention (GI)   \n \nSMESDP is expected to have direct poverty impact through an improved access to necessary resources for \nthe SME operations including credit and capacity-building support targeted at the small end of SMEs and \ndisadvantaged groups such as SMEs located in rural area, women entrepreneurs, and workers in the \nreadymade garment (RMG) industry displaced due to the phaseout of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA). \nFurther, SMESDP will introduce policy reforms and create support infrastructure to facilitate the growth of the \nSME sector and consequently promote economic activities through supply chain linkage between SMEs and \nother businesses. Various components under SMESDP will contribute to poverty reduction, as follows. \n \nImproved Access to Credit. Lack of access to finance is one of the main impediments to SME growth. \nBecause of their limited financial base, SMEs face difficulties raising funds from the formal sector. SMEs often \nborrow money from relatives and friends, or from informal credit sources that are costly and inadequate. The \nproblem is more pronounced for the \u201cmissing middle\u201d group, consisting of enterprises that are too large for \nfunding from nongovernment organizations, microfinance institutions, or government assistance programs but \ntoo small for formal bank borrowing. The Program will directly address this gap by contributing to the Small \nEnterprise Fund (SEF), which was set up by the Government to be channeled through participating financial \ninstitutions (PFIs) to small enterprises that have fixed assets of less than Tk10 million. \n \nProvision of Incentives. Currently, the Government provides a tax holiday for newly established enterprises, \nirrespective of size. However, this tax holiday scheme is expected to be abolished in the next fiscal year. Given \ntheir small scale of operations and more limited resources, SMEs will be more adversely affected by the \ndiscontinuance of the tax holiday. SMESDP will support other tax measures, i.e., 75% income tax rebate and \n ", "72   Appendix 11 \naccelerated depreciation rates, in lieu of the tax holiday. These incentives will be provided to very small \nenterprises, which have fixed assets excluding land and building of less than Tk3 million, to alleviate their \nfinancial burden and enhance their viability during the startup phase. \n \nTargeted Training and Capacity-Building Assistance. Training programs under SMESDP will be targeted at \na disadvantaged group of SMEs, i.e., those in the rural areas and women entrepreneurs. In addition, SMESDP \nwill support retraining programs of displaced RMG workers which will be demand driven taking into account \nskills requirements of prospective employers. These training programs will be implemented in collaboration \nwith the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI), which has affiliated with \ndistrict chambers and business associations as well as women entrepreneurs\u2019 associations. This public-private \npartnership is expected to have outreach impact through business network and linkages between these \nchambers and associations and SMEs in their respective areas.  \n \nMore Effective Public Service Institutions. Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC), \nthe principal government organization mandated to promote the development of small and cottage industries \n(SCIs) has an institutional network of industry service centers in 64 districts, industrial estates in all districts, \nproduct development projects, poverty alleviation projects, Small and Cottage Industries Training Institute \n(SCITI),  Design  Center,  and  skills  development  centers.  Despite  its  long  experience  in  the  sector,  its \nperformance has not met expectations. The Program will conduct a diagnostic study of BSCIC to identify \nrestructuring alternatives, move BSCIC towards a leaner and more effective organization, and strengthen the \nrole of BSCIC\u2019s district offices in the delivery of government assistance to SCIs nationwide. SCITI will also be \nstrengthened to play a more effective role in implementing demand-driven training programs on a sustainable \nbasis. In addition, SMESDP will strengthen the capacity of Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution \n(BSTI) in its product certification function to ensure the credibility of BSTI\u2019s certification mark. SMEs will be \nprovided with a special window to access BSTI\u2019s services. BSTI will conduct public awareness campaigns \nespecially among SMEs to encourage them to comply with the product certification requirements. The \nimprovement in quality of SME products will enhance export potential and generate additional income. A study \nwill be conducted to identify industries with potential to be developed into clusters or industrial parks. This will \nbe a step towards identifying competitive advantage of enterprises, providing appropriate infrastructure to \nnurture their growth, thus diversifying Bangladeshi exports and preparing the country for the entry into the \nWorld Trade Organization. Making these industries competitive in the world market will not only improve \neconomic growth, but also reduce vulnerabilities, especially of the poor.   \n \nMore  Extensive  Outreach  of  SME  Support  Infrastructure.  SME  helpline  outreach  centers  will  be \nestablished in BSCIC\u2019s district offices nationwide in phases. First, the centers will be set up in Dhaka and \nChittagong and then expanded to at least half of districts in 2.5 years.  The helpline outreach centers will \nprovide one-on-one \u201chandholding\u201d assistance and advisory services to SMEs. The presence of the centers in \nthe vicinity is expected to encourage SMEs and other persons interested to set up an enterprise to use their \nservices. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder analysis prepared:  No  Participation Strategy:  No \nStakeholder Analysis. The Report of the National Task Force on Development of Small and Medium \nEnterprises was based on the discussions in the Asian Development Bank-supported national SME workshop \nheld in February 2004 with participation from various stakeholders consisting of various government ministries \nand agencies, development partners, chambers and industry associations, financial institutions, and research \nand academic institutions to identify constraints, opportunities, and issues regarding the development of SMEs \nin the country. \n \nParticipation  Strategy.  The  implementation  of  SMESDP  will  be  based  on  public-private  collaborative \nprocesses. An SME Advisory Panel to be established and mandated to develop an action plan to implement \nthe SME policy will consist of representatives from the concerned ministries, industry associations, private \nsector, and academia. Beneficiaries under the training programs will participate in training need assessments. \nMoreover, a forum will be organized for women workers and entrepreneurs to express their training needs and \nother concerns. The participatory process will ensure the outreach of the Program to targeted beneficiaries.  \n \n \nD.   Gender and Development \nStrategy  to  maximize  impact  on  women.  The  Program  will  (i) encourage  participation  by  women \nentrepreneurs and women-owned businesses in policy advocacy; (ii) facilitate access to credit by women \nentrepreneurs; (iii) enhance women entrepreneurs\u2019 capacity, productivity, and competitiveness through training \nand provision of business development services (BDS); (iv) promote networking among women entrepreneurs\u2019 \n   ", "  Appendix 11  73\nassociations for efficient delivery of government services and effective implementation of collaborative public-\nprivate  mechanisms;  and  (v) develop  a  gender-disaggregated  database  to  be  used  for  planning,  and \nmonitoring and evaluation of programs promoting and supporting women-run SMEs. \nGender plan prepared? Yes. (see Supplementary Appendix 1) \n \nE.   Social Safeguards and Other Social Risks \nSignificant/ \n \nNot Significant/  Plan \nIssues  Uncertain/  Strategy to Address Issues  Required \n \nNone \nResettlement  None  Since the PFIs\u2019 subloans/subleases to SMEs will be largely  No \n  in  the  light  manufacturing,  agro-processing,  trade  and \nservices sector and probably none in infrastructure, it is \nunlikely that involuntary resettlement will occur.  \nIndigenous  None  No  adverse  impact  is  anticipated.  On  the  other  hand,  No \nPeoples  targeted training programs and helpline outreach centers \n  could reach out to indigenous people who could be either \nSME entrepreneurs or employees.   \nLabor  None  Restructuring of concerned agencies involved in the SME  No \n  sector could also cover human resource rationalization. \nHowever,  analysis  of  restructuring  alternatives  will  also \nexplore  the  impact  on  labor  employees  of  these \ninstitutions. Nevertheless, the Program is expected to have \nnet  positive  labor  impact  from  the  capacity-building \nassistance, especially the retraining programs for displaced \nRMG workers that will help them reenter the job market.  \nAffordability  None  First, SMEs will have better access to credit at a lower  No \n  cost.  Based  on  the  discussions  during  the  program \nprocessing stage, preidentified PFIs expect to pass on \nlower costs from SEF to SME borrowers. Further, more \nintense competition is expected to drive down the interest \nrates.  Second,  tax  measures  will  reduce  the  financial \nburden of newly established small enterprises. Third, SCITI \nwill  ensure that training programs  will be affordable to \ntraining participants.
