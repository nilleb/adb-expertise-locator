This  is  considered  critical  to  achieving  the \nobjective of the original project, which was to develop Lumbini, the birth place of Lord Buddha, \nas  an  attractive  cultural  tourism  destination  and  to  upgrade  GBA  to  link  it  with  international \ntourist  circuits  in  South  Asia.    Expanding  the  project  scope\u2014from  an  upgrade  to  regional \ninternational airport standard to  a full international standard\u2014will also enable GBA to serve as \nan alternate and backup international air transport point for Nepal in the event that poor weather \nconditions or a natural calamity shuts down Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA). TIA currently \nis  the  only  airport  in  the  country  that  can  accommodate  full-size  aircrafts.  Restructuring  and \ncompleting the delayed project is expected to provide benefits that will outweigh the costs, and \nis preferred over downsizing or cancelling it by ADB as the government has accorded it a high \npriority.    \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe South Asia Tourism Infrastructure Development Project was approved by the Board \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on 16 November 2009 to develop and improve tourism-\nrelated  infrastructure  in  Bangladesh,  India,  and  Nepal.3 It  aimed  to  support  a  future  pattern  of \ntourism  in  South  Asia  and  envisioned  the  development  of  international  circuits  of  interlinked \nnature  and  cultural  tourism  sites  across  the  region.  The  project\u2019s  intended  impact  was  the \nestablishment of an integrated pattern for the future growth of tourism in South Asia that would \nenhance the sector\u2019s contribution to sustainable and inclusive economic growth.   \n \n4. \nThe  intended  outcome  in  Nepal  was  the  further  development  of  Lumbini  as  a  tourism \ndestination,  building  on  its  natural  attraction  for  the  world\u2019s  Buddhists  and  many  other  cultural \ntourists  and  on  its  inclusion  on  the  World  Heritage  List  of  the  United  Nations  Educational, \nScientific and Cultural Organization.4 The key output designed to achieve this outcome was the \nupgrading  of  GBA,  which  is  20  kilometers  east  of  Lumbini  and  could  accommodate  only \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Established by the Government of Japan. \n3   ADB.  2009.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loans,  Asian \nDevelopment Fund Grant, and Administration of Loan  to the People's Republic of Bangladesh, India, and Nepal: \nSouth Asia Tourism Infrastructure Development Project. Manila (ADF Loan 2580 $12 million to Bangladesh; OCR \nLoan 2578 $20 million to India; and ADF Loan 2579 $12.75 million and Grant 0179 $12.75 million to Nepal). \n\n4   The  World  Heritage  List  includes  981  sites  that  are  considered  to  form  part  of  humankind\u2019s  cultural  and  natural \n\nheritage and to have outstanding universal value. \n\n\f2 \n\ndomestic  flights,  so  that  it  could  provide  direct  air  connectivity  to  Lumbini  for  international \ntourists currently travelling via TIA. Due to the project\u2019s delay, the lack of direct international air \nlink  continues  to  keep  tourism  growth  in  the  Lumbini  area  from  reaching  its  full  potential.  The \nrunway and apron at GBA do not meet the standards for international flights by even medium-\nsized jet aircrafts, and the airport also lacks facilities for processing international passengers.5 In \n2012,  most  of  the  795,800  recorded  visitors  to  Lumbini  traveled  by  road  from  points  in  Nepal \nand  from  India.  International  visitors  who  travel  by  air  must  be  routed  through  TIA  to  connect \nfrom international flights to domestic flights to GBA.6 \n \n5. \nUpgrading  GBA  for  access  by  full-size  international  aircraft  will  enable  airlines  to \nestablish  direct  air  services  from  countries  that  generate  the  majority  of  visitors  to  Lumbini. \nCurrently,  in  order  of  visitor  numbers,  people  from  India,  Sri  Lanka,  Thailand,  and  Myanmar \nhave  visited  Lumbini.  The  expansion  could  also  increase  tourism  from  more  distant  sources, \nsuch as the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea.7 Direct international \nair routes to GBA could also attract foreign tourists who visit three other cultural sites in India on \nwhat  is  called  Footsteps  of  Lord  Buddha  tourist circuits  but  who  now  must travel  by  road or a \nroundabout  air  route  through  TIA. 8  With  the  GBA  upgrade,  annual  international  annual \npassenger traffic through GBA is forecast to reach 759,639 in 2030, including 281,806 visitors to \nLumbini.9 Although this was not considered in the original project design, the government now \nsees GBA upgrade as critically needed since it will provide Nepal with a second international air \naccess point in an emergency and prepare for the eventual overloading of capacity at TIA (para. \n2). 10 The  original  project  also  included  steps  to  enhance  Lumbini  as  a  tourist  destination  by \nimproving the environment and services for visitors, fostering participation by local communities \nin livelihood opportunities tourism growth will offer, and strengthening the project management \ncapacity  of  related  government  agencies.11 These  activities  will  be  completed  and  augmented \nalongside the enhanced GBA upgrade under the proposed additional financing (para. 8).  \n \n6. \nThe original financing agreement for the Nepal portion of the project provided a loan and \na grant from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  each  equivalent to  $12.75 million.  It  was  signed \non 25 May 2010 and declared effective on 3 September 2010. In addition, the OPEC Fund for \nInternational  Development  agreed  to  cofinance the  project through  a  loan  of  $15.0 million  that \nwas to be administered by ADB but has not yet been disbursed due to project delay.  \n \n7. \nThe  costs  of  upgrading  GBA  have  risen  38%  over  the  original  project  appraisal \nestimates  in  2008  mainly  due  to  price  escalation  during  the  project  delay  for  key  construction \nmaterials and equipment. Based on the detailed engineering design in 2013, the base cost for \n                                                \n5   The originally designed upgrade was to enable access to GBA by medium-size aircrafts such as Boeing 757 and \n\nAirbus 300 designated as Code 2 by the International Civil Aviation Organization.   \n\n6   Travelers from within Nepal make up 68% of visitors to Lumbini. The most numerous foreign visitors are from India \n(120,584 in 2012). Many visitors from India now travel by air to points near Nepal, such as Kushinagar, from which \nthey are then transported by tour buses the 150 kilometers to Lumbini.    \n\n7  International tourism is growing rapidly in Lumbini. The number of foreign tourists excluding those from India rose \nfrom 39,800 in 2005 to 136,000 in 2012, or at an annual growth rate of 19%. The main countries of origin in 2012 \nwere  India  (47.0%),  Sri  Lanka  (20.5%),  Thailand  (11.1%),  and  Myanmar  (6.9%).  Others  included  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  (3.4%),  the  Republic  of  Korea  (2.0%),  Viet  Nam  (1.4%),  the  Netherlands  (0.8%),  and  Japan \n(0.7%).    \n\n8   The  Footsteps  of  Lord  Buddha  circuit  consists  of  Lumbin  in  Nepal,  and  Bodhgaya,  Sarnath,  and  Kushinagar  in \n\n9   In  2012,  the  level  of  aircraft  activity  at  GBA  amounted  to  4,172  annual  aircraft  movements,  or  an  average  of  5 \n\nflights per day, which carried a total of almost 122,000 annual domestic passengers. \n\n10 TIA is in a high-risk zone to a major earthquake and vulnerable to liquefaction. It has also reached runway capacity \n\nsaturation during daylight hours and is expected to be fully congested in 2021.   \n\n11 The related government agencies are the Lumbini Development Trust and the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. \n\nIndia. \n\n \n\n\fthe originally planned GBA upgrade, excluding contingency, had increased from $32.4 million in \nmid-2008  prices  to  about  $44.6  million  in  mid-2012.  The  expanded  scope  of  the  upgrade  will \nimprove  safety  and  allow  the  use  of  larger  international  aircrafts  and  unconstrained  traffic \ngrowth at the airport. The scaling up of the original upgrade design will add 400 meter length to \nthe  runway  and  300  meter  length  to  the  taxiway,  overlay  the  existing  1,500  meter  runway  for \nuse  as  a  parallel  taxiway,  construct  15,169  square  meter  terminal  building,  improve  drainage \nsystem,  and  install  more  advanced  navigational  aids,  equipment  and  airport  lighting  for  air \nsafety.12 These  are  estimated  to  require  additional  74%  of  the  updated  cost  for  the  original \nscope, or 140% of the original project estimate in 2008.13 \n   \n8. \nThe  additional  financing  will  restructure  the  project  and  improve  implementation  as \ndesign and supervision consultant has been recruited, and procurement of civil work to up-scale \nGBA upgrading from the original design has been commenced. Past performance and expected \nimprovements are summarized below: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nResults  against  expected  outputs.  A  bid  document  for  the  main  output  of \nupgrading  GBA  has  been  completed.  The  bidding  process  for  the  contract  has \nbegun, with the award contingent upon ADB approval of the additional financing. \nA contractor has been selected to upgrade water supply and sanitation and build \na  new  visitor  center  and  information  displays,  car  parks,  and  bus  stops  for  the \nsecond  output\u2014improving  the  tourism  destination  environment  and  services  in \nLumbini. A consultant has been mobilized for the third output\u2014enhance capacity, \nincrease community participation, and improve project management.  \nImplementation progress. As of January 2014, with 55% of the financing period \nelapsed,  the  cumulative  contract  award  was  $3.95  million  (15.5%  of  available \nloan and grant proceeds) and cumulative disbursement was $1.92 million (7.5%). \nProcurement  of  design,  supervision  and  project  management  consultants  and \nrelated disbursements, and contract award for construction of information center \nin  Lumbini  have  contributed  the  progress.  Upon  award  of  the  main  contract  for \nupgrading  GBA,  overall  progress  on  implementation  is  expected  to  improve \nsubstantially. \nSafeguard  compliance.  Overall,  the  current  project  is  in  compliance  with \nspecific  assurances  and  environmental  and  social  covenants  stipulated  in  the \nfinancing agreement. \n\n(iv)  Management  of  risks.  The  main  risk  associated  with \n\nimplementation \narrangement  has  been mitigated  satisfactorily,  because  the  project coordination \nunit and project management and implementation units are well established and \nhave  adequate  full-time  staffing.  The  consultant  for  design  and  supervision  has \nbeen mobilized and is performing satisfactorily.  \nProject performance rating. The current project performance is rated on track.14 \nThe  restructuring  of  the  project  will  expedite  the  award  of  the  main  contract  for \nupgrading  GBA,  and  the  improved  disbursement  will  help  project  performance \nstay on track. \n\n(v) \n\n                                                \n12 GBA needs the increased capacity to handle full-size, wide-body passenger airlines currently serving TIA. These \ninclude Code E aircrafts designated by the International Civil Aviation Organization such as Boeing 777 and Airbus \nA330.  The  design  under  the  original  project  to  use  an  existing  unfinished  concrete  frame  for  the  international \nterminal was found to be technically unfeasible.  \n\n13  The base cost for upgrading of GBA, excluding contingency, was estimated $32.4 million at appraisal period (mid-\n\n2008 prices), and updated in mid-2012 prices to cost about $44.6 million.  \n\n14  A project with a total rating score of 0.90 is on track. The five indicators have equal weight and relate to technical, \n\nprocurement, disbursement, financial management, and safeguards performance. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fADB\u2019s administration of a grant to be provided by ACEF for the additional financing will \n9. \nsupport  the  introduction  of  clean  public  transport  services  (CPTS)  using  electric  vehicles  for \ntourists and local residents in Lumbini area. This will help reduce noise and pollution from poorly \nmaintained diesel and gasoline engine buses and add value to tourism experience.15 \n \n10. \nRestructuring  and  completing  the  South  Asia  Tourism  Infrastructure  Development \nProject  offers  more  benefits  than  scaling  it  down  or  cancelling  it. 16  The  restructuring  is \nnecessary  to  achieve  original  project\u2019s  intended  impact  and  outcome.  The  ACEF-financed \nCPTS  will  complement  the  project\u2019s  other  elements  and  enhance  its  overall  tourism \ndevelopment  objectives.  The  project  remains  technically  feasible,  economically  viable,  and \nfinancially sound. It is accorded high priority by the government and, consistent with priorities in \nthe  civil  aviation  and  tourism  sectors  outlined  in  the  country\u2019s  new  Three  Year  Plan  (2014-\n2016). 17  The  proposed  additional  financing  supports  the  strategic  objectives  of  improving \nconnectivity, which is established in ADB's Nepal country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 and \nis  included  in  the  country  operations  business  plan,  2014\u20132016.18 The  project  meets  eligibility \ncriteria for additional financing.19  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \nThe  impact  will  be  the  enhanced  contribution  of  tourism  to  sustainable  and  inclusive \ngrowth in Nepal. The outcome will be nature and culture-based tourism destinations improved. \nAn outcome indicator will be added on tourists\u2019 public transport service usage, as a result of the \nACEF-financed CPTS.   \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \nAs  in  the  original  project,  the  outputs  will  be  (i)  enhanced  connectivity  to  and  from \nLumbini;  (ii)  improved  community  services  and  tourism  facilities;  and  (iii)  improved  capacity  in \ntourism  development  and  project  management.  As  a  result  of  the  scaling  up  of  the  GBA \ncomponent  and  the  additional  financing,  the  performance  indicators  for  the  first  two  outputs \nhave been revised. To achieve enhanced connectivity, GBA will be upgraded to operate as an \ninternational  airport  by  2017,  rather  than  regional  international  airport  in 2015. To improve the \ndestination,  the  scaled-up  project  will  aim  to  put  electric  vehicle-based  CPTS  for  tourists  and \nlocal people in Lumbini into operation by 2017, in addition to improved destination environment \nand infrastructure. \n \nD. \n \n13. \n \nto \n14. \nSDR19,487,000 ($30.0 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance \nthe project.

The \nengineering design is based on site condition surveys and field investigations. The improvement \nworks  are  designed for  optimal  economy  and  construction  efficiency  in  accord  with  applicable \ninternational  design  standards.  Proven  technology  and  standard  materials  that  are  compatible \nwith  local  conditions  will  be  used  in  the  construction.  To  enhance  resilience  in  severe  climatic \nevents and threats, hydrological hazards have been given local consideration. This includes an \nelevated design for the new runway and taxiway and provision for adequate drainage.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n20. \nThe economic assessment was carried out in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects.23 The overall project, including the revisions under the additional \nfinancing for cost escalation and the expanded GBA and destination upgrades was examined. \nThe  economic  costs  considered  included  all  investment  costs  and  airport  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M).  The  estimated  economic  benefits  from  the  project  included  airport \nrevenues from  aircraft  services,  passenger fees,  and commercial  activities  at GBA;  as  well  as \nthe  benefits  from  increased  tourist  spending  in  Lumbini.  The  economic  rate  of  return  for  the \nentire project with the additional financing was estimated to be 16.3%, which is higher than the \nopportunity  cost  of  capital  at  12%  and  indicates  sufficient  return  and  economic  viability.  The \nresults  of  sensitivity  analysis,  which  produced  returns  of  13.5%  -  16.3%,  showed  the  project\u2019s \neconomic  viability  to  be  robust  against  downside  risks.  These  included  a  10%  cost  overrun,  a \n10% decline in expected benefits, 10% higher O&M costs, and a delay in benefits of 1 year. \n \n21. \nThe  financial  analysis  assessed  whether  revenues  from  the  GBA  improvements  would \ncover  the  capital  and  operating  costs  of  the  upgrade.  The  estimated  financial  rate  of  return  of \nthe overall project, including the additional financing, was estimated at 12.9%. The analysis was \nrestricted to the viability of GBA expansion. It used the most likely traffic forecast. The estimated \nfinancial  rate  of  return  is  higher  than the  4.6%  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  indicating  an \nadequate  financial  return.  The  return  remained  satisfactory  and  in  a  range  of  10.8%  -  12.9% \nunder  sensitivity  analysis.  The  scenarios  tested  included  a  10%  capital  cost  overrun,  a  10% \nO&M cost overrun, a 10% decline in projected revenue from international visitors, and a 1-year \nimplementation  delay.  The  financial  sustainability  assessment  indicates  that  the  project  will \ngenerate sufficient liquid cash resources to meet its O&M costs and debt service obligations.   \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n22. \nPolicy, legal, and institutional capacity. The Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN), \nthe implementing agency for GBA upgrading, was established by the Civil Aviation of Nepal Act, \n1996 as an autonomous state authority. It is supervised by the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and \nCivil  Aviation  and  responsible  for  administering  and  regulating  civil  aviation  in  Nepal,  for \noperating  both  domestic  and  international  airports,  air  traffic,  and  air  navigation  systems.  The \nLumbini Development Trust (LDT), the implementing agency for tourist destination improvement \n\n                                                \n23 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\factivities,  was  formed  by  the  Lumbini  Development  Trust  Act,  1985  to  restore  the  Lumbini \nSacred Garden under the Lumbini Master Plan. The CAAN and the LDT have sufficient capacity, \npast  experience,  and  institutional  strength  to  implement  the  overall  project.  Both  are  being \nsupported  under  the  original  project  by  consultant  services  for  detailed  engineering  design, \npreparation of bidding documents, and identifying and monitoring safeguards requirements.  \n \n23. \nFinancial  management.  The  financial  management  assessment  of  the  CAAN  was \nupdated in 2013. The update covered funds-flow arrangements, governance, staffing, budgeting, \naccounting  and  financial  reporting  systems,  internal  control  procedures,  financial  information \nsystems,  and  internal  and  external  auditing  arrangements.  The  CAAN  will  prepare  a  business \nplan,  and  design,  install,  and  operate  a  financial  management  reporting  system  that  will  link \nGBA  with  the  CAAN  corporate  financial  management  information  system  in  Kathmandu.  The \nCAAN and the LDT will maintain separate project records and accounts to identify the financing \nresources  received  and  expenditures  made  for  the  project,  ensuring  an  adequate  audit  trail. \nThey  will  have  the  annual  financial  statements  audited  by  an  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB  in \naccordance with auditing standards acceptable to ADB. \n \n24. \nOperation  and  maintenance.  The  CAAN\u2019s  Airport  Operation  Directorate  provides \nadequate  maintenance  services  for  TIA  and  46  domestic  airports,  including  GBA.  The \ndirectorate comprises an aerodrome engineering department, an electromechanical department, \nand  fire  and  rescue  department.  With  only  85  staff  in  the  CAAN,  it  relies  on  external  local \ncontractors  for  several  maintenance  functions  including  some  major  activities  for  maintaining \nrunways,  taxiways,  and  aprons.  The  CAAN  plans  to  establish  a  separate  airport  operations \ndivision  for  the  upgraded  GBA  with  aerodrome,  electromechanical,  and  fire  and  rescue  units \nthat will have 10 fulltime maintenance workers. Additional or more specialized maintenance staff \nwill be seconded from the CAAN when required.   \n \n25. \nProcurement  and  anticorruption.  All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be \nundertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). All consultants will be recruited according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). The government\u2019s procurement environment is improving. \nThe  government  is  strengthening  its  effort  to  fight  corruption.  Nepal  has  legislation  with \nanticorruption provisions in force, including the Promoting Market Competition Act, 2006; Right \nto  Information  Act,  2007;  Special  Court  Act,  2002  (amended  in  2007);  and  Anti-Money \nLaundering Act, 2008. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n26. \nwith  the  government,  the  CAAN  and  the  LDT.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 20). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n27. \nThe  poverty  and  social analysis  has  been  updated,  and the  overall  project  is  classified \nas  some  gender  elements.  Women  and  men  will  benefit  from  the  project  through  improved \nopportunities  for  income  generation  and  employment,  directly  by  participating  in  the  tourism \nactivities and indirectly through increased employment to be generated by the economic growth \nspurred  by  increased  tourist  inflows.  The  improved  international  connectivity  through  the  GBA \nupgrade and the better tourist infrastructure and amenities in Lumbini will also result in general \nbenefits to local communities, including women. An increase in tourist arrivals and spending will \nexpand  the  market  for  local  handicrafts  and  community-based  tourism,  which  will  also  benefit \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fwomen. The CAAN will give special attention to constructing infrastructure in the GBA terminal \nthat caters to the needs of women, children, the disabled, and the elderly. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n1. \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples \n\n \n28. \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement.  No  additional  land  or  asset  acquisition  will  be \nrequired under the additional financing. The additional financing is classified as category B for \ninvoluntary resettlement safeguards, since compensation has already been completed for 95% \nof  those  affected  by  the  upgrading  of  GBA.  After  due  diligence,  the  original  resettlement  plan \nwas  revised,  agreed  to  by  the  CAAN  and  disclosed  on  18  November  2013.  It  addresses  the \noutstanding  activities  from  the  original  plan  and  is  in  line  with  Nepal\u2019s  laws  and  policies  and \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  original  project  was  classified  as  category  A. \nThe  construction  of  the  3,000  meter  GBA  runway  was  expected  to  affect  590  agricultural  and \nresidential land plots (92.89 hectares) belonging to 312 households, as well as some public and \nprivate  infrastructure.  During  detailed  design,  the  acquisition  of  some  residential  and \ncommercial  structures  was  avoided,  but  a  few  additional  land  plots  (4.38  hectares)  were \nrequired. The number of land plots to be acquired rose to 869. They belong to 389 households. \nCompensation  for  5%  of  these  plots  has  yet  to  be  settled.  They  are  associated  with  33 \nhouseholds  of  which  23  households  cultivating  27  community-owned  plots  are  eligible  for \ncompensation  through  skills  development  training.  The  remaining  16  plots  are  owned  by  14 \nabsentee  landowners,  who  are  in  contact  with  the  CAAN  regarding  compensation.  The  CAAN \nwill  organize  income  generation  training,  give  priority  to  the  affected  people  in  income \nopportunities during construction and operation of GBA, and restore an affected village road as \npart of the civil works contract package during construction.  \n \n29. \nImpact  on  indigenous  peoples.  No  impact  on  indigenous  peoples  is  envisaged,  and \nthe  overall  project  is  classified  as  category C.  If  adverse  impacts  are  identified  during \nimplementation,  the  CAAN  and  the  LDT  will  ensure  that  a  plan  for  indigenous  peoples  is \nprepared for ADB approval in accordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement before award of \nthe related civil works contract and implemented before relevant civil works begin.  \n\n \n2. \n\nEnvironment \n\n \n30. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  environment  category  B,  and  an  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE)  and  an  environmental  management  plan  were  prepared  in accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  Community  consultations  were  carried  out  during \npreparation  of  the  IEE.  The  IEE  concluded  that  no  significant  environmental  impacts  can  be \nexpected from project implementation. The IEE was disclosed on 18 November 2013. However, \nit  has  listed  potential  risks\u2014change  in  land  use,  inundation  of  the  project  area  by  flooding,   \npossible  occupational  health  and  safety  effects  on  workers  during  construction,  and  potential \nnoise nuisance, and pollution from unmanaged solid waste disposal. The CAAN will comply with \nand  implement  the  environmental  management  plan  in  the  IEE  by  adopting  proper  mitigation \nmeasures  to  avoid,  minimize,  or  compensate  for  any  adverse  environmental  impacts.  It  will \nestablish a mechanism to resolve grievances by affected people. The CAAN also prepared an \nenvironmental impact assessment report for extension of the runway to 3,000 meters, which the \nMinistry of Environment approved on 15 March 2011. Implementation arrangements provide for \ninputs by environmental specialists at the project coordination unit and project management and \nimplementation  units  to  implement  the  environmental  management  plan  effectively,  undertake \nmonitoring, and submit reports periodically to ADB. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n31. \nThe  overall  risk  assessment  is  low,  and  the  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected  to  outweigh  costs.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4 \nand described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.24   \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nImplementation  may  be \ndelayed  with  changes  in \npolitical \nand \npolicies. \n\nsituation \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe  PCU  and  PMIUs  have  been  established  with  adequate  staffing.  The \nconsultant for design and supervision has been mobilized and is performing \nsatisfactorily.  The  engineering  design  and  bid  document  for  the  revised \nproject scope is complete. The bidding process is underway for the award of \ncontract  upon  ADB  approval  of  the  additional  financing.  ADB  will  also \nmobilize  additional  consultants  to  ascertain  the  efficiency  and  quality  of \nprocurement process. \nThe  government  considers  the  project  one  of  its  highest  priorities  and  will \nensure  allocation  of  the  required  budget.  The  government  has  already \nallocated NRs2 billion (equivalent to $20 million) for FY2014. \n\nmay \n\ncounterpart \nbe \n\nGovernment \nfunding \ninadequate or delayed. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CAAN = Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, FY = fiscal year, NRs = Nepalese rupee, \nPCU = project coordination unit, PMIU = project management and implementation unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n32. \nThe government;
